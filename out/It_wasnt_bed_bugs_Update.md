I thought all of this was due to bedbugs. After today I definitely know that isn’t the case. I actually think I would prefer the creepy crawly alternative. I’m writing from a parking lot near a decaying warehouse that looks abandoned. I don’t think anyone’s seen me, but I know now that something weird is going on here. I’ve been lied to, played with, and I’m trying to figure out what’s happening. I’m going to make this quick. I don’t think I want to be spotted out here.

I talked to Cindy’s friends at the diner. I assumed they were just refueling on food after a night of heavy drinking at my apartment. They were surprised to see me when I approached their booth which means they probably weren’t aware of what happened between Cindy and I just an hour before. They asked what I was doing here, a hint of amusement in their question, and offered to hang. 

One of them got up and gestured for me to sit, a huskier dude in a black hoodie, Mack, who might have been hiding some muscle under his thick clothing. I sat down. Mack returned to the booth sitting next to me. The two across from us, Carl and Joan, might’ve been a couple. Back at the cider mill, among the brood boxes, they held hands intimately. It was the same case here. Joan was shaved bald. A small tattoo of a pineapple resided on her scalp. Carl, who held her hand, a man with quite the sharp jawline and equally honed facial features, stared at me inquisitively. All of them adorned a silver necklace with a deeply red jewel hanging over their chests.

“I wasn’t really able to sleep. Thought it might be worthwhile to come here and have an early breakfast.” I responded to their curiosity.

It was only 12am. 

“You feeling okay? We can drop you off at home.” Joan had said in an oddly endearing tone.

“Ah, maybe. Thank you. But I was hoping to get some food in me. Cindy might’ve told you guys I’ve been feeling really tired lately.”

Carl nodded slowly.
“She mentioned it before; said her little tulip has been wilting. Kind of why we were worried to see you here so late.”

Little Tulip was Cindy’s nickname for me. I always thought it was cute because I’ve got at least a foot of height on her.

“It ain’t a big deal man. I won’t even make you pay gas money.” Mack said playfully, nudging me.

Their words appeared considerate, but under all their welcoming expressions I sensed a hidden tenseness. As if the air in the room became heavier and difficult for them to breathe. Maybe it was just me. Felt like I had two bowling balls under my rib cage. I didn’t want to go back to the apartment, yet they insisted so adamantly.

“I’m sorry, guys. I haven’t really been truthful. It’s just been a tough night… Cindy and I got into an argument. She kicked me out.” I said, putting on my best pouting face.

Realistically I wanted to sprint out of there. But the larger man was blocking my only exit out of the booth. I tried to look down at the table, but I was glancing all over the diner in intervals trying to find a reasonable exit.

“Can I get you somethin’ hun?” The waitress asked.

Didn’t even hear her walk over, her voice would’ve made me fall out of my seat if someone wasn’t sitting next to me. I looked for the biggest dish on the menu.

“Yeah, can I get the American dream breakfast bash?.. Tea and honey, please.”

She wrote down my order and walked away. I was not finishing that meal anytime soon, and therefore, they could not take me back home until my plate was empty. Joan took out her phone.

“I’m gonna check up on Cindy.”

“No. no. She’s probably asleep now. She worked hard cleaning the place up.” I responded quickly.

But she waved me off and walked outside. I could see her through the window, under the diner’s neon lights, holding the phone up to her ear and saying something into it. I felt stupid for putting myself in this situation. I don’t know why I trusted her friends, they just felt familiar and inviting. It was like I was being babysat. My meal arrived; a stack of pancakes, sausages, french toast, eggs, and my cup of tea. Joan returned as well.

“Cindy wants you to come back with us.”

I declined with a mouthful of food. But she said Cindy was worried and my refusal to return home would only make things worse for us. They said I would be selfish for making her worry because I was upset over a small argument. I ate slowly as I thought. Maybe they were right. Am I overreacting? I imagined Cindy kneeling in bed, tears plummeting down her soft cheeks as she pleaded with Joan over the phone. It made me feel selfish. Carl must’ve caught what I was up to because he requested a takeout box for me when the waitress walked passed. It didn’t matter. I was already in agreement with them.

They dropped me off at the front entrance of my apartment. I closed the door behind me and glanced out the window. They were still parked with the engine on. I turned around toward the darkness of the kitchen. Something shined through the void in the direction of the hallway. I waited for my eyes to adjust.

Deep thuds instantly echoed throughout the apartment as the shining object grew closer. I raised my arms over my head as I waited for… I don’t know. Something painful? Horrifying, maybe? I was enveloped in warmth. I heard soft whimpers in my ear and something wet slid down my neck. I embraced Cindy in my arms as we stood there in the darkness for just a moment.

“Please… please don’t leave me like that again.” She pleaded in my ear.

Her voice filled me with joy, melancholy, anger, and then confusion. I slowly released my grasp of her and backed away. This was the woman I loved. The woman that I had spent two years of my life with. The woman who I felt I could be the most honest with. At that moment I only wished for things to be the same as they were. So I asked;

“Why did you do it?”

“I did it for you.” She said through a cracking voice, holding back tears.

We sat at the table as she explained. I wiped away her tears as she told me about a nurse who was a friend of hers she had visited to ask about my constant fatigue, color change, and rashes. Cindy had been taking blood samples from me so the nurse could run tests and figure out what was going on. I was honest with her, told her what she did was insane, more complicated even than just asking me to schedule a checkup. But she was right when she claimed to be worried about the hospital bills. I work as a local gym receptionist and Cindy as a commercial interior painter, both jobs with a lack of pay and practically no benefits. Her nurse friend owed her a favor and would do it for free. I should’ve asked what she owed her for, but I didn’t..

It made sense when she explained it. I even let her show me how to draw my own blood. The syringes were much larger in appearance since I had the time to stick them inside me. One 250mL syringe would draw blood from my arm or leg, and the other from my neck, chest, or back. I had to withdraw blood until they were both full (I was surprised at how heavy they were when full) then empty them into glass vials for Cindy to store in a refrigerated blue bag of some sort. Like I said, she loved me. I knew that. And because of that this whole process just felt rational. I knew she would do anything for me, and I for her. So I went along with it. 

For a few nights I would bring her vials. She would smile excitedly and give me a kiss before storing them away and shoving the bag into her nightstand. I would always fall asleep instantly that. I remember asking her how the nurse's progress was, or if we could meet her some time for lunch so I could thank her. She snapped at me, saying it would be rude of us to interrupt her with her work, especially since it was a returned favor. Cindy would inform me on updates as they came to her but for now the nurse would need more blood. I asked why they needed so much and she said the tests they were doing were something about duration, not instant results, and to be patient. I was surprised when she talked to me that way, and honestly, it reminded me of when she lashed out that night.

I remember one night when I had finished extracting my blood and I had given the viles to Cindy. We were tucked in bed, about to sleep, but I had to use the bathroom. I told her I’d be right back. I did my business and was quiet returning to the bedroom. The door was cracked open slightly. I saw Cindy standing by her nightstand holding the vial I had just given her. She unscrewed the cap and smelled its contents. It wasn’t just a sniff, it was a deep inhale and exhale as if she were shopping for scented candles. I could’ve sworn she shuttered. If she did, she immediately stopped as I entered the room and asked her what she was doing.

“Making sure everything’s okay, you did a perfect job.”

She resealed them and shoved them back in her bag and into her nightstand.

Since she wasn’t going to tell me who this nurse was I decided to just find out myself. Cindy claimed that she would always drop my blood off at the nurses office during her commute to work. I did indeed watch her place the bag in the passenger seat before she left for work. It just occurred to me, I had never actually visited her at work. She hasn’t even told me what she did at work, who her work friends were, coworker gossip. 

That thought lingered with me as I kept my distance while tailing her. She pulled into the parking lot of an abandoned warehouse. It has no glass in its windows which unveiled the concrete pillars and exposed lumbar inside as I drove past them. The metal exterior is giving away to rust. 

What I’m saying is if a nurse operated out of here I would call the state medical board. Also a paint job is absolutely not going to fix this building's issues. So what the hell is she doing here? I watched her wait by the front door as it opened. Carl was already inside and had let her in. I’m pretty sure her friends aren’t also her coworkers. They never really mentioned what they do. All I know about them is that they hangout every week or so. Sometimes they go out and sometimes they’re at our apartment or one of theirs. 

I don’t know what it is they do when I’m gone, why Cindy is lying about work and potentially some nurse. It’s probably all bullshit. If that’s the case it's like she lives two different lives. I saw some comments on my previous post telling me to be wary of her friends, that she’s lying to me, and you’re probably all correct.  I’m gonna find out what they’re doing in this tetanus-ridden slab of concrete and metal, why she’s been lying to me, who she truly is. I need to know.
