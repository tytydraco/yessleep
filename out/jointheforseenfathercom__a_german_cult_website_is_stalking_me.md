Using a throwaway because I’m freaking out how I already messed up. Dark web weirdos can go to insane lengths to track you down—heard of people getting doxxed through triple VPNs, even burners getting pinged. This account’s on some dead Gmail I haven’t touched in years, so I’m hoping it’s safe. I don’t want them watching me over this post.

I’m from Tucson, Arizona. I’m not here for attention. I just need to get this off my chest before I lose it. I was on 4chan for like three months last year. Total newfag, hated the janky interface—quit in days. But I loved the anon thing though, privacy is good, during that time I lurked /tv/. Dropped a few comments here and there, nothing big, except this one time I mentioned my location when i said even though im from america i watched the german telly show anon was talking about. It was a thread about obscure tv shows I commented about watching some German show from the 2000s on my laptop. Said I found it on [jointheforseenfather.com](http://jointheforseenfather.com) .Don’t ask how I got that website—I don’t remember. Random forum link, maybe? Doesn’t matter. That’s where this started. Think I clicked a shady link from a forum or something, but it’s a blur. Point is, that’s where this started.

The site looked like some bootleg streaming page at first. Black background, grainy thumbnails, titles in broken English and German—“Der Stille Ruf” (The Silent Call), “Vater’s Blick” (Father’s Gaze). Thought it was some forgotten Euro TV archive. But the view counts? Every episode had 30k hits minimum, some closer to 50k. For a random 2000s German show? Sketchy as hell. I clicked one—episode 3 of “Schweigen der Lämmer” (not the movie, something else). Low-budget weirdness: empty fields, a hooded guy whispering in German about “the Father’s harvest,” close-ups of static flickering on a TV screen. Audio kept cutting to this buzzing hum that hurt my ears. Watched 10 minutes, then bailed. That was 4 years ago. A week after i commented, I got a DM on an old Discord I hadn’t touched in months. No text, just a link: jointheforseenfather.com/4839201. Clicked it (yeah, I’m dumb), and it loaded a new page. No videos, just a still from that episode—static with a faint outline of a face—and text: “Tucson sees. Father knows.” My heart sank. Only place I’d ever mentioned Tucson was that /tv/ post. Went back to check—the thread was archived, but my comment was gone. Not deleted, just… vanished. Started digging, VPN up, Tor running. Found an “About” page hidden in the source code—had to inspect element to see it. It’s in German, mentions a “Gemeinschaft der Stillen” (Community of the Silent) out of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Said they’ve been “watching since 1997” and “the Father speaks through the airwaves.” Linked to a dead .de domain, but Wayback Machine had a 2018 cache—same Latin phrase “Pater Videt Omnia” (Father Sees All) and a blurry pic of a radio tower in a forest. Then I found more sites. Three of them, all weird as hell:

* [silenceweave4839201.net](http://silenceweave4839201.net) \- Bio says “The threads bind the silent to the Father’s will.” Page is just a wall of base64 strings. Decoded one—it’s a German phrase: “Höre die Stille” (Hear the Silence).
* [vaterwacht4839201.org](http://vaterwacht4839201.org) \- Bio reads “The watchmen guard the flock under His gaze.” Has a guestbook with one entry from a user “StilleWacht”—comment says, “The signal hums at 3:17. Listen.” That timestamp stuck with me—3:17 AM is when my power flickered last night.
* [lambsrest4839201.com](http://lambsrest4839201.com) \- Bio: “Rest comes to those who heed the call.” It’s a single image of an old CRT screen, static with dots and dashes in the noise. Morse, maybe? I’m not smart enough to crack it.

Notice the URLs? All end in “4839201.” Same as the link I got. Coincidence? Doubt it. That username, StilleWacht, caught my eye too. Searched it on X—found a post from 2022: “StilleWacht knows the Father’s frequency. Check the airwaves.” Linked to a dead SoundCloud track titled “FF\_Signal\_317.” The comment under it, before it got nuked, said, “Heard it near Stuttgart. Hums like the end.” Then I hit r/ForeseenFlock. Same deal as the other anon—cryptic posts, “lambs” and “silence” everywhere. One thread mentioned “AZ watcher”—posted a blurry pic of a Tucson street sign near the U of A campus, 5 miles from me. Caption: “Father’s eyes are west.”

The main site’s got a new video up today—thumbnail’s a static screen with “Tucson” scratched into it. Haven’t clicked it. I’m not imagining this, right? It’s not just some ARG? Feels personal, like they’re zeroing in.
