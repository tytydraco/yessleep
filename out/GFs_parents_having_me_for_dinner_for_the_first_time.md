So me and my girlfriend Adrianna have been going strong for about seven months now, and I think she's perfect for me- so kind and beautiful and funny. I'd really love to marry her one day.
It might be a little too soon for that just now, but I really think that she's the one for me. However, one of the only problems with progressing our relationship further is that she doesn't have such a good relationship with her parents. They argue a lot. I hear them talking sometimes, lots of hushed shouting matches when she thinks I can't hear. From what l've heard, which isn't very much, is that they don't know if I'll be good for her because I don't take care of myself to their standards.

Adrianna comes from a very rich and uppity family, from what she's told me, and they all have certain ways of living which might seem strict to some people. For example, Adrianna is very very particular about her appearance and what she eats- she will only eat what her parents send her because of her allergies. It seems to be this mysterious white meat and lots and lots of salad and vegetables. I tried to ask her before what it was, but she only brushed me off and just said about her allergies again.

It was a little disheartening to hear her parents didn't think I'd be good enough for her, so I decided to start hitting the gym a little more and eating better. Not to brag, but I have started looking little more buff and I'm proud of how I look now.

As well as this, Adrianna's calls to her parents have become more frequent and she's become more secretive about them and more strict in her routines. It's kind of weird to see her like this, and she's become more detached from me by the day, not even using her typical pet names or showing affection like she used to. She's also eating more of that white meat her parents send her. I think she’s going through a rough patch and I want to be there for her.

Which is why it made me really happy when she finally talked to me like before and suggested that we go over to her parent's house for dinner; she was finally looking at me and talking to me more like before! She'd been cold towards me for weeks, so l enthusiastically said yes. As we were getting ready, she went to the bathroom to put some makeup on (she doesn't need it, she's beautiful already) and to also call her parents. I stood outside of the door and listened; I know I shouldn't have done that, but I was wondering if she would talk to her parents about acting weirder lately. I only caught the last part of it;

"...he's what you've been looking for! He's really lovely, you'll love him! He goes to the gym all the time now as well." She sounded... exasperated?

I didn't say anything about that phone call, but I was secretly a little happy that she was boasting about me to her parents. I always worried about if her parents would eventually like me, and I hope Adrianna's comments would help them to warm up to me. If anything, l'd say that they were overprotective and didn't want her getting hurt.

When we got to her parent's house, they opened the door and didn't look at or talk to Adrianna. She walked past them with a cold, clinical 'mother, father' and went straight to the dining room of their massive house. I followed behind her like a sheep and got a good look at her parents- I don't want to be rude to my future mother and father-in-law, but they just looked... wrong?

They had this tight-lipped, curled smile that pulled their face up in one broken motion, like they were straining their muscles, and they held themselves with such a tension that I thought that her Mother would fall over. Their small, narrowed eyes followed my every move as I trailed behind Adrianna; studying me, analysing me, eyes running over my arms, legs and stomach. I'm going to be honest, they creeped me out a little, but I didn't want to be rude, so I smiled back and greeted them warmly.

"Mr and Mrs Couteaux, it's wonderful to meet you! I'm so happy you invited me for dinner!"

They ignored me- same sour smile and analytic gaze over me. I put my hand out to shake Mr Couteaux's hand but he just watched my hand as I put it out. I dropped it and quickly followed Adrianna to the dining room.

The conversation was minimal, the only sound filling the room was the clink of my glass as it hit the table. It felt strange to be the only person drinking, as Adrianna herself didn't drink, called it 'poisonous'- but Adrianna's parents encouraged me, telling me about the rare, expensive aged French wine they got out of their cellar for this occasion. To be fair, it was nice- sweet on the palate, thick and smooth going down. I was about two glasses in when they brought out the food. My plate had the white meat Adrianna would always eat, but her and her parent's plates were empty.

I looked over at Adrianna to ask what was happening, but she looked ashen white and nauseous. I was about to ask her if she was alright when Mrs Couteaux exclaimed, rather loudly,

"PLEASE eat your food! We wouldn't want our guest to be hungry, would we Adrianna?" She shot her a pointed look.

"No Mother" gasped Adrianna, who wouldn't look me in the eyes.

l ate my food, not wanting to be rude. It had the texture of rubber, was extremely dry and chewy and tasted like pork, but didn't look like it. It was all so strange- Adrianna's parents watched me like hawks with every time the fork reached my lips. After finishing, Mr Couteaux slammed his palms into the dinner table, making me jump;

"Adrianna, why don't you show our guest to the cellar? I'm sure that he'd love to have another bottle of wine. It's a shame he finished the first one so fast."

As I was about to protest that no, l'd only had two glasses, Mr Couteaux grabbed the bottle and smashed it into the floor, thick red wine splattering into the lush white of the carpet. It looked like a crime scene.

Adrianna shot out of her seat and started to usher me out of the dining room and down the long corridor to the cellar. She had this wild, desperate look in her eyes, a look of regret.

"Are you ok, honey? You look sick-" I reached out to brush her hair out of her face when she slapped my hand away.

"Please... don't make this harder than it needs to be. I really liked you." Tears dotted the corners of her eyes as we reached the entrance of the cellar. I hadn't noticed before, but there was this foul smell emitting out of the cellar door that smelled like rotten fruit and animal carcasses. Adrianna opened the door and shoved me in, following behind me.

The cellar was like a meat locker. Carcasses were lined up on large hooks hanging from the ceiling, some flayed, some with pieces cut off, arms, legs, stomachs; I wanted to be sick. Pieces of the carcasses had been diced and stripped of fat, leaving just the white meat; put into small containers with names and dates scrawled on them in marker. I heard Adrianna start to sob behind me, as she grabbed a large plank of worn wood from beside the door and raised it over her head. Fat tears rolled down her cheeks as she swung the bat with all her might at the back of my head. The last thing I remember was the voice of Mr Coteaux;

"You've done nicely, Adrianna. He'll taste lovely."

Adrianna whispered apologies to me through hiccups as she dragged my half-conscious body through the cellar. I heard her mother and father talking to the chef, i could only hear murmurs but it was quiet and pointed whispers. I think they knew i was half awake. 

I passed out for quite a while, laying on the cold, damp floor. When i finally came to, i felt this hot rush of pain shoot down my leg. I looked down to see pieces of my flesh on my calves and thighs flayed off in chunks- they’d probably used that for hors d’œurves. It looked surgical though, everything was bandaged and stitched properly. I had most of my leg, but about half of my foot had been removed -only the stump remained. Maybe they’d keep me alive but cut me off in pieces, working their way up. Keeping the prime cuts until the very end. I hoped not.

I heard the door to the cellar creak open again, and the rush of dank air made my eyes water and my throat burn. I quickly rolled over- playing dead was the best solution in my eyes. Maybe if i pretended for long enough they’d think i was rotten and throw me out. To my surprise, i was rolled over by Adrianna- she’d obviously been crying, her eyes looked all puffy and red and she sniffled occasionally as she looked deep into my eyes, with an expression that could only be described as deep sorrow.

“I’m sorry. You have to get out of here. When you do, move as far away as you can- my parents will stop at nothing to find you. I always liked you better than the others.”

Before i could say anything, she bashed me over the head again, knocking me out cold this time.

I woke up again on the street outside of my apartment with a major headache. I hobbled upstairs and i’ve just been sat on my couch trying to process all of this. What do i do now?
