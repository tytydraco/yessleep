[\[Part 11\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1hg2han/the_call_of_the_breach_part_11/)

I slipped on a patch of mud and cursed under my breath. It wasn’t far to where my platoon had pitched their tents, but on my aching feet it seemed like miles.

“Ohio, make up your freaking mind.” I growled as I wiped a splatter of reddish-brown muck from my pants. “Either it’s winter, or it’s not. Freeze the mud solid, or warm up so we don’t need coats, just *pick one*.”

My day hadn’t ended the moment we evacuated from the captured depot. I’d spent hours getting wounded to the nearest medic station, helping apply first aid in some cases, and setting my platoon up in our next patrol base. On top of transporting, sorting, and storing the captured enemy supplies, I had to restock my own troops, check on ammunition, water, medical gear, and food. Our old trucks needed refueled before they were sent back to the rear units, as Chris decided to give all the armory-made pickup trucks to the recon platoons, now that the frontline units had captured enemy vehicles to use. As a result, Ethan had gone to great lengths to ensure each platoon leader knew the ins and outs of the coalition-built machines so that we could identify mechanical issues before they arose, while the militia men trained the Rhino units on the captured M1117 Armored Security Vehicles.

Compared to our simple pickup trucks, the ASV’s were futuristic spaceships, with enough buttons, toggle switches, and levers to make my head spin, not counting the 90mm gun turret that made them look like miniature tanks with wheels. While I envied their thicker armor, I didn’t mind sticking with the easy-to-use pickups I was familiar with, and the rest of 4^(th) platoon was simply overjoyed to finally have some protection between themselves and the enemy’s bullets. In the end, I counted nearly 18 hours since I’d last slept, and with only a few hours left until the next sunrise, I doubted I would get enough rest to make up for it.

*And somehow I have to be cognizant enough to navigate by map and protractor tomorrow. Man, that’s gonna suck. I would sell my left hand for a cup of expresso.*

Staggering toward my tent, I passed a line of kids with blaze orange armbands, a few sleepy-eyed guards with them as they unloaded the last of our trucks. They’d exchanged some of their old garb for whatever new clothing we could give them, but many stubbornly clung to their pirate roots, and sported a mix of 18^(th) century attire and 21^(st). Bandanas and tricorn hats, long coats with tails and knee-high boots, all of it looked comical if you didn’t know why on earth they dressed that way.

I did, however, and it left a melancholy feeling in my chest for the reminder of how dire the situation had become for little Barron County.

Peter caught my eye as I strode past, and he hefted the ammunition crate in his arms to throw me a courteous nod. “Evenin’ lass. A word?”

Wishing I could find a cot to collapse into, I forced myself to stop anyway. As first mate of the *Harper’s Vengeance*, Peter had played a key role in saving my life when the child-pirate crew ambushed Chris, Jamie, and I during our journey in the southlands. The forgotten children of Sunbright Orphanage had taken the replica schooner for themselves after mutants attacked their home and turned to a life of vicious crime on Maple Lake in order to survive. Led by the ruthless Captain Grapeshot Roberts, the crew had split when Peter convinced half of them to follow him northward in hopes of contacting New Wilderness to enlist our help in tracking down some of their lost crewmates. The offensive had put such efforts on the backburner, and as they were still criminals, Peter’s followers were put to work in non-combat roles. While many others were distrustful, or even downright hateful of the pirates, Peter and I shared something of a fraternal respect, as he’d been the one to help me in some of the darkest moments of my life. For my part, I had been the one to get him pardoned from his death sentence, and even if his faux Caribbean accent could be a bit much at times, I’d come to appreciate the self-made buccaneer.

“Care for a drop?” He produced a stainless-steel flask from the pockets of his double-buttoned Renafair coat and offered it to me.

*As if I need something else to knock me out.*

I shook my head at the strong scent of our home-brewed corn whiskey, likely bartered or pilfered from the market back in Ark River. “No thanks.”

He shrugged and downed a few gulps. Despite the majority of the pirates being shockingly young, their chosen lifestyle had enabled them to take on habits fit for older men, and they were some of the biggest purchasers of alcohol or tobacco products in our miniature economy. A few had been hooked on harder stuff before the mutiny, and these poor souls had to be kept at the fort due to the intensity of their withdrawal symptoms. One eleven-year-old girl had even died from it, and the Ark River women spent hours praying for her soul in the church. The kids of Sunbright had lived awful lives, both before and after the Breach, and seeing twelve-year-olds smoking while their older leaders drank themselves to death hurt my soul in ways I didn’t know possible. Peter himself was fifteen, but from how indifferently he reacted to violence or death, and how much he drank, anyone would have thought the boy was in his mid-twenties.

“Was wanting to talk to you.” He grunted and returned the flask to his pockets. “I know you’ve got a lot on yer plate, what with the war an all, but my boys didn’t get full rations the past few nights. Guards claimed the truck didn’t bring enough in for everyone. Now I’m seeing a lot of food coming off these rigs, so I’m hoping you’ll make sure we get our due, yeah?”

Glad to be presented with something simple, I rubbed at my eyes and nodded. “I’ll see to it first thing, and let Chris know so it doesn’t happen again. If they try to pull anything tonight, you come get me. There’s more than enough, so there should be no reason not to feed you guys.”

His face brightened, and Peter slapped me on the arm with pleased comradery. “Knew I could count on ya. Sure you don’t want any grog? You look like shit.”

*Nothing like an honest pirate to keep you humble.*

I couldn’t help but let slide a grin at the mischievous glint in his eye. “I feel like it. But I’ll pass. Unless you’ve got a magic potion that can grant me eight hours of sleep somewhere in that overcoat.”

“If only.” Peter’s face took on a more serious contemplation, and he made a sad nod at the hills to our rear. “Heard it was bad out there today. You lose many boys?”

My chest tightened, and the memory of the machine guns mowing down two of my platoon flashed through my mind as fresh as if I were living it all over again. “A few.”

Our eyes met, and in Peter’s dark irises, I saw his sympathy. “Well, I know what the big shots say, but if you ever need any strong lads who know their way around a gun . . .”

“Not my call, unfortunately. But I appreciate it. I’ll check by in the morning, okay?” With that, I gave him a parting wave and slogged onward.

I found my tent at last and ducked inside the canvas flap with a sigh of relief. The square metal stove emitted faint orange-red light from the ventilation slits in its tiny door, the fire reduced to coals after Lucille had started it for me some time ago. Outside, the wind rustled the rubber-coated canvas with moderate force and howled in the trees to beckon the approach of a cold front. Hushed patters on the sloped roof told me a light snowfall followed on the breeze, one that wouldn’t stick past the morning sunlight, but an ominous sign nonetheless.

Plunking down on a stool next to the stove, I sucked in another breath to taste salty woodsmoke, and the cold humidity that put a bite to the air. My wristwatch said it was 3:30 in the morning, and a scratched plastic thermometer I’d bartered for in the market showed the room to be a crisp 32 degrees. My chest seemed heavy, the weight of sleep deprivation like an elephant on my ribcage and moving took more effort than usual. I hadn’t stayed up this long ever before in my life, with so little rest that my vision sometimes blurred, and I wondered if a person could die from such things.

Bracing myself against the rush of cold air that threatened to break in from outside, I unbuckled my war belt and set my Type 9 against my cot. Three more of the split chunks of hickory that sat in a pile went into the firebox, and I stirred the throbbing red coals with a poker made from welded rebar. Yellow flames came to life over the dried wood, licked their way across the bark, and glorious heat swelled around the sheet steel box.

*All those years just turning up the thermostat at home whenever I wanted . . . I had no idea how good I had it.*

Doing my best not to think about Louisville, I wound a wool blanket around myself, and an object on the small folding desk caught my eye.

Like a herald of death, the book waited for me, ugly and rough in the dancing shadows of the firelight, right where I’d left it atop the uneven pine grain. I hated to look at it, despised how the thing made my skin wriggle in foreign ways, but at this point I had nothing else to do. With Jamie’s fate sealed, and Vecitorak still outside my grasp, this was the closest I could get in terms of making a difference.

Pushing my exhaustion away, I shuffled over to the desk and peeled open the musty pages. I suppressed a shudder at the odd way they crackled under my fingertips and squinted at the bloody inscriptions.

At first, they seemed only a jumbled mess, but as I let *the focus* slide into place over my senses, the scribbling unraveled in front of me like a pile of crimson snakes.

*She resists me, but her strength is failing. I will break her as a twig in the wind and unshackle the Master from her spirit so that our glorious conquest may begin. I will scrape clean her mind, cut open her heart, and devour her soul. She begs me to let her go, but there is no escape. She is one with our Master. She is bound to our fate.*

My skin prickled with the sensation of a thousand invisible insect legs, the blood ran cold in my veins, and I fought a wave of nausea. What was this? Vecitorak wrote of someone in his keeping, and from the sounds of it, he was torturing her. Could this have been written about me, when I lay dying from his stab wound in New Wilderness?

Unsettled, but too curious to stop, I turned the page and read on.

*The vines grow, the roots burrow, but still, her spirit persists. I admire her struggle, though it is futile. She cannot move now, cannot scream, yet her cries continue in my mind. I hear her soul pleading for an end, but the time is not yet come. I must detach the Nameless One from her, before I can rend her soul from the weak body this world has made.*

The contents of my stomach turned over in horror, but I furrowed my brow at the odd passage. It certainly sounded like what I’d endured in the ELSAR laboratory during my healing, but what was this about the ‘Nameless One’ being connected to me? What did that mean?

I tugged the book closer and flipped the next mold-crusted page.

*Her spirit lingers, even as the branches pry from her sockets, sprouts from her mouth, the bark covering her skin. She shrieks a name, over and over, one from memories I’ve used to break her time and again, but now it seems her shattered mind is using it as a shield. The Master grows impatient, our hour grows near, yet I cannot loose the Nameless One from this rotted husk. She will not hinder me from my destiny. I will drown her spirit with an ocean of blood if I must.*

In my throat, a sour lump rose, and I hugged the gray surplus blanket closer around both shoulders as the wind whipped the tent anew. This didn’t seem right. My infection had been bad, but never to the point that branches came out of both eyes, or sprouts from my mouth. I couldn’t remember screaming any name, either in my head or otherwise during the ordeal. Could he be speaking about someone else?

I scratched at the silver tattoos on my arm and read on.

*I see it all now. I cracked open her memories like a rotted egg, dug through the shattered remnants of her thoughts, and found the truth. An ancient power protects her soul, guards her from the call of the void, even though her body and mind are beyond repair. Somehow, this power burns inside her, like a flame I cannot snuff out, one that even drowns out the voice of the Nameless One at times. In the few instances I’ve tried to challenge it, such painful light clouds my mind’s eye that I fear I might perish altogether. She knows not of this; always the girl weeps in my own mind, screams, shouts the name of the one who dared stand against our Master, as if he will rise from death to save her. This too is not by accident; her soul longs for a kindred spirit, another who can release her from the embrace of the Sacred Grove. If I can find this spirit, then I can banish the girl’s soul from the Master’s form, and my service will at last be complete. This ancient power will not stand in my way . . . nothing will.*

The next page over contained not letters but a series of drawings, inked in bold, thick strokes. One of the pictures I recognized as the jagged wooden dagger Vecitorak had stabbed me with, black as night, its handle wrapped in some kind of rotted cordage. Something about the way the knife stood central on the page, ringed by strange runes and symbols, caught my interest. It almost seemed to be given a reverent aura all its own, as if the crude weapon was the only thing in Vecitorak’s existence that he truly cherished. Considering its use in turning men to mutants, I couldn’t argue his devotion but given all the talk of resurrecting some dark entity, it occurred to me that the knife was more than a tool to recruit mutants; it was key to Vecitorak’s mission.

As my hand flipped the next page, I noticed the image sketched there in hazy red ink, and my heart failed to beat for a few horrid moments.

*Mother of God.*

Scrawled in the same rusty-red ‘ink’ as the rest of the diary, a dark forest opened up to a marshy area, with tall grass across the cleared section. Dark clouds were interlaced with streaks of lightning, and even though the picture didn’t move, I could almost hear the thunder in the back of my mind. A lone building stood in the center of the picture, some kind of half-destroyed industrial tower with gaping holes in its cement sides, a mound of broken logs piled almost three-quarters of the way up the right side of it.

No, not logs.

A body.

Gargantuan in size, it could have stood twice as tall as the nearby pines if it were upright, with a strange, jagged head in the shape of an upside-down triangle. Twigs grew from the top of it like a crown, and the hands on each of its long arms bore only four fingers that ended in similar leafless sprouts. The feet of the being were rounded like an elephant’s, with short roots that extended outward similar to toes, but the skin seemed to be made of a multitude of interwoven roots that had a drab pallor. It had no facial features, the slumped head merely a vast plain of intwined vines, roots, and branches. Despite this, I couldn’t help but feel a tight fist of panic close over my brain. I knew this creature, had seen a drawing of it once before, locked away in Dr. O’Brian’s office.

*‘A creature so intelligent, so powerful, that it could bend the forces of the void to its will and create minions to do its bidding.’*

The traitor’s voice rose in my head with haunting clarity, and I dared to breathe the name out loud as the wind raged against my tent’s canvas walls in arcane knowledge. “Oak Walker.”

This one, however, did not tower above the trees like some dark preacher with its hands held wide in authority over worshiping crowds of Puppets. Instead, it lay with its back to the old tower, some of its body shaded as if burnt, with chunks of twig missing from its crown. The head of the being had been torn open by something, half of the upper section missing, and from the soot marks on the edges of the gaping hole, I thought it almost looked like an explosion. Wild vines flowed from its corpse, snaking up the walls of the dilapidated tower, and a thicket of bushes grew around its limp form like a protective wall. A raised lump of vines over its torso almost resembled a tumor, with a split down the middle like a narrow passage into the creature’s chest cavity. No other creatures were visible in this sketch, but even from the unmoving nature of the picture I had the feeling there were swarms of eyes on it always.

“So, it really did exist.” Too intrigued to go back to bed, I flexed the cold toes in my socks to stave off the cold.

To my disappointment, the next pages were blank, as if Vecitorak had given up writing in it before he’d passed the book on to me. Without his spider-scratch words to go by, I was left to slump in my camp chair with puzzled unease. What was the point of all this? Why reveal his plan, and why now? Had the supposed ‘resurrection’ already been accomplished? If so, why wasn’t the Oak Walker stomping out of the trees to kill us all?

A breeze from outside turned the last page over in a flutter, and something glinted in the stove light.

My curiosity peaked, and I leaned forward to gasp in awe.

The necklace lay secured to a thicker section of pages stitched together by rough vine-like cordage, its harder edges leaving an indentation on the paper around it. It was a simple bit of jewelry, a silver chain with a piece of turquoise wrapped in silver settings at the end of it. Written below it was a single line of text, but the words were different, graceful and smooth, etched in a silvery ink that almost glowed in the firelight.

“What binds must also free.” I muttered, tracing the line with my forefinger. This didn’t look like Vecitorak’s handwriting. The perfect swirls and lines of each letter didn’t ooze the vitriol, rage, and malic that the red scratch ones did.

I dared to touch the ink, and the itching in my scars ceased, the anxious tension in my chest easing. Out of the folds of my memory, a pair of silver irises emerged, looking down from behind a gas mask as I was carried through ashy fog.

*“Who are you?”* My own words echoed in my head.

*“A friend.”* The gentle baritone voice replied.

*Thunk.*

Startled, I looked up from my musings to see the outline of a shadow just beyond my tent flap. It was human, that much I knew for sure, but they stood completely still, in silent wait. Even in the dark of night, I could discern their face pressed to the fabric of my tent, staring at my shadow with shameless intensity.

Something about the motionless outline made my pulse quicken, and I reached instinctively for my submachine gun.

*Wham.*

In a blur of motion, the figure threw itself between the tent flaps and tackled me to the floor.

My head bounced off the cold ground, and I struggled to keep the hands of my attacker off my neck. I couldn’t scream, couldn’t call out, the wind knocked out of me by the heavy figure on my chest. The Type 9 lay not far away, but I couldn’t reach it, and my war belt swung on a hook in the central tent pole.

On top of my ribs, the figure snapped and snarled with animalistic rage, teeth bared, and flecks of hot saliva speckled my face as he forced my arms back. Even with my enhanced senses thanks to the mutation, I still bore the physical strength of my old self, and this boy, for I could see now that it was a young man close to my age, easily outweighed me.

*Thwack.*

All at once the figure lurched to the floor, and I blinked up at Peter, who brandished a long stick of firewood in his hands. Two of his fellow pirates flanked him, armed in a similar fashion, and they gave the prostrate attacker a few more swings and kicks for good measure.

“Saw him walking funny toward your tent, and thought we’d take a peek.” Peter gave me a hand up, and frowned at the unconscious boy on my floor, his eyes traveling to the desk, the book, and the necklace in suspicion. “Seems he wasn’t here for a fireside chat. Isn’t he one of yours?”

Rubbing the back of my head, I glanced down and saw to my horror that he was. Trevor lay with both eyes open in a strange, glazed, stare. I realized he wasn’t unconscious at all, merely unmoving, and he watched me with an inhuman blankness to his face. He showed no registration of the pain from Peter’s club, no fear, hate, or aggression. In fact, the longer I peered into the void of Trevor’s gaze, the more my scars itched in uncanny recognition.

*I know that look.*

In a jolt, Trevor leapt to his feet and lunged for my desk.

My hand made it to the book before Trevor’s could, and I accidentally tore the page with the necklace out in my desperate bid to keep his hands off it. The odd parchment shredded in an organic fashion that reminded me of thin leather, releasing a musty stench inside the tent that made my nostrils recoil.

Without regard for his own self-preservation, Trevor crashed into my desk face-first, clumsy and primitive, like an animal released from his cage.

Peter jumped in front of him and blocked his clawed hand with another furious swipe of his club. “Stay down, you crazy fool.”

Unafraid, Trevor hissed at him, clacking his teeth in a way no human should ever do, and shoved past the other two pirates. Ignoring their fervent club swings, he darted into the night with a high shriek that made images of rain, trees, and a long gravel road flash through the murky depths of my mind.

“Stop him!” I snatched up the book and slung the Type 9 over my shoulder with frenzied hands. “We can’t let him get to the trees!”

As we burst from the tent, I caught sight of Trevor sprinting down the line, his gait strange and unnatural, as though he wasn’t used to using two legs. Confident in my stride, I took off after him, the pirates right behind me.

“Get everyone up!” Peter shouted over one shoulder to his men, who turned for the other tents in breathless urgency. “Get every hand on the firing line, quick as you can! Light the torches, go!”

My pace quickened, and I drew away from Peter as we neared the perimeter, where long rows of coiled barbed wire stood between us and the dark forest. Foxholes had been dug every so often, reinforced with logs for cover, but the stretch I ran for was in between the emplacements, where I noticed Trevor slow to a swaying stop in front of the wire.

Heart pounding, cold air stinging my lungs, I unslung my submachine gun and approached him from behind. “Trevor?”

The boy twitched, his lips moving in a silent mantra that I couldn’t pick up even with my superior hearing, both listless eyes focused on the shadows beyond.

Close enough to put my hand out, I settled one palm on his shoulder, the muzzle of my weapon pointed at his back. I didn’t want to pull the trigger. Trevor was the platoon comedian, an upbeat, funny guy, barely nineteen by a few days. He loved cheddar cheese and was one of my best marksmen, a hero to many of the younger fighters who flocked to him in the training yard.

*Please just wake up and be okay, don’t make me do this, don’t . . .*

“He can’t hear you, Hannah.”

My pulse screeched to a stop, every muscle in my body turned to stone, and I watched a familiar hooded shadow emerge from the woods at the edge of our barbed wire defenses.

Even from where I stood, I could almost smell his rotted breath, heard the flies swarming over his pallid skin beneath the robes, and felt the already frigid air grow colder. In the trees behind him, more figures inched closer, their fish-white eyes gleaming with anticipation, unnatural smiles wide as they gripped their primitive edged weapons. There were dozens of them, gray skinned fiends crouched just out of sight, waiting for the command to strike. It seemed none of the other sentries had spotted them yet, but I knew help was on the way, thanks to Peter’s men. We just had to stall for a few more minutes.

“*You*.” Peter dropped the stick of firewood and reached for one of the flintlock replica pistols that hung from his belt. In payment for breaking the siege at New Wilderness, he had been allowed to retain his personal weapons and was the only pirate given such privilege. Though he wore modern handguns as well as old, it seemed the inner pirate in him preferred the heavy-bore flintlocks, but I knew as well as he did that it was a worthless gesture.

“How amusing.” Vecitorak sneered at his drawn weapon and cocked his moldy head to one side. “Do you really think a scrap of metal can bring me down? You are an ant under my boot, a pebble before the tide; nothing you can do will prevent the inevitable.”

*Click.*

Peter thumbed the lock back on his ancient weapon anyway and leveled the long barrel at Vecitorak’s hood. “Fancy words for someone who ran like a scurvy dog last time we met.”

*Don’t antagonize him, you don’t know what he’s capable of.*

As if he could read my mind, Vecitorak ignored Peter’s gun, and turned to me. “Is that what you want, Hannah? Did you forget what happened to your friends the last time we crossed paths? You wouldn’t want more of them to end up like dear Jamie, now would you?”

My brain filled with alarm bells, and I almost vomited at his words. “You’re lying, you don’t have her.”

“No.” Bones popped in their sockets as Vecitorak lifted one arm and swept the moldy poncho aside. “But I do have this one.”

With the same ease as someone holding a dead rabbit, he displayed a struggling uniformed silhouette in the torchlight for me to see. His decayed fingers clamped down around the girl’s sheet-white throat, and I glimpsed the flash of red hair, her frightened chestnut-brown eyes, and the sentry’s boots kicked in desperate attempt to wriggle loose.

Peter’s face lost its smirk, and I had to clap one hand to my mouth to stop from screaming.

*No.*

Lucille’s eyes flicked to me, and she made small choking noises, her fingers clawing at Vecitorak’s iron grasp to no avail.

Lifting my Type 9, I flicked the safety off and spat the words between furious clenched teeth. “Let her go.”

Refusing to give Lucille even the slightest respite, Vecitorak leaned forward, the two of us mere feet apart with the wire between, and his gravelly voice turned hateful. “*Give it back*.”

*The book.*

Stunned, I lost my voice for a few seconds, mind swirling in confusion. If he would go to such length to retrieve the putrid clump of pages, then it meant I’d gotten it all wrong. Vecitorak wanted it back, *needed* it, which could only mean someone had managed to steal it from him. If that were true, I couldn’t hand the book over, not if what I’d read about resurrecting the Oak Walker relied on it. This could mean the difference between saving our world or losing it all, but Lucille’s life was on the line.

Playing dumb, I tried to shake my head, and hoped the roaming sentries would come along any moment now. “I don’t know what you—”

“Don’t be coy with me, you filthy little thief!” His rage boiled forth like a cascade of hot tar, and Vecitorak clenched a skeletal fist at me, while Lucille’s eyes screwed shut in pain as his other hand tightened on her esophagus. “If I have to pry it from your blasphemous fingers while you scream for death, I will. Give it back, *now*.”

“If I give it to you,” I nodded at his cloak, hearing shouts echo in the camp, and boots thudded over the grass towards us from all directions. “You’ll let her go, and leave the rest of us in peace?”

“This whelp means nothing to me.” He shook Lucille so hard that it made her teeth rattle. “Her time will come, the same as the rest of your kind. Whether it is today, all depends on you.”

Watching Lucille’s red face get worse, her limbs slowing as suffocation neared, I gnawed at my lower lip until it bled.

*I can’t give it to him . . . but if he takes her . . . I can’t stand it, I just can’t.*

Fighting a wave of anxious nausea, I walked to the edge of the barbed wire coils and held out the book. “Leave her unharmed, and it’s yours.”

As soon as his gray fingers closed around the cover of his macabre journal, Vecitorak hurled Lucille into the camp.

She landed on the muddy ground with a *splat,* and Lucille coughed as fresh air flowed back into her lungs. “I-I’m sorry, Hannah . . . I didn’t see him, I didn’t know . . .”

“It’s okay.” I pushed her into Peter’s arms, eager to get Lucille as far from Vecitorak’s reach as possible.

“She’s fortunate. The Master didn’t call her.” Vecitorak slid the book into his robes, and studied me with renewed focus. “It seems we’ll have to look elsewhere.”

Static fuzzed in my ear at his intense stare, and my legs shook, an icy blade of fear thrust into my psyche. He could have stormed the compound, I realized. He could have slaughtered most of us before the flamethrowers pushed his forces back. Vecitorak didn’t have to negotiate for the book; he’d obviously tried to avoid negotiation by sending Trevor to steal it. So now that he had it back, had no more hostages, why not attack?

Simple; there was still something valuable to him within the wire.

Or rather, someone.

“For what?” I stood between him and Lucille, desperate to learn something, anything, now that my only source of intelligence on his plans was gone.

Vecitorak’s head bobbed as he looked me up and down, and something in his gravelly tone sparked with malice. “In eight days, when the moon reaches its zenith, you will join me in the sacred grove and see for yourself.”

“And why would we do that?” Peter wrapped his coat around Lucille’s shoulders and stood to join me as our troopers advanced around us, their weapons raised, eyes wide in terror at what they saw.

Unphased by the growing number of rifles trained on him, Vecitorak swept aside a fold of his poncho, and from the dark, brought forth a vine-entangled bundle. It stood about four feet tall, and as it seemed to almost float out of the mass of his decayed clothing, a partition appeared in the oily tendrils.

*Oh God please let this be a bad dream, please let it be a bad dream, please.*

Tarren didn’t move, though her little chest rose and fell under the grimy T shirt she wore, its shooting star now stained black by the vines. Her skin was a clammy white, the roots slithering through her brown tufts of hair like worms, under her clothes, and around her limbs in a constant flow of greasy black rot. How long she’d been like this, caught in some form of stasis, unlike the other Puppets in Vecitorak’s army, I didn’t know. Trapped in the vines, Tarren couldn’t have done anything even if she had opened her little eyes, and in short order the growth swept back over her face to drag the eight-year-old back into the abyss of her nightmarish captivity.

Crimson rage flooded Peter’s thin cheeks, and he charged to the edge of the wire, his pistol shaking in his white-knuckled fist. “I’ll rip you limb from limb you mutant fu—”

“You’ll do no such thing.” Vecitorak snorted at him, and Peter’s advance was met with a forest of crude spearheads leveled from within the trees, each poised to strike him down, the countless Puppets in the dark willing to die for their priest. “If you want the girl returned, then you’ll do as I say. Eight days, in the Sacred Grove, or the girl dies.”

Finding himself helpless for once, Peter backed toward me, and I saw the pleading heartache in his countenance. Tarren had been one of the youngest of the pirate crew, protected and babied by both Peter and Captain Grapeshot. She hadn’t succumbed to cruelty or vice, and in some ways Tarren was the last shred of light the pirates had, their final grasp on humanity. She was their little sister, and they would do anything to get her back.

*Even if it means hunting Vecitorak to the ends of the earth.*

“How do I find it?” I lowered my Type 9 and motioned for the other soldiers to do the same.

Vecitorak laughed, a cruel, cold sneer. “As if you didn’t already know. Enough games, thief. Eight days, at the full moon, when the storm shakes the stones . . . or the girl is mine forever.”

With that, he melted into the shadows along with his silent army of cheshire-grin freaks, leaving me with a sickness in my stomach. The other lieutenants were around me, asking questions, barking orders to their men as the defensive line came to life in preparation of an attack that wouldn’t come. I could only stand there, frozen to the spot, needles of terror in my heart as the words repeated on a loop in my mind.

*Eight days.*
