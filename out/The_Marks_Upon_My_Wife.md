Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening,

I am writing to seek advice from a crevice of the internet I wouldn’t usually frequent. A troubling incident has occurred involving my wife, you see, and conventional answers aren’t providing any sort of reassurance for myself or the members of my household. I’ve relayed the details to the butler, the nanny, the family doctor, the head groundsman, and of course, the gamekeeper. We’re all equally perplexed. 

I then sought to broach the subject with a series of trusted gentlemen at the masonic hall I attend. The smoke from our cigars was clouding the room, but I could see their frowns and their distasteful looks as I told them what had happened. They all think I’ve gone barking mad.

Now, I understand that there are guidelines one must adhere to when sharing an experience here–which is quite alright. That suits my needs entirely and isn’t dissimilar to the way in which the private members’ clubs I’m associated with operate. Suffice to say, my wife and I are a degree of separation away from several members of the House of Lords, various earls and barons, and even the King himself. As I hope you will understand, anonymity is of paramount importance for reputational reasons.

My uncle, my godfather and I were out hunting on the edge of my estate, where a stream snakes its way between willows, when we happened upon the body of Sasha, my best foxhound. We hunkered down beneath the boughs and I summoned the gamekeeper, who wasn’t far away at the time. Poor Sasha had been ravaged by hundreds of tiny u-shaped bites, not more than a centimetre in diameter each. The punctures were deep so there was a lot of blood, but Sasha looked most serene, lying there beside the water. It simply looked like he had gone to sleep. I was rather distressed and laid my handkerchief across Sasha’s eyes. I ordered the gamekeeper to bury him, but not before the head groundsman could examine the corpse to identify the perpetrator. 

Standing by an open grave in the house's shadow, the groundsman said he’d seen nothing like it. It was foxes we’d been after, naturally, so could a fox have done this in self defence?

“No. This isn’t the work of a fox. Bites are too small,” the groundsman said, his usually red face drained of colour.

“Rats? Rabid rats?” I offered.

“Has to have been a pack of something, sir. Did you hear anything?” 

I shook my head, frustrated by his uncertainty and lack of suggestions.

“Who the devil did this? A mob of extraterrestrial killer arachnids?” I asked, joking, yet moderately disquieted. It didn’t help that the old man simply tucked his thumbs into his corduroy trousers and stared at me. I left him there in the cold mist to bury Sasha and went into the house. 

My wife is not an intensely gregarious lady, however she likes company, and always has a witticism on hand to lighten the room. Croquet and reading are her chief passions, and she’s scarce to be found without some activity or another occupying her. Whether that’s briefing the butler on what to prepare for an upcoming afternoon tea, playing with our children or taking a sack full of apples out to feed the horses. 

Therefore, I was troubled when I found her reclining on the chaise longue in the drawing room, staring out of the window. The view is magnificent–all manicured hedges, statues and a marble water fountain–but she wasn’t really looking at those things, nor was she transfixed by the lawns beyond, which disappeared into the fog. The room was unlit, and rather chilly, and she was wearing a thin, silk nightgown. I called her name from beside the billiard table and she didn’t respond. I repeated myself and slowly, her head turned.

“Everything alright, my dear?” I said.

Eyes glassy and far away, she responded. “Yes, and it always will be.”

“Rather philosophical,” I replied, in good humour, but she made no further comment and instead turned to look back out of the window. 

I wandered across the courtyard to the nursery, and untangling myself from children who burst free from the nanny’s grip at the sight of me, I asked her if my wife had spoken to her recently. Had she expressed any discomfort?

“I spoke to her just this morning, sir. She seemed quite normal then,” she said, ushering my children out of our way. Stepping forward, she suddenly became solemn, and lowered her voice. 

“I’m awfully sorry about Sasha, sir. I know how dear he was to you. My condolences.”

I waved a hand at her and went to interrogate the butler, who told me that my wife had been busy in the study going over the accounts while I’d been out hunting that morning. She’d appeared perfectly diligent and present.

I decided to let the matter be, and keep a watchful eye on her. Days went by, and slowly but surely, the nanny and the butler came to see what I meant about her demeanour and energy. She was reticent and reserved. Unbothered by changes in temperature, she spent her time on the chaise longue wearing only her nightgown and staring into space. She’d drift up to our bedroom suite after midnight, making barely a sound, and she’d be the first to rise, taking her place by the drawing-room window. It seemed like my wife was becoming a ghost. Passing inexorably from this world to the next.

I had the family doctor look her over, and he said that her vital signs were fine. Splendid, even. Standing over where she was reclining, we conversed as though she wasn’t there. 

“The only thing worthy of note here, sir, is a small cluster of u-shaped puncture marks on her lower calf.” 

I froze.

“Pardon?”

The doctor gestured at the hem of her nightgown. “If I may,” he said, and I nodded.

The doctor lifted the fabric, revealing a string of bite marks that climbed from her ankle halfway up her calf. The bites were exactly the same as what I’d seen on Sasha. My mouth bobbed open and closed as I stared at my wife’s expression. There was a somewhat wistful quality to it. A pensive vacancy, as though her human essence was braying on her skin, demanding to be released but remaining unheard. 

I took it upon myself that evening to venture out to the spot where we’d found Sasha. Owls were hooting and the moon was full. The stream babbled and willow branches soughed. I kicked at the earth. Crouched. Rubbed a pinch of dirt between finger and thumb. A crow cawed and took wing, startling me. I turned towards the bank of the stream and saw movement. There was a black mass. An amorphous void–distinct from the natural darkness of the night. It swayed and slithered towards me across the mud, frighteningly fast. A soft sound, much like the friction of tweed rubbing together, accompanied its movement. It paused several yards from where I stood, petrified. I felt an alien gaze regard me. Time stood still.

Then it advanced. 

“Blast you!” I said, throwing my torch at it and turning to run. My wellington boot slipped in the damp mud and I went down onto my hands and knees. I felt a weight fall on my back foot, encasing it. Thrashing my leg and stumbling further, my foot came free of the boot and I ran as fast as I could back to the house, half-crazed and hysterical. I dived into my children’s wendy-house and checked for any sign of pursuit, but there was none. My foot was free of bite marks, thank goodness.

I had the groundsman pull together a team to scour the area the next day, armed with rifles. They recovered my boot from the stream, undamaged, and returned it to me. I asked him to search the area again, and he agreed, but not without a measure of doubt crossing his face. I’ve avoided the hunting grounds since then, but I haven’t been idle. I’m still trying to find answers about what happened to Sasha, and what is continuing to happen to my wife.

Her symptoms haven’t changed since the day I went hunting with my uncle and godfather. Since I found poor Sasha over by the willows. No further marks have appeared on my wife’s body, but she hasn’t returned to anything remotely like good health. This is becoming more of a problem as time passes because there are only so many gala invitations that I can reject before people start to question our retreat from society. We have reputations to uphold!

My peers have snubbed me. They prefer to turn away, cognac in hand, when I arrive at our meetings. I fear this could be the beginning of our expulsion from the lofty echelons of society that we presently occupy. And what a terrible shame that would be! Therefore, I beseech you, good people of r/nosleep, to help me decide what to do next.

Fondest regards.
