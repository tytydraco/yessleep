As the rain fell, the tentacles of the monsters seemed to quiver faster, vibrating with barely concealed pleasure. Their faces were all turned up to the sky, the drops falling into their deformed, mutated mouths.

A voice came from nearby, whispering. It was the voice of the robed man who I had seen in the beginning- the one with black eyes and a sickly body, like that of a cancer patient in his last days. The voice split and echoed in the quiet forest.

“You have been betrayed,” he said. “Right now, Dr. Lao is giving Dr. Booth intravenous injections of the royal jelly. He has been brought back to life with high doses of the serum, and will become the leader of the hive- the king of the monsters.”

“What?” I whispered, turning and looking. The voice seemed to come from behind a cluster of trees, but I was afraid to move too close to it. It would potentially allow the group of the mutated monsters to see me. The rain soaked into my clothes, my backpack and my supplies. I wished I still had my shotgun, which I was far more familiar with, but all I had was a pistol with no extra magazines.

“Did you hear that?” I said, turning to my wife and daughter. They both nodded.

“Why is that man’s voice so weird, daddy?” Sarah said. She seemed to be recovering well from the shock. The resiliency of children is something miraculous. She had seen people murdered in front of her eyes and had a gun held to her head. Her eyes had lost some of the innocence they had earlier today. They looked flat and emotionless. I went to her and hugged her.

“Don’t worry, baby,” I said. “He is on our side. He is the one who killed the bad people in our home earlier.” She hugged me back, her tiny arms wrapping around my neck. I kissed her on her forehead, brushing dirty, wet strands of hair out of her face. And yet I wondered how true my statement really was. What was this being? A demon? And whose side was he really on?

“So what do you want to do now?” Beth asked. I looked up at her.

“Well, as far as I see it, we have three choices. We can go back to the laboratory and deal with the scientists there, which seems like a terrible option. I don’t even know how to get back to where we were originally. The place is like a labyrinth.

“We can try to hike our way out of here to the nearest town. Or we can find somewhere to hide and wait for the military to come in- if they’re actually coming at all. Assuming they just don’t just shoot us on sight.” Beth shook her head.

“We can’t count on the government,” she said. “What if they just quarantine this whole area, or drop a nuclear bomb or chemical weapons on it to wipe it out?”

“Yeah, my thoughts exactly,” I said. “So we can either go forward, or go back. If Dr. Lao is giving people that royal jelly, whatever kind of serum comes out of these creatures, then she could be creating whole armies of these things. I really thought she might be on our side.” I sighed. “That means Dr. Booth has resurrected, far stronger than before, and with a whole hive behind him. He will be like X, or even worse. I don’t know if it is dose-dependent, but if she has stockpiles of pure royal jelly, then I think we should count on that. Dr. Booth might become some sort of sick leader. He is, after all, one of the most intelligent- and the most insane and psychopathic.”

“I just don’t understand why she would do that,” Beth said, shaking her head. I shrugged. She sighed heavily. “I think we need to go back.” She pulled the pistol she had taken from Dr. Booth from her waistband. “And I think we may need to stop Dr. Lao before she can do anything else.” However, the decision was taken away from us. On the top of the nearest hill, I saw a silhouette of a man walking casually. Tendrils whipped crazily around his body and head.

I squinted. Beth and Sarah both looked too. Beth had better eyesight than me.

“Get back behind the trees,” Beth hissed at us. I grabbed Sarah, hiding behind an oak tree. I looked over at the group of monsters as well. They had stopped, standing still as statues, watching the approaching man. Only their tentacles vibrated and shimmered still. X stood in the lead, welcoming the leader home to his hive.

I heard the mutated, gurgling voice of Dr. Booth as he hailed them.

“I have seen death, coming on a pale horse,” he shrieked. “What horrors await us on the other side of the veil. And yet, we have conquered death. The Overman am I, like lightning from the sky. I appear and ask you to join me. We will take the world- remake it greater and more beautiful than before, and exterminate all who stand in our way.” The hive buzzed with excitement, the eyes of the mutated humans shining with glee. I peeked out from behind the tree, and when I saw the mutated form of Dr. Booth, I gasped.

His clothes hung in tatters around his body. His legs and arms had stretched to enormous lengths. He looked like he was twice as tall as a normal man now, his arms stretching far below his knees. The place where I had shot him had regrown gray, pulsating flesh. Blood dripped from his eyes like crimson tears. His mouth hung down like a snake’s, unhinging and allowing red and gray tendrils to squirm around him as he spoke.

The hive moved apart, letting him into the center, welcoming their king. I saw black and purple bruises all over his torso and neck. He coughed, a grating sound that sprayed frothy blood onto the ground. Cold chills ran down my spine.

“We have live ones here,” Dr. Booth said, scanning the others. “I think they’re in this forest. I think they may even be watching us right now. Bring them, as sacrifices for the transition to the next stage of humanity. Bring them- as food for us. We will drink their blood and tear them limb from limb. Save the little girl for me.”

The hive began to scatter, the group dissolving as dozens of mutated people moved in all different directions. Dr. Booth stayed where he was, head bowed, looking like a man in prayer. Other than the whipping tendrils and vines emanating from his ruined body, he stood as still as a mannequin. I wondered if he was communing with the greater hive of the town, sending out telepathic messages to the countless mutated animals and humans.

“Oh God,” Beth whispered, grabbing my arm. “What do we do now? They’re coming.” My heart was beating in my chest so hard that I feared the hive would hear it. I was breathing hard, visions of seeing my family tortured to death running through my head. I looked down at Sarah, whose wide, frightened eyes stared off into the distance. I wondered if it would be more merciful to put a bullet in their heads rather than letting them get caught by these monsters. But what if they just brought them back? What if I ended up like X? Even suicide couldn’t save people from such a horrible fate, apparently. Even death offered no escape.

I peaked around the tree, seeing X and a few others closing in on us. The others had gone off in different directions, but we couldn’t take on four of those things with the amount of ammo we had. I needed to decide now- whether to kill my family and save them from torture, or whether to run, or stay and fight.

As they closed within fifty feet of us, helicopters began buzzing overhead. The creatures looked up, disturbed. They began to disperse, hiding in the thick brush and behind ancient trees. Soon all I could see was Dr. Booth, standing tall and still as still as a statue in the clearing.

Apaches and Black Hawks flew in formation, hovering over the forest. Dozens of men in full military gear and gas masks began rappelling down lines, dropping into the forest nearby. I could hear the leader speaking to them, his voice muffled as he yelled through the gas mask.

“Remember your orders, men,” the leader said to the group of a few dozen who quickly regrouped around him. “Destroy all witnesses, grab as much royal jelly as you can, and if possible, take a few of these things alive. Especially a king. The leaders of the pack can grow to ten or eleven feet tall. Look for those ones above all others. The Director wants to study them. Do not kill any kings unless absolutely necessary.”

“Like that one?” one of the men said, pointing a gloved hand at Dr. Booth. They all turned, exclaiming in surprise.

“Get him!” the leader said. I saw the men did not have automatic rifles. Most of them had what looked like flamethrowers, thick canisters strapped on their backs full of flammable material. I wondered for a moment if they carried flamethrowers because, as I had seen, guns didn’t work- they could be brought back to life by the royal jelly, even after getting shot in the head.

The soldiers didn’t hesitate. A couple of the men had specialized guns I had never seen before. They looked almost like bazookas, but as they closed in on Dr. Booth and fired, I realized they were some sort of specialized net-firing guns.

The net instantly wrapped around Dr. Booth, crushing his tendrils together against his body. He finally looked up. I saw he was smiling widely.

The net was attached by a thick black rope to the gun. The team all started to grab it and drag it back, tightening the net. Dr. Booth was knocked to his feet, a massive creature dragged by faceless agents of the government. But he didn’t seem concerned in the least. In fact, he started laughing- a sound like the grating of metal. He spit thick black fluid from his unhinged jaw as he was dragged across the leaves and branches, then just kept laughing- a lunatic sound that reverberated and echoed through the forest. Just hearing the glee and insanity in his voice sent chills down my spine.

“Finally, you cowards come crawling out of your holes,” he said in a deep, gurgling voice. “But it is, I am afraid, too late.” He began to hum some tune, a low sound that traveled much farther than it should have. After a few notes, I recognized it- “The Ride of the Valkyrie” by Wagner.

The soldiers looked around, checking their backs. Even though I couldn’t see their faces through their black gas masks, I could almost see their faces in my mind’s eye- scared, uncertain, afraid of being ambushed by creatures they had never encountered before. And they were right to be.

As the leader called in on his radio for the helicopter to come back and send down a line to pick up their prize, members of the hive began to rush at them from all directions. I saw X in the lead, channeling his troops into military formation. Around his feet, mutated earthworms slithered, as long as snakes with black eyes on stalks that flitted around in all directions. They had murderous fangs and oozed dark fluid, tiny red tendrils writhing beneath their bodies, pushing them forward at a faster and faster pace.

The soldiers screamed and began shooting their flamethrowers, trying to reform into a circular formation. But they were too slow. Some of the members of the hive had hid in the brush close by, waiting for them to come within ten or fifteen feet of their location. They sent out gray and red tentacles, stretching and wrapping around the necks of the soldiers.

The flamethrowers ignited a few of the worms and mutated men and women. They shrieked, a shrill sound that reminded me of the cry of fisher cats I had heard in the woods, but with notes of agony and fury mixed in. They ran forward, flaming torches in the shape of people, insane kamikaze agents unafraid of death as long as it was for the good of the hive. Even as they screamed their eerie cries of pain, they wrapped their flaming arms and tendrils around the soldiers, igniting the backpacks. The dying cries of soldiers and mutated hive members mixed together.

In all of this, I saw Dr. Booth, still smiling, still humming Wagner. Within minutes, only a couple of the soldiers were still alive. X walked forward, stretching his mutated, lengthened arms towards Dr. Booth, freeing him from the net and lifting the massive humanoid to his feet. He looked at the king with adoration, his bloody eyes gleaming.

“I suggest you find somewhere safer to go,” a voice from behind me said. I turned, seeing the skeletal, demonic man in the black robes standing there. He smiled wide at me.

“Who are you?” I whispered. “Why are you helping me?”

“I figure introductions are in order, friend, since you have made it this far,” he said. “My name is Samael. I am here to ensure your survival. You are necessary to my master’s plans. I suggest you run back to the laboratory as fast as you can. The final battle is about to begin.”

“Are you here to help my family too?” I asked. He laughed.

“No, I don’t care about them. They can die. They can burn alive. They can turn into those things. Only you need survive. I will reveal all at the end- if you can make it that far.

“The reinforcements from your government are arriving in droves now, and the thousands of members of the hive are coming this way,” Samael said, grinning wide. He put his emaciated hands up the dreary sky, putting his head back and closing his jet-black eyes in an expression of ultimate pleasure. His multiple snake-like tongues flicked out of his mouth, each writhing and undulating in a different direction as it did so, like trying to taste all the possible currents of the air. “Run. If you value your life, run as fast as you can. Get out of here, now.” And I did. I grabbed my daughter, and my wife and I ran back towards the laboratory. I entered the code, taking refuge in the tunnels under the ground. The internet still worked.

As I wait here for the final battle to start, I can only write my story, hoping that it will not be my last testament before death.
