Hi my name is gage and I'm an alcoholic.

I'm not sure this is the right place for this but I've heard writing out your trauma can be helpful and a friend said I should put this here. It's hard for me to admit but I think I have a drinking problem.

It all started after my mom went missing a few years ago. My mom was an addict, any child of an addict knows just how hard it can be, coming home to strangers in the house, parents being gone for hours on end, getting ourselves ready for school, hell i was convinced i was going to come home and find my mom od’d.

One day, after years of battling her addiction and jumping from shitty guy to guy she eventually found the shittiest of them all, he convinced her to kick me out at 18 and shortly after.

she ran away to California in search of a better life, who can blame her? She kept in touch at first but it eventually became months between phone calls, turns out there's shitty people and drugs everywhere and she was a magnet for them. She relapsed, lost her job, apartment and lived on the streets, she refused help, she didn't want to come home, after 3ish years the whole family stopped hearing from her. Every time my phone got a notification I hoped to see a message with the 619 area code but it never came, until that night, I'll get there eventually.

 We tried to report it as a missing person but finding a specific homeless person in California? Good luck. My family assumes she od’d and was picked up as a jane doe. We held a service and got her a headstone despite no proof that she was dead.

 That was two years ago, I've been sober for 0 of them, I never saw it as a problem until, well, it's not a story I'm proud of but it has made me question everything.

I woke up in a haze, the room was pitch black, my eyes were heavy, head pounding.

“Where am I?” I mumbled as I forced myself to sit up.

I was wet and cold, my heart started beating faster and faster, “Where the hell am I?” 

I blindly reached out to find something. anything. I felt something cold and sleek to my left as I raised my hand along the surface. I felt it change to glass. A shiver ran down my spine. I was trapped.

Last thing I remembered was taking that damn shot of who knows what Martin requested; he always had a questionable taste.

My Friend Ted and his "roommate" Martin invited me out to the local bar to celebrate Ted graduating from the local police academy and becoming a deputy for little ol’ Joan, Illinois. I honestly couldn't care less about the job. Joan, a small town population of 5,000, had a fair share of army rejects, whose next best option was to become a bored and angry deputy

 Sure Ted has been my friend since his family moved to town our freshman year but he isn't exactly one of Joan's most upstanding citizens, we have had our run-ins with the law, skipping school to smoke pot, sneaking into concerts, curfew, all the degenerate teenage stuff. Hell when they picked me up that night he already had a joint lit. 

The drive to the bar was boring, smoked a few joints listening to whatever new shitty indie rock band Martin discovered on his trips to his home town in California, how he ended up in Joan will always be a mystery to me, moving in with ted is even a bigger mystery but i have a few ideas

As we walked into the bar i could feel the stares from the patrons, “i want to leave” i thought, Ted must have sensed my discomfort when he turned around and said “come on bro, it’ll be fine”

Then behind the bar I could see the whole reason I decided to come was plastered over the cheap chalkboard “$1 domestics”

“Hell yeah” I exclaimed just a bit to loudly which got the bartenders attention 

“Oh my god, Ted!!” the bartender screamed as she ran around the bar to greet him

The next few minutes I can only assume consisted of Ted, and the bartender, whose name I never cared to get, catching up. It wasn't until the bartender announced a free round in honor of Ted's new job, that I zoned back in.

Since my mom went missing I really only left the house for work or drinks. Sometimes both I worked at the local liquor store, drinking on the job was big no no, but the boss was a close friend of my moms so he cut me some slack, too much honestly.

The next hour was fun, we drank, we reminisced about high school, talked about new jobs, relationships, played a round of darts, Ted won, at least the academy taught him how to aim

“God it has been so long since I've had this much fun”  i thought to myself just before ted turned to me and asked that damn question i was dreading.

“So dude, how's things with ya know?” ted asked

Martin kicked ted “dude you don't just ask” he started to say when i cut him off

“You mean with my mom missing?”

“Yeah” ted said in a tone like he was ashamed for asking

I was beginning to lie and say “its fine” when the bartender interrupted us by setting 2 shots in front of each us 

“Oh but we didn't order these” i said staring at the beautiful golden liquid 

The bartender shot a quick look at me and then martin

“Martin you son of a bitch I'm in” ted said 

Martin looked confused but we laughed as i reached for the shot

“We have to do the tradition” Ted looked at me

“No man not tonight” i shot him a look

“Wait What tradition?" Martin asked intrigued

“So basically you take a shot then share something then take another shot ” ted explained

“Its something we did as kids when we didn't know how else to talk about the things that were too hard to talk about sober”

“Its dumb” i scoffed

Martin laughed “sounds like it would be fun”

They both stared at me way to long until i sighed and said “fine” 

i just wanted to drink and didn't feel like arguing

“Okay martin you’re new to this so you start”

Martin took his first shot and smiled, proud of keeping his composure, he thought for a second and said with a laugh “i really didn't buy these shots” as he downed the second one taking it almost as good as the first. We didn't believe him but allowed it anyway.

Ted grabbed his first shot  and downed it, i swear he almost cried. he never liked shots but was always the first to take one

He looked at me and i could see the tears in his eyes, not from the liquor but something else

He let out a long sigh  “I'm really worried about you dude. I just want to know your okay” he said with a slight crack in his voice

He took his second shot and almost puked.

 I shot him a look and said “I'm gonna be fine, thank you man.”

I took my first shot and as the sweet golden nectar seeped down my throat i felt a quick second of bliss and then dread and then anger, something i have experienced every day for the last 2 years 

What happened next still confuses me. I don't know if it was anger, the liquor or the fact that I could still feel everyone's eyes on me. I'm sure it was both, but i stood up from my stool, grabbed my shot and walked over to the bar

“What the hell am I doing?” I thought

As i got closer the bar manager stepped in front of me and put his hand out

Without thought and without control i pushed him into a table and climbed up onto the bar shot still in hand

I yelled “hey!” Not that I needed to because if the people weren't staring already they sure as hell are now.

With all those eyes on me i felt such a heavy weight on my chest and my heart was pounding i could barely breath all i could say was “i don't think she’s dead” as i shoveled the shot down my throat and forced a swallow, they knew who i was talking about, the whole town was throwing a damn pity party for me and family ever since my mom went missing, bunch of fake ass townies if you ask me

 I should have felt embarrassed but i felt nothing as i climbed down from the bar that is until i rejoiced at the sight of Martin had getting us another round of shots to wash down their embarrassment before we got kicked out for my antics

As I went to grabbed my shot my phone vibrated, probably Jackie, my girlfriend wondering where the hell i was.

As i pulled out my phone it took me three tries to get my password right

 a message came through from a number with a 619 area code, my heart dropped.

Confused i opened the text message and the words read “hey G-man, miss you, how i wish, how i wish you were here” 

“There's no fucking way” i exclaimed, “there is absolutely no way, after all this time she..” I stopped. 

Ted and Martin looked at me absolutely looking for more information

I ignored them as my mind moved a thousand miles, “how is she alive?”, “what happened?” “this has to be a joke right” 

“ted and martin dragged me out to play a stupid trick on me” i thought for a second as i reread that message

 “how i wish, how i wish you were hear” a line from Pink Floyds “wish you were here” song

See my mom was a hippie, she loved Pink Floyd, when her and her boyfriend would fight she would come into my room and we would listen to Pink Floyd, specifically “wish you were here”

“It has to be her” i thought as i hit the green call button

One ring, ‘what will i say”?

Two rings “what if its not her” my heart pounding, noticing the shot still sitting in front of me

Three rings, Ted and Martin shared a look of worry as i grabbed the shot, i brought the glass to my lips as i gulped down that delicious unknown elixir

Four rings Everything went black

As i sat in the darkness, still unsure where i am or how i got here panic began to set in 

My first thought was the bar manager got pissed at my antics and im trapped in his basement

But then i remembered the text message, i checked my pockets, empty, all i felt on my cold hands was soaked denim

I brought my hand to my nose and took a small inhale, the scent of puke and piss flooded my nose, I gagged.

I pissed myself. “Great” 

I could here the shuffling of feet coming from what i assumed was the hall way that led to the room my glass cage was in, i reached out for the glass and started pounding on it trying to yell but nothing came out as my throat was so dry and recovering from who knows how much alcohol i shoved down it the night before

Me banging on the glass did the job as the door to the room opened letting in the light 

Blinded, all i could see was the silhouette of a woman

Forcing myself to swallow, I choked out the word “mom?” 

Before i could finish the strange figure turned on the light

What i saw, surprised me to my core, all i could do was cry

It was jackie and i was in my damn shower

That's right, I wasn't kidnapped by the angry bar manager or my missing mom. I was in my damn bathroom

Turns out after i took that final shot i blacked out and got into an argument the bar manager trying to kick us out

Ted was able to talk him out of pressing charges on me, using his new power of Joan's finest then brought me home puking at every stoplight on the way

 I really am sorry about the seats!

Jackie explained I was so drunk and uncooperative, she tried to get me to wash the puke off in the shower but i laid down in the tub and decided I wasn't going to move. So she left me there in my filth

Id like to say this was the first time Jackie had to take care of an overly inebriated me, but that would be a lie

Jackie has always been there for me. Me, her, and Ted were inseparable in high school, I always had feelings for her but it wasn't until after high school that i made a move. And with Ted's approval of course I started dating his sister

She has stayed much longer than she should have. After my mom went missing I became the world's worst boyfriend. I always drank, ignored household tasks, played video games for hours on end.

But for some reason she always stayed 

After spending the next hour apologizing and cleaning myself up. There was only one thing I could think of. 

Okay fine two things, alcohol obviously and the damn mystery message.

“Where's my phone?” i asked jackie

“Ohhh ted said you left it in his car, Martin should be by to drop it off soon, he also wanted to pick up a couple grams”

This is all anonymous right? I hope so, I started selling weed in high school when my moms boyfriend went to jail, not a lot, just to my friends and their friends to help my mom with bills, after I got kicked out it just made sense, the shitty liquor store job wasn't gonna make ends meet.

Martin showed up around 2pm. I apologized for my behavior the night before and thanked him and Ted for getting me home. 

Martin stayed too long, we smoked a few joints and talked about his new band he was a part of

“The shitkickers” or something as equally cringe

Once he left and Jackie went to work, i went to my stash of shooters i stole from work and pulled out my favorite cheap whiskey, i downed two of them and made my way to the game room

i plugged in my phone waiting to watch the percentage move to 1% 

Once i powered it on i went to the message, it was real

Checked my call logs, i did make the call the night before, it went to voicemail

I redialed the number and called again

“The number you have dialed is no longer in service”

This was usual in the past when trying to contact my mom

She would find an active sim card and use it for a day or two until the owners cancelled the service, But this was fast, almost as if someone was pulling a prank and realized it was wrong.

My mind quickly shut down the prank, that was dumb right? 

It has to be her, i can feel it, all i know is she wouldn’t willingly not keep in contact with me all that time

“She was held hostage by her drug dealer” “she escaped a trafficking ring” both crossed my mind filling me with fear

Then I remembered a short story I read a while back about a guy whose girlfriend died and was messaging him as a ghost, i don't remember how it ended but it all felt so real

Despite me not believing in ghosts that was the only answer that didn't freak me out for some reason

Either way i cant shake this feeling that something isn't right 

That was two days ago Its now 11pm and im blissfully drunk as i type this out, i know i have a problem and i want to get help, i think to myself “tonight is the last night, im done no more alcohol”

As i was getting ready to post this i got a text

Its a 619 number

The message says “new phone, i love you buddy, please talk to me”

Fuck this im taking another shot!

thank you for reading, 



I had posted this recalling of my embarrassing experience on a AA website last week and someone directed me to this subreddit, they said you guys might be able to help with the weird message i will add i tried calling that new number but it went straight to voicemail and they responded with “cant talk on the phone, lets text, G-man” 

I've been sober for 3 days and am starting to feel better, but when i think about the messages i want to drink

Should I respond to the message?
