As I was walking around town one evening, exactly 2 days after my car accident, which had caused my slight limp, I noticed the streets were irregularly empty. It was around midday, lunchtime, so I had expected traffic to be awful. Which is why I had opted to walk instead of drive. I was going to got to a different resturant than usual, because I had tried to order, but the customers were extremely rude, as I was interrupted multiple times, and nudged out of line, and the cashier ignored me when I spoke. What was also weird, was that none of my texts were being responded to, and the only one that had a response, was from my mother. It read,"Sicko! What kind of person does something like this?!" I had asked her and attempted to call her multiple times, but she never replied. *Maybe they are stil shook up about the accident...* I had thought. I glanced around, and saw that many of the animals around were noticing me more than the others around me. The squirrels didn't seem afraid of me, the mice and flys seemed infatuated with me. 

Me not paying attention, I bumped into a man who was particularly agitated. He turned to say something presumably rude to me, but looked around in confusion as he returned to walking, seeming to be hard in thought. It was weird, almost as if he didn't notice me at all. I shrugged it off and continued walking. I got to the restuarant, and just as the other night, I was treated with extreme disregard, ignored, and rudely talked over. I quickly left and returned to walking. I walked down to the bus stop and waited there.

A man sat across from me. I sighed, he was homeless, and looked to be drunk, or high, or something. He looked over at me, and his eyes went wide,"I told them! I told them that they were real! But noOoo one ever believes me!" He walked away, stuttering and stumbling. I shurgged it off again. The bus driver ignored me, the passangers ignored me, everyone ignored me. Only a select few people side glanced me, and then horror rose in their eyes as they tried not to look at me.

After the bus stopped at my house, I tried to pay the driver, but he ignored me once again. I got off and walked home, to find a police car in my drive way. I went inside, and the police ignored me. They went through all of my things, and took a select few of my watches, pictures, clothes etc. I rushed into the bathroom and hid, wishing someone would acknowledge me existance. That's when it hit me. I looked into the mirror.

My jaw was hanging off. It didn't hurt, but there it was, dangling. My eyes were bloodshot, and my nose was twsited sideways. I looked like something out of a horror movie. I had piece of glass stuck in the sides of my face, exposing many chunks of all but dead meat, and chunky blood. I was mortified myself. I punched the mirror out of sheer fear of myself. The policeman burst in the room, and searched around me in bewilderment as to what caused the shattered mirror. I was right there. Right in front of them. And they ignored me.

I don't know what is going on. I know the accident has something to do with it. I remember waking up on the sidewalk, trying to call my family but they wouldn't pick up, and then going home with my second car no where to be seen. It's like I am invisible. Literally invisible. If anyone finds this, please leave a note in this exact spot, I will find it. I need someone to know I am here. Because right now, only I do.

I found this note from my friend a few days ago. I have written back and left the note in the same spot. My friend died in a car accident about a week ago. He had collided with one of the telephone poles, and the impact killed him instantly. I am not sure if this is some kind of sick joke, or if they really are a ghost, but whatever it is, I wanna find out. This is only the beginning of this story, I know it. I just hope I don't end up like him from it.
