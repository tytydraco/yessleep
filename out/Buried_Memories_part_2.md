I stood there in my front room and stared down at the artifact in my hand, replaying that night in my head over and over again for what felt like hours. My head was spinning, and I felt anger building alongside the fear. The images in my head were too clear to be just a dream, I had to know for sure. I pulled out my phone and called Dad. My first try went to voicemail, it was nearly 4:30AM after all. But before I could try calling again, my phone started ringing. 

“Will?” Said Dad, “What's going on son, are you alright.” 

I was silent, wondering how to start. 

“Will?”  

“I found the artifact.” I said. 

Now dad was silent for a moment, then, “What artifact?” 

“In Kyle’s backpack. The artifact that you said was nothing to worry about.” 

“Oh... I see, and are you okay?” He asked. 

“I remember what happened.” 

Dad sighed, “No, Will. I know where you're going with this, Kyle ran away. Thats all.”  

“Dad.” 

“God Dammit Will! I thought we were past this.” He exploded. 

“Dad, I...” 

“No,” He interrupted, “We have been over this time and time again. There was no woman, it never happened.” 

“Dad!” I shouted, “I'm going back to the property. I have the map we made, I have to see for myself. Will you come with me?”  

 He sighed in frustration, “Look, you can't just...” 

“I'm going whether you come with me or not.” 

“What do you expect to find Will? You think you'll just run a cross an old woman with deer antlers out in the woods? Do you hear how crazy that sounds?” 

I went silent as I felt something inside me break.  

“Will, answer me!” He demanded. 

I had to swallow the lump in my throat before I could speak, “I never told you about the antlers.” 

Silence stretched, then, “Son, listen...” He began. 

But I cut him off, “I never told anyone because I knew no one would believe me.”  

“You’re not thinking clearly, just listen to me.” 

“You knew, this whole time, you fucking knew!” 

“Will, please just listen...” 

But I was done listening. I ended the call and stood there breathing hard, I felt sick. My father was a good man, but why the hell had he hidden this from me? He had lied to me, to everyone. I had been right all those years ago, I knew that now. But what was I supposed to do? 

My mind raced, why had that woman taken Kyle? What had she done with him? I had to know, I had to go back. 

 I went to my room and got dressed. I knew my dad would be on his way over here soon. I had to go now, otherwise he might show up and try to stop me. I stuffed the artifact, along with a snub nosed .38 revolver that my parents had given me into Kyle’s backpack and threw it over my shoulder before heading for the door.  

 

45 minutes later, I pulled my truck to a stop outside the locked gate to the property. The realty sign that had been there when I was a kid was so faded and weather worn, it could barely be read. Looked like no one ever bought the old place after all. 

I managed to knock the old lock loose with a hammer from my trucks toolbox. As I drove up the long winding driveway, I remembered how excited Kyle and I were to come out here, to chart our path through the dense forest. I also remembered the fear I felt seeing those strands dangling from the trees and the antlered woman who took my friend. She was out here; I could feel it.  

I parked my truck next to the old house. It was in much worse shape now, one side having completely fallen in. I didn't want to be out in the woods in the dark so I decided to wait for sunrise. 

 It wasn't long before the first rays of light began peeking through the forest as the sky lightened. Stepping out of my truck, I pulled the revolver from the backpack and slipped it into my pocket. If she was out here, if I found her, I would be ready for her. 

Passing by the spot where we had camped, where I last saw my friend, I made my way into the forest. It was difficult following the trails we made as kids; the forest had grown over many of our original map markers. 

Eventually, after scraping nearly every inch of exposed skin trekking through the foliage, I found the boulder we had climbed on. It had seemed so much bigger years ago. I smiled thinking back at how we thought we had really accomplished something when we managed to climb atop it as kids, now I could stand flat footed and reach the top with an outstretched arm. That happy memory was quickly followed by the realization that I was getting close to the part of the woods I feared. I checked the map for reference and journeyed on. 

It wasn't long before I reached the spot where Kyle had found the artifact. Just as it was before, dozens, maybe even hundreds of the things dangled from the trees ahead of me. I looked up and was again in awe at the height some of the strands reached. What the hell was this place? And who was the antlered woman? I gritted my teeth and walked into the cluster of trees.  

This time there was no chanting, no whispering, no sound at all. I walked on, further than Kyle and I had made it before. Eventually I came to a large overgrown hedge that encircled a clearing in the forest.  

Pushing my way through the hedge I saw that there was a small ramshackle cabin situated in the center of the clearing. I scanned the area, but saw no signs of the woman or anything living. Pulling the revolver from my pocket, I cautiously approached the cabin. It was made of old logs and what looked like bits of siding from the abandoned house. I circled the cabin cautiously before pushing the door open, ready to shoot if someone or something came running out at me. But it seemed that the cabin was empty, at least for now. The place smelled horrid, like rancid meat and Sulphur. I nearly vomited but managed to hold it together.  

Inside I found a worn wooden table with one chair, a straw covered wooden bed frame and a small fireplace with a soot covered cooking pot or cauldron. There were jars filled with liquids and what I could only assume was rotten meat, among other substances I had no way of identifying. Dozens of the artifacts hung from the ceiling, most of them containing bits of bone, some looked very fresh. I was about to turn and leave when I heard movement coming from outside.  

“Shit.” 

 She was coming. I looked down at the gun in my hand, I could just shoot her right as she entered and be done with this whole thing. But was I that kind of person? A cold-blooded killer? No, I couldn't do that. Besides I had a growing fear that my little .38 might not be enough. I quickly and quietly went over to the bed and scrambled underneath it, only to realize I wasn't alone under there.  

To my horror I found myself face to face with a twisted and broken human skeleton. The skulls vacant eye holes stared back at me as I clamped my hand over my mouth, trying desperately to remain quiet as the cabin door swung open.  

Bare feet padded across the dirt floor, dragging the animal hide cloak. The woman dropped a wriggling sack onto the floor and something within it squealed. She sat down on a stool and began stoking the fire in the small fire pit. Once the fire was going, she reached for the bag, then stopped. Seeing her again filled me with a deep and primal fear. Her hunched and menacing appearance reminded me of the folk tales my grandparents told me as a child. What had they called the old women in those tales? Crones, that was it.  

 My view of the crone’s face was blocked by a large hood, but I could see her head cock to one side in an insect like motion as she began sniffing the air. My heart was pounding as she dropped to all fours and began crawling around the cabin sniffing like an animal on the prowl. The revolvers grip felt slick with sweat and the weapon felt wholly insignificant in the face of this, thing. What was I thinking coming out here? That I was some hero, here to slay a monster? I had to get away from here.  

Then I heard something that sent fresh fear into my gut. 

“Will!”  

The crone’s hooded head snapped towards the door as my father called my name again and again, he had come out here looking for me. The Crone darted out the door and off towards his voice. I began to crawl out from under the bed but stopped when I glanced back at the skeleton. I felt my heart breaking all over again as I looked at the faded blue backpack gripped in the skeletal arms.  

The clothes were tattered and filthy, hanging on him like old parchment, but I recognized them now.  Sobs racked my body as I reached out pulled my long-lost friend into an embrace that he would never feel.  

“I'm sorry, Kyle.” I said through sobs, “I'm so so sorry.” 

Suddenly, a gunshot rang out in the distance. The sound broke me out of my sorrow, I had to get to dad and help him. I decided I would try to come back for Kyles body when this was over, he deserved a proper burial. There was another gunshot, followed by an inhuman scream. I ran out of the cabin and into the woods. I had to find my Dad, I wouldn't lose anyone else to this bitch.  

 

My legs ached and my lungs burned as I sprinted through the forest, dodging branches and leaping over fallen logs but I had to keep pushing. 

“Dad! I'm coming!” I shouted as I burst out of the forest next to our old campsite, I was only about a hundred yards away from my truck. I saw my Dad about half that distance away, his back to me and his gun abandoned on the ground. I watched in horror as he fell to his knees, the hunched and antlered woman standing before him. There was a splatter of blood on the grass, but I couldn't tell whose it was.  

I raised my revolver and started forward, “Get away from him!” I demanded. 

Her hooded head snapped up and I could see two hazy yellow eyes fixed on me. I realized she had been chanting in a low whisper and as I approached, the whispered chant seemed to grow louder and louder. The voice was hoarse and ragged and the language she spoke felt wrong in my ears. It was a collection of gasps and growls mixed with sounds that no human should be able to make. The sound of the chanting grew until it seemed to be coming from all around me and from within me. I felt dizzy and my vision began to blur. The voice echoed around the inside of my skull, like a hundred angry bees trying to find a way out. I tried to raise my gun but I no longer had control of my body. I fell to the ground hard, something warm leaked from my ears and eyes as I slipped into unconsciousness. 

 

Darkness surrounded me. There was no light, there was no sound. There was only the darkness and the biting cold. I wandered blindly, aimlessly. Until at last, I heard a something. It was a sob, someone was crying. I followed the sound until I found its source.  

There in a singular shaft of light, his head on his knees, was Kyle. He looked up at me as I approached him and fresh tears rolled down his face.  

“I didn't mean for this to happen. You weren't supposed to come back.”  

I tried to speak but I had no voice in this place. 

“You don't have much time, you need to get away.” 

I felt the wind at my back growing stronger as another voice began calling to me, “Will! Will!”  

I looked back to Kyle, I wanted to talk to him, I needed to know how to stop her, but I could feel myself being pulled away. As I was pulled back into consciousness, I heard Kyle’s voice sending me one last message. 

“Will?!” It was dad's voice.  

I blinked in confusion and looked around at my surroundings, night had fallen but I knew where we were. The dozens of threads dangling from the ceiling and the glass jars lining the walls. We were back in the cabin.  

I was laying on the floor with my hands and feet bound in twine. I shifted around to see dad stuck in a similar position. He had trails of dried blood coming from his eye's ears and nose. 

“Are you alright son?” He asked. 

I nodded, “I'm fine, what about you? You’re covered in blood.” 

“So are you.” He said studying my face. 

“Listen Will. That thing will be back any minute, you have to get out of here.”  

I shook my head, “I’m not leaving you here. Besides, my hands and feet are tied. I couldn't leave if I wanted to.” 

Dad sighed, “I'm sorry Will. I never should have let you come out here.” 

“Why?” I said turning to face him, “Because you knew she was here? Because I was right about Kyle being taken?” 

He looked away, shame and regret written all over his face. “Yes.” 

“What happened? Why did you lie to me?” I demanded. 

He took a deep breath, “That night, I woke up to a sound coming from outside the tent. It was a voice, her voice. It scared the shit out of me and I wanted to believe it was just a bad dream.” He hesitated, “Then, I heard you scream. I jumped to my feet, I thought I was ready to face anything to protect you, I was wrong...I unzipped my tent and I froze. You were screaming and Kyle was screaming, but she wasn't after you.” 

I could feel body trembling with anger, “So you just let her take him? You just fucking stood there and watched?” 

He didn't shy away from the accusation, instead he turned back to meet my eyes. “Yes. She wanted him, not you. And I thanked God for that.”  

We stared at each other for a moment. Eventually I broke the silence, “What if she had been there for me?” 

He didn't have to answer, the look of shame on his face was enough. 

Suddenly the cabin door flew open with a bang. the crone walked across the room and stooped down in front of the fire, adding more wood and brightening the inside of the cabin. 

With the fire stoked she stood and turned to look down at us. One long spindly arm reached up and removed the hood, exposing the curved branches of the antlers atop her head. The long animal hide cloak fell to the floor revealing a horribly disfigured body that will forever haunt my dreams. She was skeletal thin and pale with unnaturally long limbs. She stood on her toes and her legs bent back in a hook shape below the knee, like a dog's hind legs. Her left hand dangled bloody and limp at her side, one of dad's shots had nearly taken it off.  

Dad and I stayed silent as she walked over to the wooden table and picked up a massive cleaver. She placed her mangled hand on the tabletop and with one quick motion hacked it off cleanly. Dark blood sprayed as she stood and tossed the discarded appendage into the fireplace. She turned back towards the table and without breaking stride reached down and grabbed Dads' leg, dragging him along with her. He screamed and kicked trying to free himself. I could do nothing as she bent and began whispering the chant into his ear. His body went limp, and his eyes rolled to the back of his head. She then laid his limp body on top of the table with his left arm outstretched.  

I had to stop this, but what could I do. I looked around the cabin for something, anything to help me get loose. My eyes scanned under the bed to Kyles body, to my old backpack. I rolled over and began frantically crawling toward the pack, but I couldn't move fast enough. Behind me, I heard the sickening chunk of the cleaver. I winced at the sound, but I couldn't look back. 

I reached the bed and had to maneuver myself around to reach my bound hands under the frame to the backpack. I hurriedly unzipped it and felt inside for what I hoped was still there. I smiled despite the situation when I felt the textured metal hilt of my old surplus survival knife. 

The blade was dull but still managed to cut through the twine binding my hands and feet. I looked up from freeing myself to see the Crone pressing my dad's severed hand into place on its wrist. I watched in horror as the fingers began to move and flex. She examined the stolen flesh and smiled, her teeth gray and rotted. I realized she hadn't yet noticed me and jumped to my feet. I couldn't let her speak. If she started chanting, I would be paralyzed.  

I charged across the cabin and rammed the knife blade into her chest. She howled in pain as she dug her fingernails into my flesh over and over again, trying to pull me closer to her gnashing teeth. I could feel her hot breath on my face as she tried desperately to get at my throat. I was losing ground, but I could feel her growing weaker. I pushed her back as hard as I could until we slammed into the wall of the cabin. With a violent shove I drove the blade through her and into the wall, pinning her in place. The thrashing and chomping slowed and then came to a stop as her body went limp. 

I ran to the table to check on dad, he was alive but had lost a lot of blood. I had to get him out of here. I took off my belt and wrapped it tightly around his stump as a makeshift tourniquet. I shook him violently, “Wake the fuck up, we have to go now!”  

After a few more hard shakes he came to enough to lean on me and walk. We were almost out of the door when the whispered chanting filled the air. I looked back at the crone, still pinned to the wall. She had a wide smile on her face as she continued the chant. I felt myself growing dizzy as dad fell to the floor. I had to stop her, before it was too late. My eyes fell on the cleaver lying atop the table. I quickly grabbed the blade and swung hard, leaning all of my weight into the effort. The voice stopped as her antlered head fell to the floor with a loud thud. I looked down at her smiling face, still trying to vocalize the spell and remembered Kyles final message to me. 

“Fire purifies.”  

I reached down and picked up the crone's head and tossed it into the fireplace. Her body still pinned to the wall began to thrash and writhe, trying to get loose. I wasn't taking any chances, just for good measure, I burned the whole fucking cabin down.  

Dad and I hobbled through the forest, lit by hundreds of small flames. Whatever curse or spell she had put on those twine artifacts, they were burning along with her. After we finally made it out of the forest to our vehicles and called for an ambulance, I lay back against the wheel of my dad's jeep, my mind struggling to process what had just happened. As I lay there, I thought I saw someone standing at the edge of the tree line. It was dark, but the full moon shed enough light to make the figure out. A tear rolled down my cheek as he smiled and waved goodbye before turning and walking into the forest, off on his next adventure.
