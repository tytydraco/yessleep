We weren't supposed to be there. I don't think anyone ever was.

The place wasn't on any map we could find. No clear routes or trails, not even in the urbex forums. Some Cold War-era bunker, long since condemned, supposedly built over something even older. Like a cryptid, it was something no one had records for. A few photos had been floating around the forums, mostly blurry and not of anything of substance. They probably weren't even taken there. Riley and I wanted to be the first.

And we thought we were until the door was already open when we got there.

Just slightly.

We felt better after the door took us about twenty minutes to pry open. Rusted metal and the loudest creaking known to man. Thankfully, even though it's on private land, it's deep in the woods. Miles of trees in either direction could hide the sound of a ritual killing if it happened.

Once inside, it was pretty clear we were among the first—if not the actual first—people who had ever been in there, aside from the original owners, assuming they ever actually used it.

We did what any urbexer worth their salt would've done: we explored.

Riley and I know better than to get too far apart. Never more than one room's space, he started off to the right, and I followed right behind him.

We walked past furniture that looked ancient, like one gust of wind and it'd all crumble into dust. While walking, my flashlight flickered and I lost focus of my feet and ended up kicking a desk. As I walked past, something fell off of it onto the floor in front of me, almost causing me to trip directly into Riley.

He turned around, shining his flashlight right into my eyes.  
"Bro, what was that?"

I remember throwing up a hand to block his flashlight and saying something like,  
"Well, if I could see, I'd tell you."

Once he moved his flashlight down to the object, we saw that it was a book. Well, it was a diary, but we didn't know that when we picked it up.

When I picked it up, it felt like the air had shifted. It felt like the darkness our flashlights didn't chase off was leaning in, waiting for something. I was going to put it back on the shelf, but Riley snatched it from my hands and flipped it open. He started reading aloud:

January 1st, 1806  
A new year at last! Fear not, dear diary, it is I—Kate Newthorn—here to save you from your lonely pages!

After reading the first passage, he said,  
"I think this is a diary, dude!"  
And then he immediately kept reading it. Powerless to stop him when he found something he was interested in.

I just looked at the pages in his hands; it wasn't a true diary—it looked like it was a collection of loose pages that someone had grouped together and stuck inside of a binding.

The entries were surprisingly well preserved—some smudged, most still readable. They were written by a girl. Her name was Kate, she mentioned she had just had her fifteenth birthday, she was a kid. Her brother Jack had an imaginary friend named Lilly.

At first, it was cute. Then Riley kept reading, and… it wasn't.

Riley started skipping through pages; he was still reading aloud:

March 20th, 1806  
Jack says Lilly made him a sandwich. The porch door was open. Father thinks Jack has a stalker. I'm scared.

I remember looking at Riley after that entry and saying,  
"This is messed up."

He laughed nervously, flipped the page, and was getting ready to read the next entry when we heard it.

**Tap. Tap. Tap.**

It was faint, almost inaudible. I doubt we would have heard it had Riley kept reading.

He looked nervous, let out another nervous chuckle, and shook his head like he was trying to shake off the eerie feeling.  
"It's probably water," he had said.  
"Or a rat," I had added.

But we both knew it felt off. Something about the rhythm felt different.

"You should go check that out." He told me,  
"You like rodents and stuff; if you get bit by a rat, you'll check it off your bucket list or something."

I sure as hell did not want to go check it out, so I proposed we solve it like we always did: rock, paper, scissors.

I won. Riley looked very unhappy about that. As he turned down the hallway, I told him to bring me back a rat.

He blinded me again and said,  
"You suck."  
Touché.

I followed him with my flashlight. Just because I wasn't following him physically didn't mean the rules stopped applying.

He was never more than one room's space away. I waited in the hall as he turned into a room up ahead. What I'm sure was a few minutes felt like an eternity waiting for him.

I thought I heard more tapping behind me, but it was just too quiet. I eventually leaned up against a wall because I couldn't take feeling vulnerable, completely in the dark any longer.

After a few more minutes, I went to check on him, and as soon as I stood up off the wall, he screamed.

Riley was a jokester, but he wasn't that kind of jokester. He knew better.

I ran after him. My flashlight was still flickering, and being made worse by my frantic movements, I still made it to the room in seconds flat.

There was no one there. Just blood on the floor—a smear dragging off further into the darkness. No Riley.

Then something moved in the shadows—just out of the corner of my eye—I thought maybe it was Riley.

I went to follow it, but the tapping was back, and it was much louder now.

**Tap. Tap. Tap.**

I called out,  
"Riley?"

**Tap. Tap. Tap.**

"Riley dude, are you okay?"

**Tap. Tap. Tap.**

"Riley where are you man"

**TapTap. TapTap. TapTap.**

That time, it was different. More hurried.  
It felt, hungry?

**TapTap. TapTap. TapTap.**

It wasn't Riley, and whatever it was, it was multiplying.

**TapTapTap. TapTapTap. TapTapTap.**

I took off towards the door. I couldn't call the cops to save Riley if I was dead.

**TapTapTap. TapTapTap. TapTapTap.**

That's all I heard as whatever it was barreled after me.

I ran the hardest I could, then I saw it.  
*The. Fucking. Door.*

Heavy, old, and metal. It took two people twenty minutes to open, and I wasn't sure I would be able to close it. If I did, Riley would be trapped with whatever it was.

**TapTapTapTap. TapTapTapTap. TapTapTapTap.**  
**TapTapTapTap. TapTapTapTap. TapTapTapTap.**

Then I slid into the inside of the door. The opening was smaller than I remember, and I didn't slow down enough to get there gracefully, but I got there.

As whatever it was turned into a cacophony, I slipped back outside.

I could hear it getting closer; I tried to push the door, to shove it, to kick it, but nothing.  
It didn't move.

In panic and rage, guided by sheer adrenaline, I slammed my full body into the door.

It moved maybe a centimeter. I did it again; a sharp pain shot up my shoulder, and yet, the door had only moved another inch.

I took a small running start and cast aside all self-preservation, and then **SLAM**. It finally closed.

I didn't stick around to see if they could open it back up; I booked it back to my car parked on a dirt road about a mile out.

And then I called the cops.
