Around two weeks ago, I was hit by a car, and got so close to dying, that the paramedics overseeing me were convinced I was dead. But, I was able to pull myself together, just long enough to be brought to a hospital.

While this was pleasant, considering I didn't *die*, I was still unable to really recover mentally. Turns out dying does more to you than the stories would tell, and I know damn well that I never saw any hellfire or witnessed the divine light of heaven.

I woke up in a hospital bed, about two days after the accident, both my legs broken and my arm nearly shattered; it was barely salvaged, but it survived, mostly. I was also mostly intact, aside from the fact that I now have a permanent scar on the right side of my face, and my right eye doesn't always work, kinda flickery.

I was wondering what happened, and my fiancé was sitting beside the medical bed. He was surprised that I was awake, since the doctors were convinced I was comatose, especially with my brainwaves as a factor in the situation. He explained the situation to the best of his ability, and I was left to fill in the pieces from the fragments of my memory.

I wasn't concerned about *how* I died, mostly because I could remember it. But I was more interested in the aftermath, which was uninteresting for the most part. According to my fiancé, the paramedics were trying to use chest compressions, but my condition was only worsening, until I "flatlined" on the ground. They were convinced I was dead and were prepared to give up, until my heartbeat suddenly spiked, and I was back to breathing, as if God had given me a second chance.

"Nobody can really explain it," He started, "It's like...One minute, you were gone, and the next, you were just back. Like magic"

Now, I grew up an atheist, kinda the reason I never really cared whether I'd see heaven or hell when I finally clicked off. But when I felt the cold embrace of death, I *felt* something else, kinda like cosmic eyes looking at me, until I was suddenly thrust into my body, then I blacked out. I can't explain it, and I spent the corresponding week researching various kinds of mythology and folklore on the Internet as a result, but my search yielded few results.

I mean, I found *thousands* of pages about ghosts, gods, reapers, and god knows what else. At best, I'd found the stories of reapers to be the most interesting, but nothing fit my situation. I began to wonder if I'd just felt something akin to hallucination since I was on the brink of death. But every time I felt that thought creep in, I'd feel the cold embrace returning, kind of like arms wrapping around my throat, but never feeling the choking as a result, just the coldness.

Sometimes, I'd let the thought linger, just to feel that cold embrace, as if I subconsciously *wanted* to feel the sensation. Then, about three days ago, I felt a new sensation, nothing sensual, but curious. Whenever the thought lingered long enough, I'd feel the coldness shift, like fingers moving, and it'd begin creeping down my back, before pausing just above my pelvis, stopping right at the point where my spine connects with my pelvis bone. With some help from my fiancé, I was able to deduce that, sometime during or after the accident, I'd gotten a small black marking at the exact spot where I'd feel the fingers stop.

Using this *mark* as a branch point, I broadened my search, eventually coming across something that felt accurate. However, it wasn't ordinary folklore. Truthfully, it wasn't *folklore* at all, but it was, ashamingly, the seemingly crazed ramblings of somebody online. They spoke of *entities* that assisted Death, acting as "her" assistants, being the reapers that humans had spent centuries fearing and believing in.

My fiancé, bless his heart, was *far* from trusting this random guy online, and suggested I not entertain his crazed ideas. I was fully in agreement, but I knew that this might be my only lead, so I went against his wishes and continued my research. It was the dead of night, 12 days since my accident, and I discovered something unknowable. The *thing* I saw when I died, was called a *Visitor*, and it was considered an "Angel of Death", similar to the biblical one that took firstborns from Egypt.

They were believed to be the first generation of *Reapers*, and assisted Death in the collection of souls across the cosmos. They were considered beautiful, but impossible to look upon at the same time, as gazing into their infinitely black eyes would spell your inevitable demise. Not only that, but they were classified as being humanoid, but possessing large black, feathered wings, similar to many interpretations of Angels, just black wings instead of white ones. By morning, I practically knew everything about the Visitors that was possible, with my fiancé being more worried about me than I thought possible.

He was hesitant to leave me now, especially with how I'd been acting since the accident, so I was forced to keep him around by the night of my 14th day in the hospital. I'd left my bed, and was traveling to the basement of the hospital, keeping my phone on hand to help with the *summoning ritual*. The user I was getting all my information from was surprisingly blunt, with detailed instructions on contacting or summoning a Visitor.

The ritual itself required:  

1. Recite the incantation listed while proceeding with all further steps, "Audi vocem meam, o magnum telum mortis. Ausculta vocationem meam, et procede ut ei quem capere non potuisti occurras. Audi vocem meam, o magnum telum mortis. Ausculta vocationem meam, et mihi obviam ire, ei quem capere non potuisti, mihi obviam ire et te ipsum revela."
2. Salt, to act as a cleansing agent,
3. water, to act as the fluctuating nature of life and death
4. And the blood of the person who had interacted with the Visitor in question. 

My blood. 

Which I was able to procure using my fiancé's pocket knife, taken when he'd fallen asleep after sharing one of my "entertaining" stories about an old hiking trip I'd taken years ago.

With all of the ingredients, I was able to prepare the ritual, putting them together in a pudding cup I cleaned out. Now, I was confined to a wheelchair, so putting everything together was harder than you'd think, especially with both legs and one arm busted, but I was determined as hell to get it done. 

First, I added the salt, sprinkling it in while mumbling the incantation to myself. With the salt added, I poured the water into the pudding cup, continuing the incantation. Once both were added, I raised the pocket knife, put it against the palm of my injured hand, and sliced open my flesh, feeling the warm liquid oozing down and into the pudding cup as I held it overhead. As soon as enough liquid had entered, I covered my hand with a bandage I'd brought with me, and held the pudding cup in the air while resuming the ritual.

At first, nothing happened, even after I'd finished the incantation. As a result, I was rightfully pissed, since I was under the impression that I'd been tricked, and that I would need to explain to my fiancé that I'd cut myself trying to summon a fake entity. However, the pudding cup was knocked from my hand, falling to the ground, and spilling the contents across the ground; at least, it would have done, had it not been entirely emptied out.

I was left stunned, since the pudding cup was filled less than a second before, but had been entirely emptied in less than a moment before it was knocked down. Not only that, but I could feel the room suddenly becoming colder, even though it was already quite cold. I could actively *feel* the temperature dropping, until I was hugging my chest in hopes of warming myself up, but stopped when I heard it.

Footsteps.

Loud, clanking footsteps.

At first, I was wondering if a janitor or a doctor had followed me down here, or had heard me doing the incantation. But my considerations were dashed when a human stepped into view, but he was unfamiliar, and surprisingly attractive. He looked about my age, if a year older, and barely looked much older than 32. I was going to ask who he was, until his jacket shifted, and the back burst open, revealing a pair of large, feathery wings, blacker than the night sky when the moon was absent.

"Figured this'd answer your question better than words would, since it's fairly obvious." He chuckled. 

The stories weren't wrong; his eyes were empty pits of solid, black tar, and his smile crept across his face. Yet I noticed how *wrong* he seemed to be, like staring at the uncanny valley of an unusually realistic picture. Everything about this guy was so perfect, and yet so wrong, like he was some kind of imitation of a person, rather than an actual one.

"What...What are you..." I asked.

"You already know the answer, so why not ask a better one?" He responded, almost bored. "Besides, you summoned me, I assume you've got better questions rather than the obvious."

I was paused, as if stuck in the consideration phase.

"*Who* are you?" I rumbled.

"Now *that* is a better question." He smiled, almost too wide. "The name's Dylan, and I'm your *Visitor*." 

"Okay?" I responded. "*Why*?"

"Why what?" He wondered.

"Why are you *my* Visitor?" I continued.

"Simple, that's what the boss wanted, so I simply obliged. I've learned it's better not to ask questions, especially when the boss can get pretty upset." He explained, his eyes briefly widening, as if the concept of upsetting his boss frightened him.

"You were there when I died, weren't you?" I proposed.

"Yeah, the boss sent me when she felt you fading, said I needed to make sure you didn't. So, I gave you a good wing blast, and you shot right back into that sexy meat suit of yours\~" He revealed, his mouth opening slightly, revealing the slightly sharpened fangs protruding from his gums.

"*Why*?"

"That's a loaded question, but to answer it simply. Some people can't die until their time comes; you weren't meant to go, so I couldn't let you. Pretty simple," He explained.

"How is that possible? I'm just some guy, I'm not that important." I retorted.

"Oh, that's what *everybody* thinks. They always believe they're meaningless, but they are so far from it. Every living thing, from the smallest insect, to the largest mammal. Each has an important place in the natural order of life and death." He exclaimed. "So don't hold yourself so down, otherwise you'll drag yourself to an early grave, literally."

Dylan's eyes illuminated in the light, then he stepped away from his position, fluttering his wings in the process. His hands raised, making a wooden door appear, yet the seams around its edges seemed to glow, as if hiding a blinding light on the other side. Dylan went to touch the door, but paused and turned back to me.

"Listen, you've got a life to live. Don't waste it, life is a precious thing, so get back up there and live it well. We'll meet again someday, make sure that someday isn't some day soon." He rumbled, and with that, he pulled the door open and disappeared on the other side. With his disappearance, as did the door and the light beyond it.

I was left in silence, still reeling from the interaction, and my hand no longer aching in pain. If anything, I'd noticed that nothing was hurting, and my arm felt *right* again. Since first waking up, all of my damaged limbs had felt disconnected, like false limbs had replaced my old ones. But now, I could *feel* my arm again, and I could *feel* my legs again. I returned to my room, removing the cast on my arm using the knife, already expecting the blade to fail in piercing my flesh, doing the same for my legs.

In the end, my fiancé was horrified at what I'd done, but I was more relieved than ever. I'd gotten closure, I'd gotten an answer, and Dylan had left one parting gift; he'd taken the pain I'd received, and given me more peace than I'd had since before my accident.

However, I'd still been left with a sour taste in my mouth. By the morning of my 15th and final day in this hospital, I'd been left wondering, what was waiting on the other side? After all, there was clearly no heaven or hell, and if there was nothing like that, then what *was* there on the other side?

I guess it's a question I'll need to ask Dylan another time, because right now, I plan to take my fiancé, plan out my wedding, and get a honeymoon prepared. Because I'm going to take Dylan's advice. I'm going to live my life properly, and whatever awaits me on the other side.

I'm going to make sure I go there with a smile on my face, and a bucket list checked off.

So if you ever feel your *Visitor*, don't be afraid, it just means your time hasn't come yet. So take their presence as a reminder, life is precious, so you'd better start living it, or they'll need to snuff it out early, just because of how little there is for you to use.

Don't take it as a threat or a warning; take it as a reminder. Life might be fragile and limited, but it is precious and worth giving your all to experience.
