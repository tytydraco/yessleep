[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i3jsv1/comment/m892spt/?context=3)

About 3 months after my first shift, I was all trained up. I was posted as a Roamer for my first ‘solo’ shift. I say ‘solo’ because I wasn’t actually on my own, technically. When you are posted as a Roamer, you have a partner. When I was in training, I was always with Will so technically I was his partner. This is because, as the rules state, you have to bring a partner with you whenever you do a perimeter check or go outside the fence line. My partner that night was Val. Outside of our brief interaction on my first night, I hadn’t worked with Val all that much. She was nice and very helpful. We all joked that Val was the “mom” of the shift. When I got hurt (only minor scratches) after a fight with a drunk guy that was being booked in, she was the first one to yell at me for not going to see the nurse afterwards. I’m sure that if it wouldn’t have gotten her in trouble, she would have dragged me by ear to the medical office. “So Jay, how are you liking the job so far?” She asked. We were walking in from briefing together after getting our special assignment for the night.



“Good. Aside from all the annoying questions the inmates ask, I think I’m starting to get it.”  I said. “I got a question for you.”



“What’s up?” Val asked.



“So, Corporal D said that both Days and Swings reported outside calls coming in reporting a woman spotted in the woods just outside the perimeter.” I said. “Is this something that happens often?”



We stopped walking and Val looked at me for a moment. “Kinda.” She said, “We get calls about hikers, or hunters, or, hell, sometimes groups of teenagers hanging out in the forest all the time. This isn’t something too out of the ordinary.” She sounded like she was choosing her words carefully.



I looked at Val and could see something was bothering her. Corporal D had the two of us stay after everyone else. Our ‘special assignment’ was that we had to do a perimeter check once an hour. Normally there’s only 2-3 perimeter checks done per shift, once at the start of the shift and once towards the end of the shift, and, if nothing is going on, once in the middle of the shift. That night we’d be doing five times as much as normal. The assignment didn’t end with that, however. 



We technically have four perimeters. There’s the interior perimeter which is everything inside the interior fence (the fence that lines the yard). Then there’s the space in between the outer perimeter fence and the yard fence. We call this area ‘no man’s land’ since it's not used for anything other than emergency evacuation meeting points and access to maintenance closets. After that, you have the exterior perimeter, this refers to everything outside the fence that encompasses the entire facility. Normally, when we do a perimeter check, we start with an interior perimeter check. This is done by checking the recreation yard and interior fence, making sure the fence has no signs of damage or tampering and checking the entire yard for contraband and/or hazards.

When we do an exterior perimeter check, we ensure the exterior fence is intact and check for any possible contraband stashed outside. Usually these are the only checks done, but we were tasked with checking the fourth perimeter once every two hours as well. This is a fence that is about 100 ft into the tree line. It serves as a barrier separating the outer perimeter of the facility from the residential area about three-quarters of a mile behind the tree line. Unlike the interior and exterior fence, this one doesn’t encompass the property. Instead, it’s in a “L” shape and is only about 1000 ft long in total. It is only accessible on foot through roughly carved trails that line the fence. During daylight hours, it’s a beautiful hike through the forest. When the Sun is out, the thick tree canopy provides a pleasant balance between shade and visibility.

Don’t get me wrong, the forest surrounding the jail has an eerie feeling to it, regardless of the time, you always feel like you’re being watched or followed. At night, it’s straight out of a horror movie. Without a bright flashlight, it’s impossible to navigate since the thick tree canopy blocks any ambient moonlight. During my training, Will only showed me this fence one time, and that was when the sun was out. 



“Hey, you okay?” I asked.



“Yeah, why?” she replied.



Val was normally very chipper and talkative, but after hearing what our assignment was, she was acting off. “Just seems like this assignment is bothering you. Normally you’d be talking my ear off about the weekend, but you haven’t said much since briefing.” I said.



“I’m fine.” Val said. Her tone was uncharacteristically short.



The door into the facility slid open with a metallic clang, like it always does. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see Val flinch with the clang. “I’m going to set my shit down and check out my gear from Control.” I said. “I’ll meet you in the Yard at 2130 and we can start the first check.”



“Sounds good.” She said.



I went to the Control Room and checked out my radio, the keys to the personnel gates in the fences, and a flashlight. Corporal D handed me a different flashlight than normal. Usually, we get issued a generic run-of-the-mill flashlight, nothing special to it, just bright enough to see in the dark areas of a unit without waking the inmates. This one was a big ‘Fuck You’ flashlight. The bulb was at least 6 inches around and it was about a foot long. On the side of it read ‘100,000 Lumens LED’ in white lettering. “Woah, this thing is fucking huge.” I said.



“Yeah, we ordered that a couple months ago for perimeter checks and it arrived earlier today.” Corporal D said. “I turned it on in the admin office and it lit up the room like it was daylight. I think it should be sufficient for tonight. Just don’t lose it.”



“Well as long as it lights the way, it’ll work.” I said, “I’ll let you know how it works when I get back from this check. Hell, if you got nothing going on later, maybe you’ll join us for a check and see it in action.”



“We’ll see.” He said.



I turned and walked out of the room. After I secured the Control door behind me, I turned to see Will standing in the hallway. “Hey Will, what’s up?” I asked.



Will opened the door to the Attorney Visit room. A small room with no cameras for attorney client privilege. Supervisors would pull you into this room to have ‘unpleasant’ conversations. Officers, however, would use this room to talk without people eavesdropping. So, when Will motioned for me to step in the room with him, I knew something was wrong. “Jay, we need to talk.” He said making sure the door was closed. “You remember how on your first night, you asked me about the five rookies I lost?” he asked.



“Yeah, I remember you telling me that I wasn’t ready.” I said. “Why?”



“Val told me about your guys’ assignment tonight and what Corporal D reported sparked it,” he said. “Before you start these checks, you need to know something.”



“What are you trying to say?” I asked.



“You’re ready, Jay.” Will said. My demeanor changed from nervous to excited and I smiled ear to ear. “Don’t let it go to your head. This isn’t a good thing, but it is something you need to know.”



My smile vanished, “Oh, shit. Is it that bad?” I asked.

“Let me start from the beginning and you can make the determination after that,” he said. We both sat down at the table across from each other. “About two and a half years ago, I was in your shoes. I was let loose on my own and it was going great.” Will was staring down at his clasped hands that were resting on the table. “That was, until another rookie, Ryan, I got hired on with and I was tasked with checking in on a report of some kids running around in the trees on the perimeter. It was dusk and the air was still. We radioed in that we were beginning our check. It took us about ten minutes to reach the closest corner of the fence behind the tree line because we were joking around and horseplaying. By the time we got to the fence, it was dark. Like night time level dark. When I looked behind us out to the trail we came in on, I could see the sunlight still. It was like being two hours ahead of everyone else. We pulled out our flashlights and pushed on. After about a minute of walking, Ryan stopped. I could see he had squatted down and was looking at the ground in front of him.” Will paused for a minute and looked up at me. I could see on his face that he was searching for the words. “What’s rule number one Jay?”



“Don’t whistle at night.” I said.



“When I saw what he was looking at, I froze. There were dozens of child-size footprints in the dirt. Ryan stood up and we both heard a whistle. It sounded like when someone tries to mock a bird call. We looked at each other. ‘That sounded close,’ Ryan said. I shined my flashlight around, looking for the source of the whistle. After not seeing anything we agreed to push forward. We heard it again, this time we could tell it was coming from the left. Ryan shined his light to the left and I kept looking straight ahead. Again, we couldn’t find it and kept moving. There was another whistle, this time from the right. Same as before, we didn’t see shit.” Will looked back down at his hands. “You know what I didn’t realize until after everything?”



“What?” I asked.



“Aside from the whistling, there were no other sounds. Not even the sounds of our footsteps.” He said.



“How is that possible?” I asked.



“No clue, but out there, you’re in their world and the rules of our world don’t seem to apply.” Will looked back up at me, “After that last whistle, Ryan turned to me and said, ‘I’m going to try whistling back.’ I told him that was a stupid idea and pleaded with him not to, but he did it anyway.”



“What happened?” I asked.



“It was silent for a second after,” Will said. “Then, all hell broke loose. We heard running close by, but in all directions. I could tell we were being circled. The steps were so quick, it sounded like a low hum. Ryan turned to face me and began to back up. ‘Rule number five, Will. I’m not taking you down with me.’ I could hear the running getting farther away from me as he backed up.”



“What did you do?” I asked.



“I was frozen in place. I tried moving, but it was like something was holding me in place,” he said. “That’s when I heard it.” Will sighed, then stood up. “A voice inside my head. All it said was ‘He’s ours now.’ Then, silence. When I was finally able to move, I moved my light around trying to find Ryan. There were no footprints on the ground in front of me where Ryan was. I couldn’t bring myself to push forward, so I backtracked. While I was walking back to where we entered, I noticed something.” Will leaned back against the wall. “There was only one set of footprints on the trail. I can’t explain it, not then, and not now. When I came out of the trail, it was pitch black outside. I saw two people walking on the perimeter road with flashlights shining at me. ‘Will, that you?’ one of them asked. When they got closer I saw it was Corporal D, he was still an officer back then. They walked me back inside and that’s when I found out it was midnight. When Ryan and I walked out there, it was 2000. We had been gone for four hours, but it only felt like thirty minutes. They asked about Ryan, but all I could say was ‘they’ took him.” Will stepped up to the table and leaned in close to me. “Remember the rules and follow them, Jay. Three of the five rookies I was talking about all fell to the same fate. Learn from them, from me.”



“I won’t, Will. I promise,” I said. He nodded at me and we walked out of the room. When I looked at my watch, I saw it was 2130. “Shit, I gotta go meet up with Val in the yard. It’s time for the first check.” I split away from Will and began to walk out towards the yard.



“Stay safe. Let me know how it goes IF you come back,” Will said with a smirk.



When I got through the door leading out to the yard, Val was already checking the fence. “Look who decided to show up!” she yelled.



I radioed to Control that we were beginning the interior check and caught up with Val. “Sorry, I was talking to Will.” I said.



We finished with the interior check and I keyed into the personnel gate. “So, he told you about Ryan?” she asked.



I swung the gate open and we walked into ‘No man’s land.’ I called in the end of the first check and the start of the second. “Yeah,” I whispered.



“You okay?” she asked. I locked the gate back up and we began to walk along the interior fence. “I know it’s a lot to take in, but don’t let it get to your head. I need you on your shit tonight.”



“I’m good. I promise.” I said. I started to get this feeling of being watched the closer we got to the tree line. I turned on the flashlight and shined it at the exterior fence. “Holy shit, Corporal D wasn’t kidding. This thing is like having sunlight in your hand.”



“No kidding. It’s almost too bright,” she said.

Val was right. When I pointed the light at the chainlink fence, it reflected off the metal almost to the point of not being able to see past the fence. We walked in silence for a couple minutes before I was frozen in my tracks. I heard what almost sounded like whispering coming from just beyond the fence. “Did you say something?” I asked. 



“No, why?” asked Val. She stopped a few steps ahead of me before turning around.



“Could’ve sworn I heard someone talking.” I said. “Let’s keep going.”



“Yeah, the quicker we can get back inside the better. I’ll keep an ear out.” she said.



While we were walking, I could hear the wind blowing through the trees and crickets chirping in the bushes. Once we finished the second check and walked through the last gate and out the exterior fence, all the sounds vanished. It was like walking through a portal. I radioed Control that we were starting the final two checks and we started walking. After about two minutes of silence I looked at Val, “You hear that?”



“No, what are you–” She stopped herself mid sentence. “What the fuck.”



“Yeah, I know.” When we stopped walking, I noticed that we had finished the exterior check. “I know this is probably the last thing you want to hear, but all we have left is the back fence.” I looked at my watch to make note of the time, it was 2145. I turned my flashlight to the tree line and about 15 ft in front of us was the trailhead. “Fuck it.” I sighed before radioing to Control that we were entering the trail.



“Let’s get this over with.” she said.



We entered the trailhead and I kept the light pointing straight ahead. Even with how bright the light seemed outside the trail, we could only see about 10 ft in front of us. It was like there was a black sheet being held up at the end of the beam. As we walked along the trail, my eyes kept panning to the ground looking out for the little footprints Will told me about, but there was nothing there. “What’s that?” I said as I saw an orange landscaping flag on the ground. Written on the flag was ‘Confirmation Code: 36021.’ I had Val write down the code. “Let’s leave this here. Something tells me taking anything from here is a bad idea.”



“No argument here. Wonder why it’s here though. I’ve been through here a bunch of times and have never seen it before.” Val said.



“Looks fairly new. I’ll ask D about it when we get back.” We continued walking until we popped out of the trees at the other end of the trail about twenty minutes later. “Well, that was uneventful.” I said.



“Don’t get cocky, we still have more of those checks ahead of us.” Val said. “What time is it?”



I looked at my watch, “Strange,” I said. “My watch says 2145.”



“How is that possible?” Val asked. “We were walking for at least a half hour.”



I radioed Control that we were done with the final check and that we were heading back in. “Jay, Val, switch to channel three on your radios.” Corporal D’s voice came through. I looked at Val, shrugged and we both turned our radios to channel three.



“Jay radio check,” I said.



“Val radio check,” she said.



“Good copy on both.” Corporal D replied. “You guys actually need to do your check.”



“Corporal, we did. We’ve been walking for like half an hour.” Val said.



“There’s no way. Jay just radioed saying you just got to the trailhead. I know you might not want to be out there, but—” Corporal D cut himself off. “If you aren’t lying, do you have anything to report?”



“Yes sir, I found an orange landscaping flag.” I said.



“An orange landscaping flag?” he asked. “Anything special about it? We have contractors that leave them behind all the time.”



“Written on it was ‘Confirmation Code: 36021.’” I replied.



There was a long pause before the radio keyed up again. “Go back to channel one and meet me in Control.” Corporal D said.



We switched out radioes back and checked in with Control before heading back into the Facility. When we got to Control, Corporal D was sitting at his desk. “I need to know exactly what happened on that trail.”



“We entered the trailhead and just kept walking. About half way through I saw the flag and had Val write down the number. We walked for another 10-15 minutes before we exited the other end of the trail.” I said.



Corporal D paused for a moment, “And there was nothing else to report? No strange sounds, or anything out of place?”



“No, we didn’t see anything, and it was dead silent. That was the only weird thing,” Val said. “There was no ambient noise at all. Only thing I heard was our footsteps.”



“And you, Jay?” he asked.



“Same, aside from the flag, I didn’t see or hear anything.” I replied.



“Okay, well you got another check coming up here soon. Luckily, for you, it’s only the exterior check.” Corporal D said. “Since the report was about the forest, you don’t need to worry about either of the interior checks the rest of the night.”



“Sounds good.” Val said.



“Sir, why was that flag there?” I asked.



“I put that there about a month ago. Got word that one of the Day Shift guys was being accused of falsifying his early morning checks.” he explained. “If an officer takes too long for the check or finishes it too quickly, the code lets the supervisor on duty know if the check was legit or not.”



“Does this happen often?” I asked.



“It started to become a frequent thing about three months ago,” he said.



Corporal D turned around. Taking the hint that the conversation was over, I turned around and started to leave Control. “Let me know if you need anything else.” I said.



When I walked into the hallway outside of Control, I saw Val talking to Will. “Jay, you good?” Will asked.



“A little weirded out but overall, I’m good.” I said.



“Jay, are you sure?” Val asked. “You seemed shook up when you were talking to D.”



Val was back to her normal self and was now in ‘mom mode,’ “Yeah, I’m just trying to figure out what’s with all the secrecy.” I said.



Will put his hand on my shoulder, “Some things are better unknown. If it was important for you to know, they’d tell you.”



“Do you know?” I asked.



“Some of it, but they compartmentalize a lot of it.” Will patted me on the back and shot me a smile. “Don’t think about it too much, you got a long night ahead of you.”



“Yeah, guess you’re right.” I said. I looked at the time and it was already time for the next check. “Val, it’s time.”



Val gave me a nod and turned back towards Will, “See you on the other side,” she said.



“Stay safe,” he said.



I gave Will a fistbump, “We’ll try.” With that, Val, and I walked outside. “You wanna call it in?”



“Yeah I got it.” Val said. She pulled out her radio and notified Control that the check was starting. “Check your watch, make sure it’s working.”



We both checked our watches. “I got 2215. You?” I asked.



“Same,” she said. “Well, let’s get to it.”



We started walking. As I turned on the flashlight I checked the battery indicator. “Damn, this thing has one hell of a battery. It’s got this little screen that shows how long the battery will last and it changes based on the brightness selected.” I held up the flashlight to show Val. “Says at full brightness, it should last us about four hours.”



“Well that’s good,” she said.



We took the first corner and walked along the fence. As I was panning the flashlight from the fence to the trees, I thought I saw movement about 250 ft ahead behind some bushes. “Hang on, did you see that?” I asked.



Val stopped next to me and looked where I was shining the light, “Must’ve been a deer.”



“Well we’re heading that way, I didn’t get a good look at whatever it was.” I said. When we got to where the bushes I saw movement behind, I stopped and looked around. “I’m going to check behind the bush and see if I see anything.”



“Don’t go too far, Jay,” she said.



I got behind the bush and saw the grass behind it had been pushed down as if someone had just walked through there. “Looks like somebody recently walked through here.” I said. I knelt down and could see a set of footprints. “Well there was someone here. Looks like they were barefoot too.”



Val winced as I said it. “How big are the prints?”



I knew what she was getting at. “Looks to be adult sized. Small but too big to be a child.” Just then I heard a scream. “What was that?” I asked.



“Get out of there. I can’t see anything without the light,” said Val.



I was making my way back towards Val when we heard another scream. Something wasn’t right about it. It didn’t sound human. I’ve seen videos of cougar calls sounding like a woman screaming, but this didn’t sound like that either. “Val,” I said, “did something seem off about those screams?”



When I looked at Val, she was crying. “Let’s get the fuck out of here Jay.”



“Yeah, okay,” I said. I patted Val on her back, “Let’s go.”



We finished up our check. There were more screams while we walked, but with each one we walked faster. By the end of the check we were almost in a dead sprint. “Sorry.” Val whispered to me.



“Don’t be.” I said. I radioed to Control that we had finished the check and were coming back inside. “Are you okay?” I asked. When we came in, we walked through the Officer’s Wing. This was the side of the facility that had some admin offices, the breakroom, workout area (nothing fancy, just some dumbbells and one of those workout machines you would normally see in a hotel ‘gym’), Briefing Room/Conference Room, and two locker rooms ( one male, one female).



“I’ll be fine,” she said. “I just need a minute.” Val walked into the women’s locker room, and I walked back into the facility.



Right as the door closed behind me, Will was already walking towards me. “Where’s Val?” he asked.



“In the locker room, crying.” I said. “It was–”



I was interrupted by Officer Smith, an immature asshole who needs no further description, “What? You show her your dick out there?” He laughed. “I’d cry too.”



“Smith, shut the fuck up.” Will barked.



“Geez, was just fucking around.” Smith said. Thankfully he walked off. Maybe it was Will’s face turning red (a key sign that he is royally pissed) or maybe it was my ‘please let today be the day’ look, but he was gone.



“Fuck that asshole,” I said. “As I was saying, it was a rough check.”



“Yeah, I could hear the screaming when I stepped outside for some air.” Will said.



My eyes widened. “You heard it?” I asked.



“I counted five, were there more?” he asked.



“Yeah, about ten in total.” I said. “Anything sound weird about them to you?”



“Uh-huh.” Will nodded. “Haven’t heard anything like it before. Definitely not human, didn’t sound like any animal I’ve ever heard either.”



“It almost sounded like something trying to mimic someone screaming.” I said. Will looked at me with wide eyes, like I had found the missing piece of the puzzle. “What?”



“Like when we heard that woman screaming your name a couple months back?” He asked.



Then it clicked. It was the same scream we heard right before my name. “Holy shit.” I said. “I need to–”



Just then Val walked up to us. “Need to what?” she asked.



“Go back out.” I answered. “Whatever made that scream, is the same thing that scared the shit out of me on my first night.”



Val looked at Will, “Can you go with him? I can’t go back out there.”



“If the Corporal approves it.” Will said.



“You okay Val?” I asked.



Val looked at the ground for a moment, then at me. “Yeah I’m good now. I just can’t go back out there.”



“Jay, Val, come here.” I heard from behind me. I turned around to see Corporal D standing in the hallway. Val and I looked at eachother, then at Will. Will shrugged and walked away. “What happened out there?” asked Corporal D.



“Everything was fine until I thought I saw movement behind a bush.” I answered. “When I checked it out, I saw adult-sized footprints. Then we heard screaming but could not find the source.”



“Yeah I heard it too. Was I seeing things, or were you two in almost a dead sprint towards the last stretch of the perimeter?” he asked.



“We were,” Val said. “I told Jay we needed to leave and we started walking. That was until we heard more screaming. Jay looked around but each scream seemed to come from a different direction. That’s when we started running.”



I didn’t even think of it until then, but she was right. Each scream, after the first, came from a different direction. “You guys okay?” he asked. We both nodded ‘yes’ and Corporal D paused for a moment. “Good. You guys have a few before the next check?”



Val looked at her watch and her jaw dropped. “Jay, what time do you have?” she asked.



“2245,” I answered. Then, it hit me, we had been gone for over thirty minutes. “Corporal, what time do you have?” I asked.



Corporal D looked confused and checked his phone, “2245, same as you. Why?” I could see on his face that, right after the words left his mouth, it clicked for him too. “Fucking hell. How long do you guys think you were gone?”



I looked at Val, she looked like she was going to faint, “I don’t know, maybe ten minutes at the longest.” I said.



Corporal D looked at Val, “You need to sit down?” he asked. “You look like you’re gonna pass out.”



Val shook her head, “No, I’m fine. Just a little shocked.”



“Understandable,” he said. “I don’t know why, but time is acting weird out there.”



“You mind if I take Will with me on this next check?” I asked. Val shot me a look that I’m sure she wished would kill me.



“I don’t care.” Corporal D said. “As long as there’s two of you going.”



“Thank you sir,” I said. “I’ll let him know.”



Corporal D turned and walked away, “Sounds good. Be safe.”



Once he was gone, I looked at Val. “Sorry, I know you wanted to be the one to ask. I panicked after the whole ‘time issue’.” There’s an unspoken rule at my facility. If you or your partner want to switch tasks or posts with another officer, the officer that initiated the request is the one who asks. So for me to ask on Val’s behalf (especially as a rookie) could be taken as disrespect. “I wasn’t trying to disrespect you.”



“It’s fine, Jay,” she said softly. “I know you didn’t mean anything by it.” Val punched me on the shoulder, “Besides, I already called him before I walked back here.” She smirked at me and walked towards Intake. “Be careful out there,” she said, looking over her shoulder as she walked away.



Just then, Will walked up to me, “You ready?”



“Yeah, let’s go.” I said. I notified Control, then Will and I walked outside. “What time you got?” I asked.



Will pulled out his phone, I looked at him with wide eyes. We aren’t allowed to have our personal cell phones on us while on duty. “D approved it,” he said.



I wouldn’t snitch on Will for something so minor compared to what we were dealing with outside. “You know I wouldn’t say anything. Now I can’t slip you shit for it.” I said.



“I got 2250,” he said. I watched as he turned the stopwatch feature on. “Does your watch have a stopwatch?”



“Yeah. I got 2250 as well.” I said. I turned on my stopwatch. “You ready?”



“Ready as I’ll ever be,” he said.



I checked the battery of the flashlight, “Alright, battery says it’s got about three and a half hours.”



Will nodded and we started walking. As we rounded the first corner, Will stopped. “Hey, shine the light over there.” He was pointing to the right, at the tree line.



I did but didn’t see anything. “What’s up?” I asked.



“Thought I heard something,” he said. “Maybe I’m just paranoid.”



“Maybe,” I said. “Keep it up and I’ll hafta throw you in with the rest of the crazies.” I gave him a nudge on his shoulder. “Let’s keep going.”



“Ha ha ha. Very funny, Jay.” He said sarcastically. “Just, keep an ear out.”



We walked for another twenty feet before I saw something lying on the road up ahead. “What is that?” I asked.



Once we got within ten feet of it we both froze. “No no no no, there’s no way” Will whispered. “Ryan!” 



I grabbed Will by the back of his vest when I saw he was beginning to run towards the figure laying in the road. “Will, stop.” I said firmly. “We don’t know it’s actually him.”



“Fuck!” he screamed. Will was breathing heavily and I could see he was tearing up. Just then the figure started to move. “What the fuck man,” Will said.



We began to inch closer and I could see the figure better. There was no mistaking the uniform hanging off the sunken frame of the body lying there. “Call it in.” I said.



Will reached for his radio, but as he was putting it to his face the figure spoke. “H–help m–m–me p–pl–please,” as the last word left his mouth I heard Will drop his radio, “W–Will.”



When it reached its arm up in a plea, I saw the nameplate on the torn up vest it wore. It read ‘Ryan, P.’ There was no mistaking it now, this was Ryan. “Fucking how?” I whispered.



Will picked up his radio and called it in. We both ran towards Ryan. He was in bad shape. His hair was long and had chunks missing. His face was swollen, he had deep cuts that were infected and oozed a viscous white and green liquid all over his cheeks. Though his face was swollen, his eyes were sunken in. He was missing teeth and what teeth he did have were black and jagged. He looked extremely malnourished. The skin on his arms was sunken in revealing more bone than muscle. If it wasn’t for the jumpsuit he wore, his pants would be falling off. I’ve seen pictures of him from before he went missing. The Ryan that Will knew was well built. He had neatly cut hair, he styled a ‘high and tight’ haircut and was clean shaven. The figure in front of Will and I was not the Ryan everyone knew.



Corporal D arrived a couple minutes later and, upon seeing Ryan’s condition, promptly vomited into a bush. “Holy shit. Is that–”



Will cut him off. “It’s fucking Ryan, get a fucking medic now!” he shouted.



Corporal D hurriedly pulled his phone out, almost dropping it, and made a call. I couldn’t hear what he was saying, partly because I was paying more attention to Will and Ryan, but it didn’t sound like he was on the phone with 911. “Will, what’s going on? I don’t think D is getting EMS. Sounds like he’s talking to someone about Ryan.” I whispered.



This seemed to draw Will’s attention away from Ryan. “I don’t know.” He was looking at Corporal D and, knowing Will, was studying his body language. “You see that right?” he asked.



I looked at Corporal D, and watched him for a minute. He was pacing back and forth with his phone held up to his ear. “Seems normal to me.” I said. Then I saw what Will was talking about. Every few steps, he would peer over at us, but rather than showing concern, it looked more like he was suspiciously monitoring us. “What the fuck is he doing?”



“Not sure, but something isn’t sitting right.” Will said before turning his attention back towards Ryan.



After about ten minutes, an ambulance and a fire engine arrived and rushed Ryan onto a gurney. They hooked him up to an EKG machine as well as an oxygen mask. I was standing with Will next to the gurney when we heard Ryan speak. “I’ll be o–okay,” he said through labored breaths. “C–come see me in the hospital.” Corporal D handed his phone to the paramedic on the other side of the gurney from us. He put it to his ear, and after a moment I saw his eyes widen before looking at Corporal D. “Bring him too.” Ryan said, shakily lifting his hand to point at me.



Just then, the paramedics pushed Will and I back before they strapped Ryan down to the gurney with soft restraints (the ones that attach to the rails). Ryan looked at us, I could see the surprise and fear in his eyes. “What are you doing?” Will asked in surprise.



Corporal D looked at me and I could see the worried look on his face. “Who was that on the phone?” I yelled.



He walked up to me and said, “Jay, not now.”



As Ryan was loaded up into the ambulance, Will tried to get in, but Corporal D wouldn’t let him. After the doors closed, I could see one of the paramedics loading up a syringe. The lights and sirens kicked on and the ambulance left. A couple of the firefighters were picking up some equipment off the ground while they were getting back into the engine. “I haven’t seen them use a sedative like that for awhile.” I heard one say to the other as they walked back to the rig.



The three of us watched as the fire engine drove off. After the lights disappeared in the distance, I heard footsteps coming from the forest behind us. “You hear that?” I asked.



We all turned around and I shined the flashlight towards the trees. “I didn’t. What did you hear?” asked Corporal D.



“Footsteps,” I replied.



“Mhmm.” Will growled.



Will and I looked at eachother, “Outer fence?” I asked.



“Outer fence.” Will said.



“Let’s go,” said Corporal D.



We started walking and immediately after stepping off of the perimeter road and onto the grass, silence. I could see Will’s mouth moving, but I couldn’t hear anything. I motioned to my ear and shook my head to signal to them that I couldn’t hear anything. Corporal D motioned us to keep moving. As we walked closer to the trailhead, I could see the reflection of the fence about 20 ft in front of us. After about thirty seconds of walking, I noticed the reflection never got any closer. Then my ears popped, “Ow, that fucking hurt,” I said.



I stopped walking, Will stopped shortly after, “Fuck that stings.”



Almost immediately after Will, Corporal D stopped, “Shit!” he yelled.



We all looked at eachother, “Where’s the fence?” Will asked.



I turned the flashlight back to where we were walking to, “I swear the reflection from the fence was just there.”



Even with the flashlight, I couldn’t see more than a few feet in front of me. “That’s new,” Will said.



After panning the flashlight around, I saw a glint up ahead. “There it is, let’s go.” I said.



We started walking again. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Will turn around. “You hear that?” he asked. I handed the flashlight to Corporal D and turned around, walking backwards with Will. He already had pulled his flashlight and pointed the light straight ahead. “Sounded like ceremonial drumming.”



“I don’t hear anything,” I squinted my eyes to try and see where Will was looking but his light barely pierced through the void-like darkness in front of us enough to see maybe 10 ft in front of us. “You okay Will?” I asked.



“Yeah, I’m fine.” Will huffed. We turned around and continued walking. “So, you gonna tell us what that phone call was about?”



Corporal D dropped his head, “I can’t.”



Will stepped in front of Corporal D and stopped. His face was getting red, “Bullshit!” he yelled. “What’s with all the fucking secrecy D?”



“I’m already in deep shit for letting EMS show up fir–” Corporal D cut himself short. His eyes widened and his face showed that he let something slip.



“What the fuck do you mean first?” I yelled. Corporal D turned towards me. “Ever since I started, it feels like I need a top secret security clearance to know anything. Hell, I know even Will is keeping shit from me. I didn’t even know about Ryan until today.”



Corporal D shot Will a surprised look. “You told him about Ryan?”



Will looked like he was filled with boiling rage. Through clenched teeth, he growled, “With this perimeter check bullshit tonight, he deserved to know.”



Corporal D sighed, “Last time I checked, that’s not your job to decide.”



“So you were just going to send him on a suicide mission?” Will asked.



I could see Will balling his hands into fists. The look in his eyes showed he was ready for a fight. When I looked back at Corporal D, he looked dejected. “Corporal, what the fuck are you hiding from us? From me?” I asked. “Why am I not allowed to know anything about what’s been happening here?”



Corporal D broke. Tears flooded his eyes and he dropped to his knees. He set the flashlight on the ground and rubbed his eyes. “I–I can’t take this shit anymore,” he wailed. “Jay, it’s not what I wanted to do. I knew what Will was going to tell you the second I saw him pull you to the side.”



Will unclenched his fists and rubbed the bridge of his nose. “D, what the fuck is going on?”



I knelt down and picked up the flashlight. “We received a message last night,” Corporal D said, pulling his phone from his pocket. He opened up the media player and pressed play.
