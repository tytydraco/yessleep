Recently I got a dog off of Craigslist for free. The original owner didn’t tell me much but she did say the dog

was a stray she found when she was visiting her family in her home town. The poor thing looked really

malnourished in the photos and I really wanted to help the dog. So I talked to the person who had the dog

and she couldn’t be less useful I know nothing of this dog. At the time I didn’t think much about her lack of

information she provided me with and we scheduled to meet sometime 3 weeks ago and I got the dog. She

was pretty sweet but was huge, she looks like some sort of pitbull and maybe a Great Dane mix. I named

her Coco because she’s the same color as dark chocolate Anyway fast forward to 2 weeks ago the dog is

missing, I have no idea how since I have a fence with no holes at all, I make sure to patch them up

whenever I get one because my other dog Finley is an escape master. At this point I’m not sure what to

do cause I don’t have a collar for her and I haven’t microchiped her either. I thought my dog is never coming

back which really sucked cause she was a sweet girl. So I looked and searched to 8 days ago my dogs back

but she doesn’t look the same. It looked like she had cataracts she was acting very dumb and tired, she

would barely eat or drink, she was salivating a lot and she just didn’t seem ok. I brought her to the vet and

they said they had never seen anything like this before and they recommended another vet. 3 days later

Finnely started to get the same symptoms and I was starting to freak out I immediately brought both of the

dogs to the vet and they checked them both out. I had to leave them there over night and when I came back

the next day to pick them up turns out that Coco ate a deer that had a mutation of chronic wasting disease

she and she had contracted it. If you don’t know what that is let me explain. Chronic wasting disease is a

disease found commonly in deer, elk and moose populations, it damages portions of the brain and

slowly kills the animal. Both of my dogs contracted a mutation of this disease which 1.spreads easier, and

[2.is](http://2.is) more brutal than the original. The vet told me this mutation could spread to people and asked me if my

dog had licked my mouth which she did while she was giving me doggie kisses and she had accidentally

licked my mouth. Now I’m scared and sad because both of my dogs are gonna die and I might too. So I

went to bed worried af and had a very sad weekend. Then on Monday I woke up feeling terrible my vision

was blurry,I had a massive migraine and my pillow was soaking wet. I remembered the symptoms of my dog

and went to the hospital they brought me in tested me and asked me to stay longer for more tests I ended

up staying the night. Now that brings me to where I am now in my hospital bed writing this post the doctor

just informed me that I have officially contracted the same thing as my dogs and it’s going to be very hard to

live a normal life so I decided to so my goodbyes to my family and then just end it. If it wasn’t for those notes

I made while this was all happening I would have probably not been able to write this. Anyway good bye

hope you have a nice day.
