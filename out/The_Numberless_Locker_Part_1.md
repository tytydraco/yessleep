Every little town has their own scary story attached to them. Whether it’s a murder mystery about a serial killer who never got caught, or a “Don’t walk under the overpass at midnight”, or just a haunted house at the end of the road. My town has a haunted gym. Not a ghost or anything similar, but the building itself, more precisely - a part of it. A locker, at the corner of the men’s changing room behind an opening in the wall. You’d easily miss the lockers in that section of the changing room if you weren’t paying attention. But everybody who lives here knows about it, the stories surrounding that one locker. The numberless locker. Nobody uses it willingly and for good reasons. Whether you believe in scary stories or not, the realm of creepiness is a stranger to nobody. Stories range from people's gym bags disappearing if left in the numberless locker overnight, which is usually blamed on the janitor stealing them, to being a gateway to hell. But reality is far, far worse. 

My name is Alex. When I was twelve my family and I moved into a new town, which for obvious reasons will not be named. Me and my younger sister shared the misery of leaving our hometown. In hindsight, I was probably a shitty kid who didn’t care about anything in the world outside of friends and games. By all means, I should have been grateful for what I had, but being a twelve year old without a care in the world, this was the end. “New house, same home” my dad would say, ultimately knowing his efforts to cheer me and my sister up were futile anyways. And I don’t blame him, despite how appealing he tried to make it sound, I knew he didn’t want this either, for any of us. “A new opportunity” sounds a lot better than “forced to get a new job”. I can’t believe how strong someone can be for the sake of others, but my dad was a testament to that fact. 

“There’s our new home”, my dad said, pointing to a small white house. 

“It’s nothing fancy, but we’ll make it our home in no time”, said my mom, shooting a glance at both me and my sister. 

“I don’t like it here”, my sister said.

“Our old house was much bigger”, I said. 

“Give it some time, I’m sure you two will love it here once we get settled in", my mom said. "I heard the school serve ice cream once every month."

Not a word was uttered, and the only sound heard from miles away when we pulled into the driveway was my dads sigh. A comforting look was shared between my mom and dad as we all got out of the car. After what felt like an extremely nerve wracking and uncomfortably short house tour, a much required but heavy feeling of needing to be left alone for a second fell on everyone. After staying in my room for a while, exploring things to dislike, my dads presence covered the frame of the door.

“Listen kid, I know you’re upset about the move and all, but this could be the start of your new life. New places to explore, new friends”, he said. 

“I like the friends I have.”

“I know, I know. And I know nothing I say can cheer you up right now. So how about I take you around town and see if we can find something worth our while here?”

I have my dad to thank for always being able to help me out of a bad mood. We rolled around the town for a while, calling it small would be an understatement. Nothing caught my eye and my sour mood slowly crept its way back to me, until we turned a corner of an empty parking lot. A small, one floored building engulfed by abandonment immediately came into my view. It would have easily fallen into a realm of forgetfulness, yet, a lively colored sign clearly stated “Burberry Gym”, which was nothing short of a miracle to me at this point. Before you say anything, that’s not the real name, don’t bother searching for it.

“What about that dad? Think they’re open?”

“Aren’t you a bit young to start going to the gym?”

“You really want me to stay mad, huh?”

He chuckled as he turned the car towards the gym. The outside of the gym was as desolate and empty as the town of which it was housed in, covered in graffiti containing everything from slurs to inexplicable sentences. Litters of garbage and an assorted collection of trash cans coated the pavement surrounding the building, which gave nothing to save it from its sorrow. As sad and dark this place looked, this was the start of a new life for me, and I couldn’t wait to begin. 

The inside gave little to no salvation for what was expressed during my former introduction to the gym, but just the fact of “a gym” was intriguing enough for a twelve year old. The reception contained what looked like an extremely old yet lucidly alive man, like someone who was excited for the day to come yet fearful of what would happen next. He was large and cast an ominous presence over the room. Although my initial reaction to this man was skeptical, I could tell he was excited to see someone new arrive at his gym, and this made me both surprised and respectful of him.

“Welcome to Burberry Gym! My name is Louis and I am the owner of this fine establishment. Always nice to see new faces around here, now who might you two be?”

“We just moved here, I’m Matthew and this is my son, Alexander”, my dad responded as he put his hand on my shoulder.

“Nice to meet you sir, you can call me Alex.”

“Well Alex, I assume you’re the one I should speak business to. What brings you to my gym in particular?”

“Um, I’ve always been interested in lifting weights, and exercising, and… sports”, which was my attempt to avoid questioning. I failed. 

“Good try kid, you ain't’ fooling me here. You probably thought this was the only interesting place in this town, right?”, his words pierced me like a needle, and his eyes steadily observing me made it impossible to not feel uneasy. 

“Yeah, you’re right, sorry.” 

“Don’t you worry now, you are correct in your statement, kid. People have always been moving in and out of this town, but lately nothing has seemed to want to stay, whether it be for work or an escape from something else. The people who do live here work outside of town. Unfortunately this, as you may have seen, has made our fine town into a mere shadow of what it once was. Even my gym has a hard time employing folk, and the state of it suggests the truth. But don’t be afraid of its looks, for the spirit of hard work and dedication lives on within. And I believe you will fit in here just fine”

A loud crash followed by the sound of multiple things falling rang out from the hallway leading down to the gym. A skinny, tall frame was audibly muttering to himself as he picked up brooms and cleaning agents from the floor, quickly trying to avoid attention and pushing everything into an adjacent closet. 

“That's our janitor. I’m sure you’ll run into him multiple times during your visits here”. He leaned in closely and whispered loudly. “And between you and me, whatever rumors might circulate, truth may hide within”. He leaned back and without breaking a beat shouted to the man.

“Neil! Come meet our new customers”. 

The janitor came walking, dragging his feet and legs behind him, his head hunched back and his arms swaying weirdly by his side. With a grizzling look as if to scream resentment and contempt, he shot Louis a quick look before intently staring at me and my dad. Everything about this man made me feel uncomfortable.  

“Someone new for your cause?”, a dark voice muttered from within the man. 

“Come on now Neil, the kid just wants to lift some weights”, Louis mockingly stated, as if to shut down any intentions of further conversation from the skinny man. I swear I could see tears begin to form in the janitor's eyes, but the unease of these two men meeting loomed over everyone, making it hard to look up at any of them. My dad quickly saved the day, by remarking what a joy it is to have a gym available and that they’re willing to have me. 

“Alright, go on now”, Louis told the janitor with his chin up and arms crossed, as if everyone was depending on his departure. The janitor shot him a look once again, before turning his back and making his way to the locker rooms. Just as he opened the door, an uncanny face looked back at me before he entered the room. 

My dad and I were given a quick tour of the gym with the janitor nowhere to be seen at this point. Eventually we wound up in the boys locker room and, although he tried to hide it, Louis seemed to find it painful to be in here. 

“Now tell me, do you like scary stories, Alex?”, Louis curiously asked.

“I don’t know, not really my thing I guess”, I responded, shrugging my arms and trying to sound like a cool teenager.

“Well, I’ll tell you something that’ll make your skin crawl. You see that opening in the wall there, behind those lockers? There's an infamous locker in there, we call it the numberless locker. Some say, it’s where you put things you want to be forgotten. Some say, the numberless locker once housed ancient artifacts and got possessed. Some say, once you open it, you will never be the same. Since you’re a big kid, you don’t believe in hearsay such as these, do you? Now go on, why don’t you go check out that locker for yourself, and tell me, are you worthy of questioning the truth yourself.”

I was probably visibly scared at this point, but I couldn’t say no. After that monologue, my pride was on the line. I looked up at my dad who gave me a “I’m right here” look. I nodded to both of them and slowly made my way into the opening in the wall, towards the numberless locker. Its degraded look didn’t help me nor the rumors surrounding it. With trembling fingers I reached for the handle, painfully slow, feeling my heart beat out of my chest. The touch from the handle almost made me recoil from the cold it gave. Slowly, slowly, I started turning it, and then…

*BANG*

The ear deafening noise of a locker slamming behind me made me jump in my place and let out an immensely high pitched scream. I turned around to see my dad and Louis laughing loudly.

"HA! Welcome to Burberry Gym, kid! You made it! You are now officially a member of my gym!”

Life seemingly went on like normal after I got my gym membership. A few weeks passed without change. I had a hard time making new friends in school, being a new kid always makes you a target to avoid and our move being weirdly placed in the middle of a semester didn’t exactly help. Sitting alone at a lunch table became the new norm, and I didn’t mind, all I wanted was to remain unseen. After some time I forgot about my gym membership too, I didn’t really have the motivation to begin with anyways and self-discipline can only get you so far. One day during lunch, another boy sat down at my table across from me. He looked like any other forgotten kid who’s only wish was to remain so, yet here he was, disturbing my solitude. As soon as he sat down, I could feel the eyes of other kids surrounding me stare down my neck and begin to whisper. And I know he could feel them too.

“Sorry, there was no other table available”, he said, staring down at his food, trying his best not to make himself a burden to anyone.  

“It’s okay, I guess.” I tried as best I could to not make it look like I really didn’t want him here. Not being able to make friends was one thing, but having the other kid’s disapproval hovering like a shadow over me because of this kid seriously diminished my hopes of ever feeling like I could have a normal adolescence. All of those feelings were now projected against him, which I knew was extremely unfair, so I figured I should try to level the mutual barrier of isolation between us. 

“Do you like any games?”, I awkwardly asked. 

“Yeah, um… I have a bunch of pokemon cards”, he said. 

“Oh, I meant like, on playstation and such”.

“I wish, my family couldn’t afford one”. 

Silence fell, no one really knew what to say. But as far as awkward first interactions go, this was not the worst, and I managed to make our way out of it. 

“My favorite starter is bulbasaur”, I proudly said.

“No way man! Mine’s charmander, he’s the coolest!”

“What, just cus’ he’s a fire type?”

“Duh!”, he proudly proclaimed, as if it was a mere fact. I chuckled and stared back down at my food.

“You know, I just recently moved here, and I don’t have any friends, you should spend your time with your friends instead of me.” 

“I don’t have any friends either, nobody likes me”, Jason said. The other children's whispers and stares became eardeafingly loud and apparent. Silence was upon us once again, but this time it wasn’t broken by me.

“You know, I just recently got a neighbor.”

My head snatched up and our eyes met in a “I know that you know” kind of stare. We burst out laughing and now we definitely had everyone's eyes in the cafeteria on us. 

“My name's Jason!”

“I’m Alex.”

This, was definitely the start of a new life for me.
