Her name was Lami.

She was sixteen, born in a tiny forgotten village where dreams usually died before they were even spoken. Her mother had died giving birth to her, and her father – a bitter, broken drunk – never saw her as a daughter. To him, she was only a burden, a debt he never asked for.

Their house leaked when it rained. Their plates were almost always empty. And somehow, it felt as if the whole world had quietly decided that Lami’s life was meant to be hard.

Yet she was beautiful.

Painfully beautiful.

Even wrapped in faded clothes and silence, she carried a kind of softness that made people stare. Her eyes were large and sad, her skin warm like honey, her voice gentle as evening wind. Men looked at her with hunger. Women looked at her with jealousy. And fate seemed to enjoy playing cruel games with her life.

One evening, her father stumbled home drunk, his face swollen from a gambling brawl. He didn’t look at her like a child. He looked at her like a solution.

“Lami,” he slurred, barely able to stand, “tonight you will bring me luck.”

She didn’t understand—until two well-dressed men entered their hut. One of them placed a heavy bag of money on the table. Her father nodded eagerly.

Lami screamed. She begged. She clung to the doorway.

But a cloth was pressed against her face, and the world went dark.

When she woke up, the air smelled of perfume, sweat, and burning candles.

She was lying on a red velvet bed in a room she had never seen before. A tall woman dressed in black lace stood beside her, smoking a cigarette.

“You’re awake,” the woman said coldly. “Welcome to the House of Silk.”

Lami sat up in terror. “Where is my father?” she whispered.

The woman laughed. “Your father sold you, dear. You belong here now.”

She crushed the cigarette into a glass and stood. “You’re very beautiful. The richest men will fight for your first night.”

Lami screamed until her throat burned. For days she refused to eat, refused to speak, refused to accept what had happened to her.

Another girl, Halima, barely seventeen, whispered to her one night, “Don’t fight it. Fighting only makes it worse. Just pretend you’re not here.”

But Lami couldn’t pretend.

Every night she prayed to die. Every morning she woke up to the same nightmare.

Then one evening, Madam Zara—the woman in black lace—entered her room holding a long white dress.

“Tonight is your debut,” she announced. “A very important man has paid twenty million naira for your first night. You should be grateful.”

Lami fell to her knees. “Please,” she begged, “I’m not ready.”

Madam Zara slapped her hard across the face.

“You are ready when I say you are.”

At midnight, the man arrived.

He was powerful, respected, and feared. Some said he was a senator. Others whispered that he was involved in dark rituals.

He entered the room with a confident smile and locked the door behind him.

Lami sat trembling on the bed in the white dress that felt more like a funeral shroud.

“You’re beautiful,” he said, removing his shirt. “Don’t worry. The pain will pass.”

But the moment he touched her… something changed.

The candles flickered violently.

The air turned ice cold.

A strange smell filled the room—like ash and blood.

The man froze. “What is that smell?” he asked.

Before Lami could answer, the lights went out.

There was a choking sound. A horrible, gurgling breath.

When the lights returned, the senator was on the floor.

His eyes were wide open. Foam covered his lips. His skin had turned dark, as if burned from the inside.

Lami screamed.

The door burst open. Madam Zara and two guards rushed in.

“What happened?” Zara shouted.

“He… he just fell,” Lami sobbed. “I didn’t even touch him!”

But the guards refused to go near the body.

“Madam,” one whispered, “her eyes… they’re glowing.”

Zara slowly stepped back.

Tears ran down Lami’s face, but there was something strange in her gaze—something ancient and powerful.

“Please,” Lami whispered, “I don’t want anyone else to die.”

Then a soft laugh echoed through the room.

Not from Lami.

From the air itself.

The lantern went out again, and a voice spoke from the darkness.

“I swore an oath before she was born. Any man who tries to harm my child will pay with his soul.”

Zara screamed and grabbed a knife—but the blade turned to dust in her hands.

A white light burst from Lami’s chest, turning slowly into deep blood-red.

Behind her appeared the figure of a woman made of smoke, eyes burning like coal.

“Who… who are you?” Zara cried, falling to her knees.

“I am Iru,” the voice answered. “Once worshipped by ancient tribes. The guardian of betrayed and violated virgins. When the world forgot me, I placed my spirit inside this child so I could watch… and take revenge.”

Lami stared at the glowing figure.

“Are you… my mother?” she whispered.

“A part of me lives in you,” the spirit replied. “You are human and divine, purity and shadow. But now you must choose—stay with me and walk the path of vengeance, or return to the world as a human: fragile, but free.”

Lami looked around the room.

At the chains.

At the fear.

At the life that had been stolen from her.

Then she thought of her village, of the fields where her mother had died, of the simple dreams she once had.

Slowly, she whispered, “I want to live. Not for revenge… but to forgive.”

A warm wind filled the room, carrying the scent of wildflowers.

The spirit smiled and touched her forehead.

“Then go. But remember—my blood still flows in you. If anyone ever hurts you again… I will return.”

And just like that, the goddess vanished.

The next morning, the doors of the House of Silk were found wide open.

Lami was gone.

That very night, during a violent storm, the brothel burned to the ground. No one ever discovered how the fire started.

Weeks later, a madwoman in the marketplace claimed she saw a young girl in a white dress walking through the rain, eyes sad but peaceful, whispering:

“Freedom smells like tears… but it also smells like life.”

No one believed her.

But from that day on, whenever poor girls were about to be sold for money, people said they sometimes heard a distant song in the darkness.

And the men—terrified—would run away.

They began calling it **Lami’s Oath**—

The oath of the girl chosen by a goddess,

So that no one would ever dare to touch an innocent soul again.
