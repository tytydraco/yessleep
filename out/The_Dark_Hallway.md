My best friend and i spent in our childhood nearly every single day together. Her mum worked at Mc Donalds until 6 p.m and had mostly only at weekends her days off, so it was really nice for my best friend either not to be alone during that time.

One day after school my best friend and i went to her apartment to spent the day there, do our homework, play a bit of Final Fantasy X-2, both our favorite game back then and it was just an average day like always.

The living room of my best friend was super cozy, there was a big TV and her Playstation 2 on a black TV stand, just right next to shelves filled with plushies, clothing of her mum, toys, snacks, more console games and tons of make-up, lipsticks and more. Opposite the TV, around 3 meters away was a huge, super comfy orange couch, where we both could lay down and enjoy the day together with lots of pillows, blankets and even more plushies. There we also played our Playstation games. 

But on the right side of the TV/Shelves was the entrance to the dark hallway, where all rooms were connected and also the main entrance was located. The hallway had no windows, the entrance door was a solid wooden door without any windows, too and every other door was also shut. So the hallway was pitch black and you could not see anything in there without turning on the light. 

At this day we left the living room door into the hallway open, but just with a little gap, maybe half or a third of an arm. When sitting on the couch, the hallway was on the far right side of your field of view, just a bit outside of it, so you did not really have it in your vision.

My best friend was playing the game while i was doing my homework when i suddenly saw a face/shadow looking at us straight from the hallway, but then when i was directly looking at the opened door, it vanished to the right side swiftly. I did not think a lot about it at first, maybe i was just seeing things. Then i wanted to scare my best friend and i put on a terrified, shocked voice and told her about a shadowy figure i (thought) i saw in the hallway...

She did not believe me and told me i should not be silly, but then i said it directly stared at us and it was a face with two dark, empty eyes. This creeped her out massively and she stood up and said i should also come now that we check it out.

When we entered the hallway, my best friend tried on switching the lights when it suddenly happened ... the light lit up in a bright flash, shattered and died down, 3 seperate bulbs just exploding above our heads. Now we both screamed absolutely terrified and we ran to the balcony into bright daylight, where my best friend called her mum with her phone, who was thankfully already on her way back home.

We waited for her to come home and did not leave the balcony again until she was there. 

To this day i am still terrified of thinking about this event. I'm not sure exactly what that thing was that looked at us or why the lightbulbs in the dark hallway exploded. I have read being severly scared could also affect your surroundings, so maybe my best friend being utterly terrified caused that by emotions/her aura/energy, too. 

But maybe there was indeed something watching us and this "thing" i saw made the lights explode. Since that day i never ever tried to scare anyone ever again by telling ghost stories or mocking something that i "maybe" really saw.

Cause i think if you mock such things, you could indeed summon them and it could turn out pretty bad. Maybe this is not the most scary story ever, but we were just kids and it affected our personality up to this day!
