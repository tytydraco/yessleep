“What is this place?” I asked Kiki. 

“It used to be the subway stop for city hall,” Kiki said. 

Kiki was a militant lesbian who also worked as a high-class escort specializing in bondage and sadomasochism. She was also an “urban explorer”. Urban exploration is “the exploration of manmade structures, usually abandoned ruins or hidden components of the manmade environment.” (I’ve run up quite the intellectual debt to Wikipedia.)

We met because she was auditing a textile/surface design class at my fashion institute. Kiki is the coolest human being I know. She is also super hot, and since I am the opposite of super hot, I appreciate that she hangs out with me. I’m not jealous of her at all.

She sparked up a joint and took a pull before offering it to me.

“No thanks,” I said. She shrugged. I felt uncool. It happens.

We were in what looked like a railway depot for ancient trains. Straddling the tracks was a walkway with one steeply curved wall that started at the floor on one side and arced all the way to the floor on the other side. The vaulted ceiling was frescoed in scenes of what was once called progress—skyscrapers being built, steamships teeming with immigrants pulling into harbor, men in formal dress shaking hands with indigenous tribesmen. The whole arcade was smattered with glittering tiles and colored glass.

“I guess it’s true,” I said, “they really don’t make them like they used to. You’d think that the city would open this for people. I bet you could charge admission to this place.”

“Doll, if I could teach the municipal government anything, it would be that you should always make someone pay anytime they enter one of your orifices.” Kiki’s smile was mischievous.

I clicked my tongue and rolled my eyes. “Not everything has to do with peddling ass,” I said.

“No, you’re right. There’s also the weather.”

I heard an alert from Kiki’s phone. “You need to take that?” I said.

She took her phone out of her pocket and checked it. “Shit. Speaking of. One of my regulars just opened up.” Kiki sighed. 

“Some old dude?” I said.

She groaned in exasperation. “I have to go.” She tucked her phone in her jeans’ back pocket. “You coming with?”

I looked behind me at the rest of the arcade I hadn’t yet explored. I turned back to Kiki. “You know, I think I’m going to look around a little bit longer. But I’ll meet you for drinks tonight if you’re free after your thing?”

“You got it, slut.” Kiki came and grabbed my skull before planting a kiss on my lips.

I laughed. “You know, I could charge you for that.”

Kiki skipped out toward the exit and called back, “No way, I got loyalty points!”

“Bye!”

•

I heard laughter coming from far away down the tracks, somewhere in the distant darkness.

I went to go look.

I’ll spare you the cheap suspense of me walking through the tunnel’s darkness. I got where I was going.

I came to an arched entryway. Beyond it, I saw a huge, open concourse, with vendors’ stalls around the sides and zig-zagging through the middle. I looked up at a wooden sign hanging from the archway on two pieces of frayed rope. The sign read, GHOULS’ HYPOGEAN BAZAAR.

I walked in and started browsing. The place was wild. A tiny old lady wearing a peasant’s babushka was selling live monkeys. Another stall was lined with refrigerators, a cardboard sign in front advertising, CRYOPRECIPITATE AND UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE.

I passed by a tent filled with middle-aged women, all of them at least six feet tall. They were dusky, every one of them with a severe hunchback, and formed a circle around two of their kind, who were in the middle of playing some strange variation of craps that involved slaughtering a live chicken. Elder worthies sat on stools outside the circle and toothlessly screamed while throwing brown liqueur on the competitors (at least I hoped that’s what it was).

I came to the edge of the market. A lonely brick-and-mortar shop stood apart there, from all other commerce. Outside the shop there were empty brass cages that looked like they belonged in a nineteenth-century millionaires menagerie of animals he bought on safari. There were chained manacles and steel water bowls inside of each cage. I looked at the storefront window. These characters were written on the glass in gilt lettering: ⲃⲱⲱⲛ ⲥⲁ ⲛⲁϥ.

I walked inside through a flap made out of a pungent-smelling rawhide.

An old woman sat behind the counter. I had the unexplainable feeling that she’d been sitting there waiting for me. She looked at me. “Yes?”

“Hi, what is this place?”

“Skin care and beauty supply.”

“Oh. What kind of products do you sell?”

“For you, only one,” she said.

“What does that mean?”

She creaked up off her seat on ancient bones. She was the tallest human being I’d ever seen. Her flesh hung slack, as loose as someone’s who’d fought morbid obesity their whole life and finally won.

“It means, Jerrica, that if you want to buy something here, there is only one thing I will sell you.”

The lady knew my real first name. Nobody at school even knew my real name.

“What is it?” I asked.

The giantess turned around and reached in a coat rack right behind her. She pulled out what looked like a barn coat made out of rawhide. She draped it over her arm with her opposite hand, and offered it to me for inspection.

“Can I touch it?”

She nodded down at me. “By all means.”

I touched the coat. It was so, so soft. An electric thrill ran a circuit around my body. I smelled jasmine. My fingers were numb. I felt like I’d just had the most restful sleep. Something prodded my pleasure center, too. It was like sexual titillation combined with opioid intoxication.

“Can I try it on?”

“Yes,” the saggy gray giant said, “but I should tell you it’s only for rent. I rarely sell something outright.”

“Why?”

“Let’s have you try it on.” She came behind me and held the coat. I slid my arms back into the sleeves.

The rawhide touched my body and I orgasmed. Pleasure wracked my body as I fell to the floor. I tasted something like a rich, rich chocolate cake in my mouth. An atomic pleasure bomb had been dropped in the middle of my brain.

The old giantess watched me but seemed indifferent to my embarrassing display. When I was done and had (some) control over my body again, she held out her hand. I took it and she helped me to my feet.

“I’m sorry,” I said. I couldn’t look her in the eye. My face burned red with shame.

She reached down and hooked a gnarled finger under my chin, pointing my face up at hers. “A woman should never have to apologize for her own pleasure. Never.” Then she turned me around toward a body-length mirror.

And I saw I was transformed. 

I was still me, but I was…

Beautiful. Like I was my own fraternal twin who’d won the genetic lottery. A perfect figure instead of the chubby pear I snuck under sweats, a pouty heart-shaped face like a girlish actress instead of, as my brother Tyler put it, “Larriette the Female Cable Guy”. Everything about me was stunning. I had eyes to sink empires.

My legs buckled as I felt an aftershock between them.

“What…” I might have said, but I couldn’t be sure. I was insensible.

“You’ll take it,” the giantess said. She wasn’t asking.

“Yes.”

“I suggest you not wear it outside your home until you’ve had time to adapt.” My incomprehension must have been obvious, because she added, “Unless you want people to see you climaxing in the middle of the street.”

I nodded. “Okay. But, um…”

“You’ll still look the way you look right now. Beautiful. At least long enough for you to get home.”

I stared in the mirror. I was attracted to myself, in the most biblical sense. How was that possible? “How did you make this?”

“Here, give it to me. I’ll wrap it up for you. Your rental will last exactly one week.”

•

The giantess escorted me outside her shop. What I saw shocked me. 

Inside the brass cages there were now naked women. They were lapping at their steel bowls like animals. All of them had defecated in their cages. Many were missing teeth. 

These captives wailed like dogs left too long in their cage at the pound. Their legs were bloody and raw from the manacles’ friction. They were so filthy that I had to hold my nose. The sight was horrible, the smell was worse, and the noise of their anguish was unbearable.

I looked up at the giantess, my face warped with shock. “What the hell is this?”

“These are my debtors. They don’t concern you. My business with them is my own. Besides, they consent to being here as repayment on their debts.”

“You can’t do this!” I knew my voice was too whiny, too meek for a liberator’s task. I braced my newly-trim gut and said with as much firmness as possible, “This is disgusting. I’m calling the police.”

The giantess was unfazed by my threats. She simply plucked from my hand the bag carrying my new coat, before I could even react. “Fine,” she said, “but I’m taking the coat.” She turned to walk back inside her shop.

I panicked. I wanted the coat. No, I needed the coat. “Wait.”

She turned toward me again. “Yes?”

I looked back and forth between the women in the cages and the old sadist holding my coat. That was how I was already thinking of it: *my* coat. I couldn’t leave it behind.

Well, I could call the police if I needed to once I’d left the bazaar. “They’re here voluntarily? They can leave if they want?” I said.

The giantess had a smile both cold and cruel. “Oh absolutely, darling. Absolutely. This debt forgiveness program is purely voluntary. All above board.”

I promised myself I would call the police the instant I was a safe distance from the Ghouls’ Hypogean Bazaar.

•

I went out that night wearing my rawhide coat. Self-consciousness was inevitable, with the garment being so rustic and strange. I worried people would see me as a weird bumpkin dressed for a southwestern ranch, somehow stranded here in the big city.



If anyone even noticed my coat, they said nothing. Men and women (both) were too busy falling over themselves to buy my drinks. A wardrobe critique was not in the works.



I went to a club I’d always been too intimidated to even get in the queue for. You know the kind of place I’m talking about; only certified nines and tens past the velvet rope, eights allowed only if they were a big enough name for TMZ on TV.



I danced with people who were the sort of beautiful you only saw in advertisements for *haute couture* and French fragrance, not in the flesh. I had sex only in public places that night, or at least in places where many people could see me. I snorted things and burnt things and ate things; sweated, screamed and danced.



And as I did all this, and caught my reflection in every shiny surface, I fell more and more in love with a new, beautiful me. Sliding up and down on a man’s waist with his back to a bathroom mirror, I stared at myself, looked into my own eyes. And I caused myself to orgasm by my own new and foreign beauty. The intensity of my self-possession was such that if I’d seen my reflection in a pool, I might have died trying to kiss myself.

Only one thing made me hesitate. Far off, in each reflection, I thought I saw the filthy, emaciated bodies of the naked women in the brass cages of the bazaar. I couldn’t see them directly, but I could hear their chains and manacles rattling, and the terrible wails that they’d made inside their excrementitious cages.

I forgot to call the police—ask me how I could forget such a thing, but nevertheless, I did. But I saw them, or sensed them, in the reflections of car windows and sidewalk puddles, in the gleaming curves of sleek German cars, and in every reflective surface otherwise. It felt like they were waiting, seeking to break through. And they seemed so very hateful to me.

I was afraid of them, the naked women in chains. I was so afraid of them, that when I left the club and returned home, I decided that I wouldn’t call the police after all. I didn’t know what I saw in those cages, I decided. And besides, I had a new life to live.

I tried calling Kiki the next day to share the good news, to invite her over to see my transformation, but her phone sent me straight to voicemail.

•

One week was too short a time to keep the coat. I needed for it to be mine. I went out every night, desperate to accumulate a track record of hedonism. I felt a lust for my own image, like I was a self-obsessed idolater. Even though I was accepted and desired by the most beautiful people in the city, it was my own flesh and likeness I needed more of. I decided that I needed to keep the coat, no matter the cost.

And when I settled on that decision, that was also the first time I saw one of the naked women in chains directly in a mirror’s reflection.

I tried calling Kiki again, but it went straight to voicemail again.

•

When five days’ time had passed, I had my textile/surface design class. I looked for Kiki, but she wasn’t there. I called her again, having sent innumerable text messages. I heard a new message. Instead of notifying me that the caller’s voicemail box was full, Kiki’s cell service provider informed me that the number I was calling was no longer in service, to please check that I’d called the right number before trying to call again.

I’d like to say I was deeply concerned about Kiki, and her disappearance (though I didn’t allow myself to admit that that was what had happened), but the notion of returning the coat to the giantess disturbed me more than any missing “friend” ever could.

I decided that the next day, I would go back to the bazaar and speak with the giantess. 

•

It took some doing, but I found it again. I passed the sign reading GHOULS’ HYPOGEAN BAZAAR and entered the concourse.

There were still stalls all over, but they were either poorly tended or seemed to have been abandoned. I passed by where I’d seen the dusky women playing their strange game of poultry and dice, and there was only one of the old, toothless ones. She looked at me and cackled like a lunatic, threw some of her brown liqueur at me but, mercifully, she missed. 

Everything was similar, but it had all decayed. It was not the bustling souk of foreign objects and strange sellers I’d seen before.

There was only one thing that seemed better down here in the bazaar, and it was that when I saw a reflection down here, I did not sense the naked women in chains lurking somewhere distant inside it.

I found the giantess again. I can’t describe the relief I felt when I came into view of her shop at the edge of the now-empty market, and saw there was only one brass cage. I allowed myself to be deluded with the hope that those filth-smeared naked women had been freed.

I entered the giantess’s shop through the pungent-smelling flap of rawhide, and the giantess was sitting behind the counter waiting for me, just as she’s done before. Her smile was deep and mean.

“Ah,” she said, clasping together her overlong fingers like knobby chicken legs eaten down to the bone, “you’re back. And you look more beautiful than ever, darling! I was worried you wouldn’t be back in time to return the coat.” 

“I’m back,” I said through teeth gritted in rage. The woman knew exactly what she was doing, I thought. She knew it would be agony to return this coat.

“All’s well that ends well. Go ahead and take it off, and I’ll get you a receipt.” She stood up behind the counter and pawed around, I presumed, for her receipt pad.

“What happens when I return it to you?” I said.

The giantess continued “searching” among her things, making a show of picking up and putting down and rearranging things. She didn’t look at me when she answered me and said, “Why, then I’ll have it back, I suppose.”

“No. I mean, what happens to me?” I felt my throat tightening and wettening and my sinuses watering up. I was going to cry.

“Oh.” The giantess was trying to sound ponderous, I was sure, as if she’d only thought about my question right at that moment, that what happened to me or anyone else who’d returned the coat after having it for a short time had only crossed her mind today for the first time. She looked directly at me, suspending the ruse that she was searching for something (I doubted very much this woman had a moment in her whole life where she didn’t know where to find exactly what she needed and owned). “I’m afraid you’ll be a dowdy, chubby, ugly little duckling again.”

Her words stung. I tried to keep from crying. “I want to keep it.”

“You want to keep it?” she said.

“YES!” I practically screamed at her. I was unhinged. The idea of becoming a fat, nerdy undesirable again seemed like catching a disease. I was revolted by my former self. I couldn’t go back to that. “Yes,” I said, repeated in a much softer tone. “Please. Please, I would like to buy it.”

The giantess sighed and crossed her arms. “You certainly do seem very attached to it.”

I nodded. “I’d do anything to keep it.”

She stretched to her true and full, terrible height, and it looked to me like her eyebrows might raise almost to the ceiling. “Anything?”

“Yes.” I repeated myself again. “Yes, I’d do anything to keep it.”

“Then all you have to do is tell me, darling,” she said as she came around the counter. Her sagging skin rustled in an invisible breeze and her sockets darkened under shadows that cut against where light, not shadow, ought to have been. “Tell me one more time, and mean it with everything in your heart.”

The declaration I made to her was spoken with more honesty and more deep feeling than I’d ever given of myself to anything else in my whole life. “I would do anything to keep my—” I faltered, realizing my overeager mistake. I cleared my throat and held back tears and corrected myself, and said, “I would do anything to keep this coat.”

The giantess grinned, her teeth sharper than I remembered, and a yellow the color of putrid exudate. “Okay, Jerrica. The coat is yours.” She held out her hand for me to shake.

I came around the counter and, instead of shaking her hand, I fell to my knees in front of her. I allowed myself to sob in relief. I thanked her again and again and again.

•

When the giantess escorted me out of her shop, I saw a woman in the one brass cage that still remained. She wasn’t as dirty as the ones I’d seen before. And, I realized, I could recognize the tattoos on her body. It was Kiki.

I ran to the bars of the cage and reached through them. “Kiki! Kiki, what happened?”

And when Kiki looked up at me, I didn’t see the fleet eyes and streetwise glamour that animated her before. I saw a dirty, dumb animal. If Kiki recognized me, I couldn’t tell. She thrashed against her chains and bit at my hand, catching me on the knuckle and taking off a chunk of flesh. I leapt back and fell on the floor.

The giantess saw this and laughed. She laughed in a way that told me she could only ever laugh at another’s pain.

I wiped tears from my eyes. “Kiki…” I said.

And then Kiki started mocking me, but not like a human would. She mocked me like an ape trying to imitate someone mocking me would do. She tried grunting her name back at me in the dumb pan-flute-sounding pant-hoot of a wild chimpanzee: “Kik. Kok!”

When she couldn’t get her name right, the giantess laughed so hard that she was wheezing. Falling over herself in laughter, she screamed out, “Try again, dear!”

Kiki tried to imitate the laughter of the giantess, and the sound was from a living nightmare. Her and the giantess shrieked laughter together, Kiki in her idiot imitation of the giantess and the giantess with a sound like love for evil.

When Kiki started throwing her feces at me, I ran.

•

I got home and I cried. And then I fell asleep in my new coat.

I was awoken in the middle of the night by the sound of chains. I sat up in bed, and heard their heavy metal links dragging on the floor. I knew what the sound was.

I covered myself in my bedsheets and trembled.

The chains dragged along the ground, and their scraping and clanking got louder and louder.

The bedsheets were ripped from over top of me. I looked up and saw the naked women from the cages, standing in their chains, unmanacled to any cage. I saw Kiki standing there with them, her body cleaner than theirs but still stinking of shit and piss, and the vague pheromonal scent that the insane carry with them. The women shrieked and shrieked, and I screamed for help.

But I’d hardly opened my mouth when the first woman’s chain struck me in the mouth. I felt teeth shatter. Another one lashed me with her chain, and it struck my eyebrow. A burst of blood showered over my face, and I was sure that my eyebrow had been whipped off. They beat me and beat me. It was the unrestrained blood orgy of animals. And while they were beating me, I heard Kiki screaming out with every flail of her heavy metal chains against my body and face: “Kok! Kik! Kok!”
