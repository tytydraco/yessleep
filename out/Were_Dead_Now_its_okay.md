Time doesn't quite stand still in prison; it crawls on scuffed knees and pin-pricked fingertips. Its only 24 months into my sentence, and I don't talk or think about how long I have to go anymore. It only weakens my routine. After I shanked that chi-mo last year, everything's been better for me. Thank god he didn't die, and he didn't name names. I was put in solitary for a spell. Everyone that needed to know knew it was me, but I didn't catch another charge. 

The only people that gave a shit were the big girls that used to come after me. They leave me be, now. It didn't stop some word getting to the outside, somehow, cos I've consistently been getting fan letters and gifts. I think the gifts are from the guards, though. I don't know how they would get me some of this shit in here, otherwise. I always give it away. I just need the notebooks and pencils. I was a writer once. I don't know what I am anymore. 

They set me up with a therapist that suggested I start journaling. The poor thing looked so frail from doing her job, I felt awful for her at first. I can't imagine her nightmares after trying to help us. And yeah, I'd say I contribute to those nightmares plenty. I am one of the bad ones, but mainly because of what I've been through, which I still think is worse than what I've done. I'm gonna focus on my feelings, though, and not get into the detailed events. 

I don't see myself learning anything by writing down what already plays in my head on a loop. My sins are mine. Yours are yours. And I have no interest in hearing yours, so, "do unto others," right? Lunchtime is soon, so if this stops abrupt

I got another package today. Some kind of weird meat that needs cooked. I know a guy that'll fry it up, but I've gotten used to the vegetarian meals in here. After seeing that green sheen on the meat they serve, I don't know that I could ever really go back. 

I don't know if anyone that hasn't been in jail or prison knows what I'm talking about. Much like I don't think most know about what passes for juice in here; tastes like crushed up vitamins in a knock-off brand of Sunny D. I just gave the meat to my cellmate, and he took it out to the guys in my block. 

I can already smell the electric burn coming from a few cells down. There's a lot of commotion out there. My cell mate just came back and gave me a polaroid picture that was apparently at the bottom of the gift box under the meat. It's some fancy looking CEO-type guy holding up a glass of expensive booze like he's toasting something or someone.

Some weirdo with sunken black eyes just walked in to talk to my cellmate, and it just got awkward. This guy looks like he just crawled off the page of a Junji Ito comic. I'm gonna try to lay down and ignore them. Guess I don't have much to say today, anyway.

HOLY FUCK! So, I'm on the run, now! I don't know what the fuck is happening, but I'm gonna try to get out what happened as clearly as I remember. The weirdo with sunken black eyes grabbed up my cellmate moments after I stopped writing/rolled over in my bunk. 

But I heard a guttural scream and spun back around to see the weirdo starring into my cellmate; hand around his throat, pushing him into the wall. I watched his eyes turn grey then black, then the void where his eyes used to be started swirling like spiraling galaxies, and just as quickly my cellmates eyes did the same. 

Then they both started towards me! I got the fuck out of there, and outside the halls it was complete madness. The same thing was happening all around. Then everyone was turning into these weird eyed monsters; guards and prisoners. I managed to get a gun off a guard that was being "transformed" and shot my way out the first couple of areas. 

One of the guards was going so fast out of there that I didn't even need to take him hostage to get to the final exit. I just followed him as closely as I could, and I mean uncomfortably close, so he couldn't shut me in with everyone else. I found a wooded area with a creek, and I followed all day 'til I couldn't run or walk anymore.

I don't know where the guard went, but I didn't see any cars around, so he may have ended up running down the road we came out on. I just woke up in some shrubs close to the creekbed. I don't know where the fuck I am. It's only now I'm realizing I don't have my meds. I wanted to write this out, cos going off my meds, people might think I just had some kind of psychotic break. 

I want to make clear, I was on my meds when this all started. But whatever happens from here, I'm just sorry in advance. At least I don't have the gun anymore. It was empty before I even made it out, so I just dropped it somewhere at the start of these woods. My other fist was clenched so tight around my notebook and pen that I had to pry my fingers off of it this morning. 

I soaked my hand in the cold creek, slowly getting my digits, one by one, to unfold. It doesn't even feel like it's attached to my wrist, now. I'm gonna try to keep writing. The therapist said it could help keep me sane, right? Maybe I can hold on if I just keep writing long enough to find help. I need to find food soon. The adrenaline is wearing off.



Thursday. Dec. 12, 2024



It's her turn to sleep for a couple hours, so I finally have time to write this out. It's somewhere around midnight or 1 a.m. now, so... basically the same day. After walking another mile or so, I made it to a bridge, and crawled up and out of the woods by the creek. 

There were scattered cars zooming everywhere. Crashes had happened all over. But there were no bodies around. I spotted an urgent care that didn't look chaotic. I made my way over to it as fast as I could, thinking maybe they would have my meds, at least, or a TV... maybe someone with a cellphone, anything that could help me figure out what was happening. 

It was completely quiet when I made it inside. No signs of life anywhere. I thought about saying, "Hello?" Then I thought that would be the stupidest thing I could do in this moment. Silence might be best. All the power seemed to be off, aside from a few lit exit signs, and other than that and the rooms with windows the place was dark. So, I mainly fumbled around looking for a potentially abandoned cellphone or medication cart. 

That's when she had spotted me, I later found out. She had been hiding there all night; wide-eyed and terrified by what had happened there. She thought I was one of them at first, but quickly noticed my "normal" behavior and followed me for a bit to make sure. It was only after she felt like she had the drop on me with a scalpel in one hand and mace in the other that she made her presence known. 

"WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?!" she screeched, followed immediately with, "I'LL KILL YOU!" I spun around and cut my arm on her scalpel, and said "WHOA! JESUS! CALM DOWN! CALM DOWN!" I probably said calm down twenty times, each time quieter than the last. She finally just collapsed crying on the ground. I crouched down awkwardly and told her that everything was okay. 

What a stupid fucking thing to say, but it's just one of the things that comes out of a person in these situations. She was sobbing so hard, that I figured I better start by telling her everything that had happened to me so we could get on the same page. It worked. She calmed down, and shared with me a very similar story that took place on her lunchbreak. She worked in billing for the urgent care. She had brought her lunch that day, so she just decided to eat in the break room.

 She was halfway through a peanut butter sandwich when all the lights went off. Then the screaming. Then the horror. Honestly, she said everything so quickly, I didn't retain it all. She was shaking something awful, too. It made me think of my clamped-up hand, which I was rubbing the entire time she told her story.

 "I never saw their eyes," she said in a quiver. "I thought they were terrorists or something... I thought they were spreading some kind of chemical agent... but then," she trailed off. "Do you have a phone?" I tried to ask as soothingly as possible. She shook her head and wiped her eyes, "No, my dumbass threw it at one of them and ran! I wasn't thinking, ya know?!" she said in shame. 

My first thought, I'm not proud, was, "this bitch...", but quickly I understood, and told her it was okay. But then she told me that the TV in the breakroom was on the news before the power went out, and she remembers seeing and hearing something about a company that had began a recall on a product.

 "Something about the fumes while cooking... something... I can't remember," she tried before collapsing again. I told her what medications I needed, to which she looked at me and kind of nervously laughed. "Yeah, we have those. I'll find 'em. Don't worry." I then asked, "Is there anything to eat here?"

 She said that there were some things in the breakroom, and a vending machine down the hall we could break into. Her eyes went bright and sharp in an instant, though, and she muttered, "Just don't cook anything." After I grabbed up some energy bars and water, I told her I thought it was best if we stayed out in the woods. She agreed fairly easily, and we gathered up a couple pillows and blankets, and stealthily retreated back here. Same spot as last night. 

We sat and talked the day away. Every now and then we'd hear sirens and get real quiet. When the sun started to go down, we reasoned that for safety we should each take turns sleeping and only a couple hours at a time. I went first to show that I trusted her. I did manage to sleep some to my surprise.

 It must have been having a soft pillow and blanket. Also it was the first time I actually appreciated not being in my cell. I think she just fell asleep as I was writing the last few lines of this. I didn't tell her why I was in prison, and I'm really happy she didn't ask. I'm gonna take a break seeing how I don't want this hand all cramped up, too. I'm gonna take one of my only pills that doesn't cause drowsiness, now. 

What a fucking day.




Friday. Dec. 13, 2024



It's around midnight again. This will be the last entry. I don't know what life will become from here. But I don't see any need for writing anymore. Not after seeing this through. I may just burn this journal tonight. Or hell, maybe it'll end up like a cave painting in some future I can't envision.

When we got up Thursday morning, we started thinking more about a shower than we previously had. I said the routine of prison turned out was kind of nice to have. Brush your teeth, take your shower, eat your slop, do some work, eat your lunch, go out in the yard, have a shower, eat your slop, brush your teeth, go to bed; Rinse, repeat. "I wish I could brush my teeth," she giggled and made a face implying a bad stench. 

I laughed, and told her we needed to start thinking about something more sustainable. But before that, we needed to find some other food source. She knew the area, and I don't remember the exact conversation, but we ended up walking down to a fast food place that was close by. 

Our playful mood of the morning, quickly became complete shock. We walked in to see five employees standing behind the counter. They stared dead-eyed straight ahead. Their skin was a translucent blue. 

Their eyes, a dead milky grey. They weren't the monsters we had seen. They were just standing there dead. Or dead adjacent. I approached slowly with Mary behind me. "I seem to be low on funds... any chance we can get a couple of fountain drinks?" I said, trying to somehow hold onto reality. 

They all slowly nodded, but didn't move after. Maybe my meds were working in a different way, but I didn't feel terrified in this moment. I felt more accepting of the chaos. I told Mary to stay close, and we went behind the counter and made ourselves two big ass cups of soda. There wasn't any ice, but the soda came out fine. But then we heard it. A big black van pulled up quick into the parking lot. We ducked and made our way to the employee's back door.

"We're gonna have to do some runnin'," I told her. "Are you ready?"

She started sucking down her drink, and swiftly acknowledging the need for any energy we could get---I did the same. "YOU READY?! YOU READY?!" I started trying to psyche her up, but I gotta admit it was more to psyche myself up. And with that I kicked the door open and we started to run. But there they were. At least ten of the monsters.

 They had begun to morph into something new. They were bigger, now. Maybe ten or twelve feet tall. Their proportions were all over the place. Some had long necks that twisted about like the winding trunks of trees from goth rock album art. Some limbs were fat and busting with pus, while others were bone thin without a vein in sight. Their faces were putrid toothy grins; some didn't have noses, none of them had facial hair, eyebrows, but some looked like they were wearing bad wigs of black matted goat hair. 

We ran anyway. We were on the sidewalk out front in seconds, running along a chain-link fence. I looked back to see one in pursuit. He, no, it, was gaining fast and seemed to grow taller and taller, and wider and wider. "DON'T LOOK!" she screamed at me. I don't know how she had the air in her lungs, as fast as we were running. We made it to the end of the fence line, and turned right into a parking lot, but there one stood.

 Reaching out his bony elongated arm with sharp fingers, he grabbed her up. And his swirling eye sockets dazzled her, while I was frozen. The breath in my chest was painful and crushing. I turned to look back seeing the others catching up. It was all over. It sat her down, never losing that horrendous smile. My eyes welled up with tears, because I knew there wasn't anywhere to go, now. She turned and looked at me with grey eyes, slowly turning black. 

I looked into her, seeing the light going, and I desperately and whimpering cried, "If I had to go out, I'm glad it was with you, Mary." It was strange the flood of emotion that overtook me in that moment. In that moment, I loved that woman more than anyone I ever had, even though it's only been a couple days, we had trauma bonded greatly.

 And then the unthinkable happened. 

I forgave myself. I accepted my fate. I even smiled, though it was through the trembling reluctant sadness of my awful life. But then her eyes began getting lighter again. They slowly came back. She came back! She looked at me with complete innocence. It was as if her eyes were new. The monster let out a high-pitched yipping sound, like a chihuahua you accidently stepped on, but sustained and reverberated in this ghastly fashion that I didn't think would ever end.

 Without a pause I just grabbed her up in my arms. We stayed in that embrace for a few minutes, but it felt like lifetimes. Then when we let go and looked at each other, we just started laughing. We kept looking into each other's eyes for a long time after. Then when we did finally look around, the monsters were off down the road; terrorizing others, wrecking the world. 

We walked away, hand in hand, through that hellscape. We knew we could save each other,... and that was enough.

Like I said before, I don't know where life is going. But I don't think I need to write anymore. There probably won't be people left to read this, anyways.
But maybe there are others that found their light.

Maybe it isn't over.

I don't know what the love is with me and Mary. It's nice in this moment, and, really, that's all it needs to be.

The only thing I'm left thinking about now is,


Who sent me that giftbox?





Probably April, 2025





Lots of rain. Really draining. I keep thinking I hear her. She's been gone so long. Left to try and find more meds, now I make and unmake beds. I hear them, too. Can you? Can you? I really wish I knew. Who's real in this house?

 I know it's no one, or I'd be in that swirling dark. 
Did I scare her away? Why wouldn't she let me go with her? I'd search for her, but I'd never find my way back.
 I don't know where I am.
 I don't know whose house I'm in. It sure is gray with all this rain. I bet she wouldn't want found, anyway. It's okay. I'll be okay. 

Maybe I should go outside. Just to maybe see the sky. I bet it's gray with all this rain. I'd sell my soul for a different brain. I forgot I lost so many toes. Maybe that's why I can't go? Oh Mary, if you find me, and I made the last mistake, I'm sorry. Mary, maybe stay away. It sure is gray inside this place.

 I'm too scared to keep candles lit. Besides, the whole house  smells like pigs. I'd kill to watch a TV show. I can't keep reading the same few books. Who could be bored with all this noise? The people here sure seem sad. Maybe they're the one's that died? No, the one's I shot were still alive. Yeah, one is just sitting there counting the fragments in the fireplace. It's not them.

 So many years ago, now… maybe some have died? But no one's here. I'm okay. I should go make my bed.

 Wait!… I just heard Mary come in. I'm saved!

 Thank God!
