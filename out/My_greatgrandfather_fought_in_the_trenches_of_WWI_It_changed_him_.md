Looking through the journal again, it’s like these couple of pages are written by a totally different person. The difference is night and day in the man who was writing these words and the man writing the rest of the journal. I’m going to include a warning here because it will only let me use one flair, there is talk of a suicide in these next few pages. I know that’s a bit much for some people.

June 16, 1916

The whispers haven’t stopped. Nothing makes them cease, constantly muttering right into my ear their profane demands. It says to bring it more. Thousands of different voices, all clamoring to bring each of them more of the dead that already litter these fields.

I pray for them to stop in the night, crying as I whisper pleas to god for salvation. The words barely escape my ragged lungs, still stinging from the chlorine gas days ago. Nothing makes it stop. I would gladly take the gas again if it only made the voices stop. I fear for what they want me to do.

Sporadic artillery fire has been hitting closer today. Many of the others hit by the gas have already perished. I’m one of the few survivors, and even now it still feels that my skin is burning off. Even trying to use the pain to distract from the voices isn’t working, as they simply get louder when I start ignoring them.

My belief right now is that others are hearing the whispers as well. Some of the other men around me have begun to act strange, more paranoid than is normal even for the trenches. Shell shock has set in among many of them, with most barely able to function. Many a poor soul has been carted out and back to base, ceasing to function after they just seemed to become overburdened by what they’ve seen.

I don’t base this off mere speculation though, as Jones, the soldier who saw the first evil alongside me that night, confirmed my suspicions. In the night, he began screaming. From even further down the trench than I was, yet his screams echoed through the night, piercing the sound of bombs falling from heaven. The unmistakable sounds of a mine followed, with one more almost immediately behind, and his screaming stopped. I didn’t realize at the time that it was him, but the news of what happened reached me only a few hours later.

Jones was muttering in his sleep about “feeding the riverbed”, assumedly the same thing we had seen. When another soldier tried to rouse him to take his watch, Jones attacked. Before anyone could stop him, he had used his trench spade to behead the poor man. There were only seconds that passed when another soldier tried to get him off the dead one, the body still twitching, but Jones ran him through with the same spade. 

Nobody was willing to approach him then, but they said he glowed in his eyes, almost like they were glazed over in sleep. They thought he was maybe having a fit, not quite awake, and believing their allies were enemies. Until he threw the severed head over the trench wall into no man’s land, before starting to drag the rest up to the surface. When another soldier held him at gunpoint to question, all he said was that “he was hungry” and pointed to the river.

It’s a wonder he wasn’t shot right there, but instead, the story was that he got both of those dead bodies from the trench before hopping out himself. Once he was out, he kicked the head further into no man’s land, stacked the bodies, and started dragging them toward the water. Made it maybe thirty meters before stepping on a mine, parts of him and the dead soldiers becoming unrecognizable from each other as they were scattered across the field. One of their pieces must have landed on another mine, making it explode as well.

The darkness of night was accented by heavy rains only minutes later, stopping anyone from trying to retrieve them. Sheets of sleet made a veil between us and the river, limiting our vision to only meters across the battlefield. Some of the watch last night believed they saw faint fires through the rain, but were disregarded. Their remains were gone by morning, though rationalized as being taken by the swelling river, engorged by the rain.

Right now it is still raining as I sit in this hole, praying to whatever god might listen. I don’t know that the almighty lord of the bible is real anymore. If he was, this evil wouldn’t be here.

He needs to feed. He’s hungry. I don’t know why I’m the one being told to do it but I fear it’s going to make me. Sleep has escaped me, I’ve been up for at least the past two days. There’s no end to the voices. Does it torture our enemies as it does us? Is there someone on the other side suffering these same evils? Or is this evil on their side? I know not what to believe anymore. All I have are these whispers.

My prayers have failed.

(Editor’s note- the following entries have no dates. I’m very likely missing a lot of information here, as the pages are covered almost completely in writings. Some I can understand, some are in what may very well be another language. Other pages are nonsense repeated. I’ve done what I can.)

It’s rained for three days now. The river is invading no man’s land, trying to reach our trench. I fear it’s because they haven’t eaten since Jones brought sacrifices. They will soon find us, turning the trench into a river of blood.

Their whispers grow louder as the flood rises. Whispers have become more demanding though, more aggressive. They threaten me if I don’t feed them.

———————————-

Waters grow near. The walls of the trench have been sloughing off as mud. There’s no respite from the rain. 

Voices of many are now becoming more clear as one. It sounds out like a chorus still, deafening me while nobody else hears. It demands to be fed.

————————————————————

FEEDHIMFEEDHIMFEEDHIMFEEDHIM

———————————————————

No God would allow such evil to exist. We are damned.

——————————————————-

IT SCREAMS AT ME TO FEED IT

—————————-

Last night I stole the corpse of a dead soldier. He was hit by a sniper bullet, right in the eye. The force of the bullet was enough to knock his helmet off the back, splattering brains over those near him. I don’t know this young man’s name, but I knew he could stop the demanding threats.

It only took a few moments for me to throw his corpse over the edge, out into the no man’s land. The creeping flood waters were much closer now, rain still pouring in sheets. I pushed the body a little further, to the edge of where I knew the nearest mines were.

I was still standing there when it dragged his body into the current, pale moons glowing through curtains of rain. Eyes lit up red as it drained whatever dried blood was still in the soldier, sliding back into the depths where more glowing moons were waiting.

It still wants more.

————————————

Jessica, I’m sorry.

I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m so, so sorry. I have damned us.

—————————-

Tonight I will throw myself into the current. Perhaps it will end this horror. It wants more. At least I will have silence if it devours me.

—————————————

I will not be enough.

———————————-

Water is splashing over the barricades of sand and dirt, desperately lapping at the trench. I swear I can see the glow of their eyes in the night, prowling the perimeter to choose their preferred meal. His whispers are louder now.

——————————————————

They are him. He is they. I fell asleep for the first time in days as water poured over me. These evils are only parts of the great terror below. It is greater than any nation can hope to fight, no matter our force. It demands to feed.

————————

I will feed it. I will feed it as many as it needs.

—————————-

It clouds my mind. I know that I cannot feed it. I cannot sacrifice my brothers in arms.

————————-

If it doesn’t feed now it will take more.

—————————

A river of blood haunts my every waking moment. We are using what we can to stay above the water spilling into the trench. 

—————————

Someone drowned in the bottom of the trench today. I found him. I… I believe I may have been the one to hold him under. His body disappeared under the waters and never came back up.

—————————

HE WANTS MORE

—————————

God is real. He is beneath us.

—————————

I will feed him. I will ascend.

——————-

I do not know who I am right now. I fear for these moments where I lose clarity. I do not know the man who wrote these pages. Someone is dead and I am to blame. Others will suspect me soon. I fear that the trench is only growing higher and it is my fault. Others are despondent. Nobody acknowledges we may face our death of nature instead of the enemy. I cannot be the one to hurt more.

I will ensure I don’t hurt anyone else.

Jessica, I love you. I’m sorry.

August 17, 1916

By the grace of god, I am alive. Though I am changed forever.

From what I have been told by the doctors, I will likely not walk again. Not on both legs, at least. My left leg is gone at the shin, while my right ends halfway up my thigh now. I will likely be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life, but I am alive.

I remember naught of the last hours I spent in the trenches. My allies tell me that one night I finally wandered into the no man’s land of my own accord, stepping through the river and pushing up on us. I know not if I was following my own delusions or heeding the orders of evil. Before I was far from the trench, a shell hit in front of me. I was blown back to the trench, my legs being taken by the blast.

From there I was carted back to a field hospital where I lay even still. Recovery is a long road, and the pain is immense. I have heard that the line has advanced since my absence, finally able to move past the river. Now our only enemies are the ones we signed up to fight. I pray we are successful.

They have just delivered me more morphine. I grow weary, but it numbs the pain well. I hope to be back home soon, Jessica.

———————————————-

That’s it. Nothing is mentioned again about whatever the hell he saw out there. The rest of the journal is basically a recovery process, learning to get around in a wheelchair and desperately hoping to get back home. Not sure who Jessica is, because my great-grandmother’s name is Meredith, but uh… I’ve heard a lot about her by now. Guessing she didn’t accept what he came back as. 

Gramps always told us he was an old bastard, too much of a drinking problem and abusive as hell after what he had been through. Then again, that’s how dad talks about gramps too. Guess seeing the horrors of war does that to people. 

Maybe he just disregarded what he saw as just a part of hell on earth in the trenches. Maybe it was for his own sanity, unable to take the dissonance between what he saw and what he believed. He was a broken man in the [end](https://www.reddit.com/u/googlyeyes93/s/AYUcxjTNKt).
