I'm in some desperate need for some help with my super curly hair, I'm talking like 3b or 3c type of curls, no thanks to bad genes from my mom My mom used to have some type of wavy hair but nothing to the degree of me or the rest of my siblings, so she didn't know how to properly take care of my hair nor has she done the research into taking care of it either. So I've been doing research into how to do some proper hair care, which has led me to a new obsession of mine: brushing my hair. 

How come I've never tried of this before? It's such a game changer when it comes to styling my hair, since I can now wear it as a sort of shield that protects me from the outside world when I brush it out enough. All the videos tell me to wash my hair and always brush it out when wet because I'll damage my hair and pull the follicles from my scalp, but I'm not too worried about that so I brush dry whenever I can. The feeling of pulling the knots out of my hair feels so good, almost like cracking my fingers right before I get started on that task I've been putting off, it just feels so good.  I get lulled into a sort of trance when I'm pulling and sometimes I feel like the knots are talking to me, whispering something inaudible but powerful enough for me to get goose pimples. Sometimes I can almost hear what they're saying to me, but when I start to parse the words, I'm interrupted by the feeling of my tears on my lap. It's the worst feeling ever. I want to know what she's saying to me, I want to know what's so perfect. I just got some goose pimples thinking about them. Please don't tell anyone, but sometimes I'll intentionally get my hair knotted so I can pull them out and hear the knots. 

The feeling of looking at my brush that's full of knots and hair feels so euphoric, so much so that I can't help but be ashamed that I killed them before they could finish speaking to me. Since I'm almost finished completing it, I'll tell you what I do with my hair piles. Hair is fibrous which means I can intertwine hair with hair to make cute little creations, like a blindfold of some sort. My rope is nearly a meter long, but I need to be longer, I keep brushing and brushing but I can't make anymore knots, my scalp hurts and my arms are getting weak. No matter what I try and no matter how little hair I have left, I can't finish it in time. Please. 

If you or someone you know has curly hair like mine, please please please send them my way, I need to hear the voices again, I need to finish the job they had for me. 

My sister just texted me about hair care. I need to go.
