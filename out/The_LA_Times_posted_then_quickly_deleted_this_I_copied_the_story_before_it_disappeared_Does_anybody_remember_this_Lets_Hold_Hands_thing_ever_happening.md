In 2011, social media was abuzz with a trend called “SkyWalking”. Essentially, a person finds a high rooftop, crane, or ledge of any sort, and they photograph themselves walking along the precarious platform. By the year’s end, the game had killed a handful of teenagers.In 2014, a game known as NekNomination swept through the globe. In the game, a player films themselves drinking a large quantity of alcohol in one sitting, then nominates a friend to outdo them. By the time the trend died, so had dozens of its players.

&#x200B;

In 2017, a 17 year-old girl was arrested for manipulating over 100 children and teenagers to commit suicide. Through social media, the Russian teen posed 50 challenges to “players” in what as come to be known as the Blue Whale Game. The final challenge was for the players to kill themselves.Experts have tried to explain why these “games” thrived, citing the adrenaline rush and the competitive nature of one-upping fellow participants. Countless hours of talking heads on cable news pontificated on why these kids would put themselves in these dangerous situations. Segments filled with finger-pointing, grandstanding, and of course,  “When I was a kid…”

&#x200B;

And while they were looking to solve a drug problem. A gang problem. An alcohol problem. A bully problem. A parenting problem. A safe-space problem. A government problem. An education problem. An “other” problem… They didn’t watch the kids. They were looking back at these atrocities and didn’t even realize the worst was yet to come.

&#x200B;

In 2019, a new trend took hold of the United States for 87 days. The trend ultimately **injured over 4,300 children and teenagers**, and **claimed (at least) 346 lives**.

In order to give a fully comprehensive scope of the situation, interviews were conducted as early as a few weeks after the conclusion of the events described, and as late as four years since, culminating with the final interview taking place a mere three days before the publication of this story.

# Part 1 - The Kids Aren't Afraid

**Amy Nakagawa, Journalist, LA TIMES**:  It’s cliche and hack to say, of course, but in all my years I have never seen anything like this. I remember the piece coming across my desk in June, and thinking it was morning show fluff. Kids were holding hands, making human chains, occasionally blocking a small intersection or crowding a department store or something like that. It was a fad, like dabbing or Tebowing. We’d seen these come and go a bunch of times and didn’t think it had any legs. It also didn’t inherently have the dangerous allure of the kids on skyscrapers or that suicide game- so at first there was really no angle on this story that had teeth. It was literally just kids holding hands. Not the splashiest headline.

&#x200B;

**Reese Fuentes, Detective, LAPD**: I have two boys, so I might’ve heard about it earlier, but I can’t keep track of all the crap they do. I mean that in the sense that I buy a hundred dollars worth of Spiderman stuff, just to see them ignore it after a week and beg me for Batman junk. I know how they’re doing in school. I know who their friends are. I know where they go and what they’re eating when they stay at their dad’s. I try to be their mom, not a detective, ya know? I don't think any mom or detective really saw this coming.  It was like overnight, all the kids just went flippin' nuts.

&#x200B;

**Dr. Lillian Gilhooley, PhD Social Sciences**: Movie theaters seemed to be a natural platform for the trend to grow exponentially. Even with all of the innovations in technology, teens are still somewhat limited when it comes to “acceptable” social activities. These activities also have to overlap with what a parent is willing to sign off on. A mother or father has to feel comfortable leaving their child alone with their peers for a few hours, and that list of activities and venues is even shorter. So essentially all that’s covered in this Venn diagram of acceptable activities for kids and parents alike: are movie theaters and malls.

&#x200B;

**Reese Fuentes, Detective, LAPD**: We’d get calls all the time about movie theaters. These kids would walk in, hand-in-hand, and blow right past the ticket taker. They’d pick an R-rated movie, of course- but then again, it didn’t matter at that point because none of them had paid to see any movie. They’d fill every seat in the place. Some of them sitting in the aisles on the floor. You’d walk in and see two hundred teenagers watching The Danish Girl or whatever else was out that year. And they’d all be holding each other’s hands.

&#x200B;

**Amy Nakagawa, Journalist, LA TIMES**: They’d always pick a movie that was Oscar-bait, or something that kids would never pay to see earnestly. You’d have empty screenings of the third Lego movie and Avengers sequel, but kids packed in to see Mark Rylance in the Wooden Curtain.

&#x200B;

**Dr. Lillian Gilhooley, PhD Social Sciences**: Irony and detachment plays a large part in the children’s psyches. If the group all celebrates something that is- to them- objectively boring or traditionally unsavory to kids, then none of them can be ostracized for the things they actually like. Pretending to like something that is obviously undesirable shields your insecurities with a nihilism of sorts. If mass importances is placed on frivolous things, then the lines of what matters become blurred, and eventually erased. And if nothing matters, you’re no longer vulnerable.

&#x200B;

**Reese Fuentes, Detective, LAPD**: When they were doing the movie theaters, we’d just break them up. They’d disperse pretty easily when it was early on. Snickering the whole time. It was all just a prank then. They knew we weren’t going to arrest 200 kids for pouring into a Cate Blanchett movie.

&#x200B;

**Dr. Lillian Gilhooley, PhD Social Sciences**: After a few weeks, the trend should’ve died. It should’ve followed the pattern of all of these other social media trends and run its course. But it went the other way.

&#x200B;

**Reese Fuentes, Detective, LAPD**: We started getting reports, and seeing videos on cable news of kids sticking their hands out the windows of moving vehicles and holding on to other kids hands in other cars.

&#x200B;

**Dr. Lillian Gilhooley, PhD Social Sciences**: One of the reasons I believe this trend caught on and ultimately grew, is because of the introduction of rules to the game. At first it appeared that kids were just holding hands to inconvenience adults. The rules gave the trend the competitive slant that this was something that could be conquered. The first rule of the game, was whoever let go first, loses.

&#x200B;

**Reese Fuentes, Detective, LAPD**: So you could see how this was a massive GD problem. We had kids hanging on to other kids in other moving vehicles, and neither one of them wanting to let go. Mom or dad turns around and sees their kid hanging out the window, what’s their first instinct? Slam on the flippin’ brakes.

&#x200B;

**Sarita Logan, Head Nurse, Cedars Sinai ER**: It’s as if there was some lunatic running around breaking kids arms and hands. It was wave after wave of crying kids we’d see for dislocated shoulders, broken hands, hyperextended elbows. The whole internet bullshit didn’t do us any favors either. I got kids in my waiting room with bones sticking out of their skin, and they’re smiling from ear to ear about an Xbox. Makes you wanna slap up upside the head before you treat them.

&#x200B;

**Reese Fuentes, Detective, LAPD**: You had kids old enough to drive that would load up their car and just go looking for kids in other cars. They’d drive with their hands out the window, like a worm baiting a fish. And sure enough someone would pull along side and grab on. Sometimes you’d have cars across all four lanes of traffic, with kids holding hands between all four of em. They wouldn’t let go until one of the drivers accidentally sideswiped the other car and smash up a kid’s hand. Or until they rear ended another car and caused a pile-up.

&#x200B;

**Amy Nakagawa, Journalist, LA TIMES**: The numbers that we have only look at the injuries and deaths to kids under the age of 18. But there was plenty of collateral damage while these kids were out, “riding” as they called it. Data might show that a 72 year-old died in a traffic accident, but what it probably doesn’t account for is that that accident was caused by eleven kids holding hands across three cars in three lanes of traffic going 80 miles an hour.

&#x200B;

**Reese Fuentes, Detective, LAPD**: We looked at ways to enforce the issue. People kept pushing for a curfew, but that wouldn’t do diddly because the kids only did this crap during the day. It was one of their rules. So we started with: anyone caught holding hands with another driver would be arrested, and eventually that even went as far as kids under the age of 18 weren’t allowed to put their hands outside a moving vehicle at any time.  And finally, kids under the age of 18 weren’t allowed to drive. And when we imposed that last one is when the shit hit the fan.

&#x200B;

**Amy Nakagawa, Journalist, LA TIMES**: The day after the under 18 driver ban, the 405 was shut down completely. Which, to be fair, isn’t too far of a fall from how it usually operates. But this day looked like the apocalypse, where people abandon their cars on the freeway. Cops were arresting teenaged drivers left and right.

&#x200B;

**Sarita Logan, Head Nurse, Cedars Sinai ER**: Makes you wonder where the parents are in all of this, right? Like just hide your friggin car keys for christ’s sake.

&#x200B;

**Reese Fuentes, Detective, LAPD**: We were bringing in eleven and twelve year-olds for reckless driving. They didn’t know to pull over, so they’d just stop in the middle of the road. That or slowly ram into another car or barrier on account of not putting it in park. We’d cuff em- with twisty ties- try our best to pull the car over to the shoulder, and call a tow truck. We stopped going straight back to the station, because you’d arrest one or two kids in a car, and on the way back you’d get another one, it wasn’t worth it to go back unless you had a full car. Tow trucks couldn’t keep up with the rate that we’re stopping cars, the road was becoming inaccessible, and the whole time I'm doing my job, I’m praying to God that I won’t see either of my boys on this GD highway.

&#x200B;

**Amy Nakagawa, Journalist, LA TIMES**: That day started like it was just going to be these kids making everyone’s commute that much worse. But it exploded. The kids got out of the cars and were marching, like Selma, but out of boredom rather than civil rights. Drivers got so frustrated, they tried to maneuver around the kids. And you’d see teenagers laughing, as they are walking toward cars, on their hoods and down the back. These cars would speed off, and sometimes try to shoot a gap. One or two kids got clipped, then across town you heard about more. Drivers were fed up. They hit a breaking point and people were mowing down children in the streets.

&#x200B;

**Isaac Dodd, FBI (Director of Natl. Gang Intelligence Center)**: That was the day this was brought to our attention. In a few hours the game went from kids creating a nuisance to a national security threat. We mostly deal with street gangs, white supremacists, and other dangerous groups that have pockets of members across the country. This wasn’t what we were used to because it was so ambiguous. But ultimately we had to step in. It was bad all over, but that day in California was far and away the worst.

&#x200B;

**Sarita Logan, Head Nurse, Cedars Sinai ER**: You have to have a strong disposition to be a nurse, especially an ER nurse. You develop a callous and not get attached or get emotional when you see people coming in with injuries. But that day, when people were coming in with kids that had been run over. The broken arms is one thing, but treating countless kids for injuries sustained from adults driving over them. So many were already gone when they came in, too. It was the closest thing to a natural disaster I’ve worked in.

&#x200B;

**Reese Fuentes, Detective, LAPD**: That day didn’t end. The kids stopped their game right on schedule at sundown, but the aftermath took all night. We had one detective interviewing kids asking them how they planned this. They’d laugh and ask him if he was “triggered”. He’d threaten them with jail time and it wouldn’t get anywhere. He finally thought he had a breakthrough when he was talking to a girl one-on-one. He comes to me and says that she claims to be “rider”. The one that introduced all of the rules and is the mastermind behind this whole fiasco. He’s celebrating like we just got Bin Laden. I wasn’t sold. So on a hunch, I took three kids into the interrogation room with me, and the other detective, he’s on the other side of the glass, probably smiling like a turkey. I ask the three kids which one is known as “rider”, the head of the operation. And just like Spartacus, all three of their hands shoot up. Sure enough, every single kid you asked that night claimed to be “rider”.

&#x200B;

**Dr. Lillian Gilhooley, PhD Social Sciences**: If they’re all “rider” then none of them are. It’s strength in knowing that they are all on the same playing field. It’s liberating to be a part of something massive and grassroots and know that you only have peers, nobody above or below you.

&#x200B;

**Amy Nakagawa, Journalist, LA TIMES**: And during all of this chaos, parents weren’t happy about the way their kids were being treated. People were going down to stations, demanding their kids be released. That their kid was innocent. That they didn’t know what they were doing and should be let off with a warning. The law savvy parents pointed out the inhumane conditions at the stations.

&#x200B;

**Reese Fuentes, Detective, LAPD**: We had so many GD kids in lockup, there was no way those cells weren’t gonna get overcrowded. Usually with overcrowding, you risk the inmates getting unruly and fights break out, but this wasn't the case with these kids. Every cell was like a party. They were dancing and clapping. Any time they saw a badge or adult of any kind walk by, they'd cheer and laugh. After all the crap that had happened that day, seeing those kids having the time of their lives in there was creepier than all get out.

&#x200B;

**Dr. Lillian Gilhooley, PhD Social Sciences**: A friend of mine reached out about her child. He misbehaves constantly, not to the level of anything dangerous or worrisome, but general childhood disobedience. However, whenever she tries to punish him for his behavior, he simply accepts it with a smile, unaffected. Most children you can take away their favorite video game, give them more chores, or even proactively bribe them with toys or treats in order for them to behave. They feel regret when punished, and joy when rewarded. But this child sought no bribe, no reward, nor was he affected by any punishment given. The child seemingly cared about nothing. Which, in my field, we usually call a sociopath. While I didn’t tell my friend that her child was a sociopath, I do wonder if I should have. It may have saved her own sanity to know that there was never going to be any reasoning with anyone who doesn’t want anything or care about anything.

&#x200B;

**Amy Nakagawa, Journalist, LA TIMES**: It didn't slow down after that day either. They tried to impose daytime curfews and emergency laws against kids traveling in groups, but it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. For every kid you arrested and locked up, there was 5 that got away. And this is just Los Angeles. Keep in mind this was happening all over the country. We were trying to stop criminals and babysit every kid in town. Federal help couldn’t get here soon enough.

&#x200B;

**Isaac Dodd, FBI**: They shut down LAX. O’Hare. JFK. All of em. These kids clogged all the airports. They didn’t have guns or bombs. They just jammed the terminals with themselves. Inside and out. Flights grounded because they were empty, pilots and flight crews couldn't make it to their gate. There were just literally kids every where. And we were stuck with our thumbs up our asses because we had to work hand in hand, no pun intended, with DHS, who, with all due respect, aren’t the most effective department in our government.

&#x200B;

**Wendy Gignac, DHS (Associate Director Cybersecurity Div.)**: We have a lot of overhead, a lot of moving parts and agencies at the DHS. We assessed the situation and best determined that this would be a cybersecurity matter.

&#x200B;

**Isaac Dodd, FBI**: It took them ten days just to determine who was going to handle this on a federal level, and this is after a sitting president’s flight has been rerouted due to what was essentially a non-functioning airport in a major city. Look, the way I run my department is based on results. I absolutely believe that the end justifies the means. If we have people putting other people in danger, we need to stop it. Period. I don’t care if they’re six or sixty. You break the law, you hurt someone else: you pay the price. DHS on the other hand wanted to take a slow approach to this. They’re talking about the damn internet while people are running down kids in the streets.

&#x200B;

**Wendy Gignac, DHS**: There was plenty of chatter and an online presence of the game. The most common hashtag and moniker being “Let’s Hold Hands”. The problem was, that most of the online presence was after the fact. They were celebrating or retelling tales of their escapades in online forums and message boards. It was one of their rules that they couldn’t plan or advertise where a gathering was going to be.  Another one was you couldn’t film your own chain or yourself for any reason.  Oddly enough, the game both thrived because of social media and in spite of it. Online was solely a place to talk about things after the fact.  That being said, there were things you could look at and study that would give you insight to how these kids tend to think and act and we were able to predict where the next events might occur.

&#x200B;

**Isaac Dodd, FBI**: We wanted to be proactive. We were tired of cleaning up messes and we wanted to prevent future messes. Mainly injuries and lost lives. We had to work in partnership with the DHS, and often didn’t see eye-to-eye, seeing as we saw this as an impromptu gang threat and they thought it was a cyber threat.

&#x200B;

**Wendy Gignac, DHS**: It’d be foolish to say this had nothing to do with cyber security. Granted there were catastrophes happening on the ground in real life, but if you saw the sheer amount of encouragement these kids were getting from around the country, and around the world, you’d know that the internet was truly the belly of the beast.
