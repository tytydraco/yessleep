The old logging road, barely a track now, clawed its way up into the Blackwood Range. Inside the beat-up SUV, we were a tangle of limbs and laughter, the scent of pine needles and stale coffee thick in the air. Our annual camping trip was finally here, a much-needed escape from the grind of city life. I was with Sarah, Mark, and Chloe.

We found our usual spot, a clearing by the whispering river, just as the sun began to dip below the jagged peaks. The air instantly cooled, carrying with it the damp, earthy smell of the forest. Tents were pitched, a fire was coaxed to life, and soon, the crackle of burning wood mingled with our easy conversation. As dusk bled into night, the surrounding woods transformed into an oppressive, inky black, punctuated only by the dancing firelight.
It was Chloe who noticed it first. A flicker, deep within the treeline, too steady to be an animal, too low to be a star. She dismissed it, but then, as Mark recounted a particularly wild anecdote, a twig snapped in the darkness, closer than it should have been. 

We all paused, the laughter dying on our lips. I grabbed a flashlight and swept the beam across the surrounding foliage. Nothing. Just the impenetrable wall of trees.

"Probably a deer," Sarah offered, though her voice lacked conviction.

We tried to resume our carefree banter, but an unease had settled over the camp, a subtle shift in the atmosphere. 

Later, as we huddled around the dying embers, the temperature plummeted. Sarah shivered, pulling her jacket tighter. That's when we heard it: a low, guttural whisper, carried on the wind. It wasn't a language I knew, but the sound itself was a violation, an ice-cold caress against my skin.
Sleep offered no respite. I awoke with a gasp, drenched in sweat. I’d dreamt of eyes, vast and ancient, watching me from the depths of a suffocating blackness. The next morning, the mood was somber. The playful teasing had vanished, replaced by a nervous energy. As we packed up our breakfast things, Chloe screamed.

Nailed to a tree just beyond our campsite, precisely where Chloe had seen the first flicker of light, was a crude wooden effigy. It was made of twisted branches and bound with what looked like dried sinews. Its head was a featureless stone, but two small, glinting pebbles had been set into it, mimicking eyes. 

They stared directly at our camp…

Panic flared, raw and undeniable. I pulled it down, my hands trembling. "It's just a prank," I insisted, but the words sounded hollow even to me.

We decided to leave. Now. The winding logging road, which had seemed so inviting yesterday, now felt like a desperate escape route. As Mark drove, the silence in the SUV was heavy, punctuated only by the crunch of tires on gravel. No one spoke, each lost in their own terrified thoughts.

Then, the engine sputtered. And died.
Mark frantically tried to restart it, but the battery was utterly dead. We were miles from civilization, deep in the Blackwood Range, and night was fast approaching. As darkness once again began to consume the forest, we heard it again. The whisper. This time, it was closer, swirling around the vehicle like a venomous mist.

"Someone's out there," Sarah whimpered, pressing herself against Chloe.

A rhythmic scratching began on the roof of the SUV, like long, brittle fingernails dragging across metal. Then, a low thud against the driver's side window. We all flinched, turning to see a blurry shape pressed against the glass, a vague outline of a face, eyes like charcoal pits. A single, bloody hand print smeared down the glass.

I fumbled for my phone, but there was no signal. We were trapped. The scratching intensified, moving around the vehicle, accompanied by soft thumps against the doors. 

The whisper grew louder, more distinct, forming fragmented, chilling words in a voice that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. It spoke of old blood, of forgotten rituals, of the forest claiming its own.
A bone-chilling shriek erupted from the back of the SUV. We spun around to see Chloe, her eyes wide with terror, pointing to the rear window. A figure, impossibly tall and gaunt, stood just behind us, its form barely discernible in the deepening gloom. It had no discernible features, just an elongated head and limbs that seemed to stretch and contort in the dim light. And those eyes, two pinpricks of malevolent red, fixed on us.

The thumping and scratching stopped. A new sound filled the air, a slow, deliberate dragging noise, like something heavy being pulled across the ground, circling our vehicle. The whisper began again, no longer fragmented, but a low, monotonous chant, weaving a tapestry of dread around us.

The figure outside raised an impossibly long arm, its fingers ending in razor-sharp points. It slowly, deliberately, began to trace patterns in the condensation on the rear window. A symbol emerged, ancient and unsettling, echoing the effigy we’d found.

Then, with a sickening crack, the rear window shattered.

The blast of cold air hit us like a physical blow. A collective scream tore through the SUV. We scrambled to huddle together, pressing against each other, as the icy breath of the creature filled the vehicle. We could smell it now – the scent of damp earth, decaying leaves, and something else, something metallic and cloying, like old blood.

The chanting outside intensified, a chorus of unseen voices joining the initial whisper. Inside, the shattered window was a gaping maw, and through it, we could see the elongated arm slowly reaching in, its sharp fingers searching.
This was no prank. No animal. This was something ancient, something that had waited patiently in the dark heart of the Blackwood Range, and now, it had found us. The last thing I heard before the silence of the forest consumed us completely was Sarah's choked sob, and the whisper, very close now, saying, "Welcome home."

I don't know how I survived. I barely remember anything after that. One moment, sheer terror, the next, I was stumbling out of the woods, torn and bloodied, into the first rays of dawn. The others... I don't know what happened to them. The police found the SUV, but it was empty, just shattered glass and that lingering, putrid smell. They called it a bear attack, said I was lucky. But I know what I saw. I know what whispered to us. And every night, I still hear the chanting.
