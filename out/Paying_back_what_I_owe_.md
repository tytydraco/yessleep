“Please just give me one more week! I’ll have it all for you then.” I knew my gambling addiction would be the death of me. 

Al looked down at the crumbled bills in his hand. It wasn’t even a tenth of what I owe him back. 

“Mickey, I have been so patient with you. That’s about to change. I’ve been very graceful and given you plenty of timing. Either you give me my money, or Butch is gonna break your legs.” 

“I’m telling you I can get you it, just one more week.” 

He turned to his two goons behind him. “Mess him up but don’t kill him.” Butch and whatever the other guys name is was approaching me with a baseball bat in their hands. 

I dropped to the floor as if me curling in a ball would protect me. 

“Wait a second.” He held up his hand. “Tell ya what, I got a job for ya.”

I sniffled. “A job?”

“Yeah, a job. If you do it, I’ll give you a year grace period to pay back what’s owed. I might even knock off a few grand and interest.” 

“What would I be doing?”

“You don’t ask the questions! Are you in or not?”

“I’m in.” 

“Good.. Butch, drive our little Irish friend to the spot.” He winked. 

I rode in the back of the SUV silently as Butch approached an old farmhouse that clearly no one lived in for decades. 

“Al doesn’t want to go in this house so you will. His brother hid from the cops in this house and never came out. His brother wore a necklace with their mom’s wedding ring attached. He wants that necklace back.”

“How come he never asked you guys to go get it?” I had a strange cold chill come up my back.

“Lost a few guys in there, don’t want to lose anymore.” He got out of the car and opened my door. He handed me a machete and flashlight. “You’ll need these.”

“Why the weapon?”

“Get in there!” He smacked the back of my head. 

I walked up to the house and shined my flashlight through the window. No one could definitely be living in here. It was full of webs and dusty. The door was unlocked though.

I tiptoed in and shined around the area. The floor felt weak the room smelled musty. Every step I took made a creaking noise. I heard a loud crawling noise. 

From another room something crawled out in front of me. My hand covered my mouth as if it would prevent me from screaming. 

It looked like a person on the top half. But the bottom half was like a hairy tarantula. Its tongue flickered like a snakes, and it had a horn pointed out of its forehead. It was female. It let out a loud screech that sounded like brakes being slammed on. It charged me. 

I tried diving out of the way but it got on top of me. My arms were flailing around as I tried to hit it with the machete. My finger came in contact with its mouth and it but off a piece of it. I managed to wack it a few times with the weapon. 

It took off running for a moment and crawled up the wall. Green goo was oozing out of its wounds. 

It dropped  to  me and I held up the machete above my head. I opened my eyes and felt its body weight on me. The machete went through its chest. 

I had to wiggle myself free as I was wiping the green goo out of my eyes and spitting it out. It tasted just like blood. I jerked the necklace off the beast and ran out the door. 

Butch was waiting for me and asked me to hand it over. “I’m surprised you made it out. His brother died from it and so did some of our boys. Be luck that Al has enough compassion to give you more time.”

He got in the car and crunk it. My door was locked though.

“Aren’t you gonna let me in?”

“He didn’t say I had to give you a ride back.” He drove off. 

I walked for several miles before reaching a bus station. I slept on the bench until it was morning and was able to catch a ride near home. 

I got into my run down apartment and had a splitting headache. I took some Tylenol and shower. I looked in the mirror and noticed it.

I have a little horn growing from my forehead.
