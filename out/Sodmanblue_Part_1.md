I’ve always been desperate. 



I was born in an un-American city and moved to a brand new one when I was fourteen. My Slavic accent was harsh and gnawed at every word I said in English, and I shot up taller than most kids my age early before stopping shy of 5’10”. I was bullied and I was brooding, and the only high school friends I had were from playing Call of Duty on the Xbox on a TV stand that sank low into the floors of my Tato’s millhouse. The only close friend I had was my older sister, Kat, and the only times we hung out without my Tato were when she made me dye her hair with jet black box dye and cut it in our communal bathroom’s yellowed bathtub-shower fixture. 



“Lexy, can you stop shaking?” She’d complain very often. I was probably shaking, but also, she couldn’t sit still at all because she was scared that I would snip off her ear. 



“You asked me to do it!” 



“Yeah, I didn’t expect you to be such a pussy about it, though.” Calling a sixteen-year-old boy a pussy was a low blow, even for her. Kat had no room to speak when she kept wincing every time I cut an inch or two of hair above her skin. 



“Whatever. Just shut up. I’m almost done.” 



“Cut it better or I’m gonna tell Tato about your weed problem. And stop leaving hair close to the drain, God, you’re gonna clog it when you wash up.” She rubbed the back of her neck, sore from having to hunch backward while I cut her hair over a plastic bag we separated into two sheets and taped at the bottom of the bathtub. 



“You wanted to dye your hair, and you think that he’s gonna be mad at me for smoking weed sometimes?” 



“Alexei. I do well in school, but you don’t. He’ll be way angrier at you, to be honest. Shut up, and I’ll do your piercings next time he heads to class.” 



“Fine.”  



I reluctantly finished the haircut and cleaned up. She liked how I styled it enough to keep asking me to cut it, and she eventually pierced both my ears and found a friend who could do snakebites. Despite us being from a mainly Orthodox region of Ukraine, our Tato couldn't care less about whatever we did to our appearances, if we didn’t mess up the house. It also helped that he was younger: Kat was born when he was seventeen, and I was born when he was nineteen. He also probably couldn’t muster the effort to scream at us after coming home from class at eleven every other night to wake up at seven the next morning for work.



And that was it. Kat was two years older than me and followed our Tato’s advice to go to med school when she graduated, and she moved out of Chicago to go to UIllinois. Our Tato was hellbent on us pursuing some form of higher education after not finishing his practicing medical license in Simferopol before we left Crimea, and he took night classes after working at a corner store during the day. I just didn’t care much for school, unlike Kat; I got stoned, I learned English to speak it fluently and lose my accent, and I came home.  



But girls liked me enough to try and ask me for my phone number or to hang out after class, but I had some decrepit first-generation iPhone at home that my Tato and I shared. I would give our number to the few girls that pinned me for a foreign, always high, edgy dude, and then they would ignore me for days straight when my Tato texted them back with ‘is this for pharmacy clerk job?’  



From my friends who played video games and didn’t care that I got high immediately after school, I met my first girlfriend because she needed a date to prom for her senior year when I was a sophomore. Her name was Jen, she potently smelled of champagne vanilla body spray, and she had dark brown, long hair with bleached tips. She wore a starkly red dress that looked horrible next to my pale skin, bony, pin-straight frame, and sparrow-colored hair. Jen was my first kiss and my first time, and she also told me to stop talking during sex so that I didn’t say any disjointed English and Ukrainian blotted phrases. Not a horrible choice, because I still sounded like a strangled cat when I slipped into my native accent while rushing my words in English. 



The next two years were blurry. I can only remember the pockets of time that Kat would return home during Christmas to see us, and I could hear her crying at the kitchen table about school when I went upstairs to our room. Sometimes about her workload, her scholarships not taking care of her loans, or guys that hurt her. I always took her choosing not to share her problems with me in university as her not wanting to be close with me at all. To me, anyway, the issues she had with being approached by guys seemed like unnecessary complaints: hell, I would’ve given anything for attention and desire from anyone.  



Before I graduated from high school, our Tato was shot while he was stopping by the Ukrainian Village in the near west side of Chicago before heading to his night classes. It was obviously a targeted attack on the neighborhood following the Crimean annexation, but the suspect, caught on video footage outside the grocery our Tato was shot at, was only charged with manslaughter. Americans *really* do not like to press the terrorism charge on murders, especially when the victims are immigrants on a visa rather than U.S. citizens. 



A few of his coworkers and Kat took a train to the funeral procession in an Orthodox Church in rural, hayfield-surrounded Illinois, and some of our neighbors paid visits to me the following days. I didn’t cry, but I stared at blank walls after taking decorations off them to prepare the house to be moved out of, damp weight boring into my eye sockets for days after. 



I ate dollar store brand Fruit Loops and drank canned espresso shots for meals a few weeks following until I realized I needed to pay off electrical and water bills. My Tato’s bank account was hemorrhaging money to pay for the house’s mortgage, and I was incompetent and unemployed after graduating. Kat told me to suck it up for as long as I could, and that she would give me some leftover money she had from interning at a lab near her school to sponsor me getting out of our childhood home. 



I searched for work over the summer once the house was sold with the help of my neighbor’s real estate agent, got a barely above minimum wage job as a waiter, and leased a studio apartment. All my high school friends were planning to enroll in university that fall, while I was living alone in all my 500 square feet in an apartment complex with Latin ornamented, bright green front doors. But I had a scalloped ceiling, and they didn’t, sooooo.  



With the extra money that I got from Tato’s estate, around a hundred or so dollars after my security deposit and having to split his bank account with Kat, I impulse adopted a cat from a rescue café in town. A sandy orange tabby with a chipped tooth and crooked tan nose that sidled up to my leg within minutes of me entering the building. I picked her up while sitting on a scratched-up armchair, waiting for coffee, and she flailed away from me before dangling her legs straight down like a ragdoll. That established our relationship. I signed her adoption papers the same day and named her Mitsy. 



Incompetent and bored, I turned nineteen and dragged myself to my job every day in a mechanical routine. Being told that I could be something great in the future when I was younger was a high expectation when I crawled back to my apartment after a shift and deflated on a full-size bed every night at nineteen with my cat hogging half of my pillow. Since I wasn’t attending college, I didn’t have the social life that I thought would appear after high school. I wanted the things that I lacked before, that I deserved in the dull fog of my routine.  



In the beginning of winter, just after most of the trees around my apartment turned into brindled, dead stick-like figures that would soon be covered in snow that wouldn’t melt until March, I created an account on a chatting app to try and make friends online—hopefully, close to Chicago, but I would’ve accepted any form of contact at that point. I presented as myself, really, except I attempted to emphasize every trait I knew made me somewhat different. Understanding, biting, alternative, anything that made me seem more of an interesting person who wasn’t constantly coping with a plateauing bank account and being a half-assed hermit. 



After a few days joining base-level gaming chats and communities—all the games I liked were either free or bought way early into high school on the Xbox I took from my old house, so it made my gaming library really, really depressing-looking–I found a direct message in my inbox.  



Before opening it, I navigated to the user’s profile. The profile picture was a blurry, landscape shot in the woods, shot like an indie album cover with the texture of a crackling, glossy-printed photo. Maybe it was a screenshot of an actual album cover; I didn’t investigate further. I knew how to reverse image search, but I assumed that it was from an obscure band and didn’t want to sound stupid pulling information to talk about directly from the internet. 



‘I really like *band name* too; my favorite song is their third most popular song, so that I sound like I know enough about them to be interesting and deep!’ I stopped doing that as soon as I told a customer at work that my favorite Sublime song was *Doin’ Time,* Jen listened to a cover of it in the car ride to prom, and I didn’t know enough of the actual discography to continue making conversation. 



The short biography attached just wrote that he was 26, lived in Aurora, and was interested in computer science and psychology. No idea if that meant he had a degree in either field or not, but I went along with the narrative that he did. The only connection we had was that we both were in a server for cataloguing and chatting about stolen versions of older Xbox and PlayStation games. I didn’t explicitly describe that I was from Illinois in the server or on my profile, but I was secretly really, really happy that he found my profile and was in the area. I opened the message. 

 

**Wednesday, 11 December** 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:07 CST*** 

Hey, 

Are you active on here? 

 

I leaned slightly forward to read the screen, squinting at the text on my dim monitor. I rolled up the sleeves of my white dress shirt, feeling the tackiness of a drink that I spilled earlier on the underside of my wrist’s cuff before replying. I knew I didn’t have a lot of time before I needed to change and shower, and Mitsy had dinner already, so she was clawing up the side of my bedframe to lie down. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:13 CST*** 

yeah 

why 

 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:13 CST*** 

You seem interesting. 

You only talk with other people in the server instead of posting any downloads or asking for Mediafire links. 

What’s that about? 

 

My actual reasoning for using the server as a chat forum rather than a resource for pirating was obvious. I was lonely as hell: you can read above again. So, I answered with a close-to-the-truth lie. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:13 CST*** 

don't know many people irl with the same interest 

esp in my area lol 

 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:14 CST is typing...*** 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:14 CST*** 

Well, same for me. Lmao. 

You wrote that you are in CST on your profile. 

You live near Chicago? 

 

The jump to discussing my location was a bit abrupt. Especially since he guessed correctly. But, of course, Chicago’s the most populous city in CST. It’s not like I lived in Springfield, and he immediately caught that I did. It was an easy guess. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:14 CST*** 

yeah 

since around spring 2014 

 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:15 CST*** 

Damn, you could have afforded to move to Chicago five years ago? How old are you? 

 

I forgot that I didn’t disclose my age on my profile. I honestly just assumed that people would think I was on the younger side based on the way I talked. I contemplated telling him—the itch to refuse was *heavily* reinforced by the hour-long assemblies about internet safety in high school and my Tato yelling at me for talking to strangers in Call of Duty lobbies when I was eleven. But I was an adult now, who cared what my age was if I wasn’t like, thirteen? 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:15 CST*** 

19 

my dad moved us here to finish his med school 

 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:15 CST is typing...*** 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:16 CST*** 

Huh. He must’ve been young if he was still finishing med school. 

Was he studying somewhere else? 

 

I felt an electric, scraping shiver pass through me at the fact that he was using the past tense to ask about my Tato. Probably, I’d forgotten some complicated grammar rules in English since graduation, but it was odd that he used ‘must’ve been’ instead of ‘must be.’ I shrugged it off. There was no way he knew that my Tato had passed. I also felt slightly weird that he didn’t end the conversation immediately after discovering the around seven-year gap between us. But I wanted to keep talking to him in the moment. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:16 CST*** 

yeah 

we lived in Ukraina 

\*Ukraine 

\*Crimea 

 

I rapidly corrected and recorrected my native spelling within moments of my second message. I knew enough about people on the internet to also assume that some wouldn’t be 100% absolutely happy with me considering Simferopol and Crimea as Ukraine. 

 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:17 CST*** 

Oh. 

That explains your move in 2014. 

And your username. 

What does it mean, btw? 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:17 CST*** 

just words with similar sounds lol 

i liked pokemon when i was little 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:18 CST*** 

anyway i might need to hop off soon 

just came back from work 

 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:18 CST is typing...*** 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:18 CST*** 

That sucks. 

Maybe we can talk more later. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:18 CST*** 

yeah, for sure 

 

I moved to press the power-off button on my monitor before sitting back straight in my desk chair. I never got an actual name for E besides his username. And I had a slowly surfacing urge that I wanted to know. I wanted to know so that we could keep talking soon. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:19 CST*** 

btw before i go offline 

what does E stand for? 

 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:19 CST is typing...*** 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:19 CST***  

Elijah. 

Just wanted to keep my name ambiguous. 

Especially in a server that has actual crime going on, lol. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:19 CST*** 

ahhh 

everybody is a pirate tho lmao. idk if it’s that severe of a crime for me to care 

but i guess you’re right 

anyway, ttyl 

 

**E (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:20 CST*** 

TTYL??? 

What is this, Myspace? 

Goodnight. 

 

I snorted at his very dated comment before going to his profile to change his name displayed on my screen. I kept the autocapitalization of his name since he seemed bent on typing as grammatically correct as possible. I moved to shut off my computer again before I got another ping from the app. 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:21 CST*** 

\*Goodnight, Alexei. 

 

Smiling to myself at his response, I powered off my monitor before realizing that I was even excited that he corrected his dismissal with my name. Ew. Gross, me. I stood up from my desk and kicked my cloth laundry basket from my bathroom door to get inside the cubicle room. Mitsy immediately climbed inside the basket once it was pushed between the corner of the door and my apartment wall. 



While I was getting ready to shower, I hung the top of my dress shirt from the bathroom’s ventilation window after smudging in the drink spill on my shirt cuff with stain remover. I also jabbed myself on the back of one of my piercings while I was taking it out from the bottom of my lip, but just smeared the blood on the inside of my sink’s bowl. I didn’t clean it until the next morning because I really couldn’t care that much until my next shift. I just didn’t think to until I realized how gross it was, yikes. 

 

I didn’t get another reply on the app until a similar time the next night, but I’d changed and fed Mitsy before he sent anything. I also installed the app on my phone earlier during work, just in case I desperately needed the boost of getting a notification on shift to push me through the day. I turned on my monitor and waited for my PC to boot before opening the app again after checking my notifications on other websites. Mitsy leapt behind the monitor, and I had to shoo her away from chewing up wires behind my PC before she slid behind the desk to get out. Within ten minutes of me being online, I got a new ping. 

 

**Thursday, 12 December** 

**Kat (@kats\_oroka)** ***at 20:30 CST*** ***has sent you a friend request.*** 

 

I stopped and sat back from the computer. There was no actual way that it was Kat. I opened the account’s profile, noticing it had absolutely nothing written in the bio other than ‘hi’. The profile picture was one of the robot anime girls, the one with the blue hair, scrappily drawn on MS Paint but definitely stolen from another website. Damnit, it was probably Kat. 

 

**Kat (@kats\_oroka)** ***at 20:31 CST*** 

hi 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:31 CST*** 

? 

is this actually you katya 

how did you find me? 

 

**Kat (@kats\_oroka)** ***at 20:31 CST*** 

no 

I just like stealing people’s identities 

hit the Add Friends from Contacts button on your phone, you doof 

 

I groaned, pressing my fingertips deep enough over my closed eyes to feel some pushback before letting go and replying. She was still irritating. What did I expect? 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:32 CST*** 

im not on mobile rn you DOOF 

also unlike you i dont like everyone having my contact info on this platform 

why are you using your full name here 

dont you remember what tato taught us about internet safety 

 

**Kat (@kats\_oroka)** ***at 20:32 CST*** 

fine 

I’ll change it :( 

\#incel 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:32 CST*** 

IM NOT AN INCEL!!! 

 

**Kat (@kats\_oroka)** ***at 20:33 CST*** 

you sound really defensive, RN 

you're the one hanging out on this app all the time 

I'm only on one server and I use it to find funny videos 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:33 CST*** 

u r so annoying 

u dont know my daily Gripes dont judge 

im only on here to download emulators 

 

I was already exhausted from having to advocate for myself to her, so the next message that appeared on my screen made me laugh hard. 

 

**Kat (@kattybratty)** ***at 20:34 CST*** 

there I changed it 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:34 CST*** 

EW 

YOURE SO GROSS 

 

**Kat (@kattybratty)** ***at 20:34 CST*** 

LOL 

wait, it won’t let me change back 

it has a cooldown 

NO I can’t do this I can’t live this way 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:35 CST*** 

LOSER 

 

**Kat (@kattybratty)** ***at 20:35 CST*** 

now our usernames are on level playing terrain 

I’m assuming you haven’t met anyone who knows Ukrainian slang LMAO 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:35 CST*** 

no 

just some weird ppl and one alright dude 

also id expect anyone who speaks ukrainian on here knows what it means bc they r not elderly and senile

 

**Kat (@kattybratty)** ***at 20:36 CST*** 

ew 

I’m gonna close this now bc I’m bored 

I’m assuming that you respond here faster than texting 

 

I knew that texting was a lot easier for her when she was at her internship, but I didn’t need to talk to her on my phone if I wasn’t in an emergency. Besides, it would just help me after work to only use one app for messaging.  

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:36 CST*** 

yeah wtv 

have fun with ur big important studies 

cure cancer tmrw 

 

I closed the conversation, almost immediately getting a notification after. 

 

**Thursday, 12 December** 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:37 CST*** 

Are you online? 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:41 CST*** 

yeah 

usually people are online when they have the online status but idk 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:41 CST*** 

Haha, funny. 

You should go make buddies in an improv troop.  

They’d love you. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:42 CST*** 

would love to do that  

except id be shamed for not getting into their school 

flogged in the university town square 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:42 CST*** 

You’re not in college? 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:42 CST*** 

no 

my dad didnt invest much in an american college fund 

we were this thing called immigrants 

idrc about further education anyway 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:43 CST*** 

Why? 

You’re smart enough. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:43 CST*** 

money 

im also not that smart lol 

didnt get good grades in hs 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:43 CST*** 

It’s hilarious that you think that you’re not. 

But, yeah. Grades might be an issue. 

Money is also an issue. 

 

He stopped responding for a second, making me sit back in my seat. Maybe, he just wanted to end the conversation early; it was kind of a lost cause to convince me that I was even intelligent. I was a stoner in school and barely cared about anything other than speaking English fluently enough to not sound stupid and have no accent. Which sucked, because I couldn’t fall away naturally from my accent with my Tato and Kat at the house speaking in Ukrainian, so the bitter, Slavic tone remained.  

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:45 CST is typing...*** 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:45 CST*** 

So. 

Do you work now? 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:45 CST*** 

yeah 

waiter at a fancier restaurant 

get to wear a nice uniform and get paid subpar wages

get to be a businessman without doing business 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:45 CST*** 

Seems really lucrative and long-term. 

You want to stay in that field forever? 

Minimum wage? 

 

I snorted to myself at his question before sitting with my thoughts, biting at the inside of my cheek as I tried to explain the route to any career path in my mind. I didn’t think about the future much, I guess I assumed that I would bounce between occupations my entire life and build up a decent resume to, I don’t know, become an executive somewhere? Manage a store, at least? What even was my answer? I totally couldn’t pay for university; I could barely pay for my groceries and Mitsy’s supplies then. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:47 CST*** 

meehh 

sure 

i dont plan on doing much else 

my dream is to become a rock and pop out of reality 

or like phase into the pop art dimension like that one spongebob episode 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:47 CST*** 

Slow response that time. 

Are you even sure? 

 

I thought, ‘really, no.’  

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:47 CST*** 

yeah 

i need money and can’t pay for further education since i cant take out loans

not a us citizen 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:48 CST*** 

Maybe something could help with that. 

In the future. 

 

I blinked a few times to see if I was reading his message right or if the text on my screen was warped from how low-quality my monitor was. *What?* 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:48 CST*** 

what are you, the divine oracle? 

the chance of me winning the lottery is very slim 

or finding a wealthy old person to marry 

old wealthy person? 

what comes first 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:49 CST*** 

Wealthy old person was correct, technically. 

Descriptors come first. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:49 CST*** 

ok english professor 

what do you even do for a living 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:49 CST*** 

Coding. 

Because I went to school and got a computer science degree. And a Master’s. 

 

His behavior made a lot more sense now that I knew he had a graduate degree. Of course, he wanted me to go to college; he basically was the spokesman of post-grad education. Nobody in America who *doesn’t* like education and has common sense goes to school for more than a bachelor’s degree. With that much money invested, you’re just cleaning the scum off the boots of the school’s dean with your tongue. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:50 CST*** 

woooahh 

you must be rolling in money rn 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:50 CST*** 

To you? Yeah. 

I made enough to pay off my loans for graduate school. 

Could probably pay for another round. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:51 CST*** 

the flexing wow 

wdym you can pay for another round??? 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:51 CST*** 

I mean it seriously, Alexei. 

I could. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:51 CST*** 

you use my name like its a slur lol 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:51 CST is typing...*** 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:52 CST***  

Whatever. 

So, you live in Chicago at nineteen and have stable enough income to, again, live in Chicago at nineteen. 

You really have nobody else to talk to? 

 

His change in demeanor seemed somewhat justified with how I nabbed at him for using my name, but really? It felt more awful than I wanted to admit how condescending his message was. Yeah, I didn’t in the moment after Kat went offline. My hands immediately moved to start typing back mindlessly while I could hear Mitsy rummaging under my bed, suddenly lively. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:52 CST*** 

no i dont 

kinda sucks that u bring it up lmfao 

twist the knife harder, oh grand tech wizard! 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:52 CST*** 

Didn’t mean to. 

Was just wondering why you would want to talk to me in your position. 

No girlfriend or anything? 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:53 CST*** 

no 

last time i dated someone was in high school lol 

 

I stared at my message, slightly shocked that I had willingly brought down my ego. I didn’t even know why I decided to confess that I hadn’t been with anyone for that long. He seemed comfortable enough chatting with me to deserve an honest response. Right? 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:53 CST*** 

That’s weird. 

You’re a good enough guy. 

Even if you’re a bit immature. 

But you’re still young, I’ll give you that. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:53 CST*** 

im rlly not great 

might be on ahole level 

not that attractive either 

face only a deadbeat mother could love 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:54 CST*** 

That’s a contradiction for sure. LMAO. 

Besides, there’s no evidence that you’re not alright looking. 

 

I paused, moving my hands off my keyboard and itching to immediately respond with ‘and you’ll never get any’ but knew that for some reason, I wanted him to know what I looked like. There was a rising pool of dread like bile in my stomach at the idea of him thinking I was ugly, but I replied. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:55 CST*** 

ill send a pic of myself if u share something about urself 

guy who wants to remain anonymous bc he pirates Tony Hawk Pro Skater after a day at his very serious coding job 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:55 CST*** 

Sure. 

Cool dig. 

I’m prepared for the worst. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:55 CST*** 

u commit to ur side of the deal first 

sharing is caring!!! 

 

I cringed a little–actually, more–at my message. Why was I so eager for him to respond? I mean, why did I let him know I was so eager to respond? Shaking it off, I stood up to grab my phone, discarded on the nightstand I assembled the weekend before. I remembered leaving the hammer I built it with on my kitchen counter and just, not moving it for a whole work week instead of finding the toolbox it was in. I was shocked that Mitsy hadn’t pushed it off the counter’s ledge yet when she was trying to scrape up the sides of my bedposts while I was pacing around, yowling at me when I got close to try to detach her claws from the wooden bedframe with my phone in my other hand.



 I unlocked my phone and thoughtlessly returned to my monitor setup while I searched for a decent selfie in my camera roll. I sent the photo to my computer and checked my direct messages again for anything new. 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:56 CST*** 

Fine. 

I’m 187 centimeters tall and weigh 86 kilograms.  

Had to convert. 

 

I barely read over the message before I attached the photo. I remember it being a selfie I used for a dating app a month before the conversation. Some well-lit photo facing my studio’s window that I took directly after work, when my shirt didn’t need much adjusting to be neat again.

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:57 CST is typing...*** 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:58 CST is typing...*** 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:58 CST*** 

You don’t have a girlfriend? 

You’re lying. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:58 CST***

wait u wanted to flex on me wow 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 20:59 CST*** 

You’re going to ignore the picture you just sent? 

 

I laughed at his message. Yeah, of course I was ‘going to ignore it.’ I didn’t think I was that good-looking to warrant an awed response. I knew I was at least average; I worked out four days a week in the mornings and didn’t eat like a hog anymore. My hair sucked; it was always between dirty blond and ash brown growing up. And I compensated for having sandy pale skin with dark metals, so I looked grungier. I passed in looks. That’s it. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 20:59 CST*** 

yeah 

im alright looking 

??? 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:00 CST*** 

Not to be weird, 

You are insanely attractive. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:00 CST*** 

thats bordering on weird, yeah 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:00 CST*** 

I mean it seriously. 

That’s you? 

Holy shit. 

 

Yeah, I didn’t believe what he was saying. At all. But it made me want to. Badly. I didn’t know why, but I needed somebody to tell me that after so long of not genuinely being called hot by people I knew. People I cared about enough to respect. Maybe he couldn’t tell that? 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:01 CST*** 

yeah?? 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:01 CST*** 

Damn. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:01 CST*** 

damn what 

u r leaving me with very vague short responses! 

har har 

  

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:01 CST*** 

Nothing. 

If you don’t want me to say anything weird. 

 

‘Anything weird?’ Oh. That meant something to me. I reached over my desk to shut off my monitor like it was a fight-or-flight response before stopping myself, letting my hand return to my keyboard. I didn’t even notice myself replying. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:02 CST*** 

no 

say it 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:02 CST is typing...*** 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:02 CST*** 

I would see you right now if I could. 

 

A gut reaction flared up inside of me to deny. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:02 CST*** 

u cant mean that for sure 

but ill let it be 

haha 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:03 CST*** 

You’re too insecure. 

Too insecure about your looks. 

Anyways, I need to sign off. 

 

His emphasis on how insecure I seemed was weirdly...soothing? It felt like somebody knew enough about me to tell me I deserved something. He was telling me that I should’ve been prouder of myself. And I needed that. It was warmth under my skin when nobody else would provide it. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:03 CST*** 

??? 

ok 

just say u gtg it feels like im talking to george washington if he had a Windows 10 virtual machine on his newtonian instruments 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:03 CST*** 

Fine. 

GTG, Alexei. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:04 CST*** 

its still weird all capitalized and in complete textbook grammar but ok 

goodnight, elijah 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:04 CST*** 

Oh, so we’re on goodnight terms now? 

You didn’t send me that yesterday. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:04 CST*** 

yeah bc u didnt call me hot yesterday 

idot 

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:04 CST*** 

I didn’t know that yesterday. 

You type like a child and not a grown adult. 

It’s a little endearing. 

 

**alexei (*****@pikapapik) at 21:05 CST*** 

woohoo endearing! 

like the babies that look like wrinkly old men 

just like me

 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:05 CST*** 

Shut up about your appearance before I keep talking about it. 

Goodnight, Alexei. 

**Elijah (*****@sodmanblue*****)** ***at 21:05 CST is offline.*** 

 

I inhaled deeply and closed the app within seconds of him going offline, blankly watching the monitor’s screen noise move on my desktop wallpaper. I had to remind myself to blink as my eyes dried up from being open for so long. The drone of Mitsy shuffling through my sheets when she finally jumped onto my bed became audible again in my mind. Did I read his messages right? He couldn’t have been. He probably didn’t like me. I stretched over the backrest of my desk chair, hearing my back crack, before standing up from my setup. 

I needed to not think for a while after that. I boiled water in the microwave to make tea and leaned my forehead against the tinted door for the full 90 seconds, like I wanted to get radiation poisoning. I sat down on my bed and opened my phone, watching Mitsy try and wiggle towards me from her giant, tangled duvet and sheet island.
