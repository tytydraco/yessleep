I stared up at the starry sky. The clouds are gone… I thought. I sat up abruptly in the middle of the field. Both vehicles were in flames, and the field was littered with the dead. The mutilated remains of soldiers lay scattered everywhere.
Am I alive? I looked myself over. There wasn’t even a scratch on me. I was just covered in soot from the smoke, and my clothes were a little damp.

“Ed? Damn it… Ed!” I sprang up from the ground. But Ed’s car was burning. His last glance flashed in my mind. Ed was dead.

The tasks! My heart jumped in panic.
What time was it? I looked at my wristwatch. But something was wrong, every single hand pointed to noon. Or rather… they weren’t even moving like clock hands anymore. It was as if they’d turned into a compass. No matter how I turned my arm, every hand pointed in the same direction.

What happened? I was completely disoriented,probably from the blast, and from the fact that I’d just woken up in a blood-soaked field.
I looked around in terror as the reality sank in.
Ed was dead, the Company had most likely blown up our car, the package we were supposed to deliver was destroyed, and I was alone in the middle of a field with no help. On top of that, my phone was still in the burning car. Perfect… things couldn’t get any better than this.

Only then, as my vision cleared, did I really take in my surroundings.
A massive figure was tossing a ball back and forth with a small shape not far from me. In the darkness, I couldn’t really see them, but I didn’t expect anything good. I figured I’d probably die here too, just like Ed.


As I stood there, completely broken, watching the dark silhouettes playing catch, someone spoke to me.


“Sir, are you okay?” I heard a small voice ask.


I turned my head wearily, without hope.
A little boy stood there. The flames from the burning cars lit up his figure. He had no neck, his head connected straight to his torso. One of his eyes was clouded and gray, hair grew only in sparse clumps on his abnormally large head. His lips were gone, revealing a mess of rotten, crooked teeth. His hands bent in unnatural directions.


“Me? I think I’m fine,” I replied with a calmness as if it weren’t such a strange little figure standing before me.


“That’s good,” said the boy. “Do you want to come play with us?”


I didn’t answer him. I just kept looking toward the center of the field, where a tall figure was still tossing a ball back and forth with several children. But as I watched their shadows, I realized they were all distorted. One shadow had three arms. Another’s small, twisted body was so bent that its hands still touched the ground.
I was calm… Maybe I should have been afraid, but I don’t know why, every emotion had simply left me.


“You, boy,” I said to the strange child I had been talking to. “Did you all come from the trees?”


“Yes,” the boy said, nodding as he started back toward the other children playing.


“Can you show me where?” I asked, surprising even myself.


I knew it wasn’t the normal reaction… or maybe it was? But there, in that moment, I decided I wasn’t going back. This place had almost killed me, the Company had almost killed me, if it was even them who blew up the cars. And if I did go back to my bleak life, then what? Work some lousy job, if I even found one, earn a pittance, scrape by month after month? Or be sent back here again? I’d rather stay. And let whatever comes, come.

At first, I kept my distance from the other children. No matter how indifferent I’d become to strange events like this, it still seemed wise to give them some space.

There were maybe ten or fifteen kids in the field. Each had some physical deformity, I pitied them, but they were so cheerful and playful that you could almost forget some of them were missing body parts, others had too many, or their faces were twisted or incomplete. As it turned out, the “tall figure” was also a child. Poor kid, he looked like a mutant boy, with the mind of a five-year-old. He stared at the ground shyly when the smaller boy introduced me to him.

The children didn’t seem eager for me to go into the forest. Only the little round-headed boy agreed to lead me into the trees. The others kept glancing at me nervously, as if they were afraid,or as if they were protecting something.


“Come on, Stebe,” the boy said, pronouncing my name strangely without lips.


I just nodded and followed him into the trees. Luckily, under a half-crushed soldier, I had found my flashlight, so I didn’t have to wander through the forest in total darkness.


“Boy, where exactly are we going?” I asked.


“You’ll see. We’re almost there.”


Should I have been suspicious? This whole place was pure dread—the rabbit-masked ones, the returning dead, the constantly changing tasks… not to mention whatever it was that slaughtered an entire squad of soldiers. But then I saw where the boy was leading me.

In the middle of the forest, between the trees, there was an entrance. Stone steps led down into the earth. Neon lights lined the concrete walls, illuminating the stairwell. It looked like something from an underground hospital. The steps only went down a short way before giving way to a long corridor whose end was hidden in darkness.


“What is this place?” I asked warily.


The deformed boy just shrugged, as if he didn’t know.

“Did you come from here too?” I pressed.


The boy nodded yes.


“And what’s down there?”


“Lots of things, Stebe. But I don’t know either. Can I go back to play with the others now?”


Suspicion gnawed at me as I stared at the steps. What could this place be? And what was it that pushed me to go down there?
I don’t know why I made these choices, what drove me… but I started down the stairs without a word.


“Wait, Stebe,” the boy called after me. “Down there, if the light goes out, just wait until it comes back on.”


“All right,” I nodded. “Thanks for the tip.”


I continued my descent into the long stairwell, and the boy hobbled away.


The corridor—I thought it would never end. I had no idea how long I’d been walking, or where I was headed. I just kept moving forward, the neon lights stretching endlessly ahead of me.

Then I saw it: a large opening at the end of the corridor. No door, just an archway, and beyond it… nothing less than a vast field.
A field, underground. Full of towering sunflowers.


The sight was completely surreal: a massive hall with a sprawling sunflower meadow inside. Neon lights illuminated the entire space. At the far end of the hall was another gateway, leading deeper underground via a flight of stairs.
As much as I feared stepping into the sunflower chamber, something pulled me onward. Maybe curiosity,or something deeper. Without much thought, I stepped out from the corridor into the vast space.
The moment I entered, a strange feeling washed over me. I couldn’t put it into words… like someone was watching me, and somehow I wanted them to.

Suspiciously, I glanced around the sunflower field. The stalks were tall, just barely low enough for me to see over. No one was there—only the high, hospital-like walls and the neon lights.

I began walking toward the other exit. The room was silent except for the faint hum of the lights. The sunflowers were strong and healthy, but none of them faced the same way; each stood at a random angle. I knew sunflowers usually turned toward the sun, but that hardly surprised me anymore. I was, after all, walking through an underground sunflower field.

I don’t know when it happened, but I was just walking straight ahead… and then suddenly, I looked around and found myself among the sunflowers.

Panicked, I turned back and started running. I couldn’t explain what frightened me, but I didn’t want to stay in their midst. After only a few meters, I burst back out onto the path that ran between the two exits.

Something wasn’t right about this place. In fact, this was where it truly began. I could barely move toward the far exit. As I started down the path, a moment later I realized I was back among the sunflowers—or at least on the verge of stepping into them again. I wasn’t making any progress toward the stairs at all.

I stopped in the middle of the path.
Fine. Let’s wait. Let’s see what happens.


Nothing changed. I don’t know how long I stood there… ten, twenty minutes, maybe an hour. But nothing moved. The sunflowers stood frozen, still pointing in all directions.

Then, by pure accident, I glanced at my watch. I expected to check how long I’d been standing there… but the hands were still scrambled. All pointing in the same direction.


“What if I followed that?” the thought struck me.


Without hesitation, I began walking where the hands pointed. I took only two steps to the right before, like a compass—the hands instantly swung forward.

That must be the way out.

It wasn’t easy moving like this. A few steps in and the watch hands would shift again. Sometimes I would overstep and have to yank myself back so I wouldn’t fall. But at least with this method, I was moving—slowly but surely—following my watch as if it were a compass.

I didn’t even realize when I ended up between the sunflowers again. Thank God… who knows what might have been lurking deeper inside.

At last, I pushed my way through to the other side. Another stairwell lay ahead, deeper and far darker than the one I had come from. The same green, hospital-colored walls, but now dirty, abandoned. The neon lights flickered here and there, with long stretches of darkness between them.

I turned back for one last look at the great sunflower field. But what I saw was something I never expected.

At the far end of the path, at the entrance where I had first stepped into the sunflower chamber, someone was standing there. Staring in.

And it wasn’t just anyone… it was me.

I froze completely. The other “me” didn’t move. Just stood there, staring at me.

Then it hit me, it wasn’t another version of me. It was me. As if I were looking into a mirror that showed what had been. How I had arrived here.

At this point, nothing had rules anymore. Not even time.

I had to keep going. That was the only choice left.


The descent wasn’t easy. In some places, there was almost no light at all. Luckily, I still had my flashlight, but I wanted to conserve its power, I had no idea how long I’d be down here.

The stairs were in terrible condition, and this passage went far deeper than the first one. At last, I reached the bottom again: a dimly lit corridor. The hospital-like walls here were crumbling, the neon lights only flickered, and the floor was riddled with cracks.

I walked along the corridor for a long time. At first, I stepped cautiously, slowly. This place unnerved me with its state of decay. As I made my way through the long, seemingly endless hallway, I began to notice strange noises. Like chains rattling, or some kind of metallic clanging. At first it was faint, far away, but the closer I moved toward it, the louder it became.

Then I saw something in the distance. It looked like a desk, and someone sitting behind it. Again… who could that be? I thought.

I picked up my pace, but the metallic clatter grew deafening, and now there were voices too. Many voices… like monkeys screaming in a zoo.

By then I was almost running toward the desk. But it was no use…

An ancient, battered writing desk stood there, directly in front of a massive iron gate that sealed off the rest of the corridor. The gate blocked the way completely. On the desk sat a dusty, outdated computer; its bulky cube-shaped monitor hadn’t lit up in years.

Seated in the chair was a man’s corpse. Judging by its dried, almost skeletal state, it had been there for years.

What truly shocked me, though, was his clothing—he was wearing the exact same mall security guard uniform I had on.

He’d been one of the Company’s men.


There was no other entrance, nothing I could use to get past that massive gate. The rattling chains, the metallic pounding, and the animal-like shouting all came from behind it.

The dead guard’s computer was smashed to pieces, someone had beaten it with a screwdriver. I found nothing useful on the corpse. The only question left was: who had this man been, and what was he doing here? What was he guarding?

I kept searching, hoping to find a key or something that would let me through, but came up empty-handed. Feeling a bit hopeless, I continued my search—when I noticed that the lights at the far end of the corridor were beginning to shut off. One by one. Darkness crept toward me, as if something was coming.

I swallowed hard. A chill ran down my spine. If something attacked me here, there’d be no escape… But then I remembered the strange little boy’s warning:


"Just wait until it’s light again."


So I did. I sat down against the wall, and almost instantly, everything around me was swallowed in darkness.

It was awful, sitting there in pitch black. The rattling of chains and the howls seemed even louder now. Through the wall, I could feel something tugging or shaking nearby metal structures. But I kept waiting. I had no better idea.
Then, without warning, the neon lights snapped back on. And the place… had changed.

The corridor was clean and orderly again. Not a crack in the walls or the floor, all the neon lights shining bright and new. The whole place looked freshly restored.


“Jesus! Who the hell…? What? How did you get in here?!” someone shouted in panic.


That’s when I saw him, an African-American man sitting at the desk, staring at me in shock, halfway out of his chair.


“Who are you?” he asked nervously.


“Steve. Don’t worry, I’m not here to hurt you,” I replied calmly.


“Where did you come from? Ah, damn it… This is bad again,” he muttered, and began typing furiously on the computer in front of him.


“May I ask your name?” I tried to keep my tone friendly.


“Ben,” he shot back, still on edge.


I got up from the floor and stepped toward him. Ben was fully absorbed in his work. He was speaking to someone through what looked like an old-fashioned messaging system. The program was so outdated it looked like it belonged in the 1970s, and it was clear Ben wasn’t very comfortable using it.


“Ben, can I ask you something?” I said gently.


“Hang on… I’m concentrating,” he muttered irritably.


“Ben, do you work for the Company too?” I pressed on, ignoring his request.


Ben stared at me in shock, as if I’d just said something impossible.


“Uh… yeah. You too?” he stammered.


I just nodded.


“Interesting,” Ben mused. “These days, I thought only people like me had trouble finding work.”


I eyed him suspiciously. What was he talking about?


“Ben… can I ask what year it is? After that, I’ll help you with the computer.”


“1972,” he replied instantly.


I stalled for time, asking Ben questions while pretending to be busy on the computer. In truth, I hadn’t even read the green, blinking letters yet, the message the Company had sent him.

Ben told me he’d been working for the Company for about six months. Before that, he couldn’t find a job anywhere because of his skin color, every place had turned him away. One day, though, he came across a newspaper ad: they were hiring security guards, with only one requirement, he had to be able to read. Ben could read and write a little, and the Company hired him without question. They even paid him very well.


“So, what does the message say?” Ben asked impatiently.


That’s when I finally read the message all the way through:


“Please do not speak to the newcomer! Do not tell him anything! This is important! Send him away immediately and tell him to go back!”



The thought shot through my head: I think I’ve just become the Company’s enemy.
What could be down here that they’re so desperate to protect? Something so secret they’ve already blacklisted me?


“Well? What does it say, Steve?” Ben pressed.


“It says to open the gate for me,” I blurted out.


I’m not proud that I lied to Ben. That I deceived him. But I had to find out what was beyond that gate. For Ed, for myself… and for every lost soul that shows up in the field day after day.


“Do you know how to open the gate, Ben?” I asked, seeing him hesitate.


“Uh… maybe… maybe it’s in the manual,” he mumbled.


With a single motion, he pulled open the desk drawer. Inside was a manual just like the ones I’d been given for the field. But this one had only a single word on the cover: Gate.

Ben handed it to me, figuring I could read better than him. The manual was exactly like the others I’d seen, rules about what could and couldn’t be done at the gate, followed by the daily routine, listing times down to the minute, detailing exactly what happened and what needed to be done.

One entry caught my eye:

11:38 – Greet Amanda and ask her what flower she brought from the field. If Amanda is in a good mood, she will open the gate herself. If Amanda is angry, send her back to walk the hallway for a while.



Amanda… I thought. Could it be the same Amanda I’d gardened with? The one who told me to explore instead of just waiting for my paycheck? Was she the reason I was here?


“See anything, Steve?” Ben asked when he noticed my mind had drifted.


“Yeah… yeah,” I said, snapping back. “It says here what to do.”


The command was simple, almost like a line of code or a command-line instruction: all you had to do was type into the computer whether the gate should be open or closed.

Ben looked a bit uneasy, but I didn’t hesitate. More and more pieces were falling into place in my head, and I had to know what this all was.

The massive iron gate began to open with a thunderous rumble, rising upward. A small yellow warning light spun and blinked as the mechanism groaned. Ben and I stood motionless, waiting for it to open fully. As soon as it did, I quickly typed in the command to close it again.
Beyond the gate stretched a short corridor, and not far ahead, another vast chamber glowed with light, like the sunflower room—but I couldn’t make out what was inside.


“Ben… once I’m through the gate, hit Enter, okay?”


Ben just nodded.
I walked slowly through, then waved to him to go ahead and close it behind me.


“Take care in there, Steve.”


“You too, Ben. If you can… maybe just go home now, please.”


The gate lowered behind me, and the instant it sealed shut, I heard the chains thrashing, the metallic vibration, and the horrific, animalistic screams, deafening now. The gate slammed closed with a shudder.
The neon lights began to flicker. Are they going to go out again? The thought flashed through me, and as if on cue, they all went dark—at once.

I stood there with my back pressed to the gate, waiting in the darkness, listening to the frenzy echoing from somewhere far beyond.

Suddenly, the lights returned, or rather, what little of them was left. Only a few lamps were working. Roots dangled from the walls, and the place looked like a ruin. The gate was half-open, rusted, ancient, not at all like the one Ben and I had just operated.

I crouched and peered under it. The other side was almost pitch black. I pulled out my flashlight to see better.

And in the beam of light, I noticed something that made my blood run cold: the body at the desk… was gone.

Was Ben that body? Had I changed the past?
Or was I now in an entirely different place altogether?


I kept walking down the hallway, the clinking and rattling growing louder with every step.

I’d long since left the iron gate behind when I entered a massive chamber. There was barely any light here either, but I used my flashlight to cut through the darkness, though maybe it was better I couldn’t see everything clearly.

On both sides of the room were rows of cages. A single path ran straight down the middle toward an exit on the far end, just like in the sunflower room.

The moment I stepped inside, something slammed into the bars of a cage on my left, shaking them violently like a madman. Startled, I whipped my flashlight toward it.

It was a person… or at least, it looked like one. Completely naked, its skin was ghostly white, without any genitalia. Its face was human, but horribly distorted—its mouth filled with jagged teeth jutting in all directions, lips entirely missing, and its eyes pure white, clouded like those of the blind. I recoiled in shock.

As the light hit it, the creature stopped shaking the bars and covered its face, as if the beam caused it unbearable pain. It slunk back into the shadows of the cage, trying to hide. That’s when I saw there were more of them, identical pale beings crouched together in the darkness.
They huddled close to one another like frightened animals, hissing and shrieking while swiping at me with twisted, clawed hands to ward off the light.


“Leave… them… alone,” someone growled behind me.


The voice was strange, muffled, as if something was in their mouth. Then the blood in my veins turned to ice, I recognized it. I’d heard it that night with Ed.
I spun around quickly, not wanting to feel completely exposed. And there it was, the figure from my nightmares.

It stood behind the bars on the opposite side of the path, directly across from the pale creatures. And behind it… was him. The man in the rabbit mask. Standing motionless in his dirty suit.


“What are these? What are you?” I demanded.


No answer. The figure simply turned on its heel and began to shuffle deeper into the cage. I followed with my light, trying to see where it was going.

Then I saw it, the place it was leading me to.

A banquet hall, with a massive dining table in the center surrounded by countless chairs. Seated around it were dozens of rotting, rabbit-masked figures in fine clothes.

They all moved as if at a grand feast, eating, drinking, and seeming to converse cheerfully. The familiar white rabbit-mask figure returned to the table and sat at the head. Then it lifted an invisible glass into the air, as though making a toast.

I silently thanked whatever force had put those bars between us.


I had no idea what to make of these beings.
On my right, the rabbit-masked banquet continued. They seemed to be enjoying themselves, yet in utter silence. There was no food on the table, no utensils, yet they acted as if they were at the finest dinner in the world.

On my left, the pale creatures crouched together. Some behaved with total madness—slamming their heads into the bars or violently attacking each other. All of them feared the beam of my flashlight. Whenever they saw, or perhaps felt, me approaching, they would scream and retreat to the back of their cages.

The hall was vast. I walked for a long time before finally reaching the other end. The tall cages on both sides accompanied me the whole way, the bars the only comfort—keeping me from facing either the rabbit-masked diners or the pale creatures directly.

I felt a wave of relief when I reached the exit, though it led down yet another set of stairs, plunging into a darkness so deep you could barely tell up from down.

Before leaving, I glanced back one more time at the creatures. I feared them… but in a strange way, I pitied them too. And that’s when it struck me—maybe this was why the rabbit-mask man had asked Ed: “Back?” Was this where they were meant to return?

But what were these beings, truly? My questions only multiplied, while the answers seemed to drift further and further away.


“Yes, Steve… they’ve been here for a very long time,” came a familiar, warm female voice.


I quickly turned the beam of my flashlight toward it. Standing between the cages, from the direction I’d come, was Amanda.
