I work at an animal shelter, I’ve had this job for about two months now, and it’s going great, really. Dogs are my favourite animal, and I love playing with all the dogs that come into our shelter. Most of them are playful fun and happy. But some are not as fortunate, some are timid, angry and not as social. I really feel bad for them, they have tragic backstories. My dream is to save different animals, and help all the animals that come to our shelter.

A few days ago we got a new dog in. I was so excited to play with the new dog, but this one looked… messed up. I know some of the dogs are strays, have been hurt or have injuries, but this dog looked weird not because of an injury. But because it had a smile that stretched ear to ear. With almost a human like facial expression. Its eyes were so small, its mouth, cut open. And it had weird Paws that looked too much like hands. “That is definitely a skinwalker, dude” my co-worker whispers to me.

”What’s a skinwalker?“ I ask. Later when I get home I see an unread message. It’s from my co-worker. He sent me a video explaining what a skinwalker was. When I was about to sleep, I pulled out my phone, finally watching the video. The next morning. I felt extremely tired. Not because I was scared of that dog, even though I was. But because the video was three hours long. At least now I have a good understanding of what skinwalkers are.

When I arrive at work today, I see the new dog’s cage. It’s massive, bigger than all the others. With a huge warning on the cage door: WARNING: Only staff members passed this point.

I have never seen that sign on any other dog, at least not for no reason. The ’dog’ in question, is a husky. With fluffy white fur. But disturbingly realistic facial features. Unfortunately , I have been tasked with going over to the dog and petting it. I slowly walk over to it, it’s breathing heavily, and when I pet the husky’s fur, I get chills. The dog‘s fur feels warm, wet and not fluffy, almost like skin, like a reptilian animal. I try to slowly back away, but the dog gives me a menacing stare, smiling. I can’t tell if it is smiling happily or horrifically.

In the afternoon, we get three new dogs taken into the shelter. These ones look cute and fluffy. I can’t wait to pet them, later it’s confirmed they are all Pomeranians. I try to pet them but I hear a loud howl, I get startled, and try to look around and find the source of the sound, all I can see is the husky staring at me, wide eyes, head banged up against the glass. Its eyes are even more distorted. They have a pink tint to them, and are almost blank, a faded black pupil just visible beneath its eyes.

My heart pounds when I receive news that I have to feed that weird husky. I slowly walk over to its cage, a plate of food in hand. I slowly unlock the cage door, I hear it’s weird heavy breathing as soon as I do so. But something shocks me, I see blood, dripping from the husky‘s stretched out mouth. I slowly lower the plate of food, but to my surprise, the dog isn’t interested in the food I give him. I start to have some serious doubts if it is really a dog. But suddenly, it looks at me, staring with a wide smile. Then, it bites my hand with incredible force. “OWWWW!” I scream, in a fit of rage, I try to grab the dogs mouth shut. Eventually, I get it back in it’s cage.

That night, I try as hard as I can to fall asleep but something doesn’t feel right. I watch some more skinwalker videos, and video by video, it gets more and more like the dog at the shelter. After hours, I finally fall asleep but am awoken by a strange howling noise. I’m terrified, I look out the window and to my shock, there it is. The husky, standing on two legs, its legs and arms, thinner and outstretched. It’s smile almost too uncanny, it has pointed ears and is so tall. I try to call the police but I take another look at the dog, and it just waves at me. I never understood how it escaped the animal shelter…
