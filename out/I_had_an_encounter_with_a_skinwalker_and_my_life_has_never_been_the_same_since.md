It all started when I was out hiking in the mountains. I had always loved the solitude and the sense of adventure that came with being out in nature. But on this particular trip, I wasn't alone for long.

I had been hiking for hours when I saw it, a strange figure in the distance. At first, I thought it was just a person, maybe another hiker or a park ranger. But as I got closer, I realized that it wasn't a person at all. It was something else, something dark and sinister.

The figure was tall and lean, with long, lanky limbs and a head that seemed too large for its body. Its skin was mottled and gray, and it seemed to shimmer and change as it moved.

I tried to run, but my legs wouldn't move. I was frozen in place, staring at the creature as it approached. And then, it spoke to me.

"I am a skinwalker," it said, its voice a low, guttural growl. "I can take any form I desire. And now, I have chosen yours."

I tried to scream, but no sound came out. The skinwalker reached out a hand and touched my face, and I felt a strange, creeping sensation all over my body.

And then, it happened. My skin started to crawl and shift, as if something was moving beneath it. I could feel my bones stretching and reforming, my face contorting into something unrecognizable.

I was a skinwalker now, just like the creature that had attacked me. And I knew that I would never be able to go back to my old life.

I wandered the mountains for days, trying to find a way to reverse the transformation. But no matter what I tried, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was trapped inside this new, alien body.

As the days turned into weeks, I started to feel like I was losing my grip on reality. The voices in my head grew louder, urging me to do things that I knew were wrong. And the shadows, they seemed to be everywhere, following me wherever I went.

I knew that I couldn't keep running forever. Sooner or later, I would have to face the truth about what had happened to me. And so, I made my way back to civilization, to the place where it had all started.

I arrived in the small mountain town late at night, my body battered and bruised from my journey. I knew that I couldn't stay there long, that I had to keep moving. But something about the place called to me, a faint memory of a life that I had left behind.

I made my way to the only place that felt like home, the old cabin in the woods where I had spent so many happy summers as a child. But as I approached,Â I saw that the cabin was no longer abandoned. There were lights on inside, and I could hear laughter and music coming from within.

I hesitated, unsure of what to do. Part of me wanted to turn and run, to disappear into the shadows and never look back. But another part of me, a deeper, more primal part, was drawn to the warmth and the light of the cabin.

I found myself moving closer, drawn in by the music and the laughter. And then, I saw him. He was standing in the doorway, a tall, handsome man with piercing blue eyes and a broad smile.

I knew him, or at least I thought I did. His name was David, and we had been friends as kids. I remembered spending long summer days with him at the cabin, swimming in the lake and exploring the woods.

David's face lit up when he saw me. "Is that really you?" he exclaimed, a look of amazement on his face.

I nodded, my heart racing. "It's me," I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

David's smile faded a little as he took in my appearance. "What happened to you?" he asked, concern etched on his face.

I shook my head, unable to find the words. "I don't know," I said. "I just...changed."

David looked at me for a long moment, and then he reached out and took my hand. "Come on," he said, his voice soft and gentle. "Let's go inside. We have a lot of catching up to do."

I followed him into the cabin, into the light and the warmth. And for the first time in what felt like an eternity, I felt like maybe, just maybe, I was home.

But as the night wore on, the voices in my head grew louder, more insistent. They were telling me to do things, things that I knew were wrong. And the shadows, they seemed to be everywhere, following me wherever I went.

I tried to ignore them, to focus on my conversation with David. But it was no use. The voices were too loud, too powerful.

And then, it happened. I couldn't control myself anymore. I grabbed a knife from the kitchen and turned on David, my old friend and the only person who had ever truly cared about me.

I don't remember what happened after that. All I know is that when I woke up, David was lying on the floor in a pool of blood. And I was standing over him, the knife in my hand.

I knew then that I could never go back, that I was doomed to wander the wilderness forever, a monster condemned to live in the shadows. And so, I ran. I ran into the darkness and the cold, never looking back.

I don't know how much longer I can keep running. The voices in my head are getting louder and louder, and the shadows seem to be following me wherever I go. I'm scared, and I don't know what to do.

If you're reading this, please help me. I don't know who I am anymore, or what I've become. All I know is that I'm lost, and I need someone to guide me back to the light.

I know I've done things, terrible things, that I can never undo. But I'm not a monster, not really. I'm just a lost, confused girl who made a terrible mistake.

Please, if you see me, don't be afraid. I'm not going to hurt you. I just want to find my way home, to the place where I belong.

So if you see me, if you're out there and you know how to help me, please don't turn away. Reach out to me, and show me the way back to the light. I don't know how much longer I can keep running, but I know that I don't want to do it alone.
