pls tell me someone else has seen this book pls tell me someone else knows what to do pls tell me im not alone i shouldnt have read it i shouldnt have read it i shouldnt have read it but i DIDNT and now its HERE and i cant make it leave



I found this book two nights ago at a thrift store just some weird old poetry book it wasnt even on the shelf just laying there on the floor like spmeone dropped it or left it or maybe they ran idk the cover was black no author no barcode just these weird gold letters that said All Things in the Corners of Eyes



It was thin like barely anything but when i picked it up it felt heavier than it should be like i was holding a brick and i should have just left it but i opened it and i read the first poem just standing there in the aisle and i swear to god the whole store tilted like i got hit with that feeling when u stand up too fast but worse my stomach flipped my head started buzzing my moyth tasted like metal



And then i was at the counter holding it and the white lady at the register just stared at me and i tried to hand her the book and she shook her head and said put it back



I laughed like wtf she was joking right



She wasnt joking

I TOOK IT HOME



The book seemed normal enough, mostly a bunch of poetry think Edgar Allan Poe type shit horror or gothic creepy stuff but normal. But after I read the next two poems after the first I started feeling sick like real sick.



That night was just weird feelings like when u turn the lights off and u feel like somethings there even tho its not and ur brain is like no ur fine but ur stomach is saying run. I managed to fall asleep but the next day, the nausea was even worse.

SECOND NIGHT IT GOT WORSE



I started seeing things but only when i wasnt looking. Like when i was watching a youtube vid i swear i saw something move in the corner of the screen but when i rewound it nothing my mirror started acting wrong my own reflection lagging like it was breathing before i did and my eyes didnâ€™t match up



And then i found the note



Tucked in the back of the book on a piece of old ripped paper the writing was messy all jagged like it was written fast but it was my handwriting



DONT READ ALOUD. DONT LOOK TOO LONG.



I DIDNT WRITE THAT



I swear to god i didnt write that. shit freaked me out so bad like there is no way I wrote that and didn't remember. So I tryed getting rid of it i'm not the religious type but this book reminded me of the box from The Possession.

I TRIED TO GET RID OF IT



i left it on the bus yesterday on my way home from school just sat it on the seat beside me and walked off and i thought i was fine i thought it was gone but when i got home



IT WAS AT MY APARTMENT DOOR



Open to the last page



It watches you now

It knows you read

It knows you see

And it is so so hungry



NOW MY APARTMENT SMELLS ROTTEN



I woke up this morning and my whole apartment stinks like something died but i checked everywhere trash is empty fridge is fine no dead rats i dont even know what the smell is but its thick and wet like its sticking to my skin and my clothes.



And then in my bathroom i saw them



WORMS



Crawling up from the drain tiny red ones wiggling on the floor and i swear to god one of them moved backwards like not crawling like sliding like something was pulling it back down. I Googled and turns out they're called Midge fly worms or something like that. 



i tried to squish them but when i did the smell got worse



My head hurts so bad like something is inside my skull squeezing twisting i feel like im gonna throw up every time i close my eyes i see movemenr like something is standing behind me but when i turn around nothing



pls tell me someone else has read or seen this book pls tell me someone else knows what to do pls tell me im not alone i shouldmt have read it i shouldnt have read it i shouldnt have resd it



pls tell me how to make it go away
