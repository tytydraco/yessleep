The woman had always known that her child was special. When she first held him in her arms, she felt a bond that she had never experienced before. But as he grew older, she realized that there was something different about him. He never smiled, never laughed, never even cried.

At first, she thought it was just a phase, but as the years went by, she realized that her child was not like other children. He was always distant, always detached. He never spoke, never looked her in the eye.

The woman tried everything to connect with her child. She took him to doctors, therapists, and specialists, but no one could help him. She spent hours every day trying to get him to smile, to laugh, to connect with her. But it was all for nothing.

One day, the woman could take it no more. She had reached her breaking point. She could no longer handle the constant rejection, the endless silence. She packed a bag and left in the middle of the night, never looking back.

Years went by, and the woman thought that she had left her past behind. But one night, the thing came crawling back into her life.

She had been sitting in her apartment, watching TV, when she heard a sound from the hallway. It sounded like something was crawling on the floor. She got up to investigate, but as soon as she opened the door, she saw the thing.

It was her child, but not as she remembered him. His skin was pale and clammy, and his eyes were empty and lifeless. He crawled towards her, weeping and moaning, calling out to her in a haunting voice.

"Mommy, where are you? Mommy, come out and play with me."

The woman screamed and ran back into her apartment, locking the door behind her. She could hear the thing crawling around outside, weeping and moaning, calling out to her.

Days turned into weeks, and the woman never left her apartment. She had barricaded the door, but the thing was always there, crawling around outside, calling out to her. She could hear it weeping and moaning, calling out to her in a haunting voice.

The woman had not slept in days, and her mind was starting to play tricks on her. She could hear voices whispering in her ear, telling her to let the thing in, to face her fears. She knew it was all in her head, but she could not shake the feeling that the thing was real.

Finally, the woman could take it no more. She decided to face her fears and confront the thing. She grabbed a small knife and opened the door.

The thing was waiting for her, its eyes glowing in the darkness. It crawled towards her, weeping and moaning, calling out to her. The woman lunged at it with the knife, but it was too fast.

The thing pounced on her, its long fingers wrapping around her neck. She gasped for air as it whispered in her ear, "Mommy, don't you love me?"

As the darkness consumed her, she realized the truth. The thing was her child, long dead and gone, but somehow, it had come back to life. It had crawled out of the grave and was now seeking revenge on the one who had abandoned it. The woman had nowhere left to hide, and the thing would never stop until it had exacted its revenge.
