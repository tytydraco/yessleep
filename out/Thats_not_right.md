I look at them. Really look at them. Close enough to see the 27 freckles on their face. Hm.

What happened?

They sleep calmly, as if I'm not there, but I know they saw me. I feel their breath on my face, and they inturn feel mine. I hear their heartbeat. I know they aren't asleep.

To be fair, they are good at hiding it. Opening their mouth occasionally, turning over lazily, and mumbling like they do every night.

They know I'm here. But they don't know that I know.

1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21.

I stop. That's not one they had before.

22. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27.

But at least they got the number right-

**28.**

I saw it. My breath caught. And my heart skipped a beat. Fuck. I was right.

This isn't my sweet love. This isn't my darling partner. An imposter of some kind. Probably here to hurt me or collect samples before they replace me, too.

Slowly, ever so quietly, I get off the bed. They shift, mumbling something about pastries that i can't fully comprehend. I see as that thing slowly curls up like they do. Whimpering quietly at my missing presence. 

I can't let that thing fool me. It's not them.

I walk to the kitchen, quickly grabbing a knife off the counter. I left it there when I was making dinner. They smiled so sweetly at me.

No. That's not them.

I'm shaking now, my breath hitching as I feel warm air on the back of my neck.

Calm down. It's not them.

Quickly, I turn around and slash at the presumed thing behind me. But the knife in my hand glides easily through the empty space.

Fuck. Did I take my meds? No. Focus. 

I have to save them. From wherever they are. From whatever that thing is. I have to save my sweet lover.

With silent footsteps, I make my way back to the bedroom. They are still curled up like I left them. All cute and oblivious.

No. It's not them.

My hands raise above my head, and I wait for a second.

What am I doing? Why do I want to hurt them? Am I losing it? How can I be sure that it's not them? 27 freckles. Or was it 28? Fuck. I can't remember.

I open my eyes.

"Sorry... I don't know what happened next... I... what happened to Rex...? Where are they?" I plead the physiologist, a tear rolling down my cheek as I try to understand why I'm being put through all of this. Handcuffs? Locked cell guarded by three  men, one bald with gray eyes, one brunet with blue eyes, and one with black hair and eyes greener than emeralds.

"Everything will be alright soon. Just... take it easy. Rex is just fine. They are just being talked to just like you are." The nice red-haired lady with a clipboard spoke, smiling before gesturing for the bowl sitting between us. Full of colorful candies that surely taste sweet.

I do so eagerly, taking one of the circular treats and popping it into my mouth. It was cold. Smooth. Weirdly didn't taste like much. Mentally, I shrugged, biting down on it hard.

***crack***

It was always satisfying to hear a hard candy crack between my teeth. But, it still didn't taste like much. So i kept chewing.

I only stopped when I saw the horrified look on the psychologists face. I opened my mouth to speak but felt something pool out instead of words. Blood spilled down my chin and into my lap.

I didn't know what to do, so I just spatt out the crushed pieces of the marble into a napkin and placed it on the  table.

After that, I was guided back to my room. By the tall, handsome, black haired man with blue eyes. Wait.

That's not them.

My heart sank. But I didn't say a word. If they knew that I knew, they would just up my dosage.

I didn't mean to kill Rex. I really didn't. I loved them more than i loved myself. But the thing is:

Something wasn't right.

***That wasn't them.***
