They came to my room and dragged me out of bed, strapped me to that blasted wheelchair, and whisked me straight to the East Wing.

“You’re 93 years old, you can’t expect to live forever,” the Doctor said, matter-of-factly. “Plus, you’re $200k in debt.”

"But I don’t feel 93!” I argued. I couldn’t remember much of anything, but I certainly didn’t feel like dying.

“You have a week to live, at best," he said calmly.

“Is that why you dragged me out of bed? Why you ruined perhaps my final nap?” I questioned.

“We schedule a death meeting for everyone,” he explained. Especially for people in your situation, who are in debt.

“If I’m going to die, what am I supposed to do about that?”

The Doctor grabbed a small hammer and something that looked to be a cross between a nail and a needle.

I squirmed as he walked towards me. He placed that needle-like thing on my temple, then hit it hard with the hammer.

I didn’t feel pain, but everything went black. My mind raced faster than it ever had, for what felt like an eternity. As if I was cramming for the biggest test of my life.

I woke up sprawled on the floor, my hands in front of my face. My hands that didn’t look very old at all. 35, at most.

“Strap didn’t hold!” the Doctor yelled. “Get her back up in the chair.”

Someone pulled me up.

“We put you under for an hour. How does it feel to mine cryptocurrency? This new computer chip and algorithm can only mine it using the electrical signals in human brains. You made us $2.80.”

“We can keep you alive indefinitely, but only your brain. You’ll mine enough to cover your debts, then maybe some more if you want to keep living.”

I stood up and punched hard over my shoulder, knocking someone out cold. Much stronger than 93. The Doctor yelled something about not enough drugs, but I was already running.

The hallways were too dirty to be a hospital. Most of the doors led to empty concrete rooms. I kept going.

Then I found the room full of brains. Six of them per container, soaking in a blueish-green solution. Each one connected to the same sort of needle-chip that had been hammered into my skull. Racks of brains, as far as I could see.

The Doctor was behind me. He cornered me, but I grabbed the nearest brain and threw it at him. Then I toppled one of the racks. I escaped as he tripped and fell under a pile of whatever monstrosity they had constructed.

I ran past a mirror. Drugs lie. Mirrors don’t. I was in my mid 30’s - not 93.

“We have a runner!” someone yelled.

And boy, was I running!

I made it outside for a moment. A sign read: “Institute for the Poor.”

Then it was dark and I was back in bed.

Or so I thought.
