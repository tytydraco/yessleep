It was like Amazon. For boyfriend's. 

According to his bio, *Cam* was a cat person. 

His favorite food was sushi, and he loved horror movies. 

His profile was cute. Cam‚Äôs photo looked professionally taken. He was a guy in his mid twenties with a slight curl in his lip that teased the start of a smile. Maybe a little on the pretentious side with the Sherlock style trench coat, though his eyes were what pulled me in. 

I don't think I had ever seen *that* shade of blue.

Like staring directly into a perfect, crystalline blue sky. 

Not quite natural, but too beautiful to ignore. 

Cam was perfect.

Now, I didn't really think this Hire-a-boyfriend thing through. 

I found the app through a link my friend Hannah sent me. 

After just getting out of a pretty toxic relationship, finding  someone to just hang out with was more comforting than dwelling on a relationship I have trouble even remembering. I don't think I can describe loving someone I don't remember. I have zero memories of him, only a vague sense that I was drowning. 

That I had to run, to get *away* from him. 

His face inside my mind is more of an outline, a shadow I can't make out. My therapist said it was PTSD, my mind‚Äôs way of dealing with trauma. I don't know the details, but I woke up in the emergency room with stitches in the back of my head. 

Hanna was straight forward in her text.

She told me Hire-a-Boyfriend pulled her out of depression.

I was sceptical, though the app looked legit. 

Like I said, it was Amazon. For boyfriend's.

The interface was cute. 

When I signed in through my apple account, the app required a questionnaire after registering. 

They asked details such as my likes, hobbies, and who and *what* I was in the mood for. 

The Boyfriend‚Ñ¢Ô∏è was a bestseller. 

I found Cam on the feature page. His reviews were sparkling. 

*I hired Cam for a wedding! He was amazing! So polite, I wish he was my real bf :(* - Lissa.

*‚ÄúWatched a movie with Cam, and he talked all the way through it. Not in a bad way lol, the movie was terrible. This guy was hot. I fully recommend‚Äù!* - Ryan. 

*‚ÄùHire a bf is amazing lmao, my friends actually thought we were dating. The plastic thing ruins it tho. üò≠‚Äù* - Mina.

Scrolling down, there were even Husbands‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. 

Husbands were more expensive, and could be hired for up to three days. 

The Boyfriend‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, however, was only available for 2 hours up to a full night. 

The app intrigued me. 

I thought it was a joke, but could I really *hire* a pretend boyfriend? 

Before I knew what was happening, I was on my second glass of wine, and my credit card was definitely in my hand, squeezed between my fingers. 

In the back of my mind, hiring a boyfriend was a whole other level of dystopia. 

However, I was still lying to college friends about being taken. Even worse, I blabbed I was fucking engaged at twenty three. This was definitely a *me* problem. My initial plan was to close down the app and install Tinder. 

But my credit card was feeling heavy in my hand, the corner spiking my palm. 

Cam was 50 bucks for half a day with him. 

50 bucks I would otherwise spend on Uber Eats or over-expensive makeup. 

Tapping on Cam, my hands were shaking. I was halfway through the hiring process that was settling on a day, a time, and a location, when a *discounted* Boyfriend‚Ñ¢Ô∏è popped up.

Roman. 

23.

**Leaving soon!!!** 

Roman had two reviews, which was just a string of heart emojis and another that was hidden. I did see the start of it, but I wouldn't let me tap *read more*.

*Hey! Isn't this‚Ä¶ [REVIEW HIDDEN]*

The guy‚Äôs lack of bio was slightly off-putting. No likes or hobbies, not even a favorite TV show. Roman‚Äôs photo stood out, however. Dark hair that was the perfect kind of messy, freckles, and a far-away look, half lidded eyes not even meeting the camera. 

He looked like a daydreamer. 

It made sense why this guy was on a discount. He didn't smile in one photo, and not even the teasing smirk I was used to with the others. His available photos were him standing awkwardly, arms crossed across his chest, as if he didn't know where to put them. 

But, like Cam, this Boyfriend was flawless. 

Not a hair out of place, and if it was, that was the style. 

Each guy had a color scheme, and his color was chestnut. 

His description caught my eye. 

*Perfect caramel coloured curls and eyes like melted chocolate. Roman is our favorite ‚ÄòFall‚Äô guy! An enemy to a lover in three (yes, three!) dates!*

I had to agree. This guy embodied Fall itself, every outfit in deep oranges and browns that reminded me of crisp autumnal mornings. I think they were trying to sell *college guy* with him holding a book, and looking uncomfortable wearing a pair of glasses. His last photo was a full zoom in, capturing flawless skin and tawny eyes swirling with flecks of red. 

Out of all of the guys I had scrolled through, this was the only guy who looked like he had personality. 

Cam was cute, yes. But Cam reminded me of a mannequin. He was *too* perfect. 

Roman‚Äôs perfection was human enough for him to feel real. Cam was a Ken doll wearing the exact same grin that people knew would sell. Roman was scowling, standing slightly tilted to the left, his hands in his pockets, and then squeezed into fists, before settling over his chest. 

I could practically hear the impatient voice behind the camera. 

*Why are you scowling? Smile! Do you know how to smile?!‚Äù*

‚ÄúEyes on the camera! Look awake! You're supposed to look appealing, why do you look half asleep?!‚Äù*

He made me wonder what the BTS behind Hire A Boyfriend was. 

Cam was marketed as true love, while Roman was the guy next door who drives you insane, but is also kind of hot.

Were these guys strapped for cash and selling themselves out? 

Was this all an act, or were they based on their real personalities? 

Either way, I was sold. 

Tapping *hire*, I chose our *date* to be in the city park at 3PM. 

The app asked me if I had any special preferences, and I hesitated. 

*‚ÄúCall me a donut.‚Äù* I typed. If this thing was legit, this poor guy has a script. 

I was nervous to meet him. After class in the afternoon, I headed to the park. It was raining, so already the date was going *great*. The receipt I received in my emails had the exact location, a green bench next to the water fountain. 

I was five minutes early, already regretting my spontaneous, wine induced decision making. 

Scrolling through my phone with clammy fingers, I was trying to cancel, when the bench wobbled next to me. 

Roman. 

Dressed in his usual autumnal wear, a levi‚Äôs jacket with jeans and a beanie, he looked exactly like his profile, already scowling at the ground, that exact same faraway look in his eyes. 

My Boyfriend‚Ñ¢Ô∏è was purposely distancing himself, sliding further away from me. After getting mildly offended, I remembered his standoff attitude and perma-scowl was his selling point.

The refusal to smile and inability to compliment me.

Enemy to a Lover. 

He was acting. 

‚ÄúHi.‚Äù His voice was a low mumble. Still refusing to look at me, he tipped his head back and blinked at the tree looming over us. ‚ÄúIt's, um, Jane, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù I cleared my throat. ‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

I watched his gaze wander, lingering on a butterfly. He folded his arms, pursing his lips. I had no idea what he was trying to say, before he let out a groan. 

‚ÄúI'm not calling you a fucking donut.‚Äù

Ooh, this guy was really getting into the role. 

I liked it, playing along.

‚ÄúIt's fine,‚Äù I said with a laugh, ‚ÄúIt was a stupid request.‚Äù

Roman met my eye, his lip curling. He wasn't laughing. ‚ÄúYeah. It was.‚Äù

This guy was a pro. 

I thought I'd made a mistake. Especially when my ‚Äòboyfriend‚Äô refused to walk by my side, stalking behind me instead. 

He took me to a restaurant and bought me the cheapest option, indulging in the delicacy menu himself, and spent an hour ranting about birds not being real. 

I started to realize *why* this guy was on discount. He was a fucking weirdo.

Still, though, everything about him was endearing. 

The way his gaze wandered when I was speaking, like I could physically see his mind jetting off to Saturn. 

Roman played with his hair a lot, twirling a single strand around his index. He ate his pasta like a psychopath, using a spoon instead of a fork, and spoke with his mouth full, spaghetti sauce running down his chin. 

He (unintentionally) made me laugh out loud multiple times. 

When we left the restaurant, Roman surprised me by slipping his hand in mine, entangling our fingers. 

His gesture was unexpectedly warm.

When we parted ways, he had the slightest curve of a smile hinting that he was getting a *little* closer to me. 

That‚Äôs how Hire a Boyfriend lured you in. 

Their guys were like video game characters. I had to pay more to build them. 

And that is what I did. 

My friend was an artist, and invited me and my ‚Äòboyfriend‚Äô to her exhibition. 

I hired Roman for the exhibition, but halfway through the date, he leaned his head on my shoulder, grasping tighter to my hand. He didn't get any *less* weirder, officially freaking out my friend with the *birds aren't real* theory. Eve was more amused than scared, immediately asking for his socials.

Roman said he didn't know what a *social* was, and she laughed harder. 

‚ÄúYour boyfriend is amazing,‚Äù Eve told me over drinks, ‚ÄúIsn't he like, literally perfect?‚Äù

Yes, he was. 

But he wasn't mine. 

I started hiring Roman every week, and the more I got to know him, I fell hard. 

Every week turned to every day. I was obsessed with unlocking his true character and personality. Each time I hired him, Roman would get less standoffish, his barriers coming down.

He started to lean into me, squeezing my hand, kissing my shoulder. 

Cash didn't matter to me, I was barely emotionally conscious when I was entering my card details. Just like the app said, Roman did get closer to me. 

Fast forward four months, and I was sitting on a park bench with his head sandwiched in my shoulder, cherry blossoms blooming above us. It felt real. 

*He* felt real.

I can't describe my feelings, because I don't even understand them. 

He was the first man I remember truly falling in love with. 

When he kissed me, I stopped seeing him as a Boyfriend‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. 

Roman was like no other guy I‚Äôd ever met. Before him, I couldn't remember having a clear mind. After him, everything made sense. My friends loved him, and I had slowly deluded myself into believing he was real. His true personality was friendly, a little clumsy but in an endearing way, and he made me laugh. The park was our place, and I enjoyed dozing in the sun with his face pressed into my shoulder.

There was just *one* problem. 

Roman was still a Boyfriend‚Ñ¢Ô∏è which meant he was off limits. The plastic tag sticking out of his right temple assured that. If that wasn't enough, the app sent me hourly reminders, warning me to not get too close. I did understand, it was for the guy‚Äôs privacy and safety. 

But it's not like Roman wasn't being affectionate himself. 

The app said zero touching, including kissing, sexual intercourse. He kissed me multiple times, his head correctly leaning into mine. I still wasn't sure if he was part of his obligation as a Boyfriend, but it was clear this guy was slowly steering away from the rules. 

I couldn't resist prodding the tag. ‚ÄúDoes this not bother you?‚Äù

Roman shrugged, pulling his legs to his chest. ‚ÄúNot really. I like the smell of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúSmell?‚Äù 

Rowan held out a hand with a small smile, catching cherry blossom on his palm. ‚ÄúYeah. Doesn't it smell good?‚Äù

*He was talking about the cherry blossom.*

Something about the way he immediately dismissed the tag put a sour taste in my mouth. 

‚ÄúNo, the thing sticking out of your head,‚Äù I said with a nervous laugh. 

Roman blinked, his lips breaking out into a smile. ‚ÄúI'm glad we both like it.‚Äù

Maybe he wasn't allowed to acknowledge the tag.

Ignoring my twisting gut, I focused on the sunset instead, blurred reds and oranges streaked across a twilight sky. 

It was slowly starting to sink in that Roman was not *mine*. 

‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù he said in a low murmur. 

Something warm dampened the sleeve of my shirt. 

Was he crying? 

For a moment, my words were tangled in my throat. 

‚ÄúI think I love you too.‚Äù I said, my cheeks heating up. 

‚ÄúMm.‚Äù he sighed, and I was trying to ignore how wet my sleeve was getting. ‚ÄúI told you I would come back,‚Äù he snuggled into my shoulder, and that *wetness* was dripping down the bare skin of my arm. When he nestled his face in my neck, I smelled it, a tangy, metallic scent tickling the back of my nose. 

Blood.

Twisting my head, my right sleeve was drenched with startling red. 

My neck felt sticky, blood smearing my shoulder blade. 

Roman was bleeding. I thought it was a nosebleed when I glimpsed his nose and lips and chin dripping red, but it was leaking from his ears too, rivulets of blood seeping from him, while the guy himself didn't move, still smiling, his head leaning on my shoulder. When my body remembered how to move, I jerked away with a shriek, but Roman stayed in the same position, his head tilted. 

‚ÄúI came back for you,‚Äù a wide smile spread across his lips, blood dribbling down his chin. ‚ÄúAnd our baby.‚Äù

I didn't respond, pulling out my phone to call an ambulance. 

‚ÄúAre you happy I came back?‚Äù he whispered. I was transfixed by the blood running down his face. His head jolted suddenly, his smile dampening, before curving into a frown. The man's eyes were suddenly so sad, wandering, like he was searching for something. 

Someone. 

‚ÄúI changed my m-mind,‚Äù Roman‚Äôs head jerked again, drool slipping down his chin. ‚ÄúI w-want to be a dad, Sara.‚Äù

Roman‚Äôs words jolted something inside me, a shiver slipping down my spine. 

I dropped my phone, using my sleeves to stop the bleeding. Grabbing his face, I forced him to look at me. ‚ÄúHey. Look at me.‚Äù The bleeding was letting up a little. But it was his eyes that held me in a trance. I fell in love with beautiful, almost unnatural brown. What I was seeing was green, a smear of lime slowly seeping into that tawny oblivion. 

‚ÄúRoman.‚Äù I said, louder. ‚ÄúWho is Sara?‚Äù

His expression crumpled, like he was crying, a whole new personality taking over. 

But he wasn't looking at me. 

Roman was looking right through me. 

‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù his voice broke, ‚ÄúBut I also love him. I'm not ready for a baby! I'm twenty three! What twenty three year old wants to settle down with a little brat?‚Äù His eyes widened, expression softening. ‚ÄúI didn't‚Ä¶I didn't mean that.‚Äù

I was talking to a memory. 

‚ÄúI love both of you. And I want to‚Ä¶ I want to make a family with *both* of you,‚Äù he shook his head. ‚ÄúBut not now, Sara.‚Äù

Sara.

There was that name again. 

‚ÄúSara.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúCan you tell me who that is?‚Äù

The man's gaze snapped to me. ‚ÄúSara,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúShe's my girl‚Ä¶‚Äù his head jerked again, this time violently.

‚ÄúGirl‚Ä¶ friend?‚Äù 

Roman frowned. ‚ÄúShe's my girlfriend,‚Äù he mumbled. ‚ÄúI was going to go‚Ä¶ back. But I‚Ä¶ I couldn't‚Ä¶ find her‚Ä¶‚Äù

His hands dropped limply to his sides. 

‚ÄúI looked for her. But they‚Ä¶ grabbed me.‚Äù

He squeezed his eyes shut. ‚ÄúThey took me‚Ä¶ away.‚Äù

When his whole body shuddered, eyes rolling back, I couldn't help myself, reaching forward with trembling hands and plucking the piece of plastic from his temple. It was like pulling a tag out of a toy. But it kept going, a long plastic thing feeding directly into his head. 

It was like pulling a tag out of a toy.

This thing was a long coil of wire stained red, a metallic plate attached to the end. 

Biting back a shriek, I dropped the tag, my fingers slick crimson.

This *thing* was embedded, fed, directly into this guy‚Äôs head. 

Like a switch had been pulled, Roman‚Äôs arms fell to his sides. ‚ÄúSara.‚Äù he said through a mouthful of red. ‚ÄúShe's my‚Ä¶ she's m-my‚Ä¶‚Äù he trailed off and blinked slowly. His gaze found my hand, where I was gingerly stroking his temple. Roman jumped up suddenly, his eyes frenzied, awake, like a startled animal. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù he shuffled away like I was contagious, diving to unsteady feet.

So, *this* was Roman. 

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù he swiped at his bloody chin. ‚ÄúWhere's Sara?‚Äù

When I couldn't reply, his fingers gingerly stroked at his right temple. 

‚ÄúFuck.‚Äù Roman let out a sharp breath. ‚ÄúYou actually got that thing out.‚Äù

I was shaking, still holding it between my fingers. 

This thing was warm, thrumming, like it was alive. 

‚ÄúAnd what *is* it?‚Äù I managed to get out. ‚ÄúThat thing was inside your head!‚Äù

Roman curled his lip, his gaze wandering the park. 

‚ÄúWhere's the exit?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù

He grabbed me, harshly this time, pulling me to my feet. I was still trying to mentally register the tag feeding into his brain. This guy was not the man I hired, violently pulling me to his side when I could barely stand. His eyes were fierce, hollow, a whole other person taking over him. He was the shadow that had been pushed down, a suppressed memory who was awake. 

And pissed. 

‚ÄúWe need to get out of here right fucking now,‚Äù he said in a hiss. His fingernails stabbing into my skin hurt, but the pain was enough to snap me into fruition. 

‚ÄúThat app.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

Roman‚Äôs eyes darkened. ‚ÄúIt's a factory,‚Äù he tightened his grip around my wrist. 

‚ÄúCan you help me find my girlfriend? I'll tell you everything, but we need‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúMiss Doe, am I correct?‚Äù

The sudden voice caught me off guard. 

Roman looked confused, his gaze flicking behind me. 

*Fuck*. His lips formed the word and he stumbled back, his hand slipping from mine. Behind us, an outline of a woman slowly bled into the shadows. 

‚ÄúYou.‚Äù Roman‚Äôs lips parted in a silent cry. He shook his head, clawing at his hair. The guy let out a spluttered sob, a thin line of blood escaping his nose. 

‚ÄúYou're the bitch who did this to me.‚Äù

The outline inclined her head. ‚ÄúI know you have the memory of a goldfish, dear boy, but if I remember correctly, you were recommended to us. I even have your consent if you require proof.‚Äù

His eyes were wide. Terrified. 

‚ÄúYou make us sign it! We don't have a fucking choice!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's a rule break. Boyfriend's do not swear, unless it part of a joke and has been given full content by our clients.‚Äù

The woman appeared, no longer a disembodied voice, basking in the shadow of the setting sun, rich red hair and matching heels. She was my age or a little older. Sculpted in a black suit, this woman was oozing sophistication. 

She turned to me with a bright smile. 

‚ÄúHello Jane! My name is Lily. I'm a customer adviser at Hire a Boyfriend. I am *so* sorry for the malfunction!‚Äù 

Tilting her head, Lily‚Äôs lips formed a frown. 

‚ÄúAs we explained in our terms and conditions, the Boyfriend‚Ñ¢Ô∏è does not usually act like this unless considered faulty. However, it is expected from a discounted model like Roman. He is scheduled to be refurbished in a week, so we'll happily take him off your hands.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Roman whimpered. His gaze flashed to me. ‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶ help me.‚Äù

His head jolted once again, and he dropped to his knees.

‚ÄúThat is also a rule break,‚Äù Lily said. ‚ÄúYou never directly tell clients what to do.‚Äù

Roman‚Äôs body shook, his head jerking left to right. 

‚ÄúGet away from me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are broken, Roman. Allow me to fix you.‚Äù

His eyes filled with tears. ‚ÄúBroken?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's right. Broken.‚Äù

‚ÄúSara.‚Äù Roman swiped blood from his nose. ‚ÄúIs she okay? Is she‚Ä¶ s-safe?‚Äù

The woman regarded him with a pitiful smile.

‚ÄúI'm sorry, who?‚Äù

Roman blinked. ‚ÄúSara.‚Äù his expression crumpled. ‚ÄúShe's my‚Ä¶she's m-m-my‚Äì‚Äù

Lily stepped towards him, and he shrunk back. 

The sound of her heels frightened him, like he was used to them. 

Used to her looming over him, a satisfied smile on her face.

‚ÄúShe's your *what*? Come on, speak up!‚Äù

He let out a raw cry, clawing at his hair. 

‚ÄúI don't know! I d-don't know! I‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúCome quietly, and I will rethink my decision to convert Sara‚Äôs child when once of age,‚Äù Lily said. ‚ÄúThe contract was clear. Section five, clause three. Hire a Boyfriend are automatically entitled to a Boyfriend‚Äôs offspring.‚Äù

Roman broke down, his head dropping into his lap.

‚ÄúI'll go w-with you.‚Äù somehow, his eyes were glitching, unnatural blue light igniting  around his iris. ‚ÄúI'll g-g-go.‚Äù

More blood, this time running thick down his face. 

Lily‚Äôs lips split into a grin. ‚ÄúI'm sorry Roman, who is Sara again?‚Äù

He scrunched up his face, fighting to keep his mind. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ d-d-don't know.‚Äù

I hated myself for turning away, after listening to him sobbing, begging for his unborn child to be safe, his mind torn from him right in front of me. I felt sick to my stomach. Lily was revelling in every second. Was *this* the reality of Hire a Boyfriend? What about Cam? 

Who was behind *his* original face? 

I should have done something. I stepped forward to grasp him and pull him back. When my hands were on his shoulders, the light fizzled from Roman‚Äôs eyes, sparks flickering out. 

Like a puppet, he flopped to the ground. 

In a panic, I tried to pull him to his feet, before I was violently shoved back. 

The redhead nodded to me. ‚ÄúI apologise again for the malfunction, Jane,‚Äù she told me, scooping him into her arms.

He looked so vulnerable, a fully grown man somehow reduced to a living toy. 

Lily bid me goodbye, promising me discount on my next Boyfriend‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. 

I thought about that day a lot. I went to the cops with a report, only for them to tell me Hire a Boyfriend did not exist.

Apparently, I had been watching too many movies. 

Two months passed by, and Roman never left my mind.

In an attempt to forget about him and delude myself into believing I was suffering a psychotic break, I lost myself in podcasts. Anything I could find, I listened to endless hours, blocking out thoughts drowning me. 

Yesterday, I was making my way back home from class when I walked into a dishevelled looking girl with an armful of missing posters. I already knew who she was, and who was on the poster. 

I was trying to avoid her, but this girl was following me. I could sense her steps getting closer, her breath on the back of my neck. Grief enveloped her in a sickly green aura, pale cheeks and straw-like hair stuck under her hooded sweatshirt. This time, the girl situated herself in front of me, red rimmed eyes begging me to stop walking. 

I did, coming to an abrupt stop, my gaze immediately flicking to a very familiar face on the missing poster. 

Unlike Roman, my Boyfriend‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, this man *did* have flaws.

Crooked teeth flashing a grin and an oddly shaped nose. He was stockier and had the worst fashion sense imaginable, clad in socks and sandles. This time, though, the boy had a different name. 

*Jun.*

The photo was always different, what I guessed was a collection from her Instagram. This one was particularly heart wrenching. Roman‚Äôs eyes were bright and happy, no sign of that hollow cavern I found myself lost inside. The two of them were standing in front of a mirror, his arms wrapped around her. 

Whatever happened to him after he was taken had stripped Jun away.

The girl shoved the poster in my face.

**HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?**

**JUN LOCKE.**

**24.**

**LAST SEEN WEARING A PLAID SHIRT AND JEANS, OUTSIDE CAMPUS.**

I didn't look at the face that had been perfected and moulded into the ideal boyfriend.

Into *Roman*. 

I stared at the girl‚Äôs bulging pregnant belly instead. 

Sara was getting bigger. 

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù She whispered, her voice a hoarse cry, one hand cradling her stomach. ‚ÄúHave you seen my boyfriend?‚Äù

It was always a *no*. 

Swallowing hard, I shook my head. 

Sara didn't even acknowledge my answer. She turned and walked away. 

‚ÄúWait.‚Äù her name tangled in my mouth. 

I felt like I was floating, my body moving for me. Stumbling after Sara, I lightly touched her arm and she twisted around, her eyes igniting with hope. 

Opening my mouth, I choked on my words. 

*I have seen your boyfriend.*

‚ÄúJane Doe! Oh my God, I haven't seen you in‚Ä¶ years, is it? How are you doing?‚Äù

Sara‚Äôs half lidded eyes flicked to a familiar face behind me. 

Lily. 

This time, the woman strutted in a stylish red dress. 

Her smile was too wide, too many teeth. 

‚ÄúJane, can we talk?‚Äù she asked, ‚ÄúWoman to woman.‚Äù

Lily nodded at Sara‚Äôs belly. ‚ÄúCongratulations!‚Äù she winked. ‚ÄúI hope it's a boy!‚Äù

I had no choice, letting her pull me away from Sara. 

Lily‚Äôs grasp on my arm was polite. She dragged me off campus. I thought she was going to throw me into a truck, before the redhead came to a stop. 

I tried to pull away, but her grip tightened. 

‚ÄúIt is quite painful, you know,‚Äù she said casually. 

When I frowned at her, the woman prodded at her own temple. ‚ÄúThe Neurowire is fed directly into the brain to ensure complete compliance with our Boyfriend's.‚Äù her gaze was across the road, and when I followed her eye, my heart almost jumped out of my throat.

Roman. 

They had cut his hair. He was a sandy blonde now. 

His colour scheme was deep blue, sporting a short sleeved shirt and jeans. 

He was laughing, hand in hand with another girl. 

‚ÄúI'm only going to say this once, Jane, because you are a *little* too curious.‚Äù

I watched Roman reach for the girl‚Äôs hand. They must have changed his personality. Now he was smiling and playful, the two of them laughing. But there was a shy side to him, his cheeks blossoming red, fingers slipping through her fingers and entangling them. 

‚ÄúThere are certain men in our society who are born to be Boyfriend's and Husbands.‚Äù Lily spoke up, and I realized she didn't just work for them. 

She *was* Hire a Boyfriend.

‚ÄúAt Hire a Boyfriend, we believe everyone should have a significant other they can be with. Even if it's for an hour or two every day.‚Äù she turned to Roman, who was wrapping his arms around the girl, laughing into her hair. 

The two of them seemed too close. I had a feeling this wasn't their first date. 

Lily followed my gaze, her eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúDo you really think a man like *that* belongs with someone like Sara? No, sweetie. As you can see, Roman is currently being hired by Lula, our richest client, a socialite who is considering buying him as a full time Husband! Now, she is perfect for him.‚Äù

The redhead turned to me, lightly brushing my hair out of my face, the tips of her fingers tiptoeing across my temple. She had a smile I couldn't make sense of. ‚ÄúI have missed you, Jane. If only dear Ben didn't get his own way.‚Äù

She tried to touch me again, and I smacked her hand away. 

I caught a hint of hurt in her eyes, before she sighed, grasping my chin with  manicured nails and forcing me to look directly at her. ‚ÄúSara is a woman who's boyfriend left her. She does not need any more stress for *our* baby.‚Äù 

Dropping her hand, Lily‚Äôs tone hardened. ‚ÄúIf you do *not* walk away and forget us, I will happily contract dear Sara into the Hire a *Girlfriend* program. And trust me, you of all people should know that it will be a *very* uncomfortable time for her. Would you like to know the conversion process? Well, allow me to explain‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúStop.‚Äù

My legs were close to giving way. 

‚ÄúI won't say anything.‚Äù

The bitch enjoyed my silence, my panicking thoughts trying to understand what she was saying. ‚ÄúOr we could make her a wife! There are a lot of lonely men looking for the perfect wife! Look at her. A young woman in her early twenties. Perfectly healthy and beautiful. And she's pregnant, so that's a bonus! Sara Mcintire is textbook girl next door. Exactly what we look for.‚Äù

Shaking my head, I was trembling, sweat trickling down my neck. 

Lily's nails dug into my skin. ‚ÄúAm I clear, Jane? Or do you want me to say it again?‚Äù her lips grazed my ear, a shiver skittering down my spine, bugs filling my mouth. ‚ÄúPain is beauty, after all, and we aim to create perfect Boyfriend's. I'll leave the process to your imagination.‚Äù

Stepping back, I nodded, swallowing a bout of vomit. 

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù she pivoted on her heel. ‚ÄúKeep walking and you will never see me again. Neither will pretty little Sara.‚Äù

Her voice followed me home.

*‚ÄúBy the way, it was nice to see you again! Say hello to your boyfriend for me, all right?‚Äù*

I don't *have* a boyfriend.

When I returned home, I felt like I was stepping inside a different apartment. 

Everything seemed just like how I left it but the house was too‚Ä¶ clean. 

Too empty. 

Standing in front of my bedroom mirror, I pulled out my ponytail, my fingers lightly prodding at my temple. 

What did she call me again? 

Jane Doe. 

Maybe I was seeing things, but I'm terrified.

There it was. 

How had I never seen it before? 

With shaky fingers, I prodded the tiny plastic tag sticking out of me. 

When I pulled it out of Roman, he knew who he was. 

Who Sara was, and his unborn child. 

Am/was I like Roman? 

Am *I* a Hire a *Girlfriend*? 

And if I pull this thing out, who *was* I before? 

Edit: I've found hundreds of blood stained and fresh tags in my bedroom drawer. Who is changing them? 

I live alone, but why does my apartment  feel so empty? 

Please help me. I think I'm going crazy.
