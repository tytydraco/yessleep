My name is Sam, and I think my roommate is dissecting things in his bedroom.

That’s a strange sentence to write. It sounds like the beginning of a joke, or something you’d say to a resident advisor to get a room change. But it’s not a joke, and I can’t tell anyone. If I was wrong, I could be in trouble for defamation. And if I was right… could he come after me?

His name is Julian. We were assigned to each other by the university’s housing algorithm, a process that apparently saw two aspiring doctors from different sides of the state and thought, “perfect.” For the first month, it seemed to be right. We got along. Not in a best-friends-for-life kind of way, but in the easy, functional manner of two people whose ambitions are perfectly aligned. Our lives were a shared rhythm of lectures, late-night study sessions fueled by cheap coffee, and the mutual, bone-deep terror of organic chemistry.

We were both in the same gross anatomy lab, Section B. That’s where I first noticed Julian was… different. The lab is a rite of passage, designed to weed out the weak, or so they say. But for our generation, raised with unrestricted internet access, the shock wears off fast. We’ve seen it all before, filtered through a screen. The first time they roll back the sheet on your cadaver, there’s a jolt, a smell, a sudden confrontation with mortality that no video can prepare you for. But you adapt. It becomes clinical. It becomes work. At least, until you see the first babies. The fetal specimens, floating in their jars of formalin, perfect and pale. That’s the thing that gets under your skin. That’s the thing that reminds you that this isn’t just a puzzle of flesh and bone.

Most of us coped with a kind of gallows humor, a clinical detachment that felt like a suit of armor. We gave our cadaver a nickname, “Manny,” and we spoke about him with a forced, professional respect that barely concealed our unease.

Julian needed no such armor. He approached our cadaver, a frail old man whose skin was the color of old parchment, with a focus that was less clinical and more… reverent. His movements were precise, economical, almost beautiful. While the rest of us fumbled with our scalpels, making ragged, uncertain cuts, Julian’s incisions were clean and perfect. He seemed to know the landscape of the human body before he’d even opened the textbook.

“He has an anomalous origin of the vertebral artery,” he’d murmured one afternoon, his voice a low hum of concentration. He was pointing to a vessel deep in the neck.

Our TA, a third-year med student named Chloe, came over. She peered into the cavity, her expression skeptical. “No, that’s standard. It’s branching from the subclavian, right where it should be.”

“Look closer,” Julian said, without looking up. “The root. It’s a millimeter too high. It’s a common variation, but it’s there.”

Chloe looked closer. She pulled out a probe and gently shifted the tissue. Her eyebrows shot up. “Huh. You’re right. We wouldn’t have even gotten to that for another two weeks. Have you been reading ahead?”

Julian just shrugged, a faint, almost imperceptible smile on his lips. “I like to be prepared.”

That was when the others started to notice. He was always prepared. He knew the name and function of every nerve, every muscle, every tiny, insignificant foramen in the skull. He didn’t just study the body; he seemed to understand it on an intuitive level, as if he were recalling something he already knew. His fascination wasn’t just academic. It was personal.

The weirdness at home started subtly. A new lock on his bedroom door. His habit of showering at odd hours, always after midnight. And then, the smell.

It was about three weeks ago. I came back from a late study group, the dorm hallway quiet and smelling of stale pizza and air freshener. As I got to our door, I noticed another scent underneath it all. A chemical sharpness that made the hairs on my arms stand up. Formaldehyde. I told myself I was imagining it, that I was just carrying the scent home from the lab on my own clothes, my own skin.

But the next night, it was there again. Stronger this time. And it was definitely coming from under Julian’s door. I knocked. The soft sound of movement inside stopped. I knocked again.

“Julian? You okay in there?”

A long pause. Then, his voice, muffled. “Fine, Sam. Just studying.”

The smell was gone by morning. But it came back a few nights later. And the night after that. It’s become a part of our apartment’s nocturnal atmosphere now. The low hum of the refrigerator, the distant sound of traffic, and the faint, sweet, sickening smell of a morgue seeping from my roommate’s locked room.

Last night, I heard a new sound. I was up late, cramming for a physiology exam, when I heard a noise from his room. It wasn’t loud. It was a soft, rhythmic scraping. A wet, precise sound, like a knife being carefully drawn through something dense and yielding.

I’m not going to the RA. What would I say? “My roommate studies too hard and our apartment smells like our anatomy lab”? They’d think I was crazy, or just trying to get a single room.

But I’m sitting here now, in the quiet of our living room, and the sun is starting to come up. Julian’s door is closed. The scraping has stopped. But the smell is still there, clinging to the air like a ghost. And I’m starting to think that whatever he’s preparing for, it has nothing to do with saving lives.
