It’s in there again. The bathroom. I can hear it right now. The rings moved. Or maybe the pipes. I don’t know. No, it was the rings. I swear it was the rings. I don’t want to look.

I keep telling myself the first time was the drain, but maybe it wasn’t. Shower wasn’t draining right, I bent down, there was just this clump of hair sitting there. Black. Thick. Not mine. I shave every two days, sometimes three if I forget. Never long enough for hair like that. I flushed it with toilet paper, thought nothing of it. Or maybe I did. Maybe I stared at it too long. I don’t even remember right.

Then the bedroom one. Maybe before, maybe after. I don’t know. I kicked it by the dresser, in the corner, and it made this noise. Wet, dragging. Like pulling a sponge across tile. I thought that was later, after I started leaving the lights on, but maybe not.

Sometimes it’s in the tub corner. Sometimes on the soap dish. Once it was on the sink ledge, curled up neat, like someone put it there. Always wet. Always dripping. Never dry. I hate it.

One morning I woke up with my tongue coated, like shampoo. Chemical taste in my mouth. I don’t even use scented shampoo. Just the cheap bottle from CVS, label half peeled off. My mouth tasted like chemicals. In the sink the hair was laid out. Not clumped. Spread out. Arranged. I swear arranged.

The smell. I didn’t notice at first. Now it’s everywhere. Like damp towels but sharp, metallic, like blood. Worst was the kitchen. I was making toast, fridge humming, then the smell drowned it out. I opened the freezer. Hair frozen into the ice tray cubes. I gagged. Almost puked in the sink.

Oh, the hot one. That was earlier, I think. I’d just turned off the shower. Steam everywhere. It was lying by my foot, dripping. I touched it and it was warm. Same as my skin. It hadn’t fallen. I didn’t see it drop. It was just there.

It’s always black. Except once. Blond. Brittle. Straw-like. That one scared me more than all the rest. I threw it outside in the trash. Later it was back in the tub. Same one. I knew it because of the split halfway down. I remembered it.

I checked under the sink once. Like an idiot. Pipes don’t even line up. I stood on a chair with a broom, poked at the vent. Only dust. After work one day I even went on the roof. It was raining, I almost slipped. Shin bruised for a week. Still faint yellow mark.

My skin itches. Wrist. Neck. Ankle. Sometimes I look and there’s nothing. Sometimes there’s a strand stuck to me.

The throat thing, I don’t even want to write this. Brushing my teeth, gagged, reached in. Hair. Slimy. Wet. Long. Sliding over my tongue. It kept coming.

I keep saying I should move. But what if it follows. What if it’s not the house. What if it’s me.

Last night, 2:40 a.m., I remember the red glow of the clock. I woke up choking, ran to the sink, spat out a wad. Heavy. Smelled like drain rot. It sat in the basin. I didn’t flush it. I just stared.

I tried ignoring it once. Told myself if I didn’t check, it wouldn’t be there. That night the couch cushion under me was damp. I lifted it. Hair mashed into the fabric, glued down with something sticky.

I was supposed to email my boss today. Eleven or twelve, I don’t remember. I didn’t. Whole apartment stinks. My hands are shaking.

The smell is strong again.

The rings just moved. I heard it.
