I don't remember much from my childhood, but I do remember my 9th birthday. It was the day my parents were killed, and I was left holding the murder weapon. I was confused, scared, and didn't understand what was happening. That's the earliest memory I have.

I've always known that there was something different about me. Sometimes, I would wake up and not remember what had happened the day before. Other times, I would feel like I was a completely different person. It wasn't until I was diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder that I started to understand what was going on.

I have two personalities, or alters, as they're called. There's me, the "normal" one, and then there's the "killer." The killer is a sociopath and a psychopath who enjoys killing and manipulation. When the killer takes over, I black out, and I can't remember anything that happened.

It's a terrifying feeling, knowing that there's this other part of me that's capable of such horrible things. But at the same time, I feel like I'm not fully in control of my own life. It's like I'm constantly fighting against this other part of me.

The worst part is that I don't know when the killer will take over. It could happen at any moment, and I wouldn't even know it. The people I've known, my relatives, my friends, my love. I try to keep myself busy, to distract myself from the fear and uncertainty that comes with living with DID. But it's always there, lurking in the back of my mind.

It was New Year's Eve, and I decided to go out and celebrate with my friends. We went to a party at a club, and I remember drinking a lot. The music was loud, the lights were flashing, and everyone was having a good time. But then something happened, and I don't remember what.

The next thing I knew, I was waking up in a hospital bed. The room was small, and the walls were painted a sickly shade of green. I was confused and disoriented, and it took me a few moments to realize that I was in an asylum.

I tried to remember what had happened, but my mind was foggy. I couldn't recall anything after the party. I asked the nurses and doctors what had happened, but they wouldn't tell me anything. They just kept saying that I needed to rest and that everything would be okay.

With each passing day, flashes of memory returned to haunt me. I remembered the rage boiling inside me, the bitter taste of alcohol on my tongue, the deafening noise of the club. And then a sudden darkness that swallowed me whole. I had no idea what horrors I had unleashed or who had fallen victim to my madness, but I knew that it was something terrible.

It was then that they told me about the "Personality Suppressor". They said that I had agreed to it, that I had wanted to get rid of the killer alter. But now I'm not so sure. What if the killer is still there, lurking beneath the surface, waiting to come out again?

I'm trapped here, in this asylum, with nothing but my thoughts and memories to keep me company. I don't know if I'll ever be able to leave, or if I even want to. All I know is that I'm scared, and I don't know what the future holds.

After what felt like an eternity, I had grown a beard, and the nurses and doctors who had been taking care of me had come and gone. They were replaced by new faces, but they all seemed to treat me the same way. Like I was a prisoner, trapped in this asylum with no hope of escape.

But then something strange happened. One day, I woke up to find that the door to my room was open. I couldn't believe it. Had they finally come to their senses and decided to let me go?

I cautiously stepped out of my room and looked around. The hallway was empty, but I could hear voices coming from down the hall. I slowly made my way towards the sound, my heart pounding in my chest.

As I got closer, I could see a nurse and a doctor standing outside of a room. They were talking quietly, but I could hear them saying something about a "Personality Suppressor."

My blood ran cold. Was this it? Was this the moment they had been preparing me for? I tried to back away, to retreat back to my room, but it was too late. They had seen me.

The nurse and doctor turned to face me, and I could see the syringe in the doctor's hand. I knew what was coming next, and I braced myself for the worst.

But then something strange happened. The nurse stepped forward and said, "Wait. We need to talk to you first."

I was confused, but I nodded. They led me into a small room and sat me down at a table. The nurse looked at me with a serious expression.

"We've been reviewing your case," she said. "And we've come to the conclusion that the Personality Suppressor might be the best option for you."

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. After all this time, after everything I had been through, they were finally going to let me go?

The nurse continued, "We think that with the right therapy and medication, you might be able to control your alters and live a normal life."

I was overwhelmed with emotion. It was like a weight had been lifted off of my shoulders. For the first time in a long time, I felt like there was hope.

The nurse and doctor approached me with the syringe, and I knew that this was it. This was the moment that would change everything. I closed my eyes and braced myself for the impact.

As the needle pierced my skin, I felt a surge of coldness coursing through my veins. My vision blurred and my mind grew dim. In that moment, I realized that they had not made a grave error.
