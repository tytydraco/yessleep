Hello everyone let me start my saying that i'm making this post to tell the story of my biggest inspiration and my hero which is my grandma the only family member that supported me through everything, this is her story and I will write it as i heard it from her mouth.

  When i was younger i used to tell my granny stories before going to bed, these stories could've been something i saw on TV or just made up stories but my favourite stories to tell her where horror stories, that being said one day my granny started telling a story of her own ,a story that terrified me so much that I just can't get it out of my head to this day and honestly I probably never will ,the story starts with her explaining that in her old town there is an "urban legend" as she put it that most people tried to avoid talking about it.

  This "urban legend" is about a very sick sick man called Mr Craftyhands, nobody knew who he really is or what he is because no ordinary person would be that disturbed 

Granny : " my dear Mr Craftyhands was an individual who would kidnap people strip them of their skin and make doll out of it and he would put them in front of their house for the other members of the family to see ,the reason why people started calling him Mr craftyhands was because the level of details on the dolls was...abnormal"

 I already started to feel scared my mind going wild trying to imagine how that would look like 

Granny : " He was particularly found of children, he wouldn't do anything, he would stare at them from a distance at any hours of the day"
Thinking back on it that has to be the creepiest thing I heard so far ,just a man standing in the shadows staring at children not blinking for god knows how long as she said it ,is terrifying 

Granny : " one time when i was enjoying my break with my classmates i saw him...I saw him standing on a hill waving something at us ,when we looked closer it seemed like he was waving someone's face "

  According to her the town folks tried to do everything they could to get rid of him ,they contacted the authorities ,they tried to take matters into their own hands but nothing worked ,nobody could identify him so nobody knew who he was ,granny said that it was like his face wasn't quite right ,nobody had the words to describe it when asked ,it was like there was a vail over his face to obscure it  

  When the police would get close to catch him he would just vanish 
  And so was the disturbing mystery of Mr craftyhands hands the man or thing that terrified my grandma town for decades 

  At the end of the story i was scared I could only tell her "geez grandma good one, you almost made me belive it huh" laughing nervously 
Granny shrugs and chuckles ,after she left my room i quickly went to open the doors between my room and hers as I often did when I was scared ,I know it seems silly but that's how I felt safer from the monsters that haunted my mind 

  The next morning still being a little scared from the story my granny told me but also very curious i asked her to tell me more about Mr crafty hands 

Granny : " oohhg..unmm...maybe we should let that story go its...umm..a story for grown-up people "
Me : " but granny I wanna know what happened ,is Mr craftyhands still there,in yout town"

Granny : " maybe...umm..I don't know 
I don't want to know "

At this point grandma started shaking
 
Granny : " look i shouldn't have told you that story i just got caught in the heat of the moment with all those scary stories you told me , I should've never mention it ,i apologies"

Me : "buuuut grannyyy"

Granny : " NO I WILL NEVER MENTION HIS NAME IN THIS HOUSE EVER AGAIN"

grandma rose from her chair and started shaking even more, at that moment i realised that this story is more serious then what it seemed i guess my young couldn't comprehend the gravity of the situation and thought of this story just as normal story told from a book but i was so wrong 

 Still being very curious and grandma not wanting to talk about it anymore I decided to take matters into my own hands ,I remember that granny used to keep some of her things in the attic and I wondered if she had something about Mr craftyhands in there ,I was right, I found her old journal were she wrote everything about Mr craftyhands, I will post another time about what it was written in that journal and the horrible events that scared my grandma and that town forever
