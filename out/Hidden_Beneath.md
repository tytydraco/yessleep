Hey Reddit, I have a story that still haunts me to this day.

A few years ago, I worked as a city maintenance worker. One of our jobs was to inspect and clean the underground storm drains. It wasn't glamorous, but it was necessary. One particularly rainy season, we received multiple reports of strange noises coming from a section of the drainage system that ran beneath an old part of town.

I was assigned to investigate with my coworker, Mike. We geared up and descended into the depths of the city. The further we went, the more oppressive the atmosphere became. The air was thick with humidity and the faint stench of decay. As we waded through the murky water, we began to hear itâ€”faint, echoing whispers.

At first, we thought it was just the water playing tricks on us. But the whispers grew louder and more distinct. It sounded like multiple voices, speaking in hushed tones. Mike and I exchanged uneasy glances but pressed on. We reached a section of the drain that hadn't been maintained in years. The walls were covered in strange, almost hieroglyphic-like markings.

Suddenly, Mike's flashlight flickered and went out. The whispers grew into a cacophony of desperate, pleading voices. I felt a cold draft brush past me, and I swore I saw shadows moving in the corners of my vision. We decided to turn back, but as we did, something grabbed Mike's ankle and yanked him under the water.

Panicking, I grabbed him and pulled with all my strength. Whatever had him let go, and we scrambled to our feet. We ran through the tunnels, the whispers chasing us, growing louder with every step. When we finally emerged into the daylight, we were both pale and shaking.

We reported the incident to our supervisor, who dismissed it as our imagination. But we knew what we had experienced was real. Mike never returned to the storm drains, and I was reassigned to another part of the city.

A few months later, I heard that a construction crew had unearthed a series of ancient tunnels beneath that part of the city. They found human remains and relics from a long-forgotten era. The site was sealed off, and the city issued a statement about preserving historical artifacts.

To this day, I avoid that part of town. I can't shake the feeling that something ancient and malevolent still lurks beneath the streets, whispering in the darkness, waiting for its next victim. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa a  a a a a a a a aa a a a a a a aa e feeling that something ancient and malevolent still lurks beneath the streets, whispering in the darkness, waiting for its next victim. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa a  a a a a a a a aa a a a a a a aae feeling that something ancient and malevolent still lurks beneath the streets, whispering in the darkness, waiting for its next victim. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa a  a a a a a a a aa a a a a a a aae feeling that something ancient and malevolent still lurks beneath the streets, whispering in the darkness, waiting for its next victim. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa a  a a a a a a a aa a a a a a a aae feeling that something ancient and malevolent still lurks beneath the streets, whispering in the darkness, waiting for its next victim. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa a  a a a a a a a aa a a a a a a aae feeling that something ancient and malevolent still lurks beneath the streets, whispering in the darkness, waiting for its next victim. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa a  a a a a a a a aa a a a a a a aa
