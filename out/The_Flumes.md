\-Part 1-

   Sometimes on weekend nights I like to reward myself through another dull week. This usually always consists of drinking, smoking, and cranking up my music as I sit inside my garage, which is equipped with a couch, table and television. My own little man cave. I needed this time away from civilization, to recharge the social batteries and prepare for the next weeks continuous cycle. 

Ive always felt like a loner my whole life; I never really needed many friends other than the ones from my childhood, Mark and Sammy, who I haven’t spoken to in years. I was ready to be alone. But this particular weekend would be a lot different from my norm, as I had just received news that my grandfather had passed away. “Hon, we can’t wait to see you again, of course under better circumstances would have been my wish..” My mom said over the phone. 

I hadn’t seen my folks for a few years, I finally broke free from them and never looked back. Nothing against them, they were wonderful parents. But the town I moved to as a kid held many dark secrets, things I never got answers on.  At least I could look my old friends up while I was down there. I always felt bad about leaving them behind, but I had to. 

I agreed with my mother over the phone and told her I’d see her in the next couple days. As I looked around my sanctuary, I grew ashamed that I didn’t want to leave it. It was Friday night, and I had to leave early in the morning to make it there by Sunday. A rain storm ensued as I closed up the garage to go pack my things. 

Some rather dark events took place when I was a kid, including my little sister going missing, never to be found. The story hosts many twists and turns, centered around strange tunnel systems connected to the caverns under the town of Lynsville. It all starts when I was 11 years old, when my family and I moved to this town for my dad’s job. Lynsville was in Illinois, and hosted a strange mixture of woods, creeks, and mountain like caverns. 

I was amazed at how much there was to explore here, and suddenly found myself excited for this new chapter of my life. It was the beginning of summer, and I had the next few months to explore my new surroundings before the school year started. As we pulled up to our new house I found my eyes glued to a lake behind it; this was amazing. It wasn’t until I saw the flyer posted on the power line next to the road that I got an uneasy feeling. 

The flyer advertised a missing boy, Davey Sullivan. He must have been around my little sister Grace’s age, maybe older. I also had an older brother, Tommy, who was three years older than me, and an asshole and a bully my whole life until the day Grace went missing. Us kids got to choose our rooms, which meant I got whatever room was left as Tommy carried me out of my first choice, but I didn’t mind, I just couldn’t wait to check out the giant lake. After picking our rooms, I helped Grace around the backyard, per my parents request, and was finally freed of my burden, able to explore my new home.

As the lake connected to most of the surrounding houses neighboring us, most nights consisted of everyone coming to their decks and having mass cookouts, parties, etc… It was our first night there that we met the entire neighborhood, and I met Mark and Sammy, two boys my age who’s parents both befriended mine. What first felt like a forced friendship soon bloomed into a ripe and blossoming one, as we soon became inseparable. 

They soon brought me to The Flumes, a spot they knew of hidden deep in the caverns, which also hosted a dark legend. The walk was brutal, but was well worth it when they showed me an entire city sized room deep into the Flumes, all with branching tunnel systems covered in graffiti. This place was awesome, but my new friends warned me not to go too deep into it, that that’s how kids wound up going missing. They then told me the legend of the Flumes, Mark being ever so serious and Sammy mocking him silently in a goofy face. 

“Alright man, so like, basically this land is haunted. There’s an evil that lives in the woods, and way way back the military discovered this, and created a base of operations to try to capture this entity.” Mark said ever so seriously, holding the flashlight up to his face, Sammy mocking him with jester like movements. “So the military soon catch on that the monster was feeding off of the towns folk, more specifically, their children. With no way to capture or kill it, they made a plan to bring all the towns people’s children down into their base, with a plan to lure the creature down there and to seal him away.” Mark concluded.

“And? dude you can’t stop there..” I responded. “Mark sucks at telling it, let me pick up where douche boy here dropped the ball.” Sammy quickly intercepted. “The military’s plan worked, they were able to seal the entity away, but it came at a cost. Every child who participated was locked in the base as well. This floored the parents who were ultimately killed by the military. New families were brought in, and the whole thing was swept under the rug.”

“Hey idiot, you forgot about the part where years later a logging crew discovered this base and opened it up. And now the legend stands; the Creature of the Flumes lives on, using the old military base as a home and feeding grounds for kids.” Mark said, finally concluding the legend. Sammy laughed as he and Mark started to air box, and I reflected on this tale I was just told. That very night when I returned home, I met the town mayor, who was all drunk and giggling with his wife as they talked to my parents. 

Mayor Taylor shook my hand, and seemed to take a keen interest in me. His wife seemed lethargic but smiled, eyes seeming to be looking at nothing and everything all at the same time. I also met the sheriff, Sheriff Dawn, who rushed out of the get together assumingely on a call, who also happened to be the uncle of Sammy. As I staggered through the mingling bodies to get to my home and eventually my room, I overheard someone talking about the missing boy, Davey Sullivan. I overheard it was the towns first missing child in 5 years, before that being about 10 children a year. One adult added that it seemed to finally be over.

Another group blamed it on the dangerous Flumes, and the stupid stories that would attract kids there. I eventually made it to my house, and prepared to crawl into bed when Grace entered my room, scared that she saw a man standing by her bed. Upon investigating, I didn’t find anything but let her sleep in my bed with me. Unbeknownst to me, this would be the last time I would be able to comfort her after a bad dream. Because that’s what I thought it was.. a bad dream. If only I knew. 

The next few weeks were really fun; Mark and Sammy introduced me to their school cliques, but I didn’t care for most of them too much. We would continue to hangout in the Flumes, drinking beers and smoking pot while attempting our try at graffiti. Another group came down as we were doing our thing, and it was my brother Tommy and his crew of ignorant followers he had quickly accumulated. 

“What’s up ladies?” Tommy shouted as he threw rocks at us, making his way down into the Flumes. Mark and Sammy didn’t talk, as Tommy made his way around them both. “Sammy, your uncle is the sheriff right?” He added. “Uh, yeah he is.” Sammy said, voice shaking. Tommy then began to laugh as he brought me into a headlock, rooting on that I knew how to pick friends. That’s when Mark pushed Tommy off me, and a large fight ensued amongst the groups, that is until we heard it. The scream from deep within the Flumes, past the parts we had journeyed to. I saw Tommy rise up, dropping Marks lapel grasp to turn to me. Without even thinking, I knew what he was about to say. That was Grace’s scream. Tommy took off into the Flumes, friends all waiting by us. Something in me told me to run home, to check on Grace. That couldn’t have been her, I thought.

As I raced home, Mark and Sammy followed closely until I reached the dock. Running up the steps, I slammed into someone I had no idea was even standing there, Sheriff Dawn. I pleaded with the sheriff to help me, and told him what we had heard at the Flumes. After letting me know that the area was off limits, he assured me he would send units. I raced up the rest of the stairs to see my parents, crying and speaking to another officer. I didn’t even have to ask, I knew what was happening. Grace was gone… Which would make her this years second kid gone missing in Lynsville. It was happening again.
