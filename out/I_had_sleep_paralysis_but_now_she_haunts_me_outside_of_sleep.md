That night provided no distinction between itself and a hundred others, and yet, to this very hour, it is the one that bewilders me the most. My earliest recollection of this night, already stained by the visions we call nightmares, and it had since occurred to me that these very visions were the root of what others, with a kind of pity, call my fascination of horror. They insist, of course, that the indulgence in the dreadful, had given rise to the dreams, but the truth, I think, is quite the reverse; as long before I had encountered a tale of horror, my nights were filled with them, vivid and entire, such that I touched, felt and suffered through them, as though they were the very texture of reality. What later passed for horror in plays and books was, to me, the language to articulate which I had already known.



The dreams, in their ceaseless recurrence, held less the quality of terror, but more so of desolation, for although fear was its shadow, it seemed loneliness - untamed, oppressing, intense - was its true substance. That particular vision, as I recall, arrived with the same melancholy in which the night itself had shrouded me in, and it was under that veil that I first became aware, of a voice. It was a man’s voice, deliberate, articulate, he seemed to say less than he knew, and as he threaded through my mind, my vision fractured into two planes of perspective, the dim, humid air of the dream, and flickering against it, a vision, like from a scene from an uncanny chronicle. There was a mother - a solitary mother - and a child, a little girl radiant with all the charm of innocence. The voice endowed their figures with a tenderness so complete that I might have mistaken it for love itself: the child, obedient, mirthful, inquisitive, and the mother, exalted in that devotion that which the little one had become, beyond dispute, the absolute center of her world.



The dream drew on, the voice continued, with brevity, calculation and a darkness such that I dared not name; and with it, my unease grew - cold, precise, insistent. I recall the little girl, her cheer, her inquisitions, the charm that drew me in despite myself. Her mother, all pride and delight in the radiant company of her child, their tender exchanges unfolding as though staged for me alone.



Yet beneath it all, a tension grew - thick, dreadful, unspoken. I remember the moment the child’s light faltered, her sweetness slipping away as suddenly as a candle snuffed. That charm that had secured my affection was gone, and with it, a silence fell. The mother, steadfast, and loving, showed no notice to the change. The voice observed this, too, with cold insistence.



And then, most dreadfully, I saw her - the mother herself. What had once been beauty, poise, the unmistakable grace of a woman well-kept, collapsed before me into something hollow, unwell. She had become, in an instant, the shell of her former self. Something was wrong - terribly wrong - and my disquiet thickened into a terror I could neither name nor escape.



The mother’s mind was, by then, most certainly gone. I saw it in the restless way she moved about her child, in her speech and gestures that carried no sense, only fragments. Yet what I beheld was never wholly clear to me - never certain. It was like watching a puzzle with pieces missing, though the pieces lay scattered before my very eyes, hidden only by some refusal of sight.

“She believed her daughter looked like this.” The little girl appeared again - familiar, radiant, almost celestial, like one of Raphael’s own angels. “But she really looked like this.” And with those words, the glow collapsed into shadow, into a depth without end - darkness, abyssal, and all-consuming.

I awoke in a dark room. The love of my life lay peacefully beside me, her breathing steady, untroubled. Yet the air around me was not my own. I felt a presence in that darkness, as though I had risen into company I had never invited.

My eyes fought their way back to focus, dragging open at a snail’s pace. The blackness thickened into a fog, swallowing the corners, softening the shapes, leaving me helpless to search it fully. My body, too, betrayed me. Still as stone, it would not obey the simplest command. I lay there, bound to the bed, listening to her quiet sleep while something else - unseen, unspoken - lingered close in the dark.

I recall at the border of my vision, the black veil of darkness slowly was undone, and hidden beneath laid a small figure, stiff like a mannequin. The black fog dissipated more and more, and revealed more of my unwelcomed guest - even as I recount the events, I can’t help but feel unsteady, for what she really looked like was truly horrid. I remember her skin which rippled and moved, as tho alive, her eyes vacant, but even so, felt horribly watchful and perceptive. 

The events of that night had gone on for longer than one night, and my interaction with this unwelcome guest, stirred something truly more haunting than any of the so-called ‘horrors’, it had stirred an unhealthy connection to a girl that had known nothing but love and devotion in life, and now sought it in even after. I was staring out my window, beyond the trees and the night’s darkness that shrouded them, I saw her once more, and with vacant eyes she had seen me as well.
