I hope someone can learn a lesson from this post. I do not think I have much time left, so i have to write this as a warning. My friends Jack, Kacey, Seth and I recently graduated school. It was summer vacation and before we all went our seperate ways, we wanted to try to have a final get together. The school we went to, Hell high, had been shut down a week after our graduation. We walked past the school everyday to go to our favorite meeting spot, a local diner. Every few days though, things appeared differently. On the 10th day of vacation, the school appeared boarded up, the 15th day there were police cars. On the 20th day, we snuck around to the back of the school. 



There was a horrifying screech, but there was audible words in between. "HELP ME!!!!!". The voice seemed feminine in nature, in fact, it sounded familiar. Thats when we remembered that one of our classmates, Susanna Rusty, had dissapeared shortly before graduation. But whenever the administration was asked, they just denied anything being wrong. "Her parents said she moved to a different state" or "She didnt dissapear, she relocated." Infact, she wasnt the first dissapearance. It happened so much that we eventually just believed the lies. But Susanna was a different story. I had a crush on her, hell, who didnt. She always wore a pink bow in her blonde hair, sparkling green eyes, and rosey pink cheeks. When she dissapeared, it drew more attention. Still though, not enough. Even the police just shrugged it off as a prank or something. We eventually believed that she truly did relocate. There was nothing else we could do. But those screams, It made me wish the lies were true. It was blood curdling. We ran to the diner and decided that we were going to break into the school as our final get together. 




We each assigned roles to each other based off of our strengths. I was the brains, due to graduating as one of the schools top students. Seth was the muscle, he was capable of liftong over 100 pounds, he was an allstar on the schools wrestling team. Kacey was our weaponist. He was skilled at archery and fencing. Hell, when it came to firearms especially, he was a perfect shot. Jack was our way into the building, and any locked areas. He had lock picking skills that could rival some of the best criminals. Best part, he never got caught. We headed out at 12 am on a thursday night. When we reached the school, we went in. No hesitation, no second thoughts or worries. Thats how us teens are. We think we are invincible. Until reality sets in. 




When we entered the school, we heard the screams again. But, there was growling mixed with the screams. The noises only got louder the closer we approached the basement. See, nobody, even when the school was open, was allowed in the basement except staff. We had no idea what to expect. Kacey led the way, Jack by his side. Jack unlocked the door at the bottom of the stairs to let us into the basement, and the screams stopped. The most rancid smell filled our nostrils. We continued into the basement, until we figured out why nobody ever entered. This wasnt a schools basement, this was a lab. This was when fear started to set in, what the hell is going on in this damn place? We continued onward, but it felt as if we were being followed. We entered a room filled with test chambers, some designed to inject via needles, some designed as gas chambers. In the cabinets, were test tubes filled with blood, gas, and the strange drug in the needle. The gas seemed to be some sort of anasthetic, that was our only guess. We then heard Kacey scream. Something completely out of character. We heard gunshots, a few curses, and then the growls of whatever we heard earlier. We realized that we had to escape. But then I saw susannas bow.



 I realized whats been going on. The missing students, they were being expiremented on. Thats what all of this was for. As saddened as I was by this revelation, I decided that we had to escape. With Kacey most likely dead, we had no weapons. Then we heard more growls. Not just from behind, but from the sides as well. We reached the beggining section of the lab. We decided to try to learn all we could. This experiment was called "Project: restoration". It was supposedly to turn those whom were expiremented on into mutated monsters. All of the missing students had files. I opened her file, only to drop it on the floor out of shock. Her beautiful green eyes, now red, buggy, and bloodshot. Her blonde hair, reduced to a few strands. Her skin, discolored. Half of her fucking face was missing. Jack and Seth walked over to me. We had to go now. No more damn distractions. That was until something jumped from a shelf. It slashed Jacks face. His final words were "GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!! WARN TH...". Warn the what? I am still unsure. 



Seth made a plan. I didnt like it. He told me to go to the school library, he would stay there and hold them off as long as possible. He said to get on one of the computers and post this story. If there was time left, escape. Just be sure to send. I hear the damned creatures clawing at thr blockaded library door. I will try to escape, but if I am unable to, please, all survivors of this wretched school, never return. Don't meddle where you don't belong. Stay safe.
