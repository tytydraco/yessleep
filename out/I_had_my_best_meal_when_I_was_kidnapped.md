I couldn’t even hear the words but the insistent yapping of his voice was starting to give me a headache. It wasn’t even his voice that annoyed but something about being lectured always ticked me off. I was tied to a chair and it seems I had no choice. Stupid bastard probably didn’t even kill me because he wanted to tell some stupid story. As I fully regained consciousness, he seemed excited to tell me all the ways he would kill me and how my suffering would be his triumph.  
 
The pale faced, rotten teeth killer was so happy with himself. He said some people paid him a whole lot of money to kill me. But he didn’t even care about that, he just wanted to make me suffer. It was in his blood he said; he would feed off my pain. I wouldn’t dignify him with a response, I mean for all that is lovely his house looked like shit. All the money from killing people and he couldn’t even get out of a shithole. But not to be rash this could have been his killing spot, even though I personally think this was his dwelling.
 
The pale face balding man with long but thinning hair elevated himself to a god by presiding over my death. It seems hygiene and proper manners didn’t matter if you are about to murder. But I think he was just a slob. He told me an intricate story about something or other, I didn’t really care, but it was time.
 
This inbreed psychopath came close to my ear to whisper something profound or dramatic, but then I took a bite out of his neck and boy was it delicious. He fell back and chocked his own neck to stop the bleeding. I watched him struggle to breath, and the absolute panic on his face. The terror in his eyes made me feel like this guy didn’t believe what he preached. I mean if death was his shtick, he certainly didn’t take dying all that well.
 
The clown fell to ground, bleeding out. He tried to make a few noises for perhaps the people upstairs, if there were any, but he quickly realized that only released more blood from arteries in his throat. I removed the ropes from my arms and legs and I sat on the floor watching him bleed out. The disbelief in his eyes of his ultimate demise gave me an idea.
 
Now, I am not one for inflicting unnecessary damage but when an opportunity for mischief presents itself, I just can’t help it. So, in the last few minutes of him dying I put my hand behind his head I brought to my chest. I felt some comfort in his eyes until I bit his chin off. I chewed the bones of his lower jaw and ate them until he was jawless and only his tongue stuck out, looking huge because the bottom of his face was missing.
 
It was the last minute before his death when his eyes looked at me in disbelief. Then I ate his left eye and part of his cheekbone. Then I ate his right eye and part of his brain. I was still feeling a little grumpy like I usually do when I am hungry so I hate his head, and upper part of his torso. I was never one for eating limbs, it seemed like empty calories to me and eating his heart filled me up.
 
I heard a few vehicles approach from a far and it made me super excited. I was no longer cranky because I had a warm meal so I was about to play with my new friends.
