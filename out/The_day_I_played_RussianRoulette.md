  

Russian roulette story

I am writing this from a coffee shop in Los Angeles. I changed my identity, my job, my house, the city where I live....everything. I just bought a plane ticket to Romania, where nobody will know me. 

It all started exactly 15 days ago, in my office. I was working for a big company that was producing robots. I was bored as hell because my life wasn't fun at all. I was making the same things again and again. I almost went crazy because of this routine. You know what the definition of dementia is... Making the same things every day expecting something different. 

"What am I doing with my life ?!", I asked myself. So I had this idea in my head like a bomb that affected my whole brain: "I want to have some fun." I searched for a few hours on the internet for what to do,when a notification just appeared on my computer. 

"Are you tired of doing the same things? If yes, come and just sign up to compete in a simple game of luck. The winner gets 20000 dollars."

Without thinking twice, I accessed the page and was redirected to a chat with an anonymous guy that turned out to be the creator of the game. He only wrote a message: " You're signed up".

I don't know how, because I didn't introduce any data and there wasn't any form to fill out.

I wasn't happy with my life. That day I realized that this was about to be my last day at the office. I went to my boss and said that I quit my job, so I started to scream at him. I did what every unhappy worker would love do.

But that night, before I went to bed, I received a message from the creator: "Come outside”. I looked out the window and there was a van. I only took my phone and my wallet. I was scared, but before I knew it, I was on the street, in front of the van. At that moment, a masked man went out of the vehichle and tranquilized me. 

When I woke up, I was inside a room with approximately 30 people. I started looking around, without knowing anything. I felt like an asteroid that just hitted Earth. The other people in the room were also confused and they were all having a headache. I think the serum contained something that made us feel like that. 

At that moment a voice started talking through the room's speaker: " Please arrange yourself in 3 columns. The creator is about to speak to you.”

After a few minutes, another masked man came inside the room with 3 soldiers that were fully equipped with guns. I think they both have 1 Glock gun, 1 AK-47, and 1 infantry knife. The manager didn't have any guns or knives. 

" Welcome to the Russian Roulette competition! In this game, you have to compete for 20000 dollars. Now, that you are here, I think you should prey for yourself. Only one of you will survive. I wish you the best of luck and now....let the game begin!

The adrenaline started flowing inside me. After the announcement, a few of the participants started crying hysterically. My first thought was: " I just ended my life..."

Another two soldiers came behind the 4 columns and we all walked on the corridor. The corridor was full of stairs and colorful doors.

I prayed for myself until we all got on the playing field. At that moment, some soldiers gave us a gun with a bullet inside it. The playing field was like outside, but it wasn't the real outside... The view was painted so well that you could barely make the difference between the reality outside and this room. On the „Playground” were some toys and some slides that ment ironically that we were just „playing”. A light bulb on the wall was red, indicating that you should start spinning the gun's barrel. We were obligated to spin it  until the light went green. 

We were all standing in a big circle. Every one of us where holding the gun to the head of the player that was standing in front of him. I was not feeling comfortable at all with a gun pointed at my brain. Every part of my brain was telling me to turn around and throw the gun from my head away. But...I didn't do that. Some guards were pointing AK-47s at us. 

My hand was shaking and I started to pray one more time. I started worrying about the fact that I would kill someone. Maybe you think why am I worrying about that, but when you are religious,you know that you are never going to be forgiven.

From the "playground's" speaker, I heard a voice...it was the creator of the game speaking:" This is the first round of the game. May god forgive your mistakes. Good luck!"

At that moment, the light bulb turned yellow, and that meant you had to fire the gun. I closed my eyes, trying not to cry. I fired the gun. When I opened my eyes, the man who was holding the gun to my head was laying now on the floor with his eyes large-opened, full of shock. His head was bleeding. Because of the shock, the man who killed the one behind me took the victim's gun, checked the chamber with the bullet, charged, and shot himself. From that day I tried to believe that suicide will prevent a much worse fate.

I looked around, and counted the dead players: 6 players died. It was very traumatizing to see the dead bodys standing on the floor and the blood that maked the scene look like a massacre. One of the players started shouting: „You are not huemans at all! Why are you doing this?!”. Then, one guard shook his head twoards the angry man. In that moment, two guards came and took the player in another chamber. He started screaming, but as fast as the moment begun, as fast the screams ended. 7 players died. In that night, I could not sleep at all. I wanted to escape from that hell even for one minute, even thought we were sleeping on the floor.

The next day, I realised that that was probably my last day on Earth. I started praying one more time. We all ate something that the manager wanted to give us: some vegetables and one slice of cheese. I missed my own breakfast: full english breakfast with a cup of hot coffee. But of course, if I had a family, I wasn’t able to tell you this story.

We were all on the same „playground” as yesterday. Now we are only 23 players left alive. We all took a gun and a bullet. After I charged my gun, I observed that my hand was shaking again. I pointed at the head of the player that was standing in front of me. In that moment, the player turned to me smiling and sayed:” I am glad I was your friend.”

“What was he talking about?” was my first thaught. But when I looked better at his face, I realised that he was my best friend from highschool. His name was Dany. He changed so much in the last 15 years…I didn’t have time to respond to him, because the light bulb turned red, so we all had to spin the gun’s barrel. Soon, the light bulb was yellow, so I closed my eyes and fired. I didn’t want to kill Dany… and I didn’t, and hopefully didn’t got killed as well. I looked around and other 5 players committed suicide with the guns of the dead players. There were another 5 players that were killed on the second round, so there were 10 dead bodies. At the end of the round there were only 13 players left alive. All of ower days were numbered. And even the one who is about to get out alive will die shortly. The stress, trauma and the anxiety will lead to depression or to cancer. After that round, Dany didn’t talk to me or to anybody else. I asked him what was the matter, and could hear from him was: “I killed somebody…”

The next day was about to be my last day out there. I remember that I had a dream in that night about me getting out of there. I don’t believe in dreams, but I don’t know what to say about this case…

A group of 9 players were standing in a circle talking secretly, holding their shoulders. I went to them and asked what they were doing, and one of them turned around and sayed:”Piss off!” The only two words I could hear were “freedom” and “revolution”.

In that morning, when the game begun, I wasn’t scared anymore because I was thinking I am going to die. Same routine every morning: go to the “playground”, take a gun and a bullet, charge, spin the barrel and fire. It started to be very boring. So I charged my gun, and when the light bulb turned yellow, I took my gun and fired. Before I realised, the man next to me falled on the ground. Before I knew, the body was laying in a puddle full of blood. I will never be forgiven for this sinn… After the 3rd round was over, the group of 9 people that was talking secretly started shouting:” We want to be free!”. Before they knew, they met the souls of the dead players. Dany wasn’t part of the group that committed suicide. Another 1 died because of my stupid goddamn gun! There were only 2 players alive: me and Dany.

A voice came from the “playground’s” speaker: it announced that we will play a final round in five minutes. Me and Dany looked at each other.

When the 5 minutes expired, we both took a gun, this time with 5 bullets. The same voice from the speaker explained the game. We are going to walk 3 steps in opposite directions. On the count of 3, we will turn as fast sa we could and shoot to the other player.

Dany came to my and sayed:”I need the money. It’s time for my to defeat you.” That wasn’t The Dany I remembered. In that moment, the fury started boiling in me.

We each walked 3 steps and we were waiting for the signal. My life was flashing through my life, but i knew I had to finish this once and for all. A sound came through the speaker. I knew that was the signal. I turned around and pointed the gun to his head. I fired but in the same thing jumped away, because he was trying to shoot me. He fired all his bullets, but I realised that I had only one. I couldn’t kill him. He was still my best friend from highschool. I threw the gun away, but in that moment, a guard pointed his AK-47 to his head and fired.

The next thing I remember is one of the guards holding a tranquilizer and congratulating me for winning 20000 dollars. In that day, I woke up home. My life was finally normal. The prize was sent to my bank-account. I went to Dany’s mother to tell her that he died. I also gave 10000 dollars to her as condolences. I almoast cryed when she asked me if I’ve seen Dany. She suffers from Alzheimer. When I told her that Dany passed on, she cryed. But…after a few minutes she forgot. I didn’t want to create more suffering so I left. From that day I swore that I will never touch a gun again. I think I will meet Dany once in hell. I have to finish writing this article because I have to go to the airport and because the coffee shop is about to close. I am uploading this because I didn’t want to talk about this to anybody.

I hope you will do what’s good for you, stay safe and don’t commit crimes!
