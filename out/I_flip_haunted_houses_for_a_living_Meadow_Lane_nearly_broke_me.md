Imagine the profession of house flipping. What do you picture? New countertops, polished floors, fresh coats of paint, right? Now imagine reoccurring claw marks gouged into the drywall, or the stench of rotting meat that lingers no matter how many times you scrub, rip up the boards, or bleach the place raw. That’s my job.

Usually, the process is manageable: dig out the cursed trinket, scrape away the occult graffiti, maybe salt the crawl space, and then slap some paint on it. There are some cases though, such as the one I’m about to talk about, where things can get out of hand. That’s what happened on Meadow Lane.

I’m writing this to mostly talk about my job to someone other than my partner, and this house finally gives me a reason to. If you’re considering 2963 Meadow Lane as a possible home, don’t call the realtor, you don’t want that house.

I knew something was off from the moment I walked in. Not the usual cold spots, feeling of being watched, or creaking wood—it felt like the house was separate from the street it was on.

When I shut the door behind me it was like I’d stepped out of the neighborhood and into something else entirely. The air was thicker and wetter—like breathing through a cold damp cloth. The silence was enough to drive you mad. Even the windows didn’t seem to look outside anymore. 

I should’ve walked back out right then, locked the door, handed the keys back, and taken the loss. But either greed—or maybe pride—kept me moving. That was my first mistake.

The living room should have been the selling point of the house—nice open space, beautiful leather furniture, hardwood floors, and a dignified skylight to really sell it. Except, the floorboards bowed inward near the middle, just enough to throw off your balance if you stood there too long, like the whole house was tilting toward some unseen center. The skylight didn’t help—the glass warped the sunlight into a sickly green that painted the furniture like it was rotting.

I noted everything down as I made my way through the room: possible foundational issues, water damage where the floor slanted, things that could be fixed. But hardwood doesn’t normally slant like it’s slowly melting into the crawlspace. When I was taking a closer look near the center of the slanted boards, I heard a child’s voice behind me. 

“Please, daddy, why won’t you let me play with him?” I froze for a second before spinning around as fast as I could. Nothing but sagging furniture and peeling wallpaper, a sad reminder of what was once a beautiful home. The air behind me felt disturbed though, like someone had kicked up dust from behind me.

I jotted down a possible draft issue knowing damn well the wind doesn’t whisper in children’s voices. Somewhere above me footsteps scurried across the floor. Too heavy for rats and too light for a person. I made a mental note of it and continued looking around the house.

There was a tall mantle that doubled as a fireplace sitting beside the archway to the kitchen. The arch was a darker oak color with scuffs and marks showing just how old it was. The mantle showed amazing woodwork, possibly an original stay of the house. A little polish and dusting and it would add thousands in value. 

That would be the case if the fireplace wasn’t a void of black. Not dark as shadowed but it’s as if the flames that were there burned so hot the soot imprinted itself along the interior. The longer I stared my vision stretched—like I was standing close to a long drop. A closer investigation of the arch as well showed that the grooves were in patterns of 5 at a time. They were deep cuts—the most damaging being close to 4 or 5 inches deep. 

While I was running my finger along one of the grooves a deep and thick scratching sound echoed from inside the chimney. Not enough to scare me but it was enough to make my hand recoil in surprise. I made one last note of it before exiting into the kitchen.

The kitchen was a showcase of rustic charm. Long pillars of wood reached horizontally across the ceiling, showcasing 2 identical chandeliers. Black cushioned barstools sat across from granite countertops with strong white cabinets. A large circular table was set up taking up the entire left side of the room.

The chandeliers sat stationary but the light flickered and flashed making shadows dance along the walls. The bulbs didn’t hum or buzz like old wiring, they pulsed. The barstools were sat neatly in a row but the metal stools had been chipped and warped as if heated and reshaped. Their legs were so warped 2 of them wrapped around each other while the other sat with a massive curve in its stature. The way the stools sat made them look like they had been braided together.

I ran my hand along the twisted metal, it was warm. The house seemed to do whatever it wanted, nothing made sense. As I stepped away from the stools the chandeliers flickered faster and harder—shadows shifting along the walls—almost as if reaching for me. It suddenly stopped all at once as the house shifted back into its docile state.

I’ve seen dozens of haunting flares up before—lights, doors, screams, but I’d never seen one stop on a dime like that before, like someone had flipped a switch. Spirits don’t get organized like that. It wasn’t natural. That’s when I realized Meadow Lane wasn’t housing spirits, it was the spirit.

I’ve always prided myself on being calm and collected when handling spirits. They can range from a sad little girl to hellspawn and it’s important to hold out until you know what you’re dealing with. In that moment though, I forgot everything I had learned in my years of experience, and ran as fast as I could. 

As I ran to the front door the house itself lost all sense of reality. I stumbled out of the kitchen as the archway groaned like creaking bone and the wood bent to try and capture me. My coat got caught in the closing arch, and as I took it off I failed to notice the stairs behind me that weren’t there before. The world pitched forward. My shoulder cracked against wood as I tumbled, the air escaped from my lungs as I fell along the stairs. I expected dirt, cobwebs, and the smell of mildew. Instead—light.

When I blinked the pain out of my eyes, I wasn’t in the basement at all. I was at the top of the staircase to the second floor. I struggled to find my footing and regain composure as all the alarms in my head sounded. For the first time in years I didn’t write anything down. What do you write down when the blueprints don’t make sense anymore? 

I ran down the stairs but every time I rounded the corner I ended where I started. I opened the bedroom door beside me only for it to lead outside of the house to a 2 story drop. Out of pure desperation I jumped through the window on my left. For a moment there’s sunlight, but when I hit the ground I opened my eyes to realize I was back in the living room. 

The room was fundamentally different though. The hardwood sagged like wet cardboard, the leather furniture bloated and spitting water like a fountain, and the skylight dripping light as murky as swamp water. I lost all composure as I started running around trying to break down doors, clawing at the walls, anything to get me out. 

That’s when I remembered I kept a lighter on me just in case I needed to use a smudge stick or incense. I took out the lighter and ripped some paper from my note book and kindled a flame. I set the ottoman on fire and the house reacted by lashing out. Everything creaked as the house tried to put out the flame any way it could. While the fire was still burning I made my escape out of the side door and never looked back. 

I don’t remember the run to my truck, but I remember finally being able to breath only after Meadow Lane was only a memory. I couldn’t shake the feeling that if it really wanted me I wouldn’t have been able to leave. I’ve worked for dozens of homes, cleared out cursed junk, and evicted countless spirits. But Meadow Lane wasn’t haunted. It was alive. And if you’re thinking of moving in, don’t. I couldn't fix it. I could only run. 

With all that being said, my name is Forrest. This is the first time I’ve shared my work with anyone besides my partner, but maybe it’s time I did. If you got any questions about what I do or how I do it, I’ll answer them as best I can. Hell, maybe I’ll even tell you a few more stories.
