A couple weeks ago, I got a text from an unknown number: “Your appointment is scheduled for 2:30 p.m., October 19th. Please arrive on time.” No name, no details, just that. I figured it was a wrong number or some spam bot and ignored it. I’m not the type to book random appointments—my life’s a mess of late rent and grocery runs, not schedules. But the next day, another text: “Reminder: 2:30 p.m., October 19th. Do not be late.” It came at 3 a.m., lighting up my phone on the nightstand. I blocked the number. It didn’t stop.

The texts kept coming, every day, from different numbers—burner phones, maybe, or spoofed lines. Always the same message, same time: 3 a.m. I’d wake up to my phone buzzing, that cold glow cutting through the dark, and my stomach would drop. I called my provider, but they said there was nothing they could do—numbers weren’t traceable, no pattern to pin down. I stopped sleeping right, started double-checking my locks, even though I live on the fourth floor of a shitty apartment building with a broken buzzer. Paranoia, sure, but it felt like someone was watching me screw up my own head.

October 19th feels almost like yesterday. The texts stopped that morning, and I thought it was over. I was exhausted, strung out on coffee and nerves, but relieved. Around noon, my boss called me into work—extra shift, cash I couldn’t say no to. I’m a line cook, and the kitchen was a blur of grease and yelling. I didn’t notice the time until I glanced at the clock while scrubbing a skillet: 2:28 p.m. My chest tightened. I told myself it was nothing, just a coincidence, but my hands wouldn’t stop shaking.

At 2:30 sharp, the power cut out. The kitchen went dark—lights, vents, everything. Dead silence, then the sound of something heavy hitting the floor in the back room. My coworker, Javier, swore and grabbed a flashlight from under the counter. I followed him, my sneakers sticking to the tile, heart thudding so hard I could feel it in my throat. The back room’s where we keep the walk-in fridge and extra stock—cramped, cold, no windows. The flashlight beam caught stacks of boxes, then the fridge door, cracked open. Javier muttered, “What the hell?” and stepped closer. That’s when I saw it.

Something was smeared across the door—thick, dark, like oil but redder, wetter. Blood, maybe, but it didn’t smell right—sharp, chemical, wrong. Javier reached for the handle, and I grabbed his arm, told him to wait. He shook me off, called me a pussy, and pulled it open. The fridge was empty. Not just no meat, no crates—empty like it’d been gutted, walls bare and gleaming, too clean. In the center, on the floor, was a folded piece of paper. My name was written on it in block letters.

Javier laughed, nervous, and said, “Someone’s fucking with you, man.” I didn’t touch it. I couldn’t. My legs felt like they were sinking into the floor, and every breath tasted sour. He picked it up, unfolded it, and his face changed—went slack, pale, like he’d forgotten how to blink. He dropped it and bolted, didn’t say a word, just ran. I should’ve left too, but I looked. It was a photo of me—taken from above, like a security camera shot, standing in my kitchen at home. I was holding a knife, staring at the counter, but I don’t remember it. I don’t own a knife like that—long, serrated, stained. Written across the bottom in the same block letters: “YOU WERE LATE.”

The power kicked back on then, and the fridge was normal again—stocked, cluttered, no blood, no paper. I stumbled out, told my boss I was sick, and left. Javier didn’t come back either; his phone’s off, and no one’s seen him. I got home, checked every corner, found nothing. But my kitchen counter had a fresh scratch, deep, like something sharp had dragged across it. I haven’t slept. I keep hearing footsteps above my apartment, slow and deliberate, even though I’m on the top floor. My phone buzzed at 3 a.m. again: “Rescheduled: April 6th, 2:30 p.m. Be on time.”

That’s today. It’s 1:45 p.m. now. I’m sitting here, typing this, because I don’t know what else to do. I can hear someone moving upstairs again, pacing, stopping right over my head. My hands are cold, and my stomach’s a knot. I don’t know what’s coming at 2:30, but I know I can’t run from it. If I don’t post again, check the news. Look for me. Please.
