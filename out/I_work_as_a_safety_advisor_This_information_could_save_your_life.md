I can’t feel comfortable continuing to hold this information in secret. My silence will only endanger more lives: lives that could have been saved had they received accurate safety information. 


Since 2017 I have been working for a governmental institution in the North of England. We carry out essential investigative work, focused on threat analysis and management in the local area. Usually this involves predicting natural phenomena in the near future that could pose a threat to life, and putting out warnings to local residents. Our proud record has saved dozens of lives from floods, landslides, storm gale winds, and abnormal periods of extreme heat.


This is rewarding work, but tends towards the repetitive.


Identify a threat – Produce an analysis – Warn the public.


Something changed last year. Starting in April 2022, we were ordered to investigate a mysterious thread of disappearances linked to a popular coastal resort town. Myself and five other investigators were each assigned a street to watch over and provide weekly reports on, notifying Head Office if anything suspicious arose. The command structure is frustrating, to say the least. The investigators are unknown to each other, and are strictly forbidden from sharing information among themselves. Every case file must remain private until it is handed to Head Office, where it is reviewed and sealed away. I feel no sense of reward. Not once have I ever heard back from Head Office with updates on my case files, and until now I had been working in the dark as to what the overall goal of our investigations was.


Assigned at XXXX street, it’s quiet enough work. My station is a small apartment overlooking the road. Not exactly the lap of luxury, but it has enough amenities to avoid getting bored during my long shifts – coffee, notebook, pen and table. The yellowing buzz from the shoddily-installed overhead lights gives me migranes, and I remain unpleased by the patches of mould infesting the ceiling, but at least the place has large windows opening out onto the misty street. The clean air is heaven.


XXXX street is a typical English country lane. Small stone walls, covered with dewy moss, line the rough gravel. I wouldn’t call this place rural, but perched on the edge of the town it certainly feels peaceful. In the pitch dark nights I can hear the owls, in the crisp autumn mornings the steady cooings of pigeons. 


There is something wrong. 


Sunday evening I handed in my latest report. As usual, it was an uneventful week. 


The only notable event occurs every Friday afternoon at exactly 14:28. A person, a different person each week, slowly makes their way down the street to the South. They invariably look uncomfortable, as if continuing onwards is a torturous ordeal. One shoe will be removed, and they’ll be dragging the exposed foot along the gravel, limping as they go. Sometimes the dragging motion leaves cuts and bruises on the sides of their feet. Always, they have a terrible blister on their exposed heel. The noise haunts me – scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape. They never stop walking. I have seen younger people crying from the pain.


This evening, after handing in my Case File, our Case Leader had to suddenly leave for a family emergency. In the hurry, she left her own files on the table. 


Fearing for my job, but frustrated by the opaque command structure and the tediousness of my work, I snatched them away. I apologise to my colleagues, who I may be endangering. This is classified information, and I can’t predict the consequences of making the information public. But I cannot, under any circumstances, allow the public to stay in danger. You need to know this information, for your own safety. I cannot allow anyone else to fall victim. 


Even now I wonder what will happen to me. What will they do to me?


I will begin transcribing the files’ contents.

Fuck. I see police sirens. They are after me.



“FINAL CONCLUSIONS: WEEK BEGINNING OCT 16TH 2023:


Continued success. Every Friday afternoon. Beginning on Z Street, follows the exact same route down to V Street. They become paranoid. They remove one shoe. Blisters appear. Investigators feel sick. As suspected. The Route appears magnetic. Invariably, at the end of V Street the subject falls to their knees. They curse The Route. They shout incomprehensible words of guilt. They are afraid of being discovered. They do not want to be found out.”


They’re shouting out for me. “Did you really think you could get away with this?”


I have to run I can only leave you with my only thought I am consumed by guilt I want to retrace The Route.
