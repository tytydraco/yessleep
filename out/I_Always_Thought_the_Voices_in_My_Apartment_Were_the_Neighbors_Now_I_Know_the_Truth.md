I moved into my apartment two years ago. It’s a small one-bedroom on the third floor of an old building creaky floors, weird plumbing, the works. Nothing unusual for a cheap rental in a big city. But the one thing that always stood out were the voices. At first, I assumed it was just the neighbours. The walls are thin, and I’d often hear muffled conversations sometimes laughter, sometimes arguments — usually between midnight and 3 a.m. I never thought much of it. People live strange hours in the city. But a few months ago, I noticed something weird. The voice always said the same thing. 

Not word-for-word, but close. A man’s voice, deep and rasping, like someone who smoked two packs a day. Sometimes I’d catch a full sentence:

Once I heard it whisper, clear as day:

That night I turned on every light in my apartment and didn’t sleep until the sun came up.

I asked my neighbors if they ever heard anything. Most of them said no, though one lady down the hall — Mrs. Kessler, probably in her 80s — gave me a long look and said, “This floor's been talking since before I moved in. Best not to listen.” That night I turned on every light in my apartment and didn’t sleep until the sun came up.

I laughed awkwardly. She didn’t.

I tried recording the sounds at night. I used my phone, set it on the kitchen counter, and left it running. I did this for three nights. The first two recordings were full of static and the usual city noise. The third one chilled me to the bone. 

About two hours in, there's a long silence. Then—faint, but unmistakable—a voice, right next to the mic.

I swear on everything, I was asleep in my bed the whole night. No one else was in the apartment. I locked the door. I even slid a chair in front of it, like some horror movie cliché.

After that, things got... worse.

Shadows started to move differently. I’d see them out of the corner of my eye, always just behind me. My cat, Luna, started refusing to enter the kitchen at night. She’d sit at the doorway, ears flat, growling low in her throat. 

Then, three nights ago, I woke up at 3:11 a.m.

Not from a noise, not from a dream — I just *woke up*. Wide-eyed, heart racing, like my body knew something before I did. The apartment was dead silent. Even the city outside was quiet. No cars, no sirens. Just... nothing.

Then I heard it again.

Not from the walls this time.

From under the bed.

A whisper, dry and rasping:
