The air off Lake Erie always felt different at night – heavier, somehow, carrying secrets on the damp breeze. Our vacation cabin usually felt like a refuge, cozy despite the peeling paint. But that night, the woodsy scent couldn’t cover the sour tension hanging in the air. Dinner had been a disaster. Another stupid fight about... I don't even remember what. Grades? Friends? Whatever it was, it ended with me yelling something regrettable and storming off to my room, the slam of my door echoing my frustration.

Later, cocooned in my teenage angst and the glow of my phone, I heard it. Retching sounds, violent and guttural, coming from the hallway bathroom. Mom. I hesitated, the leftover anger warring with concern. Finally, I crept to the door and knocked softly. "Mom? You okay?"
Silence stretched, punctuated only by the distant lapping of lake water against the shore. Then, her voice, flat and devoid of any inflection, slid under the door. "I'm fine, honey." A pause. "I'm feeling much better now."

Something about the monotone, the utter lack of her usual warmth, sent a prickle down my spine. I retreated back to my room, unsettled, pushing the feeling away as exhaustion finally claimed me.
I woke to a sound that didn't belong. A dull thump… thump… thump, rhythmic and insistent, coming from down the hall. It wasn’t frantic, more methodical. Heavy. My heart hammered against my ribs. Slowly, quietly, I eased my bedroom door open just a crack.

The hallway light was off, but the moonlight filtering through the living room window cast long, eerie shadows. I saw her. Mom. She was standing in front of my little sister Lily’s door, slamming her forehead against the solid wood. Thump… thump… thump.
"Mom?" My voice was a trembling whisper, barely audible.

She stopped. Slowly, agonizingly, her head began to turn towards me. But it didn't stop at her shoulder. It kept going. A sickening crackle, like snapping twigs amplified in the dead quiet, echoed as her neck twisted impossibly far. One hundred and eighty degrees. Her eyes, wide and vacant in the dim light, stared directly at me from above her backward-facing shoulders.

Then, her arms shot backward, elbows bending the wrong way, fingers splayed like talons reaching for me. And she started moving, running backwards down the hall, her bare feet slapping against the wooden floor with horrifying speed.

I slammed my door shut, fumbling with the lock I rarely used. The thump-thump-thump started again, this time against my door, harder now, splintering the frame. It was violent, enraged.

Then, abruptly, it stopped. Silence again, thick and suffocating.
"Honey?" Her voice, sickeningly sweet now, but still utterly flat, seeped through the wood. "Let me in. I'm sorry if I scared you." A pause. "I'm feeling much better now."
I squeezed my eyes shut, pressing myself against the wall, trying not to breathe.
"Open the door, sweetie," the voice cooed, devoid of any real emotion. When I didn't answer, didn't make a sound, the violent slamming resumed, shaking the entire door in its frame. But the voice didn't change, it kept up its calm, monotone requests even as the wood groaned under the assault. "Please, honey? I just want to talk."
Suddenly, a piercing scream cut through the night. Lily. Down the hall.

Instinct took over. Fear for my sister momentarily eclipsed my own terror. I wrenched the door open. The thing that was my mother stumbled slightly at the sudden lack of resistance. Without thinking, I shoved hard. It tumbled backward, limbs flailing unnaturally, down the short flight of stairs leading to the living room. I didn't wait to see it land.
I sprinted to Lily's room, throwing open her door. "Lily!"
The room was dark, save for the moonlight striping the floor. In the center, a figure was crouched low, its back to me. "Dad?"
The figure jerked, standing up in a way that wasn't quite human – jerky, unnatural, like a puppet whose strings were tangled. It turned.

It wasn't just Dad. His face... it looked like it was melting, نصف his familiar features contorted and stretched, while the other half seemed to be... Lily's face, pulled taut, eyes wide with an agony I couldn't comprehend. They were merging, becoming one grotesque entity. Its mouth stretched open, wider than any human mouth should, and instead of a scream, thick, viscous black tentacles writhed out, accompanied by a high-pitched, electronic screech that drilled into my skull.

I didn't scream. I just ran.

Down the hall, past the twisted heap at the bottom of the stairs that was no longer my mother, ignoring the scrabbling sounds it made. Out the front door, into the cool, damp night air. I ran into the woods behind the cabin, branches tearing at my pajamas, bare feet stinging on rocks and roots. I didn't look back. I just ran, fueled by pure, primal terror, until the blackness began to bleed into the grey of dawn.
I collapsed somewhere near the highway. That’s where the police found me, shivering, incoherent.

They took me back to the cabin. It was empty. Clean. No sign of struggle, no broken doors, no Dad-Lily-thing. Nothing. Except... a trail of something dark and sticky leading from the back porch down to the edge of Lake Erie, disappearing into the water.
Mom, Dad, Lily. Officially listed as missing. Drowned, perhaps? That’s what the reports suggested. But the looks the officers gave each other, the way they avoided my eyes… they knew something was wrong. They just didn't know what. Or maybe they did, and didn't want to say. Lake Erie holds its secrets well.

They sent me away, of course. Who would believe such a story? Psych ward to psych ward, therapist after therapist. They tried to explain it away. Trauma. Hallucinations. A psychotic break brought on by family stress. For years, I almost believed them.
But I know what I saw. I know what happened in that cabin by the lake. And I'm telling you now. Because... well.

I'm feeling much better now.
