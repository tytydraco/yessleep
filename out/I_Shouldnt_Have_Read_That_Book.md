Hi. I’m from the Philippines, and this happened to me when I was in elementary school.

Back then, my friends and I were obsessed with this book series—True Philippine Ghost Stories. Each of us had a couple of volumes, and we'd trade them around. “Read fast so we can all exchange right away,” my classmate Dena would say, excitedly clutching hers like it was treasure. We’d swap stories during recess and whisper them under our desks.

One evening, before dinner, my mom glanced at me and said, “You’re just scaring yourself.” I didn’t listen. I was halfway through a new volume when I came across a story that felt... different. I can’t remember the exact title, but I remember that page. It mentioned a curse. If you read the story, the Spanish lady would visit you. At 3 AM.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. I kept staring at the wall, heart pounding, waiting for something—anything—to happen. It felt like someone was watching me. I shook my little brother awake and begged him to sleep beside me. He grumbled but moved over. His presence gave me just enough courage to close my eyes.

The next day, something strange happened.

When I got home, I found out that my mom had rearranged the bedrooms. She moved our beds to the old stockroom—the one on the second floor with the balcony. That balcony faced a house, and across from it was the cemetery. I froze when I realized where we’d be sleeping. The washing machine was out there, our water tank, and the clothesline. No roof, just grilled bars and open sky.

I didn’t tell her why it scared me. I couldn’t. I had told them I wasn’t afraid—that I was brave. That was how I convinced my dad to keep buying the books.

That night, the fear returned. I woke up again, 3 AM, drenched in sweat. The air was heavy, pressing down on me like wet blankets. I felt it—eyes on me. I tried to wake my brother, but he wouldn’t budge. I whispered prayers and pulled the blanket over my head, trembling until the sun came up.

It became a routine. Every night, like clockwork, I woke up at 3 AM. Always sweating. Always watched.

Weeks passed, and I couldn’t take it anymore. I begged my mom to move our beds back. I told her it was too hot in the room, hoping she'd accept that excuse. She didn’t. So I endured. Every creak, every gust of wind made my skin crawl. I never saw her, but I felt her. Like she was always one breath away.

Eventually, Mom moved us back to the original room. I stopped reading those books. I thought it would end there.

But that’s when the sleep paralysis started.

The first time, I woke up unable to move. My chest was tight. My eyes darted around the room. At the foot of my bed, something stood there—a dark figure, unmoving, formless, but undeniably present. I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t breathe. It was like drowning in silence.

It still happens sometimes.

Always at 3 AM.

And she's always there.
