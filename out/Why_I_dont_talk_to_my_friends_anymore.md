To start, my friends Keith, Jason, Alex (names changed for privacy) and I had all been friends since the seventh grade. We were constantly at each others houses or our doing something. At the time this happened we were all out of school, a couple of us in college, and we had a summer break. We’re from rural Arkansas so naturally a good time for us is Hunting, Fishing, or driving out loud trucks around. This night was no different. 


We all had made plans to hang out on a Friday night, we all were off work or didn’t have anything going on and we hadn’t seen each other in a while. Keith mentioned inviting Liam, his little sister boyfriend. He was only younger than us by a couple years and he was a good kid for the most part, he just came from a rough home. We tried to get him out of the house and away from his family, if you can even call them that. If I’m being honest I found him rather annoying but he was a high schooler and I was always trying to act more mature than I really was. 


We all agreed to meet up at the local grocery store parking lot, with our guns to go coyote hunting. We were all super thrilled at the idea since we just got permission to hunt on a local ranchers land and we knew for sure that we were going to see something. A couple of us even bought brand new thermal sights for the occasion. Everything was set for a good night but we still had a few hours to kill before night so we decided to drive around and just be nuisances to anyone unfortunate enough to cross our paths. We drove around playing music loud and yelling like we just got released from the insane asylum. Then we decided to check out the haunted church. I believe there’s a post about in on here somewhere, but In all honesty the only thing haunted is all the used needles, pipes, or beer cans that people throw in there. We really just wanted to scare Liam. 


“So you know why this place was closed right?” I said to Liam with an evil grin.
“Not really, I mean we all know it’s haunted but like we don’t know why.” He said behind worried eyes. I knew the fear was already set, we didn’t have to say another word and he would’ve pissed himself, but we naturally had to keep going. 
“I heard the preacher that went here did some terrible things, like real nasty shit.” Jason said, holding back his laugh as best as he could.
“Nah don’t listen to them, nothings scary about this place…” Alex paused. “Except if you think a murder suicide is scary.” It was awful to make jokes about but we were dumb kids. We all broke out laughing and told Liam to go inside and we’ll wait outside with our guns to cover him. Little did poor little Liam know, Keith was already around the other side about to beat on the old ragged wall. 

“FUCK YOU GUYS, I KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP!” Liam screamed running outside. 
“Ha! We got you good! You bout pissed yourself didn’t ya?!” Alex was on the verge of tears from all the laughing.
“Hey who the fuck is that over there?” I asked, noticing that we had been doing all this and there was a man out in the cemetery mourning over a grave. 
“Oh shit I feel so bad, how did we not notice him?”
“I didn’t see him when I pulled up, how did he even get there?”
Jason and I questioned each other, we both drove out trucks but neither one of us seemed to notice him when we arrived. There was something off about this, everything down to my core just felt wrong. We had been going to this old church since I could walk and I’ve never felt this weird. 
“Let’s just load up and go, it’s gonna be dark soon.” Alex says, throwing his rifle into the back seat of my truck. 
“Yeah let’s just get out and get away from evil Willy Wonka over there!” I said in a less serious tone. Although he did kind of look like Johnny Depp’s rendition of the character. As we left, the man turned towards us and waved. Something wasn’t right about him, his movements weren’t human, more animatronic. 


We drove off and went back into town to wipe out the local truck stop’s deli, after all scaring a poor 17 year old kid makes you really hungry. 
“Hey so I’m thinking about buying a new AR” Alex says to Keith
“Damn dude, what’s that like your 5th one?”
“Fuck off, you’re just jealous that I actually have money!”
“Do y’all not care about that guy at Shiloh?”
I turned toward both and asked. I’ve never felt so weirded out, and trust me I’ve met some freaky people before. 
“Dude was probably just in a bad state, clearly someone he knew died.” 
“Yeah but they haven’t buried someone out there in at least three years.” Alex says. We continue to argue about the encounter until Jason and Liam come back with their food. 
“So I already know that I’m killing the first coyote!” Jason says, interrupting the awkward silence of our previous conversation. 
“Nah I’m for sure getting me one, I bought this scope just for it.” Alex replied. I looked over to Liam 
“Tough luck for us, huh?” I shot a smile to him, we were the only ones that didn’t have a way of seeing in the dark. 
“Maybe we’ll get luck and one will have a heart-attack next to us.” Liam and I laughed, it was probably the only chance we actually had. 


Once we got to our new hunting spot we settled in and got quiet, as quiet and as patient as a group of teenagers could be. After four hours of playing a call and watching rabbits and skunks run through the field, we got a little tired and bored. We couldn’t keep it up, even with all the RedBull money could buy. That’s when someone, I can’t remember who, saw something. A single coyote, not uncommon, wandering around the field, but something wasn’t right, like the man at the church, its movement was off. It moved almost as if someone was controlling it like a video game. We readied our guns when all of a sudden the bright night sky got dark, pitch black. That’s when we seen him again. I don’t know how or why, but it was unmistakable. I felt a heavy sense of dread and discomfort as he stood in the field. I grabbed Keith’s rifle with the night vision and looked at him. Despite the low quality green I could it was him, the weird stovepipe hat was a dead giveaway too. We were so shaken to out core that none of us noticed that the noisy southern night had quit too, not a single bug or crunch of the leaves. We just watched as the man stood there. 


Finally after what felt like hours, Jason spoke up.
“I don’t care what the fuck you guys say but I’m getting the ever-loving fuck out of here.” 
“I don’t know dude, it feels wrong, I don’t want to move, he might see us or something.”
“What do you even mean, he KNOWS we’re here, he’s known this whole time.”
“Wait do you think that it was him who we heard in the woods earlier?”
“WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR? LETS GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!” I finally whispered, trying to get us to agree to Jason’s pleas.
“One of you keep a sight on him, safety off incase he does something.” Keith said rushing Liam to my truck. I’d never seen him this protective.
“What are you even saying dude, you wanna shoot someone?!?” Alex huffed, almost out of breath.
“Look if he moves closer just call out and ask what the fuck is up, this isn’t his land, and we have permission to be here, he’s trespassing!” I said to Alex in a hurry, almost not even stopping to breathe.


Then we all heard words that I don’t ever want to hear again.
“Uh guys, he’s gone.” Alex mumbled “I uh, I d-don’t even know what happened” He sounded defeated, not scared or terrified, just defeated. I turned around to see him again. Not Alex. That man. If Alex wasn’t sitting down, then in my confusion and terror I would’ve started shooting, which in hindsight was good that I didn’t. He had a hand on Alex’s shoulder. Whispering something to him, something none of us heard, or would ever know. The rest of that night was a blur but I know that we left and got back to my house, we didn’t even want the beers we managed to get, a thrill we were all waiting for. 


None of us talked about it, Alex didn’t talk at all after that. At least not to us. I don’t know what that man said but it had a real impact since Alex decided to take his own life after that. Once all that unfolded his family fell to shambles and we realized what his father had been doing to them the whole time. I think that Alex may have been depressed, but hid it well. I don’t even know if it’s related to what happened that night, but I feel like it is. 


All of us equally blame each other for what happened to Alex, I could never look any of them in the eyes again, especially not knowing we left him to cover us while we ran away. 


I did get a message from Jason a few weeks ago,  he is a group text with a long ass paragraph that I didn’t care much to read. Something about how we need to meet soon. I didn’t have enough alcohol or fucks to give to make me really want to open that wound again, however the little I did read said this.


“I seen him again. He’s real. Please help me find him, I need to do this for Alex.”
