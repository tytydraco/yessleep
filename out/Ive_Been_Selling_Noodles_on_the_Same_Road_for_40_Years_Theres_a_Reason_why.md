Hello everyone, my name is Uncle Sommai. I'm 57 years old and work as a vendor living in Chonburi, Pattaya city, in the \[REDACTED\] area.

When people hear the name "Pattaya," they probably think of prostitutes. But I want to tell you - the sea in Pattaya is more beautiful than any prostitute. *Sorry, bad joke.*

Alright, let me get to the point. I sell delicious boat noodles. I don't charge much, just 40 baht per bowl. People around here spread word of mouth that my cooking skills are like they came straight from a five-star hotel. *Of course they are.*

But every time I see someone about to take that shortcut road, I have to hand them the rules paper. Every single time. For their own safety.

The most recent case was this young man driving a white sedan. He circled around the fishermen's area and when he came down, he looked quite hungry. He asked me for directions - seemed like he was going to a resort to countdown with friends. Typical teenager stuff. But this one, I gave him an extra warning. Because when he came down to eat my noodles, I had a premonition that he was going to encounter something terrible.

*But maybe I was just overthinking it.*

Now, many of you might be wondering - where are these rules? Well, I'll read them to you.

*Thank you for reading. Good luck.*

By now, many of you are probably thinking: Why do I have to write such a crazy rules paper?

Well, let me take you back to the past.

Back then, I was still in Korat with my older sister, my father, and my mother. Living the life of a farmer's child. In the morning, we'd plant rice, plow the fields, and raise buffalo. In the evening, I'd go play with friends.

*It was the happiest time of my life.*

My older sister was like me. Her name was May. She was a beautiful woman - smelled like roses, had a jawline so sharp it could cut paper, fair-yellowish skin. She was kind-hearted and polite.

But when she reached 17, she changed.

She got a boyfriend - this young man. And this guy had friends who were drug dealers and junkies. I warned her. Back then, I saw my sister sitting under a tree in the rice field, smiling absentmindedly by herself.

*What the hell is wrong with her?*

"Sister, listen - I'm not trying to bash your boyfriend, but... I think you should tell him to stop hanging around friends like that," I said.

"THEN WHAT THE FUCK BUSINESS IS IT OF YOURS?" She shouted at me. My face went pale because she had never spoken harshly to me. My face began turning red with anger.

"Listen, sis. Ever since you started dating him, you stopped going to school. Every day you just go out with your boyfriend. I'm asking seriously - when you grow up, you'll..." I didn't finish speaking before a cold hand struck my cheek hard.

My whole face went numb. I felt both angry and hurt. I didn't say anything and just walked away furiously.

As days passed, she looked worse. Her glowing skin became pale. Dark circles under her eyes. She started rambling strange things. I remember one time I secretly listened to what she was saying, but what she said confused me:

**"Eat. Drink. Eat. Drink. Eat. Drink. Die. Die. Die. Born. Born. Born. 'Red candy.'"**

She was sleep-talking while herding cows. Well, if you call standing with your hand in the air looking for cows "herding."

I immediately told my father and mother about this. At that time, they were eating som tam (papaya salad) deliciously on the wooden floor of the house.

You see, our house was made of wood and raised up on stilts so that underneath there was space for raising chickens, cooking, bathing, and other things. And upstairs was one big room that combined the dining room, living room, and bedroom all together. My parents were eating there.

"Dad! Mom!" I came up to the house, breathlessly exhausted.

"Oh, Sommai, what's wrong with you? Running with that face like you've seen a ghost," my father asked jokingly.

"It's about sister - her condition is really bad. She's rambling about stuff I don't know. I think we should take her to a doctor."

My father frowned. "Wait, did you see your sister eating raw things?"

"It's not what you think, Dad. I mean... she's not a **Pob**, Dad!"

I answered that because I didn't want to see my sister get whipped with a long cane by a shaman. And in case anyone's wondering, **Pob** is a ghost in Thai belief. It's like a parasite - it slowly enters the victim's body without them knowing, and sometimes the victim will sleepwalk to eat raw things. If it successfully possesses the body, it pretends to be that person, like a doppelganger. At night, it goes out hunting for raw meat. Sometimes they kill children to eat. But the scary thing is - it can spread to others.

Back to the story.

"I think she might be doing drugs with her boyfriend because he sells them," I said.

My father and mother were shocked. Their faces visibly paled. My mother was about to speak but—

**BANG.**

The door shattered and my sister came in, looking pale as death. Her eyes were blood red. Her right hand was behind her back.

"WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT ME?" she asked, but it didn't look like her at all. It looked... *demonic.*

"ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE P'TLE AWAY FROM ME?" She stomped her foot, making the wooden floor boom loudly. P'Tle was her boyfriend's name.

"Listen, daughter, we—" My father couldn't finish his sentence before my sister lunged at him, wrapped around his body, raised her right hand up, and what she was holding—

*It was a knife.*

She stabbed into his throat. Again. And again. And again. Until there was nothing but a pool of blood all around. When she was satisfied, she used the knife to gouge out his eyeballs and cut out his tongue. She played with them for a bit.

Then she turned to me with a vindictive smile and lunged at me.

But in that moment, my mother leaped out to intercept. The knife blade plunged into the center of her heart.

I knew immediately I had to run. And before I ran, I saw my mother's eyes. They told me to run. And they told me to forgive my sister.

I ran out. I don't remember how long I ran. I ran until I reached the city and reported it to the police. Soon the police arrived at the scene. They didn't find my sister.

I remember I cried very hard that day. And I was confused about why my sister had to do that. What drug did my sister take?

Not long after, my sister was found dead - hanging by her neck from a large tree on a certain gravel road. The police arrived at the scene and scanned her body. There was a large amount of drugs in her system.

*And she was pregnant.*

Time passed. Eight years later. I didn't continue my education, but luckily, there was a kind aunt - she's passed away now - but when she was still alive, she taught me the skills of making noodles. So I've been selling noodles ever since.

One day, I received a letter. I opened it and the message read:

*June 5, 1970*

*Dear Sommai,*

*This is Tle. I have something I need your help with. Right now I'm on the gravel road near \[CENSORED\]. I'm begging you - something is chasing me and the road keeps looping. If you come help me, I'll tell you the whole truth about your sister.*

*Please.*

*—Tle*

*That bastard.*

I remember he never showed his face when my sister died. When my parents died. Some people said she went insane because she was pregnant but he wouldn't accept the child as his, though I don't know if that's true.

*But I was going to find out.*

I rode my orange motorcycle onto the gravel road. There were no street lights installed at all along the road, even though it's actually the government's responsibility to install them. But they installed nothing.

*Probably just embezzled the budget.*

I noticed a car parked abandoned. Inside was that bastard. He looked terrified.

"What's wrong with you?" I asked while shutting off the engine and approaching him.

"May... May... she became a preta and now she's going to kill me," he said.

"You have to help—" He didn't finish speaking before his car was yanked upward. And I saw my sister in her preta form.

She pulled him out, grabbed his head, and—

**SQUEEZED.**

His head exploded. His body fell down and hit the ground.

And she lunged at me.

"SISTER!"

"SISTER, STOP!"

I shouted, but she didn't care. It was like she had no consciousness.

"SISTER, IT'S ME, SOMMAI!" I said.

She froze.

"Little brother?" she spoke through a mouth as small as a needle's eye.

I felt the world around me start to crumble. And everything went dark.

I woke up in a wide rice field. Everything looked bright and fresh. I found my sister. She turned to me. From the look in her eyes, I knew immediately it was definitely my sister. No malice. No coldness. Just love and kindness.

"Sister" I called out, tears beginning to flow.

"Little brother Sommai," she replied, tears welling in her eyes.

"Why did you kill Dad and Mom?" I asked, my voice shaking uncontrollably.

"It was Tle... my boyfriend. He made me try a certain drug. He said it was a new drug. On the outside, it looked like red candy. I refused, but he forced me to eat it. And I wasn't the same after eating it. I felt more aggressive. Or sometimes I felt reality... crumbling. And I'm sorry for killing Dad and Mom. At that time, the red candy was controlling me. And the karma I received is having to be born as a preta."

She spoke through tears.

"And Tle - will he get anything? Will he become a preta like you?" I asked with a hint of anger.

"He abandoned me when he found out I was pregnant. Plus, he was still doing drugs. He will be born in a terrible realm."

"And is there any way to free you from being a preta?" I asked.

"There is, but... I need to receive forgiveness from Dad and Mom first. And even if I receive it, I'll still have to atone for my karma in hell," she said sadly.

Suddenly, two figures appeared. Dad and Mom.

"We already forgive you, daughter," Mother said.

"Yes, even though you made mistakes, you're still our child," Father added.

My sister cried, and I cried too. I got to see Dad and Mom and family again. We hugged each other for the last time.

Before parting, my sister gave me a paper and said:

**"Even though I'm no longer a preta there, there are still many other pretas, including the new preta - Tle. So please give this to everyone who will use that road."**

It was the rules. The same ones you read.

Then the three of them walked away. And before leaving, Father said:

"We're always waiting for you. And when you die, if you have a wife, bring her too. And if your children die, bring your children too. Dad wants to hold his grandchildren." Father spoke jokingly.

I smiled. "See you then."

And this is why I have to give the rules paper for others to read. Even though my sister has gone to a better realm, that place is still haunted - a place where many people choose to end their lives.

And I don't want to see people who travel that road have to experience a horrifying fate.

Now, I have to go. My noodles are sold out, but I need to go home to be with my kids and wife.

See you all.

And hey - if you want delicious noodles, **come order from me only!**

I saw the same fear in his eyes that I saw in Tle's. I hope he made it through safely.\]*
