I’ve been going to the same barbershop every two weeks for years. Same chair. Same time. Same barber.

It’s not loyalty. It’s routine. The kind you stop thinking about.

That’s probably why I didn’t leave when something felt off.

The bell rang when I stepped inside, but no one looked up. No music. No clippers. Just the low hum of the fluorescent lights. The shop was open, but it felt paused. Too quiet for a Tuesday afternoon.

“Tom?” I called.

A man stepped out from the back.

He wore the same apron Tom always did. Same calm posture. Same practiced smile.

But he wasn’t Tom.

“You’re right on time,” he said.

“I usually wait for Tom,” I replied. “I can come back.”

He shook his head gently, already pulling a cape from the hook.  
“No need. He won’t mind. Sit.”

It wasn’t rude. That was the problem. There was no reason to argue without sounding unreasonable.

So I sat.

The cape went around my neck, tighter than usual. He adjusted it, apologized, adjusted it again. His fingers brushed my skin longer than necessary.

“You take good care of your hair,” he said. “People don’t realize how important it is.”

The scissors started. Familiar sound. Familiar motion.

Then he said, “Routine makes people comfortable.”

I caught his eyes in the mirror. He wasn’t watching my hair. He was watching my face.

“Comfort makes them stay,” he added.

I laughed weakly.

He asked questions while he worked. Where I lived. Whether I lived alone. If anyone expected me home. They were framed like small talk, but he never waited for full answers. He already seemed to know them.

When he stepped away toward the back, the silence swallowed the room. I stood halfway, considering leaving.

Then he returned and rested his hands on my shoulders, firm but gentle.

“Almost done,” he said.

The television mounted in the corner flickered to life.

A local news segment. The sound was low, but I recognized the words *escaped patient*.

The anchor’s voice tightened as she read.

“Authorities are still searching for a male psychiatric patient who escaped transport earlier today. The individual is considered dangerous. He is described as middle-aged, bald, and last seen wearing stolen clothing.”

Bald.

I watched the barber in the mirror.

His hair was thick. Dark. Neatly combed. Not a single patch missing.

Still, something about it felt… off. It didn’t move naturally when he turned his head. When he smiled, the hairline stayed rigid. Too perfect.

I noticed a dark speck near his collar. Then another on the edge of the sink.

Blood.

The scissors slipped. He nicked my ear.

It stung. Warm blood ran down my neck.

“Oh,” he said calmly. “That won’t do.”

I reached up instinctively. He caught my wrist.

“Careful,” he said. “You’ll ruin the cut.”

I tried to stand.

His hand pressed my shoulder down, harder this time.

“The door’s locked,” he said. “Safety policy.”

Panic hit fast and hot. I shoved the chair back, knocking it sideways. He stumbled, and the hair shifted.

Just slightly.

Enough for me to see skin underneath that didn’t match.

I ran for the back room.

The smell hit me first. Sweet and metallic.

Tom was there.

What was left of him.

His body sat slumped against the wall, head ruined, skin missing. Hooks lined the walls beside him. Scalps hung there — brushed, dried, arranged like wigs.

I gagged.

Footsteps behind me.

When I turned, the barber was standing in the doorway.

He was wearing a different scalp now. Lighter hair. Older. His posture had changed. His smile was gone.

“You shouldn’t be back here,” he said. His voice was different too. Lower. Colder.

He stepped toward me, holding a straight razor.

“I was saving that one,” he muttered. “But you moved too much.”

I grabbed a pair of scissors from the counter and slashed blindly. The blade caught his cheek. He screamed — not in pain, but in anger.

I ran.

I burst through the emergency exit and didn’t stop until I collapsed on the pavement behind the building.

The police came. The shop was sealed.

They never found him.

They say the man escaped again.

I still feel the cape around my neck sometimes.

I cut my own hair now.

It’s uneven.

But it’s mine.
