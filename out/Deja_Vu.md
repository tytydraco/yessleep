I've never been able to comprehend the concept of Deja Vu fully. I'd experience these strange moments where I felt like I had done the same thing, been in the same place, and felt the same feelings and thoughts. Still, it never truly felt like Deja Vu. Sometimes, I could justify it by telling myself it was simply just repetition. At least, I felt that way up until today.

A particular moment in my childhood plagued my mind for many years. Unfortunately, most childhood memories become fuzzy over time, and the more I recount them, the more they alter, and I find myself questioning the truth of the details. I was no more than 7. My parents, uncle, aunt, cousins, and I drove through my area's nicer, more upscale neighborhood. As we passed the nice houses, my curious child mind couldn't help but stare out the window instead of focusing on whatever toys I'd brought in the car that day. As we made circles through the neighborhood, my eyes settled on something. A beautiful woman dressed in a skin-tight red dress and shiny red heels with a garbage bag slung over her shoulder was walking across the front lawn of a large white two-story home.

I remember feeling a sense of unease at the sight of her. It felt like she didn't belong. Despite the strange feeling, my eyes couldn't pull away from her, and eventually, her eyes locked onto mine. I felt exposed when she noticed me, so I tried to cover up the awkwardness by waving. She instantly waved back and smiled at me—a haunting smile. I quickly turned, facing the front. It felt like hours before our car entirely passed the woman. An interaction that was only seconds long felt like hours. I did anything to distract myself from what I'd just experienced, but I knew we'd pass that house again, that lady, and despite the uncertainty running through me, I knew I wouldn't be able to resist looking. When we finally passed that house again, my stomach dropped. The garbage can was open, and out from the top, a pale pair of legs with shiny red high heels stuck out. 

In that moment, I couldn't move, speak, or breathe. My brain was stuck on the image of the woman's body in that trash can. When I finally returned to reality after seeing a scene no 7-year-old ever should, I began yelling, begging my parents to go back and stumbling over my words as I tried to explain what I'd just seen. My parents thought I was crazy—just a 7-year-old with an overactive imagination. I started to believe that, too.

Now, I walk into my kitchen to find the trash spilling over and roll my eyes at my husband's neglect to take it out earlier as I had asked. As I toss the bag over my shoulder and walk to the curb, I start thinking of that poor woman.

My eyes lifted to a car passing in front of me, at the little girl behind the window. My smile and wave quickly fade just as they appear. The impossible reality slapping me in the face. I look down at my perfect red dress and shiny red heels, unable to breathe or move. For the first time, I can truly say I’m having Deja Vu because I have just locked eyes with my 7-year-old self.
