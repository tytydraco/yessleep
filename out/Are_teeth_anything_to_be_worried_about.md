I recently lost everything, it could have been worse but I think it’s making me paranoid. I’d like to keep myself anonymous, but I need to know if any of these thing mean something.



At the end of my final year of undergrad, my boyfriend of 6 years slept with my best friend, and ever since it’s been one weird thing after another. Getting fucked over that bad is the kind of ridiculous thing you'd never imagine happening to you until it does. I had to move out of his place, and find a new library to work at because I couldn’t afford to live on my own on my current salary. It wasn’t a crazy long distance but I was far enough from my family as it was, having moved out of state. A 30 minute drive took me to Kara’s house, another close friend of mine's but it was over an hour to get home.



Most of my week until my first day at my new job was spent moving in, with help from Kara and her boyfriend. It was a long and awkward process, Jordan, Kara’s boyfriend was someone I hadn’t spent much time with and the two of them are currently on the rocks. Jordan spent most of the time moving, taking directions silently and avoiding sharing a room with us. Kara was no better, when Jordan wasn’t in the room she was complaining about him. It feels like choking trying to comfort her,during the conversations I struggled to break her rambles and usually ended up smothered. It was painful enough feeling my own feelings, and  it was hard to see past them and feel hers.



I love Kara though, we’re good friends, not extremely close but as she continued to have more trouble with Jordan I was beginning to see more and more of her. I wasn’t sure if it was because she felt bad for me or if she also really needed a new best friend to lean on.



Finally having a moment to myself in the apartment however made me miss her rambling. I think everything really started to feel off then, when I was finally alone in the silence of the sterile quiet room. 



Though that bliss was interrupted by a gentle knock on the door behind me, even with its passiveness it caused me to jump. My first thought was that Kara had left something behind, but I opened the door to an unfamiliar face.



The man in front of me was perfectly tanned, speckled with a five o’clock shadow and sporting several age spots. He wasn’t old but he was weathered, his dull brown hair shot in strange directions atop his head, flipping and sticking up at every angle. He clutched the robe he wore and stood with his slippers toe to toe, looking down at me, the yellow light of the hallway casting his shadow down upon me.



He smiled at me and I instinctively smiled back, his face lit up brighter and his shoulder lifted. He moved his hand towards me, “Hi, how are you? Wow, you have a beautiful smile.”



My lips sucked back over my teeth and my head twitched away involuntarily as I swallowed the repulsion. “Thank you.” I didn’t take his hand. “I’m okay.”



His face fell into polite panic and he took his hand away to put them both up between us. “I’m sorry, you do, have a nice smile but I didn’t mean to be weird. I’m Simon, I’m right across the hall.” He stepped aside to point out the door behind him.



I crossed my arms and kept my distance, leaning to look past him “I’m Amelia.”



I didn’t mean to be unkind or cold, even though his comment had initially put me off I wasn’t one to assume the worst. I just hadn’t expected any neighbors to come running to my door to say hi.



He started to speak again but struggled to put together the words, “Um, well my door is always open, if you ever need anything let me know. I work from home so I’m always around.”



“That’s very nice of you,” we stared at each other for a moment. “If I need something, I will let you know.”



“Alright, fantastic,” he smiled again and turned to go back across the hall, but stopped and turned back with his hand still on the doorknob. “Again, not weird I promise.”



I shot him a thumbs up, “Got it.”

  
  
  


After that awkward encounter I didn’t hear from Simon the rest of the night, which admittedly made me inclined to believe that he was in fact not weird. I passed him again on my way out the door the next day going to work, he was in his robe again smoking a cigarette outside the building, he smiled and I smiled back. 



I was lucky enough to have all of this nonsense taking place during the late summer time, just enough time for me to adjust to a new work environment before reintroducing school to my routine. My old manager transferred me to a library closer to my apartment. She was a saint, I wasn’t happy to leave my old place but I am happy to still have somewhere to go. 



Most libraries feel like home anyways, they have the same smell of paper and hand sanitizer that’s pungent in the silence. Something I also favor, enforced quiet really is such a luxury.



The coworkers I met that day were quite the characters, but the only one that really stuck out to me was Lyla. This was partially because she took the time to insert herself into my day persistently. After being introduced to everyone, she volunteered herself to train me.



She was nice enough, I spent most of the time following behind her, listening quietly as she began with a tour. She had a strong build, from behind I could see that her uniform cardigan was struggling at the seams, her broad shoulders making it look almost too small. I had to look up to meet her eyes and every time I did she smiled, running a hand through her close cut hair. 



She seemed to really know her way around and was proud of it, offering to show me how to do countless things and encouraging me to ask questions. I didn’t have any but I tried my best to not make her feel bad about being enthusiastic and asked what I could. 



“Do you like it here?” I asked, we had made it to the end of the tour and she’d brought me to a children’s corner towards the back of the building.



She looked away and then back at me, thinking intently, then nodding, “I do, it’s quiet, we stay busy, I only have to kick people out every once in a while., and I’m friends with just about everyone.”



“You have to kick people out?”



“Well, I’m the only one who ever steps up to do it,” she shrugged.



“But why are you kicking them out in the first place?”



“Oh, it’s usually just kids, kids writing in books, kids talking too loud, or trying to gamble on the computers.” She made herself laugh,”But last week we did have to kick this guy out of the bathrooms, well, I didn’t actually see him but I chased him out the doors.”



I leaned in closer, “You chased him out of the door?”



“I heard someone scream from inside the bathroom and he ran out right after, I keep saying we need to get better cameras because we never saw his face.” Clearly feeling dejected she moved to get up and I followed behind her.



Walking back to the front I trailed behind her again, “Are you, like, worried about him at all?”



She didn’t look back at me, “Mh, not really, some guys are just freaks. If he comes back we’ll try our best to find out who he is.”



Her confidence soothed my worry a little bit, but wasn’t enough to untangle the knot in my stomach that lingered for a few moments after the conversation. While behind the front desk, Lyla showed me how to help someone check out a big. The general process was the same but the computer system they used and where everything around the desk was placed did take me a moment to adjust to.



After a few minutes of practice a line actually began to form at the desk, I expected Lyla to help but she all but completely abandoned me. She had just begun watching from afar, leaning up against a doorway behind me as I went through the process over and over again of checking out books. 



Half way through the line I felt that the man I was checking out was intentionally dragging out our interaction. He had multiple books and was handing them to me one at a time, and when I asked for his card he took his time. He dug through his wallet, biting his bottom lip and revealing an array of darkened teeth.



“Here it is, sorry,” He finally handed me his card, in a way that forced his hand to touch mine. “You’re beautiful, by the way.”



I kept my head down, taking the opportunity to close my eyes and breathe while he couldn’t see my face. “Thank you, I appreciate that.”



By now I had re-piled all of his books back in front of him and given him his card back. He tilted his head to this side and looked me up and down, “You think I could get your number?”



In a desperate attempt to avoid eye contact, my gaze moved past him and accidentally collided with the gaze of another man in line. He was clearly tuned in to our conversation and was just as uncomfortable, if not angered by the encounter.



“No, I'm sorry.” I said, pushing his books toward him.



“Are you sure? Why not?” He was still smiling even while upset, “You have a boyfriend?”



“No, I don’t, but I just got out of a relationship-”



“So you’re single-”



“I got cheated on, okay. So leave me alone, I don’t want another relationship right now.” I interrupted him, making sure to not disturb the quiet of the library while still speaking over him. 



I don’t know what took so long but by then Lyla had made it to my side and was pushing herself in front of me. The sound of their gentle argument dulled in my ears as I stood behind her, looking down at the floor. When I next looked up the line had vanished and Lyla was looking back at me with a concerned expression.



“I’m okay, Lyla I promise, it’s not the end of the world.” I took a seat in the rickety office chair behind me and Lyla sat leaned on the desk.



“I know but I’d hate for you to leave the place with such an awful first impression.” By now we were some of the last people around and even the quiet of the library felt softer.”Do you want me to walk you to your car, now that you're about to be off?”



“You really don’t have to do that, the parking lot is not that big, I won’t get lost.”



“Yeah but I don’t mind, what if that guy is still lingering when you leave? It’s dark out-”



I cut her off, “Okay, you can walk me, but it’s really not that big of a deal.”



“Perfect, I will get my coat.”



Lyla did in fact walk me all the way to the car, and I think if she had been able to, she would have driven me home too. It was sweet, I didn’t feel like I would have been able to protect myself in a dangerous situation, but I also didn’t necessarily like seeing myself as someone who needs protecting. Lyla waved  goodbye as I drove away, and I had waved back shyly, trying not to crash.

  
  
  


Sitting in my car at home, I checked my phone to see what time it was, and as I did a notification flashed at the top of the screen and then quickly vanished. I couldn’t tell what it was exactly, I caught a flash of the instagram icon but nothing more. It was most likely that someone had accidentally liked an old photo of mine, and I was curious who had been peeking at my profile. I giggled at the time and brushed it off, collecting my things to go inside.



When I stepped out of my car I was immediately met with the sound of shuffling quickly, I turned my head back and my vision was engulfed in darkness. Arms wrapped over my shoulders and pushed me back, I put my hands to my face, I pushed myself free of what I now knew was hair,dark  tight coils tickling my nose. The smell of it filled my mind with Kara and I knew it was her, I sighed and wrapped my arms around her in return.



I pushed her away just a moment later, “What the fuck is wrong with you?” Looking at her face now I could see now that she was crying. 



Kara sniffled and pushed her curls behind her ears. “Jordan, he’s not talking to me right.”



“Again? This is ridiculous Kara, you can’t keep doing this to yourself, it’s not good for you.” I grabbed my bag from the passenger seat and walked past her towards my apartment. 



“I can’t leave him Mia, and it’s really not that bad I promise.” She had continued to talk as we walked up the stairs to my place and into the apartment, taking a seat amongst the boxes on my couch. “He’s just been acting really weird lately and I don’t know what to do. He won’t talk to me and he won’t tell me what’s wrong. I don't know what to do.”



“How has he been acting weird?” I asked, calling to her from my bedroom.



“Nothing too weird, but he wouldn’t shut up about how awkward *we* apparently made it while moving in. I’m starting to think he doesn’t like you but I don’t know why.”



I moved into the living room and shrugged*,* “Probably cause he can feel that I don’t like him.”



*“*Well, you’re not very good at hiding it,” she glared at me over her phone.



“That’s not my fault.”



“I didn’t say it was.” She looked back down at her phone and continued to scroll. 



I stayed between the hall and the living room for a moment and then went back to my room. I hadn’t known how long she had planned to stay but it was late and I was going to get comfortable. Putting on my pjs and a fresh pair of underwear I had then taken the moment to tidy my room.



Until then I think everything was ordinary, until then I think I was just overreacting but I really can’t be sure. I need someone to tell me that I’m crazy, that nothing means anything, and there is a natural conclusion.



But I had found a tooth.



Under my pillow.



It was laying neatly on the sheet, discolored and dried, lacking a wet shine. Its freshly dried and yellowed crust reeked of a distinctly disgusting human rot. An adult sized tooth for sure, roots and all, like it had just been ripped from the gums, but there was no blood. There was no pool of fluid or anything else human looking, it looked like it just happened to be there. 



I cupped my hand to my mouth and held back my gags, struggling to act and being unable to decide between getting Kara or getting rid of it first. There was no way that I was touching the tooth, I would have to get something to wrap it in.



If it wasn’t clear already I hadn’t lost any teeth recently, and I hadn’t put any under my pillow either. I was almost positive I had locked my door on my way out but I suppose I couldn’t be sure. I looked around the room and nothing felt out of place, the only new thing was the tooth. I checked to see if my window was open or unlocked but it was shut tight. I didn’t understand what was happening, I couldn't come up with any other explanation to how a tooth could have ended up in my room.



I heard Kara begin talking again from the other room and decided that as of right now I didn’t want to get her involved. Not because I didn’t want to scare her or anything but because I wasn’t entirely sure if this was something to be concerned about. I know it sounds ridiculous but she also probably wasn’t going to be very helpful at the moment anyways and I wanted to have some time to myself to think.



Kara didn’t ask a lot of questions when I rushed her out the door, it seemed like Jordan had decided they were on speaking terms again and she was on her way to make things right. 



I took a piece of toilet paper and I picked the tooth up off my sheet, placing it on my vanity. It’s too late to put my sheets in the communal laundry but I didn’t want to sleep in the same sheets so I threw them aside for now. 



I still have the tooth and I’m not sure what to do with it, it doesn’t look strange other than the fact that it is clearly diseased and not well taken care of. 



This could all be for nothing and I could be overreacting but I really don’t understand what other explanation there is other than someone was in my house.
