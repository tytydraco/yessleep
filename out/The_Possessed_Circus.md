It was a hot summer day when the circus came to town. The colorful tents and blaring music lured in crowds of excited children and their parents. One attraction, in particular, caught my eye - a display of creepy clown dolls in the center of the main tent.

I had always been afraid of clowns, but something about these dolls was even more unsettling. They had twisted grins and beady, glassy eyes that seemed to follow me wherever I went. I couldn't shake the feeling that they were watching me, judging me.

Despite my unease, I decided to take a closer look. As I approached the display, I noticed that one of the dolls was missing. It was a small, porcelain doll with frizzy red hair and a sinister smile. I shrugged it off and continued my tour of the circus.

As the night went on, strange things started happening. I would see flashes of the missing clown doll out of the corner of my eye, but when I turned to look, it was always gone. I tried to brush it off as my imagination, but the feeling of being watched only intensified.

The following day, I returned to the circus to see the afternoon show. As I took my seat, I couldn't help but notice that the red-haired clown doll was back in its place in the display. I tried to ignore the feeling of dread that washed over me and focused on the show.

The acrobats and animals were impressive, but the highlight of the show was the clown act. The main clown, a towering figure with a painted white face and bright red lips, performed death-defying stunts that had the entire audience gasping. But as the show went on, I started to notice something off about the clown.

His movements were jerky and unnatural, and his laughter seemed forced and hollow. And then, I saw it - the red-haired clown doll was perched on his shoulder, its beady eyes fixed on me. I couldn't take it anymore. I had to get out of there.

I fought my way through the crowded tent and ran as fast as I could. I didn't stop until I was blocks away from the circus. I collapsed on a bench, panting and trying to catch my breath. That's when I saw it - the clown doll, sitting at my feet with a twisted grin on its face.

I screamed and kicked it away, then fled back to my hotel room. I locked the door behind me and tried to calm my racing heart. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched, and I knew it was only a matter of time before the clown came for me.

I barely slept that night, and when morning came, I packed my bags and fled the town. I never looked back, and I never spoke of the possessed circus to anyone. But to this day, I can still feel the red-haired clown doll's beady eyes on me, waiting for its chance to strike again.
