[Part one](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n5osiw/i_thought_my_husband_was_cheating_the_truth_was/)

So, I agreed to kill my baby. Sounds crazy I know.

I wasn’t going to write this. I told myself I needed to focus on learning how to cope with loss again, on coming to terms with something I couldn’t see, something waiting to rip my baby from me the moment it was born. But even with what happened, I need to remember, I agreed to this.

I’m writing this from a place of healing, you might not think I deserve peace, but I do. I’ll start from where I left off, that way, when I’m ready, I can put it together and maybe give it to someone that can help me.

At first, I thought Ethan was the problem. I thought the late nights, the hidden phone, the messages from “Alex” meant there was another woman. That would have been easier. I could have hated him for cheating. I could have left. But it wasn’t that simple. It was never another woman. It was her.

The hollow lady. Sounds made up right? Yeah, that’s what I though too, until Ethan led her right to us. To me. She’s not a person, not anymore. But in order to save my living Baby, I had to promise her my unborn child.

The deal was made with Ethan, we couldn’t have kids naturally, so Ethan turned to dark magic to help. we got to have jessie in return for any and all subsequent babies.

 I didn’t know any of this until it was too late, until I was already pregnant with my second, until she came knocking to collect her debt. Once she heard I was trying to back out of a deal I didn’t agree to, she tried to take Jessie back.

You need to understand I didn’t have a choice. My only child was dying in front of me. You can’t tell me you wouldn’t have done the same.

I was 37 weeks pregnant when I finally snapped. We had just returned from a growth scan at the hospital. I’d been going every fortnight since 32 weeks. That was when the labour scare happened. The contractions had started thick and fast, seemingly out of nowhere. Any premature labour would bring panic, but for me the grief and dread overrode every other sense.

I’d felt this baby kick and wriggle inside me since I was 20 weeks, and I knew the minute it was born she would take it. I wasn’t ready to let go.

The doctors weren’t even going to try to stop it. They said the weight was good, the lungs should be strong enough to just need a little oxygen. Survival rate: 95%. But I knew if that baby took a breath, its survival rate was zero.

We sat in silence in the car. The sonographer’s sweet voice looped in my head as she smiled and said everything looked fine, the baby was growing well. I should have felt relief. Instead, all I could think about was the smell in the room when I begged them to stop the labour, that same sickly wave of patchouli clinging to the curtains, seeping through the vents. And in the corner, just for a second between contractions, I thought I saw her. A shadow stretched too long to belong to anything human.

The labour stopped on its own. Later I read that stress can inhibit the release of oxytocin and slow or stall labour. Maybe that was it. Or maybe she was just toying with me.

sat across from Ethan at the dinner table, warming my hands on a cup of too-bitter coffee. The steam curled into my face, making my eyes sting. I cleared my throat, trying to sound casual.

“We should give him a name.”

Ethan didn’t look up. He pushed the last of his dinner around his plate with the side of his fork, like if he stalled long enough, I’d take the words back.

“There’s no point,” he muttered at last. His voice was flat, but his knuckles whitened around the fork.

I felt my stomach twist. The baby kicked hard against my ribs, as if demanding I argue back. I wanted to scream, to throw the cup across the room, but all I managed was a whisper.

“He deserves a name.”

Ethan finally looked at me then, and in his eyes, I didn’t see anger or cruelty. I saw resignation. The look of a man who believed he’d already buried his son.

“Name or not, Cara, in three weeks’ time, he won’t be ours anymore.” Ethan choked the words out, failing to hold back tears. He wiped them away quickly with the back of his hand and looked away.

“He’s ours right now,” I said softly. “I don’t want to give up hope yet.”

He shoved his chair back, the screech of the legs driving nails into my brain. “There’s nothing we can do.”

“Isn’t there?” I shot back. “She seemed pretty pissed off when I didn’t agree to the deal…”

“Yeah,” Ethan said bitterly. “And it almost killed Jessie.”

“I know.” My voice dropped to a solemn whisper. “But think about it, if she needed me to agree, she must be bound by something, right? Deals. Promises. Rules.”

“What do you mean?” he asked, slumping back into his seat, defeated. I could see the weariness etched into his face. He sighed, resting his chin in his hands.

 This wasn’t the first time I’d had a question, or an idea, or a theory. They never amounted to more than disappointment or heartache. But I wasn’t willing to just sit back and let this happen.

“I mean, maybe there’s a way out,” I pressed. “Why was she banging on the other side of that door like a pissed-off toddler?”

Ethan’s head shot up, eyes flicking around the room like the mere thought of mocking her might call her back.

“She wanted to scare you,” he whispered cautiously.

“Yeah, but why? If she was all-powerful, why did she need to scare me into submission?”

He raised an eyebrow, unease creeping into his expression.

“She needed my agreement, Ethan. That means she can’t just take what she wants, not without rules to follow. If there are rules, maybe there’s a way to break them.”

He shook his head. “But I was the one who made the deal with her—”

“But I’m the one making the payment!” I shot back.

“He’s my baby too,” Ethan said, his voice breaking.

I barked a bitter laugh. “Oh, fuck off, Ethan. You donated a cell and thirty seconds of your time to making this baby. The rest has been me — my body, my blood, my fear.”

His face crumpled. The fight went out of him all at once, and for the first time I saw him small, broken. “I’m sorry,” he whimpered, finally breaking. His shoulders shook as the words scraped out of him. “I’m so sorry, Cara.”

I’ve never been good with emotions; I have plenty of my own but dealing with someone else’s is… awkward. I reached out for his hand across the table, pulling it closer and caressed in with my thumb.

I didn’t know what to say. I’d waited for this break down for weeks, the acceptance that what he had done wasn’t in OUR best interests it was in his. Id waited for this apology. Now that it was here. I didn’t even want to gloat. It just felt wrong.

“Its… It’ll be ok.”

He shook his head, his eyes swollen and red still never meeting mine. “It doesn’t matter. The minute you defied her; she went for the next best thing. Jessie almost died. Do you really want to test her again?”

“I don’t want to just give up.” My voice cracked, the weight of it spilling out. “I won’t.”

Ethan pulled his hand away gently and dragged it over his face, slumping lower in his chair. “Every time you get your hopes up, it just makes the fall worse. There’s no loophole, Cara. There’s no way around this.”

I nodded once and stood slowly. Unsure if it were the weight of the baby or the weight of the responsibility to fix this on my own making me struggle to my feet.

His words didn’t kill the thoughts spiralling in my head. If there were rules, there had to be a story behind them. And if there was a story, someone out there knew it.

I found myself sitting, frustrated, in the only library in Corvus Vale at 37+4 weeks pregnant. The chair groaned under me as I shifted for the hundredth time, trying to find a position that didn’t make my back ache or my ribs throb from the baby’s kicks.

Books were spread out across the table like a crime scene, folklore, local history, old parish records. I’d pulled everything I thought might hold an answer. All of them were useless.

There were plenty of ghost stories, but they were all clearly fictional. A few dusty volumes on real, documented witch trials dating back to the 16th century. But not a single mention of her.

No Hollow Lady.

Christ, I even tried YouTube but ended up going down a google rabbit hole on why some pasta was creepy.

I snapped the last book shut, the sound echoing through the halls, earning a glare from the librarian.

 I muttered an apology I didn’t mean, then hauled myself up, using the table as leverage, wincing at the pressure in my hips. Thirty–seven weeks pregnant and about as graceful as a tank.

The rain hit me the second I stepped outside. Cold and sharp. I pulled my coat tighter, head down against the drizzle. That’s when it happened.

Something whizzed past my ear, close enough to stir the hair on my cheek. I ducked instinctively, my heart slamming against my ribs. “Jesus Christ!” I yelped into the empty street. For a second I thought it was a drone, but when I spun around, all I caught was a flash of white feathers disappearing around the corner.

A bird.

My bird.

“Jerry?” The name slipped out before I could stop it.

Against my better judgment, I followed.

The side street was narrow and slick with patches of damp moss, the kind of place you’d normally cross the road to avoid.

The crow’s white feathers glowed against the grey as it expertly manoeuvred itself through a half-open shop door.

Madam Morrigan’s Morbid Curiosities.

The words curled across the rotting wood in faded gold paint. Beneath it, the shop window was crammed with strange clutter: antique knives, cloudy jars, bones, half-melted candles. It looked less like a display and more like a murder-weapon dump site.

I swallowed hard and turned away. I hadn’t taken two steps before Jerry cawed loudly behind me.

I spun to see him perched on the sill. He tilted his head once, sharp, and deliberate, then hopped down and fluttered back inside. Like he had led me here on purpose.

“Yep,” I mouthed. “Totally normal.”

The bell above the door gave a weak, uneven chime as I pushed it open.

The air was thick and stale. Not the choking patchouli I’d come to dread, but something heavier. Dust. Melted candle wax. The faint metallic tang of rusting iron.

Shelves leaned against the walls, every one of them crowded with things that felt stolen from graves: cloudy jars with labels too faded to read, cracked porcelain dolls with eyes that followed me, strings of bird skulls looped together like rosary beads.

In the corner, the white crow shifted inside its open cage, feathers gleaming unnaturally bright against the gloom. It clicked its beak once, sharp, and deliberate, before hopping to the edge of the cage as if to mark my arrival.

A woman stood behind the counter, draped in black lace and velvet shawl, her long grey hair pinned back with what looked disturbingly like bones. Her eyes caught mine instantly, sharper than the knives on display.

“You are late,” she said. Her voice was soft and low, carrying the weight of someone who already knew why I was there.

“I… I am?” I stuttered, raising an eyebrow.

Her bangles chimed as she gestured to the white crow. “He has been circling you for weeks. Trying to lead you here.”

The crow cawed sharply, as if in agreement.

“He’s been sitting at my window eating the last of my biscuits,” I muttered.

Madam Morrigan’s lips curved, not quite a smile. “Nothing bound to me lingers without reason, feeding him wasn’t the reason, although. he is partial to a custard cream.” She said as she glided over to his cage and shut the latch.

“Why then?” I asked.

“It seems you’re in a spot of bother,” she said casually. “That is why you are standing in my shop instead of burying your child.”

My face dropped. “Who are you?” I demanded.

“Me? Oh, many things. Small business owner, fortune teller, collector of fine items.” She gestured around the cluttered shop like she was showing off a school science project. “Friends call me Madam Morrigan. And you, my dear, are…”

“Suspicious as fuck,” I cut in.

For a long moment she just stared at me. Then her shoulders began to shake. A laugh spilled out, low and rasping, the sound of dry leaves scraping together.

“Oh, I do like you,” she said at last, eyes glittering in the gloom. “Sharp tongue. Shame that never saves anyone.”

The crow cawed once, loud enough to make me flinch.

“Can you help me?” I pleaded. My voice cracked. I hated how small it sounded.

Madam Morrigan’s expression shifted. The smile didn’t fade, but it changed, softer, colder, the way someone might look at a child holding a broken toy.

“No, I didn’t. I don’t know who that is,” I said sharply.

“You have met the Hollow Lady, yes?” she asked, drifting past me to the door. The key turned with a soft click as she locked it.

A prickle of anxiousness shot up my spine like electricity.

“Yes,” I whispered, the word leaving my mouth like a confession.

“Then you have met Constance Arthur.” She smiled, leaving the key in the lock and gesturing for me to follow.

I stalled, heart hammering. Should I run, or hear her out? I didn’t know this woman, and I didn’t know if I was safe. But I did know one thing, I needed help, and I was running out of time.

\*

The chair creaked under my weight as I sat across from Madam Morrigan. I wiggled uncomfortably, trying to ease the pressure in my back, while she flipped through a large book with a faded leather cover. The pages crackled like dry leaves, edges browned and curling with age.

Symbols and cramped handwriting sprawled across the parchment. Some looked like prayers, others like curses. I couldn’t tell the difference.

She stopped on a page marked with a ribbon the colour of dried blood. Her bangles chimed as she pressed her palm flat against it, keeping it open.

“This is where her chapter begins,” Madam Morrigan said, eyes fixed on the page, but voice aimed squarely at me. “Would you like to hear her story?”

“Will it help me save my baby?” I asked.

She smiled thinly. “Probably not,” she said, then added, “but it might help you understand what you are up against.”

Behind me, the crow shifted in its cage nervously.

Madam Morrigan began.

“Constance Arthur was born in Corvus Vale in 1616, the daughter of a healer. She grew up among roots and herbs, learning the quiet craft of charms and midwifery. By the time she was grown, she had become a midwife herself, respected and trusted.”

She turned a brittle page. “She married Stanley Arthur, a carpenter of good standing. At first, they were happy. But her womb was a grave. Several Miscarriages followed their marriage then A stillbirth. The midwives brought talismans and silver rattles to her bedside, hoping to ward off spirits they blamed for her losses.”

At last, she bore a daughter, named Mercy. But Mercy lived only sixteen days. That was Stanley’s last straw.

I swallowed hard, heat crawling up my throat.

“She was like me?”

“Indeed, she was, child but just as two loaves may start from the same dough, if mistreated, one may rise, and the other may sour.”

She cleared her throat, “there’s more” she began.

“Whispers spread through the vale: that Constance was cursed, that her touch spoiled children. Stanley turned bitter, then cruel, and at last denounced her outright. To save himself, he accused his wife of witchcraft.

Constance was brought to trial during the witch-hunts. She was sentenced to hang in 1636.

It was said that, in desperation Constance called out not to God, but to something else. And it listened.

The day of execution, it was documented the rope snapped — not once, but six times. The magistrates called it a sign of God’s will, but the people of Corvus Vale whispered it was something else entirely.

The crow cawed once, sharp, and sudden.

“She was spared but not freed. Exiled to Hollowthorn Forest, east of here. Alone. And then the rumours began. That her dark magic could help barren women. That she could succeed where medicine and prayer had failed. And so, they went to her. Begged her. And she gave. Always in exchange for a bargain.”

My hands folded protectively over my stomach before I even realised.

Morrigan’s eyes glittered in the lamplight. “Each bargain etched away at her soul. Even after death in 1720 they came. scratching symbols into the walls and leaving offerings, praying she might hear them.

And those who prayed too loud… sometimes found their prayers answered.

By then she was no longer known as a wife. No longer as a midwife. Only the Hollow Lady.

 She shut the book with a crack that made me flinch. “And you, child, are in her path.”

My mouth went dry. “What does that mean?”

Morrigan leaned forward, bangles chiming as her arms folded on the table. Her eyes were steady, unblinking.

“It means you are bound to her now. Constance Arthur was a woman betrayed by broken vows. A husband who swore to love her, then cast her aside. A court that promised her death yet left her swinging in limbo. She swore she would never lose another child… and she kept that promise. That is why she clings to every oath, every word, every silence. To her, a promise is not a comfort. It is a chain. And she will not let this go.”

The crow cawed again, sharp, and sudden, as if sealing the words.

in the front of the shop, I was struggling to get into be still soaked coat when Madam Morrigan slid the book across the counter, Beside it she set down a pouch of coarse salt, a small vial of holy water, and a bundle of dried herbs tied with red string.

“I’ll loan you the book. Use Salt for protection. Water for cleansing. And this,” she tapped the herbs, “to burn if you must call her off in a hurry. Not that it will save you for long.”

I gathered them up, stuffing them into my bag. The cracked leather cover rough and heavy in my arms. My chest felt tight with a strange mix of dread and relief.

I thanked her and turned to leave “Ah, ah,” Morrigan chided, her bangles clinking as she held out a hand. “That will be twelve pounds ninety-seven, please.”

I blinked. “Seriously?”

Her lips curved. “I told you, child. I run a small business.” 

\*

 I struggled to keep my swollen feet balanced on the cushions underneath them as the baby kicked against the book resting on my stomach.

“What’s that?” Ethan asked, flopping onto the sofa beside me.

“Fifty Shades of Grey, haunted edition,” I muttered without looking up.

He smirked and reached for it. “Didn’t think that was your type.”

I let him take it, watching his face shift as he flipped through the brittle, ink-stained pages. The smirk faded fast.

“This isn’t funny,” he whispered. His thumb traced a line of cramped writing, his eyes wide and glassy. “Cara… this is it; this is the same spell. The one I used.”

I swiped the book back from him, studying the page. “You had this book?” I scowled. “You had this book, and you didn’t read about who the fuck she was first!?”

“No!” he protested, hands up like I had a knife to his throat. “Alex sent me the spell with a list of instructions. I didn’t have any book.”

The words sank like stones in my chest. Alex again. Always Alex.

“So, you just… what, recited this without question?” My voice cracked between rage and disbelief.

“I was desperate,” he said. His voice broke on the word, his hands dragging down his face. “I didn’t think—”

“No, you didn’t,” I snapped, clutching the book tighter.

my eyes scanned over the page, reading what Ethan read all those months ago aloud.

Ingredients:

A circle of salt, to keep her in

A token of loss, for things that have been

Water and oil, the scent of earth, “that was patchouli” Ethan interrupted” “oh I fucking know”

A candle of black, to bind the birth. 

Invocation:

Hollow Lady, hear my plea,

Take my grief and answer me.

Mother who lost, who swore no more,

Open for me your shadowed door.

I bring you pain; I bring you need,

I bring the blood of broken seed.

Give me a child, and let it grow,

And I will grant what you claim I owe.

The choice is always yours to set,

I will freely pay you for my debt.

For a chain must be willingly clasped,

Or it cannot hold, nor ever last.

 “A chain must be willingly clasped?” I repeated, raising an eyebrow.

“Yeah. I had to do it willingly, so I had to say all that stuff about paying my debt freely.”

“You did,” I shot back, “but I didn’t.”

“Yeah, you did. In the bedroom.” His voice was flat, resigned. “You agreed when she threatened Jessie.”

“When she threatened Jessie, Ethan.”

He just stared at me, blank faced.

“For Christ’s sake.” I hauled myself upright, heat flaring in my chest. “Threatening someone into submission isn’t willingness. That’s agreement under duress.”

“This isn’t Law and Order, Cara,” he muttered, scrubbing a hand down his face. “She’s not going to care about semantics. She’s an evil demon, not a judge.”

“Then why put it in the spell?” I snapped.

“I think I’m onto something here.” The baby kicked in agreement, and I pressed a hand to my stomach.

Ethan hesitated, knuckles pressed white against his knees. “Maybe it’s tradition. Maybe there’s some rule even demons have to follow. Maybe it is a loophole. I don’t know, Cara. I just needed to say it as is, even if—”

“Even if she had to twist our arms until they broke?” My voice shook. The memory of Jessie’s wide, terrified eyes flashed in my mind, and my hands clenched into fists.

He looked away, picking at a loose thread on his cuff, jaw tight. “You think I don’t know that? You think I don’t hate it?”

I dragged in a shaky breath. “So, what do we do now? If the chain only holds because I said yes, but I didn’t really—”

“Then maybe there’s a way to break it,” he finished, hope flickering briefly in his tired eyes.

“Or at least bend it,” I murmured. “Demons love their loopholes, don’t they?”

A rueful smile touched his lips. “Almost as much as [solicitors.”](https://youtu.be/QXJ0PcmOd_E)
