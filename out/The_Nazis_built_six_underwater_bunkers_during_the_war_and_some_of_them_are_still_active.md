The walls shake.

The secretive mechanisms of the machine rattle all around us; muted, like distant thunder.

The six of are gently rocked, highly conscious of the reverberations.

“…It sounds so far away”, Szymon mutters in his thick Polish accent.

I look up at him.

Kim responds with an uneasy chuckle: “I was just thinking the same thing”. The two smile at each other. Reassurance, I think. She glances at me, then adjusts her weapon.

I reach a hand to my forehead to rub away a thin sheen of sweat.

Before embarking on this particular mission, I did not admit to the others the intensity of my claustrophobia.

I grimace and look around, at the windowless inner-walls of the submarine, and I try not to think about the enormity of the weight of the water above our heads. The weight growing heavier and heavier by the minute, as we sink deeper and deeper into the depths of the Atlantic.

“Ten minutes til docking” warbles a distorted voice through the overhead speaker, accompanied by a dim red light. An unseen cloud of anxiety flows through the cabin like gas, and I scratch my jaw, discomforted and unsettled.

It reeks in here.

It smells like rank, stale pool water and sweat. Sweat with metallic undertones.

Szymon slides off his glasses, then rubs them on the material of his military fatigues, to little success. He mutters something to himself in Polish as he pushes them back up onto his nose.

The six of us have very different backgrounds, but what we share is our common station, a NATO barracks at the edge of Germany.

“Nearly time now”, says the man to my left. Blaine, a Scotsman who lives in my quarters. “Let’s get this fucken’ show on the road, shall we?”

I raise my eyebrows at him and give him a grim-half smile, but no-one replies directly.

To his left is Rudy, an American keen to tell anyone who’ll listen about his German heritage, despite having ‘O’Riley’ as a last name, which I get some personal amusement from. I’m married to a German myself, a wonderful woman called Nina, but the only actual German natives amongst us this evening are Kim, and Manny.

Kim’s a good friend of Nina’s, though we’re not actually particularly well-acquainted. I see her around the barracks but we don’t have much in common. When we speak, we tend to speak about my wife, which aside from the army is our only real point of shared investment.

Kim sometimes jokes that she knows Nina better than I do.

&#x200B;

…I’m not sure how I feel about such jokes.

&#x200B;

But she’s nice enough.

Beside her is the other German, born-and-bred, and that’s Manny. Currently snoozing, Manny’s an old boy. A grandson, in fact, of one of the men who helped run the, uh… ‘installations’… we’re about to visit. He’s sleeping, for now. Not sure how he manages it, but he’s a trooper.

I look down at my boots, and reflect on the objectives at hand.

&#x200B;

Exit the submarine.

Enter into the bunker.

Gather intel.

Report back.

&#x200B;

Simple enough, I suppose.

But the ‘bunker’ is one of several. A relic from the Second World War and kindly left behind by the Nazis… near-unreachable at the bottom of the Atlantic ocean.

There aren’t many pictures of these bunkers, and of the pictures that *do* exist it’s difficult to determine scale or size, but by all accounts the bunkers are monstrous things. Massive installations of concrete and metal and God knows what else, spread in a rough half-circle round the entrance to the Mediterranean.

Earlier today the six of us flew out from Geilenkirchen, transferred to submarine at the Lison Naval Base, and it’s been a long, miserable ride west from there.

&#x200B;

Every team that goes to the bunkers reports back the same thing. That they’re no major threat, there’s nothing to be found of interest, and since they’re causing no environmental damage and pose no strategic threat, NATO might as well leave them be. Operations out into the ocean to destroy and clean-up the wreckage are expensive and time-consuming, and let’s face it- there’s always something more important to deal with than some forgotten concrete halls at the bottom of the sea.

&#x200B;

Some busybody NATO pen-pusher must have noticed the bunkers were years overdue a visit, I guess, kicked up a fuss, and so the papers were shuffled and pawns moved around the board, and here we are.

&#x200B;

On the way down.

&#x200B;

Down, down, down into the deep.

&#x200B;

I try not to think about the tight, metal confines of the submarine. I pray that I will be afforded more space to move and think and breathe when we’re actually inside the bunker.

&#x200B;

The little red light by the speaker flicks back into life, and the jumbled voice comes through once again, this time louder with a whip-like electronic crackling.

“**Five** minutes to go”, it says, as I start with alarm.

&#x200B;

Manny is frightened out of his sleep with a gasp and a raspy exclamation. He splutters out a name that I do not recognise, one that means nothing to me.

“*Friedrich!”* he calls out into the gloom, jumping to his feet in panic. I hear some of the bones in his legs click as he does so.

“Jesus,” Szymon mutters, reaching a hand to his chest. “Scared the life out of me”.

The eyes in the submarine regard Manny warily. This is not the first time he has had such an outburst.

“Friedrich…” Manny mumbles again, looking around the vessel at his fellow passengers, expression glazed, confusion marked across his face.

Kim reaches up for his arm. “The dreams again, Manny?” she asks, gently beckoning him back down.

Manny just stares at her for a moment, then relents, slowly sinking back onto the bench, rubbing at the grey around his temples wearily.

&#x200B;

“Yes”, he replies, in German. “Yes, apologies. I don’t know what comes over me. They have been getting worse”.

“What was it this time?” Kim asks him.

He shakes his head. “It’s already fading, but… I believe it was similar to before. The people I saw in the dreamscape were none that I have ever actually *met*. I do not recall having ever seen them. Not in this life. In my dream, however, I knew them… I knew them all. They were- important to me. We were in a field of long grass, and there was a young man- *Freidrich*… He was… he was going to war”.

Kim chews her cheek a little as she considers this.

“I don’t think I expected him to come back”, Manny says quietly, as the submarine rumbles. “I knew that he was being sent to his death”.

“They’re connected to your grandfather”, Kim says with self-imposed certainty. “I’m sure of it. That’s why they’re getting worse. Ever since you volunteered to come on the mission- your subconscious knew you’d be getting closer to him, to his place of work-”

“Load of bullcrap”, Rudy chimes him, his hair flopping as he leans forward over his gun. “Kim you gotta stop with this supernatural shit. It’s all in your mind, Manny. In fact, Kim, you hit the nail on the head just now. It’s all in your subconscious, man. Just let it go. It’ll be some repressed Nazi guilt or something”. He jabs a finger towards Manny and furrows his brow. “I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. You aren’t guilty of any kind of Nazi crimes, just because your Grandaddy was an SS officer or whatever”.

Manny sighs wearily, he reaches his hand into a pocket and produces a handkerchief, which he uses to dab his forehead. “I am well aware of this”, he responds drily. “My grandfather was not in the SS. But I appreciate your passion on this matter”.

“Damn straight”, Rudy replies, leaning back in his seat.

&#x200B;

Blaine and I exchange a look.

I can empathise at least a little with Manny’s internal struggle. Regarding his Nazi grandfather, I mean. My wife shares his burden, as her own great-grandfather was a colleague of his. They both worked together in a close capacity, I am told. Or at least, that’s what the records indicate.

&#x200B;

“Prepare for docking”, crackles the voice through the speaker, and for a second or two the light in the submarine falters, shrouding us all in temporary, sickly darkness.

I suppress a shudder as we get ready to disembark, and the rumbling all around us wavers intermittently between louder, and quieter.

&#x200B;

…Louder, and quieter.

&#x200B;

The sounds of the engine rise to their greatest volume since we left the port at Lisbon, then fade to a soft and steady background murmur.

Blaine rises to his feet. “Let’s check this place out then, eh. The First Bunker. Reckon we’ll find anything fun?”

Syzmon joins him, stretching as he does so. “I doubt it. They recon this place every, what, ten or so years? And they’ve never brought back anything interesting. I doubt we’ll see more than a collection of dusty old Nazi ruins”.

You don’t find that interesting?” I ask, as I prepare to disembark. “Morbid, sure. But not even a *little* interesting?”

Szymon makes a noise of disgust and mutters something to himself. “I find *no* interest in the droppings of vermin”, he says, and turns away.

The cynic in me sees Szymon shoot a quick glance at Manny before he does so, and this cynical part of me is keen to interpret it with dark thoughts, but that would do the man a disservice. Szymon is a good fellow. Hard-working.

Blaine heads through the narrow inner-body of the submarine towards the ladders, and Szymon follows on behind.

Behind him goes Rudy, flicking his hair from his face, and he’s followed by Kim, and Manny. Manny places a hand on my shoulder and gives me a tired smile as he passes me by. I return it, then with a deep sigh of relief, I say goodbye to this room in the submarine, for now. I’m looking forward to a little more space to breathe.

&#x200B;

One by one we ascend the ladders and out through the circular hatch in the submarine’s roof.

&#x200B;

I allow in a great lungful of air as I do so, squinting through the darkness as I fumble for my torch, switching it on and joining its yellow-gold beam with the others.

We stand on the cold metal roof of the submarine, half-visible, protruding like an iron whale from the black waters below, lapping hungrily at its sides.

Ahead of us is a steel rail, and a vast concrete platform that extends into shadow.

&#x200B;

The bunker, from the inside, has the look of an enormous hangar.

Kim taps my shoulder then gestures up towards the back of the hall, closer to the ceiling, and I follow her gaze and raise my light.

Our beams fall upon a colossal eagle carved into a sheet of rock, itself embedded in concrete. The eagle is angular and cold and sits proudly upon an enormous swastika.

Szymon crosses himself and spits into the water, before taking a few long steps and leaping from the edge of the submarine’s roof to the concrete platform, his boots scraping against the side.

He hauls himself up with the aid of the steel rail, and we listen to the sounds of his boots against the ground as he looks for the mechanism which will release a bridge for safer passage.

It was in the file, so it shouldn’t be too hard to find.

I glance down into the water below; the smell of salt is thick in the air.

I am unable to keep from my head the fleeting thought of a sudden slip, of tumbling down into that dark and quietly rippling water. Its softness a twisted mask to conceal the terror if its icy depth and unforgiving pull hidden away beneath.

I shiver, and look away.

A few cold moments pass and with the eventual rattling of gears and springs, a bridge begins to extend from the side of the concrete, out towards our spot on the sub.

Blaine tests it first, and then one by one we cross, joining Szymon on the platform proper.

We begin to cross the floor, making our way towards the gridded double-doors at the hall’s far end, at present only gloomy rectangles in the distance.

&#x200B;

I feel very small in here. Even as a part of a team of six, I can’t help but feel… insignificant. Dwarfed by the intensity of this deserted lair.

&#x200B;

“This is a sick place”, Manny says in a low voice. His eyes flash momentarily, as a stray beam of light passes across his face. “Do you feel it, Oliver?”

After a beat, I nod in agreement. There is something wrong here, something on a level I can’t quite grasp, just yet.

I glance up to the eagle as we walk beneath it.

This is no *passing-fancy* historical site.

“Are you alright?” I ask him.

“Yes”, he replies, “yes, for now”.

I don’t know exactly why Manny volunteered for this mission. He’s the *only* one who volunteered, for one thing. The rest of us were simply ordered.

I think he pulled some strings and cashed in some favours. Convinced the brass he’d be of use, given his knowledge of, and experience in decommissioning former Nazi sites and places of…

&#x200B;

…

&#x200B;

…of *relevance*.

&#x200B;

It’s true what Kim was saying earlier, as well. His grandfather was a prominent Nazi. Vanished without a trace one day, there’s no record of his death; but he did work down here. At least for a time. That much is known.

One of the first recon teams down to this bunker recovered some old files. Manny’s grandfather was one of the listed names found within.

“You reckon we’ll find any bodies?” Blaine calls back over his shoulder, just a little too loud for the environment. I cringe, but Rudy replies, undeterred.

“I should think so. Might find myself a nice shiny Nazi skull to take home as a souvenir!”

We reach the metal double-doors at the end of the hall, and with a look round the group, Blaine presses his shoulder against them, and forces one open. We slip through the gap in formation, checking down the long, dark corridors that branch out before us and beside us- disappearing into the void on our left, and to our right.

“No”, Manny says, his voice echoing down between the walls. “The reports made no note of any bodies found, Nazi or otherwise. Whatever they were doing here… They didn’t stick around”.

“So then where did they go?” Szymon ponders aloud, arcing his weapon around as he steps into a deserted room nearby, perhaps once used for briefings or meetings. “They wouldn’t have just vanished into thin air”.

&#x200B;

“We *might* see a body”, Kim says.

The group looks at her. “A man was killed during the last expedition. A soldier. French, I think”.

&#x200B;

“Oh yeah”, Rudy mutters, rubbing his nose. “How’d that happen again? Freak accident, right?”

“Aye mate that’s right”, Blaine says. “That’s what I was talking about, really. Apparently the poor fucker got knocked clean cold by a falling pipe. Might have been a ceiling panel or something, actually, but whatever. The report read that he was face-down, and drowned in a puddle. When the rest of his team found him, they didn’t have the capacity to remove the fallen material, so they were forced to just leave him down here. Don’t believe he was ever recovered, since we’re the first guys to walk these corridors in over a decade”.

“They just left him down here?” Szymon asks. “That’s cold. Inhumane, almost”.

“I don’t think they had a choice, Sy”, Kim says, nudging his arm. “Maybe we’ll have to leave YOU down here!”

“Hey, not funny!” he says, but he chuckles as he does so.

&#x200B;

I’m not particularly amused, myself.

&#x200B;

To tell the truth, I feel sick.

Unless they’re hiding it better than we are, it’s possible that only Manny and myself are actually comprehending the weight of the monstrosity of this place.

The others haven’t really thought about it, I don’t think.

But we’re in one of six bunkers. This particular one is the easiest to reach, supposedly, so it’s the one that Command keep sending their teams to.

But something of this size… Something as massive as this, hidden away in the darkness at the bottom of the ocean. It’s hiding a secret. A terrible, frightening secret, and I don’t even know what it is.

The place is cold, and chills ripple across my exposed skin as I glance from left to right, peering into the shadows of the open doorways as we walk the length of the central corridor. Deeper into the middle of the complex.

Strategically, a bunker like this would be better off in the Mediterranean, surely. Shallower waters for easier construction. Positioned between Italy and Libya, for instance, for maximum tactical value.

But the Nazis took the time and trouble to construct it out here, in the Atlantic.

*And for what?*

Why would they do this?

Where did they go?

…And what exactly did they leave behind?

&#x200B;

Silence falls across the group.

There is no sound but the clamping of our boots. The long, low breaths of my comrades. Echoes, round the walls.

At the very edge of my hearing a noise shivers fast down the length of the hall. My heartrate quickens and my ears sharpen.

…The simple creak of an old structure, I should think… But it almost sounds like… *whispering*.

An almost-imperceptible whisper at the very threshold of sound.

It’s so faint, however, that I decide not bring it up, for fear of looking like an idiot, but I share another pointed look with Kim just beside me.

&#x200B;

She heard it too.

&#x200B;

Maybe the others did as well.

I glance to my left as Blaine pulls his mask up and around his nose and mouth.

Szymon crosses himself, and Manny rubs his forehead. I see that it is covered in beads of sweat.

&#x200B;

We press on.

&#x200B;

“We’ll head to the central room, then we split into teams of two”, Blaine says through his mask. “We get this bunker checked out, we reconvene”.

He’s met with murmurs of assent as we push through another set of double-doors – smaller this time – and step into some kind of lobby. Manny produces a map and unfolds it, and it becomes clear that this lobby will, if we continue, head through into the complex’s centre.

&#x200B;

We are halted however, by the strength of our own, sudden awe.

&#x200B;

We stand in the entrance to a wide room with a high, domed ceiling. The walls around us are covered- much to our surprise- in plaques and paintings, and in the room’s middle is a now-dead fountain, the centrepiece of which is a colossal statue, or series of statues, depending on your perspective.

I crane my neck, struck with disbelief.

The statue depicts three men, of varying age, with expressions solemn and eyes pure white. A long and fish-like serpent carved from the same foundation winds itself between and around them, way up towards the ceiling, its jaw wide and teeth sharp.

A dark, circular symbol can be seen on the foreheads of each of the three men, stark against the relative paleness of their stone skin.

“*Die Schwarze Sonne*”, Manny mutters, taking a step towards the statue. He is hauntingly small by comparison.

“The Black Sun”, Szymon repeats, staring up at the centrepiece with horror.

“What does it mean?” Rudy asks, glancing around the group. “And what the hell is this thing, anyways? It ain’t in the damned report! You’d think at least ONE of the teams would have mentioned seeing something like THIS”.

“The Black Sun was one of the many symbols utilised by the SS”, Manny replies, still staring up at the great statues. “It has been employed by many cultures, but, in this instance- it was the symbol of Wewelsburg castle”. He turns to us. “The dark home of the Nazi foray into the occult. Led by none other than Heinrich Himmler”.

“Nazi occultists?” Rudy responds. Then he puts out a hand and makes a dismissive gesture. “No, no come on. Don’t mess me with that supernatural bullshit again. We’re dealing with people, here. Just ordinary, evil people”. He shoots another look up to the statue of the three men, and the creature.

“…Well”, he falters. “Maybe not that ordinary. But you catch my drift”.

Szymon grunts and shakes his head. “Not ordinary. And not people. This place is the husk for a den of long-dead rats”.

“Look come on man, I get it, you hate Nazis. You aren’t alone in this. But open your EYES”. Rudy throws an arm out to the statues beside him. “You aren’t even a LITTLE impressed? Or at least, I don’t know… curious?”

Szymon scoffs, then walks away, turning his back to the statue as he continues his passage round the perimeter of the room.

I take another long look at the statue, then head around on its left-hand side, the opposite side to Szymon.

&#x200B;

I come up alongside Blaine, admiring a painting, and I stand beside him.

&#x200B;

I read a little plaque on the wall, one celebrating a visit made to this bunker by Himmler in 1941, and then I consider the painting.

It is housed in a frame of dark, rich wood, and is comprised of a host of grim, swirling colours.

&#x200B;

The scene, despite its lack of vibrancy, is vivid and powerful.

&#x200B;

It depicts a churning sea, and it almost feels as if I am there myself.

…And in a way, I am.

Here in this bunker, at the bottom of the ocean.

&#x200B;

The waves are grey and black and tinged with the darkest of blues, frothing angrily as they crash and cascade into and over each other. At the painting’s far left is the silhouette of a shadowed city of ruins, protruding faintly from the surging sea and lost behind the spiralling clouds overhead.

I am vaguely aware of a low conversation taking place between Szymon and Kim somewhere far behind me, but in the moment they are overwhelmed by the impossible roar of these silent waves.

A lighthouse stands at the far right of the painting. Its beacon is an eye, and the flash of painted gold looks out over the storm, and casts a lone, solemn beam towards the fallen city.

&#x200B;

The lighthouse, upon closer inspection, is comprised of bodies.

Hundreds and hundreds of broken bodies, intertwined with torturous new purpose.

&#x200B;

“It’s awful, isn’t it”, Blaine murmurs, and I am snapped back to reality with a blink.

“…Yes”, I reply after a beat. Glancing down to the little silver tag embedded in the painting’s frame.

&#x200B;

‘*Die Eintausend’*, it’s called.

&#x200B;

Or, in English:

‘The Thousand’.

“Awful”, I repeat, “but still…”

“Aye”, Blaine grunts. “It’s a quality painting”.

&#x200B;

There’s a pause.

&#x200B;

“Not something I’d ever hang up in my bloody bedroom, though, personally”.

&#x200B;

I chuckle drily, and we move on.

&#x200B;

Our footsteps are heavy against the concrete below.

“Rudy made a point just now”, I say out loud, as we walk. Blaine waits for me to continue.

“He said that the statue- this whole room, actually- it’s entirely omitted in the reports. This is meant to be an uninteresting, unassuming lobby. Instead it’s filled with intricate paintings and giant statues. Why wouldn’t this stuff have been mentioned?”

“Seems obvious to me, mate”, Blaine replies. “Because despite what Szymon says, this stuff *is* interesting. And when somebody finds something mysterious and interesting, everyone and their grandma wants to come and have a look”.

&#x200B;

He hoists his gun a little higher, clears his throat. “I’m guessin’ that this was all omitted because the recon teams decided they didn’t *want* people coming down here”.

&#x200B;

I swallow.

“And why would they do that, hm?” I ask him, rhetorically. “Why wouldn’t they want anyone else coming down. Why keep it all so cryptic and silent?”

Blaine shrugs. “Couldn’t say”.

“There’s something wrong down here”, I mutter. “I’m sure of it. Something very, very wrong, and every part of me hates this place”.

“Aye”, Blaine says. “I’ve started feeling a little like that myself. It’s getting worse, actually, the deeper in we go”.

I nod. “We’re going to find something terrible down here”, I finish, but to this Blaine says nothing.

Leaving the statues and the defunct fountain behind, we push through the doors at the hall’s opposite side, and head through into a long, wide room with two simple doors.

We are joined by the others.

The door on the left has a plaque that reads: “*Der Kontrollraum*”, and the door on the right is marked only with the same symbol on the foreheads of the stone giants.

…The Black Sun.

My stomach turns as I look upon it, and a wave of cold nausea passes through me.

My heartrate quickens, and I roll my shoulders, attempting to release some built-up tension.

&#x200B;

Manny brings a hand up to his head and gasps, and the group turns to him.

“Manny”, Kim says with concern. “Are you alright?”

Manny pats her hand, then steps away, a little closer to the ‘Kontrollraum’. “I keep seeing…” he falters. “I am seeing in my head what I can only describe as ‘flashes of memory’. But the memories are not mine”. He gestures to the Kontrollraum door.

“There is a man in there”, he says simply, then looks back at us. “A *dead* man, I believe”. He rubs the side of his forehead. “And I have also come to believe that I was wrong, earlier. I no longer think this place is entirely deserted”. He points to the door. “A man’s last memories are held behind that door”, then he strides towards it.

“Manny!” Rudy calls out, “wait!” But the man does not. He approaches and grabs the handle, swinging the door outwards into our corridor, and shines inside his beam of light. He steps into the room, and we follow him inside.

“Christ”, Blaine mutters as we enter. “I guess you found your Nazi skull, Rudy. Why don’t you go and grab it up”.

But Rudy doesn’t respond, he simply looks down at the sight before us.

A skeleton surrounded by dust and empty cans, slumped back in a chair against the wall. The bones are wrapped up in the threads of a Nazi uniform.

&#x200B;

“None of this shit is supposed to be down here”, Rudy says, eventually. “Why did Command keep all this stuff from us?”

“It’s not Command”, Blaine replies, echoing our earlier conversation. “It’s the recon teams. The recon teams write the reports”.

“So why emit all this?” Rudy says as he throws up his hands. “I don’t get it. This ain’t no ordinary bunker, and I think we’ve all realised that by now”.

Kim ignores him. “What is it, Manny?” she asks, as the man crouches down beside the skeleton.

Manny regards the remains of the Nazi. He looks to the brown, banded book on the desk beside him, and he considers the iron cross on the front of the uniform. A hint of a chain can be seen spilling from one of the front pockets, and Manny reaches over to take hold of it.

“Hey, should you be doing that?” Rudy asks, but Manny continues, and slowly draws from the uniform a golden locket, in the shape of an oak leaf. He turns it over in his hands.

“I know this man”, he says simply.

“What do you mean?” Kim asks.

“His name is Hans. He has a wife, and a young son. A son who was no older than eleven, or twelve, at his death”.

“I don’t suppose he’ll be that *young* any more, Manny”, Blaine grunts, giving the skeleton’s boot a light kick. A cloud of fine, white dust bursts out into the room. “I imagine he looks just his father here”.

Manny sets the locket on the desk, and Kim reaches out to open it up.

Inside is a picture of a square-jawed soldier with closely-cropped hair. Beside him is a woman, dressed in the style of the 1930s. The picture in the locket’s other half is of a young boy. The couple’s son, by the look of him.

“Jesus…” Rudy murmurs with dismay, looking from the pictures to Manny, and back. “Manny how did you know that?”

Manny stands back up with a small grunt, his legs creaking as he does, and he takes the journal on the desk up into his hands, and begins to carefully leaf through the pages.

“Even though it likely belonged to a monster of a man…” he begins, “I can never bring myself to be anything but gentle when it comes to books. I was instilled into me a deep respect for the written word”.

He cautiously turns to the very first page, and points to the name that has been written in the front margins.

‘*HANS*’, it reads.

“Yes”, Manny says quietly. “This is him”.

Szymon and Blaine have begun to rummage through the room. Searching through papers and charts and various records.

Most of the files have been emptied, and those that remain seem to detail only the structural side of the complex. Aspects of the engineering, and the architecture- though nothing can be found about the purpose of- or meaning behind- the intricate statues in the central lobby.

As Kim and Rudy and I talk lowly amongst ourselves, and as Manny begins to read through the journal, Szymon takes a little time to skim through a letter he finds amongst others, tucked away on a shelf.

He snorts and shakes his head, then holds the paper up for us. “Look, take a look at this”, he says, slapping the paper down onto the desk beside the skeleton. “Have a read”, he says, before jabbing his finger onto a couple of choice lines.

“This was written by the Nazi Command of the bunker”, he says. “By my guess. And it’s directed at our little rat ‘Hans’ here”.

“What is it?” asks Kim, as she leans over to read.

“It’s a promise. A false promise, that they will ‘return’ for him”, Szymon mutters. “A promise that his comrades will come back for him when they are able”.

“From where?” Blaine asks, and Szymon shrugs.

“It does not say. Does it matter? It was clearly a lie”. He kicks the legs of the skeleton a little harder than Blaine, and the skeleton slumps lower down in its chair, with another accompanying cloud of dust. “The Nazis clearly lied to him. He did his duty like a good little soldier and stayed behind to do God knows what… and they forgot all about him. And he died alone in his chair at the bottom of the sea. He got off lightly”.

Szymon grimaces and kicks the thigh of the skeleton as hard as he can, and with a shower of white mist the skeleton crumbles and collapses into a pile on the floor.

“Fuck’s sake, what’d you do that for?” Rudy splutters and coughs. “Idiot”.

“Don’t talk to me like that”, Szymon retorts, then leaves the room, shaking his head.

Manny waves a hand around his face, dispersing the dust, squinting as he scans the pages of the mysterious journal.

“Szymon’s guess seems to be correct”, he says, as he turns the pages of the journal. “This man’s job was to keep the power running. He was an engineer, and was- it would seem- tasked with repairing and maintaining the system. To prioritise where the energy should go”.

He points to passage written near the bottom of one of the pages.

“You can read this, Manny?” Rudy asks.

To his credit, the journal is written not only in German, but in intricate cursive.

Manny nods. “Of course”. He points again to the passage, and I do my best to read what is written as Manny continues: “Here he begins speaking about a necessary diversion of power, and how he dislikes how cold the bunker has become. He also makes references to fixing and repairing”.

“What kind of a guy was he?” Rudy asks.

Kim looks at him.

“You know”, Rudy says. “Beside being a Nazi”.

“He was full of pride”, Manny says as he carefully turns the pages. “It says he was one of several volunteers for this role. He was… happy to do his duty. It gave him purpose”.

We are quiet for a moment as Manny turns the pages.

“Hans expressed in this journal his excitement at being reunited with comrades. That despite the loneliness, he knew that they would return for him, when all was ready. That he too would see the truth. That he would keep the power going for as long as they needed-”

“Wait, hang on”, Blaine interrupts. “This guy kept the power on… for how long? And for what? Why exactly was he keeping this place active?”

There is pause, and Blaine looks around the room.
