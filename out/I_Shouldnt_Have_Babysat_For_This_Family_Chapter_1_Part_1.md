I sat on my sofa and  continued to scroll online, looking for some gigs to make some quick cash. I was recently fired from my job  and the danger of coming up short on rent was soon to  be  imminent. The scrolling was about to stop  when a post caught my eye.

“Looking for a babysitter that can work from 3-6 AM 7 days a week. Starting at $285/hr.”

*$285 an hour?*

It was shocking to see such an insanely high hourly pay rate, but  there was something off with this post. 

*What could the parents be  doing at those hours every single day, and why are they  paying a whopping $285?*

It was evident that there was a catch to this.  I clicked “Read more” on the post.

“Basically just the title. We live in the Beverly hills area and have some important business we must attend to each night at 3:00 AM. we are offering such high pay because I know the time is at an odd hour.” 

It was apparent this was a huge risk, but the promise of $285 an hour was too grand to ignore.   I clicked on the user's profile and sent them a direct message.

“Hey, I saw your post. I am interested in babysitting for your children. Could I get some more details?”

I placed my phone down on the couch and turned to face the television. It was difficult to focus on the television while anxiously wondering if the right decision was made by messaging that user. 

*DING*

The anxious pondering had been  interrupted when my phone got a notification from the user I had messaged just a minute earlier.

“Hi, thank you for sending me a message. This is Zachorio. I have a wife, Soryin, and two kids, Orvo,  age 6, and Fern, Age 10. We have reviewed every one who has sent us a message and we believe you are the best fit for this opportunity. Please meet us TONIGHT at 2:30 AM for your first night of Babysitting.  I will call you at 2:00 AM and tell you the address for our estate. Thank you, and have a good rest of your evening.”

Shivers ran through me once I was done reading the message. The unusual names were off-putting,  as well as  the fact that they expected me to start the very same night.  I double checked the post, it had been posted just 2 minutes  ago.  It  seemed unlikely that anyone messaged them before me. 

After a few minutes of considering the decision, I came to the conclusion that I was just being paranoid and that these were most likely just some odd rich parents who had some sketchy business to attend to.  I picked up my phone and typed out a message. 

“Okay, sounds good!”

The message instantly said “Seen”.  

*Hm, that’s strange. Has he just been sitting in the conversation this whole time?*

I re-assured myself that I was just being paranoid and that I had nothing to worry about.  It was only 8:30 PM, so there was some time to kill.  the next few hours were spent watching television and biting my nails clean from the anxiety. the gut feeling that this was a bad idea wouldn’t leave, but I repeatedly pushed the thought away and focused on the grand promise of $285 dollars an hour. As an attempt to keep my focus on the money, a little bit of math was done. 

*$285 an hour would equal $855 a day, $5,985 a week, and $312,075 a year!* 

I  sat in awe at the numbers and was no longer anxious,  instead,  full of pure excitement about this amazing opportunity. The time was now 1:50 AM , meaning he was going to call me in 10 minutes.  After getting dressed  I sat back down and anxiously awaited his phone call. 

The clock hit 2:00 am and instantly after that Zachorio was calling me. 

“Hello!” I said.

“Hi, Mark Barlowe.” an older sounding man replied in a deep tone.

The use of my full name was very strange. Of course he could see my full name on my profile of the social media site we were using, but still, no normal person would address  someone by their full name on a first phone call.  

“Hi, how are you doing tonight?” I asked.

After 5 seconds, there was no answer, only static. I began to bite my nails.

“What are you speaking of? I am not doing anything to anyone or anything that goes by the name of ‘tonight’. I am slightly offended by such an accusation, but seeing as we have determined you are the best fit for this opportunity, I will let it slide. But this is your only warning.” Zachorio replied, sounding unusually distraught. 

*What on earth is this guy rambling on about? Is he fucking insane?*

“My apologies sir, I was just asking if your night was going pleasant.” I replied, trying to keep my cool.

“Ah, I see. My night is going very pleasant, per usual,” Zachorio replied.

He gave me the address for the home and ended the phone call. 

my hand was turning the front door handle,  but paused. I realized just how foolish it would be to go to an insane sounding man's house without a weapon. 

My room contained a handgun, so I quickly walked in and grabbed it. 

I entered my old rundown Nissan and entered the home address into my phone. 

*The address was written down perfectly, why isn’t anything showing up?*

“Hey, nothing is coming up when I enter the address on my phone.” I hit send, and my message instantly had “Seen” under it once more. Just as quickly after, a message from Zachorio appeared, without the typing bubble  even making an appearance.  

“I  will shine a large beacon starting now.”

The message brought on a confused daze.  I looked up and saw a large blue beacon shining into the night sky.

“What.. the.. Fuck..” I muttered to myself in awe.

The keys in the ignition were turned and the drive towards the beacon began.  Focusing on the road became increasingly difficult as the journey to the beacon came closer and closer to an end. 

After a while of driving, I approached the beacon and slowed the car to a crawl in front of it.  The beacon suddenly shut off and the  headlights illuminated a very tall middle aged man. The way he stood was very stiff and unusual. 

I exited my car and walked towards him.

“Hi, this is mark.” I said to the man.

“Oh yes,  we have been expecting you. Please come right in.” he said in what sounded like a sarcastic  tone while gesturing to the dirt beneath us.

Looking around, it was evident that we were in the middle of a dirt patch with no property in sight.  

“Shit.” I muttered under my breath, realizing this had clearly been a trap. 

Zachorio began to walk towards me and I placed my hand on my firearm in case he tried to pull anything. The grip strengthened when he was right next to me, but loosened when he continued to calmly walk past me. he was bent over and pulling something. He grunted as he continued to pull, and a large bunker door revealed itself from under the dirt. 

At that point there was no doubt in my mind that this whole situation was incredibly bizarre, but I felt a sense of safety from carrying the handgun. The bunker led into a beautifully decorated living room. My nerves began to act up and I entered an unwelcome state of hesitancy. 

“Well, what are you waiting for?” Zachorio asked after a few minutes of my hesitancy. 

“U-uh nothing. Are your children awake right now?” I asked.

“Yes, they are in the playroom on the 6th floor. That is where you will be going tonight.” Zachorio responded. 

*How many floors does this place have?*

“Okay! Well, don’t you have some business to attend to?” I asked. 

He put his watch up to his face.

“Not for 30 more minutes. Why are you in such a rush for me to leave?” He asked me. I could detect a strong hint of anger in his voice. 

I took a step back.

“I’m not! I-.. I was just wondering!” I replied before letting out a nervous laugh. 

“Okay. Well, I asked you to be here 30 minutes early because I am going to watch your performance of babysitting my children for 30 minutes.” 

My heart skipped a beat when I imagined the scene of awkwardly babysitting his children whilst he creepily watched me do so in a corner. 

“Okay.” I replied. 

I gulped down my fear and started down the stairs. Each step creaked in a way that indicated they hadn’t been stepped on for a long while. After reaching the bottom of the stairs, I paused to take in the view. The room was rich with sleek white furniture, each piece looking as if it had never once been used. 

“Go on now, down the next flight of stairs.” Zachroio instructed, sounding angry. 

“Yes sir.” I replied.

After turning to the left and going down the next flight of stairs, I stopped to take in the view once more. The room was completely identical to the last one.

*Another identical living room? What the hell is this place?*

“So.. you guys really like living, huh?” I said with a chuckle, trying to crack a joke. 

“Why are you accusing me of such things? Stop, and hurry down the stairs!” Zachorio Retorted.

*Okay, something is SERIOUSLY wrong with this guy..*

After going down the next 3 identical  floors, I paused. 

“So, your children are on that floor below?” I asked, pointing to the next staircase 

“I shall not answer that; you already know the answer.” Zachorio snapped back. 

*Did this guy live in a basement his whole life or something?*

After reaching the bottom of the stairs, I closed my eyes,  desperately hoping that two children would actually be in front of me upon opening them.  My eyes slowly opened, revealing the peculiar scene of two  children, sitting unusually upright and tense, staring at a dinky pet toy beneath them. 

“Hi! I am Mark. I’ll be your babysitter for tonight.” I explained to the children. 

There was no response. They continued to intently stare at  the toy on the ground. I looked around and realized that this room was also identical to all of the others, and that this was the bottom floor. 

Upon turning around, the view of  Zachorio  tensely standing against the wall, observing me, became apparent. 

I took a seat on the sofa.

“So, you guys wanna do anything?” I asked the kids.

Once again, there was no response of any kind from the children. 

I turned to face Zachorio, looking for some kind of advice. After a few seconds of staring, no help was given. 

“Is there anything in particular that you would like me to do?” I asked Zachorio.

Fear overwhelmed me when  his face suddenly became intensely red with anger. 

“*THAT IS YOUR JOB TO FIGURE OUT!!”* Zachorio belched deafeningly. 

“Sir! I-I  am very sorry. I- was just..”  I started

“*DO NOT COME UP WITH EXCUSES!”* Zachorio retorted just before beginning to swiftly walk in my direction. 

Panic and fear washed over me, causing me to pull out my handgun and aim it directly at him.

“BACK OFF!” I screamed, trying my best to sound and appear intimidating. 

He didn’t stop.

“I *SAID* BACK. OFF!” I screamed once more, becoming increasingly anxious as he came closer.

After he got dangerously close to me, I closed my eyes and shakily pulled the trigger. 

*CLINK* 

My eyes opened and were met with the horrifying scene of Zachorio continuing to effortlessly walk towards me. There was a damaged bullet on the ground just behind him. 

I shot the gun at him once more, watching as the bullet instantly  ricocheted off him and leaving no damage. 

*Shit!*

Zachorio grunted as he easily picked me up and carried me above his head. I struggled and screamed as he carried me to the other side of the room. He switched to carrying me with one hand, and used the other hand to push the bookshelf in the room aside, revealing a secret metal door. He opened the door, revealing a completely empty room that was entirely covered in metal. I screamed in pain after being forcefully thrown onto the ground of the room.

“YOU ARE FIRED!” Zachorio screamed just before slamming the door shut. 

I scurried to my feet and ran to the door. 

“LET ME OUT!!” I screamed while relentlessly banging on the door until my knuckles bled.

I started to shoot my gun at the door, but felt absolutely defeated as each bullet  effortlessly ricocheted off the wall, leaving not even the tiniest crack. 

“*AUGH!”* I yelped when one of the bullets hit my hand. Blood began to stream down, and fast. Out of sheer panic, I took off my shirt and tied it around the wound the best I could. 

“PLEASE I AM BLEEDING YOU HAVE TO LET ME OUT!!”  I screamed, desperately hoping that he would believe me.

“You say that you are bleeding?” Zachroio called out, sounding slightly excited. 

“YES! PLEASE HELP ME!” I cried out, but wished I hadn’t after noticing his excitement. 

Footsteps started in the direction of the door, and eventually it began to unlock. The door opened, revealing Zachorio. Something was awfully different about him, though. He was wearing the most incomprehensible and bizarre clothes I had ever seen, and he was holding a metal cup.

“*ORVO! FERN! EMOC EREH SIHT TNATSNI!”* Zachorio shouted to his children in a never before heard language. 

His children instantly replied by standing up and staying still right next to him. Suddenly, their eyes all began to glow a dark red. 

*If this isn’t a dream, I don’t know what is.*

Zachorio and his children charged towards me at a rapid pace. I tried to grab my phone to call the police, but  before I knew it, I was laying on the ground, paralyzed, and  Zachorio and his children were all gathered next to me. Zachorio was holding my phone over me, as if to taunt me before throwing it at the wall, causing it to completely crumple in on itself. I cried as I stared at my only lifeline laying on the ground, completely broken beyond repair. 

I stared in horror as Zachorio’s glowing red eyes stared deeply into mine as his tongue involuntarily jerked in random directions out of his mouth, almost like a broken reptile of sorts. The last thing I remember was turning to the right and seeing the gut-wrenching scene of Orvo and Fern looking extremely giddy while collecting my  blood into their metal  cup.

I awoke some time later on the cold metal floor, feeling extremely lightheaded. I wanted to get up, but my stomach was threatening to empty itself. I slowly moved my eyes, scanning the room, only seeing the cold metal ceiling which was identical to the floor.  After a few minutes, I had gained the courage to sit up. My hand had a carefully and perfectly placed bandage on it. Upon looking at my hand, it began to ache incredibly.

I struggled to my feet and looked around the room, the only thing that was new was a metal table which upon further inspection contained a bunch of your run of the mill medical supplies. I looked at a medicine bottle labeled “IBUPROFEN.” After glancing at the bottle, and then my hand, I settled on swallowing two tablets. I jumped when footsteps started in the direction of the door. The footsteps were none other than Zachorios. The door creaked open, revealing the sickening sight of Zachorio wheeling in a hospital bed that was attached to health monitoring devices. 

“Hey, what's going on?” I asked shakily with paranoia overwhelming me. 

*“SILENCE!”* Zachorio screamed, causing me to flinch and began to cry.

I began to hyperventilate from pure fear and panic, the reality of the situation was just too extreme for my mind to comprehend properly.  Everything began to blur, and it felt like an extreme struggle just to  breathe.

“ORVO, FERN! TNATSNI SIHT NAM EHT NO SISYLARAP ECUDNI!” Zachorio instructed his children. 

*What is that language? It sounds like English, but it also doesn't…*

Zachorios children appeared  within an instant. Their faces were hauntingly expressionless, almost as if they were deceased. The red, uncanny glow returned in the childrens and Zachorios' eyes.

Zachorio and his children began to slowly walk towards me. As I started to step backwards, a slight smirk formed on their faces. After a few more steps, their smirks had increased to an insanely wide and gaping smile. Eventually they had completely cornered me, and  absolute terror enveloped every atom inside of me. 

“PLEASE STOP!” I begged.

“PLEASE, *STOP!”*  I repeated, this time sobbing.

They didn’t stop. Second by second, they were growing increasingly closer to me. I covered my head with my arms and slid down the wall onto the floor.  It was becoming too much, I desperately craved for *everything* to stop. Even death seemed better than the incomprehensible fate I was due to endure shortly.  I slowly removed my arms from my head, and was met with the sickening sight of Zachorio and his children reaching their hands out to me with impossibly wide smiles.

My life began to flash before my eyes as I truly believed that I would die. I felt pure and total regret for the foolish, *foolish* decision of not listening to my gut.  Suddenly, I felt the cruel sensation of  six incredibly cold hands touching me.

“SISYLARAP ECUDNI!” they all chanted at once. 

A scream attempted to escape from me when I felt a jolting shock, but nothing came out. I continued to try and scream but to no avail. I then tried to move my legs, but there were none to move. It was then I realized there was *nothing* for me to move.  It felt as if I were nothing but a ball of consciousness in an eternal black void.  In an instant, I regained my sight. The colors were too bright for me to process for a few moments. I fell into a confused  and terror filled daze when  I was finally able to fully process the scene. 

I was laying on a bed, looking up into a small mirror. The mirror contained the view of Orvo and Fern appearing to get ready to make an incision in my head.  I tried to move, but I was still unable. Zachorio was holding a bright green squirming insect with some tweezers, examining it carefully.   

“Orvo, Fern, erom ecno ti ecudni .kcab thgis dna gniraeh sih  sah ydaerla eh .ffo gniraew ylwols si sisylaraP”  Zachorio calmly instructed to his children

I craved to understand the bizarre language that he spoke.

Orvo and Fern brought their hands into view, and they began to slowly creep closer and closer to me. It was almost as if they got  an amusement out of making the experience as slow and as fear inducing as possible. I wasn’t scared anymore, though; going back into that black void sounded a million times better than staying here. Able to hear and see, but not being able to do anything about it.  

The children's hand touched me, and unexpectedly, my movement fully returned. I instantly shot up in the hospital bed and took in huge lungfuls of oxygen. Zachorio looked furious, and his children looked remorseful, as if they knew they had done something wrong and were fearful of the punishment they would receive.  

I jumped out of the bed but was instantly grabbed by Zachorio.  I struggled and screamed as his arms tightened around me, making it incredibly difficult to breathe. Eventually , I felt totally and utterly defeated. I stopped screaming and struggling, and immediately after, Zachorio screamed in distress and dropped me to the ground, almost as if me being calm physically pained him.

*Did I just figure out his weakness?*

I slowly and calmly got to my feet while Zachorio grew a frustrated look on his face. I walked over to Zachorio and calmly tapped his shoulder, resulting in him being hurled across the room and slammed into the wall. He groaned in pain and yelled profanities at me.

*His weakness is calmness!* 

Remaining calm, i walked over to the hospital bed and looked down at a notebook titled 

“seiduts revo ekaT”

*These are english letters, but what are those words?*

After minutes of staring at the book, my brain clicked. 

*It’s in reverse! That’s the language he was speaking, too!* 

I read the notebook title backwards and sounded it out.

“Take…Over…Studies. Take over studies!” 

I heard a door open and turned to see Zachorio limping out of the door and then ran up the stairs, his children following shortly after. 

I flipped open the notebook and translated the first page from reverse.

“*DAY 1*

*I have officially lured two children into my trap. I have named them Orvo and Fern.”*

I flipped to the next page.

“*DAY 2*

*I have officially given Orvo and Fern the parasitic implant procedure. The procedure was successful. They now possess the powers and cravings necessary to aid me on my journey. They listen to commands well.”*

My mouth began to gape open in shock, and I turned to the next page. 

“*DAY 3*

*I have successfully lured an adult into my trap. He is resting in the surgery. I plan to give him the Parasitic implant procedure shortly.  So long he stays in distress, he has no power over me.”*

The next page was empty. That last line had confirmed my suspicion: his weakness was calmness.

*Is this guy an alien?*

I was incredibly  stupefied after reading the  notebook. My mind was struggling to grasp the fact that this was somehow reality.  My mind was racing with questions.

*What is “Parasitic implant surgery”?  Is that what was about to happen to me?*

*Did his children, or should I say his victims, intentionally set me free? Do they have any humanity left?* 

*What do I do after this? Do I just leave and go on with my life?*

*Will the police even believe such an absurd story?*

I grabbed the notebook and left the room, being invisibly cautious of Zachorios whereabouts. I scanned each room as I went up them, breathing a sigh of relief each time  I didn't see him. After making it to the exit of the bunker, I breathed the biggest sigh of relief possible. Upon looking around, it was evident that it was nighttime, although it’s very unlikely it was the same night that i had arrived there.

My mind finally had some time to process the situation, and I collapsed onto my knees and broke down in tears. 

I felt hopeless; I didn't know who or where to go for help, and I also hadn’t a clue where Zachorio had gone off too.  After minutes of crying on the dirt floor,  I realized that it wouldn’t benefit me to do it for any longer. After getting on my feet I walked to my car and hopped in. I banged on the wheel and screamed in frustration when I remembered I didn't have my keys, and also didn’t have a clue where they were. 

I took a look around and a severe sense of isolation washed over me when the reality of my location set in. 

I figured my only option was walking until I found someone that would let me borrow their phone to call an uber, or walk until I found a taxi. The city's lights were ahead of me and I began to walk in their direction. I walked briskly, trying to focus on my surroundings and not the traumatic experience I had just undergone.  After around 20 minutes of walking, severe hunger began to kick in, making it even more likely it was not the same night it was when I had arrived at Zachorios bunker. 

*How long was I there? 1 day? 2 days…? …3 days?!*

I groaned from the hunger pains, but continued walking.  After another half hour of walking, I had finally made it onto the city streets. Looking around, it was clear the night was still young; many people were driving and walking the streets, some with children, this made my chances of finding a taxi a lot easier.  I asked around a dozen people if I could borrow their phone, they all said no, and rightfully so. I know that if I were walking the streets of Los Angeles and someone asked to borrow my phone, I would automatically assume they have ill intent! 

Finally, after hours of roaming the streets, I saw a Taxi. After waving my hand up high, the taxi pulled over. 

After stepping into the vehicle and telling the driver the address, we were on our way. I stared out the window, staring at the city lights, pondering about the incident. 

After a while of driving, I had finally made it to my destination and ran into my house. I opened the fridge and stuffed my face with random foods, all of it tasting delicious to my famished stomach. After being done with stuffing my face, I called the police from my landline and explained the story to them in a more believable manner. I obviously didn’t include the parts about bullets ricocheting off of him and whatnot, just the main details. 

I sat down on my couch and opened up my laptop, and started typing this. I am totally and utterly traumatized from this incident, but I unfortunately suspect this will not be the end of Zachorio and I’s story… I will update if anything else happens.
