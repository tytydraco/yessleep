I’m typing this in my room with the blinds open and every light on, and it still feels like the dark in here is thicker than it should be.

My friend’s face is stuck in the last frame of a video I can’t make myself delete.

If you live near Fairview, you’ve probably heard of Parkland Corporate Center. It’s the half-finished office park off I-27, just past the shuttered Shell station and the dark Staples sign near the Tractor Supply. Three buildings, two stories each, all glass and concrete in a crooked U around a parking lot that’s slowly turning back into a field.

The sign by the road still says:

PARKLAND CORPORATE CENTER
LEASING INQUIRIES: 555-0189

I called that number once on a dare. It plays a recorded voice that says “A leasing agent will be avail—” and then just cuts out. No beep, no menu, nothing. It’s been like that for years.

They started building Parkland before the 2008 crash and just… stopped. The county threw up a sagging chain across the entrance and a NO TRESPASSING sign on one post. That’s the extent of security.

Everyone just calls it Parkland.

Everyone says not to go there at night.

We went anyway.

There were three of us: me (Caleb), Mason, and Tyler.

We’re not “urban explorer” people with channels or merch. We’re just idiots who get bored and decide that driving to empty places with flashlights beats another night of yelling at each other in Discord.

We’d been to Parkland twice before, both times in the afternoon. Creepy, yeah, but bearable with sunlight coming through the glass and traffic noise drifting in from the highway.

This time was different.

Mason brought it up at lunch. He dropped his tray down across from me and Tyler, grinning the way he does when he knows he’s about to say something dumb and try to sell it as fun.

“Night run,” he said. “Parkland. Tonight.”

Tyler poked at his fries. “We already did Parkland,” he said. “It was just carpet and sad office chairs.”

“At three in the afternoon,” Mason said. “You know how many jump scares happen at three in the afternoon? Zero. You’ve gotta see it in the dark.”

He talks with his hands, like he’s always mid-story. Teachers like him even when he’s late. He gets away with stuff.

“My mom’s on closing shift at Kroger tonight,” I said. “She won’t be home until eleven. If I text her that I’m at your house, she won’t check.”

Tyler looked between us for a second.

“My parents are on nights. Again,” he said. “I just have to be home before school. But we stick together this time. No leaving anybody in creepy bathrooms, I’m not playing that game again.”

Mason put a hand over his heart. “Scout’s honor. I was never a scout, but still.”

We met up in my driveway around nine. October air, cold enough to see your breath if you exhaled hard. Street was quiet except for one dog barking down the block.

Mason’s Civic is an ’09 silver with a crack in the windshield he hides under a parking permit. There’s an I BRAKE FOR NOBODY sticker peeling off his bumper that he thinks is way funnier than it is.

Tyler got in the front with this big black Maglite between his knees. I took the back.

“You bring your light?” Mason asked me, backing out.

“Yeah,” I said, tapping my pocket. Little LED on my keys. “You bring bolt cutters?”

He snorted. “You think I have bolt-cutter money? Nah. Chain’s low. I checked.”

I believe him, because that’s the kind of thing he actually does.

We rolled past the closed Starbucks and the 24-hour CVS on Maple, then hit the on-ramp. The radio was down low, someone talking about used trucks. I watched the green exit signs go by: 25, 26, 27.

Mason took Exit 27. Instead of heading right toward the strip with Tractor Supply and the empty Staples, he turned left, down the darker road that passes fields and one lonely sodium streetlight humming like a bug zapper.

“Ty, you know people say someone died out there, right?” he said, because of course he did.

“People say someone died everywhere,” Tyler said, not looking up from his phone. “There’s probably a guy on Reddit right now writing, ‘I Worked the Graveyard Shift at CVS. The Pills Weren’t the Scariest Thing.’”

“He’d get, like, five thousand upvotes,” I said.

We laughed. It came out thin.

The Parkland sign appeared on the right, half-covered by branches. Our headlights lit the blue logo and the dead number, then it slid by and we turned in at the next gap.

The road changed under us as soon as we left the highway shoulder. Smooth asphalt became cracked pavement with grass spearing through. The chain across the entrance sagged between two concrete posts, a rusted padlock hanging from one side like an earring.

“Security theater,” Mason said. He stopped, got out, and lifted the chain. It scraped across the hood. I ducked even though I was inside.

“A little higher,” I said.

“Yeah, yeah.”

He eased the car under. Once we were past, he dropped the chain behind us. It clanged off the bumper and settled somewhere in the weeds.

The lot swallowed us up.

It was darker in there than I expected. The trees along the road block most of the town glow, so once you’re inside, it’s just our headlights and black glass and concrete.

Building A was straight ahead. B and C angled off, making that crooked U. Their fronts were mostly glass, some of it smashed. Graffiti covered the doors and lower panels: white tags, silver crowns, and a few detailed red things that looked like someone had practiced drawing organs.

Mason killed the headlights but let the engine idle for a second. The world outside the car turned into shapes and reflections.

“No turning them back on and flooring it just to freak us out,” Tyler said, pre-emptively.

“I’m saving the battery,” Mason said. After a beat, he shut the engine off. The ticking of the cooling engine sounded too loud.

Ty clicked on the Maglite. The beam cut across the lot—cracked parking lines, strong grass, Building A’s front steps. The glass doors had aluminum push bars. One pane was cracked through, the other intact but buried under spray paint.

“Fifteen minutes,” Tyler said. “In and out.”

“We drove all the way out here for fifteen minutes?” Mason said.

“It was boring in the day,” Tyler said. “We’re not camping inside.”

“Twenty,” Mason tried.

“Seventeen,” I said. “Split it.”

He rolled his eyes. “Seventeen minutes of terror. Let’s go.”

I was the last one out. When the dome light clicked off, the dark pushed in immediately.

Tyler swung the Maglite up toward the front of the building—and caught something in a second-floor window.

I stopped walking.

“What?” he asked.

“I thought I saw… somebody up there,” I said, pointing at the far-right window.

All three of us looked up.

Just our stretched reflections looked back: three figures and the white beam, the Civic behind us.

“Maybe don’t start with that,” Mason said. But he checked the window one more time before turning away.

He pulled one of the glass doors. It creaked, but opened. No alarm, no emergency lights. Just a dead lobby smell.

Inside, the air was thicker. Damp carpet, old dust, something sour underneath, like maybe a drain had been backing up somewhere for a decade. There was a fake fern in a corner, its leaves gray under a skin of dust. A reception desk sat with its monitor smashed in.

Our footsteps echoed up into the second floor.

“Kill the light for a sec,” Mason said.

Tyler did.

Instant difference. Without the beam, you notice how little ambient light is actually getting in. Just a faint glow from the glass behind us and some ghost rectangles where windows must be upstairs. The building had its own little noises: a drip somewhere, a distant crack.

“Okay, no,” Tyler said, snapping the Maglite back on.

The beam jumped, and that’s when we noticed the white powder on the floor near the base of the stairs.

Someone had emptied a fire extinguisher across the tiles since we’d last been here. A dusting of white spread in a fan shape.

Footprints went straight through it.

I don’t know how we missed them at first. Once you see them, they’re all you see.

They were long. Too long. Narrow heel, deep arch, and at the front, four thick ovals, each one ending in a deeper pit like something had dug in.

“Dog?” I said, even though I knew better.

“Dogs have five toes and pads,” Tyler said, quietly. “And their tracks don’t look like they’ve been… punched in.”

“Fake shoe,” Mason said. He crouched, smeared a little of the powder away with the back of his fingers. The dust moved. The depth of the indent didn’t. “Like, some idiot made a monster boot to freak people out.”

“Then why walk in a straight line and peace out?” Tyler asked. He was right. The prints came from the doors, clean through the powder, and headed toward the elevator lobby and the stairs. No wandering, no pacing.

They disappeared where the light fell off.

“Up?” Mason said.

“We’re sticking together,” Tyler reminded him.

“We are,” Mason said. “We just… stick together upstairs and then stick together out. I don’t love the idea of walking back across that.”

He wasn’t wrong. I didn’t want to be between those prints and the only exit either.

We went up.

The second floor always felt like time had stopped mid-sentence.

Downstairs was empty space. Up here, it felt like everyone had just stood up and walked away at once. Desks, some with family photos facedown under a fuzz of dust. Swivel chairs, a few rolled out into the middle of the floor like someone had pushed away from their computer too hard. Whiteboards with half-erased bullet points: Q3 TARGETS, CLIENT PUSHBACK, ONBOARDING. The calendar by the stairwell stopped at August 2009. Tuesday the 18th was circled.

A dry-erase marker lay on the whiteboard’s metal tray, cap off, tip dried to nothing. Someone had drawn a smiley face next to the word TEAM.

Tyler’s beam slid over all of that, then down to the carpet.

The prints were up here too. Same long, four-toed shape pressed into the old gray fibers, marching down the main hall.

The air had that attic heaviness. Like dust had a weight now.

We passed an office with a nameplate: C. BURTON – HR. Inside, a mug that said WORLD’S OKAYEST BOSS was on its side, something green and furry blooming out of it. There was a “SAFETY FIRST – 1,234 DAYS WITHOUT INCIDENT” poster on the wall. Somebody had written LIARS across it in ballpoint pen.

“You ever think about how nobody came back for their mugs?” Tyler said quietly. “Or their pictures?”

“They probably boxed it all up one day and dumped it in storage,” Mason said. He sounded like he was repeating something he’d read online.

We were stalling. The prints kept going.

The hallway narrowed as we turned a corner, ceiling lower, EXIT signs hanging dead and crooked. The emergency stairs were at the end: red metal door, narrow glass window.

In daylight, it had just been a door.

Now it felt like a closed throat.

Tyler swung the Maglite down the hall and stopped.

Something was in front of the door.

At first it was just a vertical strip of darker dark, like a piece of the hallway had thickened. Tall. Hunched a little. For a second I thought it might be some abandoned coat rack or a plant we never noticed.

Then it shifted its weight. Not much. Just enough that the beam picked up the side of something pale.

Tyler inhaled sharply and snapped the light toward it.

Nothing.

The hallway was empty. Just the door and the dust.

“Tell me you saw that,” he whispered.

“Yeah,” I said.

Mason stared down at the door. “Glass,” he said, more to himself than to us. “Reflection. Look.”

We walked a few more steps. The prints led right up to the push bar, then doubled back, like whatever made them had stood there a while and then decided to go elsewhere.

The glass showed us the way glass is supposed to: three pale faces, one bright circle of light.

We watched ourselves for a few seconds.

Something hit the door from the other side.

Not full-force. Just a sharp thump that made the metal shudder and the push bar rattle.

Tyler jumped back into me. The beam flared across the ceiling.

“What was that?” he asked. His voice had gone thin.

“Wind on the stairs,” Mason said immediately, which didn’t explain anything. “Or… or something fell.”

The second hit was harder. The hollow clang rattled through the frame.

Then I heard it: a sound right against the glass, muffled but close. Not words. Just a slow, heavy exhale, the kind you can feel in your own throat when someone does it near your ear.

We didn’t stand there debating.

Mason grabbed Tyler’s sleeve. “Back down,” he said. “Now.”

We went back the way we came, way faster. The hall felt longer. The cone of light shook and picked out details we’d missed—an office chair turned perfectly to face the door, a phone receiver dangling off a desk, a brown handprint-shaped stain low on the wall that I hope was coffee and will never know for sure.

Halfway to the stairs, the Maglite beam hit a doorway.

There was a small office inside. Bare desk, rolling chair, file cabinet with one drawer half-open.

Something was behind the door.

I didn’t see all of it. Just enough through the gap to know it wasn’t a trick of light. Four long fingers wrapped around the wood, pressing into it. They flexed once—smooth, no hesitation—and slipped back out of sight.

My feet stopped by themselves.

“Caleb,” Tyler hissed. “Move.”

I did. I didn’t look back in.

At the stairs, I almost expected the powder to be exactly the same. It wasn’t.

The original prints were still there, but now there were more. Newer. Edges clearer. They led from the lobby toward the stairwell, overlapped some of our shoe marks, and stopped on the lowest step, just to the left of where my foot came down.

We all froze.

The surface of the powder shifted.

Not from us. We hadn’t moved.

A thin line appeared in the dust, like something invisible dragging a fingertip through it. It curved, looped, then straightened.

Letters.

Not neat. But readable.

NO

Tyler made a noise that was half-laugh, half-whimper.

“Okay,” Mason said. His voice was too loud in the stairwell. “Nope. Fine. Upstairs. Window. We are not walking through that lobby.”

The Maglite flickered.

Once.

Twice.

Then it cut out completely.

Everything went black. No slow fade. Just there one second, gone the next.

I heard Tyler slam the flashlight against the railing. “Come on. Come on.”

No light.

My fingers were already on my phone. I mashed the side button. The screen lit up in my face, bluish and harsh.

Battery: 14%.

I know it had been over 60% when we parked. I check my battery all the time. It’s a habit.

“Up,” Mason said. The dragging sound from the lobby came again, closer now, wet and steady. “Go.”

We went up.

Back on the second floor, my phone turned the hallway into a narrow, jittery tunnel. Beyond it, everything was just shape and suggestion.

“Conference room,” Tyler said. “Big window, faces the lot. We can jump.”

We’d joked about that window the last time we were here. “Emergency exit if the elevator ghosts get mad,” Mason had said. It hadn’t been funny then either.

I kept the phone angled down toward our feet. I didn’t want to see what might be standing ahead of us until I had to.

We passed more offices. My light caught on little things—the blinking red LED on an emergency exit sign that somehow still had power, a pen stuck point-first into a corkboard, a ring of something crusted on the carpet like a cup had been dropped there and never cleaned up.

Something moved behind one of the glass walls at the edge of the light. I saw it in my peripheral vision and refused to turn my head. If I didn’t give it my full attention, part of me could pretend it wasn’t there.

The conference room door was half-open. Tyler shoved it in and we crowded inside.

Long table. Twelve chairs. Whiteboard with PIPELINE and STRATEGY ghosts still faintly there. A dry marker lay on the tray, drowned in gray dust.

The window filled almost the whole far wall. From here, the parking lot looked flat and small. The Civic was a dark chunk in the darkness. The chain at the entrance was a faint line.

For about half a second, that view helped. Then the dragging sound out in the hall scraped a little closer.

Mason went to the window. There was a latch at the top. He worked it loose and pushed. The glass moved outward a few inches and stopped against some ancient limiter.

“Of course,” he muttered.

“Break it,” Tyler said.

Mason dragged one of the chairs over, metal legs screeching on the floor. “Stand back.”

He swung the chair into the glass. The boom made my ears ring. Cracks spidered out, but the pane held.

“Again,” Tyler said. He kept looking back at the door.

The dragging outside paused. Then started again, slower.

On the third hit, the glass gave. It blew outward in a shower of shards. Some fell in, some fell out. Cold air rushed in, tasting like wet weeds, asphalt, and something metal.

Mason kicked at the remaining jagged pieces, knocking them loose. Tiny fragments tinkled down to the bushes below.

“Feet first,” he said. “Story and a half. Bend your knees. I’ll go first.”

My phone buzzed in my hand.

A banner flashed at the top: New Voicemail – Unknown.

I stuffed the phone into my hoodie pocket.

Mason climbed onto the sill, one leg out. He looked back at us once. His pupils were huge.

“Don’t look down,” Tyler said.

“Already did,” Mason said, and went. The bushes rustled. “I’m good. Go.”

Tyler climbed up next. “If I break my ankle—” he started, then just dropped. There was a thump and a muted, “Ow. I’m fine. Caleb.”

The scraping outside the conference room door stopped.

I didn’t look at it.

I hauled myself up onto the sill. Broken glass scratched my shin. I felt warmth spread under my jeans, but there was no time to care.

My phone vibrated again as I pushed off.

Branches hit my sides. Then ground. I rolled, came up, and saw the Civic.

“Run!” Mason yelled.

We ran.

We tore across the lot, tripping, pushing off each other, not even pretending to be coordinated. Gravel slid out under my shoes. The air felt too cold in my throat.

Something hit the building behind us. A deep impact. Dust puffed off the top edge of the wall. Another hit followed, lower down, closer.

Tyler reached the car first and yanked the back door open. We piled in. Mason nearly dropped the keys, but got them in the ignition. The engine coughed and then roared.

Headlights flared on.

They swept across Building A, across the broken second-floor window.

For one long second, I saw fingers hooked over the cracked frame from the inside. Four of them. Gray-white, too long, joints bent in ways they shouldn’t bend. They tightened as the light hit them.

A face leaned into the light behind them.

Eyes with no pupils, just cloudy white. Skin that looked thin and stretched. A mouth that opened too far, full of teeth that didn’t match each other, like they’d been stolen from different jaws.

Then the car whipped around, the headlights swung away, and it was gone.

Mason slammed it into reverse, backed up in a wide arc that nearly took us into a light pole, then dropped it into drive and headed for the chain.

He didn’t slow. The chain snapped off one post, smacked the hood, and flipped out of the way.

We hit the smoother road and nobody talked for a solid minute. The radio was still on, some commercial about tires leaking into the silence like it belonged to another universe.

“Did you guys see—” Tyler started.

“Nope,” Mason said fast. “Saw nothing. We’re never going there again.”

“You saw it,” Tyler said, turning to look at me. “Right?”

“Yeah,” I said. There wasn’t any point in pretending. “I saw something.”

We dropped Tyler off on Maple. His porch light is the really bright motion one his dad installed after the mailbox-smashing thing two years ago. It made his front yard look like a set for a local commercial.

“You gonna tell them?” I asked, nodding toward his house.

“And say what?” he asked. “That we trespassed and got chased by… whatever that was? My dad would kill me before the monster got a chance.”

He tried to smile. It didn’t land properly.

“If you get anything weird,” he said. “Texts. Calls. I don’t care what time it is. Call me.”

“Same,” I said.

Mason just tapped the steering wheel.

We waited until his front door opened and closed behind him. Then Mason took me home.

“You sleeping?” he asked, as we turned onto my street.

“I’ll pretend to,” I said.

“Yeah,” he said. “Same.”

He stopped at my curb. I got out, leaning back in for a second.

“We’re not going back there,” I said.

“For once, I agree with you,” he said.

I shut the door.

Walking up my driveway, I noticed white dust on my shoelaces. I caught myself about to scrape them off on the grass, then didn’t. I don’t know why. It felt like admitting something.

Inside, I locked the deadbolt and slid the chain on. Mom was already in bed; I could hear the low hum of her fan upstairs.

In my room, I finally looked at my phone.

There was a notification I’d missed while we were running.

New Voicemail – Unknown Caller – 10:42 PM

The timestamp meant it had hit while we were still inside Parkland.

I sat on the edge of my bed and hit play.

Static. Low and constant. Under it, something like wet fabric being pulled across tile. Then my own voice, distorted but definitely me:

“Run, Caleb.”

Hearing your own name in your own voice, coming from somewhere you didn’t speak, is a special kind of wrong.

The message cut off after thirteen seconds.

I didn’t play it again. I saved it, put the phone face-down on my desk, and went to the bathroom to clean the cut on my leg. The soap smelled like cheap hotel bars. White dust from Parkland flaked off my jeans onto the tile. I kicked it into the corner by the plunger.

I told myself I was fine.

I wasn’t. But my brain tapped out anyway and I slept.

Waking up was worse.

My alarm ripped me out of some blurry nightmare about an elevator that wouldn’t stop. For a second, staring at my ceiling, I was just tired and annoyed.

Then everything crashed back.

The cut on my leg stung when I swung out of bed. There was a smear of pale dust on my pillowcase where my hoodie sleeve had been.

My phone was on my nightstand. Battery: 93%.

There were four notifications. Two were from school and some group chat. The other two were from Tyler.

Both were timestamped 3:14 a.m.

I opened the thread.

First message: a photo.

It looked black at first glance. I cranked the brightness and tilted the screen.

A hallway came into view. Not exactly Parkland’s, but close enough that my stomach clenched. Narrow, grimy, fluorescent light at the far end, flickering. The floor was streaked with something dark and wet, reflecting that bad light in dull lines.

On the right side of the frame, close to the camera, a pale shape was pressed against the wall.

An arm. Too long. The joint bent wrong. Four fingers spread flat, the tips ending in curved, dark nails dug into the paint.

Second message: text.

it knows your name

My thumb hovered over the keyboard.

I hit call instead.

It rang twice. Then the canned voice: “The wireless customer you are trying to reach is unavailable.”

I hung up. Tried again. Same thing.

I went downstairs. Mom was in the kitchen, hair damp, pouring coffee into her travel mug.

“You look rough,” she said. “You and Mason stay up all night?”

“Tyler texted me something at like three,” I said. “Some weird picture. I thought it was a joke.”

Her phone buzzed on the counter. She glanced at it.

Her face went tight.

“Oh, God,” she said quietly.

“What?” I asked.

“It’s a message from the school,” she said. “They’re saying one of your classmates is missing.” She looked at the screen. “A boy named… Tyler Jameson.”

The room tilted.

“Missing how?” I asked.

“It just says he didn’t come home last night and his parents reported it,” she said. “They want anyone who saw him after school to contact the police.”

“We walked around town,” I heard myself say. “Me, him, and Mason. But Mason dropped him off. I saw him go up to his porch.”

I did not say the word Parkland.

“If the police come by, you tell them everything,” she said. “I don’t care if you get in trouble for being somewhere you aren’t supposed to be. Understand?”

My phone buzzed in my hand.

New text from Tyler.

come back

A second one hit right after.

bring him

It came with a photo.

I opened it.

This one was brighter. The flash had gone off. The picture was blown out in the middle.

It showed… pieces. That’s the only way I can describe it. Torn strips of skinless meat piled wrong on a floor I couldn’t completely place. Muscle and fat, white bone glimpses. Nothing where it should be. You know when puzzle pieces almost fit but don’t? It looked like that, but with a person.

Near the top right corner, there was a scrap of dark blue fabric with white stitching. Tyler’s hoodie had looked exactly like that when he got out of the Civic.

At the very bottom edge of the photo, almost cut off, four gray fingers curled into view. Just the tips.

While I was staring, my battery dropped from 93% to 68%.

My hand shook. Coffee sloshed out of Mom’s mug onto the counter.

“What is it?” she asked.

Before I could answer, my phone buzzed again.

New text.

answer the door

“The door?” I said out loud before my brain caught up.

The doorbell rang.

Mom frowned. “They must be going house to house,” she said. “Stay here, okay?”

“Wait—” I started.

But she was already heading down the hall. I heard the deadbolt slide, the chain rattle, the door open.

Voices filtered in. Two male, one female. Serious, low.

“Good morning, Ms. Dorn,” a man said. “Sorry to wake you. We’re following up about your son’s friend, Tyler Jameson.”

“Yes, of course, come in,” Mom said.

She called my name.

It felt like my feet belonged to someone else, but they carried me down the hall anyway.

Two officers stood in the entryway. One tall with tired eyes, one shorter. A woman in plain clothes with a badge on her belt stood behind them.

“Morning, Caleb,” the taller one said. “I’m Officer Reyes. This is Officer Nolan. This is Detective Hsu. We’re trying to piece together where Tyler was last seen.”

He had a clipboard with papers clipped over one of my school photos.

“Your mom says you were with him after school,” Hsu said. Her voice wasn’t unkind, but there was no room in it.

My phone buzzed again in my hand.

“Yeah,” I said. “We just… hung out. Drove around.”

“Where?” Nolan asked.

“Maple. Broad. Near the Shell,” I said. “We didn’t go far.”

It was a half-truth. The worst kind.

“What time did you last see him?” Reyes asked.

“Around ten,” I said. “A little after. Mason dropped him off and I watched him walk up to his porch.”

“Did he say he was going anywhere else?” Hsu asked.

“No,” I said. “He just said he had to be home before midnight. His parents are strict.”

My phone buzzed in my hand again.

A banner flashed at the top: we can hear you.

The preview vanished as quickly as it appeared.

“Would you mind if we look at your texts with him from last night?” Reyes asked. “It helps us get a timeline.”

I thought about saying no. Saying my phone was dead. Saying I’d left it upstairs.

I unlocked it instead, opened the thread, and scrolled up past the worst of it so that memes and homework questions were at the top, then handed it over.

He read silently, lips moving a little. I watched his face go from neutral to mildly amused at some stupid meme, back to neutral when he hit the 3:14 a.m. photo. His eyebrows pulled in.

“What’s this?” he asked, angling it so Detective Hsu could see.

“I woke up and saw it,” I said. “I thought it was from some horror site. I was going to text him and ask what it was, but then Mom got the school alert and you guys showed up.”

Reyes zoomed in. Zoomed back out. Passed the phone to Hsu.

“Looks like fake gore,” she said, after a glance. “Plenty of that online.”

“Kids send each other that kind of thing,” Nolan said, almost to himself. “Shock pictures. Part of the culture.”

None of them were seeing what I was seeing. Or if they were, they were choosing to file it under “prank.”

Reyes scrolled down. He stopped just before the “come back” and “bring him” texts and handed the phone back.

“Did you receive anything after this?” Hsu asked.

“Those two you didn’t get to,” I said. “While you were here. I haven’t really read them.”

“Don’t delete any of it,” Reyes said. He took a card from his pocket and held it out. “If you get anything else from this number, or related to Tyler at all, call this right away. Even if it seems dumb, okay?”

“Okay,” I said.

They asked more questions. Did Tyler seem upset. Was he fighting with anyone. Did he talk about running away. I said no until the word sounded wrong.

They left eventually. The door closed behind them with a soft click.

Mom turned to me. “If there’s anything you didn’t tell them because you were scared you’d get in trouble—”

“I know,” I said.

She went back to the kitchen, already calling her manager on speaker.

I stood in the hall.

My phone buzzed.

New text from Tyler.

we’re close

The battery dropped from 68% to 39% as I watched.

There was another photo attached. I took it to my room before I opened it. I don’t know why that mattered, but it did.

On my bed, with the door half-shut, I looked.

The picture was of my street.

Taken from low to the ground, like whoever took it was crouching or lying in the middle of the road. The angle made the houses lean in a bit. You could see the maple tree in our yard, the cracked sidewalk with the uneven patch where the city painted over some old graffiti a couple summers ago, the Honda my neighbor always parks halfway across the line.

And my house.

My bedroom window.

The curtains were open. You could see a figure sitting on the bed inside, head bent over a phone.

Me.

The timestamp said it had been taken less than a minute before I opened it.

I hadn’t left my room.

The text under it said:

don’t make us ask again

The chips I’d grabbed from the kitchen slipped out of my lap and spilled across the floor.

Battery: 21%.

I called Mason. It went straight to voicemail. His greeting was the dumb old one: “Hey, it’s Mason. If I don’t call you back, it’s because I don’t like you. Kidding. Maybe.”

I hung up. Texted him: Pick up. It’s about Tyler. About Parkland.

No reply.

Mom knocked on my door. “They’ve got something about Tyler on Channel 7,” she said through it. “If you want to—”

“I’ve got homework,” I said, too fast.

She hesitated. “Okay. I’ll call you if they say anything important.”

The TV clicked on downstairs. Bits of the news filtered up through the floor.

“…last seen by friends…”

“…dark blue hoodie…”

“…urging anyone with information…”

My phone buzzed again.

New text from Tyler.

last chance

15 minutes

It came with a video.

I told myself I wouldn’t open it.

I did.

It started in motion and blur. Gray walls, jerky movements. The camera stabilized just enough to make me wish it hadn’t.

The angle was low, pointed down the upper hallway of Building A. I’d know that T-junction anywhere now. Conference room door on the right, red emergency exit at the end. No lights except a smear of gray from the broken window.

Tyler stood in the hallway, maybe twenty feet away. Facing the camera.

His hoodie was shredded and hanging in strips. There were dark stains all over his chest and arms. His stance was wrong—too stiff, like he was being held up by strings that didn’t quite understand how joints worked.

He raised one hand. It shook like it was heavy.

He beckoned.

“Caleb,” he said.

It was his voice and not his voice. Like someone had recorded him through an aquarium pump. Wet and burbling, but I could hear his cadence underneath the distortion.

The camera shifted. There was a scrape behind it, like fingernails along drywall.

Tyler’s eyes flicked past the lens to whatever was behind it. For a second, pure terror pushed through whatever else had hold of him.

“Don’t,” he said quickly. “It—”

The video blurred. The camera spun. For a fraction of a second, the frame caught something tall and jointed crowding the left side of the hall, too close, too much limb for the space.

Then the image smeared into gray blocks, like a file corrupting.

The last clear frame was Tyler’s face, too close. His mouth open too wide, eyes not looking at the camera, but at something behind it. Or behind me. It’s hard to explain.

The video ended.

The progress bar said 00:09.

Battery: 9%.

I tried to save the video to send it to Reyes. A little spinning circle appeared, then an error: FILE NOT FOUND.

The entire message thread blinked. Every bubble turned into an empty outline, then popped back in.

All except the video.

It was just gone. No “failed to download,” no placeholder. Like it had never been there.

The last text in the thread now was:

we’re not done yet

My voicemail icon lit again: 1 New Message – Unknown Caller – 7:22 AM.

I haven’t played that one. Not yet.

I know what I’m supposed to do. Call Reyes. Show him the photos I still have. Hand him my phone, admit we lied about Parkland, deal with whatever comes after.

I’m going to.

But I wanted this written somewhere else first. Somewhere that isn’t just my phone. I watched my phone chew up a video and spit out an error message. I don’t trust it.

I also wanted to warn anyone near here who thinks Parkland is just another “creepy abandoned spot” to film TikToks in.

Something in that building walks around on four-toed feet and spells words in extinguisher dust. It knows how to use a phone number that belongs to a kid whose parents are probably standing in his empty room right now. It can show you your own street from angles nobody’s standing at. It can send you your own voice.

It told us NO when we tried to go back through the lobby. I keep thinking about that. I don’t know if it meant “no, you can’t leave” or “no, don’t go that way.” Either way, we didn’t listen. We punched a window and jumped.

If you’ve been out there and you’ve still got white powder on your shoes or glass dust in your hoodie, pay attention to your notifications tonight.

If you see something from a number that should be off, or from a friend who’s missing, or with a picture of where you are right now taken from somewhere you aren’t—

Don’t open it. Or do, and then call someone immediately. Not just your group chat.

My battery says 5% even though it’s been plugged into the wall since I started typing this. The charging icon keeps flicking on and off.

Someone just rang the doorbell again.

Mom thinks it’s a neighbor bringing food, or the cops coming back with more questions.

The last text I got—one I haven’t opened yet—just popped up on my lock screen.

From Tyler.
