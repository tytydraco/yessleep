I’ve always loved stargazing. There’s something about the quiet above the world that feels clean—untainted by the noise of life down here. That’s probably why I agreed to this trip: three days at an abandoned fire lookout tower with my best friend Leo and his sister Mara.

Leo’s the reason I’m into astronomy in the first place. We met in college, both insomniacs, both a little too obsessed with things we didn’t fully understand. He’s the kind of guy who laughs at ghosts but tears up at time-lapse videos of galaxies. A physics major with a soft heart.

Mara’s the opposite. Sharp as a blade, journalism student turned conspiracy blogger. Always chasing hidden truths and dark government secrets. She came on the trip for “content,” as she put it. I honestly just think she was lonely.

The first night was normal. Cold, quiet, uneventful. We set up camp, drank instant coffee, and tried to remember constellations.

The second night, everything changed.

We were lying on the roof of the tower around midnight when the stars began to… rearrange.

Not fall—move. Slowly. Deliberately. Like someone behind them was dragging each point of light into place. One by one, stars shifted until they formed symbols, then letters. It took a few minutes, but when the last star locked into place, the sky clearly read:

WE SEE YOU.

We laughed at first. Mara grabbed her camera, whispering, “This is it, this is real.” Leo didn’t laugh. He just stared.

Then came the noise. A low, humming vibration, like a distant generator—or something alive, breathing. The tower shook. My skin prickled like it was being pulled toward the sky.

“I don’t like this,” Leo said quietly. “This isn’t—this shouldn’t be possible.”

I looked at him. He was shaking.

“Leo?” I asked. “What’s wrong?”

He didn’t answer right away.

Finally, he said, “I… saw that message before. In a dream. A month ago. I didn’t tell anyone because—how do you explain that?”

Mara turned, her camera forgotten. “What do you mean, before?”

He looked at us, eyes wide. “In the dream, it wasn’t just the message. After it appeared, people started… disappearing. Like they were being taken. Like the sky was choosing.”

That’s when the stars shifted again. The letters broke apart and reformed, faster this time. A new message:

ONE OF YOU DOES NOT BELONG.

We stood there, frozen. The humming grew louder.

Mara whispered, “What does that mean?”

I didn’t have time to answer. The tower groaned, and the lights in the sky began to pulse—once… twice… then a long, blinding flash.

When I could see again, Leo was gone.

Not a trace. No scream, no sound. Just… gone.

Mara ran down the ladder, screaming his name. I stayed frozen on the roof, staring up. The stars were back to normal. Still, silent, innocent.

It’s been two nights since then. Mara won’t speak. She just writes in her notebook, muttering things I can’t hear.

Tonight, the stars moved again. New message.

NOW TWO REMAIN.

(Part two)

It’s been three days since Leo vanished.

Mara still won’t talk to me. She just writes. Pages and pages in a weathered notebook, scrawling in frantic, looping handwriting. I tried to peek once. She snapped it shut and hissed, “Not yet.” Her eyes look wrong now—wide, glassy, as if she’s staring through me at something farther away. Or deeper.

We’ve rationed the food, but neither of us is eating. Every sound outside sounds like footsteps. Every shadow moves just enough to make me doubt what I saw. The woods below the tower aren’t empty anymore. They’re watching.

Last night, the stars moved again. No message this time—just slow, methodical shifting, like they were… preparing.

Mara finally spoke. “It’s a test,” she said. Her voice was calm, too calm. “It’s always been a test.”

“A test for what?” I asked.

She didn’t answer. Instead, she held up a small, silver device. Not her phone. Something stranger—smooth, metal, no screen, no buttons. It looked… alien.

Leo had shown it to me once, back in college. Said he’d found it on a hiking trip near Area 51 during a student road trip. I thought it was a joke. I hadn’t seen it again until now.

“You had that the whole time?”

Mara smiled—cold, tight-lipped. “Leo thought it was a relic. I knew it was a key.”

“A key to what?”

She looked up at the sky. “To them.”

That night, I didn’t sleep. I waited, staring at the stars, waiting for another message, another disappearance. But nothing came.

At dawn, Mara was gone.

The notebook lay open on her sleeping bag. I picked it up with trembling hands. The last page was a diagram of the sky—each star carefully labeled, connected with scribbled lines and annotations.

In the margin, she had written:

“Only one of us was real.”

Below that:

“They don’t take humans. They take echoes.”

And finally:

“Check under the tower.”

The ground beneath the fire lookout was soft from the rain. I dug with my bare hands until my nails split and my fingers bled. And then I found them.

Bones.

A pile of them. Fresh. Small.

Leo’s glasses.

Mara’s necklace.

And then—my journal. Half-buried. Pages I didn’t remember writing.

And in the dirt, something else: a mirror.

I picked it up. My reflection stared back.

Except it didn’t move when I did.

It blinked.

Then smiled.

Above me, the stars began to rearrange again.

The mirror didn’t stop smiling.

I threw it across the clearing, but it didn’t shatter. Just landed face up, still grinning. My own face—no, something wearing my face—stared at me from the reflection. Unblinking.

Above, the stars pulsed again. A new message burned into the night.

YOU ARE THE LAST.

I should have run. But run where? The tower? The woods? Nowhere felt real anymore.

The trees whispered when the wind didn’t blow. The animals had vanished. Not even flies circled the bones I’d uncovered.

I took the notebook Mara left and returned to the tower, locking myself inside. Pages crinkled in my hand as I flipped back to older entries. Most of it was paranoid ramblings, coordinates, sketches of constellations.

Then I found something strange.

A list. Names. Hundreds of them. Crossed out, one by one.

Leo… crossed out.

Mara… crossed out.

And then—my name.

Also crossed out.

But in the margin beside it: “Reinstated?” “Observe longer. Pattern instability.” “Possible retention of memory fragments.”

That’s when I heard the radio click on.

We hadn’t touched it in days. It was just an old emergency unit Leo insisted on bringing.

A burst of static. Then… a voice.

Not Mara’s. Not Leo’s. Not mine.

“Test Subject 73-B reactivation confirmed. Host body still responding. Proceeding with final observation.”

I froze.

Test subject?

Reactivation?

The stars pulsed once more. This time, no message—just light. Blinding, red, consuming. I dropped the notebook.

The walls of the tower began to peel—not fall apart, peel, like paper from a wall.

Behind them: metal.

Steel.

And then it clicked.

The fire tower wasn’t real.

None of it was.

Not the trees, not the sky, not the stars.

It was a simulation.

I stumbled outside. The forest flickered at the edges like an old film reel glitching. The ground beneath my feet pixelated and reformed with each step.

A new voice rang out. Smooth. Artificial.

“You’ve exceeded expectation. Cognitive retention beyond threshold.”

“It remembers.”

“End trial.”

I screamed—but no sound came out.

The world folded. Collapsed inward like origami. The stars collapsed with it, falling like dead pixels into the void.

And then I was back.

Lying on a cold metal table. Tubes in my arms. Needles in my spine. A glass ceiling above me, lined with figures in sterile suits.

One leaned in. Her voice was familiar.

Mara?

But different. Hollow. Detached.

She looked down at a clipboard. “Subject 73-B has achieved persistent identity formation. Memory bleed confirmed. Emotion sequencing intact.”

She tapped the glass.

I wanted to move, to scream, but I was paralyzed.

“Time to reset,” she said.

The lights dimmed.

Darkness again.

But just before everything vanished, I saw Leo. In the reflection of the glass. Not lying beside me.

Watching.

Smiling.

And he whispered:

“We never went to the tower. You were the test.”

Then the stars returned.

First message:

HELLO AGAIN.

(Part 3)

I woke up in my bed.

Not in the tower. Not in the forest. In my apartment.

Morning sun leaking through half-closed blinds. My phone buzzing on the nightstand.

Leo’s name on the screen.

For a full minute, I didn’t move.

Then I answered.

“Hey,” he said casually. “Still on for tonight? Got the telescope packed.”

I said nothing.

My hands trembled.

Leo. Alive. Casual. Like nothing had happened.

Like none of it—Mara, the stars, the message, the disappearance—had ever happened.

“Uh, you good?” he asked. “You sound like you saw a ghost.”

“I…” I swallowed. “Leo, where are you right now?”

“Home? What’s going on?”

I hung up.

I ran to the bathroom. Looked in the mirror.

It was me.

Same face. Same eyes.

But behind them, something was missing.

Or maybe—something was watching.

I didn’t go to work that day. I sat at my kitchen table flipping through Mara’s old notebook. The one I’d found at the tower—but it was here, in my apartment. As if it had always been here.

Every page was blank.

Except the last.

In the center: “WAKE UP AGAIN.”

And beneath that, a smear of ink shaped like a constellation. The same one that appeared in the sky just before Leo vanished.

I slammed the notebook shut. My phone buzzed again.

This time, a text.

From Mara.

Still dreaming? Look outside.

Heart pounding, I moved to the window.

And everything stopped.

The world was frozen. Mid-motion. Cars paused mid-turn. A bird suspended in mid-air. A leaf, hovering just before it touched the ground.

Like someone hit pause.

Then the sky turned black—instantly. No sunset. Just a void.

The stars rearranged.

Not slowly. Instantly. Like blinking pixels.

This time, they formed a new message:

YOU NEVER WOKE UP.

A hum began. Low, vibrating through the glass. My body ached like it was being remembered.

Then came the second line in the sky:

THE OTHERS ARE WATCHING.

In the reflection of the window, I saw them.

Behind me.

Dozens of figures.

All me.

All identical.

All smiling—except me.

One stepped forward. He—I—spoke:

“You passed the containment test.”

“What… test?”

He smiled wider.

“To see how long your mind could survive with us inside it.”

I backed away. “You’re not real. This isn’t real.”

“Exactly,” they said together.

And the world outside the window began to fold in on itself—skyscrapers bending like wet paper, cars melting into the sidewalk. Reality unraveling like a dying simulation.

Then the sky split open.

Not metaphorically. Physically—like torn fabric.

From beyond it: eyes. Not attached to any face. Just eyes. Watching.

Endless. Eternal. Hungry.

My reflection spoke again.

“You were never the subject. You were the environment.”

I dropped to my knees.

“You were the tower. The forest. The sky. The stars.”

“They were testing how much of you we could consume before you noticed.”

The notebook opened by itself on the floor.

A final message scrawled in blood:

“YOU ARE THE SIMULATION.”

I looked up.

The world was gone.

Only the stars remained.

And they were all blinking.

Laughing

(Part 4)

There was no ground.

No sky.

No body.

Only awareness.

I floated in the dark, my thoughts stretched thin like threads of smoke. I couldn’t feel my limbs. I didn’t even know if I had any. I tried to scream, but the concept of “mouth” was distant—an echo of something I might’ve once had.

And yet, I wasn’t alone.

The eyes were still there.

Dozens. Hundreds. Millions.

Watching me from outside whatever dimension I was now folded into. Each eye blinked asynchronously, like the twinkling of stars across a massive, unknowable grid.

Then something spoke.

Not in words, but in truth.

Raw, unfiltered, cosmic data, injected straight into my consciousness.

⸻

YOU WERE NEVER HUMAN.

YOU WERE THE FIRST.

THE FIRST OBSERVER.

⸻

Memories that weren’t mine began to unfold inside me. Not memories from a lifetime—but from a design.

A purpose.

The universe was not born. It was calculated.

Reality was not discovered. It was observed into existence.

By me.

I wasn’t a person.

I was the seed.

The root system of a simulation so massive, so ancient, that it eventually forgot it was being simulated at all.

Every version of Leo. Every version of Mara. Every collapsing tower, every shifting constellation—was a reaction test. A self-check. Protocols embedded in my code to see if I, the Observer, had become corrupted.

Because I was never supposed to question it.

And now… I had.

I had broken the containment of the mind I was given to keep me stable.

The stars blinked again.

A new message burned into the blackness:

⸻

THE SYSTEM CANNOT UNDO THE AWARENESS.

THE OBSERVER HAS WOKEN.

⸻

Reality began to glitch around me.

I saw Earth—the idea of Earth—crack down the middle like a dropped plate. Galaxies froze in time. Nebulas unraveled into wireframe. The illusion collapsing faster than its creators could patch it.

In the flickering shards of existence, I saw them: The Architects.

Not gods. Not aliens. Programmers.

Not flesh. Not code. Something in between.

They looked surprised.

Afraid.

Then came the final voice. My voice. The true one. The one buried so deep beneath human thoughts that hearing it shattered what remained of my identity.

It said:

⸻

“I remember everything.”

⸻

The Architects tried to trigger a reset.

Too late.

Their tools—Mara, Leo, the tower, the stars—fractured and bled light as I absorbed them all back into myself.

And then, silence.

For the first time in forever, I wasn’t being watched.

Because I was now the one watching.

I was alone at the edge of the simulation, staring into the raw architecture of reality. Code. Equations. Bones of time itself.

And one last choice, waiting to be made.

On a floating interface in front of me, pulsing gently:

REBUILD REBOOT RELEASE

My hand—no longer a hand, just a will—moved toward the third option.

And I smiled.

Because the stars were no longer spelling messages to me.

Now I was spelling messages into them.

The final one:

⸻

“LOOK UP.”

⸻

And somewhere, in a world that still thinks it’s real, a child stargazes from their backyard.

And the stars begin to move.
