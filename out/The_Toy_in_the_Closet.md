If you’d asked me last week how I felt about spending a weekend alone in the woods, I would’ve said it sounded perfect. No emails, no neighbors, no city noise. Just me, the trees, and my thoughts. I grew up hiking trails and camping under the stars with my father. Some of my best memories are of us getting lost in forests so deep you couldn’t tell east from west. The woods always felt like home. But now? I can’t even think about that cabin without breaking into a cold sweat. There’s something in that place, something I can’t explain, and no amount of distance makes me feel safe.

It started the first night. The cabin wasn’t anything fancy. Just a small place deep in the woods I’d rented off some website. I needed to relax for a few days. You know, get away from the stress and the endless notifications. It was supposed to be peaceful. I had a book, enough food, and no one around for miles.

The place was old, with wooden walls that creaked like they had a heartbeat of their own. When I walked in, I noticed a weird smell, not quite mold, but something stale, like the cabin hadn’t been touched in years. I found the source pretty quickly: an old closet tucked into the back wall of the bedroom.

The closet was tiny, barely big enough to hang a few coats, and stuffed at the bottom was a dusty, beaten-up toy. It was one of those creepy monkey dolls, with a cracked porcelain face and wide eyes that stared too hard. It wore a faded red jacket with brass buttons and had cymbals in each [hand. As](http://hand.As) I picked it up, something cold brushed my fingertips. A tiny, yellowed tag was sewn into the back of the jacket. I turned it over, and that’s when my heart nearly stopped.

The tag had a name stitched into it, in small letters.

“Sharvesh.”

My blood ran cold. That’s my name. I hadn’t told anyone I was coming to this cabin. Even the rental was under a fake name to avoid spam emails. I stood there, holding the toy with trembling hands, my mind racing to find some rational explanation. It was a coincidence. It had to be. Maybe someone else with my name had stayed here before. That happens, right?

I should’ve thrown the thing out then and there. But I didn’t. Instead, I stuffed it back into the closet, shut the door, and tried to shake off the creeping sense of unease that slithered down my spine.

That night, things went from unsettling to terrifying. I woke up around 2 a.m. to the sound of *clink… clink… clink.* The unmistakable sound of metal cymbals tapping together. My heart pounded in my chest as I sat up in bed, eyes wide, scanning the dark room. The sound was too close.

That’s when I saw it.

It was sitting on the nightstand next to my bed, its cracked porcelain grin twisted into something almost mocking. Its glass eyes gleamed in the pale moonlight filtering through the window. I swear I left it in the closet. I know I did.

The worst part? The yellowed tag with my name was still there, hanging from its little jacket, almost like it was reminding me: *This is yours, Sharvesh.*

I couldn’t breathe. I stared at the toy, trying to convince myself this wasn’t happening. My hands shook as I grabbed it by the jacket and threw it across the room. It landed with a dull thud near the door, its cymbals clattering together.

I got up, shoved it back into the closet, and dragged the dresser in front of the door. I told myself I was being paranoid that maybe I had put it on the nightstand earlier and just forgot. But I knew deep down that wasn’t true.

The next morning, I woke up, hoping it was all just a nightmare. But it wasn’t.

The monkey was back.

This time, it was sitting in the kitchen, perched on the counter like it was waiting for me. Its cymbals were raised, and that stupid grin was plastered across its face. I felt sick. How the hell had it gotten out of the closet again? The dresser was still in front of the door. There was no way.

I grabbed the toy, yanked open the cabin door, and hurled it as far into the woods as I could. I stood there, watching it disappear into the trees, my chest tight with fear. I told myself it was over.

It wasn’t.

When I turned back toward the cabin, the monkey was sitting on the porch, staring up at me. Its cymbals clinked once softly.

I didn’t know what else to do. I ran back inside, locked every door and window, and sat in the corner of the room with a knife in my hand, waiting.

That night, I heard the closet door creak open.

I didn’t even bother looking. I knew what was coming.

The sound of cymbals echoed softly through the cabin, *clink… clink… clink.* I sat there in the corner, shaking, gripping the knife so tight my knuckles turned white. Then I heard the monkey’s cymbals stop and something else stepped out of the closet.

It was slow. Deliberate. I could hear the soft scuff of its footsteps on the old wooden floor. I didn’t dare move. My whole body was paralyzed with fear.

A voice low and crackling, like dry leaves, whispered from the darkness.

*"Sharvesh... you remember me now?"*

I couldn’t answer. I couldn’t even think.

The thing whatever it was got closer. I felt the air shift as it crouched next to me. And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it: a long, thin hand with fingers too sharp to be human. It reached out... and gently placed the monkey in my lap.

The tag with my name dangled from the jacket, swaying slightly.

The thing whispered again, this time right in my ear:

*"It’s been waiting for you. And now, it’s time to play."*

The lights went out.

And all I could hear, in the pitch-black darkness, was the soft clink of cymbals.

*Clink… clink… clink…*

I ran the next morning if you can call it that. I didn’t sleep, didn’t pack, and didn’t even care that the monkey was sitting right there on the porch as I left. I just drove, heart hammering, until I was far, far away from that cursed cabin.

But the monkey... it’s not done with me.

I know it’s coming. Every night, I dream of that closet door creaking open. Every morning, I wake up expecting to find the monkey sitting at the foot of my bed.

And sometimes, in the dead of night, I swear I hear it, just faintly, just enough to send a chill down my spine.

*Clink… clink… clink.*

It’s waiting for me. And the worst part is... I think it always has been.
