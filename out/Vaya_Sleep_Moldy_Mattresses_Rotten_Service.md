My wife and I bought two mattresses from Vaya Sleep, expecting quality and reliability. Instead, we got mold—on both of them. This wasn’t just a disappointment; it was a health hazard and a customer service nightmare that’s left us furious.

For context, back in October 2024, we discovered fiberglass leaking from our old mattress. I had no idea how common fiberglass is as a fire-retardant layer until then. Determined to avoid that mess again, we researched fiberglass-free options and landed on Vaya Sleep. Their mattresses promised simplicity, competitive pricing, glowing reviews, and—crucially—no fiberglass. It seemed like the perfect fit. We ordered two, excited for a fresh start in our new home.

That excitement died about a month ago. While cleaning our bedding, I noticed odd staining on our mattress protector. Peeling it back, I found mold sprawling across the mattress underneath (photos attached). This isn’t some minor flaw—my wife is pregnant, and we’re in a brand-new home with zero mold issues elsewhere. Alarmed, I checked the second mattress. Same story: dark stains, spores, a full-on fungal disaster on the top layer (more photos attached). Someone suggested the black spots on the lower foam might be dirt, not mold. Fine—then what kind of filthy warehouse is Vaya running?

We’re not imagining this. The mold was inside the mattress protectors on both beds, meaning it came from the mattresses themselves. After some digging, we suspect Vaya shipped these before the glue between the foam layers fully dried. We followed their instructions—letting the mattresses “breathe” for 72 hours before adding protectors—but that wasn’t enough. Trapped moisture from their shoddy assembly process turned our new beds into petri dishes.

I contacted Vaya on February 16, 2025, to file a warranty claim. Crickets. I followed up with emails and calls—over and over—only to get vague “we’re working on it” brush-offs from their sales team. It took until March 5 for a real response, when they asked for more photos, including the law tag. Here’s the kicker: I’d already thrown the mattresses out after weeks of silence. Who wouldn’t? If Vaya had bothered to reply sooner, I’d have those tags photographed. Instead, they dragged their feet for three weeks, then used my (justified) disposal of their moldy garbage as an excuse to deny the claim. As of March 16, they’ve washed their hands of us.

This isn’t just bad service—it’s incompetence bordering on malice. Vaya’s quality control is a joke, and their customer support is a black hole. We’re out thousands of dollars, stuck replacing mattresses again, and dealing with the stress of mold exposure during a pregnancy—all because Vaya can’t build a decent product or answer an email. How are they still in business?

If you’re considering a Vaya Sleep mattress, don’t. Look at Boring Co. or Casper instead—comparable prices, better reputations, and no horror stories like this. Vaya’s mattresses are among the worst purchases I’ve ever made. I’ll make damn sure no one I know touches this company. They don’t deserve your money or your trust.
