I never saw the faces of the men who kidnapped me.

I'd been too busy working when the gang of them burst through the front door. Like smoke from an explosion, the kidnappers spread through the entire building. They demanded victims and turned our world upside down searching for them. They didn't speak outside of grunted demands and language so blue that if you could see the words spilling from their mouths, it'd be a dam breaking.

The moment was swift and slow. I was helping my co-worker Josh when the raid began. Josh ran, but the masked men didn't chase. They turned their ire on me, pulling weapons from holsters and barking demands. I pride myself on thinking on my feet, but the only two thoughts I had were, "This can't be real?" and "Oh shit, what are they going to do to me?"

I started to turn, but two sets of hands shoved me hard against the wall. My head slammed into the drywall, cracking it. I saw stars but composed myself enough to ask, "What the hell are you doing? I'm a citizen! Let go of me."

My protests were answered with demands that I "shut my fucking face" and "quit fighting." One of them punched me in the kidney. The pain rippled through my body, and in that moment of weakness, they took control. The two unknown assailants wrenched my arms behind my back and slid zip tie cuffs around my wrists. They yanked the plastic so hard that it tore my skin. My blood seeped out drop by drop.

"Walk," they demanded, the tips of their guns pressed into the small of my back. I had hundreds of things to say - millions of thoughts running through my brain - but my mouth wouldn't work. My nervous system went into self-preservation mode and shut down any part of me that might try to resist.

The kidnappers pushed me through my office - past my dumbstruck co-workers - screaming and threatening the crowd of people who'd gathered to yell and blow shrill whistles. I prayed one of my friends from work would stand up and say, "You've made a mistake. He's with us."

None of them did.

Nobody stopped the kidnapping. The dozen or so masked kidnappers, aiming weapons at everyone, prevented that. What struck me about these goons was that they came in all shapes, shades, and sizes. My kidnapper was a pear-shaped man with a bushy red beard that poked through his face-covering. Their threats to fire into the crowd were louder than the people's screams.

I was thrown into a nondescript white van and shackled to the wall. Any which way I moved, pain shot through my shoulders and down my spine. I leaned back, my head clunking against the metal wall, and felt hot tears form in my eyes. This had to be a mistake. Had to be.

The van was filled with about a dozen others. Men, women, and children were all shackled. Even the kids had handcuffs on - the goddamn children. What harm could they cause? Half of the people silently sobbed while the rest sat motionless. Already resigned to their fate.

We'd all heard tales of the kidnappers. Rumors about the camps. The horrors inflicted on the people sent there. The deaths. Until this moment, though, it felt a million miles away. I'd done everything right - gone to the best schools, got the good job, always voted - but they came for me, anyway.

Leaning forward, gravity let the tears I'd been trying to hold in fall down my cheeks. Shame wrapped itself around my heart and squeezed. I was smart and always quick on my feet. But at that moment, when I needed my wits to keep my freedom, I froze. I was sharper than that. That my dullness had helped to put me in this situation deepened my shame and anger.

"Are you okay?" the man next to me said. It was the building's handyman, Marco. I sighed and thanked God for the bittersweet comfort. We weren't exactly friends, but we were friendly with each other. I wished he weren't there, but found some comfort in a familiar face.

"No," I said. "Are you?"

Marco's darting eyes and trembling body gave me that answer. His right knee was bouncing so much, I thought he might wear out a hole in the van floor. "Where are we going?" Marco asked, his voice small.

"Court," I said, unsure myself. In a land of laws, it seemed like a smart response. "Has to be court, right?"

The woman shackled opposite us laughed. A long, drawn-out cackle that reminded me of the stories of witches my mother used to tell me around the campfire. She sat up, flung back her hair, and exposed map of purple bruising across her face. Her white teeth outlined in red from the cuts in her mouth. Several blood vessels in her eyes had broken, and the whites of her eyes were ruby.

"Court? You're dressed for it, but that isn't what's in store for us."

"Where are we going?" Marco asked her.

"Hell," she said. "And we're not coming back."

What followed was a three-hour-long car ride south. From the glimpses through the windshield, I saw office buildings transform into homes and homes turn into swamps. Even from inside the van, nature's buzz found us. As we slowed to turn down a road lined with swaying jungle trees, I glimpsed a sign that had the word "camp" across it. Strangely, there was a smiling group of tourists snapping photos in front of it. Did they see me?

We drove another forty minutes into the heart of the swamp. Any vestiges of civilization left us long ago. Acres of dense, humid jungle surrounded us. The van's interior had grown noticeably warmer. Everyone was pouring sweat. It rolled down our faces and into our cuts and burned. Our shoulders ached from sitting in the same position for hours. My hands were numb. Useless.

We finally stopped, all of our tired bodies jostled around, our already sore muscles burning anew. The door swung open, blinding us with the sudden reappearance of sunlight. The kidnappers ordered us out.

We filed out, squinting, and were lined up. When my vision returned, I glanced around our destination. There were two buildings in the complex: a small, gray brick building with the words "Processing Center" stenciled in black paint on the front door and a large, steel-sheeted airplane hangar behind it. It was old and probably abandoned, as spots of rust still marred the thinly applied paint.

This entire complex - and all its prisoners - was surrounded by a measly cyclone fence. Sure, it was topped with a coil of razor wire, but that didn't feel right. Remove the barbed wire, and this was any fence you'd see in your neighborhood. Taller, sure, but not by much. It was far from the imposing brick walls and high gun towers you usually associated with prisons. This was a bad summer camp with extra steps.

We were told we were going to be processed and moved into the prison. If we stepped out of line, there'd be hell to pay. We all knew it meant physical harm, but we were miles away from the public eye. Physical harm might be the best-case scenario. I shuddered to think what the worst case would be.

The relief of the air-conditioned office was instant and welcome. I would've lived here. We shuffled in. They ordered us not to speak until spoken to. That wasn't a concern. Nobody had uttered a single syllable for hours. Why start now?

I was behind Marco, who was behind the bloodied woman. We moved along the line slowly. First, they took your information - name, date of birth, things like that - then you got stripped, photographed, given a jumpsuit with a number etched on the back, and sent out into the prison. It took about ten minutes for your freedom to disappear completely.

The woman in front of Marco chose violence. She refused to give her name. Complained in multiple languages about the way she was being treated. She was rewarded with a nightstick to the stomach. When she still didn't comply, the nightstick found a new spot right between the shoulder blades. She dropped but tried to rise again. A boot to the face not only jarred a tooth loose but knocked her out cold. Two kidnappers dragged her body away, leaving a streak of red blood trailing behind her. No one objected. No one wanted to be next. Marco answered every question.

After they processed me, we entered the old airplane hangar that they had hastily converted to a makeshift prison. Inside, there weren't cells, just a large area with more cyclone fencing acting as interior walls. As the main gate swung open, the people inside shuffled away from it, their eyes never leaving the ground. They didn't want to draw the ire of the guards.

There were no beds here. No phones. No privacy at all. Even the toilets were in the open. The only privacy you'd get is if a phalanx of others stood around you. There was nothing to do - no books, no TV, nothing. Children used the gift of boredom to make games with small rocks and dead bugs they'd found.

They also kept the prison icy. It was a torture tactic. The temperature change from indoors to outdoors was designed to shock your body. Never let you get comfortable. The kidnappers didn't provide any blankets to keep warm at night. No water access outside to stay cool during the day. Their job was to keep you off balance.

I walked to a solid wall and sat. My swollen and bruised wrists ached, and I rubbed them, hoping the pain would ease. But the rubbing felt like lightning in my muscles, and I knew the only relief I'd get from the steady throbbing would come during sleep. In the morning, stiff joints and more pain would be my punishment for that smallest of comforts.

Marco joined me on the wall. What do you say after you've been wrongfully imprisoned? We had the entire drive to wallow in our despair, and I used every second to do so. While I still felt the pull of hopelessness yanking me down into the mire, I'd decided to find a sense of normalcy here and plot my escape. If I were dead anyway, might as well go down swinging.

"Think the company is gonna use our PTO for this?" I joked, trying to break the tension.

"I don't think we're getting out of here."

"We shouldn't even be here. This has to be a mistake. Has to be."

"It is, but they don't admit mistakes," he said, looking around the room. "In their eyes, if we're here, we must be guilty."

The door between the processing and the prison opened up, and two masked kidnappers walked in, dragging the woman from the van behind them. Her eyes were closed, and her head lolled back and forth. More blood trickled onto the white tiles, but most of the wounds had crusted over. Her facial map of bruising had new continents.

She looked dead.

They opened the gate, dropped her in a heap, and left. Every conversation stopped. Every pair of eyes found her form. We all waited and hoped she'd move. That she'd give us a sign she was still with us.

The guards, who abhorred hope, slammed their weapons against the fences to break the silence. I imagine quiet in a place like this might spark introspection. Introspection leads to unwelcome discoveries about oneself. Kidnappers weren't immune to introspection, though their uniforms were the antibiotic that fought off the infection.

"Get moving, bitch," one of the kidnappers barked. "Get moving, or we'll leave you outside for the gators and bugs."

The other masked men laughed. It echoed in the room.

Finally, through the grace of God, the woman's fingers twitched. In slow motion, she moved her busted and carved-up arms under her chest and pushed up to all fours. She took slow, deep, but ragged breaths. Blood trickled from her nose and stained the ground below her.

She pushed her battered body the rest of the way up. Standing on shaking legs, she turned to face the kidnappers. "Cowards die a hundred deaths. Yours are coming soon." She spat a bloody gob of spit at their feet, the crimson-streaked spittle hanging from her swollen lips.

The prison erupted in cheers and hooting. Prisoners near the fences grabbed them and shook. Some stomped and clapped. Marco let out an ear-splitting whistle. It was chaos. It was joy. It was short-lived.

The two guards raised their guns and fired dozens of pepper balls into the woman's body. She collapsed to the ground as the sickening orange clouds spread through the prison. Families panicked. Children burst into tears. We all closed our eyes and put the front of our jumpsuits over our noses. It didn't matter. The sting bled through.

All the kidnappers left, but they weren't gone for long. They returned with gas masks on and forced us to head out into the yard until the prison could be cleared of the pepper ball smoke.

They left the woman on the floor.

We stepped outside into the humid jungle. The air was heavy, and sweat formed as soon as your foot stepped beyond the door. Our jumpsuits clung to our bodies. We all moved as far away from the building as we could, letting the pepper-ball mist waft out.

I walked to the fence, clutched it between my fingers, and stared out into the greenery. No more than three feet from the fence line was the marshy edge of the swamp. Buzzing insects seeking people to bother filled the air. A slender, elegant ibis stalked the shallows, looking for a fish to capture.

"I used to see those birds walking in my neighborhood," Marco said, joining me at the fence. "They would move in a flock on the ground like an invading army."

"We had a pond at my apartment complex, and they'd go after our fish. Used to drive the old folks crazy," I said with a chuckle.

We stood in silence for a beat until Marco sighed. "I think they're going to kill that woman tonight."

I didn't respond. Not because I disagreed, but I didn't want to speak it into existence. "Why do you think they only have a chain-link fence around this place?" I asked, changing gears. "Seems like it'd be easy to escape."

An older man nearby heard my question and chuckled. I turned to him, and he nodded. "Forgive my laughing. I didn't mean anything by it."

"Make it up to me by explaining it."

"Friend, if you go out into the jungle alone, you'll die. Snakes, gators, insects - a million ways to die before you'd ever find pavement. Nobody would ever find your remains. Your whole existence will be like that orange smoke - a minor inconvenience that disappears as soon as the wind blows," he said. He nodded to the two armed guards standing nearby. "They won't even follow you out there."

"No?"

"Easier just to erase your file and burn your belongings than risk their life," he said with a shrug. "These bastards are monsters, but lazy ones. Beat us, sure, but chase us? Please."

"I grew up near the jungle," Marco said. "Traveled deep into it and returned to tell the tale."

The old man laughed. "Not this deep. You're welcome to try, my friend, but you'd fail. If the animals don't get you, the Creeping Death will."

"Creeping Death?"

"A creature that lives in the swamps. Made to blend into the landscape. It views mankind as a force for evil. It hunts us if we stray too deep," the old man said, pointing out into the dense foliage. "We're in its domain now. It's out there, watching us. Waiting."

"The guards know this?"

The old man nodded. "I've heard them speak about strange lights at night. Noises that don't sound natural. They fear the dark, our captors."

"Scared of old stories," Marco said, not buying any of it.

There was a commotion near the doors of the prison. We all turned and saw six armed guards yelling that the smoke had cleared and we needed to come back inside. One by one, my compatriots peeled off and headed back. I lingered at the fence a bit longer, getting one last look at the greenery before heading in.

The woman was leaning against the wall when I walked back in. New red welts cascaded from her shoulders and down her arms. Her body was beaten, and yet she was smiling, the hole where her tooth had been prominent in her grin. Everyone avoided her. If the guards thought you were associated with an agitator, you became one, too.

She sensed my looming and craned her head until we locked eyes. "You come to gawk at an untouchable, Suit?"

I sat down next to her. Her raised eyebrows came with a quick grin. "I saw where they took you from and assumed you didn't have fire in your belly. Maybe I was wrong."

"Honestly, aren't," I said. "But a stranger told me earlier we were already in Hell. Might as well make friends with the damned." She cackled, and I smiled. Her laughter turned to coughing. "You okay? That shit stings your lungs."

"Probably causes cancer, too, but they don't care. The devils that run this place." She spat again for good measure.

"What do you think they're gonna do with us?"

"Kill us," she said with a shrug. "Not right away. They want people to forget we're here first. When that happens, we're dead."

I sat there in silence for a few seconds before deadpanning, "So, you're not an optimist, huh?"

She cackled again and slapped my back. "I like you, Suit. You got a soul. People with souls are in short supply these days."

"Strict religious upbringing, I suppose." I leaned closer and whispered, "You think there's any way out of this place?"

"There's always a way out. Some ways are better than others."

"Did you see the outside barrier? It's just a chain-link fence. Barbed wire on the top, sure, but that's it."

"The real barrier is the jungle."

"You're the second person to say that."

"Because it's true," she said, eyeing me. "You ever been out in the jungles?"

"Does doing a fan boat tour count?"

Her single raised eyebrow told me it didn't. "You touch the wrong thing out there, you put your life in danger, you understand that?"

"If we stay here, our lives are in danger, too."

"We're not disagreeing, Suit. Just letting you know that the jungle is no joke. Easy to mess around with something you should've left alone."

"Like the Creeping Death?"

She looked at me, confused. "The what?"

"That old man over there said there was some monster called the Creeping Death that hunts humans. Was he lying?"

"I've never heard of it. I'm sure there are things out there we don't know about, but I am much more concerned with the monsters I see daily than some old wives' tale."

I nodded. Hard to argue. "If, hypothetically, we could get over that fence, could we survive?"

She glanced around. Several guards were bullshitting and laughing about something I'm sure wasn't funny to begin with. They all stood clutching their bulletproof vests like a scared child holds a teddy bear. But at the moment, they were ignoring us.

She leaned close and whispered, "The fence won't be easy to climb - especially with the razor wire - but it's not impossible."

"How cut up would you get?"

"Depends on how quickly you try to hurl over it," she said with a shrug. "The real question is when you'd do it. Night would be best, but I imagine they lock us in for that. We'd need to engineer a way out. Tunnel or something."

"Maybe I can call in a bomb threat?" I deadpanned.

She cackled, and it drew the briefest glance from the masked men. We stopped chatting and stared out at them. The one who stared the longest was my kidnapper. His sloppy red beard peeked out from his filthy mask. Those eyes were black and sunken - almost as if they were trying to retreat from the world he watched daily. He finally turned back to his group.

"You draw too much attention to yourself."

"You laughed," I said.

"They're going to keep an eye on me, Suit," she said. "They don't like me."

"What would give you that idea?"

"Call it a hunch," she said, smiling so wide her missing tooth was apparent. "Split apart now, but find me tonight. We can talk more then. Now, go."

I did and spent the rest of the day casing the prison - trying to find a weakness. Given enough time, I believed I'd find a way out of here. I had to. I was innocent, but when you're a captive, truth becomes malleable. The gun wielder decides what's real, facts be damned.

At sunset, we were given a small ration of burned rice and beans. The taste was awful, but my stomach appreciated any company. I finished it quickly, suppressing my urge to throw it all up. I spent the rest of the mealtime watching whole families circle up and eat in silence. No joy. No jokes. Just survival.

As the sun slipped below the horizon, the facility's lights shut off. With no sun and the AC cranked to sub-arctic limits, chattering teeth and shivering bodies became prevalent. It was so cold that people - strangers the day before - cuddled together to stay warm. Parents let their children use their bodies as blankets and pillows. Hugs doubled as a favorite lost blanket left at their ransacked home.

Despite the many discomforts, sleep is a beast that remains undefeated. My body shut down, and I drifted off. I don't know how long I was out, but when the noises woke me, it was pitch-black outside. At first, I thought it was a bird in the jungles outside, but then I heard the word "fuck."

I got up and scanned around until I saw the tiniest sliver of light creeping in from the door to the yard. Someone had propped it open with a pebble. Through the crack, struggling grunts found my ears. I glanced around and felt a sickening feeling grow in my stomach.

The woman was missing.

Softly, as if my shoes were made of cotton, I tiptoed toward the open door. My nerves were setting little fires all over my body, but my brain was doing its best to contain the blaze. I flexed my shaking hands and settled on turning them into fists. Despite the industrial AC fans blowing, sweat beaded on my forehead.

As I reached the crack in the door, the noises grew louder and more agitated. More violent. I peeked out and saw, in the middle of the yard, four kidnappers holding the woman down. She squirmed under their grip and tried to yell for help, but the gloved hand over her mouth muffled her pleas.

Standing between her legs was the pear-shaped man. I couldn't see his eyes, but I didn't need to. His intent was obvious. I cursed under my breath, gradually pushed the door open, and snuck outside.

The temperature change wasn't as dramatic as it'd been earlier, but the humidity made my pores weep. To keep it from stinging my eyes, I had to windshield-wiper my brow. The lights in the yard were aimed in a way that created a long, shadowy section along the near wall. I'd have the cover of shadows for a bit, but only that. If their eyes left the woman's writhing body, they'd see me.

Orange doesn't blend well with black.

As the pear-shaped man unbuckled his pants, my eyes spotted a fist-sized rock near my foot. A plan came to me. One that could save the woman and allow me to escape. It was imperfect, and a lot of it hinged on me recalling my high school pitching days, but I didn't have any other ideas.

I clutched the rock in my hand. Traced my thumb over the sharp edges. Yes, this would do nicely. I gripped it like a two-seamer, reared back, and launched it.

A gush of blood. The kidnapper's nose exploded. I still had my fastball.

He fell back and hit his head against the ground with an echoing crack. With her mouth unobstructed, the woman screamed. From inside the prison, I heard people stirring.

The brawling woman's foot caught the pear-shaped kidnapper in the groin, and he dropped. The others let her go and turned toward me. All of them reached for their weapons. Violence inbound.

"Freeze!"

The woman saw me and nodded. Without a moment's hesitation, she kicked another agent in the back of the knee, dropping him onto his back. She slammed her foot down on his jaw, sending him to the same land my fastball victim now lived.

"Run, Suit!"

I took off in a dead sprint for the fence. I had little time to get over before the rest of the goon squad came. They were hunters, after all. The thrill of the chase is built into their DNA.

Leaping, I caught the fence halfway up and scrambled the rest of the way. In my haste, I cut my face half a dozen times on the razor wire. The metal burned as it sliced into my cheeks. I slid my hands into my sleeves and grabbed the wire through the jumpsuit. It cut through, but the fabric gave me enough cushion to get a good grip.

I was going to launch myself over the top. Or so I thought. I leaned back and tried to use my momentum to take me over the razor wire. That didn't happen. My clothes snagged, and while I flopped onto the jungle side of the fence, I was stuck.

More guards sprinted after me. The lights inside the prison turned on. Barked demands and horrified screams came bursting out. I owed it to them to get out and tell my story. I felt my resolve harden. Despite a volley of pepper balls striking my back, I formulated my escape.

I kicked off my shoes, unzipped the top of my jumpsuit, and crawled out of my clothes. My fall was brief, but the landing was rough. I just barely got my hands in front of my chest to cushion my fall. A round caught the back of my knee. The sting rippled through my leg. I faltered, but I wasn't about to let that stop me.

Through the billowing gas, I glanced up at the razor wire. My prison cocoon hanging for all to see. I was never going back. When my nearly nude body crashed on the opposite side of the fence, I'd been reborn. I was what I had always thought I'd been.

Free.

The fall had hurt, but my body was humming with adrenaline. I had to push through. The guards were rapidly approaching. There was a burst of noise, and dozens of pepper balls struck my back and the surrounding ground. Tiny volcanoes of dirt erupted around me, spewing forth the creeping orange poison.

I ran into the dark of the jungle.

I wasn't alone.

The pear-shaped man had opened the nearby gate and rushed out to chase me. His fellow goons called for him to come back, but that man needed me dead. I knew what kind of person he really was. Every time he'd see me, he'd have to reckon with his true nature. Make yourself a monster, and you kill the pain of being a man.

I was a threat to his peace of mind, and for that he needed me destroyed.

Three feet of razed land was all that separated civilization and the first tangle of the jungle. It was like bursting through a curtain from backstage. I suddenly found myself transported to a new world. Vines hung from drooping branches. Bugs hummed in giant clouds. Lizards spied me as I burst into their homes. My feet, free from their shoes, felt every plant and rock on the path in front of me, but I kept going. I splashed through the shallow water and never looked back.

The agent followed.

The dim silvery moonlight limited my vision to a few feet, but I kept running anyway. Whatever was in the tangles was less of a threat than what I left behind. I dashed along the banks of the marsh, my feet squishing into the soft soil, and tried to put as much distance between us as possible.

It wasn't easy. The deeper into the muck I got, the harder it was to move. The mangroves were thicker, their roots spread out far and wide. I glanced back momentarily to check where my pursuer was when I felt a stick of dynamite go off near my big toe.

My bare foot rammed into one of those half-submerged roots, breaking off my toenail, and sent me tumbling into the water. Branches strafed my face as my body hit the water and hydroplaned to a halt against a rotten trunk. Soggy pulp and bugs landed on my face.

Brushing away any creepy crawlies, I pulled myself up, wiped the water from my eyes, and reassessed my position. My sprint had made the prison shrink along the horizon. Even the ceaseless gunshots and screams faded away. Twenty more yards into the wetlands, and the human world was gone.

The hum of Mother Nature took over. Crickets instead of cries. Frogs instead of fear. Birds rather than bullets. Serenity at any other moment in my life.

Mosquitoes found every section of exposed skin and made a meal out of my blood. I held off swatting them away. I didn't want to risk making any sounds. Something smooth slithered across my foot, over my exposed toenail skin, and it took everything in my body not to jump. The longer I stood still, the more the natural world absorbed me. Another thread in its immense and vivid tapestry.

Maybe that's what the old man meant by the Creeping Death? You go deep enough into the wilderness, and the line between you and it blurs until you merge.

Off in the distance, I heard boots splashing in the water. The pear-shaped hunter was approaching. Unlike me, he was not trying to stay quiet. His hand smacked against his flabby skin. He spat out a string of mumbled curses and smacked again.

"I know you're out here. Give up now, and I'll go easy on you. Run, though, and we're gonna have some fun with you before it's all said and done."

I stayed quiet. My vision adjusted to the darkness. When you stilled yourself, how much the jungle moved around you became obvious. Teemed with life. A line of leaf-cutter ants marched down the tree. Tiny fish schooled in the shallows. The canopy shifted with the wind.

"Come on now, let's stop playing around. Get your ass back here so we can go back inside. I know the bugs are eating your naked ass alive."

They were. But I wouldn't let a bug be my demise. I scanned the area for a better place to hide - to wait until sunrise to get my bearings - but the wise words of the old man and the woman came back to me.

The jungle is no joke.

"If the skeeters don't chew you up, the gators will," he said, stepping near the mangrove I was hiding behind. "Or maybe a python will squeeze your head like an overripe pumpkin," the kidnapper laughed. "Less work for me, honestly."

Off in the distance, a ball of blue light bubbled up from the swampy waters and took to the air. It cast an eerie, faint blue glow on the surrounding foliage, giving everything an unnatural neon sheen. It hovered near the water for a few seconds before rising and dissipating five feet above the surface. Our awe of the fantastic was the only thing we'd ever agree to.

Another ball of light bubbled up from the water, this one closer to where the kidnapper was standing. It crackled as it ascended into the air. It spiraled up, doubling in size, before bursting. Tiny embers of light burned the last of their fuel as they collapsed back toward the water.

Near where the kidnapper stood, something massive splashed into the water. Droplets from the splash caught the last bit of dying light, making them shimmer like diamonds in the sky. The water rained on the shore, pelting the kidnapper.

"Oh fuck!" he screamed.

Six explosions rang out. The kidnapper's gun spat out yellow and orange curses. Painful growls and thrashing gave way to silence. Even after I took my fingers out of my ears, you could still hear the shots echoing through the swamps.

"Holy shit! That has to be ten feet! The guys are never gonna believe this."

I leaned against the mangrove and stared at the pear-shaped kidnapper. The sudden adrenaline spike bled out of his body, and he stumbled back some before catching himself. He doubled over, his hands on his knees, and struggled to breathe. Even in the dim moonlight, I could see the gun shaking in his hands.

"Holy shit," he said again.

Another blue ball came up from the water, rose high in the air, but didn't dissolve. It hung in the sky, casting its mysterious glow across everything in a ten-foot radius. The light put us in a trance, so much so that neither of us was aware of the figure emerging from the water at the edge of the light.

"Who's transgressed here?"

With those words, every natural noise in the jungle ceased. The rattling of the kidnapper's shaking gun and my own shallow breaths were the only things I was aware of. I shrank back behind the trunk of the mangrove, hoping to stay invisible.

The light in the sky grew more intense, and we both spotted the man. It appeared as if he was standing on the water. He raised his arms. All the nearby tree limbs followed his lead. The man interlocked his hands in front of his body. The branches corresponded with his movement, curling around the agent and creating a thicket that trapped him.

He turned to the surrounding branches and scrambled around. Wanted to run. Wanted to find safety. But he failed to find a way out of his wooden cell.

"You've brought violence to this tranquil place."

The light above us burst, and the kidnapper screamed and dropped into the water. He sat up, glanced around for an exit, but found none. He tried to stand, but his arm had sunk into the muck, and the suction made even this simple task difficult. Yanking hard, he finally freed himself from the mire.

"What's going on?" he mumbled, leaning into the nearby shadows.

The ground shook, and I let go of the mangrove. The water in front of us bubbled as if God had turned on the burners. A giant ball of blue light, more vibrant than any of the others, had shot up like a geyser, sending rays of multicolored light all around us like a disco ball. It hung ten feet in the sky. It was so bright, there was nowhere to hide.

The kidnapper was exposed.

From the same waters, a mound of undulating mud grew six feet tall. The shimmering and shaking mud coalesced into the shape of a man. A crease formed on its featureless face. When it split, two bright-blue swamp-gas eyes opened and spied the trembling kidnapper.

The Creeping Death had arrived.

It looked down at the pear-shaped kidnapper's gun before turning to the floating corpse of the crocodile he'd executed. The Creeping Death rested a hand on the dead creature's head, its blood absorbing into the mud. It changed his complexion. His whole body took on the crimson color.

"I…I was afraid for my life."

"You intruded into this creature's home, and you felt afraid?"

The Creeping Death glided toward the kidnapper. It towered over him. The kidnapper shrank back. His eyes darted for an exit, but there was nowhere to go.

"I didn't mean to hurt it," he offered, his voice cracking.

"How will you atone for this creature's death?"

"Ugh, I can tell everyone to stay…."

The Creeping Death gripped the man with its filthy hand. Crimson mud caked onto his already filthy mask. It brought its face to the kidnapper's face - its glowing blue eyes reflecting in the man's terrified gaze.

"The promises of cowards mean little to me. How will you atone for this innocent creature's death?"

"Ugh, I," he said before raising his gun and firing the remaining shots into the Creeping Death's abdomen.

The bullets sailed through the mud and lodged harmlessly into trees somewhere off in the distance.

"Oh shit," he said, dropping his gun and taking off in a full sprint right where I was hiding.

I could've let him pass. Could've let him try to escape. I looked down at my swollen wrists, and the trauma he'd inflicted came back to me. My arrest. A prison full of people he tortured. The woman's agonizing pain. Her fearful struggle.

His hatred wouldn't allow him to stop. Evil corrupts. Once you let that poison in, it seeps into your bones, alters your heart. If the kidnapper got away, he'd do those things again. Maybe worse.

I stuck out my foot.

His boot caught, and he went cartwheeled through the air. He landed hard on his vest, the bulletproof plates driving into his chest, knocking the air out of his lungs. He rolled onto his back and sucked for air. Finding it, he tried to continue his sprint, but as soon as he stood, branches curled in and blocked his path.

He found himself cornered.

"What the fuck is happening?!"

The Creeping Death glided over to where the kidnapper stood, raised his hands, and gripped the air in front of him. Two vines from the thicket shot out and wrapped around the kidnapper's arms, holding him in place. Two more grabbed his legs and pulled his body to the ground. The vines tightened, stretching out his limbs into a star shape.

With a flick of his hand, the vine lifted the starfished kidnapper to his burning blue eyes. Another crack opened where a mouth should be, dripping mud down onto the kidnapper's horrified face. "Your kind has trodden on my kind for too long."

"Please! I didn't mean it! I can fix it!"

The mud man waved his hand, and the vines drove the kidnapper back down to the ground with a skull-cracking thud. The kidnapper wheezed and tried to find his breath. He was shaking so much that all the gear he had attached to his vest rattled like a toddler's toy.

"Atonement begins with you," the Creeping Death said, its voice deep but flat.

The kidnapper screamed and cast his eyes all over, searching for any way out. In that frantic moment, he spotted me. I was trying to hide, but the light made it damn near impossible. He found my eyes, and his synapses stumbled into an uncomfortable truth: I'd been the one who tripped him. I was the reason he'd been captured. I was also his only chance for escape.

"Please! Please help me! I'm sorry for what happened, but I don't deserve this!"

"Neither did she," I said. "None of us did."

"Please! I was just doing my job! You gotta understand! It wasn't personal!"

A bone-shaking growl filled the surrounding air. The mud man dissipated into the shallows just as the snout of a twenty-five-foot crocodile emerged from the water. The kidnapper screamed and pleaded, but it was short-lived. I turned away as the crocodile took the first bite.

A minute later, silence returned.

I glanced, expecting viscera and gore, but there was nothing but a red streak of blood leading into the shallow water. I dropped to my knees, put my head in my hands, and wept. Justice, however small, had been served.

The wet gushing and bubbling of the rising mud found my ears. The crackle of the swamp gas. I lifted my hands and faced the Creeping Death. I swallowed my fear, calmed myself, and wiped away my tears.

"Why are you here?"

"He brought me here," I said, raising my face and staring into the glowing blue lights. "I don't want to be here."

"Have you come from the place where the sun doesn't set? Where the lights blind my kind?"

"The prison, yes. I was brought there. Many people were."

"By those monsters?" the Creeping Death asked, motioning toward the still swamp waters.

I nodded, and my brain kicked into gear. "I can lead you to them," I said with a small smile, "to the monsters."

"For what purpose?"

"To atone for their intrusion on your land. They plan to cut away more of the jungle. To drain the swamps. To bring more people here."

For the first time since my kidnapping, I felt like myself again. No, not myself. That man died within those walls. I'd become something more now. Something righteous in a land of sin.

Without speaking a word, the Creeping Death removed the thickets behind me. Millions of fireflies formed a lit path for me to travel. It led all the way back to the edge of the prison.

"You'll leave us be?" I asked.

"What kind of beast kills innocents?"

I nodded. "There are more like him beyond the prison," I said, nodding at where the pear-shaped man had met his demise. "They'll keep coming unless they're stopped."

"Then I will stop them all," the Creeping Death said, before melting back down into the water.

I ran through the bug-illuminated tunnel until I reached the fence. They had corralled every prisoner outside. Masked guards screamed and menaced the prisoners with rifles. Some fired shots into the woods to send a message. Little did they know, their messages had been received.

I stepped onto the razed land. I saw Marco and the woman. Saw the families and the children. The cowards and their deadly weapons.

"Freeze! Don't move or we'll fucking kill you!"

I smiled. "Everyone, whatever you do, don't look at what's about to happen."

"Shut the fuck up! Hands in the…."

A rumble shook the ground. From the depths of the jungle, green vines snaked along the ground and curled around the fence. With little effort, the Creeping Death yanked down the walls.

I didn't see what was growing behind me, but as everyone's eyes moved high above my head, it told me whatever had emerged from the emerald green jungle wasn't messing around.

"Everyone," I yelled, a smile on my face as big as the country I call home, "Justice has arrived."
