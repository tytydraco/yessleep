Abigal and I grew up together. We’ve always been incredibly close. When my mother went to work on the plantations for extended periods of time Abigal was always there for me. We took care of one another. Abigal required a lot of care and attention. Sometimes the care had me burnt out especially when she was sick. But, whenever I needed a friend to talk to or a quick snuggle, Abigal was there. 

My mother adopted Abigal when I was a toddler. Abigal was just born and needed a home. My father had just died; I think my mom decided to take in Abigal to fill the void she was feeling. Being a single mother of two it was not surprising that my mother struggled to feed both Abigal and me. She often worked several jobs to make ends meet. Sometimes she would disappear for weeks at a time to work on local plantations, traveling from one to another. While she was away Abigal and I had only one another to depend on. I was responsible for keeping the small shack we resided in clean. Abigal oversaw hunting and gathering food. Abigal was incredibly greedy and often I was left to hunt and gather my own food in addition to my many other chores.  

It was incredibly frustrating providing for us both while my mother was working so I decided to sneak out during the day leaving young Abigal home alone. I picked up jobs around the village, mostly in the fish markets. The pay was low but often the fishermen took pity on me and sent me home with enough fish to cook dinner for myself and fish for Abigal. I’d get home and Abigal would pout for the remainder of the day because I left her home alone. It was a vicious circle of fighting for my independence and appeasing Abigal. 

The last time I saw my mother she had just returned home from a long harvest. The owners of the plantations promised double wages if the harvest quotas were exceeded. The owners lied. My mother worked until she was thin and frail. From behind she could be mistaken for a small child. Her raggy clothes hung from her small frame, her cheeks sank in on themselves. It was hard to see my mother in such a pitiful state. She crawled into bed and laid there for days.  I fed her as she once fed me as an infant. Careful small bites of fish puree. Much of it fell from her dehydrated lips onto her chin, chest, and clothes. When I attempted to clean her, she pushed my hands away defiantly muttering “leave me child – let me sleep”. The exhaustion in her voice pained me. I gathered her some drinking water and dry crackers, leaving them on the bed side and she fell into a deep sleep.

To make her proud I decided to head to the fish market to work extra shifts. To earn the money the plantation workers had promised her. I did not return home for three days. When I returned home, my mother was not there. The water I had left was gone and the crackers were nibbled at. It was a relief that she had eaten and drank before returning to the plantation to work. A part of me was disappointed that she went back to work so soon. I wanted her to rest, and I wanted to show her all the monies I earned at the market for her. She did not come back home. Not that night, or the night after.

I think my mother’s absence really impacted Abigal as she refused to come out from her hiding spot under mother’s bed. Usually, mother would stay for at least a week after a large harvest like this. Abigal and I were both feeling the pain of her absence. Not only was I worried about mother, but I started to get really worried about Abigal too. All the fish I bring home for Abigal has been spoiling near the bed. She wasn’t eating or drinking.  She wouldn’t even let me pull her out from under the bed to cuddle. Most nights Abigal would slide into bed alongside me, especially if mother was away. But, for some reason she refused to come out from under the bed.

It's been five days since my mother left for the plantations again.  I fear she won’t return home after seeing her so sick. I am not sure how she gathered the strength to even leave her bed let alone return to work.  I can’t get this panging thought from the back of my mind that something terrible has happened to my mother.  The days working at the fish market are long and gruelling now. I come home covered in fish oils and fish guts. The worry for my mother’s safety has caused me intense stress.  Every day I race home hoping to find a letter from her or better yet to find her back in her bed. So far, I’ve been disappointed.

Once again Abigal has not eaten the food I’ve left out. It’s been five days without a meal, and I am worried about her health. Tomorrow if she does not eat, I will phone the village doctor.  It feels selfish but I am too tired to put much more thought into it. I collapse into the small bed atop where Abigal is hiding.  Wish her goodnight through the thin mattress and surrender to sleep.

The sensation of Abigal moving along the cot beside me stirs me awake. A smile spreads across my lips as I feel her press up against me heavily. Finally, a cuddle from the mysterious Abigal. She casually places her head on my shoulder and stretches her body along mine. I sigh, a deep sigh, of relief and surrender back to sleep.

Panic. Something is not right. I open my eyes wide to see Abigal hugging me tighter than usual.  She has wrapped herself around me while I was sleeping.  She is clinging to me, pinning my arms to my sides. My legs are in a vice, it is difficult to breathe. I can’t speak, my voice is caught in my throat. I hear one of my ribs crack in two, then another rib, and another. I try to fight back but Abigal rolls me from my back to my side with ease. Abigal hugs me tighter.

On the floor beside the bed, I see my mother.  Or should I say what is left of mother. Her entire body is smeared with a glossy wetness. She looks distorted as if something has broken every bone in her body. Her skin looks bright red as if the first few layers have been melted off.  My mother, my sweet mother, lays on the floor lifeless in a puddle of snake vomit. Abigal ate my mother, her mother. I guess she didn't like how she tasted. Because now she is preparing to eat me.
