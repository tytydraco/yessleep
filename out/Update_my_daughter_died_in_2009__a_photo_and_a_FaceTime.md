I didn’t sleep last night.

I don’t really know why. There was no buzzing at 3:16 a.m. No voicemail. No message. Nothing at all.

You’d think I’d feel relief.

But instead, I felt hollow. Like something was missing — or worse, waiting.

I sat in bed, phone in my hand, screen lit. Nothing came. No notification, no blocked number, no whisper of her voice. Just the glow of the lock screen and the steady tick of the clock beside my bed.

And yet, the dread didn’t go away.

This morning, when I stepped out onto the porch, I found something on the doormat.

A single Polaroid photo.

No envelope. No note. No sign that anyone had even been near the house.

Just the photo.

I stared at it for a long time before I picked it up. Something about it made my stomach twist, like I already knew what would be on it. Like I’d already seen it before — maybe in a dream I’d forgotten or a memory I never wanted to have.

It was a picture of Emma’s bike. The one she was riding when she died.

Except the photo wasn’t old — it wasn’t from that day. I know, because the grass in the background still has the bare patches I reseeded just a few weeks ago. My neighbor’s car is in the driveway. The garbage bin is tipped the same way it was yesterday morning when the wind knocked it over.

It was recent.

The bike was propped on its kickstand at the edge of the road, right where the accident happened. The back wheel was bent. The seat was torn — exactly as I remember it after the crash.

But we don’t have that bike anymore. We buried it. Along with her.

I checked the spot.

Nothing there.

No tire tracks. No bike. No photo prints anywhere else.

Just grass and silence and the faint smell of rain that never came.

Inside, I set the photo on the table and stared at it for hours. I couldn’t touch it again. My fingers itched to flip it, but I was scared of what might be there. Finally, I did.

The back was blank — except for two words, written faintly in pencil.

Not printed. Written.

In her handwriting.

“I remember.”

That broke something in me.

I don’t know if I’m supposed to remember something… or if she does. Something I buried deeper than her jacket or the sealed boxes in the attic. Something I don’t want pulled into the light.

I want to believe it’s her.

God, I want to believe it’s her so badly it hurts.

But a memory doesn’t knock on your door. It doesn’t whisper through phone lines. It doesn’t dig up a rusted bike and pose it like an offering.

And tonight, at exactly 3:16 a.m., my phone buzzed again.

Not a voicemail.

A FaceTime call.

From her number.

And for one second — just before I declined it — the thumbnail preview showed something behind me.

Something smiling.
