It was August 21st, 2017, and the future was...  


...Dark. Literally dark.  


That day, the first total solar eclipse visible from anywhere in the mainland United States since February, 1979, which some media outlets were calling “The Great American Eclipse,” was due to cast its shadow over America.  


And it just so happened, that my city, and the surrounding area, would be in the path of totality that afternoon, putting us in its umbra - its darkest shadow, and allowing us to witness the moon completely block the sun and reveal its corona.  


"You packed light." My best friend Josh pointed out to me that morning, gesturing to my obviously lightly packed backpack, as we walked from the parking lot to the trail.  


"Don't these things only last a few minutes?" I replied, having only barely researched the lunar event.  


But why should I have? After all, it had been Josh's brilliant idea, to propose to his girlfriend, Allison, during the total eclipse, and bring me along for the ride to take photographs, aka third wheel.  


As a city guy, I never had any desire to go hiking in the wilderness, and had been dreading the trip ever since he told me about it. But Josh had been my best friend since elementary school, and had done more than enough favors for me over the years. So, I just swallowed my pride and went along with it.  


"They're saying about two and half minutes from where we are, specifically." Allison corrected.  


*She's always been the best kind of nerd.* I thought to myself, enviously.  


But I tried not to make eye contact with her. There was too much history there, too many emotions. And on top of all that, she and Josh were about to get engaged.  


"Got it." I replied, staring down at my feet, as I trudged along the rocky path, my boots crunching into the ground with every step.  


*What were you thinking? Agreeing to this?* I internally kicked myself, immediately regretting the decision.  


"You okay?" Josh asked. "You were pretty quiet in the car."  


"Yeah, I'm okay, thanks."  


I was not okay. But what was I supposed to say? "I'm still in love with your future wife?"  


*Let's take these photos and get the fuck out of here.* I thought to myself, before sneaking a few shots of Josh and Allison holding hands, as they walked ahead of me, careful to not make Allison suspicious, and while also throwing up in my mouth a little bit.  


—  


But when we finally made it to the summit of the hill, where Josh had chosen to host the two-pronged occasion, I was pleasantly surprised to discover, that I was not third wheeling after all.  


There, sitting side by side in beach chairs, each with a beer in hand, were Bob and Cara, a married couple that Josh and I had befriended at a bar one night a couple months prior, and, in a very short amount of time, had completely infiltrated our friend group.  


"There they are!" Bob called out.  


"Eclipse party!" Cara yelled out even louder.  


"At least I have other people to talk to." I mumbled to myself, before turning to Josh and asking, "You didn't tell me Bob and Cara were joining?"  


"Thought I'd surprise you." He said, with a cheeky smile.  


"Theme of the day." I replied sarcastically, before immediately heading for the cooler, opening it, and reaching into its deepest depths, for the coldest beer I could possibly find.  


But after I removed a bottle, and opened it with my keychain, I looked down, and happened to notice, that my finger was bleeding.  


I didn't think much of it, so I just held up my bloody finger to the group. "Hey, anybody got a bandage?"  


"Already?" Josh teased, shaking his head, "We can't take you anywhere."  


"Take him anywhere?" Allison chimed in, "I blame Bob and Cara. What kind of weapons are you keeping down there, at the bottom of your cooler?"  


The married couple simply sat there in silence for a moment, before turning to each other, then back at us, and bursting out laughing.  


"Got us!" Cara said.  


"Busted!" Bob added, before Josh tossed me the first aid kit and pivoted the conversation.  


"Speaking of Bob and Cara. I just want to shout them out, for coming up with the eclipse party idea in the first place."  


Everyone raised their beers, and cheered, as I wrapped a bandage around my finger.  


*Fucking Bob and Cara.* I thought to myself, as I faked a smile and raised my bottle.  


—  


A few hours, and a lot of beers later, we were all sitting at the top of the hill, doing as friends do, and bantering about absolutely nothing of actual significance, when Bob looked down at his watch, and made an announcement.  


"Ladies and gentlemen, the moment we've all been waiting for has finally arrived!" He declared, slurring his words a bit.  


"Everyone, get your sunglasses!" Cara added, as she stumbled over to her backpack, and removed five pairs of cardboard sunglasses, specifically made for looking at eclipses, or so they claimed in the ads.  


We all put them on...  


...And looked up at the sky...  


...But nothing happened.  


Then, Josh lowered his sunglasses and started winking profusely at me.  


"Oh, right!" I said, before reaching for my camera and pointing it at Josh, just in time to catch him getting down on one knee, removing a ring from his pocket, and holding it out to Allison.  


At first, she was completely confused, and looked around at everyone, as if to ask, "What's going on?"  


But then Josh uttered the words, "Allison, you're the love of my life... The apple of my eye... The moon to my sun."  


Allison, Bob, and Cara all chuckled at the timeliness of the joke a bit, but I couldn't bring myself to laugh at it. I just stood there, hiding behind my camera, snapping photos, hoping it would end quickly.  


*Just get it over with already.*  


"Will you marry me?" Josh asked, to a dramatic pause, before Allison finally replied.  


"Oh my! Yes! Of course I will!"  


And like that, Josh placed the ring on her finger, hopped up, and the two kissed, still wearing their sunglasses, just as the moon began to eclipse the sun.  


I snapped one last photo, which I'll admit, was pretty beautiful, before I couldn't bear to take it anymore, and had to put my camera down.  


And that's when, things got...  


...Weird.  


As the moon continued to pass in front of the sun, the sky grew darker and darker, and, in combination with the eclipse sunglasses that I was still wearing, caused me to lose visibility.  


Suddenly, I felt what I assumed was a raindrop...  


...Before realizing that rain would have been impossible, given the clear visibility of the eclipse that day.  


I removed my sunglasses, and whipped around, to see what the droplet could possibly have been, only to witness a gruesome sight...  


...Bob, dimly lit, being hacked away at, by a shadowy figure holding a strange object...  


...Blood spraying everywhere.  


*That's not rain.*  


It must have happened so fast, that Bob never even had a chance to scream.  


But Cara, on the other hand, had a chance.  


She immediately began wailing and crying at the top of her lungs, so loud that Josh and Allison were jarred out of their loving embrace, and began calling out to her.  


"Cara?" Josh yelled out.  


"What's wrong?" Allison added.  


But then...  


...Cara went silent.  


I tried to will myself to warn Josh and Allison, to shout out, "Run!" but I was so paralyzed with fear, that I couldn't bring myself to utter the word.  


So, I just followed my own advice, and darted away as fast as I could, knowing that whoever had just killed Bob, and seemingly now Cara, was close by.  


But before I could get far, I heard what sounded like Josh grappling with the shadowy figure, and immediately stopped in my tracks.  


I turned around, and tried to make out what was happening, against the sky, but it was still pretty dark, and the only thing I could see, was the glowing corona of the sun encircling the moon, the total eclipse now at its peak.  


"Get away from her!" Josh cried out, before I saw what looked like him charge at the man.  


But something must have gone terribly wrong, as the next, and last word, I ever heard out of Josh's mouth, was "No!"  


As the moon began to move out of the total eclipse, and pass by the sun, enough light began to pour in, that I was able to see my best friend's body tumble to the ground.  


And then...  


...Silence...  


...Until I heard Allison begin to scream.  


"Help! Help!"  


Now able to see her, dimly lit, and cowering in fear on the ground a few feet away from me, I jumped in front of her.  


For a brief moment, we locked eyes, in what felt like four parts horror, one part longing, before we both looked back and saw, now fully illuminated....  


...The slayer that had just wreaked havoc on our party, his face and body, covered in blood, his hands gripping what I now saw... was a scythe.  


*A fucking scythe!?*  


He slowly began to approach us, weapon in hand...  


...Until he got a few feet away...  


...And suddenly stopped, to look up at the moon...  


...But it was gone.  


In the moment that followed, he appeared to process what that meant, and what to do next, before...  


...He simply turned around and walked away.  


Allison and I sat there on the ground, shaking violently, as we clung to each other, paralyzed with fear, and watched him drift away into the distance...  


...Until he was gone.  


When we eventually conjured enough energy to stand up, we hobbled back to the parking lot, and drove Josh's car, to the closest police station we could find, remaining silent almost the entire time.  


And after finally arrived at the precinct, it took us a good while to bring ourselves to speak, and describe to the authorities, the atrocities that had occurred in the shadow of the eclipse that day.  


The cops immediately raced to the trail, and recovered the bodies of Bob, Cara, and Josh, but the man with the scythe...  


...The eclipse killer, as the detectives joked...  


...Was never found, left to roam the world and live amongst us, likely waiting to strike when the next eclipse arrives.  


And as for Allison and I... while the events of that day could just as well have bonded us, or been taken as a sign that we were meant to be together, we never talked about it again, and slowly drifted away...  


...Just as the moon had drifted away from the sun on the afternoon of August 21st, 2017.  


Still to this day, whenever I hear that an eclipse of any sort is coming, I think back to that hike, and worry for those who dare to venture out of their homes to observe it.  


While, I, however... stay the fuck inside.
