It was a hot summer day, I could now spend more time at home without worrying about school. My dad knocked on my door.

"Knock, knock" came from the door.

"Come in" I said, pausing my video game.

My dad walked in.

"Hey, Tilly, I just wanted to let you know that me and your mom are going out on a date night, if you want to invite friends, you can, just don't make a mess" he told me.

This news excited me, I was thinking of having a sleepover with some of my best friends. I had never gone to a sleepover or slumber party, but there is a first time for everything. So I picked up my phone and texted my friends group chat.

Me: "Hey, guys, wanna have a sleepover at my place tomorrow night?"

Carl: "Sure, I don't have anything planned"

5 minutes later...

Allison: "Would love to! I'm packing right now!"

Ivor: "Sure, why not"

10 minutes later...

Jarmaine: "Sorry guys, I got plans tomorrow night, won't be able to make it, send a vid of it to me tho"

I was happy I was able to get most of my best friends, I wish Jarmaine could come, she knows how to have fun. But I wasn't gonna let that stop me.

30 minutes later...

I was playing some more of my video game, but I decided to stop playing, I was gonna go to bed early and wake up late so I would be able to stay up all night for the sleepover.

I ruffled through my drawers and found a pair of pajama pants and a baggy t-shirt I got from Hot Topic. After getting in my pajamas I turned my little lamp on, my lights off, and grabbed my favorite book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers (Philosophers) Stone.

After reading for a bit I put my bookmark in, turned my light off, and got comfy in my bed.

I didn't know how much time had passed, but I woke up to heavy breathing and running outside my window. My window is on the second story, so it had to be loud for me to hear.

I opened the curtains and peaked out to my backyard.

The flower bed I planted last summer was ruined. Most of the flowers were crushed. Usually I would think this was an animal, but there were huge footprints.

The footprints were from large bare feet, this was no animal, no person, this was some kind of cryptid.

I was freaked out, I just tried to forget about it, but I was too scared and sad to fall asleep.

Before I knew it, I was asleep. I woke up and went down to the kitchen.

My parents were preparing french toast and scrambled eggs.

"Sleep well?" my mom asked.

I didn't want to scare her by telling her about the strange creature I saw, so I just told her that I did.

I texted my friends, watched TV, played videos, and anything that I could do to pass time. And before I knew it, it was 8:00 pm and my parents left.

"Remember, don't make a mess" my dad told me, and they were in the truck, and drove off in minutes.

Pretty soon Ivor and Allison showed up in their pajamas with their backpacks.

"Hey, Tilly" Ivor said.

"Where's Carl?" I asked, looking around the outside to see any trace of him.

Both Ivor and Allison didn't know, I hoped the weird creature wasn't responsible for his disappearance.

We played some CoD and Minecraft on my Playstation 5, before we heard loud, violent, and desperate banging on the door. We all flinched and stopped what we were doing.

"W...what was that?" Ivor whispered.

"Is someone in trouble?" Allison asked, mortified.

"We should investigate" I suggested.

"Are you crazy?" Ivor whispered loudly.

"We don't know who- AH!" Allison was cut off by even louder banging.

We decided to all go down together with my baseball bat, a frying pan, and a large kitchen knife.

Allison opened the door, trembling. Behind the door was Carl, he looked terrified, his blonde hair was now littered with leaves and grass, his hoodie was torn.

"Carl, what happened to you?" We all exclaimed.

"I was chased by some weird tall creature, I had to run through the forest and I found your house, Til" Carl said in a breathless, scared voice.

"Get in the house, NOW!" I erupted.

We all sprinted up the stairs into my room, locked the door.

"Have any of you seen or faced this creature?" Carl asked us, taking off his old, torn hoodie to reveal his blue pajamas.

"I saw large footprints on my flowerbed" I told everyone.

"Now that you mention it, I have been seeing some tall humanoid in the forest" Ivor told us.

"I have heard large footsteps around my house" Allison told us.

I was comforted and also even more scared, comforted because I knew I wasn't alone or crazy, and scared because this confirms some creature was in this town.

I turned on the TV and there was an emergency alert.

"WARNING: THERE IS A LARGE, PALE, HUMANOID CREATURE ROAMING THE TOWN, IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT THE NON-EMERGENCY NUMBER" The TV screen displayed, confirming, we were in danger.

All of us closed and locked every door and window, got weapons and food and hid under my bed, it was a full size, so we could all fit comfortably underneath.

After awhile, the sun was supposed to rise, but the full moon was still out.

We heard large footsteps outside the house, along with heavy breathing.

It was here.
