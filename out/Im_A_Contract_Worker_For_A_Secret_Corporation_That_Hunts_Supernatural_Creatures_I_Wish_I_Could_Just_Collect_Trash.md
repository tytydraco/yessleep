[Previous ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gwn7zt/im_a_contract_worker_for_a_secret_corporation/)

Sometimes if two people accept a contract job, the pay gets split. I was a little weary going through with a request after I heard another person was going to be with me. When I heard who I would be working with I pushed aside any concerns about money.   

There had been disappearances and odd sightings inside a large forest. Our job was to simply discover the cause. I arrived at the start of a hiking trail ready to have an easy day for once. I found my partner for the day and I couldn’t hold back a smile from seeing him again.   

Ito met me with a wicker basket tied to his waist. He held a plastic grabbing tool in one hand. A basket and another grabber were at his feet ready for me to pick up. I didn’t understand the purpose of the items. It was nice to see a friendly face though. But what was an Agent doing taking contract work? I had always thought the contract jobs were ones The Corporation didn’t have time to deal with.  

“What’s with those?” I asked as I mimicked the grabby claw.   

“We’re picking up trash.” He half explained.   

There was a snack wrapper at his feet. The wind blew more trash in our direction. He swiftly picked them up as I tightened my coat. The trees were bare, and the breeze was a bit too cold for my liking. He placed the trash inside his basket. I picked up the grabber and tied my basket to my hip.  

“What does The Corporation want trash for?”   

“Recently a Doll Maker discovered a way to make flames that produce magic. It's a small amount but any little bit counts. Anything we place inside these baskets will go directly to be burned aside from living creatures, metal, and glass. Oh, and rocks, I think. So be careful not to place anything important inside.”  

Ito started walking down the pathway. I was glad it wasn’t camping season because people would have stared at a man wearing a suit picking up trash.   

“So, we can’t put glass, metal, and rocks inside?” I asked.  

“You can. The glass and metal get sent to a different place to be recycled. I'm not sure what happens to the rocks. They may be sent to the recycling center because only things that can burn get sent to the fire. I guess don’t send too many rocks through to upset the recycling workers. Oh, and they’ll be paying us a dollar per five pounds of burnable trash we send through.”  

I stopped in my tracks. Ito looked confused but he didn’t press me to keep going until I recovered. Would they really pay me for some garbage? There were so few wrappers and such along the trail. For once, I wanted to see litter.  

“Can we take these baskets home?” I said hopeful.   

“Actually, yes.”  

The thoughts of the missing people and any sort of danger in this forest disappeared for a while. I would protect this basket with my life. Finally, I seemed to find an easy way of making money. Not much, but how hard was it to just pick up trash? I now knew what I would be doing when I couldn’t find suitable contract work.  

“Sorry, I’ve only been asking about work even though we haven’t seen each other in a while.” I told Ito.  

He waved off my words. We had sent each other a few messages since we met but with our busy lives, we hadn’t been in contact much. Somehow, even though we barely knew each other we acted like old friends.  

“Do you have any ideas about what we should be looking for in this forest? I’ve heard that you’ve done jobs like this for a few years before your break. You may have more experience than I do.”  

I had been too distracted by the easy money to think about the real reason why we were here. I frowned unsure of how I felt about Ito asking around about me. He appeared young but looks could be misleading when it came to supernatural creatures. I studied him for a moment and assumed he was most likely telling the truth that I may be stronger than him. It was an odd feeling.   

Agents that had worked for a while carried a certain air about them. Even though Klaus acted kinder than most, I could tell he had a great deal of experience.   

“I’m not sure. There aren’t too many hints about what it could be. Let me feel things out for a moment.”  

He didn’t appear to understand what I meant but nodded. I took a few minutes to really look at my surroundings. The forest felt strange in a way I couldn’t place. It was cold and empty but not because of the season. I didn’t hear any animals. Not even a bird moved in the trees. I bent down to feel the cold ground with my palm trying to get a feel for what this forest was like. Each had a different vibe. There was a healthy amount of unseen magic around. Perfect for creatures to enjoy. But the air felt almost damp. A hint of a musty rotten smell that didn’t suit the rest of the surroundings hung in the air.  

“The animals are spooked. I don’t hear any, and there is a weird smell coming from somewhere.” I told him even though it didn’t help us much.  

“That’s impressive. Since my body is different from yours, I’ll need to rely on your senses. My eyesight and hearing are on the same level as a human, but I have no sense of taste or smell.”  

That explained a little why he was helping on a contract job like this. Ito was a weaker Agent. Simple jobs like this may be the only thing he could live through.   

I stood back up ready to keep moving. We started walking down the trail talking about what we had been doing since we first met. After a while of walking, I noticed a small path off to the side of a large tree. It wasn’t an official trail. Rather something a handful of people created over time. I nodded so Ito would come with me to see what was deeper in the woods.   

I stopped a few steps in wondering how we could mark our way so we wouldn’t get lost. Ito solved that problem by showing me an almost invisible thread coming from his sleeve he attracted to the large tree we started from. I reached over to feel the thread only to have my hand go through it. It was made of pure magic so it wouldn’t get tangled as we walked.  

The path ended at a rundown RV parked in the middle of the woods. It looked like it had been rotting out here for at least thirty years. From the beer bottles and cans scattered around the site, it appeared this was a popular place for teens to hang out. I bet a road had once led here at some point but had been overgrown over the years. The mystery of the random RV could have spawned local legends. The musty smell in the air had gotten heavier but this place didn’t have anything overly strange about it.  

Ito picked up a beer can with his grabber, but I spoke up to stop him from putting it inside the basket.   

“The cans are worth a nickel each. Can you put them aside so I could grab them later?” I suggested.  

There might be a whole five dollars in cans and bottles just lying around. Ito made an expression I wasn’t too fond of.   

“The Corporation will pay you the full value of any cans or bottles we send through. I’ll send you my share of what I collect as well. Are you really hurting that much for the money that cans are worth picking up?”  

I looked away trying to avoid his eye contact. Even if I didn’t have a massive debt to pay off, it wasn’t as if I ever had a chance of getting a normal well-paying job.  

Ito pulled out a set of latex gloves so we could dig around to pick up more trash hidden under leaves and dirt. He crouched beside me wondering if he insulted me with a question I hadn’t answered.  

“Why don’t you become an Agent? Despite being human, you’re more qualified than I am.”  

I shook my head. After living my life so directly entangled with the supernatural, I’d seen a lot of things I understood and yet didn’t agree with. I kept looking around cleaning up cans and bottles trying to get my words in order. Ito was an Agent, and I didn’t want to insult his job.  

“I don’t agree with how The Corporation treats their Agents. They work them to the bone and treat them as more of a disposable resource. And don’t send me any money you might make from collecting trash today. You earned it. I don’t like taking things for free.”  

He frowned at my answer, also trying to think of a response. I got up to head inside the RV looking for anything else to dispose of. Some newer yet somewhat dirty blankets were laid out inside. This place was more than just a place for teenagers to hang out to drink. I wanted it to send the blanket off to be burned but I didn’t want to touch it even while wearing gloves.  

“I don’t mind the work. I just wish I could be more useful.”   

I turned to face Ito in the small dark space. A tight smile appeared on his face as he grasped his hands together in front of himself. He didn’t look like an Agent. At that moment I didn’t believe he belonged in that suit.   

“The Corporation isn’t all that bad. They provide everything I need.” He said while fidgeting with his hands.  

“They cover medical and housing costs as well as spending money for anything else you may need. But they only seem to hire the kinds of creatures who don’t mind dying for the job. People like a friend of mine are forced into this against their will.. If you keep doing this job, you won’t last long.”  

I knew of far too many Agents that died in the line of duty. I've had this same conversation a few times and each Agent said the same thing Ito repeated.  

“If I can save people then it’s worth it.”  

I walked over to him to take hold of his gloved hands with my own.   

“You’re not a resource.”  

He opened his mouth to respond but quickly closed it. No one had ever told him he was better than being an Agent. If that’s what he truly wanted to do, then I wouldn’t be opposed to his choices. I'd just seen far too many people doing the same job because they assumed it was their only option. Most had been raised to be Agents. A creature to fight against others, nothing more. Never allowed to develop their own goals. I knew The Corporation was important. The world would end within the week if it was to suddenly shut down. I didn’t claim to have a better idea of how to deal with the issue of supernatural creatures living alongside humans. We were oil and water in most cases. Most creatures saw us as a food source. Others had such a different culture we could never understand. And yet, we still lived together without most humans being aware. A lot of good people died to keep it that way.  

Ito gripped my hands back, gears moving in his head.  

“What do you really want out of life?” I asked him.  

His cheeks turned a shade of pink even though he tried to keep his face neutral. His feet shuffled and when he looked back up a realization hit me. I’d been far too dense to notice it sooner. Ito wasn’t here because he was a weaker Agent that could only do easy contract work. He was here because he wanted to work with me. His offer to date when we first met had slipped my mind until that moment.   

“I am proud of my job... But I also like little moments like this.” He admitted.  

Oh no. He was cute.  

I found his face almost creepy when we first met. I didn’t think he would be my type, but the slight blush did it for me.  

“I feel something.” I said and looked over his shoulder at the dirty window.  

At first, he misunderstood what I had said. The mood shifted as he pulled away, body tense waiting for the threat. I’d been so focused on our talk I hadn’t been paying attention to anything else. Something had snuck up on us. It was just outside the RV, then whatever it was started crawling on the roof. My hand went to the knife I kept at my side. I caught Ito’s gaze, and he nodded ready to fight.  

I jumped out the door the moment a dark figure appeared upside down through the open doorway. I took the creature with me. We crashed to the forest floor outside, and I sank the blade deep into the monster’s eye. Ito came charging out after me. Another monster came down from the trees and I lost track of him.  

The creature was blurry. It was tall with long arms, but I simply couldn’t focus on what it looked like for some unknown reason.  

I stood still, knife in my hand at the ready. For a second, it felt like I was falling even though my feet were firmly placed on the ground. The musty rotten smell became overpowering.  

A scream tore through the trees. The creature in front of me didn’t move. I let myself look away to see a horrible sight that I never wanted to experience. Three more of those creatures had ambushed Ito in such a short amount of time. He was pinned on the ground, the blurred shapes tearing through his arms, legs, and stomach. My mouth became dry as one of them raised a blood-soaked mouth, and pulled out a bloody organ from the younger Agent.  

Wait, bloody? Something wasn’t right. Fear threatened to overtake my mind, but I forced myself to think. I’d seen Ito missing an arm before. There was no blood. Just a hollow space where it had been. His body was different. And there should be no way these things should have easily been able to rip through his suit. Agents wore suits that offered powerful magic protection. I wasn’t feeling enough magic from these monsters to make a dent in the suit fabric.   

I jabbed the tip of the knife into my thigh just enough to make myself bleed. The pain me snap into a different scene.  

I was against the RV, a creature in front of me with its mouth wide open. I stabbed the knife into its temple, killing it before it realized I had woken up. The thing was at least eight feet tall with dark dirty orange fur. It almost appeared like a long thin orangutan. And it smelled putrid.   

My body felt drained. I didn’t have the strength to pull the blade out of the creature’s skull. My eyesight started to grow hazy as my body just wanted to sleep again. I held my breath because of the smell and found the tiredness somewhat went away.  

My guess was these creatures gave off some sort of gas that put their victims into a nightmare. Once they were out, they drained their life force dry. The moment I recovered enough strength I took back the knife to cut off a piece of my shirt. I wrapped it around my mouth and nose trying to block out the smell even by a slight amount. It helped a little.  

I needed to find Ito. My legs were weak, but I refused to rest any longer. I didn’t see him near the RV. That was until I looked up.  

There were more monsters in the trees. Since Ito had no sense of smell, he wasn’t in danger of being put to sleep. But they still had claws and teeth to try and rip him apart. None of them could get close enough to do so.   

His body moved around gracefully using more magic threads. He was able to control them so well to keep himself airborne but also to catch the creatures trying to attack him. The threads sliced through their flesh with ease.   

Weaker Agent my ass. Some of the creatures were trying to get away. He wasn’t able to catch all of them. He let a few flee as he landed next to me.  

“I don’t know what those monsters are. I think we should call for backup.” He said and sounded much different than before.  

He was an Agent. I now did not doubt that. I was ready to follow his lead. If things went right for us, we should have gotten out of that forest and got more Agents to help. But when do things ever go right for me?  

The ground under our feet shook. A loud crack echoed through the trees and a blast of magic rippled through the area. It hit Ito hard and knocked him off his feet. My stomach sank because I knew that this all were signs off, but I'd never experienced such an event up close before.   

If what I thought just happened, then that meant the entire world was in danger. Things had escalated from a few unknown creatures to something there was no way we could deal with.  

I helped Ito to his feet, and we silently agreed on what to do. He sent a quick message asking for backup as he ran towards what very well might be our deaths.  

The air had grown so heavy it was affecting Ito. It looked like he could barely stay standing by the time we arrived at the source of the danger.   

There are other worlds besides our own. It's the reason why The Corporation was so busy. They’re dealing with who knows how many different realities. Normally it was impossible to travel between worlds without using an insane amount of magic. Sometimes different realities bump into our own. If there is a weak spot, a tear will appear.   

The different worlds can be an almost exact copy of our own with one simple difference. Like there is no such thing as ice cream or something along those lines. Or the other worlds can be so different not even Lovecraft could describe them.   

It was just our luck a tear appeared and opened into another world filled with darkness. The air spilling outwards from the five-foot-long rip was disgusting on every level. It took everything I had to stay standing, and we were at least ten feet away from the thing.  

Fear rippled through my body as I watched more of those monsters come falling out from the tear. They must have been slowly coming through for a while until the stress became too much and the rip opened wider. Unless this was closed, it would keep opening and eventually overtake the planet. The Corporation had Agents that could deal with rips between worlds, but how long would it take for them to arrive?  

I held the handle of my blade tight in my hand ready to fight. It was the only thing I could do. The rip was too high up for me to even try to close it. I doubted I could do anything even if it was closer. The pure magic coming from the torn edges was enough to burn away my flesh in seconds if I touched it.   

A lanky creature came for us, and I wasted no time taking it down. I knew to carefully breathe around them so as not to be forced into a nightmare. They weren’t expecting us to fight back. That element of surprise wouldn’t last long.  

Ito moved his hands as I saw glimpses of the magic threads flying in the air towards the rip. The ends are attached to the torn rippling edges. He then crossed his arms to pull as hard as he could on the threads. His efforts made the tear slightly move. He took a step forward, using all the strength in his body to close the opening by another inch.  

I heard terrible creaking sounds come from him as the strain was clearly too much. He still pushed forward ready to break himself apart if that meant holding the rip back long enough for others to arrive. I couldn’t help him aside from keeping the monsters away.  

I fought just as hard as Ito. The claws caught my side tearing apart a jacket I really liked. The basket at my hip was shredded as more claws got too close. I lost track of how long we fought for. It could have been a few seconds to a few minutes. Then the worst happened. Another burst of magic came from the opening above us.  

I knocked all of us down, monsters and all. But since Ito had been directly connected to the source, he had been hit the hardest. I sat up and saw his limp body on the ground slightly smoking from the blast. Everything hurt and yet I rushed over to him. I’d dropped my knife somewhere which was a problem for future me to deal with. I considered grabbing him and running.  

I soon realized that wasn't an option. The rip had widened enough for me to see the world beyond it.   

It was dark, so damn dark. And something was moving in that darkness. A creature so terrifying the monsters around us cowered. An oppressive force came down on me as whatever was behind that opening noticed my existence. I thought I was going to crumble from the sheer dread of having an unseen gaze in my direction.  

I grounded myself by holding Ito even tighter. I needed to get us out of here. I needed to think. My body shook as my brain refused to work.  

Ito was down for the count. There were too many monsters around us for me to fight by myself even if I had a weapon. Something that was practically a God was looking at me from a different reality that was threatening to destroy our own. Even if more Agents arrived right that second, I doubted they would be powerful enough to deal with all this. I could count on the one hand creatures that work for The Corporation that were strong enough to take on this darkness, and they wouldn’t arrive because of a request for help from a weaker Agent like Ito.  

What the hell could I do? Just let us die?   

Think, think God damn it!  

Another rumble echoed through the trees as the ground shook. I placed a hand on the ground trying to keep us steady. My palm felt the cool forest floor. I closed my eyes trying to ignore everything to just think of any sort of plan.  

Then, I noticed it. A feeling of disgust ran through the ground. It mixed into the flow of magic the forest naturally gave off.  

My eyes shot open as I realized I did have a single option left. I could ask for help.  

Magic was power but it needed to be guided. Natural places like forests have a great deal of magic flowing through them. But also tends to collect in one spot. Over time places with naturally high magic content almost become alive. I’ve heard of Forests gaining a personality and creating bodies to interact with others.  

This forest wasn’t sentient. But it was close. I had vague emotions and a sense of self-preservation. And right now, it wanted the rip closed off and the monsters gone.  

What I was about to do was far riskier than just dying. I closed my eyes again trying to connect with the forest offering myself to it. If it lent me the power I needed, I would let it use my body to remove the threats.  

The offer was accepted.   

Within seconds I felt a wave of power come rushing through the bare trees. It came down on me, my body refusing for a moment. When I mentally accepted the magic, I was no longer myself. I don’t have a lot of memories of what happened next. It felt like I was asleep for a long time. The air felt warm and inviting like a summer day. I didn’t know who I was, or why I was there. I only wanted to remain in that comfortable place.  

A flash of pain came to my hands. I remembered I needed to close the tear between worlds. I saw myself raise my hands, a mass of power following my motions. It came crashing down on the edges of the rip, forcing it close ever so slowly. The first layer of skin started to burn away from my hands. I was aware of the pain, and yet not at the same time. The more I pressed, the more the pain increased. Whatever was on the other side started to fight back.   

A force clashed against all the power the forest had. The calmness I felt disappeared as a rage that was not my own exploded. More flesh burned away as my body moved on its own. Instead of grabbing one side of the tear with each hand, both hands grabbed the same side and put everything into forcing it together.   

It hurt. I thought I was dying. My bones and muscles creaked under the effort. But I wasn’t alone. Every single living creature in that forest was on my side. All of us think the same thing.  

Fuck off.  

Well, I doubted the birds, deer, and plants would have used those exact words, but the intent was still there. With one final push, the rip closed for good. The remaining monsters from the other side were swept up in the magic of the forest. Their bodies were torn apart to be claimed by the woods.  

I fell back into that calm comfortable state. I drifted off somewhere I nearly didn’t come back from.  

A pair of hands gently took the side of my face. I opened my eyes to find most of my body had been wrapped inside a newly grown tree that started to crumble away when I woke up. If I hadn’t been brought back by a simple touch I would have been taken by the forest.   

I fell forward, knocking Ito to the ground. We stayed like that for a few minutes until I had the strength to sit up. Our faces are too close to each other for comfort.  

He carefully reached over to bring down the makeshift mask off my face. He looked and sounded exhausted, but happy to be alive.  

“Don’t freak out, but you have freckles.” Ito told me in a soft voice.  

I’ve heard taking in too much magic changed your appearance. Tainted magic will twist your body. Who knew forest magic gave you freckles?  

“Your eyes are green... and your hair is slightly green too.”  

I frowned. I hoped the green part of my hair faded. I could deal with green eyes. I could pass on the freckles and weird hair.  

“It’s cute.” He added with a small laugh.  

Damn it. How dare he be like this. I found myself really wanting to kiss him at that moment. Which I ended up doing a second later.  

It was poor timing because our backup decided to show up causing us both to scramble away from each other. It took a while, but we explained what had happened. They nodded along and were good enough to not bring up what they walked into.  

We were both tired as hell, so they let us go, asking for a full report the next day. I refused medical treatment for my burned hands fearing how much it would cost me. Ito would not let me go home with exposed burns. He pretty much forced me to a hotel room The Corporation had paid for thinking our job would take at least two or three days to finish.  

I used the shower and changed into fresh clothing Ito had requested be brought over. He wrapped up my hands and we ended up awkwardly sitting across from each other at a small table in the corner of the room.  

“Are you hungry? You can order room service. The room is paid for and all.” He mentioned.  

Ito was back to fiddling with his hands. I needed to clear the air but wasn’t certain how to go about it.  

“So... I like you...” I started.  

“But...?” He finished.  

I took a second unable to think of the right words. Whatever I said would sound pathetic. Because it was.  

“My life is a mess right now. I can’t commit to anything serious” I explained.  

For some reason, that relaxed him. He let out a small laugh as the tension left.   

“Spending the night together isn’t serious.” He corrected.  

“You deserve better.” I said.  

We let the words hang in the air. I didn’t say if I thought he deserved a better person than me, or if he deserved a real relationship that I couldn’t give.  

“I want to be an Agent. I know I’ll die young because of it. I also don’t want any regrets in my life. I decided if I wanted to do something, I was going to do it. It didn’t matter if the result might be painful. I never want to think what could have happened.”   

I stared at him confused. What on Earth did he see in me that made him even remotely interested? I did defeat a monster when we first met, and we lived through a world-ending experience. I was starting to think he got the wrong impression of who I was.  

“I’m pretty sure you’ll regret a night with me.” I admitted.  

“I won’t know until we try it.”  

Damn, that was smooth. It wasn’t as if I didn’t want to go through with this. I really, really did. I just thought he was too good for me. But, if we both were on the same page, then why was I holding back so much?  

“I uh... have some nasty scars I don’t like people seeing.” I said, an uncomfortable feeling churning my stomach.  

Since what happened two years ago, I had only let my doctor see my bare legs. As a response. Ito flicked a finger. A magic thread turned off the only light in the room.   

I laughed. I couldn’t help it. He was making me like him even more.   

I was a bit rusty after being out of the game for two years. Ito didn’t mind. He talked a big game but he wasn’t as experienced as I expected. Which wasn’t a bad thing. Our not-so-serious night together wasn’t something magical that made us want to stay together forever, but it was something we both needed.  

I went home the next day after filling out a report of the events. Since it was hard to write, Klaus took down the information. He gave me a raised eyebrow when he heard what kind of stunt I pulled using the forest but didn’t make a comment about the risk I’d taken.  

I was sent home with a replacement basket to use for trash, and after Klaus mentioned how much he liked my freckles. I needed to figure out how to get rid of them sooner rather than later.  

I collapsed into bed absent-mindedly flexing my fingers to get them working again. Another job done. A little bit closer to my goal of paying off my debt. I got lucky to be alive but how long would that luck last for? Would I die before I paid off what I owed?   

I may need to start thinking like Ito. I should do things I wanted instead of waiting and maybe regretting what could have been later on. But right now, I was happy being alive and having a not-so-serious thing with a cute Agent who saw me as a better person than I thought I was.
