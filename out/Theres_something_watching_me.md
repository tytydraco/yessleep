There's definitely something watching me.

I don't know what it is. Knowing how these kinds of things go, I don't think I'll ever know.

I know, I know. It's a super cryptic way of starting off anything but I needed to get that off my chest as soon as possible.

Let me start with a bit of background. My name is Kasi, I'm 19 years old, and live with my parents, sister and brother-in-law, 2 cats and 1 dog.

It's not like I live in the middle of nowhere. I actually live near the backroads of my town with 2 very busy neighborhoods on either side of me. The scariest place near me is an abandoned house that highschoolers go to "investigate". My sister says that skinwalkers stay there. And while that's terrifying to think about, it's not what's watching me.

I have my own room. It has two windows that take up half of the southwest facing wall. And because I liked the idea of being able to feel the sun through the window while I'm playing games or doing school work, my desk is right up against it. The first week I moved it there, everything was perfectly fine. I was able to watch the dog play outside, I had my window open to let fresh air in, etc.

One night, I left my window open. I had opened it hours earlier and decided to just leave it like that because it was supposed to feel nice outside. (I would like to clarify that my window has a screen on it, so I would be able to hear if something was trying to get in.) I went to bed and fell asleep relatively fast (which was kinda weird but not something that I find relevant).

I woke up at around 1 a.m. for seemingly no reason. This usually happens to me but it felt weird? I guess? It's like when you know something bad is going to happen, you just don't know what. That's the best way I can describe it. I didn't want to get up. Both out of comfort and anxiety. I could hear the outside. I could still hear cicadas and the wind and leaves. It's not like someone was moving outside or someone was breathing in my room.

I didn't even bother to look at the window. In my head, nothing sounded off so nothing was wrong. My phone was next to me so I just watched videos. That feeling didn't leave for hours. I think it was around 5 when I started feeling better but that could've just been the cats waking up my dad and finally hearing something besides me awake.

I think that this is where it started. At least I hope so. I don't like the thought of anything watching me but I at least want to know when they were watching me.

This same thing went on for almost 2 weeks until I came to the conclusion that leaving my window open was a problem. I finally closed it and it did work for that one fucking night. And then it started right back up. Every night I would wake up past midnight and couldn't go back to sleep for hours. After I while, I started staying up out of pure annoyance cause that's all it was at the moment. I was annoyed and anxious. The only sleep I would get would be when I either took naps in the middle of the day or got so exhausted that nothing could stop me from ultimately passing out.

It didn't stop there though. Cause of course it couldn't. Soon, it would go away at all. I started getting that feeling in the day. Only ever at my house but in the middle of the fucking day.

I saw something a week ago. All this time I thought that I was just being paranoid for no reason and that it was all in my head. It's not all in my head. I saw something behind one of the trees in my yard. I couldn't see it clearly. It was just barely too far away. But it's like I could feel it looking at me. I went to another window to see if it was even real. It's definitely real. It seemed like it got closer to my room but was still looking at me. I was alone in the house.

Luckily, I'm part of a hunting family so I grabbed a pistol from my mom's safe and took the dog with me as comfort/more protection. I went back into my room to make sure it hadn't gotten in. It was back where it was when I first saw it. I sat down with my dog in front of the window and we just stared at each other. I didn't even hear my parents come home. They didn't even question the gun.

It's still there. A week later and it's still there. I got some binoculars to look at it but I couldn't see it at all. It's like it isn't even there. But I know it's there. It has to be there. I don't really sleep much anymore. I'm scared of what will happen when I'm not looking at it. I just want it to go back to normal.
