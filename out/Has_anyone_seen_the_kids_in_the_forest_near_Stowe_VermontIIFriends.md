Just so people know, this is part two of what's happened to me in Stow Vermont. If you want to have a more in depth look to what's happened so far, then you can either go to my profile or go to this link [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1e2d53z/has\_anyone\_seen\_the\_kids\_in\_the\_forest\_near\_stowe/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1e2d53z/has_anyone_seen_the_kids_in_the_forest_near_stowe/) If you want a basic rundown, I went back to my childhood home and my parents have been experiencing weird things with these kids that either live in the wood or just sneak in there (I'm still not sure). The worst part is that they keep receiving photos of them sleeping. All I want to do is find out what is going on and how I fit into all of this. That's the gist of what's happened so far, but I recommend that you still go look at part one so you can help me with all of this mess.

I know it’s been a little bit since I last posted, but things have gotten worse. I can't leave Stowe anymore. There's no running away. They won’t stop writing about me, and every note has some cryptic message at the end. Also, this one is going to be a bit longer than my last post. So much has happened in only one day. Thank you guys for trying to help me. I’m going to try and remember what has happened over the past few hours, so some of the details may be a bit fuzzy. 

After I wrote the first story, I went back to the living room with my father. We looked through more of the photos and I saw the scars and scrapes they were talking about. Not only was it on my arms, but they were also covering my back. I lifted up my sleeve and looked for any signs of scars. On my hand, there was a deep brown looking scar. I had never noticed it before, and I don’t think anyone else has. Why wasn’t I remembering anything?

“Your palms were always bleeding,” My dad said from beside me. “You always had cuts on them. Probably from those kids.”

“So what did you do? To me it looks like you did nothing to try and stop it.” I stood up, staring down at him with fury in my eyes. 

“I told you we tried to keep you away from the woods. Then they decided to try and come into the house. That’s how you-”

“That’s how you failed to save me. The only reason I’m still here is because they just so happened to drop me. What do you think would have happened if they had continued forward? I would have disappeared into the woods. Then what would you have done?”

My father stood up swiftly, angry being present across his face. “I tried my best Jason! I tried to keep you safe, but then they decided to start attacking us. They would throw rocks through our windows, try to pop the tires on our car, and come into the house. We were practically never safe when we decided to venture outside.” I could see tears start to form in his eyes. I began to feel guilty for what I had said. “I tried so hard to keep you and your mother safe, then they decided to break into the house and steal you. I tried to run after you, but they were too fast. When they dropped you, they tried to pick you back up but they were too slow. I kicked one of them away and then pulled out my gun. They scurried away and never tried to come back.”

He sat back down and began to cry. His hands now covered his face as I stood before him, staring down at the man who had tried so hard to set me free from the torture that had plagued me all those years ago. Why have they come back now? Did they want me again? I needed to remember and find out what they had done all those years ago.

Before I reached my hand out to comfort my father, I heard a knock. It came from behind me though. I looked back and saw that the curtain was slightly adjusted so I could see the forest that was outside. Except something was blocking my view. I saw a bright orange fox mask peeking at us. Dark brown eyes glared with intent that I couldn’t read.

I jumped up and ran towards the door. I could see that the child in the mask was beginning to run away. I swiftly opened the door and ran outside, trying to chase that creepy kid. Before I could even get onto the porch, I was hit in the head with something cold. I fell over onto my back, pain shooting up my spine as I hit the deck floor. I could hear laughter, and when my sight was adjusted, I could see two more children standing above me. It was the same kids from before. They were still wearing the bear and owl mask. They were the ones who had taken my picture.

“Shit,” I yelled as they ran away with the other masked child. They laughed the whole time as they ran deeper into the woods. My head began to feel like it was pounding, and when I looked for the object that had hit me, I saw that it was the shovel that my father had from before.

“Jason! What happened?” My father rushed to my side and slowly lifted me to my feet.

“They hit me with the shovel,” I said as I slowly stood up. It felt like the whole room was shaking. I could barely stand up. “They ran away back into the woods. Should we try to follow them?”

“Already tried that once. They don’t really like anyone coming in, especially when it’s dark out.”

*Of course they don't, I thought*. *They don’t want you to come in because they might try to kill you guys.* “Don’t try to go in there alone,” I said, more stern than intended.

“We haven’t been in there since you left for college. We don’t plan on going in there anytime soon, but that doesn’t mean that you wander in there alone either. You either take me or one of your friends. Even then I don’t think we should venture there.”

How had the woods that I used to travel in, that I used to be obsessed with, become so terrifying and foreign? Why were these kids back? What were they trying to do? So many questions had flooded my head that I had to sit back down on the cool wooden floor. The fresh forest breeze had begun to settle in and made me feel like I was freezing.

“They left something here Jason.” I looked back at my father as he held two square shaped objects in his hand. One of them seemed to be a piece of notepaper, and the other looked like it might have been another picture. I grabbed the photo first and saw a picture of me looking straight into the camera that was about twenty feet away. I could see the porch and the silhouette of my father behind me. The other piece of paper was in fact a note. The handwriting was terrible, yet still legible.

*You’ve been gone for so long little Gecko. The storyteller can still remember you. Do you remember us? Why don’t we play some games to help you remember us?*

“Short and straight to the point,” I said aloud. I handed both pieces to him as he stared at them intently. *Who the hell is the story teller and how did he know who I was?* It was also interesting how they knew I had a gecko mask.  These kids had to be about eight or nine, so how did they know? How old was the Storyteller?

“How did that one get on the roof,” My father said, baffled.

“Wait, what did you say?”

“There's one of those damn things on the roof. He was right above us.” I quickly grabbed the picture and scanned through it. Sure enough there was a person right above us. He was staring down at the two of us, but he had no mask on. Instead, he had a hat with what looked like long blades of grass that covered his face. The worst part is that you could still see the glint from the camera that was in his eyes. He wasn’t as young as the rest of them either. He was older. “Why doesn’t he have a mask on though?”

I felt myself start to breathe faster as my heart began to pound against my chest. *He was up there the whole time, yet I never noticed. How did he not make a sound?* I could feel my father’s hand grab my shoulder, trying to calm me down. It worked as I began to slow my breathing. 

“I don’t understand any of this,” I said as hot tears ran down my face. “What did I do out in those woods?”

“Jason, if I had an answer I would give it to you immediately, I just don’t know anything that happened when you walked out into those woods. I thought you would stay on the paths, but those children must have led you somewhere else.”

*That’s what the false trails might be,* I thought. *They created trails that branched off the given paths that we had so I could go deeper into the woods with them.* When I looked back at my father, it seemed that he had the same realization. “So if I go down those false trails, then I can find them. I can find out where they are.”

“You are not going to go in there now. You and I are gonna talk and you can find out what you want to do from there.” I agreed with him and we walked back into the house. How had everything gone south almost immediately? I just wanted to visit my parents and talk about how college was. Now I was out here trying to figure out why masked children were harassing my parents. It seemed like they wanted something else from me too.

“Earlier you said, ‘I thought you were happy’. What did you mean by that?”

“Well,” My father said as he fetched another cup from the cabinet above the coffee maker. “They used to come by a lot more often after you left for college. They would come around, take more pictures of us, then just leave notes addressed to you. They wanted you back in the woods. So we told them that you were off at college and that you wouldn’t be back until a while. We gave them jam, honey, and bread to try and make them happy, and it seemed to work. They rarely came by after that, until it was your last year over in Washington. They got more aggressive saying that they needed you back. They started throwing more rocks through our windows, and more photos were dropped off at the door.”

He set the mug in front of me, steam rising out of the mug. I held it in my hands, feeling the warmth spread across my hands. I took a quick sip as it glided down my throat. It almost tasted sweet. “So then what?”

“We told them you weren’t going to come back. They began to try and hurt us. I walked out onto Puffball one day and one of them stabbed me in the ankle. I haven’t been back out on those trails until you showed up yesterday. Then they left me a note. Not your mother, but me. It said that they would try to kill your mother if I didn't get you back here. So we had to invite you."

I could feel fury and rage boil inside of me. "You invited me so I could get killed by those things? What the fuck were you thinking!" I slammed my mug onto the table, making some of my coffee spill.

"They were going to kill her, Jason. I had no other choice."

"Why the hell didn't you move? Maybe go to a random town for a few days. Even going to a friend's house would have worked."

"Jason," My father yelled. "We tried almost everything. We tried going to your aunt's house, and they appeared again. They tried to abduct your cousins. We couldn't go anywhere without someone getting hurt. I'm sorry, but this was the only way that everyone would stay safe." His breathing was loud, jaw clenched, and hands balled into fists. They really did. My cousins were only seven and eight. How did they know where they were?

“I’m going to go to town,” I said as I stood up. My father looked at me with disbelief in his eyes. Before he could speak, I started to talk again. “I’ll be fine. Town is only ten minutes away. I’m gonna go ask some friends if they know anything about this. You need to stay here and make sure mom is okay.” I silently walked towards the door and looked behind me before I could exit. My father’s face was hidden by his hands as he silently wept into them. He looked up at me, practically begging me to stay. “I love you dad.”

He showed a silent smile as he softly said, “Love you too, kid.” I walked out before he could say another word. I closed the door behind me and sat on the steps that led down to my car. I silently cried as I thought about how much he had truly done. I should have thanked him instead of blaming him for everything that was happening. I wanted to find out what was going on with these kids, no matter what it took.

After the ride to town, I parked outside of the Stowe Community Church. Really the spot where I parked was at Lower Bar, which always confused me because why would you have a bar next to a church. You could tell it was Sunday because most of the nearby residents seemed to be inside. I got out of my car and looked around the parking lot, trying to find any vehicles that would be similar to the ones during my childhood, at least the bit that I could remember. 

When I walked inside, I could hear the preacher or pastor, (I never went to church much and when I did, I usually just drowned out the sound and thought about how hot the girl next to me was) talking about how the devil has many ways to infiltrate the mind. “And believe me, if I had the power to stop the devil, then I would without any hesitation. People who worship the devil only have thoughts about how their life could be changed immediately. Think of it as a shortcut. Following the word of God is something that will benefit you towards the end of life. Really it helps you at any point in their life.”

I took a seat towards the back and kept listening to the man and the podium who kept talking about how God can show us the miracles of his brilliance. I never really thought of religion as a great thing. I think it’s good to find meaning in it and to try and change your life for the better, yet it still always freaked me out. Especially with the way that they always spoke about it. 

After the sermon and after everyone had left, I walked up to the pastor. As I began to walk over to him, he gave me a big smile. “Hello sir. What can I do for you today?”

“Hey,” I said a bit shyly. “I wanted some help with a situation I have.”

His face was then washed with concern as he stared at me. “What may that be? Are you having trouble following the word of God? I know it seems hard at times, believe me I’ve been through it, it does get easier with time.”

“No it’s not that. I wanted to ask you if you knew anything about kids in the forest.” He looked confused and I immediately regretted asking him. Why didn’t I just ask someone that I actually knew? I should have asked someone else.

“Do they wear those little animal masks?” That same smile that he gave me earlier was spread across his face.

“Yeah. How did you know?”

“Oh those kids shouldn’t mean any harm. They just like giving people a good scare, especially to some elderly folks. I think they’re just kids from around the neighborhood. All they are is misguided. I bet I’ve seen each one of them in church before.”

His determination in his statement was surprising. “How do you know all of that?”

“I don’t. It’s just my best assumption. Are they giving you any trouble?”

I didn’t really know what to tell him. So I just lied instead. “No, just my parents. They said that they take pictures of them. Like a lot of pictures. It's starting to freak me out.”

He turned his back to me and started to walk away. “Follow me. I’ll show you something that might change your mind.” This whole situation was getting creepier by the minute. I didn’t really know if I should have followed him, but he waved his hand signaling that I should. 

He led me into a room towards the back of the church, where there were a multitude of crosses lining the wall. This was one reason why I didn’t care for religion. He walked towards a filing cabinet and reached in. He grabbed about five photos, each of different people and laid them out onto his table. “Oh my-”

“Not in a church please, but I can understand your fear.” *Fear. I’m mortified.* Every photo was of someone, not realizing they were being watched, and a circle that noticed a different thing. “Most of the photos that I’ve gathered have this same little circle. Every circle differs depending on the person. I think they’re just trying to note what features they like in the person. While at first creepy, most people have come to terms with it and take it as a compliment.”

“So how did you get all of these photos?”

“You’re not the only one who came for some help. They gave me the photos and asked if I had any answers. I gave them the same one that you just received.”

I didn’t feel comfortable anymore. I stood up and was getting ready to go. I felt like I had to puke. “Well I have to go. Have a food day Father or pastor or preacher.” 

I walked out of the door and from behind me I heard, “It’s Peter Kevilan. Have a good day and come back if you need any more help. I’m always here.” The last sentence freaked me out and I practically ran outside. When I reached the door, I ran to Lower Bar and puked in the parking lot. I felt sick to my stomach seeing all of these photos of different people. What did these kids want? I couldn’t tell if they wanted me, or everyone. 

“Jesus, Jason,” I heard from behind me. I looked and saw my former girlfriend, or what felt like the ruder term, my ex.

“What do you want Kensie? I don’t really feel like having any condescending comments today.”

“Yeah, I could tell that. I came over to ask if you were okay, but if you don’t want any help then I suppose I can leave.”

“Yes please. You can go.” She began to walk away before I finished my sentence. “Wait. Can you actually talk with me for a second?”

She looked back and smiled. “I knew you were lonely. So what were you doing in church?” 

I stood up, trying to control my breathing. “Well I was looking for some answers. My parents got something weird going on at their house.”

“It’s those kids still, isn’t it.” I looked up surprised, yet she just stared at the ground. She seemed scared. She must have had some experience too. “They talked about it a while ago. I was there when they tried to make the report. Later they said that the kids weren’t as aggressive. Those little shits came by my house one day. Tried to take a picture of me before I threw a rock at them. They ran away but still got the picture. I never received it though.”

“Has everyone been receiving those photos?”

“Some people. Mainly your parents though. I tried asking my friend Riley but they said that it was some joke that they heard their little brother talking about. Riley thinks he’s in on it.”

Finally, It felt like I had something that I could work with.  If I could find this kid then maybe I could find out more about this weird thing. “Where’s that kid now? Where’s Riley?” She paused and looked away once more.she leaned against my car and I could hear her let out a deep sigh. “What’s wrong Kensie?”

“Markus died about two weeks ago. At Least that’s what Riley thinks.”

“Oh my God. I’m sorry Kensie.”

“It’s fine. Riley said that he went missing a while ago. He was missing for about a week before one of those kids dropped off a photo at their window. It was his brother. His body was gray and leaves were covering his body. Riley hasn’t shown their parents. they didn’t want them to find out about what happened. He was only in second grade.”

Everything was silent for a while. I didn’t want to know if it was the kids who killed him or not. I just wanted to leave at this point, but at the same time I wanted to solve this for everyone. “Do you think you can introduce me to Riley?”

She gave me a look of shock and backed up a little. “Are you kidding me? Is this your way of trying to date me again?”

“No Kensie. I want to solve this whole thing. I need to find out what is going on. There is something going on with them that goes deeper. I’m going to find it out and then we don’t have to worry about these kids ever again.” 

She looked concerned. I know she didn’t want to go along with this plan, and to be honest I didn’t either. I had to though. The thought of Markus’s dead body lying in the forest where no one would find him again haunted my mind. If not for myself, then I wanted to do it for my parents and everyone who has been receiving these notes.

“Okay,” She said, letting out another deep sigh. “I’ll text him real fast and we can meet here later. I hope you're serious about this, cause these kids are really pissing me off.”

Kensie got into my car (since she lived in town she had no use for one as she worked at The Black Cap which was across from the church) and began to lead me towards Riley’s house. At first there was awkward silence, no radio or anything to break the tension between us. She reached down and turned on the radio which started to play Maneater. 

“So, where did you come from,” I asked. She looked at me confused as if to say ‘well obviously the same town you did’. “I mean, where did you come from when I came out of the church? Why did you even come over to check up on me?”

“Well, you seemed sick and I wanted to help. I had just finished my shift at The Cap so I was going to walk home until I saw you. Just because you’re my ex doesn’t mean that I won’t try to help you. Do you think I’m that cynical?” She let out a little giggle after her sarcastic comment.

“Do you mean that?” I kept looking straight down the road, not trying to glance in her direction. “Are you serious when you say that you would try to help me? If you are, then I need you to help me find out what the hell these kids are all about. I know it’s a big ask, but I need people to help me.”

“So that’s why you want to meet Riley. You want him to help you with all of this shit.” I felt bad asking for other people's help, but I had a gut feeling that Riley wanted to know what had happened to their brother just as much as me. I know that they want answers.

“Yeah. Whoever Riley is, they probably want answers just as much as me.”

“Take a left here.” I obeyed and was about to speak when Kensie interrupted me. “Riley is a guy. He works with me at The Cap.”

I froze a bit yet my gaze never wavered off the street. “Oh,” I said as I could feel my voice crack. My face got red. “So is he your-”

“Jesus, Jason. Just because he’s a guy and he’s my friend, doesn’t mean that I date him.”

“I wasn’t going to say that. I was going to ask if he was your only friend.”

“Pretty much. Everyone else is either a stuck up wannabe rich kid or some really weird person. And I don’t mean weird as in ‘Oh I like Star Wars and DnD’, I mean WEIRD.”

I laughed a bit and continued watching the road. “Liking Star Wars isn’t weird. It’s a normal thing.” 

“Oh my, your sarcasm is so good that I thought you were telling the truth.” She began to laugh now as I could feel my face begin to blush. “That’s his house right there.” She pointed towards a two story white house with different kinds of flowers growing in tiny gardens. There was a brick path that led to the road but cut off due to there being no sidewalk. There were no cars in the driveway, and I wondered if he was really home.

“Just park in the driveway. His parents are out trying to look for Markus.” I listened to her and parked in the driveway where I could see a tall figure step out of the door. We got out and Kenise was the first one to greet him. “Hey Riley. How are you holding up?”

“Good,” He said in a voice that seemed a little too deep for someone who looked like they were the same age as me. “Who’s your friend?”

I walked up to him with my hand outstretched. “Hey Riley. I’m Jason. I’m one of Kensie’s previous boyfriends.”

He stared at my hand for a bit then took it with his own. “Um…alright. I didn’t know Kenise had more than one ex.” Kensie lightly hit him and he seemed to understand what she was indicating. “So what are you guys doing here?”

“Well,” I began, not totally sure how to ask him if he wanted to look for his dead brother’s possible killers. “Have you heard of the masked children in the woods?” I was expecting him to look at me like I was an idiot. Maybe even say ‘are you high’. None of that happened though. Instead, his face was ghostly pale.

“Get inside,” He said as he rushed to the door. He opened it for us and started to push us in. We entered the living room and he sat in a cushioned rocking chair that sat across from a couch. Kensie and I took our seats across from him as he started to speak again. “First of all, you can’t just say that shit so casually out here. People are still terrified of them. Second, why would you want to know that?”

“Do you know who the Potter’s are? I’m their son. Those kids want something with me, and I think you could help me with this stuff. They won’t leave us alone and-”

“I’m sorry but no. I don’t want anything to do with those kids anymore. My brother knew something about them that I didn’t, then those fuckers killed him. If you try and find out what’s going on, then all that’s going to happen is another missing person. What happens when they take your picture and send it to your parents?” I didn’t want to think about that but I did. I could already imagine my father blaming himself for not doing more.

“Riley,” Kensie started with a sad tone. “We need to stop these kids. People around town are getting the pictures and no one is doing anything. Pastor Peter is already trying to play it off, just like sheriff Giligan. If we don’t do anything then no one will. What happens when someone else’s brother goes missing?”

“He’s not missing. Markus is dead in the woods because he knew something about them. If anyone tries to find out more about them, then what do you think will happen?” We all stayed silent for about a minute before I finally thought of something.

“What if it wasn’t those kids?” Everyone had looked at me like I was crazy. “I know it sounds weird, but what if those things aren’t responsible for it. Think of them like little servants. They seem young enough that they wouldn’t really know what is right and what is wrong. Someone could easily manipulate all of them and start making them do all of their dirty work.”

Riley nodded his head up and down but Kensie still looked confused. “I don’t understand. You’re saying that these kids are just pawns or something?”

“Exactly. I think there is something bigger at play here. I got a note this morning from them and a picture. They said something about a storyteller. To me, that just sounds like a leader. Riley, did Markus say that all of them wore animal masks?”

He looked back up, his eyes beginning to produce tears. He wiped them away and said, “No. He said some of them wore hats that still covered their faces. I got his notebook and it says some stuff about it. I don’t want to read it, but if you can find something in there then you can have it.I didn’t want to read it after he went missing. It felt wrong to go through it when I didn’t know where he was. I guess I do now though.”

I nodded and he practically ran up the stairs. Kensie then tapped my shoulder asking for my attention. “So if they aren’t doing it by themselves, then why would the people leading them tell them to torment the town? It doesn’t make sense.”

“I don’t understand why, but I know we are getting closer to the truth. I think Riley might be on board soon enough.” Just as I said that I could hear heavy footsteps come from above us. Riley flew down the stairs and threw the notebook to me. He took his seat and then waited for me to read it. 

I have the notebook with me in my room right now, so I will just copy off what Markus had written. The note came from the last entry that he wrote. 

*May 25th, 2024*    

*Dear dairy-*

*Me, Jackson, and Westley went into the forest today and found those weird kids again. Something was really creepy about them today though. They had some new people there that didn’t wear those creepy animal masks. I think there were three of them that had weird hats. It was made out of grass, or straw, something long that covered their faces. They seemed a lot older than the rest of the kids, It almost sounded like they were telling them what they should do. They talked about pictures and sent them to some people. I’m pretty sure that they were really interested in Laurence and Mary Potter. I don’t really know why though because they never go to town. Maybe that’s where they like to hangout. I wish I could  hang out with them. Maybe those masks wouldn’t be so creepy if I wore one. Thanks for listening to me.*

*-Markus*

The last few sentences had mortified me. *Maybe those masks wouldn’t be so creepy if I wore one*. I already knew I looked pale, but I didn’t really know what else to do. How was I supposed to tell Riley about what his brother had written in the book? He did confirm one thing though. There were leaders to this whole thing, and they were older people. One of them had to have been on my roof this morning. 

“So is there anything interesting in there,” Riley asked with growing curiosity being present.

“I was right. There are people teaching them all this stuff.”

“Holy shit.” Riley stood up and started to walk around. Kensie raised her hands to her face and stayed silent.

“We need your help Riley. Now we know that it was these people who,” I froze trying to think of what to say besides ‘the people who killed your brother’.

“They killed my brother. That’s what they did.” We all still stayed silent and waited for the other to answer. I wanted to walk out. I wanted to do anything to get out of there. Then Riley spoke again. “I can help. Where do we go first?”

After a while we all hopped into my car and started to drive away from Riley’s house. “You said we should go to my house first, right Kensie.”

“Yeah. You said you have some of those trails. Maybe a couple lead towards a hideout or something out there. I think those false trails could lead us somewhere.” I agreed with her and began to get on the road that would lead out of town. 

Before we could go anywhere, Riley began to point something out. “Hey, isn’t that the sheriff's car?” He pointed ahead of us and right where his index finger was pointing, was a police car that was parked on the side of the road right next to the forest front. “What do you guys think he’s doing?”

I already had one thought in my mind. *He’s out there with the kids, but why?* Then Kensie had shut that thought down when she said “I think he’s on the search party right? Maybe he’s trying to look for Markus.” 

Silence overcame all of us to the point where all we could hear was eachother breathing. I reached down and turned on the radio which started to play ‘Can’t Take My Eyes Off You’. We all stayed silent until we reached my house.

“I think this is the worst place that you could live,” Riley said. We all stepped out of the car and walked up to the front door. 

Before I could even knock, my mom pulled the door open. “Jason. Oh my God I was so worried. You’ve been gone almost all day.You’re fathers sleeping right now so don’t worry about him.” She gave me a big hug and when she let go she noticed that I had company. “And you brought friends. I can whip up some dinner if you guys want some.”

“Mom, this is Riley, and you already know Kensie.”

“It’s nice to meet you Mrs. Potter,” Riley said as he stuck out his hand to my mother. 

“Well it’s nice to meet you Riley. Kensie, when was the last time that you were here.” My mother had a strange supernatural power that I could never understand. She was somehow able to make every public situation awkward to a noticeable degree, yet she never noticed.

“It sure has been a while,” Kensie said while blushing. I couldn’t blame her because I knew that my face was just as red as her’s. 

“Well we’re gonna go over to the backyard. We wanted to go down the trails.”

I could tell that she wanted to stop me, but I think she knew that I needed to go out there no matter what. She knew I would be safe if I had multiple people. “Do you have a knife?” I pulled out a small hunting knife and flicked it open. “Okay. Be back by six thirty. I’ll have dinner ready by then.” I agreed and looked at my phone. It was three o’clock. We had enough time to find out what was in there.

As we reached the backyard, I could hear rustling coming from the trails. Riley was right beside me and looked at every trail. “Jesus. What one do we go down?” 

“I don’t know. Puffball is the longest one. We might find something there.”

Kensie walked ahead of us and began to walk down the trail. “We should hurry. It gives us more time to look around.” Riley and I looked at each other and nodded in agreement and followed her down the path. If I wasn’t doing this for my parents, then I would do it for Markus. I’m going to find out what’s in those woods, no matter what it takes.
