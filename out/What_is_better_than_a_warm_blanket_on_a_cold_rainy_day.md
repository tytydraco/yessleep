The thunder rumbled with an ambiguity that made everyone at work question their footing. It was a gloomy Friday after a week of increasingly mundane chats, pings, and back-and-forths when the storm swept into the city. The storm clouds crashing in the background of an already gray existence made for a generally glum ambiance in the office. But a long weekend was right around the corner, and a little rain was not going to dampen the plans I had for this weekend. Every tumble of thunder just pushed my brain further into the depths of my imagination.

This weekend is Josh and my second anniversary, and the effort I put into planning the celebration had been extensive. From the grocery lists to the shade of orange I would set the lamps, to the scent of the multiple smokeless incense packs I bought earlier in the weekâ€”everything was planned down to every possible detail. This has always been one of my faults: imagining the way a date, meeting, party, or any social gathering would go, to the point that even if it all happened exactly as I pictured it, I would feel let down by the simple fact that it was not as good as I had hoped. But tomorrow would be different. I was going to plan something nice without going over the top, and I would enjoy a wonderful evening with my love.

It was the power flickering that brought me back to reality and reminded me to check the clock next to my desk.

5:32.

With the haste of a man late for a pre-anniversary dinner with his partner, I got up and started closing the applications that had been sitting stagnant on my desktop for the past hour or so. I gathered the few belongings that I allowed within the confines of the office building and started walking out towards the elevator. I knew already it would be a minute before I would make it to the basement where I parked my coincidentally also gray car. The elevator usually takes a pause on each floor around this time of the day. I get it; I'm trying to get home too, so why shouldn't everyone else? I make it inside my car before I see the notification from the office building on my phone.

"Due to the storm, all power to the garage has been shut off until further notice. Please contact Gerald with maintenance in order to arrange your exit from the parking lot."

Of course. The directors can afford to earn six-digit salaries but refused to greenlight the project that would allow a spare generator outside that could power the building in a situation not unlike the one I found myself in. I remained in my car, grateful for the few bars of service I at least had. I moved to message the infamous "Gerald," who no doubt must be cursing whoever just sent this message, causing his phone to effectively be blown up with text messages from angry government employees. My meager plea for assistance in his sea of cries for help would likely get me nowhere, but nonetheless, I hit send.

That's when the outline of a man materializes in my rearview mirror.

No features, no distinct colors, no acknowledgment of standing behind my car in a dark parking garage during a power outage. Just a still shape waiting to see what I did next. Being simultaneously naive and optimistic, I got out of the car and announced myself enthusiastically to who I obviously assumed was Gerald coming to help get me out of this godforsaken situation.

"Gerald got caught on something and couldn't make it right now. He sent me," spoke a raspy yet comforting voice from the silhouette. Not unlike a grandfather who had seen horrors in his earlier years but now got teary-eyed watching the nature channel in his retirement home.

"Oh, well, as long as someone is going to get me out of here!" I responded firmly and slightly at ease now that the figure had a voice and an intent.

"The door won't open in this type of weather. Something about too high of a risk threshold for management to allow," Gerald's replacement informed me. "We are going to head out the back doors. Those are manual," he says and looks at me as if I should know that parking garages have back doors.

"Okay."

"It's a bit of a walk. I'll get in the car and you drive. I'll point the way," he says and starts towards the passenger seat before I have a second to consider the possibility of this not being a good idea that gets me home as soon as possible.

I got in the driver's seat and started the car. The man, who has yet to share his name, took the uninvited initiative to put the car in reverse, which startled me into beginning to back up. I shifted to move forwards and followed the girthy white finger pointing to go left down further into the parking garage. I have worked here for nearly a year and have yet to venture this way, but it makes logical sense for the back door of a parking garage to be deeper in the ground, right?

I followed the silent finger for a couple of minutes, going deeper in a spiral towards the exit. When I rounded the final corner, I started questioning where the door was before I was interrupted by the searing pain of tearing flesh in my thigh.

I took the time I had left to scream out a few profanities which, looking back, did nothing to aid my case. Before I knew it, I had a white cloth over my face, and the gray I was used to went black.

I came to when my car crashed into the final wall of the parking garage, no exit in sight. I was groggy from the chemicals just thrust into my esophagus, and in the midst of an active car crash, so it took a few seconds to feel the restrictiveness of the staples that were binding my clothes, and parts of my skin, to the leather chair of my Prius. Seeing the blood weeping from my inner thigh, where I was unfortunate enough to have a little extra skin caught in the freshly shot staple, caused a muffled sob to escape my chest.

I looked to my right where I expected to see my passenger from a few minutes ago. To my surprise, which is a surprise in itself, he was gone. As my next move in my unexpected fight for my life at the bottom of this nightmare parking situation, I looked around to see if I had any chance of leaving this place. I had just enough time to read the wall in front of me before I saw the passenger again standing as a shadow behind my car, this time with a source of light illuminating a face that I had seen once before. It was the guy who told Josh and I that "the queers are all going to burn in hell" a few weeks ago on the train.

That's when the black spray paint I noticed painted on the wall in front of my smashed car hood made sense.

Revelation 21:8

The pieces were coming together in my mind when the source of light illuminating the putrid monster's face came to fruition as a flame connected to a Molotov cocktail delicately twirling through the air and connecting with the running motor in my newly exposed car hood.

The fire linking with my skin inch by inch was the last thing I felt. The flames crept over my body in a way that was beyond pain and instead engulfed me in the warmest blanket I have ever felt.
