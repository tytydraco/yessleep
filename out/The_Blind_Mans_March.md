I’m in my 70's. I'm an old ass man. My grandson has me typing this out on one of those new fancy computers. I’m typing this story out even though I’ve already told it to him a million trillion times. I guess he thinks there’s something special to it. So here it is.

I served in the United States Marine Corp as an Infantryman during the war. World War 2, that is. I was part of the ‘second wave’ over there in France, cleaning up after our boys took the beaches. I didn’t do a whole hell of a lot over there, but I did shoot two Nazi shit heads. So that counts for something I guess. Either way, the story isn’t about the war. It’s about what they found during the war.

Turns out the Krauts were doing some scientific research down in Antarctica during the war, real top-secret type stuff. I didn’t find out about the whole thing until well after the war ended, when our boys came in and took over the operation from the Krauts. It was a drilling operation of some kind, maybe looking for something specific. Who knows.

They ended up drilling pretty damn deep. About a thousand feet or so, if I remember correctly. They hit a patch of some real super-thick ice, something different about it from regular ice. I don’t know, I’m an Infantryman, not an ice scientist. Couldn’t tell you what the Nazis thought they were gonna find down there. Or what we thought we were gonna find down there.

What they ended up finding down there was a giant, sleeping human being. He was curled up into a fetal position, holding his knees to his chest. Sleeping like a baby, deep down there in the ice. They measured him about 16 feet in height if he were to stand up straight.

I’m calling it a He, because it looked kind of like a man. But to tell the truth, there isn’t any way of knowing for sure, since there weren't any privates. Any at all. Male privates, female privates, there weren't any at all. Didn’t have nipples either. Or eyes. No eyes at all, just the sockets.

I know you modern kids, this is all going to sound like a loony old man going on a rant about some weird war stuff. It ain’t gonna be in any of the textbooks or anything fancy like that. But I swear to you, go find an old timer in your life who you trust, and ask them about it. I swear to you, they’ll remember. It won’t be in any textbooks, but everyone who was around back then remembers it. This is no lie, this is real history.

When he woke up, he supposedly turned and looked right at the scientists. I don’t know if I believe all that. A guy with no eyes looking right at someone?

Anyways, he climbed himself right out of that deep hole in the ice, and climbed right up to the surface. They tried to stop him by flooding the shaft, but it didn’t do a lick of good. He kept coming.

Took him a few hours to make it out of the hole, which gave the folks at the base enough time to evacuate and get a response team there. When he finally reached the surface, apparently the team tried to make an arrest. I don’t know what exactly they were expecting, but that didn’t work. The creature - the man, he took off walking due north. Directly north. Just started walking. They yelled at him to stop, but he didn’t stop. He kept walking, and they opened fire.

The man kept walking. After being shot by multiple weapons at once, just kept walking. He apparently didn’t stop for a second, never even broke his stride. It seemed like he wasn’t even aware of the fact that he had just been shot in the back of the head by a whole squad with automatic rifles.

It took him a day or so to reach the end of the Antarctic ice shelf. As the rumor goes, he didn’t even stop or break his stride before stepping right off the ice shelf and falling dozens of feet into the freezing water.

They sent a sub down to find his body, but they couldn’t locate it anywhere. Eventually after some more days, a different sub spotted him walking along the bottom of the ocean near South Africa. They shot at him with torpedoes, but even that didn’t seem to affect this guy. He was like a real life Superman, immune to any physical damage. That’s how he was able to walk across the bottom of the ocean.

I guess he didn’t need air or food, or anything else that the rest of us need. He didn’t need sleep either, and he never stopped for a break, so I suppose he had unlimited stamina as well. As soon as I heard the news from the higher-ups, I knew right then that nothing on God’s green earth would ever stop this man from going where he wanted to go, wherever that was.

As he walked across Africa, it was chaos. Back then, many of the African nations were colonies of European ones, and there wasn’t any love lost between the two of them. When this unwelcome giant appeared on their continent’s shores, they used it as an excuse to fight against each other. Europeans fought Europeans, Europeans fought Africans, Africans fought Africans. All the while, the man just walked right through the middle of it, leaving his gigantic footprints in the earth as he went. They would occasionally turn their attention on him and hit him with a few munitions, to no effect. Always, no effect.

By the time he made it to the beaches of French Algeria and stepped into the Mediterranean, hundreds of thousands of people had died. Was it his fault? If you ask me, I’d say hell no. We did that all on our own.

It wasn’t any better when he showed up in Europe. He emerged from the sea on the southern coast of France and kept going north, just as he had been all along. There was always the matter of rebuilding afterwards whenever he passed through an area. Whenever a city or town would find itself in the way of his path north, he wouldn't go around. Never around. He would always go through.

Through means through buildings, through cars, through people if necessary. Nothing slowed him down even a bit. They tried putting a 2-ton steel wall in his path to see what he would do. He walked right through it, the steel just bent the way aluminum bends and he passed through without slowing down a bit. I’m sure you can imagine what happened to any living flesh that happened to be in front of his path. Not good.

He walked all the way through France, across the bottom of the Channel, and appeared on the shores of England. They thought they were ready for him, they had an entire fleet of destroyers parked in the south of the country, just waiting for him to show up. When he did, they all fired on him at once. No fanfare, just explosion after explosion. When the smoke cleared, he was still walking north. Nothing had changed.

After that, we changed our strategy. No more trying to stop him, now we just follow him. Observe him. Avoid him. Entire towns in England were evacuated overnight to clear the way north for him. Some folks even turned up to cheer him on, shouting and waving signs as he passed by. He never reacted to anyone or anything.

When he stepped into the sea again, the English breathed a huge sigh of relief. For the most part, they had managed to avoid any major loss of life. When the giant showed up in Iceland, they were already on board with the Brits’ plan of action. They knew which beach he would arrive at based on the trajectory of his walking path - the eggheads figured that one out, I’m sure. The people in Iceland had already cleared a path all the way from the southeastern beach across the island to the northwest, right up to the water. Sure enough, he walked that exact path. Those eggheads know what’s best, apparently.

From that point forward, there weren’t many people in the way, which is for the best. We still followed him from a distance, of course. Observing him the whole way as he walked across Greenland. It was in the middle of the interior ice sheet where he finally stopped. After months of nonstop walking without a single break in stride, he had now fully come to a stop.

He didn’t stop for long, though. In a similar way to how he had originally climbed out of his frozen tomb, he was now digging his way down into the ice. He dug at a pretty quick pace, shattering and scraping away the ice without stopping, like a machine. As he dug straight down for hundreds of feet, a crowd of onlookers had formed at the opening of the hole, on the surface. Soldiers and scientists and journalists crowded around the hole, hoping to get a glimpse down into the ice. They wanted to know what he was after, I guess.

We’ll never know. He sealed himself inside there. No one is quite sure how he did that, exactly. But when they sent a camera down into the hole to spy on him, he was fully encased in ice. Suspended in time in the fetal position, just like he was when they found him.

You kids today won’t understand. You’ll ask what we did with him after. You’ll ask why we didn’t crack him out of the ice. You’ll ask where he came from, why he walked, what he was looking for. You kids today won’t understand. We didn’t do anything with him after. We didn’t dig him up because it’s none of our business to go digging him up. We’ll probably never know what he was, or where he came from, or why he walked to the north, and that’s okay. That’s okay because we aren’t entitled to know everything in the world.

Some things are better left alone.
