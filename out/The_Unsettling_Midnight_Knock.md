It was one of those nights where sleep comes slowly, hovering just out of reach. I had finally drifted off, half-asleep, when I was jolted awake by a peculiar sound—knock, knock, knock, knock. At first, I thought I might have been dreaming. The sound was faint but distinct, like a series of knocks, and they seemed to come from inside my bed. My heart raced as I tried to process what was happening.

Lying beside me, peacefully curled up in his usual spot, was Jerry, my adorable Maltese puppy. He’s my constant companion and usually a source of comfort, especially during these late-night hours. I immediately thought it could have been him causing the sound. But when I turned to check, Jerry was in deep sleep, breathing softly, completely undisturbed by the noise. I considered the possibility that he might have knocked against the bed in his sleep, but the knocking sound was too deliberate, too human-like to be accidental. I sat up, feeling a chill creep over me.

The room was dark, with only the faint glow of the streetlight filtering through the curtains. The house was silent, save for the soft hum of the refrigerator down the hall. I strained my ears, listening for any other noises, but there was nothing. Just the echo of those strange knocks lingering in my mind. The sound had been quick and precise, not something that could easily be attributed to an animal or the usual creaks and groans of an old house.

Still, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. I glanced at Jerry again. He remained fast asleep, blissfully unaware of my growing anxiety. I wanted to dismiss it, to rationalize the situation somehow. Maybe I had imagined the sound, a trick of my sleepy mind. But deep down, I knew I hadn’t. The knock had been real.

My curiosity got the best of me. I carefully climbed out of bed, not wanting to disturb Jerry, and tiptoed to the door. I opened it quietly and peered into the hallway. Nothing. The house was just as I had left it—silent and still. I checked the front door, thinking maybe someone had knocked outside and the sound had echoed in a strange way. But again, there was no one there, no sign of movement anywhere. The outside world was as calm as ever, adding to the eerie feeling building inside me.

I returned to the bedroom, feeling unsettled. The knock had definitely come from inside the bed, I was sure of it now. But how? My mind raced through the possibilities. Could it have been a rodent? No, the sound was too distinct, too deliberate. Could the house be settling in an unusual way? Perhaps, but it was hard to believe that creaking wood would mimic the exact rhythm of a knock.

The only theory I could come up with, as ridiculous as it seemed, was that somehow Jerry had managed to knock on the side of the bed in such a way that it sounded human. Maybe in his sleep, he had moved in a way that produced the sound. But when I looked at him again, so peacefully sleeping, the idea seemed less and less plausible. He was far too still to have just knocked and then immediately gone back to sleep.

I stood there for a few minutes, just watching him, half expecting the knock to return. But nothing happened. The room was silent once again. Yet, the unease lingered. I climbed back into bed, pulling the covers up to my chin. Jerry stirred slightly but remained asleep. I wished I could fall back asleep as easily as he did.

But every time I closed my eyes, the sound of that knock replayed in my mind. I was too scared to sleep now, afraid that I might hear it again, or worse, that I’d find out what—or who—had caused it. Was it my imagination playing tricks on me? Or was there something more sinister at play? I didn’t have any answers, but one thing was certain—I wasn’t going to sleep for the rest of the night.
