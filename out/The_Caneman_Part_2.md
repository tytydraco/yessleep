# The Caneman Part 2

I think that it's funny that I just decided to name my story “The Caneman Part 2”, like some slasher movie franchise. But in all honesty, I lack the creativity to come up with something else. A couple of days ago, I posted a small story under the same name, and got a few views. I appreciate all the support that I did get, albeit if it wasn’t massive. Writing scary stories is my passion, and the fact that anyone viewed it means the most to me. Actually, someone asked me if they could use my story in a Youtube video, which is one of the coolest things of all time. This is his Youtube Channel https://www.youtube.com/@ChillingTales12. I don’t know if he’ll still make it, but thank you anyway for even asking. Now I just need to get on CreepCast. You people are the reason that I keep writing. That, and that I have been called back South. 

My mother got in contact with me for the first time since I left Louisiana 4 years ago. Me and my parents had gotten into a pretty serious fight and I moved away to live with my grandpa on my mom’s side. She called me and I could immediately tell by her voice that she sounded much older, and exhausted. She told me that my father had recently passed away, and that I would be a pallbearer at his funeral. I said okay and she hung up in a split second.  Guess she’s still mad. 

I decided that I would go. If not for my parents, then to find out more information on what had happened that night 8 years ago. I’ll add on to my story day by day, and then post everything when I come back home. This is my chronicling of my trip back to where it all started. 

Log 1 - June 18, 2024: I arrived in my old town. It’s a lot smaller than I remembered, but I really never came out here, so I wasn’t very familiar anyway. It’s so strange, everywhere I go, people seem to avoid me. I just can’t find any groups of people. There are people in stores and stuff running their businesses, but it’s a little freaky.

I was pretty upset to find that the Ice Cream Shop had closed, and the owner passed away. His name was Brian, or something like that, and he was very good friends with my mother. On several occasions when I was young, I would stay with him for extended amounts of time. He would always give me a free scoop of chocolate ice cream if I went around the room and gave everyone compliments like “You look nice” or “I like your shirt.” I know that it’s weird, but he had helped me learn to socialize better than anyone else in this hick town. He might be the person I miss the most, even if he didn’t make the best business decisions.

Mom isn’t the librarian anymore, turns out she quit her job about a week ago. Weirdly, she quit her job the day before dad died. I didn’t bother going inside for nostalgia or anything, I’m not the biggest reader. I drove around for a little bit longer but found myself going down the same block over and over. Nothing else to do here. I checked into my hotel late at night, it’s pretty run down. 

How great. I walk into my room and they have 666 spray painted over the bed. Some kid I guess. It’s something I would probably do when I was younger, to freak someone out. Also, I know that it’s a normal practice for some hotels in the South to have mounted horns on the walls like buffalo or deer but how common is it to mount goat horns?

Log 2-June 19, 2024: I drove over to my old house today. As I rode further and further away from the town and the houses got more and more sparse, I realized just how truly isolated I was as a kid. If I had ever really gotten hurt, an ambulance might not have even had enough time to get to us. 

An hour and a half later, I pulled into my old driveway. My house looked the same, its brick walls and concrete pillars still as dirty as I remember. Random holes were dug into the yard, with the dirt from them all piled into one giant mound at the road. I saw my mom standing on the porch, staring at me with crossed arms. I wasn’t wrong about her sounding aged. She had massive bags under her eyes, and her face was encrusted by wrinkles. For a 44 year old, she could probably have registered for a 401K. She didn’t embrace me, didn’t say hello, but just stared at me. “Lunch is on the table” she said coldly, before walking back into the house. I followed her, and was shocked at how much had changed. We were never the most religious people, going to Church on Sundays and occasionally praying, but she must have had a radical conversion. Crucifixes hung all over the walls and statues of Mary were placed on every countertop. I had to duck my head to not knock down any rosary beads hanging from the ceiling.

“She must be losing it” I muttered to myself. She loved my father dearly, and his death must have hurt her much more than it did me. There wasn’t even any lunch on the table, just two empty plates laid out where my father and mother used to sit. I went from room to room, checking to see how much had changed. Every room resembled the living room, covered in religious iconography, except my room. The door was locked, but the key hung from a newly mounted hook drilled into the door. I pulled it down and opened the door with a loud squeak. It was as if it was frozen in time, like it was waiting for its old owner to come back. I placed my bags down and a cloud of dust kicked up. Everything in here hasn’t been touched, but I noticed that my window was broken. I examined it and noticed that something had broken in from the outside. Whatever it was must have been strong, it looked like a car window after someone is ejected in a crash. I went to ask my mom about it and she just said “Dogs.” I won’t be talking to her much. 

I walked outside and stood on our back porch. The sinking sun casted a filter of gold over everything. A slow breeze created waves that rippled through the cane in a rhythmic, trance-like motion. Waves of memories flooded back, many great times had been spent in those fields. My childhood had been here, and I couldn’t help but crack a smile. Yet it didn’t last long. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. It got so intense that I called out. “Hey! Is there someone there? Mom?” No response. 

Do you think that it’s the Caneman? Is it still after me? I didn’t stay long to find out. I’m gonna sleep on the couch tonight. The broken window in my room doesn’t sit right with me. I can’t wait to go home. The funeral is tomorrow, so I won’t have to be here for long. 

Log 3-June 19, 2024: Me and my mother drove over to our old Church, Saint Ann’s. My father had always told me that he wanted to be buried there, right along with his siblings. He was always quiet about them, and he never answered any of my questions about them. He would always divert any and every mention of them, and would never let my grandmother talk about their lives or anything. I checked my last post and after reading a comment, I’ve been more intrigued by my aunt and uncle than ever. The comment suggests that maybe one of them didn’t die but was changed into the Caneman. It doesn’t make much sense, but I can’t stop thinking about it. What if it’s true? Maybe I can save them or something. I’ll make sure to talk to my grandmother after the reception. She may tell me what my dad never would. 

I got out of my car and walked over to the small crowd standing under the Church’s pavilion. The crowd was mostly my mother’s side, with only grandma being from my dad’s. I sighed to myself and began working my way through the crowd, saying hello to everyone and shaking their hands with my head down. I did this so I won’t have to bother with them later. That was, until I was stopped by a very firm handshake. Everyone in my family is of a very distinct look, short and round and not very strong. That is, except for me and my dad. I almost had a heart attack thinking that it was him, until I saw who was shaking my hand. I looked up and saw Liam, only that he was not even remotely close to the person I remember. He was about 6’1, and had broad shoulders and very muscular arms. He was a very handsome guy, easily the best looking person here. “Hey man, how have you been?” he had asked me, not a quiver of fear in his voice, not even remotely the Liam I remember. He sounded confident in what he was saying, something that I wasn’t. 

“Pretty good I guess.” I replied. We talked a little about life and things. He joined the military, which explains all the changes. I told him about my job as a mechanic and he looked at me with what I can only describe as amusement, before walking away. I then began to search for my grandma, but couldn’t find her. Before I knew it, the funeral had begun.

It was a closed casket funeral, something that didn’t sit right with me. The few times my dad did discuss how he wanted to be laid to rest, he made absolutely certain that everyone knew that he wanted an open casket. 

An eternity later, and I was saying my goodbyes to everyone. I couldn’t find my grandma, so I figured she must not have come. I saw that Liam was making his way over to me. “Hey Dawson, the Sunflower Festival is in two days and I got nobody to go with me. You think you could stick around just a bit longer? It wouldn’t hurt.” I told him I would think about it and we parted. I probably won’t go. I then found my grandma, sitting away from everyone and knitting quietly in a corner. She was (other than Liam) the only person happy to see me. She was as sweet and kind as I remembered, and smothered me in kisses as soon as she saw me. Her Cajun accent was still ridiculously heavy, but I could still talk to her easily. She offered for me to stay the night at her house and I accepted. Mom wouldn’t mess with my stuff, at least I hope not. We talked about all the curveballs that life has thrown at me. After a while, I started to ask questions. A lot of questions. I think I overwhelmed her, because she shushed me. “In the morning, in the morning.”

She didn’t speak to me much after that, and I got situated in the guest room. A lot more comfy than the couch I should add. She insisted that she tuck me in and after a bit of resistance, I complied. She gave me a stuffed bear that she deemed “Sheen” and then moved over to the dresser near the closet. “Oh, I have something for you.” She reached into a drawer and pulled out a chain with some sort of bone attached. She pulled down the collar of her shirt and showed me that she had one as well. “It is a gator’s tooth. It will bring you good luck and crop fertility. Our ancestors wore this when they arrived from Nova Scotia. My mother gave me this one on my neck and I want to give you one from me. To let you know that Gueule loves you!” I took the necklace, thanked her, and she left. It had some sort of weird rune on it. It looked like a snake eating itself. I put it under the bed where she couldn’t see it. There is no way that I’m going to wear something like that. 

Log 4-June 20, 2024: I had the worst nightmare last night. I dreamt that I was back in the canefield on that night. I’ve had this nightmare several times but this was different. When I eventually confronted the Caneman, it wasn’t them. It was my dad, and he was trying to speak to me but I couldn’t understand him. He was muffled. He tried and tried to tell me, picking me up and shaking me. He kept shaking and shaking me as he silently screamed at me, his eyes wide with seriousness. I suddenly woke up and found my grandma softly shaking me. She cooked me breakfast, and told me to meet her on the porch. I ate up and followed her outside. I’ll do my best to write down the whole conversation; 

“How are you this morning?”

“Good good! I’m so happy that these old eyes can see my little Chiot has grown so big!”

Chiot was her nickname for me. Actually, now that I think about it, she has never actually said my real name. I don’t even know if she knows it. On the few occasions that she would visit (my father didn’t like me being around her), she would only call me that. Actually, dad would never let her come visit. She would often just show up on her own.

“Yeah, life has been something.” 

“Yes yes, it has. Now, you wanted to ask me questions? So many questions! You almost gave Gueule a heart attack!”

Gueule is grandma in French. It’s what she wanted everyone to call her. I could barely contain my excitement as I began to ask her. I would finally be getting my answers.

“So Gueule, what ever happened to dad’s brother and sister? He told me that they were killed by coyotes but I wanted to hear it from you. If you’re comfortable with that.”

Her face dropped instantly. She took a sip of her coffee and turned to face the rising sun. She muttered something in French and began to speak, not taking her eyes off of the horizon. 

“Yes, Gabriel and Nicholas were taken by the beasts. We buried them that same day. Your father didn’t like it but he didn’t understand. They didn’t listen to God, and he punished them for it.”

I was shocked, speechless for a moment. I then asked the only reasonable thing that I could think of.

“Gueule, what does that mean? With God and all.”

“Oh Chere, how little you know. How wrong you have learned. Lent is the most sacred of all traditions. We Christians must follow in Christ’s ways if we seek eternity, life forever. Only fools would disobey God. His divine armor comes only to those who are willing to sacrifice. Something your father couldn’t understand.”

I started to think that maybe my grandmother wasn’t as mentally sound as she seemed. She might be going through some sort of alzheimers. She was always religious, so maybe her mind was turning towards some past memories of worship.

“But, but that makes no sense. What does Lent have to do with anything? And dad? Are you okay grandma? You look a little-”

She snapped her head towards me, her face more serious than I had ever seen it. Her dark blue eyes pierced through me. Her gaze, it made me so uncomfortable, almost as if I was staring into the sun. I looked down, breaking her gaze. She continued to stare at me. 

“Chiot, what do you know of our family? Where do we come from?”

“Aren’t we from here? You lived here all your life.”

“NO YOU FOOL!” she screamed at me, slamming her fist into her rocking chair’s armrest. I had never heard my grandmother scream before.

“Don’t be stupid garçon! That is what they taught you but they lie! Our family, our ancestors, where were they really from?”

I didn’t answer her. It was clear that she was having some sort of dementia related breakdown, or something. I knew that she was probably not the safest person to be around.

“I don’t, I don’t know.” I got up and began to back away. I needed something to get me out of here, so I said the first thing that came to mind. 

“I think that Liam wanted me to go hang out with him today. I should probably not leave him wait-”

“Lies, the second greatest sin against God. I thought that they would have taught you better than that, but all they do is teach lies. The Sunflower Festival is tomorrow.”

“How did you…”

I had never told my grandmother that I was going to the festival, or that I was going with Liam. Something wasn’t right. I mumbled some other excuse to her and started making my way to my car. 

“The Acadians Chiot, we come from the Acadians. And you will be taught.” she yelled at me from the porch. She then began to sing some sort of folk song as she slowly rocked back and forth in her chair. I smiled and nodded before slamming my car door much harder than I should. I don’t think that I have ever driven so fast in my life. I won’t be seeing my grandmother again anytime soon, and worst of all, now all I have is more questions. I went back to my old house and spent the rest of the day sorting through my old junk. All I found was old toys and an old Xbox 360 that I don’t remember owning. There isn’t anything to do out here, so I booted it up. I spent the rest of the day revisiting my old Minecraft worlds, trying to pass the time. I’ll stay for the Sunflower Festival to not leave Liam alone, but after that, I’m getting the hell out of here. 

Log 5-June 22 2024: I’m at the hospital right now. They managed to get me out of critical condition and the fracture wasn’t as bad as they thought. The police interrogated me, and found that I was innocent. I don’t know what to do, I’m so lost. This stupid subreddit is my only comfort, and it’s a small one. This town is a bloodbath, and it’s out to get me. I know that it’s only fair that I detail my day, even if this might be the last thing I write. This is my best effort to relay yesterday. You may even be able to give me some sort of answers. I have to get some answers. I need answers.

I woke up to the sound of a car horn. I walked out the front door and saw Liam leaning out of his window, waving at me. I saw in his car that he had about three or four other girls in there. “Well what are you waiting for? Got on in here buddy!” he called to me. He told me that he had nobody to go with him, the first lie. 

I hesitated before haphazardly slipping into the middle seat in the back. Liam zoomed out of my driveway before he turned to the girl next to him. “You know, Dawson here saved my life.” Liam told the girls. “How?” I asked, sitting up in my seat. “Well a while back I stayed at his place and we decided to go out at night into the canefield. I was really scared as a kid, and a wimp. But Dawson here, he was as brave as could be. He wasn’t scared of anything, and led me as we walked. Well all of a sudden, a bear jumps out and tries to kill me! I was so scared that I peed my pants! But Dawson here, calm as can be, takes a knife he brought and jams it into the bear's eye! He then pulls me out from under it and he carries me all the way back home. To this day, Dawson has got to be the bravest guy I have ever met.” The second lie.

I didn’t say anything. I don’t know if Liam was trying to make me seem like less of a loser to his friends or what, but he surely made me embarrassed. They all started to ask questions and I quietly diverted all of them, unable to properly hold up the story, the lie. They eventually lost interest and we arrived in town. I think he knew how he made me feel, because he kept looking at me through the mirror. We then went to a bar, “The Cypress Knee.” My mother used to drink here.

I didn’t drink but Liam and his friends sure did. Shot after shot. After maybe 6 or 7 shots, Liam checked his pockets and let out a cry.

“Oh shit, I’m out of cash. Hey Dawson, could you do me a favor buddy? I didn’t bring my wallet. I’ll pay you back I swear.” All of his friends started staring at me too. I couldn’t take it. 

“Sure.” I quietly muttered. Liam thanked me again and again before going to the bathroom. I noticed that he had dropped something on the floor. It was his wallet. I placed it back on the table to see if I could get him to realize that he was caught, but he didn’t even acknowledge me, just slipping it back into his pocket. The third lie. 

$110 and 5 shots later, and I finally managed to nag Liam enough to leave. I was the designated driver of course. Like hell I would let Liam or his stupid friends get me killed in this God awful town.

The Sunflower Festival was the only large celebration in my town other than Halloween and Mardi Gras. It really didn’t make much sense, because the only two crops here are sugarcane and soy beans. The festival was more or less an excuse for all of the adults in town to get their kids away while they go drinking. My mom would bring me here as a kid and I never noticed how poorly she spoke or walked, and how badly her breath stunk. I don’t know why she drank so much in those early days, but I don’t really care. The Sunflower Festival is just a bunch of cheap Louisiana themed booths that are all rigged and or a safety hazard. I never took notice as a kid, I was just happy that my mom was there and that prizes were involved. I knew that it was not the best back then, but now I didn’t have childlike wonder to mask just how horrible it was. There was nobody there save for a few parents and their kids, a bunch of drunk teenagers, and a bunch of gross looking men tending the booths. Everything looked so dirty and cheap. 

“Liam, I think that I’m going to go. I can get a ride with somebody.” He was talking to one of the girls, a redhead who wore ridiculously thick perfume. He shifted his whole body to face me, but his head didn’t follow him, it stayed leaning on his shoulder. His eyes spun around in his head to face me and he smiled. “You’re such a buzzkill man. Do you ‘ver do anything fun? I mean…” he then turned and started talking to one of the girls, like I wasn’t there. I guess that he didn’t really care, and I wanted to have gotten something out of my last day here, so I stayed.

I turned towards one of the booths and saw that it was a pop balloon game styled like a rabbit hunt. All the balloons lined up on the wall had rabbit faces drawn on them and paper rabbit ears taped on. I gave the very obese owner some money and picked up the gun. It felt heavier than it should. I fired at a balloon and the gun slammed into my shoulder, a loud crack echoing out as the shot fired. I looked down at it and opened up the mag, it was a real gun. “What the hell? You let kids use this? I should call the police!” I yelled at the tender. He just spat some dip onto the ground and mumbled something about snowflakes. I placed the gun down and went to another booth. Some shitty whack-a-mole but instead of moles it was nutria rats. Booth after booth, disappointment and disappointment, and my day just got shittier and shittier. If only I knew how bad it would get. 

There was only one booth left to try. After that, I was going home. I was about to pay when Liam grabbed my shoulder from behind. He pointed at a nearby platform while holding a beer.

“Bro, you should go try… You should try the… The Oyster shucking contest! They have some hot chicks over there and don’t tell anybody-” he leaned up to my ear, “But I saw that bitch in red staring at you. Her tits man, her tits…” His breath was so rancid that I instinctively shoved him off of me. He stumbled back before regaining his balance. He looked up at me with eyes filled with rage. 

“You’re just a little shit, you know that? You come home to see everyone but nobody here loves you. Everyone hates you. You are just a big loser, you were a loser back then too.” He started to stumble towards me.

“Back then… Back then… Like a… Like a little bitch! Maybe you should just leave! Or- or kill yourself. Yeah, blow your brains out like your dad…” I couldn’t take it anymore. I sprang towards him and punched him in the side of his face. He recoiled back before crashing into the rabbit hunt stand. His eyes wildly searched for me and he started mumbling incoherent slurs. 

“I’m done with your bullshit Liam. I’m going.” I passed by him to head to the parking lot, but he was a lot quicker that I thought he was. He grabbed both of my shoulders and slammed me down into the pavement. As he did, he fell on top of me. Somewhere nearby, a man was screaming. 

He pounded his fists into my face. My eyes began to water and I couldn’t see. Liam got off of me and I felt something hard slam into my side. I could feel something crack. I screamed louder. Several men came to hold Liam back but none of them did. I opened my eyes and saw why.

“Not so fun… To be the punching bag crybaby, is it?” 

Liam was holding the gun from the balloon stand. He was smiling at me. The barrel was pointed directly at my face. That’s when it happened.

Like a freight train, something crashed into Liam. The gun fired, deafening my ears. He missed. Liam flew back, colliding into a metal pole. He slumped over and his head began to bleed. I looked back at what had done this, and my breathing stopped. Looming over me was a gigantic black beast that was glaring at Liam, panting. I knew what it was, but I couldn’t move. My ribs hurt too much, and fear paralyzed me. 

The creature then bounded towards Liam on all fours. Imagine a greyhound chasing a stationary toy, an unstoppable force moving towards a very movable object. In no time, the Caneman was on Liam. It hit him over and over, but Liam didn’t move. He must have lost consciousness. After the creature must have come to the same conclusion, it placed both of its hands into Liam’ mouth. With a terrifying amount of force, it split his head in two, like a pistachio. A waterfall of blood trailed behind the top of his skull as it went flying. It was almost beautiful, like a splash of red paint slashed onto a canvas. What am I saying? Maybe I have lost it. Bloodshed does that to a person. 

A nearby woman with her child immediately took out a small handgun, and unloaded several rounds into it. She was more brave than me. I just laid on the ground and watched. The bullets pierced the thing and it unleashed an otherworldly roar. The woman and child covered their ears, and she dropped her gun. It launched towards her and crushed her torso with the weight of its body. She was dead in an instant. The woman’s child began to scream, but was silenced by the creature. Men from all around the festival began to advance on it, wielding whatever sort of weapon they could find. None survived. A few people were able to land hits on the creature, but it didn’t do anything except make it more mad. It violently tore through the men, hacking and slashing, pounding and tearing into them even after they were dead. Imagine again, a big dog getting a hold of a room full of toys, biting and flinging them around. And after it got its kick out of the men, it turned its attention towards the onlooking families. 

I won’t go into the details of the deaths, due to their graphic nature and the fact that a significant amount of the casualties were children. I don’t want to explain it anyway, it’s got me fucked up in the head just writing it down. I don’t know whether to scream or cry but all I can do is lay down in my bed and write this damn story. 

As the last few people were being mutilated, I snapped back to reality. I noticed that Liam had dropped the gun right next to my foot when he got flung. I mustered whatever willpower I had and stood up, grabbing the gun. I pointed the gun at it and pulled the trigger. The bullet exploded out of the barrel and embedded itself into the back of the creature's head. The creature screamed louder than ever, but I didn’t cover my ears, the pain didn’t matter to me. It whipped itself around to face its attacker. As soon as it saw me, its expression changed. There was no more anger, no more rage, but what could only be described as bitter sadness. It stood straight up, its arm dangling at its side. Everything went silent. The only sounds being the dual breathing of me and the monster standing in front of me. It raised one of its arms, then put it down, like it changed its mind. It made a noise with its mouth. 

“Daaaaaawwwwsoooon”

It raised its arm again and began to beckon for me to come closer, but all I did was eject the shell of the rifle. The creature’s face grew serious, and I swear that it sighed, like it was disappointed or something. It quickly turned and fled. I shot at it but I don’t know if I missed or not, and I doubt it matters. That’s when I heard the police sirens. When they arrived, they saw about thirty three people dead and the only survivor holding a gun. I was handcuffed faster than you would believe. I was then taken to the hospital where I am now.

 I need answers. And I know where to get them. Before I left the festival, I saw that something had fallen off of the creature. It was a necklace, a necklace that happened to have an alligator’s tooth stringed onto it, with a snake carved into it. I know what I’m going to do. I’m going to go see my grandma, and for the first time, I will know what the hell is going on. The doctor said that the latest that I could leave would be in five days, but he strongly advises against it. It doesn't matter what he thinks. I could die for all I care. But not before I know the truth.
