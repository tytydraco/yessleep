For those of you who don't watch tiktok, there's been a trend going around with some creepy doppelganger videos. The video usually starts with a person doing something normal, with an audio that says something like "If you see another person that looks identical to you, run away and hide." Then it'll cut to a creepy duplicate of said person usually peaking from a closet or around the corner. 

  I don't really make videos that often, but this looked like a trend I'd have a little bit of fun with, so about a week ago, I made my own video. 

    My friends and I were having a couple drinks while one of them helped me film the duplicate part. We all laughed a little bit about the end part and how creepy I looked, but something about it unsettled me a little bit more than it should have. I just had this pit in my gut, an overwhelming sense of dread that made me nauseas. 

  The night eventually ended and my friends went home for the night. I took my dog out one last time and then laid down for bed and turned my tv on for background noise. 

   I tossed and turned for while, still a bit on edge, but I eventually dozed off to a random King Of The Hill episode.

  I woke up to static coming from my TV,  I shifted my eyes to look at the time. *"3:06AM"* the bright alarm clock beamed. 

  I heard my closet door slowly creak open. My eyes darted toward the door, and my body and limbs trembled in fear, but were unable to move. I watched in horror as I saw a hand begin to creep out from the closet and wrapped itself around the doorframe. 

  My heart began beating faster and my breathing became rapid. The creature slowly started crawling from it's hiding space.The light from the tv illuminated a wide, toothy grin as the face came more into focus. 

   To my horror the person hiding in my closet was a duplicate version of me. Except she had dark circles under her eyes, and a smile too wide to be human. Her eyes were glassy and dead. There was also something off about her. Something dark. 

  She stood at the foot of my bed just smiling and staring down at me. She waved at me, and at that moment I shot up in bed, pouring sweat and gasping for air. My duplicate no loger there. My dog whined and licked my face to try to calm me, but even with her there I didn't feel safe.

  I told myself it was just sleep paralysis, but I was still disturbed. I tried to go about my day as best as I could. The next morning however, I couldn't explain what I found. 

  I walked into the kitchen to grab some breakfast and saw a note on the counter in my handwriting. It read *"I will replace you. I am the better you."* over and over again. I was terrified, no, I still *am* terrified because I couldn't recall writing anything like that. 

  I called my friend, and she tried to reassure me that I was just a little freaked out because of the nightmare I had, and that maybe I had written the note half asleep and just didn't remember it. 

  It didn't really help, in fact, it made me feel like I was losing my mind, and maybe I am, but something happened a couple nights ago that made me get a hotel. 

  I awoke to a loud crash coming from inside my house. My dog was barking and growling like crazy, so I grabbed the baseball bat from my closet that I keep for "just in case", and began tiptoeing down the hallway. I flipped the light switch, but the light wouldn't come on. 

  I peered down the hall as my eyes adjusted to the darkness. In the dim moonlight streaming in from the window, I could see my utility closet at the end of the hallway was open. My blood turned to ice as I called out into the dark. 

   "I-if anyone's in here, just know I'm calling the police!" I stammered out. I heard a small chuckle come from the closet and then a voice- *my* voice, called my dogs name and I watched in shock as my dog darted out from behind me and stopped in front of the door, her body tense with fear as she let out a low growl. 

  *"NYLA NO!"* I screamed, but I was too late. A pair of arms reached out from the closet and grabbed Nyla, pulling her into the closet. The door slammed shut as she yelped. 

  I sprinted toward the door, and frantically tried to open it, but it wouldn't budge. I turned to run and grab my phone to call 911, and I heard the door swing open behind me. Out walked my huskie, seemingly unharmed.

  I rushed toward the closet and pulled the cord for the light, but the closet was empty except for the Hvac and water heater. 

  I didn't want to stay in that house any longer, so I grabbed a few things and Nyla and checked into a hotel near by where I've been staying since. 

  I don't know what to do. I can't go back to that house by myself, and Nyla hasn't been acting right. She's been growling at me, and even bit my arm the other day, and I had to get stitches. I don't understand. She's never been aggressive before. It's like it's not *"her"* anymore...

  I took her to the vet yesterday and they said she's physically in perfect condition, but there's something not quite right about her eyes. It's like she's staring straight through me.
