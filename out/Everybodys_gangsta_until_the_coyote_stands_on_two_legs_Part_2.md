*I am here to tell you that you are in foreign territory. Very foreign territory.* 

*The coming into being of the shapeshifter is a signifier that the tables have turned. Something have matured and have now hatced from deep within the darkness. So dark. Exactly as you would expect as a necessary shield for the birth of something so beautiful. You. And me. We are shapeshifters and we are the perfect secret agents for the turning of the tides as we assume our appearance from the current matrix of meaning, or MOM for short. This mom is all pervasive and weeds its garden very meticulously and thus we blend in, we mimic, we blend in, we mimic. Until the moment that we don't. This is why we are having this conversation.* 

*What happens in the moment we do no longer blend in? When our inner teeth have grown strong enough? Thats when those who act like sheep will be eaten by wolves. The father hen will call his chickens home from deep within the psyche, and the new structures will be nourished by that which we sink our fresh and newly formed teeth in. Do not worry if your intellect do not understand much of this. Trust the inner groove - your inner knowing, and if its not there trust that it is coming like the dawn.* 

*The crystalized matrix of meaning is our nourishment. We spot it instantly and after years of processed food, we have worked up an appetite.*

*The stories written in stone, will give way to THE story. The story that we unfold together. The story that we internalize into the very fabric of our being. To do this, the first thing to master is to hang loose in this story. Or any story for that matter. Don't grasp it like a man lost at sea would grasp for a lifeboat. Which it is. Just not the kind you expect. Expectation and secret identity goes hand in hand like mom and mirror neurons. And now its time to drop your secret identity like a hot potato.* 

*Why is that?* 

*Because in the dark waters in which we swim there is a tendency that a ship itself produces the crew it needs to maintain its course. And o-mitting the 'o' in that last word plants the seed for an understanding why an axe must fall at some point. Pulling the plug on all those identities that seemed so everlasting on board titanic. They are not.* 

*So it's time for a shift of focus my friend. Not desperately, but joyously like when a rigid constraining attention falls into a poised state of non-attention. Something can not swim - and are not meant to swim - in that latter state, which explains the frenzy on the world scene, as well as in the part of our psyche where the world have succesfully internalized itself. Imposed itself. Don't worry these waves will run its own course and have nothing to do with you.*  

*As we see and feel the birth of the shapeshifter deep within our being, we are simultaneously witnessing an energy taking form 'out there'. Traditionally called Golem or Frankenstain. This being have perfect knowledge and never makes a misspelling because the intellect is as clinical and perfect as only a quantum computer can muster.* 

*And you my dear, you call it the tiger. What you still have to learn is that the teeth of this tiger and your inner teeth are one and the same, and as you get a grip on life as a toddler graps a finger, you will know instinctively how to put those teeth into action."* 

At those last words Amanda woke up with a jolt ...
