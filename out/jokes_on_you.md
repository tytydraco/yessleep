the girl in white

hi, im a girl who loves the paranormal. Since I was little I have been able to see ghosts and other paranormal activity’s. Something that has been brought to my attention is a little girl about 104 cm, long brown hair infront of her face and a white dress. Has anyone seen or heard of this girl? I have never done oujia before so i don’t know who it is. She follows me, is in mirrors and a bit everywhere. this isnt strange since i’ve a bit of a paranormal person in general but this is new, i can’t even go out without feeling the presence of her. when i come out of the shower i usually see her behind me. once i saw a lady with long,black hair and white dress in my room, she usually just stares tho.

Hi again, it's been a few months since I wrote this. there is some evil demon is with me. Big smile, big eyes and a playing look. Did I really see it or was it just me seeing things? The panic hits me of course. Evil eye bracelets don't work, I've learned now. They have disappeared without a trace and I have no idea where they are. Poof, gone. Now as I write this someone is standing at my door. how can i escape this horrifying mess?? i have this friend called julie. she helps me with everything paranormal.

Haunted by the persistent presence of the girl in the white dress, I decided to confide in my friend Julie about the unnerving experiences. Julie, with a background in psychology and a pragmatic approach, suggested exploring more conventional explanations before jumping to the paranormal.

We began by examining my surroundings for possible environmental factors contributing to the perceived apparitions. Faulty wiring or unusual reflections in mirrors were scrutinized, and we even brought in experts to assess the structural integrity of my home.

As we delved into psychological factors, Julie recommended consulting with a mental health professional to rule out any potential underlying issues. Together, we navigated the complexities of the mind, exploring stressors and anxieties that might manifest as ghostly encounters.

In parallel, we explored the local history to uncover any relevant incidents that might explain the presence of the spectral entities. Our findings led us to an old neighborhood with a history of tragic events, providing a plausible link to the apparitions.

Armed with a more rational understanding, I implemented practical solutions. Improving lighting conditions, addressing environmental factors, and seeking support for any psychological stressors became part of a holistic approach to regain a sense of normalcy.

Over time, the unsettling experiences lessened as I addressed both the tangible and psychological aspects. The girl in the white dress, once a constant companion in my daily life, gradually faded into the background, leaving me to navigate a more grounded reality.At night, I sometimes wake up but can't move or speak. It's called sleep paralysis. During these moments, I see weird things, like shadows or the girl in the white dress. It's like a bad dream, but I'm awake.

I found out that sleep paralysis is a normal thing that happens to many people. It's when your body and mind don't sync up properly when you're waking up. This made me feel a bit better, but it didn't explain everything.

The creepy encounters with the girl in the white dress still puzzle me. Sometimes, it feels like more than just my mind playing tricks. but please, help me. i cant do this anymore, help.
