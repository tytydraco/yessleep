Here I go again. Another one for the journal. At this point, writing out strange incidents has become cathartic to me. Yes, I had to look up that word. Don't judge; you know full well that English is not my first language.

The morning after the [playground-incident,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13gjpwd/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_does_anybody/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) I woke up to a text on my phone. I immediately knew who'd sent it even though I didn't have the number saved. 

***"I hope you're well. Are you going to come by the [diner](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13fnc4u/stuck_on_earth_and_looking_for_a_job_everyone/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) today?"***

I got up and stumbled to the kitchen. The fridge was empty, singling my breakfast options down to the brown banana I found wedged between the couch cushions. When had I last gone out to buy groceries? As I swallowed the last bite, my phone buzzed again. New text, same number.

***"Can we talk?"***

I went about washing the dishes, leaving my phone on the table until I got dressed and headed out to the store. As I was browsing the aisles, I felt my phone buzz through the fabric of my jacket. After I'd returned home and filled the fridge, I finally allowed myself to check the new messages. One was from Nettie, asking whether I wanted to have lunch with her at Tom's Diner around twelve. I texted her yes before moving on to the other one.

***"I'm sorry I got you hurt. If you don't want to talk to me again, I understand. But I need you to know that I'm insanely grateful for what you did."***

Tom's Diner is always bursting at the seams around this time of day. Just about everyone working in or around town appears to take their lunch there. Nettie Peterson was sitting tucked away in a corner booth. When I sat down across from her, she presented me with a tired smile. "Good to see you, baby girl," she muttered. I frowned; Nettie calling people nicknames is indicative of extreme exhaustion. 

"Are the larvae troubling you?" I inquired. 

"Yup. I need to be back in half an hour, too. Georgette is watching them right now so I could clear my head for a bit and it's nap time anyways… But it's fingerpainting day, so…" She shrugged off her jacket to reveal three tiny, colorful handprints on the shirt she was wearing underneath. "On another note, remember our plans for Saturday? Kit's concert?"

My brows shot up. Kit Sutton really did have a special gig coming up. A bunch of local musicians were due to perform on a small stage down by the shore. This was an annual event, repeating every year around the time when spring turned into summer. My roommate had already played there two years ago, leading to her getting banned for the following spring concert. This year however, she had been invited back. I was sure she was going to be far more well received, granted she wouldn't play her self-composed piece "Ode To A Tapeworm" again. 

"I didn't know you were planning to attend," I told Nettie. "You always complain about Kit's music, I thought you didn't like it."

"Not at all! That woman's voice is… *wonderful*. Her lyrics are what throws me off, but even so, this is about supporting local artists." She grinned. "And I asked Elijah to come."

"That's nice. But just so you know, I'm not interested in him. We had fun hanging out, though."

Nettie grunted. "Shame. But hey, I'm glad you two get along. That means we can all meet up together."

"I guess."

"And you could bring Kit. I know I've said some… *things* about her in the past, but I haven't seen her in so long now…" Nettie's voice trailed off and she shrugged, playing with a strand of her hair. I believe she continued to speak, but I found myself distracted when a familiar figure drew close.

My throat turned dry when I locked eyes with the waiter. His features were still and impassive, the corners of his mouth lifted in a customer service-type smile that didn't reach his eyes. He leaned over to place a steaming plate in front of my best friend, and, to my surprise, a glass of coconut water in front of me. 

"I didn't order anything," I stated.

"I know," the server replied, straightening up and clutching the tray to his midriff. "It's free."

I slowly reached out to wrap my fingers around the glass, holding his gaze. "Thank you." At this, he let out that same soft gasp that morphed into a genuine smile. He then turned to leave, hastily moving on to attend the other tables. Nettie stared after him, slowly shaking her head as I drank down a long swallow. When the waiter came back to collect the payment soon after, he nudged a paper cup of cocoa into my hands. "For the road."

I raised a brow. "Free again? Are you paying for these or…?"

"Depends; I'll find out if and when my boss brings it up."

I did take the cup with me as I followed my savior human outside. Nettie's brows were knitted in bewilderment, but she refrained from commenting. It was only when I got home that I noticed the message scrawled onto the bottom of the cup. ***"Are you okay?"*** That's when I finally sat down and wrote out a response to the server's texts. 

*"I'm fine. Excuse the silence. I didn't know what to say to you so I said nothing. I'm glad I could help."*

I got no response.

The rest of the week passed by uneventfully. The only thing out of the ordinary were Kit's levels of excitement. There was not a moment without her singing or plucking away at the strings of her guitar. I'm pretty sure she was doing it in her sleep as well. Which brings us to today. The concert started at five p.m., and the stretch of beach where the stage had been erected was already packed. The temperature had shifted these last couple days. It wasn't as cold anymore and I spotted a few folks tentatively wearing their short-sleeves, cautionary jackets tucked under their arms. 

Nettie and her cousin were waiting for me by the ticket booth. Both greeted me with a hug, and while Elijah Carter's was far more hesitant, I could sense genuine warmth in it. "Did you tell Nettie what went down?" he asked quietly when he was close to my ear. I whispered "no" and he nodded, shooting me a knowing look as he drew away. We joined the crowd in front of the empty stage where music was already droning from the speakers while the performers still appeared to be getting ready. 

After a couple minutes, the beat got louder as the event moderator climbed up onto the platform—Mary Markov, the local news anchor. She had a hand in almost every public event in town. She announced the first band with great enthusiasm. "Out of towners," Nettie remarked, rolling her eyes. They played four original songs, followed up by a small cover band who performed something by *Blondie* and *Guns n' Roses*. I liked them just fine, but I was honestly itching to see Kit come up. My savior human obviously shared the sentiment. When Miss Markov stepped up and called my roommate's name, Nettie squealed and slapped Elijah's upper arm repeatedly.

This was obviously some kind of signal between the two of them—her cousin sighed, bent down and allowed her to climb onto his broad shoulders. "There she is," Nettie announced, and I craned my neck to see a head of bright blue hair moving up the side of the stage. Out of all the people present, my roommate's outfit was the most eye-catching. Long fishnet stockings drew attention to both her combat boots and her ripped shorts. She sported a purple vest that left her stomach uncovered, a black bra underneath.

"Oh, but she's gotta be cold," Nettie blurted out. "She should cover up, sh-she'll catch death in that!"

Elijah laughed and poked her in the calf. "You're just confused by her abs, aren't you?"

"I'm personally curious about what she'll be performing," I confessed. The cover band seemed to be playing alongside her for the backdrop. Miss Markov looked slightly confused as she read out what was on her card. "…here to bring us some of her very own, original music, starting off with *A Quick One, While My Roomie's Gone*."

My stomach sank.

"Oh dear God," Eli muttered.

Kit stepped up to the microphone, smiling silently before wrapping both hands around it, nodding to the musicians behind her. When the baseline dropped, she set her voice singing. It effortlessly carried across the beach, sweeping the crowd away like a tidal wave. This had to be the best performance I had ever seen from her. Her pitch was high and almost a tad girly, conveying a childish kind of innocence, but it was perfectly evened out by its gravelly, husky warmth. The lyrics were… well, telling; but it was, in short, a damned good song. 

"Can you lift me, too?" I asked Eli.

"What do you women take me for, a jungle gym?" He grunted. "Nettie and I made a pact a bajillion years ago and I swore to carry her on my shoulders whenever she wants."

Nettie grinned down at me. "I'm sorry, but this is just too much fun," she shouted against the noise. "Go up to the front, Kit might see you there!"

I began to resolutely push past the cheering masses. I made it almost all the way to the bottom of the stage, where sadly, I arrived at a roadblock consisting of a group of very tall, muscular males who were hopping up and down with their arms waving—apparently, the town's football team was in attendance. Getting past that particular congregation was impossible. Kit would never spot me behind their massive backs. Gnawing on my lower lip in frustration, I attempted to weave through, failing and nearly getting knocked over by a backwards swinging arm. I fell against something solid, and suddenly, hands moved to prop me up.

"Careful, sunshine."

I whirled around and my eyes grew wide when landing on the server. He regarded me in his usual, slightly methodical fashion, but the corners of his mouth—only the corners—were lifted. Someone was trying to move past him from behind, so I acted without thinking and grabbed onto the lapels of his coat to pull him out of the way, which just so happened to be right up against me. 

It was mostly accidental.

The server let out a low gasp, smile widening into a very blatant grin. I instantly released him, but neither of us took a step back. "You're here," I stated.

His jaws kept steadily kneading his chewing gum. "Your situational awareness astounds me." 

"You didn't respond to my text."

"I wasn't sure you wanted me to."

"I did."

"Well, I'm here now… if there's anything you'd like to discuss."

I looked him over. He was not much taller than myself, but it would likely be sufficient. "Well-met," I said.

He tilted his head, eyes widening almost sweetly. "Why's that, sunshine?"

"You can lift me up."

The waiter snorted with partially suppressed laughter. Then he bent down and hooked his arm around the crook of my knees in one swift motion before straightening up again, raising me several feet off the ground. I reflexively grabbed onto his shoulder with one hand while the other one flew to his head. This new position offered me a good view of the crowd and the stage. "Not what I expected, but it works," I commented, sparing him a quick glance. 

"I'm glad," he replied, tone airy and unbothered. 

Kit looked perfectly within her element as she moved on to her second song, *Dogs vs Geese*. Nothing seemed to perturb her; not the bustling of the crowd below, not the murmurs of the ocean she so hated, not the wind ruffling her hair and blowing open her vest. I was overcome with an inexplicable sense of pride. I waved to her, we locked eyes and her mouth stretched into a beatific smile. I gave her a thumbs-up. Satisfied, I was about to relieve the waiter of his duties, only to find him staring up at me, his lips parted in an expression I couldn't define. I caught a glimpse of the pink gum between his teeth.

I became very aware of the feeling of his hair around my fingers. I had almost been digging them into his scalp, very nearly pulling on the golden curls. I hurried to relax my grip, but I couldn't bring myself to let go. Instead, I began to run my palm over the top of his head, fascinated by the texture of the silky tendrils grazing my skin. 

"Is this okay?" I asked.

"Please don't stop," he blurted out. "I mean… just… yeah. I don't mind."

I stayed seated in his arm for a while longer, absently playing with the waiter's hair, bunching it up and twirling it around my fingers. He had begun to sway slightly to the music, somehow managing to safely rock me along instead of shaking me off. I had that same lingering feeling his presence always instilled in me. A warm, prickly sensation that’s almost electrifyingly energizing. My eyes never strayed from Kit’s dancing form, almost afraid to look down. When she finished her second song, she bowed, then jumped and thrust her fist into the air. “And this next one I like to call *Fuck The Pho Lice* or *Noodle Bugs Unite*!”

“I'm glad she’s keeping things PG for the concert,” I said to the waiter by way of conversation, still not meeting his gaze.

“This is PG?”

“Her approximation of it.” Suddenly, the pleasant pinprick sensation was gone. I narrowed my eyes, trying to zero in on Kit’s face. She suddenly seemed kind of… off. Her expression wasn’t as relaxed, her tone wasn’t as steady as before. To anyone else, it might have seemed like an affected little shiver for the sake of the song, but I *knew* this woman. I knew most of her lyrics by heart. I knew her cadence, her different tempos for each piece, the way she favored the easier chords on her six-string. I’ve had to listen to them all for hours on end. And despite the distance between us, I became aware of the suppressed fear clinging to her words.

I slid off the server’s arm, squeezing his shoulder as I reluctantly took a step back. “I need to go,” I said.

He frowned, but nodded, his face turning expressionless as he watched me go. Weaving through the crowd, I couldn't help but glance back at him.

I didn’t know what I was looking for exactly, but I tried to put two and two together—Kit must have seen something, or rather someone, in the audience who had disturbed her. I kept my eyes open for a face that stood out; *any* face. All of a sudden, I collided with a broad, solid chest. Looking up, I found Elijah grinning down at me, though his features quickly derailed when he took note of my expression. “What’s wrong?” he asked immediately. 

“I don’t know,” I confessed.

Alarm twisted his features. “Was it the guy you were dancing with? Was he creeping on you?”

“What? No! No, something’s up with Kit. She must have seen something that scared her, I’m sure of it.”

“I don’t understand—”

“I just know, okay? Did you notice anything off with the people here?”

“I don’t think so…”


“Where’s Nettie?”

My question seemed to confuse him. “She, uh, went to get us drinks, I believe.”

“You believe? How long has she been gone for?”

“Huh. Pretty… pretty long now, actually. Must have been around eight minutes,” he replied, glancing at his watch. “She said she wouldn’t be long…”

Searing hot panic shot into my veins, and for a moment, I couldn’t breathe. Every fiber of my being, every last one of my senses screamed at me, telling me that something was terribly wrong. I grabbed Eli by the arm and dragged him along with me as I hurried to reach the stall where the beverages were being sold. There weren’t many people waiting in line and I pushed myself up to the front, hastily describing my best friend to the vendor. She said she was sure she hadn’t seen her. Nettie had never made it to the booth.

“We could be majorly overreacting right now,” Elijah argued, but the hand hovering over my shoulder was trembling and I could see the sweat glisten on his dark brown skin. “She could have just… met a coworker or something and got caught up talking.”

I didn’t know which one of us he was trying to convince. As we distanced ourselves from the stand, I took out my phone and dialed her number. It kept on ringing, and ringing, and ringing. My knees were feeling increasingly wobbly with every step I took. And then I felt something buzz beneath the sole of my sneaker. I stepped off, bending down to pick up the object with trembling fingers. It was Nettie’s cell phone. I wordlessly held it up for Eli to see. He froze, his jaw slowly slackening. I felt tears sting the corners of my eyes.

“Okay, okay, look; maybe she realized she lost her phone a-and she’s been looking for it this entire time,” Elijah sputtered, unable to hide the anxiety in his tone. “Hey, it’s gonna be okay, don’t cry!”

I don’t. I really don’t cry that often. But how was I supposed to keep it together when it was about *Nettie*? We kept combing through the crowd for several more minutes. The music had faded into silence, my racing mind drowning out everything besides the rapid pounding of my heart. Time seemed to pass much faster, the dancing bodies around me making me feel weirdly claustrophobic. At some point, Elijah started taking over, maneuvering the two of us along on our search. I was still keeping my eyes out as well, but all those colors around me seemed to have melted into one big, muddled vortex. It was as though I couldn’t rightly discern shapes anymore. Fear and concern had debilitated me. 

“There you are!” 

A familiar voice pulled me out of my trance and I looked up to find that Kit had joined us, apparently finished with her set. I lunged forward and grabbed her by the shoulders. “Where’s Nettie? You saw something, right?”

“She’s gone?” Kit sounded just as horrified as me.

“What’s going on?” Eli demanded, now towering over the blue-haired woman, his eyes wide and desperate. “What happened?”

“I-I spotted someone! I actually did. Someone from… someone I know, I guess; I thought it was just a trick of the light,” she whimpered. 

“Could that have anything to do with Nettie?” I rasped out. “Anything?”

Kit stared off into the distance for a moment before turning on the spot and racing off towards the edge of the venue. Elijah and I followed without hesitation as she shoved past the people she had performed for mere minutes prior. After an arduous couple minutes, we reached the outskirts of the beach, and Kit began clambering up the rocky expanse stretching before us. Neither Eli nor I questioned her. All we could do was trail behind her, trying to keep up with her show of astonishing agility. I had never been to this particular part of the coast before, and for good reason: here, everything was just stone and gravel, rugged cliffs and ridges. And yet somehow, my roommate moved forward with a visible sense of purpose, a clear destination in mind.

She finally came to halt when a massive hole opened in the rock formation in front of us. Elijah and I arrived at her side, both of us still shaking and very much out of breath. She turned to face us with a haunted expression. She opened her mouth to speak, only to be cut off when an ear-piercing scream echoed off the walls of the cave. My blood froze when I recognized Nettie’s voice.

“She’s in there,” I uttered. “Kit… Kit, what else is in there?”

“I can’t go,” she whispered, her cracked voice carrying over to us on the salty breeze. “They can’t see me.”

Another cry. I rushed forward, uncaring, Eli at my side. We jumped over the debris in our path, splashing through the shallow water that covered the sand in pools and puddles of varying sizes. When we entered the cave, it felt like the rock formation was swallowing us. Elijah called his cousin's name. His shouts rang out through the empty space with all the power of a small earthquake. It wasn't long until they were answered by another sharp yell. "Over here!"

I let out a sigh of relief. Wherever Nettie was, she was at the very least still conscious. We ran into the direction the cry had come from, taking a turn to the right to find ourselves in a darker, smaller nook of the cave. There, clinging onto the rough protrusions for support, was Nettie. Despite her tousled hair and bleeding lip, my gaze was instantly drawn to the figure cowering at her feet. I thought it was a person, until it turned its head to look up at us. Elijah let out a sharp gasp, staggering back instinctively. 

The thing had dark blue hair that framed a twisted mask of hatred. Its snarling lips revealed two rows of tiny, thin, pointy teeth, not unlike those of a piranha or perhaps a miniature shark. Its flaring nostrils sat flat and open right in the middle of its face and its eyes were far too big. There were no pupils or irises to be seen, just a milky shimmer that seemed to cover them like mucus. A mark was visible where Nettie's boot had connected with the creature's cheek. 

I wasted no more time. Lunging at the spindly beast, I wrapped my appendages around it to keep it in place. My human hands closing around its throat, I started squeezing, putting as much pressure on as I could. The thing managed to tear my fingers off its neck, and I screamed in pain when it plunged its razor-sharp teeth into one of my tentacles. Momentarily stunned, I briefly let my guard down and the creature shoved me aside. It then scurried off, withdrawing into the depths of the cave with an inhuman speed. Ignoring the bleeding bite mark as best I could, I rushed to my best friend's side. Nettie was shaken and out of breath, but besides a few scrapes and bruises, she appeared to be uninjured. She threw herself around me as soon as I came within reach. 

"Eva! Thank God you're here!" 

I awkwardly reciprocated the hug with all limbs available. "Don't exaggerate, you seemed to have it under control," I remarked and she snorted.

"I gave the bastard the roundhouse kick as soon as it let go of me," she muttered into my shoulder, not without a hint of pride. 

"What the fuck was that? Hell, Eva, what the fuck are *you*?" Elijah chimed in, lower lip quivering. "Nettie… Nettie, did you *see* her just now?"

"Yeah, Eli, I-I know…" My savior human detached herself from me, allowing me to keep an arm around her shoulder for support. We hobbled out of the cave, Elijah still muttering to himself in shock.

Kit had been waiting for us outside, wringing her hands as she absently kicked around a small pebble. Her eyes lit up when she spotted us. "You're okay!" she exclaimed. "Oh God, I'm so happy!"

"I'm fine," Nettie grumbled, releasing me and straightening up. "Just a few scratches, and my leg hurts, but it'll be alright."

"Listen, I'm… I'm sorry. This is all my fault. I… I shouldn't be here," she mumbled, scratching the shaved side of her head. "I shouldn't have come back here."

"What are you talking about?" I demanded. 

"I shouldn't…"

"Out with it, Sutton," I snapped. 

She flinched and Nettie rested a hand on my shoulder, prompting me to settle down. I crossed my arms, and, a little calmer, repeated, "Speak. I am not blaming you for whatever just happened—I don't believe any of us are—but you have to tell us what you know."

Kit hung her head, rubbing her bare arms. "I don't know if I should. It's probably just going to get you all into more trouble. Actually, I shouldn't even be here at all, I should go back where I belong, then we wouldn't *have* this problem…"

"Stop it," I hissed. "Tell me."

She laughed bitterly. "Well for starters, you should know that my hair's not actually dyed."
