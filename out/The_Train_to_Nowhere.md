Have you ever found yourself bored with your place in life? 

Unsure of where to go or how to get there?

That is where I found myself the day after I graduated High School. I had made good grades but by no means anything to brag about, unlike my twin brother Phil. He had always made the best grades and was at the end of summer he would be going off to college with a full ride. For me, the promise of higher education was a fleeting wish that would never be fulfilled.

“What do you know, Joe?” The woman sang out as I sat in the stagecoach of the abandoned train.

“Just as much as you, Sue,”  I said, leaning forward and pecking her on her freckled nose. She scrunched her nose before sliding in next to me.

“Still pouting in this dingy place like always, are you expecting the conductor to take you someplace far away?” She said, resting her head on my shoulder.

“It wouldn’t be the first time,” I said, wrapping an arm around her waist.

“I knew I’d find you two in here,” Phil said, pulling himself up and into the stagecoach. He tussled at his wavy hair before sitting opposite of us.

“Right as always little bro,” I stated with a slight grin on my face.

“Well you were in such a hurry to get out. Brawns before Brains has always been my motto. You’re only seven minutes older than me anyways,” Phil retorted, pushing his glasses up on his nose in his usual poindexter movement.

“Yeah, yeah, whatever. At least I have character.”

“Oh, you have plenty of character, Dad has had so many character building moments for you, I’m surprised there aren’t two of you,” Phil said before all three of us started laughing.
After we began to settle from the laughter Sue asked, “Is Will coming? I thought for sure he would have been tailing right behind you.”

“No, He uhh… didn’t…well you know. He’s worried about what people think.” Phil stammered, looking down at his fidgeting hands. Sue placed a hand on his with a look of reassurance.

“Ah, fuck him,” I said giving my brother a punch on the arm. “He acts like the whole town doesn’t already know about you two.”

Phil gave a slight smile before sitting back in his seat. The thud of more passengers boarding the stage couch brought our conversation to a temporary hold.

We watched as the stagecoach quickly filled with the kids from the town. We exchanged words with nearly everyone who walked by. As the last of the seats filled we heard the familiar sound of the train’s whistle.

“All aboard!” Shouted the Train Conductor, his body leaning out from the train, a hand holding onto the doorway between the stagecoach and the engine.

The three of us all pulled tickets from our pockets and scribbled a note on the back before holding them up. The Train Conductor walked by and collected our tickets before stepping on to the next set of passengers. As he returned and stepped towards the engine, we felt the hard pull of the train moving forward.

As we were about to continue our conversation and discuss our destination, a boy I recognized from the football team slipped in and tried to find an empty seat. Looking at our table, he moved right past us as Phil had scooted to block any other occupants. The boy hurried to find another seat.

“A risk-taker,” Sue said with a grave tone. Phil and I both nodded in agreement.

“Jesus, how long do you think it's been since someone tried to get on without a ticket,” I asked rhetorically.

“A few months at least,” Phil answered before shaking his head.

We kept our discussion low, trying not to think of what would end up happening to the stowaway but the entire atmosphere of the train had changed from light-hearted to sullen as many had noticed the late entrant. Despite the routine, I gave a slight jump at the sound of the whistle.

“First Stop Coming Up! The Pyramids of Egypt!” The Train Conductor yelled, a wide smile that didn’t reach his eyes as he stepped into the stagecoach. “The Pyramids of Egypt, the first stop of the day!”

A few of the newer riders started to shift in their seats as we approached the station. It was common for new riders to always hop off on the first stop. You had more time to explore and a far harder chance of missing the train on the return journey. We had spent countless rides getting off and exploring the tombs of pharaohs and lounging on the Nile before we finally decided to ride further.

The first group got off in Egypt, and the train rolled off to the next stop. The late edition to the train hadn’t taken advantage of the opportunity and exited while he still hadn’t been caught. We stayed on the train as we passed Athens, Berlin, Tokyo, San Juan, Sao Paulo, and London. We began to prepare ourselves for the next destination of Paris, the stowaway still aboard as well.

As the conductor walked down the aisle announcing the next stop of Paris, he stopped just as he passed the boy who had failed to give a ticket.

“Excuse me sir, I seem to have forgotten to collect your ticket,” He said, his head turning faster than his body. A cold chill in his voice that made Sue and several others still aboard shiver.

“Y-yea-yy-you you al-al-alre-already collected it,” the boy said, visibly sweating.

“Hmmm,” He said, placing a white leather gloved hand on the the table in front of the boy, his hands spread as wide as his smile. “That would be…quite impossible. I have quite the memory you see, and I distinctly remember NOT grabbing a ticket from YOU.”

The boys shrank in his seat, the Conductor narrowing the distance between them. The silence in the stagecoach became deafening as all eyes were focused on the two.

“No one rides for free on this train, and train hoppers are the filth I despise the most,” The Conductor said in a pleasant tone, His face still showing a joyful expression.

“I…I…I…”

“You are a common thief, no better than one at least for trying to steal a ride. I'm afraid you will have to speak with the Driver,” The Conductor said, his hand jumping to the boy's wrist and squeezing it tight. The sudden movement startled a yelp from the boy.

“Such a shame really, I asked for so little to ride to such ponderous places,” The Conductor stated as he dragged the boy towards the engine.

Despite the protests and screams, The Conductor moved without struggle. The wriggling body in his grasp was unable to slow the ascent to the front. As the door between the engine and stagecoach opened and closed, all of the resistant cries ceased.

“Sorry for the inconvenience everyone,” The Conductor sang as he returned moments later, his gloves wet with a crimson liquid. 

“Everyone aboard will be given a complimentary ticket for the disturbance. We hope this will accommodate for the unwelcome company and unpleasantries of having your peace disturbed,” He said as a hand darted within his coat and reemerged holding a stack of tickets.

He handed them out to the remaining passengers before announcing we would arrive shortly in Paris. Everyone aboard exited as soon as we arrived. 

We enjoyed the lights of 1899 Paris, doing what we could to forget the disturbing display. No one knew what happened if you had to see the Driver, only that no one ever came back.

After a few hours of sightseeing, we heard the familiar ring of the return whistle. We rushed back and boarded the train as the conductor made his final call.

We rode back in silence, everyone aware of the absence of the stowaway. 

As we arrived back to our small town, I glanced at the ticket I had been given. A dried bloody print stood out on the glossy silver paper.

*This Ticket authorizes the Holder to 1 FREE Round-Trip Ride on the Express Train to Nowhere.* 

A sense of foreboding filled me and when I looked over at Phil he returned my gloomy expression. 

We both agreed that we should avoid using our tickets. It might not be worth riding to the end of the line.

We had never heard of anyone who used an Express Ticket and made it back alive.
