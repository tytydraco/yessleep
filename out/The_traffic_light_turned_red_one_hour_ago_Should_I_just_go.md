What holds you together?

It's just a question. You don't have to get defensive. I'm asking - what keeps you in place? Prevents you from stepping out of line? Is it your sense of morality, or your fear? I'm asking this because maybe I'll get an answer to my problem, too.

I believe (if you ask me, but of course *no one* asked, I'm just sitting in a car in the middle of the night and talking to myself, I don't even know if this post will reach a lot of people, but it's worth a try)... as I said, I believe that we are all children in a way. We obey some rules that we grew up with, out of annoyance, but we're too lazy to question them. When no one is watching, some of us rebel. Some of us are too lazy or too numb to do that, either. So we wait it out. The impulse, I mean. And, in my case, the red light.

I hear the wind breathe softly outside my car. It could be the wind, or Tay's breathing from the back seat. We'd just gone to our annual Christmas gathering - we have these, uh, high school friends who host every year and I was the designated driver now. I dropped off Mary, and now the passenger seat is empty. Tay lives the furthest away, so I took a detour to get to her home. I should've been on the way back by now, had it not been for this stupid light.

I'm vaguely familiar with the roads outside my town. I don't drive very often. Especially at night. It's not that I'm scared, I'm just lazy and I like to be the one who drinks. I'm vaguely familiar with these woods - passed through them a million times, never paid enough attention. Most of these times they were just a blurry haze as my head spun from the backseat to the window to some friend's ear - usually Josh's.

That stung a bit, the memory. Josh didn't come tonight. I don't know why. I was looking forward to seeing him.

For the past hour, I've been studying my surroundings painfully sober. The woods are to my right, separated by a fence... some military base? Was this the area? I'm not very good at positioning myself in space, I had a vague idea of some base around my hometown, but I swear all woods look the same to me... The fog is everywhere, I can also see some windowless industrial buildings stretching to my left, and then there's the two roads that intersect. Mine, engulfed by the dark horizon. The other one, perpendicular, cutting across the woods and the buildings. When I first arrived, I almost ran the red, but stopped just in time. A truck practically flew past me and I cursed him out for driving so fast at - let me check - 2am then, since it is now 3.

"Phew, where the fuck are you going, buddy?" said Tay from the back.

"A vehicle so big shouldn't go 100mph. Could've fucking killed me." I muttered.

So I waited in the middle of fucking nowhere. The only car on the road. Five minutes passed, then ten. "I don't understand why it's so long. It's the middle of the night. No traffic."

"Just go," said Tay from the back. She was laying down on the backseat to "rest her eyes" and throwing in random slurred remarks. "Just... go. Nobody's gon' pass, not right now..."

Right then, a motorcycle proved us wrong. Then another. Then another.

I sighed. Tapping my fingers on the steering wheel, I let another 10 minutes pass. "This is fucking ridiculous. Twenty minutes went by."

Tay didn't respond. She'd fallen asleep.

"Come onnn... fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off-" I whispered, resting my head on the steering wheel. The light didn't respond and remained a piercing, unblinking crimson.

Every time I'd shift into 1st gear, a sense of wrongness would take over. I kept gripping the gear shift and looking around. No one else was there. Not one fucking soul.

*Just run it.*

I couldn't.

I really wished Tay hadn't fallen asleep. I feel so alone, and my surroundings aren't very helpful.

In the red glow, the asphalt looks like it's simmering. A pair of shoes tied by their laces from the telephone wires above sends a shiver down my spine. I don't know if it's true, but I heard those mark spots where people sell drugs. Or worse. The industrial buildings look abandoned. I keep shifting in my seat.

The red glow seems to be staining the inside of the car. My own skin looks like it's bruising or rotting. The car looks drenched in blood. I wish Tay would just fucking move. I don't want to wake her up. The world outside looks normal, boring, desolate.

I've spent the past minutes praying for something to happen, and then it did. I can see a silhouette in my rearview mirror. Oh my God, please don't get closer.

I stare at it, my hands gripping the wheel, knuckles white and fingers drenched in sweat. It just stands and watches, thank God. I couldn't bear to have it move towards me. That's it, if ten more minutes pass and the light isn't turning, I'll fucking go.

Go... where?

I stare at the road unfolding before me. The dark asphalt seems to curve like a tongue, leading me deeper into the throat of whatever's waiting for me to move.

I'll turn the car around. *But do you want to turn your back to this thing?*

Fuck it, I'll take a right. How bad can it be?

A bang on my window startles me. I turn my head and stare at a middle aged man, motioning at me to roll down my window. He was the silhouette I'd seen in my rearview mirror. Nothing supernatural. No giants about to swallow me. Just my car in the middle of Fucksville, a wrongly programmed light and a random dude.

I still don't like my options. I'm still a woman in the middle of Fucksville, at 3am, looking at a random dude. I nod my head at him. He frowns a little. I barely crack the window, just to hear him.

"Hey. You okay?"

"Yeah." I respond stoically. He's wearing a jacket and a baseball hat. Unshaved. A tamed look in his eyes.

"You haven't moved in a while. I work at that security post there -" he motions towards the buildings.

"The light is red." I respond childishly.

I see a glimmer of a smile in his eyes. Amusement, I suppose. "It's 3am. Nobody's here."

"A truck passed by really fast. And then some motorcycles."

His eyes keep darting to the interior of my car and my backseat. Fear has grown another heart in my chest, one that pounds chaotically.

"This light is fucked. Whoever programmed it didn't do their job. I'm sure you're sick of waiting. Just go. I won't tell on you. It goes like that every night." He smiles.

I know he's right. It's perfectly rational, what he's saying. I'll just go. I grab the gear shift. Suddenly, a whisper comes from *within* me. A pleading, desperate *don't*. Since when did I become so... obedient?

It's the same impulse that just won't let you jump off a building.

I smile faintly. "It's fine, I'll just wait."

"The whole night?"

"Yeah."

I feel embarrassed. I'm not afraid of this random guy anymore. He's just some night shift worker who tried to tell me to just go, like any sane person would. He just shrugs. Blood rushes into my cheeks. I'm so ridiculous.

Then, he tries my car door.

It all happens so fast, I can barely register it. His hand, pulling onto the handle. A small rattle. His eyes devoid of any smile. His surprise, and glint of embarrassment. His walk away, to the shadows. To the woods.

My throat tightens. I feel deceived, I feel awful, I feel ashamed, and the fear and shock won't let me breathe. I just sit there frozen in time. The light doesn't matter anymore. This guy just tried my car door. He might return: I just told him I won't be going anywhere until dawn.

That's it, I'm turning the car around. I reverse a little, then I make a large U-turn. I'm facing the other way now. Suddenly, the crimson interior of my car changes to a sickly green.

*You've got to be kidding me.*

I look in my rearview mirror. Yeah, the light just turned green.

I struggle a little, but I manage to make yet *another* U-turn. I'm about to floor it, fueled by anger and fear, when a car flies past me in a dizzying speed.

"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? YOUR LIGHT IS RED, YOU DUMB BITCH!" I explode, honking. I respect traffic rules, why didn't they? They could've fucking killed me. I would have died because of their mistake.

Oddly, Tay wasn't awoken by my screams and honking. I turn to look at her. She'd slept like a log this whole time.

"Tay."

No answer. Something is wrong. She's a very light sleeper.

I reach behind me and pull on her leg. "*Tay!*"

I unbuckle my seatbelt and crawl into the backseat. She's not even sleeping. Her eyes are wide, fixated on me. Actually, behind me.

She motions at me to shut up. Her whispers are barely perceptible. "You woke me up with your honking. There's someone in the woods. I think you fucking drew their attention. Don't turn around."

"The car is locked. There's nothing they can do."

"I don't think that's true."

"What to we do?"

"Are you insane? *Drive."*

*"I can't!*" I cry out. "The light is red again!"

She shoots me an exasperated look, as if she's saying "Are you nuts? You wanna obey traffic rules now?", and then nods towards the front seat. I shake my head. "I'm gonna turn the car around. I know you might not understand, but I'm terribly afraid to run the red light."

"Do whatever you want, just go."

I crawl into the driver's seat and, as I prepare to make the turn, I notice something in my rearview mirror.

A glimmer on the asphalt.

"What the fuck?"

"What? What is it?"

Tay turns to look.

Someone laid down spike strips behind us.
