My grandfather was a physicist who devoted his whole life to researching and creating a possible time machine. In the eye of the public he was a revered scientist but in his private life he had an obsession with time. He spent his whole life working in secrecy in an underground bunking, constructing and attempting to create a machine which would allow him to warp through time. Although this concept was deemed impossible in the past he somehow made it work. I found out about it on his deathbed. He told me that he had kept it as a secret from my father as he was ignorant and uninterested in science. I on the other hand appreciated my grandpa and we shared the same interests. When I found out about the machine I  thought he was joking, but as it turns out he was not, he gave me a pamphlet with instructions . I was shocked I didn't know what to say. his last words were

**"Don't go to the year -----"**

Death couldn't let him finish. He passed away in the year 2245. Upon his death I was filled with dread, but also a feeling of curiosity about the time machine. Throughout the last 150 years humanity had made many advancements  such as colonies on  different planets, a realm where consciousness is transferrable, cure for all mental illness , but this was different. I went straight to the bunker which was under our lake house, unexpectedly it was rather clean. The time machine was an octgaon like tunnel which was massive. The pamphlet said to set a timer for 60 seconds and to imagine a time period. You were supposed to be focused on one time period and not let your mind drift as it would not work. I listened as the timer went off, each tick feeling me with waves of fear, as the timer stopped my vision went white. 

I thought I had died but I was soon in medieval Europe. I  was fascinated my mind was racing I was at loss of words. I could see everything the people the buildings everything it didn't feel real. I soon came to realize  that I was like a spectator, I couldn't interact with anything and neither could the environment with me. Any attempt to communicate would give me a fuzzy feeling preventing me to move. The people didn't see me but I saw them. I was in awe and used the time machine to visit many historical places such as Germany in WW2, Renaissance Italy, I saw the Vikings, I saw the ancient Egyptians I saw everything. I felt like I was forgetting something, and then it hit me, the  Crucifixion of Christ. That was the one thing I wanted to see, because as someone who was interested in religion I wanted to find the truth. I set the timer and as it ticked I felt uneasy, I was transported to Jerusalem, and had to find Jesus myself. It wasn't a problem as the Crucifixion was public and easy to see from far away. I saw him it was him, he was real, at first I was overwhelmed and, but then it hit me. 

"This doesn't change anything, he's just some dude on a cross"

I thought to myself, I wanted to approach him, I knew I couldn't do anything but I wanted too see him up close. He was very frail and looked somewhat as the depictions of him I was familiar with, long hair beard you know him. I was standing 1 meter beside him looking at him from the side , when suddenly his head turned towards me. My eyes felt like they were going to come out of their sockets. He stared into me and said in perfect English.

"You're not supposed to be here"

As soon as I registered those words I was transported back. My brain felt like it was going to fall out of my head. I sat on a chair nearby and started thinking about what had just happened. I couldn't calm myself. Its been years since that happened, I burned that house now and escaped to live in the forest, if you're reading this you're very unfortunate because I am dead. I cant stop thinking about him, I can't he's everywhere, he's always there.
