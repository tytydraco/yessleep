I have no idea where to start. I'm sorry in advance if I ramble a few times while writing this, I'm no writer, so I may even repeat myself a few times. I'll do my best to be as descriptive as possible when writing this. Let me pre-set this Dream.

I chose to finally share this Dream for a few reasons. Lately, I have been listening to CreepCast and seen that they mainly read stories from here. Now, please don't think I'm writing this because I want them to pull my Dream...no. Would it be cool? Duh? But the truth is I just want, answers. This seemed to be the best place to write this Dream. Maybe someone out there may have had a similar dream. Or someone who can interpret dreams and explain what the hell I dreamt about. And lastly, because I think I'm about ready to talk about it. I've held on to it for so long and had no one to talk to about it.

Now we can set the events of the Dream.

The year was 2011, slightly fresh out of High School. During this time, no major events happened. I lived with my parents, my brother moved out to live with his girlfriend and I was in my first serious relationship. I wasn't really into much except video games and YouTube. During that time I was heavily into conspiracy stuff, ya'know the Aliens, Pyramids, Lizard People, that sort of stuff. 

Gonna ramble already, so I'm currently in my thirties...I hate that I remember this dream, not a single piece of this Dream is forgotten. I can't recall things that happened last year or even a dream I had two nights ago, but this one...it stuck, practically tattoed on my brain.

Anyways, it was an early afternoon during the Summertime. I was playing my Xbox in my parent's basement, probably playing Halo or something, and before I knew it, I was getting tired. As I stated before, I'm no writer, so I really hope how I word this out so you can envision the layout of my basement, it's nothing spectacular...a basement, but it's crucial when we get to the Dream.

This is a typical North Philly Twin Home. So the basement is just one long rectangle going down. One end of the basement was the laundry room and the other end had a door that led to our backyard. With that said Door, there was a doorknob on the right side of the door that you would pull and it would open towards you, about a foot away from you are about 4 steps leading up until you a faced with another door with a door knob on the left that you would also pull towards you to open. Once that door is opened you are presented with a final door ( a lot of doors...I know) and with this last one the door knob was to your left which you would push to open the door. 

I know, I know....why the hell are we talking about the doors, it's not a game changer in this Dream but, well I'll get to it. 

Once outside, it's pretty open, and to the right is a metal-linked fence that divides our yard from the neighbors. The fence was maybe six and a half feet high.

So again a normal rectangle  **â–¯** Like that. 

There are no other doors that lead anywhere else in that basement. Just that one that leads outside and of course the door up the steps that brings you to the first floor of the house. 

Those are the REAL details of my Parent's Home. 

So back to where I was tired. I decided to take a nap on the couch I was sitting on. I laid down on my back, closed my eyes, and just like that I was asleep...a deep one.

Christ, the way I feel heavy right now preparing to write about this damn Dream.

I woke up...sat at the edge of my couch and stood up. Things felt foggy, vision blurry, one of those "how long have I been sleeping for" kind of moments. I turned around, looked down, and in complete shock I saw myself.

I was still sleeping, I saw my body, nothing different, no clothes changed, no different colors. It was me. Not sure what the hell was happening, I began to pace a few steps back and forth. Trying to rationalize what was going on. I'm in full control, I touched my chest and I felt it, I touched my own sleeping body's chest and I could also FEEL that. I was in control. Nothing was different around me. Everything was exactly as it was. 

I decided to walk toward the door that led outside. 

The first door opened as normal as it did. Walked up to the second door, and opened it, but I could only open it maybe halfway. Once it reached halfway, the third door would slam shut. Confused, I decided to close the second door. Maybe something was wrong with the hinges. But I noticed as I closed the second door, the third door would open. I kept repeating this over and over again trying to figure out how I could make it outside. Eventually, I just decided to squeeze through the second door while it was halfway open. I remember physically feeling my chest and back scrape between the door and the wall. And when I managed to squeeze through the door closed behind me leaving the third door wide open. 

I was outside. And it was dark. 

The only lights I had were those motion-activated lights I had in the backyard and the neighbors. I looked around my backyard actually asking the question, "How long was I asleep for" until remembered that my physical body was still sleeping. So...am I even awake? Everything was normal outside other than it being dark, until I looked through the chained link fence into my neighbor's backyard. Something was there in the middle of where their light was pointing. 

It was so strange, even though the light was shining on it, it was still black as if it wasn't illuminated at all.

At first, it was small. I honestly thought it was a puppy. I took a slow step forward and it began to shake and shift, at the start it looked like it was boiling, and then things started to snap its limbs as it just kept getting bigger and bigger. I had no idea what to do...I was scared. 

Once it took an inch forward I darted towards the door. The worry of how the door worked didn't bother me, I blasted through that goddamn door. Closed and locked the second and first doors. I felt my heart racing, and my body sweating.  I began to pace again. Having not a single clue what was going on. I leaned over to my body, grabbed myself by my shoulders, and began to shake vigorously. 

"Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!"

But nothing. I felt trapped. I began to pace...again until I realized another change. I noticed that the wall to my right had this new corner part to it. I walked over past it and saw a door there, facing the same direction as the door that led outside. I was hesitant at first, but curiosity got the best of me. I opened the door and again, it led outside, sorta.

I decided to look to my left first. There was a wooden railing that trailed straight maybe about 4 feet high and it stretched for what looked like miles, I couldn't see an end to it. Above the wooden rail were green bushes that stood higher than the wood railing, maybe two feet above the railing. There was a space between the ceiling of this walkway and the bushes. It was the sky. It was bright blue, it was daytime, I put my head down.

"What...is...going...on?"

I slowly lifted my head up and looked to my right, and a huge chill came crashing down into my spine. I wanted to throw up. There, 3 bodies were hanging on the wall. They looked like they were hanging by a hook that was caught by the nape of their neck. Their heads stared down with lifeless eyes. I couldn't make it out but I believe there were two men and one woman. 

I DID NOT WANT TO INSPECT THEM. Even if a part of me wanted to I was frozen. But yet I couldn't look away, I was fixed on their heads. Until all three simultaneously turned their heads slowly and met my eyes. As soon as they locked into my eyes, that connection was immediately severed. I turned around and shut the door behind me.

Now I'm frantic, now I'm terrified.

I go back to my body and shake it again and again.

"Please come on, wake up, wake up, wake up!!!"

Nothing.

I felt so helpless. 

"I'm dead...this is purgatory" 

I remembered my mom was home and she sure as hell wasn't taking a nap. I thought maybe, just maaaybe I could somehow interact with her. I was ready to do anything to get out of whatever Hell Dream I was in. Given everything I had seen so far, I decided to go upstairs, preparing myself to see what else changed. 

I walk into my dining room and things are normal, no changes. 

I turned to the doorway of the living room and saw my Mom, sitting on the couch with a phone to her ear and again everything was normal...in that moment. 

I ran over to my mom, telling her everything that was going on. 

But nothing, only her laughing.

"Mom! Yo, MOM! Mom? Why aren't you listening to me!?"

At first, her gaze was fixed forward as if she was looking through me.

Then her eyes snapped to mine. 

She saw me...she was laughing louder...she was laughing at me.

I took a few steps back, again cursed by paralyzing fear. The laughing went on and on and on. 

I was finally able to move a little and began to walk past her my eyes still looking at her, but she stayed facing the same direction...laughing. I began to pace again.

"Come on Leo, think, THINK! I'm asleep, I know I am, this is just some messed up dream man. Come on, I know I can get out of this. Something!"

And I remembered one thing. Something I believe we have all experienced before. 

The Falling Dream.

When I was a kid this is maybe the only other dream other than the Waterfall one...we all know that one, that I can remember. I grew up in this home, so I always had a dream where I would fall from the top of the steps and as soon as I hit the floor, BOOM, I woke up. It was never a pleasant wake-up, but I woke up nonetheless. So that's what I did.

I ran upstairs to the second floor, looked down the stairs, breathed in...and froze.

I felt everything. My chest, my sleeping body's chest, the scraping of my chest and back when I squeezed through the basement door to go outside. I could feel it.

What if I hurt myself?

After asking myself that, I quickly realized, would I rather risk hurting myself or stay in this state for God knows how long. So I jumped, straight down, not hitting a single step. My body crashed to the floor. My eyes were shut. All I saw was darkness.

I opened my eyes confident that I woke up...but there I was, laying on my belly flat on the floor, the laughter louder. I slowly began to get up, I felt out of breath, and tears started to fill my eyes.

"No, no, no, nononono, that was supposed to work, it's the only thing that could work!"

I ran upstairs, fell again, and again...and again, as the laughter kept growing.

Every fall didn't hurt but I remember feeling so uncomfortable when I landed. Hell, I remember one fall, my legs damn near went over my head, it's called the scorpion or something. 

I did one more fall.

Nothing.

I pushed myself up, sitting on the floor, exhausted. I'm crying my eyes out, hopeless.

I stood up and began yelling and pleading.

"LEO PLEASE! WAKE UP, WAKE UP, I'M BEGGING YOU WAKE UP!!!!!!!"

I began jumping and stomping, damn near shaking the entire house over and over again,

Then I felt something. I felt my shoulder move, not the shoulder I could reach over to touch, but the shoulder of my body that was sleeping in the basement.

I continued. Screaming at the top of my lungs.

I swallowed just now while writing this because I remembered that feeling of my throat being torn to shreds from screaming, even my head hurts right now, the pressure is weird. Did I say I hate thinking about this Dream, if I didn't, well I'm telling you now.

As I continued to scream and cry, my shoulder moved little by little til I was able to feel a full sway. And once that full sway happened, everything rushed into me all at once. I rose from the couch, drenched in sweat, tears in my eyes, out of breath. I was back in MY body. I double-checked, triple-checked, I checked to make sure way too many times. I ran over to the wall that had an extra door. There was no Door. I ran to the door that led outside. The multitude of doors opened like they regularly did. I went outside...the sun was setting, it was probably around 6 or 7 PM. Looked at my neighbor's yard, and nothing, but still ran back inside not wanting to take any chances of something happening.

  
I went upstairs, but no one was home. It was just me. I called my Girlfriend at the time to see if things were normal. She answered. This is an additional part I don't like, but I rather be honest. I was so mad at her. She normally calls me like every hour or two every day and of all days she didn't call me once after I took that nap.

It wasn't her fault...she had nothing to do with it. But I was angry.

"You didn't call me one time?!" I said.

"What do you mean? I was busy, what happened?!" She responded.

"I had the worst Dream of my life that could've ended shortly if you had called!"

"Well, how was I supp..." Her voice was cut short. I ended the phone call abruptly. I know, I know, dick move, again I'm not proud I did that and what happened had nothing to do with her. I'm sorry. 

So for the next what...13 years this dream has stuck with me. Never shared and is very real...I really wish it wasn't.

This isn't some, "haha spooked ya!" this is just something that's been with me. I never knew how to go about sharing it. Do I tell it to the boys over a couple of drinks? Do tell my wife about this? I sure as shit am not gonna tell my kids about it. 

But maybe this could be its new home. 

Do I feel lighter...not really. My head is pounding like I said before. Every time I think about this Dream it feels made up...but believe me when I tell you, I wish it was. You might have wondered why I never called it a Nightmare. I can't tell you why other than it just didn't have that Nightmare feel to me, nightmare feels short, or it's some cheesy chase. I don't know what the hell to call what I experienced.

I know some people are going to say I went through some intense Sleep Paralysis, and maybe it was. As haunting as this Dream was, you'd think it couldn't get any worse....it did.

A few days after this all happened, I left work slightly early. Walked into my parent's house. And laid on the living room couch on my side. And unknowingly drifted asleep. 

I woke up, well my consciousness woke up, I could sorta see from the little space between my slightly closed eyelids. I was scared. I couldn't move. I heard something breathing and it got closer and closer until I felt...whatever it was brush my ear and in a quiet, raspy whisper it said,

"You will never find me"

I jolted up, looked around and there was nothing.

I've never taken a nap since.
