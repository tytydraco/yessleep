“I thought your parents were neat freaks.  They never let anyone come over.”

“They are… but I finally convinced them to let me have a friend sleepover.  I’m so excited.  They said you can head over after dinner.  They promised to leave us alone.”

Hearing my best friend Gavin gush at the thought of having me over reminded me of just how good our friendship was.  Even though we were in eighth grade and probably should have been a little more mature, we were kids at heart, kids who just wanted to play video games and stuff our faces with junk food. 

If even a crumb fell on their living room carpet, I knew Gavin’s parents would soil themselves.  So, I was a little nervous when I stepped foot into their house at half past eight on a Friday evening.  I brought all the fixings over for a fun-filled night and dumped them in the living room, cautiously sniffing around to see if I could hear Gavin’s parents. 

“They are upstairs.  Don’t worry Myles.  They won’t be coming down.  We have the whole place to ourselves.”

Gavin’s face was as red as the spicy cheese puffs.  “You okay, man?”

“Yeah, I’ve just been running around all night trying to get the house ready.”

The house was eerily quiet; I heard no movement upstairs.  As we settled into a multiplayer gaming session, every few minutes I would glance at Gavin, as his bulging eyes stared intently at the screen. 

“Hey, you sure your parents are cool with this?” I waved my hands around to get his attention, but Gavin’s eyes stayed locked in on the screen.

“Hey man, you okay?” I nudged his shoulder.

Tears formed, and I knew something was off.

“You can come over every day if you’d like.  We can play games all night.”

“Are your parents even home?  Is it okay if I go upstairs?”

“No!” Gavin shouted.

I jumped up and raced upstairs with Gavin chasing after me.  I pushed open the master bedroom door and entered the crime scene.  Gavin’s dad was sprawled out on the ground, a large kitchen knife lodged into his chest.  His mother, face down on a pillow, a pool of blood around her neck.

Gavin blocked the doorway.

“Don’t come any closer!” I yelled.  “I can’t believe you killed your parents.  You are crazy.”

My throat sealed shut, body rattled uncontrollably.  Nausea kicked in.  I could not believe my eyes.

“They never even loved me, never paid any attention to me.”  Gavin eyed me cautiously to see how I would respond.  We were both about the same size, so I didn’t want to risk getting into a deadly shoving match with him.  I mean, for all I knew, he could have had a knife on him.

I turned to the window and went for it.  Slammed through the glass and onto roof, tumbling and falling, eventually landing on junipers. 

When I woke up, I was resting comfortably in a hospital bed, my family by my side.  I found out Gavin confessed to the murder of his parents and was apprehended by a neighbor and the police shortly after I passed out.  It’s been years since the incident, but as you can imagine, I’ve had trust issues.
