 My names Javier Rodriguez. I was born 1995 on the 4th of July in Austin Texas where most of my family was born and raised for generations. My Uncle Tony said I was a big surprise to the family since my mom was told it was very unlikely for her to have another child after my brother Pedro. She had a very hard time giving birth to Pedro. In fact I was told she was in labor for almost 5 days before they resorted to a C section. 
I don’t remember much or anything at all about our home in Austin, Mom moved me and my brother to SoCal when I was 6. We moved close to that theme park with the mouse, I remember Pedro was really upset with the move but was really happy about being so close to the happiest place on earth. The one thing I remember very vividly is the treehouse that was in the backyard. The treehouse was so old that it almost appeared to be rooted into the tree. Treehouse was painted pink but looked bleached from the California Sun.       
She was a single mom, and she was the best mom you could ask for. She was always so happy, always making dumb jokes to make me and Pedro laugh.Our mom Nora was everything to me and Pedro, until the summer of 2004. Everything changed after that damned day and that god damn Treehouse. That treehouse took everything from me, I never forgot that fucking treehouse no matter how much Don Julio I drank.
I’m 29 now living back in Austin Texas living with my Uncle Tony, writing true crime novels for a living while picking up shifts at the local bar when I can. Which is where I would be right now if it wasn’t for the phone call I received this morning. Spam likely it read with a 714 area code I answered thinking it may be my publisher Mark with a new phone number, he gets a new one every few years it feels like. I answered. 
  
Mark this you?

Hello?
…

I waited for a response for a couple more second, as I was going to hang up I heard rattling or plastic on plastic tapping. Idk but It kept me on the line. Than a faint whisper came through that made my body go ice cold like I was instantaneously dumped in a ice bath. 

Javi… come back to the Treehouse..sa-

The line went dead before I could make out the last word. I was frozen in shock, disbelief and frankly nauseous. Had to be a sick joke but I don’t talk to anyone from my time in California, Hell I was 6 when I moved there and 9 when I left. Who would have my number and how? But one thought kept coming to mind. Was it him? No way couldn’t be, it’s been 20 years.       This is the reason I need to write down everything I remember about those 4 years I spent in that damned house before I go on any further.
