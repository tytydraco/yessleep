I'm not sure if I'm asking for help or if I just need someone to hear my story (maybe someone can relate), but I haven't had the best relationship with sleep since I can remember and while it's gotten better as I'm an adult, I still get randomly affected by whatever paranoia or paranormal thing plauges me. 

It's starts as a child between the ages of 5 and 10, I use to sleep walk and talk. It got so bad that my mom had to lock doors and baracade the stairs because she was afraid I'd hurt myself. I lived on the second floor and it was a common occurrence for me to walk down stairs anxiety ridden by something but my mom couldn't always understand by what. For example, once it was because I forgot to finish my homework. At first my mom thought I was awake during these occurrences, but I guess she realized that I never made any sense, I barely reacted to anything my mom did and I was very zombie like with glazed eyes. My sister who slept in the same room as I was always freaked out when I shot up in bed and just started rambling. She said sometimes she could actaully have conversations with me even though it was all nonsense. While scary to my family sometimes, when they shared their stories with me I never thought much of it. Also I should note, while possibly connected in a trauma way or legitimately paranormal way, my mom and sister always had stories about the house we lived in, our family history, and experiences we've witnessed together. I say witnessed together, but I have barely any memory of my childhood. I have strange bits and peices that can be very specific, but sometimes when I hear stories it surprises me that I didn't remember it. Despite all these stories being a bit creepy for a child to take in, I literally was never scared as a child before I turned 10. I mean NEVER scared. I was a very worry free and brave child who loved the dark, storms, and Horror movies. Yes, I would sneak up to watch IT or Chucky in the middle of the night when my sister was out with her friends. Nothing bothered me personally until my mom got a new boyfriend and we moved states.

I moved to GA when I was about 9 or 10 and I moved around a lot. The spooky stuff (that I can remember) and the anxiety began immediately. I suffered from horrible sleep paralysis and I began to have have major anxiety of something being in the room with me at night. I don't know what triggered these paranoid filled nights, but even to this day I still suffer from them and I don't know why despite being nowhere near as scared as I was from ages 10-17. The sleep paralysis can be anything from hearing/seeing someone in the corner of the room, my mom taking to me in a very upsetting way, or......alien abduction. I know...wow. The alien abduction scenes have happened twice that I can remember, but each time there were bright pulsating  lights coming from outside my window, a discomforting body feeling of vibrations and numbness, and I couldn't see anything in the room but I definitely felt something there. The last time this happened was when I was about 15, but I still get sleep paralysis to this day...just far and few between. It actually just happened to me last night, but nothing notable happened. I just panicked, calmed down, and then tried multiple times to jolt myself awake. I know this happened because I was extremely sleep deprived...from anxiety that started the night before.

Other than sleep paralysis, which doesn't always have to happen when am having bad nights, I have extremely anxiety ridden nights where I refuse to fall asleep no matter how painful it can be come sunrise and I usually ended up sitting on my bed crying with the lights on for hours. Last night I wasn't as panicked as I would've been when I was younger, but it was unsettling and I tried to rationalized my fears, but I just could not let my self close my eyes for too long and if I did fall asleep for maybe 30 minutes or an hour I woke up in a jolt or...like last night in paralysis. My fears are usually someone watching me. As a teen I think I remember it feeling fairly sinister which is why I cried and had panic attacks...but like last night and being more familiar with my anxiety..it didn't feel sinister or dark. Despite that making me feel a little better, I was still terrified of falling asleep. Things I have noted are, one.. these bad nights are very common in the place they happen after they happen for the first time (when I went back within last year to visit my parents...the room I slept in where this happened to me when I was younger...happened to me again....so I told my mom I didn't want to sleep nor be near that room so she put me in the guest room and I had no problems...mostly...but atleast I let myself get some sleep.), two I hear things moving or being tapped, and three it's a very common occurrence to happen when I'm near my family....especially my mom, but It never happens in places I think could actually be haunted, like my partner's moms house which is VERY old or my own bedroom in the various apartment and houses I lived on my own. 

I do have a strong attraction towards the occult, witchcraft, and anything dark...but I truly don't believe that I'm simply just afraid of a "ghost" that isn't there. I rarely, if ever, get scared in my own bed and I go ghost hunting to actaully haunted places and I'm a fairly calm and curious person that doesn't freak out like some of the people I go with. Actaully...I don't entirely believe in the paranormal, but only because I'm a very see it to believe it person. I want to believe and I have had some weird interactions in the past year that make me question a lot...but I typically debunk a lot of evidence. Last thing I want to throw out there because it is very unique and probably contributes to me not remembering many memories is that I have aphantasia. Meaning I don't have an "imagination" or "minds eye" so if I did ever see an apparition or something in front of me....it would be very hard to explain away because I don't think I can hallucinate anything visual. I'd love to know if you have any thoughts, unfortunaly this is all very surace level details...I could write a novel on everything I've been through and how unexplainable its been. Thank you for reading.
