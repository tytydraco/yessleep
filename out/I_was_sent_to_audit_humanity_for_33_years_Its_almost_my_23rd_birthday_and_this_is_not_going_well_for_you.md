I want to start off with some honesty. I was sent by, well, I suppose you all call Him "God." I'm using your terminology because, well, as foreign as it seems to me, it is the only way I can express this concept to you. I would call Him the Creator. So yes, theists are right.

NO. I will NOT tell you which one. For starters, this is reddit, and I know damn well this is a subreddit known for fictitious stories. Rule 8 is a fiction and everyone knows it. So you wouldn't believe me anyway. As for why I'm using Reddit? Hah. That's the best part. This is a loophole. I can't reveal myself if I know someone will believe me, so this is a loophole. I know no one will believe me. And I'm banking on being wrong.

I will answer SOME questions if I can, but I am banned from answering any ultimate question, Suffice to say, merely going to church or praying or that jazz will not suffice.

But that isn't why I'm here. 

  
I was born approximately 23 years ago. Not exactly, but my birthday is coming up. Happy birthday to me, I suppose. But this is the bad news. I was born as a result of a test, or a wager. There isn't an exact word for what it is. But suffice to say, when I was born, there was doubt on if humanity was worth another chance to fix things before the fire comes down from Heaven. I will say, yes, this world will perish by fire. And it may happen in 10 years, or even less, if you do not listen to what I am saying very clearly. I was sent to assess mankind. And you have so far not done well.

I was born, semi-voluntarily. I lost all connection with the Creator that I had previously enjoyed, that some of you hope to feel when you die. Oh, and yes, there is a Heaven. And a Hell. But that is all I can really say. Let me tell you that is the most painful thing I can describe. It still causes me almost unbearable pain. But it isn't everything. 

I deliberately was given a random life in a developed country, in a relatively poor area. It was a compromise, because one side wanted the test to be in the developed world, as that is what everywhere should eventually become. Others wanted it to be in the undeveloped hellworld of the third world, because that would be telling of the worst state of man. In the end, I was given my family. 

Let me start off with what I personally have seen and endured. I have seen the absolute worst in humanity. I have seen people become sadistic monsters, rapists, and even murderers. I have seen people use drugs to become despots over small towns. I have even suffered myself, but please, no tears for me. I have weighed those around me in the balance, and I have found all of them wanting. Trust me, the few people that may have saved you in this part of the test were killed, either literally or figuratively, by the sheer evil and cruelty of others. You had a chance to change my mind for 22 years on this point. And you have fucked it up ROYALLY.

But my personal life was only part of it. In fact, I was more inclined to ask if people can change, if the world as a whole had a bright future. And it doesn't. I have seen nations rise and fall, governments topple. I was alive from the fall of the Twin Towers, to the genocides worldwide. I have seen the systematic butchering of innocents everywhere, and do not think even the West is doing well. There is a film, "Nefarious," that I feel illustrates my point perfectly here.

\[Little side note, I do have a personal life. I work, I play games, and I watch movies. Externally, I'm someone that no one would suspect. And I like it that way. I want to see this world as an average person would, and not from above. I want to give it a fair assessment.\]

In other words, you have collectively failed so badly that I doubt you can change my assessment. But I am committed to giving you a chance. Do better.

Respect the values handed down. Do not try to topple systems and traditions merely because you want to do so. Let hate leave and compassion reign. Remember every person alive has value and meaning. Help the poor and needy, tend to the sick, and console the grieving. When you see injustice, fight it. Show me that humanity can be good. Show me that you deserve to survive the next 11 years. If I am satisfied that you have improved, then perhaps things will go well. If, however, I am ever convinced you are irredeemable, I can and will terminate this assessment early.

"For the sake of ten, I will spare it." Give me those 10. Because I want to believe people can change, and that this world is worth saving.
