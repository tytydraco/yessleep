I step into the bare room. it wasn’t the floorboards and faded walls but the small table that troubled me the most. There was an eeriness to it that chilled me like deja vu.  

This time I walked straight to it and checked underneath. feeling the edges. The key was still there. stuck to the underside with masking tape. On top the book was gone.  

Cool sunlight landing on the floorboards seemed to have not changed at all. I’d already tried to count the boards to measure the passing of time but one of us is lying.  

Each wall has to be at least 3 or 4 meters away wherever I am. Stepping closer to one of them makes the others get nearer. And the window is always on my left.  

I've stopped crying now. Some tears run down my face now and then but the rest of my body just moves. I've been confused, panicked, amused, frustrated, angry, bored, fascinated, lonely and augural by the repetition.  

The window is too high to see out of. I have to assume there is an outside. But its so cruel to make me want to get outside. There must be someone else to have stuck the key under the table. To make the key and door and the window and the table and the room that has them all. I can’t think of any other way so I take the key to the door. Why would they leave a key or even have a door? Is the window there to inspire me or taunt me? Is it a clue? Is there any meaning here at all?

Of cause I take the key to the door again opening it inward.

I step into the bare room. It wasn’t the floorboards or faded walls or the small table that troubled me the most, it was the window letting in cold sunlight. There was an eeriness to it that chilled me like deja vu.  

This time I walked straight to it and jumped up to try and see out. I still couldn’t quite make it past the windowsill. The cool sunlight landing on the floorboards seemed to have not changed at all. I had already tried counting the boards to measure the time passing of time but one of us is lying.  

Each wall has to be at least 3 or 4 meters away wherever I am. Stepping closer to one of them make the others get nearer. And the window is always on my left. 

I’m crying now. Sobbing lightly without tears running down my face. The rest of my body just moves. I’ve been lonely, bored, amused, confused, panicked, frustrated, angry and augural by the repetition.  

The table is too weak to stand on. I have to assume somebody made it and made the key and stuck it under it. It’s cruel to make me think these things are here on purpose. To make a window and a table and a key and a door. Is the key there to inspire me or taunt me? Is it a clue? Is there any meaning here at all? Of cause I take the key to the door again opening it inward.  

I step into the bare room. It wasn’t the floorboards or the faded walls that troubled me but the worn wooden door that was always opposite me. There was an eeriness to it that chilled me like deja vu.  

This time I walked straight up to it and checked if it needed the key. Which it did. The cool sunlight    I have taken as proof there is an outside but one of us is lying.  

Each wall has to be at least 3 or 4 meters away wherever I am. Stepping closer to one makes the others get nearer. And the window is always on my left.  

I’m crying now. Breathing quickly and lightly with tears running down my face. The rest of my body just moves back towards the table. I’m amused, frustrated, augural, bored, lonely, panicked and confused by the repetition.  

The door is too obvious not to open it. I have to assume somebody made it and made the table to hide the key under and the window to allow the light to show me what to do. Is it there to inspire me or taunt me? Is it a clue? Is there any meaning here at all? Of cause I take the key again to the door opening it inward.
