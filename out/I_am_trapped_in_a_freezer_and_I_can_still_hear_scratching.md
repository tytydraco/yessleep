So this is how it ends: bloody, freezing, and alone in the back of a damn pizza shop. I can still hear it scratching, trying to get into my icy resting place, (though the sound is becoming more and more faint). How did all of this start, you might be asking yourself? Well, my buddies and I were driving to a Halloween party when our car broke down on the side of McCarthy Road. McCarthy Road cuts through the backwoods of our town like a scar—long forgotten, barely patrolled, and perfect for drunks who don’t want to be found. Near the end of the road, there is a turnoff into the woods. Every year, the local college kids throw a massive Halloween party there. That’s where we were headed before we got a flat tire.



It took nothing for my friend Eric to switch out the tire. His dad is the local mechanic, and he practically lives there. My other buddy's Arin and Roddy were horsing around in the woods, they had already indulged in some booze, they scored some off some poor sucker at the corner store in town. Eric had the tire fixed and got back in the car, but Arin needed to take a leak in the woods, so we all waited.



After 10 minutes had passed, we figured that he either passed out in the woods or was on the verge of getting lost, so we begrudgingly marched out into the woods with our flashlights. That's when we heard him scream.



We rushed toward the scream, when the stench hit us—wet earth, rotting meat, and something worse underneath, something old. I could barely keep my eyes open as they began to water. 



When we finally caught up to Arin, we saw it: a figure with rotting gray flesh, decayed teeth, and claws sharp as nails. It was crawling out of the rough dirt, gripping Arin’s leg and tearing chunks of flesh from it. We yanked Arin free just as the creature pulled itself from the ground. More of it came into view—its skin hung in strips, slick with decay, and its sickly yellow eyes locked onto us like a predator scenting blood. We ran. Roddy helped Arin, while Eric and I led the way back to the car.



“What the fuck was that!” Eric said



“I don’t know, all I did was piss on the ground and he just popped out.” Arin said.



“Seems to have pissed it off.” Roddy replied.



We made it back to the car and we helped Arin into the back seat we could hear it coming from where we came from. It seemed like it was gaining on us. Eric started the car, and we took off. I saw the sprinting figure burst out of the woods. The look in its eyes gave me a nasty chill in my spine as it ran back into the woods.



“Did we lose him?” Eric said.

“Looks like it, we gotta get Arin to a hospital.”We heard what seemed like a gargled roar as we rounded the bend. Out of the shadows, the thing ran in front of our car. 



“Holy Shi-” Arin screamed.



The impact launched Arin forward, glass flying around him like shrapnel. What followed was quick, brutal, and final. The car ended up in a ditch on the side of the road. As we all hobbled out of the scrap heap,  we all saw the thing crawl up from where the hood of the car would have been. We took off down the road, passing Arin's eviscerated corpse on the ground. The thing started to hobble towards us, slowly picking up speed as the woods passed around us. You know how they say you don't have to outrun the bear, you just have to outrun the guy next to you? Well, that’s what happened. Roddy happened to be the slowest of us, and that's what did him in. The next thing Eric and I heard was the noise of ripping flesh and Roddy’s scream. Our legs carried out on that deviled street until we finally reached town. We darted down Deerborne Drive to the Sheriff's office. 



Sheriff Barkley was watching the TV, legs resting up on a chair. He barely noticed Eric and I crashing through the door.



“Sheriff! You have to help us, there is like something out there, it murdered Roddy!”



He leaned in towards us without ungluing his eyes from the Tv.



“What's that boy’s? Night going ok?”



“What? Did you even hear us, our friends are dead!”



“Woah, ok calm down.”



Barkley shut off the Tv and stood up.



“What happened?”



“We don’t know where this thing came from, but it killed Arin, Roddy and totaled my car!” 



Sheriff Barkley tightened his holster on his hip 



“You’re telling me your friends are dead and it wasn’t a damn deer? Son, don’t screw with me tonight.”



In that instance we heard it, the bloodcurdling growl we heard from the woods. It was here.



“What the hell was that?”



With a thundering crash the Ghoul had busted the Sheriff's front door.



“What is that?” 



It began lumbering towards us, faster and faster. That's when I heard the bang from Barkleys gun, but it was too late for him, the thing latched onto him, tearing chunks of flesh off of his neck consuming his face. His screams drowned through the whole station as me and Eric bolted out the front door. 



We went from Deerborne, to Devalue Road, to Main Street and ended in the downtown area of our town. Eric smashed through the back door of Tony’s Pizza, and we stumbled into the cold, fluorescent-lit kitchen.

We barricaded the doors with tables, chairs, and anything we could drag across the floor. The pizza shop was pitch dark, save for the flickering neon "OPEN" sign buzzing in the front window. Eric kept watch near the counter, peeking through the blinds while I sat slumped in the corner, bleeding, shaking, trying to catch my breath. My pulse throbbed in my arm where I’d taken a hit during our escape—might’ve been glass, might’ve been claws, I didn’t look close enough.

For a while, it was quiet. That kind of quiet where even your breathing sounds too loud. We thought maybe we’d finally lost it, that maybe the thing gave up once we got into town. Monsters don’t like streetlights and sidewalks, right? That’s what we told ourselves.

But then, just after midnight, we heard the front glass shatter. One clean, sharp crack, like a lightbulb exploding right in your ear. That same low, wet growl echoed from the dining area—closer this time, like it had been waiting. Watching. Toying with us.

Eric whispered, “It’s here,” like he couldn’t believe it, like naming it would make it more real. He grabbed a pizza pan like it would actually do something, told me to run for the back while he tried to slow it down.

“I’m not leaving you, man,” I said, already choking on fear.

“You don’t have a choice.”

He shoved me, hard, and I bolted. I heard metal crash behind me, the sound of claws scraping against tile, tables flipping, something being thrown. Then Eric screamed.

I’ll never forget that scream. Not as long as I live—which, depending on how this ends, might not be long at all.

I made it to the back, slipping on what I thought was spilled sauce—until I saw the smear of red and the shredded apron lying next to it. I don’t know who it belonged to. Don’t want to. I saw the freezer door, hanging slightly open like an invitation to hell or salvation—I couldn’t tell which. I yanked it wide, ducked inside, and slammed it shut behind me. The lock clicked automatically.

Then... silence. Or almost silence.

That’s when the scratching started. First soft, then more insistent. Nails, claws, whatever they were, dragging against the metal like it was trying to remember how doors worked. Like it was testing the edges. Like it knew I was in here.

So here I am. Lying all bloody inside the local pizza shop’s walk-in freezer. I can still hear it scratching, trying to get into my icy resting place—although it’s becoming more and more faint. Maybe it’s losing interest. Maybe the cold is slowing it down. Or maybe it’s just waiting me out. That thing doesn’t feel hunger or fear or cold—it just... is. A walking corpse with rage in its bones. And it wants me next.

I don’t know how much longer I can stay awake. My fingers are numb. My breath fogs with every exhale. I keep thinking about Roddy and Arin. About Eric. About how fast it all unraveled. One moment we were just dumb kids on the way to a Halloween party. The next... we were running for our lives from something that shouldn’t exist.

And if you're reading this—if someone actually finds this messed-up tale written on a dead guy’s phone—please believe me. Don’t write me off as some drunk college burnout. Don’t say we imagined it. The Ghoul is real. And it’s out there.

Don’t go near McCarthy Road. Don’t piss in the woods. And for the love of God, don’t ignore the smell of rot.

Me? I’m just hoping the cold is enough to hide me. Or kill me before it finds a way in.

Either way... this freezer might be the only thing between me and becoming what I saw in those woods.

The Ghoul took my friends. It took my town. And if that scratching gets louder again... it’ll take me too.
