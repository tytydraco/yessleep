I won't lie when I say that Gregory Holden was the best person I've ever met. He was the ideal best friend anyone could ask for, kind, supportive, passionate, bubbly, everything. He was truly an amazing person. He befriended me when we were in middle school. I had insecurities that I kept within myself, so it surprised me when he came to the lunch table I sat at and struck up a conversation with me.

At first, I was a little indifferent to Gregory. I felt someone like him didn't deserve to talk to someone like me, someone who was just another face you see whenever you go to a party. Someone who sticks to the crowd. Someone like me. Even though I liked that, it pained me at the same time. I didn't feel I deserved to be with someone as popular as him. But Gregory helped me break out of my shell. Over the following months, I warmed up to him and since then, we've become best friends.

We told each other our secrets that we hadn't shared with anyone else. I told him how much of a fan I was of plushies, and he told me about interests he liked that no one else knew about besides me. It was shocking, for both of us, but we soon managed to promise each other not to tell anyone else about it. We even pinky promised on it too.

We soon graduated from middle school and soon moved on to high school. Gregory's popularity skyrocketed even better as he got along with most students and teachers. He was a star student and had the skills to prove that, he had perfect grades, a good build for sports, and an amazing personality, along with splendid charisma. Everyone admired him, including me.  Even if I was somewhat like his wingman, I was still happy to be by his side. I didn't care if people didn't notice my presence, I only cared about being by Gregory's side.

Everything was going so well, I was doing so well mentally, but then it happened. I still remember how numb I felt when the news broke. I didn't want to believe it, nobody did. But it was true: Gregory killed himself.

They found him hanging in his dorm room, his body swaying under the ceiling fan. Everyone was horrified. Nobody expected a bright and popular person like Gregory to kill himself suddenly. He didn't show any signs, nor did he leave behind a note, he just...did it. Many people were distraught over his death, especially his girlfriend, Laura. She even stopped showing up for a full week straight. I still remember seeing the flowers and candles in his locker while passing by. I felt like tearing up at the sight but forced myself not to, and walked away.

I attended his funeral, gave a heartfelt speech about how much Gregory changed my life for the better, watched him get buried, and met up with his parents. We talked about Gregory for a bit, how much of a brilliant person he was, his father assured me that what happened was never my fault. So did my parents, they told me that Gregory's suicide had nothing to do with me. I knew that. But I still felt numb. Although no one knew the full reason as to *why* he did, his parents hoped that wherever he was now, was peaceful.

When I returned home, I cried in my bed that night. I clutched my pillow as I wept uncontrollably over losing the one and only person that was there for me.

It was only 2 weeks later when the accidents started happening. The first victim was a student-athlete named Eric, who ended up in an accident, where his car wrapped around a tree. Eric miraculously survived but was in critical condition. Not only that, he lost his legs, meaning he could never do sports again, and was forced to use a wheelchair for the rest of his life.

A week after Eric's accident, Mia, an honor student who had a bright future fell down the stairs and went into a coma. However, according to her friends who were there when she fell, they said it looked like someone had *shoved* her down the stairs. That didn't make sense and some believed they could have pushed Mia down the stairs. Fortunately, a security camera showed that none of her friends pushed her when she fell, proving their innocence.

2 weeks after Mia's accident, Mr. Adkins, the Chemistry teacher was recently rushed to the hospital after sustaining caustic burns after a few chemicals had spilled on him during his class. He and some other students claimed that it looked like the beakers containing the chemicals were knocked off the table they were on, and spilled onto Mr Adkins.  However, some students and teachers chalked that up to Mr. Adkins seeing things, he was old after all, so what were the chances that he could have probably just spilled the chemicals on himself?

The most recent accident just so happened about 5 days ago. It happened to Warren, a stoner kid who spends time in the bathroom vaping or always showing up to school on some drug. I don't have the full details of what happened, but from what I heard he was found in the bathroom, with so much cocaine forced down into his system that it was a miracle that he didn't end up OD'ing. That was the last straw, and the rumors began unfolding.

Some students whispered that Gregory's suicide could have somehow caused a curse within the campus, while others believed that Gregory's spirit himself was causing the accidents to happen. Some people chalked up the accidents to just being bad luck. Others denied bad luck being the cause.

I just ignored the rumors about it. Instead, I just followed in Gregory's footsteps. I adopted the personality that Gregory once had, studied way harder, and managed to get on the honor roll a few times, and soon managed to become one of the top of my class. My popularity, along with my grades slowly started to rise. The reason I did that was probably as a coping mechanism & so people could feel like a part of Gregory was still here.

Of course, some people were uncomfortable that someone like me was suddenly starting to act like Gregory, and they didn't repay me, but I didn't care. If it meant I could make people feel like Gregory was still here. I also made sure to check up on Laura to see how she was doing and help her through the tough times she was facing. Over the months, we've grown closer. I guess the death of someone close tends to create relationships. I even gave her some flowers on separate occasions, showing her that everything would be ok. It warms my heart to see the smile on her face.

I had just finished a conversation with her on the phone and had started back to my dorm room on the way there, I felt the happiness and joy I'd been showing begin to wear off. My facade for the day was starting to disappear. I went inside, locked the door behind me, and dropped my bag to the ground. I then went to light a candle, before entering the bathroom. I closed the door, placed the candle on the sink, and stared into the mirror for a long time, looking at the man I had forced myself to become.

"All right, I'm back," I said to the mirror.

"*Steeeephieeeee\~"* a voice cooed close to my ear. I felt shivers crawl inside me, just like every other time. Then I saw him appear in the mirror. Gregory. I could see the mischief and gentleness in his eyes, the Cheshire cat-like grin on his mouth, and the marks around his neck. My hands trembled as I waved to him, and he waved back. I then started speaking.

"Listen, you had your fun, but this can't go on any longer, you and I both know that you can't keep hurting people like this. You could have almost killed Warren..."

"But it's fun\~!" Gregory said slyly; "You should have seen his face when they found him\~!" I shook my head.

"No, none of this is fun. What you did to the last 4 people was horrible...You could have killed them..." I said, starting to raise my voice. "You can't keep on doing shit like this, because one day your little pranks are gonna end up getting someone killed.".

A full minute passed, and during that time, Gregory looked conflicted. But then he let his grin come back again.

"Well, how about this, I get to hurt 4 people, then I'll stop\~! But if you don't want me to do that, then I'll have to do something to make up for those 4 people..." his eyes fell back on me, and I could already piece together what he meant by the grin widening. Shit.

"Fine..." I spoke, defeated, "But promise me those 4 people won't end up dying, and promise me I won't be one of them... Alright...?

"Of course\~! After all....we're best friends\~"

"Pinky promise?" I asked, holding my pinky out. Gregory let out his pinky in the reflection of the mirror.

"Pinky promise\~!" he giggled.

As he said this, I felt hands softly grip my shoulders, and in the mirror, was my reflection, but Gregory stood over me, that Chesire cat grin growing wider with each passing second. My heart rate started to increase faster, and I felt the beams of sweat evolve into droplets. Then I felt the presence of Gregory leaving the bathroom, along with his reflection. A hallow, mischievous laugh echoed out.

I fell to the bathroom floor and began panting. 

Yeah, he was popular, but despite the many people who liked him, there were some things they never knew about that only he told me about. When I told him how much I loved plushies, he told me he was secretly interested in the occult. He was slowly starting to become obsessed with it. He was always looking into different types of spirits, demons, and other hostile entities. Despite how dark they were, Gregory embraced them. He loved the thought of encountering an entity. And that obsession only got worse as we got into high school

He also told me about how much he liked to....commit acts against people...hurting them and doing things that would get them injured severely. He even told me that he would frequently go to the forest to find some birds, where he would kill them, and then give them a burial, before doing it again the next day. Of course, his parents never knew about that, he kept it hidden, only confiding in me. And I guess the only reason why I didn't tell anyone else or stop being around him was because I was afraid.

Not just afraid of him doing something to me, but also of being alone again. I didn't want that. I assume Gregory didn't desire that either, despite his popularity, he didn't feel like he had an actual friend, and despite the people who were by his side, he didn't feel like they wanted to be his real friend. They wanted to be by his side to climb the social ladder. 

I couldn't stop remembering the night he told me about his plan, even though he gave me the diary that withheld all his entries about his obsession, I looked him in his eyes in confusion and terror, before bolting out of his dorm room. I didn't think he would go and do it until the next day. I still remember feeling numb, knowing that I could have tried persuading him, but I didn't.

And I regret not doing that to this day. I'm just hoping that Gregory keeps our pinky promise, I don't know how much of this I can take.
