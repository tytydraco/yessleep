I live on a quiet road. No through traffic, just houses on either side and the occasional dog walker. I bought a doorbell camera last month after a package went missing. Since then, it’s mostly just recorded cats, wind, and the neighbour’s teenage son sneaking back in after curfew.

Except for last Thursday night.

At 3:12 a.m., the camera recorded motion across the street. A man. Just standing there on the pavement, facing my house.

He wasn’t doing anything. Just still. Arms hanging at his sides.

It was foggy, so I couldn’t make out much detail—except that he wasn’t wearing a coat, despite the cold, and his head was tilted just slightly too far to the left. Like it wasn’t sitting right on his shoulders.

The clip ends after thirty seconds. He never moves.

Friday morning, I checked the live feed before leaving for work.

Nothing there. Empty street.

But when I got home and checked the motion alerts—he was back.

Same time. 3:12 a.m.

Only this time… *he was dancing.*

Slow, unsteady movements. Like a child pretending to be a ballerina underwater. Arms swaying. Head lolling with the rhythm.

There was no music, obviously, but his pacing was deliberate. He never stepped off the curb. Just swayed side to side. One foot up, one foot down. A slow, shuffling spin.

Then he stopped.

Turned to face my house again.

And waved.

The clip ended there.

••

I showed a friend. She thought it was someone drunk. Or on something.

So that night, I stayed up.

At exactly 3:12 a.m., the motion alert pinged.

I pulled up the live feed.

He was there. Same spot. Across the street. Dancing.

Same slow, unsteady rhythm. Arms swaying like dead weight, feet dragging as if the air around him was thick.

Then he stopped.

And turned his back to the camera.

He stood like that for maybe ten seconds, still swaying slightly—then his neck cracked so loudly it was picked up through the microphone.

I watched—frozen—as his head turned all the way around to face the camera.

But his body didn’t follow.

Not at first.

His head stared directly at me, upside down, mouth slack, eyes wide. He just stood like that—twisted and waiting.

Then, slowly, his torso began to rotate, like something inside was pushing against the spine, turning it piece by piece until the rest of him matched his head.

It didn’t look human.

It looked like a spider unfolding. Joints bending wrong. Movements sharp and snapping, like pulled tendons trying to mimic choreography.

Then he stood completely still.

And sprinted.

Straight at the camera.

No build-up. No warning. Just a sudden, explosive sprint—arms flailing behind him, knees high, head forward like an animal that hadn’t learned to walk upright.

He didn’t blink. His jaw hung open, loose and bouncing as he ran.

I couldn’t move. Just watched the live feed as he charged across the road, full speed, until the camera caught every frame of his face—

Then—

**BANG.**

The feed cut out.

**BANG. BANG. BANG.**

I heard it in real life. At my front door.

**BANGBANGBANGBANGBANG—**

Over and over. Not knocks. *Not even fists.*

He was throwing himself against the door. I heard the frame rattle. The chain inside vibrated against the lock.

••

…Then silence.

No retreating footsteps.

No breathing.

**Just a loud silence.**

I didn’t sleep. I sat on the floor across from the door, phone in my hand, staring at the peephole. At 3:27 a.m., I finally called the police. I didn’t know what else to do. I said someone had tried to break in. That there’d been pounding—aggressive, nonstop. That I had video.

They showed up twenty minutes later.

And found nothing.

No marks. No damage. No sign anyone had been near the door.

One of the officers even reviewed the footage from the doorbell camera with me.

But the clips were gone.

Not just the attack—everything. The dancing. The figure. The motion alerts.

All of it wiped.

The officer looked at me like I’d wasted their time. Told me it was probably a glitch. Maybe a weird dream. Maybe a prank.

But I didn’t imagine what I saw.

And I know what I heard.

••

I deleted the app the next morning. Took the camera offline. I wanted to believe it was over.

But tonight, just after three, my phone buzzed.

No app. No notification.

Just a text from an unknown number.

***“Are you watching?”***

I haven’t opened the door. I’m not going to.

But through the curtains, across the street—he’s there.

He’s not dancing anymore.

He’s just standing in the road.

Still.

Staring at my door.

And I don’t think he’s going to wait much longer.
