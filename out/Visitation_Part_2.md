Up until now you may have got the impression my life is a little lonely. Very good reason for that, it is. 

My parents are great people, but, despite government funded medical care, costs for conditions like mine add up surprisingly quickly. When I’m at home they are both working twelve hours plus a day, seeing either of them is rare, but cherished. 

When I’m in the hospital, well it can go weeks. 

But there is one person, ( other than medical staff, and the collection of pissed off horrors that have decided to make an appearance.) that I see fairly consistently. 

His name is Isaiah Starr, and he’s a freelance social worker. Which is an actual career, not just a plot device from The Maxx. 

If my family  was a little worse off I’d have a government sponsored aide with 6 years of schooling and a handful of degrees and certificates, but being stuck in financial no man’s land, I have, Isaiah. 

Which isn’t to knock the guy, I’m one of a dozen or so kids he works with, everything from early onset career criminals to those like myself. And from what I’ve seen and experienced, he busts his ass for each and every one. 

Just in ways that are a bit, non traditional. 

“Gave the security guy twenty bucks to take a walk. “ Isaiah offers me a small square vape pen. 

As I said, he’s not a, traditional social worker. 

“Not today, been feeling a bit under the weather. “ I say, trying to keep things light. 

They managed to get all of the Critters off of me, but the wounds, and raw red flesh of my legs is healing poorly. Amputation hasn’t been brought up directly, but I know it’s close to being on the table.  So keeping upbeat and focussed is difficult. 

“Well, time for the filling in the shit sandwich then bud. “ Isaiah says, taking a small hit off the device himself. 

He’s a short guy, dark hair, early thirties  and lightly tanned skin. He’s half native, I asked him once, what the other half was, and his only reply was “Asshole”, telling me a lot about how he viewed his missing father. 

“Saw that one coming. “ I say, with a chuckle. 

“What’s this crap I’m hearing about you hurting yourself? Doesn’t seem like you. “ Reading this, you might assume Isaiah is being a dick, but we have a kind of shorthand. 

That being said, I’m not used to lying to the man. Never had to, the whole point of his job is to listen to the darkest shit in my closet and get me help when I need it. Not much of a point in giving him half the truth, until now. 

“Can you call it hurting myself if I didn’t feel it? “ I deflect. 

“Super funny. 14 year old self harm, I’ll be giggling to myself the whole way home. 

You stabbed yourself, pretty deep, why? “ He’s blunt, and he holds eye contact with me, he’s not mad, just, serious. 

“You really have to ask? 

It was bad, I thought maybe bleeding out in a hospital bed would be better than watching my electrical grid shut down. 

It was stupid, and I realized that before I did any serious damage, but not before making it obvious enough to get Mr. Personality out there stationed outside my door. 

Not something I’ll be trying to do again man. Honestly. “ The lie comes out smooth, I’m a little surprised with myself. 

Isaiah looks at me, when he wants it to be, his face is unreadable. 

“You’re at least half full of shit. But, I believe the part about you not wanting to do it again. 

You want to open up, let me know, otherwise, just call me if you feel the need to go artery mining again, like you should have this time. “ Isaiah chides me. 

For the next hour we talk about things that are a bit more light hearted. Comics, video games, life stuff that doesn’t involve medical trauma or demonic entities. Isaiah isn’t a psychologist, but having a real person to shoot the shit with, it keeps me sane none the less. 

We’re into a conversation about Battlefield, when I say, almost on impulse, “Do you know about the paranormal? “ 

The abrupt topic change raises Isaiah’s eyebrow. 

“ Me? “ He laughs, “ Well, I think it’s a load of shit. 

I mean, I’m a native social worker, so I have a lot of respect for tradition, from a cultural standpoint. But as far as belief, not a drop. 

That being said, I have to work with Elders, Chaplains, Rabbi’s, healers, and everything in between, so I’ve heard a lot of, differing opinions on the subject. 

Why the interest? “ 

I don’t lie, so much as give a, unique version of the truth. 

I tell him about something I read online, about Art and Grynn, give him the Cliff’s notes, I just don’t tell him that I wrote it. 

“Phil, I mean, I’m just going to say it, you don’t have to worry about crap you read online. 

Then again, I get it, being online is a huge part of your life. 

I guarantee you, this is nothing. But if it’ll make you feel better, I’ll run it by some of my Woo-Woo folks. “ I can feel the fact that Isaiah thinks this is stupid, but what I love about the guy is, I know that won’t stop him trying to help. 

Hours after one of the only friends I have leaves for his next  client, I’m watching YouTube videos about folklore, urban legends, and demons, while trying to force myself to eat another night of hospital meatloaf. 

The big A came up in a meeting with Dr Dali. He dropped the bomb as gently as he could, but it destroyed me none the less. 

The Impending loss of a limb makes it hard to focus on finding anything of use online, not that I’d know the difference between real and fake paranormal advice anyway.  And as the clock starts to approach the late hours of the night, I’m a frayed wreck. 

I can’t tell if my mental state is simply the toll of everything, or something more, esoteric. But I feel manic and exhausted, aggressive and fearfull, cornered, vicious. 

I try to feel that darkness that has taken over my dreams. To touch that absent power I was promised, I close my eyes, and concentrate. 

Nothing. 

But when I open them, a familiar, lipless, chemical paled face is inches from my own. 

“Having a restful stay in the hospital Phil? “ Grynn says, his breath smells like blood and burnt sugar. 

I whimper, offering a panicked look as a reply. 

“Rude not to answer a person.”, Grynn pulls up a cheap hospital chair, dragging it across the floor with an agonizing screech, “  I’m real forgiving, so I’ll let it slide. 

But I wouldn’t test my patience again. 

Why do you think I’m back Phil? “

“I hope it’s because you found a way to get us out of this situation. “ I say, trying to keep my response neutral. 

A cloud passes over Grynn’s already intimidating face. 

“ Us? 

Can I ask you something? When did humanity get so fucking stupid? 

When did you stop understanding monsters are, monsters, and start thinking you could bang Medusa and fight side by side with the headless horseman? “ As I read this, it sounds like Grynn may have found this amusing. But his tone is rage, and hatred, like this concept is a personal insult, he stands, sending the chair clattering into the wall. I wonder how the noise hasn’t attracted anyone. 

“ I… I don’t know” I stutter, stress, fear, and my own bad wiring make my voice nearly inaudible. 

“I don’t accept your ignorance. “ Grynn growls, red tinted spit stains my shirt, the entity looms like an evil moon, “ There is no, us, I don’t know who’s on your team, but it certainly isn’t me.

Phil, I’m here tonight to let you know how I plan on dealing with this situation. 

Art wants the story to be about him. He wants to weave the threads of the universe into a new suit for himself. So, my plan is to change that up. 

This isn’t a story about Rats and demons anymore. No, now Phil, this gets to be your story. 

I’m going to cause waves so big, his little ripple gets swept away. “

He’s frenzied, saying the words like a threat to Art himself. 

“Can’t it be anyone else? “ I whisper. 

Grynn stops his pacing, in a flash, he grabs my leg, the same recently stitched spot he buried one of his knives the night before. There is a crunching noise, and blood stains the sheets. 

“Maybe, maybe not. But the thing is Phil, I fucking hate you. 

Every way your life could pan out right now, offends me. You don’t get to be a hero, you don’t get to be a monster. You are meat, you are cattle, you are a victim and you having the opportunity to change this is a travesty. 

So, I’m going to get this little tale of yours moving back in the right direction. 

I’ve started doing things, awful things, and all of these , despite logic or reason, will trace back to you. 

That little hell Art wants you to go through, oh, Phil, you will look forward to sleep once I get started. See, that, it’s a hidden battle, and you, you are the type of little hard ass that could probably take whatever lumps he throws. 

But me? I’m going to make sure the world knows your name. “  Grynn is panting, he punctuates his sentences by slamming his fist into my body, likely leaving bruises I'll have to explain tomorrow. 

“No one is going to believe I’m responsible for anything awful. “ I plead with the entity. 

His exhale is a reeking, rattling waft. 

“Oh, so, to your line of thinking, this will be the one time the world accepts a supernatural event? 

Seriously, governments around the world will put aside codes of silence for one, poor crippled boy. 

This is what you think? 

No Phil, somewhere between the media and the police they will come up with some narrative that fits. No one will look into cracks in the story, and those that do will be branded insane. 

And on the off chance we get nothing but journalists and police with hearts of gold and spines of steel? Well, some very powerful people will make some very powerful suggestions. “ I have no doubt that Grynn can, and will make good on his threat. 

I’m shaking, I feel my world collapsing in upon itself. Grynn watches, looking ecstatic. 

“You don’t have to do this. “ I say, in vain. 

“Oh, but Phil, I already have. “ Grynn laughs, and snatches my phone, he types and scrolls, then clears his throat, putting on a smooth news anchor tone that is nothing like the rancid growl I’ve heard so far, “ Elizabeth McArthur age, 30 was found dead today in her East Vancouver home. 

Due to the nature of the death, authorities suspect foul play, and are encouraging any members of the public to come forward. 

Blah, blah, blah, young life taken, blah…. Here we go. 

Elizabeth was known in the local community for her heroics when employed as a lifeguard at a local beach, saving the life of the useless little bastard sitting in the hospital bed in front of me. 

I ad libbed a little bit at the end there, but you get the gist. “ The creature tosses the phone on my bed, out of reach by about 6 inches. 

He stands, facing away me for a long time. Breaking the silence with nothing more than the erratic clicking of his teeth. 

I find myself thinking that one thing, no matter how dangerous, can’t possibly pull off a conspiracy this large. Some step along the way will get him caught, it has to. 

“You still don’t get it do you? “ Grynn says, as if reading my mind. 

He starts to chuckle, a mean spirited vocalization. 

As he does, a set of pearl white teeth appear in one corner of the room, then another, soon, a dozen lethal looking grins surround me from the darkest corners of the hospital suite. 

Pale, white, arms pull out twelve identical bodies, twelve copies of Grynn all begin to laugh and threaten, half emerged from the walls and darkness. 

I feel like I’m going to lose it, the insane gibbering, the laws of nature being shattered in front of me. And me, absolutely helpless to do anything about it. 

Suddenly, the din stops, my ears ring from the sudden silence. 

All of the horrors around me speak in unison. 

“Do you understand now Phil? 

Sit back and enjoy the ride, because this is happening, and I am fucking everywhere. “ Grynn says this, as he begins to sink through the floor, the others around me retreating into their own impossible spaces, leaving me covered in sweat, and failing to stop a panic attack. 

The dreams come fast and clear. 

I am not controlling the swarm, I am the swarm. I hold no reigns, it’s all I can do to swim in tides of violence and hope I’m nearing the shore. 

It's clear, but everything is so, alien, so hard to digest. 

But, my shame, helplessness, they follow me. The total lack of agency in my own situation is stuck to me like a tick. 

I picture one of the men from the photos. If the information is to be believed, he’s a fan of barfights that go far enough to leave his victims mutilated, and in 2 instances dead. 

I try to see him in the hectic assortment of images screaming through my head. 

Something finds him, some limb of the swarm, a limb of mine. 

Despite not seeing what happens to the man, I know. A certainty that comes from stomachs full of his flesh, and fur soaked in his blood. 

The sense of power I have intoxicates me, for a brief, fleeting moment it pushes away all of the crushing horror and desperation. 

But I try and ride this wave of confidence, and fly too close to the sun. 

I try thinking of another of the faces from the envelope, but it won’t come. The image of the woman is indistinct and her details are muddled. 

The waves of hunger and violence sweep me away, I lose the spark of will and determination I briefly kindled as the swarm turns aimless violence toward anything it can, searching for a target without a description. 

The morning comes like a slap in the face. Sweat soaked, coughing and in my own filth, I still find the light of day a comfort. 

I know something is wrong when Dr. Dali is waiting for me once the poor PSW had finally cleaned me up. 

It was. 

Necrosis in three toes on my left foot. Amputation scheduled for 4 pm. There was a lot of dancing around the subject, and talking about what is going right in my treatment, but it all came down to losing a piece of myself in about 7 hours. 

I spend a couple hours staring. My overworked mind refusing to even attempt to process the never ending shit parade I’ve been through the last few days. 

I almost drop my phone when it starts ringing, deep in my own pool of self pity. 

“Phil, you busy? “ Isaiah says

“Not at all. “ I lie. 

“Good, we have to talk, man. 

That shit you were talking about, the stuff with the smiling guy at least, not good. 

I ran it up a couple of flagpoles, and a cousin of mine got me in touch with an elder that gave me a run down. 

What you are describing, kind of sounds like ‘ The Evil One’, yeah I know, the name isn’t exactly original, trust me, sounds better in Cree. 

The synopsis is that there was a time when the Gods walked the earth, just the Gods. And everything was pretty good. This was the first world. 

Then The Evil One, decided he didn’t like this too much and wanted to get some division going. Now, the rest of the Gods gave this a hard pass, having no reason to go to war, or take sides. 

In revenge, he burned the world, killing most of the God’s. And nature had to create man to keep the earth populated. 

Now all of this is the same kind of metaphorical, watch your back bullshit you can find in any religion. 

The interesting part though, is that, locally at least, there are a few folks who worship him, I wouldn’t say cult, but probably in the ball park. 

I’m going to go check on some things, but in the mean time, I have to ask you something. 

You aren’t the kind of kid to lose sleep over a horror movie. And I sure as hell couldn’t find any creepypasta that fit your description. 

Did someone from this fucking cult get in touch with you? “ Isaiah’s blunt question gets a quick response. 

I tell him a version of events, one that was stripped of Art, and any kind of proof of the supernatural. 

He believes it. And seems dead set on sussing out things from what he believes is the source. 

Stopping him would have been the heroic thing to do. He’s either wasting his time, or walking into something he is totally unprepared for. 

But, I can’t do it. I can’t lose the one person who is going to bat for me. With every passing day I’m losing more of myself, metaphorically, and literally. And willing or no, I need an ally. 

There is an I. V. In my arm, my left foot is washed and marked with surgical marker. As the combination of narcotics that will put me out begins to take hold, I take one last look at my mangled, but still in tact foot. 

Then, suddenly, I’m there. No German art house film acid trip, no hundreds of invasive thoughts.   Just a floor level view I assume is from a single rat. 

My thinking is clear enough to understand how important this is. This wasn’t meant to happen, this is some kind of flaw in twisted game I’ve been playing. 

Judging by the wadded up insulation and wires around me, I’m guessing I’m in a wall. The rats around me aren’t just sleeping, they are comatose, no, more than that, not a single one is breathing. 

But they aren’t dead, or, to be more specific, being alive isn’t really something that is applicable to any individual rat. This is the swarm. 

Pure, base instinct, as strong as the will to breathe let’s me know this as a fact. Other, darker knowledge seems just out of my reach. But calling, like a beacon in the fog. 

I focus, I can feel the body of the rat beginning to deteriorate, whatever supernatural glitch is causing this, rotting it from the inside out. 

I easily find a person, a woman in her twenties, huddled in her living room, I can smell the panic pouring off her. 

I try to talk, I plan on spoiling art’s entire plan, even if I can’t speak, I’m sure I can figure out some type of code. 

I don’t see the massive hardcover book until she throws it. By then it’s too late, I feel terrible crushing pain, worse than I would have ever thought possible. A moment of swirling darkness, and I’m somewhere else in what appears to be a run down apartment building, low to the ground and moving down a hallway. 

I really should have seen that coming. These people have been being terrorized for days now, the last thing they are going to take any chances with are one of the furred horrors tormenting them. 

I can’t just give up, and if talking things out isn’t an option… 

The paws of the rat are bloody stumps, but I’m half way through writing the name of the hospital, carving it deep into aging drywall.  I intend to leave a room number, and a name, hell I’ll scratch in any information I can get away with and leave a pile of rodent bodies as a punctuation mark if I can. 

But life decides to drop trow and take another shit directly on me. 

I come to in my room, if capable I’m sure I’d have sat bolt upright. But for once, my situation let’s me have a little dignity. 

My heart is pounding, the monitors around me sounding a half step away from making the world’s worst electronica song. 

I spare you guys so many of the medical conversations I have because, honestly they get boring. And I’m going to do you another favor here. 

Surgery went well, and Dr. Dali has no reason to believe that there will be any further complications. 

If he only fucking knew. 

I find myself staring at my foot, entranced by the concept that a part of me is just, not me any more. No matter how little I could do with it, no matter how numb, it was still a part of me. But now, it’s sitting in some bin or bag, waiting to be burned or dissected. 

The sun begins to set, and I can feel myself tense up. Dreading the next twist of this hopeless path. 

But, it isn’t quite hopeless now, is it? 

I mean, I’m far from well prepared, but whatever happened today, it means Art isn’t perfect, Grynn, isn’t perfect.  I may be up shit creek without a paddle, but I still have one good arm. 

I answer Isaiah’s call, it’s nearly 11 pm, and while I’ve most certainly called him this late, I’ve never Received a call from him past business hours. 

“Phil, you alone? “ He says, before I can even say hello. 

“Yeah, why? “ I reply. 

“I had a bit of a talk with some of those people we were talking about earlier. 

Zero reason to believe they are supernatural. Plenty of reason to believe they are dangerous as hell. 

To the point where I have no trouble believing one of them carved off half his face for the fear factor. 

The clear answer is to go to the cops, but it took me about thirty minutes to figure out they might not have them in their back pocket, but they have a decent amount of influence.  Kicking this up any kind of legal chain is going to require a hell of a lot of tact. 

No idea how  you got involved with these psychos, but I don’t care. I’m going to make sure your safe, it’s just going to take some time. 

Till then, just, watch out. If they have cops, they have plenty of other people in places you don’t want. “ I haven’t heard this tone from Isaiah before. He’s told me of an interesting life before getting into social work, but I’ve honestly never cared much. But the steel I hear in his voice makes me curious. 

We end our conversation, and I find myself feeling bad for the guy. 

He thinks his information shows me the situation isn’t as bad as I thought. 

I laugh in the dark, sterile room. 

What he told me, really only makes my situation that much worse. Adds another layer to this rotten onion of trauma and damnation. 

I turn on the television, needing something to distract me from the rapidly approaching trip to rodent themed hell. 

“ And making the situation even more tragic was the loss of their 15 year old son, Eric Denning. “ The pearl toothed woman on the newscast says. 

I know Eric, best friend before life robbed me of my ability to really be a kid, as short as that chapter of my life was. And while I’ve never held a grudge, or seen him as responsible, he did do his best to encourage the feat that left me changed forever. 

We drifted apart long ago, memories are short, and a couple years of friendship when we were practically still babies, means nothing in the grand scheme of things. 

I don’t so much cry myself to sleep, as use the sobbing to try and stave off the coming hours or horror, shame and violence.
