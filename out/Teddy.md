Teddy
Hi my name is Ashley and I’m 6. I live with my mom Mary and my dad Ed. We were a happy family till I got my new brother Roberto he’s 8. But we will get back to him in a minute. My parents, and I we’re always happy, but my parents always wanted a son. So they decided they wanted to adopt and that’s how Roberto joined our family, and his teddy bear Bulb.

That’s when thing started to go wrong. A week after my brother moved in I noticed him talking to his teddy bear, no one thought any thing about it at first I just thought he was weird but my parents told me that it was his way to adjust. I went into his room one night after him and daddy were fighting over taking out the garbage I walked in to him telling his teddy bear not to be mad and don’t do what he did before they were nice people and they were good to him to behave and not cause a problem. I just thought it was normal for someone to have a conversation with there stuffy. But what do I know I was 6.

As his first summer with us went on more strange things happened. The neighbors had this big massive dog that was named killer and he got out the gate and went after us killer got sight of the bear and started to retreat. He grabbed Blub out of his hands and Roberto started to scream. The poor dogs eyes started to roll back in his head and went into a convolution out of no where and blood started to pour out his ears, and eyes I had never seen anything like that before. All Roberto did was stand there and laughed at the poor helpless dog.

I ran home and told my mom what had happened. All Roberto did was say he didn’t do anything to the dog. He went up to his room cursing and telling Blub he was going to get them sent back to the orphanage.

Oh yeah I forgot to mention the 3 fires we had in the house, and the neighborhood bully thing. I guess I should start with the bully thing now that I mentioned it.

We were walking with my friend Lucy, and her mom. We were going to the aquarium with them to see the fish. I love fish by the way. We were at the sharks tank.

when James the biggest jerk of them all started to make fun of me. when Roberto turned around and told him to stop it! Blub started to turn red when James said he was an ugly old dirty teddy bear. And pushed Roberto down.

Lucy mom stopped the fight, and James went to throw Blub in the tank. There was a huge cracking sound, and the next thing you know the shark had slammed into the glass. Dark blood was. leaking everywhere, and the great white was eating James leg, trying to get back in the water. And Roberto just walked up to him and laughed out loud. While everyone else was freaking out. James was laying in a pool of blood and water. While we all watched covered in his blood, not knowing what to do until Lucy mom called ems. The paramedics showed up and they were trying to save him. Everyone was yelling and trying to retell what happened. Roberto walked over grabbing Blub from his hands and told him I hope you die. James lived but his leg was gone.

When we got home mom and dad were trying to calm me down. Roberto looked at Blub and said this is going to be fun.
