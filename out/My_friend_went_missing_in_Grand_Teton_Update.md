Hey everyone, you may have read about what happened to my friends and I in Grand Teton. Patrick wasn’t recovered after the flash flood, but his phone and pack were. They were able to pull his voice notes from the time he was gone, and I transcribed them here. If you haven't already, you read that story here:

June 29th 

I’ve always wanted to do a massive solo hiking trip. I see these videos all the time from people who backpack across the United States, or through the whole Rockies or something. It’s amazing, and I’ve always wanted to do it myself. 

I decided to give it a shot, but starting out in Grand Teton. People hike through there all the time, and while there are definitely some dangers, it seemed like a decent place to get started.

Don’t get me wrong, I’ve done all sorts of solo camping and hiking before so it’s not like I’m brand new and trying to start out on hard mode.

I gathered up my supplies, told my friends I would be in touch, and then I was off. I took three months off work (you have no idea how hard it was to swing that), and asked my sister to stay in my apartment until I got back. She’s been wanting to move out on her own for a while, so I figured this would be a good way for her to see what living alone is like.

The first week was awesome. I went at whatever pace felt right, mostly trying to push myself to walk as far as possible but occasionally just going at a leisurely speed that allowed me to take in my surroundings. Anyone who says Wyoming is ugly has never been to the right part of Wyoming. It may not be Washington, mostly trees and mountains, but it’s nice.

Things started to get weird out here though. At first when I would run into other hikers they were friendly, happy go lucky people. But the longer I’ve been out here, the more suspicious everyone seems to get. I keep hearing other hikers talking about something in the woods, and warning each other to be careful. I’m keeping my eye out for anything dangerous, and trying to keep in touch with my friends.

July 1st

There was something in my campsite last night. I don’t know what, but I woke up and found footprints all over the place. They look almost human, like I would imagine Bigfoot's tracks would look (although they aren’t huge). They were going back and forth like someone was dancing. 

I also found trash, like a raccoon had been raiding other people’s campsites and dragging its treasures over to mine.

I found another couple who were hiking and asked if they noticed anything weird around their campground. They said there were footprints, and something had gotten into their food. I suggested bears, but they said they think it’s a homeless person. I guess that makes sense.

I know this is going to sound weird, but I swear the days are getting longer. I don’t really know how to explain it, but each day seems to be stretching out farther and farther. Sometimes by the time I go to sleep at night, I feel like I’ve been up for weeks.

I and other hikers are still reporting the weird tracks around our campsite. Last night I saw that they went around and around my tent, but I didn’t wake up in the night. I sent a message to Landon letting him know what’s going on.

July 11th

No weird tracks around my campsite last night. I’m thinking it really was a homeless person. Hopefully they’re doing okay. It can be dangerous out here if you don’t know what you’re doing.

July 15th

I’m having weird dreams. Actually I’ve been having the same three weird dreams over, and over. In the first dream I’m walking through the forest, picking up pieces of myself. And I don’t mean stuff from my pack, I mean like fingers and eyeballs. I’ll be walking along, feeling like I lost something important, and then I’ll see my foot on the path. I’ll race forward and grab it, but as soon as I have it I realize I’m missing something else. I always wake up feeling like I’m missing some crucial piece of myself.

In the second dream, I’m walking through a house of mirrors. Unlike a normal house of mirrors this one looks like the forest, but I can tell it’s not if that makes sense. Like if you decorated a house of mirrors to look like one of those weird jungle restaurants my buddy Max is always wanting to go to. Every time I look in one of the mirrors it’s like it’s showing me someone else. I see other hikers I’ve run into out here, but they always look startled or terrified. Sometimes I see myself, but all my features are in the wrong places. At one point I saw myself and I looked perfectly normal, except I was missing my eyes. In the space where they should have been there was nothing. Then I lifted my hands, and showed that I was holding my eyeballs, one in each hand.

In the third dream I’m a tree in the forest. I can feel myself growing up from a sapling, watching as hikers and animals pass me by. Then my physical self approaches my tree self (tell me how to describe a dream without sounding insane) and my physical body lays down at the roots of the tree. The roots come up from the ground and wrap around my body, pulling me into the earth to suffocate. But instead of feeling panic, I just feel peace.

Every time I wake up from the third dream, I feel kind of sad. Like something precious was taken away from me. I know that sounds weird, but it makes me think that just being a tree in the woods might be really nice.

July 22nd

I lost something on the trail. I’m not entirely sure what I lost, but my pack feels too light and I know I must have dropped something. Dammit, I’m going to have to retrace all my steps until I find it.

July 24th

I’m not sure why, but people have gotten so much less friendly out here. I decided to retrace my steps at least for a day or two to see if I can find what I lost. Whenever I pass other hikers they either act like they can’t see me, or they skirt around me. I’m sure I look kind of homeless now, after more than a month of not shaving or getting my hair cut (or taking a shower), but it still hurts my feelings. 

July 29th

I gave up looking for it yesterday. I hiked the same trails over and over, asking everyone I came across if they found something I dropped. I’ve gone over the inventory in my pack a dozen times a day, but I still can’t pinpoint exactly what’s missing. I know something is, but I’m not sure what.

I have to stop thinking about it. If I keep obsessing over whatever it was I lost, I’ll go insane.


August 8th 

I’m more comfortable sleeping without a tent, I realized. It just makes me feel so much closer to nature. I could stay out here forever.

August 12th

I found out what I lost.

August 12th

I feel really clear headed for the first time in a while. It feels great to be out here.

August 15th

Other hikers don’t see me. Other hikers don’t talk to me. Other hikers don’t see the forest. Other hikers don’t talk to the forest. I am forest. They are hiker.
