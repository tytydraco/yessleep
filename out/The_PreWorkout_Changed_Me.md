Look, I know how this sounds. I've read the comments under posts like this. "Fake." "Creative writing exercise." Whatever ... I'm not here to convince you. I just need to get this down before I can't anymore.

Three months ago this gym Bro APEX\_Titan messaged me. He had like 2 million followers, I had maybe four thousand. Said he'd been watching my videos, saw something in me. Wanted to send me his "personal stack" to document the results.

Free supplements from a huge account? Obviously I said yes.

Then, every week, a black box appears on my doorstep. No label. Three things inside . Seven shaker bottles already filled with a thick, pink liquid. A handfull of brown capsules. Some kind of cream in a jar. There was also  a note card -- drink half a bottle before training, two caps after, rub the cream anywhere you want to grow. Film everything. --

The pre-workout was already mixed, which was weird, but whatever. It was dense, didn't slosh right. More like a protein shake but thinner.

First session I drank half the bottle like the card said. The gym felt different within minutes. Everything was louder; ... I could hear the guy three treadmills over breathing. The weights felt like toys. I hit 315 on bench for 8 clean reps when my one-rep max was 275. No spotter. The pump was fucking ridiculous. My skin felt vacuum-sealed around the muscle. That mind-muscle connection everyone talks about? I could feel every individual fiber contracting.

Posted a progress pic that night. Phone blew up. Gained 600 followers by morning. Comments full of "natty or not" and "bro's on that celltech."

Week two I wasn't sleeping much. Didn't need to. Four hours and I'd wake up wired, muscles twitching like I'd just slammed 400mg of caffeine. The cream burned when I rubbed it on my delts and lats, but good burn, like icy-hot except deeper. I swear I could feel things shifting under there.

Marcus spotted me on squats that Thursday. After my set he goes :

"Bro, you running something?"

"What? No, just dialed in my macros finally"

"Your traps are sitting weird. And you're up like 15 pounds in two weeks"

"Creatine water weight"

He looked at me for a second. "Your eyes look fucked up, man. You feeling okay?"

"I'm fine. You gonna lift or what?"

He didn't bring it up again but I caught him staring a few times. But that night I looked closer in the mirror. My veins were really visible, which is normal when you're lean, except these were pulsing in patterns that didn't really match my heartbeat.

Week five my eyes looked different. Bloodshot maybe, except not red. Pink. And the shape was off but I couldn't explain how. Photos didn't show it right. The mirror didn't either, not always.

I tried to skip a day. Didn't drink from the bottle one morning just to see what would happen. By 10am my arms were itching so bad I wanted to claw them open. Not the skin, inside, like the muscle itself was trying to get out. No amount of stretching helped. I caved and drank the whole bottle. The itch stopped immediately. Got to the gym and demolished arms. 21s on barbell curls with 95 pounds. My biceps felt like they were going to split the skin.

I woke up and my nipples were wet. At first I thought gyno, which happens when you mess with hormones. I'd seen it before, guys who cycle without proper AI get bitch tits. But this wasn't soft tissue. When I pressed on my pecs they felt full. Dense. Almost like they were swollen with fluid.

Not sweat. This was thick, pink, and it smelled exactly like what was in the bottle. I touched it and my fingers came away sticky. I squeezed my pec experimentally and more came out, a steady drip, and the sensation was ..... fuck, I don't even know how to describe it.

I stood there in front of the bathroom mirror watching pink liquid bead up and run down my abs. Licked my finger without thinking.  My heart rate spiked immediately. I felt that familiar heat spread through my muscles.

My body was making its own supply now.

I texted Titan. He didn't respond for hours. When he finally did it was just: "Good. You don't need the parcel anymore !"

Last week I woke up and didn't recognize myself. I'm big but wrong. My shoulders are capped like I'm on a gram of tests. My arms hang weird, lats flared out so wide I can't put them flat against my sides anymore.

I tried to film a check-in video. Watched it back and deleted it. My voice sounded off. Layered. And my face moved wrong  and when it smiled I felt muscles moving that I didn't know I had. Pulling my mouth into shapes that don't make sense.

I think we're sharing this body. Or maybe it was always its body and I'm just along for the ride now.

The pre-workout tastes different now. Thicker. The cream and pills  is almost gone. My skin is hot all the time. I keep filming. The comments say "GOALS" and "KING" and "what's your stack bro".

Titan posted yesterday for the first time in months. He doesn't look human. His proportions are all wrong. Nobody in the comments seems to notice.

He DMed me: "Welcome brother, now pass it on. find someone hungry !"

I found a kid with 3K followers posting sad progress pics, zero gain,  asking for help.

The box is packed. I addressed it this morning. Or something using my hands addressed it. Hard to tell anymore. I tried to throw the bottle away yesterday. My hand wouldn't let go. When I forced it my fingers bent backward at the wrong joint and I felt those rope things inside move them back into place like nothing happened.

I'm shipping it tomorrow.

The pump is everything.

UPDATE: Stop asking me for my secrete sauce!

If APEX\_Titan messages you, block him.

You won't though.

Nobody does.

We all want it too bad.
