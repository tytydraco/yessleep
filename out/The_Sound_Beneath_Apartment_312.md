I’ve lived alone for a long time. It’s not that I prefer solitude; it just kept happening that way. People leave, jobs change, numbers stop working, and one day you realize nobody has a spare key to your place.

When I moved into the building on 8th and Carson, I told myself it would only be for a few months. That was two years ago. The place was old but cheap. The manager, an old man with watery eyes, warned me that the pipes made noise at night. I told him I didn’t care. I should’ve.

At first, the sounds were ordinary—groans from the walls, a hum in the radiator. Then there was a new one: a slow, hollow tapping, like knuckles on metal. It came from under the floor. It started at 2 a.m. every night.

I knocked back once, half-joking. It stopped immediately.

That silence felt heavier than the sound had.

A week later, I heard the tapping again. Three knocks this time. I didn’t answer. I turned up the fan, but the knocks came through the white noise—three again, slower. I pressed my ear to the floor. The wood felt colder than it should have.

I told myself it was the heating system, or rats. Then the knocking moved. It slid from the corner of the room to right beneath my bed, like someone crawling slowly under the floorboards.

When I mentioned it to the manager, he said nobody had the unit below mine—it was sealed off after a pipe burst last winter. “No one’s been down there for months,” he said. “Don’t worry about it.”

That night, I barely slept. Around two-thirty, the air changed. The smell—metallic, damp. The knocks came again, but lighter, closer. I realized they weren’t on the floor anymore. They were on the underside of my mattress.

I didn’t move. I just lay there, heart punching against my ribs. The knocking stopped after three beats, as if whoever—or whatever—it was had realized I was awake.

I left the light on for the next few nights. The knocks didn’t come. But the silence began to feel wrong again, like the sound had just learned to wait.

Sometimes, when I came home from work, the window blinds were tilted differently. My mug would be turned so the handle faced the wall. Tiny things. Enough to doubt myself.

Then one morning I found footprints—bare, wet prints leading from the kitchen sink to the hallway, vanishing halfway to my bedroom. They were smaller than mine. I stood there for a long time, counting how many there were, like it mattered. Seven.

I told myself I’d call the manager again, but I didn’t. It felt like saying it out loud would make it more real.

By the third month, I started hearing voices through the vents. Not conversations, just breathing, slow and steady, like someone listening from the other side. When I leaned close, it stopped.

I recorded it once on my phone. The playback was only static, but buried under it was a sound like my own voice whispering. It said my name.

I stopped recording after that.

I started writing things down instead, little notes to remind myself of what was real. “Front door locked.” “Window closed.” “Tap off.” Every morning I’d find one note missing. Not torn, just gone.

Last night, I woke up to the sound of the front door opening. The chain was still on. But the door was wide enough for someone thin to slip through.

I sat there in the dark, listening to the slow drag of footsteps across the living room. I wanted to believe it was a dream, but I could feel the vibration through the floor.

When the steps reached the bedroom, they stopped. Then the tapping started again, three soft knocks against the bed frame.

I whispered, “What do you want?”

No answer. Just the sound of breathing—not from the floor this time, but from right beside me.

I didn’t move until the sun came up. When I finally looked, there was nothing. Only the imprint of a head on the pillow next to mine.

Today I went to the manager’s office. The door was locked. A neighbor said he moved out two weeks ago—left without a word.

I don’t know why I’m still here. I packed a bag this morning, but every time I reach for the doorknob, I feel that same cold air rising from under the floor, like it’s waiting.

The knocks haven’t stopped. They start earlier now, just after sunset.

I think it knows I’m leaving.

If someone finds this notebook, don’t come looking for Apartment 312.  
There’s nothing here worth finding.
