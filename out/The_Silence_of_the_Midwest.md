Although a happy tale overall, my childhood was not without the pitfalls that come with an isolated midwestern farm life. 

Due to the tiny population of my school, and my community at large, I quickly gave up on the idea of companionship and settled into the simple joys of solitude. 

To gaze through the fields of corn and soy onto a concrete road that seemingly dances eternally into the horizon--to awaken before the birds and tend to my family’s animals--to take a seat beside the paint-chipped porch railing and get lost in a novel until there's almost no sunlight left to read by. Simple pleasures that I could enjoy with solely my own company were the pinnacle of my existence at the time. 

Most days on the farm felt like a frolic through the Garden of Eden; however, like most children, my desires could not always be satiated.

The particular example that now screams within my memory happened when I was eight years old.

Nearly collapsing from boredom, I snuck up behind my mother while she was washing the dishes to shyly ask, “Can I go play in the field?” 

“No, treasure. It’ll be dark soon.”

“But why mama? I’ll be careful! I promise!”

“No, Joseph,” she responded, scrubbing the plate a little harder. “You’re not allowed out after dark! You know this.”

“But whyyy,” I whimpered, undoubtedly fanning the flame of her annoyance. 

“She won’t let you out,” the response rang out in a husky tone from the opposite end of the room, “because after dark is when The Beast comes out.”

“Bruno!” My mother whipped around to face the kitchen table where her brother sat. “Stop trying to scare your nephew!”

“What Beast, Uncle Bruno?” I perked up, my fascination peaking above my fear.

“There’s no Beast, treasure. Your uncle just likes making up foolish stories.”

“Oh, come now, Helen!” Uncle Bruno nervously chuckled, setting down his newspaper and peering over the rim of his glasses. “He’s gonna have to find out about The Beast sooner or later. Better I tell him than he finds out the hard way.” He paused. “Like I did.”

Exhaling sharply, my mother turned back to the sink. “It’s late, Joseph. You should be getting to bed.”

“Okay,” I forced out a little sigh as I turned away. “Uncle Bruno, will you tuck me in? I can’t sleep unless someone tucks me in.”

“Sure thing,” he smirked, leaning down to me and shifting his voice to a whisper. “I can tell you more ‘foolish stories’ too, if you’d like.”

My eyes lit up brighter than the stars that shone above the vacant fields. 

“I’ll tuck you in,” my mother interjected. “After you brush your teeth. In the meantime, I’d like to have a word with your uncle.”

As I sulked upstairs and into the bathroom, I could hear my mother ruthlessly tearing into Uncle Bruno. I couldn’t discern a word of what was said, but the pure venom in her tone assured me that my Uncle’s promise of more stories would never be fulfilled.
	
All I heard from him that night were defeated whimpers.

My eyes began to well up with tears as I spat out the toothpaste and started towards my bed.
	
When mother entered a few minutes later, she was met only with stoney rejection as I rolled over to face the window opposite my bedroom door.

She slunk across my carpet to sit beside me on my outer space themed comforter, her candy red locks brushing my face as she placed a delicate kiss onto my forehead.
	
“Sleep safe, treasure. I love you.”

“I’m already asleep. Go away.”

She let out a pained sigh, which I had interpreted as an admission of defeat. I had successfully gotten revenge for her unkindness to my uncle, and this small victory lulled me into a happy slumber as I marveled at the slivers of moonlight penetrating the black clouds in the midnight sky.

As I grew older, my mother began to provide me with more substantial reasons as to why I couldn’t go out past dark. When I was eight, it was because she said so, or because I might get lost. When I was twelve, it was because I might get kidnapped. When I was sixteen, it was because she didn’t trust me to drive safely and avoid all the potholes on the unlit country roads. Eventually, I gave in and grew accustomed to having a bedtime peculiarly early for a boy so close to adulthood. 

I’m fairly sure that the few other teens in the community had to abide by similar rules, as I never heard any news of a secret house party or a couple of young troublemakers sneaking a beer out in the fields. As darkness blanketed our community, everyone allowed it to fade into complete, inky silence.

I coexisted with the silence of the midwest into my twenties. Even now, as a grown man and the primary caretaker of the farm, my body seems to automatically prepare to go to bed far before the rest of the world.

In addition to the family business, I’m also the one typically in charge of the grocery shopping. The closest grocery store is nearly an hour away, so I only venture out when the cupboards are totally barren.

When he was still alive, Uncle Bruno was the one who’d drive us to the grocery store. He would let me pick out any desert I wanted in exchange for me not complaining about him blasting his favorite music on the way there and back. Usually, my mother and I couldn’t stand all the screaming in his favorite metal songs, but when I was zooming down the highway with my uncle and a fresh cupcake, any music could lift my spirits.

Looking back, I wish I’d paused the music for just a moment and taken advantage of our solitude to talk to him more. To ask him more about his “foolish stories”, about exactly what he knew. 

This would all make so much more sense if I had.

The particular day on which this story truly begins was the day of one of my infrequent excursions to restock the refrigerator. 

As my silver Ford F-150 approached the patch of woods that separated my rural community from the rest of civilization, I began to notice an abnormal amount of trucks on the road.

Not the kind you’d typically see along the highways, either. I saw at least seven identical armoured trucks, all coated in a suffocating black paint that seemed to absorb the light directly from my eyes. 

Weird, certainly, but easy enough to put out of mind and ignore.	

As I began to reach the border between the concrete of the road and the dirt of the woods, I lightly pressed on the brakes, preparing to hit the series of insufferable potholes that littered the road leading out of town. They’d been there as long as I had, and I’d learned to learn to live with them, seeing as the city seemingly never decided to fix them.

The usual irritating sound of my truck bumping over the potholes was replaced with a sickening, wet squelch. 
	
Shit, did I just hit a rabbit or something?
	
The unmistakable sound of juices being forced out of soft, organic material repeated from underneath my tires.

Perplexed by the repulsive sound, I turned my car stereo down to nearly a zero and began to pull over, the squelching intensifying as I pulled over to the shoulder of the road.

As I stepped out of the Ford, my foot made contact with the source of my confusion, and with the final, soggy squirt, my foot sunk into a four inch pothole, taking the rest of my body down to the ground beside it. 

“Shit!” I cried out to an empty sky, yanking my wet appendage from the pothole.

As my eyes drifted to look over my leg for injuries, I found myself far more disturbed by the source of my pain than anything that it could’ve physically inflicted on me. 

The pothole that I had fallen into was filled entirely with meat. 

Raw, bloody, and slightly caked with dirt, the thick hunks looked to have been intentionally placed to fill the hole perfectly, disturbed only by the unexpected intrusion of my stray limb.

Baffled, I rose steadily from my seat on the pavement. Wanting to put this bizarre discovery behind me, I told myself that the trucks I saw were probably coming from some slaughterhouse and that one of them had accidentally spilled some of their product. It made no sense when I considered the seemingly systematic placement of the meat, but it was the most logical explanation that I had at the time.

Great, now my leg’s probably gonna bruise, I thought, taking one final glance over the road as I hopped back into the driver’s seat of my truck.

The sight I was greeted with rendered me frozen in an instant.

All of the potholes in the road were neatly packed with meat.

Every last one of them.
	
With a sudden sense of alarm, I thrust the vehicle into drive, quickly fading into the woods and hoping to forget how unsettled I was by the time that I reached the grocery store.
	
I blasted through the forest and into town in record time, my confusion failing to fade over the course of the journey. By the time I reached the grocery store, my mind was still miles away, wandering aimlessly through the labyrinth of meaty lesions that plagued the road. 
	
As I perused senselessly through the fresh fruits section, my hand brushed over the top of another’s as we both reached for the last mango.
	
“Sorry,” I muttered, handing the mango to the hunched, elderly woman. 
	
“Oh, dear!” She gingerly placed the mango back into my hand as she shifted her gaze to meet mine. “Here, take it. You reached for it first, I believe.”
	
My eyes were illuminated with simultaneous gratitude and recognition. “Mrs. Selena! I haven’t seen you in a while.”
	
“Oh, Joseph, is that you?” She adjusted her tiny glasses and smiled. “I could hardly recognize you! You’ve gotten so big since I last babysat you. How’ve you been, my boy?”
	
“Yeah, I’ve been mostly, uh, good,” my typical struggles with small talk were exasperated by my extraordinarily absent mind.
	
“How’s your mother? Does she still work on the farm? I passed your farm on the way here, you know. Looks like a lovely corn harvest this year!"

“Mom’s good, still working. Harder than she should be.”

I inhaled sharply before changing the subject to the only thing that I could think of at that moment.

“Mrs. Selena, did you drive through the woods on the way here?”
	
“No other way to get here, my boy. Why do you ask?”
	
“Did you see the, um. Uh, were the…”
	
Curiosity in her gaze, Mrs. Selena tilted her head as I struggled to word my question properly. 
	
“Did you see the potholes?”
	
“Oh, yes. Can’t drive into town without hitting one or two of them, I’m afraid.”
	
“No, I mean…” I sighed as I spoke. “Did you see what the potholes were filled with?”
	
Now her confusion was beginning to eclipse my own. “The meat, dear. As usual. Are you feeling alright?”
	
“What?” I spat, sounding angrier than I felt. “What do you mean, ‘as usual’?”
	
“It’s the first of the month, Joseph,” Mrs. Selena responded, taking on a far more serious tone. “Have you lost track of time?”
	
“No, I haven’t--nevermind. Nice talking to you, Mrs. Selena,” I mumbled, clutching my shopping cart handle and rushing to the self checkout line.
	
If she responded, I didn’t hear her. I was utterly deafened by my own internal monologue. 

As my auto-piloted arms inserted my debit card into the self-checkout and began to bag my groceries, only one thought repeatedly crossed my mind.
	
I have lived in this town for twenty-four years and never once has this happened before.
	
Shuffling out to my truck and struggling to balance my excessive amount of grocery bags in my right arm, I began reaching for my cell phone with my left. As I piled the food into my trunk, I fumbled with the device as I attempted to find my mother’s number. 
	
The phone cried out with its irritating buzz for thirty seconds before she picked up.
	
I shifted my phone into my right hand as I yanked the truck door open and hopped into the driver’s seat, starting the car as the conversation began. 
	
“Joseph, are you alright? You’ve been taking more time to shop than usual,” my mother’s mildly concerned voice echoed through the phone’s tiny speakers, “You haven’t run off with some city girl, have you?”
	
I pushed past her attempt at a joke straight into the heart of the matter. “Mom, I ran into Mrs. Selena at the grocery store today.”

“The woman who babysat you back in the third grade? Or wait, was it the fourth grade?”

“Doesn’t matter. I’m calling because she said something a little…weird.”

“Well, she must be pretty old by now. Her mind…might not be all there anymore.”

“Yeah, you’re right,” I sighed. 

But just to be sure.

“Mom, she said something about the potholes.”

I need to know that I’m not crazy.

“About the potholes being filled with meat. Is that—is that—normal? For the first of the month?”

Her silence was deafening. 

My heartbeat swelled in my chest, drowning out the noise of my tires tearing through the dirt roads of the woods as all of the blood rushed to my face in an orgy of red-hot panic. 

Either Mrs. Selena was losing her mind or I was, and my mother’s response would decide which.
	
My heart jolted to a stop as my mother’s voice cursed me from the other end of the call. 
	
“Joseph, are you feeling alright?”
	
I failed to muster a response.
	
“The meat’s on time as always, Joseph. Honey, have you forgotten?”
	
“Love you, mom. Bye.”
	
After unceremoniously ending the call, I continued the drive home in a stoney, screaming silence.
	
Departing from the forest, I caught one final glimpse of the potholes in the rearview mirror. Their curdled, blood-covered fillings seemed to joyously mock my slipping sanity long after they disappeared past my line of sight. 

The final words of my mother echoed throughout my cranium even after I pulled into the driveway and ran up to my room, disregarding the groceries in the back of my truck.

"Have you forgotten?"

Had I forgotten? Or was this an ordinary tradition in our isolated little community that I had somehow been ignorant of for my entire twenty-four years of existence? No. It wasn’t possible. I’d driven that way maybe a hundred times. That road had raised me as much as my mother and my uncle and the fields of corn and soy that stretched past the twilight hour and into the new day.

In a moment of conviction, a moment of desperation for an explanation, I felt my Uncle Bruno smiling on me. My spirit of curiosity had been reanimated, and I would not allow it to die again.

Come hell or high water, I would prove to myself that, despite how crazy I felt, I had never been more sane.

All I needed to do was go out after dark.


Fearful visions flashed before my eyes as my truck crept along the still country roads. 

The smell of that raw meat, rancid and desperate to begin rotting. The fumes of the processed carcasses that littered my roads tortured me even in memory.

The sight of my mother, passed out in bed. I had checked at least a dozen times to ensure that she had been accosted by slumber before I ventured into the night.

The sound of my dear uncle, admonished for fueling my childhood curiosities. His tales of beasts, as irrational as they may be, vibrated through my skull as I passed through my hometown, totally blanketed by darkness, for the first time.
	
The feeling of the wind blowing through the truck’s windows, whipping my brown locks across my field of vision. It was late spring, but my hands were ice as they gripped the steering wheel.
	
The taste of shadow on my lips, chilling as death and twice as unfamiliar. I pulled the truck to the shoulder of the road right outside of the woods and I emerged, marching onto the road.
	
It was only when I reached the center of the potholes that I became aware of my absolute lack of a plan.
	
Sure, I had succeeded in traversing my neighborhood after dark. But other than that, what did this little excursion accomplish? This did nothing to prove my sanity, or that the placement of the meat was irregular. 

This did nothing but force me to stare at the grotesque piles again, internally screaming as I fell into a pit of despair and questioning. 
	
Suddenly, I was a child again, and I feared my mother’s wrath were she to awaken and discover my transgression.
	
Cursing my aimless actions and my vain attempt to find some crumb, some inkling of conformation that my memory and mind were not failing me, I began stomping back to my parked vehicle. My thoughts of potholes and mysterious black trucks were quelled by the post-adrenaline clarity and compressed into a sigh.

I was halfway to my truck when the road started shaking.

Not in the way that it would have if a massive trailer truck had been barreling down it. This shaking was more akin to an earthquake, only, it wasn’t happening anywhere else but the road.

In a blind panic, I made a mad dash for the truck, where the shaking looked to be either less severe or nonexistent. It was difficult to tell with my teeth chattering and my vision blurring, the rumbling so severe that I felt on the verge of unconsciousness.

My legs tangled around each other and the road threw me into itself, knocking the air out of my lungs and sending a brutal pain shooting up my spine and into my skull. 

I tried to curse, to alleviate the pain with a string of profanities, but the words wouldn’t come. I could only muster tears, and the resolve to army crawl to the unshaking space beside my parked truck.

I felt a trickle of blood snake down my face, but whether it had emerged from my nose or my mouth I could not discern. The dirt, tears and blood all converged into a hellish concoction that caked my face and added furth horror to this sensory experience.

As the road's eruption finally, mercifully ceased, I struggled and failed to push myself up onto all fours, collapsing onto my stomach in the muddy grass.

That’s when it appeared. 

The thing that had caused all of this inexplicable madness. The thing that had made my little community fear the night for decades. The thing that my Uncle Bruno had referred to as “The Beast”.

What I saw before me that chilly spring night was…indescribable. My mind could not fathom what it was witnessing then, and I still can’t fully muster the words to properly describe it. 

However, I will make an attempt. An attempt to describe something that, logically, could not exist.

The cloud had hundreds of what looked to be antlers emerging from every side of it, the only immediately recognizable features in its black, smokey mass. It stood on a thousand limbs, each with a thousand individual joints that snapped and popped with every minute shift in movement. It had no limbs. It hovered in utter, bone-chilling silence. It had the porcelain face of a screaming baby. It had no face at all. 

The road beneath it was still concrete, but it flowed like a gelatinous river. It blinked and gasped for air, covered in eyes and orifices while somehow still completely smooth. Cartilage nails and stringy hairs seemed to protrude from the road in some places. 

It was as if The Beast, and anything that it touched, operated at a lower frame rate than the world around it, yet it was moving faster than my mind could keep up with.

As desperate as I was to get away, to thrust myself into the truck, to scream, vomit and cry out for my mother to come save me--I couldn’t. My legs and vocal cords were paralyzed and unable to function. All of my survival instincts fled from my mind, and I was left on the side of the road panting, tears streaming down my paralyzed cheeks.

Then it saw me. 

The Beast lumbered forward, each step resounding with the sound of a thousand misshapen joints violently cracking as they shifted into a less and less perceivable figure. It flowed and gurgled, its millions of bloodshot eyes laser focused on my broken form. I could've sworn it was a childish malice that decorated some of its nonexistent faces, but looking back, I don’t think The Beast’s demeanor changed at all. Not visibly, anyway.

It lurched, it floated, it shifted, it swam; all at once, all in an effort to reach my trembling form.

And somehow, it had been right in front of me the entire time.

To attempt to describe the fear that I felt in that moment would be a disservice to you, the reader, if you're expecting to walk away from this story with an adequate understanding of the horror that I endured. 

The world was ending around me and I could do nothing but gaze on, my eyes pried open and my hands firmly rooted into the mud.

I was sprawled out on the concrete for what felt like years, petrified in the intensifying gaze of a being that I knew I could never dream of understanding. Questions like, “what is it?” and “what does it want?” seemed irrelevant. You can’t understand something when its very existence goes against every law of the universe. You can’t reason with it. 

It simply is.

After the initial shock and terror, the central emotion that The Beast conjured within me was guilt.

Guilt that I would dare endure another day upon a plane of existence in which this thing could manifest, and guilt that I would not do anything to stop it. Utter guilt and staggering horror at the idea of the mind-numbing complacency that would be required to ever live another day so close to such an unspeakable, unmistakable evil.

Was the world simply, irrevocably cursed? Would my continued existence, were I to survive this encounter, merely perpetuate the doomed nature of the world?

I felt the hot air eminenting from The Beast caress my mind as it’s shattered pieces melted. 

I think The Beast licked my face. I’m not sure how it could have, since it didn’t have a tongue, but it still somehow managed to coat my cheeks in a layer of thick, chunky slobber, a color that I couldn’t identify.

The Beast retracted from me within the slowest instant imaginable. 

The fog contracted and expanded, in a twisted sort of labor. The road began swirling, faster and faster until I could barely watch without nausea taking over. 

I think I vomited, but it could’ve just been the slobber trailing down my face.

The Beast let out a tremendous, silent wail as its lips opened, emerging from the ground and encircling the potholes. Its lips caressed the curdled, repulsive rotten slabs of fatty meat in a slow, wet imitation of eating.

The speed of the swirling increased more and more, devouring the meat, the cloud, the road, the world.

There was only blackness for a moment.

When I opened my eyes and lifted my face from the delicate blades of grass, I saw a completely ordinary road before me. No Beast, no fog, no spinning, no reality-bending phenomena.

No meat.

Just a shit-ton of empty potholes, drawing the moonlight into them like a constellation of dying stars.


I don’t have much of a memory of the subsequent return home. I know that I got back into the truck and silently pulled into the driveway. I know that I crept past my mother’s bedroom, up the stairs, and into my bed. I don’t think I even bothered to get underneath the covers.

I used my inability to fall asleep to cry, to shiver, and to wallow in ceaseless contemplation. 

This is a nightmare, and I’ll wake up any minute now. 

How the hell can I just lay here while that thing is still out there? 

Maybe this will all go away if I ignore it. 

How could I be so damn complacent? 

Uncle Bruno, if you can hear me, please help. Oh, God, please help. 

This is real. This is fucking real and everyone is in serious danger. 

Goddammit, is nothing really all I can do? 

I need to tell someone. Anyone…that’s the least I can do. 
	
The tears were drenching my hands by the time I was shattered by realization.
	
Everybody already knows.

My body ceased its trembling as I drew my hands away from my face, meeting the full moon with my gaze.

Mrs. Selena…Mom…oh God, Uncle Bruno…they all knew. They had to. The curfew, the meat…

Fuck, how many years? How many decades did they keep going along with whatever new rule they needed to to appease The Beast? And what for? Protection? Coexistence? Why the hell would they want to coexist with it? 
	
I considered getting up to write this all down at that very moment, to throw my testimony into the wind and succumb to the blind hope that someone on some paranormal forum would tell me exactly what I had experienced and what I could possibly do about it. 
	
But I felt a sharp pain tugging at my eyelids, and, deciding to find a subreddit on which to confess my experience the next morning, I prayed that the inevitable migraine would force me into a merciful slumber. 

And forgiveness. I also prayed for forgiveness.
	
As the sting behind my eyes surged into agony and the tears on my cheeks began to evaporate, I teetered on the edge of sleep as my thoughts ferried me into a somber, dreamless unconsciousness.
	
Maybe I was wrong. 

About all of this. 

Maybe they’ve always filled the potholes with meat.
	
Maybe they always will.
