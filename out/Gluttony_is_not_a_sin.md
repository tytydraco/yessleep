Trigger warning: Blasphemy

“It's been a while, Joan. I was starting to think you don't need therapy anymore.”

Joan looked at me like she'd just smelled sour milk. She clearly didn't think she did. I was surprised when my secretary told me she was here. I considered her one of my greatest successes as a therapist.

“I don't,” she replied forcefully. “You've really helped me a lot the last three years. I'm a more confident, less fearful person than I was when we started. But, I've been having these dreams. About THE ENTITY.”

“The entity?”

She nodded.

“Yes. You have to say it with your whole chest, though. THE ENTITY. It's disrespectful not to.”

“Right. THE ENTITY.”

“Yes. Always say it like that. I've learned a lot about higher powers this month. While talking to THE ENTITY. They're very particular about how they're addressed.”

“Of course. These dreams you've been having about THE ENTITY, you believe they are real?”

“I know they're real.”

“Have you been taking your medication, Joan?”

“Yes! I! Have!”

“No need to get testy,” I said quickly. She was glaring at me. The question had come out less tactfully than I'd hoped, but she’d had issues with being around other people before, not delusions or hallucinations. Whatever this was, it was new.  I added, “I was just asking. Tell me more about THE ENTITY.”

She sighed. I could tell this wasn't easy for her. No one was forcing her to be here so it had to be important for her to share it.

“It talks to me,” she said. “ Tells me things. I... I don't think I can handle all it's telling me on my own. That's why I came to talk to you.”

“That's what I'm here for.”

“I don't know where to start.”

“Is it good? Bad? Evil?”

“Those terms don't really apply to THE ENTITY. It has no equal. Nothing in all realities comes close. The often used example of a human taking a walk and unknowingly trampling hundreds of ants, ending them, is closer to the gods in relation to us. The gods would be the ants in relation to THE ENTITY.”

I looked at her silently. Sometimes it helped to respond with silence when patients made extraordinary claims. She didn't flinch.

I said, “Now that you've got that bit of blasphemy out the way. Are your dreams affecting your sleep?”

“No. They can be unsettling, but I rarely wake up screaming.”

“I see. You only see THE ENTITY in your dreams?”

“Yes.”

“So it's in your head?”

Her face twitched. I was off my game today. I'm usually more sympathetic with my patients.

She said, “I told you it's real!”

I nodded softly. “Where is it?”

“To tell you where it is, I'd have to give you perspective.”

“I'm all ears.”

She took a breath to compose herself then said, “We live here, on Earth.”

“ Last I checked, yes.”

“And the Earth is just one of eight planets in our solar system. There are also dwarf planets, asteroids, moons, and comets.”

“Yes.”

“And our solar system is just one of billions, hundreds of billions of star systems in our galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy.”

“Yes.”

“And the Milky Way Galaxy is just one of two trillion galaxies in our observable universe. All with billions of star systems of their own.”

“Yes.”

“And our observable universe is just three percent of our entire universe, with light from all the galaxies we can't see never having reached us since the birth of our universe.”

“I don't know if that's scientifically proven. Did THE ENTITY tell you that?”

“Stay with me, doc. We'll get to THE ENTITY.”

“Okay. Go on.”

“Our universe, in it's entirety is held in a locket worn by GOD, THE MAN UPSTAIRS. HE, capitalized H and E, lives in the realm of the infinite gods.”

Again, I took a second to just look at her. There was certainty in her eyes. Certainty in a belief I was sure no one else believed.

“Infinite?” I asked.

She nodded. “Yes. If you started counting them today, you'd still be counting when our universe dies, trillions of years from now.”

“I know what infinite means. I just thought there was only the one.”

She smiled. Her eyes were intently focused on me. She had no doubts about what she had just said.

“Of course you did, doc,” she uttered. “If it makes you feel better, you don't have to acknowledge the others if you don't want to.  Anyway, when addressing HIM, all the letters should be capitalized, to show respect. HE sends everyone who does it differently straight to hell. No exceptions.”

My turn to nod. “I'll pray for forgiveness and do it correctly from now on.”

“You should. THE ENTITY tells me hell is not a nice place. And also, the locket worn by GOD is not unique, all the other gods have them, all with universes of their own. So there's a multiverse, of sorts. GOD'S locket is special however, for three reasons. Very few of the infinite gods have created universes with such perfect physical laws that they remain stable for billions of years. Even fewer have created ones where galaxies can form without immediately collapsing in on themselves. And, only three of the infinite gods have created universes so perfect that conditions are just right not just for life, but sentient life, like us. They are, GOD, aka THE MAN UPSTAIRS, THE LORD ALMIGHTY. After eons of hard work, HE was so impressed with HIS creation that HE made the only sentient beings in HIS universe, us, flawed, not perfect, just to spice things up.

“The Goddess, She insists on the first letter of Her name always being capitalized; She, Her, The Queen. Her universe is full of sentient life, but none of them are close to our level. And lastly, The Buddha. He's the only human to ever ascend to the realm of the gods. He's a very chill god. He doesn't care how you write his name, or even if you mispronounce it. The point is you tried, that's all he cares about.”

“This is a lot of information.”

Her brow furrowed. “You tired, doc? Need a break? Wanna take a walk to clear your thoughts? Calm your nerves?”

“Believe it or not, Joan, I'm also a person. This is a lot of information to take in all at once. I'm struggling to keep up. But I'm still listening.”

She looked at me, perplexed. As if surprised a therapist could admit a weakness. Some of my clients think I'm superhuman. It’s often advantageous in my line of work. It's easier for people to look for help from someone they think is infallible. But I've found it can calm them down quickly to give them a dose of reality. And Joan needed to calm down.

“Good,” she said uncertainly. She looked at the floor for a moment.

“Continue,” I said.

Her eyes regained their focus when she looked back at me. She felt she had to tell someone about this. She nodded to herself then said, “Okay. The other gods are jealous of the three. Worst among them, lucifer, satan, the devil. All his names must always be written in lowercase, for maximum disrespect. His universes are always the laziest, most pathetic of all. So he plots against the greatest, that of THE MAN UPSTAIRS, GOD. He plots especially against us, humans, GOD'S greatest creation. No other god has ever created anything that comes close to our level of intelligence and self awareness. So satan wants to destroy us. GOD is his superior in every way, all satan’s plots have failed. So far. Anyway, the realm of the infinite gods is held inside a telekinetic ball powered by THE ENTITY.”

“Finally. What does THE ENTITY look like?”

She shrugged. “I don't know. I only see the space around it in my dreams. I'm not meant to see it. THE ENTITY is the first being, the first consciousness,  the first intelligence, created by none, creator of all. It is all knowing, all seeing, omnipresent. Not  even the gods can comprehend it's true size. And it speaks to me in my dreams.”

“What does THE ENTITY say?”

“It says lot of things. I’m aware of the privileged position I'm in that I'm receiving it's wisdom. It has told me that The Buddha had it right. Food is the simplest form of happiness. Other things that can bring happiness are too fleeting and unreliable. THE ENTITY tells me to eat; cake, pie, fries, burgers, steaks.”

“I noticed you've gained a few pounds since I last saw you. I thought it wise not to mention it. Eating is good for everyone, but I don't think we should overindulge.”

Joan smiled, shaking her head. “That's what THE MAN UPSTAIRS says. But HE's got it wrong. THE ENTITY says we shouldn't deny ourselves our sustenance. If you eat cake and ice cream all day, everyday, you'll be happy all the time. And perpetual happiness brings enlightenment. Look where The Buddha ended up.”

“I thought he reached enlightenment after years of intense meditation.”

“That was just half of it, the other half was delicious food. THE ENTITY told me. You should try it.”

I pretended to consider it. To be honest the idea wasn't unappealing. My lunchtime meals tend to be on the healthy side, often unappetizing. A nice treat every now and then couldn't hurt.

“I'll tell my secretary to order me a whole bag of chocolate chip cookies for lunch.”

“And?”

“And? There are twenty cookies in the bag.”

“Yes. And?”

“And... a packet of marshmallows, two hot dogs, and five slices of avocado toast.”

Joan beamed at me. “That's the spirit. I see a smile on your face. It's already working.”

I laughed. I really was going to try. Just for today. “Indeed,” I said. “But you said THE ENTITY told you something unsettling.”

Joan’s mood soured. She nodded. “Yes. THE ENTITY also told me that, the devil will eventually succeed.”
