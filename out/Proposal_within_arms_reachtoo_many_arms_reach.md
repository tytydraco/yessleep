For Christmas this year, my boyfriend Eric booked us a one-week trip to New York City. The moment I saw the tickets, I was *certain* he was going to propose on the trip. Before you tell me I'm delulu for assuming, bare in mind that we had talked about marriage and proposals and the hows and wheres, and whether I wanted something public, with family, etc. He'd asked my ring size a few months back, and we'd gone to a jewelry store once or twice to look at designs. Point being, my theory didn't come out of nowhere. I am not delulu. I'm scared witless, and if you read on, I'll explain why, but I promise you that I'm of sound mind and body.

We arrived in NYC two days ago, and I'm currently writing this from the airport as we wait to board the first plane that'll get us the hell out of dodge 5 days early.

All this because of what happened last night.

So, we're out late-ish. About 11 pm. We'd just eaten an amazing meal at a nice restaurant, and Eric suggests we take a stroll through Central Park. I am more than happy to walk off all the food I just scarfed down. We're maybe 20 minutes into the walk when we come across this beautiful horsedrawn carriage shimmering in the ray of a streetlight up ahead. It's got a polished black frame, red velvet seats, two pure white horses, and gilded details giving it that extra sense of class. It *looks* like it's meant for us. We can't *not* ride it, right? I'm giddy at the thought and try to meet Eric's gaze to see if he's thinking the same thing I am. Before I can even speak, he's already flagging it down and I get tingles in my stomach.

I suddenly realize this might be *it*. My final moments before the big proposal.

I'm thinking it's not a coincidence we came across the carriage: maybe Eric planned it. Maybe he called ahead while I was in the bathroom or I don't know, maybe it was planned weeks ago. Either way, I'm so excited that I do this weird little shuffle forward where I'm trying to both run and slow down at the same time because I want to savor every moment. Eric fixes my deregulated pace by taking my hand gently into his. I laugh apologetically.

"You're such a dork," he tells me.

"Yup! And that's why you love me," I reply.

"Yes, I do." He squeezes my hand and looks deep into my eyes. "Like a brother."

"ERIC!"

He burst out laughing and helps me into the carriage.

There's a plaid blanket on a little shelf in front of us which he pulls over us, and I try VERY HARD *not* to imagine how many people have used it and how much dirt must be on it. I mean, the rest of the carriage is clean, so maybe they swap out blankets between rides? That's what I'm hoping for, at least.

I finally become cognisant of the driver. I think I was too distracted with all the bells and whistles to realize he was sitting there in front, you know? But the way it happened, he could just as easily have popped into existence in that moment and I would've been none the wiser. Anyways, from my angle, I mostly just see salt-and-pepper hair peeking out from under his top hat and a few heavy wrinkles on his face. He's wearing a black cloak, long coat, and thick leather gloves.

"Mmm?" the driver hums, in a way we both interpret as asking if we're ready.

"Yes." "Yup!" we answer.

He tugs the reins, and the carriage lurches forward, sending Eric and I deeper into the seat. We snuggle up. I wrap both my arms around Eric's left arm and rest my head on his shoulder. He's warm despite the cold outside. Am I using him as my own personal heater? Maaaaaaaybe. Either way, we are happy and cozy as the sights pass us by, and it feels like nothing could ever go wrong. In hindsight, I hate myself for thinking that, because it almost feels like I caused what happened next somehow.

I'm enjoying myself, but the driver's a bit weird. He's always looking over his shoulder at us with his aged, milky-blue eyes, but never says anything. I can't quite put my finger on why it bothers me so much, but it's almost like it's an expectant look? It's not quite voyeuristic, but it *feels* wrong. I try not to return his gaze and just smile politely whenever he does it. Like, I'm thinking he's probably just checking on us to make sure he’s not going too fast, and maybe after a long day at work, he can't bring himself to look friendly while doing so. Or maybe he just has a resting bitch face.

We hit a bump in the road, and I adjust myself, squeezing Eric's arm in the process.

That's when things go wrong.

Suddenly, Eric gets strangely agitated and asks the driver to stop. I'm thinking he's got motion sickness, but he's not trying to cover his mouth or anything. He's just shouting, "Stop! Stop! Stop the carriage!"

The driver doesn't even slow down.

Now, let me preface this by saying my boyfriend does **not** scare easily, and I don't say that lightly. The only time I've ever seen the look of genuine fear in his eyes was the night his mom got in a car crash. It was touch and go for a bit, but she made it out alright in the end. I will *never* forget what he looked like that night. So, to see that look again, I *knew* it had to be serious, and I got scared by proxy. In one quick motion, he scoops me up and slides across the seat to my end of the carriage. It happened *so fast* that I honest-to-goodness did not even register half of what happened. Like, one second, he's freaking out, the next, I feel him slide us, and then it skips to me staggering forward already out of the carriage, trying to catch myself so I don't fall on the concrete. I...I guess he hoisted me out of the carriage? I feel his fist wrap around the back of my coat and catch me mid-fall like a bungee cord. I look back and he's taking a giant step to stabilize himself.

The carriage storms away, the driver looking back only once. He does this weird, open-mouthed hiss, and I swear, I don't see a tongue.

Mind you, he leaves without getting paid. Then again, if I'm right and my boyfriend planned this, then he must’ve pre-paid? I've got so many thoughts going through my head at once. You know when people say their mind is "reeling"? I finally understand what that means. Like, I'm partially worried about paying for the carriage, worried about Eric, wondering if maybe this is part of the show and whether this was *the* spot Eric wanted to propose at? But you don't throw someone out of a carriage to propose. That's insane behavior! And the "perfect spot" would *not* be right next to an overflowing trash bin like where we're at now. And, like, I'm thinking there's nothing particularly scenic around us, you know? And what about payment? And the drive?! Did he not have a tongue? Did I see that right? And holy shit, I almost just fell on concrete and I could've cracked my head open and...and...and–!!!

Breathe.

I...I take a breath.

I try to get my bearings.

It's okay. I'm alive. Eric's alive. Everything is fine.

Eric looks...bothered. Like BOTHERED-bothered. He's shaken. More than I am.

"What the hell happened back there?!" I ask. My tone is harsh even though I don't mean it to be. I think it's the adrenaline talking for me.

Like, I *know* this isn't normal. I know he wouldn't've done this without a good reason. And he...well, he's still silent. He's got a hand over his mouth and this look of shock on his face. I approach. I try very hard to calm down and I take his hands. I wish I could feel his body heat through our gloves, but I can't.

"Are you okay?" I finally ask, and I feel selfish for not doing so sooner. "Eric?"

His name seems to snap him out of it. He mumbles, "The arms."

"What?"

"I-I-I counted the arms."

I'm *so* confused I could puke. "What are you talking about?"

I usher him towards a bench because the way his legs are shaking, I'm afraid they'll give out at any moment. He doesn't say anything else for a few, long, agonizing minutes. It's killing me because I REALLY need to know what the hell happened. I want to know what the hell he's on about, but I also don't want to push him too hard. Are we in imminent danger or not?

Finally, his bubble of adrenaline deflates. His shoulders loosen.

"You were holding my arm," he says, eyes downcast, "like you are now."

Yeah, I'm sitting to his left with both my arms wrapped in a bear hug around his. Earlier, I was doing it to cuddle and steal his body heat. Right now, I'm doing it to comfort him.

I nod.

"But you had an arm around my shoulders," he says.

"No, I..."

"I know."

It starts to sink in, bit by bit. He counted the arms. He had an arm around his shoulders. It wasn't mine. I feel a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. Dread pulls me in like gravity while simultaneously making my head float like there is none. I squeeze him. Right now, we're each other’s anchors, keeping one another steady in shifting gravity.

I can't remember the exact words, but he explains to me, finally, what happened. He was distracted. I was right about him planning to propose that evening. On the carriage ride, he was rehearsing what he was going to say in his head. Eric wanted to get it *just* right. Then, at some point, I squeezed his arm and he realized that something was *off*. He counted. Two arms around his left. One arm on his shoulders. At first, he was *just* confused. It didn't make sense. But then, he inspected that extra arm.

"It was pale," he says, "Almost blue. The nails were white, but the tips were black like there was dirt or blood under them. I thought. I thought there was a body in the back, and it got loose. And the driver did it. And we were next."

This was when, from my perspective, he'd started freaking out.

"But then, I asked the driver to stop, and, and, and–" The look of fear returned to his face.

My stomach was twisting itself into knots. I squeezed him. "And what?"

"It grabbed me."

To say those words chilled me would be an understatement. They poured over me like a bucket of ice water in sub-zero temperatures. I couldn't fully grasp the implications at the time. It's easy to say what you'd do if you were in that kind of a situation, but the truth is, you never REALLY know how you'll react. It's crazy what shock will do to your brain. It's like your head's a snow globe and someone just shook the living hell out of it, and you have to wait for the snow to settle before you can finally think straight. Even then, there's this, like, fog that lingers. It's something that's hard to describe to someone who hasn't experienced it. It's like your body's trying to calm you down so it's trying to make you act and feel 'normal' even though the situation is anything but. The thought that it was a hypothermic victim reaching out for help never occurred to me until much, much later. If you think that's where this is going, you, and the slightly more aware version of myself, are both wrong.

That thought came about an hour later. Eric and I are wandering around Central Park aimlessly. Neither of us mention what happened. We're both trying to cope. We come across a bridge. I...I'm not sure which one. I think it's the Greywacke Arch? It's a nice, stone-looking bridge with a tunnel going under it. It starts to snow, and despite everything, it feels like a magical moment. The snow shimmers like glitter over what should've been a perfect evening. We stop about halfway across the bridge, and my mind starts to wander. It wanders, because I see a horse-drawn carriage in the distance. There's a couple snuggled up in the back. I follow it by gaze as it comes closer. I am *barely* aware that Eric is kneeling.

I hear him talking, and I can tell it's heartfelt, but if my life depended on it, I couldn't tell you a single word he spoke. It's not that I'm unhappy he's proposing, believe me. Part of me knows I should soak it in – that I should focus on him and him alone. I force myself to look at him, at his sweet and shy smile, but all I can think about is whether there's a corpse at the back of that carriage that's coming towards the tunnel below us.

As it nears, I see a pale hand reaching from the back.

"Will you..."

And a second one.

A third.

"...marry me?"

A fourth.

A fifth.

The carriage is cresting out of view. I crane my neck to see.

There's so many. I can't count them anymore. There are too many arms. They're...they're...they're all reaching for–

"Jordan?"

I snap my attention back to Eric, who's still on one knee. This should be the happiest moment of my life. I try to ground myself – to enjoy the moment and take in the magical snow and the view and ignore the arms so that this becomes a happy memory I'll replay for the rest of my life, but inside, I'm wishing this had happened literally any other day. I'm...I'm upset Eric went ahead with it despite everything. I'm stunned he hadn't noticed the carriage...but then I look at him. I *really* look at him, and I see that fear in his eyes again. I see it just barely beneath the surface, and I realize he *had* spotted the carriage. This, the proposal, it's a distraction. It's him desperately trying to protect us both from what we can barely comprehend is happening. The ring is a life raft, and he's tossing it to me.

"Yes," I reply.

He springs to his feet and wraps his arms around me. Two. Just the two. A normal amount of arms. Faintly, I hear screams echo through the tunnel. His hug tightens so tight, I can barely breathe. As he sways us back and forth as though we're dancing, I watch and wait. My head's on a pivot from one side of the bridge to the other. He knows I can’t just let it go. He loosens his grip reluctantly and follows my gaze. It's weird, because I'm expecting to see incomprehensible horrors coming out of the tunnel. We pan back and forth in search.

The carriage, the arms, the couple...they never emerge.

I am never going back to New York City. There's something wrong in Central Park.
