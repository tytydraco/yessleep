I locked Soy Milk in the drawer as I said I would. I rolled up an old hoodie, stuffed it around the doll, and shoved it deep enough that the drawer creaked when I closed it. Then I took an old belt and wrapped it around the handles because that was how far my logic had come.

That was about ten hours ago.

I left the apartment to clear my head. I walked aimlessly, bought a coffee I did not drink, and returned home after dark. The drawer was still closed. The belt was still in place. But something felt off; the quiet was heavier than usual.

I went to bed early, completely drained. I turned off my screens and sat in darkness with only blackout curtains and the hope that it was over.

That night I dreamed I could not move. Not in the familiar way of sleep paralysis but simply like I had been sewn into place. I felt thread pulling through my arms and my chest, gently tightening me until I was completely still. My mouth was set and my jaw ached, while my fingers felt as if they had been stuffed with cotton.

When I woke up, I noticed red indentations across my hands. Three faint lines trailed from my palm to the tip of my middle finger as if something had tugged from beneath my skin.

That was this morning.

I did not hesitate. I pulled Soy Milk from the drawer, still bundled in the hoodie, and dropped it into a shoebox. I zip-tied the lid and then duct-taped it securely. I shoved the whole thing into the closet and sat on the kitchen floor, watching the empty space until the sun came up.

When I checked the box again, the zip ties were intact. The tape was undisturbed. However, the doll was not inside.

It was in the microwave. Balanced upright, right where I had been staring.

I did not scream or even swear. I just laughed until my voice cracked. It was as if I had reached a point where the horror became absurd.

By noon, I posted on a local collectibles board: “Unboxed Macaron variant, free to a good home. Pickup only.”

I received a reply in under twenty minutes. The user had no profile picture and no name, only a message:

> “I have been looking for that one.”



I left the doll on a bench in the park down the street. I placed it in a paper bag with no note and watched from a distance until someone picked it up and walked away without a glance.

I returned home. I slept.

That was a few hours ago. I feel oddly light tonight, as if I had been holding tension in parts of me I never knew existed. I ate for the first time in a day. I did not check the drawer. I did not feel the urge.

But just now, as I write this, I opened my camera roll to review the last photo I took during my walk. There was a picture I do not remember taking.

It is blurry and dark, shot from a low angle, and it shows my bed from a perspective I have never seen. In that image, I am lying down, facing away from the camera, and smiling in my sleep.

I live alone.

I am not sure what it means. I thought I had passed it on for good. But now the silence speaks otherwise.
