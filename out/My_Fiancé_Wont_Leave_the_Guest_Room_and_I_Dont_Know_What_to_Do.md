Looking to buy a home is its own special kind of Hell.

Between a fairly limited (tiny) budget, predatory real estate companies, and a healthy amount of flat out lies on website listings, you can imagine me and my fiance, Hailey’s, surprise when we came across a listing that was, by most metrics, a dream home.

It was a two story home near downtown. It was within walking distance to grocery stores, gas stations, restaurants and bars. It was almost perfectly in-between both of our jobs, and within 15 minutes of each to boot. We shouldn't have even been allowed to set eyes on a house like this, but it was well within our pitiful price range.

We met with an agent who showed us the home. For a house built over a century ago, it was in remarkable shape. It was decorated with antiques, the walls were lined with paintings, portraits, and photographs of the original owners.

I was the one who asked why it was so cheap. I'll give you the SparkNotes:

The original owners sold it about a decade after it was built, with no listed reason. The new owners owned it for the next 45 years, and those guys were the town lunatics. At the end of their tenure — which ended when the youngest, and final tennant, hung himself in the guest room — the house was sold to a real estate company, who tried to remodel it. Plans for the remodel never went through, and instead were pivoted to be a simple renovation. Around 1970, the house finally sold again to another man. He lived there until he passed away in 2012, the house has remained unoccupied since.

"So, in short," the realtor said at the end of his story. "It's probably haunted."

It was a good story, Hailey said it'd be fun to tell people once we started inviting guests over. We started signing papers that day.

We were moved in after a few weeks, and the first two months were domestic bliss.

We did away with a lot of the original decorations. We kept some of the old paintings up — who was I to turn down free fine art? — but took down most of the photographs and antiques. A few we managed to sell off, others we donated, a couple of the real nice ones we put in our attic. Over time, we replaced it with our stuff, posters and photos we had brought from our old apartment.

After a while, it started to feel like *our* home.

Of all the rooms in the house, the one we used the least was our guest room. We hadn’t even bothered to remove the mattress or desk that had been in the room when we purchased the house, in fact, all we had done in the room since we had moved in was poke our head in, look around a little, and then shut the door. To be honest, I had almost forgotten about it until one day, about two months into living there, my fiancé asked about it.

I was sitting on our couch, watching TV, when my Hailey came to me, a confused look on her face that I had rarely seen before.

"Have you heard scratching from the guest room?"

Now, me and Hailey had always enjoyed playing jokes on each other. Always harmless, and usually in good spirits. Once, I gave her a bag of Spicy Sweet Chili Doritos, which she doesn't like, only for the bag to be filled with Cool Ranch chips, which are her favorite. One year on my birthday, she handed me a copy of Barbie Horse Adventures on the PS2, only for the disc to be for Red Dead Redemption 2, which I had been asking for. At the time, it was easy to assume she was just joking.

I decided to play along, “Yeah, must’ve been the rats I’m fostering. Did I forget to feed them this morning?” 

She half smiled, but said, "No, Lisa, I'm serious. I thought I heard something."

At that, I paused my show and got up, Lisa followed me to the guest room. It looked like it did last time I had poked my head in, a month and a half ago. 

I made a point to check everything while she watched from the doorway. If this was one of her jokes, the punchline was probably hidden somewhere, part of me thought it might be a cat; I \*had\* been talking about wanting one. 

But, to my surprise, the room was completely empty. No hidden cats, no fostered rats, nothing. Hailey seemed even more confused.

I told her that maybe it was a rat, rodents like that could get into pretty much anywhere, and could hide easily. It wouldn't have surprised me if there were some rats already living there that no one had noticed, or that moved in during the interim. I offered to call an exterminator, which she agreed to.

The exterminator came the next day while me and Hailey were at work and gave the house a complete look over, but couldn’t find any evidence of a rodent problem. I decided that whatever had scratched on the door had simply found another way out, and was off on whatever adventures rats went on.

Hailey wasn’t entirely convinced by it, but she acquiesced.

Over the next couple of weeks, I tried to keep an ear out for anything coming from the guest room. I was still convinced rats were getting in somehow, I even bought some rat poison that I sprinkled on the outside of the house, just in case, but I never noticed any fuzzy little corpses showing up around our home.I think I might have accidentally killed a squirrel though. Sorry, little guy.

This all came to a head yesterday, I was able to get off from work a few hours earlier than normal and went home, only to see Hailey's car in the driveway. In the three years we had been together, Hailey had gotten off early from work exactly two times, and they were both on Christmas.

I called for her when I entered, and she called my name from the guest room. She sounded frantic, scared even.

The room looked like it had been ransacked, with Hailey in the middle of the mess.

"Hailey, what the hell-" When she turned, the look on her face held the next words in place. It was a look of worry — of fear — I had never seen before, and it broke my heart in a way I can't really describe.

"I heard someone." She said, some\*one\*, not some\*thing\*. It was around then I noticed the kitchen knife she was holding, and I reflexively took a step back. She looked like she was about to cry.

I had a lot of questions, a LOT, but for some reason, the only one I could ask at the moment was, "Why are you home so early?"

She blinked a few times, fighting back the tears, and said, "I don't know."

She said it had been an impulse, and her boss didn't put up any objections. She said she heard a voice whisper "Hi" as she walked past the guest room, grabbed the knife, and started turning the room over. 

I held out my hand and asked her to hand over the knife, which she did, slightly reluctantly. I told her she should go lie down, and she agreed. I held her close as we walked back to our room.

When I knew she was asleep, I called a plumbing company and scheduled them to come out to check for a gas leak — my new working theory. When Hailey woke up from her nap, I suggested we go stay at her sister's house for a few days. She agreed, we packed, and drove to the other side of the city to stay with Hailey's sister.

We were asleep on the couch, Hailey cuddled on top of me, she started moving. The clock on the wall said it was 3 AM, and Hailey was putting on her sandals.

"What's wrong?" I asked, still 3/4ths asleep.

"I wanna go home."

I didn't really process what she had said at first, and asked, "What?" 

"I just... I don't want to be away for too long. What if it really was something? It could be hiding there right now."

I was half asleep now, and a little annoyed. "Babe, it'll be fine. The plumber will be out tomorrow to fix the gas leak, we can go back Friday." I motioned for her to come back as I made myself comfortable.

"What gas leak?"

I realized I probably shouldn't have said that. I sat back up, now fully awake. "I thought it might be, you know, a gas leak. I called a plumber to check."

She looked mad at that. "What? You think I'm going crazy?"

"No!" I said, hoping I didn't wake up Hailey's sister. "I just don't think it can hurt to check, I don't think anyone is living in our home without us knowing, babe."

She still looked upset, but it was softening. I motioned for her again. "Come back to bed, we can go in the morning if you want." 

She nodded, but didn't get back on the couch couch with me. She took a seat on the love seat next to it and said, "I wanna sleep here tonight, okay?"

I reluctantly said okay, adjusted myself one last time, and went back to sleep.

This morning, Hailey's sister woke me up, asking if I knew where Hailey was.

I got up in a panic and ran outside to our car, but it was gone. I ran back to her sister's apartment and told her to drive me back to our house. She agreed, confused, but willing enough.

A few minutes into the drive, we hit traffic. After a while of uncomfortable silence, I said, "Hey, Cara. Do you know if Hailey has any sort of history with... mental illness, or anything like that?"

Cara shook her head. "No, not that I know about. Why? Think she's going crazy?"

I thought about our conversation earlier that morning, and my heart panged. Less than 5 hours had passed, and I was already making a liar of myself. 

"She's been acting... weird since we moved in. She left work early a few weeks ago."

"What?" Cara asked with genuine surprise.

I nodded. "I know, and she woke up in the middle of the night trying to go home. I thought it might be a gas leak, but..."

"I see what you mean." She said solemnly.

We finished the drive in silence. When we got there, the car was in the driveway. The front door was wide open. I hadn't been called by the company yet, so I figured they hadn’t made it out yet. A part of me thought that was a good thing, it meant backup might be there soon. The term 'backup' made me disgusted with myself.

We got out of the car, I took point as we entered. Cara called out for Hailey, no answer. I called out, nothing. I didn't need her to answer to know where she was though.

"Come on," I said. "She's in the guest room."

"How do you know?"

"I know." I led us upstairs, stopping in front of the door. 

I checked the door knob, it was unlocked, but I was reluctant to open it. I knocked gently. "Babe?"

There was a long moment of silence, before she responded with a weak, "Yes?"

"Is everything alright?"

"Yeah," she said, she sounded dazed. "I'm fine."

"Can you come out?"

"No thanks."

I took a step back, Cara looked from me to the door. "Can we come in?"

She didn't answer for an agonizingly long time, before finally saying, "Yes."

Both of us stared at the doorknob, neither wanting to open it. It was Cara who finally did, slowly opening the door, eerily silent on its hundred year old hinges. I had expected to see the room as it was when we left, ransacked. When I could finally see inside, it was spotless. All the furniture had been moved back into place, the photos and paintings had been placed back up on the wall in their cracked or broken frames. Hailey was sitting on the foot of the bed, staring blankly at the door. 

“Babe?” I said, stepping ahead of Cara as we entered. “We should head back to Cara’s, the plumbers haven’t come by yet.”

“No.” Hailey said. “They don’t need to come.”

The pit in my stomach that had been opening since we left Cara’s apartment had finally opened wide enough to where I couldn’t ignore it. “But if it’s a gas leak, it really isn’t safe to—”

“It’s not a gas leak,” she said, looking from us to the room around her. “Not an intruder, not rats… not ghosts…” she paused for a moment. “Not really…”

“Hailey,” Cara said, her voice shaky. “What’s wrong?” 

It took a second for Hailey to look at her sister, but when she did, it was in a moment of lucidity. “Nothing.” She said, her face tightening seriously. “I promise.” She looked at me again. “I’ll come out in a little bit, okay? I just want to… be here for a while.”

Cara and I looked at each other, then I looked back at Hailey. A large part of me wanted to go to her, to hug her, to start crying and tell her I’m worried about her, but another part — smaller, but much stronger — kept me in place. “...Okay. I’ll be here when you’re ready.” I backed out, Cara slowly followed. 

I shut the door as we left, Cara looked horrified. “What the fuck?” She whispered, quickly moving away from the guest room, downstairs to the front door. “What the fuck is wrong with my sister?”

I followed her down and out of the house as she walked back to her car. “I don’t know, I…” I opened my mouth to say something, but nothing came out. 

Cara put a hand on my shoulder. I could tell she wanted to offer something, anything that might help, but she was coming to the same conclusion as me at that moment. What could we do? 

I took a deep, shaky breath. “I’ll figure something out, I promise. I’ll try to get her away from the house or…” I shrugged, I knew Cara could tell that I have no idea what I’m going to do. “It’ll be fine.” I lied.

Cara nodded, unlocking her car. “Alright, just… let me know if you need anything, okay?”

“Okay.” I say, weakly. She gets into her car and drives away.

It’s been a few hours since then, the plumbers aren’t coming out anymore. I grabbed a chair from the kitchen. I've been sitting outside the guest room, waiting for Hailey to come out. Sometimes I hear her talking, when she does, she sounds dazed and lost. I’m coming here because I really don’t know what else to do. I'm worried about my fiance and hope that maybe someone here can tell me what to do.

Please, help.
