It was supposed to be a fun camping trip, a weekend getaway to reconnect with nature and escape the noise of city life. Thomas, along with five of his closest friends—Ella, Ben, Sarah, Max, and Olivia—had set out into the dense, sprawling woods known as the Black Hollow Forest. The forest had a dark reputation, but it was nothing more than a rumor, right? Locals spoke in hushed tones about strange happenings, but Thomas laughed it off.

They hiked for hours, their laughter and chatter echoing through the trees, until they found the perfect spot beside a winding stream. A small clearing, sheltered by towering oaks, was the ideal place to set up camp. As night fell, they gathered around the fire, the flames dancing and crackling as the temperature dropped.

The conversation turned to ghost stories, each friend taking turns trying to outdo the last. Max, always the skeptic, dismissed them with a smirk. "It's all nonsense," he said, tossing another log onto the fire. "There’s no such thing as monsters."

It was at that moment they heard the first sound—a low, guttural growl that seemed to come from the depths of the woods. Everyone fell silent, eyes wide, as they listened to the unnerving noise. The sound was not like anything they had ever heard before, not an animal, nor a man. Just an inhuman growl, deep and primal.

"Maybe it's just a bear," Ben suggested, though his voice wavered.

But Thomas, despite himself, felt a chill run down his spine. He had read about the strange occurrences in these woods—the disappearances, the whispers of something unnatural lurking in the dark. But he didn’t want to admit he was afraid.

Max stood up, trying to sound confident. "I'm going to check it out. You all stay here. It’s probably just some animal."

Before anyone could protest, Max walked toward the woods, his flashlight cutting a narrow beam through the darkness. The others stayed by the fire, their voices dropping to hushed murmurs.

Minutes passed, and then the sound of snapping twigs echoed through the trees. The fire flickered wildly, casting long shadows that stretched toward the woods. And then—silence.

“Max?” Ella called out softly. No answer.

The minutes turned into what felt like hours. Finally, Thomas stood, heart pounding. “I’m going after him.”

“No,” Ben said quickly. “We stay together. Max will be back. We just need to wait.”

But the longer they sat there, the more the silence felt oppressive, almost suffocating. Then, suddenly, from the shadows beyond the trees, a figure emerged.

It was tall—unnaturally tall, its silhouette almost blending with the darkness of the forest. Its limbs were thin, yet strangely elongated, with hands that reached nearly to its knees. The creature's skin was pale, almost translucent, and its eyes glowed with an unsettling, otherworldly hue. Its head was slightly too large for its body, and its mouth was slightly open, revealing rows of sharp, jagged teeth.

Thomas froze, his breath caught in his throat. The creature’s gaze met his, and for a split second, he thought he saw recognition in its eyes, a chilling awareness. Then, the creature’s mouth opened wide in an unnatural grin.

Suddenly, the stillness was broken by a blood-curdling scream.

Ben, Sarah, and Olivia leaped to their feet, panicked, but the creature didn’t move. It only watched them with cold, dead eyes, as if savoring their fear. The air felt thick with tension. Then, in an instant, the creature shifted, its body jerking unnaturally fast toward the fire.

Chaos erupted. The friends scattered in all directions, but no matter how fast they ran, the creature was always one step ahead, its movements erratic and impossibly swift.

Thomas ran, stumbling over roots and rocks, his lungs burning, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that the creature was never far behind. He heard cries for help, desperate, but he couldn’t stop. Every step felt like it might be his last. His heart pounded in his chest, the adrenaline surging through him, but a voice in the back of his mind told him he had to get out. He had to survive.

He didn’t look back.

Minutes later, breathless and exhausted, Thomas collapsed at the edge of the forest. The moonlight bathed the clearing in an eerie glow, but there was no sign of the others, no sign of the creature. He could hear nothing but the thrum of his own heartbeat in his ears.

He dared not move, not yet, not until he was sure. Slowly, he stood, eyes scanning the forest around him, but there was no movement. No sound. The air was eerily still.

Then, from the shadows, the creature’s voice broke the silence. “Run… while you can.”

Thomas spun around. It was standing at the edge of the woods, just barely visible in the dark. Its eyes gleamed with malice, and its grin had widened even further, almost impossibly so.

Thomas’s legs shook as he took a step back. His mind screamed at him to run, but he couldn’t seem to move. He wanted to fight back, to do something, anything—but the terror rooted him to the spot.

Suddenly, the creature lunged forward. But instead of charging directly at him, it veered off to the left, as if something had distracted it. The faintest whisper of movement broke Thomas’s trance.

He turned and saw… a figure. Max.

Max was standing motionless, bloodied and pale, in the distance, his eyes wide with terror as the creature slowly began to circle him.

“Run!” Thomas screamed.

But Max didn’t move. His gaze remained locked on the creature, and with one final, agonizing scream, he fell to the ground as the creature descended upon him.

Thomas ran. He didn’t look back again, not even once. His feet carried him through the woods, through the underbrush, until the first light of dawn broke the horizon. When he finally emerged from the forest, covered in dirt and bruises, his heart still racing, he collapsed to his knees.

He was the only one left.

The authorities found him hours later, covered in blood, unable to explain what happened. There were no signs of the others, no trace of the creature. Only the wreckage of their campsite, the smoldering ashes of their fire.

As they pulled him away from the woods, Thomas could still hear the whisper in his mind: **“Run… while you can.”** The creature's voice, still lingering, just out of reach.

But there was one thing Thomas knew for sure. He’d never go back to those woods. Not for anything. Because Black Hollow wasn’t just a forest. It was a place where nightmares lived—and where people disappeared.

And no matter how far he ran, he would never escape the haunting memory of that thing in the woods.
