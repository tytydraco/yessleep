I had never gone hiking before. My friend Ezra had gotten me to join a hiking camp that would take us through the snowy mountain range of Oxbo. I’d never heard of the place, and neither did it show up on my Google search. Ezra had gotten the pamphlet from a trusty friend and was very confident in the proposal. Being a dumb teenager, I trusted him and signed myself up. 

It was a small group of fifteen, around the same age as us, alongside three older instructors. It was a quaint bunch. Ezra and I had conversations with many new people throughout our flight. When we landed in a small village at the foot of Oxbo, the instructors gathered us around. Something about them had unnerved me. Two guys and a girl, who looked….exhausted. They lacked the energy of a camp counselor, and had a heavy tone of voice. But I just shrugged it off.

Our first day of hiking was admittedly amazing. The tall pine trees, flowery shrubs littering the ground and snowy peaks in the distance served for a great view. How was this place not on Google? How had tourists not already discovered the serenity these mountains hold? We were the only people for thousands of miles around. It gave me a strange sense of calm. The mountains towered over us. Their presence felt…alive, palpable. I felt supervised, observed by them. It soon began to unsettle me. 

We had our first meal out of plastic bags, seated on the jagged rocks. The beef tasted spoilt, but I chalked it up to the weather. When we got up and started hiking again, however, I felt weak. There was a persistent ache in my limbs, and I felt like I had never eaten. I slowed down, incredibly low on energy. The protein bars I had brought with me didn’t seem to help. At one point, I stopped, hunching in exhaustion. That was when I felt a tap on my shoulder. 

It was the female instructor, her skin pale, cheeks sunken into her bones. Her eyes darkened as she said, “Never trail behind the group.”

Unnerved, I gathered my strength and marched on forward. I carried on until we stopped again. On our second break, a girl called Ava began to get sick. She threw up, and had sparked a fever. It was clear she could not continue the trail, so one of the male instructors took her back. The rest of us continued the trip. 

As we proceeded, I began to feel strangely aware of my surroundings. The emptiness of the forest caused a knot to form in my chest. I began to ponder what secrets these unknown mountains may hold. Was there truly nothing alive on this soil but us? Where had the animals gone? Did something hurt them? Anxiety began to pump through my veins.   

At the end of the day, we arrived at the base camp which overlooked Oxbo. That was where we’d be staying for the night. I watched the mountain stretch out amidst the clouds, the wind whispering in my ears. It was an enchanting sight. But a sharp fear brewed at the back of my mind. I felt watched, even though the rest of the site was empty. I couldn’t shake the feeling of something lurking on the other side of the plains. 

One of the first things we were told, as soon as we arrived at camp, was never to leave our tent alone at night. It seemed pretty straightforward to me, considering it would be very easy to get lost there. Ezra and I made a pact not to leave our shared tent throughout the nights, even to pee. The campsite would be even more dreary and unsettling in the darkness.

The freezing mountain air had us bundled up in jackets all day. Our next meal tasted funny, too, and Ezra agreed. It also failed to keep us full. My bones felt brittle, my stomach churning in hunger. It only caused my anxiety to deepen its roots. 

In the evening, we played some football, and I was almost distracted from hunger. I noticed that the instructors retreated into their tents fairly early. But the zipper of their tent was hanging open, and I could see the female’s instructors eyes boring right into mine. Even from a distance, it caused gooseflesh to rise on my skin. It felt less like they were supervising us, and more like they were….stalking us. 

I tried to call home, but there was no service throughout the campsite. The other members were facing the same issue. When we asked the instructors about it, they said they kept our parents informed. They didn’t let us call them, though. Again, it was my first time on a hiking trip, so I believed most of it was fairly normal.

On the second day, a guy named Clay developed a severely high fever. He looked worse than Ava had. He protested a little, insisting he was fine, but he had to be escorted home as well. I wondered if it was the food that was making them sick. I had not felt full for days. It was then I considered that something might be truly wrong.

It was the middle of the second night when I woke up shivering and with a painfully full bladder. The feeling could not be held off any longer- I needed to pee, immediately. The tightness of the tent was making me claustrophobic. Sweat was pooling under my layers, but I felt freezing. I squinted through the darkness and poked Ezra in the shoulder, attempting to wake him. 

“What?” He croaked out, blinking his eyes open.

“I need to pee,” I whispered.

He groaned, and fell back onto his sleeping bag with a thump. “I’m not going with you,”

“Please,” I begged, squeezing my legs together.

“Just hold it in,” He drawled, already half-asleep.

Prodding him again did not serve me well. The fullness of my bladder, the unforgiving cold and my own sleepiness weighed heavily on my mind— and so I made a decision. I decided to brave the mountains on my own. I fished out my head torch from my bag, adjusted the buckles, and turned it on. With a shaky sigh, I unzipped the tent and stepped out on the grass.

I’ve never been scared of darkness before, but this caused a pit to form in my stomach. It crept through the site, blurring the spaces between the trees. It was intense and obscuring. A single trail of light, emanating from my torch, was cutting through it-- rendering visibility only two feet in front of me. But the rest of the plains seemed invisible. 

I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching me from its depths.

The silence was daunting. It was the kind of silence found in forests just before a predator arrives. It was a silence of apprehension, just waiting to be filled by something bad. It filled my ears. The feeling of being watched did not dissipate, and fear ran like poison through my blood. 

Balling my fists tightly, I stepped through the grassy soil. The sound of my own breathing rang heavily in my ears. My heart rammed against my chest, my fingers growing numb. My teeth clattered with cold. It took a lot of effort to find the small pits that had been dug up after our arrival. 

I did my business, feeling a ripple of relief. The events of the past two days darted through my mind. Is it normal for a mountain to be so deserted, so barren of wildlife? Only pine trees stretched across and beyond my vision. Even the flowers thinned out as we climbed higher. There was definitely something about this mountain.

When I was done, I filled up the pit and searched for my way back. Right away, I realised I didn’t remember where I had come from. I groaned in annoyance.  I walked back, looking around for any signs of our campsite. The limited view from the torch set me back greatly. My legs were weak, and it was difficult to walk through the rocky path.

There was a rustle in the grass.

The blood froze in my veins. My breaths were short and raspy, and I looked around. The limited light was not enough— the darkness was too vast, the place too empty, too many places for someone to be hiding. The sound kept ringing in my ears, and my throat felt tight. I stood there for a moment, attempting to gain my composure.

There was a bitter taste in my mouth. At every step I stopped and glanced back. I couldn’t stop feeling like something was following me, and at any moment its claws would scrape against my skin. I walked slowly, trying to find my way back. 

And then I saw it. A distant, human-like figure, nestled in the corner of my vision. 

There was an ache deep in my gut. My neck had locked into place, beads of sweat rolling down my temple. The figure stood there, twitching, but stable. My legs had frozen in place. I was gripped by the desire to run away, but I feared it would startle the creature. In order to take a closer look, I took a cautious step forward. 

The smell of rotten flesh was overpowering. I scrunched my nose as I took in its form. Panic seized my heart. It looked like a human, but its flesh was tattered beyond repair. The gashes seemed animalistic. Pieces of skin hung from its chest, which moved sporadically up and down with each hoarse breath. Its face was grey, eyes dark and sunken in. However, a flash of recognition lay in its dark, bloodied hair.

“A-Ava?” I stuttered, identifying her as the girl who had to go home on the first day.

The resemblance sent a shiver down my spine. I wondered if she was alive. Her body was mangled, flesh ripped apart and leaving trails of blood. Her eyes were lifeless. The smell was giving me a headache, but my joints were frozen in fear. Nausea gripped my insides. I breathed heavily, raking my eyes over her. Tears bubbled in my eyes.

With a crack, her head snapped up, and she growled.

She jumped, and my body sprang into action. I turned, and sprinted my way through the grass. I heard the disgusting gurgle behind me, followed by heavy footsteps. I ran faster than I ever had, adrenaline pumping through my veins. Every ounce of energy I had went into running from the vile creature. I almost hit a tree, but swerved and ducked right into our campsite.

I almost shed tears when I saw my tent again. I fell to my knees, panting. The sound woke up Ezra, who rushed to my side. “You okay? What happened?” He asked, rubbing a hand on my shoulder.

I fell on my back, breathing heavily. “Ava- Ava’s here,” I blurted out. “S-something’s wrong with her.”

“Dude, Ava’s not here..” Ezra said calmly. “There’s nothing here.”

“Huh?” I propped up to my elbows, powering my torch again. I gazed into the depth of the trees. Indeed, there was nothing to be found. Where did Ava go? More importantly, why had she become that way? Who did this to her?

The possible answers caused a thorny vine to wrap around my heart. 

I know what I saw.

The rage in the female instructor’s glare towards me, on the next day, said it all. 

They were changing us.
