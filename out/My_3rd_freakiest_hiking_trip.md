This actually happened to me when i was a fair bit younger, but a while back i was solo backpacking on an unfamiliar but really lush, kinda twisty little backcountry trail. I was using a lot of gear i had made from natural stuff, and it was early summer so i didnt have any hunting licenses and i didnt have agun or anything with me. Literally just a short celt i had made and a couple flint knives.  I had had a really nice couple days of my trip and i was encountering nothing but pleasant weather, peace and quiet, and nature in all its glory. Then, on the third day, after i broke for lunch, i noticed movement on the trail behind me. I was carrying a lot of weight in a home made triangle frame pack as a strength building exercise and i wasnt going all that fast. I thought at first it was a hiker so i made a little effort to slow down to let them pass but they never seemed to catch up. Eventually that started to become irritating, amd that was when i started to notice the movement just off the trail behind me. 

It was staying behind trees and bushes and around bends and i couldnt make out what it was. Its silhouette was indistinct and it was staying behind cover, couldnt get a square look at it, but the more i looked at it, the more it looked wrong. The torso was weird, too long, no waist, and i couldnt make sense of the glimpses i got of the head. The legs were extremely spindly, and the arms were hunched up or something, or tented in fromt of it or something. This was mostly on clay, and trails can be hard packed ground on clay, almost drum like, sometimes you can really here the thump of a footstep, but these were just eratic, and so loud. Like slamming a stick down onto the dirt. 

I called out to it a few times, let it know the time for jokes was over, knock it off a few times. Whenever i spoke or yelled it would just get quiet. Everyonece in a while there would be a crashing sound from back around where i heard it and a bunch of the thumps, and i kept thinking it was chargin me, but then nothing, and a while later id hear it again from a ways back. 

This lasted the full rest of the day, and by the time i was breaking for camp i was starting to be pretty freaked out amd pissed off. It was quiet while i set up my tarp and got settled and as dark fell. I threw some stones behind me, mostly to settle my nerves, and it was silent, so i figured whatever it was was over. When i cooked my food, i heard a few very rapid, very loud thumps from a ways behind me and then silence. I was frozen over my dinner for a few seconds, and i could feel my heartbeat in my eyes. I looked back and put my flashlight beam through the bushes for a few moments and then pretty high, like, taller than i was expecting to look for eyes, i saw two retinas reflect back up and then a bunch of thumps and crashing and a weird gasping, whistling breathing sound, but like it was going into a big space in a big chest. Kinda high pitched? from the distance i heard kind if a gagging cough. 

I didnt get any sleep that night, i just sat with my back to a big tree and with means of defending myself in my lap. I was not feeling good in the morning but coffee got me up and running, and i didnt see or hear any more sign of it for a few hours. 

I had been going west, kind of at an angle to the wind, and the trail i had to switch to started going north, with the wind on my back. That was when i started to smell something awful, and i realized that i must be smelling it, because it persisted no matter how long i walked. It was rancid. Rotting flesh or something equally gag inducing, paired with a kind of musky stink. Ive got a strong sense of smell, very strong, and it was making it hard to breathe. Not too long after i smelled that i statred to hear the rustling behind me again and the weird loud faltering foot steps. I still had no idea what it was, i kept getting  glimpses of it but couldnt make out color or anything definite. Could have been grey, or brown, or patches of reddish brown. Never got a clear enough look at it. 

I was really freaked out at this point and i decided, stupidly to charge at it a little to see if it would take off. I stomped and rushed the bushes a little  and i heard the rapid thumps and crashing again, and then silence again for a while. I am not ashamed to admit that it had freaked me out for long enough that i decided it was just time to put distance between me and it and i took off down the trail at a fair jog, despite the weight of my pack. I got clear of the stink for a bit, and well, i had run too hard and my body decided it was a great time to vomit, so i did. I took a breather for a while, and then started to really drag ass to my next watering spot, a little brook, and it was no fun at all. Took me most of the day to get there and i ended up skipping lunch because i didnt want to stop. 

I ended up deciding to set up camp closer to the water than i usually do. I was determined to get some sleep ,but still freaked out so i decided to do something i wouldnt normally and i set my hammock up really really high. liks around 4 or 5 feet off the ground, with my feet a little lower than my body so i could roll out and land on them. i ate my food as quickly as i could, and then climbed, best as i could into my hammock and tried to be as still as i could. I started to doze off almost immediately. An important detail is that i keep my pack on another tree with my pncho over it and my bear locker in a food bag even further away hanging in a tree.  It had been drizzling for a few hours at that point. 

I dont know how long i slept before i was woken up by this bizarre plasticy drumming sound. Really really loud, paired with the bizzare thumping and weird breathing  and the stench was back big time. It took me a moment to come to and then i was in full fight or flight. The noise was so weird. Inhad one of those little inflatable lanterns hanging off my hammock so i flicked it on and i could kinda vaguely see around me, the bushes and stuff. As soon as the might went on, the noises all stopped  Silence, long enough for crickets to start up their bullshit again. Then rapid steps and the thing popped through the foliage into the little area i had set up my tarp and hammock and i could see it  more clearly for the first time, it was long torsoed and thin legged and moved lurchingly, weird too big head apparently peirced through with a branch or something and lolling, arms apparently outstretched in front of it and i could see its eyes reflecting back at me, greenish yellow. I got that much of a glance and dropped down to the grojbd in my bare feet wiyh my hatchet in hand. When i looked abck up i finally recognized it. 

It was a mule deer buck, covered in sores and dirt and skeletally thin, stumbling around on its hind legs and going from tree to tree snapping at leaves(?) or aomething that that werent there. Its breathing was super ragged and weird and its head was loosely floppy on its neck, and as it got closer to me it fell down, making the crashing sound it had made before and then struggled back up. When it noticed me it froze, pissed a bunch, and then took off into the bushes. I wouls have laughed if i hadnt been so releived and tired. 

I went to inspect my food bag and it looked like i hadnt tied it wellnor high enough as it was down leaning against the trunck of the treeand it had had the ever loving shit kicked out of it, there were bent and scuffed bits all over my bearlocker. 

I figure it must have had CWD or something, but christ did that fuck with me. I marked a few spots with aricks pushed into the mud so i could find the tracks in the morning, dried off and slept for a few hours. 

i ended up searching around the place for a while in the morning and it had already been muddy as i was putting up my shelter. 

Heres the thing: i found deer prints from where it had come in and left, but outside my clearing, from the direction i had heard it coming i only found one print, a lot smaller than my feet, (im size 11 and flatfooted) with a high arch and only three toes, and it was in deep, deeper than my prints. No other tracks that i could find. 

I caught the rotting meat smell a few more times on the way back. I was supposed to go two days further in and then turn aorund and i decided to just head back to my car. I actually heard the thumping as i was getting back to where i parked and i ended up hustling the rest of the way.  I skipped aleeping the next night and just walkes through the night by flashlight. I kept hearing things, too. 

I havent hiked on that trail since, if im being honest.
