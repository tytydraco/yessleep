When you live with someone long enough, you get used to the little annoying things, like the way they leave dirty socks on the couch or their penchant for eating cereal at 2 AM. But there’s something different about my roommate, Luke. It’s not that he’s strange in the way that most roommates are. No, it’s something else entirely.

It all began on a lazy Saturday morning. I was sitting on the couch, scrolling through my phone, trying to decide what to do on my day off. My eyes flicked to the kitchen, where Luke was preparing breakfast. He had his usual routine, crack an egg, scramble it, throw in a slice of bread, and make a weird, mashed-up sandwich. He always did this in a way that made it seem as though he was performing some culinary masterpiece.

But then, something unusual happened.

“Luke is walking in the kitchen,” he muttered, as if someone else were in the room, narrating the scene. He didn’t even seem to notice. “He’s stepping lightly, trying not to make noise on the creaky floorboards. The smell of coffee wafts through the air as he opens the cabinet.”

I blinked, not sure if I had heard him correctly. I glanced over at him. He was still moving around, completely absorbed in what he was doing. His voice continued, almost casually. 

“The cereal box is knocked over by his elbow as he reaches for the mug. He’s beginning to wonder if he should put the cereal back in the pantry or leave it out for later.”

“Luke,” I said, my voice breaking through the strange moment, “are you like.. talking to yourself?”

He stopped mid-motion, glancing at me with wide eyes, as if I had just spoken a foreign language. “What? No, I’m not… Wait, what do you mean?” He paused and shook his head. 

I stared at him for a second, trying to process what just happened. Was he narrating himself? Was that a thing he did? He seemed confused, but it wasn’t like he had noticed anything off.

I decided to brush it off. Maybe he was just in a weird mood, or maybe he was messing with me. We all have our moments. I turned back to my phone and ignored him. After a few minutes, the narration started again, this time it was about a completely random event.

“He’s sitting down now. The chair is a bit too squeaky, but it’s nothing new,” Luke’s voice drifted through the air again. 

“He’s reaching for the remote, and his hand hovers just over the surface of the table. Watch it Luke! Don't spill your drink.”

I didn’t know what to do. It was like he was acting out a scene in a movie, but the odd thing was that he had no idea he was doing it. He wasn’t narrating for me, or anyone, just himself.

That was the first time I noticed it, but it wasn’t the last.

The following day, I was sitting on the couch, trying to get some work done on my computer. Luke had his headphones on, blasting music as he usually did. He was working on the online degree he had been pursuing for 5 years now. But today, he wasn’t just listening to music. He was narrating every single movement as if it were the most important thing happening.

“He’s sitting at his desk now, feeling the weight of his eyes on the screen,” Luke murmured. “He’s wondering if he’s doing it right. His fingers hover over the keyboard, and the click of each key makes him feel like he's not achieving enough.”

It was getting harder to ignore. I shifted in my chair, uncomfortable. I tried to focus on my work, but Luke’s voice, low and rhythmic, kept breaking through my thoughts. 

“He’s squinting at the screen now. His eyelids are heavy, his concentration faltering. He’s been at this for an hour and he’s beginning to regret his decision to start so late.”

“Luke,” I finally said, “are you, uh, okay buddy?”

His head jerked toward me in surprise. He took out his headphones, blinking at me like I was speaking in riddles. “What? What do you mean?”

“You’re still narrating everything you're doing,” I said, unable to stop the slight frustration in my voice.

Luke blinked a few times, processing the words. “What are you talking about? I’m not doing that.” He shook his head. “You’re starting to worry me dude,” he said.

I didn’t know what to say. He seemed genuinely confused. I just nodded, though I couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right.

Days went on. At first, it was small things. The way he narrated getting a glass of water.

“Luke reaches for the cold glass, his fingers brushing the condensation on the outside. He brings it to his lips, feeling the cool liquid slide down his throat.” 

And the random moments where he’d walk around the apartment, his voice narrating everything from the sound of his footsteps on the hardwood floor to the way the air felt when he opened the window.

It was starting to get unsettling. Each day, the narrations grew more specific, more detailed. Luke would describe not only what he was doing but how he was feeling.

“He’s feeling a bit annoyed now. It’s that same nagging irritation that’s been creeping up on him for days,” I heard him mutter one evening as he walked into the bathroom. “The faucet is running a bit too loud, and it’s making him anxious. He can’t shake it.”

It was odd. At first, I figured it was just a weird quirk. But soon, it felt more like something was seriously wrong.

I tried to confront him a few more times, but each time, he had no memory of saying anything out loud. “I’m not doing that,” he’d insist. “I don’t even know what you mean.”

One day, I had enough. He was standing in the kitchen, the smell of burnt toast filling the apartment, as he was narrating his breakfast like it was an epic tale.

“He’s making toast now, but wait! Something’s wrong,” Luke said. “The bread is burning, but he’s too slow to stop it. He’s getting frustrated! But he won’t admit it. The charred smell fills the air, but he’s ignoring it. He always does that..”

I snapped, my voice louder than I intended. “Luke! What the hell are you doing?!”

Luke stopped mid-bite, looking at me with confusion, the crumbs of burnt toast falling from his lips. “What?”

“Why are you still fucking narrating everything you do?” I asked, my hands gripping the edge of the counter. “Why are you doing that?”

He looked even more bewildered than usual. “I’m not narrating anything. You’re crazy.”

And that’s when I started to get a little nervous. I watched him with a growing sense of dread, unsure of what was happening. The next day, I was in my room when I heard something, muffled, like he was talking to himself again.

I leaned in, trying to catch the words. I could barely make it out.

“He’s becoming... too much. I can’t stand it anymore. It’s driving me crazy. I’ll have to do something soon.”

The words sent a shiver down my spine. I couldn’t tell if he was still narrating his own actions or if something darker was creeping into his thoughts.

Things went downhill after that. The narrations became more sinister. Luke would say things when I walk by, like, “Look at him.. so smug. He doesn’t even know what I’m planning..”

I could hear him whispering to himself at night, his voice low and unsettling. “The time is coming. He won’t see it coming.”

For the next few days, everything seemed oddly… normal. Luke continued narrating every little detail of his life, but the darker tone seemed to fade, replaced by the mundane once again. It was as if everything had returned to a comfortable, albeit strange, routine. The narrations didn’t have that ominous edge anymore. He was back to describing simple things like the weather, his meals, or the way he brushed his teeth.

“Luke picks up his toothbrush, the bristles soft against his gums,” he muttered one morning as he prepared for work. “He wonders if he’s brushing long enough, but decides it doesn’t really matter. It’s just another part of the morning routine.”

It was strange, but there was something almost comforting about it. No more veiled threats. No more murmurs about his plans for me. It felt like things were going back to normal. For a moment, I allowed myself to breathe a little easier.

But something didn’t sit right with me. The idea that Luke had no idea he was narrating his own life, no awareness of it at all, made me worried for his health. Something was obviously off. So, I decided it was time for a talk.

I had to get through to him. He needed help. He needed to realize what was happening. This had gone on long enough. I couldn’t just pretend like everything was okay when clearly something wasn’t. It was all too bizarre to just keep ignoring.

I waited for a quiet evening. When Luke came into the living room and sat down on the couch, I knew it was the right time. I could tell by the distant look in his eyes that something was still... off.

“Luke, we need to talk,” I said, trying to keep my voice calm. My hands were trembling slightly, but I couldn’t let him see that. This had to be a conversation about the future, not about fear.

He looked at me, his face unreadable, but then he did that thing again. That thing where he started speaking in that low, almost absent tone, as though narrating his own internal thoughts in real-time.

“Luke sits down on the couch, his body relaxed but his mind already elsewhere. He feels the weight of his roommate's words coming, the tension building in the air between them.”

I froze for a second, feeling a cold chill crawl down my spine. He was narrating this, right now, while I was speaking to him. My pulse quickened, and I swallowed hard, forcing myself to continue.

“Luke,” I said, taking a deep breath. “You’ve been… narrating everything you do, everything you feel. I don’t think you realize it, but it’s starting to become really concerning. You need to get help, Luke. This isn’t normal.”

He tilted his head slightly, blinking at me as though he were confused by my words, but at the same time, he didn’t stop narrating.

“Luke listens to his roommate, trying to focus, but something about the way he’s talking is starting to make him angry. It’s the same thing over and over, like Luke’s life is a problem to be fixed. But Luke knows better. He knows that his roommate doesn’t understand. He never has. He never will.”

The cold feeling in my stomach grew. I didn’t know how to react to him saying these things in front of me, out loud, as if he were having a conversation with himself.

“Luke doesn’t understand why he’s so angry. His roommate is just trying to help. It should be easy, right? Just listen, agree, and everything will be fine. But it’s not that simple. It never was. Luke’s thoughts race faster now, but he knows he must keep it together. For now.”

I opened my mouth, but nothing came out at first. 

“You’re still narrating everything, Luke.. like literally.. right now,” I pressed. “You’ve been doing it for weeks now, and it’s not just harmless commentary. It’s getting.. ” I searched for the right words, “.. it’s getting dangerous. It’s not healthy. I’m worried about you.”

“Luke is hearing the words, but they’re slipping past him. He can’t stop thinking about how this conversation feels. Why is his roommate acting like this? Why is he making him feel like this? Doesn’t he get it? Luke doesn’t need help. Luke doesn’t need to change. *He’s* not the problem.”

I felt my chest tighten. “Luke, please, listen to me. You’re not okay. This isn’t normal. I’m not trying to attack you, I just… I want you to get help. I want you to be okay.”

“Luke watches his roommate, sees the frustration, the concern etched on his face. It’s almost laughable. Doesn’t he see? Doesn’t he get it? *He* is the problem. Luke is done with his opinions. It’s time to act, time to fix this once and for all.”

I could hear the agitation in his voice. His tone had changed, gone darker. His words were louder now, more insistent.

“Luke feels his anger bubbling to the surface. He just keeps repeating the same thing over and over. But it’s getting under his skin. He can feel it. The irritation.. like a tickle in the back of his throat. But then it grows. It swells. He wants to scream.”

“Luke,” I started again, my voice trembling now, “this isn’t you. I know you’re upset, but—”

“Luke can’t take it anymore. The words are too much. The pestering is too much. Maybe if he makes it stop, it’ll be over. If he gets rid of the problem.. everything will be okay.”

I stepped back, my heart pounding in my chest. “Luke, stop. I’m begging you to listen to me.”

But Luke didn’t hear me. He was too far gone, lost in the voice inside his head that was narrating, controlling him.

“Luke’s body tenses. He feels his hands shaking, the nervous energy building. The anger is making him feel stronger. He doesn’t need anyone’s help. He doesn’t need anyone.”

I couldn’t breathe. The fear gripped me. It was like I was watching a different version of Luke, one that was shifting in front of me, changing into someone I didn’t recognize. He looked like a madman.

I took a step back. I knew I needed to get out of there. My mind was racing, and everything seemed to blur together.

“Luke’s roommate is weak. That’s what he’s been thinking this whole time. He’s weak.”

Luke stopped narrating suddenly, his eyes snapping up to meet mine. There was no fear, no recognition. Just cold, calculated anger.

“I’m not the one who needs help, you know,” he muttered, his voice thick with resentment.

I began to back away, my mouth opening to speak. Luke stood up abruptly, cutting me off mid-sentence. I blinked, startled by his sudden movement. There was no warning, just that eerie silence in the room after his last, chilling words. He began to slowly walk backwards into the kitchen, eyes still locked on mine. 

“Luke stands, his body stiff but his mind already elsewhere, consumed with thoughts he can’t stop, thoughts that are louder than his roommate’s voice. He moves toward the kitchen, feeling the coldness of the floor beneath his bare feet. He wonders if his roommate is still talking, still trying to convince him of something that doesn’t matter.”

I froze, hearing the words echo in my head. Luke wasn’t even acknowledging me now, just moving in a trance-like state as his voice narrated his own every move.

I was paralyzed. I watched him step into the kitchen, his footsteps barely audible in the silence of the apartment. His actions were precise, measured, like he was following a script only he could hear.

“Luke opens the fridge, the cold air hitting his face. He grabs a carton of milk, not because he’s thirsty, but because it’s an action to fill the void, a distraction. He wonders if the milk will be sour, but shrugs. He’ll deal with that later.”

I could feel my heart hammering in my chest. I couldn’t move, couldn’t speak. I was paralyzed by the strangeness of what was happening. What was he doing?

“Luke places the milk back in the fridge.”

His movements were so ordinary, so mundane. It wasn’t just the narration that unnerved me; it was the quiet way he was moving. The deliberate, slow pace. 

“Luke turns his attention to the knife block on the counter. He looks at the knives, fingers brushing lightly over the cool metal, contemplating. He feels something stir inside him, something dark. A sense of power, of control. He doesn’t feel scared anymore. He doesn’t feel lost. He feels focused, determined.”

I could hear the distinct sound of metal scraping against wood as Luke slowly slid the largest knife from the block. My blood ran cold.

“Luke grips the knife tightly, the cool handle pressing against his palm. The weight of it is comforting. He looks at the blade, not with fear, but with a sense of purpose.”

My legs felt frozen in place, but my eyes were looking toward the front door. I wanted to leave, but fear had me planted there, panic rising in my throat. “Luke!” I called, my voice shaking. “W.. What are you doing?!”

But Luke didn’t respond. Instead, he continued with his narration, like I wasn’t even there.

“Luke walks back into the living room, holding the knife in his hand. His thoughts swirl around him, chaotic and sharp, like the blade in his grasp. He wonders if his roommate knows what’s coming, if he’s figured it out yet. But he’s not sure it matters. It’s too late now.”

His words made it worse, made everything feel so deliberate, like he was living out some twisted script. His voice was so cold, detached.

“Luke stops in front of his roommate, the knife heavy in his hand, but there’s no fear in his heart. He’s calm, collected. He’s at peace with the anger. It’s been building for so long. This is the only way to make it all stop.”

“Luke, no” I stammered, my voice barely a whisper. “Please, put the knife down.”

He didn’t respond, just stood there, his gaze cold and distant. His voice continued, narrating his thoughts as if we were in two different realities.

I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself, trying to think. This wasn’t the Luke I knew. This wasn’t the guy who would have ever even considered doing something like this. Something had changed, something inside him was breaking apart, unraveling in front of me.

I couldn’t just stand there. I couldn’t let him do whatever he was planning. The air between us felt thick, heavy with tension. My mind raced, looking for a way out, a way to make sense of this, but I couldn’t think straight. I needed to get the knife away from him, somehow.

I took a cautious step forward. “Luke, you don’t need to do this,” I pleaded, my voice hoarse. “Just… just talk to me. Let’s work this out. We can figure this out.”

“Luke isn’t listening. He feels something snap inside him. He’s done with words, done with this. It’s time to end it. To silence him once and for all.”

Luke lunged forward before I could move. I tried grabbing his wrist, trying to pull the knife from his hand. His grip was strong, unyielding. There was something dark in his eyes, something that didn’t belong.

The world around me seemed to blur into a tunnel as my heart hammered in my chest, adrenaline flooding my system. I kept pulling, my breath shallow and frantic.

And then, in one sudden motion, I snapped out of it. Every instinct screaming at me to run. I broke free from the struggle and bolted for the door.

“Luke watches as his roommate turns and runs, a sense of satisfaction creeping up his spine. His steps are slow but deliberate, knowing that it’s too late to escape.”

I could hear Luke behind me, his footsteps barely audible at first, but they were there, following me, echoing in the quiet apartment. I didn’t dare look back, just kept pushing forward, my hands frantically grabbing for the door handle.

The cool metal of the knob was slick with sweat as I wrenched the door open, stumbling out into the hallway.

*Snap*.

The pain hit me hard, sharp and searing, as if someone had shoved a hot iron into my back. My breath left me in a violent gasp. I didn’t stop. I couldn’t stop.

I was halfway down the stairs when I heard Luke’s voice, quiet and detached, like he wasn’t even speaking to me anymore.

“Luke doesn’t need to chase anymore. He’s already won.”

The words echoed in my ears, fueling my panic. I could hear him behind me, I could feel him gaining on me. The cold wind whipped against my skin, but it wasn’t enough to clear the fog of fear clouding my mind. I had to get away, had to keep running.

I burst out into the street, the night air cold against my back, now pouring with blood. The bright streetlights flickered overhead. The distant hum of cars, the occasional shout of a pedestrian, it was all a blur as I sprinted down the block. My legs ached, my heart hammering in my chest like a drum. Every step felt like it might be my last.

But I didn’t dare look back. I kept running, my feet pounding against the pavement, the knife wound throbbing with each step, the blood soaking through my clothes. The pain was unbearable, but it didn’t matter.

I just needed to get away.

The corner store came into view, a neon light glowing faintly in the distance. I pushed myself harder, the door to the convenience store just within reach.

My hands were slick, shaking as I grabbed the door handle and yanked it open. The bell above the door rang loudly, a harsh contrast to the silence of the night. I didn’t pause to explain myself. I rushed past the counter, my back to the clerk who stood frozen, eyes wide in confusion.

“Call the police,” I gasped, my voice barely audible over the pounding in my ears. “Please. Call the police.”

The clerk’s mouth moved, but the words didn’t register. I couldn’t focus on anything except the pain, the fear, and the knowledge that Luke was still out there.

The next few minutes were a blur of movement, the store clerk picking up the phone, the sirens in the distance growing louder. I collapsed to the ground, coming in and out of consciousness. The blood oozed through my clothes, getting on everything around me.

The world slipped away as I heard the faint sound of police cars approaching.

When the police went back to the apartment, Luke was gone. The doctors say I will make a mostly full recovery, but I’m not sure I’ll ever really be the same. 

This morning, I woke up to the steady beep of a heart monitor and the antiseptic sting of a hospital room. My back aches like hell. For a moment, everything was a blur. But then it all came rushing back.

Luke.

I try to sit up, but pain lances through my back, forcing me back down. A nurse notices and rushes over, placing a hand on my shoulder.

"Easy now," she said with a soft smile. "You've been through a lot."

My throat was dry. "Luke," I croak out. "Did they find Luke yet?"

The nurse’s smile falters just a bit, but she covers it quickly. "You should rest. I’m sure the police will come by later to talk."

She adjusts my IV, humming softly under her breath, and just as she’s about to leave, she pauses at the door.

"You know, you’ve been doing this funny thing," she says, her voice light, casual. "You’ve been sitting up in bed and talking. Having whole conversations. But when we come in, you stop.”

My skin prickles.

"What do I say?" I whisper.

She shrugs. "Hard to tell. Mostly just one side of a conversation. It’s almost like you’re narrating a movie or something."

A cold weight settles in my stomach.

I don’t remember doing that.

Before I can respond, she gives me one last polite smile and walks out, leaving me alone with the rhythmic beep of the monitor and a million questions.
