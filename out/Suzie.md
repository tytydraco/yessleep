I was six when I met Suzie, she had been there first one to make contact as much like I am now, I was the quiet type, reserved. Well behaved. I suppose it has always been in my nature to be somewhat of a goodie two shoes. And for the most part, Suzie was similar yet she had seemed to have her energetic outbursts whenever she was away from home; at school, during sleepovers at my house, on the way home. But she would become reserved once she neared her house. Being a kid, I had never thought about it much, I had put it down to strict parents, something I knew about too. 

We had become fast friends, her parents seemed happy enough to let Suzie stay over at mine whenever we wanted, and since we were both well behaved; my parents never minded too much. Only the odd comment that I can remember. We would spend the afternoons watching shows and playing in the street with some of the kids in the neighbourhood, we would have dinner then make up stories before bed. I didn't notice it much back then but it seemed Suzie spent more days at my house than hers, we were both only children so perhaps the loneliness was a familiar battle for Suzie too. 

Suzie and I became inseparable, like sisters as she used to say. Our friendship lasted into our teens and we had started mapping out our lives together, two girls from a small town in the south of the UK ready to take on the world. We were determined we would walk down the streets of New York one day, shopping bags on our arms and turning heads. We would laugh about it all the time. It wasn't until I was older, in my teens that I realised Suzie's homelife hadn't been as normal as I suspected. I was used to seeing disagreements between my parents but Suzie's parents seemed to go beyond that and I had felt stupid for not realising sooner. 

And, as strange as it may seem, one memory had jolted forward right after I witnessed an argument between Suzie's parents as she entered the house after walking back from school. One aspect of Suzie that made a little too much sense; she was particularly good at playing hide and seek. She had a winning streak that had been going for years. I was never able to find her and as a result I would end up just shouting for her to come out. Coincidentally, a reoccurring dream had started around the time I first met Suzie, it was nothing particularly strange but I would be playing hide and seek with no one in particular and a voice would always tell me to hide under the sofa. It was always the same place. I had thought that maybe the dream and Suzie were connected at some point and that was where Suzie might be hiding, so on the following game after the potential connection that's where I had looked first but she was never there. So the connection I had been so sure of soon faded from my memory. 

To describe Suzie, she was the spitting image of her mother, more so as she had grown into her teens but she had always been bright and happy despite how things had been at home. Things had changed for a while though, when she was thirteen her mother left, rumours say she disappeared, others say she left because of Suzie's father, others speculated her father had some violent involvement as her father had a short temper and was inclined to ge physical but that all came to pass as she turned up some years later to finish things for good; a quick divorce and a ransacked safe before she did truly disappear. I know that had been hard for Suzie, it had all happened so quickly that she spent weeks staying with me, and given the situation, my parents kept their mouths such. 

She had eventually returned to her normal self, we were eighteen when we were planning our first girls trip. It was only to Brighton but we were excited to go to the beach and be adults, we had it all planned out and I had assumed her father wouldn't of minded, since he had never seemed to care where Suzie was at anyway. But that weekend where we were supposed to have fun had turned into my nightmare. I had waited at the train station for over an hour waiting for Suzie, she wasn't the type to be late but this was our first trip alone and put her lateness down to forgetting something. I had eventually asked the help desk to use their phone as I hadn't any coins on me to use the payphone. I had called a few times but she never picked up, neither did her father. Something in me, in that moment, sunk. Down. Deep into the pit of my stomach. An ache of pain and worry but I hadn't much reason for it in the moment. It wasn't until ended up getting back home that news of Suzie's disappearance had been thrown at me, well, not even at me. I heard it as my mother repeated the words while on the phone. By this point it had been a couple of hours and appearances she had been missing since late last night, according to her father. I would later learn that her father hadn't known about the trip until the day of. Somethings about his story never sat right, Suzie had said, only one time mind you, that her father didn't like the idea of her going too far. She had also off handedly mentioned she suspected that he was worried she would do the same as her mother. Leave him. I knew Suzie liked to keep the peace and just did as she was told. I guess that just made things easier for her to deal with. 

The following days. Weeks. Months. A slow and unfruitful investigation to my best friends disappearance seemed to eat away at the small community of people in the town, myself included. The rumours. The theories. The new articles. The interviews. They soon fizzled out after a year and Suzie had seemed to become much like a distant memory after a few years. Not to me though, I could never forget her. Her suitcase had been packed. Her tickets had been neatly tucked in her diary. Perhaps it was morally wrong but I had read her diary. Many times. Trying to find a clue. A hint. Anything to tell me where she might have been. Where she had gone. Why she had left so suddenly. And without me. We had told each other everything, so why not this? 

Her disappearance has eaten at me for years, no matter how I put the fragments I had of her homelike together, nothing ever made any sense. There were no hints on my memory, in the time we spent together. I couldn't think of a single thing that could tell me what happened to her. I had moved away from that small town as soon as I could. I had been plagued by her memory and the ties that kept her in my memory and in my surroundings at every turn and so I had ran from that. Yet it still followed me, trailing far behind but still ever present in the back of my mind. It wasn't until I got a letter at the office that I was left utterly dumbfounded. For whatever reason, unknown to me, I had inherited Suzie's family home. I knew that Suzie's family was severely limited but it wasn't until I did a bit of digging that I found out that all the other family Suzie had was on her mother side and all that disappointed when her mother left and her father had no other family. So, for whatever his reasoning was, it was left to me. 


The house spent a long time sitting before I had come back to sort out the legal side of things as I planned to clear the house. Keep some of Suzies things and sell what I could before selling the house. I hate it but I didn't want any ties to the house, to the town, to Suzie, it was too painful to bear. Even as I was sorting through documents and junk that was collecting dust, I couldn't help but think about how the police had searched the house a number of times, as if they were certain of something but nothing had ever come out of it and of course, they had suspected Suzie's father first but eventually he was cleared. It wasn't until I had worked my way through all the small pieces of furniture and the decoration pieces that I was left with large spaces and big furniture. I was happy to leave it at that. But something about the living room felt so off. I had only ever been in Suzie's house once. And that was when I had been around eleven. But I never did remember the lime green, shag carpet in the living room. I remember hardwood flooring. It struck me as odd as I would've definitely remembered the colour but the carpet looked old, like it had been placed their decades ago. 

I tried to ignore the realisation and tried to doubt my memory, and I did just this for weeks until I couldn't stand it anymore. Something about that carpet. Something about that spot where the sofa was. Something about Suzie. And so I went back at the crack of dawn, moved that three seater sofa across the room and pulled up the carpet. And just as I suspected. There was hardwood floor. Old. Worn. Stained. A deep brown smeared around. On top. Nearby. Like a bad attempt at retaining the wood. A reason to cover it up with carpet. But my memory and my dreams hadn't been for nothing. Because there's a hatch. And I think I just found Suzie.
