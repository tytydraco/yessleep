My first wreck killed six people.

Six.

I was on a twelve hour haul—only the second time driving a fully loaded eighteen-wheeler up the interstate. It was early in the morning, I passed signs for West Virginia, knowing I was just a few hours from my drop. But above those signs, I saw something else.

A giant, winged *thing*.

It was perched on the overhead signage like some massive black bird, wrapped in its own plumage. I remember thinking it had to be one of those condors I’d seen once in Utah. *But what the hell was a giant condor doing in West Virginia?*

I didn’t have time to dwell. Up ahead, a Jeep was jackknifed across the road, its hazards blinking, the offending vehicle lay on its side too, making the crash block a combined four lanes of highway traffic.

I’d been trained for runaway loads, black ice, bad fog, even single-lane obstacles. *But a four-lane obstacle?*

The only answer was brakes.

My engine blared a deep *BRAP BRAP BRAP* as I engaged the jake brakes, which was followed by a high-pitched whine as I pulled the pneumatics.

My heart was in my throat. I did my best to steer 40,000 pounds of steel into a skidding halt, but as you might imagine—that much momentum doesn’t stop easy.

I prayed. Loudly and helplessly.

My prayers went unanswered as my truck *plowed* into the downed Jeep, flinging it aside like a plastic toy. My trailer steamrolled the other car, flattening it instantly.

The two cars had only crashed moments ago. The passengers never had time to get out.

By the time the police and ambulance showed up, everyone was pronounced dead.

Well everyone except me that is.

\*\*\*

Physically, I was fine, barely a scratch on me thanks to the height of the truck cab. But mentally … I was destroyed. In fact, as I type this out now, I realize I *still* haven’t ever truly recovered from that first wreck.

All-too-vividly, I can still picture my truck’s massive wheel flattening that young mother’s neck, turning her head into soup. 

All-too-vividly, I can still hear the sounds of my trailer wheels crushing the other car, ending the screams so abruptly. Sounds I won’t ever be able to unhear.

My distress grew worse when the affected families got ahold of my contact information. They sent lots of messages. 

Hateful messages.

Yes, the two cars had already collided before I got there. And yes, some of the victims might have died anyway. But my 18-wheeler was the clear *Grim Reaper* in this accident. It was *my* foot above the gas pedal that sealed the deal for those six.

Everyone blamed the disaster on me.

And even though my dashcam footage cleared me of any criminal charges (I did hit the brakes as soon as I could), the families still pointed to my *momentary lapse*.

Those few seconds on camera where I appeared to be “distracted”. Those precious couple seconds where I fixated on that highway sign. On the giant winged *thing* that wasn’t supposed to be there.

If I hadn’t been so caught off guard … who knows. Maybe I would have seen the flickering red hazard lights just a little bit sooner.

Maybe I could have stopped in time.

\*\*\*

I left the whole trucking industry after that (losing about 10K on those expensive driving courses). I just couldn’t drive anything so large and dangerous again. Every other person on the road felt like a brittle skeleton wrapped in skin waiting to die in an accident…

I sought counseling, took a break from all employment, and I even moved back home with my parents. I felt like I really needed to work on myself mentally, and recoup.

And barely two months into my recouping, the next big disaster struck.

At the theme park.

\*\*\*

When I heard my niece was turning twelve and going to the local fair with her younger sister, I jumped at the chance to be the ‘cool uncle’ and take them. It seemed like the perfect family outing—fun for them and a welcome distraction for me.

And for the first half of our theme park day, we had a blast. 

We rode the pirate ship ride, conquered the mirror maze, I even won them a large *Shadow The Hedgehog* from one of the carnival games. My nieces loved carrying the jumbo plushie.

And then came the roller coaster.

It was one of the newer kinds—faster, brighter, and featuring a long corkscrew segment which left you hanging upside down. My nieces were daring each other to try it, so I agreed to go on with them together.

We were next in line, both girls were teasing each other with anticipation when my stomach started twisting knots. 

I tried to shake it off as nothing. As needless paranoia from all the loud, fast moving metal… but that's when I saw it. 

*The dark winged thing.* 

It was back.

This time it was crouched only thirty feet away on top of the tiny operating booth, where some pimply ginger kid manned the roller coaster controls.

I grabbed the shoulders of both my nieces. “Don’t panic,” I muttered under my breath.

They both looked at me, wide-eyed with anticipation. “Uncle Tanner, don’t make it sound scarier than it already is.”

I stared down at them. “You … don’t see it?”

The birthday girl rolled her eyes. “You mean the death ride we’ve signed up to go on? Yeah, we can see it, uncle.”

*They couldn’t see it.*

I surveyed the crowd around me and realized *no one else* had noticed the sudden appearance of that ominous black *thing* above us.

A slice of night in the middle of day.

Back in my truck, I thought it had been a giant bird with ruffled feathers, but at the theme park, I could see it was a far more *humanoid* thing—wrapped in some kind of billowing black shroud. 

The humanoid turned to me, and I could see *it had no head,* at least not in the traditional sense. Instead its face appeared to conform to its torso. A twisted, indiscernible visage … with the brightest set of red eyes I’d ever seen.

Two burning stop lights.

Before I could say anything, the roller coaster began to squeal. Everyone turned to see the carts hit a speed that looked *much* too fast.

The red-haired teen panicked inside the control booth, repeatedly flicking switches.

“Is that normal?” One of my nieces pointed at the sparks flying from the last cart on the coaster. Bright orange streams of light

“No.”

As I turned back, I saw the teenager try once more to pull a large red lever, but was unable to.

He ran outside the booth, screaming into his walkie. “The ride won’t stop! Please help! Please send help!”

Behind him, the Living Shroud Thing scooped one of its wings down towards the red lever.

Without a moment’s hesitation I ran towards the booth, terrified that this shadow-being was about to cause another accident.

Patrons gasped around me. My nieces gawped.

When I burst into the operator’s booth, the creature’s black wing hovered above the red lever like a dense sheet of fog. Across the wing’s surface I saw a pattern I still remember vividly. A pattern of *tiny screaming faces*. Faces without eyes or noses screaming for their lives and dissipating into the ether--as if the creature was continuously shedding miniature souls.

I batted with my hand, and the black wing dissipated. Gone like campfire smoke.

I grabbed hold of the lever and pulled with my entire upper body, clenching my teeth and wincing. “Please please please…”

This time my prayers were answered—the lever lowered.

“Yes!”

But before I had time to celebrate, there came a loud screeching *PANG!* The horrible sound of something dislodging. 

As I turned to look at the red metal tracks, I saw the roller coaster *had flown off.*

It went sailing.

High in the sky.

I ran out of the booth, gripping the sides of my head, completely in shock. Every single park-goer froze in place with their eyes on the fairgrounds below. The coaster had just fallen into one of the theme park’s shops. 

The collapsed roof stared back like a gaping maw.

A black hole of death.

A freak accident.

When I pulled the lever—the coaster’s rails couldn’t handle the emergency brake.

It was all my fault.

\*\*\*

If my life had hit rock bottom from the truck crash, I had now dug *past* rock bottom into a new subterranean low.

My nieces were traumatized.

I was traumatized. 

The ensuing litigation turned into a court fiasco which even now, after four months, is still just getting started. **Twenty four deaths in need of an explanation. Twenty four deaths all tied to my hand.** Once again, I legally wasn't to blame (the maintenance of the roller coaster was the problem), but that didn't stop people from petitioning outside my parent's house, asking for my arrest.

My whole entire family looked at me differently. Parents. Cousins. Grandparents.

They thought I was **cursed**.

And I don't blame them. What are the odds of someone facing two of such disasters in their lifetime?

I was speechless for weeks after the coaster accident. Had trouble getting out of bed (which I could never fall asleep in anyway). I struggled to function at all from the overwhelming remorse… the self-loathing…. but most of all, the fear.The fear that I would see that *winged nightmare again.*

\*\*\*

I’ve shared all this with you, because now I’m on the verge of my third disaster.

Yes, you heard me. *Third*.

For the first time in months, I borrowed my mom’s Civic so I could pick up medication from the nearby mall’s pharmacy.

I was actually proud of myself for not having a panic attack today. I had been doing so well. 

After grabbing my meds, I was just about to pull out of the mall’s parking lot when I saw a rustling silhouette on the exit sign.

A silhouette that looked like a massive bird—shrouded in black mist.

I reversed my car. 

I put it in park.

My ensuing panic attack must have lasted at least ten minutes. My uncontrollable crying, another five.

“Please…” . I spoke inside my car, wiping my face. “Leave me alone. I don't want to hurt anybody… Please just let me go.”

Unlike the first two incidents with the winged being, this time, I was by myself. Every other patron was far away by the mall entrance. I was at least a three minute drive from the highway.

*What disaster was there to strike?*

Despite my ignition being off, something activated the accessory power in my car. The speakers BLARED white noise. I twisted the volume knob down, but it did nothing.

Outside my car, I could see the massive wings leap off the sign. The Living Shroud Thing glided towards my vehicle. I jumped into my back seat, wrapping hands around my eyes like a toddler. 

I was too afraid to leave the car.

I was too afraid to even *look* at what was coming.

But I could hear it. 

The monster landed on the hood with a padded thud. The whole vehicle shook from its landing.

“No…” I wailed one last time.

In response, the white static from my radio undulated. It formed words.

*“...Y̷o̸u̴…”*

Every blood vessel inside me froze. I swear my heart then stopped.

*“... ̶Y̷o̸u̴ w̴i̶l̶l ̴k̴i̴l̶l ̷s̴e̴v̷e̷n ̷m̸o̸r̸e…"*

It sounded inhuman. Like the static in the radio itself was being manipulated to form words

*“...T̴h̸e ̷c̴r̴a̷n̶e̷…*

*“... ̶Y̵o̶u ̷w̷i̴l̴l ̷h̴i̴t ̴t̴h̷e ̴c̴r̶a̶n̸e...”*

With the smallest, most infinitesimal use of energy, I spread one finger away from my eye. Outside my windshield, I couldn’t see the monster, but there, on the opposite side of the parking lot, I saw the crane.

A rusted, yellow construction crane at the side of the mall under renovation. The base of the crane was awfully close to the curb on the street. One small sideswipe from my car, and it was entirely possible that those rickety yellow beams would collapse into the mall—causing untold damage.

“No…” I covered my eyes again. “I’m not doing that.”

A pause in the white noise. Small surges in the sound—like sonic tadpoles—travelled across the radio static.

*“...Ẏ̸̡ơ̸͇u̸̦̔ ̶w̷̖͂ì̷̝l̵̢̋l̷̯̈́…”*

There came a red flash. A red flash so powerful, that even through my closed eyes, *even through my cupped hands*, I felt blinded.

The radio died. 

The static, tense feeling in the air disappeared.

I uncurled myself from my fetal position, and waited for my vision to unblur. When my feet touched the floor, my shoes crunched on something odd.

*Is that sand?*

Once I could see well enough, I realized I wasn’t even inside my car. I was inside some malevolent entity’s “joke” of a car.  

My mother’s entire 1994 Honda Civic had been recreated in some kind of extremely coarse and shiny *black* sand. I was surrounded by the sand.

*The hell?* 

As I grabbed at the door—it dissolved in my hands.Then the roof above me collapsed—avalanching a big pile of sand.

“Ptuh! Ptuh! Blegh!"

I spat out a mouthful and tried to edge out of the car, but as soon as my foot put pressure on the ground… I began to sink.

“Shit!”

All I could do was grab at other pieces of the sand-car—which all dissolved. The sand swirled and sank in the same direction. It was whirlpooling at my feet. 

“No!... No!”

It’s like the sand was *alive.* The pressure around my ankles began to tug, pulling firmer and firmer. I tried to swim. Big strokes. Quick strokes. Doggie Paddle. I even managed to maintain waist height for a little while… but that’s where I lost hope, because that’s when I saw where I was…

Endless sand in all directions. 

Miles of it. Oceans.

I was in the middle of a black sand desert. Above me the sky was the color of midnight, without any stars or moon. 

And it's not that it was foggy, I could tell that the sky was completely unobscured, it's just that this sky simply *didn’t have any stars*. There was nothing above me save for two red dots.

Two little stars.

I knew they were eyes. And I could tell they were leering at me with an intensity I’ve never felt before. 

Were they angry? I’m not sure. Even as I’m writing this now, I couldn’t tell you the motivation behind the entity. Or why it chose me.

The sand pulled me down. Piles of it formed around me, dragging aggressively. I put up a small, feeble fight, but like an ant in a sand pit, I eventually succumbed to the overwhelming force.

With a clenched mouth, I closed my eyes, and accepted my descent into the long, coarse dark. I must have turned chalk white from fear. I had never been so scared. 

Never felt so helpless. 

There came a steady supply of oxygen through my clogged nostrils. Somehow I was still breathing. It’s like something wanted me to *live.* *Something wanted me to live in this state of being buried alive.*

I was beyond struggling or screaming. 

Surrounded by sand, sinking deeper still—my fear was the petrified-kind. Full body paralysis. As I kept getting dragged further, I could picture the mountain growing overtop. Any escape was becoming more and more impossible.

*Where was this going?* 

*How will I die?* 

*Will I… die?*

In response, the sand chilled around me like a trillion tiny icicles. And that same static voice transmitted across the endless black. 

“...T̷h̴i̶s̷ ̷i̸s ̷y̷o̶u̷r ̶e̷t̴e̸r̷n̶i̷t̴y̶…”

*Eternity?* The word settled into the pit of my stomach. *No… this can’t…. No…*

Somehow, despite being completely buried, I learned I could still sob. My eyes burned from the sand. My whimpers muffled against the granules around my face.

The sand’s texture turned even colder. My whole body burned from the chill.

“...T̵h̴i̶s̷ ̷i̸s ̷y̷o̶u̷r ̶l̶a̷s̶t̴ ̷c̴h̴a̴n̸c̶e̷…”

*Please. Make it stop.*

“.. *Y̷o̸u̴ w̴i̶l̶l ̴k̴i̴l̶l ̷s̴e̴v̷e̷n ̷m̸o̸r̸e*…”

\*\*\*

\*\*\*

\*\*\*

I regained consciousness in my car. 

Like a toddler, I was still wrapped up in the back of my passenger seat, shivering uncontrollably. My entire body ached as I unclenched and sat in a more regular position.

Outside, the world was calm. 

My radio was off. 

I wish I could tell you that the black desert was all a dream… but I knew it wasn’t.

It was a warning. 

A very real taste of my eternal damnation for disobeying the shadow being.

\*\*\*

I’ve been sitting here for over three hours. Looking at that crane. Gripping my steering wheel. Biting my tongue. Writing this story. 

I know I’m going to have to ram that stupid thing.

And I know I will go turn myself into the police afterwards. I’ll tell them it was planned.

Prison is fine. I can do prison. It’ll be paradise compared to whatever ninth ring of Hell I was just exposed to. 

I never wanted to visit that starless desert again. I would rather lock myself away, deep behind bars where I can never be a danger to the public. Where I could never be found by those searing *red eyes.*

So here I am. 

Enjoying my last few moments.

I’ll tell you right now, there is a peacefulness. A sort of serenity before oblivion.

I can see some spring grass, escaping through the cracks of concrete in the parking stall beside me. There’s little purple flowers in it. 

I can see a lone patron pushing a shopping cart. They’re unloading some groceries into their car.

There’s a bird nearby too. 

A small one.

It's seated high on a lamp post, scratching its beak against its wings.

It's chirping and flying now. Circling my car it seems.

And now look. There it goes. Flying outward.

Look at it zip. Look at it go.

It's perched on the crane. Watching me.

Eyes both glowing with the slightest hint of [red.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EclosionK2/comments/1g0837r/welcome/)
