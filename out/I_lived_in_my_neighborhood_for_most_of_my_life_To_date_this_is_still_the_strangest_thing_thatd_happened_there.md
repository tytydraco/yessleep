Terrace County, born and raised. Proudly. Nice home high up in the mountains where you could look down upon the world, not giving much of a single care in the world. With a sort of description like that, you'd think there'd be nothing to really complain about, would there?

For the most part, you'd of course be right. My life was a nice and happy one through and through up to that point. But happy life or not, no one's without at least *one* ghost story or *one* traumatic event that ends up sticking with them for the rest of their lives, right?

For me, it was when I was well into young adulthood. I hadn't moved out of my house yet, given that I was working part time as a grocer while also going to community college. It, believe it or not, wasn't a bad job for what it was, and it allowed me to kick enough each month to Ma and Dad for rent to keep them off my back while not putting me in the hole. The people had a lick of damn sense and, for the most part, people seemed to like me.

One night, though, I found the case to be very different. One night, I was just trying to work as usual. It was about two and a half hours from closing time and I found that this one guy kept coming in the store. Now, it wasn't *entirely* uncommon for something like this to happen. It's no exaggeration to say that, for the most part, the place *was* basically dependent on repeat customers. Thing was, I at least *knew* said "repeat customers". This guy, however, I didn't know.

The second thing out of sorts here was the fact that this guy also didn't actually buy anything. Finally, the biggest mark of all, though, was the fact that I couldn't see the guy's face. he wore a hood and hat with shades that pretty much concealed the majority of his face from view. That alone was enough to get him looked at suspiciously, not to mention being approached by employees and told to please remove the hood, but everyone else -- all two other people there with me that night -- I guess were too busy to notice or say anything to him about it.

Fortunately, at the front counter where I was, there was little to no business so I decided to go and say something to the guy. I approached him in the Electronics aisle and asked "Hey there, sir, is there anything I can help you with?"

He snapped his head to look at me like a deer in headlights. I cleared my throat and repeated my question. He exchanged a glance back and forth between me and the shelf in front of him. He then lowered his head and walked away. "Hey wait!" I exclaimed, running to catch up with him. He kept walking. I was about to radio to one of the others that he was heading toward the pet aisle when I found that he wasn't there anymore.

I looked to my right and left down the chemical and pharmaceutical aisles to see if he was in either of those and I'd just missed him. He wasn't. I then ran to see of he'd beat me to the pet aisle. Nope, nothing. He just wasn't there.

*What the, where'd he go?* I started throwing my head around frantically. Where was he? He was *right there,* wasn't he? What the hell happ-

I was snapped back to attention when I felt a hand on my shoulder, causing me to whirl around and almost backhand my coworker in the face. "Whoa, Christe, switch to decalf, please!"

I let out a sigh. "Oh Jesus, Frank, I'm sorry, I just.." He held up his hand.

"Look, forget about that, who the hell's watching the register?"

"Oh shit, yeah, I'm on it." I turned then and hurried back to the front counter. When I got back to the front, I did my best to try and forget about the whole thing. It was nothing, just a one -in - a - million fluke that some guy kept coming in and out and that he was gone in an instant. That is, until I saw him again.

He was walking through the front door like he had the past several times that day. He walked again towards Electronics, where I followed him. "Sir!" I called out. Just like last time, he looked at me and bolted for pets aisle. I followed him again, only to again lose him in chemicals and pharmaceuticals. This time, I spent a good ten or so minutes trying to search for him before I was once again approached from behind by Frank. This time, though, I noticed something else.

Frank asked me who was watching the front of the store again, like he had the first time. I was about to turn and head back again when I noticed this. "Hey, uh... didn't you say that last time?" I asked him. He cocked his eyebrows at me.

"Last time?" he asked. "What're you talking about?"

"Just a moment ago, didn't you tell me to head back to the front?" He looked down for a moment before shaking his head at me. "O-Okay... Well what about the guy in the hoodie, did you see him?" he shook his head again.

"Christie, I seriously think you need to switch to--"

"Decalf?" I asked, cutting him off. His eyebrow raised further.

"Uh... Y-Yeah... How'd you--"

"You said that, too..." For a moment, the two of us just looked dumbfounded at each other before he turned and walked away. I stood for a moment, confused as all hell. The way my head spun, I'm almost surprised it didn't detach itself from my head and start flying around like a helicopter.

*I DID see that, right? That guy WAS here, both before and now, wasn't he? And why did Frank repeat himself? Does he know he did? How come HE didn't see the guy?*

I turned and was about to head back for a third time when a thought occurred to me. I realized that the emergency back door was located just past the pet food aisle. I realized he must've been using that to run out, circle around, and then come back in. I figured he must be using that door to sneak out however much of the store's merchandise by that point, and coming back in to grab more. With this in mind, I ran through and looked out the door.

The parking lot back there was empty. I looked around, using my phone as a flashlight to see if he was lingering around. And before you say anything, yes, I realize what I was doing was dangerous, checking out the back area alone in the middle of the night. Again, though, it was normally a safe area to be in, where stuff like that wasn't usually a *huge* concern, plus, I *did* always carry my butterfly knife on me in case I needed to use a blade to open packaging on one of the products (They don't supply us with boxcutters for some reason). In any event, neither he nor anybody else was anywhere around.

Figuring I'd already missed him and that he'd likely already made it back around to the front, I turned and ran back to the register. Sure enough, I was right. I made it back in time to catch him in the electronics apartment again. I was about to confront him again when I stopped, opting instead to observe him first. I figured I could catch him in the act first, you know?

Well, I watched him for at least 10 minutes and didn't see him stealing anything. In fact, I didn't *see* him doing anything either. Just standing there, shaking and looking around like an idiot.

Finally, I decided to walk up. As I did so, I quietly radioed to Frank for backup. **"Be right there..."** said Frank's voice over the radio, a little too loud. Unfortunately, this ended up giving my position away and he looked over to me again, spooked, before turning and booking it. *Oh no you don't!*

In an instant, I watched him dart past the chemical and pharmacy aisles again before losing sight of him. Maybe "losing sight of him" isn't the right word here. It might be more accurate to say that he up and fucking *vanished*. As in, one instant -- not a second, an *instant* \-- he was right there in front of me, maybe just a foot or two ahead of me, and the next, he's not anymore.

And keep in mind that he had at least another three feet to go before he could've reached the door. How the hell then did he keep getting outside? Not only that, why did he keep running away from me every time he saw me if he wasn't stealing anything?

Was he some sort of wanted man? Okay, yeah, that might explain his apparent need to cover his fuckin' face, but that still didn't explain why he kept coming into the store OR how he was doing it, either. I mean, we had cameras, he DID know that, right? If he was on the run, he was essentially shooting himself in the foot by continuing to come into the store, wasn't he? Face covering or no, he was still there (at least, I *thought* he was) and he was still continuing to come in and run out, even using the same exact route through the store each time.

*Who IS this guy and what's his deal?* I was broken from my thoughts again by Frank, placing his hand on my shoulder. I whirled around and reared back -- *again*...

"Whoa, Christie, switch to--"

"Decalf?" The words honestly jumped from my mouth before I even realized it. A sort of knee-jerk reaction almost. Frank stared back at me, shocked.

"Uh... Y-Yeah, uh, I guess... Hey, wait who's--"

"Watching the front?" His eyes widened. That's when I realized something was very wrong here. I was dead on the money again. For the third time in a row, I'd just accurately predicted what he was going to say and when. Not only that, it was in the *EXACT SAME* spot as the last two fuckin' times.

*What in the hell is this?*

Frank was turning to head back into the office when I stopped him. "Wait!"

"Huh?" he asked, turning back around.

"Listen, have you noticed anything... I don't know, *off* lately?" His eyes glanced around for a moment before pursing his lips and shaking his head.

"Not really." he replied. "Well, outside if you abandoning the register when we still have another..." he paused and looked at his watch, "Two hours before we close up for the night."

"I-I'm sorry, just, I've been having to..." I stopped then, realization washing over me. "Hold on a second, did you just say we still had another two hours before closing?"

"Yeah... why?" His eyes were bugged out at me with his eyebrows raised.

"Show me." Hesitantly, he rotated his wrist to show me his watch. Sure enough, he was right. It was only 8:15. The same time it was when I first started to chase the guy. Now I was alarmed.

How had *no* time passed? The three times alone I wasted trying to catch the idiot should've *at least* burned through another 30 or maybe even 45 minutes, yet, not a single minute had passed apparently. I was speechless, staring doll-eyed in horror at Frank's watch. Frank must've seen the color draining from my face because the next thing he asked me was if I was feeling ill. I almost said yes, truth be told.

Instead, I looked up at him and replied that I was fine. "Listen um... Y-You think you could let me take a look at the cameras?" He stared quizzically at me. "I'll explain in the office, just please?"

"Uh... Sure, yeah, I guess." He tapped the button on his walkie and asked the other associate there, Harold, if he'd come up to the register while he and I were in the office. Harold replied, albeit not at all enthusiastically, that he would and I followed Frank into the office. Frank closed the door behind us and began pulling up the CCTV footage.

For about 15 minutes, Frank scrolled through the hours of footage until I stopped him where I'd see the guy walking in. "There!" I exclaimed, pointing at the screen. Frank froze the footage where the guy walked in. "That guy's been in and out of here several times now." I had him rewind the footage to prove my point.

"Huh..." he said.

"You see it, too, right?"

"Yeah, what the hell? How come you didn't say anything to him, especially with the hood on?"

"I *did,* Frank. Three times, and every time, he took off and vanished, watch." I took the keyboard (something I'm admittedly not supposed to do) and forwarded the footage up to the time I confronted him. The footage played and we watched where I'd confronted the guy and he took off. I then switched the cameras to the chemical and Pharmacy aisles where I kept losing him. This, however, is where things (somehow) got even weirder.

Not only did the guy just basically poof out of existence *on camera*, but that was also where the footage, across all feeds, ended. At 8:13 P.M.

I tried forwarding further, to show the fact that I'd been trying to chase him *3 times* now, but that was it. Everything stopped at 8:13 P.M.

"B-B-But..." I stammered, staring slack-jawed at the CCTV screen.

"What?" asked Frank.

"Wh-Why won't it go further? I... I chased the guy 3 different times!"

"Christie, hon," he began, sighing, "I think you've been working too many night shifts here."

"Don't patronize me, Frank, I know what I saw!" He held his hands up defensively. I kept mashing the forward button like a madman before I felt Frank's hand on my shoulders, stopping me. 

"Christie, honey, why don't you take an early night?" I looked at him. He looked confused, though obviously not as much as me. 

I exchanged glances between him and the monitor. "But... But... I'm telling you, I--"

"Christie..." he said, cutting me off, giving me a look that told me I wasn't gonna make my case any more believable by continuing to push it. I sighed then, slumping my shoulders and stepping away from the panel. 

"Go home, Christie, seriously, you've been working too hard." I nodded, grabbing up my purse and jacket. "I'll tell Jimmy that you got sick or had a family emergency or something. Me and Harold'll finish out the night." I nodded my head sullenly. 

If I'm gonna be perfectly honest, I likely wouldn't have minded the early pass to go home. He had a point, for one thing, about me working a lot of night shifts. He and I both knew Jimmy, the manager, himself probably would've told me the exact same thing in this instance. Another thing was that part of me wondered if maybe Frank was right, that maybe I really *was* just suffering from over exhaustion.

But of course, at the same time, I *knew* damn well that I wasn't. *Something* funky was going on here, and for some reason, it wasn't being picked up by Frank or even the cameras. Unfortunately, with no way of actually being able to *prove* this, I had no choice but to do as Frank said and punch the clock for the night. Frank and I walked out of the office and he split off to the right where he'd met me at before, toward the pet aisle, while I went back toward the front. 

As I was trudging dejectedly to the counter to the timeclock, I saw something that made me freeze and do a double-take. Harold wasn't at the counter. I ran over to look for him, thinking maybe he'd ducked down behind it or something. Nope. Nothing. 

"Harold?" I called out. Nothing. I buzzed my radio. "Harold, where are you?" 

Nothing. 

"Harold, where are you, you're supposed to be watching the--" I stopped. I almost didn't catch it. It was almost a split second thing that, had I not looked up right when I had, frantically looking for Harold, I'd have missed it. It was the guy again, walking hurriedly past the counter toward electronics. He hadn't made it further than maybe the other end of the front counter before I zipped out from around and ran for him. 

"Hey, you!" I called. He didn't stop. He was about to keep walking when I darted for him, roughly grabbing his shoulder. "Hey, I'm talking to you, goddamn--" 

I got no further though when I started to feel something tingling in my body. A strange, almost synthetic sort of supersonic vibration shooting through my hand that traveled all the way up my arm. This vibration then quickly became a sort of stinging sensation that screamed all throughout my body, inside and out. My entire body; skin, muscles, organs and all, all felt like it was being *liquefied!*

The process was excruciatingly painful, yet when I tried to scream, it felt that much more like my body was a piece of fuckin' paper that was being torn in half. I *did* scream, though, and it seemed to echo as if I were in a tunnel or something. Well, sorta.

It's confusing (and believe me, my fucking head hurts even now, writing about it here), but I guess the best way to describe it is to imagine screaming into a tunnel, like I mentioned before, but that tunnel then somehow splits itself in every direction both possible and impossible, with the sound still travelling through each of them endlessly as they do so. And then imagine that, not only do the tunnels *not* stop dividing in all directions, but the sounds within them start to then distort in every way both imaginable and unimaginable, all at the same time. *AND YOU HEAR THEM ALL, AT THE SAME TIME!*

I started to then *see* these sort of "tunnels", I guess I could call them. They were these clear, almost jelly looking funnels that twisted and wriggled as they constantly split apart within this dark expanse. I looked around, heart frozen in my chest. What the fuck *any* of this was, where it came from, *HOW* it came from, were questions I couldn't begin to muster any kind of willpower to try asking even myself. 

I watched as more of the "tunnels" diverged, each one making my scream sound less and less like me. Less and less *human*, in fact. I then looked down at my body. I was unharmed, despite being damn near certain I'd taken at least 1,000 firepokers simultaneously all over my body multiple times. When I went to move my hand, however, something even weirder happened. 

Similar to the way my screaming produced all these different "tunnels", the movement of my hand produced "tunnels" as well. This time, though, I saw *me* inside them. Each new and diverting "tunnel" had a version of me, bringing my hands up to my face and widening my eyes in pure shock. And just like the ones with the screams, these, too, appeared to have these images of "me" distort more and more with each new division. 

*Holy mother of Hell?!*

My frantic train of thoughts was further derailed when I then began to *hear* that very same thought. Yes, I said it, I *HEARD* my thought the same way I heard the scream and saw the actions with my hands. The same exact effect happened with my thoughts, too. Then, from... well, *somewhere* in the vast mix of nothing and everything around me, I could hear this deep, baritone voice blast out, cutting through (somehow) all of the other noises from the "tunnels" around me. 

**"Concentrate!"** the voice said. 

"C-C-*Concentrate?!"* I cried out, hysterical by this point. Like the scream, this, too, was painful to do, causing me to scream again. Both sounds then joined the neverending, ever-reaching junction of "tunnels" around me. 

**"Concentrate, Christie."** it replied.

*What the fuck?! How do they know my name?! WHO IS THIS?!*

More "tunnels" formed, each one distorting the internal questions -- some morphing them into different languages and others into not even languages at all, rather mumbles and grunts.

"Concentrate on *what?!*" I cried out painfully again. "What is this, where am I?!"

**"Concentrate!"** it bellowed. **"As long as you continue to panic, you will only create more divisions!"**

"Divisions? What are you talking about?!"

**"Look in front of you."** I did. **"What you're seeing are the microscopic divisions in time itself. With each movement, action, or thought you make, more divisions will occur, allowing for every possible way for said action, movement, or thought to be perceived."**

This was obviously the point where I learned the most unabridged, rawest definition of words like "confused", "lost", "flabbergasted", and "baffled". Being honest, after this experience, I actually spent time trying to *actually INVENT* a new word for such a thought or feeling. Thing is, and I kind of knew it then, too, such would just never accurately capture what it really was that I felt in that very moment, lost in whatever bizzarro Limbo or dimension I was in. 

*What the hell am I supposed to "Concentrate" on?!*

**"Where you were before all of this!"** bellowed the voice, probably having heard my thoughts as another "tunnel", or I guess "division" was created from them. 

"What? You mean like in the store?"

**"If that was where you were before you breached, yes."**

"Breached?" I asked, feeling no more knowledgeable than I had last time. "I... I don't--"

**"Just concentrate and you can re-enter your normal plane."** I stood there. I didn't know how I *could*  "concentrate". On anything.

For one thing, I had a hard enough time doing that *without* whatever the hell all this was going on around me. Another thing, I couldn't even *think* without *literally* hearing my own thoughts get jumbled up until they aren't even recognizable. *Then* there's the fact that I just *DIDN'T FUCKING UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON!*

**"You're not concentrating..."** chastised the voice. 

"I... I can't!" I closed my eyes and covered my ears. "I... I just... I can't, there's too much!"

**"You can do it, Christie. You must, else you'll continue to divide within here until you've atrophied into nothing."**

*"What?!"* I cried. That one, I believe, rang out the loudest and created more "divisions" than most, or all, of the others before it. This, of course, meant it was *that* much more impossible to focus or "concentrate" on a damn thing. 

**"You must clear your mind, Concentrating on where you were before and what led you to this moment."**

My breathing was panicked, my heart on the brink of just giving the fuck out by that point. Not only did I *not* know who the hell was talking to me or *what the hell* was going on, *how* the hell did I know that what they were talking about would even *work*?!

*They said if I didn't, though, that I'd be done for!* 

I closed my eyes again and took a deep breath. *Focus on where I was before, they said... What I was doing before...*

*(Where was I before?)*

I strained to remember. It was then that I began to feel a draining sensation spreading throughout my body. It wasn't *painful*, per say, but rather, it felt as though something was being taken out of me. The feeling of fading away. Atrophying. 

I was being *erased!*

*Concentrate! You panic now and you're fucked! Focus on where I was before...*

*(But where WAS I before?)*

*The store! I was in the store!*

*(What was I doing there, though?)*

My mind felt overheated, like a computer chip about to fry. Still, though, I kept my eyes shut tight. I tried to think about what exactly it was that I was actually doing in the store. I remembered I was... I was...

*(What was I doing?)*

*The time clock... I was about to clock out for the night...*

*(But why, though?)*

*Because Frank said I needed to. Said I'd been working too hard.*

*(What led to that, though?)*

*"You really ought to switch to--"*

"Decalf!" I said aloud unwittingly. I opened my eyes to see the divisions cease moving around in the black void. I could hear the sound of my voice *trying* to distort itself the way the others before it had, but seemingly was stuck or caught by something. From there, my memory of moments before flooded back to me, seemingly causing the distortions to go abruptly silent. 

The divisions twisted and knotted together before forming this bright ball in the center of the void. **"You've almost done it. Concentrate on the very moment that led you to here."** 

*Frank said to switch to Decalf...*

*(Why did he feel the need to say that?)*

*I kept running into him in front of the office...*

*(But what kept bringing me there?)*

*Because I kept chasing the....*

Then it hit me. The guy in the black hoodie! I kept running into Frank because I was chasing the guy in the hoodie who kept coming into the store and disappearing! My eyes opened then to see a glowing white sphere. The light from it wasn't so much bright, though, as it was spectral. It was glowing, yet I could look directly at it without it hurting my eyes at all. 

Everything was quiet. Everything was still. I brought my hands to my face again. I screamed and shouted again. Nothing happened. 

"Hey!" I called out. While I could see no one else was around me in the void I was in, I still kind of half expected the voice from before to reply somehow. Ironically enough, it still caught me a bit off guard when it actually *did.*

**"The breach is being sealed."** it thundered. 

"O-O-Okay..." I stuttered. I shook my head. "So, okay, can you tell me what the fuck's going on? I mean, I was just about to get off work when--"

**"Calm yourself."** it interjected. I took a deep breath while it continued. **"You stumbled into what is known to very,** ***very*** **few as a "Breach". A shift in the tapestry of time and dimension."**

This was the point in which both my mind and heart seemed to just freeze at the same time. I still manage to remember what it was he actually said to me, but I'd be damned if it made a lick of sense to me -- either back then OR now.

**"Time, you may or may not know, is a straight line. What most won't realize is that it, too, has dimensions to it. It's as three dimensional as the Earth itself. This, however. is something that's not typically seen by the ordinary eye. Also, like with the Earth's own crust, Time itself occasionally undergoes its own seismic shifts. When this happens, cracks will form and, on occasions, individuals like yourself end up slipping through these cracks and causing a breach to form."**

"Okay..." I replied hesitantly. "So then, how was this "shift" or whatever caused? I mean, there's a way to prevent them or predict them, right?"

**"Let me answer that with my own question. Can you prevent or determine the cause of an earthquake?"**

"N-No... I... I guess not, other than when something big causes the tectonic plates to shift, like construction equipment or something. And we have seismographs to at least tell us when it happens."

**"This is true, but now take that and apply it to this. Time is as natural a force as the elements. Therefore, it, too, undergoes its own processes that are beyond the abilities of mortal beings to control."**

I began to feel dizzy again. My vision on the orb blurred a bit. 

**"That,"** it continued, not noticing me, or at least not seeming to, **"Is why when you moved, made sounds or thought, the divisions were created. Further rips in the fabric of reality. It has that effect on those that cause a breach. It almost took you, too, as it has many others."**

"O-Othersss?" my tongue began to go numb. 

**"Yes, others who didn't make it out of the breach, much like the soul you were chasing earlier. And it would seem that it's made its mark on you as well."**

"Whaaah..."

**"Don't. You need to conserve what you have. The more energy you expend, the more of yourself you lose here in the breach. You've managed to calm it, but the shift is still in effect. Unfortunately, the effects it's already had on you are irreversible, but you can still come out of this with the rest of yourself intact."**

"Whaah do I hah tah do?" With each passing second, I felt like my body was having all of its innards sucked out through a straw or something. 

**"Come forward. Step into the orb, the sealed time breach. You'll be returned to the point you were when you slipped through the shift."**

I wanted to ask more questions, obviously. But I knew, at the same time, it was right (Who or whatever the hell *"It"* was -- God, I guess?), the longer I lingered in the void, the more of myself I continued to lose. With no other alternative, I went forward into the orb. As soon as my hand broke through, I saw, for a split second, the front of the store before a flash of white light splashed across my eyes. 

This time, I DID actually end up having to shield my eyes. In fact, this time it actually felt like my eyes were still burning even *after* they were closed as tightly as possible. Luckily, this lasted only about two or three seconds before I was able to open my eyes again to see that I was in front of the electronics aisle again. I looked around. The store looked normal enough.

I reached out and felt along the countertop of my register. It was solid, metallic, just like usual. I began to walk around. Everything was quiet, as quiet as it had been before, save for the god awful music that was playing over the radio. My legs were wobbly. I almost fell, managing to catch myself on the countertop. 

I stumbled then between the Pharmacy and chemical aisles. Everything looked fine. Everything was quiet. Everything was normal. 

I was back. 

I was startled again when I felt a hand rest on my shoulder frim behind me. I snapped around to find Frank. This time, when I reared back, it was a bit delayed. "Hey Christie, it's just me. It's time to close up." 

My face went from one of exhausted alarm to one of confusion. Seeing this, Frank held up his watch. It read 10:05. Harold came down from the pet aisle and walked past us to the office.

"Clooossiing tiiimme?" I slurred. He raised his eyebrows at me. 

"Yeah..." he said nervously, "You okay? You look pale." 

I didn't respond. Apparently, whatever look I had on my face spoke enough for me because the next thing I knew, he was telling me to take a couple of days off like he had before. This time, I accepted that invitation with no rebuttal, nor would I have challenged it if I DID have the energy to speak. 

It was during my little vacation from work that I was taken by my folks to see a neurologist. They ran several tests on me, extensively too, but in a few weeks still came back with the results that there was nothing wrong. When asked about my sudden lapse in energy or my difficulty in being able to speak, they suggested sudden onset of narcolepsy. They told me the best thing to help was a healthy diet, plenty of rest, and to not over-exert myself.

As you can imagine, none of that ever helped, then or now. I know, of course, why they don't, too. Whatever happened in that time shift or whatever, the "Breach", it's irreversible. It's all parts of my being that were distorted and erased.

In spite of all of this, my story does get a little better. I went back to work a few weeks later, with my time with the neurologist even allowing for paid medical leave, where I was assigned limited register duty, basically meaning *all* I'd have to do is stand at the register and look pretty. As well as this, I was granted extra break periods to not over exhaust myself. My studies had became a challenge for me, but I still managed to pass the semester with a decent enough average.

This was last year. I still have trouble trying to do a whole lot physically. At times, it feels like I've aged a lot more than I should've. Possibly literally. A few months after, I started noticing wrinkles and liver spots in certain places when I looked in the mirror. Over time, I noticed more and more of them progressively. Let's say this, when this incident happened, I was 27, looking more like 19 or 20. Now, I'm 28, looking closer to *38*. 

My folks (yes I'm still with them) think it may be some sort of stress. Thing is, I'm *not* stressed. Hell, things are easier for me now as they'd ever been, both at work, as well as with classes. 

No, it's not stress. It was one shift. The one night shift that almost wouldn't end, and one that almost ended me!
