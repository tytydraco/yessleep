*A man is watching TV in his apartment. Suddenly, loud cooing is heard.*

*The man is visibly frustrated, he quickly stands up and approaches the balcony.*

*He opens the balcony door and angrily shouts at the small group of pigeons.*

*The pigeons scatter instantly, but it seems like one of the pigeons is entangled in the messy  collection of fishing gear that the man keeps stored on the balcony.*

*The frightened bird tries it's best to get out of the fishing wire, nets and rods that are pinning it to the ground, but to no avail.*

*The man looks at the trapped animal, a malicious grin forms on his face.*

Man: That's what you get, bloody bastard! 

*The man leaves the struggling pigeon and closes the door, showing no empathy at all, he sits on his large sofa and continues watching TV.*

*A montage begins, the man is doing his usual daily routine while the trapped pigeon's frantic cooing is noticable in the background. Seemingly, days pass, the pigeon's desperate cooing is getting louder and louder, but the old man remains unbothered, he completely ignores the bird's cries for help.*

*After many days of struggle, the pigeon finally becomes completely silent.*

*He notices this almost immediately, then gets a trash bag and opens the balcony door.*

*He is met with a surprise, instead of finding the corpse of the unfortunate pigeon, he finds nothing more than his fishing gear.*

*He shuffles through the fishing gear, but the pigeon is nowhere to be seen.*

*He scratches the back of his head in confusion, then he exits the balcony and starts watching TV once again.*

*As soon as he sits on the sofa, he hears two light knocks on the window.*

*He turns around and looks at the balcony window.*

*He notices a unusual dark-colored pigeon pecking at the window, the pigeon seems to be completely black, except for it's large blood-red eyes.*

*The man approaches the window and quickly knocks on it to try and scare the pigeon away, but instead of flying away, the bird just slightly turns it's head and looks directly at the man.*

*He awkwardly stares at the pigeon for a good minute while trying to scare it away, he shouts and knocks on the window, but the bird doesn't move or make a sound, it's bloody eyes continue staring at the man.*

*His patience seems to be thinning, as he grabs a fly swatter off the table, with the long fly swatter in hand, he opens the balcony door and immediately forcefully hits the pigeon with the large fly swatter.*

*Surprisingly, the dark pigeon is completely unfazed, once again, it just turns it's head slowly and looks the man straight in the eyes.*

*The anger on the man's face is quickly replaced with a look of absolute fear.*

*He quickly exits the balcony, closes and locks the door behind him, then quickly shuts the blinds of the balcony windows.*

*Visibly disturbed by the unwanted visitor, he goes to the bathroom and washes his face.*

*While washing his face, he hears another knock, instinctively, he looks at the bathroom window and sees the same dark pigeon staring at him with it's bulging eyes.*

*He quickly shuts the blinds once again and exits the bathroom.*

*Another montage begins.*

*The man is once again doing his usual daily routine, the scenes are similar to the last montage, but this time, the man is visibly uneasy. The uncanny dark pigeon is standing at the window of every room the man enters, he is trying to ignore the pigeon's gaze, but to no avail.*

*Finally, the man seems to have had enough. He shuts the blinds of every window in his home.*

*While trembling in fear, he sits down and turns on the TV, his hands are shaking so much that he can barely even hold the TV remote.*

*Suddenly a loud sound of glass breaking is heard.*

*The man gets up and slowly approaches the bathroom.*

*He cautiously opens the door of the bathroom.*

*Inside the bathroom, on top of the shattered glass, stands a tall dark creature.*

*The massive birdlike creature is easily as large as the man, it is covered in feathers that look more like greasy dark fur, it's legs are long and muscular. Overgrown, sharp talons are protruding from the creature's toes. The sinister creature's beak is oddly similar to a toucan's, the only difference being it's charcoal black color.*

*Without warning, the creature looks the man in the eyes, he immediately notices something that makes him scream in terror, the creature's eyes look like a pair of bloody marbles, exactly like the dark pigeon's eyes did.*

*The man starts to run, the creature immediately follows him, matching his pace with ease.*

*He tries to exit his home, but the creature quickly stands in front of the main door.*

*With his only exit now blocked, he desperately enters the living room.*

*He quickly rushes to the balcony, his mix of rashness and fear overwhelm him as he trips and falls on the hard balcony floor, a loud crack is heard as his head hits the ground.*

*The man looks like he's badly hurt, he doesn't seem to be able to get up and his speech has been reduced to pained moaning.*

*The disturbing creature approaches the crippled man, as the man slowly loses conciousness, the creature looks him in the eyes for one final time.*
*TAPE ENDS.*

*Just like I did last time, I quickly swap the tape with the next one.*

*Tape 5: Eripmav, begins.*
