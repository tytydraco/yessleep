I first stumbled across the 24-hour convenience store on a late-night drive home from work. I was exhausted, barely keeping my eyes open, and I just needed a quick break. When I saw the flickering neon sign in the distance, I thought it would be the perfect place to stop. It looked rundown, but it was open, and I needed something to keep me awake for the long drive ahead. The gravel crunched under my tires as I pulled in, and the cold night air felt like a slap to my face.

The store was small, almost claustrophobic, with flickering lights that cast a sickly yellow hue over everything. I stepped inside, the door creaking loudly behind me. The shelves were crammed with old, dusty items—snacks, drinks, but nothing of interest. The place smelled stale, like something had been rotting in the back for years.

Behind the counter was a man. His skin was unnaturally pale, stretched tight over his bones, and his eyes... his eyes were wide, unblinking, glowing faintly in the dim light. He was staring at me in a way that made my stomach turn. I tried to shake it off. Maybe he was just an odd guy. I walked to the back, grabbed a bottle of soda, and headed to the counter to pay.

"Can I help you?" he asked, his voice slow, deliberate, almost too slow. The words dragged, like he wasn’t used to speaking at all.

"Yeah, just this," I said, my voice a little too loud, trying to break the tension. I set the bottle down in front of him, feeling his eyes on me the entire time. It was like he was looking at me—no, studying me.

“Long drive?” he asked, his voice even slower now, like he had all the time in the world.

“Yeah,” I said, trying to ignore the rising unease in my chest. “Just need something to keep me awake.”

His smile didn’t reach his eyes. “You’re sure you’ll be okay? You won’t fall asleep?”

I laughed nervously, but something in his tone made my blood run cold. It was as if he knew something—knew that I wouldn’t be okay.

I handed him the money, and his fingers were so cold, so clammy. I recoiled a little, but he didn’t let go immediately. He just kept smiling, watching me with that disturbing, unblinking gaze.

“Goodnight, Charlotte,” he said, his voice soft, almost a whisper.

My blood ran cold. I hadn’t told him my name.

I didn’t say anything, just grabbed my things and hurried out. The moment the door shut behind me, I felt an overwhelming sense of relief. I could breathe again. But as I stepped into the parking lot, something felt off. The night air was thick, heavier than before. And when I glanced back at the store, I could’ve sworn the sign flickered differently, the words bending slightly, like they were changing. The letters of “24 Hours” twisted in on themselves, as though they were alive.

I didn’t think much of it, though. I was tired. I was scared. And I just wanted to leave.

I drove home, trying to forget the weird encounter, but when I turned onto the street where the store should’ve been, I froze.

The lot was empty.

There was nothing. No store, no sign. Just an empty stretch of gravel, overgrown with weeds. I drove past it, then stopped, reversing slowly, hoping maybe I had just missed it, maybe I had taken a wrong turn. But there was no sign of the 24-hour shop. It was as if it had never existed.

I parked on the side of the road, staring at the empty lot, my heart racing. I got out of the car, approaching the place where the store should’ve been. My mind was racing, trying to come up with an explanation. Maybe I was just imagining it. Maybe I’d gotten lost. But the ground was wrong. The weeds were thick and tangled, like they hadn’t been disturbed in years. And the soil… it looked disturbed, like something had been buried beneath the surface.

Then I heard it.

A soft creak, like the sound of a door opening. But there was no door here. No building. I spun around, my heart pounding, but there was no one. Only the empty lot, and the whisper of the wind.

“Charlotte…”

The whisper was faint, almost too quiet to hear. But it was unmistakable. It was the man’s voice—the voice from the store. My blood ran cold, my legs shaking beneath me.

“Charlotte… it’s never too late…”

The voice was closer now, almost in my ear. I turned, but the empty lot was still just that—empty. I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck stand up, my breath shallow. My mind raced, trying to piece together what was happening. I wasn’t imagining this. I wasn’t.

I ran back to the car, my heart hammering in my chest, and slammed the door shut. My hands were trembling as I started the engine, the tires screeching as I peeled out of the gravel lot. But even as I drove away, the whispers followed me.

“Never too late, Charlotte.”

I tried to forget about it. I tried to convince myself that I had imagined the whole thing. But every time I passed that road, I couldn’t stop myself from looking for the store. And no matter how many times I drove past, it was always the same. The lot was empty. The store was gone.

And then one night, I drove past again—just to be sure. Just to prove to myself that I hadn’t lost my mind.

But this time, the lot was different.

There was a sign. Just a small, simple one, nestled between the trees at the edge of the field. It wasn’t glowing. It wasn’t buzzing. But it was there.

"The 24-hour convenience store."

I slammed on the brakes, my heart stopping in my chest. I couldn’t look away. I couldn’t move. And then, from the shadows, I saw him—the man- standing in the doorway of the store. His smile, wide and cold, stretched unnaturally across his face.

“Charlotte…” he whispered, though his voice was a roar in my mind. “It’s time to come inside.”

The 24 hour store had closed 7 years ago. That's what I heard,at least.

Then in which store did I step into that night?

I could've sworn I saw the flickering lights, the small store with the yellowish lights, and the man . The man, whose smile still haunts me to this day. The man, who knew my name , despite me not ever telling him.
