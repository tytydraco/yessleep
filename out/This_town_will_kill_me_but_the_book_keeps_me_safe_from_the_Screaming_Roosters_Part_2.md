I wish I never came here, to the town of Fredericksburg. The roads are like ebony in the night, and the town doesn’t operate like a town should.

Thankfully, I managed to obtain the book before the moon rose and became my world. It details dos and don’ts — what I need to do before the moon blinks and pitch blackness falls upon the town.

While the book references these creatures as Helpmouths, they're nothing more but roosters to me. Like clockwork, an hour before the moon rises, and an hour before the moon blinks, they start to scream into the night. Sometimes it's a woman scream, maybe a man's scream, but what never changes is the type of people screaming. This morning it was my mother, begging for help outside, asking where her son is, why her son isn't there helping his poor old mother out. She would cry about being hurt, being alone, begging to know where I am. Hearing my mother weep, telling me how she’ll be waiting, no longer how long it takes, she’ll wait for me to come home.

Looking out the window towards the street in front of my new "home" I can see a dozen of them. Long sickly bodies, feet scraping against the asphalt as they trudge along. I wish they had normal heads, at least I'd be able to see my mother, father, brothers... my family again, but instead of a head there is only a gaping V-shaped maw of vocal chords, slimy and pulsating, turning and vibrating each time they scream. I can still hear the hardened droplets of blood raining out of them, almost like hail as it hits the ground. As the scream ends, their bodies jolt and pulsate, as if there's a creature within trying to escape.

While creepy, and a good imitation of my mother, it's hard to fall for when what seems to be a dozen of my mother are screaming for my help outside. The book says they're "designed" to bait you outside, kidnap you, and bring you into the sewer systems under the town. They'll mimic anyone from your memory you're fond of in the attempt to get you closer.

Used to terrify me with how much they knew, hell it chills you to the bone when you hear them talking about how much they love you, how much they miss you, to give up hope and come home. But now, they serve as alarm clocks for me, they let me know when the day is about to start, and when the day is about to end. In the mornings they’re tolerable, though I gotta watch for them in the streets in the evenings, they’re like loud deer, but possibly far more mentally disabled.

A few mornings ago something changed, only one came out begging for help with the voice of a chick I met back in college. A bitch through and through, screaming about how her legs are broken, how the towns folk keep coming out of the houses to shush her. An interesting way to deceive me, but it won't be that easy to get me outside while it's dark. Though the screams as the towns folk tear off her lips to shut her up was damn convincing.

This morning I did find a surprise after the screaming roosters left, etched into the porch was "Stay vigilant and trust the book. It sounds like your survival depends on it. For the first time in a long time, I stood there frozen. Someone, or something, etched this into the porch, though my shock was short lived. Weird things happen around here all the time, text appears everywhere around the town, sometimes it’s good advice, sometimes it’s compliments, most of the time it doesn’t make any sense. Stepping over it I sigh, guess I'll explore more of the town today, there's so much to the damn place, but the location of the buildings change every now and then. The book does mention a church somewhere in town with answers to where I am. Hopefully today I can find tit, while not Christian, I would like some reading material that doesn’t come from the resident at the gas station, and what church doesn’t have a bible somewhere in it?
