As we pull onto my street in the quiet Clairemont neighborhood of San Diego, the sight that greets us sends a shiver down my spine. The front door of my house is not just open; it's torn off its hinges, lying in a shattered heap on the front lawn. The windows are dark, the interior swallowed up by an ominous shadow that seems to pulse with a life of its own.

"Fuck!" I mutter, pulling the cruiser to a sharp stop. Audrey's already at the trunk, her hands steady as she pulls out a couple of tactical flashlights and our backup weapons—a pair of Glock 22s we'd stashed for emergencies.

We make our entry, the beam of our flashlights slicing through the suffocating darkness of the living room. The house feels unnaturally silent, like it's holding its breath. As I step over the threshold, the splintered wood of the door frame crunches under my boots.

The living room is in chaos—furniture overturned, cushions slashed, family pictures lie in tattered heaps on the floor. A sharp pang hits me as I spot a small, framed photo of Rocío and the boys, the glass cracked but their smiles still bright under the jagged lines.

My flashlight catches something else on the floor—dark, thick droplets that lead towards the hallway. Blood. A lot of it. My stomach knots as I follow the trail, each drop a grim breadcrumb leading deeper into the nightmare.

The overhead light flickers sporadically, casting quick flashes of light over the scene—a grim strobe effect that reveals more splashes of blood, and worse, small, drag marks as if someone had been pulled.

My mind reels back to the Vázquez case. Memories of the screams, the gunfire, and the blood smeared across cold concrete flash through my mind.

We follow the trail of blood to our bedroom, the dread in my gut twisting tighter with each step. The door is ajar, and as I push it open, the scene inside makes my heart stop.

The bedroom looks like a tornado tore through it. The windows are shattered, sheets tangled and shredded, while dresser drawers hang open, their contents strewn across the floor. But none of that compares to what lies on the bed.

There’s a body—a sight so grotesque it takes a few seconds for my brain to even process what I’m seeing. The figure is laid out almost reverently, arms and legs spread, pinned down by shards of broken glass and splintered wood.

The body’s face is... gone. Skin and muscle torn away, leaving only the gleaming white bone of the skull staring back. The eyes are missing—hollow, empty sockets that feel like they’re looking through me. And the hands—Christ, the hands are gone, severed at the wrists, leaving bloody stumps soaking the bed in a ritualistic display.

My flashlight trembles in my hand as I take a step closer to the body, dread gnawing at my insides. Every instinct is screaming at me to turn away, to leave, but I can't. I have to know if it’s Rocio.

I force myself to look closer. My mind races, trying to piece together the details that don’t add up. Then it hits me like a freight train. This body—this poor, mutilated body—isn’t Rocío. It’s too small.

The realization floods in all at once. Sofía.

Sofía, the young Colombian au pair we'd hired to help with the kids. The girl had just started working for us not even two months ago.

The recognition brings no real comfort, just a shift in the dread that has been tightening around my heart. I stagger back, my stomach turning, and I grip the doorframe to steady myself.

Just then, a soft rustle from the hallway shatters the silence, pulling my attention away from the grisly sight on the bed. My heart pounds against my ribcage as a sick sense of dread fills the room. The rustle transforms into a low, crackling chuckle that seems to echo from every corner of the room, clawing its way under my skin in the worst possible way.

Audrey grabs my arm, her grip tight. "Ramón, behind you!"

I spin around, gripping the Glock tighter as its flashlight beam swings towards the door. The sight that greets me robs me of comprehension. Framed by the splintered door, peering out from the darkness of the hallway, is an abomination.

The thing is wearing Sofía’s face like a sick mask, her features stretched across its bony skull in a macabre grin that drips with dark, oozing blood.

As it notices our stares, the creature begins to move, or rather, contort. With a fluidity that defies human anatomy, it starts a crab walk, its limbs bending unnaturally as it scuttles toward us. The movement is jerky, accompanied by the sickening sound of cracking bones and the wet slap of its limbs against the hardwood floor.

The creature's twisted advance triggers something primal within me. Every ounce of fear I have morphs into a murderous rage. My home, my sanctuary, has been violated; my family threatened. This abomination before me, wearing Sofia's face like a trophy, ignites a fury so raw, so potent, it almost blinds me.

But I don’t shoot. I need it to talk, if it even can. So, with a guttural yell, I charge.

My instincts take over. I leap forward, slamming into the creature with all the force I can muster. The impact sends us crashing back into the hallway, the entity's form undulating under me. It's an explosion of fury, all punches and elbows, fueled by a desperate need to protect what's left of my family.

I seize it by the shoulders, slamming it against the wall with a force that knocks nearby picture frames from the wall.

Audrey isn’t far behind. Grabbing a heavy bookend from a nearby shelf, she swings with all her might. The object connects with a sickening thud against the thing's head, sending it reeling.

I grab a broken curtain rod, its jagged end sharp and splintered. Without hesitation, I plunge it into the creature’s chest. It lets out a guttural screech, writhing violently as I press harder, driving the makeshift spear deeper. Its movements become frantic, limbs flailing in unnatural angles, but the rod holds firm.

A howl erupts from its twisted mouth—a high-pitched, inhuman screech that reverberates through the hallway.

The thing flails, but I hold firm, pinning it against the wall as dark, viscous blood spills from the wound, pooling at our feet. Its hands claw weakly at me.

I twist the rod deeper, ignoring the splintering of bone, my voice a low growl as I lean close to its deformed face. "Where is my family? What have you done with them?" I demand, each word punctuated with a twist of the rod.

The creature, pinned and writhing, coughs up a grotesque mixture of blood and something darker, its eyes flickering with a malevolent light. It speaks in a stilted Spanish, each word dropping like stones from its mouth. "Traición... conocemos... tu traición..." (Betrayal... we know... your betrayal...)

My grip on the curtain rod tightens, the metal biting into my palms. "¿Qué traición? ¿Dónde está mi familia?” (What betrayal? Where’s my family?) The creature's voice is raspy and oddly robotic. "Conocemos la verdad de Vásquez... Traicionaste a todos..." (We know the truth about Vásquez... You betrayed everyone...)

I’m thrown off guard. “¿Qué demonios sabes sobre el caso Vázquez?” (What the fuck do you know about the Vazquez case?) I hiss.

“Mentiras... mentiras... todos saben... Castillo el traidor..." (Lies... lies... everyone knows... Castillo the traitor...) The creature's words come out garbled, like a parrot regurgitating phrases it doesn't understand.

The weight of the creature’s words hits me like a physical blow.

I’d been embedded with the cartel in order to gain their trust. Officially, my role was to relay critical information back to the Sheriff’s Department, to bring down one of the largest drug operations funneling into the Southwest.

The Vazquez case was supposed to be a straightforward operation: intercept a massive shipment of drugs and weapons moving through the border, and if possible, take down the infamous Sinaloa Cartel boss, Manuel “El Don” Vásquez. But things had gone sideways, fast. It had ended in a disastrous shootout, with bodies of agents and cartel members alike scattered across a warehouse on the outskirts of Chula Vista.

The creature laughs, a horrifying, gurgling sound. "La reina sabe… Los juegos terminan hoy… Castillo… el soplón." (The queen knows… The games end today… Castillo… the rat.)

Its words cut deeper than any physical wound could, unraveling years of buried secrets. The revelation shatters the last vestige of restraint in me. “¿Cómo sabes sobre eso? ¿Quién eres?” (How do you know about that? Who are you?)

For years, I lived a double life. To everyone else, I was Detective Ramón Castillo, a straight-laced cop, a family man who did the job by the book. But beneath that facade, I was something else entirely—a ghost in the machine.

I wasn’t just a dirty cop taking bribes or looking the other way when drugs hit the streets. I was something far more dangerous—a mole, embedded deep within the Sheriff's Department from the very beginning. Hand-picked by Don Manuel himself to be his eyes and ears, to infiltrate law enforcement, and feed them just enough to stay one step ahead of the feds, the DEA, and anyone else trying to bring him down.

I’ve got a thousand questions running through my head, all of them colliding with the weight of what the creature just said. But none of that matters right now. Not the past. Not the mess I’ve been trying to cover up for years. My family is all I care about.

I twist the curtain rod deeper, my breath coming out in ragged bursts as I glare down at the monstrous thing. Its misshapen body writhes in pain, but there’s no humanity in its eyes. It’s like looking into a void—a cold, endless void. “¿Dónde están mi esposa y mis hijos?” (Where the fuck are my wife and sons?) I growl, my voice barely recognizable, even to myself.

"Si quieres volver a verlos..." it rasps, blood bubbling at the corners of its mouth, "debes devolver la Daga de la Santa Muerte al Dispersador de Cenizas..." (If you want to see them again, you must return the Dagger of Holy Death to the Scatterer of Ashes...)

The Scatterer of Ashes. The words hit me like a freight train. That name again, the same one Lucia Alvarez had whispered in her dying breath. My mind races. What dagger? But ultimately these words mean nothing to me.

“¿De qué demonios estás hablando? ¡No tengo ninguna maldita daga!” (What the hell are you talking about? I don’t have any damn dagger!) My voice cracks as I slam the creature back against the wall, fury clouding my thoughts. I need answers—real ones. “¡Dime dónde están!” (Where are they?)

It only continues, its voice a broken, monotone chant. "El Dagger fue tomado. Robado. Pero debe ser devuelto. O sus almas serán cenizas en el viento." (The dagger was taken. Stolen. But it must be returned. Or their souls will be ashes in the wind.)

As I stare down at the creature, struggling to keep my anger from boiling over, it starts to make a guttural sound, a hacking cough that I think might be its last breath. But no—its mouth opens wider, blood and bile dripping from its lips as it begins to spit out something else.

Numbers. A garbled string of numbers. “32…7947… 116… 9625…”

The thing repeats the digits like a broken record, over and over again, its voice a raspy wheeze.

I slam it against the wall again, the jagged rod still pinning it in place. “¿Crees que estoy jugando? Dime dónde está mi familia o te haré pedazos—" (You think I’m playing around? Tell me where my family is, or I’ll rip you apart—”

“Ramón, wait!” Audrey’s voice cuts through the chaos, urgent but calm. She’s clutching her phone, her face pale but focused. “Those numbers... I think they're coordinates. It’s giving us something.”

My grip slackens slightly as Audrey’s words sink in. Coordinates. A location. This could be where they’re holding Rocío and the boys. It could also be a trap, but it’s all we have.

Realizing I’m not going to get anything more coherent from the creature, I turn to Audrey. “Did you get those coordinates?”

She nods, her expression grim as she taps her phone, saving the numbers.

With one final, guttural roar, I drive the curtain rod all the way through, impaling the creature fully against the wall. The force of the impact sends a spider web of cracks through the plaster, dust cascading down like a grim snowfall.

The creature's body spasms violently, a puppet jerking on unseen strings. Its mouth opens in a silent scream, the stretched, mangled semblance of Sofia's face distorting into something even more nightmarish. The room fills with a sickening, squelching noise as the body begins to disintegrate.

Bits of its flesh start sloughing off in wet, heavy clumps, hitting the floor with sickening plops. The blood—dark and too thick—pours out in torrents, pooling at the base of the wall in a viscous, spreading stain. The smell is unbearable, a putrid mix of decay and something bitter and burnt that fills the air and coats the inside of my throat.

As the creature completely disintegrates, it leaves behind nothing but the sagging, empty skin that once belonged to Sofía. The skin, paper-thin and now drained of life, peels away from the wall like a deflated balloon. It slumps to the floor in a crumpled heap, the seams of flesh ragged and torn as though it had been hastily stitched together only to be discarded.

I’m standing there, breathing hard, the jagged curtain rod still in my hand, dripping with whatever the hell that thing was made of. My mind is racing, trying to make sense of the creature’s last words, the numbers, the coordinates. Everything is spinning out of control.

Audrey's hand grips my shoulder, yanking me back just as my vision starts to blur with anger. “Ramón!” she shouts.

I step away from the mess, wiping my hands on my pants out of reflex, even though I know there's no getting rid of the stain this day has left.

“How the hell did it know about Vásquez?” Audrey finally asks, her voice cutting through the thick air. “How did it know about what we did?”

Audrey's question hangs in the air, and I can’t avoid the look she’s giving me. The department had its suspicions about me being a cartel plant for a long time, but they never had enough evidence to pin me down. Instead, they assigned Audrey, the golden girl of the force, to keep tabs on me. She was clean, too clean.

At first, it was all business—long shifts, stakeouts, and her doing her job by the book. But things got messy.

After her nasty divorce, I could see the cracks in Audrey's usual tough facade. She was vulnerable, raw, and it didn’t take much to… influence. Late nights led to beers, then talks. I tested her, dropped hints, and when she didn’t report it, I knew she was slipping.

Then we started fucking. Once that line was crossed, it got easier to pull her in. She let things slide, fed the department false reports. It was subtle at first—small lies buried in paperwork—but by the time the Vásquez case blew up, she was too deep. We both were.

Audrey’s standing there, waiting for an answer, but the truth is, I don’t have one. Not one that makes sense, anyway. Everything feels off—like we’re playing a game we don’t understand, and someone else is pulling the strings.

My mind races, piecing together fragments of conversations, half-heard rumors, and that nagging feeling I’ve had for months—maybe years.

“Look, Audrey,” I start, keeping my voice low but serious. “There’s something bigger at play here. This... thing, whatever the hell it was, it knew too much. About Vásquez, about me, about us.”

She raises an eyebrow, clearly skeptical but willing to hear me out. "You think it was a setup?"

I nod, running a hand through my hair, still sticky with sweat and grime. "Barrett was way too quick to throw us under the bus, don’t you think? First sign of trouble and we’re suspended, no questions asked. And Torres? She couldn’t get out of here fast enough. She’s washing her hands of this whole thing like she knew it was coming."

Audrey looks at me skeptically. “Wait? You think the captain and sheriff are involved?”

I press on, my thoughts racing. “Think about it, Audrey. Rocío calls 911, panicking because someone’s outside our house—someone watching, waiting. And what happens? Nothing. The police are ‘too busy’ to respond to a cop’s wife in distress? That’s some bullshit!”

Audrey is staring at me, her expression unreadable. I know what she’s thinking—I can see it in her eyes. She’s wondering if she can trust me. And hell, I don’t even know the answer myself. But one thing’s clear: we can’t trust anyone in the force anymore. Not after this.

As though to drive home my point, the distant sound of police sirens pierces the air. They're coming for us.

"Shit," I mutter under my breath. "We need to move. Now."

We move fast, slipping through the back of the house and out into the yard. I glance toward my cruiser parked out front. We can’t take it—that’s the first thing they’ll be looking for. I grab my laptop and some gear from the cruiser, shoving them into a duffel bag.

The flashing lights are closer now, the distant wail of sirens growing louder with each passing second. My eyes dart toward my neighbor's driveway. Dave’s old Chevy Tahoe sits there.

I remember overhearing Dave mention last week that his family was headed out of town for vacation. The car won’t be reported missing for at least a couple days.

“Stay low,” I whisper to Audrey as we make our way to the SUV, ducking behind bushes and fences. We reach the Tahoe, and I jimmy the lock open with a practiced move. Hotwiring cars isn’t something I’m proud of knowing, but in moments like this, I’m damn grateful for the skill.

“Sorry, Dave,” I mutter under my breath, promising myself I’ll return the vehicle once this nightmare is over. If I make it out of this.

The engine roars to life, and we’re off, slipping away before the first patrol car rounds the corner.

We know exactly where to go—the safe house, miles outside the city, buried deep in the desert hills where no one asks questions and fewer people give answers. Only Audrey and I know about it, a just in case shit ever hit the fan.

—

We pull up to the rundown cabin just as the sun begins to dip below the horizon, casting long shadows across the desert.

I kill the engine and step out into the cooling air, my boots sinking into the soft dirt. Audrey follows, her face pale and drawn, but her eyes are sharp, constantly scanning the horizon for any sign we’ve been followed.

The cabin isn’t much to look at—a single-story shack, barely holding itself together, with peeling paint and windows that rattle in the wind. But it’s got one thing going for it: no one knows we’re here.

We make a quick sweep of the place, checking every corner, every window. Satisfied that we’re alone, I head to the small utility room in the back and fire up the generator. The old machine sputters to life, filling the cabin with a low, steady hum and bathing the room in dim, flickering light from a single overhead bulb.

Audrey sinks into one of the worn-out chairs by the small kitchen table, cradling her injured arm. Blood has soaked through the dressings. I grab the first-aid kit from the duffel bag and kneel beside her.

“This is gonna sting,” I warn, pulling out a bottle of antiseptic. She just nods, her jaw clenched.

I work quickly, cleaning the wound and wrapping it with fresh gauze. As I finish, she looks up at me with those green eyes.

“Your turn,” she says, nodding toward my shoulder, where blood has soaked through my jacket from the cut I got back at the chapel. I don’t protest; there’s no point. I pull off my shirt, revealing the mess underneath—not just the wound, but everything else.

Her eyes trace the tattoos that cover my torso—intricate, black patterns swirling across my chest, down my arms, and over my back. Symbols, dates, names.

There’s the black scorpion crawling up my ribs—a mark of my loyalties to the Sinaloa. But that’s not the one that catches her attention. It’s the other tattoo, the one just below it: a small skull with a thin blue line running through it. The mark of a cop killer. It’s not the first time she’s seen it, but this time, but this time it feels more visceral.

Her fingers tremble slightly as she redresses the wound on my shoulder. Once Audrey finishes with the bandage, she sits back in the creaky chair. "So... what now?" she asks.

I take a moment to compose my thoughts. One thing’s for sure. I’m not playing their game. Whoever’s behind this... they want me to follow their little script like a good little pawn. But I’m not about to let some fucking psycho dictate how this ends.

“We go rogue,” I say, straightening up. “We find my family, we get them safe, and then... we hunt the bastards behind this and make them fucking pay. All of them.” She nods in solidarity. “Okay, let’s get to work.”

We get to work fast, turning the cabin into a makeshift war room. The table is covered in papers—maps, printouts of the coordinates, and anything we can pull from the limited info we have. I thank God the Wi-Fi still works, even if it’s spotty. The satellite dish on the roof is old, but it’ll do for now.

I turn on my laptop, pulling up satellite images of the coordinates the creature spit out. My fingers tremble as I type in the coordinates. The numbers flash on the screen: Latitude: 32.7947, Longitude: -116.9625.

Audrey stands next to me, peering over my shoulder. “Where is it?” she asks.

“El Cajon,” I mutter, my thumb scrolling through the map. The dot lands near an industrial part of town east of San Diego, not too far from where the highways intersect. I zoom in on the satellite view, my brow furrowing as I try to make sense of the location.

Audrey leans over. “That’s where they’re keeping your family?”

“No, that’s where they want us to go.” My voice is quiet but firm. “An industrial zone, surrounded by empty lots and abandoned warehouses. Multiple entry points, but no clear exits. It's perfect for an ambush.”

Looking closer at the coordinates the creature gave, something feels off. There’s a small detail on the satellite map that stands out—a patch of land that doesn’t quite fit. Among the sprawling industrial area, there’s an unusually large swath of undeveloped land.

"See that?" I point at the spot. Audrey leans in closer, squinting at the screen. "What about it?"

“No structures, no roads leading in or out—just an open field surrounded by factories and warehouses. It doesn’t make sense for a prime spot like that to be empty,” I say, furrowing my brow.

I swiped through some more satellite images, zooming in on the area from different angles. That’s when something weird stood out—a subtle change in elevation around the edge of the empty land.

“Look at this,” I said, tapping the screen. “The terrain dips in around the edges here. It’s like the ground’s hollow.”

Audrey frowned. “You think it’s built over something?”

“Could be,” I replied, leaning back, my brain churning through possibilities. “A bunker maybe, or an underground tunnel system. Something’s going on under there, that’s for sure.”

We spend the next half hour combing through public records, land surveys, and old building permits. At first, it seems like a dead end. Everything shows the area has been zoned for industrial use but never developed. No permits, no environmental assessments—nothing.

But then Audrey stumbled on a curious document buried in the city’s geological surveys. “Wait a second,” she said, her finger hovering over the screen. “This whole area sits on top of an aquifer.”

“An aquifer? Why would that matter?” I ask, my interest piqued.

“Well, aquifers are natural underground reservoirs of water,” she explains. “But here’s the kicker—this particular aquifer has been marked off-limits for drilling or development since the 1980s. Apparently, it’s one of the main sources of freshwater for parts of San Diego County. Anything that disturbs it could cause major contamination.”

“So no one could build on it,” I mutter, rubbing my chin. “But that doesn’t mean something isn’t under it.”

We exchanged looks. This can be the perfect place to hide something. If there’s a network of tunnels or caves down there, it could be completely invisible from above ground.

After some digging, we find a few old utility reports that hint at the existence of storm drains and maintenance tunnels that have been sealed off decades ago. One report in particular catches our attention—a sewer line that has been rerouted, with its original access points marked as "decommissioned" near the coordinates we’re looking at.

“Bingo,” I say, tapping the screen. “This is our way in.”

Audrey and I sit there, staring at the laptop screen as if the dots will magically connect themselves. The coordinates, the aquifer, the sealed tunnels—it’s all adding up to something, but there’s still that damn missing piece.

"What do you think the dagger is about, exactly?" Audrey asks, breaking the silence. She sounds as exasperated as I feel.

I let out a sigh, rubbing my temples. "I don't know, but I think it ties back to the Vásquez case. We both knew that sting was messed up from the start."

My mind runs through the events of that night. “Remember how on edge the Cartel was? They were whispering about something big, something more valuable than anything they’d ever smuggled before. It wasn’t just the usual haul of narcotics and AKs.”

“Yeah, they were talking in hushed tones about ‘la reliquia.’” (the relic) Audrey adds. “It has to be connected.”

“There’s only one way to know for sure,” I nod, already reaching for my jacket. “We have to talk to [Vásquez](https://new.reddit.com/r/PageTurner627Horror/comments/1cu31vv/broken_dawn/) [himself](https://new.reddit.com/r/PageTurner627Horror/comments/1bg4l0g/i_found_out_why_my_dad_never_talked_about_his/).”
