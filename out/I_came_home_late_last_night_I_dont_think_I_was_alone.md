 I am a woman who lives alone.

People often ask why I’m still unmarried even though I’m young.

I don’t care about that. I’m used to being by myself, and I’m fine with that choice.
I work an office job. 

Every morning, I usually walk to work because it’s less than two kilometers from the place I rent.

I love breathing in the early morning air—clean and quiet, as if the entire city hasn’t fully woken up yet.

Everything was normal… until that fateful night.


The night before, I forgot to set my alarm.
When I woke up the next morning, panic hit me I had exactly fifteen minutes to get to work. I skipped breakfast and rushed out the door.

My usual route was blocked due to construction. Even pedestrians weren’t allowed near the area.

With no other choice, I turned into a small nearby alley. And that was the biggest mistake of my life.

That evening, I didn’t get off work until nearly eight. Because I arrived late that morning, I was punished by being forced to stay overtime.

On my way home, I remembered that the main road was still closed, so once again, I chose to go through the same alley from earlier that day.

The alley was dark.
Although there were a few solar-powered lights, their glow was weak barely enough to illuminate the length of the path.

When I was halfway through, I heard something behind me.
I turned around.
There was no one there.

But every time I took another step forward, the sound followed slow, steady, as if it were copying my footsteps.

My heart started pounding. I began to run.

After a few minutes, I burst out onto a brightly lit main road. Only then did I stop, gasping for breath, trying to convince myself that I had imagined everything.

When I got home, I rushed straight into the bathroom.

I hate the feeling of sweat clinging to my skin.
As I soaked in the hot water, my dog suddenly started barking wildly.

That was strange. He never barked for no reason. He only did that when a stranger came near the house.

Then suddenly… he went silent.
That silence sent a chill down my spine.
I tried to reassure myself.

“He’s probably just hungry. I didn’t feed him this morning.”

Just then, my phone vibrated.

A message from an unknown number.
The attached photo made my heart stop.

It was my dog lying motionless in front of my house.

Before I could process what was happening, I heard a loud crash from outside.

Glass shattering.

I panicked and called the police.
“This is the police. What’s happening?”

“Someone broke into my house! I don’t know who he is!”

“Please stay calm and tell us your address.”

I followed every instruction they gave me. I got dressed, turned off all the lights, and grabbed a mop as a weapon.

I hid behind the bathroom door.

A dark figure slowly stepped into the house.
I gathered all my strength and swung the mop at him.

He staggered, let out a hoarse groan, and collapsed face-first onto the floor.

I ran upstairs to grab a can of pepper spray, planning to lock myself in a room but… a hand blocked the door.

I threw my entire body against it, but my strength was nothing compared to his.

I fell to the floor.

He stepped toward me, holding a stun gun in his hand.

I broke down crying, completely hopeless.
Then, from downstairs, I heard many footsteps.

“Police! Don’t move!”

I screamed, “He has a weapon!”

He turned around, but before he could do anything, the officers subdued him.
The next morning, I moved to a different place.

It’s farther from work, but much safer.
What struck me as strange was that the area also has a lake erfect for morning walks.

Before leaving, I took my dog to the vet.
The doctor said he had only been knocked unconscious from a hard blow to the head.

His life wasn’t in danger.

I let out a breath I didn’t realize I was holding.
That evening, the police told me who the intruder was.

He was a mental patient who had recently escaped from an institution. According to his records, he had previously been convicted of child rape.

The police also told me that when they arrested him, he didn’t have a phone on him.
And the photo of my dog that I received…
…it was taken from inside my house.
And then

Knock. Knock.
