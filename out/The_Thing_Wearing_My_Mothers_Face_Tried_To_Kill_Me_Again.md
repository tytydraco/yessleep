What are you gonna try this time?  
And why the hell do you keep taking the faces of people I know?

The first time my mother tried to kill me in a dream, I was five or six years old. At that age, the fear was… different. Maybe I’ll tell that story some other time. But now? Now, it feels like the older I get… the closer *it* gets to breaking free. **To stepping out of my dreams—And into reality.**

I *really* hope someone else has experienced something similar, or I’m losing my mind. Because this? This was terrifying.

It started as a normal dream—just another wandering, shifting landscape of the subconscious.But at some point, it became *semi-lucid.* This is the moment I remember everything clearly: I was in my apartment. It looked a little *off*, but that’s typical for dreams, right? No big deal.I was getting ready to leave. Shoes on, hand on the door, about to step out—And then my mother appeared in the doorway. She looked at me and said she *really* needed my help. Instantly, a sharp wave of panic hit me. There was no reason for it. It came out of nowhere.But it was there.

She asked me to help her prepare lunch—to peel and cut some potatoes.

Alright. Fine. No problem.

I sat down, knife in hand, peeling. And with every breath I took, the fear grew stronger. *Heavier.* It didn’t make sense. There was no danger. And yet, something inside me **screamed** that I needed to wake up.

Right now.

I squeezed my eyes shut and tried to force myself awake.Nothing. I looked up. My mother was staring at me. Not *at* me, but *through* me. Her expression had changed. Something wasn’t right. I shut my eyes again. Tighter this time. Nothing. When I opened them, she had stopped peeling. She just… sat there. Watching. And then—That *smile.* Slow. Wide. Wrong.

*"I know what you’re trying to do,"* she whispered.*"It won’t work."*

And then she lunged at me.

I **forced** my eyes shut so hard I thought my skull would crack. And I woke up.

Screaming.

You think that was the worst part? Not even close. Because as I sat there, shaking, gasping for breath—I *felt* it. A lingering *phantom* pain on my arm. Right where she had grabbed me. A sensation like a fading imprint—like something had actually *touched* me, and I could still feel the echo of it. No, I wasn’t sleeping on my side. No, my arm wasn’t numb. I was flat on my back. And that *feeling*? It stayed for a good 10, maybe 20 minutes before finally fading. I still don’t know what the heck that was.

But there’s one thing I know for sure—this isn’t just a dream.

Or rather, it’s *not only* a dream.

The thing that moves through them, no matter how old I am or what I see… it’s not from this world. And it’s not alone.

There are *two* of them.

And for over 25 years, they’ve been following me. Drifting between worlds, slipping through dreams.

I don’t know when they’ll finally catch up to me—  
But I just hope I have the courage to face them when they do.
