Ah, my old girlfriend, she was truly a beggar. I couldn’t tell her ulterior motives whenever she had one, the fool I was. Her cries for attention would go on deaf ears but my own, me always believing in her whenever she told me something that allegedly happened to her. Her hate for my family was clear when she met them, and the feelings were returned in keenness. She’d con my sister out of money, caused my brother to get an STD, my father’s truck was broken into, and she only told me she did that on the day she died.

Why didn’t I leave her? For one, I was an impressionable idiot back then. If someone told me to jump off a cliff into deep water, I’d do it in a heartbeat. The other thing was that she was a total riot. She’d get drunk as hell during parties, then say the most random thing, but somehow found all of them funny in some way. Perhaps the way she slurred her speech was to blame. Maybe she just said something I found the pinnacle of comedy back then.

Unfortunately, we broke up. My other friends told me that she seriously hurt another friend of mine, Talya, with a skillet while both of them were drunk. Talya was recovering in her home, but my girlfriend had ran away. Nobody knew where she was. For all I knew, she could be dead in a ditch. Once I got the text from my friends about the situation, I called her almost immediately.

“\*Beeeeeeeeep.\*”

Silence.

“\*Beeeeeeeeep.\*”

“Hello?”

“Eroica, where the hell are you?”

“I shouldn’t need to tell you.”

“But you’re my girlfriend! I should be looking out for you!”

“I’m not your girlfriend anymore.”

“Eroica, please. I don’t-”

“Y’know, since I’m not gonna see you ever again; I’ll just tell you the truth. I hate you.”

My heart sank like a boulder in the blue ocean. She hated me?

“Eroica…”

“I also was the one who broke into your daddy-o’s shitty truck. There was barely anything useful in there! I found an old-ass comcast phone, a shit-ton of keychains of 80s action heroes, and other useless shit. Get better family members, whoever’s gonna rob your family next needs better things. I only found a hunting knife!”

“But the other things were-”

“I burned them, dummy.”

No, this had to be a silly trick.

“Eroica, stop messing with me! Where are you?”

“Are you that dense? I’ll just tell you for your morbid curiosity; I’m in Greece.”

“How? Why? Eroica, please just expla-”

“\*Beep.\*”

She hung up on me.

My girlfriend hung up on me.

Eroica hung up on me.

The remaining hours of the day, I just went into my room. I stayed there, not doing anything but laying on my bed, crying. That was until I received another text message from one of my friends.

Friend: “Eroica died.”

Me: “What how”

Friend: “Her mother told me, my mom & her mom are friends. She was found dead in a ditch. Her body was dumped there.”

Me: “This cant be real”

Me: “No no no no”

Me: “Please tell me she’s alive”

I went to text her phone number, I was surprised she hadn’t blocked me yet.

Me: “Eroica please tell me youre alive please please”

A few minutes pass.

Me: “Eroica”

More minutes.

Me: “You’re alive please respond”

Me: “Please”

To say the most; she never responded to my text. Obviously because she was dead, but I couldn’t think of that. I knew my girlfriend had to be alive. She wouldn’t just go MIA, go to Greece, and then die, right? When the realization finally hit me, I just broke down crying. I locked my door so nobody else could see me vulnerable, not that anybody else was home. Sis was out with her friends, my brother was volunteering  at the homeless shelter, and Dad was out with his hunting buddies shooting at birds and whatnot.

Her death consumed me, but I pushed everyone else away. I left the home I had lived in for 22 years at that time, cut contact with my friends and family, and bought an apartment that I’m still living in now. Not the most graceful way of trying to cope, but an effort was done. I later got back into contact with my folks and some friends, some of my other friends wanted nothing to do with me after I ghosted them.

I went to therapy, went out walking more, I gained some weight, grew a chiseled beard, among other things a 20 to 30 something man would do.

About a day ago, I received something, received something personally to specific. It didn’t have a seller, someone put it in my key locker. It was a white box, but it had a… pungent smell to it. Not like decaying flesh, no. It smelled like cigarettes. Guess who smoked while she was alive? I also noticed I could feel a slight “\*Thump.\*” when I held the box in my hand.

So, to quell the curiosity, I put it on the table, and opened the box up.

What I saw was enough to make me want to throw up.

What did I see? A human heart. A beating human heart. To make sure it wasn’t an animatronic, I touched it, which did indeed get my hand all bloody and slimy. I washed up the blood and got some water just in case I actually did throw up. I closed the box, then turned it over, something I didn’t think of doing at first. I saw a word that I instantly knew the context of.

“Eroica’s”

This was Eroica’s heart. This was Eroica’s still beating heart. It didn’t even have a vein to hook it up to an organ system. It was just a single organ. But who would cut out a woman’s heart and send it to her ex-lover? And why was the heart still beating? Eroica was dead for 6, almost 7 years by now. Why now? My confusion from this whole ordeal was enough to give me a headache, so I went over to my bedroom and laid myself on my bed to quell the pain. I eventually fell asleep.

When I woke up the next day, I had the urge to go back to the key locker to see if anything else was there. Fortunately, there was. Unfortunately, it gave me no direct answer.

“O’ she betrays and then she never rise,

her lover scorned in the public’s eye.”

Was this rhyme talking about me and Eroica? Ignoring the “lover” part, I glanced down at the bottom of the page.

“Signed Talya.”

Was this Talya’s revenge? My questions are still stirring in my head even now. Why would she send my Eroica’s heart? How and why did she get the heart in the first place? And why is the heart still beating? I don’t know what to do. Should I dispose of the heart? Should I confront Talya about this? I’m scared I’m being watched right now. I might update this, but I might not. Personal lives and all that.

Until then, if ever.
