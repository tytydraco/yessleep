It started out on Tinder. Typical, I know, but I was desperate. I had just broken up with my first boyfriend ever, and I was looking for a rebound. That’s when I found Leo. 

He was cute. He had shaggy black hair and brown eyes. His profile said he was 6’2, so I decided to swipe right. To my surprise, we matched. I thought he would be a reach, as I didn’t have a high opinion of myself back then. I was too nervous to send the first message, and he didn’t send one either, so I forgot about it for the rest of the night.

The next night, I went to a bar with some buddies from work. It was a shitty dive bar in the suburbs, but it was a fun way to catch up with friends. While we were there, I looked around the bar and was surprised to see that Leo was there. He was sitting in the corner by himself sipping a beer. I was kind of shocked that he would be there, like fate had meant for us to meet in person and not get to know each other over shitty Tinder conversation. After my friends left, I decided to stick around and try to strike up a conversation. I guess he had the same thought, because as I was ordering another tequila soda he came up to me and sat beside me.

“Anna, right?” He asked.

“Yeah, Leo?”

And that was how it began. Delicate conversations at the bar, sleepovers in his apartment, sweet nicknames we’d text each other, all of the beautiful parts of young love. Over the next few months, we became inseparable. I would sleep over almost every single night. I felt like the protagonist of a romcom, the quirky girl that manages to charm the guy who is way out of her league. I was enchanted with Leo, and he seemed enchanted with me. 

That’s when it started. The sickness.

If I’m being honest, I should have seen it coming. There were red flags disguised as sweet nothings. Leo would always comment on how “pure” I was, so trusting and untouched by fear. I always thought “Pure” was a strange term to use, but I figured it was his way of complimenting me.

After a few months of us dating, I began to feel ill. It started off as a drowsiness. I’ve never been one to sleep in. I can usually function perfectly fine after only six hours of sleep. As time went on, I would sleep 7, 8, 9, 10, even 13 hours some nights. I had never slept that much in my entire life. I could still go to work and run my errands at that time, see my friends and family, etc. I miss that. 

Then the vomiting started. 

I’ve always had a fear of vomiting, ever since I was a kid. I hated it. That feeling of your stomach turning inside out made me so uneasy. It was awful. Leo would comfort me, telling me it would pass. 

The first time I vomited was while we were watching Superbad. It was with his roommates, Alex and James. I felt sick and released the sickness, or so I thought. As a kid, my mom would tell me that vomiting would make me feel better and get rid of the toxins in my body. She told me that to make me less scared, and I believed her for a while. 

This was the first time I didn’t believe her. 

I still felt sick, like my body was rejecting itself. After I was empty, that was all I was. Empty. I couldn’t tell why. 

Slowly, I became weaker. My joints ached, my head hurt, everything was awful. Except for Leo. 

He took care of me and took pity on me. He gave me water, food, shelter. I assumed it was out of love. 

Soon, I couldn’t walk.  

My legs felt so heavy. I could sit up and still eat and drink, but I couldn’t walk without assistance. Leo had to walk me to the bathroom and help me shower. I couldn’t go to work anymore, you can’t really waitress if you can’t walk. I became completely dependent on Leo. I felt pathetic, but grateful that I had someone so kind and caring to take care of me. At the time, I couldn’t imagine what I would do without him.

That’s when I started waking up in the middle of the night. 

The first time it happened, nothing spectacular was going on. Leo was fast asleep next to me, and I discovered that at night, I could regain some strength. I could wiggle my toes, and then I realized that at night, I could walk. At first, I couldn’t go very far, only to the bathroom and back, but it was better than nothing.

I would wake up intentionally around 5:00am each morning. My internal clock has always been strong, so I managed to keep up the consistency for a few nights. I decided to not tell Leo of my discovery, as I wanted to surprise him with the fact that I was getting better from my mystery illness. Sometimes, I would even make it to the kitchen, and one night, the seventh night of my adventures, I went outside and looked at the stars.

It was snowing, and the moonlight bounced off of the snowflakes and shimmered in my eyes. It was beautiful. This glimpse of freedom made me cry. I had no idea why I was sick or how to get better, but I realized that breathing the outside air felt better than the stale air in his apartment. My lungs felt clearer, and I even had the urge to run at one point. At the time, I thought it was silly, the idea of running in the snow with nothing on but pajamas. Thinking back, I should have taken my chance.

That night I went back to bed, and the next morning I felt better. I decided that I would show Leo the progress I had made, and surprise him by walking to the kitchen and making him breakfast the next morning. When he woke up, I stood with glee and waited for his reaction. Instead of being met with happiness or pride, his reaction was one of horror. He quickly shifted his reaction to one of a person scolding a dog for stealing food.

“Anna, you should not be up,” he said, a hint of anger lacing his words. “You are not better yet. Get back in bed.”

I stared at him, confused. Why is he not happy for me? He then wrapped his arms around me and pulled me into a sitting position on his lap.

“It’ll all be over soon,” he said, in a tone that I simply could not read. I had no idea what he meant by that. 

Unfortunately, I now know exactly what he meant.

That day, I laid in bed, watching Tik Toks and the occasional Youtube video. When he was gone, I would get up, pace the room, and stretch. A thought crossed my mind; What would happen if I left? We had been together for about nine months now, and four of those months I had spent cooped up in his room like a princess waiting to be rescued. I had never considered that I could leave. My car had been on the street, I could get up, leave, and go home. He didn’t even know my car was there; I told him I took the train here. Had he figured out that my car was here yet?

At this point, I didn’t even suspect Leo had harmful intentions. I was so naive, I still thought he cared about me. I decided to test this theory.

Slowly, I stood up and made my way to the door. It was around 7:00pm, and Leo wouldn’t be back from work for another hour. I had time. I reached my hand towards the doorknob. I twisted it, and slowly opened the door. I peaked through the crack and saw James staring at me right back through the door. I jumped back as he slammed the door back shut. Is he guarding me here? Why would he be keeping me in the room? He has to be pranking me or something.

“James, let me out,” I said, still not grasping the fact that I was in danger.

“No,” James said. “I can’t do that.”

“I have to pee,” I lied. “Please, I’ll be quick.”

“No,” James replied in a monotone voice. “Leo will be back soon. He can take you to pee.”

“James, let me the fuck out!!” I screamed, banging on the door. “Let me out!” 

He opened the door fully, and then I was hit with a flash. The last thing I remember is hitting the floor.

……

I woke up in bed. My head was throbbing as I tried looking around. The room was dark, and my body felt heavy. I checked my phone, it was around 9:30pm. All of a sudden, my body went into fight or flight. Something was seriously wrong, and I needed to get out. I opened my phone and started texting my mom.

“Help. Something’s wrong. I need you to come get me please. I think he’s trying to kill me.” 

 I tried sending the text but it wouldn’t go through. Why wouldn’t it go through?

Then, Leo walked in.

“Good morning sleepyhead!” Leo said. “Sorry, the wifi is down and the service is gone, so you can’t go on tik tok, but that means we can spend more time together!”

“That doesn’t just happen,” I said. “Can I please go to the bar across the street? I need to check something.”

“Baby, it’s snowing! And you’re already sick as a dog, why don’t you just go to bed? I’m sure that it’ll all be back tomorrow.”

“No, I need to go now, please,” I begged, the fear evident in my voice. “I’ll be quick.”

Leo’s face changed, but only for a second. “Go to bed, Anna.”

A drowsiness I’ve never experienced suddenly came over me. I tried to fight it as Leo climbed into bed with me, turned on his TV, and then suddenly, I was asleep.

……

I woke up at around what I thought was 5:00am, but this time it wasn’t from my internal clock. I could feel something on top of me. I wanted to open my eyes, but my instincts told me not too. I realized that it wasn't something on top of me, but someone. Leo.

I felt something on my face, almost like a wet tube salivating on me. There was a heavy pressure in my pelvic area too. My body felt limp, I couldn’t move my arms or legs. The wet tube on my face started to feel like a hose sucking on my mouth and nose. I couldn’t breathe. He wasn’t kissing me, it felt like he was trying to remove all the air from my body, like deflating a balloon. He was sucking all the breath from my lungs, suffocating me but somehow keeping me conscious and alive. Finally, I opened one of my eyes.

To this day, I’m still not entirely sure what I saw. Leo’s entire jaw had come unlatched like a snake, and it was entirely covering everything on my face except for my eyes. His teeth were gone, instead his gums pressed into my skiing like a baby teething on a toy. His eyes had moved to the sides of his head, right in front of his temples. In his eyes, all I could see was pure hunger. I felt something piercing me between my belly button and my pelvis. It took everything in me not to scream. I couldn’t breath, I couldn’t move, I couldn’t do anything except lie there. Was he eating me? How many times had he done this? 
Get off of me. Get off of me. GetoffofmeGETOFFOFME.

Everything hurt so much and I couldn’t do anything about it. I knew that the only thing I could do was remain still and quiet. If he knew I was awake, there was no telling what he would do to me. As he was finishing up, I felt something snap in my stomach, and my belly let out a groaning sound like my insides were screaming. I imagine this is what it feels like to give birth, it was the most pain I’ve ever been in. The only thing I could do to protect myself was fall back asleep.

……

The next day, I woke up. It was dark outside. I checked my phone and realized that it was 6:00pm the next day. How long had I been asleep? What did he do to me?

I tried sitting up but found that I couldn’t. I moved my arm again and took a look at it. It was so small, the size of a young toddler’s. When did I start to look so malnourished? I couldn’t move my legs or wiggle my toes. I slowly grabbed my phone again and tried to text my mom again. There was service. I texted her the same message I tried sending yesterday. I almost started to cry. For the first time in months, I felt hope. I could get out, go to a hospital. I saw text bubbles appear, and the message I got back actually made me cry.

“Nice try :) - Leo.”

I have to get out of here.
