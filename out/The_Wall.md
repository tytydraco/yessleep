It's the year 1984 . "Tony Stewart!”
She calls out to me. "Here we go again," I think to myself. Another sleepless night befell me as the voice rang like a power drill in my ears. I know mother is mad, but father refuses to take her to a mental asylum. "The wall's speaking to me again."
This insanity has been occurring for an eternity now.
Day and night, mother sits by that cursed wall mumbling God knows what. Father has become a part of the couch, and I'm just trying to graduate school so that I can finally move out of this damned house. Every time I try to make things better, father just gives me 'the look'. There's something strange about father. He seems to be in a constant state of reminiscence, his eyes filled with guilt and fear. It's been like this ever since I could remember.

I emerge from my bed in a corpse-like manner, the lack of sleep is catching up to me. Mother rambles on, as always, about me not cleaning up after myself in the kitchen, even though I was never even there and father had left for work. I take it like a grain of salt, assuming she's responsible as father left for work hours ago. “How many times is this going to happen mum, you need help, it’s clearly you.” “You didn’t even put the toilet seat down Tony, have some decency for your poor old mother.” Mother continued spurting words of nonsense as if I wasn’t even there. “You were extra loud tonight Tony, you know how much of a light sleeper I am.” “You were so loud that even dad was struggling to sleep tonight and he couldn’t sleep again for the rest of the night.” I always ask myself  how my mother comes up with these kinds of things and wonder how sick she truly is.

I exit my prison, completely ignoring mother, desperate to enter the school gates.
Normally, students can't wait for the weekend. I’m the complete opposite. School is the one place I feel like myself. "What's up Tony!" I wave back, as I make my way to class. 
My SAT is coming up which requires me to get all the sleep I can get. "Tony!" ...
"Tony!" ... "Tony!" The pillow should block out her echoes. She continued on for two more hours and I couldn’t  take it anymore. I rush downstairs to the place I’m never allowed to enter.

I never understood why I wasn't allowed to enter father's basement, but I knew that it would withhold something heavy. I frantically search everywhere looking for anything to destroy the wall but what I find instead sent shivers down to my very core.
‘The Stewart family portrait, 1967' a man holding a newborn baby and a child with a disfigured face sitting on a woman's lap. I rush upstairs furiously, portrait in hand. "Who's this creepy kid in our portrait!" All of a sudden, the mirror on the wall shattered. Mother was never insane...
