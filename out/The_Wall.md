I’m trapped. I can hear that thing lumbering through the hallway. My God, what the hell is it? I’m trying my best to keep quiet but I can’t help but whimper. The soft scratching of my pencil on this notepad sounds deafening in the quiet of this tiny closet.  I’m almost certainly going to die in this place. I just hope someone can find this, maybe it will do some good. Or maybe it already doesn’t matter. I’m not sure how long I have until that wheezing thing finds me. Oh God, or that grey stuff might ooze under the door and dissolve me. Oh my God! What it did to Benny, Bill, Jonesy and Donald! To all of them! Even if I don’t survive, the world needs to be warned! 

&#x200B;

Long story short, I was a cop but I got shot in the head. The doctors said I was lucky, that it went straight threw without hitting anything vital. However, I still needed three steel plates to hold my fragmented skull together and ended up with permanent tremors in my right hand due to brain damage. Suffice it to say my cop career didn’t thrive. Just a year later I was a “retired” 45-year-old cop, living on scraps. After a few months, I started to get desperate for work. One evening at an Irish pub, my friend, Graham, mentioned an acquaintance who was looking for employees for some private research institute in the Mojave Desert. “What, are they still blowing A-bombs out there?” I scoffed, eyebrows arched with bemused incredulity. Graham stared down at his beer, “Not sure what the hell they do. But I hear they pay super well, so who cares. I think it would be a good fit for you. Apparently, they’re looking for former police for security positions”. 

&#x200B;

Turns out the facility, and it really is known as the “Facility”, was located in the middle of nowhere. When I tried looking it up online I couldn’t find any information. Later that week I called the number that Graham had scrawled down for me on a beer stained napkin. My right hand was useless to me if I wanted it to do anything that required fine motor function, so when I dialed the number on my landline I had to use my left hand. The phone rang twice before a metallic feminine voice answered and said to hold for an operator. After a few seconds of muted elevator music, I spoke to a soft voiced man who told me my skill set was perfect for their current vacancy: a security management position. He said if I filled out some forms they would pay for me to fly on out for an interview in person. 

&#x200B;

One month and several NDAs later, I was employed again! By the time I started my new job I realized I had no idea what research went on down here. During the interviews my duties as a security manager had been discussed but any mention of their actual research interests had been carefully avoided, redacted or omitted. The security staff were also told to avoid fraternizing with anyone not from their own department, including security personnel from other sections of the Facility.

&#x200B;

Of course, whether we wanted to know the nature of the research or not, eventually, after patrolling some of the research labs for weeks, it wasn’t difficult to figure out that most of the scientists were archeologists or paleontologists. The section of the Facility which I managed was section B.15. This area, like most of the core Facility, was located several hundred feet below the sun scorched surface of the Mojave Desert and comprised many green painted corridors peppered with tall, wide doors made from dark, stainless steel. The rooms inside were large and sterile. Artefacts were cleaned and studied in these rooms after they were brought from the excavation sites (sites E.1 through E.27). I would often find objects of different sizes and shapes lying around in various states of cleanliness. Some looked like ancient amphoras, or large stone bird baths. Others were less identifiable: a chipped statue, a melted lump of some unidentifiable metal or large chunks of a glass-like material. I found this all extremely curious because, as far as I knew, the Mojave Desert didn’t have much in the way of ancient architecture. At least of any ancient civilization that I know. 

&#x200B;

As the months went by I started to get friendly with the other guards, most of them ex-cops too, and we started playing cards and drinking Irish coffee in the evenings. My two main colleagues consisted of a jovial, short man with orange hair named Jonesy and a much older much grumpier and much balder man, Donald. They were good men and we had a lot of laughs together. My stomach twists when I think about where they are now.   
Though I grew fonder of my fellow guards, I found myself developing a severe dislike for the white coated researchers. Most of them were pernicious and arrogant. The only scientist my security buddies and me could stand was a scrawny man named Benny. Our favorite thing about Benny was that he never talked about his work.   


&#x200B;

It was earlier today, at around 1400h, when suddenly all the scientists were running from their rooms. They must have received some message a few minutes before and we watched them from the surveillance monitors as they got all excited and leapt up. Their lab coats flapped and flowed around as they jumped to their feet and made for the main exit. Soon after this I called my boss from a large red landline phone near the video surveillance desk. “Hey Bill, what’s all the excitement about?” Bill’s voice was uncharacteristically hesitant “The… the diggers have found a friggin’ huge object out here! The biggest thing they’ve ever dug up, it’s really weird. They want to bring it to B.15 and we need you to organize the logistics and security”. My brow furrowed, “I guess it’s too big for the main entrance? Maybe we could bring it in via the big doors of the auxiliary hangar?” Bill grunted with agreement, “Yea, we’ll have to improvise a bit but should be manageable. I have no idea what it is, it makes me feel… well you’ll see for yourself. I’ll get some of the boys from B.14 to help you out. And just, well…” He paused for a moment, “just be careful.” I grunted, my eyebrow arched from surprise; why was he so afraid? “Thanks, appreciate it, see you guys soon.”

&#x200B;

Donald, Jonesy and I had coffee in the office and called the guards at the hangar doors to arrange clearance. About an hour later we were at the platform near the doors waiting for the cargo to arrive. The massive metal hangar doors had been opened, which was rare. What was more irregular was that nearly every staff member from sections B.11 to B.18 were all gathered together in a silent knot of people. Despite the silence the air sizzled with anticipation, as well as the searing heat. I stood transfixed from curiosity at the massive doorway, waiting in the shade of the hangar as the relentless sun beat down outside. In the distance I saw a black speck grow larger against the bright blue sky. Slowly it took the form of a helicopter which was carrying a large rectangular shaped mass below it. 

&#x200B;

Within less than a minute the helicopter made its cacophonous approach toward the hangar and gently lowered the object onto an enormous wooden scaffold. I barked orders and signed forms as the guards rushed about, making sure the scientists all stayed a safe distance away. The air was blaring with the sound of the helicopter blades and sand rocketed into my face, forcing me to splutter. “Alright, it’s officially in my care now!” I yelled over the sound of the helicopter as its engines powered down, my colleagues and I wiping sand from our faces. “Show’s over. Get the non-security personnel out of here immediately and secure the object. I want to get the scientists up here to analyze it ASAP.” As my colleagues cleared away the scientists and the excitement died down I was finally able to take a moment to inspect the object. It had been lowered onto the wooden scaffold fitted with wheels just outside the hangar and had been pushed slowly into the center. The few aircraft in this hangar were all currently under repairs and were non-operational, therefore there was plenty of space. As soon as I saw the sheer size of the object, I knew it would be difficult to transport, but not impossible.

&#x200B;

The object was a wall.   


  
Or a large fragment of a wall.   


It was about twenty feet long, eight feet thick and ten feet high. At first the wall appeared made from some sort of boring grey stone. However, when I looked closer the wall was… alive. The wall’s surface bubbled slightly. The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end as I stepped closer. When I was only a few inches away from it I suddenly felt cold. A bead of sweat ran down my cheek and I thought I heard something. It sounded like someone far away calling my name.

&#x200B;

I felt a strange pressure around my head. A sudden invasive thought wormed to life: throw yourself into the wall. I shuddered and held myself back despite the sudden strong desire. I heard the faint voice of Benny and crashed back to reality. My eyes snapped open and I found my nose an inch away from the wall. It radiated cold like an open freezer and it smelled like rotting clay. The surface of the wall simmered ever so slightly. It reminded me of the fizz of some grey effervescent medicine. I paled as I took a large step backward, “I.. uh, what is this?” I turned to face Benny who stood with another scientist. He glanced at her briefly before he approached the wall to apply more straps. He was careful to avoid touching the wall with his bare hands. “Honestly, we have no idea”.  

&#x200B;

I got Donald and Jonesy to transport the wall down to B.15 via the service elevator. Donald grumbled about how badly the wall smelled and Jonesy had eyes as large as saucers when he saw it up close, “It looks so unreal!”   


&#x200B;

Once downstairs I secured the entire section and returned to my office to get some coffee. I tried to put the strangeness of the wall out of my mind, but it had truly unnerved me. I suddenly felt so tired, my forehead beaded with cold sweat. I had been working extra shifts lately, but I had never been hit by such exhaustion so rapidly. As I sat at my desk facing the surveillance monitors I was unable to fight the sleep forcing my eyes shut.   


&#x200B;

I’ve had many hangovers in my life, most of them unpleasant, but when I woke up at my desk I’d never felt quite so singularly awful. My clothes were soaked with sweat and my whole body felt exhausted. My arms felt like molasses as I attempted to move. My forehead throbbed and I felt bruised. I also felt a pressure squeezing my head from all sides. It was a peculiar headache, and it reminded me of how I’d felt near the wall, only much stronger. I sat back in my seat and rubbed my eyes.   
Then I froze. 

&#x200B;

A hand was lying motionless on the floor just behind the empty table in the center of the office. I leapt to my feet and rushed forward. I gasped from horror as I saw Donald lying on the floor, his chest and arms scratched and cut to ribbons. Crimson red stained his blue uniform and his eyes stared up empty and terrified. Immediately I went to my office landline to call for backup. As the receiver met my ear my stomach dropped into my feet.   
The line was dead.   


Now, I should mention that the sole means of communication are the landlines set up throughout the Facility. This line of communication is monitored at all times and any interruption results in an immediate response from security. We had protocols and fail safes for this. But the phone was dead and there was no sign of any response. In fact, how long had I been asleep? What was happening? I rushed back to the monitors, I hadn’t noticed it before but I couldn’t see anyone. The cameras were all operating normally but not a single person could be seen. The corridors were just as green and bare as most late evenings. I looked at the clock, it was only 1817h, so I had slept for about two and a half hours. Where were the janitors doing their rounds? My heart was hammering in my chest and I couldn’t quite catch my breath. Meanwhile my head was throbbing and my eyes were burning. Suddenly I heard an indistinct whisper. Gooseflesh bloomed all over my back and arms.   


  
I’d heard this voice before.   


  
I’d heard this voice from the wall.   


  
I turned back to the monitors and searched for the wall. It had been brought back to the surface, to the hangar! It sat upon the bare ground right by the massive doors. However, the doors were all sealed. The wall itself looked different. It was enormous! Almost three times longer and taller and wider. Suddenly I realized that the titanium blast doors had been sealed as well. My heart rate doubled as I noticed large dents, scorch marks and scratches all over the doors. Something had tried to break them down. I spun my head to look at the security control panel on the wall to my left. My heart, already blaring, felt like it leapt out of my mouth when I realized that someone had activated a total lockdown. The specific button that flashed every few seconds: Quarantine. My eyes grew wide as I realized someone, probably Donald, had activated a quarantine procedure which meant that the entire facility would be sealed airtight. The only way to open any doors now was to wait for them to open from the outside. My God! Why had he done this? Where was everyone? Did he try to wake me? Did I really sleep through all this? I looked back at Donald, my heart still hammering from seeing his dead eyes stare into mine. I sighed sadly and glanced at the clock on the wall. It was currently 1831h. Immediately I returned to the monitors and began to rewind the security footage. 

&#x200B;

Surveying the monitors, I watched myself enter the security office at around 1600h. By 1610h I had passed-out on my chair, drool dangling from my mouth. “Ok, so let’s see where the wall was at that time. Should be room 278B.” I thought to myself aloud as I clicked on the button that would display the footage from that room as well as the surrounding corridors. The screen was black as the footage loaded and I was about to hit the play button but hesitated. Did I really want to see this? I closed my eyes and took a few slow breaths. I can’t figure my way out of here if I don’t know what’s going on. I have to know. I hit play. 

&#x200B;

The camera was located opposite the door giving a full view of the room. At first everything seemed normal. Benny and some other scientists had transported the wall into room 278B. It was 16:23 when they were taking the straps off the wall. Suddenly, a loud popping sound was heard and the researchers spun around. The lights in the room dimmed and flickered. After a few seconds something long and slimy and writhing exploded from the wall, curled around Benny and the other researchers and pulled them in. They all screamed in terror as they vanished, their cries immediately silenced. My jaw dropped open and a small whimper escaped me. 

&#x200B;

Without remembering standing up, I was suddenly shaking my head in pure denial. My heart bursting. What the hell was that? What the hell? What the hell? My head felt full of static. I felt tears in my eyes as I watched more researchers enter the room. The wall suddenly shimmered, it’s simmering surface began to boil and bubble and the wall suddenly grew three feet higher. I saw it reshape itself so that intricately carved figures appeared on the wall’s edge. I leant in closer and gasped. One of those figures looked just like Benny, his mouth stretched open wide into a permanent scream. I didn’t want to continue watching, but I had to. The researchers who entered were horrified by what had just happened. Suddenly their body posture relaxed, their eyes grew glassy and their arms slack at their sides. They moved as if sleepwalking. Some stayed still while others left the room. My eyes swiveled as I shifted my focus to the footage that showed the corridor outside room 278B. The guards and researchers entered the corridor and immediately began attacking and grappling those around them. I yelped as a guard shot another man in the leg and then proceeded to drag him into room 278B. During this fight I noticed Donald for the first time, he was hiding behind the corner of the corridor at the far end and was firing his gun at the madmen. He didn’t manage to get anyone though. He then ran over to help a researcher to their feet and then they both ran down the corridor and out of view. 

&#x200B;

After reentering the 278B, the guard who had shot the man simply walked into the wall pulling the struggling man in behind him. I can still hear the cries of pain and pleas for mercy as they were dragged into that horrifying wall. With every person pulled into it, the wall shimmered and wriggled and grew longer and higher and wider. More and more ghastly decorations began to bloom on its surface, all of them made from the bones or likenesses of those who had been absorbed. The bigger it got the stronger its influence became until it seemed to reach nearly everyone in the facility, turning them into thralls. I looked on in horror as I noticed, one by one, as all staff, janitors, researchers, and guards, all suddenly stopped what they were doing, mid conversation, their eyes empty. The janitors dropped their mops, guards sat up from their desks and researchers dropped pipettes and let precious materials in various rooms smash to powder as they all slowly, with glassy vacant eyes, moved toward room 278B. I saw Bill, and Jonesy, and so many other people I knew by face among those affected. Hundreds of people! A guy who’d held the door for me once, a researcher who always slurped her coffee at lunch. What was worse is that I knew what was going to happen even before it did. I tried to shout at the monitors, “Stop! Wait!” I grabbed the monitors and shook them with frustration.   


&#x200B;

A terror began to fill my stomach, deep and cold and aching. Suddenly, from the corner of my eye I saw Donald. He was trying to hold back the researcher he’d helped earlier but he was simply dragged behind. I saw Donald, chest heaving from effort, stare with incredulity as he sat defeated on the ground as everyone stumbled slowly toward their doom. Donald refused to give up. I saw him run from corridor to corridor trying desperately to stop them.  He threw chairs and tables in their way but they simply pushed past them or jumped over them nimbly. I saw him run toward this office. I saw him enter, saw myself slumped on my chair still completely unconscious. I saw Donald try to shake me awake, he slapped me a few times and was yelling in frustration. He gave up with me eventually and ran over to activate the quarantine lockdown. I saw him tear down the hall back toward room 278B. 

&#x200B;

I’m pretty sure I knew his plan, it was desperate but I’m pretty sure he was just going to shoot everyone on sight. My best guess was that he saw what was happening in room 278B and decided he was going to stop it. As soon as he got close to the door I saw a long pale tendril burst through directly into Donald’s chest. The tendril had a hooked end and it slashed at him. I saw blood spurt out of him, saw him stumble and fall from the ground in fright. However, he still managed to get a hold of his gun and fired multiple shots at the tendril. It writhed and flailed. Donald took the opportunity to climb to his feet. He grimaced and clasped his chest as crimson leaked to the floor. He moved back down the corridor, much more slowly than before. Eventually he got back to the office. He locked the door and then collapsed.  I cried out in frustration. That whole time I was completely useless! My mind felt like static again for a few seconds. I couldn’t work out what my next move should be. A thought hit me hard, one I should really have thought of before. Why had Donald and I not been affected by the wall? Everyone had been taken over, everyone had been forced to walk into that wall. Why not Donald? And me? Why had I been so sleepy? Had the wall done that too? My eyes grew wide with sudden realization. “Shit, the steel plates in my head”. Donald had some too because of a rock-climbing accident he had in his 20s. When I got close to the wall, had it sensed my steel plates? My resistance? Possibly. But I really have no way of knowing for certain. 

&#x200B;

At the same time, on a separate monitor, I noticed some thralls re-strap the wall, and transport it to the elevator and back up to the hangar. Once there, the thralls beat heavily on the large metal doors. Some even shot at the doors with their handguns. The ricochets killed a few of them but not one single person seemed to even notice. Some of the soldiers even used a rocket launcher. I yelled with shock as they simply proceeded to blow themselves up, leaving the doors slightly scorched. After this proved futile, the thralls all grew rigid. Then they all formed a line before the wall and one shambling step after another, all the remaining employees were - assimilated.   


  
It was 1705h when the last employee disappeared forever into the grey horror, and the wall expanded to its current size. Suddenly, a large writhing mass of twisted limbs emerged from the wall. I could not tell exactly what it was because the lighting in the hangar wasn’t good enough but whatever it was, it wasn’t human. Not at all. What it was I had no idea. Its silhouette was about seven feet tall and thin and stretched. It had too many legs and it did not seem to have a head. This thing lumbered over to the doors and began to strike them with a strength and ferocity one would only find in a polar bear. I could tell that the doors were taking strain and even began to dent and bend slightly but even then, they would not yield. After about half an hour of slashing at the door the creature stopped and began to slowly shamble toward the service elevator. My heart froze. It was coming down to B.15! It was coming here!  


  
My eyes swiveled back to the main monitor and I was surprised to see Donald still alive. He was scratched and bleeding badly as he looked for ammunitions-cupboard’s key but he couldn’t find them. I saw him curse. All of a sudden, his eyes bulged and he heaved as if vomiting. His body doubled over and long grey tendrils oozed from his mouth and writhed furiously with life. He grabbed his throat and fell forward onto the floor. Frozen in horror I watched as some of those tendrils slipped back inside Donald’s mouth. His body squirmed and he seemed to wriggle as if his intestines were filled with snakes. I continued to watch absolutely transfixed as some of the long grey tendrils emerged again from between Donald’s lips and slowly wriggled free of his mouth. They were about half a foot long, dull grey and thin like spaghettini.   


  
I bit my lip and stood up. Bile rose in my throat.  


  
I yelled at myself to wake up and see the worms as they quickly slithered towards my unconscious form. Just then my stomach dropped and I could feel an itchiness in my belly.   


  
I could feel the wriggling itch of a thousand grey eels in my gut.   


  
Or was I imagining it?   


  
My stomach writhed and I was about to puke when I saw myself begin to awake. It was 18:15! I was all caught up. The worms somehow realized I was awake and they slithered out of view towards the – suddenly, before I could watch the screen any longer, I heard a hiss and something slimy and long wrapped itself around my throat so tight I couldn’t breathe. I gasped with surprise and strained my neck to look at the monitor that showed the room in real time. I saw from the camera behind my head that something thin and grey had wrapped itself around my throat. I saw two more of those things coming at me from behind as well. They were about to come slithering up my chair when I grimaced with anger and grabbed my gun. The thing around my neck was hissing and making awful clicking and guttural noises. Its small worm head had a mouth that bit and tried to latch on and suck my blood. I pulled at the leach and pressed my gun up against it pointing away from myself. I pulled the trigger and with an earsplitting bang and a sound like a water balloon popping the leach worm was no more than a puddle of putrid ooze. I pulled the remaining part of the leach off my neck and spun around just in time to shoot and kill the other worms. I smiled with joy and yelled with relief. Immediately a wave of nausea and exhaustion hit me and I fell back onto my chair. “What the hell was that? What the hell do I do now?” I sat still for a moment and tried not to completely lose my mind. I swear I could hear Woody the woodpecker laughing somewhere in the distance. I needed to keep it together. I took a long deep breath and tried to think of a way out.  


  
 The facility was on quarantine lockdown which meant only someone from outside can open the doors. And they’ll probably want to check with someone on the inside before doing anything. These guys normally did stuff by the book. So I wasn’t too worried they’d come let anything out but my God. If this thing gets out. If it can get into the minds of more people. If it gets larger and larger. Could it swallow the world? The solar system? What other monstrosities would it allow through? I shuddered and turned back to the monitor. It seems I was all caught up with what had happened. I stared blankly into the monitor as I watched myself slowly awake and wince as I groped my wounded head. I switched the monitor off and saw my reflection in the blackness of the screen. I was pale and my eyes were wide and unblinking. “What do I do now?” I turned in my chair to look at Donald’s body. Were all those worms gone? Could some still be hiding? And what should be done with his body? Probably would be best to have it burned. “Poor Donald, he didn’t deserve this”, I muttered softly as I examined his corpse, making sure there were no unexplained twitches beneath his skin. My eyes moved from his body up to the ammunition’s cupboard just above. “Wait, he was trying to get into the cupboard earlier. Probably to get the TNT we had stored there for ages.” I remembered that me and Donald were gonna use the left-over TNT from the excavation site to blow some random shit up.   


  
We never got around to it. I guess we never will now.   


  
I stood up quickly and moved toward the cupboard. I pulled out my keys and quickly found the key I’d need. I opened the cupboard with little effort and found the ten kilos of plastic explosive inside. I took it all out along with the electronic timer, fuses and a remote detonator. I set the timer for one minute and set the bomb up so that I could also detonate it with the separate remote control. My plan was to somehow get this thing to swallow this bomb and then I’d detonate it. If that doesn’t work I’d use the remote detonator to blow it up. After about a half an hour of fiddling with screwdrivers and setting fuses I had set the explosive up the way I desired.   


  
Suddenly the lights flickered, and the entire facility was plunged into darkness. My nerves were burning with fear. What had happened? Had that thing knocked the power out somehow? The next few seconds that past were some of the longest I’d ever experienced. However, dim green light bloomed to life and the reserve power kicked in. After a few minutes the lights were much brighter. Then I heard slow, shuffling footsteps in the corridor just outside my office. I froze once again, my insides turning to mush. My mind raced. Had I remembered to lock the door? My stomach leapt into my feet as I heard the shuffling get louder and louder. I heard hoarse, wheezing breaths, as if the thing struggled to breathe. I jumped from fright but remained absolutely silent as whatever the thing was banged on the door with a deafening blow.   


  
BANG!  


  
The door shook.  


  
BANG!  


  
Silence for a moment.  


  
BANG! BANG!  


  
Again silence. My heart was hammering in my ears and I sat deathly still. I could hear that thing breathing louder. After a few moments I heard it begin to shuffle away. My entire body was shaking as relief washed over me. Whatever the thing was it had walked away and I could no longer hear it. I turned to look at the monitors. Dare I turn them on and check what it was? After a few seconds of consideration, holding my breath, I turned to the monitors and switched them on. I waited in nervous anticipation as the screens flickered to life showing me that all the corridors I’d need to walk through were currently empty. I didn’t bother checking the corridor I suspected the shambling thing was in. I didn’t want to see it unless I needed to. I’d had just about all the stress and terror I could take and by this stage I felt weirdly calm. It must be shock.  


  
I opened the door slowly, my fully loaded gun in my good hand. Spare ammo along with the explosive was stashed in my backpack and the remote detonator was tied to my belt. I held a heavy-duty flashlight in my shaky right hand. I moved cautiously through the dark green corridors. I’d never thought of how creepy this place could be until this moment. Gooseflesh crept up my arms and neck as I continued. I knew exactly where to go and I made sure to have my back to the wall as much as possible. I cleared the corridors one by one until I made it to the upper floor where the thing that looks like a wall sat near the hangar doors. I walked up the stairs slowly, my ears honing in on any sound. That’s when I heard something. I heard the soft sound of crying.   


  
Someone was crying.   


  
I stopped dead in my tracks. My entire body shook from the adrenaline surging through me. I took one step. Then another. Slowly, I climbed. Once my head could peek over the top and see the wall, I froze. Jonesy was sitting on his knees on the floor, naked, his back toward me. He was facing the wall. It loomed enormous before us. It was now framed intricately with the skeletons of hundreds of people, all twisted and screaming in agony. Writhing, tortured souls fused together. The crying and moaning from the wall grew louder. It was no longer just Jonesy I heard. I could hear them all. They were all screaming. Screaming for me to help them. To join them. I felt that pressure squeeze against my skull tighter and tighter. I shook my head in defiance. “No! You bastard! NO! I will not join you! You’re not Jonesy!” All at once the moans and wails stopped. Jonesy sat before me and I suddenly found myself at the top of the stairs without knowing when I’d finished climbing them. “But we are Benny” came a voice that was not human at all. It was a voice made from all the voices of all those it had swallowed up. It was as if something had made a bad copy of the voices of all those people and then just used them all at once to speak because it didn’t understand the concept of individuality. Suddenly the wall rippled and slowly grey tendrils that squirmed from the flesh of the wall, curled around Jonesy, teasing his face, slowly pulling him in. As he disappeared there was a horrendous sucking, squelching noise. “We are Benny. We are all. We can be all. We will be all. All and all and more than all.”   


  
The voice was chanting this over and over. Louder and louder. A deafening blast came from the wall and a slithering writhing mass of tangled human limbs emerged. It had four legs and several arms. It looked like the bodies of eight or more people shuffled and glued into an otherworldly horror. Its multiple mouths screamed a high pitch squeal that could not be human and its sharp pointed teeth gnashed and chomped. I only had a second to dodge this monster. I leapt to the side and fired multiple shots at the thing’s center of mass. Its horrifying body of fused torsos wriggled and bled black ichor. It screamed with pain and jumped at me grabbing my leg. It tossed me into the air and I almost lost my gun as I slammed into the floor a few feet away. Before I could catch my breath, it was upon me again. From the ground I fired several shots at it. This made it jump away and scuttle down the stairs. With it momentarily out of sight, I quickly got to my feet and kept my eyes on the stairs.   


  
After a second, I decided to kneel and take off my backpack as fast as I could. I pulled out the bomb and started the timer. I also decided to get the shotgun out and get it loaded. I needed to do this now or never. I really hope this thing doesn’t know what a bomb looks like. As the final shell clicked into place I heard a roar coming from the stairs. The thing was back. Before I could react, it leapt at me and knocked me to the ground. It bared down on me, grabbing at my throat ready to tear me apart. My reflexes saved me though and I managed to use my shotgun to hold the thing away but it was too strong. Desperate, I kicked it hard in the chest and it let go. I used this moment to grab the bomb that lay behind me, only 40 seconds to go. Terrified and crazed, sweat pouring down my face, my mind in pieces, I rammed the bomb into the creature’s mouth and kicked it back again as hard as I could. I heard it yelp like a wounded dog and it lost its footing. It fell sideways and in that second, I took my shotgun and fired at it in the chest. The force of the close-range blast sent me flying backwards. At the same time the creature was hurled back into the wall where it was quickly enveloped.   


  
My head was fuzzy. I was dizzy and the wind had been knocked out of me but had I been out for long? Was the bomb going to explode on its own? I felt something warm and wet drip into my ear and touched the side of my head. My fingertips came away soaked in blood. My head spinning, I managed to sit up just in time to hear a low rumbling sound. The ground beneath my feet shook and for a moment I was confused. Then I looked up at the wall. Its surface was roiling and boiling like I’d never seen before. It was shaking and growing larger. Suddenly there was a massive blast from within it and the entire wall splintered into hundreds of small grey chunks. These chunks rained down all around the cargo hold. The blast knocked me off my feet and this time I definitely passed out because when I awoke I could see daylight through the tiny cracks in the blast door. Where the wall had been there was now a small crater. So the wall was gone? I didn’t really believe it. I turned back to inspect the wall pieces and found that they – my eyes grew wide and my mouth opened wide.  


  
They were melting.   


  
As I approached one a horrible twisted hand shot out at me trying to grab me. I yelled and jumped backwards. It was still alive! I watched in horror as the pieces continued to melt and began to merge, just like that scene from Terminator 2. It was rebuilding itself. Then I heard a groan behind me. I turned slowly in terror to find the shambling, wheezing monstrosity behind me. Like the creature I’d shot this one seemed made from bits and pieces of human limbs knitted together randomly. This one had legs which came out of its mouth, its head positioned within its torso where the bellybutton should be and it wheezed and groaned in pain. I almost puked from fright but my body already had me running away. I sprinted down the corridors ignoring all the pain and fear and exhaustion and anger and frustration I had inside me. I leapt into the first janitor’s closet I could find and now I lie in wait for that thing. I lie in wait for that grey ooze. What is that wall? Was it even a wall? I’m beginning to think of it as more of a membrane. An interface. Somewhere else is pressing up against our universe, it has somehow torn a small hole, and was now prying it open further. I should blow up the whole facility. But would it stop that thing?  That membrane? Or would it just bury it; to be rediscovered? I think even if I survive this, nothing can help us.   


  
So here I wait, hoping to be saved, but even as I write this I can hear that thing coming towards the door. I can hear the snuffling, it’s right outside! I can smell its ugly breath.  


  
Oh God! The doorknob is turning...
