Part 1: [My Appalachian Inspo-Trip Has Gone Horribly Wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qo0ilo/my_appalachian_inspotrip_has_gone_horribly_wrong/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I stirred, my limbs leadened and weak. I lifted an arm to my face and was met by the leathery feel of stitches, jagged and novice. I tried to remember where I was or why I was in the back seat of a kidnapper’s van. After sitting up slowly and sifting through my memories thoroughly, my heart sank.

Last night. 

“Fuck.” I tried to get up but I collapsed back in on myself feebly. My muscles felt like they’d been shredded and my palms were cut up. I dragged myself to the door of the van, assuming it’d be locked to keep me contained like canned tuna.

What I wasn’t expecting was the easy ‘click’ and nearly tumbling onto the gravelly pavement outside. And I certainly didn’t anticipate seeing Beau sitting, facing a small campfire and scribbling into her journal. I’d thought she’d kicked that nervous habit ages ago.

At the metallic squeak of the door, she turned sharply towards me. The expression that flashed across her illuminated face was panicked, but she quickly course-corrected and gave me a sheepish smile.

“Good morning,” she offered lightly, but I sensed a ribbon of tension poised to snap at the wrong step. I reoriented myself, moving to take a seat at the fire next to her as she eyed my bandaged arms warily.

My words caught in my throat and I choked up. I couldn’t imagine any combination of words could fix what has been broken between us. I chose to instead stare at the fire as she slid a slightly soggy Uncrustable towards me. I cracked a smile as I picked up the package and unwrapped it.

I looked towards her and she stared at me hesitantly. She looked to the sky and then back towards me and I understood.

“Not tonight.” I put my hand out in front of me. “S’not raining.” I watched as understanding dawned on her face. Beau was always the type to try and crack a puzzle. I couldn’t really think of much to say to her. It was a weird experience, seeing fear carve the lines on my best friend’s face. It sickened me, that I was some thing to fear. But as I tried to break down the emotions in her eyes, I realized she wasn’t staring at me, she was staring at a spot on my face.

I raised a hand to my cheek and found it sunken in, rough with sewing thread and dried blood. My stomach lurched as images flashed across my vision. Of the back of her head, of tall, thick grass, and of her face as she jammed a shiv into the side of my face. She wasn’t looking towards me with fear.

It was guilt. 

I heaved in a breath. I had been so selfish. I had let her bring me out in the woods alone with her knowing how badly she could have been hurt. Knowing how badly she was hurt right now. I watched as she stood to her feet and shifted towards me.

“Can I see your arms?” she asked. I held them out to her and she unwrapped thick linen bandages and redressed them gingerly. I stared at her, baffled. I chewed my bottom lip before saying anything.

“You can drop me off at the nearest motel,” I stated. “I’ll make my way home. I’m sorry I ever came here.” I dragged my knees closer to my chest and made an attempt to warm the Uncrustable over the dim flames. 

“What?” She was dumbfounded. “What are you on about?”

“Continue on your trip, and I’ll do what I should have always done.” All I got in response was a shake of the head. I tossed the wrapper into the flames and stood up to sort out my mess of strewn clothes in the van’s boot.

I was startled as arms were suddenly wrapped around my torso. Beau.

“Don’t do that ever again.” And I felt a quake in her body that wounded me worse than any knife fight or shattered glass. And all I did in return was nod; we stood there for a long time after that.

We woke up the next morning side by side, groggy with summer humidity and a heaviness that I think we both felt. I’ll never tell her, but I heard as she stirred in the night, frightened and oblivious. Beau never had nightmares before.

She got up silently and tossed me a granola park that fell limply in my lap. She told me that she was going to drive us into the nearest town and we’d get a hotel for a few nights while we figured out our plan for the coming days. She climbed into the front seat and I took my usual post as passenger princess. I pulled up directions for our destination and guided her out of the narrow, jagged roads towards a small town that rivaled the size of an ant’s nest.

When we pulled into the cracked parking lot and checked-in to the ‘Mole Hill Inn’ we were eyed skeptically by an outwardly sweet old woman behind the counter. We returned awkward smiles and headed to the small elevator. We let out stifled laughter once the doors closed, realizing what two young kids must look like checking into a cheap motel off the road.

After we threw our stuff onto the floor, we slumped onto the overly-cushiony bed and groaned. Beau excused herself to take advantage of the newly available shower and locked the door behind her, basking in the steam. I leaned back on the mattress and closed my eyes, trying to regain some sort of foothold in my own life.

I will admit, it’s honorable how well Beau had coped with the events of the last few days, but I doubt that anyone wouldn’t be more than scarred by the entire experience. As I laid, staring at a dinky ceiling fan above me, I thought about the morning Beau had picked me up days ago.

\--

I’d woken up groggily, slapping my tittering alarm asleep as I sat up in bed, wiping my eyes.  I glanced at the time.

“5:47. Fuck,” I  groaned as I pulled myself from the bed and onto two left feet. Sauntering toward the closet, I threw it open, finding some tattered flannel shirt to pull over my head and stumbling towards the bathroom.

I flicked on the light and blinked a few times to reorient myself. Late nights aren’t treating me well these days, I thought. I kicked a few creaks from my back before combing my hair and brushing my teeth.

I threw my toiletries loosely into a pack before being jolted by a dodgy car horn blaring from the street. As I ran to grab my shoes beneath the window I sent a middle finger sailing to the silhouette in the driver’s seat. The horn relented but I didn’t slow my pace. Say what you want about Beau, but she was punctual. 

I ran out the front door, heaving my bag onto my back and grabbing my spare. I thumbed toward the trunk before dropping them on top of a lazily constructed pile. Hopping up into the passenger's seat I was greeted with a:

“Morning, sunshine.”

I returned her hello with a deadpan stare and cranked the seat back a few notches. 

What I wouldn’t give now to go back to that morning. To the simplicity of our friendship and the mutterings of early mornings. 

In the car, I closed my eyes and feigned sleep while I took some time to confer with my thoughts. I could practically hear her roll her eyes at me from the other side of the car. I felt the smile tugging my lips at her annoyance but I quickly returned to neutral. I drifted to thoughts of telling her everything, but dismissed it “for later,” assuming that my weather app and woodcover would be all I needed to conceal it for at least a little while. Selfish.

I still hadn’t understood the purpose of our adventure either. Don’t get me wrong, I was on board the moment camping and a gap year was involved, but I’m not the artsy type. I didn’t see her need for grandiose adventure to write her newly inspired novellas. That never should have been an excuse to use her dream as a getaway. Eighteen years should have been enough time to know my own limits.

I picked up my phone and opened my weather app. I had four days before the next rain. Four days to figure out what I had to do.

Beau came out of the bathroom, heat trailing after her into the room. She beckoned me into the small room.

“Come here, let me wash and dress your stitches.” Her tone was gentle, but I recognized it. Back in school she always had way too much patience for our friends’ bullshit. This was the same way she treated any of us when we’d gotten too unruly on a Friday night and she had to nurse our hangovers the next morning. 

I shook my head and stood up, moving for the bathroom. 

“I’ve got it. I’ve had enough practice licking my own wounds.” That must have been the wrong thing to say because she seemed injured as she stepped aside to let me through. I stood facing the large mirror over the counter and winced. I looked like I’d been mauled by a bear, covered in bruises and small scabs. It’d never gotten me this battered before.

After scrubbing myself nearly raw, I stepped back out into the hotel room. Beau wasn’t there, so I sat on the bed and flicked on the TV to some nature documentary and listened to the soothing voice of the narrator. I heard the door open shortly after and she returned with some food from the buffet downstairs. She set it carefully on the night stand beside me, but instead of digging into her own plate, she spread out beside me and tuned in to the video of a fox chasing a desperate goose through a snowy forest.

She laid against me, and I suppose the stress of the last few days had caught up to her. I realized that she must have had to carry me back to the van the other night. She fell asleep; she looked aged beyond her years. Beau always had a glint of exhaustion behind her eyes, but this was something else. 

I closed my eyes and absorbed the moment, knowing that I wouldn’t want to forget it. At 10:02 p.m., I gently lifted myself up from the bed and knelt by my pack. I inventoried it and borrowed a few essentials from Beau’s supplementary stash, heading towards the door. I stood there for a few minutes, staring at her, before I opened it and let it fall closed gently behind me.

As I left the sliding doors of the hotel, wincing at the assumptions laid upon me by the check-in lady. She wasn’t so far off.  I had intended to hitch a ride far enough away that I wouldn’t be followed.

What I hadn’t anticipated as the wind brushed past me hurriedly, were the Virginian flash floods.
