Hello everyone. I am a forensic scientist working in Miami. I stare at dead bodies the majority of the week. I've seen some disturbing things but one of my most frustrating cases has to be this one.

Strange disappearances began happening around my area. Multiple women, prostitutes, had gone missing without a trace. Then the bodies started showing up. Bloodless, dismembered bodies had begun appearing around Miami. They had been drained and the limbs cleanly cut off. They had obviously been chilled to preserve them, so they had been somewhere cold before they were found. Anyone would know that Miami is not cold. The bodies had been in some sort of freezer. One of the bodies, though, had a prosthetic arm with painted fingernails in a distinct pattern.

My life at home was normal. My girlfriend, Rita, had previously been in an abusive relationship with a guy called Paul who had been sent to prison for domestic abuse. My stepchildren were Astor and Cody. My sister, Debra, worked in the homicide department and we were both on the same case for these killings. My biological mother and father were dead as well as my adoptive father. When I was a young child, criminals locked me and my mother in a shipping container, then killed my mother, Laura Moser, and dismembered her with a chainsaw. I was left to sit in pools of my own mother's blood for two days until the Miami metro police department found me and an officer called Harry Morgan took me in. He became my adoptive father.

We eventually got a lead on the killer and so that led to me going to a party somehow. At one point of the night, I was fighting my way through the crowd when suddenly a hand waves infant of my face. The girl was obviously drunk and had no awareness of the people around her. I looked at the hand when I realised it was a prosthetic and the colours painted on her fingernails matched the colours on a dead victim's hand. At that point I knew that the killer was a prosthetist. I immediately reported back to the police department with my new evidence.My coworker, however, had always been suspicious of me knowing more than I told. He was James Doakes.

Debra had recently gotten into a relationship with someone called Rudy Cooper. He was always strange with me, almost as if he could seen straight into my mind. I didn't mind him though.

I was driving home one evening when I saw it. An ice cream truck. Its not very normal for an ice cream truck to be around late at night. My adoptive father appeared beside me and told me to follow it and so I did. The truck later pulled up outside of a hospital whilst I was following at a safe distance behind. The back of the truck slowly opened to reveal something. A hand, frozen in a block of clear ice. We had caught him. I raced home thinking about how I was gonna explain me following a random ice cream truck, without also bringing up my hallucinations.

The next morning, I did a quick pit stop to the hospital. It was abandoned, but I saw a single square of white light illuminating from one of the upper floors. I pushed through the front entrance and made my way up via the elevator. Outside, I had counted how many floors the light was up, so I knew where to go. The elevator dinged as the doors opened. I stepped out and made my way down the hall to the room with a light streaming across the floor opposite it. I poked my head around the door, not even thinking about traps. I saw a well organised lab, that was obviously still in use. There were model hands on tabletops and lab coats hung up on the wall. Someone had been here, and recently. I suddenly heard footsteps down the hall and slid into a cooler room, crouching down behind the door. I stood up a bit to look out of the glass window on the door. I saw a guy with black hair that I thought i recognised. He turned around for a split second and I saw his face. Rudy Cooper.

He then left the room again. I waited for a couple of seconds before sprinting out of the room and into the elevator. I smashed the "Ground Floor" button and began my descent.

There hadn't been anymore killings recently, so I took this as a chance to deliver justice. I gathered all of my tools then set off to the hospital. The truck was parked outside and the light coming from the same window. I went to the same floor and stepped out. He wasn't in the room at that moment, but I knew he would come back. I hid behind a table and waited.

He eventually strolled into the room humming a tune. I made my move and  injected him with a light dose of M99 right on his neck. He fell back into my arms as he lost consciousness. I laid the body down as I got everything set up.

I stood back to look at my masterpiece. He was tied tightly down to a table, wrapped in cling film. I carefully opened my knife kit, selecting my favourite one. I then reached for my smelling salts and held them under his nose. He jolted awake and looked around. He recognised where he was and who was standing over him, holding a knife. He didn't say anything. I told him that he deserved to pay for his crimes and that I was only following Harry's code. He smiled at me as I held the knife to his chest, pressing down but not with enough force to penetrate the skin. Suddenly, I remembered his wallet. There could be valuable evidence on there, right? I set the knife down and grabbed the wallet from the floor. I opened it and filtered through it when I saw his ID. His picture was on there, but the name on the card said Brian Moser. Had "Rudy" been living under a fake name? I wasn't sure. Not like it mattered anyway, he'd be dead soon. I walked back to the table and picked up the knife. I counted down in my head before plunging my knife into his chest. His throat gurgled and his body convulsed before he whispered the words "Brother, no" over and over again. I listened in confusion as to what he could mean by that. Everything slowly clicked into place. I had just killed my brother.
