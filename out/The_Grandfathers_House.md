Our community referred to it as "The Grandfather House." Not for some benevolent old man who lived there, but because it had been there so long, untroubled, since our neighborhood street was constructed. It was a Victorian monstrosity, all peeling paint and gables, with a garden that sucked up the sunshine. We kids dared one another to touch its rusty gate, our bravado disappearing the instant our fingers touched cold metal.

My younger brother, Leo, was a different case. He was eight, with a rumpled brown mop of hair and an imagination that was a low-grade nightmare for my parents. Where we saw a haunted house, Leo saw a castle. Where we heard the groan of rotting wood in the wind, he heard the breath of a sleeping giant.

And he saw the figure in the window.

His name, he explained to us, was Mr. Alistair. He himself had explained this to Leo. Mr. Alistair was immensely old, and immensely lonely, and he possessed the loveliest toys from everywhere around the world in his huge mansion. He'd shown Leo a music box that sang a tune older than nations, and a doll with china cheeks that felt nearly real.

My parents, at first, were in hysterics. Stranger danger was pounded into us, and a gaunt white man shouting their son's name from a second-floor window was the stuff of legend that brought them to the police. But the police found nothing. No Alistair in any files, no indication of entry or exit, only dust and the slow decay of a century. They wrote it off as a child's overactive imagination. Leo, naturally, was the sole individual to ever set eyes on him.

I was twelve years old. Old enough to know monsters don't exist, yet still young enough to be frightened of the dark. I started staking out the house. And I started observing a routine.

Mr. Alistair appeared late in the evening, that dirty, shapeless period between light and dark. He never waved, but simply remained there, a white blur against the black glass, waiting. And Leo would stop whatever he was doing, his eyes automatically fixed on that window as if with a string.

It was that evening when the sky dimmed to purple, and Leo was not in his bed. The cold dread, sharper than any I had known, cut through my stomach. I did not tell Mom and Dad. I just ran.

The gate of the Grandfather House was open. It never was open before.

The front door was also open, a chasm of profound darkness waiting. The air that leaked out was chill and had the smell of dried roses and old earth. I called Leo's name, and my voice was swallowed by the profound silence within.

I found them in a great ballroom, but there wasn't a bit of furniture, no furnishings at all, just huge, empty space and a dusty floor. Leo leaned in a shaft of dwindling light from an upper window, holding Mr. Alistair's hand.

He was worse than Leo's words. He wasn't just pale; he was colorless, his face like a photograph left on the sidewalk in the sun. His body was slat-thin to emaciation, shrinking his black suit into an empty pretense of man. But his eyes… they were young. Bright, starving blue that watched my brother with a raw tenderness that made my skin twist in distaste.

"Leo," I breathed softly, my voice trembling. "Away from there."

Mr. Alistair's gaze shifted toward me. There was no glimmer of malice in his eyes, nor of anger. Only a tremendous, old-fashioned patience far, far more frightening.

"He is not for you," the man said to her. His tone was as dry as leaves turning in a book of ancient books. "He is a clever little thing. They all are, for a little while. But they fade so quickly. Their light extinguishes."

He knelt before Leo, gliding smoothly and very much the wrong way. He did not bend his knees so much as his body rearranged itself. He stroked Leo's cheek with a finger as white and long as a bone.

"They are like fireflies," Mr. Alistair panted, and yet I might have heard him perfectly. "You scoop them up in your hands, you adore their precious, tiny light. You try to capture them in a jar. But they always, always die. The light is the best, and it's so fleeting."

He looked at me, and his calm face finally shattered, revealing an ocean of blankness and a hunger so ravenous that it seemed the room had shifted.

The jar is just the body," he said. "It breaks. It rots. But the light… the purity, the innocence, the unsoiled delight… that is the content. I don't take their bodies. I would never… destroy the jar. Not until the light within has been fully… savored."

He took a step closer to Leo, who was standing there frozen, a tiny, beatific smile playing on his lips.

"I like it," Mr. Alistair huffed, his lips millimeters from the temple of my brother. "I drink it in. Slowly. If I'm careful, it can take years. I keep them happy. I bring them toys and fairy stories and all the love a child ever needs. They never have a moment of pain or fear. They live in a perfect golden childhood until the final spark of their light is mine."

His lips parted. Not wide, as on television. A fleeting, involuntary separation of the lips, but from it I felt a tug. Not a physical blast, but a tug of something else. The warmth began to drain from the room. The already fading twilight outside appeared to darken further. Leo's buzzing energy, his ridiculous laugh, his irrepressible curiosity—I felt being tugged towards that terrible, gnawing void.

And when the light is gone," he breathed, his voice buzzing against Leo's skin, "and there is only the hollow jar left. I put it away. I store them all. In the dark below. So that I may always remember the light they held.".

And then I saw them. Against the ballroom walls, in dark corners, stood other shapes. Small, still, and quiet. Dozens of them. Children. Sitting stiffly upright, their eyes open and blank, their skin pale and sallow. A series of empty jars.

I didn't think. I screamed and flailed at him. It was like hitting a marble statue. He didn't move, but his head whirled around those awful young eyes toward me. He looked pleased.

"The love of a sibling," he mused. "A different vintage. Brash and hot. But it turns bitter so fast with age."

He raised his other hand to me, and a more total exhaustion than sleep washed over me. My knees buckled. I thought of syrup. I only wanted to fall in the dust and forget.

I was seeing Leo. My little brother. His smile growing distant, dreamy, far away.

I fought back against the sloth, struggling back to standing. I didn't attack him again. I gazed at the window, at the fading light of the sun. And I remembered. He only ever came out at twilight.

"You can't have him!" I shouted, my throat sore. I stumbled over to the massive window and began to rip at the heavy, mold-covered drapes.

Mr. Alistair's patience ran out. A hiss, the hissing sound of steam from a burial mound, escaped his lips. I saw fear for the first time in those blue eyes, those ancient blue eyes. Not fear of me, but terror of the dying sun.

With one final sob, the curtain dropped. The final shred of sunset, a bloody, brilliant orange, sliced across the room.

It didn't hurt him. It didn't turn him to ash. But it *unmade* him. His form seemed to lose definition at the boundaries, to melt away. He flailed backward, releasing Leo, who blinked and fell to the floor like a puppet whose strings are cut.

Mr. Alistair's body dissolved into the blackness embracing the other side of the room, his ravenous, young eyes the last to disappear, fixed on my brother with a gaze of unending, longing sorrow.

I grabbed Leo and ran. We never looked back.

The police found nothing in the Grandfather House, of course. Just dust. They told him that Leo must have fallen asleep in there after a game of hide-and-seek, that his fevered story was just a dream.

Leo is fourteen years old now. He doesn't remember Mr. Alistair, or the music box, or the ballroom. He's moody, and spends too much time staring at his phone, and brawls with my parents over homework. He's normal.

But sometimes, when the light is exactly at twilight, I find him standing stock-still. He'll look out the window at that old house, and a gentle, wistful smile will cross his lips as if remembering a lovely, evanescent dream. And in that moment, I see a small, lovely ember that's been. diminished.

I watch the house too. The new owners who purchased it, the ones who paid a song for it and renovated it, they tell me it's wonderful. So much space for the kids.

They have a little boy. He is eight. He has wild brown hair.

And sometimes, at twilight, I catch a glimpse of a faint smudge in the second-story window. Waiting. No longer for my brother.

He's got a new jar for his collection.
