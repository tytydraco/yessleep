I lived on a farm in South America with my wife and 2 kids. The community we lived in has many farms and we were self-sustaining. We often supplied city markets our products but we also would trade within the community.

Our farm owned a few animals to keep us safe and for the kids to play. We have cats that both look like small tigers and one Labrador who is friendly with the cats.

The only problem with having a farm there were the native cannibals. I wished I could have had a farm in Colorado but it's too expensive. The native cannibals are a problem that the goverment isn't paying funds for to preserve history.

Every night I heard weird sounds coming from the forest near us. Animal noises that scared my children. That is why I strictly told my daughter and son to go to bed at 9 pm.

"That is the safest way" I always told my wife. To deal with the cannibals I made the house seem to be abandoned. Yes, it may have not be very convincing because of our harvests but we hoped they would think we were just checking up during the day. They are afraid of hunting in the sun.

Child obedience doesn't defeat curiosity... The last nights my kids are too scared to sleep after they heard them. My daughter came to me and my wife and asked 

"Dad? Why are the cats laughing? Why are the falcons signing?" My daughter asked me

"What are you doing up so late? They are uh.." 

"Rabid animals" my wife completed the sentence

"Why do we have rabid animals near us?" My daughter  asked

"Where is your brother sweetie?" I asked

"He took grandpa's sword and went to investigate" 

"He did WHAT??" I was suprised 

While my wife was talking to our daughter I grabbed the shotgun I always kept under the bed. I also armed my kids room with the sword for emergencies. 

I woke my Labrador up and went searching for him. Wolves sounded like hyenas and the cat's laugh became a lion's roar.

I saw my sons face bloody  with a look of horror and the body of a native nearby. But his arm was pierced by an arrow and he was near to passing out. He bandaged the wound with his own shirt. 

More cannibals saw us and tried to shoot us with arrows but I had my trusty shotgun. I fired two shots that hit a native. His guts spraying out still haunts me. The other shot painted the fence with blood.

My shots simbolized danger and my neighbours came to help me. I saw horrific things in that fight. The police was called by some guy and they shot my other neighbour in the abdomen

My garden was covered in the brains and guts of those natives and my neighbour. Their prideful falcon signing turned to a snake hissing and the cat laugh turned into a wolf barking. And the police sirens covered their animal sounds. Police covered my farm

After that day, my son was in the hospital, paranoid to sleep while the rest of my family slept at a hotel in the city. After our son healed up I sold the farm and sadly I gave away my cats to my neighbours and I moved to the USA. My kids and I had to get therapy.


Even to this day my son can't sleep and I still have PTSD. We moved on from the farm and now own a house in the suburbs. But even to this day I can hear guts spraying out.
