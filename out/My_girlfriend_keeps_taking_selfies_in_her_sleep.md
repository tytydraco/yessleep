Angela has been my girlfriend for going-on three years now, and I’ve loved every second of it.

I never thought I’d meet someone like her: sweet in a way that isn’t performative, outgoing without being loud, kind without keeping score. I know it’s cliché to call a relationship “perfect,” and I’m not trying to sell you anything. I just mean… it just fit. 

My parents adored her, maybe even as much as I did. She had this soft, unstoppable ambition - she had dreams of becoming a published author, always tapping away on her laptop after dinner whilst I relaxed on the couch. But without fail, every night, she’d close the lid and slide right there next to me, where she’d fall asleep on my shoulder. Then I’d carry her in my arms, carefully choosing my steps not to wake her, and tuck her into bed, and afterwards I’d clean up a little, turn off the television, and join her. Picturesque. Every night.

Until I kept waking up to a phone below 10%. 

It would happen semi-regularly; I’d say every second day, maybe once every three. I’d wake up to my alarm, go to hit snooze, and notice the ‘low battery’ alert on my home screen. The charger would be on the floor at the bottom of the bedside table, coiled up and pathetic, having somehow left the charging port in the night. Nothing was worse than having to do my morning business staring at the bathroom tiles. 

I brought it up to Angela after the third time. 

“Hey, love?” I asked from above a bowl of cornflakes. Her beautiful auburn hair, still in messy ribbons fresh from the shower, lightly flicked as she turned to face me.

“What’s up?” She asked. Calm. Polite. Genuine.

“Have you been unplugging my phone at night?” I asked, awfully careful to keep my tone as light-hearted as possible, but I had no other real explanation. I mean, the charging port was clean as a whistle and it *felt* secure. Maybe she was just charging her bluetooth earbuds or maybe the charger on her side of the bed was busted. All I wanted was an explanation.

“No,” She replied, slowly closing the fridge door, “I promise. I’ve been sleeping through the night.”

She was a heavy sleeper - always has been. Down to even the tone of her voice, there was no question that she was telling the truth. 

“Maybe it’s the-” she reached up to grab a bowl from the cabinet, huffing slightly, “-cable, maybe it’s loose or something.”

I nodded in agreement, dropped a canned joke I can’t remember…and that was that. We went on with our day. I did end up taking her advice, picking myself up a fresh charger on the ride home from work, and that night there was no issue. 

Problem solved. Thank fuck for that.

Except, it happened again. 

Rolling over with a yawn half-cast in my mouth, I go to turn off the alarm.  
There’s no alarm.

Fucking phone’s dead.

Angela was still out like a light with her Samsung plugged in next to the jewellery on her nightstand, drinking in all the charge it needed, and here I am, holding a paperweight. For a few moments I remained still; reminding myself to breathe and cooling off, there was nothing left to do but plug it back in and head to the bathroom to start my day.

Reaching down, I fumbled for the wire in the dark and jabbed it into my phone. There wasn’t a peep as I slipped out from the covers and headed down the hall.

Confronting her? Not an option.

No, I had to figure things out on my own. So whilst I was at work, I slipped my phone from my desk drawer and started flipping through options in the settings.

There was a charging graph, there in the battery tab. Green upward line for charging, red downward line for losing battery. It was an older phone so I expected some battery drain - but at around two in the morning, every night, the upward curve would instantly plummet down into a red slope. 

Settings. Security. Device activity.

A single unlock, it happened every night around the same time the phone would stop charging. Last night: 2:08am.

You needed a PIN. No face ID. No swipe. No ‘lift to unlock.’ I stared at the screen until the numbers blurred, because I knew the only other person who knew that code was my girlfriend. 

Yeah, *sleeping through the night*.

Why? Was she pranking me? Angela once tried throwing me a surprise birthday party but completely blew it because she couldn’t bear keeping a secret from me for more than a day. Bare-faced lying to me during breakfast? No. Not from her, not from Angela.

Knowing what I did, I turned off my phone and tried desperately to get back to work. 

That lasted maybe 20 minutes. 

Sooner or later I was right back on it, filing through every app: messages, notes, texts, emails, searching for exactly what it was she was doing on my phone so early in the morning. I hate to admit it, but my first thought was that she was suspecting me of something. Why else would she pull this cloak-and-dagger stuff?

I didn’t cheat on my girlfriend, alright. That was a fact. There was nothing to hide in the first place. If she wanted to look, she only had to ask…I mean, that’s why she knows the pin in the first place.

I opened the gallery because it was the last place left to check.

5 different photos stood out to me. I’m not exactly a photography person - I mean, Angela is - but my camera roll is mostly filled with QR codes, snaps of where I’ve parked and screenshots from online clothes retailers. Somewhere in that mess is a photo from college. 

And amongst all of that, sat under ‘Most Recent’, were 5 different photos of Angela.

‘Selfies’ - I guess. She’d snapped them from the shoulders up, her hair a frizzy mess from her pillow, and my silhouette slumped across the mattress to her left. She’s bolt upright and she’s smiling into the camera, flash on.

I love Angela’s smile. When you think of something so much, you can tell when you’re looking at a counterfeit. Whatever was staring back from my phone screen was a cheap knockoff, I really don’t know how else to describe it. 

Maybe it was in the eyes. They were two marbles pressed against her face. They looked like someone had cut them out of a magazine and pasted them over the real ones. They didn’t squint against the flash. They didn’t soften. They just… *stayed* there.

No, maybe it was the mouth itself. A perfectly visible top row of her teeth, a slight sag to her bottom lip that left it lopsided. Her face looked tensed up; not loose, like how she usually smirked whenever we took a picture together. I exited out onto my home screen, a photo of she and I perched in front of a sunset on our vacation to Hawaii, and the difference of her face as night and day.

That was my girlfriend.

I tapped back onto the gallery.

That was not.

Every photo coincided with the unlock times, the earliest being 1:37am and the latest at almost 4 in the morning. They were virtually identical, bar a change of clothes, always with me very slightly in frame.

My manager swung by and I quickly pocketed it, pretending to type and thinking all the meanwhile. I’d bring it up to her tonight after dinner, I figured.

“Hey, Ange, I found something weird on my phone.”  
It was a little after 7, my hands were still damp from the dishes and she was on the kitchen table with her Macbook casting a blue glow across her face. She stopped typing and turned, grasping the back of the chair, eyes like a deer in headlights.

“Uh, what’s up?” She asked, “Everything okay?”  
“Sorta.”  
Dredging my hands across a dishcloth, I took my phone from the counter and flicked through to those photos. “You’re…uh,” I approached, careful with my words, “...sleepwalking?”

Angela’s eyes fixed on the screen and her brow instantly turned up. I flicked through all five. Emotion stirred across her face, an unplaceable mix of shock and confusion, and she took the phone in her hands to scan back through.

“You’re taking them and putting my phone back on my nightstand, unplugged,” I said with a surprised exhale, trying my best for a perplexed smile. 

“I…” She went through for another round of swiping before handing me it back, “I guess I’m dreaming of being an influencer.”

We shared a chuckle. Mine sounded tinny.

There was a shred of hope that bringing it up would stop it dead in its tracks. A few nights later, that hope was shredded. A dead phone lay on my nightstand.

When I could, I went through and found the new photo. Nothing had changed from the others, she still had that forced smile - something you’d see on LinkedIn.

The idea of sleeping on the couch sparked my mind on the drive back from work a few nights later. I cringed at it. There was a stabbing pain to my chest when imagining her face as I took my pillow off the bed and grabbed a blanket from the cupboard: the guilt of it all. 

It’s not her fault, I know that. Everything up to this point was picture-fucking-perfect, separating us over my phone battery felt…immoral. Idiotic, even.

There was also the idea of changing my PIN, equally as undesirable, as I didn’t want to break that trust we’d spent 3 years building between ourselves. 

So I figured I’d stay up, catch her in the act. I read somewhere once that it wasn’t a good idea to wake somebody up who’s sleepwalking - but if I just observed I could figure another way around this. 

That night I put my coffee machine to good use and got a few cups down after dinner. Even Angela remarked - “coffee, this late?” - and I told her I had some report to write, a little white lie. When she was finally tired enough to go to bed, I told her I’d be there in a bit and made her comfortable on the mattress. Curling my fingers against the string of the lamp near the entrance, I gave a gentle pull and the room plunged to darkness.

I plugged my phone in and left the door ajar.

After hours of watching late-night television on mute, fighting against my flickering eyelids, and throwing back coffee, there was movement. A slight creak of the bedframe brought me back into the land of the living, and I gently turned my head away from Jimmy Kimmel on *Who wants to be a Millionaire?* to spy the entrance to our bedroom.

Her silhouette brushed by the gap in the door as she walked across to my side of the bed. Sure enough there was the telltale click of a charger being removed. Afterwards, muffled footsteps trailed as she gently eased herself back across the slit in the doorway. Covers shifted. She got into bed.

I started my approach. Creeping. My toes were stiffly pressing into the wood of the hallway floor. I was a kid again, sneaking snacks after dark. Everything jittered from the caffeine, my breath hissed.

The door was an arm’s length away. I gently touched the brass above the handle and let it drift further and further into the room. Hinges squeaked, and after a moment, I heard the aperture clack of a photograph being taken.

“Babe?” I asked as I looked toward the bed.

There she was, stiff-jointed and sat with her legs flat under the covers. She had her arm raised with the phone tight in her grip, smiling. It was even more unnerving in person. She wasn’t looking into the camera, more through it - burrowing a hole straight towards the wall.

“Babe?” I repeated.

Angela’s head snapped, literally fucking *snapped*, toward me. A flicker of movement, half a second tops. She was smiling at me now.

“Darling.”

She drew out both vowels: Angela never called me ‘darling.’ Matter of fact, I hated the word. 

“You’re sleepwalking…” I replied back, catching myself on my own words. There was no hiding it. I felt terror, raw terror. And, for the first time looking at my girlfriend, revulsion.

There was nothing. I hated nothing. I’d rather any other word from her mouth than the silence that followed. 

And then I realised I should’ve been careful with what I wished for.

Her mouth dropped open and she screeched. The noise could’ve shattered fine china, a whine that unearthed itself from the core of her throat and slashed across the room. It was primal, something reserved for our earliest ancestors, only to signify imminent danger.

Covers shifted and she jumped up, swinging her legs out of the bed. 

I jumped back and felt the stiff lampstand hit against my leg - it teetered, drifted, fell. The room was dark. The lightbulb was out, rolling in a small circle on the floorboards.

Under the small trickle of light from the hallway, I saw motion. Stomps. It was as if she was wading through the air, like it had become thick. 

“Darling.”

My feet acted without impulse, dragging me further and further out of the room. She continued. The bulb was right there. 

Her bare foot came across it with a sickening crunch. Her body jutted slightly where her weight was misplaced.

Glass. In her foot, on the floor. 

There was no turn in her eyes; she merely bent her knees and planted her feet in reaction. That wet smudge as she adjusted turned my stomach. Her mouth opened again.

I was out of the room now, and with a pulsing heart, I leant forward and took the doorhandle in both hands. With a twist of my waist, I heaved back, the boom of it against the frame outperforming the second scream from my girlfriend’s mouth.

“Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.”  
I repeated that as I held the door shut. Fight or flight.

Fight the love of my life? I had to go.

I turned and barrelled down the hallway: wearing nothing but boxer shorts and a t-shirt, I struggled with my keys on the hook by the door. In a snap-decision, I swiped my wallet from the glass dish near the shoe rack - could be gone for a while - and then I plunged myself into the cold of the night.  
Just my luck, I thought, as sideways rain and wind snapped against my exposed arms. Anything was better than what was in there. I hopped into our shared car, practically choking at the familiarity of her perfume, and twisted the gears into reverse.

The dashboard read ‘2:47am’ as I pulled into the only motel I knew, just off the highway onramp. I checked myself in for the night, although I could’ve spent it in the car: I just wanted the space. Barefoot and dripping wet in the reception, I must’ve been a sad sight for the poor clerk.

With no phone and without the stomach for any more late-night TV, I must’ve spent hours tossing and turning over the cheap motel bedsprings. Going over it, again and again. The glass. That crunch. The scream. But as the caffeine and the adrenaline left hand-in-hand, the world started to fog over. In only a few more moments, I would’ve been out like a light.

But the motel’s cheap door had caught on the deadbolt.

Amidst a caffeine crash for the ages, every limb felt arduous to move. My back was to the entrance as I stared across the ugly green wallpaper, but I could hear the movement. Hell, I could feel the draw of wind as the door finally managed to open.

There were wet, fleshy slaps of feet across the floorboard. 

I tried to move. I yearned to move. Couldn’t.

Covers ruffled. Bedsprings wheezed. Breath drew from whatever was behind me.

Taps. My phone’s opening sound. 

The snap of a photograph.

It was her. If not for the same ritual, it was the rapidly-spreading wet patch under the covers where my feet lay.

She slid out of the covers and continued the same process, circling the bedframe. Her movement was laboured, that cut up foot was beginning to show through her unsettling calm.

“Ba-” No words would come from my mouth, it was as if somebody had tied a pebble to the underside of my tongue; I couldn’t even crease my lips to speak. Sleep tugged and tugged at me to just close my eyes.

Angela dragged herself to the nightstand. The blood across her hands was still wet. And, in a surprising turn, I saw her hunch over near one of the plug sockets. Awkward and confused, she seemed to jam something against it over and over, until finally it caught. She ran her hand across the wire now protruding from the wall until she found its end, turning next to my phone which she struggled to grasp with her other hand. It was as if she hadn’t encountered these things before. 

Drawing them together, I heard the slight chime of my battery beginning to charge.

Oh, my Angela. 

She turned to watch over me wearing the same smile.

I knew we’d work it out. We are perfect. Picture perfect.

She trudged slowly back to her side of the bed and gently began to climb across the mattress until her body pressed against mine. It was cold and slippery.

I never thought I’d meet somebody like Angela. Sweet, outgoing, kind. I heard once that relationships are a two-way street: of course you’re bound to have arguments, but it’s the sorting things out that counts, you know?

I’m glad we overcame this issue together.
