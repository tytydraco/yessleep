 I am woken by the fluorescent lights above me. I seem to be lying down and it is not at all comfortable. There’s a constant ache in my limbs and I don't know where I am or how I got here. 

 The hum of the lights is annoying me and I want it to stop. My head starts pounding as I sit up on what appears to be an old mattress, no sheet, no pillows, nothing. I notice I am in a square room, it looks as if nobody has been here in decades. There's cracks in the off-white walls and the grey carpet is stained with what can only be ketchup or blood, almost inevitably the latter. The room doesn’t consist of much, the disgusting mattress on the floor, a worn wooden desk by which I am surprised is even standing and a lamp, one of those big ones with the string you pull to get it to turn on. It’s strange, because although there is a lamp, I cannot see a use for it; I am being blinded enough by the fluorescent lights on the ceiling, still I get up and walk over to it. Two steps into my journey however, I am met with an overwhelming urge to turn it on. The voice in the back of my head attempts to advise me against it. I reach for the string anyway. I pull it. 

 I am no longer in that strange old room, instead I find myself in a field, although… it's not really a field, or a realistic one I mean. The grass is too green and the sky is too blue. There’s a sun but it is not the sun I remember. I am met with a wave of nausea, one which lasts too long. I recognise this place yet I know I have never been. I did not believe this place was real but it makes sense now that I'm here. I don’t want to admit it to myself, as soon as I do this fever dream will be over. I don’t have a choice, I know where I am without a doubt.

 They call it The Backrooms. A neverending inescapable nightmare, an alternate reality consisting of dream-like places, often referred to as ‘rooms’, each having an occupant known as an entity, some are evil, some are kinder, but all are dangerous and I don’t have time to find out which type resides in this field. I don’t know much about this place, no one does, but I know enough to be scared out of my mind. I need to get out of here before I am trapped forever.

 I take a step forward and am transported into what looks like a rundown hotel, the carpet on the floor is awful and I am convinced it was designed to ward off any potential customers. The corridor is small and the walls feel like they're closing in on me, I know they aren’t, although that wouldn’t be much of a stretch considering where I am. I raise my head and confirm I am in a hotel, there are rooms dotted all down the hall, and the farther I look down it the more certain I am that the corridor is growing, stretching and expanding. Away from me.

 There is a sound behind me and as I whip my head around to find the source, a child bolts past me, screaming. Screaming so loud it hurts not only my ears but my gut too. I am momentarily frozen in shock. It never occurred to me that the possibility of others being here too wasn’t all that small. I start running after the child, we can help each other. 

 “Hey!” I try to call, “Wait up!” I attempt to shout. 

 But no words leave my mouth. I realise I can’t feel my mouth at all. It doesn’t matter, I continue down the hall and suddenly it changes, there is a corner now and I almost don't make it around without slamming into the wall. I do though, and just in time it seems as the child lunges for one of the door handles and rushes inside. I quickly follow. 

 It’s a bathroom and as I walk in I see the face of who I've been chasing. A brown haired boy, around my age I start to think, but then I can’t remember how old I am. It doesn't matter. I’ve caught up to him and now we can help each other. He’s sitting in the far corner of the windowless bathroom, his body racking with sobs, hugging his knees to his face. 

 “Please…” He whispers, “Let me go home.” 

 I’m confused, I don't have any power over his being here, I don’t even know the boy. I want out of here as much as he does and sitting crying about it isn't going to help anyone. I take a step towards him.

 “NO!’ He screams. 

 I stop. Then continue walking towards him, I’m not going to hurt him, surely that's obvious. My hands are outstretched in front of me so he can see I have no weapons of any sort. 

 “NO, STOP! PLEASE!” 

 I realise he’s looking to his left. I follow his gaze and notice the massive mirror spanning all along the wall. 

 I look at myself and freeze. Pure horror coursing through my veins, or maybe not. I don’t know if I have veins anymore. I understand why I can’t talk or remember my age. I understand why the boy was begging me to stay back. As I stare at my reflection in complete disbelief. My hair is gone and my head is square. My skin is green and my eyes and mouth are red slits in what I think is supposed to resemble skin. I do not see myself at all, or maybe I do, maybe I’ve always been this way. It’s not as if I can remember anything anymore anyway. 

 I don’t know where I am or how I got here but I remember my one and only objective. Catch the humans. And so, when I turn back around, that's exactly what I do. 








_hellooo, I wrote this as a contribution to my folio piece for school, what do you guys think? My teacher likes it but thinks I should add some metaphors or similies (classic english teacher) but I'm not sure where they would be most effective. I'm not trying to claim that this is amazing, just a little something I'm fairly proud of, please don't claim it as your own, or share it anywhere without my permission, but what do you guys think?_

_(P.S.- thank you for taking the time to read this!)_
