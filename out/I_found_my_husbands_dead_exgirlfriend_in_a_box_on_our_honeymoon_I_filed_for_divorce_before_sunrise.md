Our honeymoon night was supposed to be quiet.

We were staying in a small hotel in Goa. The ocean light was slipping through the curtains, the room smelled faintly of salt and sunscreen, and I was exhausted after a full day of travel. I don’t remember falling asleep—only waking up.

Something felt… off.

My husband was sitting on the edge of the bed, his back to me. In his hands, he was holding a small wooden box, cradling it the way someone holds something fragile. Precious.

At first, I thought it was a gift. Maybe something sentimental he wanted to share.

Then I heard him whisper a name.

“Anushka…”

My chest tightened.

Anushka was his ex-girlfriend. She had died four years ago in an accident. I knew about her. I knew her death had devastated him. I had never been jealous of a memory—or so I told myself.

But seeing him like that, in the middle of the night, holding that box like a treasure… it stirred something cold in my stomach.

“What are you doing?” I asked, half-asleep.

He flinched so hard he almost dropped the box. He turned around with the expression of a child caught doing something wrong.

“Nothing,” he said quickly, sliding the box under his pillow. “Just thinking.”

I sat up.

“What’s in the box?”

He hesitated. Too long.

“It’s… Anushka’s ashes.”

I felt numb.

“You brought her ashes on our honeymoon?”

“She always wanted to come to Goa,” he said, not meeting my eyes.

Then he stood up and went to take a shower.

I stayed frozen on the bed.

Something about his voice—about the way he avoided looking at me—told me I hadn’t heard the whole truth.

When the bathroom door closed, I reached for the pillow.

The box was lighter than I expected.

I told myself not to open it. That it was wrong. Disrespectful.

But I needed to know.

Inside the box, there were no ashes.

Instead, there was a gold chain with the name **“Anushka”**, neatly folded letters tied with a ribbon… and a photograph.

A recent photograph.

Anushka stood smiling in front of a mirror.

Alive.

At the bottom of the box was a handwritten note in delicate cursive:

*“When she falls asleep, meet me.”*

My hands started shaking.

By 6 AM, my bags were packed.

I told my husband I wanted a divorce. He didn’t argue. He didn’t ask why. He just looked at me with something that felt disturbingly close to relief.

I left.

Two weeks later, while staying at my parents’ house, I received a call from an unknown number.

“Did you enjoy Goa?” a woman asked calmly.

I hung up.

That evening, I received an email.

**Subject:** *I’m sorry you found out this way.*

Attached was a video.

CCTV footage from our hotel.  
Timestamp: **2:17 AM. Our honeymoon night.**

I watched my husband leave the room.

Five minutes later, **Anushka entered**.

She stood beside my sleeping body, stared at me for a few seconds… and then looked directly into the camera and smiled.

The email ended with one line:

*You made the right decision. He was never free.*

Three days later, I read the news.

My husband was found dead in the same hotel room. The police ruled it a suicide.

One item was missing from the room.

The wooden box.

Sometimes, late at night, I get WhatsApp notifications from an unknown contact.

No messages.

Just a profile picture.

Name: **Anushka**.
