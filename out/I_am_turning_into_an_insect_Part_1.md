I am going to start this by saying that there is a reason I am so helplessly stupid and weak, I'm disabled.

I was born with a deformed leg, The muscle was poorly developed, and the bone was crooked, so running is nearly impossible, Even walking normally is somewhat difficult.

I'm also low iq because of brain damage, I fell down a lot and before my parents got the idea of strapping a helmet to my head, I fell down the stairs and my eggs were scrambled prematurely.

I live in a suburban cul-de-sac at the end of the circle, and the other 2 houses are just big vacation homes that are normally empty.

I have the place to myself, Nobody in my immediate family loves me, and I have few friends.

Whatever, you didn't come for a sob story.

I had received an email asking me if I wanted to sign up for a chance to change my life and begin anew, All they wanted was my location, That was it.

Being the autistic, impulsive bozo I was, I didn't read the fine print and sent it in.

The next day, I received a strange, purple serum with the consistency of water, About 10 ounces of it were in each bottle, Totaling in 3 of them.

The instructions commanded me to pour it on meat, Saying this would make it more nutritious.

I read the fine print this time, but all that was said was that it worked best with medium rare meat, I sucked at cooking meat to perfection, so I supposed that wouldn't be hard.

I grilled up some chicken and curiously put a drop of it on the morsel of white meat.

I put it in my mouth and chewed, I felt a sour taste, but at the same time, my brain drowned in endorphins.

I hastily poured the rest of it on all of the chicken, and devoured it with the determination of an animal, choking once but not letting up.

I stood at the table, gasping for air and staring at the messily consumed meal with a grimace on my face, I felt like I had been drugged.

I decided to send an e-mail to the company, asking for an explanation,  maybe this was supposed to be elephant food or something?

Not throwing that vile substance away proved to my worst mistake, Blame me, and I walked into this trap.

Anyway, 2 days later, I woke up to knocking on my door, It was a group of people, what appeared to be a doctor, and a bunch of muscular men in military-like armor.

They told me that they wanted to do some tests, for my own health and safety, and everything was going to be fine.

They were not the police, so I tried to slam the door in their face, but one of them managed to fit a boot in the way before I could.

And as you can predict, I was painfully dragged out of my house by the men, And thrown into the back of a van.

I don't know where I was taken, Since I was blindfolded and tied up for most of it, But eventually, I was taken to a facility, Concrete walls and barbed wire, that kinda stuff, It was also in the middle of a desert, So not too many witnesses.

I was eventually dragged inside, despite my horror-filled please, and taken to a holding cell, nothing but a wood platform for a bed and a toilet.

"This is where you will be kept for the time being, If you behave, And be patient, We will take you someplace far more comfortable."

As I sat, I remembered that they didn't take any of my possessions, I still had my phone, And I'm sure how, But they have open wifi here, Maybe it's because this place is more normal during daytime, Maybe they are fucking with me, I don't know.

So now, After a few days here, I sit on the wood bed, My face buried in my hands as I weep, Thinking of a mother who never loved me, A father who never had faith in me, And brothers who barely knew me.

Somehow, I have a paranoid feeling that the worst of this place is yet to come, And I don't think they plan on releasing me so suddenly, I've already been in this place for 3 days, And they refuse to tell me anything.

My name is Thomas Baker, and I need help, Please.
