I should’ve known. If there’s a pretty fish lying helplessly on the shore, do not take it home.

My fiancé and I found this gorgeous top-floor apartment, with high windows and an ocean view. We were both romantics, and he told me that the sound of the waves helped him sleep. So we pooled our savings and bought it together as a wedding gift to each other. But most nights, while I snuggled against his chest, the water crashed over and over in my ear, keeping me wide awake. It’s hard to complain, though, when the view got hundreds of likes on social media.

I was still groggy when morning came. We clutched our hot paper cups and went out for a walk; barefoot, just to spend some quality time before lunch. The beach was empty except for one jogger with his dog. He wore a yellow overall, waving at us. I could’ve mistaken him for a Teletubby, but he’s our neighbor, so we waved back.

Cold briny air tousled our hair, it was a beautiful day except for the clouds. Streaks of gray crossed the sky; wet sands sucked our feet, and that’s when I saw it.

A fish.

I thought it was stained glass at first. Red, blue, green, orange fins, shimmering. How pretty! It flopped on the sand, its mouth gaping, opening and closing. So I sipped my coffee, dumped the rest, and scooped the fish gently into my cup then filled it with seawater. 

My fiancé grinned at me, his dimple deepening. “Oh, we got our first pet,” he said. “I thought it’d be a puppy.”

“Yup. Isn’t it pretty?” I beamed back at him, slipped my hand into his, and the three of us walked home.

He prepped our brunch, just a quick sandwich, while I washed out the pickle jar; poured in the seawater from the cup, then I added the fish. It swam around. Alive, thankfully. So I nipped a corner of my sandwich and sprinkled in the bread crumbs. But the fish let them sink and watched me instead. Fish don’t have eyelids, right? But there was something ominous in those glaring yellow beads; I lost my appetite because of it.

So I moved the jar to the coffee table. Later, I told myself, I’d release it back into the sea. But when my fiancé had his last bite, the fish had tripled to the size of a lemon; almost filling the jar.

“That’s weird,” my fiancé said.

“Right?”

“But it’s our first pet,” he said. “And I’m curious. Will it keep growing if we put it in the tub?”

“Nah, we might kill it if it’s not seawater. Let’s just release it—”

But the fish thrashed, slamming against the glass; it fell and shattered. My fiancé hurried to clean up the shards as I scooped the fish; heavy like a grapefruit, as if it had absorbed the water, and I rushed it to the bathroom. 

I let the tap running, and the water rose slowly, submerging its flopping body. I washed my slippery hands of its smell; it swam around the tub, flashing its colors like stained glass.

“How pretty.” I reached in and caressed it; the fish seemed to enjoy my touch. Ack! It bit me. I yanked my finger; blood welled up to the size of a needle pin, and I instinctively sucked it. The fish grinned at me. It really did! I wasn’t imagining it. Those rows of tiny, sharp teeth made me bolt out in panic.

“What’s wrong?” my fiancé asked me as he crouched over to reach a piece of shard.

“Nothing,” I said. “Let’s return it to the sea.”

He stood up to examine my wound. “Yeah… let’s get a puppy.”

I smiled at his joke, and we carried the fish down in a bucket. Pretty heavy, as its size kept expanding. But once we tipped it into the waves, that was it. No more fishy problems.

I high-fived my fiancé, and we returned home, finally getting the chance to focus on our wedding. I rechecked the guest list twice and confirmed the RSVPs until my phone turned warm in my grasp. I took a break and browsed for any information about the pretty, stained-glass-colored fish. But there wasn’t any. The only image that matched my description came from a fantasy site. The illustration was hand-drawn and looked clumsy; I had to chuckle. It also said that the fish was the temporary form of a merman prince. So I ignored it.

Life moved on, and everything returned to normal… or I wished it had.

The following day, I rang my new neighbor's apartment, as it might’ve been rude if we hadn't invite him. I waited, but no one came. So I slipped the invitation into his letterbox by the door; he might’ve gone jogging with his dog.

But when my fiancé and I went down, yellow do-not-cross tapes were all over the porch of the apartment complex. The police line warded off the crowd of people, and at the center of it, my neighbor’s dog wailed at someone wrapped in blankets. Murky red stained the surface. That was my neighbor! I turned around and squirmed, hiding my face against my fiancé’s chest. The only witness, a passerby who also lived in one of the units, stood a few feet from the victim, seemed traumatized to the point he couldn’t move, or answer the investigator coherently.

I asked around, “What happened?”

The pale-faced woman I spoke to shrugged. “Someone robbed the poor soul, but the thief passed on his wallet or phone, just his clothes and…” She couldn’t finish her sentence.

How horrible! Who would do such a thing? But my fiancé and I didn’t ask the question out loud, only exchanged glances. We didn’t walk far that day and returned home; we felt uneasy. Why would anyone want someone else’s sweaty overalls? And I heard he also lost his… legs? The assailant’s sadistic method freaked out the entire complex. Even from where I lived, I looked down through the window glass and saw people dragging their suitcases away from the building.

“Babe,” I said to my fiancé after a long silence, “should we sell this apartment? What do you think?”

“Let’s wait a bit. When the developer builds a shopping complex, maybe the price will go back up, then we’ll put it on the market.”

I nodded, and the question lingered; but our big day arrived, and it was too late to change anything. A warm breeze tousled the drapes of the makeshift altar, as we had opted to exchange our vows by the sea. 

Let’s just get through today, I convinced myself. 

It was a sunny day when we got married; the weather forecast got it right. The guests, close family members and friends, had not uttered a single complaint. My man and I sealed our lips about the recent incident, as we didn’t want to scare anyone. They seemed to know something, but smiled back anyway. Sand slipped into their shoes, my mother’s shawl fluttered in the wind.
 
Everyone cheered as I passed them in a white gown. The tulle folds made it heavy, but hey, I only get to wear it once. It was so pretty, I couldn’t choose another. Then my man and I faced each other, everything felt right and we were about to kiss, but suddenly a wave crashed into the shore, followed by an eerie, high-pitched shriek; we turned to the sea instead.

Then I saw it; the fish.

I just knew that it was our ex-pet, even if it resembled a human, with a head, neck, torso, and limbs. Though the red, blue, and green scales hadn’t changed, still covering ‘his’ skin. But what scared me the most was his clothes: the yellow jogging overall that belonged to my neighbor. Then my man’s back blocked most of my view; I muffled my scream when I caught a glimpse of the creature’s face. It was my neighbor’s! Grinning at me, with those rows of tiny, sharp teeth. 

Everyone stood to ward it off as ‘he’ kept advancing. Folded chairs scattered, their ribbons and fabric covers littered the shore; shouts and screams, while my aunts carried their kids away. It was chaotic.

Then the day turned dark; everyone looked aside and screamed. A tidal wave overshadowed us, and we stumbled to the building. Some tripped on the sand, but we pulled each other up. My steps caught on my gown; I fell, and my cheek met the sand. Some grit getting into my ear along with the shriek, mixing with growls, harsher than the crashing waves I’d heard every night. It came after me, and someone pulled me up, but its grip was slippery. I didn’t dare to face it, but I recognized the fishy smell.

The smell was diluted by the crashing waves that pulled me with ‘him’. It hurt less than I thought, somehow I felt light in the creature’s embrace. I still wouldn’t open my eyes and hold my breath. What now? I thought, as I was about to die. 

“How pretty.”

I heard ‘him,’ not a shriek or a growl, but close to how I once said it. Seawater seeped into my nose, as I tried to hold my breath. But I could only do so for so long, and I choked on saltwater as I tried to escape ‘his’ clutch. It was slippery, and I almost made it, but the heavy wedding dress stunned my movement. I couldn’t swim up.

Familiar hands, my husband’s, wrapped around me and kicked ‘him.’ Then I felt the ripping fabric of my gown; finally I could swim with everything I had. Up. I reached the shore and crawled, pushing all the water out, but my husband grabbed my arm and together we ran.

Time passed. It was nighttime, and we found ourselves in the ER waiting room. Uncle had a cardiac arrest, so we had to rush him to the hospital. The whole family was present, but no one talked about what we saw. My husband’s jacket was draped over my shoulders, and my mother had wrapped her shawl around my waist. A kind soul from the wedding organizer team boxed our supposed gala dinner and delivered it to us. We all ate in silence until we received the news that Uncle had survived the night.

Whenever anyone asked what happened, we answered, “It was the bad weather.” Except for my young cousin who said, “A sea monster!” between her sobs. Then my aunt would take her out for a walk.

Yeah, of course it was the bad weather. A merman wrecking a wedding wouldn’t make sense. Who would’ve believed it? We couldn’t let rumors tarnish our reputation, that the whole family had lost their marbles.

But we knew the truth.

We bid everyone goodbye, went home and moved on.

We got married and still had to stay at the place, since its price had dropped. No, it was a free fall. So it’ll take some time before we can sell it. We adopted my neighbor’s dog, as it had an attachment to the place too.

It wasn’t a perfect situation, but the view still looked like a living painting. Every night, when I snuggled against my husband’s chest, he‘d sleep soundly. But the waves never stopped crashing and kept calling me, “Pretty.” 

So I got up. How could I sleep? I just had to write about it. If there’s a pretty fish lying helplessly on the shore, please don't take it home.

Because the merman is not your friend.
