If you ask anyone with a passion for writing what the best feeling in the world is, I would bet money on them saying the feeling they get when writing. But, it's not just the writing that is special. It's the beautiful feeling of putting your innermost thoughts onto a page. Being able to share a mystical world you've created in your mind. It feels vulnerable. Like you are cracking your own head open and putting it on display for anyone to see. To love, to hate, to judge. The moment you feel your thoughts just falling onto the page. It's like you're not even thinking about it. It just somehow falls in place and makes a coherent story that you've put everything into. It's unlike any drug or any other high. The feeling of ideas flowing. Creativity. That is everything to a writer. So, what is the worst feeling in the world for a writer then? I bet that isn't a hard question for anyone. Writer's block. Few things feel worse when you are a writer.



What do you think happens when a writer gets writer's block? It's the complete opposite feeling. Not having any ideas in your head to escape to throughout the day can feel like hell. It's like the drug has been taken from you but you can just get more by buying some. It's not like running to the store to grab a six-pack of beer. That dopamine is blocked until *you* have a new fresh idea. Your own flesh and bone stopping you from pleasure. 



That's not even taking into account the pressure from others to write and get something out that will do well. 



All that being said, I am here to talk to you all about what happens when a writer is *desperate* for an idea and the lengths they will go to for an idea. 



My good friend Thomas went missing last week. He was a writer who found a way around his writer's block through very unconditional methods that led to his disappearance. 



To do this whole situation justice, I need to go back. Way back to when I met Thomas.



The two of us met in our junior year of college in a writing class. We were both put in a writing group with three other people. We both had an amazing time with the class and the writing group. 



I always knew the reason I enjoyed it so much was *because* of Thomas. After we finished the class, the two of us continued to meet up and help each other out with our writing projects or bounce ideas off of one another. Even on days we just wanted to hang out and play video games or something, it would always end up with us talking about our writing projects. Short stories, screenplays, books, all of it.



Thomas felt like an absolute machine when it came to stories. For the most part, I felt like I could keep up with him, but the guy always had some new idea to tell me about. I've never met someone who has my style of writing like him. 



We both liked writing in many different styles. I don't think I have a favorite genre but without a doubt, Thomas liked writing horror the most. 



I think people make a lot of assumptions when someone writes horror. Especially if they are a *good* horror writer. They must be really messed up in the head to come up with such terrifying ideas. A murderer, a psychopath, a deeply disturbed individual. The truth is that couldn't be farther from who Thomas was. One of the kindest, gentlest people you'd ever meet.  



I remember when he started to act strange. We were at a house party with maybe fifteen old friends from college. I saw Thomas being quiet in the corner. Now, to the average person, this probably looked like normal behavior for him. He wasn't a big party person. Whenever I did convince him to come to one with my extraverted-ass, he would prefer to just observe everyone else and I would do all the talking for him. He said that watching people in conversation helped him with his writing. 



That being said, I could tell he was off. He was looking down and just seemed empty…



After knowing him for so long I swore I could tell when he was in his own imaginary world. I could see the gears turning in his head and I'd get so excited to hear all about his new idea later. 



I should've gone up to him at that moment. Instead, I just stood at the beer pong table like a damn idiot. There were so many moments when I could've gone over to him to talk, but I didn't. Thomas has never been one to talk about feelings but that doesn't excuse me from not wanting to try. I'm not a guy big on feelings either but I don't try and actively avoid it. The mix of loud music, alcohol, and pretty girls definitely made it hard for me to talk to my buddy about how he felt. 



That night ended with him giving me and a few other guys a ride home. He was normally our DD for nights like this. He always said he didn't want a clouded-up head just in case he got an idea. Some might say a shot or two would only help, but not Thomas. He wasn't a religious guy, he just always wanted to be ready for an idea. It was his whole life. Always escaping into his own little world of make-believe and fantasy. It was always more fun to him than the real world. 



I sometimes felt like the only reason he wanted to be my friend was because I helped give him ideas to escape into. Sure sometimes we’d watch a football game or go to a party, but ugh, I don't know. I guess sometimes I felt used. I would push off those thoughts when they pierced my brain because I didn't know if I was using him too. Would I even be his friend if he wasn't a good writer? 



I guess we pick our friends for a reason right? Similar hobbies or interests? Maybe we did use each other for our own personal gain, but is it all that bad if we are *both* doing it? 



Sorry, I went on a bit of a side tangent there, I'm still processing so much.



Anyway, back to that night after the party.

I was the last person he needed to drop off that night. As he pulled up to my house he said goodbye but I got the courage to ask him if he was okay.



“Hey man, you good?”



“Yeah, just tired” he murmured without looking up.



“Okay, well are we still good to meet up tomorrow for lunch?” I asked, accepting that to perk him up. 



“Oh, about that, I think I'm actually busy tomorrow, sorry.”



“What do you mean busy? It's Saturday. What else could you possibly want to do other than talk about our projects? 



“You know I have other things I need to do sometimes right?” he responded with annoyance.



“Damn dude, chill. I'm just trying to help. We can just skip this week's meeting okay?” I said, trying to make eye contact.



“Yeah fine,” he whispered while facing his body farther from mine.



I got out of the car and he raced off. As I got into my room I felt so annoyed. It felt like he blew me off. I had projects that needed to be worked on. I needed his help and input on things. I knew if it was the other way around he'd be pissed off. 



As the morning came along, I started to cool down. If he needed space I should give it to him. Maybe I needed a break too.



The week went by without me hearing from him. It wasn't that out of the ordinary to go a week without hearing from him but after the way he was acting, I was definitely anxious to see him again. 



We typically hung out on Saturday afternoon so I texted him on Friday to make sure we were still good to meet up. He gave me a few excuses for why he couldn't meet but I convinced him.



As we met up at our normal place I saw him walk in as I sat at the table. I've never seen him so lifeless. His hair was greasy and his clothes were unkempt. I saw his red eyes and the bags underneath them to match from the other side of the room. 



He made eye contact with me and put on the fakest smile I have ever seen in my life. 



He walked to the table and sat down with way too much fake enthusiasm.  



“Hey Jake sorry I've been so busy. I want to hear the progress you've made and what new stuff you have going on!” Thomas stated with Inauthentic cheer. 



I paused and squinted my eyes at him. Waiting for it to be a joke or something. Normally I have to fight him to talk about myself but now he is telling me to go first?



“Um, no worries. You needed some space. I can respect that. But can I ask again if everything is okay? You can go first if you want, I really don't mind.” I said but was met with the still-lasting plastic smile of my friend.



“Please, you go,” Thomas said through his teeth while his smile was starting to break and the tone of voice was flat. 



I didn't want to keep pushing him. Him sitting and listening to me talk was way better than him storming out because he didn't want to talk first.



I started to tell him what I was working on and showed him some mock-ups I had. I must've talked for an hour straight without interruptions. That was unheard of from him. We would always bounce back and forth, sometimes interrupting each other with ideas. It never felt rude. It's just how we talked. 



In the hour of my talking, I left so many spaces for him to resound to me or give input. The conversation was so bare and boring like an awkward first date where I'm doing all the talking. 



For the first time in our whole friendship, I ran out of things to say.



“Alright, I appreciate you giving me space to talk but I'd love to hear what you have going on,” I said with hope but was only met with glossy eyes looking back at mine. He sat frozen looking at me. Looking like he was going to talk but sat for a good minute before responding to me.



“Well, this was nice. Thanks for meeting up with me. I think I should get going.” He said while pushing himself back in his chair to stand up. 



“Thomas please stay and tell me what is going on…please,” I begged him while he fought the urge to leave that restaurant. 



Without making eye contact he slowly sat back down. We sat in silence as I waited for him to speak up. I was only met with brief glimpses that held embarrassment and shame. I started to get even more worried but he finally spoke up.



“Okay fine I'll talk, but please don't tell anyone else what I’m about to tell you.” Thomas managed to say to me while looking at his shoes. 



I was prepared for him to tell me he killed someone with the way he was talking and acting. I dug my fingernails into the side of my thigh to prepare myself to not react to whatever wild thing was about to come out of his mouth. 



“I…I have writer's block.” He whispered with guilt. 



“Wait, what? Writer's block? You scared me!” I said with relief.



“Seriously? I thought of all the people you would get it,” he said with frustration finally meeting my eyeline. 



“No, that's not what I met, I was just trying to say-” I replied as I got interrupted.



“This isn't just a case of writer's block. This is something so much worse. I have nothing. Nada! That isn't me. I have no place in my mind to escape. No on-going stories I can add to during the day. When I sit down at my desk every night to write I just stare at the screen, mindless. Sometimes sure, I feel stuck or a little lost. Maybe I need some time to map a storyline out. But do you know what I do when that happens? I move on to another story. Or work on a character or…I don't know. I work on *something,* but I have nothing. Nothing at all. My mind is blank. No ideas.” He sat for a moment thinking. I gave him the space that he needed until he gathered his thoughts “I am nothing if I don't have my ability to create” He admitted with a deep breath. 



“Listen, this will pass. I promise. Every single writer loses inspiration at some point. You will find a spark again. You just need to push through it. Go on a trip, get away, go do something new.”



“You don't understand. I've tried everything I can. I feel so empty.” 



“Come on! I know you got this. How about we go do something fun tomorrow? Maybe you need to stop trying to get an idea. That's how we've gotten some of our best stories, right? While messing around doing something dumb?” I said as I saw a slight glimmer of hope in his smile.



“Yeah okay. Let's give it a shot. Why not, I've got nothing left to lose.” 



“Great, pick me up at noon tomorrow and we can go ride roller coasters or something?” 



“Sure, I can do that.” He remarked as I saw the tiniest bit of the old Thomas start to peak through his hard new shell.



That next day, everything started to fall apart.



I was spending the morning just hanging out around my house. Not really watching the time or anything. I was just walking through my kitchen when I glanced at the clock on my oven ‘1:03’ I read as my heart sank. I looked at my phone praying that I had a notification from him saying he was going to be late but I was met with an even worse message.



*‘On my way over’ Sent at 11:45.* 



The pit in my stomach only deepened as I read the sent time. I thought he just bailed on me, I never imagined something happened to him.



I tried to call him over and over again but his phone went straight to voicemail. I tried to get in contact with other people he knew but didn't have many of their contacts. After what felt like an eternity I got a text from him. 



*“I’m at the Newbridge hospital room 501, get here asap.”* 



I jumped in my car and got there as fast as I could. 



I finally made it to the hospital. Unsure what I was going to see when I got to his room. It was a good sign that he was the one to text me, but why was he so vague? 



The room I entered was filled with the sound of a loud clicking keyboard and a focused Thomas. He had a large bandage on his left forearm with many cuts and bruises covering his whole body. 



“Tom? Oh my gosh, what happened?” I said in shock but was only met with a bright glowing smile from my very happy friend.



“The best thing ever. That's what happened!” He replied giddy as a little kid. 



“What are you talking about? Did you crash your car on your way over? How badly are you hurt?” 



“Stop, stop. None of that matters. I'm fine. What really matters is that I got a story Idea. That's what I'm typing up now. Oh man, I feel so alive right now!” He proclaimed as he passionately typed on his laptop. 



“What? That's awesome, how did you get an idea yesterday?” I asked as I got closer to my friend in his hospital bed. He suddenly stopped and took his eyes off his computer screen for the first time since I entered the room.



“I…I flipped my car.” Thomas said while folding his laptop screen to see me better 



“You.. you flipped it? Oh my gosh, are you okay?”



“Yes I'm fine, but I don't think you understand, I got my idea when I flipped my car.” 



“Well is your story about a car accident or something?” I said while leaning in.



“No that's the thing. It has nothing to do with a car. I just… I don't know if I can't even explain it. My tire popped out of nowhere. My car did a complete barrel roll. I was in mid-air for maybe five seconds at most. You know how some people say their whole life flashes before their eyes when they think they are about to die? That kind of happened but it was different for me. Those five seconds felt like hours. I remember accepting the fact that I was going to die. I felt it in my bones. I gripped down on my steering wheel and closed my eyes. I thought I was going to see death but I didn't. I saw a complete storyline. A beginning, middle, and end. I saw characters, plot lines, twists, and turns. A whole beautiful story. I don't know how to explain it but when I thought I was going to die, it cured my writer's block. I can't believe that's what it took.” 



“That's great man. I'm glad some good came out of it.” I smiled 



“No, no, it isn't just *some good* this is huge I feel better!” I saw something strange in him at that moment. He looked terrible. Sure, he could have looked way worse considering he flipped his freaking car but It was shocking to see all those cuts. Yet, he had such a fire behind his eyes. At what first seemed like a good passion started to feel like an obsession. Like Gollum holding the one true ring. 



I didn't end up staying long as some family showed up soon after me. I didn't want to overstay my welcome. 



Fortunately, he wasn't in the hospital for long. I met up with him in person just a couple days later because he seemed excited to talk about new projects. 



I was really hoping when I saw him face to face that scary look in his eye would be gone but I was sorely mistaken. I saw him and was met with not only a crazed look in his eye but more cuts and buries. 



He slammed down a binder and several notebooks onto the table in front of us. He didn't even look me in the eye or ask me how I was. He immediately started to run through his ideas and talk a million miles an hour. I interrupted him just minutes after he started.



“Thomas,” I said as I was met with a glair for interrupting. “Slow down, have you slept since you got in that car accident?” He blinked at me slowly and glanced around as if he was just coming out of a coma. 



“No, I haven't slept much really. But now that I have Ideas, I can't sleep. I don't want to lose them. I can't go back to not having ideas. I'm nothing without them.” 



“Stop saying that.” We stared at each other blankly for what felt like forever. “Can you tell me how you got more injuries?” I said as he broke eye contact and tried to go back to his piles of papers on the table. “Hey, answer me. I’m worried about you. Please talk to me.” He looked around timidly then started to whisper. 



“Okay, I'll talk. After I crashed my car, I got that amazing idea. I got my first drift down in record time. It was coming together great. But I fell into a depression again after I finished it. I was hoping my writer's block curse was broken. I thought ideas would just start to magically come out of my head. However, that wasn't the case. The accident helped me come up with just that one idea. Then nothing. But then I realized. If a near-death experience gave me an idea, what if I just almost died again? And…well…it worked. I went for a swim in the ocean yesterday to clear my head and got caught in a terrible current. I gave up and started to drown when a surfer grabbed me out of the water. As I started to struggle in the water, pictures started coming into my head. Fully formed stories. I felt like I was dying but I didn't care. Something happens to me when I think I'm going to die.” 



“Okay, maybe you are overthinking this. What if we tried bungee jumping or something? Something a little bit more controlled?” 



“No, I tried that. I have to fully give in to death. I can't be scared. I can't do something that makes my stomach drop, I have to think I'm about to die. Maybe it's my brain's last-ditch effort to try and keep me alive. My brain knows the thing to keep me most motivated to stay alive would be to give me a story idea that I just have to write down. Little does it know it could be the thing that ultimately kills me in the end.” He said with a chuckle as he sipped his coffee. 



“Thomas, don't say that. This will not be how you die. I won't let you just kill yourself.”



“Fine, then you tell me how on earth am I supposed to stop doing this? I found a surefire way to come up with amazing ideas and I'm supposed to just stop?  I'm sure I can find a controlled way to almost die. And even if I don't, I will die doing what I love most.” 



“I can not believe you are just accepting this as your fate. It is selfish of you to be okay with just dying one day. Think of how me and your family will feel without you. You have to think of more than just yourself here…please.” I begged my friend. 



“Jake, I have no plans to die. I will be fine. I'm not going to just throw myself around every day trying to kill myself.” 



“Fine, just please try and be as safe as you can be. I mean, as safe as someone purposely trying to die can be.” I said with disbelief at what just came out of my mouth. 



I walked away from that conversation confused and worried. My friend seemed truly happy for the first time in so, so, long but, I couldn't rest easy knowing at any minute he could be dying somewhere. I always felt like I needed to go to his house or call him just to make sure he wasn't in the middle of trying to escape death. 



Every time I saw him he had the best ideas he's ever had. He was also having great success with the things he was coming up with. He was making money from posting stories online and even got a book deal. I saw my friend beaming with joy. It was so hard to be happy for him. His happiness was always in the frame of his injured body. A new cast or bandage appears weekly. One day he barely had his voice left. I saw a mark around his neck where a noose had been. The man escaped a self-induced hanging, all for a short story about a magical car that people disappear into or something. 



My friend was fading and he was fading fast. He was a victim to himself. Addicted to almost dying and the high of ideas that came from it. 



He got put on suicide watch at one point. Spent a few weeks in a mental hospital. After he got out of course he just started back up again but realized he had to find methods that didn't leave obvious marks on his skin. He couldn't look like he wanted to die. To most people around him, he seemed fine. Just passionate about his writing projects, in reality, he was still almost dying multiple times a week. 



Maybe I should have told someone he was still *almost* killing himself. No, I definitely should have told someone. I just knew if I told someone he would just resent me and keep doing what he was doing once they let him go again. 



He was actually suicidal. He wasn't mentally unwell. It was the best he had ever been, his happiness just came with an extra cost and risk



I stopped asking him how he was almost killing himself. I knew he did it again when he had a sudden surge of ideas. He got really good at controlling it. He had streamlined ways of electrocution and drowning that seemed to work a lot of the time. Although, I think he was losing brain cells because of it. When I would read some of his work there would be more misspellings than usual. He seemed to have trouble with math and he never did before. He was slowly killing his brain but he didn't care. 



This all brings us to a few days ago. As I said at the beginning of this post, Thomas went missing a week ago. Well, most of you probably caught on already, but Thomas was found dead in his car at the bottom of a lake.



It would seem his normal ways of controlling ‘*almost death’* didn't cut it for him this time. He took the two first ways he almost died and put them together. Almost dying in his car and almost dying in the water. It felt rather poetic.



After I found out my friend died I didn't know how to feel. I felt guilty for not doing more, and then I realized the second Thomas almost died the first time in that car when he was truly gone. That's when I lost my best friend. Writing went from a hobby to an obsession; an addiction. Something clicked in his head or shook out of place when that damn Subaru flipped. It took my friend and gave me something back that was unrecognizable. He couldn't live in reality anymore, he was only happy in his imaginary land that existed somewhere deep within him. A place I couldn't get to. 



I miss him dearly. I know he died doing what he loved but that doesn't make it hurt less. 



Yesterday in the midst of my grieving, I made a huge mistake. My curiosity got the better of me. Part of me wanted to see what the hype was all about, another part of me wanted to feel closer to him. So I did something dumb. 

I went to the same lake he was found in. I tied one end of a rope to a brick and the other end to my leg. I had a knife in my pocket and I jumped into the water. 



It was a small brick so I didn't sink fast, but wow was I amazed. 



I could feel the pressure building up in my head. My lungs desperately wanted to take a deep breath but I held back as long as I could. I reached for the knife in my pocket right after I hit the water, but it felt like a lifetime before the blade reached the rope that was pulling me to my death. I started to cut my way through with all my strength. I started to see flashing in front of my eyes. A moving picture. It was happening…Time was slowing, my mind was sharpening, and ideas flowing. I couldn't resist the urge to try and take a breath any longer, it felt like my body was splitting into two. One part just wanted air and the other half wanted to stay in the water and keep downloading this idea that was infiltrating my head. Even if it meant that it killed me. At that moment I wanted to live and I wanted to die. 



The rope broke and I swam to the top. I burst through the water and gasped for air. I got to the edge of the lake and collapsed in exhaustion. I sat looking up at the sky. My heart was pounding and my lungs felt a sense of relief with every deep breath I took. 



I went home to write down the idea I had and couldn't believe the feeling I had. All I wanted to do was almost die again. 



Now it's all I can think about. It's not even completely about getting story ideas. I wasn't really struggling with that. But when I was in that water…I don't even know if I can put it into words. It's like something in that water wanted me to die. Like it was taunting me to not live. My body still took over and made sure I lived, but part of me felt okay with dying.  



I am terrified that this wasn't just the ending to Thomas, but the end of me too. 



I don't think writers are disturbed or messed up in the head. We aren't psychopaths or serial killers. I think we are just desperate. Desperate for that high of an idea. But please, I beg of you. Don't go looking for ideas in desperate places, because one day, those ideas will kill you.
