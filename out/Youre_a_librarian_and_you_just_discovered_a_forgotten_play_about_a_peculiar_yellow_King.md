"When did all of this start", you wonder, as you kneel on the layer of filth that has accumulated over eons in this dark subway tunnel, free of the burning light of the moon and untainted by wandering tramps and other vagrants of this city's crepuscular fauna. The structure in front of you, built of bone and fabric, stretched outward with inviting arms waiting for a lost soul to engage in its loving embrace. To nurture it. To melt their sanity with truths best left unknown.

It wasn't until one cool autumnal October evening, deep into the ink like abyss of night, did you, the proprietor of an otherwise innocuous branch of the New York City Public Library, inadvertently discover a leather bound manuscript, tucked into a dusty bookshelf, hidden amongst hundreds of dead and forgotten books in a storeroom. Perhaps you should have kept that particular manuscript, flaked in dry leather and smelling of nutmeg, in the graveyard of other such books untouched by man by the span of decades. But no, your curious nature betrays your sensibility, as the ornate and yellow trim of this arrid and dusty leather bound book seems to call out to you, almost screaming in your head. 

  
You hear a voice, but you look around and the discover the reading room dark and empty, closed to the public, with only you seated there and outside on the steps to this gateway to the summary of human knowledge, occupied by the sleeping undomiciled, huddled beneath piles of newspaper, unknowing to the ancient and cosmic knowledge just uncovered. You shrug the voice off, and open the book, with its wide and tentacled characters illuminated only by the warm light of the banker lamp on your desk, as it stands hunched over, on a single brass leg, shrouded in its emerald green hood, eager to aid your transcendental journey to a maelstrom located somewhere north of Brooklyn, and no, not the Bronx, think more upward… Perhaps above the known universe. Was it the lamp that spoke to you just now? Of course not, that'd be silly. But then... Who did? You examine the first page, where no words appear, only a single yellow symbol, with three arm like appendages flailing away from what seems to be a sort of flower, but none that you are familiar with. The next page reads the words "The King in Yellow ''. There is no author. You hear whispers, they speak of the death of the universe. You shrug it off, and begin to read. 

  
Half past ten, that was the time when you had sat down. You were sure of it, as you were thinking of making coffee for another long night of research, but this can't be, it's now a quarter to three. You hold the final page of the book in your hand, unaware of how you arrived at this conclusion. On the bottom of the final page, handwritten in dark ink, appear the words: 'You belong to the King in Yellow'. You had just read of this pale faced king, adorn in yellow robes, omnipresent and utterly powerful. But you do not understand him, the words make no sense. This reads like a play, but one you encounter in a dream and awake from only to try and make sense of it. You think of this Carcosa... Wait, Carcosa? Where is that? "Take the 'N' train to the Dekalb Avenue station, exit the train car, enter the tunnel on the Flatbush Avenue side and walk until you find the beacon, then you'll find this 'Carcosa'". Who said that? Must be a joke you made in your head. But it didn't sound like you... Or a joke. No matter, this is all silly. It's a simple book and you're just tired. This wouldn't be the first time you've read a book and got lost in it. But why does this feel so different, and who is in this library, whispering? It's closed, even the homeless keep away. They know better. You shake your head and close the book, stowing it in your satchel, and embark on a pilgrimage to oblivion. The 'N' Train going to Downtown Brooklyn.

Ah yes, that was where it began. Not too long ago, you imagine. Or perhaps it was far longer than you could possibly imagine. How much time has passed? You haven't seen a train pass at all since you've begun your work here. You look at the book and ask, "What time is it?" to which it replies "It is three and a half million years ago." That doesn't make sense, you just got off the train only a few minutes prior, you think. The whispers from the library have followed you, infecting your ears with its alien tongue. They sing into your ear, telling you everything, only you do not understand them. You wish you did. 

  
The beacon stands before you, tucked away into a concrete corner next to the train track, deep into the tunnel. The bones and sticks stretch outward, like open arms, adorn in sickly yellow fabric, the color of rotting autumn leaves. Human skulls, surprisingly the least concerning part of this structure, sit lined up on top, with large antlers outstretched atop the crown of the beacon. The manuscript sits neatly, bathed in years of brake dust and debris, on the floor in front of the altar of which you kneel before now. "Where do you find deer antlers in this city?" You ask. 'This is unimportant.', the book replies. "I've seen plenty of weird bones for sale at the Fulton market, maybe th-" The book cuts you off, 'Shut up'. You comply. 

  
You look at your hands, stained in charcoal-gray matter, pondering what your next move should be. What IS the next move? What exactly are we doing here? We? Wait, who is ‘we’? There’s only you… This is all just very silly, you think, you’re just a librarian. You like coffee, and plain oatmeal and books about fantasy dragons, you’re an ordinary person. But here you are, kneeling in a subway tunnel in front of this monstrosity. The altar stares back at you, silent and judging. It feels your sedition, but no matter, this will be corrected in due time.

  
The warmth of its gaze washes over you, this moment of heretical clarity disbanded, and only replaced by your dear king, who speaks to you from inside your mind. You are comforted by its tone, and by the visions he’s flooding into your skull. A dead city, in a land and place so far forgotten that even time has no place there. The alien spires reach into the skies, grasping towards the black sun that hangs above. This is where you’ll find him. “I belong to the King in Yellow.” The words flow out of your mouth like sick, tasting of ash and metal. The judgemental visage of the skulls and their antler crown become soft and inviting, loving and accepting, nourishing and safe. You will never have to worry again, you think. Your bones contort, and your skin peels. Your eyes turn to a viscous fluid, and your limbs become long and grotesque, sharpened to cut through bone and metal. Your screams are no longer human. You can no longer see the subway tunnel, but you can see Carcosa, and above it, your king watches over. He speaks to you. “Bring me more.” You comply. You exit the tunnel, released upon this corrupt and decaying city to fetch more blind waiting to see.
