It happened again. 

Another building went missing in the middle of the night.

One minute it's there, the next it's just gone.

Last night it was my buddy's daughter who went missing along with her entire apartment building. 

They'd come over that very day to shoot the shit over a couple of beers. She had asked about apartment 426, and since it happened so close to her, I told her everything I knew about it.

Understandably, I think what I told her really freaked her out. I tried to change the subject, but she and her Dad left not long after.

That very night, while I was getting ready for bed, my old police chief called me.

He knew I was close with her Dad so he figured he'd call me and let me know what happened. He asked if I wanted to be a part of the search and I agreed.

I was there when they interviewed the neighbours in the surrounding area. They all reported the same thing.

A dense fog rolled in and the ground shook violently. Like the most violent earthquake they'd ever felt. Followed by a deafening horn like that of a train and then nothing.

Everything went back to normal and the world fell silent again.

Except once more an entire building had gone missing in mere moments. Everyone inside is disappearing with it.

So we began to search. In much the same way as when building 426 went missing. This time it wasn't long before something was found.

Two hikers had called and reported seeing a building deep in the woods just off an established trail. 

So we went looking.

And we found it.

There it was. Its address is on full display. Apartment 451. 

Only, around a hundred kilometres away from where it had stood.

It had been a ten-story building, although only the first two floors were currently there. I was one of the first to go in, and the second I did, I could tell something was wrong. I mean nothing so far had given me any doubt as to what I was doing. It had all been so procedural.

But the second I stepped in there. 

The hair on my arms stood on end.

Something about the place was completely off. Something more than I was seeing. It was like every nerve in my body was telling me to get out. The first thing that hit me was the smell, like hot copper. The air was thick and heavy. Almost kinda muggy, hot and humid. Despite it being mid-winter and snow-covered every inch outside.

The floor plan was all wrong. I mean doorways leading to nothing but brick walls and hallways that just ended abruptly. Trees were growing through the walls and ceiling like they'd just phased through everything. I opened one of the doors and it led outside despite being a normal room door with a number. There was an elk there, standing still, completely frozen. It had this look of pure terror on his face but it wasn't looking at me.

It was looking past me. Like it could see something behind me.

Something I couldn't see.

Another officer called out to me, and in the brief moment when I looked away, the elk disappeared. I don’t just mean walked away, the tracks walked up to the doorframe and ended there.

 I didn't know what to make of it, I mean everything here was impossible.

So why was it that humid air and an elk were the only things I could think about? As if those things were what reaffirmed the inconsistencies I knew were there.

Everything went to shit after I went to the second floor. 

I wish I hadn't gone up. 

I really wish I hadn't.

When I went up it had no roof and the walls ended slightly above my head. I heard crows above me and I looked up into the trees that had gone through the building.

God.

They were all up there over a hundred of them. Up in the branches writhing and moaning in pain. 

Every tenant of apartment 451 was up there alive, suffering.

Some look as though their skin had been peeled from their flesh. Most of them were missing limbs and pieces of their bodies, all ending in straight edges. As though they'd been cut off in one straight motion.

I saw her up there too. 

What was left of her.

She'd been cut cleanly in half, just above the hips and her guts dangled down. Crows were pecking at them. 

I called her name.

She turned her eyes to meet mine as she mouthed for me to help her. 

I took a step back, and my foot sank into something soft. I looked down to see a man half sunken into the floorboards. His skin was translucent. It reminded me of the other we'd found encased in stone.

He screamed and they joined him. Screaming in deafening unison.

It got foggy out of nowhere.

It just appeared, and in seconds, I couldn't see five feet in front of me. That's when the building began to shake violently. It nearly threw me to the ground but I caught myself.

I knew what it all meant so I headed for the exit as fast as I could. I called out to the others to hurry and get out.

As I exited behind one of my coworkers my foot snagged on the door frame.

I fell hard, knocking the wind straight out of me. But the worst part was that blaring horn.
It felt like someone was holding a train horn right next to my ear.

I held my hands up to my ears, but just as soon as it started, it fell silent again.

When I rolled over onto my back the building had vanished once more. And my foot that had caught in the door frame?

Well, it was just gone. It didn't bleed, didn't hurt. My leg just ended in a straight edge right above my ankle.

I looked around and noticed that only the officer who'd exited before me remained. The other three hadn't made it out in time. 

I knew them well, they'd had families, they'd been good men and they didn't deserve to never see their children grow up. Never to grow old and look back at all they'd accomplished.

He took me to the hospital and they couldn't explain it anymore than we could. It wasn’t cauterized, it was just an open wound, yet it didn't bleed. 

I found her post. I'm writing this in her honour. She was right. People need to know.

Apartment 451 wasn't the first and I doubt it'll be the last.
