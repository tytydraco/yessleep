**The sink needs to be cleaned twice a day.**

 

I stared at the underlined text. Surely that can’t be right. A sink needs to be cleaned once per shift, just after I’ve finished the dishes. My eyes glance at the nanny cam placed in the corner of the kitchen. I reason that it’s easier to just get on with it, this isn’t my first unusual request from a client, and it’ll only take a few minutes to get it over with. I’ll clean it at the start of my shift, and do it again before I leave.

The Marigolds had already left when I arrived to clean the house, and I’ve already made a mental list of each task to completed before the days end.

So, it’s just me and the sink for now. It’s cold to the touch, with a slight grit to its texture. It is a beautiful sink, a slight warm tone to it and a marble effect throughout. It seems sturdy, and expensive.

On the side of the basin, next to the taps, is a whole lemon, a tub of fine salt, and a sharp kitchen knife. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that the Marigolds want their sink cleaned with these items. And so, I slice the lemon into halves and dip the exposed face into the salt tub. I use the lemon as you would a sponge, making gentle circular motions, stopping occasionally to re-dip when the salt dissolves. The process takes around five minutes, and I give it a courtesy rinse with water when I’m done.

I step back and look down at the sink, satisfied with its state, and move on to the next task.

 

I’ve just finished the final load of laundry when it reaches five. My body aches from the days work, and I’m eager to get home and relax. I have one arm in the sleeve of my jacket when I realise I haven’t cleaned the sink again. I suppress my groan, and head back to the kitchen.

The other half of the lemon is still perched next to the sink, so I grab it, dip its face into the salt and start scrubbing the sink. My arms are burning, tense from hours of manual labour. I can feel the nape of my neck getting moist, but I keep scrubbing. Five minutes pass, I rinse, I leave.

 

**The sink needs to be cleaned twice a day.**

 

The Marigolds are gone again, and I’m scrubbing the sink. The lemon is softer today, making it hard to keep a good grip on the fruit. When I arrived this morning, the sink had acquired some extra stains near the plug. It’s a large brown sticky stain, which I can only assume is barbeque sauce. It feels like the stain is taunting me, refusing to lift, determined to stay and ruin the pristine sink. But I’m resilient, and I keep scrubbing. Eventually it yields to me, and I can finally rinse and walk away. My eyes dart at the clock, 20 minutes have passed. That’s a sizeable chunk of my shift being occupied to this wretched sink. I’ll just have to put the laundry on a quick wash.

It’s with dread that I remember the sink just as it hits five. My shoulder has started to pulse as I begin the relentless scrubbing. I’m trying to ignore it when a sudden sharp pang shoots through my blade and into my neck, causing my hand to twitch and scrape along the side of the basin. I hiss and pull my hand up to examine the damage. My skin has caught against the grit of the skin and torn open in three small wounds. Anger, mixed with pain, begins to simmer in my bones as I notice my blood has tarnished the pristine side of the sink. I have to start cleaning again.

 

**The sink needs to be cleaned twice a day.**

 

My fingers grip the sides of the steering wheel, the nails almost piercing through the leather as I sit outside the Marigolds home. I know what awaits me beyond the doors, and I can’t stand it. I was thinking about that stupid sink all night, and how long it took me to rectify the new stains I had left on it. I got home late, grouchy and in pain. And it just starts all over again.

The sink jeers at me as I walk into the house, practically screaming at me to clean it again. It seems grittier today, more miniscule stones break off and leave tiny holes that I must reclean. I researched types of sinks last night and can now identify this horrid thing as limestone. I can just imagine the smug look on the Marigolds faces when they threw money into this useless aesthetic.

“It’s one of a kind”

“It has a natural elegance”

You must be a certain type of freak to want a sink made of stone, when did porcelain go out of fashion? My fingers are stinging from the lemon juice and salt seeping into the papercuts left by the grit. My eyes water, but I refuse to let this sink see me cry. I feel like I’m losing my mind, but with every passing day the sink seems to get wider and wider, as if I’m eroding it piece by piece each time I clean it.

I lose half the day scrubbing back and forth until it finally becomes clean.

 

**The sink needs to be cleaned twice a day.**

 

I can’t stop thinking about this fucking sink. This relentless Sisyphean fucking sink. I’ve been here for hours, cleaning up a never-ending flow of crimson from my hands. I can close my eyes and see circles.

 

**The sink needs to be cleaned twice a day.**

**The sink needs to be cleaned twice a day.**

 

Do the Marigolds even exist? Do they even care about the cleaner who spends half their life scrubbing at this unforgiving monster?

I can’t remember how long I’ve been here.

 

**The sink needs to be cleaned twice a day.**

 

At what point does it stop being a sink? My fingers can almost touch the wooden support holding this fucking thing up. I’m numb to the stings of the lemon at this stage, and I’m scared to stop scrubbing.

My wounds are openly weeping against the stone, mixing with the lemon and creating a rouge paste that I smear in circular motions. The acid from the lemon has stopped stinging my wounds, I don’t feel anything anymore.

The sink needs to be clean.
