I never had a voice. People said I was broken, but Mama always told me, *“Some hearts speak louder in silence.”* I think that’s why she understood me. She never needed words to know when I was scared, or when I missed her just by looking at my shoes too long.

But then she left. Just like the others. Only quieter.

After that, it was just me and the wind. And Uncle Garrick.

He wasn’t really my uncle. Just someone who came when Mama got too tired. He moved into the house without asking, with eyes that looked like they’d seen too many endings. He never smiled. Not even when I tried. But he never yelled either. That counted for something.

I watched storms a lot after Mama left. I liked how the rain made everything blurry like the world was too sad to stay sharp. The wind would hum through the cracks in the walls like it was singing to me. Sometimes I pretended it *was* Mama. Other times I hoped it wasn’t.

One afternoon, I found a crow with one wing twisted, lying by the pond near our backyard. He didn’t make a sound, just looked at me like he was waiting. I brought him crumbs and named him Noir. He followed me after that, like I was his secret. We didn’t talk. But I liked him anyway.

That night, the sky turned a strange kind of dark not black, but a bruised purple. The kind of dark that *feels*. Uncle Garrick stood at the doorway, staring into the storm like it owed him something. I sat by the window, holding my tin pail the one Mama gave me before she got sick. It still smelled like cinnamon.

When the wind came, it howled like something alive. The house groaned, louder than usual. Wood snapped. The walls trembled. I curled under the table and squeezed my eyes shut. I wanted to scream, but of course I couldn’t.

Then, everything stopped.

No sound.

No rain.

Just quiet.

I opened my eyes and I was outside, lying near the pond.

At first, I thought *I made it*. My chest felt light. The air was sweet after the storm. The trees stood still. The sky was soft blue, no clouds.

I laughed. Not out loud I never could but inside, I laughed like my chest might float away.

Then I turned.

And saw the house.

It was gone. Or what was left of it wasn’t really a house anymore. Just broken pieces, like matchsticks snapped by angry hands. I ran or tried to. But the wind didn’t push against me anymore. The grass didn’t crunch under my feet.

And no one saw me.

People were there digging, shouting, crying. Someone pointed at the rubble.

I followed their fingers.

They found Uncle Garrick. He looked the same. Calm. Cold. Still.

Then someone whispered, “The boy must’ve been under the back wall.”

My heart dropped. I backed away, shaking my head. *No. No, I’m right here.*

I looked around for my tin pail  it was there, half-buried beneath a beam, crushed. I reached for it, but my hand passed through it like smoke.

I couldn’t feel the ground.

I couldn’t feel *anything*.

Then I heard footsteps behind me.

Uncle Garrick.

But he was... different.

He wasn’t dusty or bruised like before. His eyes weren’t just tired they were *endless*. The kind of eyes that held too much silence.

“I told you,” he said, his voice quiet like a funeral breeze. “The house wouldn’t hold.”

I shook my head, backing away, but he only stepped closer. Noir landed on his shoulder, silent as ever.

“You’ve been carrying her goodbye for too long,” Garrick whispered. “It’s time.”

That’s when I saw the truth. In his shadow. In the way the light bent around him.

He wasn’t my uncle.

He was Death.

And he had come for me.

I didn’t cry. I don’t know if I even could anymore.

Behind him, through the trees, I saw light. Faint. Warm.

And her.

Mama.

She wasn’t sick anymore. Her hair shone like the sun. She had that look — the one that always said, *“You’re safe now.”*

But I didn’t move yet.

I turned to the house, one last time.

To the place where I hid under the table.

To the spot where my voice should have screamed but never did.

To the boy still buried there the one no one would hear again.

Then I reached out and took Garrick’s hand. It felt like closing a book I didn’t want to finish.

The wind picked up again. But it didn’t howl this time.

It hummed.

Soft and low, like a lullaby.

And I walked into the light, holding Death’s hand like a father’s quiet, warm, and full of goodbye.
