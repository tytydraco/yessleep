After our mother passed away a few months ago and the house was passed to us, Dean and I decided to sell it. I didn't remember at all that we had buried this time capsule in the garden back then. But Dean apparently did. And when he told me about it, the memory seemed to slowly come back. That's the thing about childhood memories. Some are so deeply etched that over the years they become the only stories you tell over and over again. Others - most of them - are simply forgotten. Or you repress them. Unless you are reminded of them. It's amazing what you still remember somewhere in the depths of your brain. 

When we finally found it and pulled the blue lacquered aluminium box out of the ground, I suddenly remembered it very clearly. I remembered how we came up with the idea and that we had asked our mother for permission. She thought it was strange but was pleased that for once we were getting on well together. I remembered how she smiled and looked for the old blue box in the shed in which our father had put nails. I remembered the rattling of the nails inside the box and them forming a pile on the wooden surface of the workbench as our mother poured them out. It was so clear and distinct in front of me that I found it almost frightening. This day had been beautiful, but certainly no more special than any other of the beautiful days we had in our childhood.

Still, after it had all come back to me so clearly, I wondered about one thing: that the memory didn't go any further. It just seemed to... end there. We played, we had the idea, we asked our mother, she got us the box and then Dean and I set off. But where to? I had to have at least a rough memory of the rest after all that was back.

I pulled the box out of the ground and Dean looked at me with shining eyes. The day was not as nice as the one when we had buried it. It was raining and we were completely soaked. At that moment it occurred to me that it had been totally nonsensical to look for the time capsule right now. Dean spoke to me about the capsule and I remembered it. But why did we start looking for it **instantly**? It was raining cats and dogs. All this flashed through my mind in a few seconds and already I was beginning to doubt my sanity. Why the hell was there a gap between the moment Dean told me about the capsule and the moment we found it?!

"Dean.", I said, looking at him with a worried expression on my face.

"What?"

He smiled and placed our capsule on a patch of grass left between the countless holes we had dug in the garden.

"Why don't I remember the capsule?"

He looked at me in wonder.

"What do you mean you don't remember?"

I looked down at the blue capsule I now remembered very well and back up into his face.

"Well yes now I do. But... what did we put in it?"

At this question, Dean apparently began to think. His smile slowly disappeared from his face.

"Um. I don't know, " He shook his head. "But isn't that the idea behind it?"

He laughed. Somehow more nervous than his expression seemed to pretend.

I, meanwhile, stared at the blue box while listening to the hollow patter of raindrops on it.

"Why were we looking for it now?"

Dean was silent, staring at the box now too.

For a while neither of us said anything. I hadn't brought it up to him that something was wrong with my memory in the last few minutes or hours. But now he seemed to feel the same way. I felt uneasy and I didn't know why. And Dean seemed to feel the same way. I looked around at our old garden, which was now more brown than green, since up until that moment we had apparently dug it up like mad to find that capsule. I didn't remember it.

"Dean, how long have we been looking for the capsule?"

I tried not to look too worried, maybe this was all just something like a dejavu effect only in reverse, but I couldn't seem to manage it. Dean also looked around and I saw fear spreading across his face. He was doubting his sanity now too, or so I thought. He looked at me with glazed eyes. I wasn't sure if there were tears in his eyes or if it was the rain. For a moment it looked like time was standing still.

"I don't think we should open that thing," he said in a broken voice.

Either he remembered what was inside or he was just too scared of it now. I laughed nervously.

"Come on."

I looked back down at the wet blue box between us.

"I mean..."

What was wrong here? There now seemed to be an ominous aura emanating from the nondescript blue box that had once been home to nails on the shelf in the shed just a few feet from us.

"I don't know," Dean said.

I looked at him uncertainly.

"We should at least take a look inside."

There were clearly tears in Dean's eyes now.

"You know what's in it, don't you?", I asked.

"No. Please just dig it back in. I don't feel comfortable with it."

Dean's voice broke. I looked at him and something inside me screamed at me to listen.

"At least tell me why I shouldn't open it… It was your idea after all."

Dean thought for a moment, then stood up and looked down at me as I held the capsule in my hand.

"All right open it. But without me." he said. He seemed to have his emotions back under control now. I was confused, what the hell was going on? My brother started walking towards the house.

"Dean! What the hell are you doing? Where are you going?"

He didn't answer and kept walking. I was completely stumped by now. And I wanted to know what was in that capsule. As I looked down at the box in my hands I heard the patio door slam behind me. Dean was gone. But I couldn't just leave that stupid box unopened now. What could be so bad in it? After all, we had just dug up the whole **garden** for it and now I was supposed to bury it again? I took a deep breath. Whatever was in it seemed to really worry Dean, which made this inconspicuous little box scare the hell out of me. Slowly I opened the lid.

The first thing I pulled out was an old spinning top. I remembered it immediately. But until that moment I had completely forgotten about it. Dean and I had played with it all the time. On the wooden floor in our house, we would circle it along the grooves between the floorboards, taking turns trying to make it come farther. It drove our mother crazy. Our mother was crying. I didn't know why. The top kept spinning on the floor and I remembered Dean and I trying to comfort her.

I pulled a wristwatch out of the capsule. It was our father's. He had given it to me when I had been badly injured one summer and had to spend a few weeks in hospital. But why? Why couldn't I remember it?

"Take good care of it.« he said, pressing it into my hand. "Then it’ll take care of you too."

I didn't know what that meant then any more than I do now. And it was only now that I remembered. Dean was sitting in a chair opposite the bed, playing yo-yo. Those things were cool back then. I don't remember how long I was in the hospital. I guess at some point I was well again. I wish I could have asked Dean at that moment why I had been in the hospital. He was probably still in the house. I’d ask him later.

Then I pulled out a yo-yo. Dean's yo-yo. He must have put it in. I didn't seem to have any special memories of that. I turned the tin over and shook it. A folded piece of paper fell out. I picked it up and unfolded it. My handwriting was visible in smudged ink.

"Dear Dean," was written at the top of the note, which must have just turned out to be a letter addressed to my brother. But why would I write a letter to Dean and put it in our shared time capsule? This felt wrong. Something wasn't right here. I wanted to go in and get Dean. I wanted to talk to him about it. About this capsule. About Mom. About him.

Instead, I started reading.

&#x200B;

As I began to read the letter, reality came crashing down on me.

I remembered the day I buried the capsule. I remembered the confused look on my mother's face when I asked her permission to bury the capsule. I remembered her soft smile and the wrinkles around her reddened eyes as she took the box from the shelf and emptied it. I remembered putting the top in the box because I didn't want to play with it alone. And how I put in a yo-yo for Dean and my watch for Dad. I remembered writing these lines for my brother.

I looked up from the letter and turned to the house.

"Dean?", I cried with tears in my eyes and dropped the letter.

*Dear Dean,*

*I hope you are well where you are now. You forgot your yo-yo. Mom says you and Dad aren't coming back, but I don't believe it. Why would you leave without us? I'll definitely look forward to seeing you again. The top's no fun without you, so I'll put it in the box, too. It was Grandma's idea, I thought it was weird, Mom did too, but we can dig it out when you get back.*

*Tell dad I love him, bye!*

I sobbed.

&#x200B;

"What are you doing here?", I heard Dean's voice behind me.

I wheeled around and saw Dean standing on the patio. What was going on here? Were my memories wrong? Or was *Dean* wrong?

"W... What?", I stammered.

"We were supposed to meet at the diner at noon today."

I remembered that. Now I was completely confused. But there Dean was, standing in front of me.

"I..." it burst out of me. I didn't know what to say.

Dean sighed.

"Anyway, come in, we need to get rid of this house," it said, closing the door behind it.

&#x200B;

I’ve now spent the evening with "Dean" and he is now sleeping in the room next door. I don't know what it is, but I think the Dean who reminded me of the capsule and dug it out with me was really my brother. Dean, who died almost 20 years ago, and the thing next door thinks I don't remember him dying. How can that be?! Why am I only now remembering my own brother's death? And what is it pretending to be? What does it want?

I'm writing this because I hope someone here believes me. I'm beginning to doubt my sanity. Maybe it's really me going insane and I should talk to Dean about it. Please help me. I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

&#x200B;

Rory.
