The town I lived in had become flooded with homeless people—most of them seemingly delusional or on drugs. It appeared to be gradually getting worse. Every day, there were new faces I hadn’t seen before.
 They walked the streets in their own worlds, talking to themselves, clawing at their skin, and dancing in the road half-naked. They pushed carts or rolled suitcases around all day, heading toward places that may or may not have existed.

I lived in a strange area caught between two polar-opposite neighborhoods. On my right stood large cobblestone homes with three-car driveways, beautifully decorated porches, overpriced wicker furniture sets, and prominent Ring security doorbells. To my left was a sprawling low-income apartment complex, just a few miles past a sea of expanding tents.
It was the part of town you speed past when forced to drive by. The part you never walked around—unless something was seriously wrong—and even then, you power-walked or sprinted.

I tried my best to ignore them—the homeless. Don’t get me wrong, I understand they’re human beings with stories, just like me. But they made me uncomfortable. 
I’d cross the street when I saw them coming, as if they were zombies trying to eat my heart or lungs. Fear bloomed in my chest when they approached. Everyone I know feels the same. They’re a wine stain on crisp white linen sheets.

During lunch, I went on daily walks, always heading toward the cobblestone homes. Never left. That was a strict law I created for myself. I worked from home at the time, and those walks were my daily dose of exercise. 

One afternoon, I discovered a new walking path near my house. It seemed to have appeared overnight. Despite my skepticism, I was excited. It looked secluded and peaceful. Most paths in town had been overtaken by the homeless, so when I saw this one was clear, I eagerly stepped onto the gravel.

My lunch break was at 1 p.m. for one hour, and I never brought my phone. It was my time to unplug. My sacred hour where I didn’t have to talk to a single person.

 The path was quiet, the only sound the crunch of gravel beneath my feet. I was lost in thought—about an upcoming deadline, a coworker pissing me off—when I noticed the path abruptly ended. A tall brick wall covered in neon-colored ivy loomed ahead, strangely ominous. I spun on my heel and headed back.

I walked for what felt like miles. The sky had darkened, far more than it should have by then. A sense of unease crept in. Why was it so dark? Why wasn’t I home yet?

My legs ached. That’s when I heard high-pitched, gut-wrenching screams in the distance. Something about them felt wrong. Tall flowers—ones I swore hadn’t been there before—bloomed as I watched, glowing faintly in the dark. And I could have sworn… the screams were coming from them.

Finally, I saw what looked like my street and broke into a full sprint. 

I just wanted to get inside and never go down that fucking path again. As I turned the corner, I saw my house. Only, as I approached the door, movement inside caught my eye. 

My heart stopped. Shadows. People.

I crouched to peek through the window.
A family was inside, sitting at my table, eating dinner, laughing. My table. My food, surely. My home. Who were these people? Had homeless squatters broken in and made themselves at home? But they were too well-dressed. Too… normal.

Only, they weren’t normal. They were intruders. Well-dressed criminals having a fucking family meal in a house that wasn’t theirs.

I knocked. Then I slammed. Panic turned to rage. 

These fuckers were in my home. Eating my food. My heart pounded as the door vibrated under my fists. Just as I was about to kick it in, the door opened.

“Who are you?!”  We both shrieked simultaneously.


“This is my home. Why are you in my home?!” I yelled.

She winced, eyes wide with fear. I tried to push past her, but a tall man—her husband, maybe—stepped between us. He shoved me out and slammed the door.

“We’re calling the police if you don’t leave now!” he shouted from behind it.

I laughed—loudly, bitterly.

“GOOD!” I screamed.

Tears burned in my eyes. Terror and rage boiled beneath my skin. Who did they think they were? 

We stood there, staring through the window. They looked at me like I was a madman. Horrified. Astonished. Scared.

Only it wasn’t their home—it was mine.
The woman glared at me, her black eyes full of hatred. The man reminded me of Jack from The Nightmare Before Christmas, only human—limbs too long and thin. 

I doubted there was any flesh beneath his clothes at all.  High pitched screams emerged, closer now. From behind me. Louder than before on the path.

I spun around to see nothing, appearing even more deranged to my intruders. 

If this was a joke, they were phenomenal actors. Did they hire someone to scream behind me? Were there speakers hidden in my bushes? 

I searched them like a rabid animal, but found nothing aside from branches. 

“What seems to be the problem here?” the officer asked when he arrived.

I told him a family had broken into my home and was eating my food. He looked me up and down—suspicious. I was filthy, covered in dirt, soaked in sweat, and reeking.

“Don’t move. Let me talk to them.”

They eagerly opened the door for him.

“This man says this is his home. Is that true?”

They said I was interrupting their family dinner. The officer scratched his chin, glanced between us, then chuckled under his breath. I decided I hated him and his chin more than I hated the skeleton couple. 

“They’re fucking liars!” I spat out, stomping my feet on the ground like a toddler.

He sighed.

“May I come inside? Do you have any photos of your family to prove this is your home?”

“Yes,” the woman said. “But he can’t come in.”
She crossed her arms, eyes narrowed like she was willing my head to explode.

I laughed and threw my hands in the air as they all stepped into my house and closed my door behind them.

There was a wreath on it. Black and gold fake leaves. I didn’t recognize it. Did they bring it? Hang it up to taunt me? To make me question my sanity?

The cop returned, and closed my door behind him.

“You need to leave,” he commanded, peering down on me from my porch, “This is their home. The joke is over.”

Those words broke me. In that moment I felt my mind and body splitting apart. The only thing I can remember is white flecks floating in the air as I lost my footing. 

The officer caught me, guiding me to the back of his car. Too disoriented to fight, I got in.

He took me to a holding cell “to sleep off whatever drug-induced psychosis” I was experiencing.

But I hadn’t taken anything. I didn’t sleep. The screams came back. I cried until my throat was raw. Alone in the cell, shadows moved. Voices whispered.

That was three days ago.

I left jail in the dead of night with nowhere to go. The screams had turned into voices, whispering sick things. I felt bugs under my skin. Inside my skin. I clawed at myself, screamed. 

That’s when Jim found me.

He wasn’t scared. He placed a hand on my shoulder. I fell silent long enough for him to ask one question:

“You walked down the path, didn’t you?”

He said I wasn’t alone. This had happened to others. He said he’d take me somewhere safe. His voice was soft, like a new-age guru. I followed him into the dark.

He told me he could always tell who had walked the path—by the screaming and the skin clawing. Victims of the path didn’t look like the “authentic” homeless. They were something else. He could see it in their eyes.

A unique mixture of hopelessness and disorientation with a dash of rage.

Jim led me to a massive encampment in an abandoned lot about half a mile from my house—my old house. I think I live here now. 

Everyone’s kind. I fit in. We remind each other that the voices aren’t real. 

The bugs aren’t real.  

Don’t scratch. 

Don’t listen.

There are 30 of us here. Jim thinks there are more.

I had hope—until I learned some had been here for months. Searching for the path every day. Blisters on their feet. No way back.

There’s a woman named Angie who’s been here nearly a year. She stays quiet, always reading in a corner, scratching at her skin off and on.

I’m going to look for the path tomorrow.

I have to.
