Hello welcome to the institution of the unexplainable, also known as IOU we studie the unusual and strange encounters one might have and try to contasept them. I'm the head of the logs, this means I have to go through and read archives and cases that get dismissed due to the lack of evidence or questionable sources.

On today's log we will talk about a strange encounter with a house that seems to end in a misunderstanding and a mysterious place of events. 

Name: Chole Sharp 
Age: 25
date of incident: april 29 2015 
Log. 105 : holes in the windows 
Start of Recording:

It all started the day I moved into Willy, it was my great grandma's old house that she left me once she passed, It always seemed strange. When I would go there as a little one it felt almost as if there was always another thing in the house like it was alive in self. It was a small creepy house with 2 floors.

 The downstairs with a kitchen, bathroom, a guest and living room but there was also this dank small crawl space where she would put all of her nicknacks and old knitted blankets. It was moist and musty, the white paint now cream and peeling, revealing the brown rotten wood that always looked slightly wet.

 The worst part was how to get out. See you had to crawl through a dark muggy tunnel that smells like molding out grime. But this house it also had its up, like the upstairs where my great grandma's room was along with the other bathroom there was an array of beautiful colored glass painted windows, they were alluring almost like they called to you and the way they were so detailed and perfect with every stroke and the changes of magnificent colors it was so heavenly like the gods themselves had put all their affection and travels into them. I think that's what made me stay and for the fact it was a free place to stay. 

  I also decided to stay in my great grandma's room. It had the same glass windows but this time there was a small chip in the corner of the window. It was on the lower left side but there were no cracks around it, just a hole. Once I saw it was implemented into my mind almost like a bug that will never leave you alone, that buzzes around and around your head till the noise gets too loud and with a smash there goes the loud sly bug that once thought it was so great is now dead. 
In that moment I saw a very dark shadow surry through my peripheral vision. It was quick and disappeared in the blink of an eye with the turn of my head. When a small herd of flies began to form at the edge of the hole then all the noise began to grow again. So furthermore I was gonna smash it but I couldn't because it would break all the elegance around where hole was not, so to fix my problem I put some duct tape on the hole along with a fake flower plant placed right where the devilish hole was. Then I ignored it or at least I tried to. At first just not paying much mind to it and that was going just fine. But then I started to see things, at least I think like the duct tape had a cut in it like long  claw marks and no matter how much I tried to re-tape it the gapping tear would just reappear but bigger and bigger and I swear there were eyes watching me through the tears. 

I just thought it's all in my head and I just tried to settle into my new life starting with looking for a new part time job. So I could at least be busy with something. I also wanted a reason to get out of this god forsaken house and its overbearing feelings. I was also starting to feel lonely and frustrated, my mom and dad died in a car crash so my grandmother raised me from when I was 5 and I mean I already felt like a failure and have low self confidence. I really wanted to prove that I can live on my own. But that's just me rambling, I'll get back to my story. I think it's hard to really tell when I began to change or even realize it was so fast but slow, almost like if I had made days last months and months last years I would see and hear things, lights would flicker and bumps in the night.

 There was even a time where I swore I saw a large creature standing in my doorway. I wanted to cry so bad but once I met eyes with it, it slowly brought up it's dark hand up to it mouth and shhhhed me while closing my door. The morning after I was just sitting there drinking my coffee trying to wrap my head around what was going on when I heard the buzzing noise. At first it sounded like maybe one or two I wonder where it could have came from but the more I looked the more I began to feel ill and then it being to feel like a mass that of a millions and the Begrudging sound of the buzzing begin filing my head, swarming as to almost make me dizzy. That's when it went silent then as if I didn’t control my body, I started to almost float up the creaky stairs and straight to the room with the hole in the window. 

It was still the same colorful glass and was now lit up by the rising sun and you could feel the warmth. That's when the buzz sound came back making my head shoot immediately to the plant that had been put up to hide that forsaken hole and to which I walked up to that disgusting aggravating model of pottery and picked it up to see there was nothing there but the buzzing still continued and it just got louder like a sonic boom that is being created inside your brain. Like nothing could stop it and that’s when I shattered the disgusting creation of the dry painted clay. And slowly, very slowly, almost as if I had learned a new subject and was looking over all the new curiosity that I have gained about the subject, like an owl watching the mice scurry along the cold ground at night. I watched the maggots crawl out the nasty pot they wormed around screaming out along with an eyeball.It rolled on my wood floors straight to me. I put my foot under it and made a small squash sound as I stepped on it, slightly squeezing out some blood along with the veins to which fall on the floor with a layer look.

 I took a deep breath and I kneel down to picked up some of the maggots then I began to feast on them, I scarf them down like last night's dinner, I ate them like I was dying, like I had never eaten anything in my life, I ate and I ate and I ate until nothing was there it feels like gushers in my mouth with all the gougy inside it was warm. And that’s when It had finally stopped all the buzzing. It had finally gone, this was really the end of it. And for the first time in all the short time I have been here I felt at peace. At that moment I just felt a flood of emotions. I began to cry and with that sadness came anger with anger came sickness and with sickness came falling asleep on my toilet all my vomiting attempts unachieved.

 But that's not even the worst part. I found out when I woke up that morning everything was in its place, the pot still in its spot, the mess all cleaned up, the only difference was the hole it was gone and in its place was dark black glass. It's different from the beautiful aray the actual glass around it. I tried to touch it but once my hand even just lightly grazed it, it all began to crack and shatter then there was the buzzing again followed by a ear-piercing shriek and that's when my nose began to bleed and I swear the house began to shake. I quickly ran down stairs to find out the blaring noise along with what was causing all the convuling house and I tried to get to the front door but when I tried to turn the knobe I was met with resistance. It was locked. 

To what next led me to the crawl space and its deep black tounel that I so idiotically crawled through. But this time it felt more cramped and the walls seemed more as if they were breathing. There were little droplets falling on my hands as I moved. They were cold and slimy. But when I got to the opening I began to see small white lights in my dissent, the same light I saw in my doorway. But I just couldn’t see and I turned on the light. It was one of those pull lights and I just didn't know but after that click that's when I finally saw willy. A skinny slimy tall boney black creature. He had a hunched back for he didn't find in the crawl space and his eyes were a solid black mass with bright white pupils. They looked like an overjoyed clown and he had a huge white teething grin almost as if he wanted me to see him and was elated to finally be revealed. That's when I looked down to see my grandmother, her dead body ripped open organs coming out, the blood now pooling. Willy sees this and smiles wider, I mean I didn't even think it could get wider. But he points to her and cackles then sticks his long shaped knifed fingers into her stomach and grabs out her heart. I cover my mouth and begin to sob thinking of a way to get out of here.

 The lights flicker and he begins to crawl closer and closer to me. I could hear the cracking of bones as he tried to follow me though the growing smaller space. I decided my best chance was to run back into the tunnel to crawl space and try to get out somehow. Sprinting Willy laughs and tries to grab my ankle to which I scream and begin to crawl faster the liquid that was once falling on my hand in droplets now pouring on me and making the floor wet and hard to crawl through Willy start to check up. But I'm so close I can make it I know it and that's when I pull myself out I see the light but I realized that Willy is no longer chasing me and now looking around the house is spinning, I feel as if I am drunk. I try to walk to the door but fall to my knees and grab my stomach and cry. Then I look down at my hands at the liquid that covered all over me.

 It's blood and I begin to bring it up to my mouth and slurp it up from my hands now realizing that I didn't make it out, my eyes flashing to my grandma's body and me over it digging my hands into her pulling out whatever I can to eat. I felt like I just had to keep eating and eating that If I the monster inside of me would eat me from inside out. When I feel and hand on my shoulder it grips tightly and I look up and my eyes meet once more with Willy. He smiles and I go back to eating. The last thing I remember was walking upstairs and all the glassed painted windows were covered in holes, the moon light shining in. 

In the case of the house a neighbor had called in to say there was a foul smell coming from along with screaming in the house and once police came for a wellness check they had found a 25 year old Chole eating her passed away grandmother and shrieking about the holes in the windows. She was taken to a hospital for the mentilly ill. Later that year the house was condemned. There have been no more cases from this property since then but speclution  says it has a bad aura.

End of recording:
3 years after the incident chole came in and re-listened to her statement.

State your name “Chole Sharp im 28” the young girl nervously says across from me. 
“Now that you've listened, what do you think?” I ask
“I mean i don't even know I don't believe in this stuff.” She begins to mudder. 
“Well didn't you just get out of the ward.” I ask 
I did but I was just so confused, I mean that can’t be me.” She raises her voice 
Then what is this recording that you gave on your first day in the ward?” I question 
“I don’t know where I am I wanna leave!” She yells standing up 
“That’s fine go ahead you are the one who came here in the first place?” I tell her turning my head 
“ Then I will.” She stands up and walks out 

This is all we have left on this log and it all just seems like a misunderstanding and a mysterious place of events.
