Hello. This has been an extraordinary ordeal. With a lack of concrete evidence, it's hard for me to turn to anyone else so it will have to be you Reddit. Apologies in advance I am a dyslexic fuck. 

The other day me and my pal Ryan went for a walk up High Down. We live close to the South Downs, so hiking has been a regularity in my life. It's a quaint hill with a decent view of the south coast. We chatted and shot the shit as friends do. 

Now I'm unsure if the next part is connected but for the sake of context I'm going to outline everything that may hold significance. I haven't been up High Down since I was maybe 18 (I'm 25 now), I moved away from my home town in the pursuit of bigger things but ended up back here, as you do. Anyway, as we were up there we both noticed something we had not noticed before. It was a stone grave, one of those ones that is erected like a stone coffin about 5 feet in height. It had metal fencing around it, tight to the perimeter of the grave. This fencing was old too, similar to the spikes you find around old fancy houses. Next to it stood a plaque, the story it told in short is of a man who lived secluded up on this hill in a small shed, he built his grave 30-40 years before his death and lived right next to it. He planned his funeral and everything years before his death as well (which in those times was strange). A very eccentric guy  (plaque’s words not mine). At the time I remember thinking “This is how unimpressive our town is, this guy taking out a funeral plan in the 1800s is our biggest feat”.

We walk on, laughing about the unimportance of this man's life and the gravity our town had decided to give him. We sat at the top of the hill looking over the towns and cities. We looked over at our town. Probably a couple of miles out from where we were. 

Now you have to understand when I say this, we both know this town in and out, we have walked around aimlessly drunk/high for hours at a time, we know every nook and cranny of this little English nightmare. 

So we sat there playing who is more geographically impaired, pointing out places and trying to work out what they are, challenging each other on location. Then we notice this one building, off to the side of our town. It's big, grey and has no windows. It's smoking, but it was hard to know where from at that distance. Ryan speculated it was the leisure centre but that place has windows. Some unknown warehouse potentially I thought. Honestly, I hadn't been back all that long so it wasn't that strange for me, but Ryan was perplexed. We looked it up on Google Maps but as we were eyeballing the distance we couldn't pinpoint its location.

We were pretty high at this point so Ryan got fixated on working out what this place was. He thought it would be fun to try and locate it. I hadn't seen Ryan in a while so I was happy to extend the walk. 

We made a mental note of its position in relation to known landmarks and headed on our way.

After hours of walking, readjusting, walking again. We found nothing. No building, no smoke. As you come down High Down you lose sight of your surroundings due to the tree line. So we were unable to keep an eye on it the whole time. 

After that day, this all melted into the background of my brain. The stoneover ensued and memories of that day blurred. 

About a week later Ryan messaged me, he wanted to go up High Down again. I accepted and we met there. As we walk up the hill he is trying to peer through the tree line. I don't think much of it at the time. We make it to the top and he immediately turns to look at our town and points. 

“There, tell me I'm not crazy you see that right?”

I turn to look and see the building again, smoking as it was before, maybe how it had always been.

“I’v been up here every day since we last met, it's always there, it's always smoking”

he seemed a little frantic at this point.

“I’v searched every day. I come up here, I look at the building, I go down, I search, but nothing, can't find shit.”

I'm a little worried about him so I ask him if he's alright, he seems agitated by the question and in his own words politely informs me that this hangout session is over. 

Again life got in the way and I slowly forgot about this strange turn of events. About a week later I message Ryan to meet up again. No response. I assume he's pissed off about me being condescending so I rock up to his house uninvited. I knock and his mum answers the door. The first thing she asks me before I can even get a word out is

“Have you seen Ryan?”

The question is simple enough, but it lingers in my mind. 

“No that's actually why I came over”

She seemed distressed.

“He didn't come home a few days ago and I haven't seen him since, I don’t  know if I should call the police, he's 24 he's a grown man, and he's entitled to his space but…”

 “You should definitely call the police” I replied. 

It's been 5 days since I spoke to Ryan's mum. Still no sign of him. The police have been looking for him but no leads. I go up to High Down every day and there it is. Big, grey and smoking. Do you wanna know what scares me the most? I have tried to show others the building, but they can't see it.
