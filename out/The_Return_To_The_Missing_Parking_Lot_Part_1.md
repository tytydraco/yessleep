[The Missing Parking Lot](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kk58co/the_missing_parking_lot_part_1/) (Original)



We now know the road to the Parking Lot is impossible to find during the day and will only show itself on a particularly dark night and three quick flashes of any light source. Turning the light source off after a successful apparition will close access, acting like some kind of supernatural lock. One must then repeat the sequence to have the road reappear. 

Our urgency to find and enter that place had dissipated now that we knew what had to be done.  

“What happens if we stay there, what happens if we get stranded there somehow, is that what's happened to the missing persons, to those teens”? I asked out loud, taking my hand off the lighting control lever.

My question was followed by more silence. I needed to think it through. 

We all needed to.

Suddenly one of us finally spoke.

“We need to do this. We told ourselves we wouldn't go back home empty handed. As long as we never turn off the headlights on our vehicle when we’re in there like we unknowingly did last time, we should be fine”. Andy said, breaking the silence.

“Our main goal now is to find that truck and get some good pictures of it. That shouldn't take more than a few minutes”. Dario said, beginning to rationalize a plan.

I thought to myself for a second.

“How long were we in that parking lot last time? I then asked.

“The first time we entered it was at around 8:45 pm, by the time we came back and finally managed to take the correct road that night and head home it was 9:23 pm on the dot. I remember looking at the time when we got out”. Dario said completely sure of himself. 

“That creepy road,” he continued, pointing to it in front of us. “It took us about 10 minutes each to drive through it and back, so… 18 minutes I believe. Yeah we were in that parking lot for almost 20 minutes”, he repeated, answering my question. 

“And you’re sure?” I asked again

“Yes Pedro, I might be off by a minute or two but I know we were not in there for more than 20” He again answered.

“Ok make it 15 then, you’ve already been kind of keeping track of time. I want you to have a timer ready. Set it for exactly 15 minutes, you will start the countdown right when we enter the lot. We will be out of there before the 15 minutes are out. Okay Dario?” I said, figuring out the plan in my head.

“Lets also make one thing clear”, Andy said adding to the updated plan. ”We will not split up *unless absolutely necessary*, splitting up and exploring individually was based on assumptions that we would do so during the day. That is no longer an option, we don’t know anything about that place.” he said.

“I guess we won’t be needing these then, huh”? Dario said, holding his radio in one hand.

“No, I guess not,” Andy said thinking to himself for a moment. 

“Whether we stay close or not, there’s something about that place. It feels reckless to be in there, especially now that we plan on getting out of the car”. I said, looking over to my driver side door panel. My pepper spray bottle was sitting on the door's cup holder.

“I got that covered”. Andy replied, reaching behind his seat and grabbing his backpack. He zipped it open and quickly rummaged through it.

“Both of you get a 9mm each and I get to use my brand new 45” He said, handing Dario and I holstered pistols.

“Those are the twins, they are my old man’s, I know you guys don’t really shoot guns but it's better to have them than to need them and not”. He said.

Andy then proceeded to tell us where the safety was and how to unholster it. I was the last resort, I didn’t exactly have much experience with a gun and had only gone shooting once. Andy was of course more knowledgeable and skilled. Dario was decently familiar with a gun, at least more than I was. 

“You're a crazy man, no wonder your back pack was the heaviest when I loaded it” I said, glancing at Andy.

“Not crazy, ready is what I am. I was hoping we wouldn’t need them but if this place is this particularly unusual and hard to access, anything goes, anything could be in there, nothing is out of the question. After all our planning, you think I wasn't gonna bring a way to defend ourselves?” Andy said smiling and shaking his head.

“Alright let's go”! Dario said excitedly from the back seat. He was trying to stand in the car and lean his right hip towards us to show he had holstered the gun to his belt.

“Sit back down and put your seat belt on jackass” I said, hearing him laugh behind me.

“You’re both crazy,” I said, putting the truck back on drive. 

Leaving the familiar logging ground road behind we entered the mysterious road at last.

The local station our car radio was broadcasting at low volume went static immediately. This time around we made sure to check other stations that should’ve been available to us, no signal could be found.

Not entirely focused on the drive I was mentally going over possible situations we could run into. I was still in my head and admittedly going a little too fast when the road started going downhill. I failed to notice the increasing decline well through the fog and our vehicle picked up speed at a rapid pace, giving us quite the scare when it took a lot more effort to slow down than I anticipated.

“Slow the hell down man, don’t tease us and kill us this close to finding out the truth” Andy said hanging on to his passenger upper door handle.

“Sorry, I guess I’m being subconsciously impatient”, I said after having slowed down. 

“Nobody would find our bodies if we were to seriously crash here, huh? Dario said, letting out a negative thought.

“I’d rather not think about that” I quickly answered.

A few moments later the descending road finally went from dirt to pavement again. We had driven through the logging ground dirt road a total of four times so far. We hadn’t been as bothered by the rattling of our vehicle as much as the first time, perhaps due to our eagerness to get back. It's almost like I didn't even mind it anymore until we drove on pavement once more and I again realized just how much of a nuisance it was.

“We’ve hit the paved section of this weird fucking road, the Parking Lot should be close”. Andy assured us.

I slowed down further and anticipated the entrance.

The road we drove on started opening wider and wider once more until we arrived. I hit the brakes and came to a complete stop at the last few feet of the road right before it merged, we could just barely see some faded parking lines ahead of us through the fog.

“Ok Dario, this is it, you got the timer ready” I asked looking towards the backseat.

Dario fiddled with his old school watch on his wrist, I heard three loud beeps before receiving a thumbs up from him. 

“Ready to go, I’ll start it the moment we enter” he said, still looking down at his wrist. 

Our truck’s dash read 9:02 pm when we entered the Parking Lot again and Dario started the timer.

**Timer on: 15 Minutes**

I kept taking it slow to avoid the abandoned cars layered throughout. Unsure of which way to go I tried to stay in the same area Andy remembered driving through, soon seeing the familiar green rusted car.

It didn't take long for us to notice the red truck we were after was no longer in the general area Dario first saw it. It had likely been moved. I eventually saw the glow from the light pole Andy had seen before and decided to head that way. The same abandoned car we remembered rested near and reflected the beam, its windows catching the triangular glow. 

Through the fog I saw the faint glow of three more lights in the distance. Looking at the light sources closely I noticed one was different from the others. One glow was lower and clearly not coming from a light pole, I pointed it out and slowly drove towards it.

**13 minutes**

We continued to move towards the light until our path was blocked by several tarps layered on the floor of the lot. I tried to get as close to the tarps as possible, making sure our headlights highlighted a decent portion of them. We were then somewhat able to scan the tarps from a distance. 

The source was a camping light, a camping lantern to be precise. It wasn’t the cheapest kind either, growing up in a family that frequently camped I knew and recognized it as the type that can last for days on a set of D type batteries. 

Looking closely I noticed that there was an excessive amount of different lanterns posted throughout. On top of cars and on the floor, some were rechargeable and some appeared to run on gas. 

Whoever had built this set up bought any and perhaps every type of portable light source they could get their hands on; however, only the one that caught our attention was left on.

The amount of lanterns and the way they were placed gave me the impression they were not just there for light, they seemed to serve another purpose. 

The glow from the single lantern that was On revealed it sat on top of a foldable table. There were tools and mounds of random junk layered beside it. We could tell auto parts littered the tarps, some parts were covered and protected by moving pads. 2 surrounding abandoned vehicles were in the middle of being dismantled.

The whole setup was very similar to the current state of the junkyard belonging to that man. That place was fresh on our minds after having gone to revisit it just 2 hours before. We had also just seen him drive by us, everything we were looking at was likely his doing.

“Looks like we found that man’s base of operations. Let me get some shots of all that.” Dario said, getting his polaroid camera ready.

With the camera in one hand he opened the left back door and walked out of the truck. I kept the truck positioned with the headlights pointed straight to the tarps and auto parts. Dario snapped a few shots being careful to not get in the way and take full advantage of the headlights as well as the flash of the camera.

I started feeling like we were being watched the second Dario walked out of the truck, Andy felt the same way, we both also stepped out and looked around. The thought of someone watching us while hiding in one of the many abandoned vehicles made my skin crawl. 

Andy tucked his pistol in the front of his pants. I grabbed mine, put it in one of my hoodie’s pockets and walked out with my polaroid camera in hand. 

Dario had taken pictures of the workstation and tarped area. He was now closely checking out car parts. I walked over to two abandoned vehicles that were parked next to each other and took pictures of the backside, making sure the license plates were in frame. 

Dario then walked on the tarps doing his best to avoid stepping on the various auto parts. After he stepped over a side panel of some sort I saw what he was trying to do. There were things inside a black trash bag sitting on the opposite end of one of the tarps. Not wanting to go around in the dark he stayed in the light and walked through. He opened the bag to see what was inside.

“Pretty sure these are all catalytic converters, I remember seeing stashes of these on the news when they were being stolen from peoples rides” he said, holding one out of the bag.

“That man is definitely stealing auto parts from all these abandoned cars for profit,” I replied.

“Hey check this out, there’s a dog leash tied to this light pole” Andy then said, he was standing under the illumination of the light pole that happened to be closest to the tarps. 

Andy was the only one of us that carried his flashlight in hand. Dario and I had walked out holding only our polaroid cameras trying to stay within the slim confines of the truck’s headlights the whole time. 

I then walked in the darkness towards the beam of light coming from the light pole next to Andy. I stopped when I thought I heard light footsteps. Andy shined his flashlight in my direction and said it was probably a small animal when the light failed to reveal anything. Still listening closely, I heard a few strange faint noises but quickly dismissed them.

“You don’t have your flashlight on you?” Andy asked as I walked towards him.

“No, it's inside the truck”. I answered.

“We need to be on the same page and carry our light and pistol with us at all times man, it's too damn dark I don't want one of us to trip and get hurt or something”. “That goes for you too Dario.” Andy said loudly, slightly annoyed.

"At least carry your phones on you to use as a flashlight” Andy added.

“Our phones are useless here man, besides, we won’t be in here for much longer anyway”, I told him. 

“How much time do we have left Dario?” I then asked.

“*11 minutes 30 seconds*” Dario answered back, his voice somewhat muffled, likely due to the fog.

When I got to Andy I saw what he was talking about. There was a leash with a hook at the end tied to the light pole, the type that straps onto the collar of a dog.

“That probably belongs to the dog that stripped your ass,” I said laughing loudly.

“Shut it!” Andy said, still annoyed. He then began to tell me his theory.

“Ok so we know he brings his dog in here for some reason, but this is a lot of work, there’s no way he’s doing all this alone, right?” Andy asked me. We both then started to walk back to the car.

“That actually makes a lot of sense. He’s gotta have at the very least another person working with him, more accomplices now that his “business” is growing”. I said, jumping to the same conclusion.

Dario was already inside the car when we walked back. He had all the pictures he had taken on his lap. He was looking at the ones that had already developed and waiting for the rest.

“You get good shots of everything”? Andy asked him, sitting back in the car. His eyes wincing from the interior light of the truck.

“Yeah we are looking good, thank god polaroid cameras work here. It sucks that we couldn't find that truck but I got quite a bit of pictures of license plates. Maybe we can link them to missing cases”. Dario answered, studying his pictures closely. 

“Here’s a few more” I said, pulling out the pictures I took out of my pocket and handing them to him in the backseat. 

“Alright wrap it up, let's get the hell out of here and head home I think we got what we needed” I said proceeding to go around the tarps instead of making a U turn.

**9 minutes**

“I wish we could keep exploring, we still don’t know anything about this place”. Andy said frustrated.

“I’m not sure exploring any further would answer any of our remaining questions. Finding that truck is next to impossible in here and either way the answers aren’t worth us getting stuck in here.” I said trying to prioritize our safety over everything else. Admittedly, I also wanted to continue exploring but we were running out of time. 

We had accomplished the feat of finding our way back to the Parking Lot. We had pretty much confirmed our suspicion of that man frequenting the area and somehow exploiting it. Whatever this place was. 

That was the question that still bothered us, the question that would still remain. 

Exactly what was this place?

“Ok I'll take it slow and cruise out of here, it won't take us more than a few minutes to get to the exit and leave, we have plenty of time to keep an eye out for anything while we roll out.” I said driving at a steady pace.

“We should black mail that man and make him tell us everything he knows,” Andy suddenly said out of nowhere.

“What?!” I asked, stopping the car, surprised at his suggestion.

“We have pictures now and know exactly how to get back here if need be”, he continued. He was talking impulsively, proud of himself for coming up with this great new idea.

“Ok now you are actually going crazy” I immediately replied, releasing my foot from the brakes.

“Everything we know about him is based on assumptions. We don’t have any concrete evidence on him. How would we link him to this place?.” Dario asked, interested in the idea.

Andy had evidently thought of this before and already had a plan in mind.

“We don’t have to link him to anything. All we have to do is prove to him that we know of this place with the pictures we took. Tell him we want in on exactly whatever the hell he’s doing in here if he seems to be doing well. In return we won’t tell more people about this place and how to get to it, especially the authorities. He is clearly making a business out of this place he won’t have a choice but to…

What the hell?!” Andy interrupted himself and stopped mid sentence, looking out his window. 

**8 minutes**

Turning left after going around the tarps, I also noticed it.

On our right we could see the edge of the parking lot where the forest met the pavement. I stopped turning and moved towards the edge slowly, facing it straight.

We looked past the old wheel stops and past the fading red concrete lip of the curb, not recognizing what we were seeing.

Our truck’s headlights revealed it was a forest, but not *our* forest. Ahead of us the trees were a dark purple hue and leafless. The bark on said trees had an odd wavy texture, the branches swirled and curled in ways that looked unnatural. The tall grass was an even darker shade of purple.

The forest was unfamiliar, it looked like nothing we had ever seen.

“Holy shit!” Dario said, leaning forward.

All three of us were mesmerized. None of us had the ability to anticipate just how much of a big deal finding this place was. We were awestruck at our discovery.

Andy suddenly opened his passenger door and stopped before opening it fully.

I could now hear the noises that forest produced clearly. The sounds seemed to also put Andy on edge, he held the door open partially ready to close it at a moment's notice. We both listened to the sounds closely.

I assume that what we heard were night sounds of that otherworldly forest. Alternate versions of nocturnal creatures.

**7 Minutes**

Dario was unbothered and opened his back door ready to walk out of the car, with only the goal to get good pictures on his mind.

“Don’t go out there” I quickly told him. 

“Why?” He asked, with one foot already out the door.

“What lives in those woods? You don’t think something could be looking right back at us?”. Andy asked Dario, answering his question with another. Dario then stepped back inside and closed his door.

Andy and I were thinking the same thing. The feeling that I was being watched hadn’t gone away, he likely also felt the same. We agreed to no longer step out of the car. Andy kept his right hand on his holstered pistol. 

Seeing as Dario was sitting directly behind me on the backseat, I turned and steered the truck to the right making sure that forest was now on our left side. Dario could now easily take pictures of that forest from his window without having to step out. He opened his window just enough to hold his camera out, I excitedly did the same.  

No longer illuminated by our truck's headlights, the purple forest briefly came back into view every time Dario and I’s cameras flashed.

I put the truck back on drive, moving forward slowly and staying close to the edge. I made sure Dario could continue taking photos of the forest while we moved. We were beginning to find the odd sounds coming from the forest a bit humorous now that Dario had tried to mimic one of the sounds to little success.

**6 minutes**

“Wait look” I said mid chuckle. Albeit slowly, we were still moving and I could see another paved path being revealed through the darkness and fog. It headed left, putting a stop to the unfamiliar forest and opening up the edge of the parking lot. It was sandwiched between both forests. We could see that the right side of the small road met familiar green vegetation while the left side met the strange purple woods. 

The road split the two types of woodlands and reminded me of the point of confluence of two bodies of water.

“Theres another way out of here, which means there's more than one way to enter this place”. Andy said, going from smiling to straight faced in a second. 

“That’s one hell of a drive,” Dario replied, still looking at the new path. “Two different types of woods on either side, that would trip me out” He said, taking a picture of the road entrance.

“I wonder where it leads? Do you guys think that path abides by the same rules as the way we entered?” I asked, completely stopping the car. 

Neither of them answered. We were all in our thoughts again. Many things were being thrown at us at once, this place was posing too many questions with no time to react. It was becoming overwhelming. I was correct in feeling like it would only get worse.

“Keep driving on the edge there might be more to see”. Andy suggested. 

**5 minutes**

Forgetting to check the time we continued moving and hugging the perimeter of the lot. Heading the opposite way of our exit, we widened the distance it would take to get out of there.

Driving on the edge was clearly the safest and fastest way to keep moving at a steady pace. Most abandoned cars were parked towards the center of the lot. Hardly any cars came into view in front of us through the fog and darkness.

We followed the edge until we hit a corner, the fog made it seem like this place went on forever but that was not the case. Finally able to somewhat gauge just how big this Parking Lot was, we made the turn and continued driving close to the curb on our left. 

Our exit road was now on the furthest opposite side. I wish we could’ve realized this then, but the distractions kept coming and curiosity got the best of us.

“Am I imagining it, or is there something there?” Dario asked, looking out his right window.

“What do you mean?” I asked, looking in the direction he pointed.

“Two light poles in the distance just disappeared as I looked out, they’re being blocked or I think something came into view in front of them from this perspective.” Dario said, trying to explain what he had just noticed.

We all looked in that direction. At first I didn’t see anything but I turned the car and moved in. It wasn’t until I had to go around some abandoned cars that I also noticed that even through the fog, two of the light poles in the distance had come back into view.

Dario was right, there was something there, something big. 

We moved towards it, past the fog and through the darkness it took form. A dark wide rectangular structure soon came into view. It wasn't until we were at least 15 feet close, positioned in a way that we could get a somewhat clear sight of it, seeing just how massive it actually was.

“Thats a huge building, what is that like three stories tall?” “Even if I tried I don’t think I can stand far enough to get a good shot of that. All this fog would just get in the way”. Dario said, looking at the building.

“That looks like a mall, I think there's a parking garage connected to it on one side” Andy said trying to look past the darkness, nearly sticking his head to the glass window.

It did look like a mall. I stayed moving beside it and noticed we were driving past its front side when we drove by what must’ve been the entryway. A huge entrance frame with glass windows beginning at what must’ve been the second floor stuck out of the building. This was seemingly where the entrance door and name of the mall should’ve been but it was missing both.

There was no way to enter. Much like this lot, there had to be a way, we all thought. 

Was this supernatural Parking Lot simply in place for an abandoned mall?, I asked myself. I briefly thought about how finding an abandoned mysterious mall back when we first started urban exploring would’ve been a big deal for us. How much simpler things were just a few months ago. Instead, finding this place here was part of a bigger puzzle we couldn't hope to soon understand. 

Avoiding the connected parking garage we confirmed that there was no entrance after quickly driving around to the back of the building.

We were throwing out theories about the structure when all of a sudden we heard an engine turn on from the front side of the building. The opposite side of where we were.

We listened closely.

“Dammit” I said in a low voice, hearing the car move.

I heard it increase in speed and move from the other side of the building. It never got closer. On the contrary, it seemed to stray further away from us, becoming more faint. We could barely hear it now but knew it was still there. We weren't the only ones here. Somebody had been keeping an eye on us the whole time.  

“We need to get out,” Andy whispered through gritted teeth, still holding the pistol in his right hand.

“Damn, we all got distracted," I said looking at the clock on our truck's dash. It read 9:14 pm.

“*3 minutes 35 seconds* remaining on my watch,” Dario said nervously.

Through the fog I drove cautiously, headed back the way we entered. We left that building behind and moved towards our exit. We no longer heard the running car but kept an eye out for anything out of the ordinary. Of course that was easier said than done, memorizing the cars was next to impossible with all the fog and darkness. It was hard to be aware of where we were within the Parking Lot. 

Correctly assuming that someone was hiding with their headlights Off amongst the many cars, we kept moving towards our exit soon hearing the sound of an idling car. 

It was getting louder.  

We were headed straight towards it. What were we to do? Turn off our headlights and hide? Lose our chance to exit this place before even trying?

No, we needed to get out and we needed to do so that very moment. Presumably, unlike the missing teens, we were ready to get out by force if need be.

I had a feeling getting out of there wouldn't be as easy as getting in, I wasn’t as surprised at what we would soon run into.

There was a police cruiser blocking our exit. The officer inside turned on his headlights and red overhead light when we got 20 feet close. 

He was purposely obstructing our path and keeping his vehicle at an angle. 

Now presented with the opposite dilemma, getting out wouldn't be as simple as we anticipated.
