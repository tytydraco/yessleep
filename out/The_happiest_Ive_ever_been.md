What happened to me took place when I was 14 years old.

I was a pretty miserable kid... but it’s not like I was the victim of a bad household or anything. My parents were always kind, loving, and I never really asked them for much—but if I did, they always tried their best to fulfill my needs.

It’s just that I had no real friends. Not the kind that elicited Kodak memories at least. So I spent most evenings and weekends just sitting around at home, occasionally puppeteered by my own random spurts of adolescent imagination.

There was a day I was working on a science project in my room when my mother stopped by my doorway inquisitively. She began by asking what I was working on, and I replied, “It’s the solar system,” to which she smiled, caressing the doorframe, and complimented how well it was coming along. I knew she wanted to tell me something, but I wasn’t sure what it was.

“Listen... honey, your cousins are coming to stay with us for a week or two. Sarah, Michael, and Aliza.”

Hearing this, I remember feeling immediate anger, but not for a reason you’d expect. Michael was *my* name. I had always hated being around him because of the annoyance of not knowing if someone was calling for me or him. Then soon after, another thought came to mind: these weren’t even my real cousins—they were just my mom’s best friend’s kids.

“Why?!” I asked, setting down the paper mâché Mars I had in hand.

“Their mom's going through a tough time. I need you to be understanding about this, okay?”

“Aren’t they, like, super religious? Can’t the church help them or something?”

She glared at me, and I understood—I couldn’t say no.

After a couple of minutes discussing where they’d sleep (I fought hard to keep my room sacred), we came to the agreement that two weeks would be fine, and only if they slept in the living room. I’m reluctant to believe I had a choice on much else.

When they arrived at the apartment a few days later, my parents greeted a man I had never met, accompanied by my cousins at the door. As they peeked around the corner, waving and smiling in my direction, a rush of unforeseen dread overtook me. I hadn’t realized until then, but since we were around the same age, I was to take on the role of host. I didn’t really do much—so how was I supposed to entertain them?

Wielding sweaty palms, I returned their greeting.

The day proceeded smoother than expected. We ordered takeout, watched a couple of movies back-to-back, and Dad recited jokes that I had already heard a million times. Before I knew it, it was time for bed.

During that first night, I was snapped awake by a sharp, burning pain throbbing from the top of my head. I reached up to feel what it could be, but found nothing. I never move in my sleep—let alone slam my head against the headboard. So I stayed sitting up for a moment, looking around my room, but all I could see was darkness. 

Eventually, I shrugged it off and tried to go back to sleep.

It wasn’t until the next day that my fears came into actuality about the entertainment ordeal. It was around 5 p.m. when Michael began exclaiming that he was bored—and after he expressed this, like a choir, his sisters echoed the same complaint.

I was at a loss on what to do. I’d been working on my homework for the last hour, and they had the PlayStation hooked up. I proceeded to tell them, all while attempting not to sound frustrated... that I was almost finished, and afterward, I could ask my parents to rent another movie.

“THERE’S A PARK NEARBY, YOU GUYS CAN PLAY THERE!” my father shouted from the other room.

I groaned at the thought.

My parents knew that I really didn’t like leaving the house besides for school—so why would they bring this up? I guess I realized that maybe they were worried about me, and that I was too young to be a recluse. So, riddled with immediate humiliation, I agreed that we should go play at the park.

As I was putting my shoes on, and Michael was asking my dad if he had any sort of ball, Aliza slowly approached me with her hands behind her back, wearing an unnerving smile. She gently whispered in my ear.

“You have really nice hair.”

I sat up from tying my shoes, and stared at her, confused.

“Don’t be weird!” Sarah said, breaking the silence.

“Come on, let’s go!” Michael shouted while sprinting out from my parents’ room, accompanied by a half-inflated soccer ball.

The park wasn’t much—just a big field, flanked by towering oak trees barely clinging to life. Toward the leftmost tree was a pitiful-looking playground. Sarah and Aliza wandered to the sandpit in which it sat, while Michael and I played a made-up version of one-on-one kickball. We stayed playing even a little after the sun had retired, then headed back to the apartment.

The days that followed sang a familiar tune. Each morning, we’d wake up around the same time, Mom and Dad already in the kitchen, cooking or reheating something that resembled breakfast. The apartment would fill with laughter and pointless conversation. After school, I’d sit down to do my homework while my cousins watched TV or played video games.

And afterward, without fail, we’d head to the park, and play.

Another thing that became a routine—but of a different kind—was that every other night I was shocked into consciousness by that hot, searing pain coming from the top of my head.

I told my mom about it, and she assumed that I was just incredibly stressed. I told her I wasn't too bothered by my cousins, and that I felt like it might be something else. She rested her hand on my shoulder and assured me that we’d keep an eye on it.

The morning after the fourth painful occurrence, as I combed my hair before school, I noticed something strange. When I tilted my head forward, I spotted it: a bald patch on the crown of my head.

My stomach sank to the floor as my trembling fingers excavated the horrific discovery.

Before I could process what I was seeing, Sarah called from the other room.

“Michael!”

I ignored it—probably calling for my cousin.

But soon she burst into the bathroom doorway.

“Michael, have you seen my Bible?”

“Uh… no? Why?” I mumbled, still staring at my reflection.

“Haha, I found it!” Aliza said, panting, joining her sister at the door.

She held a book that looked ancient. The cracked black leather barely holding the pages together.

I stared at it.

Sarah caught my gaze. “It was a gift from my mom—for my 16th birthday,” she said quickly, her eyes darting around the room. She didn’t look at me directly, as if I’d just seen something I wasn’t supposed to. Then Sarah walked back to the living room, leaving Aliza standing in the doorway.

Her eyes were fixed on the top of my head. Could she really see it from down there? I wondered to myself. Embarrassed, I forced a polite smile and closed the door.

Later that day, after school, and yet another visit to the park, I searched for a candle I could keep lit in my room while I slept. Maybe the light could keep me safe. 

Unfortunately, it hadn’t.

Again, I was jolted awake by this torturous routine.

When I awoke, to my surprise, it was pitch black again. As I reached for the lighter in my pocket, I heard a creak—followed by a shuffle on the floorboards. Panicked, I quickly leaned over and relit the candle. When the amber glow filled the room, my world froze. Standing at the crack of my bedroom door was Aliza,

staring directly at me.

Her eyes were wide and glassy. We were locked in a perpetual stare. Her cold, lifeless expression didn't shift at first... until a slow, deliberate grin contorted her face. Then, without a word, she faded back into the darkness of the hallway.

I got up quickly and shut the door, locking it. As I did this, I heard a whisper coming from the living room.

It was Sarah.

“Good job. That should be enough for it.”

I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night...

When everyone gathered for breakfast the next morning, the silence was palpable. It wasn’t just me anymore. As pots and pans clattered in the kitchen, my parents occasionally glanced behind them with raised eyebrows, silently exchanging looks. 

I kept my eyes on the table, poking and prodding the microwaved waffle before me, trying not to seem as off-kilter as I felt. When I glanced up across the table, I caught Michael doing the same—head hung low, eyes fixed on the plate before him. 

It was the first time all week the kitchen had been this quiet during breakfast.

It was when I glanced up for a second time, I noticed something I hadn’t before.

His hair.

At a glance, it looked the same as always—messy, a little unkempt. But as he leaned forward slightly, I saw that the hair from the crown of his head was shorter than the rest, thinning in some places, as if it were growing back unevenly.

"Alright, ya grunts! Time for school!" my dad exclaimed, snapping the dead air back to life. As he escorted us out the door, he let us know that my cousins' mother would be picking them up the next day.

My shoulders dropped in gratitude.

When the final bell rang at 3 p.m., I was snapped back into the reality of my situation. I didn’t want to go home. I was terrified, but what choice did I have?

My lighthouse was the fact that this was their last day staying with us. Just one more day.

When I got home, all three of my cousins were already glued to the TV, playing Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater. I walked past them quickly, forcing my face into something that resembled a reassuring half-grin, and went straight to my homework.

But just as I was about to finish, like always, it was time for us to head to the park.

As I was about to reach for my shoes, Sarah placed her hand gently on my shoulder. The moment I felt it, my body froze in place. I wasn’t sure what I was supposed to do. She leaned in—very close—and whispered into my ear, just as I had heard her whisper to her sister the night before.

“We’re going to show you the angel now.”

In that moment, I almost screamed for my parents' rescue. I was so struck with raw fear that my mind didn’t know what else to do. But I didn’t. I already knew how religious my cousins were, so I thought maybe... they wanted to pray or something? I didn’t know. But that doubt was enough to keep my mouth shut at the time.

The walk to the park felt longer than usual. There was a time I started to enjoy these trips, but now, all I felt was an overwhelming urge to just go home. My so-called cousins made me feel incredibly uneasy. Before today, when we walked, I always felt like I was guiding them—leading them. This was my neighborhood, after all. But now everything was different. Everyone walked ahead of me. Michael didn’t kick rocks off the sidewalk like he usually did, and Sarah and Aliza walked straighter, almost formal.

Once we arrived, Sarah stopped, and without turning around, spoke in a flat, monotone voice.

“You don’t have to be so nervous. Just follow us.”

She guided my cousins and me toward the crooked oak tree nearest the playground. Michael and I had always played games on the field, but it wasn’t until we were this close that I could see just how old the playground was. What really stood out, though, was that it was completely unusable. No kids had played here in a very long time.

Once we arrived at the spot Sarah wanted, she directed us one by one to where we’d sit. As she did, I noticed markings etched into the tree—jumbled lines that, together, formed a symbol I didn’t recognize, though the patterns were unmistakable.

The detail was intricate, and it must have taken nearly all of our visits here to complete whatever it was. Each line carefully carved, meticulously.

Once we were all arranged in a semi-circle around the symbol, Sarah revealed her old, disheveled Bible, along with something else that took me a moment to identify. But once I did, it almost possessed me to vomit.

It was my hair—too much of my hair—tied together with yarn I recognized from my mom’s crochet work.

The ends of each clump were adorned with skin, dried and shriveled.

“What the fuck, Sarah!” I shouted.

“SHUT UP! HE DOESN’T LIKE THAT!” Aliza screeched, her eyes filled with fear as she stared at me.

Sarah lunged in my direction, and before I could react, she tugged at the top of my head.

“STOP—!” I yelped.

“It’s okay,” Sarah said once again in her monotone demeanor. “Just a little more.”

Before I knew it, it was too late.

Sarah pulled the lighter I kept in my nightstand from her pocket and lit the bundle of hair on fire. Quickly, the acrid stench enveloped the air, worsening my urge to hurl onto the dirt below.

The flame grew and the black smoke thickened. Sarah lowered the bundle below her chin and did something that petrified me with pure disbelief. She exhaled completely, flattening her lungs, devoid of any oxygen, then proceeded to inhale powerfully and smoothly, now filling her lungs with the pure black soot that had once been my hair.

Her eyebrows furrowed as she focused intensely on the hymn she began to recite.

And what she uttered that day... was no language I had ever heard—before or since.

All of a sudden, a visceral, heavy bass tone encompassed my entire being—a vibration so loud, so powerful, it engulfed my ears, rattled through my mind, and shook my vision from the inside out.

Before me stood an enormous apparition—something huge, imposing. Evil.

My body seized, every single muscle contracting explosively all at once. In my peripheral vision, I saw that each of my cousins was captive to the same experience.

What was happening escalated quickly—more and more—until I thought I was about to crush my own teeth from the sheer force of my clenched jaw.

But as quickly as it appeared, it vanished.

What happened next is what I still find hardest to explain...

I remember feeling relieved—so relieved—that the pain and noise was finally over. It had felt like an eternity.

But I couldn’t see.

Not that I was blind, or unable to use my eyes. It’s just… what I saw, my mind couldn’t comprehend.
What I was perceiving felt like colors no one had ever experienced before. Everything, and everyone—was warped, grotesquely disfigured.

Like reflections on broken glass.

My body was electrified—charged with radiant, undefinable energy. It was bliss.

What I was experiencing in this moment, was pure bliss.

Sarah, Aliza, Michael, and I erupted from the dirt, crashing together in an unimaginably satisfying group hug.

I was terrified—everything about it was wrong. Their faces were wrong.

But I felt nothing but joy.

We danced and paraded around the oak tree, swirling, prancing, smiling.

It hurt. Everything about it hurt.

Tears fell from our eyes—not from the fear, but from the pain of not being able to express the love and joy we felt inside loudly enough.

The world twisted around us, and I have no idea how long we were stuck there.

In that hell I could’ve never imagined existed.

In a desperate attempt to quiet the unbearable mutilation of my very consciousness, I grabbed Sarah and kissed her. It wasn’t love, not really, just the desperate attempt to satisfy the chaos inside.

That’s when everything went dark.

I don't know what happened after, but I awoke in my bed.

When I opened my eyes, my mother was sitting beside me, gently brushing my hair.

"Oh honey! Gosh you were out like a light! How are you feeling?"

That morning, my mother explained that my cousins had gone home. She said they brought me back to the apartment pretty late from the park the day before, and that I’d been completely out of it. She assumed I’d caught some kind of virus, and I just went with it.

At first, I told no one. Honestly, I didn’t even understand what had happened.

Was it all a dream? Did I actually just get sick?

I slowly raised my hand to my scalp, to the spot where the bald patch would be—and to my horror

It was very much still there.

I'm writing this from my room at Prairie Horizons Recovery Center. 

I'm 38 years old now, and I've tried every single drug there is on God's ugly earth.

After that night, I started chasing it. Anything to feel even a sliver of that again.

But nothing.

Nothing will ever come close to the happiest I've ever been.
