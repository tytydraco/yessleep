Let me start this off by saying that I am not a porn addict, and if I make it through this I am *NEVER* going to visit a porn site again.

Last week, I broke things off with my girlfriend of three years when I came home from work to find her with two other guys in our bed. I fell into a bit of a depression and spent the next week getting stinking drunk trying to forget about her.

I was so deeply in love with her, I was probably coming off as beyond pathetic. She would call my phone begging for forgiveness and it took everything in me to block her number.

Some time passed and one night after I had guzzled a few beers I was feeling a little... frisky and decided to fire up my old desktop for some quality one on one time with myself.

Now, this is where shit gets weird. You've probably seen those ads on porn sites like "fuck local milfs in your area tonight!" (Don't kid yourselves, I know you have) I saw one of those, but I almost spit out my sip of beer in laughter at the headline.

"Fuck a local witch tonight!" The caption read, accompanied by a picture of a hot young blonde and a redhead, both dressed in nothing but a couple of traditional long pointy black witch hats with buckles above the brim.

"The fuck is this?" I remember chuckling to myself, I *had* to investigate further and clicked the pop up.

It brought me to a page that looked like a tinder clone, and I was prompted to set up a profile. After triple checking with my anti virus program to confirm I wouldn't lose my credit card information or anything, I decided to join. This was the most fun that I'd had since the breakup and I wasn't even thinking about what's-her-face as I set up my account.

After about 5 minutes of the usual song and dance where I picked the best pictures of myself and wrote a little blurb for my profile, I was ready to begin swiping. I began clicking "yes" on just about every goth girl I saw and within a couple minutes I had run out of profiles. I was about to close the site when I got a notification for a match, and a message.

"Heyyyy" it read.

"Hey yourself" I replied, cringing at how un-smooth my words were.

I double checked her profile and saw that she was only a mile away from me, she had only one photo of herself, but that was all I needed to go off of. She wore purple lipstick in the picture with matching purple hair and a black leather corset that looked like it was threatening to pop off of her at any second.

I was smitten.

We talked for a couple more minutes before she dropped the big message.

"Why don't you just come over, we're very close"

I don't think my shoes were tied up before I jumped out of the house and into my car. I was on such a mixed buzz of beers and endorphins I just felt invincible, never mind the dangers of driving drunk or showing up to a strangers house at 1am in the morning.

Her place was just down the block from mine, but it was enough out of the way that I had never been there myself. It just lead into the suburbs, out of the way of anyplace I would ever need to actually be.

My jaw almost hit the floor when I saw her house, it must have been the oldest place in the area, it looked like it was built by some wealthy family a hundred years ago. I'm no expert in architecture, and could only go on record as saying it reminded me of where Lizzie Borden may have lived.

I started to get cold feet as I approached her porch, the situation I was in was becoming too real for me, it was one thing to flirt online, but the reality of who and or *what* was behind that door, was starting to tie knots in my stomach. Fighting every ounce of sensible being that was left, behind my façade of 5 beers and a hard-on strong enough to make a temple of nuns cry, I rang the doorbell.

I was pleasantly surprised when she answered the door, and equally horrified when I realized I had no idea what her name was. I decided to open with a "heeey" leaning into the doorway, arms crossed, and holding back on every urge I had to pull finger guns and wink or some other cheesy move. I don't know if that was just my own awkward self, or maybe a curse placed on me by the lone *Budweiser* I'd left on my dresser to watch me guzzle their friends.

Whatever, I was in after all! I remember taking off my shoes as she spoke to me, I don't really remember what she said, or how she said it, but I remember sipping wine on a couch with her, and the next, I was in her bed.

I wish I had more details to go off of, but, I must have blacked out somehow during my time there. I just remember a couple of flashes of her on top me, once she looked exactly like she did in her photo, but the next, her plump, purple colored lips, faded to a withered and dried out black, all flakey and cold like the old coals of a smoldered fire. Her skin hung from her body, like wax trying to run off of a burning candle wick. She looked older than anybody I had ever seen alive.

The last thing I remember from that night, was her standing over my body inside a circle of blue candles, their tips all burning a bright orange as she mumbled something to herself. Finally, she mumbled something a little louder and final sounding, then all the candles went out.

That's the last thing I remember before waking up in my bed today.

I was clutching my head, like I had the worst hangover of the century, I felt itchy all over my body... but the worst was when I went to the bathroom to shower and found these... purple welts all over my junk.

They were swelling, and I almost threw up at the pure shock and disgust I felt looking at them. I turned on the shower to a scorching hot temperature just hoping to take the swelling down or melt them off altogether, I just needed release from the growing ache of them.

That was my worst mistake, besides showing up to that chicks house in the first place.

The warts began to pop, one by one, and these little tiny black creatures began to fly out of them, they couldn't have been bigger than a common house spider, but they all started to pile up in the corner of the room, getting to be roughly as big as a grapefruit.

I screamed, and turned off the shower as I threw a shampoo bottle at the growing black mass. They began to scatter under the bathroom door or down the sink. I stood there, naked and afraid in the shower for second before shaking myself to my senses and grabbing a towel to throw on before heading back to my room.

I immediately turned my PC on, and went to my search history to find the dating site I had used the night before to find the source of my living nightmare, but there was no trace of it.

I tried every possible name the site could have been called, but I turned up empty handed. All the while purple warts had began to form on my chest and arms.

I had one Hail Mary left though, I checked my cars GPS and found the address I had gone to the night before, I plugged the coordinates back in and and put my foot to the floor.

And just like the first time, my jaw hung by its hinges when I saw her house again, but for the wrong reasons.

I found myself standing in front of a dilapidated, run down old mess of a house, with a sign in the front stating a date for its demolition.

I got closer to inspect, the lawn was feral and long, like it hadn't been touched in a decade or more, the windows and front door were boarded up with some form of "trespassers beware" sign on all of them.

Defeated, I came home and began typing this, but I've been here doing that for a while now and my situation is just getting worse. The warts on my chest and arms have been getting so big they've been pushing against each other until they burst open, the things that keep coming out of them are just getting bigger and bigger too.

They're now piling up into the corner of my room, they’ve gotten to the size and shape of a featureless toddler now, I threw a chair at it, but it contorted itself like a rag doll, bending at an inhuman angle to avoid it, I'm very scared.

The warts have been growing over my face and almost completely obscuring my vision too, I can now hear that *thing* in the corner mimicking human breath, I don't know what it's trying to do or what it thinks it can accomplish, but I'm calling an ambulance and the police before I just become a hive for these things to spawn, I'll try to leave updates if anything else occurs, but I'm afraid this might be the last anyone hears of me.

Please everyone, avoid witch dating sites at all cost, I wish I had.
