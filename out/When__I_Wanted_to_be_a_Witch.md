It used to be just me and my mom, years ago. She worked most of the time, so really it was just me. My books and my scratched Nas CD, cycled through with No Doubt and Fugees, were my only company. That’s not why I was angry. Shuffled between schools and houses, awkward and overweight, my life just didn’t fit me right. I wanted the power to change it. Witchcraft was as good an answer as any. 

The internet was the instruction manual I needed. Candles and salt were easy to find. The incantations were short and the symbols simple to draw. I asked whatever any other twelve-year-old would ask for: to be beautiful and to know my future. I wanted control over everything, the way they made things happen in The Craft. 
But it wasn’t like that at all. At first nothing happened. 

“I must have done it wrong.” I told myself. But then one day, the air shifted in the house, and I found myself always uncomfortable and nervous. 

One night, home alone like usual, I was eating my instant mac n’ cheese and mesmerized with Pokémon when my stomach flipped and my skin went cold. A wave of heartbreak crashed over my mood. I couldn’t breathe. Tears welled in my eyes and stung them red. I was instantly, hopelessly sad. I’d never felt such a lonely suffocating sadness before or since. It made me crave death just to be numb.

I panicked. This wasn’t me and if these feelings weren’t me, then who – or what – was inside me? 

I ran as quickly I could upstairs, which wasn’t very quick since my legs felt like they were stuck in mud. I collapsed on the top step. Whatever had happened it was over. I felt like me again, only now, confused and scared.

I was uneasy the rest of the night. I waited as long as I could to go back downstairs, but I had to clean up or I would get in trouble. It didn’t happen again and I was grateful. 
But it wasn’t over. 

That night I had a nightmare, too real to dismiss. I saw myself in my room, sleeping. My bedroom door rattled and whatever was on the other side growled and hissed in anger. I didn’t remember locking the door though – there was something else keeping the door shut. That’s when I realized I wasn’t asleep. I was sitting up in bed, hands laced together, words spilling out of my mouth, hurried and certain.
 
“Hail Mary, full of grace…” 

Confused and frightened I watched myself recite words with perfection that I’d never heard before. 

“Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners… ” 

That’s when I realized I was reciting a prayer, a beautiful prayer that was protecting me from whatever was on the other side of that door. 

I woke up trembling. I couldn’t remember the prayer, only pieces of it. I tried testing myself to see if maybe, somewhere in the buried parts of my brain I could recite the prayer the way I did in my nightmare and that would explain everything. I couldn’t though. It just wasn’t there. That morning, I destroyed the symbols I’d hidden under my bed. I burned them all. My mom sold the house to a friend, who one day asked nervously if we had ever had anything weird happen in the house. They only lived there a year. The people after them moved within four months. The house changed owners several more times, but after the incident, I stopped keeping track. I don’t like to think that I could be the reason for that old woman’s death, but the news report called her drowning a “freak accident” and so I can’t rule myself out.  

That was the last time I played with things I don’t understand.
