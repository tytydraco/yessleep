Hello Reddit,

I’m not sure what’s going on, and I feel like I’m losing my grip on things. I’m a principal at a small elementary school in a quiet, suburban town. Recently, something strange has been happening with a few of my students, and it’s got me a little unnerved. I’m hoping someone here can shed some light on it, because honestly, I’m not sure what to make of it anymore.

Over the past month or so, I’ve had multiple kids come into my office, each with a similar story—something about a man in the woods behind the school. At first, I figured it was just kids being kids, coming up with stories to get attention or something like that. But the more I heard it, the more it started to feel… strange.

Here’s what the kids have been telling me.. 

They say there’s a man who lives in the woods just behind the school. He’s always whistling a tune, a soft, eerie sound that seems to carry through the trees and some of them have heard the whistling on their way home, others have said they’ve seen the man in the distance, standing still between the trees, watching them,  but it’s the details that are starting to get to me. The kids aren’t just describing the man in vague terms—some of them describe things I hate to imagine on or near school property, or to any of my students outside of school. One child even mentioned that the man always says, “Come closer, I won’t hurt you.”

I’ve talked to the parents about it, but they seem just as puzzled. One mother even mentioned that her child,one of the higher achieving ones Evan,has been acting unusually paranoid, afraid to walk anywhere near the woods. His parents were convinced something happened to him, but when I pressed him about it, he just said he’d had a nightmare about the man. I chalked it up to an overactive imagination, but the more kids come to me with similar stories, the harder it is to ignore.

I went into the woods myself after school one day to make sure nothing was going on. I figured if there was anyone out there, I’d put an end to it and just tell them to stay away from the school grounds and keep their distance from the kids. I walked into the woods for a good while. I didn’t hear anything unusual, no whistling, no movement. I made sure to take a good look around, even went as far as the old boundary fence, and there was nothing. No sign of anyone.

But then, just as I was turning to head back, I heard it. A faint whistle—barely audible over the rustling of the trees. I figured it was just the wind at first, but it wasn’t. It was too deliberate, too rhythmic.

It stopped just as suddenly as it started. I was already out of the woods and back to my car by then, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. 

I know it sounds crazy. I know. But after everything the kids have been saying, and now this strange sound in the woods... I can’t help but wonder if something is going on that I’m missing.

Anyway, I’m just reaching out to see if anyone here has ever heard of anything like this before. Is it just kids with wild imaginations, or is there something more to this than I’m understanding? Should I be concerned?

Thanks in advance for any help.
