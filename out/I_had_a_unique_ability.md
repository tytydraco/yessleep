 It started when I was 12. I don’t know how I got it, but it allowed me to escape my abusive foster father, by becoming him. My father disappeared and my mother was in the mental hospital.
 
 When I first used my ability, it wasn’t intentional, and I was confused at first(and so was he). I remember him grabbing me by the neck and choking me. I looked into his eyes just as I was blacking out. But suddenly, instead of blacking out, I saw a blinding flash with a loud whooshing sound in my head.

 Next thing I knew, I was choking a kid, and that kid was me. I let go, feeling very confused. I saw ‘me’ with the same look of horror and confusion. I looked into the mirror, and saw my step dad. The 12 year old kid then shouted “wtf is going on!?”. I then realized what had happened. 
 It took me a while to process the situation. Just then my foster mother came home. If there was a problem, they would often beat me, or lock me in the basement. Only this time it wasn’t me. I told her what he did, Essentially making up a story. She grabbed “me” by the ear, and threw me into the basement and locked the door. That night, I left with my foster father’s car, money and identity, and never came back. 
 
 I explored my new ability first by trying to figure out how to get it working. I tested it on  animals at first. It wasn’t until I realized that eye contact might be the key. I came across a dog running around in the yard. I started petting him and focused on his eyes.  Then it happened. I was on all fours, and the world looked and smelled different. Eventually there was a 911 call about a man running around acting like an animal. I wish I saw my foster mother’s face when they would eventually contact her. I then tried it again on the owner. I left the distressed dog with food and water. That’s the least I could do since I realized upon trying it again, that I cannot go back to the previous body. 

 I used my new found ability to enter different people. Mainly people with access to money. 

 I once accidentally switched places with a wanted man. Upon evading police, I made eye contact with a kid at the bus stop. The scene consisted of an old man being dragged away calling for his mother. Who held my hand tightly as she walked away with me. She took me to her job, and it turned out that she worked for someone who was close to the president. This was a campaign office. I had an idea. I looked for a higher up, someone who had close contact. 

Found her. A news pundit. There was an interview with the president and I was to arrange it. 

Let’s just say the pundit went crazy claiming she was the president, and the interview had to be canceled.

 Being the president was insane. All the secrets I had access to, and the power that I had. I’d leave eventually. After I have some fun of course. 

 One thing I noticed, was that the birthmark on my eye never left. It carried on to all bodies I’ve taken. I didn’t think much of it. Just shrugged it off and carried on.

 I was to meet with a few veterans. One in particular was an elderly man. He was weak and in a wheel chair. When I went over to shake his hand, he asked me to come closer and said he wanted to get a good look at me since he was going blind. 

 I then noticed he has the same exact birthmark as me. Just then, I saw a flash of light, a loud whooshing sound. Next thing I knew,I was looking at a blurry figure. Standing over me.

 “I’m sorry my son.” He stated. 

 “I had to leave that body as soon as possible because their vision is deteriorating due to the cancer.

“D’ dad?” I asked in a weak and shaken voice.

“No, it’s mom. Your father is in the mental hospital. I just needed access to his inheritance. Don’t worry, your granddaughter will take good care of you after the surgery tomorrow to remove the affected eye. You already signed for it. I’ll take it from here”
