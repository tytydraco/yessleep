I would give an account of how long I’ve been here except I have no idea. Time isn’t right here, nor is anything else.



The large office space with dozens of cubicles. There’s always someone typing, someone on the phone. The clicking of keyboards occasionally mixed with the sound of hushed conversation.



I know I haven’t always been here. I can remember the outside world, and so can everyone else. But we never leave. There is no time in this place, no end of shift, no clock out.



That’s not to say there are no clocks; there are. They are just meaningless. The ones mounted on the far wall don't even have numbers; the hands just tick around empty spaces.



The computers aren’t any better. The numbers displayed are utterly meaningless and random. Sometimes, never changing, other times changing too fast to process.



We do get breaks, though. I couldn’t tell you how we know when it’s time except that it stops being work time. Then we get to do something else. We don’t have many options. A bathroom break is always a good option. Sometimes, if you go to the breakroom, you can find something to eat in a container with your name on it in the fridge. There are, of course, the vending machines. Someone always has spare change, and sometimes I do.



Most people just stand there awkwardly, making small talk until it’s time to go back to work. Stretching out their stiff legs and trying to be a living animal for a little while.



We don’t have to work. We have the whole internet available to us. The old folk often sneakily play solitaire when they think no one is looking. Some watch TV. One younger man even figured out how to download video games. Though no one besides him is ever online at all. We all have our distractions.



Eventually, though, you do find yourself working. Crossing I’s and dotting T’s, sometimes you get to draw a little line and make an L. Some people work with numbers instead. Adding up random numbers into totals only to have to do it all over again, but backwards.



Things aren’t by any means terrible. We never get sleepy, and when we start getting tired, we get a break. But it’s just… never-ending. There’s nothing to truly do, no way for us to leave. I don’t even know if there are people out there to read this post. Anyone else in the office reading this, do say “Hello.”



All the other doors just lead to more office space with more cubicles. There’s no way to tell the time. There are no windows anywhere. No stairs or elevators. Just more of this place. Every cubicle is a little different, a hint of humanity in this bland, liminal, unending space. Some are perfectly normal, others are unfashionably bizarre. Some are simply horrifying.



I haven’t dared to venture too far. I don't want to get lost and lose my cubicle. It’s the only personalized thing I have here. A photo of my family, a pack of gum that always seems to be full, and a stress ball that always comes back no matter how far I throw it.



I’ve tried doing everything else to pass the time. One can only stare at a computer for so long. But there just isn’t anything to do. Time only stays still as long as you observe it.



I spent an eternity drawing a large mural with pens. Then I blinked, and it was gone. We tried playing office games once, but everyone had to blink eventually, and then everything just went back to how it was. It’s like every piece of this space is its own time, all jumbled together inside a blender. We can only hold spaces together for so long before they fly apart. Except there doesn’t seem to be an end.



There are a few phone chargers we pass around. But no one outside of the office ever responds to texts or calls. I hope my family is well. It’s either been lifetimes since I’ve seen them or maybe simply moments. None of it means anything here.



Then there are the managers. Those pulsing masses of incandescent flesh are best avoided. No one is really sure what they want. But they always ensure we get some work done.



Really, we are left to our own regard. There’s always something to do, but never something to be done. There’s no meaning or purpose to what we do. No matter how much we invent, experiment with or theorize, we still just end up doing the same unimportant thing for eternity. There are always more forums to sign, more coffee to refill, and more typos to correct.



At least until the next break.
