I want to share something that happened tonight involving my wife Helen and our dog Jester. I will attempt to, as best as I can recollect, recount the exact series of events that transpired and the words said tonight. It’s still the same night, though a few hours later it’s now 10:36. I can hear my wife still showering. I’m going to try to get this all down before she gets out. 



Starting from when I finished cooking dinner, pan seared chicken thighs seasoned with peppers and five spice, I first took a plate to my wife in her office, a separate room down the hall. She works from home with often inconsistent and sporadic hours. Tonight there was a problem with a policy her agency was quoting for a business or something like that, and she took dinner working. I took my plate to the couch and started a movie. In his elegant timing we were just getting out of the opening credits when Jester, a collie and Australian shepherd mix, started whining and staring at me in the way that indicated “Take me out now or I will pee myself on this carpet”. He unfortunately does not bluff. So I opened the back door and sent him out. 

I returned to my movie and ate my dinner quickly and was enjoying it, right about leading into the third act when I heard some frantic scratching at the back door. My mistake, I don’t usually feel too bad about leaving Jester outside since I think he prefers it anyways, but it is a winter night tonight and it is freezing and windy outside, I felt a pang of guilt. I returned him to warmth. 



I finished my movie. Then I got up trying not to trip on Jester who chose to sleep in a high traffic area, and walked to the kitchen to drop off my plate and utensils in the sink. From the sink you can see down through the laundry room to the door that leads to the backyard. As my eyes raise up and I focus my vision on that back door. I saw it was wide open. My wife is standing there facing out into the dark yard. Was it darker than usual? It couldn’t be, but somehow I feel normally you can still make out the lawn chairs or even that old metal shed from here, even on a dark night just with the excess of light from the house. But somehow, somehow it seemed like my vision couldn’t penetrate past the doorway. I know it wasn’t any darker, it just has to be my current mindset coloring my memory.



After a moment longer, Jester trots in through the doorway. He shakes his cold fur. I remember that moment like it was in slow motion. He tilts his head up and to the side to Helen, and offers a thankful look. Then from that position his head turns and lands directly on me. I don’t know how to say it but there were no other moments between: he just went from her then turned straight down all the way back in the kitchen to my eyes. And I felt something I had never felt from Jester before; a cold chill that ran down my spine making my hair stand up, like a gust of cold wind had come in with him and gone straight to me. 



I stood there in shock, not able to do anything as I knew with dreaded certainty that Jester was sleeping in the living room. There was no way he could have gone past me and gotten outside then be brought back in. There just was no way, no other route to the yard, not enough time had even passed to make that trek. 



Helen and this new Jester walked through the laundry room and into the kitchen. 

I stared in probably obvious shock and confusion. Helen was smiling until she saw my expression and her face went to concern. 

“What’s wrong baby?”

“I..I..Follow me”

I took her by the hand, and carefully pulled her away as New Jester drank from the dog bowl. As we went down the hallway that rounded a corner and opened up into the living room I was running through the possibilities. After a few scenarios I decided the most likely had to be that I somehow just imagined Jester with me and that I must have stepped over nothing or maybe one of his stuffed animals and Helen was about to think I was being a fool and probably spooked myself with a horror movie. Sadly it would not be the first time that a horror movie had me leading Helen by the hand to get her opinion on an alarming looking tree outside or a strange noise. 



The initial feeling was a trivial relief then a sinking, drowning fear, as we came around the corner into the living room and saw Jester sleeping proving I wasn’t imagining things, but meant that something much much stranger was happening. 

I pointed wordlessly at Jester. 

I watched Helen’s face as she digested what she saw. From where we stood you could turn to see the kitchen where New Jester was still messily lapping up water. Helen’s face turned back and forth from one to the other as I began to form a sentence. 

“I brought him inside about thirty minutes ago, he’s been with me since. Who is that?”

She shook her head in confusion. 

After a quiet moment I attempted to form a sentence. 

“You must have just let in a stray”

“That’s not possible.”

“It has to be”

“No, because Jester hasn’t left my sight for longer than an hour”

I turned to her in confusion.

“What do you mean, you just let him back in.”

“Yes, but you must have missed it but while he was outside I was with him the whole time; I was going outside and he followed me, always by my side then I came back in. Which I guess is when you were in the kitchen.”

I was trying to put this time table together in my head. 

“Wait right after dinner was finished after a little ways into the movie. Jester needed to go outside. So I let him out-”

“Yes and I went to the kitchen to put my plate in the sink, and I heard him scratching on the door. I knew you must have gotten invested in the movie and forgot him outside so *I* let him in. And he followed me to the office and I shut the door and that's where he was until he followed me out to the shed.”

That couldn’t be possible but when I ran through it I knew it fit in with my side of events. And was it possible that he seemed less cold or annoyed when I let him in than he normally when I forget him outside? It’s possible, but it could also just be doubt leaking into my memory.



I tried to find the logic again. We were letting the novelty of this strangeness distract us.

“Okay, let’s calm down. One of them is Jester and has his tags and the other is a stray that got into our yard. It doesn’t really matter who brought it in. Let's just get the wrong one on its way.”

Helen gave me a reassuring nod that suggested she also found relief in a simple solution. 

“Let’s check the one I brought in first,” I said.



Even as we approached the sleepy dog I began to relax as I could see his faded red collar with the little strawberries on it. Just for the sake of thoroughness I checked the tag too and it was our boy.



Then we returned to the kitchen.

My blood went cold.



I could see from the entrance a faded red color with a design of little red shapes around its neck. 

We continued forward, but I’ll admit I stopped a few feet short. My legs felt so heavy, I couldn't get any closer. 

It was Helen who approached him and checked the tags. 

“Jester” she reported. 

I nodded, I knew it would say that. 

This Jester came up to me, wagging its tail and smiling up at me, in the exact way that he always does. 

He was identical. In every way. It was impossibly accurate. 

For a moment I began to humor the next most likely situation, that perhaps it was some strange plot by a neighbor or someone to try to dress up a stray as Jester to steal him from us? It was absurd, but also felt like the next most likely scenario. Could it be a prank? Sure, but that would be practically as impossible and even less rewarding than the theft idea. Though, Jester was a mix we got at a shelter with a coupon from the local paper, so he was far from being a designer dog that was worth anything. Why anyone would want to steal him, beyond for his kind demeanor, I don't know.



Before I could think any more about it there was movement in the corner of my vision. I looked to see my Jester coming around the corner from the living room. He was moving groggily, probably intrigued by the sounds of our voices in the other room. As soon as he had come fully around the corner and saw the other dog he stopped completely. He stared at it. At the same time the Jester nearest me saw him and froze. 



They stared at each other in a bizarre standoff where their posture and the details of their appearance were reflected so perfectly it each was facing into a mirror. Then at the same time they started barking and growling.



Instinctively my hand shot to grab the nearest one by the collar. He pulled against me trying to get to his copy. 



“Grab the other one!” I cried out to Helen. I still didn’t know what was happening at all but I didn’t think them fighting would make things less complicated. A thought crossed my mind of what if they started to fight; wrestling and tumbling over each other and I lost track for a moment which was which. It would be like a cruel version of the shell game. I would lose all of the meager information I had. At the least we needed to keep them apart to maintain that. 



Helen hesitated by me for a moment.

“I got this one, grab the other!”

She ran and grabbed him by the collar. 

We held them between our legs trying to restrict their movement. 

I had a poor grip on this one because I had grabbed it where the tags were not just the fabric of the collar which made it much harder to hold tightly without the tags digging into my hand. 

So I used both my hands to move the collar around for a better grip when the tag caught the light in just the right way to flash up to me. 

Something felt off.

Logically this wasn’t exactly the best time to check; I could see Helen struggling on her end, but I couldn’t help myself from the possibility of learning anything more. 

I bent down and turned the tag again to catch the tag in the light. 

It looked the same…almost. I couldn’t place it. It had all the information that his collar has, my phone number, our address, and his name “Jest-” I stopped.

Leaning even closer I had to read it again. 

It ALMOST read as “Jester”. But it didn't. There was something wrong with the “r”, like the letter had been in the sun too long and softened. It looked more like a “c” now. “Jestec”

Had there only been one dog in my house that looked exactly like the dog that had lived there for five years I wouldn’t have thought more of it than just a peculiar detail. But with the context of two Jesters, I was confident that if the letter had always looked like that I would have misread it as a ”c” before and I never had. 

“It’s this one. It’s the fake…” 

“How do you know?”

“The name…”

“I read it, it says Jester” 

“Yes but the ‘r’ is messed up…” 

Later on I realized that all the letters had that same sense of melt and decay, just not as prevalent as to make them look like a different letter. 

All of a sudden, I felt the strain on my arms increasing. 

Then in my legs and core.

It was getting harder to hold this…this animal back. 

And it wasn’t like he was suddenly trying harder. Actually, if anything, it looked like he was trying less hard, he was almost just walking forward now. But my feet were slipping. I was having to adjust my footing to avoid falling over and losing control completely. 

Then the collar got tighter. And tighter. I felt the collar shrinking on my fingers, the fabric digging into my skin. 

Or was its neck getting bigger. 

“What the fuck…”

Quickly I realized that my fingers were getting stuck and I had a surging fear that any longer and I wouldn’t be able to remove them.  I didn’t like the idea of letting this thing loose, and if it was somehow actually getting bigger in its collar then I had no idea how dangerous it would be.  

Although it felt like my window for getting my fingers back was closing, I took a moment to scan the room. Then I remembered the 8in cooking knife I used for dinner. I couldn’t see it but I knew it was somewhere in the sink. 

The moment before I let go I realized too that it wasn’t pulling on me any longer, it was simply standing still, but poised to fight. 

“I’m going to let go, watch out for a second and run if you need” 

My wife gave me a confused look but there seemed to be understanding and trust behind her eyes. I let go and lunged for the sink. The knife was not initially visible, there were plates and utensils stacked up on top of where I believed the knife to be. 

I looked back at the creature I just let go. My eyes froze on it.

It had turned to face me. The edges of its mouth pulled back and twisted in a way I have never seen a dog do before. Forming a cruel smile. It was distinctly a human-like grin. All at once, I was overcome as this wave of hate and malice washed over me. Its eyes seemed to grow darker and bead into black glass, as it stared at me. A growl began, far too deep in its throat. 

I turned back to the sink and dug frantically, all while waiting for teeth to bury themselves into my leg or claws to slash me.

 

Finally the wide metal of the blade flashed before me. I grabbed the handle and spun around. 

The creature that was *not* Jester was staring at me. 



At eye-level. 



It was so much bigger but also thinner. I don’t know how to describe what I saw before me. My eyes didn’t seem to understand the shapes of its body, the twists of its obviously powerful musculature, but also its thin-almost hollow, weak, emaciated frame. I remember a moment of feeling an abject fear of its immense power but at the same time a pity or concern that it was so weak that it may just collapse from hunger and exhaustion. 

Those’re the last thoughts I remember before my arm with the knife began moving wildly. Plunging and slashing. Blood splattered and sprayed, some on my face. It was cold. Cold blood. It was colder than ice. It stung my cheeks. 

I had a vague sense of a heavy weight collapsing before me and crashing into the ground. Followed by my arm swinging into nothing. 

“MARK”

I snapped out of my trance and looked to Helen. For a moment I was wondering what she wanted, before it all came back to me. By the tone of her voice I’m pretty sure she had said it a few times. 



That was a couple hours ago. I never even got a good look at the thing. By the time I looked at the ground at what I had hacked and slashed it was basically only a soft melting mound, steaming an acrid vapor. In another thirty minutes it was entirely gone, into that vapor. We watched it the whole time.



Then we both went to lay down on the bed saying nothing. The blood or whatever that freezing ichor was that splashed on me had also dissipated into the air. We laid on the bed, me holding her close to me, my vision softly focused on her back. My eyes traced the lines and marks on her skin; she has a beautiful floral tattoo with a tiger on her back. As my eyes followed the masterfully wrought details I got lost for a moment. I became a little more conscious for a moment. I don’t know why but I started focusing on the stripes of the tiger, and they felt wrong. I’ve counted them many times, not in the way that I remembered the number of them but I would look at them one at a time from its head to its tail like a sort of meditation before bed nearly every night. While I didn’t know the exact number, it felt like there was one too many. I’m not sure where. I don’t think it even seemed like one was splitting the area between two stripes, like it was crammed in. They all felt properly spaced but like maybe an additional one had been added then the negative space was averaged out between them. I felt my heart beating faster and faster. I pulled my torso away, trying to be gentle so she didn’t feel it. 



It made no sense to me. I started to feel my breathing speeding up. Image of that thing crowded my mind, its height, its withered but terrifying body, that guttural growl. I thought of Helen’s body contorting into that thing. No it would be so much worse. My blood felt cold in my body picturing that thing forming in my bed so close to me. My mind jumped to that initial flash of metal in the sink. Remembering the sensation of the handle in my hand brought a feeling of safety that slowed my breathing. I needed to be nearer to it. I stood up and told her I was going to the kitchen to get some water. Remembering how I would normally act in this moment; I asked her if she wanted some. 

“No thanks baby, I’m going to take a shower now.”

I nodded. I began to turn away-

“I love you”

I looked back at her. At her eyes. 

I knew those eyes. I knew that voice. Those are the eyes I must have spent hours memorizing, every little stroke of brown and black in the iris. I recognized the sound in her voice when she was saying she loved me and trying not to cry. I snapped back to where I was. I saw my wife lying there. 

“I love you too”

\-

I can hear the shower turning off. There’s probably only a few more minutes before she’s ready for bed. I’ve decided I’m going to lay down in bed. I’m tired and what I want most is to spend a night holding my wife.
