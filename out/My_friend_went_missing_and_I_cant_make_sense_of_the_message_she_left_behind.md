*Hopefully this is the right place for this, because I have no idea what else to do. The police are useless. No one I’ve talked to takes me seriously. I know this story sounds impossible but SOMETHING happened to my brother and my friend and I need to figure out what it was and how to get them back, I am so scared something horrible has happened to them.* 

*The cops found this typed up on Steph’s phone and asked me if I could explain it. (I can’t.) It looks like she was trying to post it here but couldn’t get enough of a signal for it to go through. I’m posting it now to see if anyone can actually help, because I can’t make any sense of it.* 

*I haven’t changed a thing, I even left the typos in case I missed something important. Steph didn’t mention the name of the town and I won’t either because I don’t think anyone should go looking for it. I certainly won’t be going back any time soon, not unless I have to.*

*Please, just read, and help if you can.*

\*\*\*\*

I’m sorry for any typos or if I leave stuff out, I’m trying to make this make sense but I don’t have long and it’s getting hard to type. I hope somebody can tell me what’s going on and how to stop it, I'm so fucking scared and I don't know what to do.

I’m in this cabin in the mountains in Pennsylvania, I don’t even know what this fuckign place is called, I just followed my friend’s directions, please just help me.

I’m supposed to be dogsitting for my friend’s brother but shit started going wrong pretty much immediately.

My friend Amy, we’re 26 now but we’ve known each other since sixth grade, she knew I was strapped for cash and she let me know her brother needed a dog sitter this weekend. I’m not really a dog person–there was an incident when I was a kid, I still have the scar to prove it, it took me for-fucking-ever to mostly move past it–but I need the money. ANd I won’t lie, I’ve always kind of had a crush on her brother, so I jumped at the chance to get his number and maybe an in with him.

WHat she failed to tell me is that her brother, jason, lived in a creepy-ass cabin in the middle of the creepy-ass woods in the creepy-ass mountains. I knww it was rural, she’d said as much before, but I figured he was at least near a town of some kind. Nope. Miles from anything that could remotely be called a town. I probably should have guessed when Amy sent me typed-up directions instead of just giving me an address to plug into Google Maps, but I was toorelieved about the job and didn’t ask questions.

I’d been trundling along a dirt road for over an hour, maybe two, wincing every time I hit an unavoidable pothole in my crappy old car, before it happened. It was dark as hell, I couldn’t see more than  ten feet in front of me even with my highbeams on–no streetlights, and the trees blocked every last scrap of moonlight.

Anyway. I was creeping along, trying not to do any permanent damage to my car. I was munching on some of the french fries I’d picked up before I got off the highway–and thank god, since I doubted any pizza place would deliver out here, and I was too wiped to cook for myself.

I had rolled a window down since my AC was on the fritz and the weather was weirdly hot for this time of year. I always thought of the woods as quiet, butt he noise was ungodly–the crickets  were absolutely shrieking, to the point where I couldn’t hear half of what was bening said on the podcast I was listening to. It was honestly starting to creep me out, but I couldn’t put the window up or I’d boil to death in the car. 

Then I heard what sounded like a scream – a *human* scream – and hit the breaks. I realized pretty quickly it couldn;t be a person, not this far out in the wilderness, and on what must be Jason’s private property. I knew some animals could make a sound like that. A fox? A mountain lion? Whatever it was, I didn’t want to be anywhere near it. I hit the gas again.

Something streaked across the road in front of me and I slammed on the breaks and swerved, almost careening off the road in the process.

I threw the car into park, my heart pounding, hacking up the french fry I’d been chewing.

When I’d finally coughed it up and caught my breath, I heard the barking. I looked out, and there was a dog on the side of the road, barking and growling, hackles raised. It had a collar on, so it was clearly someone’s pet, not anything wild.

I was too scared to get out of the car in case the dog decided to lunge at me, so I rolled the window up until it was only open a crack and whsitled. It took a few tries, but eventually the dog turned to look at me.

Almost instantly, its demeanor changed. Ears went back, tail tucked between its legs, it crawled over to my car, jumping up and scratching at the window to be let in.

That’s when I saw the tag–it had the dog’s name, BARNEY, printed on it, alogn with the owner’s phone number. This was Jason’s dog.

I looked into the trees, wondering what he’d been barking at. Probably whatever I’d heard screaming. I needed to get out of here, with Barney.

I unbuckles myself, reached back and threw open the back door. Barney leapt in, panting and shaking, and I slammed the door shut.

The dog whipped around to look at me, and I swear for a second he looked ready to attack. But he sniffed my hand and calmed down again, laying down on the back seat. I turned and took off again, hands shaking. 

I turned a corner and saw Jason’s house. On top I saw the silhouette of what appeared to be a large fallen tree limb with gnarled branches sticking out in every direction. But the house was in a large clearing, no trees nearby. It wasn’t until I pulled up closer to the house that I relized what it was.

A mass of antenndas and satellite dishes covering basically the whole top of the house, with cables stretched and twisted between them to form one haphazard mass, making the whole thing look like the floor of an untamed jungle.

What the FUCK could that be for? Was that how jason had an internet connection out here? Or was he losing his mind from the isolation and building his own techie version of the Sarah Winchester house at the instructions of the ghosts in his head? Can’t say I’d blame him if he was, being out here by himself.

All the lights were on, and I could see his car parked around the side of the cabin. ANd, right in front of me, I saw the front door open wide.

Immediately, a million different horrifyign scenarios run through my mind–Did Jason have some kind of terrible accident? A heart attack? And run from the house for help? Did someone break in? Could that have been him screaming in the trees?

I checked my phone–no bars out here. I knew Jason must have wifi because he worked remotely from up here , but it must not extend outside.

I glanced at my mirror. Barney was quiet and still now, but his eyes were wide open, watching me intently.

Sighing, I got out of the car, walked up to the porch. I glanced through the open door, standing way back–everything looked okay from out here. I took one tentative step over the threshold. 

Still nothing out of place. No signs of a struggle. The furniture was all upright and where it should be. Jason’s big-screen TV and expensive looking speakers were still there and his car keys sat on the dining room table so I doubted it was burglars. I was still fucking freaked though.

Next to the fireplace, a glass-front cabinet contained a number of rifles. I thought having one might make me feel safer, but I had no idea how to use one,or even where Jason kept ammunition, so they were useless to me. Then my eyes moved to the fireplace, where two axes were mounted over the mantle. 

Perfect.

I took one down–it was heavier than I expected, but it would have to do.

I went from room to room quietly as I could, but everything looked normal.

Finally, I made my to Jason’s office. My heart was practically beating through my chest now. I turned the knob and pushed it open half an inch. I used both hands to hold the ax over my head, ready to strike, then kicked the door open and jumped back.

The room was pitch black, eprfectly dark. Somehow the light from the hallway didn’t seem to seep in there at all. Someone could be hiding out in there and I’d have no way of knowing. I tried to think what to do.

“Hey!” I said. “The cops are on their way, so you better not do anything stupid. Just…stay back. Or you’re in deep shit.”

My voice sounded high-pitched and shaky, not intimidating like I’d hoped. I inched forward and, against my better judgment, reached inside the doorframe to search for a light switch, holding the ax awkwardly in my other hand. Any second I expected something to reach out and grab me and yank me into the yawning black.

But it didn’t. I found the light, switched it on, d.

The light, first of all, was weird. Dense and orange-brown, so that I could barely see even with it on.

Inside the room, there was no one. But this place was weird as shit. I’d expected a desk, a chair, a computer–normal office stuff. There were a bunch of computer monitor, maybe a dozen? More? On a series of folding tables that wrapped around the room. Under the tables, a bunch of processors were stacked horizontally on top of one another, basically as many as could physically fit down there, and everything was connected with a tangle of cords and wires, some of which ran up the wall and into the ceiling. One long cord  stretched out of this mess and connected to a cube sitting in the center of the room on the floor.

Nothing appeared to be on, but I could hear a dull buzzing, so maybe it was all just asleep?

Setting down the ax outside the door, I took a few steps inside. I assumed the cube thing controlled it all, so I kneeled down to look at it. There were no buttons or anything obvious to press. Maybe it worked like a tackpad? I reached out for it, and a pins-and-needles sensation started in my fingertips. I guess I should have stopped then, but…well, I didn’t.

I touched it with the tips of my fingers.

Everything awoke at once.

A screeching sound shot out from behind the far wall of processors, nearly deafening me before I could clap my hands over my ears. 

The monitors–somehow they turned blacker, a darker dark that made my eyes ache, before rows and rows of green text scrolled rapidly down each of the screens. As far as I could tell, it looked like just random symbols–not any lnguage I recognized.

I crept closer to get a better look, and then all of it stopped–silence crashed down over me, and the screens went blank.

Cringing, I gave the cube a few tentative pokes, but nothing happened this time. Even the buzzing had quieted. My fingers still felt like they were vibrating, though.

What the *fuck*?

I rose to my feet with difficulty, as my legs were wobbling beneath me. I shook my hand in a futile attempt to get rid of that vibrating feeling, then pulled out my phone.

My signal was strong here, so tried to call Jason, but my calls wouldn’t connect. I don’t mean it went straight to voicemail–I mean it made this horrible screechy sound that I guess means the number has been disconnected. For a moment, I thought the computers had turned back on–but no. It was just my phone.

I tried texting him too, but those bounced right back.

So I called Amy.

“Hey, Steph! Did you get there okay?”

“Well, yes, but–I think something’s wrong. Jason’s not here.”

“What do you mean?” asked Amy.

“I mean, I drove up here, Barney was out running loose, and the cabin door was wide open, but no Jason inside.”

A long pause. “Are you sure?”

“Amy, I checked the whole place. He’s gone. Nothing’s out of place, I don’t think he was hurt or anything, but he’s not here.”

“Did you call him.”

“I can’t get through.”

“Okay. Okay. I’ll call the friends he’s supposed to meet up with, maybe he’s with them.”

“I think maybe I should call the police.”

“I don’t–”

She stopped suddenly.

“Amy?”

No response. I checked my phone–the call had been cut off. No signal. *Great.*

I walked out of the office to check on Barney, and the office door slammed shut behind me. I screamed and fell to the floor. I lay there for a long time, too scared to look behind me.

Finally, I stood up and tried the door–but it was firmly locked. I leaned my full weight into it but it wouldn’t budge. 

I should’ve left. I know that. But slowly, methodically, I convinced myself that everything had a logical explanation. Jason had left the house in a hurry because there’d been an emergency. Whatever was fucking up the signal on my phoen must’ve fucked his too, that’s why he hadn’t called or texted. His car was here, but–well, maybe he had a second one? Or a motorcycle or something? Or someone picked him up?

The office–well, that was weird. Maybe Jaosn was running some kind of experiment. That would explain the shit on the roof too. Or maybe I was right earlier and he was kind of losing it, being all alone up here. 

And the door–the wind must’ve blown it shut. But there had been no window in there…fuck it. The AC must have switched on, blown the door shut, and jammed it somehow.

I calmed a little and went to call Amy back–but I had no service. Oh well. Nothing I could do about it now.

Eventually, I explained away all of it. Part of me was still scared, but what was I going to do? Runaway from here, run from nothing and no one?

I went out to the car to collect Barney and my things, looking around me for any kind of threat. I had to drag the dog back to the house–he kept staring and growling at the treeline. Had the mountain lion or whatever followed us back? This whole thing was really unnerving, and I started second guessing my decision to stay, but I didn’t want to wind my way back down the mountain in the pitch dark with a pissed off dog in tow. I’d stay here til morning, nd leave then if I needed. Maybe by then, Amy would have figured out that Jason is fine. Maybe the dog ould be back to normal. Maybe this gig wouldn’t be a total shitshow.

I shook my hand again–that pins and needles feeling just would not subside–and then I fed the dog, poured myself a LARGE glass of the wine I’d brought, and sat down to watch some TV and finish my french fries.

The cable up here was not much better than the cell service, it turned out. The signal was fuzzy and kept cutting out. Finally, I gave up and rummaged through the stacks of DVDs next to the couch. He had almost nothing I liked (almost all thrillers and horror–how he managed to watch these things up here all by himself I do NOT understand), but I found some sci fi thing that didn’t seem too scary, so I popped it into the DVD player and sat down to watch it.

I fell asleep almost instantly.

I woke to the sound of Barney growling. I sat bolt upright and saw him standing at the door, baring his teeth, ready to attack.

“Oh, buddy, not again.”

I stood up and looked out the window–nothing. Just trees and dark. Barney had quieted down again.

I realized I need to let the dog out before bed. I clipped on his collar and leash and started to walk outside–but grabbed the ax on my way out. Just in case.

Nothing happened to us. Barney did not so much as glance up at the trees, just did his business and went back inside. Whatever had been stalking us must have given up.

I turned off the movie and went to brush my teeth, feeling much more relaxed than I had just a few minutes ago. If it weren’t for the fucking vibrating–it had spread to the fingers on my other hand now–I’d have felt completely at peace.

When I came our of the bathroom,  i noticed something on the floor that I hadn’t seen before.

It was a piece of paper–like, torn off from a paper bag–with a few words scrawled on it in messy handwriting. *Sorry, have to go*

I stared at it, confused for a moment, and then suddenly overcome with rage. Sorry? Have to go? Was Jason serious?? He couldn’t have at least closed the door behind him and sent me a text?

I snatched the paper off the ground. It was clearly torn off and written in a rush. Maybe he’d had an emergency and had no time to think things through. But then why was his car still here? WHo knew. Who fucking CARED. I crumpled up the note and hurled it at the trashcan across the room.

Right at that moment, Barney went ballistic.

“FUCKING DOG.”

I stormed out to the living room to see what the hell he was up to now. He was barking at…the closet.

The coat closet, to the right of the fireplace.

What the FUCK.

I approached the dog, my sense of dread growing stronger by the second. I picked up the ax I’d set down earlier, just in case.

I reached for the door handle. Barney backed away, tail between his legs. I pulled the door open.

Nothing. Totally normal closet. SOme coats hanging up, a pair of muddy boots on the floor. The vibrating in my hands was getting worse though.

but wait.

Back in that corner.

What?

The wall shouldn’t extend that far. It just shouldn’t. It would cut off the hallway on the other side. 

What the fuck?

I stepped inside and was instantly hit with a wave of nausea so severe it brought me to my knees. When I was bent down, I saw further back into the far corner, past the coats.

Black. Deep, dark, soul-sucking black. I opened my mouth to scream but nothing came out.

A growl. I whipped around, fighting the urge to puke. Barney stood a few feet back from the door, poised to attack, snarling, hackles all the way up from neck to tail.

“Woah..” I said, trying to sound calm. “It’s okay, buddy–”

He lunged, coming straight at me. Without thinking, I reached forward and slammed the door shut.

Silence.

More silence.

“Barney?”

I reached for the handle.

It wasn’t there. I felt around for it, but it was nowhere. The doorframe was gone too.

No. No.

I felt around frantically, hoping I’d just stepped to the side a little with out noticing, I felt all along the wall, but–nothing.

I let out a terrified sob.

Then

THEN

On the back of my neck

A breath.

I screamed and fell and just. 

Kept.

Falling.

-

-

-

I awoke in perfect darkness.

The ground was cold and hard, the air perfectly still.

I sat up, expecting pain, but I felt fine. Except for those fucking pins and needles.

I looked around helplessly, eyes wide open but unseeing in the vast black.

Then I felt something hard digging into my hip.

My phone–I still had my phone!

I yanked it out, and it was mercifully unbroken and still partially charged.

But the image on the screen was fucked up. It was like someone had shattered it and shoved the pieces haphazardly back together. It had never seen it do that before. I had never seen *any* phone do that before.

I touched the screen, right in the center, and it started screaming.

White noise, shrieking at me, like the phone was alive and in agony. On the screen, circles rippled frantically away from my thumb as though trying to escape.

I dropped the phone, and the noise stopped. And immediately, I regretted it.

Getting that phone to work might be my only way out. Or maybe I’d find a way out and need to call for help. I knelt down and felt around the ground by my feet. After a minute, I started to panic that it had bounced away, but no–there it was. I tucked it back into my pocket.

When I stood, my hand brushed something solid, and I jerked back–hitting a wall behind me. A wall. So this place wasn’t endless.

I reached out in front of me took a few steps forward, and–yes, another wall. To my right–a wall.

, I reached out to my left, took a few steps.

Nothing. That way was open. Maybe there was a way out of here.

A few more steps and–my toe bumped something solid, heavy. I bent down, felt around with my hand–the ax. It had come with me too. I gripped it tight and stood.

I walked a bit further, shuffling because I was still blind. I would bump the left wall, then try to straighten out, then shffle for a bit longer and bump the right wall. It was clear before long that this was a tunnel.

I don’t know how long I continued like that, in the dark. It felt endless. And it was getting colder, colder all the time. I was constantly terrified that I would suddenly drop off a cliff, or run into something dangerous, or find the end of this place and realize that I was truly trapped.

And then–a light up ahead.

More like a glow than a bright light, like the sun just starting to peak up over the horizon.

I quickened my pace, bashing into the walls a couple of times. Colder and colder.

As I got closer to the light, I realized it wasn’t a single point.

The light was coming from distinct points on either side of the tunnel. I was too far to say for sure, but I thought they looked like doorways.

As I got closer, my suspicion was confirmed. Doorways, staggered along both sides of the tunnel, harsh glowing light spilling from each of them.

I approached the first one, shivering now.

I looked through the doorway and felt the hope drain from me.

It was…static. Like on a TV. White and glowy and fuzzy, a buzzing sound in the background. If I looked hard enough, I thought I could see movement behind it, but that could’ve just been my imagination, or my eyes playing tricks after so long in the dark. 

The vibrating in my hands was stronger here.

I made my way to the next one,  more of the same.

Then my phone began to vibrate in my pocket. I yanked it out,praying that someone was calling, someone who could help.

But no. It was just more ripples, though this time it was happening without me touching the screen. The white noise was back, but quieter, matching the tone of the doorways. I put the phone back in my pocket.

I took one tentative step toward the door, then another. I reached a hand out toward it, but as my fingers inched forward, an overwhelming sense of dread washed over me. I tried to push through it, but then the static did that rippling thing and it pushed back. It was like it was trying to repel me. Finally, when I couldn’t take it anymore, I yanked my arm back.

 I dropped to the ground and started to cry, despair weighing me down. There was no way out. I sobbed and sobbed until I wore myself out, and then I just laid there, staring up at nothing.

The dread feeling slowly faded. I stood up and looked further down the tunnel. There were doors as far as I could see, alternating on either side. They all appeared to frame the same static as the first one.

There was nothing else I could do. I kept walking.

At first, I looked closely at each doorway, trying to see if I could glean any meaning from them. But after a while, I grew tired of it and gave up. I kept my gaze forward and trudged along for I don’t know how long, until my legs started to ache with the effort. 

But then.

I noticed shapes in the static. At first I thought I was imagning it–that I’d spent too long in the dark and my mind was inventing things for me to see. But then the shapes were too defined to dismiss. 

I couldn’t make out what they were doing, but there were definitely people moving around in there.

I tried to call to them, but they didn’t seem to notice. I walked closer to one of them, hoping this time I might make it through, but the dread and the static pushed me back again.

And then I could hear them. Almost imperceptible at first, but growing just a bit louder at each doorway.

And then I could see scenes playing out. 

A man and a woman, screaming at each other, their faces inches apart. I ducked away instinctively, as though any second they might turn on me.

A creature–a dog?--lunging at the doorway. That one made me jump back in terror, fearing for a second that it might be able to pass through.

It didn’t though. It just disappeared and started over again a moment later.

And the next one–a little girl, sitting on the ground, hunched over herself, shaking. It took me a second to realize she was crying. Sobbing. I felt strangely connected to her, like I could feel what she was feeling.

I didn’t have to get close this time. The dread slammed into me, and I cried out. 

“H-hello?” I said to the girl. “Can you hear me?”

she just kept crying. She had no idea I was there. 

I collapsed,exhausted. How long had I been down here? Minutes? Hours? 

I couldn’t keep going, but I coldn’t sleep when I felt like this. I used the last of my remaining energy to crawl a little further, so I was an equal distance from the last door and the next.

The dread wasn’t gone here, but it was bearable. In any case, it weighed me to the spot–I couldn’t have moved if I wanted to. I shut my eyes.

I shot up to my feet in an instant, a scream reverberating through my head. I had slept–no idea how long–but this wasn’t a dream. It was real, and it wasn’t mufled like the doorway sounds.

It stopped.

I had no idea which direction it had come from. I stopped and listened closely, but there was nothing now. 

My heart was pounding, fear and adrenaline pumping through me, and I knew I wasn’t going back to sleep. I took up my journey again, faster now.

The blurry scenes continued. The dread pressed in on me, forcing me to the middle of the tunnel. And as I walked and walked, glancing now an then at the doorways, I noticed something about the scnes.

Maybe it was because they were becoming clearer or because I’d been in here among them for so long, but…they were familiar.

I hadn’t wanted to admit it at the time. I couldn’t think clearly anyway. But that little girl–I knew her. I *was* her. And I remembered that moment. I’d just come home from school and my mom had sat me down, stony-faced, and told me that our cat had died. I had cried all night and the next day, and for days after she died

And the two people arguing–I couldn’t see them clearly,  ut I’m almost certain they were my parents. They’d had so many screaming matches just like that before…before we left.

The neighbor’s dog, slipping his leash and attacking me. I still had that scar on my right arm.

And there I was again, sitting alone at a lunch table, trying desperately not to cry. 

Climbing a tree, then the ground rushing up at me.

A group of girls surrounding me, laughing, pushing me down.

I didn’t know what this place was, or how it knew, or where it got my memories. But it was clear by now. It was playing back the worst moments of my life, and I was trapped in here with them.

And I knew it was only going to get worse. If I wanted to ever get out of here, I had to keep going through.

I tried to keep my eyes down on the path in front of me, but it didn’t help. I could still hear my cries. My screams.

Lost as I was in my despair, it took me longer than it should have to notice.

Footsteps. Like the scream before, I knew they were real they were not muffled like the doorways. They were clear and real and terrible and they were coming from the direction I had just come from.

 I had to hurry. I didn’t want to meet whateer lived down here. I started to jog.

As I tried to put space between myself and the footsteps, the scenes grew clearer and more intense

My mom pulling me from my bed in the middle of the night and drgging me out to the car, no explanation, with nothing but the clothes we had on. I never saw my childhood home again.

The footsteps, are closer. I start to flat-out run. Still, I could see the scenes playing out on either side of me. 

Another doorway; a hand lurching out for my neck.

I scremed and tried not to look.

And then, ahead a light– not like the doorways. Not a white glare. It was warm and soft, and it was straight ahead.

My muscles were screaming in pain at this point but I sped up, listening to the footsteps get closer all the time. 

The static sound got louder and louder, occasional screams and cries piercing through it.

I was almost there when I noticed a dark figure in the light. Just standing there, staring. 

I stopped for a moment, unsure, but the footsteps were still hunting me. I thought I could hear yelling from that way, not the muffled kind from the doorways–a real, live voice.

There was no choice. I took off again, ready to meet my fate in the light.

As I got closer, the figure began to take shape–a large man, draped in shadow, the light behind him blinding me to his feautres. I locked eyes with him–or at least, imagined I did.

He shouted something, and I raised the ax high and ran at him.

I was almost there, steps away, when he lunged forward, hands outstretched. I screamed and swung the ax.

It struck with a sickening thud, and the figure fell back, into the light. He laid perfectly still, a dark pool forming around him.

I stepped forward into the light and screamed.

The ax clunked to the ground beside me. I

knelt down to confirm the horrible fact I already knew.

Before me laid Jason, the life already gone from his eyes. His skin was ice white. His neck was half severed from his shoulders. He was dead.

I had murdered someone. The thought raced around my mind but I could not make it real.

The footsteps. They were still coming, almost here. 

Suddenly, violently, I vomited.

But I couldn’t stop. I had to go.

The footsteps were pounding now, the yelling louder, bouncing off the walls and whirring together with the static.

Going against all my instincts, I looked over my shoulder for the source of the footsteps.

I recoiled in horror at the sight. It was a human-shaped *thing*, made of static, with human features flashing through every few seconds–a hand, an eye, a length of hair–and running straight at me, arms flailing, feet pounding, voice shrieking incoherently between patches of static, like a radio station going in and out of raange.

Everything in me was repelled by this absolute monstrosity.

Sobbing, I stumbled over Jason’s body, slipping and coating myself in his blood. With one last scream, I pulled myself out onto the porch.

I turned over and looked back 

The tunnel was gon, along with the body. The evidence of my crime.

I crumpled to the ground and gasped with relief, the full horror of what I’d done yet to wash over me. The vibrating in my hands was painful now, like pins and needles after I’d been laying on my arms for hours. I shook and shook them but it didn’t help.

And then–a shadow, to my left. And a growl.

I leapt up. Before me stood an angry beast, teeth bared and hackles up, inching toward me.

“Barney,” I said, my voice trembling, “It’s okay, buddy. It’s me. You know me.”

He lunged, and I leap over the porch railing, falling hard on my side. I groped around for the ax, but of course it was gone, lost to the tunnel.

I stumbled to my feet and tried to run for my car–the key was somehow, miraculously still in my pocket–but it wasn’t there.

I stood frozen for a second, but the dog was coming so I sprinted for the trees as the raging dog leapt over the railing and chased after me.

I entered the woods, running as fast as I could as branches and thorns tear at my clothes and skin. I culd hear the dog’s growls just feet behind me.

I had no idea which direction I’m running in until I stumble onto the dirt road and nearly fall over. I took a moment to catch my breath, but the dog was at my heels. I bolted into the woods on the other side.

My foot caught on a tree root and I crashed into the ground, face first. I cried out in agony, scraping my tongue along the now-cracked teeth in my mouth. I could hear the dog on the road now, coming straight for me.

But then–a flash of lights, and the squeal of breaks. 

I considered crawling over, calling out–but then I remember the blood on my clothes. What could I say?

Then I heared a whistle. And another. And another.

The dog stops growling–whimpers instead.

I heard a car door open and slam shut again.

ANd that’s when I realize.

I ran onto the road just as the car was pulling away.

My car.

It rolls away into the dark.

What the FUCK.

I follow edthe car, stopping just before I emerge from the trees. I can feel the night’s wear on my muscles now that I’ve slowed. My limbs are so heavy. I’m so tired.

I watched myself emerge from the car and it’s all I can do not to pass out. I lean against a tree and let myself sink to the dirt. There’s a soft static sound echoing in my head now.

My other self ushered the dog inside and closes the door. I sat there, gasping for air, lost in my own horror and confusion, for I don’t know how long. I think I passed out

I came to myself eventually. The front door was shut, and I think barney is gone from the car.

The vibration has spread up my arms and into my shoulders and I know what it is now. It’s the static, it’s in me now, in my head. Ever since I touched the cube.

I remembered my phone. I puledl it out, fumbling it at first because my hands won’t stop vibrating.

It was no longer spasming, but I still had no signal.

At some point, though, I must’ve had one, because I have eight missed calls. All from Amy.

She left a few voicemails of varying lengths, but they wouldn’t load.

One text got through: “Where are you??? Please pick up”

I had to get out of here. I had no idea where I’d go or what I’d do, no idea how I could live in a world where there are two of me, but I had got to do something. I had to figure out how to get rid of this static, this–*infection*, somehow.

I still had my car key in my back pocket.

I watched the windows for a minute. No sign of other me.

I creeped toward my car, key in hand, keeping low to the ground. As i got closer i could hear barney barking and grumbling snside

I unlocked the door and crawl inside, shut the door.

Just in time. The cabin door swung open and other me walked out with the dog. I ducked down so they wouldn’t see untilt hey were gone again

And then I just sat there. I knew I need to go, I WANTED to go, but my stupid fucking limbs wouldnn’t move. I coudlnt’ stop thinking about the sickening thud the ax made wehn it connected withskin and bone. My hands shook. I wanted to throw up but there was nothing in me to come out.

I could see the static then. Patches of it, forming on my hands and arms, undulating and slowly spreading. Fuck.

I realized that I–the other one–has disappeared from the window. I must have gone tobrush my teeth. Maybe if i can get in there and stop myself from ever going into that closet then jason won’t be dead?

Fuck it. I had to try.

Slowly, quietly, i pushed the car door open and crawled toward the house. I wince as the front door creacks, but other me didn’t notice. I stood and looked around.

That’s when i noticed my empty fast food bag resting on top of the trash.

A white paper bag.

Fuck. it was me. Future me. The note

I snatch it out of there and stare at it helplessly. What was i trying to say? Sorry, I have to go–what?

I snatched a pen off the counter and tore off a strip of paper and started scribbling, hoping i’dfigure out the note as i go, but my hands and arms shook so bad and I could hardly feel them and then I got to the wor d”go” and then I heard the bathroom door creak open.

Idropped the note and backed into the living room.

Barney had been fast asleep. But he opened his eyes. Slowly, slowly, he raised his head, his eyes becoming angrier by the second, and  his mouth curled up in a snarl and he was barking–

I bolted to the closet just in time, slipping behind the door just as other me emerges from the kitchen. I ducked behind the coats and feelt around in the corner for the black hole hoping i could block me from going down there but it wasn’t there, itwas just closet.

Other me enters and everything changes.

The shrieking sound from the tunnels is back but it’s in my head and it paralyzes me as i feel the yawning gap open up beside me.

Other me leans forward to inspect it, stares deep into it, and i can’t help it–

My breath brushes the back of her neck

She screams and falls and is gone

The gap is still open

I can move again but I am vbrating all over

I don’t know why I’m telling you all this i need to hurry if i’m going to stop her and the static is in my gut now, my heart, it;s going everywhere but but i need someone to know where i’ve gone and why and maybe you can stop it don’t come here just stop it

I’ve got to go nwo, sorry have to go

\*\*\*\*

*That’s it.* 

*The police said she was probably just writing a story, since the events here can’t possibly be true. They have no explanation for why the phone was on the floor in the closet, or why the note was still there in the trash, or where Steph had gone. What, she just wandered into the woods in the middle of the night, in a strange place, without the dog or any of her stuff? And where's Jason?*

*They looked for traces of my brother’s blood on and around the porch, but found nothing. It was raining by then, though, so who knows.*

*The computers and the stuff on the roof is still here, but it doesn’t seem to do anything. I touched the cube too, before I read Steph’s message, and nothing turned on but I think I felt a jolt in my fingers. I hope that was just nerves.*

*The wifi was working fine. Steph’s phone worked fine.*

*The parts about her conversations with me are all true.*

*I sent Steph’s story to myself before I handed the phone back to the police.*

*I brought Barney home with me. He’s not hurt but he’s pretty shaken up. When we arrived he ran straight to a corner of the living room and has been cowering there ever since. I keep bringing him food and water but he barely touches it. He won’t sleep, and I have to drag him outside for bathroom breaks.* 

*He also keeps staring at the door to my garage, alternately whining and growling. I’ve checked and I hope I’m imagining it, but I don’t think so–I think I see a shadow in the corner where there’s never been one. I tried to approach but I thought–I* thought–I could feel tingling in my fingertips. It feels like static.

*I got out of there, and I locked and barricaded the garage door.*

*Please help.*
