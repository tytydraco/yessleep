I adopted a puppy with a missing left leg, and from the moment I saw her, I knew she was meant for me. She reminded me so much of my boyfriend of two years, who was born without his right leg. It felt like fate, as if she was a symbol of love, compassion, and understanding in our lives. I named her Luna, and she quickly became an irreplaceable part of our little family.

At first, everything was perfect. Luna was full of life, always sweet and playful, despite her missing limb. My boyfriend adored her, and the three of us found a happy rhythm. It felt surreal, almost poetic—both of them thriving despite their challenges, and us, a family of sorts, overcoming the odds together.

Then, something strange began to happen.

It started when Luna sprained her paw. It seemed like a minor injury. We took her to the vet, got her a little cast, and expected she’d heal soon. But later that same day, my boyfriend came home from work limping. He said his right knee felt twisted, though he didn’t remember injuring it. At first, I brushed it off as a coincidence, but the timing gnawed at me.

Things escalated when Luna had another accident a few days later. She got overly excited while chasing a ball, slipped, and scraped her side pretty badly. That night, my boyfriend woke up in agony, clutching his side. He swore it felt like something had scratched him, but there were no marks—just pain radiating from inside. I tried to rationalize it, but my unease grew.

By now, I was starting to panic. Every time something happened to Luna, my boyfriend experienced the same thing. If she was cheerful and energetic, so was he. If she was tired, he would feel inexplicably exhausted. It was like they were somehow linked, as if Luna had become a living voodoo doll.

The final straw came last week when Luna developed an infection in her paw. We got her on antibiotics, but she was in intense pain and could barely walk. That night, my boyfriend collapsed. His prosthetic leg wouldn’t fit properly, and he described an unbearable pain in his stump—pain that no doctor could explain. The doctors found nothing physically wrong with him, but his suffering was undeniable.

Now I’m terrified. What happens if Luna gets seriously hurt? Will my boyfriend share her fate? The thought of losing either of them makes my heart race, but now I’m also terrified of what’s to come.

And then, the thought hit me—dogs have significantly shorter lifespans than humans. What happens when Luna ages or her health declines? Will my boyfriend mirror that, too? These questions flood my mind, overwhelming me as I write this, trying to keep my sanity intact. I had hoped to share this story in the hopes someone could tell me I’m imagining things. But I can’t ignore the connection any longer.

This is my testimony. Has anyone ever heard of anything like this before? How can I break the bond between them before something worse happens?

I’m desperate for advice or insight. I don’t know what else to do.
