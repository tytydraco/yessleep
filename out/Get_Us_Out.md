We did something bad.

Him and I do something bad every weekend, whether it's steal things, practice our "street art" skills, or be a general menace to society. This time, we snuck into our old school building.

We went through the heavy door on the first floor, and turned directly right. The thick concrete walls of the stairwell, greeted us. Up we went. The scent of age-old shiny blue paint on concrete, is a unique one. I stuck my right hand out and let my manicure glide softly over the dark, glistening paint as we spiraled upwards, floor after floor. The paint was chipping in some places, smooth in others. The walls were at least several feet thick. No windows.

Second floor, third floor, fourth floor ... up we went. Old brutalist architecture. Between each turn of the thick cement steps was a small landing. Only a few feet wide though. We pushed upwards.

14th floor. The black number 14 stood out boldly against the blue background. We were at the top. The stairs ended and a long dark hallway stretched out before us. We crept forward, trying to sneak deeper into the building ... until we were greeted by *them*.

I don't know who they were. Two teachers? Some superintendents? Why were they here in the middle of the night. A medium height man, black curly hair. A tall woman. Chiseled cheekbones. Looking back on it, I think they were there just to protect the place. They opened their mouths. Said some words. Without thinking, we lunged at them. We tussled with them. Knocked the man out. I could still feel his grip on my shirt sleeve as he tried to hold on, slipping into unconsciousness. The woman retreated. Then - we ran.

Back downstairs. Floor after floor after floor. Spiraling downwards. How many floors has it been? I glanced up at the black numbers, painted against the cerulean blue. 14.

What?

I looked around. Kept running. Another floor down. 14. Another floor. Still 14. The cement looked strange. Bulging in places. I looked at my partner's face, panicked. Has he noticed anything? He ran downwards. I followed.

1̳4̳. The paint was skewed in places. No longer a straight diagonal strip parallel to the angle of the stairs. It whipped and lashed out. The walls were no longer straight either. The angles between the ceiling and the wall were smooth, curved. I think I glimpsed the man's body, as I ran by. It lay on the stairs below me. His face twisted and strange. Dented in.

Another floor down. 𝟙५. The stairs were no longer stairs. Globs of angular concrete jutted out towards us, at strange angles. And each floor was getting smaller. I grabbed my partner's hand, panicked. Looked into his eyes. He was doing his best to not look back at me. Sweating. "Maybe we should go back up.. " he whispered.

We pressed downwards yet again. still 1̶̧̺̦̹̠̜̦̝̍̀̈͑̉̈́́͝4̵̢̖͓͈͍͚̩̞̙͋̎̇̅̀̈͝͝. A dead end. The cement was thick. Arched and tapered towards us. I whipped my head around, looking for a way out. The man's face, embedded in the cement. He looked like a dummy, looking down at us with a mannequin's eyes. His skin smooth, like the face of a doll that got punched too hard in the face. Unmoving.

I could feel my partner's tug on my hand. He pulled me upwards. We ran back up. Up up up. I looked at the walls. They were thick. There were no windows. No doors. Only the shiny cold blue. We were running back upwards for hours. Where was the real floor 14? Where was the long hallway at the top of the building? We need to find the original woman and man. Apologize to them. Even if I could find a sledgehammer and chisel our way out of the cement, what world awaited us outside? Was it home? or.. something else? An endless void of cement that you could never come out of even if you chiseled tunnels for hours? We ran upwards, hand in hand. 14. 14. 14. 14. 14. 14. 14. 14. The walls were looking more and more normal for a while .... until they weren't. It had been hours. It felt like we'd run up hundreds of floors, but it was still 14. There was no hallway. No door. No woman. No man. We hit another dead end.

We ran back downwards, exhausted. The dead end came faster, this time. The stairs no longer were stairs. The walls were barely walls. Slopes of cement, covered in blue.
