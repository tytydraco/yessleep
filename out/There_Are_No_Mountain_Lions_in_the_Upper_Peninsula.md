Dancing we find our protagonist, dancing as he navigates a broken-down path through a boggy marsh constructed of stripped-apart pallets and precariously placed limbs from felled aspen trees. The path he is traveling is many years his senior, and although one assumes such paths must require reconstruction often, as logs rots and feet crash through once-sturdy planks, never before has he noticed virgin boards or freshly-cut trunks laid upon the road, only the continual degradation of miry wood sinking deeper and deeper into the bog. Still the road well-traveled remains usable, and our deft champion has traveled this road many times. He hops between footholds, one foot after another, until he has no feet left and must start again with the first; through this process, dancing better than he had ever danced before when he danced with intent. His destination is a small island across the clear-cut swamp; not truly an island, as a narrow strip of land joins it to a relatively large and unsettled section of forest in the state of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, but regarded by himself as an island for all intents and purposes. Often are other hikers seen crossing the dilapidated path, but never before in the known history of the island has a human arrived from the strip of land connecting it to the vast wilderness, making it, in spirit, an island of human thoughts and emotions, reachable only by a single uniting umbilical cord.

Our protagonist arrives at the island around noon and completes the short but winding hike to the topographical center. Tired, but less from the physical effort of hopping across a narrow path and more from the mental effort of remaining in-the-world and attentive to the precise location of each footstep to avoid slipping (as he has many times), he rests at a central, familiar tree whose roots jut out at just the correct angle to form a surprisingly comfortable seat on the pine-needle floor. This natural chair, if viewed from a separate frame of reference, may also resemble a natural latrine, a perfectly reasonable location to relieve one's self after a muddy hike through an open bog. He attempts to keep these thoughts out of his mind as he relaxes and rests his head against the trunk, instead believing others would feel compelled to respect the sanctity of the location and piss upon some uglier, less functional tree elsewhere. The tree is a source of comfort, a strong, paternal bosom on which weary travelers may rest before or after great excursions. It towers above the rest of the island, and perhaps was the first tree that grew on the island, or perhaps it was born in the swamp, and its roots helped coagulate enough soil to host the rest of the flora that grows today.

From this bark throne a complete view of the island can be made: a relatively flat clearing exists by the bog-path's entrance to the island, adjacent to the trail that leads atop the island's hill where the sitting-tree grows. The clearing can be viewed in full from the tree, and provides a pleasing contrast to the rest of the island, which is heavily wooded, much like the forest beyond the strip of land that connects to the island. Coniferous trees are the most common here, and although the forest floor seems to consist entirely of discarded pine needles, the source of the replenishment in this case is made obvious by the new-growing fascicles of needles covered by crunchy brown placentas, until the needles grow to sufficient length that the covering is discarded and wastes away slowly in the wind.

The sun has now reached an angle such that it begins to shine in our protagonist's eyes, and stirring after drifting off into the beginnings of a daydream, he rises to begin his trek into the vast wilderness across the land-bridge. Although the island is tranquil and refreshing, his desire is not to remain: his destination lies beyond.

Hours later, our protagonist arrives back at the land-bridge and crosses again onto the island, now awash in the orange-golden rays of sunset. His journey was long, and he desires rest, but it was not a new journey by any means: he has charted most of the area in the immediate wilderness that can be reached by a day's hike, and venturing any further would require an overnight commitment. Perhaps feeling slightly disenchanted at the inability to make progress into a great unknown, he returns to the sitting tree and relaxes for but a moment before he is disturbed.

In response to a flash of red noticed in the peripherals of his vision, he glances out from the tree to the clearing and sees a couple lying in the grass on a red checkered picnic blanket. The immediate sight of another person (or persons) shifts his solipsistic mind from a mode of freedom to one of defense and self-consciousness, with an even more extreme reaction than would be normally accounted for when running into a person after being alone in the woods for hours, as the couple is engaged in intercourse. Shocked, our protagonist collects himself, studies the couple to ensure his presence is not noticed, and with a motive not purely pedagogic nor perverted, finds himself inching closer to the edge of the hill overlooking the entangled couple, ignorant of the commotion simultaneously taking place behind him, as fate itself inches closer to our protagonist.

The man is atop the woman in the missionary position, face to face, although she is a good deal shorter than he is, with her legs and feet alternately wrapped around the man, then pointing up towards heaven, then back again to find footholds on the lean back of the man. Enchanted, our protagonist finds himself ever-so-quietly positioned behind a bush overlooking the clearing, but at the very moment the man contorts his body to bring the woman in for a kiss, our fated protagonist experiences, in quick succession, a powerful force at his backside and a searing heat across the left side of his neck, and, losing control of his movement, collapses to the ground.

Once a powerful man who thought himself capable of great action, our protagonist now lies helpless, unable to move, gazing out unfocused at the clearing and the swamp that lies beyond it. The pain in his neck grows until it envelops his entire being, as he feels a sinister warmth travel from the location of the heat to the areas of his skin that lie downstream of his neck. He attempts in vain to summon to action a disobeying arm that now lies uselessly pinned underneath his body. His vision is clouded and fades to black before each piercing heartbeat brings it back and injects it again with colors and lights that bear no resemblance to the beautiful sights he once saw in his coherent hours.

Behind him he feels an entity. The entity is the sitting-tree: no longer a pillar of strength, it now towers over him, a vulgar Methuselah, seeming to mock his helplessness with an eternal stoic gaze. The mask that nature wears to convince us of its tranquility and hide its grotesqueness has slipped away, and our protagonist's last coherent thoughts are directed in disgust towards the trees towering over him: irrational, disfigured, elongated stretches of cellular material sprung forth from the earth without reason, rising and devouring all the resources they can, with no regards for aesthetics, beauty, compassion, or any other virtues that mankind holds dear.

Our protagonist is left with a final vision before the thread of his life is cut and his mind fades away, his body no longer able to support the chain of consciousness that brought him to this point: as the man issues a final groan and the woman pulls him to her body for the remainder of all eternity, no longer two distinct entities but instead both halves joined together as one, neither man nor woman but at the same time a unity of both, a terrifying Baphomet with the ability to bring forth life into existence without consent, eternally, forever.
