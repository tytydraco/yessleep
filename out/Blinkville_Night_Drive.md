My dad is dead in my mind. I haven't seen him in sixteen years and I don't plan on changing that. He was a pathetic, abusive alcoholic. He never struck me with his hands; he took to throwing things at me, and he didn't always miss. It was only ever when he was drunk, but I hardly remember him sober. My name is Garrison, but he almost always called me Gary. I think he may have wanted a boy.

One morning, when I was in the third grade, my mom said I wasn't going to school that day. She said we were going to have a special lunch and visit the zoo. When I got in the car and saw it was packed with most of our things, I knew what was happening. It's hard to explain that relief, that visceral liberation. I just felt freedom. I could *feel* it. Like I'd been wearing a collar since my birth, and was finally removing it.

After moving into a new condo, I learned that this figurative collar hadn't been fully removed, just loosened. My dad still lived with us, like a ghost. When my mom would run up the stairs too quickly, I’d jump up from my desk chair or my bed, expecting the door to swing open and a bottle to come flying at my head. I was still careful around the house, keeping my voice down and watching where I stepped. And I had a real hard time sleeping. All the way through highschool. Not every night. The insomnia would strike whenever it decided. Three to four times a week. Sometimes I’d fall asleep fine, but wake up in the middle of the night, unable to get back to a dream until I left for school.

I’d yawn in class or lay my head down and a teacher would say, “Am I boring you?” and I’d just apologize. By eighth grade, some of the teachers didn’t care when I’d doze off. Some of them started to expect students to be responsible for themselves. I was thankful for that. I’d get the notes from somebody and study the lesson at home, in the late hours of the night.

I truly only had one friend. One that I saw outside of school, at least. Her name was Monika. She’d pick me up in her convertible and we’d drive downtown, walking around, window shopping, and often ending up at the candy shop since that’s the only place with things I could afford.

In my state, you can get your driver’s permit six months before you turn sixteen. Monika had been held back a year in elementary school, so she was one of the only freshmen able to drive. It was like a superpower. She was a great friend and I just felt lucky that she liked being around me. Her family wasn’t rich, but she lived in a neighborhood and had her own car, and that was like a fantasy to me. It hurt me deeply that I still didn’t want her to come over to my condo, even with my dad gone. It just didn’t make sense to hang out there instead of her place. She had a bigger house and more things to do and neighbors our age to play with. I think my mom felt bad about that too, bless her heart.

Monika would even let me drive the convertible sometimes. We started in parking lots, then her neighborhood, and in two month’s time, she’d let me take us on the highway downtown. She was my driving instructor. That was a running joke we had. One we didn’t say around our parents. They would've killed us if they knew I was driving without a license. And they’d be right to. But I was fifteen and it felt like something I had control of, and that’s what I needed.

Eventually, Monika gave me a spare key. It was stupid. But we were kids - stupidity is to be expected. She gave me the spare because of my insomnia. She said I could take her car out and drive around on nights that I couldn’t sleep. As long as I paid for gas and bought her some candy from the gas station every now and then. It was the most generous thing a friend had ever done for me.

And it worked. Not every time, but most nights. I'd go out for a drive and return home feeling more gracious for my bed, still not getting more than four hours of shut-eye, but it was better than no rest at all. It became routine after a month. Once it was two in the morning and I could tell I’d been bitten by the insomnia bug, I’d make the ten minute trek over to Monika’s house and hop in the convertible parked in her driveway.

She started lending her car to me in March, in that transition from winter to spring, and I’d put the top down despite my nose going red and my fingers stinging from the cold. I had control. I was choosing to feel that pain. To feel anything that late in the night. Under my own accord. No worries about how fast I was going or what lane I was in.

I’d take the highway, keeping the top down. I'd be playing “Heroes,” by David Bowie, taking out my scrunchie and letting my hair whip behind me. That song was the closest I could find to match the feeling of the night. Hazy and hypnotic and freeing. I’d close my eyes on the straight section of the highway. For about five seconds. Again - stupidity to be expected. But there was hardly ever another person on the road that late at night. There wasn’t a thing to hit out there. It was worth it to me. The feeling I would get from that mix of risk and bliss and control. For five seconds. And then I’d take the exit and drive back to Monika’s.

I’d heard the Blinkville stories, I just didn’t care. It was all nonsense to me. I liked to drive around at night when I had nothing to do, and some people liked to make up stories about their boring town when they had nothing to do. Anyways, I was aware that you’re supposed to be weary at night in Blinkville especially. Whether you believe the stories or not, a lot of people *do* go missing. But I was in Monika’s car, so I thought I was safe.

One night, I went through the same routine. Walked to Monika’s, took the convertible, put the top down, put Bowie on, and hit the highway. I got to that straight section, “Heroes,” was playing, and I closed my eyes. I opened them about five seconds later, my pleased smile flying out of the car when I saw the structure down the highway. I hit the brakes. I eased into a stop, parking the car about ten feet from the horrible wreck just off the road.

A sedan was flipped on its side, the passenger side against the ground. An SUV was behind it, pointing towards the flipped car’s exposed side. The front of the SUV was crushed, clearly responsible for the flipping of the sedan. I stood there beside Monika’s car for I don’t know how long. Something was very wrong. There wasn’t a soul at this wreck.

I was horrified. There wasn't any noise besides the hum of the engines. Both cars were still on. The SUV's headlights were exposing the bottom side of the sedan. The sedan's lights were shining off into the trees.

I figured everyone involved was dead since it appeared deserted. But…I couldn’t see a single body in any of the cars. Not one. So I walked over there. Broken glass on the ground, random plastic and metal chunks thrown everywhere. I walked past the SUV. Nobody inside. I approached the sedan, looking in through the windshield of the sideways car. Nobody. I looked around. Up and down the highway. I looked off into the woods beside the road. Nobody. I noticed the sedan didn't have a license plate, and grew even more uneasy after walking back to the SUV and seeing it didn't have one either.

I looked into the SUV. The only thing moving in there were the pixels on the radio’s screen, the time reading "3:08." It said, “SCANNING,” as some pixelated lines twirled around, searching for a radio station to connect to. This didn’t make any sense either. How long had this car been sitting here, trying to connect to a station? Maybe it was delayed because of the crash - something had broken. But then the lines stopped moving, and a second later the screen changed to display some frequency numbers and The Smiths started playing.

Playing might not be the right word. *Blaring*. “How Soon Is Now?” came on in an instant, the iconic slide guitar slashing through the silence. The Smiths were my dad’s favorite band. I always fucking hated them. It might not even be because of my dad, although that’s a likely reason. I just hate their sound. Always dreary and sluggish. They put a pit in my stomach or just remind me of the one that’s already there.

But here they were, at three in the morning, playing from an abandoned, totaled car. I jumped. It scared the shit out of me. And it was playing extremely loud. I held my hands over my ears and backed up, back towards Monika's car, crunching some glass beneath my shoes as I went. I was getting tired. Of all the times for sleep to finally grasp me. 

I wasn’t sure what to do. There wasn’t anyone here, but *somebody* had to have been involved in the wreck. But if I called the cops, would I get in trouble for not having a permit? Even if I’d had one, you can’t drive that late without a license. I was being paranoid, but I was fifteen, and getting in trouble - especially for something illegal - was my biggest concern. And what would happen to Monika? She’d probably end up in worse trouble than me for lending her car.

Then the song was cut off midway through by a voice, just as loud as the music had been. It was the voice and the voice alone, no background music or sound effects like your typical radio announcements. I practically jumped out of my shoes. 

“Don’t touch that dial now, we’ve got plenty more where that came from!” It sounded like a generic radio host, but with a gruffer throat. Not like that of a cigarette smoker, the voice had the baritone of someone sinister. I don’t know how else to put it. Basically, this man spoke, and I felt like I’d been caught. Like someone knew I was there.

And then the ABC’s started playing through the SUV’s speakers. A crowd of kids singing the alphabet. “A B C D E F G!” I stood there, still contemplating what to do, glancing around and trying to prove to myself I wasn't being watched. “A R R I S O N!”

It was silent after that. They didn’t sing any more letters - they didn’t sing anything else at all. It was just the crinkle of the speakers spewing dead air. They'd spelled my name. In the same melody as the alphabet, they carried on from G and spelled out my name.

I stood there, frozen. I couldn’t believe it. They'd just spelled my fucking *name*. I looked around. This time, making sure there wasn’t a figure running at me. I felt pinned, trapped. But I was still the only one there.

I got in Monika’s car and put it in drive. There wasn’t anyone here that needed help, and the wreck would be found in the morning. There was clearly something else going on here. I felt like I was on some sort of fucked up prank show. I drove off as the man’s voice came back on the radio, falling out of earshot as if he were calling after me. “You folks in radio land better sit tight, now! There's more..."

I left Monika's car in her driveway and walked back home. There was nothing else to think about - nothing else I *could* think about. I felt like I’d been involved in something, like I was a cog that slipped itself into some unfathomable machine. They’d spelled my name. There was no getting out now. I slept well that night, though. I just wanted to forget the whole thing.

The next morning, I tried telling myself it had been a dream, but I never believed that. I'd been there. I'd felt the cool air and heard the radio and seen the wreck up close. It was a Saturday morning and Monika and I were gonna go downtown. But the wreck loomed over me, consuming any possible excitement I'd normally have. I felt like the cops would come knocking on my door, like some unforeseen repercussion could crash into me at any moment.

When we took the highway downtown with the convertible's top down, I barely listened to the radio or felt the wind on my face or heard a thing that Monika was saying. I was looking for the wreck. And then I saw it. The wreck was there, in the same spot. But the cars were different. Traffic was slow, everyone trying to get a good glimpse as they passed by. There was an ambulance and police and what I assumed were the victims of the crash standing around the cars.

We drove by and my heart was thumping out of my chest. This wreck had just happened. A sports car was in place of the sedan, flipped on its side, passenger window against the ground. A Tahoe was in place of the SUV. This was a completely different accident, but it looked identical to what I'd seen the night before.

Then "How Soon Is Now?" started playing on Monika's radio. My blood ran cold and I changed the station immediately.

"Did you hear that?" Monika asked.

"What? The song?"

"No-."

And then I did hear it. "Garrison!" A man was yelling by the totaled cars.

I shot back around to look towards the yelling. A man was running to a woman on a stretcher. "Garrison! Are you okay? Is she okay?"

And then our section of the traffic picked up and the man's cries flew out of earshot.
