Hello to whoever is reading this,

I am writing to warn both you and myself to never speak with the woman in the woods at the east mountain village. Although it may seem peaceful at first, once you spend a few days and interact with the locals, you'll realize the strange rules you're forced to follow and the bizarre events occurring in that place. Do not be fooled by appearances; nothing is as it seems. Be selfish if you want to survive and help yourself before helping others. Only help those you know if you value your life.

I say this as a warning to myself because my memories of that summer are fading, and I'm forgetting more each day. I may be tempted to challenge her again to obtain another wish if I forget the horror I've experienced. Human beings are incredibly greedy creatures, and even the good ones might succumb to temptation, leading to their bitter end. We are no different; trust me.

I tricked her once, but I doubt I can do it again. Even if I could, I don't want to face worse consequences than I'm currently dealing with. She's twisted and cruel like that. The events may be fading, but the voices are getting louder. The voices of those who failed before me are mad because I accomplished what they couldn't, like I robbed what's rightfully theirs. At least that's what I gathered from the nightmares I've been having in the past few years since that cursed summer. They won't stop, and they get louder at night when it's mostly quiet, and I'm alone.

When I'm with people, I don't hear them as much; they get quieter, but they never stop. As a result, I was forced to leave the village when I turned 18, leaving my family and friends behind, hoping it would help me move on. The life I once knew became a hell I was bound to, so I had to leave without a word. I didn't want anyone to find me and hunt me down, torturing me for the rest of my life. It's been three years now, and they still won't give up. My plan has obviously failed. They stopped for a week when I crossed the country to another state, but they soon started again, giving me hope then stripping it away like she did to them. Why am I being punished when I wasn't the one who cursed them to an eternal void?

Even medication doesn't work on me. The doctors I visited all had one diagnosis to offer: schizophrenia, they say. I gulped down bottle after bottle, but they still laugh, yell, and sometimes curse me. I curse myself often too for being too stupid to ignore the rules. I've been blinded by both grief and greed to listen. Ironically, I can't stop listening now.

Rule number one: if you get lost in the woods, never call out. Follow the white string tied to the trees, and you'll be guided back to the village.

Rule number two: don't talk to strangers while in the forest. They will steal your voice. They are spiteful, filled with hatred and bottled-up anger, and they will silence you like they were silenced.

If you choose to ignore this rule, you'll find your tongue in your pocket the next day, and in a month, you'll be found dead. My grandma told me that's how her brother passed away. He wandered off in the middle of the night to drink with his friends. Unfortunately, he ended up too drunk to remember not to talk to strangers. No matter what they say or how they look, they may appear charming or outright violent, but you must never speak to them. They cannot harm you, so don't worry about them; just keep your mouth shut.


Rule number three: if you see a stranger blind folded stand still and don't make any noises or sudden movements . They can not see you but they can hear you very well .

If you do move ...I'm sorry you are as good as dead . They can move at an unnatural speed and moments later they will have your eyes in Their hands and the last thing you'll be able to see is their bloodied blind fold and hollow eye socket. 
It's said that you'll go crazy as soon as you see the darkness in Their empty holes so maybe it won't hurt as much when it takes out your eyes if your happiness and life gets sucked out of you in seconds just before it's claws dig inside of your head .

Rule four : if you hear singing, run as fast as you can . 

You got too close to the cave . Those creatures aren't fast but they don't give up easily either. So if you manage to get back home, close all windows and doors, go to your room and pry. do not open the door even if you think it's your mother on the other side . If you value your limbs that is . They collect them hoping to create a full body again because they are nothing but logs of flesh with a head ... How they move is a mystery as no one has encountered them and lived to tell the tale . 

Ironically as I'm typing this my body is reliving the horrible events once more .The smell of rotting flesh is filling my senses . the old voices are drowned by new ones I'm reliving. 
These voices are crying in pain more sinister in their promises of vengeance. They are newer victims who have yet to get used to the void .
They still think they can come back .

But death is absolute. unfortunately I learned that the hard way ...

I'm too disoriented to remember or write more . So hopefully I'll continue this tomorrow...if they don't get to me .

They never make empty promises .
