I’ve always been known to be a deep sleeper, to the point I've slept through natural disasters. But recently, I can’t sleep. It all started about a year ago in the north of Wales, a small town (although it's legally a city) called Wrexham.

 I was walking home after a particularly raunchy night in the town before all of my friends went back to University. To get back to my home you have to walk down a dark wooded road, there’s no lights and after 10pm no cars drive down this particular road except for the odd taxi every couple of hours. 

I’m not usually a paranoid person but this night I was, I could constantly see something in the corner of my eye stalking me. I brushed it off as my drunken mind trying to find something to entertain itself but as I walked further and further, it got closer. It never crossed my direct line of vision but it did like to make itself known. Leaves crinkling, twigs snapping, and the occasional breath on the back of the neck you’d swear was colder than ice. 

I got home safely, thank god, and layed down in my bed.

I did sleep that night but the dreams I had were more like a fever dream mixed with a bad 1930’s magic show. A man in his late 50’s was performing in front of a small crowd who seemed to be getting increasingly bored of his admittedly very bad tricks. The tricks were tacky and it was not hard for the crowd to understand how they were performed. So, in order to catch their attention, he proposed a magic trick in which he would go a month without sleeping. The crowd perked their ears at this as they didn’t believe it could be done. 

He did well, going much farther than was considered scientifically possible at the time but towards the end he went stir crazy. Foaming at the mouth, incoherent rambling and he eventually had to be restrained because he tried to rip his own skin off to wear,

The next morning was typical for a Sunday hangover for me. I got out of bed, drank as much water as my body could handle and wandered the house looking for ways to relieve my pain. When I went to bed that night however, I remembered the dream. I occasionally have difficulty going to sleep, especially if I had drank the night before, but this night was different. No matter how much I tossed and turned I could not sleep.

 It annoyed me to the point I got out of bed, put some clothes on and decided to play some video games. In the morning I decided to start my day right by opening the curtains to let some beautiful summer light in, only to see part of my window had fogged up. He was here.

 I spent many countless sleepless nights trying to figure out why I couldn’t sleep. I tried warm milk, all the way to therapy and even some spiritualists but nothing worked. The dream kept playing in my mind however so I decided to look it up to see if there was any link to a real life event, by this time my mind started to slip away from me. After searching up the events I discovered that the man was indeed real and he escaped at the age of 87. 

There were no reports of him ever having slept.

Now every night, laying in my bed, I have to resist the urge to let him in.

But maybe it wouldn’t be so bad.

I’m planning to let him in tomorrow.
