I apologize to all of you for not providing answers. I must admit that much more happened after [parts](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/mvnjyb/my_girlfriend_talks_in_her_sleep/) 1-4. It took a lot out of me to finally write this out. You have to understand that I wanted to put it all behind me. It would have been easier that way, to pretend none of it even happened. I don’t expect anyone to believe what happened next.

But you all deserve to know. 

They told me she was in a coma and she may never wake up.  The cops questioned me for hours, clearly unable to hide their suspicions as they scribbled notes behind clipboards. I don’t think of myself as a good liar. But I was clearly distressed. I told them that a drunk driver hit us and ran us off the road. That her hand got stuck in the twisted metal, and I had to personally saw it off with a pocket knife. Her wound was a mangled stump, torn flesh hanging in ragged, uneven strips, so I guess they believe me. I just prayed no one found the severed hand we left locked in the cooler back at the house. 

I was traumatized by all that had happened, and I spent a lot of time in a doom spiral feeling sorry for myself. None of it made sense. I couldn’t talk to anyone. The only person who would listen was on a ventilator and being fed through feeding tubes in a series of sterile hospital rooms. I couldn’t sleep. On the rare occasion that I did, I dreamt that she spoke to me while still lying there, immobilized. Just like she had before. But now each night she asked me to kill her. To pull the plug. To end her pain. I would wake up sweating, unsure of what was real. But she would always still be lying there, catatonic. 

When she developed the rash, harsh white and red splotches, they told me it was thrush. They didn’t believe me when I insisted that I saw it…move. Her skin became thinner somehow, almost translucent. I could see *through* it and underneath were these living patches of obsidian. Mottled continents of the stuff would move if I touched her. No one else could see it. They thought I was crazy, and I *felt* crazy, but it was *alive.* I gave up on trying to convince anyone. I feared they would kick me out, or worse, institutionalize me. Besides, it was mesmerizing, the movement under her skin. It made it somehow easy to stay calm. I would lose hours just staring into it. 

So I was hardly listening to the doctor when they told me they were sending us home.

I cared for her myself. Soon after arriving home her body started to secrete a black ooze, the same kind that had filled our bedroom so many nights before. This time, however, it didn’t evaporate(?) during the daytime. I was told a coma is not the same as sleep, but the slime only ever came out when she was asleep in the past. So I cleaned and cleaned, and time soon blended together. Eventually I fell asleep. My dream was all-dark until I knew I was in my bedroom. I sat up against the pillows, my eyes drawn to a hunched shape in the corner. A man faced away from me, his spine protruding like knuckles. He contorted his knees somehow, they bent backwards, and his face was looking at me upside down. I want to run, but the blankets felt as heavy as lead and I could not move. He gallops towards me impossibly, like a contortionist on all fours. He is too fast. Getting closer. His head spins on a swivel to face me up right now, and there are two crimson pits. The pits are his eyes, and up close they look like rotted apples. Blackness where the stem should be goes on infinitely, and I know that is where he can see me. He smiles, a crocodile-smile, sharp teeth lusting for my flesh. I brace for the bite that will drain me of life when I wake up. 

I looked around in a daze, cursed at myself for falling asleep, sprinted to the bedroom, slid uncontrollably on a lake of black liquid…and believe me I know how crazy this sounds. 

She had *transformed*. 

Something lay in the bed where she had once lay, but it was NOT my girlfriend.  A massive.. balloon? Of skin and hair, translucent skin still revealing the swirling black. A belabored wheezing filled the room like a haunted metronome. The bed springs groaned with the rise and fall of its breath. I thought she was gone forever, this thing must have eaten her... But then I saw the eye. Tethered to the side of tortured skin. Green with flecks of gold.  Beautiful, intelligent. Her eye. 

It blinked sluggishly at me. 

She was awake. She was *alive*.

I didn’t know what else to do, so I talked to her. I told her that “this too shall pass.” I hoped I sounded convincing. We developed a system where one blink meant “yes” and two blinks meant “no”. This became helpful because I could clean her form without hurting her. The black ooze overwhelmed me now and covered me from head to toe. The bedroom was permanently steeped in the slime and if I stood in one place too long it seemed to firm up and glue my feet to the floor. I tracked it all through the house. I was tired, but I felt like if I fell asleep again it would consume me. I would never wake up. 

I don’t know how many days I stayed awake. I know now, and I am embarrassed to admit this, but the slime on my skin had an effect on my brain. It was a form of hypnosis, I think. The more of it that got on my skin the less tethered to reality I felt. It took me way too long to figure that out. I was a helpless marionette suspended in a Cronenburg movie as I cleaned and cleaned and cleaned. Eventually the perpetual daze-loop was interrupted by the doorbell. It scared the shit out of me, and I prayed whoever it was would go away, but then they started rapping on the door. I decided I needed to look out the window to see who it was. 

The priest’s car blocking mine in the driveway. 

*Why hadn’t I called him already?* 

He sounded like he would break a window, so I let him in. He wasted no time. 

“Why didn’t you answer my calls?” He demanded, then brushed right past me with his briefcase and inspected the first stale puddle of the black ichor from hell.

“I…uh…” My dehydrated lips stuck together, like my mouth hadn’t produced saliva in days. 

The priest stared at me, shook his head, reached into his briefcase, wet a rag with a brown-blue fluid. 

“Wipe your skin with this. Then get changed.” He said, clearly concerned, handing me the soaking rag. It smelled like olive oil, and black smoke plumed from where it touched the bile on my hands. Strangely, it did not feel hot. 

“What is it?” I asked.

“It’s called Chrism. It will banish the mire.”



*STOP.* 



That *voice* again. I ignored it. But as I cleaned my hands and wrists with the rag it spoke with more and more urgency. 



*SLEEP.* 



The *voice* in my head that commanded me to do things. It was easy to listen to, like it was saying things I would have thought to do anyway. But now the voice became softer, more distant, like it was coming from down a long hallway. That’s when my vision tunneled. I went temporarily blind and had to stabilize myself against a wall. I was confident I would pass out. Then I could see myself? Like an out of body experience. There I was, at the grocery store in the produce section spreading the black mire on the stacks of potatoes. But then light, more light, and I’m back in the foyer again. It was the strangest feeling, like I had just woken up from a long dream. 

*Had I done that?* 

I couldn’t remember. I opened the dresser and found dry clothes, put them on. Suddenly it was like experiencing silence for the first time. Like a schizophrenic tinnitus was cured. Reality came flooding back. Someone is here. Yes. The priest. He looked like he may as well be the second-coming of jesus christ as he moved confidently throughout the house. But that image soon faded when he cornered past me into the kitchen, rooted around under the sink, produced trash bags, tore off several for himself, then handed me the roll. 

“You’ve been busy huh? He asked.

Sober now, I realized what he was talking about. I was in awe. Someone had spread the black liquid *everywhere* in the house. It paved the walls, the floors, the toilet. The ceiling where I could reach. The sinks. 

*I did that?*

I didn’t remember any of it. 

“Chrism won’t help at this stage” he said matter-of-factly, then tore a hole in one of the bags and pulled it over his head like a make-shift poncho. “This late in the incubation there is nothing we can do.”

“Incubation? What the hell…??”

“Yes..” He pulled trash bags over his hands one by one. “I am sorry. I eradicated the possession with the rites. But I didn’t anticipate the parasite.”

My mind started to feel like mush again. The priest continued, 

“The demon, I suspect summoned by the solar cult … the one that possessed her…it was host to a pain elemental. All it had to do was offer its incarnation in a young host, corporeal flesh, a chance to feel *real* pain, and it took them up on it.”

I ripped a hole in my trash bag too big for it to be of any use. This was too much to take in. We had gone through hell…and he hadn’t fixed her. Hopelessness washed over me yet again.

“Look man…I don’t care what it is, demon.. ghost.. evil FUCKING spirit …you just saw her! She is unrecognizable! Try the rites again!” 

“That won’t work.” But sensing my distress, he motioned for me to follow him to the bedroom. “But just so you don’t second guess me later, I’ll show you.” He dug through his briefcase and produced the tome. Then flipped to the right page, began reading. 

“Lord Above, hear my call…”

My girlfriend’s one eye began blinking frantically. Two blinks, a pause, then two blinks. 

“*NO NO NO*”. 

Then she winced as a fresh mound of skin bubbled out from the surface of what I now knew was an… egg. From the mound formed a slit, which ripped open, revealing sharp white teeth in a cascade of blood. I recognized it instantly. The crocodile-smile from my dream. The tension was killing me. What was it going to do? I was too scared to move, scared it would talk, if it did I knew I would scream. It was still. Then, like a snake unhinging it’s jaws, the mouth opened, a cavernous maw impossibly wide, until finally, it bit down. Hard. Blood, red blood, waterfalled from the bite over the black layer of mire. A tear formed in my girlfriend’s eye. 

I reached over and slammed the tome shut while it was still in the priest’s hands. I had seen enough. It was one thing to accept that she was still alive inside…there. It was another to accept that this…egg.. Was *her* body, and she could still feel pain. When the dust from the tome started to settle the mouth mercifully let go. Then it smiled that wicked smile that still haunts my dreams to this day.

“Listen. It will feed on her pain until she dies.” the priest said into my ear. “We can antagonize it all you want. It will do no good.” 

I was incredulous. “Oh so you’ve got a million ways to banish a literal servant of satan, but you can’t do shit about the egg for a fucking hate leech?” I shouted, wiping my girlfriend’s eye with a crinkling trash bag-covered hand.

“Yes, I’m afraid.”

“That’s fucking bullshit man!” I stood up defiantly and he grabbed me by both shoulders. 

“FOCUS. She can still hear you in there if you want to say your goodbyes. Once she has passed…” 

“ONCE SHE HAS PASSED??” I yelled, immediately wishing she hadn’t heard me say that.  

I paced around the room.  Punched a crippled star into the drywall. The priest kept one eye on me, one on her. He did look sorrowful standing there with crossed arms. I took some deep breaths. I hated him. But I had no choice but to trust him. I reassured myself that he was just trying to help. I left the bedroom and opened the cabinet where we keep the liquor. Thank god, I hadn’t spread the mire in here yet. So I poured a shot of tequila. Half as much went onto the bar cart as I did into the glass. I barely tasted it. My hands were already pouring again, but they were shaking too much so I gave up and took the next swig straight from the bottle. 

I heard a knock. A series of knocks, actually. I stood completely still. The warmth from the liquor spread deeper in my throat. I listened, heard only agonized breathing coming from the bedroom, but then another knock.

One. 

Two. 

Three. 

Someone at the door? No, it sounded closer than that. Muffled knocks, coming from… the cooler. The one that stashed my girlfriend’s severed hand. The same hand that had terrorized the both of us, hunting us just as we hunted it, all through this house. To avoid mass hysteria, we never brought it into the hospital. If the staff had seen it, we knew there was no way in hell she would be treated. The cooler was inexplicably untouched by the black film that covered everything else in the house. And a knock was new. Before the exorcism, it was never organized enough for a knock. It was scratching, always scratching, at the walls inside. Had it woken up at the same time she did inside the egg? 

I took two steps to the cooler and stooped down next to it. Knocked back. 

One. 

Two. 

Three. 

It responded. 

One. 

Two. 

Three. 

I pulled off the tape and wrenched the lid open, not caring if it leaped out at me and vice-gripped my throat. Then there it was, flat, splayed like a spider with human skin in a pool of its own blood. It sensed freedom and catapulted itself at the inner walls to try and escape. It failed, and splashed back down into the blood. It was much *slower* than it was before. Exhausted? I wasn’t afraid of it. I picked it up. It curled into a fist in my hands as if it was comfortable there. I cleaned it under the sink. Blood and water refused to mix with the bile that hopelessly clogged the drain. It even let me dry it with a kitchen towel. 

It was HER, I decided. Not the demon, not the parasite. 

“Put it back in the cooler.” The priest demanded uneasily, his eyes wide and glued to the hand.

She somehow sensed him, then leaped to the kitchen island. Her class ring clinked on the countertop as she landed. 

“Wait.” I said, holding the priest back. 

We both stared slack-jawed as it inch-wormed its way across the table. It fumbled over an old magazine and phone cables towards what it wanted. 

A *pen*. It wanted to *write.* 

It held the pen to the paper, but it was struggling. The first note came out illegible, and I was petrified that we would never actually learn what it was trying to say. It had no wrist to help prop itself up, I decided. So I held it up, hovered it over the magazine until it was done. 

One scribbled, hastily drawn word.  

“*CHRISM*”

"It’s her.” I said, ripping the page from the magazine and shoving it maybe too hard into the priest’s chest. He read it. Nodded knowingly.

“Yes, I’m not surprised that she knows what it fears. But the very fact that she *knows* what chrism even *is* means that it is too late… The parasite and her mind are already one.” 

I was no longer listening. I nearly busted my ass sliding on wet bile running back to the bedroom. I slammed the door shut, locked it. The priest was hot on my heels, banging on the door behind me.

“STOP!” he demanded. “SHE ALREADY LET IT IN! CHRISM WILL MERELY DELAY THE INEVITABLE!” 

I prayed the briefcase had no combination lock. None. I dug out the vial of chrism, dropped a single drop on the living mound of skin and hair. The black swirling under her skin stopped. In all the time I cared for this … thing, that had never happened. My eyes never left the mouth, always expecting it to bite down again, but at the touch of chrism it fled, somehow, beneath folds of skin. 

*Survival instinct.* 

It was TRUE. It was SCARED! A mad smile formed on my face. Then, the faintest glimmer of hope, at the center of the smoking drop, the lighter shade of my girlfriend’s skin. 

The priest kicked down the door, he was stronger than he looked. I fell on my trashbag-covered ass right into the slime. 

“You didn’t let her finish! It’s FIRE, NOT CHRISM that will kill it. LOOK!” 

He handed me another page torn from the magazine. A longer message this time,  

“*light the bed on fire and run*”

I looked deeply into her one eye. I was so confused…none of it made any sense. Why did she change her mind? I bent down close to her one eye, spoke right into it.

“Look honey, I trust that you know what you need. I don’t understand why you said chrism first, but if it’s fire that you need, then fire it is.” 

I told her I loved her, and the pain will be over soon. 

The priest lit a match, held it below a rolled up newspaper until it caught and formed a makeshift torch. He handed it to me, he wanted ME to be the one to put her out of her misery. To have the blood on MY hands. I was about to toss it on her too, but that’s when she blinked. Twice in the firelight. 

Twice. Twice for “NO”. 

I stopped. I threw the newspaper to the hardwood, stomped it out, polluted steam from melting plastic filling my nostrils. 

“What are you doing!?” The priest shouted as if I was insane. 

“She blinked “NO” goddammit!” 

“Of course she did, would you *want* to be lit on fire??”

“The HAND is HER. The EYE is HER. You said the HAND wrote to light her on fire. But the EYE said NO.”

I tore the new note out of my pocket. The priest tried to swipe it from my hands, but I turned and evaded his reach. Scribbled, hastily drawn handwriting like the first one. But… something imperceptibly different. On the first one, the hand could hardly press down enough to make a mark. The words on this page were steady and even. The amount of pressure applied would have been impossible for her. 

She hadn’t written this note. The priest had lied. 

“Get out.” I declared, pointing to the door.

He put up both hands to placate me, “Calm down. Burning is standard protocol. You’ve seen what happened to your house. If it gets out…”

“Get. The fuck. Out.” I shoved him hard in the chest. He crashed back into the wall. I followed, grabbed him by his coat, and threw him to the splash tile at the front door.

“You don’t UNDERSTAND.” he grimaced. “She is the host…He feeds off her suffering. You have to kill BOTH or it can pass to the next available host. Then if it spreads, and if it spreads … it …” he was stammering, distressed. 

“I get it. So that was the plan all along, huh? Kill her to then kill it. But you left out the part where you COULD save her. Huh? Then what about me? I was covered from head to toe in the mind-melting black stuff when you got here. Was I the next host? Were you going to kill me too?”

“My clan does as the Utmost One declares…” he muttered.

At that moment, my girlfriend’s severed hand skidded around the corner, and as deft as a spider, fingers moving in a blur like a little dog's legs, it crossed the room and climbed the priest's pant leg. He reached for it but it vaulted in a series of perfect dodges, until it made it to his face and latched on. Fingernails dug deep into his eyes in a determined claw. Blood immediately boiled out of his sockets like red tears. He was screaming and fell to the ground, blinded, until finally he managed to rip it off.  The hand scurried beneath the couch. 

I figured I shouldn’t wait for him to decide his god wanted me dead too. So I hit him over the head with his briefcase. It connected, and he lay knocked out cold in the black slime. It began to grow over him, and I knew that soon it would cover him completely. 

I opened the briefcase and a myriad of contents unrecognizable to me spilled out onto the floor. Then there it was. The vial of chrism. It was unlike any liquid I had seen. Cities of blue, blinking in perfectly organized lines, greeting purple swirls and glittered dots with excited light. My mind was racing. My heart pounded in my chest. I still couldn’t think straight, but he wanted fire. She wanted chrism.

Good enough for me.

I opened the vial. Poured it over her form, arms raised to their zenith as I spread it liberally over her mounds of tortured skin. A dense mist steamed again where the chrism met the ichor, and the room was soon fully obscured with black smoke. I couldn’t see anything, and I thought my mind was playing tricks. But I could hear her. The smallest choke of a voice I hadn’t heard in so long. 

“Help…”

She was buried deep in mist and flesh. I was in it up to my elbows, not caring that I was breathing it in, until I felt bone. Her skin. The curve of a shoulder. She was intact, breathing, lying sideways in otherworldly gore. I pulled her out. I’ll never forget how light she felt. I brought her to the shower. Cleaned the wounds where the creature’s teeth had bit her. I soaked a towel in the last of the chrism and wrapped her in it. Her body became obscured by plumes of black smoke one last time. I was worried that she could suffocate. But then I heard a groan behind me, the waking of the priest. I turned. He was almost completely covered in the black slime when his bloodshot eyes bolted open. Then he was on his feet. 

“What have you DONE!” He shouted as he ran to the bedroom.  

“I saved her life, no thanks to you!” I yelled back. 

“You FOOL! You let it LOOSE!”

I turned the water off, careful to lay my girlfriend’s head down gently, and followed him to the bedroom. He was kneeling, praying, his bloodied eyes wide open, on his knees beside the bed. Trash bags askew, his bare skin was soaked in mire in a thousand places. Then he nodded to himself. I heard a hushed “Amen”. 

Then he started collecting the bits of melted.. egg.. forming it like clay together in a singular pile. 

“What are you doing?” I asked.

He ignored me. Kept working. He was determined, and when he was done, he turned to me. He had crafted the form of a newborn calf. He cradled it in his arms like a proud farmer. Ooze bridged from the creature to his hands in slimy tendrils. When he came closer I could see the animal in full. It was the one from my dream. That was no animal. No. It would grow into a man. His knees would bend the wrong way and when its eyes opened they would be crimson, like rotten apples, and the black where the stem should be would go on infinitely. 

The priest was too calm. He said in a tone too severe,

“Promise me. After it is done. Burn us both.”  

He handed me a box of matches. I meant to say something, but nothing came out. All I could do was nod. 



*Kill him.* 

*Kill him.* 

*Kill him.* 



I ignored the voice in my head. The priest was praying out loud again.

“Father, I heed your instructions. Pass this evil to me.”



*Stop him.* 

*Kill him.* 



He held the creature’s nose to a piece of his arm skin that was covered in slime. It sniffed for a moment, then without opening it’s eyes, took a bite. The creature’s teeth cut through his skin like a hot knife. It ate him alive. He screamed for a long time, too long, until finally all he could do was twitch. It was a merciless death. Then it woke up. Red eyes. Crocodile smile. It had gained strength from eating him. It had grown significantly in size. The eyes beckoned me.



*APPROACH.*



I was already holding a match to the striking strip on the side of the box. 



*STOP.*



I lit the match. The eyes widened and infinite blackness commanded me,



*DISCARD*.



I closed my eyes and death was running at me like a hound. I threw the match blindly forward, and I was sure it would be close enough now to eat my hand. But when I opened them again the creature was engulfed. The eyes beckoned me from behind the flames,



*JOIN ME.* 



I closed my eyes again. I turned and ran out of the room blindly. The bed creaked and groaned as the creature flailed. I felt my way to the bathroom, scooped up my girlfriend and intended to run out the front door. But then the black goop that had painted the walls, floors and furniture evaporated in an instant. It was like someone flipped a switch and the room went from night to day. I could see our art on the walls again. The bright orange of our standing mixer in the kitchen. The sinks gurgled as water that had pooled was now free to drain. 

It was dead. 



—-



It’s been several months since then. My girlfriend lives. She told me it felt like sleep paralysis. Or like the anesthesiologist got it wrong and she had woken up during an operation. There was pain, so much pain, but she could not cry out. She dreamed of a personal hell, which took the form not of flames but of watching life carry on without her. She saw her friends die, me die, our cat die. We think the parasite showed her these images to feed off of her pain. She was forced to live multiple lives worth of suffering while entombed in the egg. This has clearly taken a toll on her mind. She is distant, and can’t or won’t tell me what she is thinking about. I think she has seen things no human has ever seen. I think she knows what it feels like to be truly alone. 

But she lives. Every day a little bit of her old self shines through. This too shall pass. 

I’ve spent much of the last several months thinking about the priest. He sacrificed himself to save us, it seems, because he knew what the creature could have turned into. I wondered what the world would look like if it was all covered in the mire. I looked to his tome for answers, but the next time I checked it all the pages had gone blank. Like they were linked magically to his life or something. I don’t know. 

The only piece of evidence that he was ever even here is a flap of skin that the monster left behind. The piece of skin where he had the symbol of his organization tattooed. I treated it with formaldehyde to halt decomposition. 

I’ve spent many nights unable to sleep, sitting up in bed, staring down at the skin. 

I know that sounds insane. I know none of this probably makes any sense to you. Believe me, it wasn’t that long ago that I would have scoffed at the idea of secret societies and demons. But the part that bothers me the most? 

I think the priest could talk directly with God.
