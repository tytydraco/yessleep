That thing took the top I had laid over Natalie’s face.

Not only that, it had forced her head at an awkward angle so that she was staring at me. Her skin swollen and pale under the dim light. Eyes wide open, jaw unhinged and contorted awkwardly on her face from the mere aggressiveness of its hold from when it had forced her bones to grind against riga mortis, until she was gazing at me from the ground. It was horrifying enough knowing that there had been heaps of dead bodies below my feet but having to stare at a face I had seen alive only a day prior was far worse. It was someone that I knew, someone that I cared about. It twisted my stomach in a way that I can’t describe. 

The puss and weird greasy liquid that had spilled from her had hardened against stony flesh and begun to smell even more pungent as time passed me by. Her limbs rigid and heavy. I know this because I tried to move her so that I didn't have to gaze into the milky whites of her eyes anymore. It didn’t work, she was too hard to shift, my knees sliding across the stained floor until I landed harshly on top of her chest.  It was only then that the tears finally came. 

Grief ran freely down my cheeks as I gently brushed my fingertips over her eyes until the lids closed. The otherwise silent space broken by the desperate repetition of broken apologies tumbling from my lips. 

When I looked down at her face, ignoring the mess of flesh that hung in ribbons around a still form, I could almost convince myself that she was sleeping. 

It was the only solace I was ever going to get, the only kind of closure. 

I hate the fact that I left her there. 

but...  I managed to get out. 

You’re probably wondering how.

It was no easy task and I was fully prepared to die trying when the opportunity arose. 

After the wretched thing had scuttled into the darkest corners of this place, I had sat motionless for an indiscernible amount of time. Thinking myself in circles until I tried to distract my addled mind by writing. 

Something caught my eye however when I noticed a familiar light emanating from somewhere deep within the pit that sat now only feet from my hunched position at the desk. It was a sickly green hue, reminiscent of the fire exit sign. 

 It had bore no importance at the time but something compelled me to peer over the edge. 

Now that there was a light shining up towards me, instead of the meek display of the laptop. I could see a door under the faint glow. It illuminated the dead in a new way, adding an almost spectral radiance to the mass of bodies just below me. Nothing about it looked inviting but what else was I going to do at this point?. The door looked open and that was enough for me. I needed to get out of here, and if that meant I was going to have to climb down a mountain of decay to do it, then that's exactly what I was going to fucking do. 

Before I had a chance to steel my nerves and jump headlong into the hole at my feet a strange, almost animalistic cry echoed through the air. I glanced out at the open space, unsure of where it was coming from. Wherever it was though, it was getting closer. In a frantic attempt to hide I nearly fell over my own feet as I squished myself under the desk, pulling the chair flush against the gap. Hoping that the darkness would be enough to shroud me from view. No sooner than I had ceased all movement a figure emerged. I nearly choked on my own tongue when the face that greeted me was none other than Natalie herself. Only the expression she wore was wrong. Eyes devoid of kindness, darkened and primal as it skulked closer to the real body of my friend. It spared only a fleeting glance toward her before scanning the area I was usually hauled up in. 

And then, in a voice that sounded uncannily like Natalie's, it spoke. 

“Tyler?” 

A pregnant pause permeated the air, both waiting in anticipation for the other to react and when no such thing happened in a soft tone it uttered “It’s me”  

When I refused to yield to its attempts at misdirection its face twisted in irritation and in a harsher and almost deeper tone it growled.

“Tyler” 

I watched as it tilted its head, listening for any kind of noise. A blank expression stretched across stolen skin. Until it flicked its gaze back toward Natalie. Forgoing its search for me to straddle her, crouching down low enough that the frayed ends of its hair dragged over frozen features, a low chittering from the back of its throat buzzed through the drums of my ears as it gawked at its prey. 

A twinge of discomfort pinched at the muscles in my back as I tried desperately to stay as still as possible. I was surprised that it hadn't noticed me, considering this thing lived and breathed the darkness, before it took its stolen form. But who was I to question it, currently I was safe and that was all that mattered. 

I could feel anger flare deep within my gut when it trailed its painted nails down Natalie’s face. The tips digging harshly into her features. 

And then its slow movements stilled, head snapping to the right when the sound of a rapidly approaching shuffling stole both of our attention. It was difficult to see at first but crawling up on all fours was the second one. I hadn’t really taken much time in observing the way it looked before but now, as I sat folded into the tiny space below the desk my eyes raked over its slender form. 

Its skin had a greyish tint to it, almost reminiscent of a corpse, the thin layer stretched over emaciated bones, all sharp angles and pointy features. It moved unlike anything I had seen before. Almost too quick for its stature, limbs just that little bit too long as it scuttled across the ground. It had a humanesque physique, two legs and two arms but the limbs bent awkwardly at the joints, keeping itself low to the ground. Only lifting its head when it came to a stop beside the other. Its head twitched left and right a few times before echoing the chittering sound back at Natalie’s imposter. 

And then the one on the ground sat itself at the feet of the other, jaw dislocating as it opened its maw to an impossibly large size, rows of tiny razor sharp teeth littering the inside of its throat. The tips glinting under the weak light. 

I never did deal with the sight of puke well. But what came next assaulted almost every sense I had. Standing from its crouched position the thing wearing Natalie’s face began to heave. Not unlike a cat trying to dislodge a particularly stubborn hair ball, back arching up and down with every deep wretch and then, as if someone had turned on a tap a thick dark sludge poured from its mouth directly into the waiting gullet below it. The smell hit me like a fret train. It burned the inside of my nostrils and coated my throat with the stench of rotten meat as the reminisce of dead animals, fingers and conjelled and matted balls of hair tangled in its teeth. I could still see parts of the scalp it had been torn from dangling from the strands. 

I watched on through squinted eyes, a grimace pulling at the corners of my mouth as every last drop was swallowed down. 

One thing was for certain though, these things could come and go freely from this place, this new revelation reaffirmed the eagerness I felt to flee it thrummed under my skin but I had to wait until they left. 

I don't think the one that fed the other is all that fussed about where I am. It knows I’m close and thinks I can't leave this place. That’s probably why it hasn't tried all that hard to find me. 

I'll give them credit, they aren't stupid. 

They stayed longer than I thought they would. My body shaking from the strain of staying hidden for so long. At one point I was sure they were simply not going to leave but I was fortunately proven wrong. In the end, the one walking Natalie’s skin around made its way into the hole. Confirming my theory, the other found its way toward the wracking, using far too much agility to climb the twisted metal. During its ministrations however, it had grabbed at a loose beam, accidently pulling it free, it tumbled with a hash clang down onto the ground. 

I could use that for protection. 

I waited at least another ten minutes before I finally slid out from under the desk. I wanted to be sure that they weren't coming back.  They had never openly called for me before, never walked directly into the only part of the warehouse that felt semi safe. Which meant that the intention had changed and I certainly didn't need to be followed when I went for the door. 

If it was still even open that is. 

That thought stunted my enthusiasm in one fell swoop. If I jumped down onto the heap of bodies, I was not getting back up. So if I wasn't able to get through the door I would be stuck indefinitely marinating in the smell of death. 

Squaring my shoulders, I curled my fingers around the jagged piece of metal. The weight of it heavy in my hand. I had to do this. 

I knew that if this failed, there was only one other way to get this nightmare to end. 

And if it came to it? I wouldn't even think twice.

I wasn't going to allow them to use me as some sort of fucked up womb to bring more of those abominations into the world. 

I had been lucky in finding an old ratty fleece stuffed inside the boxes I had flattened when I clambered under the desk. It was thin and dirty but I didn't care, it was enough to take the biting edge off the cold. I had grown semi used to it anyway at this point. 

I wasn't sure of what was waiting for me on the other side of that door, this place had somehow kept me alive without food or water so I really could be dead or only alive because I’m here. I could end up back in reality and simply drop on the spot because due to the laws of life I was used to, that's what should have happened days ago. 

I pulled my arms through old material and did my best to steel my nerves, my hands shook all the same. I was about to face a mountain of bodies and from what I could see, all of their eyes were open. Well all those that still had eyes. 

It sent an unpleasant shudder down my spine. 

Walking over to the drop I crouched down and tried to determine if the fall would, under normal circumstances, kill me but it didn't seem too far down. My scrutinizing stare instinctively skittered off to the side when I accidentally gazed into the green eyes of the little girl. 

It really was now or never. 

My shoulders slumped, I could feel the burn of guilt against my back where Natalie lay. I didn't want to leave her in a place like this. She should be coming with me, not lying motionless on the floor but this was the harsh reality of it all. An unsaid promise floated between us before I dangled my feet over the pit. I would find a way to kill the thing that stole her from life. Regardless of the repercussions I may face. 

In a strange way, falling through the air felt kind of freeing, it was terrifying and exhilarating all at once. The adrenaline in my veins pumping the blood through my system at a rapid pace as I landed harshly against stiff bone. 

I had slightly misjudged where I would land and upon impact I felt myself careening to the side, hands shooting out desperately to find purchase. As I dug my hold into the mass of flesh below me, I felt my fingers press against something that felt alarmingly like jelly, there was a pop and they sunk in deeper. To my horror I realised that I had just sunk my index finger into the eye socket of one of their victims. I cringed, pulling myself upright as quickly as possible to relinquish my hold. 

Rubbing the slimy consistency across dirty jeans, I took stock of my position, head tipping back to look at the edge I had only moments ago been staring over. There really was no going back now. 

It was much darker than I had expected and it took me a few minutes to locate the metal beam I had dropped down before I followed suit, trying my hardest to ignore what I was standing atop. I sighed with relief when my fingers brushed a cold surface. Bringing the object close to my chest I began my unsteady descent further into the pit. The dim glow of green lighting my way just barely. 

The smell was rancid. It hung in the air like a thick blanket. Dense and hard to push through but after what felt like an eternity I stumbled over the last limb, still instinctively trying to mind my step. Not that it would have mattered but It felt disrespectful clambering over these poor people. 

I thought I was home free, the door was open and to my utmost shock I could see my own living room staring back at me across the threshold. It didn't make any kind of sense and alarm bells were sounding somewhere at the back of my mind but the fundamental instinct to stay alive shot me forward. I felt the air shift when my left foot breached the doorway. I was almost there, almost home! But in an instant I felt something grab at the back of the fleece and just like that I was ripped from the doorway and thrown backwards. 

I cried out in surprise and pain as I crashed against the floor. Breath well and truly knocked from my lungs. My eyes trailed across the dark space, the ice cold maw of impending doom chewed at the nerve endings under my skin.  

And then there was a shift in the darkness.

Feeling my adrenaline spike tenfold. I gripped the floor beneath me and pushed myself to my feet. The hairs across my skin rising.

I waited, and listened. 

The sound of laboured breathing and low chittering floated in the space. My heart cracking against a tight chest. 

The odd breathing permeating from the darkness began to pick up in what seemed like excitement and anticipation, as if on the precipice of a giggle. I had to do something, I couldn't just stand here and wait for it to do whatever it wanted to do with me, not when I was this close to getting out.

My hands shakily tightened on the metal beam in my grasp.

“Tyler”  

The words came out in a mixture of low and high tones, as if it was trying to find the right pitch. The serrated edge of fear cut brutally down my spine. Sweat began to bead on the back of my neck but I was not going to give this thing the satisfaction. 

“Come on then! You fucking asshole” I goaded, waving the beam slightly. 

Apparently that had been all it needed. It was so quick. Too quick. 

It was on me in an instant, pinning me to the floor with its entire weight. It peered down at me, features set in a monotone stare. 

I swung the piece of metal with as much force as I could muster, cracking it across the side of the head. I felt the disjointed bones in its face crack under the force. Neck snapping to the left. It didn't so much as move an inch from on top of me, its elongated fingers digging further into supple flesh. 

We stayed like that for a minute, as I glared up it its fucked up face. All the fear, all the anger that had been building up over the weeks I had been stuck in this shitshow leaking out of me in ragged breaths and clenched teeth. I wound my arm back “You fucking!” Metal hit flesh “Piece of motherfucking-” my arm burned from the repetitive motion “shit!” With one final blow I screamed in frustration, spittle flying across uncaring features. 

It was bleeding, some kind of yellowish ooze. Still seemingly unphased. I watched its lips twitch, eyes focussing on my own face before it spoke back to me “You motherfucking piece of shit” 

And there it was, my voice mirrored back to me, the only difference being the pure lack of emotion as it parretted my words. 

I watched as it tried to copy my expression, its sunken eyes gazing down at me with a fear that I knew it did not feel. Its front teeth bared in an awkward attempt to copy my own grimace. 

Discarding the beam I bucked and writhed under its weight, my overgrown nails embedding into its face, I clawed at its skin in anguish. I could feel how it peeled and clung to the underside of my fingernails but I did not stop, not even when my stomach started doing flips as its weird bodily fluids dripped across my skin. 

And then the strangest thing happened. It wailed in pain and flung itself from me. Blindsided by confusion I faltered, movements stilling momentarily before instincts kicked in and I was scrambling across the floor toward the doorway. I spared a glance backward. 

It was clutching at what looked scarily like a human umbilical cord, it hung from its abdomen, slender hands cupping the area protectively. I must have pulled on it when I was wriggling about underneath it. 

Good.  

I slammed the door shut. 

It never followed me through. 

I had no idea how or why that damn exit led to my house but any and all logic was overwrought with an intense relief that washed over. It brung me to my knees on the soft carpet. My fingers cascading repetitively through fuzz. I sat there for a good hour, before gorging myself on food and nearly drowning myself in fresh water. All of the small comforts of everyday life felt like a blessing in those moments. I would never take any of it for granted again. 

It took me a while to investigate the door, worried that I would open it to find the uninviting dark staring back at me, but instead the outside world had greeted me and I had tears streaming down my face again. I must have looked fucking mental when I had run out into the garden and laid in the grass until the winter sun set. 

I only wish that sense of euphoria had lasted longer than it had. Thoughts of Natalie floated about my head. I felt guilty for being where I stood. Free of that place. Whilst she rotted in the dark, alone. 

Tomorrow I start doing some research. 

But for now. I'm going to sleep. 

In an actual fucking bed.
