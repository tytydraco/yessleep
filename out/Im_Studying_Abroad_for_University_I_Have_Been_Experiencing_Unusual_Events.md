As a teenager from a third-world country, I always had "leaving my country" as one of my priorities. Frankly, I never understood one's love for their own home country. If it was shitty, especially. The way I view it, no country is innocent. Governments consist of sick fucks that shouldn't be where they at. It's stupid in the first place to expect humans to be put in a position of power and not be corrupted at some point, but let's not get off-topic here. That's not what I'm here to talk about. 

I have been studying in the US for a couple of months now. I got a fully paid scholarship that I completely believe I deserved through my exceptional hard work. I studied. A lot. It got to the point that I was being made fun of by my friends for studying so much and not engaging in any kind of activities with them. Well, guess what, losers. There's a reason why I'm here and you're all still in \[CENSORED\]. Anyway, since I came here, I haven't really been experiencing many difficulties. I may have gone through a couple of complications here and there with the cooking and the money, but you know, those are basic issues you face when you're alone in a country thousands of miles away from the one you lived in your whole life. I was already expecting these minor problems. What I haven't been expecting, however, is whatever has been happening since last week.

Friday night, I was preparing to study. I had my laptop, my books, my headphones, my notes, and my drinks ready. It was 10 pm. I sat down and began my daily night shift of trying to learn so I can stay here and not get sent back to my home country. A couple of minutes in, I grabbed my soda can and realized it was empty. I shook it confusingly then looked inside it. Shit had no single drop of soda in there. I stared at it for a couple of seconds then just threw it in the trash and shrugged the whole thing off. What happened after was weirder. I looked at the time on my laptop. It was 2 in the morning. 

"The fuck?"

I said as I kept looking in disbelief. I looked at my phone. 2 am. I looked behind me and found my roommate, Charles, lying in his bed, asleep. I did not recall any moment of Charles entering the room. Usually, he comes very late on weekends, drunk to the point he needs help walking. And usually, I helped him reach his bed after his friends drove him here. Him just lying there meant that I got up, helped him lie in his bed, then sat down again to resume my studying. I tried thinking of any rational explanation of this whole thing, but nothing made sense. I concluded that I must have been very tired; after that day, I tried having a rest day. No studying, just chilling. Things only got more strange. 

More parts of my day were just... missing. At first, I was forgetting whether I used the bathroom or not, whether I called my family or not, or whether I did my morning workout routine. Then, things got so bizarre that I wouldn't doubt someone else was in control of my body. I had no memories of ordering three burgers and eating them (I don't even like burgers) on Sunday, or buying new shirts with "What Yo Mama Wants" with an arrow pointing at my crotch and "Press Ur Feet Here" with an arrow pointing at my face (I was not that type of guy; I did not think mothers were interested in what I had down there) on Monday, or watching adult videos with speakers that I apparently bought at some point (I ALWAYS watch with no volume) on Tuesday. 

It is Friday today. What happened this morning was creepier than all of the previous events. The room I live in is humbly small and simple, with bunk beds on the right side, two desks next to each other on the left side, and a window in the middle. Charles sleeps on the bottom bunk, and I sleep on the upper one, which is close to the window. Charles leaves early. I don't know what he does, nor do I care. This morning, I jolted up to the sound of hard, aggressive pounding on the window, like an angry living next door person complaining about the loud porn noises.. (not my proudest moment) My eyes were stuck on the window as I backed up, my back pressed against the wall. The pounding didn't stop. In fact, it kept getting more and more violent. My heartbeat was racing faster than a dominating black athlete in a race, my forehead was dripping with so much sweat that I imagined it looked like it was melting, and my whole body was trembling, fearing the unknown source of the pounding. I was completely consumed by fear; my heart was pounding so hard it felt like it was just gonna stop completely at any moment. Then, the banging stopped. After a moment, I started processing that my head wasn't sweaty anymore, which was very weird because it should've taken a while before drying out, considering how much I was sweating. My eyes were stuck on the window, yet my brain never comprehended until I took a closer look. There was no glass. My eyes darted to the floor. Shattered into a million tiny pieces was the glass on the floor.

I cleaned the floor. Honestly, I still haven't told my university about the broken window. I'm worried they'll expel me or, at the very least, remove me from the dorms. There was no wind strong enough to absolutely destroy the glass like it did this morning. I'm also concerned about the memory loss or whatever I've been experiencing. Sounds like some Tyler Durden shit. Add to that the unexplainable banging. If you have any suggestions about the weird phenomena I have been going through, please let me know, I'll appreciate it much. If you can also help me figure out what to tell my university about the window, I'll be more than thankful.
