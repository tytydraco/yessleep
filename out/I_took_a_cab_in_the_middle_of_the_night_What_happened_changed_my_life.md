I woke up at 2 a.m., feeling ravenous. The hunger I was feeling was powerful, I couldn’t sleep I just had to get something to eat. 



I went downstairs to my disgusting kitchen and opened the fridge.



“Damn,” I thought



The only thing I had in my fridge was a bottle of expired milk. At that time I didn’t know it was expired, so I drank it. 



The dreadful feeling of extreme hunger tortured me, I just had to get some food.



I unlocked my phone and ordered a cab. The driver swiftly arrived at my house which did not surprise me, since it was the middle of the night. I walked up to the car and saw a man. Almost everything about this individual was boring and average, but the one thing that stood out was his eyes. They looked dead and were red, he looked like he had just smoked weed. 



At first, I was reluctant about getting in, but I ignored that feeling and got inside the car. 



“Take me anywhere they food,” I said to the creepy man



“Well, what are you looking for?” he answered.



“Anything,” I said



“What about getting something exotic” the man uttered in a terrifying voice



That sentence horrified me. It was the way he said it that erected that grim feeling in me. After a second I realized that it was probably nothing and that I was making stuff up. 



“Yeah, sure” I answered unenthusiastically.



“Great!” The man yelled 



That blaring yell almost made me faint, it was all because I got drunk last night playing a drinking game with my friends. The man accelerated and reached a great speed in seconds, I was terrified.



We got about 5 miles from my house before I started getting even more creeped out. Why did we have to drive so far to get to this restaurant? I kept asking the guy about the ETA of this ride, but he kept saying the same thing



“We’ll be there soon” the creep kept on saying



I was beginning to spiral. It only took me a few minutes to start thinking that he was going to kill me. That’s when I got a phone call. It was a private number, I usually don’t answer calls from these types of numbers, but I had to do something to get this situation off my mind. 



I answered the call.



“Where the fuck are you! I’ve been waiting for you for 30 minutes. You better believe I'm going to be charging you for this!“ The unknown man screamed



“What are you talking about, I got into a car, like 40 minutes ago” I replied



“I don’t know what the hell you’re on about, but I'm out of here!” he yelled



He hung up. 



“Can we please pull over??” I asked the driver



“No” he answered formidably 



“What’s going on here? I just got a call from an unknown number insisting that he was my driver” I replied



“Well, he probably was,” said the impostor 



That sentence sent shivers down my spine. I completely forgot about my esurient state; the only thing on my mind was getting out of this vehicle. 



The only possible resolution at that moment was to attack the man and take control of the car.



I punched him in the head, he didn’t take it well. He lost control of the car and we hit a tree. Thankfully I was fully conscious and I wasn’t injured. I looked at where the driver was sitting and thought he passed out. I was ecstatic and I thought that I was finally free, but that’s when he suddenly woke up and stabbed me in the neck with a syringe. 



I passed out almost immediately.

 

After I woke up I started puking profusely, it was probably caused by either the expired milk I drank earlier or the mixture of chemicals in the syringe. I started panicking, thinking I was going to die, but then the lights came on. 



“I know you wanted to try something exotic, so I made you something I knew you would love,” said a familiar voice.

Suddenly the lights turned on, I looked down and screamed with horror.



“My legs! They’re fucking gone!” 



The sadistic monster laughed with glee.



“Exactly, they're gone and that’s what you’re going to eat tonight” 



“You disgusting creep, how dare you!” 



He didn’t respond. He just left.



I sat there, stuck for hours, crying thinking about stuff I could never do again because of this psychopath. 



After hours of mental torture, he came back 



‘I am going to love this” said the sadist



He walked over to me and put a blindfold around my eyes. He then unblocked the wheels on the wheelchair I was sitting on and rolled me over to a different room. 



The man took off the blindfold and what I saw deeply disgusted me. I saw a table full of different dishes that mainly consisted of meat from my legs. I was surprised that I didn’t hurl. 



I was frightened, but that was only the beginning. 



I started yelling, telling the guy I wasn’t going to eat my legs, but in that moment he whipped out a pistol and told me that if I didn’t eat it he was going to kill me and my entire family. 



I reluctantly started eating one of the dishes and ate until I finally saw the look of satisfaction on his face. I told him I was done eating, he seemed pleased with what he had accomplished.



After he put all the dishes back in a different room he walked up to me, put a knife on the table, put a gun in his mouth, and killed himself. The sound of the gun and the sight of a man's brain being splattered all over the wall scarred me for life.



I then remembered that he had left a knife on the table. I pulled myself to the edge of the surface, turned myself around, and grabbed the knife. I was lucky that he had only tied my chest to the chair, but thinking about it now I am pretty sure he did it on purpose. 



After I escaped from the chair I crawled over to the exit. After I got out the door I saw that this place was in the middle of a city, the second I came out there was a swarm of people surrounding me.

The one thing that I wasn’t expecting was that I deeply enjoyed eating human flesh. It was more like love. I was obsessed instantly. I never considered myself a bad person and I still don’t think I am, I just have needs that most people don’t and I think that is fine. Sure, most people would think I am a monster, but all of them have never tried the beauty that is human flesh. I want to end this by thanking my unexpected driver, for introducing me to this wonderful world of cannibalism.
