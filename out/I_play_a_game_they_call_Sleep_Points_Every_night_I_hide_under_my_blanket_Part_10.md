“Where is your truck?” asked Anastasia, a bit sternly.

“I didn’t take it today.  I just walked.” I responded.  Since she didn’t seem too thrilled by the fact that I had walked in the cold instead of taking my car, I figured that was probably the wrong answer.  But I was too focused on my foot to really worry about it.

We walked to her room.  Or at least Anastasia walked.  I just kinda hobbled over, trying not to put on any pressure on my left foot, which was still in pain from making contact with the vomit or whatever type of sludge it was that I had no interest in thinking too hard about.  She pulled out the same chair from her desk for me to sit on, just like the night before.

“Sit down.  You appear to be in pain,” she said.  I was hoping I wouldn’t have to explain myself, since I really didn’t wanna talk about it, but since it was apparently so clear to her that I was suffering, I told her about it anyway.

“Yeah, so, like, there was this really disgusting-smelling puke-looking stuff outside your backyard that I musta stepped in,” I explained.  This seemed to give Anastasia pause.  I figured I should probably tell her about the pain I was in, so that way, hopefully, she could diagnose what had gone horribly wrong now. “Only for some reason, now it really hurts,” I finished.  Funnily enough, the fact that I was in pain from the revolting fluid outside seemed to ease whatever fears she seemed to have previously.  Then, she started acting as though this was all par for the course.

“I see, and so you are in pain because you made contact with the fluid outside?” she asked.

“Yeah.  I was all good until I stepped into whatever the hell that was,” I clarified.

“That would be the Activation Fluid,” explained Anastasia.

“I’m sorry, the what?” I asked, because, whatever it was, it did not sound good.  And it sure as hell didn’t feel good.

“The Activation Fluid is the fluid that, once it has ran its course, will activate Stage Two.  First, it makes contact with the skin, then travels up the spinal cord and through the brainstem, until finally it reaches the hypothalamus, which it attacks, along with the hippocampus and the amygdala, among other assorted subcortical regions of the limbic system.  The process will be complete in approximately 36 hours.  The combined damage will primarily result in insomnia, though there will likely also be side-effects such as short-term memory loss, mood swings, and, most relevant to our purposes, navigational complications.

Which brings me to an important point:  From now on, you will take one of your parents’ phones and use the GPS feature to make your way here.  After the Activation Fluid sets in, you will no longer be capable of finding your way here and back to your home once again without a navigational aid.  And you will not allow for your own cell phone to die,” she concluded.

“But what if the phone I’m taking with me dies?” I asked.

“Ensure that it is fully charged.  Because the phone you will be taking will not have Sleep Points downloaded, its battery life will last much longer than yours.  If it is fully charged, it will last the trip here and back,” she said.  “Especially if one were to arrive by automobile,” she added, in a way that sounded kinda passive-aggressive.

“This brings me to another point, Morgan.  How long were you outside?” She asked, in the same somewhat stern tone of voice that she had when she greeted me at the door by asking where my dad's truck was.

“About 25 minutes,” I answered, since that was about how long I spent meandering around her backyard.

“Now, how did you arrive at my home in 25 minutes on foot?” she asked, very skeptical of what I had just told her.

“Well, that was just how long I was kinda hanging around your backyard.  I thought that was all you meant.” I told her.

“How long had it been since you were indoors?  You got here on foot.  How long was it from the time you left your home until you entered mine?”  She asked me, in the same stern tone of voice as before.

“Well, I left my house at about midnight.  I knew it would be a long walk here.  Two hours maybe?”, I said.

“You should have taken the truck”, she said.

“Why?  I still made it here in time.  I made it with time to spare.  And you saw how bundled up I was.”, I said.

“Morgan, your time of arrival is not my primary concern.  The fact of the matter is that it is negative 14 degrees Celsius outside.  7 degrees Fahrenheit, if you prefer.

You could have suffered severe hypothermia.  If you have not already on the way here, then there is a high likelihood you will on the way back”, She said.  “In fact, it would appear to me that you already have.  Your constant shivering, even within closed doors inside a home with strong heating, in tandem with your somewhat slurred speech are indeed quite concerning signs and symptoms,” she said.

I had no idea I was slurring my words.  But I guess I shouldn’t have been too surprised to hear it, given that I was starting to get pretty light-headed.  Although, in my defense, that might’ve also had something to do with the fact that I had been up for over 36 hours by then, since I hadn’t gone to sleep the night before.  Not because of insomnia, though.  I probably could’ve gone to sleep pretty easily if I had wanted to.  It was just that it was already so close to morning, and I didn’t want my sleep schedule ruined by passing out at sunrise.

And then when it came to the shivering, there was the fact that her fan was always on at full force with her air vents blaring.  It was definitely nowhere near as cold as it was outside, but in my defense, it was still a bit chilly in there.

Anastasia then headed over to her clock, took the blanket off from over top of it, and handed it to me.

“This blanket was a gift to me.  It will insulate you from whatever cold weather you encounter on your journey back.  No matter how cold your environment should become, you will be entirely protected.  You will take this with you for the trip back.” She said, flatly.

“How is this super light blanket with a bunch of holes in it gonna protect me from the cold better than all the layers I took the time to put on?” I asked, now becoming the one to be skeptical of her, rather than the other way around.

“How does a blanket protect you from The Sandman?” she said, as The Sandman’s face once again flashed out of the corner of my eye, as if he was in the room with us.  “It is the same principle.  Blankets have protective power,” she explained.

“So what, I should’ve just taken a blanket with me on my way up and just like that, I would’ve been all good?” I asked, still skeptical of her claims.

“As I stated previously, this particular blanket was a gift.  A gift because of its unique ability to protect the wearer from the cold.  None of the blankets in your possession would be imbued with such a property.  Due to the fact that I consistently sleep with my head under my blanket, it is very crucial that I leave the fan on and ensure that the vents to my room function as powerfully as possible such that the airways into my blanket get as much fresh air as possible, instead of the same stagnant air that I breath out as I sleep.  In doing so, I must make it very cold in my room.

On nights such as this, it can become quite challenging to sleep, due to the cold.  While yes, my room does have heating, there come nights that are cold to such an extent that the heating system is simply insufficient, and I still find it difficult to sleep peacefully.  I could, of course, use a thicker blanket, but I do not use one because that does not allow for the free flow of air as well as this one.  Also, because no blanket, no matter how thick, will insulate the wearer nearly as well as this one.  Therefore, I use that blanket to shield myself from whatever cold might be keeping me up,” explained Anastasia.

“You said this blanket was a gift.  Who gave it to you?”, I asked.

“One with the ability to make such things,” answered Anastasia.

“And who would that be?  That’s pretty vague,” I responded.

“It need not concern you.  Trust that it will function in the manner that I have described,” she said.  I wasn't entirely certain if I should've.  She seemed to have the annoying habit of avoiding questions she didn’t like, which made me wonder if I should trust her.  But she had never lied to me.  Even after all this time since all of this happened, I still can’t think of a single time she has.

The obvious exception that comes to mind, though, is how she said she kept that blanket over her clock to stop herself from checking the time.  But even what she said there, while not exactly the full truth, would turn out not to be false either, in her defense.  That really was one of the reasons why.

“You say you need it to sleep on cold nights.  Well, tonight is pretty cold, doncha think?  Are you sure you’ll be able to sleep okay without it?” I asked.

“If not, then I have alternative methods that I can turn to, if absolutely necessary,” explained Anastasia.

“’Alternative methods’ such as?” I asked.

“It need not concern you,” she repeated.  “On the next occasion in which we convene, you will return the blanket to me.  Do not ever walk here again.  Have I made myself clear to you?” she asked, very seriously, now.  She still seemed pretty upset about how I hadn’t arrived in my Dad’s truck.  I didn’t know if I should tell her about the incident with Ezra from the night before, but I figured it’d be no use.

It was pretty clear to me that she wasn’t gonna be argued out of this.  She wasn’t gonna have it with me. Even if I told her everything that had happened, there was no way she was about to change her mind.

Annie was never exactly the changing-her-mind type.  She always would if she knew she had to, but she never did normally.  I guess I’m kinda the type to be talked into something or out of it fairly easily.  I’m not very proud to be like that, but if I’m being honest, it’s kinda true.  Anastasia, though, was pretty different.  She could be quite the stubborn girl when she wanted to be.  And at that moment, it sure looked to me like she did.  So, I just dropped it.

“Now then,” said Anastasia, clapping her hands together.  “I must ensure that you are as prepared as possible for Stage Two.”  She said.

“Is there any way I could use my Sleep Points to help with that?  I still don’t really know what to do with them.”  I told her.

“We shall discuss that topic later, Morgan.  Have you been keeping your phone charged?” She asked.

“Yes.” I responded, pretty annoyed by how she was avoiding my question.

“Good, good.  I have spoken with you about the importance of not allowing for your phone’s battery to die, correct?” She said.

“Yep.  Just last night, actually.” I said.  This must've been the short-term memory loss she was telling me about.

“Excellent.  And where have you been keeping your phone?” She asked.

“In my room.  I mean, that’s kinda where I tend to be.  Why would I have in anywhere else?” I asked back, a bit confused by her question.

“Does your home possess an outlet in any location other than your room?” She asked.

“Yeah, downstairs in the living room.” I said.

“Keep your phone there.  Do not leave it in your room.  You will look at it.  It will keep you up.  Did I ever tell you why I keep a blanket over my clock?” She asked.

“Yeah,” I said.  “You did.  Just last night you were telling me all about how it’s so you don’t get distracted by the time.” I said.  Even though I was sure I was being told a bald-faced lie.  I had seen The Sandman slowly starting to burst his way out of her clock.  I knew she was trying to hide it from me with bullshit excuses like that.  But I had to keep up the charade.

She just loved keeping me in the dark.  She wouldn’t be honest about how The Sandman could strike well after midnight.  And on weekends.  She wouldn’t open up about how she had gotten the blanket that she gave me to keep warm.  She immediately changed the subject when I asked her about what I could do with my Sleep Points.  And worst of all, apparently, she had this sure-fire way of falling asleep that she wasn’t telling me about, even though I could probably use it for Stage Two.

I figured she must’ve had some kind of excuse about how this was “protecting” me or something.  I couldn’t tell her what I saw through her window.  I couldn’t let her about what I knew.  About all the things that would, sooner or later, be in store for me as well, as the game went on and the Stages started ramping up.  Of course, at the time, I still didn’t even know the half of it.  Not even close.  All thanks to Annie.  She could’ve warned me.  But no.  But hey, I'm sure she'd say she had her reasons.

None of this is even to mention how she had avoided my question from the previous night about how Sleep Points was gonna somehow give me brain damage.  I was nearly scared half to death when the Activation Fluid started burning my skin and slowly started to slither into the back of my heel.  But at least she was telling me about it now.  And when I confronted her about why she hadn’t warned me about it the night before, since I had been pretty upset about that, she did honestly seem to have a pretty decent reason that we’ll get to when it comes up.

“Precisely.”, said Anastasia, responding to the answer I gave her about why she kept the clock under her blanket.  “And do you know what else is a distraction?”

She asked, as if it wasn’t already painfully obvious.

“Phones.”, I responded dully.

“Correct.  From now on, you will keep your phone out of arms reach.  Your phone can distract you from the sleep you will need to ward him off.  Not only that, but the blue light itself that your cellular telephone eminates will also make it more difficult to achieve restfulness.  Keep the temptation as far away as possible,” she concluded.

“Now then, on to my next point: What is your nighttime routine?” she asked.

“I guess I just turn my phone off and tuck myself in whenever I get tired, or I feel like its getting late,” I answered.

“And do you have a particular time at which you tuck yourself in for the night?” she asked.

“Not really.  Pretty much whenever I get tired, or I feel like it’s getting late.  I guess it varies,” I answered, with the sneaking suspicion that that wasn’t exactly what she was going for.

“And that right there is the problem, Morgan.  It varies.  It should not vary.  Your circadian rhythm must be consistent.  You will go to sleep at a consistent time of night, whether it is a school night or not. I would recommend 9 PM,” she said.

“Ugh.  But that’s so early,” I moaned.

“I am aware that you likely are in the habit of going to sleep much later than this.  I suppose I can, in part, blame myself for this.  I am sure that our nightly meetings are of no assistance.  But this is precisely why, from now on, you will go to sleep at 9 PM and then wake yourself up once it is time to get ready for our discussions, just as I do.  Since you will have to take the time to drive over here, this will of course mean that you will have to wake yourself up much earlier than I do.  While this will most likely disrupt your circadian rhythm, our meetings in which I advise you are still of higher priority than even that”, she explained.

“You will also get into the habit of taking a shower, brushing your teeth, and flossing before going to bed.  Based on the state of your breath and bodily odor, I presume you have the tendency to neglect both,” said Anastasia, pretty bluntly.

Well, that hurt.  I didn’t know it was so clear to people how often I skipped out on showering and brushing my teeth.  And to be called out like that by Anastasia of all people, the girl I spent so long crushing on, just made it all hit home even harder.  And it couldn’t have been the Activation Fluid that she was talking about.  Sure, it smelled absolutely rancid at first, but once it made contact with my skin, the smell went away entirely.  I always just figured I could trust myself to be good about showering and brushing when I needed to, but I guess she was right.  I wasn’t doing it nearly as often as I should’ve been.  I couldn’t even remember the last time I had actually taken the time to floss.

Well, I figured my parents and teachers would certainly be appreciating all of this.  I didn’t know how much other students would really care though.  It always seemed like kids my age, or at least boys my age, were just as bad as me when it came to hygiene stuff like this.  But maybe that was something else I was wrong about.  It probably was.  Everybody else was probably way more on top of things than me.  It wouldn’t have surprised me.  That always seemed to be the way things were.

“In addition, you will not use your cell phone for at least one hour prior to tucking yourself into bed”, said Anastasia.  “No matter how early you find my recommended bedtime of 9 PM to be, no matter the extent to which you resent my demands, you will follow them, nevertheless.  If you do not, I will know, and I will confront you”, she said, in the exact same stern tone of voice as before.

“How?  Literally how will you even know any of that?” I asked, starting to get frustrated with how unreasonable and strict I felt like she was being at the time.  Of course it wasn't really that unreasonable.  These were mostly all things I should've been doing anyway.  But I think it was the fact that she was apparently going to be watching me somehow which set me off more than anything else.  I guess it wasn't really the demands themselves so much as her chosen method of enforcement that was really getting to me.  Anyway, I had a pretty good guess as to how Anastasia was about to respond to all of this.

“It need not concern you,” she said, for like the millionth time.  Her favorite five words.

“Oh great.  How did I know that would be what you told me?” I asked, starting to lose my patience.

“Likely because you are giving me no choice but to respond in the same way time and time again, Morgan.  You consistently wish to ask questions, the answers to which, you are not yet ready to receive,” she claimed.

“Oh yeah?” I asked, starting to get a bit testy.  “Says who?  You?  Oh right.  I forgot.  You’re just the ultimate authority on everything aren’t you?  You say I’m not ready, so hey.  I guess I’m not.  What the fuck do I know, right?  I’m just some dipshit who has to listen to you.  ‘Cuz you just know everything, right?” I complained. “Cuz I just wouldn’t last a day on my own, without you,” I continued.  “Except oh wait.  I did.   Yeah, that’s right.  I guess you forgot.  I was in this game for over a week before you came along, telling me what to do all the time.  And you know what?  I was just fine,” I finished.

I’ll admit, I might’ve kinda lost my cool a bit there.  Okay, Okay.  So, I lost my cool completely.  I get it.  I know I shouldn’t downplay it.  But by then, I had had enough of being told I wasn’t allowed to hear answers to my most burning questions.  I just hoped Anastasia would understand.

“I am sure that you did.  The first Stage requires little guidance or instruction”, she said.

“Oh, so I guess that’s why, huh?  That’s why I could get through Stage One on my own?  Because it’s just so easy even some hapless idiot like me can pull it off, right?” I said, now raising my voice even more than before, my aggravation rising as the pain in my foot grew more and more intense.

“Very few individuals successfully navigate even the early Stages of Sleep Points by themselves.  I, myself, was no different.  I must advise against feeling so ashamed of yourself for requiring help.  Any player who wants to survive even the first two months needs it.  I did too,” Anastasia confessed, trying to deescalate the conversation, now that she could tell I was pretty seriously starting to lose my shit.

It really did seem to work, though.  Knowing that someone as smart and knowledgeable as Anastasia needed her fair share of help to find her way through Sleep Points as well did a lot to put my insecurities to bed.  I didn’t know if her mentor had been as strict as she was being with me, but either way.  If not even someone like her could figure this game out for themselves, then maybe I could begin to understand why she was being so insistent on making sure I always showed up to her house so that I could learn more, or at least whatever she decided I got to learn about that night.

I still felt pretty frustrated that she was always being so coy and secretive about everything, though.  But I figured I should have just been glad to learn about whatever she was willing to talk about.  I tried one last question to see where I could get with her.  Luckily, this time, I got an answer.

“My foot’s starting to seriously hurt.  I asked you yesterday how my brain was gonna be affected to the point where it would be hard to get 90 minutes of sleep all at once over three days.  Why didn’t you warn me about the Activation Fluid when I asked about it then?” I asked.

“I can understand the frustration you must feel.  However, if I had warned you about the Activation Fluid, you likely would’ve tried to avoid it at all costs.  And you eventually you would have failed.  The longer you avoided it, the worse the effects would have become.  The pain in your foot, the insomnia, the mood swings, everything would have intensified, the longer you put off making contact with it.  By not warning you of the very acute pain the Activation Fluid would cause you, I had hoped to ensure that you would receive it as soon as possible,” she explained.

I couldn’t really argue with this.  If I had known that the Activation Fluid was gonna be the reason behind my insomnia, I probably would’ve tried to avoid it like the plague.  Especially if she had gone into full detail about all the pain I’d be going through.  I calmed down a bit, now that I had at least some reason to believe that she wasn’t just tryna through the wool over my eyes and use her secretiveness as some kind of manipulation tactic.

“I know you don’t like not knowing things.  I understand it can be quite agitating.  But you must trust that when I withhold information from you, that it is for your own good.  I would not hide anything from you if it were not, according to my best understanding, in your best interest”, she claimed.

By now, the clock was starting to turn a slight shade of red, and since she gave me the blanket that she usually used to cover up her clock, it meant that it was already just about time to wrap things up.  Great.  I did all this work just to be nagged.  The only Sleep Points-related advice Annie ever gave me up until then, at least as far as that meeting went anyway, were all these overbearing demands to stay off my phone, take a shower, brush my teeth, and floss.  Gee thanks, mom.

“Our time together is coming to a close, so I will just ask you one more thing: How do you sleep at night?” She asked.  I was naturally pretty taken aback by the question.  Usually only hardened criminals guilty of the most serious offences are asked “How do you sleep at night?” What did she think I had done?  Did she know I had looked through her window?  Was that what this was about?

“Well, I guess I sleep pretty normally.  Why?  What’s that supposed to mean?” I asked, a bit shakily, assuming the worst.

“Well, when you go to sleep at night, how do you do it?  Do you sleep with your head outside of the blanket, or with your head underneath the blanket?” She asked.

“Outside the blanket.  I thought sleeping with your head under your blanket would suffocate you,” I said.   “But then you talked about how you always do it.  Do you sleep okay like that?” I asked.

“A blanket is far from airtight, Morgan.  You can still breathe quite well from underneath one.  Air can quite easily come through the sides of the blanket, as there will inevitably exist gaps between your blanket and the bedside.  Even then, the material a blanket is generally made out of is not air-tight either.  I do admit, it does make it somewhat harder for the air to reach you.  Carbon Dioxide will, indeed, build up.  This is why I spoke of sleeping with a fan on.  Better air circulation in your room will ensure the highest possible amount of fresh air underneath your blanket.  If you have any vents in your room, I also recommend sleeping such that your head is close to one.  That is what I do.

Between that and the fan, you should also sleep with a blanket, perforated with many small holes.  They will not disrupt the barrier the blanket forms between you and him.  The blanket that I received as a gift and am now lending to you is a fine example.  Ask your parents for one, if you do not already have one in your possession.  And if they cannot, or otherwise simply do not, give you one, then you will inform me.  I will have one prepared for you,”  she stated.

“Putting all these factors together, you should have ample air circulation in your room such that you will not suffocate from the stale air underneath your blanket.  You must get into the habit of sleeping with your head under your blanket as soon as possible.  Soon, he will be assessing whether you are awake or asleep upon breaking out of the clock.  Even if you are asleep, if your head is not protected by your blanket, you will still be at his mercy.” She concluded.

“Alright, got it.  But what if my parents come wake me up in the morning and see my head underneath the blanket?  What are they gonna think?” I asked her.

“Set an alarm.  Not on your phone.  On the clock.  It comes with an alarm.  It will always wake you,” she said.  The clock was getting a bit redder.  She was getting more and more desperate by the minute to get rid of me.

“How?” I asked.  “It isn’t an alarm clock.  It doesn’t have any bells.  Where's the alarm you're saying it comes with?”  I asked her.

“Not on its exterior.  However, within the clock, there is indeed an alarm.  An alarm that, without fail, will wake you up.  There is a button behind the clock.  Press it.  The glass will break.  Do not panic.  He will not attack you, just because the glass in front of the clock is broken.  Set the time at which you will require the clock to wake you simply by moving the hands with your fingers.  There is no AM or PM setting.  If you set the alarm to 8:00, for instance, it will wake you at 8 AM.  If you set the alarm for 3:00 it will wake you at 3 AM.  There is no need to worry about your clock’s alarm potentially going off in the evening instead of the morning.  Once the alarm has been set, the glass will be restored, and the clock’s hands will revert back to the position communicating the time at present.  To turn the alarm off, simply set the alarm to midnight.  The clock will never wake you at midnight”, she explained.

“You must go.  We have discussed a great deal tonight.”, she said.  “And when you come back, I want to see you in your parents’ car with at least one of their cellphones for navigational purposes.  Although I strongly advise against using your own, there is no excuse not to take one of theirs.  I do not wish to discover that you have gotten yourself lost again.”

Somehow, Anastasia found out about last night’s misadventure back home, already.  I had no idea how she did, though.  I just left with a pang of anxiety over what else she might’ve known.  Did she already know about my brush with death, thanks to Ezra?  Since she seemed to know so much already, it just gave me all the more reason to believe that she really would know if I wasn’t taking her advice.  I had no idea how, but she definitely would.

I left and put on the blanket Anastasia gave me.  It made no sense how a blanket this thin with so many holes to allow in the freezing cold air was gonna somehow protect me from that very same freezing cold air.  The physics just didn't add up at all.  But then again, she asked me to believe that it had been imbued with protective power.  So I tried it on.

Immediately, I felt as though it was a perfectly pleasant night outside.  All the cold astoundingly vanished, the moment I covered myself with it.  It made no sense.  But I had been through too much stuff that didn't make sense to bother asking.  I almost felt stupid for doubting.  Of course it didn’t make sense.  Duh.  I should’ve known better than to expect things to make sense by that point.

I took a look at my left foot since the pain was only getting worse and worse.  I sat down, in the snow, took off my shoe and sock, and turned on the glow in the dark feature on my College High watch.  I immediately regretted that, though, because now, not only was it in some pretty serious pain, it was also freezing.  It didn’t look too bad though.  There was a red splotch where the Activation Fluid had entered my skin.  I ran my hand over it, but of course, that only made the pain even worse.  The skin looked very tender and seemed felt inflamed, having the texture of a rash or sunburn.  But since the fluid seemed to have fully gotten under my skin, my foot was now totally dry, at least aside from the snow.

Making my way back, I honestly felt completely fine nearly the whole way.  At least temperature-wise.  My foot was still absolutely killing me.  I was at the point where I had to mainly hop on my right foot to make it back.  And the snow wasn’t making that any easier.  I used the Aurora up above to navigate my way all the way up to the last turn.  Not that I really needed them since I could pretty much just follow the road most of the way back.  But I did still need to know where that turn was, just to make sure I didn’t keep walking and miss it again.  Plus, I needed to be sure that I turned the right direction once I had made it to the intersection.

After that point, though, I would just need to keep on walking until eventually I made it home.  It was dark, so it was gonna be a bit tough to know if I had made it there, but that's why I kept my right foot on the grass and the left one on the road.  I knew that my neighborhood's driveways would be on my right, so if I felt pavement instead of grass underneath my foot, I would know that I was close to making it back.

I was walking normally on right foot, and sorta tiptoeing on my left, to make sure I didn’t put any pressure on my heel.  My dad drives an automatic, so if I had just listened to Anastasia and taken the truck, I could’ve made it the whole way back without even needing my left foot.  But oh well.  Too late for that now.

It wasn't until I made my way to the first house in my neighborhood that something frighteningly peculiar took place.  I could see the light in that house's living room on.  I wasn't expecting to.  I wasn't expecting anyone's lights to be on at that time of night, but that light was.  There was also what looked like a bedroom with its light on as well.  And suddenly, it wasn't.  Both rooms went dark at the exact same time.  It was a power outage.

I know power outages aren't really that scary, but this one was especially weird.  Because ya see, it wasn't just the lights in the house that went out all at once.  I looked up to the sky and saw that the aurora had spontaneously vanished completely.  One moment they were there, and now they weren't.  Just straight up gone.  All of a sudden, I was in absolute pitch darkness.  No light in the sky, no light from the houses on my street.  Nothing.

As if this wasn't all frightening enough, a thick red haze began to accumulate above that same house that I had seen have its lights go out.  It had a very light glow to it that I wouldn't have been able to see if it wasn't completely dark out by that point.  it grew in size and began to disperse itself across the entire sky.  I had no idea what to make of any of this.

But the worst part was the fact that I was now practically freezing to death.  Not only had the blanket stopped working to protect me from the cold, I was now feeling a cold that I never felt before in my life.  I wouldn't have been surprised if I had died of hypothermia right on the spot.  Obviously I didn't.  But it still felt like it could've happened.  I took the blanket off and felt no difference.  Whatever horrific shit was taking place had stripped it of power completely.

There was a horrible sound, surrounding me.  As if the sky itself was crying out in pain and mourning.  I covered my ears, but it made no different.  The horrid sound was just loud as before.  The only bright side in all of this was that at least my foot wasn’t hurting anymore.  Or, at least, if it did still hurt, then I had no idea since I was way too distracted by everything else going on.

I froze where I was, just trying to take everything in and not make any sudden moves.  And then, about 5 minutes after the power outage, the lights in the house snapped back on.  I immediately sensed the warmth of the blanket negating all of the oppressive cold from my surroundings.  I looked up and the aurora were back.  And, unfortunately, so was the pain in my foot.  I knew I'd never know the answer behind what had taken place, so I tried to force it out of my mind.

Soon enough, I made it home.  The rest of the trip was delightfully uneventful, thankfully. Even though I didn’t see Ezra anywhere on my way back home or inside my house since I had the good sense to lock my doors this time, I was still gonna end up being faced with him at church that morning.  I could hardly bare the thought.  I didn’t wanna confront him about what he had tried to do to me.  I was too afraid to go anywhere near him.  All I could think to do was to keep away, not make eye contact, and hope for the best.

Since the pain was thankfully starting to die down a bit and I could hardly keep my eyes open, I decided I’d turn in for the night.  I pressed the button on the back of the clock like Anastasia had said, I set the alarm for 8 o’clock, and then was out like a light in probably under 2 minutes.
