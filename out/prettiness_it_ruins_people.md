hi,im lilly, lilly ryan! im 16 and im LITTERLY one of the populars now! my mom always wanted me to be popular and pretty.i have been waiting for this day, the day i finally would be known!!!!( this is a diary)

so it all started yesterday, there i was sitting at my lunch table with my friend, aimee. Then it happend. Harper (the most popular girl) walked up to me and asked me to sit with them!! i had only been at my new school ,cherewoe high, for around a month. after my moms passing my dad moved us away. anyway back to my story, she asked me to sit with them so ofc i said yes! i gave aimee a look and she nodded, i walked with harper and sat. nervous i said hi. then charlee and macyee (harpers besties AKA her gang) began rambling on about my potential and wanting to give me a makeover. they asked me to come over after school so i said yes!! (duh). anyway i think its about time i go now so i’ll update you later!!
(2 days later)

okay so me coming over after school turned into a sleepover! they even bought me new outfits and showed me how to look pretty like them. it was my first day at school today with my upgraded style! I got so many looks from everyone walking down the halls with my new friends. A hot boy even asked me out!i said yes (again duh) so hes taking me out on friday!! EEKK.im really starting to like it here. But my dad doesnt, hes trying to tell me my new style and my new friends arent good for me and theyll ruin who i am? i don’t understand what he means but whatever.im happy isnt that enough for him.

(friday after the date)
OMG I JUST WENT ON A DATE WITH ALFIE!! it was amazing, he took me to this restaurant it was adorable! he paid for me and drove me home, he so romantic. i think im in love with him! The only bad part is, my dad. hes still trying to tell me that im going to be ruined and stuff, he just doesnt understand how good i have it now im popular. thats all that happened today tho.

(next night)

i just got back from a shopping trip with the girls but to be honest, today hasnt been the best. ive reliased im not as pretty as i thought. i mean sure im not ugly but next to harper, maycee and charlee? they look like supermodels and im just the ugly one, ive never really felt this jealous before. i think theese girls are unintentionally ruining my self confidence. Ive been layering my face with makeup, wearing the most revealing outfits, doing everything but, compared to them, im nothing. I dont like them, i wanna be the prettiest. i have to get rid of them, for good. then i will be the pretty one!


(a month later)

i did it, all 3 are gone.

i started with the prettiest, maycee. she was easy. i asked her if she wanted to go to the mall of course she agreed. we got to the mall and went shopping then she had to pee, perfect timing. i took out the brick from my bag and smashed her head. i left her in a vent. next i did charlee, she invited me over as her parents were out of town, kitchen knife to the heart works well. lastly was harper, oh harper harper harper. i saw her with alfie in the park ,that made the guily of killing her easier. i threw a stick at her from the bushes. harper been the girl she is she stormed to were i was. my plan worked perfectly, i grabbed her by her gorgeous hair and threw her on the floor, i stomped on her face till she was unrecognisable, she wasnt breathing.

i did it mom, im the prettiest just like you wanted
