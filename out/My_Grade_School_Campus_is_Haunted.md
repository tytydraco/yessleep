It’s been nearly a decade since I last stepped foot on the grounds of my old grade school, but the memories—unlike the buildings—refuse to decay.

I was a student at a charter school that spanned pre-K through eighth grade, packed tight with kids and noise and energy. The campus itself was split into two main sections: the upper building, which housed the youngest grades and the administrative offices, and the lower building, home to the gym and middle school classrooms. It also used to be home to an old factory of some kind--I am still not sure what for, but the remnants sit alongside the trails that run behind the school. Between the upper & lower buildings sat the playground.

And the dormitories.

Before our school existed, the land had belonged to a boarding school (and at some point like I mentioned, some strange factory). Two dormitories remained from that era—one for girls, one for boys—both long abandoned, their doors chained shut, their windows opaque with dust. Their very presence was a kind of haunting.

We weren’t supposed to go near them. Of course, we did.

It must’ve been fourth grade when a few of us—three or four at most—decided to sneak up the steps of the girls’ dormitory during recess. The building loomed, quiet and heavy, its rusted railings and peeling paint offering a kind of forbidden allure. From the top, we had a perfect view of the playground. We knew it wasn’t safe, but the risk was half the fun.

We leaned against the railing, laughing, when I happened to glance up at the second-story windows.

That’s when I saw her.

A girl stood behind the glass, face pressed to it. Her hair was dark, tied with what looked like a pink or red ribbon. Her expression wasn’t blank—it was sorrowful. Restless. The longer I stared, the clearer she became. Her pale skin, the bruises on her arms, the way she raised one hand slowly to the pane as if to wave—or warn.

I tried to speak. Tried to get someone’s attention. But before I could make a sound, a teacher’s whistle cut through the air, sharp and shrill. We were caught. Ushered down the stairs and scolded for being somewhere we shouldn’t have been.

As we walked away, I looked back. The window was empty. Just dust and glass and nothing at all.

They tore the building down that summer. Now there’s nothing left—not even a scar in the grass to suggest it was ever there. I wonder if that girl, or whatever I had seen, wishes to still be remembered. Or perhaps they were set free upon the destruction of the building.

But the boys’ dormitory remained. And what happened there—I’ve never spoken of until now.

It was eighth grade. I’d joined the cross-country team that fall, but a sprained ankle kept me from running in our final home meet. Instead, I was posted at a checkpoint to cheer my teammates on. One friend, exhausted, stopped beside me, needing to catch her breath. I offered to walk a stretch with her. We crossed the parking lot beside the boys’ dormitory. After a bit of back and forth chatting, my friend had decided that she should probably pick up the pace and finish the rest of the run. We exchanged goodbyes and I told her I'd be up there soon. She disappeared in a matter of moments up the path.

That’s when the feeling hit me.

It was like my gut turned to ice. Something unseen, but heavy. Watching.

I stood there, staring at the dormitory’s warped frame. The paint was a sickly, chipped off-white, the windows cracked, the front door rusted and locked up in a similar fashion as the girls dormitory had been. I wanted to move, to leave, but I couldn’t. My feet stayed planted. My chest tightened.

Then came the sound.

A metallic clanging—sharp and rhythmic. Like iron against cement.

Bang. Bang. Bang.

Each strike grew louder, closer. My breath caught in my throat. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t look away.

Then came the cries.

A boy’s voice, high and panicked. Then another. Screaming. Pleading, it seemed. But I couldn't quite make out the words. The banging changed—deeper, softer. A wet sound.

And then the smell hit.

Rot. Thick, fetid decay. Like something dead had been left in the sun for days. It was all around me. In my hair, my nose, my mouth. I gagged.

I still felt frozen as footsteps echoed—fast, pounding toward me from behind. I wanted to run. Every bone, every nerve, every muscle said *run.*  I was expecting something—someone—to come grabbing me from behind.

But nothing came.

Just silence.

And then, I could move again.

I didn’t hesitate. I turned and limped away as fast as I could, ankle screaming in protest. I reached the edge of the road, just beyond the dormitory, collapsed into the grass, and vomited. The nausea clung to me, the stench still in my nose as I practically dragged myself back to the front entrance of the lower building and cleaned up before anyone could see me like that.

That was my final year at the school.

I graduated later and never looked back.

To this day, I don’t know what happened in those dormitories. I don’t know who the girl in the window was, or whose voice cried out behind those crumbling walls. I only know what I saw. What I smelled. What I felt. I do know that as of today, that boys dormitory still sits. Rotting. Perhaps infesting others with what I experienced, too. I could only hope differently.

And I know I’ll never go back.

Some buildings remember.

And sometimes, they want you to remember, too.
