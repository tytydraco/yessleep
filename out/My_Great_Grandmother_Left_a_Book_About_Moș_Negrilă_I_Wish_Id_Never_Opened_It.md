If you read what happened to me last week, I didn’t leave the house.

I should have. Every instinct I had told me to run, to put as much distance between myself and that place as possible. But fear doesn’t always push you forward. Sometimes it roots you in place, convincing you that moving is what gets you noticed.

I locked myself in my bedroom and waited.

The bells didn’t ring again. That silence felt deliberate, like something had decided it didn’t need them anymore. My phone had no signal. The battery drained faster than it should have, dropping from sixty percent to ten in less than an hour.

That’s when I remembered the trapdoor.

It was under my bed and it lead into my great grandmother’s bedroom. I hadn’t thought about it in years. She used to sleep in that room until she died, and no one ever touched it afterward. She’d once caught me lifting the mattress when I was little and slammed it back down so hard the bedframe cracked.

“Some things,” she’d said, gripping my wrist too tightly, “are hidden when it is needed.”

I lifted the mattress.

The trapdoor was still there, perfectly flush with the floor. No hinges. No handle. Just a seam. I slid it open and found a narrow ladder descending into darkness.

Her room was colder than the rest of the house. Not drafty cold. The air smelled like dust and old paper. A tall bookshelf stood against the far wall, crammed with journals and thin, hand-bound books.

One of them had been pulled halfway out.

The cover was cracked leather, no title, no date. Just a symbol pressed deep into it: a small bell, scratched so violently into the surface that it tore through the leather.

I opened it.

Most of it was written in my great grandmother’s handwriting. Tight, sharp letters. But some pages were older. The ink faded. The words uneven, like whoever wrote them had been shaking.

It wasn’t a story.

It was a record.

The first pages explained what Moș Negrilă was not.
Not a demon.
Not a spirit of punishment.
Not something that comes for bad children.

“He does not take those who misbehave,” one line read. “He stays with those who do not listen.”

Then came the rules.

They were short. Repeated again and again, sometimes written by different hands.

Do not answer.
Do not call his name.
Do not follow the sound.
Do not look for him.

One page was folded at the corner, worn thin from being opened too many times.

The handwriting changed.

It described a man from a nearby village. A skeptic. Someone who mocked the bells when they rang outside his house. Someone who stepped onto his porch and said the name out loud, just to prove nothing would happen.

The bells stopped.

He was found the next morning.

Not missing.

Found.

The book didn’t describe everything. It didn’t need to. It mentioned broken furniture, deep gouges in the walls, and blood where blood shouldn’t have been. It said the room smelled like iron for weeks after.

The final line on the page was underlined so hard it tore the paper.

When they found him, the bell was still there.

I closed the book.

That’s when I heard it.

Not bells.

Footsteps.

Slow. Heavy. Moving upstairs.

My bedroom door creaked.

I didn’t run. I didn’t breathe. I sat on my bed, clutching the book to my chest like it could protect me. The footsteps stopped outside my door. Something brushed against the wood, dragging lightly, like fingers or nails testing the surface.

Then a voice.

Low. Calm. Almost patient.

“Come out.”

I don’t know why I did it.

Maybe it was the silence before. Maybe it was the certainty that hiding had already failed. Or maybe I thought I could still follow the rules if I moved carefully enough.

I opened the door.

The hallway was empty.

Cold air rolled toward me, thick and sharp. The lights flickered once, then went out completely. I stood there, heart hammering, telling myself I hadn’t answered. I hadn’t said his name. I hadn’t followed any sound.

Then I saw the bell.

It sat in the middle of the hallway floor.

Small. Dull metal. Covered in faint scratches clustered too close together to make sense.

I stepped back.

The bell rang.

Not loudly. Just once. Soft. Final.

Behind me, something breathed.

I turned.

Moș Negrilă stood at the end of the hallway, hunched beneath the ceiling, wrapped in dark, tattered furs that moved even though he didn’t. His face was pale and stretched too tight, his mouth pulled into a grin that showed too many teeth.

He didn’t rush me.

He didn’t need to.

“I warned you,” he said, gently.

The bell rang again.

And this time, I understood what my great grandmother meant.

Some things are hidden when it is needed.

And some bells only ring when it’s already too late.
