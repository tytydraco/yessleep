I think we all know the legend of Bloody Mary, a beautiful yet vain and self obsessed girl, who lived in a small village. But in case you don’t, it is said that she would spend hours upon hours just admiring herself in the mirror each day, until one day, when a tragic accident happened that left Mary disfigured beyond recognition. Unable to bear the sight of her own reflection anymore, and consumed with grief and self-hatred, Mary was but a former shell of herself. Years went by, and Mary became consumed by a new obsession: revenge against the mirror that once held her beauty. So one night, she lit a candle and stood in front of the mirror, chanting. Bloody Mary, she said, referring to herself and looking at the hideous girl who was looking back. Bloody Mary, she chanted again, this time angrier, more desperate. BLOODY MARY, but as the third chant parted from her lips, instead of the brutally scarred woman, what was looking back at her was a twisted, grotesque, vengeful creature. And now, legend goes that if you stand in the mirror, in the dark, holding a candle, you will see Mary, and she will seek to exact her revenge on you. 

  
Now, I am not superstitious, but I don’t go looking for trouble either, so I’ve never really chanted Bloody Mary in the mirror, holding a candle. But what I have done before, and seldom thought twice about, was walk around the house, in the dark, holding a candle. You know, power goes out, you light a candle. Romantic setting, light a candle. Ominous, eerie Halloween party, light a candle. That sort of thing. In my walking around the house shenanigans, it happened, maybe once or twice, that I’d pass a mirror. Never paid much attention to it, although, looking back, I can’t remember whether I’ve ever checked my reflection before, or not.

  
Except one time, I definitely did.

  
We had just moved into our new home a few days back, and my husband had to go out of town, so it was just the dog and me. I was upstairs, unpacking boxes, sorting things, you know how it goes when you just move into a new place, the work never ends. As I was going from room to room, from upstairs to downstairs and back, constantly moving heavy stuff from one place to another, I left plenty of lights on around the house, to facilitate my toing and froing. I guess that’s what must have triggered it, because at some point, when I plugged my phone to charge it the power switch went off. 

  
“Damn it”, I said, knowing the switch was all the way in the basement and my phone was at 2%. Luckily, I had some candles lying around in one of the boxes, and just enough juice in my phone to find them. Also, luckily, I had packed the lighters with the candles. Yay for my organizational skills!

  
I lit one of those long thick Ikea candles, I remember it even now, it was  red, burgundy red, like blood, and went down the stairs. 

  
The house had a huge mirror just at the entrance, on the left, covering the whole wall. This mirror would also greet you as you came down the stairs, as the staircase was also positioned at the entrance, but on the right hand side. So as I descended, with my lit bloody red candle, I came face to face with the wall-sized mirror. There was no way to not look at my reflection, save for closing my eyes. Not that that was a concern at that time. As I was coming down the stairs, I noticed something off on my neck, so I stepped up to the mirror for a closer look. Initially, I couldn’t spot anything, but as seconds went by, I felt like my reflection was distorting. I moved about, and sure enough, the reflection did too. But, it was grinning, in a way that I felt my face wasn’t grinning in reality. I puckered my lips, and the reflection puckered it’s lips also, but the grin somehow remained. I realized the weird grin wasn’t coming from my lips, but rather, it was imprinted in the reflection’s eyes. I tried looking away, but I struggled to find will power. All my brain wanted to do was stare at my reflection. And the more I did, the more distorted it was becoming. The eyes, they were becoming larger, and the mouth was now contorted in ways that mine was certainly not. And it was moving closer, even though I was definitely frozen in place. It wasn’t walking, as much as it was zooming in. Zooming in, with crazy eyes, and grinning. And even though it’s lips weren’t moving, it was laughing, at least in my head. 

  
In that moment, I felt like I was experiencing sleep paralysis but fully awake and vertical. The more I looked, the more I did not recognize myself anymore. The person, or rather, the thing staring back at me was disfigured beyond recognition. Was it Mary, I wondered. It’s eyes were bulging out, mouth opened and sucked in. It lifted a hand, and did a come hither motion with the index finger. I felt compelled to step closer. Die, it said, making my heart pump out of my chest. Die, Die, DIE! My heart felt like it was going to explode.  

  
It was then that my dog came running and barking from upstairs, startling me and releasing me from the grip the mirror had previously held on me. The reflection was now my own again, for the brief second I looked. I didn’t dare look for longer. I shut my eyes as I ran towards the basement door. I flipped on the switch and covered the mirror that very night. 

  
The next day, when my husband returned, I asked him to remove it, so he placed it in the attic. I never told him why, just said I didn’t like how it looks. I never figured out if it was that particular mirror, or if this happens when you hold a candle in a mirror, if that was Mary, if I was cursed, if the candle needs to be red. I have so many questions that I never intend to find out answers to. What I know is that I no longer look at my reflection in the dark. Not in a mirror, nor in a glass door. Not even without a candle.
