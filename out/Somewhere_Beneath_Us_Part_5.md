&#x200B;

We turned to the hallway to our left and took off running. I glanced over my shoulder just in time to see the ballerina finish scooping her guts back into her stomach. In horror, I watched the long slit in her skin instantly seal back up. She cocked her head and looked at us before beginning her writhing dance. She was scarily fast. As she skipped, she stretched her massive wings to the sides of the hallway. Her claws touched the lockers, and she allowed them to drag alongside her, sending showers of sparks flying. We saw the hall about to split up ahead and dashed left. I fumbled for the flashlight in my pocket, the light from the studio no longer visible, and clicked it on.

The light illumined the hallway, the lockers, and five ballerinas blocking the path ahead. Each of them stared eagerly at us through the holes in their masks. The total light revealed something about them that I hadn't noticed, however. Their masks weren't masks. Their mouths were agape, sprouting long black beaks from their throats, and a messy plume of feathers grew around their eyes. It looked painful and bloody. Daniel and I looked around for any sort of escape; we were surrounded. There was only one door beside us that was shut. We ran to it and tried the handle, and I prayed that it was unlocked. My heart sank when the handle didn't budge.

The ballerinas started skipping toward us while the one who chased us continued her pursuit.

"Joel, open the damn door!" Daniel yelled.

"I-It's locked!" I said as I yanked with all of my might. There was no way I could brute force it. If the creature couldn't do it, then there was no way I'd be able to. The dancers were close now, only twenty feet away. I couldn't believe in my last moments I was thinking of that thing.

*Tink TONK tink TINK!*

I could even hear its notes in my head, at least, that's what I thought until I heard its ear-shattering scream behind me.

Wait, I didn't imagine it. It was coming from...

As I desperately yanked the handle, I felt the knob turn in my hand, and the door swung outward toward me. I felt something slam into chest, and I tumbled to the ground as whatever came out fell with me. I prepared to fight my way out from the demon on top of me, but then I noticed the demon's beautiful, terrified eyes.

"Bea?"

Ethan slammed into Daniel as he rushed out of the door. He wasted no time in grabbing the man and shoving him to the side of the doorway. Ethan stepped in front of him and stretched his arm out, preventing Daniel from moving. Bea and I took his cue and, holding each other, rolled to our side and sat up against the wall. The ballerinas were on top of us now, but it didn't matter. The skin-wearing creature came barreling through the doorway, right past us and bowled a massive group of them over. The ones that remained turned their eyes to the beast.

"Let's go!" Ethan yelled as he ran back through the door. Daniel followed as Bea and I scrambled to our feet.

I was the last one through, and as I turned around to shut the door, I saw the creature downstairs lifting the dancers and viciously smashing them into the ground. They slashed back with their claws, cutting the faux skin loose and making it shriek in anger. I didn't need to see anymore. I slammed the door and clicked the lock. The four of us gasped there in the darkness as my ever-slow brain caught up.

I stood and turned to Bea and Ethan, "What the- What the *hell* are you guys doing here?!"

The two looked at each other as if trying to telepathically decide what to say. Ethan tried to take a shot at the question first, but all that came out was a nervous, "H-Hey, man. Funny running into you like this."

I was not amused. "So much for staying if I asked you to, huh?"

"Hey, to be fair, you never directly asked me not to come. You didn't ask Bea at all."

"It was definitely implied!"

"We weren't about to let you two come down here alone and get yourself killed." Bea chimed in.

"That's exactly why the two of us came down here alone! So that no one else *would* get killed," I said, pointing to Daniel.

"Damn it, kids, what were you two thinking? What if you hadn't run into us? You would have been lost down here alone." he scolded.

"We left right after you two. We figured we would run into you pretty quick. I guess we just were going at different paces." Ethan admitted.

"We're going back," I said. "I'm not going to let you guys risk your lives down here with me."

"You don't get to make that choice." Bea snapped. "We didn't get to make that for you when you decided to come down here. You think I was happy to just let you go?"

"That's not the point, Bea. I came down here in the first place so I could get you all out. If you die, then... then all of this was for nothing."

"There are still five people waiting up there for us to find the exit and come back. You're going to need all the help you can get to find it."

"No, I'm not. The only reason Dan came was that he threatened to kill himself otherwise."

"Hey!" Daniel shouted

"Would you stop being so stubborn?"

"No! Because if I let you come, and you die, I won't be able to live with myself."

"Well, if I let you go alone and you die, then I won't be able to live with myself. Do you see the problem?"

"Joel..." Ethan suddenly spoke up, "I know seeing Andi stirred up a lot of emotions, but... We aren't her. What happened to her wasn't your fault."

"This isn't just about Andi."

"Then what is it about?"

"It's about all of the..." I caught myself. Behind Ethan, I could see *Him* standing there, staring at me with judgmental eyes. "Nothing. Just forget it."

Daniel looked back down the hallway, "Listen, we can discuss this when we find someplace safe, but we need to get out of this hall. There are probably a lot more of those girls around here. Joel was right about one thing, though. We're going back."

"What, why?" Ethan asked.

"The door to the stairs is locked. There's no way down. We can go back up and try to come back here another time. Maybe something will have opened it by then."

"That's not necessarily true; the no way down part." Bea said, "This floor isn't like the other ones. It's all just this school."

"Okay?"

"That means there may be a key around here somewhere. If we find it, we can get that door open."

"That's actually not a bad idea. I'm sure there's got to be something. Maybe a master key?"

We all looked at one another, then began moving down the hall. It was funny how we had all become so close over the years we hardly needed words to communicate. Before we got too far from the door, I took a moment to rewind the flashlight. In a single file line, we quietly tip-toed up the halls, my heart pounding with every step. I had no idea where the ballerinas were. They were so silent that it wasn't like I would be able to hear them if they were in front of us. Each step was a gamble, and each flashlight flicker was like winding a jack in the box. We turned down a hallway and spotted a glow coming from a window a ways down. As we moved closer, the sight became familiar; they were the windows that peered into school offices. I flicked the flashlight down the hallway to make sure no ballerinas would see us attempting to run to the room. When I did, I noticed something below one of the windows on the wall. A smiley face was sprayed on in the same green spray paint that had originally warned us of danger.

I approached the offices after finding no threat down the halls and peered in the window. They looked like they had been covered with paper that had been mostly torn off. Beyond, There was only one light illuminating the central part of the office, with several dark rooms attached. There didn't appear to be anything inside, however. I gestured for everyone to join me, and together we all slipped inside of the room. I gently shut the door and noticed a lock on the handle, then turned it into place. There was another door across the office that Ethan did the same to. We quickly swept the area and found all the smaller rooms empty, then reconvened by the front desk.

"I think this place is safe."

"Alright." Bea nodded. "Let's look for keys."

We fanned out and began looking. Ethan and Daniel went to the back rooms and began sorting through their drawers while Bea and I took the front desk. Neither of us spoke the whole time, and I could feel her actively avoiding eye contact. I didn't blame her. I knew that I was being hypocritical about the situation, but it didn't matter to me. All that did matter was that my friends remained safe. I didn't care what happened to me. Still, I felt guilty. I knew why she was upset. I knew Ethan was too; he was just better and not showing it. I was about to say something to Bea when Daniel re-entered the room.

"You all should see this." He spoke, setting a clipboard down on the desk.

Ethan came back in, and together we all poured over the papers that were attached.

"Where did you find this?" Ethan asked.

"It was just laying on the desk in there," Daniel answered, pointing to one of the offices.

The papers were just old attendance sheets; however, they had been turned over and furiously written on, with notes covering entire pages. They said things like:

*-Phrase "Safe room" is no longer safe to mark rooms with. The creatures are more intelligent here and know what that means. The old saferoom in the janitor's office behind the gym was compromised when they were guarding the door from outside. Moved to this saferoom shortly after. New symbol to mark saferooms - :)*

*-Arrived at the new safe room. Lost Tina and Westly along the way.*

*-Cafeteria food has already been taken, as well as vending machines. Check the bottom cupboard in the breakroom for any food left behind.*

Daniel left as we read and came back a couple of minutes later, with a few bags of chips in his hand, as well as three water bottles.

"This was all that was in there." He noted.

We continued reading.

*-The black swan does not act like the others. She is different, seems more intelligent, and less hostile. We remain hidden in this saferoom, yet we often see her peering in through the windows. It's as if she knows that we're in here. She has yet to attack us on our trips out.*

*-Leaving Safehouse soon to continue down. Trip started: 13 Current count: 10*

We all looked down at the page, confused.

"I guess it wasn't Andi who marked that room upstairs," I said to Dan. He nodded in agreement.

"Does this mean there were more people at the house before us?" Bea asked.

"It looks like it," Dan grunted.

"What do you think happened to them?"

"Well, it looks like they were heading for the same place as us. From the looks of these notes, not all of them made it."

"I wonder if they found it."

"They must have," I said. "I'd be willing to bet these rooms and notes are how Andi made it down there and back up."

"Could be."

"But, Andi said she couldn't get to the door." Ethan reminded us, "If these people got down there, but there's no trace of them other than this, then...." Nobody said anything.

"Did anyone find a key?" Bea asked, breaking the silence.

"No."

"No."

"Nah."

"Well," She started, "it said that there was an old saferoom behind the gym that was a janitor's closet. If anyone had a master key, it would be him."

"Well, where's the gym?" Dan asked.

I looked to the wall where a fire escape map rested above an extinguisher. "Right here," I said, pointing to it. It was only two hallways down from the office. That was assuming this floor wasn't scrambled like the rest of them, however.

"Alright. Then we have our heading."

We turned back to the window, and my heart leapt from my chest. Through the holes in the paper, I could see several swans standing, simply staring at us. I watched as one twirled behind the front door, and the handle began to jiggle. Luckily, we had taken the time to lock them. One of the ballerinas put her claw to the window and dragged it down. The glass didn't scratch or break, but it certainly made an earsplitting screech. I noticed the dancer in the black leotard standing behind the rest, gazing at us. It was then that I realized why the windows had been covered.

"Damn it," Ethan muttered. "What do we do?"

"How are they still alive? I thought that thing killed them?" Bea said.

"There are a lot of them. And unfortunately, they don't stay dead." I replied.

One ballerina's arm twitched and bumped another one. All at once, they converged on her, showing Ethan and Bea the sight I had already gotten to see.

"Maybe they killed the creature," Dan said.

Bea sighed, "One can only hope."

"Wait a minute, if that thing is following us, do you think it's still feeding everyone upstairs?" I asked.

We shifted nervously before Ethan spoke. "Well, Andi had to deal with it too, I'm sure, and it still fed us for a year. I'm sure they'll be fine." The statement offered a bit of comfort; however, if what Dan suggested was true, and the thing was dead, there would be nobody to take care of the people upstairs. "Well, what are we going to do now?" He continued as the swans stepped away from the window and began to use the hallway as their new dance floor. "It doesn't seem like we're getting out of here as long as they know we're held up."

"It's just one thing after the next." Dan groaned.

"Are you kidding me?" Ethan joked, "My life hasn't been this interesting in nearly four years."

We waited for a while, discussing ideas and hoping the dancers would eventually become occupied with something else, allowing us an escape. Unfortunately, we weren't so lucky. Minutes turned to hours. Hours turned to days. The whole time, the ballerinas just danced in front of the window as if mocking us. They knew we were trapped. In the meantime, they kept themselves entertained by continuously slashing one another to pieces and re-stitching themselves a few minutes later.

I was thankful we hadn't relied only on finding food and had brought the extra box of saltines. We were sure to ration them, eating only a few each every other day for the five days we were there. The sink in the breakroom worked, supplying us with the same chalky water we were used to, and we took shifts guarding the main office in case anything somehow managed to break their way in.

On the fourth day, tensions started to rise. We weren't sure if we were going to make it out. Bea still seemed like she was avoiding me; however, it no longer seemed like anger. It felt more like us not knowing what to say to one another. Ethan just told me to give it time and that she would come around. Frankly, I was afraid I was going to run out of it.

On the fifth night, Daniel woke me up to take my watch. I stepped out of the breakroom and into the main office, where I sat down in a computer chair behind the desk. We had re-papered the windows in an attempt to deter the dancers, but I could still slightly see their shadows dancing across the parchment. They weren't giving up.

"Hey, brother." He said from underneath the desk. I didn't bother to look down, but I could see his figure huddled in the shadow. "Long week, huh?"

"It's going to be if we're stuck in here any longer."

"Eh, I wouldn't worry about it too much. That girl of yours took a year to find the exit. I'm sure she spent a lot of that time just waiting." I said nothing. "Hey, speaking of her, why haven't you told the others the real reason you're upset they came?"

"Because they don't need to know."

"Why not? You already told them it wasn't about Andi."

"It is about Andi."

"Not all of it. If I remember correctly, A big part of it was the reason you were on that bus in the first place."

"What do you want from me?" I snapped. "Why do you just show up to torment me?"

"Whoa, brother, take it easy. I just like to come to see how my best friend is doing" He laughed slightly to himself, "Well, 'friend' is a loose term. I don't know if a friend would have done what you did. But you'll always be a friend in my eyes. Just like Ethan sees you."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"Oh, nothing. Some people are just too loyal, I suppose."

He snickered at my lack of a response.

"Anyhow, I'll let you chew on that one for a bit." He said, crawling out on all fours. I watched his figure begin wriggling the whole way over to one of the dark offices. "In the meantime, someone's at the window."

"What?"

"Someone's tapping on the window. You should probably check it out."

I suddenly heard a sharp clinking against the glass. I usually would have ignored it, but for some reason, I found my heart pounding as if I was being drawn to the window. I stood and gently peeled back the corner of one of the sheets, jumping a bit as I came face to face with one of the swans. I  quickly eased up, though, at what I saw next.

It was the one in the black leotard. Her tortured eyes stared right at me, and as soon as she saw me looking, she stepped back from the window.

Stepped back. She was no longer dancing.

She glanced around and opened her arms, gesturing to the floor. Around her, all of her sisters lay motionless and torn to shreds. She was all that remained. Then she did something unexpected. She raised a claw and beckoned. Blood raced in my eardrums as I tried to process what I was seeing. The swan stared desperately at me all the while, continuing to call me forward. My mind raced, then suddenly latched onto something. A thing the notes had said.

*The black swan is not like the others... She has yet to attack us..*.

I looked at the door handle and quickly made a decision. I knew if what I was thinking was true, I wouldn't have much time to test the theory. I quietly turned the lock and swung open the door. My boots splashed into the mess of ballerina blood that waited outside, and with my heart racing, I stood completely still and stared at the woman before me. She stopped beckoning and did the same. Slowly, my fear began to dimmish as the swan did nothing but stare. She didn't rush forward, and she didn't dance. I felt a strange sense of empathy wash over me. The thing before me may have looked as monstrous as the others, but she looked... Scared. Human, almost. Somewhere inside me, I felt it.

"Y-You're not going to hurt us, are you?"

She shook her head.

It was small, but it was all I needed. I burst back into the office and went straight to the breakroom.

"Everyone, wake up now! We've gotta go."

"Huh?" Daniel said, sitting up, "What's going on? What are-"

"There's no time for questions. Let's go!"

The three of them listened and quickly scooped up whatever belongings they had and shoved them into their bags. I led them out into the hall, where they saw the ballerina.

"Joel, look out!" Bea yelled.

"No, it's okay! She's not like them!"

"How do you know?"

"look, we don't have long before these ones get back up, and we don't have any other options. I'll take my chances." Her, Daniel, and Ethan all hesitated. I looked right into their eyes. "Just trust me on this."

She pursed her lips before offering a small, "Okay..."

The ballerina suddenly dashed off down the hallway, and we knew exactly where she was heading. She knew what we would be looking for. We followed, running behind her in the darkness. I looked over my shoulder before rounding the corner of the hall, just to be sure. I thought I saw an arm of one twitch but hoped we had some time before they noticed we were gone.

We followed the black swan through the halls, and sure enough, she turned down a corridor just past a set of gymnasium doors. She stopped halfway down the tunnel and gestured to a doorway with the words "Saferoom" spray-painted on the side. I went to run inside but was immediately hit with a brick wall of stench. I fumbled around for my flashlight and clicked it on, shinning it in the room.

This was undoubtedly the janitor's closet. The irony was that it was a mess. Dried blood was splayed across every surface, and limbs and chunks of rotting flesh lay in decay throughout the room. The remains of two completely lacerated torsos were all that remained of the two victims the limbs once belonged to. The stench of the rotting wet corpses was overwhelming... the rest of the room was fairly large, with lots of shelves and space for tools and equipment. Items were strewn about and covered in dust. Water trickled from a pipe and immediately formed a puddle that swirled down a drain in the floor. Across the way, above a desk in the corner, a pegboard hung on the wall. A set of keys dangled from one of the hooks. I pulled my coat over my face and ran into the room, heading for the keys. I pulled them off and turned around to see that Ethan had followed me in. He was over by the shelf of tools, grabbing a hammer. He saw me looking and mimicked a swing as if to show me his intentions. I nodded, and together we exited the room.

The black swan was already halfway down the hallway, waiting for us to follow once again. We rushed after her, keys jingling in my pocket, but as the dancer entered back into the main corridor, she was suddenly brought to the ground. I watched as another ballerina stomped on top of her with her toes, stabbing them into her neck and back. The black swan stopped moving.

"C'mon, this way!" I heard Dan yell from behind me.

I turned around and saw Daniel a distance down the hallway, opening another set of doors that led into the gym. We all followed as three other ballerinas plowed past the first and began leaping toward us. The gym was massive and dark. As I shone my light across the room, I could see the rest of the dancers entering the main door. We were surrounded in an open area.

"The bleachers!" Bea yelled, pointing to the wall across from us. They were folded up, creating the perfect platform for us to scale. What we would do from there was a mystery, but it was better than the current alternative. We slammed into the bleachers and began to climb the recessed steps like a ladder.

The ballerinas were already halfway across the court by the time Bea and Dan made it up. I made it up next and turned around, holding my hand out to Ethan. He took it, and I yanked him to safety just as a swan below swiped for his leg. I felt the air of the attack from all the way atop the bleachers.

We stood above the gym floor, looking down at the harpies as they stared up at us. One of them began to scale the sides of the platform, but as soon as its head peaked over the landing, Daniel kicked it hard with the butt of his boot. Another tried the same, but this time, Ethan slammed the hammer he had just grabbed hard into the thing's head. The woman went limp and fell to the ground, where the other dancers quickly trampled her. Ethan looked sick at what he had just done, but I could see him attempt to shake it off. Watching the others carelessly kill their own gave me an idea, however. I sat down and tore off my boot.

"Ethan, let me see that hammer!"

Ethan passed the tool to me without question, and I began to tie my laces to the end of it.

"What are you doing, kid?" Daniel yelled, "Pay attention!"

When my invention was done, I stepped to the edge of the bleachers. I prayed it was long enough. The swans began eagerly dancing ballets that involved swiping at me with their talons. I waited for a break in their movements, then leaned over the edge, and swung the make-shift flail. It clubbed the ballerina below me, and she stumbled slightly, falling into another one. I really hoped that their instincts would overcome their desire for us. When the surrounding women looked at the one who had just faltered, I knew it had worked. They pounced onto her, tearing her apart as they had with the rest. As soon as I saw one returning to their dance, I would swing again, knocking over that one too. It was working. After three successful hits and dodging between talons, the majority of the ballerinas had turned on one another. The ones that didn't fall to my hand fell to the dancers they bumped into while massacring each other.

"Lets go!" Bea said while the women below were distracted.

We ran along the edge of the bleachers with only two swans flowing us. They were faster, and I knew we still wouldn't have a shot at beating them if we leaped down. Luckily across the gym, I saw the black swan enter. She was back up. She danced toward the two and pounced onto one of them. While the other wasn't looking, I chanced it and jumped down.

Bad idea.

The remaining woman snapped toward me in an instant, her bloodshot eyes staring me down through her feathered face. She leaped toward me, closing the distance in a single bound. I dropped to the floor, ducking under one of her claws as she swiped at me. The only problem was that I was now defenseless on the ground. I started to spider crawl backward as the ballerina gracefully raised a leg and poised her sharp foot, ready to bring it down. After so many brushes with death in the past few days, I thought that I might have gotten used to the feeling. I hadn't.

Just then, Bea called out, "Hey!" The swan turned just in time for her to leap onto the dancer's back, knocking her off of her pegged foot and onto the floor. The thing thrashed violently, trying to swipe at Bea, who clung tightly to her back. Her talons couldn't quite reach, thank God. Ethan seized the moment and leaped down as well. He dashed to me and yanked the hammer from my hand as I got back up. Once he had it, he twirled around and, with my boot still attached, jumped onto the harpy's chest, bashing it into her face. She instantly stopped moving. Bea scurried out from under the creature, and we all looked at one another.

"Gah--" Ethan winced through his teeth as he held his arm. In all the frantic swiping, the swan had caught his forearm. A thick gash leaked crimson, and from the looks of it, I was thankful it had only hit his arm and not something vital. Bea luckily looked unscathed. The black swan finished off her victim, then turned to us. She pointed to the door, and we didn't need to be told twice. We ran for the halls, the few swans that remained realizing and following after. As we ran, I saw Ethan trying to stop his arm from leaking.

"Hang on, man; we're almost there," I told him.

We made a few turns then ran down a hallway that led to a familiar place. The main corridor. We bolted past the lockers and into the dance studio. I quickly shut the double doors to the main entrance and pulled the keys from my pocket. There were so many. I began fumbling through them, trying desperately to find the right one. Through the windows on the doors, I could see the dancers rounding into the corridor. Key after key, I jammed them into the lock as they closed the gap. The thought crossed my mind that we weren't even sure this would work.

"Joel!" Daniel cried as I slotted in another. I could see out of my peripheral that they were only five feet away now.

*Click!*

The locks turned sharply as I jumped back from the door, preparing for the worst. The dancers pelted the surface like thick balls of hail and angrily clawed as the glass. I panted on the floor as I stared, my hands trembling. The dancers receded down the hallway, and I hopped to my feet, running to lock the two remaining doors. Not even a minute later, I saw them appear in those windows as well. We all just stared at one another in amazement, the black swan included. We couldn't believe we had made it.

Without a word, I walked to the stairway door and clicked the key inside. It turned effortlessly. Ethan and Bea entered the dark chute, and Daniel began tending to Ethan's wound.

I turned back to the ballerina, "Um... thank you..."

She just stared at me. Her eyes weren't bloodshot like the rest of the dancers. They were gentle green eyes, full of pain and sadness. I could see them welling with tears.

"You're not one of them, are you?" I asked.

She gently shook her head. I wanted to know what that meant, but I knew she couldn't answer.

"Come with us."

She shook her head again. She went to step through the staircase door, and I watched as the floor around her other foot seemed to rise up around it, locking her in place.

"W-why does that...?" I questioned, looking up at her.

She simply stared at me with unknowing eyes.

I looked to the other ballerina's outside. "They won't be able to hurt you as long as the doors are locked. You'll be safe in here."

She nodded.

"Here," I said, crossing to the main door. I removed the key and placed it into the lock but didn't turn it. "If anyone else ever comes by, you should be able to turn it and unlock this. Even with your talons."

She looked at me and softly bowed in understanding. I could now see complete tears falling from her face. I couldn't help but see Andi. Trapped and only wanting an escape.

"I'm so sorry... that you're stuck here."

She shook her head no, then bent down to the dried blood on the floor. Slowly, she carved out a word.

*‘Deserved.’*

I didn't understand, but I nodded anyway. "We'll probably be back through here again soon. There's more of us. Maybe we can find a way to...."

She held up a talon to me, and very gently, rested it on my head. I had one last thing I needed to say to her.

"There were others, like us. Specifically, a girl. She had long black hair and light blue eyes. did she come through here?"

The swan paused for a moment, thinking, before nodding. My throat tightened.

"When... When she came back up to us, she was all cut up. Did... Did they do that?" I asked, pointing to the ballerinas beyond the glass. The woman's eyes suddenly looked confused and concerned. She returned to the dried blood and wrote something again, longer this time.

*Never came back.*

A deep feeling of dread formed in my stomach. Did she mean Andi?

"Joel," Daniel called out. "We should go..." He said, holding up the bloody cloth he was holding to Ethan's arm.

"Oh, shit, Ethan!" I rushed over to the stairs, and the swan followed. As I stepped through, I saw the light behind me suddenly growing dim. I turned back to see the woman gently closing it behind us. I met her eyes one last time before the door shut, and then, we were all four left alone in the darkness.
