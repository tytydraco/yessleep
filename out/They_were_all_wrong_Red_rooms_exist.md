A red room is a dark web phenomenon in which a person or group of people live stream a torture or murder of an individual in a room in the dark web. This has been debunked and proven impossible but they were all wrong, the time I’m writing this, one is being broadcasted. Maybe I’ll go famous, I’ll explain what I mean.

I am the cat of curiosity. If something gets me curious, I will literally do my best to find that. The dark web is something that makes me curious the most. And on there, specifically a dark web chatting site, is where I met my online best friend, Jared ( Aka redmoons). 


After 3 years of online talking, we finally met in person. To my surprise, he didn’t murder me. He was exactly how he was online. We played games, drunk and smoked, and of course search through the dark web, regular teenager bro things. 

While searching through the common things of the  dark web, Jared goes “Hey Alex, want to search for a red room”. Now like I said, YouTubers debunked it and at the time I believed them, so I said to Jared ( They don’t exist). And not surprisingly, he responds saying “Still, we already practically searched through everything, wouldn’t be fun to even try to search for them, it would be like trying to find the  One Piece, also, we might even discover new stuff while tryna search it, it would be fun”. 

I finally agreed, just to get it over with. After 2 hours of searching I was about to tell him that I wanna give up, and by noticing his facial expressions, I could infer that he wants to secretly give in to. That is, until we find a website condition of numerous links and by each link, is what the website is about. Most of the descriptions for the links are just hitmen or drugs or other illegal stuff and mostly traps set by the FBI but there was one that stood out.

The description by the link said “Red paint”. Jared clicks on it before I could even mention it. It was taking a while to load, and after a while, a live chat was the first to load. Jared screams “I told you!”, while I’m in awe that we could find one. When it finished loading, my awe and Jared’s pride gets vanquished by what we saw.

It was 2 people with clown masks and black clothing inserting screwdrivers into a woman’s chest. Jared goes to the bathroom to vomit, while I could withstand some disgust as I saw things such as these before.

Jared came back and almost vomited again, but in the midst of his gagging, he tried to reach for the mouse to click of the live stream, but I slapped his hand away and immediately start typing. Fueled by rage I type in words I’ll regret. “You dirty scumbags, why don’t you livestream you doing this to yourself”. 

After realizing what I just said I felt lightheaded and my heart pumped harder than a shotgun. Jared looks at me like he wanted to kill me, and with the worries flooding through my head and the current situation I am writing this I would honestly prefer he did.

Jared says nothing but “Pack your things, we need to run”, and we do exactly that. However while packing, the message most likely just went through or either the people hosting the red room just saw it, because they just now said “Stay tune for the Alex livestream”.

I almost got a heart attack. Jared looks at me in a silly but serious face. We don’t say anything at each other instead awkward silence as we stare each other off.

No more words exchanged, we just grabbed our bags and we booked the hell out the house.  Me and Jared hop in his car and he starts driving recklessly without informing where we were going.

20 minutes after driving I get a notification from the cameras, I thought it was my parents but it was a man wearing a horse mask and holding some sort of toolbox. He said “When I see you” as he lifts up  his toolbox. 


I get a mini heart attack. Jared gets out the car and so do I, he just keeps running to the woods so I just follow him. 6 minutes of blind running I see a shed, I direct Jared to it and he sprints to it like the first one there wins. I never ran so fast in my life. I tripped and lost sight of Jared but judging on how fast he was running and the persons will to survive he was most likely in the shed, I got back up and Usain  bolted to the shed. 

However, when I got to the shed Jared wasn’t in sight. I was gonna yell out “Jared” when out of nowhere I hear a robotic voice saying “Broadcasting in 5 seconds”. I look In front of me and it’s a computer with what appears to be a live chat. The robotic voice starts counting down. 
“5” I was processing what was happening.
“4” I am realizing what’s happening
“3” Death is weighing on my mind
“2” I think of Jared and my Family
“Livestream on” This is it.

The guy with the horse mask dances his way to the shed with the same toolbox. However, on the computer a voice can be heard saying “Redmoon donated 50 bucks to the livestream”

Jared.

“Betrayal sucks doesn’t it.” Said the man. “But in this world one must do everything to survive, and you wouldn’t be in this situation hearing me if it wasn’t for your own stupidity”. I grab a beady wooden bat and hit him with it. I ran for the car. I drove until I saw lights. I am currently in a restaurant typing this. So you see, those YouTubers were wrong. 

They exist.
