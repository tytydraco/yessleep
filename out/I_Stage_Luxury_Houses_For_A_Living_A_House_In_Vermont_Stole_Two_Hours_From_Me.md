I’m a staging specialist. I work for a large housing firm, which for the sake of this post I’ll refer to as ‘V’. We handle the kind of houses people jump off bridges over, the 4 million dollar foreclosures that the bank clawed back after the 2008 hangover finally turned into a migraine. My job is to make these architectural corpses look like a family just stepped out to the park. I’m good at what I do, but I live out of a van more often than I sleep in my own bed. 

I do the same steps in every house. 

That’s why I can’t explain what happened in Vermont.

It starts with something I call The Bread Ritual. The first thing I do when I enter a dead house (that’s my own term), is set up the portable convection oven in the kitchen. The smell of rosemary bread is the ultimate psychological trigger, which is funny because I don’t even eat carbs. I’ve been on a strict keto diet for 6 years now, since I started with V. V says it makes the house smell like a home; I say it smells more like sales pitch. By the time the appraisers, or the B-list buyers, walk in, the house is supposed to smell like a rich family’s dream life, even if the previous owners ended theirs in the master bath. 

I spend most of my life on the road with Kit48. That’s our ‘Modern Rustic’ template. It’s a collection of sofas, lamps, coffee tables etc. made of compressed particle board. If you don’t look too closely, it looks like real walnut. If you do look closely, you can see the glue holding the sawdust together. A billion dollar company skimping, you say? I bet your flabbers are ghasted. 

I have a pack of ‘Standard Family Photos” that I prop up on the sideboards to give the rooms that ‘lived-in’ feel. They’re airbrushed to fuck, and the people in them are so polished they barely look human. 

Last Tuesday, I was in a colonial in New Hampshire. I was exhausted, and when I reached for a bottle of dark walnut stain to touch up a scratch on the coffee table, I knocked it over. It hit the table edge and shattered. It shouldn’t have broken that easily, but it did, and the stain bloomed across the wood. 

I tried to wipe it with a rag, but the table was a thirsty bitch and soaked it up, leaving a jagged, bilateral smudge in the centre of the table, like a dark, deformed butterfly right in view of where the property photos would be taken. This would mean a trip to the warehouse, which meant more hours on the road, and I was growing so tired of the road.

I went to shove the table in the van. It has a thumb scanner on the handle, and the thing has been glitchy lately. It worked eventually, and I dragged the table into the back. I told myself I’d swap it for a new one at the warehouse when I got the chance. 

Three days later, I arrived at a ranch-style house in Vermont. I walked into the living room to start my measurements, and I saw a coffee table in the middle of the main room. I’m the only one with an access code to this place at the moment, so the coffee table being there threw me a bit. 

I walked over and touched the wood. 

The stain was there. 

The walnut liquid was still tacky, and when I touched it, it came off on my finger. Same jagged butterfly. Same dark blot. Underneath, the inventory sticker had a corner peeled back where my nail caught it last week. My first thought was that I’d been on autopilot and brought it in without realising. I know how that sounds, but sometimes I do things like that. Wash the dishes, forget I washed them, go to wash them again. My memory isn’t the best. 

So I went out to my van, fought with the scanner for a few tries, and opened the back up, fully expecting to laugh at myself. 

The table was still there. 

Stain and all.

I stood there with my hand on the van door, waiting for my brain to catch up. I had two identical coffee tables, and two identical stains. How is that even possible? 

I’d had a headache since New Hampshire, so I checked my phone to see when I could take my next dose of painkillers. 

I’d somehow lost half an hour. I was still holding the van door.

I closed up the van and went back inside to check the rest of the house. I went room by room, looking for other random duplicated furniture, but every other room was empty. 

Except the master bedroom. 

Something was sticking out of the wall.

About 6 inches above the floor, the tip of a man’s shoe protruded from the wall. I knelt down to get a better look. A black leather brogue, the expensive kind, with perforations on the toe. This thing was stuck on so well, I couldn’t figure out how it had been fixed to the wall. The paint met the leather too cleanly, like the wall had formed around it. I thought maybe it was some shit art installation.

I touched the edge where the paint met the leather. The wall had a soft give to it, like skin. I got my phone out to take a picture, and was startled by how much darker the room had suddenly become. I checked the time.

Two hours had gone.

*I’d lost two fucking hours?*

I took a photo on my phone so I could show my supervisor, then I called him and told him about it. He suggested I was *tired* and *not seeing things straight*, which immediately pissed me off. When I explained I definitely wasn’t imagining it, he completely brushed me off, saying things like: builders leave rubbish all the time, maybe something went wrong with the pour, just cover it with a dresser and finish the stage. 

I’ve been doing this for years; I’m not some fucking noob. Road fatigue? Fuck you Alex.

So, he wasn’t any help. 

I stayed in a motel that night, but I did not sleep well. I kept looking at the photo, trying to think of rational explanations. I came up with none. 

I woke up to a strange voicemail from a work friend, Maddy. She’s in the same batch as me, based out of the Chicago hub. She sounded frantic, and asked if I remembered the ‘dodgy swings’ near our primary school in Essex. As far as I know, Maddy has never been to England, let alone Essex. I’m pretty sure she’s never left the Midwest. She was crying and kept saying my name over and over until the recording cut off. I’m worried about her, because she is one of the most ‘together’ people I know. I tried to call her back, but it went straight to voicemail, so I sent her a message asking if everything was ok. I’ve not heard anything back yet. 

What’s weird is, I haven’t thought about the park near my primary school in years. And I know, I *know*, I didn’t ever tell Maddy about it. 

I could feel my headache getting worse. 

I went back to the Vermont house the next morning to finish the stage, and when I went into the master bedroom to finish up, the shoe was gone. The wall was perfectly smooth, with nothing to indicate it had been anything *but* smooth. I ran my hand over the spot, and it was perfect. Exactly like the rest of the wall. I’d expect to see some evidence of it being slightly different, like a slight difference in paint colour where new paint was applied. But nothing. Nothing at all. 

So, I know this is probably a long shot, but has anyone else experienced anything like this? 

I’m looking at the photo of the shoe on my phone, and I’m looking at the coffee table with the stain. I've also lost two and half hours somehow. Is it possible for a company to fix a wall in the middle of the night without leaving any evidence of doing so? And why do I now have two identical coffee tables? 

I'm genuinely asking, does this make sense to anyone?

I’m heading back to Maine in the morning, but I’m going to inventory my entire kit tonight to see if anything else has decided to duplicate. I really hope I don’t lose anymore time.
