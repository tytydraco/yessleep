I used to work as a Karate instructor in Oregon. Most martial arts schools can’t afford paid instructors, but this one was doing okay financially because a lot of kids went there after school. If you want to make money doing martial arts, you either train MMA fighters or run a glorified daycare. We did the latter. And I was a glorified babysitter.

It wasn’t so bad. The kids would show up after school, run around, and learn how to throw kicks that would never help them in a fight—but that looked cool. And the money their parents paid was enough to keep the lights on and buy nice equipment for the older, more serious students.

Every summer, the owner—Sensei Jason—took the kids on a weekend camping retreat in the Cascades. I never cared much for the woods. Too many things hiding in the trees. I’m from Wyoming, and I like wide open spaces. If there’s a bear, I want to see that sucker from a mile away. I managed to avoid the camping trip my first summer there, since I was still pretty new, but the second summer, I went. It was my first and last time.

It was mostly nonsense. We’d go on walks through the woods and slap a compass on a map and call it orienteering. Sensei Jason would use his old Eagle Scout training to show us what berries were edible. What any of this had to do with Karate, I don’t know. And like in any traditional martial arts school, there were pseudo-philosophical ramblings about sharpening the mind, facing our fears, and demonstrating the heart of a warrior.

For example, after a lecture about heightening our senses, Sensei Jason led us on a night walk on the trails during which we weren’t allowed to use flashlights. So, it was him in the front, followed by twenty terrified children, then Sensei Jason’s brother—Ian—and me bringing up the rear to make sure none of the kids got lost or fell down or got eaten by a mountain lion. Did I mention Oregon has mountain lions? Yeah, and they’re nocturnal ambush predators that like to go for small, easy prey. So, that was a real possibility. One of these kids could actually get attacked by a mountain lion. And what Ian and I were supposed to do in case that happened is beyond me. Use the heart of a warrior, I guess.

About twenty minutes into the hike and Ian looks at me and whispers, “Shit, I gotta take a piss.” I told him to go right ahead and just catch up after. But he pointed out that I can’t just leave one person behind. If he got injured, he’d need someone close that he could call to for help. And I pointed out to him that the line of kids in front of us was moving pretty slowly and we’d still be nearby. I guess Sensei Jason up front didn’t have his senses heightened enough, because he was walking at roughly the pace of a snail. But well, Ian outranked me, so I stopped and watched the nearest kid slip into the shadows in front of me.

The sky was clear, and the moon was out, but it still wasn’t possible to make out a shape more than a few feet away against the dark forest. I could still hear the kids shuffling along. I guess Ian has a shy bladder, because he actually stepped into the treeline instead of just pissing on the trail. The ground sloped down a bit off the path, and I heard him stumbling along before his steps faded away. It’s amazing how the trees just swallow sound. How sometimes you can hear the rustling of leaves dozens of yards away. And other times something could be traipsing along right next to you and you wouldn’t know.

I jumped at a loud thud to my left. Something had just hit the ground. I looked, but couldn’t see anything there. Another thud to my right. This time I felt flecks of dirt hit my pants. I swiveled my head to look, but was pretty sure I had an idea of what was hitting the ground around me.

“Ian. Dude, what are you doing?” I called out.

Another rock hit the ground nearby. I saw it, white in the moonlight, as it landed and bounced from the wet dirt into the trees behind me.

“Ian! Come on, man. That’s not funny. What if that hit me?”


Movement to my left. Farther down the trail this time. Not a rock. Tree branches were being pushed aside. A figure stepped out onto the trail. It was vaguely human in shape. No, the adrenaline was playing tricks on my eyes. It *was* human.

“Dude, are you serious. What the fuck?!” Ian spat as he jogged toward me.


I started to ask him what was wrong, but he whispered “Go, go, go, go, go!”

We caught up to the group and didn’t really talk until we got back to camp. Ian looked pretty shaken. He asked me if I had been calling his name. I told him I had and that I called his name to get him to stop throwing rocks at me. He didn’t know what I was talking about and denied throwing anything. He said as soon as he stopped to take a leak, he heard me calling his name from *deeper* into the woods. He thought it was some kind of trick. Like, somehow I had managed to run past him into the forest without him knowing.

I told him foxes and coyotes make all sorts of noises and sometimes even sound human. He probably just got spooked and thought he heard his name. But he was adamant that it was *my* voice. I asked him if the voice said anything else, and he told me it did, but he couldn’t understand it. He said it had all the cadence and intonation of someone speaking English but that it didn’t make any sense. Like audio played backward or hearing someone talking on the other side of a wall. Except this was clear and loud enough that he believed he should have been able to understand it.

I joked that maybe he’d had a mini-stroke and was hearing me yell at him about the rocks but couldn’t understand me. He didn’t laugh.

He just looked at me and said, “It sounded like something trying to imitate the way a person talks.”

At this point, I’d had about enough of Ian. He might have outranked me and yeah he was the owner’s brother, but this was going too far. He had clearly been throwing rocks at me, then made up this story to convince me there’s something in the woods that’s not quite human. Like a skinwalker with a speech impediment, I guess. He claimed he walked toward the voice for a few yards, got spooked, and ran back in the wrong direction, which is why he came out at a different point on the path than where he went in. I thought he was trying to circle behind me to sneak up and scare the living daylights out of me, and I just happened to catch him, so he made this whole backward talking wendigo story up to make up for the fact he failed to scare me.

That would have been nice if it were true.

The following day, we set up a Karate-themed obstacle course for the kids. It was in an area where the trails were wide and grassy. I got the impression it was once a clean cut part of the forest with patches of shrubbery that had now grown into tall, dense thickets or trees and bushes. This created a kind of maze of these open grassy paths weaving between the thickets. The grass was perfect for rolling or falling on. So, we walked the kids through the course once and had them practice rolling over a log. Or jump kicking off a tree. We told them they’d run from station to station and that instructors and junior instructors would be along the path to help direct them.

What we didn’t tell them was the instructors would actually be jumping out and throwing various Karate techniques at them and they’d have to defend themselves. It’s all in good fun. And of course we didn’t really attack the children. Just throw a slow and controlled punch or kick and let them block it. When they punched back, we’d go “Oh! Uh! Ow! You got me,” and fall down. It was funny, they enjoyed themselves, and they learned how to react to being surprised.

I was about halfway through the obstacle course right around a bend in the path from Ian. He had been assigned mae geri (front kicks). And I had been assigned shomen uchi, which is better known as the “Karate chop.” So, whenever I heard Ian screaming while he scared the shit out of a kid, I’d hide behind a tree and get ready. There were no forks in the path between Ian and myself, so when the kid was done pummeling him, they’d run around the corner and past me. That’s when I’d jump out, arm held high and screaming like a maniac. Rinse, repeat.

This went on for a while. The last kid to come through was this little guy named Zach. I could tell it was him because of the way he fearlessly laughed as he punched and kicked Ian around the corner. Zach was the high energy kid who always got put in time out but also had a really great personality. The kind of kid who his teachers probably beg for him to be on AD/HD meds. All energy; no focus. All of us had a special place in our hearts for Zach because that is exactly the type of kid who grows up to teach martial arts once they learn a little self-discipline.

I heard his last giggly kick as Ian yelled, “Okay, okay, I’m down. Keep going to the next station!” Zach giggled one more time, and I hid behind the tree. I waited for a few seconds and then peered out to see if I could see movement through the thicket.

I spotted it. Something was moving, but it couldn’t be Zach. It was too tall and it wasn’t running. It was Ian. He rounded the corner rubbing his arm. His smile faltered. He looked perplexed for a moment then smiled again.

“Man, he got me good,” he said, rubbing his ribs. “Did…did you attack him, or did he run right past you?”

“You mean Zach?” I asked. “Isn’t he behind you?”

I glanced back through the thicket. I didn’t understand what was going on. Ian was walking my way because the activity was over. But he wouldn’t leave a kid at his station. Ian seemed to figure out what I was thinking and simply said, “He came this way. You must have missed him.”

“No…no no no…” I said, as I jogged past him and looked around the bend. I could see the grass matted down where Ian had fallen to the ground over and over. One of the other instructors was walking toward me. I called to him and asked if Zach ran back that way, but Ian interrupted me.

“Dude, I’m telling you he came your way. He must have run by you and you didn’t—”

“No,” I interrupted him back, firmly and clearly. There’s a tone of voice used in Karate dojos that means “listen to me, this is serious.” It’s not the same as barking commands. It’s quiet but urgent. It must come from Japanese culture. I can’t describe it in writing well, but the gist of it is you look the person square in the eye and lower your voice, forcing them to listen more closely. When I looked at Ian and did that voice, he understood.

He immediately began looking into the tree line and calling for Zach. At this point, the other instructor had caught up to us and began searching too. Sensei Jason came from the opposite direction, and I explained what had happened. He went to the end of the course to do a head count of the kids and check if Zach had somehow found a shortcut.

There were plenty of connected branching paths and multiple ways to navigate the maze, but none of these branches occurred between where Ian and I had been stationed. He took the other instructor and decided to explore some of the paths we didn’t use for the obstacle course. One would head back towards the beginning, the other would go meet Jason at the end. I stayed put convinced Zach was hiding in the trees, unaware of how dangerous his little prank was. 

After a minute of walking up and down the trail, peering behind trees when I could, a rock hit the ground next to me. *Great,* I thought. *This whole thing’s probably Ian’s idea.* And sure enough, I heard Zach giggle about ten feet into the treeline. That’s the thing about kids trying to pull off pranks: they’re terrible at keeping a straight face.

“Hiya!” he giggled. Yes, Karate practitioners actually yell “hiya” sometimes.

“Gotchya!” I bellowed as I stomped through the underbrush amongst the trees. I nearly tripped and broke my neck on some vines, but I kept my composure. Gotta look intimidating. A rock whizzed past my head.

“Hey! Cut that out!” I shouted in my most stern voice.

Zach shouted something back that I couldn’t understand. Giggly gibberish.

“Dude, where are you?” I asked, spinning around and weaving between the trees where I thought he should be. A rock landed next to me.

“Seriously! Stop that!”

More giggling. More gibberish. And that’s when I noticed something. It wasn’t that the laughter made him hard to understand. I couldn’t understand him because he simply wasn’t speaking words. It sounded like words—had the cadence of human speech—but it just wasn’t. In fact, the giggling was slightly wrong too. It paused too abruptly at times. And it was the same three syllables on loop. A sputtering imitation of a child’s laughter.

I looked down at the leaves near my feet where the most recent rock had fallen and realized something I had only unconsciously been aware of. That stone had fallen straight down. A shadow crept across the ground and enveloped me as something moved into place directly overhead, rustling the branches of the tree. I couldn’t tell what it was by the shadow it cast, but I knew for certain it was bigger than an eight-year-old boy.

The laughter stopped.

“Hiya!” the imitation of Zach’s voice rang out in the dead silent forest. No birds. No bugs. Just us.

I ran. Or rather, I jumped. With three bounding leaps, I cleared the vines and rocks in the underbrush and made it to the grassy trail where I broke into a dead sprint. And well, you already know the rest from there. I didn’t stop running until I found the rest of the group. No, I didn’t look back. Yes, I got the impression it was chasing me. And no, I didn’t tell anyone but Ian what happened. And that was the last time either of us spoke about it.

They never found Zach. Park rangers and police and volunteers tried. They found his shoes about a mile from where he vanished. Ian and I were questioned. The dojo got some hate mail. The press treated us fairly, I think. But the fallout was more than the little business could handle. No one wants to send their kids to hang out at the dojo that loses kids in the woods. The school shut down, and good riddance. I haven’t been able to practice martial arts since then.

Ten years on, I have a new job and new hobbies. Zach would be eighteen if he’d had the chance to grow up. There’s a Karate school near my house, and I think about him every time I pass it. And sometimes, when I see the little kids being dropped off by their parents—in their tiny uniforms and colored belts—I can still hear him laughing.
