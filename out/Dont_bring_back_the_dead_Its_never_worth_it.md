“‘If you wish to bring the dead to life, consider the following:

Does the person want to be brought back? Once dead, they may come to accept their fate and no longer wish to live. They also may have already accepted death while alive, which is most often true for martyrs and the terminally ill. If possible, ask your loved ones whether they would like to be revived. While their opinion may change post mortem, it’s good to get a general idea of what they *think* they want.

Are you willing to die for them? The revival process is extremely dangerous, having killed my brother Cliff in our early testing. Would your death be a fair cost for the continuance of theirs? There’s also no guarantee the procedure would be successful, so your death may be in vain. Be sure to inform your living relatives and friends about your intent before you act, and be clear whether or not you wish for them to risk their lives to finish what you started.

Can you afford for them to come back? Revival takes a tremendous amount of precious resources and energy to perform consistently, with my first successful revival costing at least one billion dollars in total. Additionally, upkeep and maintenance on a revived human is significantly more difficult than that required from an organic human. Unless the person you’ve chosen to revive has the cure for cancer or can print money, you’re in for a wild ride trying to pay for all the necessary labor and materials.

With all that in mind, it’s *almost* never worth it.’

So, what do you think?” I asked, looking up from my laptop.

“Hmm.” The synthetic drone filled my ears. He still hadn’t adjusted to his metallic body or its artificial voice box. Had he still been flesh and bone, perhaps the gentle murmur would have been inaudible. Now being steel and silver, he was completely unaware of his volume. Thinking about it, I became concerned he may not have heard my reading. His vision was still too blurred for him to make sense of any text, so he had asked me to read it aloud. I assumed he would be able to hear since I had talked to him for a while after he woke up, but then I remembered I had been yelling and he still had trouble understanding me.

“Did you hear me?” I blurted, quieter than I intended. The yellow glow from his perfectly circular eyes had been occasionally flicking, and only then did I realize he was looking at each of my eyes, one at a time. Perhaps his vision had improved. I wondered if he could see the bookshelf behind me, or the desk between us, or the laptop in front of me. I then thought of his hearing again. I wondered if he could hear the whirring of the motors in his eyes, or the gentle thumping of the engine in his chest. A false heartbeat. A false body. A false brother.

“Yes I did, Pat” boomed from the speaker where his mouth should be, “Loud and clear. I do have one question, though: who are you writing this for?”

“Other scientists, mostly. It’s supposed to be a, uh, cautionary tale. Like, uh, Frankenstein.” I felt my stomach start to seize up.

“Cautionary. Interesting.” He looked away and started pacing, shaking the room with each step. “Cautionary” he repeated again, and again, quieter each time. He doubled back, took another step, then turned to me again. He leaned in close. “I don’t think you understand what I’m asking for. I don’t want an instruction manual with a warning. I want a declaration of impossibility. I want a commandment of immorality.”

“Cliff, people are going to use this technology whether you want them to or not. Nothing we write would be enough to stop them.” I tried to choose my words carefully, but I couldn’t contain my spite. “Someone is going to figure out how to do what we did sooner or later, and I’d rather they get practical advice instead of a blanket ‘oh no please don’t do this.’ It wouldn’t work.”

“Listen!” He grabbed me by the shoulders with a swiftness I hadn’t realized his new form was capable of. “You don’t understand what it’s like. When that piston shot through my head, it hurt like hell. At that point, it was the worst pain I had ever experienced. But then it started to fade.” He let go and stood tall. “It all went away, all the pain and worry and, and anger, and the only thing left was peace. For one instantaneous moment, I was nothing. No feeling. No pain. No thoughts. I was gone… and then, all that pain and chaos flooded back. That… explosion when I first woke up; it stuck with me. It was worse than death itself. No one deserves to go through that. No one in the entire world. Not even the most evil bastards in all of history deserve that. Coming back to life was the most painful thing I’ve ever experienced. I won’t let it happen again.” I sat there, shocked. He had mentioned how awful it felt to live again, but this was so much worse than I expected. I couldn’t accept that our lives’ work was over with nothing to show for it.

“This isn’t about you. This is about humanity itself. Death has been the one thing we’ve been unable to overcome for our entire existence, and we proved it can be beaten. It’s only a matter of time before this goes global and everyone will have the chance to live forever. Death will become a thing of the past, a-a choice for those who have lived thousands and thousands of lifetimes doing anything and everything they want!” No response. “Also, you'll be insanely rich. You want to make this about you? Let's make this about you. If we sell this tech to the richest bastards on the planet, you could have anything money can buy. Hell, you could have anything money can't buy, too. Maybe… maybe you could be my brother again. Cliff, isn’t that enough?”

A flash of movement and a loud buzzing noise, then my head swung to the side. I felt gentle pain all along the left side of my head and face, and I reached to find my jaw was far too low on the left side. I tried to bite down gently, but my whole head ached with pain. A popping noise rang out and I thought it was to my right, but in hindsight I think that was just due to my left ear not working. I felt something dripping out of my mouth, and I gingerly wiped my lower lip. I raised my hand and saw crimson fingers shaking before me. I wanted to scream. Another flash of movement and more buzzing, my desk was now turned over and pressed against the left wall. Bright yellow caught my eye, and I realized Cliff was now directly in front of me. Motors whirred then quieted as cold digits wrapped around my neck, and I felt my vision start to blur as my neck ached from the weight of my body hanging limp. I heard a crash, which was probably from him tossing my chair to the side, then my back erupted in pain as I was presumably slammed against the bookshelf behind me. All I could see now was the bright yellow light.

“No, Patricia. It’s not enough.” I heard the buzz of motors for a split second, then immense pain in my chest. More buzzing, then more pain. Even more buzzing, even more pain. With the final strike, I heard a crunching thud, and then my ears rang out. My vision faded. My body went numb. I was sure that I was dead. Then, with no buildup or warning, I was nothing. Just like Cliff said, I was completely devoid of sensation and thought. Just as suddenly as I had disappeared, it all came back. Confusion swelled inside me as I began to live once more. My vision was blurred, but I could see. My ears were ringing, but I could hear. My mind was filled with every possible emotion, but I could think.

Cliff murdered me three weeks ago, but it took two weeks to bring me back. Recovery and adjustment has been difficult, to say the least. Living with your own murderer can be a bit awkward at times. I still struggle to type with these bulky metal fingers. I regularly dissociate, like I’m down a dark tunnel and the world around me is at the very end. I lose track of time, where I am, what I’m doing, and I find it hard to believe I’m still alive. When I really slip and start to lose my sense of self, I think of that one moment where I was gone. I felt it for no longer than an eye is blinded by a blink, but it’s all I can think of. I can’t be certain I actually experienced death or if that lapse in consciousness was simply part of my rebirth, but I would rather be in that moment for millenia if it meant forgetting the pain of coming back. I know what Cliff means now. He showed me. I would have appreciated a bit more tact, but the message is clear. Rebirth is a far worse fate than death. I wish I had known that before bringing him back.

To anyone who has any reason to bring back the dead, this message is for you. Death is infinitely better than having it taken from you. I don’t mean that you should let people die, of course. Dying is a dreadful experience and if you can prevent them from dying, that’s ideal. But there’s a massive difference between dying and death. Dying is painful, slow, and confusing. Death, on the other hand, is completely neutral. Once you’ve crossed the border into lifelessness, never to come back, you’re nothing more than a memory. You can’t think, or speak, or act, or feel, it’s just nothing at all. For me, weeks passed by in an instant and I had no idea. For Cliff, it was years. While two firsthand accounts is a pretty limited dataset, I fully believe all those who have died exist in a permanent instant of peace. No matter how long they’ve been dead, they’re still in that moment forever and always. Don’t take that from someone. Don’t bring back the dead. It’s never worth it.

I’m sorry, Cliff.
