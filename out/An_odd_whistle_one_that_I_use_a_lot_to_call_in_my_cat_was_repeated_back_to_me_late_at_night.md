I live in Pennsylvania, and sure, I've had \*many\* paranormal experiences before, staring from age 6. I had stuff thrown at me in my house, in a playful manner, I've noted, I've seen hands, lights flicker when I ask a question, and have heard things. But this tops the fucking cake, as it terrifies the shit out of me. I do a high whistle to a low whistle to call my cat in whenever we let her out. A few nights ago, I was reading in my living room, and I heard the exact same whistle outside my window. Not like, "Oh, it was your neighbor" outside. No. It was dead outside, as if you could turn around, and see somebody in your window, right there, face shoved up against the screen. Albeit, I didn't see anything. I didn't want to look. It happened once, and I ignored it, and continued reading. Five minutes later, it happens again, and my cat comes over- keep in mind, my parents are downstairs at this time, watching television- and starts yowling at the window. I pick her up and take her to my room, and return to the living room, when it happens again. I'm still confused about this, and I've looked it up to see if it was a bird, and it's not. After the whistles, I've started seeing things more, I've also noticed. I've seen apparitions to full blown shadow figures, one mainly being a shorter woman or child, who I've named Elizabeth. She doesn't like it whenever I watch anything relating to ghost hunting, and begins tapping furniture around me rapidly. My parents haven't seen or heard anything, even when I do.

Does anyone have \*anything\* that they think might correlate with this and help me around with it? I'm genuinely fucking terrified- something I'm not, normally, with the paranormal- of this, as I've heard about malicious entities in my area. It hasn't occurred anymore, but today it hit me that the whistling was god awfully similar to my own whistle-call.

  
I'm not normally scared of the paranormal, but this, again, terrifies me. As an extra, I've played with demonic shit before, and I'm terribly regretful for that, as I've been diagnosed with plenty of stuff since, but now It's dwindled out as I've gotten cleansed recently. One of those cases from before I got cleansed was from a picture that a friend took of a necklace I'd gotten her. In the mirror by her vanity, there's one fucked up face. A \*very\* fucked up face. I cannot find the image she sent, and am currently contacting a mutual friend to see if they have it, as the first friend has since left spiritual and paranormal stuff. I'm actively seeking help from Elizabeth, but she's stopped doing her tapping thing when watching paranormal videos. I can hear her walking around when I'm home alone sometimes.

Please help me figure out what this thing is, and if I should be worried and concerned about it.
