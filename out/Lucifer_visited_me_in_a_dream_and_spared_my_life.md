I know the tittle sounds strange, and some of you migth even find my experience as blasphemous and I understand it, but it's something that happened to me a couple of years ago and I still remember it vividly. I'd like to apologize in advance for any grammar mistake I might make, but english is noty first language. 

Thing is, around the year 2020 or 2021 I started developing interest in Satanism and demonology. I had at the same time also started questioning God and some of his deeds, finding some of them bad and other plain hazardous. So I found the Satanic Bible (by Anton Lavey) and started reading it. Although it was interesting and very human I thought I needed to know more and went as far as looking for a translated version of the Codex Gigax and books of some sort. I was digging deeper and deeper into the matter until I eventually had to go to bed. That same night I had a lucid dream in which I think I met Lucifer and saw hell. 

Said dream started with me watching videos on my phone in a platform similar to youtube, and one of the videos had the title of "The truth about hell". It had no TW or anything so I clicked on it. Before watching the video I went to read the comments, and each of them had a warnings about how the video was cursed and horrible stuff happened after watching it. 

But of course I'm a big dumbass so I still decided to watch it. And the version of hell I saw was... Not what I quite expected. 

It was a wet wasteland, the sky was covered by grey clouds and every tree around (there weren't many) seemed to have been in a fire that had been extinguished by rain. The air was humid, cold and suffocating at the same time, and the few grass remaining was dry. There was no life around, no sound or anything. But the most disturbing thing was the sadness, loneliness and anguish of the atmosphere.

Soon enough the video was over and everything just went downhill from there. Everyone on my family started dying in such horrible ways it made the Final Destination saga look like a joke. My brother was the last one to die, and when I realized I was next and could do nothing to stop what was coming I decided to end my own life, and just when I was about to do it I "woke up" in the same dream. This time I was laying in bed, scared and confused, wondering why was I not dead. Then I sat up and saw him for the first time. 

He was sitting on the edge of my bed, and was not facing me, he had huge wings and clothes I could only describe as the ones of an ancient soldier. And he was very, VERY handsome. I immediately knew he was Lucifer, so I just asked why hadn't he taken my life. He turned around and answered with a sad and deep voice voice: "I won't be taking you this time, but you must stop diving into things you know you cannot control." or something like that. 

After that I woke up for real, and remembering the words he said I deleted the books I had downloaded, one except the Satanic Bible, which I still read on time to time. I never had a dream like that again, and decided to take it easy when it comes to religious matters. But from that day on, no matter what people says or whether that dream was just a dream or something more, I cannot stop thinking that despite anything the bible says about him, Lucifer spared my life and soul, and maybe who knows, he isn't as bad as we've been taught to think he was.
