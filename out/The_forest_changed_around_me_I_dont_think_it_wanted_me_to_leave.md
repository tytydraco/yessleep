I arrived near Carrizo Springs Campground on a Saturday morning in late May and started west. My destination was Cone Peak, a barren crag towering high above the Santa Lucia Range. In this isolated stretch of California’s central coast, wildfires and landslides erase trails as fast as they’re blazed, reshaping the land with every season. This is no place to travel alone.

Nobody knew I was out there. I didn’t leave a note or send a text. I brought a small daypack, a day’s supply of food, and 2.5 liters of water. No iodine tablets. No satellite phone. I figured I’d be back in six hours

The first few miles felt easy. I climbed through dry brush and blooming deerweed humming with bees. Monkeyflowers lit up the path, catching the sun’s orange glow. But the chaparral scrub offered no shade, and the yellow sandstone beneath me radiated heat as morning turned to early afternoon. 

My shadow grew long as I approached the final mile of my ascent. I pulled out my phone to check the time: 4:37 PM. Odd—I could have sworn it was still early afternoon. Maybe the heat was messing with my sense of time. Still, the days were long this time of year. If I picked up my pace, I’d have no trouble making it back before dark. 

As I neared the summit of Cone Peak, the trail narrowed into a knife-edge ridge. One wrong step in either direction and I’d fall hundreds of feet. But the cool wind rising from the ocean below put me at ease. I paused to eat lunch and snap a few photos of the vast network of ridges and valleys stretching out to the ocean below.

As I reached for my phone, a sudden gust knocked me off balance. I slipped and tumbled off the edge. The world spun around me as I slid down the cliff, scraping against loose rock and brittle roots. Then I stopped—my back slamming hard against rock as I swung backward. My pack had snagged on the gnarled limb of a bristlecone fir, leaving me dangling over the canyon by my shoulder straps. I clawed at the branch and pulled myself back to solid ground. 

My backpack was in rough shape. The seam above my right shoulder strap clung by a few threads. My back was bruised, and my shoulders ached. Worse, the larger of my two water bottles had fallen down the cliff and out of sight. My remaining bottle was half-full. 

Shaken, I pressed on, reaching the summit soon after. Two hikers stood beneath a boarded-up fire lookout at the summit, gazing west over the Pacific. I didn’t speak to them. Something about them made me hesitate. It wasn’t fear, exactly, but an unease I couldn’t explain. From where I stood, I couldn’t quite make out their faces. Just the stillness. The way their heads tilted ever so slightly, like they were listening for something I couldn’t hear.

I began my descent into the valley scored into the peak’s western flank. Soon, the trail turned to granite scree. Charred pine trunks blocked the switchbacks, and I scrambled over them until I reached Trail Spring Campground, or at least what was left of it. A small creek ran between a ring of rocks and a burnt Forest Service sign. The only evidence people ever stayed there. 

Deerbrush and poison oak swallowed the trail beyond. I spotted pruned branches every few yards. Someone had passed this way recently, cutting a path. My phone, on airplane mode to save battery, showed me I was close to the junction back to Carrizo Creek Trail. Less than a mile to go, I thought. Then five miles downhill to my car. 

But something felt wrong. The trail of pruned branches stopped. The path vanished. My phone said I was only a hundred feet off the trail, so I climbed up a deadfall to get my bearings. I spun around, and the path I’d come up was gone. Mountains rose where none had been before. New valleys cut into the slopes around me. Dense pine forests shaded the once open shrubland. I pushed through the brush toward where the trail should be, but thorns clawed at me, pulling me back. Something snagged my pack. I lunged forward, the strap snapped, and I slammed hard onto the ground. 

When I stood up, my phone was gone. 

I searched. I climbed back up the log. I crawled on my hands and knees. Nothing. The GPS, my only guide, had disappeared. 

I scanned the valley. To the south: brush and trees. To the west: a steep drop. East: a wall of green forest. The sun baked the ridge above me. I was filthy, bruised, dehydrated, and lost. 

I found shade beneath a low elderberry tree and curled up beneath its branches. I remembered my chest strap had a whistle built in, so I blew Morse code, S.O.S., I think. But there was no one to hear it. The sound swept up into the wind, the forest leaving nothing behind. 

And then I slept. 

\*\*\* 

I woke to the sound of chewing. My mouth was dry, and my eyes stung as I forced them open. The canopy above flickered with moonlight, shadows dancing across the bed of pine needles around me. 

I jolted upright and the noise stopped. The paws of dozens of gray chittering forms dug into my skin as they raced across my arms and legs. My backpack, hanging on by its remaining strap, was riddled with holes gnawed through its fabric. The swarm of mice vanished into the brush, leaving behind torn scraps and glimmering bits of a Cliff Bar wrapper. 

They had found my food. 

I leapt from the brush. More mice scattered. They’d chewed through the plastic, ruined everything. All my food was gone.

They watched me. Tiny pairs of eyes in the brush, glinting in the moonlight. Hundreds of them. Unmoving. 

A branch snapped behind me, and they scattered out of sight. I looked back at an open woodland extending to the edge of a steep slope. 

The forest was still. 

I heard running water somewhere below. Or maybe wind. But the sound seemed to move as I listened, like it was circling me. 

I started downhill, forcing my way through brush. I pulled back as I stumbled onto a stone precipice. I looked down at the bottomless canyon shadowed from the moon’s glow. Then the terrain gave way beneath me.

I raised my arms to protect my head as stones battered me from all directions. Great trees groaned and snapped under the avalanche of falling debris. Branches slashed my skin. Gravity turned sideways, the Earth shifting on its axis, pulling me into the abyss. 

\*\*\*

I awoke atop a pile of rubble. Pain radiated from my already bruised shoulders and blood dripped down my arm. The sky was black. I must have tumbled hundreds of feet, maybe more. My leg throbbed. I sat up, brushing sand from my tattered shirt. Nothing was broken, I think, but walking would be harder now.

I stood on the canyon floor among boulders weathered smooth by millennia of rushing water. The air was cool, and alder trees loomed above me, their leaves whispering even though there was no breeze. I searched for the creek I passed back at the campground. It must have drained into this valley. Nothing. The creek bed was dry. 

But something else was there. Shapes in the woods. Not animals. Not human. The kind of thing you don’t see, but feel. Like static in the air. It beckoned me closer, and my blood turned to ice. 

I spun away and ran downstream, scrambling over rockslides and tangled branches as the forest collapsed around me. Time no longer flowed—it pulsed. Trees burst from bare soil in an instant, towering overhead before erupting into flame, blazing against a starless sky. The air roared with heat as a strong headwind fed the growing inferno. Still, I pushed forwards, my shadow dancing across the path ahead cast from orange flame.

As I ran, the endless night grew tired of its pursuit. The ground below me was ash, and the silhouettes of burned trees smoldered below a gray sky. A low mist hung in the air, and steep canyon walls surrounded me on both sides. The way forward, downstream, seemed clear now. 

Soon, the sun crested the cliffs above, flooding the canyon with golden light. A canopy of poplars swayed gently in a warm breeze. Cicadas shrieked from the treetops as the sun rose higher overhead. 

Gradually, the steep cliffs flanking the riverbed gave way to a forest of walnuts and sycamores. By midday, I heard a new sound: a car rushing down a highway. 

Then another. 

I pushed forward faster than I thought possible, driven by the fear that if I stopped, the forest would pull me back under. I broke through a wall of bramble and staggered onto pavement. 

Highway 1. 

I don’t remember who picked me up. I was blinking in the sunlight, unable to speak. They drove me to the hospital in Monterey. I was dehydrated, bruised, and covered in shallow cuts, but alive. 

I checked out of the hospital that same evening. It was June 1^(st). I had been gone for over a week. But to me, it had only been a day. Maybe two. I’m not sure if I blacked out… or if it was something else.

I spoke to a ranger in the lobby on my way out. My roommate had returned home from summer vacation and reported me missing three days earlier. I tried to explain the events leading up to that day. He told me the trail I was trying to take was impassible. It had been destroyed years ago in a landslide. Nobody prunes it. 

He handed me my phone. It turned up in the parking lot by my car, 20 miles across a mountain range from where I ended up on Highway 1. It was lying face-up on the gravel, battery dead.
