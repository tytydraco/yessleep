For the previous five years, I’ve received a letter on November 20th from the state penitentiary.

He’s never forgotten my birthday—never forgotten anything actually. He has one of those memories—not photographic—I can’t recall the name off the top of my head, but it’s the one where you remember everything you’ve ever seen or read.

Anyway—a true genius.

And though I hadn’t been able to stomach a visit where I’d have to sit across from the monster wearing my brother’s skin, I still accepted his letters.

Because for a moment, while I poured over the neatly scripted words, I could repress what he did.

For a moment, I could just remember him as he was when we were children—the smartest person I’d ever known, and my best friend.

Not the murderer.

Not the devil.

I was only fifteen when they put him away for two consecutive life sentences.

That afternoon will be burned in my brain forever.

Coming home from school—the smell of iron when I entered the house—the sound of my brother sobbing in their bedroom.

The sight of my parents’ bodies, shredded beyond recognition.

It was the day I became an orphan.

He never spoke a word in his defense—never gave an explanation.

And I never forgave him.

But even considering I didn’t respond, he continued to write my annual birthday message—often recounting some happy memory from our childhood.

Filled with apologies I didn’t care to hear.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

The first arrived after he’d been locked up for just a few months.

I moved in with my grandmother after my parents’ deaths and was struggling in school. It was hard to focus on anything other than… *it*…

Especially because I had no answers as to why *it* happened.

My brother loved my parents, and they loved him. There was never anger or abuse in our household—Richard was lined up to go to MIT in the Fall.

We were happy.

The only clue I had was that about a month before *it* transpired, Richard’s behavior changed. He stopped hanging out with his friends—retreated to his room right when he got home and would only come out for meals. And normally we’d play video games or chess together in the evenings, but we hadn’t exchanged so much as two words with each other in weeks.

Also, he was… *jumpy.*

Could be startled by a butterfly level jumpy.

My parents and I chalked it up to nerves about going away to college, but after they were gone, I wondered if he hadn’t known what he was going to do, and was just working up the “courage” to do it.

Maybe he’d always been a monster, or maybe something simply snapped.

Whatever the case, I hoped he would finally explain things in his letter as we hadn’t spoken since the day he was arrested.

But I was disappointed.

All it read was…

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Happy Birthday Jason,*

*I wish I could be there.*

*It’s hard to believe still that I’ll never celebrate another one with you outside of here, and I’m sorry that it has to be like this.*

*There is so much I want to tell you, but for now, all that matters is that you’re safe.*

*And I’d rather focus on happier thoughts.*

*I still remember Mom and Dad bringing you home from the hospital. You were so tiny, and I was terrified that I’d drop you. I practiced holding bags of flour in the mirror to hone my technique.*

*You were such a gift to us—so precious—so small.*

*And now you’re a fully grown man.*

*Sixteen is such a fun age—Grandma told me she got you a car. Be careful out there (but also… tear it up a little bit).*

*I miss you, but I understand why you have not come to see me.*

*Please know how deeply I regret what happened, and how terrible I feel for the impact their deaths had on you.*

*I don’t fault you for your feelings towards me—I would not forgive me either.*

*But I love you, and I always will.*

*Richard*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I’m not sure what I expected.

It’s not like anything he would have said would have “made it all better.” Yet, I still found myself hollow when I finished reading. Partially due to the bitterness I felt towards him, and partially due to the guilt I felt for leaving him to rot in there without so much as a “hello” from me.

For fifteen years—my entire life—Richard was my best friend. He watched over me, protected me from bullies, taught me more than I ever learned in school—he was everything I aspired to be.

No matter how much I wanted to hate him, and no matter how horrified I was at what he’d done…

I missed him too.

But I was sixteen—I had friends and a car. It was easier for me to paint him as despicable and deserving of his fate—my grandma quickly learned to stop asking whether I’d come with her to the prison.

It’s possible she said something to him about “giving me some time” to come around—it’s possible he inferred by my lack of reply that it was best to keep his distance.

Either way, it wasn’t until my next birthday that I heard from him again…

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Happy Birthday Jason,*

*Another year gone passed—I hope you are well.*

*Prison life is a lot duller than they make it out in the movies. Mostly I play chess and board games with other men serving life sentences. As none of us have any hope of release, we just whittle away the days waiting for the end…*

*It’s tedious, but I’m okay. All I need is to know that you’re safe and you’re happy to get me through the long hours.*

*If you can never stomach direct contact, the updates from Grandma will be enough for me, but it would be great to hear from you.*

*I know it’s only been a couple birthdays, but it already feels like ages that we’ve been apart.*

*I mean, you’re seventeen already—soon you’ll be graduating! The little boy that used to stalk me and my friends around the neighborhood all day is nearing adulthood.*

*You’re going to go on to do something incredible, I just know it.*

*You were always the better of the two of us.*

*I love you,*

*Richard*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I never understood why he, the most intelligent person to ever come out of our small town, thought so highly of me, but he used to say that smarts weren’t everything. His brains didn’t much matter anymore anyway—all of his talents were going to waste—his highest aspiration likely to be becoming the prison chess champion.

And I was doing my best on the outside to get back to some semblance of normalcy. Seventeen was an interesting age for me—I got my first girlfriend, had my first beer. Things I wished I could share with him. Especially once I managed to turn things around in school and pull my grades up.

I wanted to reach out—I wanted to have my brother back. But every time I even got close, the image of him smiling or laughing was rapidly replaced by that of him covered in blood.

And what happened next did not help.

Eight months after my seventeenth birthday, they found Richard’s cellmate ripped to pieces.

Even though there was a mountain of evidence against him, and even though he had pled guilty to the charges, I had always held onto some level of doubt that he had actually murdered our parents. Call me an apologist, but a little safe-space in my brain created scenarios in which someone broke in—committed the atrocity—and my brother was just too traumatized to recall it properly.

But there was no denying it now.

Same method—same man left alive afterwards—no one else with access to their cell that night.

He was a killer.

A cold-blooded killer.

How my grandma continued to visit him was beyond me, but she always said, “he’ll never stop being my grandson.”

Love is a strange thing.

In that same spirit, I couldn’t bring myself to throw out his next letter when it inevitably arrived. And so, instead I read…

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Happy Birthday Jason,*

*I hate to start off with morbidity, but I’m sure you’ve heard what happened to my cellmate...*

*I don’t care what anyone else thinks of me, but I haven’t been able to sleep with the burning notion that you may be even more disgusted with me now than you were before.*

*I won’t make any excuses or claim there was a mistake. I just want you to know that what happened to him, and what happened to our parents, does not truly reflect who I am—I may be flawed, but I am not an evil person.*

*There’s not much more I can say in my defense—guilty and innocent are relative terms…*

*In any regard, they’re going to isolate me from now on—probably for the best—I told them not to put me in a double in the first place…*

*I wish I could take everything back, but as I can’t, I only wanted to wish you a Happy 18th* *Birthday, and congratulate you on getting into your dream college.*

*You killed it, despite everything. Finished with honors—a huge scholarship.*

*I’m so proud!*

*You being out there and living your best life is what keeps me going.*

*I love you,*

*Richard*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Guilty and innocent are relative terms…”

What a cop out.

Again, he didn’t deny his involvement, but he didn’t exactly admit to the act either. I found myself furious too that he’d effectively described my orphanhood as being due to him being “flawed.”

FLAWED?!

How about sick? How about fucked up? Or yea, how about evil? I couldn’t comprehend that with three bodies under his belt—horribly mutilated bodies—that he would try to claim that he wasn’t an “evil” person.

How the two of us had been raised in the same household under the same tutelage and come out with such wildly different moral compasses baffled me.

I didn’t want his congratulations or his pride in me—all of my successes over the previous two years were my own, “despite everything.”

I just wanted him to go away.

I wanted to never hear from him again.

That day, I swore I wouldn’t open anymore of his correspondence—swore I’d have Grandma tell him not to send any more mail.

But she wore me down over the next year.

She told me that he was not doing well in isolation—looked thinner every time she went up there. I brushed her off until she showed me a photo of the two of them from her most recent trip.

He looked like a completely different person.

The blue eyes that used to pierce through you were now sunken and dark—his deep-brown hair was now flecked with gray, unkempt, and thinning. It was hard to believe that the man standing next to Grandma was nearly sixty years her junior—he’d aged enormously.

Again, I felt the hollow guilt at refusing to give him even the dimmest hope that he still had a brother that loved and supported him.

And, as she told me it was the only thing he was looking forward to, I decided, at least, not to tell her to stop him from writing to me.

Away at college when the next came in, I received his letter a day late through the University mail, and I waited until my roommate left me alone before unfolding it on my desk.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Happy Birthday Jason,*

*Hopefully I got your new address right—Grandma was “pretty sure” she gave me the correct dorm room number.*

*There’s not much to update on my end. I’d be lying to say it’s been great for me, but I’m getting by—I read a lot. And at least the guards treat me relatively well, given what I’m in here for.*

*But today is a good day—writing to you is the highlight of my year.*

*It always makes me nostalgic for when we were kids.*

*Things were simpler then.*

*Sitting down to pen this, I tried to think of my favorite memory of you and I landed on when we found Buttons starving in the backyard.*

*A helpless little kitten, and you nursed her back to health—eventually made her the fattest cat on the block. You were so gentle—so caring—relentless in your efforts to save her.*

*Sounds like she’s doing well now living with Grandma—I’m glad for that.*

*Also, sounds like you’re doing incredible in college—I’m glad for that too.*

*Your last year as a teenager. I know your studies are important, but don’t forget to let yourself have some fun.*

*I really miss you bro. It’s been torture to spend these years without you.*

*I love you,*

*Richard*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was rich of him to use the term “torture” knowing what he’d put others through.

But rather than the fury I’d felt reading some of his previous words, I was surprised by my reaction.

I began to sob.

And sobbing turned into torrents of emotion long-overdue for release.

It was the cat—the stupid cat. My wonderful, beautiful, little baby.

If his goal was to drag up a memory that might spark deep-repressed feelings of compassion for him, he’d chosen well. He was giving me all the credit, but we’d worked in shifts those first few days to keep Buttons alive until we were certain she was healthy enough to spend even a minute alone.

Now, away at college, and away from her furry little face—I wept lonely tears. Missing her, missing my grandma, missing Mom and Dad.

Missing him.

But…

It was his fault…

It was his fault that he was locked up—his fault that Mom and Dad were gone.

His. Fault.

My sympathy waned quickly and I vowed again not to forgive him.

For another year, he’d receive only silence from me.

Being away at school, Grandma could not hound me as often to display empathy towards him—college was rife with distractions, and before I knew it another year passed.

Another letter was delivered…

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Happy Birthday Jason,*

*Welcome to your twenties.*

*I’m not sure where to begin this year.*

*Since I wrote last, things have… deteriorated…*

*I know I’ve said in the past that it’s okay for you not to write back and it’s okay that you don’t visit, but… I just… I’d really like to see you.*

*Please.*

*You must be so angry with me—you deserve to be.*

*But, just one time, I want to see your face again—even if there’s only hatred in your eyes.*

*Maybe you could come with Grandma? Attached are the dates she plans to visit next year. Maybe you can match one of them up with a school break?*

*Please—I need you, Jason.*

*I love you,*

*Richard*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Grandma warned me that this one might be different—the only word she could think to describe him anymore was, “desperate.”

She was worried about him—wouldn’t even send me the most recent photo they took together.

And it scared me.

Whatever my feelings towards him, I was not ready for him to die too. He was the last remaining member of my immediate family—the last remaining tie that I had to my life “before.”

Maybe it had been long enough? Maybe I would be able to put enmity aside to meet his wishes?

I checked the dates he’d provided and there wasn’t one that lined up well with any of my breaks. And I didn’t feel right, after all this time, writing him a letter—if I was going to communicate with him, it was going to be face-to-face.

For the next year, I really did plan to make it to the prison. But whenever Grandma went, I was busy with schoolwork, or finals, or at the internship that I was working over the summer.

Of course, part of me wasn’t trying very hard to move my schedule around—the part of me that was terrified to look him in the eyes.

It always seemed like there’d be more time—he was young, I told myself, he wouldn’t just waste away so easily.

Yet on my birthday this year—no letter arrived.

It had been delayed before, and I had moved to a new apartment, so I considered that maybe it’d been lost in the mail.

But on Nov. 22nd, Grandma received a call from the prison.

Richard was dead.

He’d hung himself in his cell.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

They asked her what she wanted to do with the body—I was in shock the entire time she talked through the options with me over the phone.

Though it didn’t take long for my shock to convert to rage.

He’d taken my parents from me, and now he’d left me too.

Left without ever explaining—without ever telling me why.

I was empty.

And I didn’t care what they did with him.

Grandma asked if we should try to get him a plot close to our parents, but I convinced her that that was wrong—him having eternal rest near the people whose lives he’d stolen? It was egregious. I was all for throwing him in the prison graveyard, but Grandma wouldn’t have it—I’m not sure the prison would have agreed to it anyway given their limited space.

Eventually, we came to a compromise that we’d bury him in the plot next to hers and Grandpa’s as it was available, and we informed the prison that we’d take ownership of his body.

So, for the first time since he was incarcerated, I traveled with Grandma to the prison as there was paperwork that we both needed to sign for the funeral home to retrieve his remains.

The two-hour trek through windy, mountain roads gave me a new appreciation for my grandmother. For over five years, she’d made that drive countless times, alone, just to give a felon a little comfort. I felt the hollow guilt again that I’d always made her do it all by herself.

But it didn’t last long.

Soon, it was replaced with curiosity.

Because when they gave us the few possessions that he’d kept in his cell, they also handed me a letter…

My name was on the front, the correct address too—he’d clearly tried to post it to arrive on my birthday, as usual, but they’d never let it out of the prison.

When I asked them why they hadn’t sent it, they explained that, per standard procedure, it had been opened, and they needed to investigate it further before it was sent out.

However, given my brother’s passing, they no longer deemed it necessary to review.

Wondering why this letter would have warranted any further study than his previous birthday wishes, I opened it there in the office, and understood immediately.

It contained no words of apology or happy childhood memories—at least none that could be discerned right away.

It contained no words at all actually.

Scribbled on the neatly folded page in my brother’s handwriting was a list of number sets, with each containing one number followed by a dash followed by a second number.

1-X

1-X 3-XX 1-XX…

It went on and on.

And, at first, I had no idea what to make of it. I could see why they’d stopped it as they probably thought he was trying to plan an escape or some other criminal activity using a coded message.

They watched me scan the lines for signs of recognition in my eyes—signs that I knew something they didn’t, but finding that I was just as confused by it as they were, they shrugged, and let us leave.

More pissed off than I was before, I cursed Richard for giving me gibberish as a final birthday wish before he offed himself—surmising that his mind might have broken from being in isolation for so long.

But while Grandma rumbled the car along, I opened the letter again and inspected it more closely.

The first number before a dash was always 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, but the second ranged from 1 to over 200. They were clearly references to something—a cipher of some kind. But Richard hadn’t provided a key for it.

Unless…

He already had…

The letters.

Five previous letters.

Five keys.

Possibly, I considered, each number set referred to a word in them. 

Excitedly, I thought back to each of them and recalled that all five started exactly the same way.

*Happy Birthday Jason*

The first set of numbers in his code was 1-3.

First letter he'd written to me, third word.

*Jason*

Richard may have left me a final message after all...

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

But I would need to wait to try and decipher the rest of it.

Luckily, in a bout of sentimentality, I’d saved everything he’d written to me, but three of the letters were at my grandmother’s house and two of them were at my apartment in college mixed in with my school things.

With helping Grandma get ready for Richard’s funeral, I didn’t have much time for decoding anyway. And just as well, I thought, as with only the first three keys available to me, I could only partially reveal his note.

So, I tried my best to forget about it for the time being—I would be heading back to school after we interred him—I could wait for a few days while we said farewell to Richard.

I’m not sure why we bothered with all the fuss of holding a formal viewing and funeral services, though—Grandma and I were the only people in attendance. Seemed no one else deemed him worthy of their time.

It was a strange sight—him lying in a casket.

I hadn’t seen him, other than in my grandma’s photos, since they’d hauled him away following his sentencing. Back then, he still had life in his face.

They’d done their best to pretty him up, but there wasn’t much left of him to work with. The only remaining thing that allowed me to identify that it was even Richard was a small scar under his right eye from when he wrecked his bike once.

Grandma stayed back when I approached him—not ready yet to say her goodbyes, but I was eager to put him behind me.

And when I stood over his corpse, I expected my hatred to finally bubble over.

But I just felt sadness.

Crushing sadness.

Thinking about who he could have become, and how he ended up instead—it was tragic.

I reached forward and touched his hand.

And when I did, I felt…

*Something.*

Like a stranger watching me from the shadows. A darkness lurking just out of the corner of my eye.

Quickly, I pulled my fingers away, assuming my emotions had gotten the better of me in the moment.

But a weight remained.

Oppressive—suffocating.

I leapt a foot in the air when Grandma tapped me on the shoulder to ask if I was alright and I snapped out of it. But the next few days, the feeling of someone standing right behind me persisted at all times.

It made me twitchy…

*Jumpy…*

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

When I got back to school, the first thing I did was locate the remaining two letters I needed to decipher Richard’s final note. Then, laying the previous five out next to the most recent, I began to pick out the words he intended.

And, working line-by-line, I slowly revealed the following, cryptic message…

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

His intellect never failed to impress me.

Over five years in there, and if he was to be believed, persecuted by some sort of *presence* the entire time; yet, he still remembered every word of every letter he wrote me. *Exactly.*

I wasn’t sure whether I could believe any of it, though, and I was left with more questions than answers.

If that was what really happened, why did he go to such lengths to conceal it for all those years?

I supposed he thought the punishment he got was the best way to keep *it* away from everyone—wanted to avoid even a hint at an insanity defense. And maybe he worried that if he told me or Grandma after he was put away that we’d try to get him help—psychiatric or like an exorcism or something—and it could put everyone involved at risk. Although, I’m not sure they even allow that kind of stuff in prison…

There’s also a high likelihood that he specifically never said anything to Grandma because he was concerned that it would literally kill her (especially after all the strain he’d already put her through). It’s why I never plan to tell her—she has a healthy fear of spirits and a very unhealthy heart…

But why bother with encoding his final letter?

He knew they’d likely open it before allowing it to leave the prison—and he probably knew that with it being a code, they’d flag it. My leading theory is he thought that if they knew what it said, they would have taken measures to prevent him from *finishing* things—he couldn’t jeopardize the attempt.

And even if they hadn’t opened it—my guess is he assumed I wouldn’t have all five of the letters with me at school and wouldn’t be able to decrypt it the day I received it—keeping me from contacting the prison to stop him either.

Whatever his reasons for “explaining” things the way that he did, it all struck me again as a cop out—a way to deflect blame from himself. As his mind eroded in isolation, I wondered if he hadn’t conjured this “other” in his own head to dissociate himself from his actions.

Yet…

There was that darkness I felt when I touched him…

That weight that still hadn’t left me.

And, this morning, I swore—just for a second—that when I turned away from the mirror…

My smiling reflection lingered [behind...](https://www.reddit.com/r/DukeOfDepravity/)
