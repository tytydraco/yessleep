My name's Jessica, and my coworker is missing. He left a journal in the break room. Nobody else seems concerned, but if they'd read it... or even stood near it... they wouldn't be so calm.



The page edges were banded orange and red, and they smelled strange: sweet, but with a rotten edge that made my stomach turn. I put on disposable gloves and stuffed toilet paper into my nostrils before flipping through.



He wrote his entries as if they were for r/nosleep, each page reading like a live post. There's no trace online... just the journal. I copied everything before handing it to the police.



Blake, if you somehow see this: I'm sorry. I hope you're okay.



Here is everything he had to say:





\---

Entry #1:



\> Hey everyone! I figured what I'm going through right now is appropriate for r/nosleep because I'm experiencing just that. No sleep at all. I can't sleep. I have too much energy. So, so, so much energy.

\> 

\> My routine hasn't changed in years: I go to work, do my shift, go home. On the way back I grab groceries, then pass through the woods that separate my neighbourhood from the rest of town. Occasionally I'd hit up the dollar store for junk (chips, chocolate bars, pop) but I wanted to make a healthy change.

\> 

\> So I started looking for an alternative at the supermarket and noticed that big packages of carrots were super affordable, and wow... what a great buy. They're crunchy, sweet, refreshing, hydrating. They hit the same craving as the junk food did but without making me feel like trash after. I've even stopped going to the dollar store entirely.

\> 

\> It is 1:45 AM and I need to be up at seven. I don't always close, but when I do, staying up this late isn't a big deal since I can sleep in. Joking... not like I can sleep anyway. Or maybe I do sleep when I close my eyes and don't realize it. I don't know. I've never felt this good, and it's scary. Please tell me I'm just overthinking this and the diet change is simply tripping me up.

\> 

\> \*Edit: It's nearly 2:30 AM now. I know it's late and this is very stupid, but I really want to go eat some carrots. I just hope that my stomach doesn't bother me in the morning.\*





\---

Entry #2:



\> Hey guys. Been about a week with nothing new... until today. I'm still buzzing with energy. Maybe I'm sleeping more now that I try not to think about it. Anyway.

\> 

\> At the supermarket the organic carrots were on sale: buy 2, get 1 free. I figured, you know what? I'm on this carrot kick and I'm really enjoying them. So I ended up buying not three bags... I bought nine! A stock boy nearby glanced at the heaping mound in my cart, gave me a look, then went back to work. Rude. It's a sale, buddy.

\> 

\> At the checkout the cashier scanned bag after bag. She didn't give me a dirty look... just stared past me, spaced out. Out to lunch. Relatable. When I looked back, she was blankly staring at my carrots like she'd never seen food before. I almost said, "These are mine, shoo," but I just laughed and left.

\> 

\> On the way home, past the pond that's usually full of geese and ducks (sometimes a blue heron), it was absolutely silent. Not even a cricket. The forest after that sounded normal. I didn't think much of it until I sat down at home: the pond was too quiet. I don't even remember hearing the wind. Probably nothing. Maybe I'm not sleeping as much as I think. Oh well.





\---

Entry #3:



\> Something really weird happened tonight... and no, I didn't buy any more carrots. I still have a few bags at home. On my walk I passed a tree that looked... softly lit. I stopped, backed up, and stared. A dim pulse breathed from the trunk. Unnerving, but relaxing. You know when you're exhausted lights get a sort of crystalline halo? It was like that, but dimmer. Warmer. After what felt like eternity, but really no more than a few seconds, I kept going.

\> 

\> Maybe my eyes were playing tricks, but I could see better in the dark. People say carrots help eyesight (not really proven), but it kind of tracks in my head. Junk used to give me a sugar rush; maybe the carrots do their own version of that. Funny thought. Helps me tuck the unease in for a quick nap. I'm probably just not sleeping enough. Otherwise I feel fine.





\---

Entry #4: 



\> Hey, it's me again. The "carrot guy". Fine, laugh. After some DMs and a coworker nagging me, I'm going to weave something else into the carrot habit. Maybe broccoli. Not chips; that road's closed.

\> 

\> I grabbed a head of broccoli. I like raw broccoli. Absolutely underrated. It's good for you, so why not? But it just didn't hit the same as the carrots did. It wasn't hydrating, and it wasn't satisfying. A little crunch, mostly sponge. I tossed the rest into the woods for the critters. It's not wasting food. I'm sharing it with nature, okay?

\> 

\> \*Edit: Opened the shop this morning and the broccoli was still there. By evening it was brighter, the air around it stinging of sulphur. My stomach turned. A grown man afraid of broccoli. Embarrassing.\*





\---

Entry #5:



\> I've been wearing sunglasses outside for days. My eyes are ridiculously sensitive... I'm starting to think carrot poisoning might be real. Not sure. On the plus side, I look cool. If I don't joke, I'll lose my mind.

\> 

\> I cut through the familiar forest, past the dead-silent pond, and down to the supermarket. The carrots weren't on sale anymore... and worse, there were none left. Panic crept in. I asked a stock boy what was going on; he backed away and bolted. With nobody else around, I yelled at the produce: "Carrots are a very common vegetable. How can you be out?" Karen mini-tantrum achieved. I realized how ridiculous I was, mumbled an apology to the air, and ran out.

\> 

\> Thankfully I still have a couple bags left and... well, that's that.





\---

Entry #6:



\> My boss sent me home a few days ago. He said I was starting to look sickly and that I should go see a doctor. I could hear the panic in his voice; he's always been a pretty empathetic guy. I sighed, grabbed my things, and left. Was that the right move? Maybe I should've told him that I'm coasting on fumes and can't afford to not work.

\> 

\> Same old routine: walk home, through the quiet neighbourhood, past the quiet pond, through the quiet forest, and finally, to my quiet home. You know, I'm starting to get used to this new perception of mine. It's nice, albeit a bit concerning. I'm starting to think that my diet could be a bit unbalanced due to my little carrot craze I'm going through. Carrot juice? Nah, I need protein.

\> 

\> \*Edit: How about... pork? It can be sweet.\*

\> 

\> \*Edit: No\*





\---

Entry #7:



\> It's the next day now, and I'm bored. I've taken to tossing the carrot tops out of the window. They're always gone within the hour. Gone!

\> 

\> I still haven't gone to the doctor's, but unfortunately, when you're living in a small town, the walk-in clinic isn't available every single day. I have to wait until Saturday, so you guys will probably be hearing a lot more from me until then.

\> 

\> I'm out of carrots, but I don't feel like leaving the house even though I really, really want to pick up some more. It's just so bright out there. It's too bright. I'm thinking about waiting until nighttime and then going over to the supermarket.

\> 

\> \*Edit: I walked by Old Man Henry on the way to the woods to get to the supermarket, and he was glowing. He didn't look at me.\*

\> 

\> \*Edit: The broccoli's still there. Not a single floret touched.\*

\> 

\> \*Edit: I don't need my phone's flashlight anymore. Everything's quiet. A rabbit looked my way, unmoving. I stared back. It glowed too. It shimmered.\*





\---

Entry #8:



\> Got my carrots. It's like ever since I've downed a couple of bags of them, my energy has returned. I'm feeling like myself again. But there's no overcast today. It is a clear blue, sunny day, and I've had to close up all my curtains. I can't bear to see the sun right now. I don't know what's going on with me, but it doesn't matter. Got my carrots.

\> 

\> \*Edit: You know the humming sound of fluorescent lights? That's all I can hear when I peek out of the window at the woods. Between that and my heartbeat speeding up, I'm feeling a heavy dread swell up within me.\*

\> 

\> \*Edit: Still hungry. That rabbit looked kind of good. Fattened up now. But it glowed. Should I leave it alone? I'm torn. It can be torn, too.\*





\---

Entry #9:



\> I finally fell asleep, and the dream I had was strange. I was in a forest, a glowing forest, in the dead of night. It wasn't full of the usual trees and animals you'd expect around here.

\> 

\> I saw Old Man Henry there too, and everybody and everything glowed like they held the good sun inside of them. I basked in that warmth, and for the first time in my life, I felt right. I felt like I belonged.

\> 

\> \*Edit: I think I bit my cheek while I was sleeping. My mouth is crusted with a brittle layer of red stuff. Like dried candy, almost.\*





\---

Entry #10:



\> I've been lying around on the couch more, and I had another dream. I was sitting on Old Man Henry's porch, and we were talking. It was a great conversation, even though I don't remember a single word. I just remember the laughs, the gestures, the way we both leaned in like old friends catching up after many, many, many years apart.

\> 

\> Honestly, it was the best dream I've ever had. I'm thinking maybe tonight I'll go over and say hello to Henry.





\---

Entry #11:



\> I decided to brave the daylight for a little bit. I went outside with sunglasses and an umbrella, and I knew I looked like an absolute dork, but I had this overwhelming urge to go see Henry. He's retired and home all day, except when he's grabbing cigarettes and booze. He lives only a few blocks away, and when I got to his driveway his vehicle was there and his door was wide open... as if he was expecting me. I went inside.

\> 

\> In the dark he sat in his recliner with a bottle of whiskey beside him, smoking. He'd already gone through a pack. He rocked back and forth. The recliner squeaked. All I could hear was that damn buzzing. He looked through me, glowing brighter than anything I'd seen... but he wasn't friendly. Not at all. Between the buzzing, the stale smoke, and that sickly-sweet stink worked into my skin, I realized something: his glow was wrong.

\> 

\> You know, I thought I had the dream for a reason. Maybe, just maybe, Henry could be the friend I was looking for. But with his dead eyes and that menacing frown, all I could think about were the lovely carrots waiting for me back home. Sweet. Crunchy. Juicy.

\> 

\> \*Edit: I liked the way he swallowed.\*





\---

Entry #12:



\> One more day until the walk-in clinic is open. I checked my bank account... I'm almost in the red. I can't afford to be off work like this. It's not like it's paid sick leave or anything. My job isn't glamorous enough for that.

\> 

\> Saturday can't come soon enough. I need money. Money is what moves me, what moves all of us, underneath, over, inside, out. The stink of it, the greed of it, the germs passed from hand to hand. Money is perfect. Almost. There's only one thing in the world that really is. We all know what it is.

\> 

\> Speaking of: I was snacking on my favourite thing earlier, and it didn't taste as sweet. The crunch was there, but the sweetness, the thing that made junk food irresistible, was gone. Bitter now. Not broccoli-bitter, but close. I bet it's still sitting out there. Nobody touches it. Nobody wants it. As they shouldn't.

\> 

\> I still ate it all. The energy's back. It's very early, but I might go to the pond later.





\---

Entry #13:



\> Another post. What a surprise, right? Though I'm not really feeling like the carrot guy right now. They're just not doing it.

\> 

\> I went on my little walk, mid-afternoon, umbrella in hand, sunglasses on, and even though it's a pretty hot summer day, I covered my whole body. I didn't let a single piece show to that abhorrent lightbulb in the sky. I never thought I would hate a non-living entity, but here I am... even though it gives life to what I adore the most right now.

\> 

\> I walked through the forest. It was eerily quiet again, except for the sound of my bare feet snapping brittle sticks underfoot. I saw a glowing squirrel, and waved to it, smiling wide, making sure to show all of my teeth. See? No broccoli.

\> 

\> With great ease, I made it to the pond in long strides. There's a lone bench there, and I chose to sit, just staring at the still water, thinking about every little thing that I've experienced lately. Every thought is associated with carrots in some shape or form. What a journey. Hah.

\> 

\> After maybe 20 minutes, I stood up and walked to the water's edge, and looked down. In that moment, I finally understood why I was sent home and why no one has contacted me: why I've received no calls, no voicemails, no text messages. Exactly why everybody's avoiding me. In that choppy reflection, I looked taller. Darker. Brighter.

\> 

\> I think I'm going to go get some lunch.





\---

Entry #14:



\> It's a lovely night. I'm planning on going on another little walk. I was thinking about checking up on Old Man Henry, but he's not much of a talker... rude! Maybe I'll just wander about in the field and through the forest and see what I stumble upon. Maybe I'll find some other glowing things, and maybe I'll say hello.

\> 

\> Oh. And yes. The broccoli's still there. Sitting in perfect stillness and taunting everything around it. It hasn't wilted. It's still as green as the day I tossed it. And it still tastes horrible. Too bitter. Too spongy. Too soft. Lazily soaking up the bad sun's rays. I don't doubt it's spreading its rank tendrils.

\> 

\> \*Edit: I found some wild carrots. Ate one. Sweet.\*

\> 

\> \*Edit: I'm sleeping out here tonight. Feels better. Right?\*

\> 

\> \*Edit: I liked the way She looked at me.\*





\---

Entry #15:



\> It's Saturday morning. I woke up with my body sprawled out on the forest floor. Best sleep of my life; I can't even remember my dream.

\> 

\> Fine, I lied. I dreamt of Jessica, my coworker, laughing at my awkward jokes. I dreamt of Jessica, my only friend, crying over something that I couldn't do anything about. I dreamt of Jessica... a human. A friend. Rippled, like pond water.

\> 

\> My feet were burrowed into the ground. Chilly, but comfortable. I almost didn't want to go, but I figured I should. After a quick tug I stood, brushed off the leaves, and headed to the clinic. Left the dirt under my nails. Felt right.

\> 

\> The sliding doors didn't open until I banged. At the front desk, the receptionist didn't ask for my health card. I shrugged and went to the back corner. Sat on the cool floor, attentively listening to the ticking clock above. The lights hummed. The smell of antiseptic mixed with sugar.

\>

\> Beautiful. 

\> 

\> It was nice. Then a doctor called for me. I liked his tone.

\> 

\> \*Edit: Waste of time. When I took off my coverings, he said nothing. Just stared. Between that lacklustre, empty response and those exam lights beating down on me like noon sun, I boiled over. I snapped. I grabbed the chair, hurled it into the wall, and it splintered. Then I stormed out before I said something I'd regret. I'm going to work. I need money.\*

\> 

\> \*Edit: Instead of money, I found something else.\*





\---

\*\*Why did he mention me?\*\*





\---

Entry #16:



\> I haven't bothered to preserve the rest of it. I'll leave what remains in the woods; She'll be pleased with me, and I'll smile again.

\> 

\> No broccoli teeth.

\> 

\> Not in my teeth.

\> 

\> Not between my teeth.

\> 

\> No broccoli teeth.





\---

\*\*What is going on? Who is "She"?\*\*





\---

Entry #17:



\> It's early morning. Very dark out. Best time to be out. I wandered over to that dead-still pond and noticed a familiar figure sitting on the bench there. It was Henry, and he was still. I know I wasn't close enough to be heard, but he suddenly turned around and faced me, holding the broccoli in his hands, the sulphur digging into his pale skin. Then he threw all of the pieces into the pond, ending with a wet "plop". I blinked for a moment, and then he was right in front of me; I could smell his smoke-sour tank top, almost taste the alcohol on his breath. He unhinged his jaw, and opened up his mouth.

\>

\> He had no tongue. 

\> 

\> Then, everything went white.

\> 

\> \*Edit: Everything is black, and I don't know where I am.\*

\> 

\> \*Edit: Hope you're all having a good one. Thanks for reading. It means the forest to me.\*





\---

Entry #18:



\> I had another dream. Though this time I guess it was more like walking inside a beautiful painting. I was standing in that very spot I was before, where the water's edge meets the shore, staring down at myself. And I no longer saw myself, I just saw light. Bright, holy light. Lovely light. Great light. Light that completely envelops me. My whole being. My soul. My heart. My stomach. She looked my way. I looked back at Her.

\> 

\> Edit: I

\> Fertilizer. Everywhere.

Entry #20:



\> The forest is bigger now. It stretches beyond the pond, beyond the supermarket. Past the beyond. It stretches farther than anything I've ever seen.

\> 

\> And we're glowing.

\> 

\> Brighter than ever.

\>

That's everything. I'm supposed to go in for a police interview this afternoon. They have updated news about him and want to pick my brain. I'm nervous.



\*Edit: The fluorescent hum in the station is louder than it should be.\*



\*Edit: The room smells sweet. Sweet. Sweet. Almost rotten.\*



Edit: We like the way she sweats
