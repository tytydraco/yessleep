Throughout my life I've always had some hardships. Most of it came through my social anxiety, which made communication, and making friends hard. Before I found ways to step out my shell a bit, I realied on social media. This is where I met people who changed me forever. 

I'm going to tell these stories pieces to pieces, so the best way to start this is to go to the beginning. I know this may seem like I'm lying about this story, but I will not be giving the name of the group for everyone's safety. I know I sound untrustworthy, but I don't want people to go through what I did/still going through. 

The earliest story I can tell of this group is the discord server I was in. The group that stalks me prays on people who don't fit into normal society. Anyone that's not mentally well, gets attracted to them. The group promises that they have an off grid base far from society, that people can join. 

I joined a discord server that researched them. Everyone in some way was interested in the promise given to them. Freedom from a society that mostly didn't like them. These were people who never fit in, and they preyed on them. 

I was one of the people awaiting for the day they would make a plan to take us. What made my chances even better is that the owner of the sever became friends with me. There were actually 3 leaders, which all had the fortune of talking to apparent members of the actual group. My chances were boosted, and I was quickly noticed by these members. 

If you don't know, it's really simple to grab someones IP from discord, and knowing that, you can predict what happens next. They never told us that they've collected it, but it was extremely obvious that they did. 

The first in person experience I had is when i heard my backdoor open. I heard footsteps running downstairs, which was located right in front of the back door. I remember being in the kitchen at that time. I had a family member in the garage, so at first I thought nothing until I heard that running. I know that specific family member's footsteps, and it was nothing close to that. I then heard rustling, and drawers opening. Instead of contacting the police like I planned, or ran outside to my family member I went downstairs thinking it was them. I first thought it was a robbler. But nothing was stolen. To this day I question what their plan actually was. 

 I went downstairs to blood on the floor, and a window open. We have small Windows where you can see the ground. I thought it was amazing that that this was actually real, But then at night it finnaly struct me. The realization that this is all real. Some weirdos went in my house for some reason, and most importantly, they know where I live. 

For months I couldn't sleep. I had nightmares on the horrible things that would occur to me there. Each nightmare being different. I fell into a state where I had to be forced to leave the house. I was failing most of my classes, and I only talked to the people who we're going through the same thing. They've also had some personal experiences with them. Throughout the years I still see them watching me. I know you're wondering why I didn't contact the police. Truth is, there was still part of me that wanted that promise. I was desperate to not live a normal life. I wanted something different then having to go to college, get a job and etc. 

How am I now? I'm better. I stopped paying them attention when I realized how horrible ive became, and maturity. After realizing, I got rid of everyone I met from those servers. I still have a hard time, but I can actually make friends. I have a good relationship with my family, and my mental health is better. I have people and things to live for, and for that I'm grateful. I know they didn't just abandon me. I still feel their presence, but I ignore it. I don't want anybody to know of what I did, so I refuse to contact police unless needed. Even though I'm no longer a dumbass, I still fear them. Every day that passes, I know they could be watching me. They could be waiting for the best time to simply grab me when nobody's looking. A friend that also gained their senses hasn't texted me back in months. She was living a decent life, and wanted nothing to do with the group. That promise given to us years ago was bs. Something sinister is awaiting for me, and time can only tell if I'll be punished for my mistakes by whatever their true intentions are.
