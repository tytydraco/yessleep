For some time now, bodies have been found and subsequently pulled from the waterways of Chicago. The Chicago River and Lake Michigan both, have been the frequent sites of multiple body recovery operations. To a lesser degree, the Des Plaines River, has also seen a share of the death in the greater Chicago area. And it is not just the waterways, the city itself has had a rough go of it for a long time. The city has also had more than a fair share of serial killers over time. From the infamous, H.H. Holmes, to the despicably evil, John Wayne Gacy. Throughout time their have been many a serial killer to roam about the streets of Chicago, Illinois.

&#x200B;

Two months ago, I made my mind up and then packed up what I would need for an extended time away from home. I loaded up the truck and off I went, on my way, along the highways of America, from the far south of Florida, to the northwest, to Chicago. I decided to begin an adventurous, and possibly quite dangerous endeavor, an attempt to assist in the location and capture of one or more of the Chicago area serial killers. There is definitely, at the least, two of them, of that I am sure. And they have had Chicago in their grip of fear for a long time.

&#x200B;

The first of them, dubbed and known to law enforcement as, The Chicago Strangler, is likely responsible for up to fifty unsolved strangulations since the year 2000 or so. And the other, an unnamed shadow, a nobody, that could be anybody, is likely responsible for the deaths of many young men and a few young women in the Chicago area. Most of which were young adults, and more than a few, were known to have visited clubs or bars in the River North nightlife district area of the city.

&#x200B;

And so, that is the area I had chosen to begin my investigation of sorts. I am setting in my vehicle at the moment, and as I write this I can't help but think to myself, that any one of the people walking the sidewalks and walkways around me could be the one. Any one of the people, inside any one of the clubs and bars in the area, could be the one. And again, I am about to enter that world, enter the hunting grounds of one or more serial killers. I know how stupid the idea is, but I can't help how badly I want to be the one that leads the authorities to stopping this monster.

&#x200B;

Early on I stopped in at the local police precinct, I let them know that I was in the area and what I was up to. So that under any circumstance where I may have to come into contact with local law enforcement they are keenly aware of my presence and intentions. And obviously they attempted to warn me away from what I am doing. My whole life I have been curiously infatuated with serial killers, studying the cases, diving headfirst into the world of true human monstrosity. People without conscience, viscous and murderous, victimizing everyone and everything they can in life as they make their way through it. Evil on a primal level exists in the hearts of mankind, and these men and women, these serial killers, let it shine out.

&#x200B;

I intended to observe from the shadows of the clubs and bars, watching and waiting, for any obvious signs of a predator stalking it's prey, in the light of the hope of wrangling in another helpless victim. And maybe with a little luck on my side, I can be the one that puts a stop to the madness of this demented soul. And if not this one than perhaps the other, the Chicago Strangler. More than likely an older man, taking into account the length of time that victims have been, or could've been, attributed to that particular killer. Even if he, or she, had begun their killing near or about the year 2000, and had been say 20-30 years of age at the time. They would now be in their forties or fifties, and of course, could be even older, or perhaps even deceased at this point. Somewhat recently, the California based serial killer and rapist, dubbed The Golden State Killer, was caught through genealogical database search information, and he was deep into his seventies at the time of his capture. This among other reasons, led me to the beginning of my search, here in the River North nightlife district.

&#x200B;

The likelihood of the alleged and purported serial killer, still operating in the River North area, is far more likely than finding the person responsible for the strangulations that have plagued Chicago for so long. That person could be anywhere and hasn't been tied to any particular geological location or area. This one has fortunately, and there is always the chance that because of this, they may have moved on to a different hunting ground. But why change what has been working for you right? This area has been the perfect hunting grounds for this particular killer and I imagine they will continue to exploit that as long as they possibly can.

&#x200B;

I was going to go into the Tunnel tonight, but I decided to switch it up and start in the Underground Cocktail Club. I'll be heading in here in just a minute, after I finish smoking this cigarette. It's a shit habit I know, but I do love it so. I'm sorry but my nerves are fried already and I haven't even made it inside yet. I don't want to go in jumpy or looking like some kind of scared kitten setting in the corner of the bar. The cat lady that slammed up against my driver's side rear window sent me over the edge.

&#x200B;

Head down and absorbed in writing this, I wasn't paying the proper amount of attention to my surroundings. Some lady with a cat in her arms slammed her body up against my car at the rear driver's side of the truck and hollered something undecipherable. It scared the hell out of me I'm not going to lie. As she wandered on down the sidewalk mumbling obscenities I believe, she struck me as crazy. But then who am I to pass judgement or assume her mental capabilities. She definitely was strange though, and she definitely scared the shit out of me.

&#x200B;

I'm going to use my phone to update you all periodically as I go along. Publishing the finished post at the end of the night. Hopefully that way, all of you will be informed as I move along, and if anything should happen to me, there will be a record of my movements for law enforcement to follow. I will post once a night from here on out, twice a day if possible, as much as possible for sure, but I will document as much as I possibly can every time. Anyone that seems suspicious, anything that seems out of the ordinary, if I notice anything worth noting I will write it down and share it immediately.

&#x200B;

Ever since last weekend, I have been a little spooked, I have been trying to take precautions and avoid any chance of me becoming one of the, "disappeared". And I've decided to share my movements with as many people as I possibly can. What better way, than to just share my story as it plays out in real life. That way if anything should happen to me, there will be an extensive public record of what led to my demise. I'm supposed to be meeting up with a couple again tonight. I met them a couple weeks ago and we've hung out here a few times since then. Usually they bring this other girl, the girlfriend' cousin I believe, if I remember correctly that is.

&#x200B;

And just to document my reasons for being, "spooked", as of late. I want to share a few other things really quick. There is a man, early, possibly mid thirties, dark hair and eyes, six feet in height, that has come into the Underground every other night for the past three weeks. Well dressed and obviously has money, always buying rounds for people at the club. He has a habit of sorts of approaching singles at the bar and striking up conversations, buying them drinks until he strikes out at the end of the night. I keep wondering about him in particular, I've even had two nightmares about dark not quite shapes hovering over me in my sleep. And I swear every time I've awoken from that nightmare I have thought of that man at the bar. Why I do not know, but something about him just rubs me the wrong way. The thought that he could be the serial killer stalking the area, and that he's just out here like that trying people at the clubs every night is terrifying, sobering even.

&#x200B;

And the nightmares themselves, of which I've had several different kinds. Have taken an immense toll on my psyche, and put a serious dent in my resolve to see this thing through if I can. If they start to come to me every night, I don't think I will be able to hang any longer. The mental weight of the night time terrors on top of the genuine threat of death in my personal endeavors, is starting to have a real effect on me.

&#x200B;

Not to mention the fact that they just pulled a fresh one out of the waters just last month, a young Polish man I think. Oh well, up up and away, or so they say. It is currently, 9:46pm, I am heading inside now. Fashionably late as per my usual modus operandi. Hereafter, I will mark each subsequent paragraph with the word, "Update", followed by anything noteworthy at the time. And then at the end of the night tonight I will post whatever I have written down as my first entry into this saga. Wish me luck.

&#x200B;

Update: #1. It is now 10:58pm and I am just finishing up my second beverage of the night. A horrid affair, they ordered me a Tequila Sunrise, and it was absolutely gross. Worst drink I've ever had, and according to a quick google search, it's on a couple lists for worst cocktails of all time. I'm gonna order me a scotch on the rocks with a coke on the side to wash it down with. If I can get the girl's attention again that is, it is quite busy in here tonight. No sign of the mystery man as of yet.

&#x200B;

Update: Its 11:44. The man from before is here now. I've probably had one too many too fast, but I'm still gonna keep my eye on him from the back booths of the bar. Hopefully it won't be too painfuly obvious, I dont want to spoook him in any way or tip him off that I am watching.

&#x200B;

Update: It's 12:31pm and I'm definitely not feeling well. I should of paced myself better. I only had four drinks, but I've drank them pretty fast as they came to me. Or five drinks sorry I forgot the shit drink that they bought me. looks like a cab for me tonight. The man from before has been locked in with another man at the front of the bar since shortly after he came in. I've been watching him as diligently as poss.

&#x200B;

Update. Theyve offered me a ride home. thats good but they said i'll have to ride along while they drop off the cousin chick. She has tto be back at a particular time i guess no big deal there. Thats alright. I ain't on a tight schedule myself. Its 2 in the morning now. So we will be leaving soon I guess.

&#x200B;

Update. We are leaving the bar now. Walking to their mini van. They parked just down the street so, be otw home in just a few, Im posting this now since it's the end of the night and I'll start where i left off again tomorrow afternoon. Later all.

&#x200B;

So where to begin, I guess I'll start with the hospital. I woke up in the hospital this afternoon, and I had no idea how I ended up there. It has started to come back to me, and this unposted writing has helped put everything back into perspective and back on a timeline. The last thing I really remember was opening the sliding back door on a mini van before everything went black. If it wasn't for a bystander, and coincidentally the man that helped me, was the same man I was watching like a hawk in the bar that night. Him and his boyfriend I guess you would say, or his guy friend. I don't know about that, what I do know is the two of them were apparently leaving the bar just after we left. And they happened to hear a sound like a yell from just up the road and came quickly to see if something visually coincided with what they had heard.

&#x200B;

They saw what they described as a man laying in the road next to a van, and two people standing over them with the back sliding door to the van open wide. They yelled out and startled the two people standing there over the person, and the male ran around the van and jumped into the driver seat and the female jumped over the man laying in the road and into the back of the van. They saw another person in the front passenger side as the van peeled away from the area. And they said it was a miracle that the van didn't completely run the man over laying in the road and kill them. Though the van did appear to run over the leg of the person laying there. They ran over to check on the person and called 911. They were brought down to the station and questioned before being sent on their way. I got the information from a detective that was here in my room when I woke.

&#x200B;

I woke to the realization that my leg is broken. I have a cast on my leg and a hell of headache. I have a total of 8 staples in the back of my head. I decided to leave everything I wrote from the last night out at the bar and to just ad this to it. For what its worth perhaps this will serve as a stark warning, not to go out looking for evil unless your prepared to deal with it when you find it. And don't be dumb enough to let your guard down and get intoxicated whilst doing so. The detective I spoke with thinks I was drugged before I was offered a ride home. And that if I hadn't been extremely lucky to have someone hear what was going on and end up scaring off the attackers. That I would likely, very possibly, be the next person being fished up out of the Chicago River or Lake Michigan.

&#x200B;

I was apparently hit from behind. And they obviously intended on loading me into the van they were in and driving me to a secondary location. From there who knows what would of come next, or what kind of hell I would have found myself in. The detectives said that a van matching the description I gave was reported stolen earlier in the day, same day that I was later attacked and almost abducted. So whoever these people really are they are working as a team, and they are smart enough to use stolen vehicles to commit their crimes. Two women and a man. I do not know their names, the names they gave to me are obviously going to be fake names. I've been through 3000 mugshots and they aren't in them. So these people are not on the record as most criminals are. They have remained out of the light and live in the dark shadowy drunken world of the North River district.

&#x200B;

I came here in search of a serial killer. I think I may have stumbled onto a group of them. Either that or by some crazy coincidence, in the same area that a serial killer is using to hunt down their victims. Some random group of people groomed me for a couple weeks, got me to let down my guard, and then drugged and attacked me. Then they tried to abduct me and take me off into oblivion never to be heard from again. I barely escaped this situation with my life. And now I know, and they know, that they let me get away. And I guarantee they will be wanting to find me and take care of me, if they are smart enough to do all of this, then they are smart enough to know as long as I am out here, they are in jeopardy. That I can visually identify the three of them.

&#x200B;

Please, listen to me. If you are in the Chicago area, please do not go down to the River North area to party and hang about. Party at home with friends or something like that. This area is more dangerous than you could possibly know. If it weren't for an absolute miracle, I would be dead right now. I couldn't be luckier. And I am begging you to stay out of that area, there is definitely a killer or group of killers operating in the area. And until they are caught you are taking your life and putting it into the hands of the worst kind of human beings when you put yourself in that area.

&#x200B;

Once I have healed I will be going back for sure, I plan to set in my vehicle and watch for the same people who attacked me to show their faces in the area again. So that I can have them put where they belong and put a stop to their madness. Once again, wish me luck.
