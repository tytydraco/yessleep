[Part 1: The Ritual](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hw941v/the_ritual_of_reflection_how_i_got_to_the_other/)

  
I am trapped.

At first, I thought it was just a nightmare. A cruel hallucination. But no matter how many times I pinch myself or scream, I don’t wake up. I am here, in this… void.

 

When the light breaks through the darkness, I see them: the reflections. But there is only light when a reflection is being used.  They stand frozen, lifeless, like puppets waiting for strings to pull them. Their eyes are empty, their faces blank, as though they’re nothing but shells.

I tried speaking to them. “Can you hear me?” I shouted. “Please, say something!” But they didn’t move. Not a twitch. Not even a flicker of recognition.

But nothing is worse than the utter silence. My voice echoes into nothing, swallowed by the mirror’s void. I screamed until my throat was raw. Until I literally couldn’t scream anymore. They didn’t even blink.

When the light fades, I’m left in darkness again. It’s so absolute that I can’t tell if my eyes are open or closed. My own breathing is the only sound, shallow and ragged, breaking the oppressive silence.

But then the light returned, spilling through cracks in the mirror like molten gold. One of the reflections came to life, animated by the movements of someone on the other side. A young girl brushing her hair. I could feel the energy as her "reflection" moved, but the girl didn’t know I was here, watching her hollow twin. The reflections are empty vessels, slaves to the real world’s commands.

And I… I am now one of them.

When my reflection stands in front of the mirror, everything changes. That smile, it doesn’t belong to me. It stretches too far, twisting my face into something grotesque. Its eyes never blink, never waver, as though mocking me.

And then it begins.

I feel my body move without my control, following its lead. Every motion is an agony I can’t describe. My joints creak and snap, twisting into unnatural positions. I smile through the pain, the corners of my mouth splitting, but I can’t stop. I’m its puppet now, and it knows it.

It enjoys this.

I know it’s not me out there. It’s not human. That thing, whatever it is, doesn’t belong in the world of the living. But it wears my face. It looks like me. And everyone is fooled.

It never blinks.

When it’s not in front of the mirror, I can move freely here. The other reflections remain lifeless, but I feel them around me, waiting to be used. I stumble through the darkness, running my hands over smooth, cold surfaces, searching for something—anything—that could be a way out. But the void seems endless.

I have to find a way back. I can’t stay here. I can’t endure this torture, watching that thing live my life while I rot in this hollow prison.

But every time I move closer to the mirror, every time I think I’ve found an escape, it appears.

And it smiles.

It knows.
