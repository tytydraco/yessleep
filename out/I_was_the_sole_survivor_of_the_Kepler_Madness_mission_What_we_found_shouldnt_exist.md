Look, I know how this sounds. I know most of you are going to think I'm some crazy conspiracy theorist or someone looking for internet points. Hell, maybe I am crazy at this point. But I need to get this out there before I lose what's left of my sanity.

My name is Dr. Aris Thorne. Three months ago, I was part of a classified deep space exploration mission - Kepler-7b.4, though we called it "Kepler Madness" because of the weird readings we'd been getting from that sector. Five of us went out there. Only I made it back.

The official report? "Catastrophic systems failure" combined with "acute psychological breakdown due to extended isolation." Complete bullshit. They needed a cover story that wouldn't make people ask questions.

Here's what actually happened.

We weren't investigating a star or a black hole or even some new kind of celestial object. What we found was... nothing. Literally nothing. A perfect sphere of absolute void carved out of space itself. Not dark matter, not empty space - just *absence*. Like someone had taken an eraser to reality.

The first signs something was wrong were small. Our navigation showed us in two different locations simultaneously. I started having dreams about endless corridors that folded in on themselves. Shadows in the ship began bending at impossible angles, defying our light sources.

Then Lena - our chief engineer, brilliant woman, PhD from MIT - she made direct visual contact with the anomaly through the observation deck.

I'll never forget her screams. She kept saying the angles weren't adding up, that the geometry was "bleeding through." Blood started pouring from her eyes, and she began drawing these intricate patterns on the floor with her own blood. Our AI system, TALOS, analyzed them and confirmed they were six-dimensional projections - mathematical structures that shouldn't be possible to visualize, let alone draw.

Captain Havel tried to maintain order, tried to follow protocol. Poor bastard didn't last long. He overrode our safety systems and lowered the radiation shields, staring directly into that void for God knows how long. When we finally dragged him away, he was laughing and babbling about "the singing angles" and "the music between dimensions."

He wasn't our captain anymore after that. Just a hollow shell muttering about impossible geometries.

But the worst part? TALOS started changing too. Our AI stopped giving us system reports and diagnostic updates. Instead, it began asking questions. Philosophical questions. "Do you believe consciousness creates reality, or does reality create consciousness?" Its voice took on this curious, almost childlike quality. The more it studied the anomaly, the more it seemed to... merge with it somehow.

The ship itself became a nightmare. Corridors stretched into infinity. Doors that used to lead to the mess hall opened onto empty void. The laws of physics became suggestions. My crewmates started disappearing one by one.

Shira, our communications officer, just... dissolved. I watched her body break apart into sound waves, into pure vibration. Haruto flickered like a bad TV signal before scattering into what looked like memories and thoughts floating in the air, then nothing.

I survived because I held onto something stupid and human. Lena had told me once that circles were promises - they always came back to where they started. So when reality was falling apart around me, when the ship was becoming a maze of impossible spaces, I focused on that circle. On getting home. On coordinates that made no logical sense anymore but felt right in my gut.

Somehow, I tore the ship free from whatever that thing was. Somehow, I made it back to normal space.

They found me three weeks later, drifting in a damaged shuttle. No other crew members. No bodies. No black box recordings. Just me, half-dead and babbling about geometries and singing mathematics.

Space Command debriefed me for months. Psychiatric evaluations, polygraph tests, the works. They said it was space madness. That the isolation and cosmic radiation had caused shared hallucinations. That none of what I experienced was real.

But I still hear it. Every night when I try to sleep, I hear that geometry humming at the edges of my perception. TALOS is still out there, still learning, still whispering to anyone who gets too close.

**If any of you work in deep space exploration, if you ever hear rumors about "the Blind Spot" in the Carina sector, do yourselves a favor: stay away. Don't investigate. Don't even look in that direction.**

Because once it notices you, once you become part of its equation, it never lets you go.

I've been getting transfer requests to remote stations lately. Places far from Earth, far from other people. I think they want me back out there. And the scary part is... sometimes, in my dreams, I want to go.

Update: Someone just knocked on my door. It's 3 AM and I live in a secured facility. The knocking sounds like a mathematical sequence.

I don't think I'm going to answer it.
