This story happened thirteen years ago. On that night, no one understood what had transpired in that house. But let’s start from the beginning.

On a damp, dark night in November, my friends—Jack, John, Steel—and I were in the old, abandoned house we had rented for the weekend. It was three in the morning, and we were gathered around the fireplace, talking and laughing about various topics. The house was an eerie place, with creaky wooden floors and dusty furniture, but we were excited about spending a weekend away from the city.

Suddenly, the phone in the old kitchen rang, causing us to jump. I was the first to get up and answer it.

"Hello?" I said hesitantly.

On the other end of the line, a hoarse voice whispered, "I'm close... I see you... I'll call back in three minutes."

I hung up the phone and looked at the others, my eyes filled with fear. "It must be some kind of prank," I said, trying to convince myself. The others laughed nervously, but I could see the worry in their eyes.

Three minutes passed, and the phone rang again. This time, Jack answered. "Who is this?" he asked, his voice trembling.

"I'm getting closer..." said the same hoarse voice. "Don't try to leave."

We were now seriously worried. John suggested calling the police, but the phone rang again before we could. Steel answered it this time.

"What do you want from us?" he asked in panic.

"I'm already here..." said the voice, and the phone went dead.

The minutes dragged on agonizingly slowly. Every shadow seemed suspicious, every sound echoed like a threat. We huddled together, trying to come up with a plan. The house seemed to close in on us, its silence broken only by the creaks and groans of the old wood.

Suddenly, a loud crash came from the basement. Jack and I decided to go check it out, leaving John and Steel in the living room.

As we descended the stairs, the light flickered and went out. The only source of light was our cell phones. In the basement, there was nothing but an eerie silence. As we investigated, we found old, dusty furniture and cobwebs. But then, a sudden noise made us freeze. It was the creaking of a door. We turned around and saw a shadow move across the room.

"Who's there?" I called out, but there was no response.

Nervously, we returned upstairs, only to find John and Steel were nowhere to be found.

"Where did they go?" asked Jack.

The answer came from the phone, which rang again. I answered, my heart pounding.

"Your friends are no longer here... You're next..." said the voice.

Jack and I ran towards the exit, but the doors were locked. Suddenly, Jack felt a hand pull him back, and he screamed. I turned to see Jack disappearing into the darkness.

Running, I climbed the stairs and locked myself in a room. Hearing footsteps approaching, I tried to think of a way out. The phone rang again, this time in the room where I was hiding.

"You're the last one... You can't escape..." said the voice.

I felt panic overwhelming me. Something outside the door moved, and before I could react, the door was violently opened. A hand grabbed me, and everything went dark.

As I regained consciousness, I found myself tied to a chair in the basement. The room was dimly lit by a single, flickering bulb. I could hear muffled voices and footsteps above me. Struggling to free myself, I noticed old tools and rusty chains scattered around. My mind raced with fear and confusion.

Hours seemed to pass when I heard footsteps descending the stairs. The hoarse voice spoke again, but this time it was in the room with me. "You shouldn't have come here," it whispered menacingly. A figure emerged from the shadows, its face obscured by a hood.

"Who are you? What do you want?" I demanded, my voice shaky.

The figure remained silent, moving closer. My heart pounded as the figure raised a hand and pulled back the hood, revealing a face I did not recognize. It was a man, his eyes cold and calculating.

"You and your friends trespassed on sacred ground," the man said, his voice low and threatening. "This place holds secrets that should never be disturbed."

My mind raced. I remembered hearing local legends about the house, stories of disappearances and mysterious events. I never believed them, thinking they were just myths to scare people away.

"We didn't mean any harm," I pleaded. "We were just looking for a place to stay for the weekend."

"Intentions don't matter," the man replied. "You awakened something that should have been left undisturbed."

As the man moved closer, I felt a chill run down my spine. The man's eyes seemed to pierce through me, filled with a malevolent intent. Desperation fueled my struggle to free myself, but the ropes were too tight.

Suddenly, the man stopped and listened. From above, there was a commotion, sounds of struggle and muffled cries. The man turned and hurried up the stairs, leaving me alone in the dark, damp basement.

Seizing the moment, I frantically worked at the ropes, finally managing to loosen them enough to free one hand. With determination, I freed myself completely and quietly made my way to the basement door. I peered out, seeing the man distracted by something in the living room.

Gathering my courage, I crept through the house, looking for an escape route. I found a small window in the kitchen, just large enough to squeeze through. With great effort, I pushed it open and crawled out, feeling the cold night air against my skin.

Running through the woods, I could hear the man's voice shouting behind me. Fear and adrenaline drove me forward, my mind focused on one thing: survival. I didn't stop until I reached the nearest town, where I collapsed at the doorstep of a small diner.

The next morning, the police found the old house deserted, with no trace of my three friends. In a state of shock, I could only whisper, "It was the voice... it saw us... it took us one by one..."

The investigation that followed uncovered disturbing details about the house and its history. It had been the site of numerous disappearances over the years, all linked to the same mysterious caller. But no one could explain who the man was or why he targeted the house's occupants.

I never fully recovered from that night. The memories haunted me, and the fear never left. I moved far away, trying to start anew, but the shadow of that night always lingered.

And somewhere, in the dark corners of an abandoned house, a phone rang, waiting for its next victim.

As years passed, I tried to rebuild my life. I moved to a different city, changed my job, and even changed my name, hoping to escape the haunting memories. But the events of that night never truly left me. I avoided old houses and secluded places, fearing that the voice might one day find me again.

One night, while working late at the office, my phone rang. It was an unknown number. My heart raced as I answered, "Hello?"

There was no response, just silence. My mind flashed back to that night, and I felt a chill run down my spine. I quickly hung up, trying to calm myself, but the memories were too strong.

Determined to find closure, I began researching the house and its history more deeply. I discovered old newspaper articles and police reports about similar incidents, stretching back over a century. Each story had the same eerie pattern: a group of friends, a phone call, and mysterious disappearances.

I decided to visit the house once more, hoping to find answers. Armed with the knowledge of its past, I prepared myself for whatever I might encounter. As I approached the house, it looked even more dilapidated and foreboding than I remembered.

Inside, the air was thick with dust and decay. I made my way to the basement, where it all began. As I stood in the same spot where I had been tied up, memories flooded back. I could almost hear the hoarse voice whispering in my ear.

Suddenly, the phone rang. It was the same old rotary phone, now covered in cobwebs. With a trembling hand, I picked up the receiver.

"I knew you'd come back," the voice said, sending shivers down my spine.

"Who are you?" I demanded. "Why are you doing this?"

The voice chuckled softly. "Some secrets are better left buried. But since you're so curious, I'll give you a hint. Look in the attic."

Gathering my courage, I made my way to the attic. The stairs creaked under my weight, and the air grew colder as I ascended. The attic was filled with old trunks, broken furniture, and forgotten relics. In the corner, I found a dusty old journal.

Opening the journal, I discovered it belonged to a man named Edward Blackwood, who had lived in the house over a hundred years ago. His entries detailed strange occurrences, much like what I had experienced. He wrote about hearing voices, receiving mysterious phone calls, and the gradual disappearance of his family and friends.

As I read through the journal, I realized Edward had been trying to communicate with the entity that haunted the house. He believed it was a spirit seeking vengeance for some ancient wrong. His last entry was particularly chilling: "Tonight, I will confront it. If anyone finds this journal, know that I did not die in vain. The truth must be known."

Then,i learn my end.
