My name is Kayla and I have an imaginary friend. And I need help. I have to get rid of him coz it makes Mummy and Daddy angry. They say ‘Kayla now you are 7 you are too old for imaginary friends’. But I don’t know how coz no matter what I do Brady doesn’t go away.

Mummy took me to a doctor to get rid of Brady. The doctor told me to leave Brady at home when I go to school. That way I can make even more friends other than just Brady. I tried to say that Brady only stays at home in the basement anyways but he didn’t listen. Mummy and Daddy don’t listen either, ‘He’s just in your head sweetie’.

The kids at school don’t know about Brady. In art class we had to paint a picture of our best friend so I painted Brady. I painted him outside in the snow even though he’s never been outside. I made him hold his blue blanket that I gave him. Miss Andy asked me to tell her about Brady. I said Brady is 7 like me and he has blue eyes. She asked me how I met Brady and I said he moved into our basement a few years ago.

That’s when Mummy and Daddy first found out about Brady too. Miss Andy phoned them and had a chat. She must have told them about Brady. Mummy explained that Brady isn’t real and then booked me my first doctor appointment. Now I have one every week.

My doctor also said it’s important for me to know deep down that Brady is only pretend. I guess he must be even though he looks so real. But he only really lives in my head not the basement. Mummy and Daddy can’t see Brady. It’s only me that can see him. 

I’m trying to chat to Brady less but sometimes I get lonely. I wish I had a little brother who could play with me. I snuck down to the basement to say hi to Brady after school even though that’s naughty. He asked me ‘Kayla how was your day’ so I told him about playing on the swings with Nessa.  He seemed a little sad but he said ‘I’m glad you made a new friend’. Then I left coz Daddy had made me a snack.

Mummy and Daddy won’t let me have friends over. I think it’s becoz of Brady. They said people might think I’m weird if I tell them about Brady. Once I stop talking to Brady I can have Nessa over to play. 

At school we had to make family trees. Nessa told me a sad story about her twin brother. She said he went missing a while ago and now she is lonely. I said ‘Nessa I get lonely too’ and gave her a hug. Then we made snow angles together at lunchtime.

I told my doctor a lie today. I said I haven’t talked to Brady all week. I want to stop pretending to see Brady but it’s hard. When I’m lonely I just want someone to play with and Brady is always there for me. He gets lonely too. My doctor was proud of me and that made me smile. Mummy and Daddy cooked me yummy spaghetti for dinner as a reward. 

Brady doesn’t know that he’s not real. I don’t want to make him sad by telling him. I wouldn’t like it if someone said ‘Kayla you are imaginary’. I think I really will stop going to see Brady soon. Now I have more friends I don’t need him to make me happy.

Today I went to see Brady for the last time. But he wasn’t there! His blanket was still there and it felt cold to touch. But no Brady!The doctor said that one day Brady might just go poof. I can’t believe it happened! I told Mummy and Daddy that Brady had gone and they didn’t seem surprised. I guess the doctor warned them about the poofing too.

When I left for school in the morning there were 2 pairs of footprints in the snow. They came from the little door to the basement that you can enter from outside. Some matched my feet size! I pointed them out to Mummy but she couldn’t see them. She said ‘Kayla when Brady left I thought all this silliness would stop. I’m disappointed’. That made me sad so I stopped looking at them.

I walked back home with Nessa. She is finally coming over for a playdate! We went through the woods to get sticks for a snowman even though Daddy says ‘Kayla never go into the woods without me or Mummy’. 

But then something bad happened. I saw Brady again. But it was different becoz he was sleeping. I looked at Nessa and I was going to pretend I didn’t see anything. But then Nessa started screaming. I said ‘Omg Nessa you can see him too?’ And she just kept screaming. ‘That’s my brother Kayla!’ She says to me. And then I started screaming too. 

My name is Kayla and I have 2 imaginary friends. Their names are Nessa and Brady and they sleep in my basement. I live in the basement too. Mummy says I will live in the basement with my sleeping friends until I realise they are not real. ‘Stop being silly Kayla, you are a naughty girl’. 

I think I am going crazy. 

Maybe I am not real too.
