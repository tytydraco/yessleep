I’m posting this here because I don’t know how much time I have left, just that I don’t have a lot of it. I’m sick. It’s bad.

Whatever this is affecting my body—it’s going to kill me soon. So, I need to get this warning out. A warning for you or anyone else looking for a quick, convenient fix for being healthy. A warning to not buy the same pills I did.

I’ve always done my best to be a healthy person; good eating habits, exercising, good sleeping habits. You name it. When I was still in high school, it was easier than ever to keep those habits up. Especially with a part time job.

But as an adult? The job I work is physical, so exercise isn’t an issue. But I can never find the time to cook healthy meals, so I either end up microwaving some shitty T.V dinner or I sometimes just don’t eat at all. Sleeping is fine too; it’s just my nutrition that’s shit.

Hunger isn’t an issue to me, but I still know what my body needs. Something quick—something that will give me the nutrients I need while not sacrificing time. Something I can just pop in my mouth and go on with my day afterwards.

That’s how I ended up stumbling upon the website for a multivitamin simply named *All-Pill*.

A fitting name, I thought. *All* the nutrients you need in one *pill*. I’d done my research, too; went onto several forums and boards to find out what the best ones were. I hadn’t quite figured out what I wanted, and that was when the advertisement for the *All-Pill* came up in my feed.

It looked innocent enough; a simple white bottle with a red logo bordered in gold. Each bottle had enough pills to last 30 days. According to the serving size, one serving was two pills. I’m going to spare the details on the ingredients and amounts of each vitamin in the pills because it was all basic, common stuff.

There were some reviews left on the page. Some of them were a little weird.

“*Started feeling really sick about halfway through the 30-day cycle of the pills. Vomiting and headaches.”*

And a few more like that. Surprisingly, there weren’t any follow-ups to the reviews, just the reviews themselves. I didn’t really pay it any mind. Those people were most likely not used to the amount of nutrients going into their body all at once. I definitely was. I could handle it. 

“Fuck it.” I said. I clicked on checkout and bought a bottle of the pills. It was expensive—$30 for one bottle. I was happy to see that they’d be coming the day after I ordered them. “Sometime tomorrow. Probably get them after I get out of work.”

Work wasn’t much to write home about. Some lifting of boxes here and some stocking of shelves there. It was about halfway through my shift when I felt a buzz in my pocket. “Wonder what that is.” I thought, reaching into my pocket and pulling out my phone.

“Oh!” I exclaimed. It was the notification letting me know that the pills had been delivered.

“*(My Name), your delivery had been left on the front porch. Enjoy, stay healthy!*”

I spent the remainder of my shift restless. I was excited to finally try out my pills and see if they would work at all. If they didn’t, it wasn’t really a huge deal. I would be about of $30 since they had a strict, no-return policy, but it was only $30. I’d live.

When I got out of work, it was 5. Traffic managed to delay my getting home by a good hour and a half, so it was almost 7 when I made it back home. I was too tired and it was too late to cook. I picked up the small box from the porch and rushed inside.

Putting my work bag on the counter, I grabbed a utility knife from my kitchen drawer and opened up the box. Underneath a layer of styrofoam and bubble wrap, was my bottle of pills. It was just as advertised on the website. Good, I hadn’t been scammed, at least. Near the bottom of the bottle, it said “take two pills everyday with water.” Yeah, because I was going to swallow them dry.

I got myself a glass and filled it up with some water. I opened up the bottle and popped two of the strangely green colored pills in my mouth. “Must just be some plant ingredients.” I told myself. “Perfectly rational.”

So, I guess that was day one for the cycle. Nothing really happened and I wasn’t upset about that. Something such as this would likely take some time to kick in. But time was something I had plenty of, so I wasn’t worried in the slightest.

My stomach did hurt a little bit throughout the night, but I suspected that was due to the fact that I hadn’t eaten anything for dinner. I’d get something big for breakfast the next day. That’d fix the stomach pains. It wasn’t so bad to the point where I couldn’t sleep, though. So that’s what I did.

The second day came. I had that big breakfast I was talking about. It was good. Afterwards, I had to get ready to go to work, which wasn’t so good. But money is money so I have to go in. After brushing my teeth and doing all the bathroom stuff that I normally do, I opened up my medicine cabinet.

“*Two pills, 30 days.*”

I shook two pills out of the bottle and downed them with a swig of bathroom sink water. Then, it was off to work for me.

About two-thirds of the way through my shift, I developed a slight headache. It wasn’t anything too serious, just a slight, dull pain in my forehead area. It didn’t impede on my ability to work, so I didn’t dwell on it too much. It was towards the end of my shift that something really weird happened. As soon as I left the building, a sudden wave of dizziness came over me and I had to lean on one of the support beams just past our entrance so I wouldn’t fall down.

“Shit.” I said. “I’ve got to start eating more.” I thought.

I managed to make it over to my car. Nothing else happened on the drive home, but it made me wonder why I had experienced a headache and the dizziness. It had to be that I wasn’t eating enough. I mean, I was not eating enough.

I had a few glasses of water when I got home. I hadn’t drunk much throughout the day and was feeling very dehydrated. After that, without brushing my teeth, I just went to bed.

The next few days weren’t great. Despite the fact that I’d been taking two multivitamins a day, I’d somehow come down with some sickness. It was mostly still just headaches and dizziness on the third day.

I’d elected to keep the pills and a bottle of water on my bedside in case I couldn’t get out of bed.

Around four days in, I was starting to worry a little bit. By the end of the third day, I felt ill. I let my boss know I wouldn’t be able to come in for a few days. He—of course—was understanding about it.

So, day four got off to a bad start. I woke up with a red-hot pain in my stomach. My throat felt scratchy and I needed to throw up. I dragged myself out of bed and made for the bathroom. The feeling of pain didn’t go away when I threw up, but it subsided a little bit, which was good enough for me. I trudged back to bed and fell into a deep sleep. If I can best remember, I think it was around 8 in the morning that I threw up.

When I woke up post puke session, it was four in the afternoon. How had I slept for that long without noticing? I must have been really tired if nothing woke me up. I put the back of my hand to my head. It was hot. I was running a fever.

I tried to get up but found that I didn’t have the energy to. I struggled, but I was staying in bed. With nothing else to do, I used what little strength I had to grab the T.V remote and turn it on. At least now, I’d have some entertainment.

I soon fell into another bout of sleep after that. When I woke up, I’d found that a whole 36 hours had passed. It was four in the morning, and it was the sixth day. I mustered the strength to swallow two more pills and take a sip of water. I was now 12 pills down.

I was dizzy, extremely tired, and the headache that had been nothing more than a dull pain in my head just a few days before was now a raging bull in my head. And I was sweating like crazy, too.

Must’ve been a bad fever to keep me out of commission this long. I wasn’t able to let anyone know I wouldn’t be coming into work, but they’d probably realize it when I didn’t pick up the phone.

At around noon, I felt a coughing fit coming on. I tried to suppress it for as long as possible, but I was too weak to keep it down. In a violent, body-shuddering series of bodily expulsions, I coughed. I coughed hard. But it wasn’t saliva or bile that came out of my mouth. It was blood. I was coughing up blood. And lots of it.

“Shit.” I thought. “Need to call a doctor.” But I couldn’t. I could barely speak. The pain I felt when swallowing now was nearly enough to bring me to tears. I suspected that my throat was bleeding too, but I wasn’t sure of it.

I had also begun to suspect at this point that maybe it was a fever. Maybe—maybe it was something else. Could it have been something in those pills?

I wasn’t able to think much after that, because I passed out from the pain of coughing. The sleep was nice; it didn’t hurt so much when I slept. I wasn’t dreaming, but a brief escape from the hell that was happening inside my own body was more than enough.

And then I woke up.

That was yesterday. I think today might be my last. I can’t feel my legs, and I’m slowly starting to lose the feeling in my fingers and hands. It hurts to breathe. The inner linings of my mouth have peeled and started to bleed. I don’t think that what I’m experiencing is a cold. And I don’t think the reason for the pills being green is natural.

I can barely move, but I have to do something. I have to prevent anyone else from suffering the same fate I’m going to. It’s getting harder to type this. Between the blood on my phone screen and the fact that I almost can’t feel it anymore, I don’t think I’ll be able to do much of it soon.

Please, if you find a website selling a product named *All-Pill*, don’t buy it. For your sake.

I think I know why the website has a no-return policy now. Not that it matters; all of the customers wouldn’t be able to return their pills anyways.

I know I certainly won’t be able to return mine.
