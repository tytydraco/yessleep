This was many years ago, my father died very early, and I lived with my mother. When I was eight years old, my mother and I were invited by her relatives to visit her hometown in the countryside. My mother was very reluctant, but I don't know what her relatives told her, she agreed to go back.

The village is located in the mountains, my mother and I took a taxi to go, but the taxi stopped at the foot of the mountain, my mother did not know what to say to the driver, the driver wondered: "That village has never heard of, maybe I am new to it." My mother and I had to go deeper into the mountains. The village, in the mountains, had existed since the Song Dynasty and was largely isolated, and my mother had escaped from it, not knowing why. My mother and I walked for a long time to find the mountains surrounded by fog, my head a little dizzy, my mother picked me up and said a lot of words I did not understand, whenever I dizzy mother always use this way to solve. Every summer, my head always gets dizzy. Your mind will recall some memories that are not your own.

My mother carried me up and down the misty mountain, and she couldn't seem to find her way home. At this time, an old man appeared in the fog of the mountains. He wore a bamboo hat and shabby clothes. He was thin as if his skin was glued to the skeleton. He greeted us with a smile. My mother kept silent. She was full of sweat. The old man saw that we did not respond, so he left. After the old man left, my mother suddenly changed her mind and wanted to leave this misty mountain forest. But she did not go out for a long time. Until we came to a village.

The village is smog-free, but it looks eerie to be standing in the smog. My mother was very frightened, she kept running but could not run out of the haze area. My head began to suffer again, and this time there appeared in my mind a green-faced monster, or rather a green-faced face. The face is constantly changing and always turns into a black sphere. At this time, there appeared in front of the team wearing red and carrying sedan chairs, as if the ancient kind of wedding team. My mother took me to hide among the trees next to her. The team seemed to have no breath of life, emitting bursts of putridical odor, passing by our side, the sedan chair came from bursts of yelling. My mother, fighting back tears and fear, clamped her hands over my mouth. My body trembled uncontrollably, like an angry beast trying to break out of its cage. My mother didn't let go until the wedding procession was long gone. But my mother stood up and found that the mountain road had been covered with people, to be precise, humanoid creatures, all of them pale, and their skin was very loose as if it were human skin hanging on the top. They looked at my mother as if they were telepathic. I finally saw their faces, like the old man's, smiling strangely, thin as if skin had stuck to a skeleton.

My mother carried me to the path, which was basically a pile of graves. The mother cried again while complaining that she had fled the sacrifice, but her child was innocent, and said why the "female ghost" why revenge still want to kill so many people. Along the way we saw a lot of scary monsters, countless black cats in the trees, mice as big as cows coming out of the graves, and huge, rotten, scary humanoid monsters. Only, we ran to the village, and the wedding party was waiting for us. There was a fearful laugh from inside the sedan chair, and then a pair of pale hands lifted the curtain. A woman with disheveled hair. No! It should be a monster with disheveled hair and a red dress, her face as white as death, her nails as red as blood.

My mother looked at this scene in despair, as if she knew that there would be such a day, she put me down and shouted for me to run, but the woman came to my mother's side in an instant, her strength was outrageous, directly pulled my mother's hair, and then forcibly tore her hair and face down. Mother fell to the ground, she looked at me desperately, and said to me: "Run." The woman laughed and said, "I want everyone in the world to feel my resentment." I was too scared to walk, the woman walked in front of me, the mother with the last strength to pull her, the woman directly with the hand to my mother's head pulled off. My once kind mother died in this way, and my mind kept recalling the fragments of the past. "Because that official made a mistake and let those 108 demons out." "Our children are dark stars." "Why should that woman kill herself out of love and let others die with her?" "The green-faced beast cannot be our child, and even if he were, we cannot kill him." My sadness, anger and resentment filled my brain. This woman came to me with laughter. I hated her for killing my mother. My mother was innocent. I burst into tears, but my cry gradually turned into a roar, and the sky that had been covered by haze suddenly appeared a black sphere, much like the sun. I hear countless ghosts howling in pain. The woman screamed in horror and tried to kill me with all her hatred. I hated her and I wanted to destroy her. Her body was torn apart by me, and though I did not know what I had become, I felt that her soul had been destroyed by me. The countless ghosts of the mountain were all annihilated, and the hateful light from the black sphere lit up the sky.

This is my memory, and then I read a novel, which recorded the story of 108 devils that destroyed the Song Dynasty, and the green-faced Beast was one of them. I also learned the story of a woman in the mountain village who committed suicide because of love. But it doesn't matter. I'll find 107 other Cousins.
