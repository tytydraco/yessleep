The summer after my grade eleven year, I branched out to having more freedom and independence.

By getting a bus pass.

Many of my friends could already drive at that point. Some even had their own cars. I have always been classically late to reaching milestones. I was late to walk and talk. Late to tie my shoes. Late to learn how to do a ponytail by myself. Late to drive. Late to get a bus pass. 

On a summer day when I had nothing to do, I took a spontaneous bus trip to the mall. I wanted to eat some food court food and shop for nail polish. Mostly, honestly, I just wanted to get out of the house. My mom was at work but my dad had been home all day. We were both annoyed with each other. Not for any particular reason, might I add. Just that he was the dad and I was the teenage daughter. I’m sure he was as glad as I was that I was getting out of the house for a couple of hours.

It was late afternoon when I caught my bus. I arrived at the mall about half an hour or so before the crazy supper time food frenzy in the food court. Strategic planning on my part. 

The summer afternoon weather was going downhill but only slightly at first. A slight breeze in the air was enough for me to cover my bare arms with a thin sweater. I looked up into the sky searching for storm clouds. I thought perhaps it would rain later. Completely unbothered by the lame weather spectacle, I entered the mall, tied my sweater around my waist, and promptly forgot about anything to do with the weather. Time to browse nail polish. Time to order far too much junk at the food court.

The details of the mall trip don’t matter so I’ll skip over this part. However, if anyone is curious, I got orange, sparkly silver, deep purple, and shiny lime green polishes. 

My phone buzzed in my pocket. 

*Home soon?* said a text from dad.

*Yeah in a bit* I replied

*Hurry, weather looking bad*

Oh right, the weather. I suddenly remembered the light breeze that chilled me ever so slightly while I waited at the bus stop. 

I exited the mall through the same doors I used to enter. My head was tilted upwards to check the status of the clouds. Far above me in a grey sky, clouds swirled quickly and I even watched as a Thor-like strike of lightning burst through one, briefly illuminating it. Rain fell in big, heavy drops. Still under the awning of the mall’s entrance, I wasn’t getting wet. I saw people in the parking lot soaked through their clothes as they raced to get to shelter, often with hoods pulled over their heads or hands covering their eyes like a mock umbrella. People ran to their cars. People ran to the mall doors. No one wanted to be caught outside. People were soaked within seconds!

My dad sure was right about the weather. I had to get going. Otherwise, I’d fall victim to the storm. I did a pitiful run to the bus stop, only across the road from the mall, and got soaked like I had just been swimming. The bus stop had a sheltered bench but when I sat on it, some rain still dripped onto my head from a thin crack in the plastic roof. It was better than nothing. 

My phone buzzed again.

*Home soon?! Tornado watch in area!!!*

Whatever kind of dad-like annoyance he had with me earlier in the afternoon had now subsided. Protective dad mode. I texted back.

*Waiting for bus*

To prevent my phone from getting wet, I stored it safely in my purse. Leather is waterproof. Mostly.

When the bus came, it pulled over and caused a tidal wave of curbside rainwater to fill my shoes and socks. As I walked onto the bus, my feet made a noise like *squelch squelch squelch squelch.*

My phone buzzed again. My mom this time. She would have just got home from work.

*Weather is nasty! Hope you’re on the bus!*

I didn’t text back right away. A couple minutes later, another text from my mom came through.

*Hello hello?????*

Mothers feed off of responses from their kids as if it's their only sustenance.

*On the bus, really soaked*

*Oh OK. Glad to hear you’re on a bus*

The bus ride to get to the stop nearest to my home would be about 25 minutes in length. Enough time to sit back and listen to a few tunes from your favourite Simple Plan album. Or enough time to get consistently and constantly harassed via text message by your parents. They were texting every minute regardless of if they got a response from me.

*CLOSE TO HOME YET? WE ARE IN BASEMENT!!!!*

Their desperation was starting to get to me. I sat on the bus incredibly anxious and just wanted to get home. My chest felt tight, I rocked myself back and forth to evade a panic attack. This is the price I pay for finally gaining some freedom and independence. For once, I go out on my own, and a tornado conjures itself out of the innocent summer air.

The texts were coming in hot and heavy. My parents wanted an update that the bus hadn’t been sucked into the tornado, and they wanted this update as soon as I could send it. Type message. Press send. Type message. Press send. Type message. Press send. Over and over and over and over and over again. 

Rain pounded at the bus windows. The wind was loud like a roaring engine. When the bus pulled over for my stop, the wind actually made it difficult to even exit the bus. As soon as the bus doors opened, the wind blasted me in the face and I thought for a brief moment that it had ripped all of my hair out with how aggressively it pulled the strands back and away from my face.

I held up my thin sweater like a makeshift umbrella and bolted home as fast as I could. I couldn’t see a damn thing and trusted that my feet would take me in the right direction. I finally looked up again when I knew I was nearing my house. My mom was waiting, front door open. She motioned for me to hurry inside. My legs and chest were burning from the sprint.

Once I was safely in the house, my mom and I breathed a collective sigh of relief. 

“Dad’s in the basement,” she said.

It’s true, dad was in the basement, but he wasn’t taking cover. With mouth open in exasperation, dad stared out of one of the basement windows. 

“Garth?” my mom called to him.

“That’s not normal,” he said.

“What?” I asked.

Dad shook his head. “There’s no way, there’s no way, there’s no way..” he said.

Suddenly he bolted up the stairs. Mom called after him. “Garth!” she shouted. She followed after him in a haste. So did I. We bolted up the stairs and watched my dad throw the back door open and nearly collapse onto the deck. He picked himself up and stared at the sky, mouth open and hand in a saluting position to keep the rain out of his eyes.

Mom went out after him. I stayed inside the house but with the door open I still had a clear view of the sky. I was expecting to see a terrifying dark funnel cloud looming over the house threateningly, but that’s not what was in the sky.

You know when clouds look vaguely like the shape of a dog, or maybe a heart, or even like a letter or number? That’s not what this was. Up in the sky, far above us, a pronounced face with fluffy eyebrows turned down towards a bulbous nose stared down. The face was so clear. It had its lipped pursed like it was blowing something, and it certainly was. There was a tube shape in front of the face and as it blew, wispy clouds shot out of the tube and would suddenly disappear into thin air after swirling around a couple times. 

I’m not even an American, but the best way to describe this face in the clouds so that you can see it clearly in your head is by comparing it to the rocky faces of Mount Rushmore. There, the faces are clearly made out of rock but they are pronounced enough that you can’t see anything but a face. The eyes, ears, and nose are so clear that try as you might, you can’t make your brain view it as any ordinary chunk of rock. It’s rock, yes, but it’s also a face. A clear, distinct face.

That’s what we saw up in the sky. There was nothing vague about it. There was nothing open to interpretation. It was a clear, distinct face. It’s expression was full of hate and anger and we could physically see the face change every time it blew into the tube.

As we stared in shock and horror, the pupils in this cloud face’s eyeballs turned down slowly until we were meeting its gaze. My mom, dad, and I, simply looked, frozen in our spots.

Suddenly, the face smiled. It *smiled.* It was a wicked, evil smile and when the lips were pulled back, we could see a clear row of teeth. One of the teeth was loose and wiggling, like it was going to fall out. Then, the face took a deep breath in, and what followed was the largest, loudest explosion of thunder I have ever experienced. It knocked me right off my feet. With a flash of lightning that blinded us so intensely that we had to look away, the three of us scrambled into the house. The wind blew the door closed. 

“Down! Get down! To the basement! Now!” my dad instructed.

Once downstairs, I took one last look out of a window before resorting to the safety of the laundry room. Up in the sky, the face was completely gone. But, in its place, I saw a funnel cloud. However, this funnel cloud was very unusual. The funnel went upwards instead of down. The open end of it sucked in nearby clouds and its awful spiraling tail grew longer and reached higher and higher into the sky. It was, quite literally, like an upside down tornado. 

I followed my parents into the safety of the laundry room. With a blast of thunder, the door slammed shut, and all the lights went out.
