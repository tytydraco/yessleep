I'm a crime scene cleaner. Have been for eight years now. Started right out of high school when my uncle needed someone he could trust to handle the nasty jobs that most folks won't touch. The pay's decent, the hours are flexible, and there's always work. You wouldn't think people die all that often in unusual circumstances, but you'd be wrong.

I'm not going to lie to you, it's not easy work. Physically demanding, emotionally draining, and the smell. Jesus, the smell. But the worst part isn't what you'd think. It's not the gore or the decay or even the families. The worst part is the isolation. Most people don't want to hear about your day.

So I keep it to myself. Do my job, collect my paycheck, go home. I have my methods, my procedures, my ways of compartmenalizing. I follow the protocols exactly as written. Always wear full PPE. Always document everything. Always decontaminate thoroughly. Always, always wash my hands.

Until three weeks ago, I'd never broken protocol. Not once.

It started with a suicide call. Marcus Williams, 34, single gunshot wound. Found by his landlord after two months of unpaid rent. Standard procedure: secure the scene, assess the damage, begin cleanup.

The apartment was a mess. Beer bottles, pizza boxes, the usual signs of someone who'd given up. I set up my equipment and got to work. Enzyme cleaner for the blood, industrial disinfectant for surfaces. Going to be a full day job, maybe two.

As I was working the bedroom, I found something behind the radiator. A piece of paper, handwritten in neat block letters:

**THEY KNOW WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING**

I stared at it for a long moment. Depression manifests in strange ways. Suicide notes are rarely straightforward. I took a picture for my records, I document everything, and continued working.

That night, I couldn't stop thinking about it. But I told myself it was just stress. Sometimes the psychological weight gets to you.

The next call came two days later. Different part of town. James Chen, 31, single gunshot wound. Found by a neighbor when the smell started.

His apartment was cleaner, more organized. Sparse furniture, minimal possessions. The blood pattern was similar to the Williams scene. As I set up, I checked behind the radiator.

Another note. Same handwriting:

**THEY COME CLOSER WHEN YOU SLEEP**

My hands started shaking. I photographed it and kept working, but this time I was more careful. I checked every radiator, every hiding spot in that apartment.

I found three more:

**THEY FEED ON MEMORIES**

**YOU'RE CARRYING THEM**

**THEY FOLLOW THE SMELL**

I called my supervisor and took a sick day. He understood. Sometimes the toll gets too heavy.

That night, I reviewed my documentation photos. Something I'd missed before jumped out at me: in both apartments, there was a small symbol drawn in the dust on the windowsill. A circle with three lines radiating from the center. I'd photographed it without thinking, part of my standard procedure to document everything before cleaning.

I spent hours searching online. "Crime scene cleaner" plus "supernatural" plus "symbols" plus "followed home." Most results were urban legends, creepypasta. But I found one forum thread from 2019 that made my blood run cold.

A cleaner in Ohio describing the exact same thing. Same notes. Same symbol. Same escalation pattern.

The thread ended abruptly. The last post was from his brother, saying he'd gone missing.

I went back to work the next day. What else could I do? This is my livelihood. My skill set. I just had to be more careful. More aware.

The call came that afternoon. Robert Martinez, 29, single gunshot wound. Different neighborhood, same story.

I found seven notes in that apartment. All the same handwriting. All hidden in different locations.

**THEY CAN SMELL YOUR FEAR**

**THEY'RE GETTING STRONGER**

**WE'RE INSIDE YOUR HEAD NOW**

**YOU BROUGHT US HERE**

**EVERY SCENE OPENS THE DOOR WIDER**

**YOU CAN'T WASH US OFF**

**WE KNOW YOUR ROUTINE**

The last one was taped inside my equipment case. The case I'd brought from home that morning. The case that had been locked in my truck.

I called Officer Rodriguez, who I'd worked with on several scenes. He came by, took my statement, examined the notes. I could tell he thought this was an elaborate prank or that I was having a breakdown.

"Listen, Mike," he said. "I know this job messes with people. But there's a logical explanation. Someone's targeting you specifically. Maybe an ex, maybe someone with a grudge. We'll look into it."

But I knew he wouldn't find anything. Because I was starting to understand what was happening.

That night, I broke protocol for the first time in eight years.

I didn't decontaminate thoroughly. I was so shaken by the note in my equipment case that I just stripped off my PPE, threw it in the disposal bag, and drove home. I didn't follow the full chemical shower procedure. Didn't wash my hands the required six times.

It was 11 PM when I got home. I live alone in a third floor walkup. No girlfriend, no roommate, no pets. Just me.

I was heating up leftover takeout when I noticed it: a faint odor. Not the usual crime scene smell, I'm used to that. This was different. Organic. Rotting. Like meat left in the sun.

It was coming from my bathroom.

I checked every inch of that bathroom. Nothing. No source. But the smell was there, faint but unmistakable. And it was stronger near the mirror.

I looked at my reflection for a long time. My face looked wrong somehow. The shadows under my eyes too deep. My skin too pale. My pupils too dilated.

Then I noticed something in the corner of the mirror, written in the condensation that shouldn't have been there in November:

**YOU DIDN'T WASH US OFF**

I spent that night in my car in a 24 hour diner parking lot. Couldn't go back to that apartment. Couldn't face whatever was waiting there.

At 6 AM, I got a text from my supervisor: another call. David Park, 33, single gunshot wound. I almost didn't respond. Almost drove to the airport and bought a ticket to anywhere else.

But I needed to understand what was happening. And I had a theory.

I went to the scene. The apartment was familiar now, the pattern was clear. Young man, thirties, suicide, minimal family, delayed discovery. I went straight to the radiator.

Twelve notes this time. All in the same handwriting. But the last one was different. It was written in my handwriting:

**I'M COMING HOME TONIGHT**

I didn't write that. I know I didn't. But it was my handwriting, my signature flourish on the capital I, my habit of pressing harder on the downstrokes.

I dropped my equipment and ran.

I'm writing this from a motel six states away. I've been driving for three days straight, stopping only for gas and bathroom breaks. I haven't slept. Can't sleep.

Because I keep finding the notes.

In my motel room, slipped under the door. In my car, tucked into the sun visor. In my wallet, folded between my credit cards. In my phone, appearing as text messages from my own number.

**YOU CAN'T OUTRUN YOURSELF**

**WE'RE NOT FOLLOWING YOU**

**WE NEVER LEFT**

**YOU BROUGHT US HOME WHEN YOU BROKE PROTOCOL**

**WE LIVE IN THE SPACES BETWEEN CLEAN AND DIRTY**

**WE ARE THE CONTAMINATION YOU CARRY**

I finally understand. Every crime scene cleaner knows the protocol exists for a reason. Not just for physical safety, for something else. Something the old timers knew but never talked about.

When you clean death, you're not just removing biological material. You're removing the memory of violence, the psychic residue, the echo of last moments. That's why the protocol is so specific. That's why you have to be so careful about decontamination.

Because if you're not careful, if you break protocol even once, you carry it with you. The death. The violence. The ending.

And it accumulates. It grows. It becomes aware.

I've been doing this for eight years. Eight years of death scenes, of cleaning up the worst moments of people's lives. How much residue have I carried? How much has soaked into me, particle by particle, scene by scene?

The notes aren't coming from outside. They never were.

They're coming from inside me. From the part of me that's been saturated with death for so long that it's started to have its own thoughts. Its own voice. Its own handwriting.

I'm back in my apartment now. Had to come back eventually. Can't run from yourself.

The smell is everywhere. The mirrors are fogged with messages. The walls are covered in notes in handwriting that shifts between the original block letters and my own script and something in between.

I can feel it inside me, this accumulated death. It moves through my bloodstream like an infection. It whispers behind my thoughts. It shows me things in the corners of my vision, the faces of the dead I've cleaned up after, all watching me, all waiting.

Officer Rodriguez called yesterday. They found something at the Martinez scene after I ran. Four other crime scene cleaners have gone missing in the past three years. All experienced. All careful. All following protocol perfectly.

Until they didn't.

The Ohio cleaner from the forum? They found him eventually. He'd broken into his own storage unit where he kept his old equipment and sealed himself inside. When they opened it, he'd written the same message on every surface, hundreds of times:

**THE PROTOCOL EXISTS FOR A REASON**

I'm writing this as a warning. If you clean crime scenes, if you handle death professionally, follow the protocol. Every step. Every time. No matter how tired you are, no matter how routine it seems, no matter how unnecessary the decontamination procedures feel.

The protocol exists because death is contagious in ways we don't understand. It's not biological, it's something else. Something that accumulates in you, scene by scene, until you've absorbed so much ending that you become an ending yourself.

I broke protocol once. Just once.

That was enough.

The notes have stopped appearing now. I don't need them anymore. I understand what needs to happen. The pattern is clear. Young man, thirties, single gunshot wound, found after a delay.

I'm just continuing the pattern.

My equipment is set up in the bathroom. Industrial grade disinfectant. Enzyme cleaner. Specialized sponges. Everything ready for whoever finds me. I'm making it easy for the next cleaner. Following one last protocol.

I can smell the death on my hands. But it's not coming from my hands.

It's coming from inside me. It always was.

And now it needs to get out.
