All things considered, it's a pretty cushy job. I wouldn't go as far as saying I 'love' it, I'm not out here making people's lives better or living my dream, but its easiness can't be understated. I mean, who doesn't want to listen to metal and smoke all night. Probably some of you I guess, but I certainly have no problems with it.

See, I work overnight security for an unnamed company, and not even the dangerous kind of security. I run the entrance booth. My responsibilities consist of pressing a button to let people in and out. 

It's not rocket science.

You're either on the list or not, and that's all there is to it. Hell, most nights no one even comes in after the shift change. Until recently I guess. That's kind of the point of this post.

The company building, a massive U-shaped structure, sits in a thick wooded area in the Midwest surrounded by ten-foot high chain link fences. It's essentially in the middle of nowhere. The entrance road, paved and well-maintained, leads up to the center of the 'U', which conceals the parking lot. 

I guess now's a good time to apologize for the lack of specific details, but I'm pretty sure one of the papers I signed when I got this job was an NDA. If I'm being honest, I don't even know what the company does, just one of the many I mindlessly sent my resume to on a hiring website.

A quick Google search says they "specialize in synthesizing, designing, and identifying various genetic materials" whatever that means. I'm guessing it's somewhat secretive work, or at the very least sensitive, as the building itself has a whole security team on standby.

They operate out of a separate building, perched just a short distance from the left leg of the 'U'. I'm not sure if they patrol the inside, but I certainly see security people walking up and down the road at all hours of the night, speaking into handheld radios, having conversations unheard through my little glass hut. 

My shift is 12am-8am, so I usually arrive right at midnight to relieve the evening shift guy, clock in there in the booth with an old-school punch card, and, I'll be honest, start my night with a joint. Like I said, most nights I don't even have to interact with anyone, which is fine with me. 

I think the company's actual employees work twelve-hour shifts, 8pm to 8am, since I only see people leaving when I am, myself. 

The booth itself is small, tiny even. It fits a single desk, always cluttered with paperwork and files I don't get paid enough to read and a cheap, worn office chair. Atop the desk sits an outdated monitor with an equally old keyboard and mouse. This is where I do my only real 'work'. 

A spreadsheet is always open on the monitor, listing hundreds of names and positions. When a vehicle pulls up I simply take their ID, search the list for their name, and press a button to open the sliding gate. If a name isn't on the list, I'm supposed to radio the main security office, and, well, I don't really know to be honest. 

Everyone's always been on the list.

Until recently.

It was around 4am when the first unlisted person pulled up to the window of my solace. Blasting the newest Green Lung album and smoking a cigarette, I had just crushed the tip, releasing a cloud of menthol into my ruined lungs when a quick 'honk' penetrated my earbuds. I jumped a little, and spun around before ashing the cig and ripping out the buds.

A sleek, black coupe had silently appeared outside, and the driver's window rolled down slowly. I think they were tinted, but it was hard to tell in the yellow fluorescent light which hung from the roof of the booth. The driver, an older man, maybe in his sixties, smiled at me graciously.

"Didn't mean to scare ya there!" The man called over the light's faint whine. I tried my best to smile professionally.

"Oh you're fine sir, was wrapped up in my own world." Not seeing the man make any move for his wallet, I decided to ask. "Would you mind showing me your ID?"

"Ah yes of course" he said quickly, reaching into his back pocket. He fumbled around for a second before producing a liscense like I had never seen before. I almost assumed it was fake before noticing the large 'UK' printed in the top left.

"Ah, not from around here huh?" I asked in my psuedo-happy professional voice. He laughed in a slight exhale.

"Just here on business"

I turned around to the monitor, typed in his name, and almost pressed the button out of habit before seeing the screen.

No results found.

I wrote his name on a crumpled post-it and handed him his card back and smiled sheepishly.

"Just give me one second please" I said, sliding the window closed behind me. I was panicked at this point, as panicked as anyone doing something for the first time. Snatching the radio from the desk, I clicked it on and pressed the button.

"This is front-gate security requesting assistance, over." It took a second, but the radio eventually squealed to life.

"I read you front-gate security, over." The man sounded surprised almost.

"Yeah I got a guy here who's not on the list, over."

"Name? Over."

I looked at the post-it and recited the name to the man on the other end of the line.

"One second." He replied. I glanced out the window to the man in the car, and, smiling, held up a finger. Finally, after far too long a pause, the radio squealed at me once more.

"He's good, over." The voice came, distant, uninterested. So that was it then? I don't know what I was expecting, preparing myself for, but it wasn't this.

"Copy." I said, and pressed the button, waving at the man as his car slid silently through the company's first line of defense.

Closing the gate behind him, I sat down at the desk and pulled up Internet Explorer. Technically, the computer had internet access, but it wasn't strong enough to stream anything. The page opened to Google and I typed in his name.

I should clarify, nothing about the man's demeanor made me suspicious of him, nothing about him worried me at all. I was just curious who this visitor was.

To my surprise, a wikipedia page came up. 

The guy was an astronaut and astrophysicist. An honest to God spaceman. At least, he used to be. His career seemed to have declined with his age, though he was obviously important at one time. I was awestruck. 

Again, I can't go into specifics, but this man was legit. He had helped put satellites in space, helped rockets launch successfully, and had even taken a space-walk in the 90s. His resume was longer than my list of recipients. He could've been a celebrity; if actual science made people famous anyways.

Closing the browser, I put my earbuds back in and retreated into my own world once more, shaking my head at the series of events that just unfolded in front of me. I met an actual astronaut.

After that, it was slow for a while. I took one of my walks along the outer fence basking in the nighttime noise. Trees rustled above, adding an omnipresent static to the background of existence. A small possum scurried across the beaten path I had forged myself over the months of working here. A group of coyotes howled in the distance.

The ambulance came two hours later.

Its sirens blaring, the young driver yelled through the window that they were responding to an emergency. I didn't even think before letting them in, and that's probably a good thing, as fifteen minutes later it sped up to the exit gate, sirens still screaming.

Again, I opened it immediately, and gasped when I saw its passenger in the rising sun. The astronaut himself lay sprawled across the stretcher in back, grasping his chest. A paramedic stood over him checking various vitals and tapping away at the screens which dotted its cab.

Before turning out of the complex, the man raised his head, and met my gaze through the two dirty windows which serrated us. His eyes were open wide, his jaw was set in stone. I could almost make out a shiver in his body.

He looked scared. 

Horrified.

The rest of the night I sat in tense silence, the music not doing much to ease my nerves. Eventually I grabbed the radio once more and asked simply:

"Everything good? Over." A short pause before static filled my ears.

"Just a medical situation, everything's taken care of. Over."

I felt bad for the man more than anything else, someone at retirement age with such an impressive background still working, and at such a late time, clearly having a heart attack on the job he was probably too old to work. Sparking another joint, my mind went to trivial things, like how he would get his car back from such an out-of-the-way place.

I smoked in my solitude, processing everything until the door swung open behind me and I realized my shift was over. I hopped up quickly, punched my card, and slid it into the regular file organizer before leaving. 

I was parked outside of the complex, in a small lot alongside the main road. The walk there was beautiful. I wasn't sure if it was the events of the night making me see the world in a different light, or if the weed still hadn't worn off, but it felt like I noticed all the nature for the first time. 

The frogs and crickets whose songs covered the still night had conceded to finch chirps and woodpecker knocks. The orchestra filled my ears as a breeze swept down the road and rustled branches overhead, a full symphony of nature playing for myself. 

I almost cringed when I closed the car door behind me, killing the beautiful background. I fought the urge to open the door and step back into its magnificence before turning the key and speeding off, cutting a foul line through the beauty.

It was only three days before the next unlisted visitor.

And the beginning of the strangeness.

~

I was out on another walk, probably around 3am. The moon shone full in the void above. I had just lit a joint when the sound of squeaking metal tore me from the music of nature. Stopped me dead in my tracks. The sound continued, echoing throughout the woods which surrounded me. 

Someone was shaking the fence.

I took a step forward. Then another. Just a short distance away I could make out a hulking shadow wrestling with the chain link. My heart caught in my throat, and I nearly turned to run before my brain recognized the shape. A deer. Its antlers were caught amongst the twisted wire. I inched forward slowly, not wanting to scare the poor thing and risk it hurting itself. 

“It’s okay” I said to myself more than the deer. “You’re okay” I muttered as it tried to turn its head towards me to no avail. It huffed, let out a slight squeal. Every instinct the big guy had was telling it to run, yet it couldn’t. Flicking on my flashlight and gripping it with my teeth, I reached out with shaky hands and grasped its antlers before gently pushing its head down. Once I found the right angle, I pulled.

Its head snapped around in an instant and I had to jump backwards to avoid being impaled.It stared at me, looked into my eyes. 

I wanted to vomit.

The animal's lower jaw was gone, hanging there limp. In place of its teeth were dozens of yellow maggots, squirming about in the rotting flesh. The putrid smell, which I somehow hadn’t noticed before, brought tears to my eyes. Within a second, it had turned and sprinted away.

I stood there, frozen in time, feeling the weight of the flashlight in my hand while trying to settle my now-queasy stomach. It acted so normal, like it didn’t know anything was wrong with itself. I stood there shivering as a pair of headlights flooded the forest around me. Someone was pulling up to the gate. I never walked far enough to where I couldn’t see the booth, and I silently thanked myself for it while running back to my station. 

Just as I entered the stuffy closet, a vehicle pulled up to the window.

The interaction was almost an exact copy of the previous. Another black coupe, another older individual, this time a woman, and another "let her in" from security. Again, I pressed the button to open the gate, and again, the car slid through. Though, before doing so, she leaned out the window and looked me in the eyes. For a second, I felt as though I was staring at the deer once more.

"You know you're making history" she said, a wide grin smeared across her face. Then, without another word, rolled the window up and proceeded. I immediately opened the shitty computer’s shittier browser and plugged her name into the search engine. My breath caught in my throat.

There wasn’t a wikipedia page, nothing that overt. Instead, a plethora of articles explaining various promotions within, get this, the Department of Homeland Security. 

The woman was almost as decorated as the man was, though definitely wasn't an astronaut. This girl played the game it seemed, made connections, knew what strings to pull to further her career. At least this time no ambulance followed her entrance, instead, the lady left shortly before my shift ended. I nodded at her as she drove by, gave a slight wave as she turned the corner and pulled out onto the road.

And then it became a regular occurrence.

Over my next five shifts, three unannounced visitors showed up, each one receiving permission to continue forward. 

An ex-CIA director, a NASA specialist who played a key role in the Apollo 11 mission, who literally help Neil Armstrong walk on the moon, and strangely enough, an artist. It started to feel like the company was a fly trap for renowned individuals, myself the only wall between them and the regular world.

It was the night the artist that I made another startling discovery. Sat outside the booth on the pavement, cigarette in hand, I tilted my head back to admire the sky above. I had a surprisingly clear view through the tree coverage, except, I slowly realized, there wasn’t any.

The trees were bare.

Naked, spindly fingers reached for the stars, twitching in the breeze. The occasional leaf still floated down from above, making an escape from their parents. I looked down at the ground, and sure enough, a thick layer of dying leaves covered the forest floor, and even the road in some places. An uneasy silence engulfed the scene around me. 

Silence.

Not only were the trees bare but so was the air throughout. No crickets chirped, no frogs sang out to their kin. I suddenly felt surrounded, suffocated, by the lack of noise. Everything had an underlying layer of uneasiness, an overwhelming sense of wrong that can’t be described in words. It overtook me.

I hopped up and locked myself back in the booth, turning on some music to fight the feeling which filled my core. That was when I heard it. A muffled ‘thump’ on the glass behind me. My blood ran cold. Slowly, too slowly, I turned around to see: nothing. 

No mysterious person stood knocking on the window, no monstrosity filled the frame. I stood up and pushed my eyes up against it, my vision sweeping back and forth. I had all but chalked it up to my imagination when I saw the bat flopping on the asphalt in front of the booth. I watched as it flung itself too and fro on the ground, trying, and failing, to take off. 

Its wings were bent at horrible angles, its body protruding thin white bone through its matted black fur. I should’ve killed it, right? Should’ve put it out of its, very clear, misery. I didn’t though, couldn’t. I watched for what could’ve been an eternity as it struggled in silence until finally, it stopped.

I grabbed a paper towel and took the bat behind the booth, where I buried it under a mound of leaves.

During my next shift, a storm rocked my little slice of squalor, rattled the windows in their frames. I had cranked the music to drown out the pouring rain, the distant thunder. Sulphur Aeon echoed around the chamber, competing with the storm for ground to make their sound. 

I had just sparked a spliff when the hail started. It came down in waves, its force something to marvel at. Being summer, its presence confused me, though I continued scrolling on my phone unfaltered. The hail was massive, golf ball-sized as it slammed into the windows, shook the building to its core, that being myself.

I felt as though I was forging ahead through a hurricane, my little security booth my ship, as the waves pounded the hull. If I was a religious man, I might’ve prayed, instead I simply took another hit and turned the music up louder.

The sun rose as the storm subsided, and I, going stir crazy after a night locked in, decided to go for a walk in the slight sprinkle of rain which still dripped from the bare branches above. The patter of drops on decaying leaves added a rhythm to the outside which I found somewhat comforting. My comfort was short-lived however, as while the sun was rising, bringing light to the dark forest, a thud sounded on the wet leaves behind me.

I spun around to see a small finch laying in the dirt, dead. Another sound forced my attention to the left, where another bird fell from a tree. 

Then another. 

And another.

All around me birds and bats fell from their perches, their homes, and twitched upon the bed of leaves. A white rabbit bounded across the path in front of me before running into a tree head-on and laying still, its neck hanging at a strange angle. Coyotes howled in guttural moans, their smooth sounds replaced with hoarse screams.

I turned, ran down the path back to my tiny solace as nature collapsed around me.

I’m writing this the day after. I showed up for my shift today to see dozens of hazmat-clad men shoveling the corpses of rabbits, possums, and birds into clear plastic bags. Parking in my usual spot, I began the short walk to the booth taking in the chaos around me. Fallen trees and naked bushes dotted the now empty-feeling forest. It could’ve been a scene from the news, coverage of a tornado’s aftermath.

A man in a blue suit, as opposed to the many yellows which littered the woods, stopped my approach to the booth. He held out his hand, issued a simple order:

“Turn back please.”

“I work here” I said sheepishly.

“All employees have been given the day off” He retorted instantly. I hesitated, but eventualLy turned back, strode once more through the damage and got in my car. My weekend starts tomorrow, so I guess I get three days off.

I’m sitting at home now, typing this up to a group of people who have no way, or even reason to help me. I just needed to get this out there, needed to have others to experience this with me.

I don’t know what’s going on.

I don’t know if I want to
