A short story that happened to me in Tunisia between 2009 and the end of 2011. We had just moved into a house in Ennasr 1. I don’t remember the exact address anymore, but I think it was a street parallel to Hedi Nouira, next to the Broadway restaurant. It was like a small group of several houses in a cul-de-sac; all the houses were painted brown except ours, which was white. Anyway, there were four bedrooms and a terrace. My bedroom was on the ground floor, next to the living room and the front door.

To this day, I still can’t forget those two years of hell. The first paranormal phenomena started with plates falling and breaking in the middle of the night even though they were inside cupboards; taps turning on by themselves; noises on the windows and doors; lights and TVs turning on on their own. Strange things, but things you could probably find explanations for.

But it got worse the day when, just before falling asleep, I heard knocking on my bedroom window. I thought I saw a silhouette, so I closed the shutters because I was scared. Then I woke up in the middle of the night, twisted around in my bed (my head under the blanket and my feet on the pillow). I didn’t understand what was happening to me, and I tried to get up, but I couldn’t. The light was on, and since the sheets and the blanket were white, I could see the light through them. I didn’t understand because I had gone to sleep with the light off.

I tried to remove the blanket and the sheet, but I couldn’t, and then I saw what looked like arms pushing against me so I couldn’t get up. I started to panic and struggle to breathe, and I began to scream. Suddenly, it all stopped, and a woman pulled me free and left my bedroom. At the time, I thought it was a member of my family, but thinking back, I hadn’t recognized her because I never saw her face. I asked the girls who were living with us, and all of them confirmed they had no idea what I was talking about.

The second thing that happened to me: one night around 3 a.m., I left my room to get some water, and when I opened the door, I saw a little boy on the stairs in front of me. I could see his entire body except his face (he had red hair). I stared at him for about 10 seconds. He waved at me to say hello, and I waved back, wondering who this kid was, because there was no little boy living with us, let alone a red-haired one. When I waved at him, he started running toward me. Out of fear, I turned on the hall light, and he disappeared. I couldn’t sleep for two days after that. I thought I was going crazy, but I only told my father about it.

A few months later, my two sisters saw the same thing. A child opened their door in the middle of the night and closed it again when they started screaming. Both of them saw it, even though they were in separate rooms.

The third phenomenon: my father’s wife opened the door to her bedroom in the middle of the day and found an old woman in her room, sitting on her bed, sewing and talking. After my stepmother asked her who she was, she disappeared.

And there were many more things that happened—things even stranger and more terrifying. To this day, we still talk about it as a family, and it still scares us. You probably won’t believe me, and that’s fine. Just know that if this house is still standing, or if a friend or a family member ever lives there, do not go near it under any circumstances. The longer we stayed in that house, the more we felt we were not welcome. We left at the peak of the phenomena.

The neighbors know and are complicit. They know that something serious happened there and that this house is haunted. On top of that, they are very strange and cold. From their windows, they used to watch us when we were on our terrace. I lived 22 years in Tunisia, and I have never lived in a house like that. It’s not just a haunted house—it’s the devil’s house.

It would be easy for me to find the exact address, but I won’t share it so as not to bother the current residents of the house (if it still exists). If anyone has ever lived there and sees this post, I’m sure they’ll know which house I’m talking about.
