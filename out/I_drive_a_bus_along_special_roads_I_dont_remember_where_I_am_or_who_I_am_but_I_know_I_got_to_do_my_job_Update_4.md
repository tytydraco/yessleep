**First recording in set begins.**

 You know, I’m glad I asked for extra tapes. The Mailman gave me three extra recorders with the tape box. I’m missing three out of four now, including the original, and it’s irking me just a tad. The first one we used for that decoy maneuver, and it saved our lives, so it’s no big problem. The other two, though? I’ve gotta go lookin’.

If they’d been taken by someone regular, I honestly would just sigh and move myself on. I can get more pretty easily, most likely just need to ask. So it’s no skin off my back and it probably won’t break any laws that’ll get skin off someone else’s since it don’t matter to me much. Thing is, though. A certain previous passenger took it. I’m a bit worried they’ll go on and get into mischief. Get themselves hurt.

There isn’t much important information in these, yet. Just my personal feelings, a few bad days. But I don’t know where the line will be with prying if someone curious decides to give it a listen. Or, hell, uses it as a trap for someone else. And there’s a lot of curious, not quite fully adjusted sorts around here.

I went with my new Trainee to that strangely named town once I healed up. I was real curious, and I felt I needed a break. The Lodge, it didn’t stop following us. Not entirely. I asked around about it, got my memory jogged a bit. I know I’ve seen it before. Turns out it’s been a problem for a good while. I think it waits till you forget it. Or if you won’t forget it, it tries to stress you out, break you down until you either make yourself too much a fighter to trouble with or you keel over.

I don’t think I’m that much a fighter. But security is, and my eyes are real wary on the road now. Long as I don’t fall for none of it’s tricks anymore, it can’t do much. And I like to think, when I try real hard to keep my head on straight, I’m a smart enough fellow.

So this town. Turns out that, yeah, the pictures are in fact the name. Dog - cat - man - dagger is a bit of a mouthful, though, so I’m personally just calling it the menagerie. I walk in with my Trainee, and I find it looks a heck of a lot like an old theater mixed with a carnival, but if you blew its proportions way up like a circus tent till it turned into a whole community. All these fancy lights all around, all these shops with strange names. Even the livin’ space was odd, the houses were tent-shaped but made of wood that was either real dark or real colorful.

The town rules, too, were a bit perplexing. They read like: no intentional violence, no intentional stealing, no toxic food or drinks, no flashlights, and no traffic blockades, and no excessive capital letters. They had a punishment list that was fairly straightforward, too. It said breaking rules may result in fines, banishment, loss of tickets, social shunning for a determined period, or refusal of sale.

At first, I’m kind of on edge. The place seems too… Straightforwardly strange. On the road, after a while, you expect people to either be real awkward and confusing, real polite and warm, or real sneaky and predator-like. Always some nuance, or some hidden line to tiptoe across. But my Trainee goes right on through, beckons me with her hand, and I follow. I trust her, and I think to myself that sometimes you need to let your guard down for a bit, else you go mad.

First thing I notice is the great abundance of cats roaming around. All sorts of color schemes. Had everything from midnight black to fuzzy orange to polka dot. The second I notice is the puppet carts. I see the ‘shadow puppets’ my Trainee mentioned the other day, and find they’re quite literal. There’s a shadow for every thing old and new I could recognize, or probably place if I thought real hard about it.

The shadows of business men, doctors, officers of the law. Animal shadows. More monster type ones, exaggerated to show lots of teeth and with plenty of dramatic posturing. There was even a mailman, a milkman, a bus driver just like me. If I looked at the shadows, they looked real detailed. Kind of like if you took your own shadow, gave it a lot of texture, outlined it with a lighter or deeper shade of black, then stuck it back on the wall.

Every single one was either way smaller, like you’d expect, than the real thing, or life sized depending on the size of their cart. I kind of got nervous moving around them. Thing is, around these parts, even if you find a place where some rules matter more than others, something that seems straightforward probably isn’t. Might not even be intentional. Not everyone has all the little ins and outs of something they make up click right away. I was worried if I passed by one of these folk, I might rip em’ in two with my own shadow, distort them and cause em’ hurt.

Eventually, my Trainee tugged on me while I was walking about like a lumbering ogre with tiny feet, all cross-stepping and hunched and shying away from the world.

“Look.” She said. Pointed. So I looked, and saw I needed to pay more attention to my surroundings than my fears, since a light reflected just right and I saw there was a thin sheet of some kind of colorful glass on every cart, so pale it blended in with all the lights around. I peered at one and saw they all had little notes: flashlight - hazard sign - shield - equals - prohibition sign - thumbs up.

“Huh. Well ain’t that swell as beans.”

“...Beans aren’t supposed to swell.”

I looked at my Trainee’s feet. She didn’t have toe beans. It took me longer than it should’ve for my goof to click. She kind of stared at me like she was wondering if I needed to go back to a medical sort of place, then grinned real big, then laughed.

“I’m old. Let me be slow sometimes.” I smiled, though I felt my face go red a bit.

We went to a diner after wandering around a bit. I realized that I should probably make a habit of visiting these places from time to time. That I need to unwind so I don’t spin out like a bad fishing rod when it’s most likely to cause me to crash and burn. Wandering proper, actually stopping at the stops and smelling the flowers, would keep my head on right. Remind me why I want people to get back to these places all safe in the first place, see them with their own eyes.

I took a few notes on what I saw. In case I had passengers like these ones later. Wondered if I could finally find a place to get the side ramp fixed in case someone needed to wheel up onto my bus.

The diner was real colorful, and it felt homey. When I walked in, it was all bright red booths, checkers in black and white on the floor. Old music, that kind of crackled in a pleasant sort of way. I think I almost remembered a few things right then, just walking in. I get scared of remembering sometimes. Worry it’ll burn out my necessary senses, make me question or think ill of folk. I know well there’s gaps, honest. I may seem all befuddled, like I don’t know there’s secrets all around. But you’re not supposed to pry. And truth be told, I think, sometimes, that applies to yourself, too. That if you look too long in the mirror, you’ll start missing things, not see what’s in front of-

Like I’m doing right now. Okay, I’ll back up a bit.

So we sit down. I hear the seat squeak under me, feel myself creak with the bend of the leather. Something smarts, and I wince, and my Trainee looks at me like she’s expecting me to snap in two.

“I’m good.” I smile at her, tip my hat, and she smiles back at me a lil’ nervous-like.

I struggle for a moment when a waitress comes up to me. She’s fully ‘normal’, so to speak, far as I can tell. Like me. Cherry hair and freckles, wearing a nice dress that’s all blue white and pink with a little hat that reminds me of a fondant. I look around, see more sorts like us. I feel a grin creep onto my face, feel a little giddy. The tension drains out of me. I realize it’s a safe place, where everyone walks the same. Something less warm tugs at my heart, too, but I push it down. I don’t like the cold.

It turns out that old money is good here, still. I keep a wallet with me that’s a bit big, with some oddly-shaped pockets and even some tiny hooks. There’s all sorts of stand-in money around these parts, see. I’d sort of expected to trade in the item for item style, and my heart raced a bit as I thought I’d be stuck walking into a diner with my very own apprentice and showing her I wasn’t prepared for something as simple as dinner.

I work things out. We have a bite, and-

**Trainee:** Why do humans eat things like that? So much… Excess. I thought I was going to die.

**Driver:** You know, I kind of thought the same. **Chuckle.** I forgot how… How… *Much* we put in things, when you let us.

**Trainee:** You almost keeled over like a fly getting swatted.

**Driver:** Heartburn is serious business. So are heart attacks.

I try not to ponder back too far, to wonder when it was last time I’d had me a milkshake with a cherry and everything. When I’d traded a dollar, or a nickel or a quarter, for something. It’s easy to let the fog slide over my memory when they bring in one of those puppet carts. I look around, notice that there’s a few of them in the corners, or even at the windows, where the shadow folk were just. Mimicking. I saw one with a little shadow bus and a hat shaped like mine, copying my every motion, sitting just like me.

When I looked down, my own shadow was still there, right at my foot. When I looked up, I saw there was a stage in the corner with a big red curtain. I can’t quite remember if it’d been there before, but could’ve been easy enough. I was a bit distracted when I came in and all. On the stage, there’s one of them carts.

“Looks like they’re doing a play.”

“Yeah.” My Trainee seems pretty interested, I watch her glue her eyes to it. I find myself transfixed, too. I don’t sit down and just. Let myself be entertained often. Least, not without being ready to spring back up and hit the gas or concede my time to someone else’s directions.

**Trainee:** It was a beautiful reenactment.

**Driver:** Reenactment? Like, historical?

**Trainee:** Yes! Very important part of the past! You wouldn’t know about it, though.

**Driver:** Should I?

**Trainee:** No. Hm. Hmmm. No.

I learn about then that, though all the shadow folk seem to have a preferred - maybe default. Resting? - shape, they can change it up as they please. Probably shouldn’t have been surprised about it. They don’t really announce the topic of the show, or dim any lights, though the shadows around the stage grow, the light in the stage area gets a little brighter, just a tad more visible.

I eat kind of quiet like as I watch a story unfold that, far as I remember, goes a little like this: a king loses his country, but he still has his people. So he gathers them all on one big fleet of ships. The king gets old, and tired, and loses most of his fleet as he endures a number of grueling trials. Twelve ships turn to eleven, then ten, then go all the way down to two. He’s looking for a new land to call his own, see, but he doesn’t manage to find a place without tricks and dangers.

By the end, he’s being called upon by some kind of moon goddess. When she tells him she has a place for him on the moon, she says she only has space for one ship. When he asks why, she says there’s one too many people between the ships, and not enough of the ships' wood can be repurposed to build new houses for all of them up in the sky. So the king refuses the second ship’s insistence on staying back on earth, and then all his most loyal subjects offer themselves to stay behind. The king says he is not the country, and stays behind in the dangerous below lands, all by his lonesome and without a vessel.

I nod and toss something the performers’ way, and I looked back to my Trainee to ask what she thought. Remember that one fellow I mentioned before? The one who sent the odd letter about the clowders?

Yeah, turns out he’d been sitting there for a while. I jump out of my skin, and clutch my shirt. Feel like I should be calling a name, for some reason, out of being startled but I struggle to call it up before I just frown. “How long you been here?”

“Since the cats called to me.” I can’t remember what their voice sounded like, but I think it was… Unusual. I realize my Trainee had probably noticed before I did, I was so enraptured and her ear being so big. He’d come in from the right.

I’d back and forth’d some letters with them for a while as I was cooped up in bed. My Trainee brought me in the slips, sent some back for me. She didn’t read them, was polite as could be. My trust got a little thicker. It was good to know I could trust her to go where I needed her to get. That’d she knew how to handle herself, knew the land, knew not to stick her head where it don’t belong.

“Didn’t expect to see you here… How’re things going? Over the wall.” Part of me was a little curious for more personal reasons. Getting exposed to the diner atmosphere made me… Rash, I think.

They didn’t respond with much detail at first, but they warmed up quick enough. I’d started calling them Ori. Like origami, since that’s what they reminded me of. Nickname, of course. I don’t ever ask the actual name. Not safe out here. “I am amassing a following.” They told me.

“Like… A ballet group?”

“A litter.” They pause for a sec, kind of do some equivalent to a head tilt. “Clowder.”

“Chowder?” I wasn’t sure what that word meant. You don’t hear it often.

“Cats. Like you call rabbits in groups herds.” My Trainee mimicked the head tilt. I think I saw Ori relax, there. They kinda folded - or unfolded? Not sure - into their seat. The noise that made wasn’t pleasant.

“Really?” I looked at my Trainee.

“Fluffle. Colony. Nest. Attendancy.”

“Huh. Why the last one?”

She just smiled at me. I’m looking at her right now, and she’s smiling here too.

**Trainee:** I’ll show you later.

We talked for a while, the three of us. I settled in. Let myself become one with the booth leather, left a big old imprint when I got up later. I think I almost dozed off at one point. It was a nice little moment. I was allowed to lower my guard without consequence. I think my Trainee and Ori hit it off a bit. I kind of wanted to tease her about it, but I didn’t really know how. Strange bedfellows.

**Rabbity growling.**

I didn’t know rabbits could do that. She’s making a face at me, all quiet now.

**Driver:** You okay?

She’s just looking out the window.

So I finished eating a while ago by this point. I’m wanting to get back on the bus. Make sure everything’s in order still. I get antsy when I’m away from it too long. It’d be a hard thing to steal, I’ve got enough sentimental items on it if you tried to drive off you’d call up the-

**Notable silence.**

\-My head’s a bit fuzzy. Something would happen quick like. Anyway, Ori leaves first. I think for a bit. I’m a little worried about them. They mentioned a lot of things about animals. Shelters. Alleys, whatnot. They were clearly comfortable with me enough to tell me how they were really feeling about the world. So I called them a particular word. “Let me know if you need to be gettin’ anywhere, friend?” And I smile, tip my hat.

 They pause, and they kind of nod - in their own way, was more a bend-twist-crack - And my Trainee points out to me something isn’t there anymore a bit after they're gone. At first, I’m back in my old head, when I used to - I think - go to diners a lot. Something took my wallet! But then I realize the recorder is gone. I’d brought one in, see, to show if there was a shop about, see if I could get some old tapes. Or new ones. Maybe they still make new tapes, I thought. I’d heard about audiobooks being a thing.

But it’s not there. And when we get back to the bus, I notice half my tapes are missing. And so is another recorder.

**Trainee:** I remember the sound of their heartbeat. It took me a while, to understand. They’re strange, on the inside. Different. But it’d been beating very fast.

**New recording begins.**

They did not like the way I bent. How I fit so easily into spaces. How I was too short or too tall, and even the ones who liked me thought I was awkward. The noises I made they hated the most.

But the feline. The feline I did not look at. I did not want to be hated by something so small and beautiful. Yet, it approached me. It made a pleasant noise. It did not shy away when I returned the same sound.

I offered it something of value, something to eat, in one hand. In the other, I hesitantly offered affection. And it did not reject me. I found more, and they accepted me as easily. I found many that had been left to be alone. Those who were abandoned. Those who were too ugly. Those who had been lost, or never been wanted in the first place. I learned there were those who would destroy them, forget them, for being too plentiful.

Why was something so beautiful not something to want in abundance?

I forget much, but I do not forget the beautiful things. The pleasant sounds. The sensations. Am I wrong to not remember all that I experience and am told? I remember something well. That you do not take that which does not belong to you. But I have done it. I have done it. I will not let them be abandoned. Removed. Forgotten.

It wants voices. So I will take them.

**New Tape is Inserted. New Voice:** I love you, too.

**New Tape is Inserted. New Voice:** When will dinner be ready?

**New Tape is Inserted. New Voice:** You performed beautifully, today.

**New Tape is Inserted. New Voice:** I saw something bright, a beam, in the alleys last night. Should we call the police?

**New Tape is Inserted. New Voice:** I think something is watching me.

**New Tape is Inserted. New Voice:** She’s been missing for weeks! You have to find her!

**New Tape is Inserted. New Voice:** I thought the glass was supposed to be durable. It broke the glass so easy. Who do I tell? You’re not supposed to be able to do that. The rules…

**New Tape is Inserted. New Voice:** I’ve heard noises from the old tunnels lately. Flickering, shuffling, footsteps. I heard them this morning right under my house. Do you think it’s back?

**Extended shuffling. Paper moving. Cracking. Tearing. Long silence.** 

I am going to the tunnels now. The secret places where the cats should reign, their greatest alley. I was happy to see the driver again. The last time I saw them, they had seemed sick. They reminded me of me, but if they had been bent that way instead of born bent. I will send them a letter of apology later. I will remember to bring something. They do not notice at the gate, still, when I hide the cats. I will build my kingdom, and become a lord who cares.

Should I tell him something is wrong with his transport? I may need strong wheels to carry my clowder.

**First recording resumes. Brief silence.**

Give me a second. **Lengthy pen scratching.** Okay, I’m good to continue. I’m sorry, I gotta skip ahead a bit. I gotta skip ahead while it’s still in my noggin. I gotta record it so I don’t forget.

We ask around town. It’s a little hard to do. I wasn’t sure if the big rules were the ones I use on the road, the ones they use in the bright or over the wall, or the local ones were first in order of importance. Or if they were the only rules that mattered. It was a big enough place. Had a strong enough soul.

It’s fruitless, for a while. We get some rumors, a few directions, but the word of mouth and the trail ends in a crevice just big enough for our friend to fit through. And we don’t know where it goes.

A cat comes up. Starts scratching at the wall. And I remember something. Ori drew pictures with the slips, sometimes. Once, it’d drawn a black cat with a little white spot on its ear. Said they were ‘taking them to a real shelter’.

I watched it sniff around. My Trainee tilted her good ear its way. “It’s heart is beating fast.”

The cat makes a noise at us, scratches at the wall, then circles before bounding off. I get a hunch. I nod at my apprentice and we both follow it. It takes us through the zigzagging streets and away from the colorful lights, the music, the familiar and strange shades of warmth. It takes us to some kind of tunnel entrance. It looked familiar, somehow, and it clicked that it might’ve been an old maintenance tunnel of some kind. I stood there for a moment, realized I could sort of feel a road somewhere down there. Thing is, the roads aren’t always where it makes sense on paper. Sometimes, they just. Go through places. Sometimes the world fades away, and you pass through everything like it isn’t there.

I frowned. Felt my shoulders tense up. I looked about me, and I couldn’t really square the opening with everything else. It was at the far end of town, but if I pretended it made sense with the layout it connected to nothing and was just. There. It was all boarded up, too. Was a sign with pictures on it. Caution sign - sad face - dog - dagger - tombstone - flashlight.

I didn’t know what the hell it meant. But the black cat slid through a crack in the boarding like it were nothing, and I realized I could picture a real flexible fellow fitting in easy.

I didn’t need much convincing. I asked my Trainee to stay behind, since she was kind of holding herself oddly, breathing a little strange.

**Quiet.**

She wouldn’t leave it be though, and pointed out I was more like to not come back than she was. I went in anyways, tried to stay in front of her. Had to pry out the nails from the boards till I could bend on through. I got a little mailbag type pack with me I carry around sometimes, got it from the Office. I use it to carry mail when I’m helping the Mailman, and when I’m not, in goes some tools. You never know what sort of things you’ll deal with on the road, see, or when you’ll need to pull or pick or twist or pry somethin’.

I hold tight to my hammer till it hurts. I don’t plan on hitting anyone with it, not even if they come running at me. Bad way to get caught on the fine print, that. All something needed to do was give me a good scare, make me swing, and all of a sudden they had the right to every hair on my head.

The tunnel twists oddly. It seems like a standard maintenance tunnel. All sorts of pipes. Some side doors. I don’t look in those, don’t want to get tricked into prying. The tunnels are just a bit too wide, a bit too high. The ceiling kind of bends, here and there, and I don’t know why. I hear footsteps from above, but I’m sure there’s not a single soul walking on top. Nothing for us to be under, far as I could tell from the outside. The place just connected to a random building in a quiet, barely inhabited part of town. Didn’t even have a second floor, like it was half-finished.

I notice there’s a light switch on the wall. Then I notice there’s a bulb above my head, and I follow it to find there’s dozens of switches and bulbs. It’s not dark in here, a little too bright, since they’re all on. When you haven’t been in a place like this, sometimes it gets harder for the out-of-touch to click. Things that shouldn’t be subtle become so, while obvious things remain obvious once your instincts are trained just right. It’s how the world gets you, those blindspots.

Eventually, the tunnels turn into a maze. I start seeing some places where the bulbs aren’t on. I don’t know if I should, or could, turn around. I get weary, strain my ears. But my Trainee still has the better, so when she perks her head up and starts walking I just follow. I hear noises from the doors sometimes. I side eye them, but keep myself from peeking. And I notice that a lot of things are very evenly paced, despite the unusual shape of things.

Every light bulb was at an exact interval. Every switch. The doors, when they were present, had a very particular pacing. I wondered if, should I be handed a map of the place, I’d find the uneven bits were, themselves, spaced a certain way.

The cat starts heading a different direction from us. From my Trainee. I pause, slap my hammer into my hand as I think. I start hearing voices, watch the cat and the rabbit-

**Thump.**

\-My Trainee pauses. She and the cat cock their heads like twins towards the sounds. We're at a spot where the tunnel splits in two, and the cat is just a little down the left one. Right. I remember now. That’s what their voice sounded like. Their voice and another are both coming from the two tunnels at once.

“I brought the voices. You may take them. Return what is owed.” Ori's voice had the texture of jittery, frail paper. Like when I’d first heard it. I heard a shuffling-cracking noise, remembered I’d heard it when the bus had gotten stalled. I think it was a nervous tick. I think they’d been doing it in the diner, too, but I hadn’t noticed then.

I started moving towards it. But I paused, shifted my feet and pursed my lips.

“Were you the one flashing down the tunnel during the blackout? Wasn’t funny, you know. Scared the shit out of me.” The other voice was gruff. Bitter.

“I don’t understand.” I heard shuffling, that frail, jittery voice got thinner and whispery.

“We need to fix the wiring. Something’s bad with the pipes, too. The hell is-” Sounded like a woman, maybe.

“Yes, take it. Thank you.” A pause. “Pal?” I heard cat noises. Saw the black cat sprint down the left tunnel, making those same noises. I paused. I realized I was hearing the other voices from two directions. But I wasn’t hearing Ori from both anymore, just the left. I hear a lot more voices pop up to join the chorus, coming from the same direction Ori's was now, played with that slight static off a voice recorder.

“The train stopped and won’t go. I saw light down the tunnel. Do you think something’s wrong?” A younger fellow. I hear shuffling. My Trainee is moving down the right tunnel, following something only she seems to hear. I freeze up a bit. Things aren’t clear, but I have to make a choice.

I choose wrong. I go with the cat. And I realize too late Ori’s voice is getting further away, not closer, and is now behind me.

The lights flicker off. All of them, at the same time. There’s silence for a moment. Then I see a flashlight at the end of the tunnel. “I traded something with you, fair and square. You need to give me back something of the same quality.” The voice was more refined now, like someone trying to do an impression of someone quite polite and civilized.

I think that’s when I realized I didn’t hear a lot of the shadow folk speak.

“There’s something shuffling behind the doors. Do you think it’s rats? We can’t have rats in storage. Last damn thing I needed-” There’s a brief pause, like a pin dropping. “What the fuck is that?” And I realize it’s coming from the far end of the tunnel, where the light is beaming out.

Something opens, somewhere in the dark. I hear a lot of creaking, slow and patient. A switch flicks off, and I hear something move. In a perfect pattern, all the switches jerk up and down, and so do the bulbs they’re tied to. More lights join the first beam until my whole vision is filled with moving spotlights, darkness left stretching behind them as the light from the bulbs jumps down the hall. They’re coming my way. And the length of empty wall space between each switch is longer than my stride.

I start running. I’m breathing hard, and my heart starts to hurt. I feel cold. I hear flicking, and shuffling. I hear someone else running, and I think the cat was following me, padding along at a sprint. Its black fur was ready to be swallowed into the dark. All the light needed to do was pass it, and it’d find that, despite the white on its one ear, its coat blended perfectly with the shadows.

I can’t outpace it. I run until my lungs are ready to give out. I stop and spin, and twist, and the world flashes in black and yellow as I try to figure out where my friends had gone. My passengers. I needed to get them where they needed to go. And I couldn’t do that if we all went away. But the tunnels are full of side paths, and the voices are everywhere.

"I'm heading your way. Come towards me if you can." It sound like my Trainee, smooth and gentle, even though I can hear the strain in her voice.

"Clam? Jasper?" Ori calls out a dozen different pet names, but I don't think it's them speaking. They couldn't fit in so many places, no matter how much they twisted.

It lets me keep going until I’m about to collapse. The cat is gone. It went a lot quicker than I did, had the strength to claw what it came for out of the monster’s jaws and knew where the beast hid. I watch it race ahead, dashing through the lights that flickered on in its path to guide it.

All the lights switched back off as the cat passed them, then strobed once I stopped hearing the pattering of paws. I turned into a junction between tunnels. Any way I went, they’d just come at me from my front and from behind, from both sides. There was nothing I could do except wait for the pincer to snap. The whole world around me was yellow and black, patterns repeated and moving through a maze they knew well as they closed in on me. The bulbs' harsh brightness stepped towards me in skips, clicking to announce their advance.

They stopped in front of me. I saw a flashlight, that was a little too big, and the lightbulb behind it died and hid its shadow before I could see what was holding it.

“Okay, I’ll tip the scales a little. Does that even it out?” It spoke right in front of me. I wasn’t keeping track of what the voices sounded like anymore, but this one I think it’d used not too long ago. It sounded elegant and formal.

It waited. I couldn’t stand any longer, so I fell to my knees. I bruised them as I went down. I flexed my fingers, held the hammer, wondered if I could just smash the light. Wondered if, maybe, it cared more about its face than it did the other people in the tunnels. “I don’t want to go away.” It’s voice was frail, now, jittery. But it was determined, and more certain than ever. “But I want them to stay more.”

I heard the sound of paper shifting. Then there was a sound like a heartbeat, that was too loud and too uneven, and I heard a click. Everything was silent for a moment, and the lights were still, letting the noises echo unrestrained.

The heartbeat stopped. And the lights started flickering again, showing us the way home.

I didn’t look in the doors on the way out, but I heard them creak open behind me. Around three dozen cats, in a wide variety of ages, colors, and breeds followed us out, each one slinking after us as I heard the groaning of rusty hinges. I didn’t turn my head to watch them emerge. My Trainee trailed after me, not saying a word. When we were far enough away from the exit we couldn’t see the tunnel’s mouth anymore, she looked over her shoulder. Stood there for a bit, and I waited for her. Her good ear stood tall, like she was waiting to hear something. When she looked away, when I saw her face, I think she wished she had.

The black cat looked back, too, when we arrived at a low, squat house with a sign out front that read cat face - heart - origami swan. All the other cats went inside, one after the other, heads held low and steps tentative. They were all well-fed, with clean coats. The black cat was the last one to enter. I saw it’s head swivel towards a sound. I saw it put a foot forward, mewl low and flatten its ears, then go inside. When I turned to see what it’d been looking at, I saw a flashlight in an alley on the other side of the street click on, then off.

I’m going to look over the slips tonight. Send something. I don’t think I’ll get anything back. I called security, but I don’t know if anything will come of it. I didn’t find the other recorders. I’m tired. I’m sorry, but I think I’m going to end this here.

**Second recording begins.**

This is the… Trainee, again. When we got back, I had to help him onto the bus. His heart was too fast, then too slow, and it flickered like that until he went to sleep. The slip. I don’t think he noticed, too out of it, but they already responded. He was looking through some of his old messages, so I knew which ones to look at.

The handwriting was the same as Ori’s. Proper and elegant. It was asking for a trade. I took it down and tore it up, slowly so he wouldn’t hear. When I looked at what he’d been writing earlier, he had written their name many times, had started to draw their face. I finished it for him.

There was a folded paper bird in the box he uses to collect payment. I answered the radio while he slept. We are missing a lot of tapes now.

His heart does not sound well. The stars are bright tonight. The moon is full. I see a city on the moon, and there’s a house there just for me. I think I need to learn faster. I need to figure out how to take him with me before I hear the moon’s voice again. She’s waiting, up there. And I don’t want her to be alone, either.

I don’t want to go. I don’t-

**Recording ends.**
