So this story starts out as a typical Friday night. Me and my buds decided to go out to a bar. What’s new? I imagine this is a regular Friday night for most people and their friends. Right? Yep. Except what happened to us. 
I wouldn’t call it normal. Far from normal actually. Fucking supernatural! I know it scared me sober ever since.

I’m getting ahead of myself. Let me just start with what led up to it. My name’s Ash. My friend John and our mutual buddy Isaac. Me and John are pretty close. We knew each other since middle school. Isaac is new sorta. He’s John’s buddy from work. 

He invited Isaac to hang with us one day and we just started chilling together ever since. So when we go out to drink it’s usually the three of us. Just drinking and bullshitting. Trying to hit on the ladies at the bar. Blah blah blah. You know what I mean. 

Anyways. So we decided to try out one of the local dives we rarely use. Why? Because John was wanting to try his luck at darts and pool against us, his rivals. I mean he usually loses. Sometimes he wins. Mostly I win or Isaac does. Isaac can throw a high ton some nights and hit those corner pockets like nobody’s business. This night I was talking shit more than ever to beat both of them. 

So we all decided why not? We put our money down in a friendly competition. Best out of 3 in each game. I honestly don’t remember how things went. I remember it being pretty heated. I won. Isaac won. John won. It was close. 

When we’d win we’d get the loser, mostly John or I to take shots. Isaac was our designated driver. So instead of doing shots we’d have him foot the bill for any time he lost. 

Well…. things got wild. I think we were pretty sloshed. At least me and John. John and I all but forgot what game we were on. Isaac was basically trying his best to referee our games. The beer was flowing. Shots were had. We had a good time. All throughout though, I noticed a woman eyeing us. 

She was tall. Long blonde hair and ice cold blue eyes. Red lips. Very red. I’d almost say crimson. She was wearing black jeans. A short black leather jacket that cut off at her navel. A crop top underneath showing off her fair skinned stomach. Her boots made her seem taller than everyone else beside her. 

I remember her eyes locked onto mine when I caught her staring. I definitely remember it giving me the creeps. She had a good figure. An hourglass body if I’ve ever seen one. I tried to ignore her. Except Isaac followed my gaze and noticed her too. 

He motioned for her to join us. I remember John must’ve felt the same as I did. He got apprehensive at her joining us at our table. This all kinda killed the mood, and sobered us up a bit. If I remember correctly. 

“Do you boys mind if I join? I hope I didn’t *kill* the mood?” She said as she approached us closer. It was low and sultry, like one of those old time piano club singers. 

“Nooo no! The party just started with you here!” Isaac said excitedly 

“What’s your name? I’m Ash. This is John. And the guy with a crush on you is Isaac.” I said flippantly 

Isaac’s eyes narrowed at me. She didn’t seem to notice his quiet frustration at that. She looked at each of us in a calm and cool demeanor. As though she were a teacher looking at her new crop of students. She gave me this ‘above it all’ type of vibe. Which just further reinforced my stance on her. 

“My name’s Lilith. A pleasure to meet you all. I just got in from a long journey. Long journey’s can be *deadly* to the spirit.” She said looking at each of us as she spoke. 

John eyed me like ‘is this chick serious?’. I returned the look and gestured at Isaac. Isaac was smitten. His previous anger at me gone completely. His eyes never strayed from hers. 

“Well we’re just trying to play some pool and darts. We’re not looking for a fourth, sorry. You’re welcome to just sit and watch and drink with us if you want.” I said as tersely as I could. 

I’m never usually a dick like this to anyone. I just got bad vibes from her. So much I hoped my rudeness would turn her off of us and at least make her leave. I was wrong.

“I’m fine. I can pay for drinks for everybody if that’ll make you feel better? I don’t want to be the death of the party here. I’ll get the tab too.” She said with an icy gaze. 

“Th-thanks. That’d be well. I mean that’d be nice!” John stammered out. 

I never seen John so stiff and bothered before. Isaac continued to stare, it started to wade into creeper territory. I shrugged it off with the downing of a shot of whiskey and we continued our dart game. 

I was up to throw when I looked back and saw her. She whispered something to Isaac. It seemed to surprise him because his eyes went wide. I remember she kept that cold demeanor the whole time. Not showing interest nor showing any hint of annoyance. I threw my darts at the board. 

I remember my aim was true for once all night. I hit hat tricks the whole game, or triple bullseyes to non-dart players. I closed out the game with John right on my heels, in points. Isaac sat out that game to talk with her. Yet she never seemed to reciprocate save for that time earlier. 

Despite my victory and fresh drinks in our systems, the mood still felt stifled and anxious. Isaac seemed to be the only one enjoying himself. That woman just continued to watch. When we ordered drinks she said to put it on her tab.

In fact… I don’t think I ever seen her actually pay or give a credit card. It doesn’t matter. Right before we got done with darts, she ordered us a round of shots for everyone. Then said something that creeped me out. 

“You. Ash. You have bad manners. Although I know you’re just looking out for your friends. Be less rude to strangers less it be the death of you.” She said matter of factly while staring right into my eyes. 

I remember a shiver ran up my spine when she said ‘death of you’. I remember John went off to pull his darts out of the board. And Isaac was guzzling his beer. So I don’t think they heard. 

At the start of our pool game we were getting ready to move closer to the pool table. She stood up and looked right at John. She said something creepy just like she said to me. Except I heard and I know Isaac heard it too. 

“John. You have kind eyes. I can tell you will live long. You’re a lucky one. Most will have their luck run out and that’ll be what kills them. Keep being you. And you’ll prosper.” She said with a hint of sympathy. 

Yet the content creeped us all out. John must’ve got that same shiver because he took his beer, an almost full glass and chugged it until it was gone. He hurried off to the pool table. 

As he was racking the balls and setting the table he motioned for me to come over. So I went over and he leaned to whisper in my ear. As casually as possible. 

“Ash man. This chick’s creeping me out. All the other women are avoiding us like the plague too. Grab Isaac. Let’s head to the bathroom. We need a game plan to get Isaac out of here so we can ditch her.”

“I know what you mean man. She said something creepy like she said to you. Shits not vibing. She gives me bad vibes. I’ll grab Isaac, meet us in the bathroom.” I said in a whisper, knowing full well the bar would drown out my words to everyone else. 

I walked over to Isaac and grabbed the back of his shirt. She observed us unbothered. Her icy stare looking at John hurrying to the bathroom. 

“Hey Isaac. Cmon dude. We wanna talk follow me.” I told him to follow but more like I dragged him with me
“We’ll be right back Lilith. We wanna talk games in the bathroom. Boy stuff. Ya know.”

“Take your time. I’ll be here when you’re done. Death comes when it’s ready. I’ll see you Isaac.” She said in that creepy way. 

We made it into the men’s room. A big room with a couple stalls and a bunch of urinals. John finished pissing and walked over to us zipping himself up. I walked in with Isaac in tow. I rushed to a urinal. Not realizing how much I needed to go. 

“That bitch is crazy.” John exclaimed

“Save for the creepiness, at least she’s paying. Nothing better than free drinks.” I said nonchalant. Relieving myself. 

“What the fuck Ash. You were being a dick to her all night. You too John. I love ‘em crazy. She looks to me like a big tiddy goth dream girl.” Isaac spat out 

“Hey I wasn’t a dick. I just avoided her. She doesn’t seem to be right in her mind. Like the lights are on but no one’s home. Who talks like that!?”
John said defensively

Not having her around seemed to allow me to breathe. My usual calmness returned. I zipped myself up and turned to join the conversation. 

Washing my hands as I spoke to them 
“Her body looked too good to be true. I’m sure it’s all fake. Big tits. Big ass. Seemed fake to me.”

“I wanna tap that ass. So you guys get lost.” Isaac said sternly

“Hey man the nights still young. Seems too early to take her home now.” John said looking at Isaac

“What’d she say to you? She said something to each of us. What she tell you?” I asked questioningly to Isaac

“She just said I have a handsome face… and dead eyes.” Isaac said the last part about his eyes almost in a whisper

“See. Who the fuck talks like that!? She ain’t right.” John fired back

“Not right like her curves. She’s too perfect and those eyes are too cold.” I added

“Yeah. Exactly.” John said

“Well fuck you guys. I want to get my dick wet. She wanted me.” Isaac practically yelled 

“You’re a fucking pig Isaac.” John said with a disgusted face 

“Fuck fake girls. They aren’t worth it, man. They usually mean trouble.” I said to Isaac
“Woah, John. What’s up with your face?” I asked. 

“I don’t know? Prolly piece of windshield. Must’ve cut me when it shattered. You got one too, on your cheek.” John replied 

“Piece of windshield?” I exclaimed

We were interrupted by the bathroom door opening. 
*She* walked in without a care in the world. 

“Hey this is the men’s bathroom!” John and I said in unison

Isaac walked up to her. 
“Hey I was just about to come and see you. The guys are leaving and-“
Before he could finish his sentence a flash of steel reflected by the bathroom lights went into his chest. 

She stabbed him with a large stiletto blade. Shiny, big and long. He crumpled to the bathroom floor. A low groan escaped his throat. 

“Isaac NO!” John shouted

“Fuck wasn’t he our DD!?” I said. Which I don’t know why. It was the first thought that came to me. 

She walked over to us slowly. She left the blade in his chest. Stepping over his body. Her blonde hair changed black against the lights. 

Her clothes fell away like black mist. A long cloak as black as darkness wrapped around her. Her skin melted away from her face leaving a skull. Her piercing blue eyes gave way to hollow holes. Her hair turned and wrapped around her head like a hood. 

Despite that she still looked our way. Her hands outstretched towards us. The skin falling away revealing bony arms and spindly fingers. 

“You’re death!” I shouted. “The grim reaper!?”

We backed away from her hitting the bathroom wall. No escape. She grabbed us both by the throat. Both necks in each of her bony hands Her grasp like ice on my neck. 

*It makes sense why she was so cold. That weird way of talking. Always mentioning death or kill.* I thought 

She picked us up easily. Like we were dolls. She lifted us off the floor and tossed us behind her. We landed next to Isaac’s body. 
She turned around and pointed a long skeletal finger at both of us. 

“It’s just too bad. It isn’t either of your time’s to die. Out of respect for your luck I’ll give you a tip to live more happily.”

She leaned down to our faces. 
We couldn’t help but lift our heads up to look at her. My blood ran cold. My stomach was through the floor. The little hairs were up on the back of my neck. I could hear her in my head. Her mouth or should I say teeth, were unmoving. 

“Do not fear me. There’s no reason to. I’ve been apart of your lives since the very beginning. For I am the end. Live well, I will come in time…”

It’s all I can remember her saying. The next thing I know I’m waking up, my head pounding. My forehead was burning. My head was against the back of a seat. I looked around me. 

I was in the back seat of a car behind the driver seat. In the passenger seat sitting shotgun was John. I tried to focus and I seen John slumped against an airbag. Pieces of glass in his face. His chest heaving up and down. He was alive. 

I moved a bit to see in front of me. Isaac was gone. The air bag in the driver’s seat deployed. Yet there was a big hole in the windshield. I could feel something hot and sticky trickle down my right cheek.  

I reached up to touch it. A piece of glass was lodged there and blood was running down from the wound. I peaked to see what we hit. The car we were in was smashed into a tree. I passed out. 

I remember waking up in the hospital. The cops came and asked me questions. I told them all I remembered excluding the woman and what happened in the bathroom. I asked what happened to Isaac. They told me he died.

He was thrown from the car. He wasn’t buckled up. He landed in the ditch and was unlucky enough to land on a piece of junk metal that was there. It impaled his chest, killing him instantly, they said. 

I asked about John. They told me he was in another room. Same as me. Shook up, cut and bruised, but alive. They said we were lucky we wore seatbelts. They wanted to take us in for drinking but changed their minds after seeing Isaac. Afterwards I talked with John when we both got out of the hospital. 

I only remember that woman or death, and that twisted night. John told me what really happened. We went out for drinks and bar games. Yet, Isaac was to be our designated driver. A woman came and this made Isaac want to impress her. So he drank a few shots and some beer. 

She wasn’t at all the woman I seen. She was petite and brunette. She dressed girly-girl. She ultimately left our group. Isaac getting too creepy and handsy. So me and John decided to call it a night. 

John and I drunk and ready for home. We didn’t know how much Isaac had to drink but we assumed less than us. So we let him continue his duty of DD. We were in no shape to drive ourselves. We should’ve just got another ride instead. 

I told John this same story but he said he doesn’t remember anything like that. 
John did say he remembered a tall blonde woman, dressed in black watching as we left the bar. 

So please. Take it from me. Don’t drink and drive. Find a taxi, an Uber, Lyft whatever. Walk home. Or Death might just come for you too.
