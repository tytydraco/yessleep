It was on a normal Friday night, me and my friends had planned to go to this new club that had opened in our town. The night started out fun we had some drinks and then as we were dancing I wanted to catch my breath so I went to the counter and right next to me was this beautiful girl sitting alone having a drink, I said hi and she told me her name(let's call her Maria) we started small talk then I asked her to dance and she said yes.


As we were walking to the dance floor I held her hand and it felt cold I didn't think about it much because she was drinking cold beer and I thought it was because she was holding a cold bottle. Fast forward we danced and had fun and then she said she wanted to go home so I offered to give her a ride home as we were walking to the car our hands touched and it was cold as earlier but I didn't think about it much cause I thought she was cold and I gave my jacket to her, we chatted a little bit but she didn't tell me more about her and I just thought she was trying to be mysterious.


 We reached her home and I walked her to the front door and she kissed me and said goodbye to me as I walked back to my car. Fast forward the next day I remembered that I didn't get her number but because I wanted to see her again I just made up an excuse to go and see her and I would tell her I came to pick up my jacket although I didn't care about it rather I just wanted to get her number. I remembered the place so I just drove there and knocked on the front door, an older woman opened and I asked if Maria was home, the woman just froze and then her eyes were filled with tears, she invited me in the house and as I sat down she asked me how I knew Maria and then I told her that I met her last night, she was confused and said that she thought I was her daughter Maria's friend who didn't know that she died a year ago and I explained to her that last night I dropped off a girl by her front door and she had told me her name was Maria, the woman then went to bring a few pictures of her deceased daughter Maria and explained that she only lived there with her husband and no one else.

Looking at a picture I froze and felt all the hair on my body stand because the dead daughter of the woman looked exactly like the girl I was with last night, I started thinking to myself "this is a prank right?" I told the woman that the girl in the picture was the one I brought home last night then the woman started getting angry because she thought I was doing a sick prank to her, after I explained everything she said she wanted to show me something and we got in my car and I followed all her directions then we reached a cemetery as we were walking through the graveyard I noticed something that made me shiver, my jacket was on top of a gravestone which the mother pointed out as Maria's grave. It's been a whole month now and everyday I still think about what happened to me that night, I don't know if I am ever going to a club again.
