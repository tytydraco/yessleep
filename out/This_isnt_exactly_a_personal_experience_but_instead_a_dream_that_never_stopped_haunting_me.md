It was about 10:00 p.m where I was in Australia when I presume I fell asleep. All I know is that I put my phone down at 9:00 and couldn’t get to sleep for really long. I was only 12 at the time, and had just watched my third ever horror movie, Friday the 13th. I was a bit spooked from it, as the idea of zombies and ghosts and other paranormal activity never scared me, but psychos and thrillers always left me uneasy. But when I finally fell asleep, that resulting dream, or better described nightmare, had me waking up a few hours later drenched in a puddle of sweat. 

In the dream, I remember peeling my eyes open to find a dark, frosting chamber, almost even a dungeon. Chains hung from the walls, creaking as they swung back and forth. They varied in length, some reaching from the roof to the floor, and some only reaching a third of the way. Even in the dream, I swore I could feel the creeping frost of the cold night breeze, despite a complete lack of wind or air circulation. I soon realised that, even in the dream, I was lying down, on a metallic, flat surface, almost like a bed, but, for reasons that still confuse me to this day, I never tried to move. It wasn’t like sleep paralysis. It was different. It wasn’t that I couldn’t move, it’s that I didn’t. I simply never attempted. 

However, one thing I had failed to notice nearly the entire time, was a man, gaunt, pale, and scruffy, with greasy, long, messy black hair, and ripped, ragged beige clothing. He didn’t smile. He didn’t frown. In fact, the further I looked at his face, the less it looked like a face at all. His expression was completely blank, almost lifeless, and it left an unimaginable level of fear on me as a 12 year old. It was like an unshakable feeling of dread, like I knew there wasn’t a rational way out of this, and I simply had to sit and hope everything would pan out. So, when he brought his long, sharp fingernails to my wrist, and started dragging it back and forth across my skin, my heart sank.

I realise now that I didn’t actually feel any pain. Not physically anyway. I think that, at the time, it was nearly the gravity of the situation that made me believe I was feeling pain. I’m no psychologist, and I’m not that educated on the inner workings of the brain, but I believe that this is the most obvious solution. The nightmare went on for what felt like hours, but I’m pretty sure it lasted way less than that. He kept dragging his long, yellowed fingernail back and forth along my wrist leaving me to lay and wait for him to reach my vein. However, unfortunately story wise and fortunately me wise, it didn’t reach that point before I eventually awoke, panting heavily. I had never been so relieved in my life to realise it was all just a horrible dream, but I couldn’t go back to sleep that night, and simply ended up drinking a cup of coffee and staying up. A little ironic for the nosleep subreddit.
