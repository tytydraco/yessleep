And I was. I know my childhood memories include things both real and imagined. But my first eight years on earth –- all those Christmases, birthdays, breakfasts, dinners, walks to and from the playground, fights in the back seat of the car –- are not a product of my imagination, they are the foundation of my life.

Our family used to rent a cabin by the lake for a week every summer. My older sister and I loved going down to the shore to splash around, throw rocks, catch and release fish off the little old dock. 

&#x200B;

  
We were staying in the cabin the day of my eighth birthday, and that morning Glynis and I were sitting in the old glider swing outside, waiting for our parents. I was impatient, sighing and jiggling my knees, and then I had one of those sudden ideas that seems like an inspired revelation when you’re a little kid – we could go on ahead, without them. But when I suggested it, she just said that she didn’t remember the way.

&#x200B;

  
“I do,” I said. There was a narrow graveled path that started down through the trees behind us. It branched a few times, but basically, I remembered, you just kept going downhill. Glynis looked skeptical, but stood up. Either we would get to the lake, or we would get lost and she would be proved right. A win for her, either way. 

&#x200B;

  
I led the way confidently enough, at first, but the longer we walked through the woods, the more I started to worry. Then the trees opened up, and I knew we were in the wrong place. We were surrounded by a cluster of old houses, with peeling pink paint and sagging porches. No one was in sight except a skinny black and tan dog, that watched us from under a pickup truck parked on the grass.

&#x200B;

  
Glynis leaned down and hissed in my ear, “Nice neighborhood.”

&#x200B;

  
“Don’t be snobby,” I muttered. I was trying to decide whether to turn back, or go on. It seemed I could smell the lake, ahead of us. We could probably still get there, just taking a longer route.

&#x200B;

  
Inside one of the houses, someone was playing with a radio, the old-fashioned kind with a dial. Through an open window, we heard a bit of country music, followed by a burst of static. Then an old, dry voice intoned, “A mind that has confronted ruin for years is half or more a ruined mind.” More static, and the listener settled on a news report. Somebody had been shot. 

&#x200B;

  
To my mind, the little houses assumed an air of menace, and I decided to keep walking. Glynis hesitated, then followed, her mouth tight. The trees quickly crowded around us again, and these trees seemed older, mossier, than the fresh green live oaks and young pines that we were used to. The slow buzzing of insects surrounded us. We were still going downhill, and toward the sharp tangy smell of water, so when the path made a sharp turn I expected to see the sun sparkling on the lake ahead. Instead, it dead-ended in a hollow with hills rising all around. But there was an opening in the hillside, sheltered under a giant slab of rock. We crept forward and peered in. The smell was drifting from deep inside the cool darkness.

&#x200B;

  
“I bet smugglers use this cave!” I said. I had read some of Mom’s old Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys books, and yes, I was imaginative. Glynis rolled her eyes, but she was smiling a little. The cave seemed to intrigue her. It was something different, something we had never seen, in all our years of coming here. 

&#x200B;

  
We ducked under the stone, and stood there a moment, letting our eyes adjust to the dark. The inside seemed very big. After a moment, we could see the ground sloping down, and cautiously moved forward. 

&#x200B;

  
As you can tell, a lot of the details of that morning are sharp and clear in my memory. But once we entered the cave, things become more blurry. I remember that the buzzing sound from the forest seemed to follow us, no matter how far we went inside. It seems we walked a long time in the darkness, but I’m less sure about that. I remember Glynis grabbing my arm to stop me going forward, and then seeing just ahead a blot of deeper, thicker darkness. I thought, as she probably did, that it was a hole, that the ground fell away and we had almost blundered over the edge.

&#x200B;

  
I don’t remember the moment when I realized that it wasn’t a hole.

&#x200B;

  
I remember running, seeing the mouth of the cave as a triangle of light ahead, thinking I wasn’t going to make it. Then I was almost there, but before I reached the opening I stumbled, nearly fell. I felt a hard shove in the middle of my back that sent me staggering out into the light, to collapse on the gravel path. 

&#x200B;

  
I knelt there and sobbed for a moment, then called for Glynis. There was no answer. I kept calling, but nothing could make me go back inside. Then I heard, from far away, my Mom and Dad calling my name. I got up and ran back along the path, trying to follow their voices, thinking they would know what to do.

&#x200B;

  
I was in big trouble at the time for trying to find the lake on my own. Mom was so angry at me that she couldn’t speak. But now, she tells it as a cute story about how I once pretended so hard to have a sister that I cried when she got lost.

&#x200B;

  
But I know I made it out of that cave because Glynis pushed me the last few feet. I learned pretty quickly not to talk about her, but I think about her every day.
