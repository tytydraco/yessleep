I didn’t have time to be startled, as a familiar voice immediately accompanied the knocks, “Hey. I’m back. I stayed an extra night. I bet you loved the peace and quiet. Anything happen? You didn’t call so I’m hoping we’re all good, you gave me quite a scare.”

 

Jane… In her normal, casual, optimistic Jane voice. I wanted to be able to trust her so badly. I needed a friend right now. And she made it so easy to trust her.

 

So easy…

 

How do I talk to her… It… What could I say? I couldn’t find the words.

 

“You there?” She asked calmly.

 

“Your number… It said it was out of service.” I muttered, weakly.

 

“Really? What the hell? Are you sure you typed it in right?”

 

“Yeah I’m sure.” I couldn’t put any energy behind my voice.

 

“Are you okay? What happened?” She responded, sounding genuinely concerned.

 

“You know, don’t you?”

 

“Know what?”

 

“You’re part of it. You’re this thing.”

 

“What are you talking about? Leigh, you’re not making sense.”

 

“Is your name really Jane?”

 

“Well, yeah. Obviously. Why wouldn’t it be?”

 

“Jane Lewis?”

 

The wall fell silent for a moment.

 

“What the hell. Are you looking me up or something? That’s messed up.” Jane said, sounding shaken.

 

“Maybe I should look you up. Maybe I should. Since you’re dead.”

 

“What the f-. Leigh you’re scaring the shit out of me, okay. I think you need some help.”

 

I lost my composure again, “You’re dead! You died! Jane Lewis died so who the fuck are you and why are you doing this to me!?”

 

“I’m not dead! Why are you saying I’m dead!?” She shouted.

 

She sounded so convincing… Maybe she genuinely didn’t know she was dead. Or maybe this was another trick.

 

“Your apartment is vacant. Nobody has lived there for eight years. It’s empty. You aren’t real.”

 

I heard her laugh. That kind of exasperated laugh when you hear something so ridiculous your brain has trouble processing it. It was a very human like response.

 

“Leigh. That’s not true. I don’t know who’s telling you this shit, but it’s not true. I can assure you. I am real. I signed a lease. I have a fucking parking spot. I just went to see my sister and my nephew. We played Mario Kart and ate pizza. Pretty sure I wasn’t a ghost to them... Listen to yourself. You’re in your own head. I am real. I am your friend. At least I’m trying to be.” Her voice began to crack at the end. I could almost hear the tears welling up.

 

I couldn’t hold it in any longer. I began to cry. She was trying to pull me back to a reality I had drifted so far from. God, I wanted everything she said to be true. Across the wall I could hear a few quiet sobs. It was so… real. It had to be real.

 

“You’re really scaring me. If this is a game, please just stop. It’s sick. I’ll leave. I’ll pack my shit and I’ll leave, just please stop.”

 

My heart broke. I never wanted this. “I’m sorry… I’m so sorry Jane. I don’t know what’s happening with me. Nothing makes sense. The building manager told me all this shit and I don’t know what’s real anymore. I – I need help.”

 

I almost let it all go. I almost convinced myself that I had totally lost it and it was all in my head. It would have been so easy. All the pieces would fit together if none of it was real… But I had one more idea.

 

I have a phone. Like I said to her, maybe I should look her up. If she went missing there would be reports. All I have to do is type in her name.

 

Jane Lewis… plus the name of the city… Enter.

 

My heart sank further than I thought it could. There she was. The article came up immediately, and I saw her face for the first time… But I didn’t think she was lying, not on purpose anyway. Those tears couldn’t be fake. I refuse to believe it. She… really doesn’t know. She’s still stuck in that room… Thinking she’s alive.

 

I looked at her picture for a while… So different from the ones my mind conjured up when we spoke. But her face fit her voice and personality like a glove. It radiated positive energy. The image of her in my mind was replaced with this new one instantaneously. Something about being able to attach the voice to the face made me trust her ten times more. I knew this was really her, in some form. I wasn’t being tricked. I was certain.

 

I didn’t know if I should tell her that she was dead. A part of me thought there wouldn’t be a point. There’s no way she would believe me. But… I felt like I had to. No more secrets. I needed this all out in the open. Whatever happens.

 

“Jane…” I said hesitantly. “I looked you up. I’m looking at the article right now.”

 

“Leigh please…” she begged. I continued and began reading the article aloud.

 

“Jane Adrienne Lewis, 26. Last seen October 12th 2015, reported missing October 14th 2015, declared dead October 14th 2022. Multiple searches turned up no leads. The initial suspect, ex boyfriend Devon Aaronson whom had at the time been serving a restraining order from Jane, was exonerated. Her sister Carrie and mother Lynn continue to urge the public to come forward with any information they may have.” I recited coldly, trying not to break.

 

“Jane was loved by her family, friends, and community – and is described as a kind soul, funny, passionate, and selfless. Her entrepreneurial spirit led her to start up multiple small businesses, dating all the way back to eight years old when she would make and sell beaded bracelets and homemade baked goods to her classmates. Her mother, Lynn, quotes-“ I stopped myself. This was a lot to throw at her, and I think she got the point.

 

She was silent for a minute, and then she spoke “October 12th 2015.”

 

“Yes. Eight years ago, last month. That was the last time you were seen.”

 

“Eight years ago…”

 

“Yeah.”

 

“October 12th 2015 is today.” She said. “You’re telling me I go missing today.”

 

Everything turned upside down once again… I stammered; words struggled to form. She was living out her final days all over again somehow…

 

“Nobody remembers the stupid bracelets... Only my mom remembers that shit.” She continued.

 

“I’m sorry.”

 

“It’s not true. You’re sick. You’ve been stalking me. Gathering all this information, what the fuck do you want??” She screamed.

 

“There’s a video… Can I play it for you?”

 

She went silent. I took that as a yes. I turned the volume up, held the phone to the wall, and hit play on the embedded video. An older woman and a younger woman stood together in front of microphones on the front lawn of a small house. I could only assume her mom and her sister. She wouldn’t accept it from me, maybe she would accept it from them.

 

Her mom didn’t get through two sentences before I heard the most horrific sound I had ever heard coming from the other side of the wall. It sounded like all the air was sucked out of her while at the same time she screamed and wailed. It was like the scream I heard the day before. All she could say was “No.” over and over again. I heard her rocking back and forth on the bed.

 

It hit. She believed.

 

“I’m sorry!” I cried. But all I could do was wait and listen to her violent sobbing. Her awful cries. I couldn’t imagine what she must be going through.

 

After a few minutes the crying stopped and she spoke through her sniffles, “Read me more. There has to be more.”

 

I obliged and continued skimming the article. The words “an early prominent lead” jumped out at me and I read the paragraph out loud.

 

“Jane’s older sister told police about conversations the two had the day prior to her disappearance. Jane talked about making friends with a neighbor named Lee…” I paused. The last thing I expected was my name to appear in this, albeit spelled wrong. My heart began to pound, and I continued.

 

“…Whom she claimed she could hear through the unit’s wall. However, when police searched, they found nobody by that name living in the building and weren’t able to find any evidence of this mysterious Lee.”

 

“What the fuck?” Jane said, echoing my sentiments.

 

“You’re… You’re alive. I’m really talking to YOU, eight years ago.” I surmised. It was the only way that could make sense.

 

“I’ve been trying to tell you I’m fucking alive!”

 

“Wait… Maybe that means I can help you. You’re supposed to die today… But maybe I can save you.”

 

“Okay, how?”

 

I thought about it for a second and the most obvious answer popped into my mind. “Get out. Get out of the room. Now. It’s in the room. You have to leave.”

 

“What do you mean it’s in the room?”

 

“It’s 402. Something bad is in 402. I hear it at night. You have to go, right now. Stay with your sister.”

 

“Okay… Okay I’m going.” She said frantically. I heard the bed shift as she began making her way off, then I heard something else.

 

“WAIT.” I shouted. “Don’t move.”

 

“What? Why?”

 

“Don’t step off the bed. Stay on the bed.”

 

“Why!?”

 

“…It’s breathing. I can hear it. It’s under your bed.” I softened my voice to a whisper. Even though I didn’t think it would do any good.

 

“…I can’t hear anything.”

 

“It’s there. It’s waiting. Don’t step your foot off.”

 

“What do I do?”

 

“I don’t know. I don’t know. Just wait.”

 

“I don’t want to die.”

 

“You won’t! We’ll figure this out.” I paced around the apartment, frantically trying to put the pieces together to try and find some answer. Some way I could save her. Then something struck me… “I don’t want to die.” she said that to me last night. When she wasn’t here. It was the same words, said in the same way. Like her scream was the same scream. It wasn’t this thing mimicking her, it was HER.

 

“I heard you when you weren’t here. How did I hear you when you weren’t here? How did I hear you say something before you said it?” I asked, in desperate confusion.

 

“I don’t know… I don’t know…” She repeated.

 

“You said those exact words before… The exact same way… It was you… I thought maybe it was using your voice, but it was you, now. I… I don’t understand. I don’t know, Jane. I’m sorry. I don’t know what to do. This doesn’t make any sense.”

 

“Time…” she said, in a softer voice.

 

“What?”

 

“I read this book a little while ago… It was a poetry book.” It sounded like she was just talking to calm herself down. Saying anything, thinking about anything, just going back to a happy place. Anything to cope. It seemed like something she had to learn how to do. I let her continue while I searched my own mind for answers.

 

“One of the poems was about time. About how life is a cup and time is water being slowly poured into the cup. I can’t remember exactly how it went, but the stream of water is your present, and it all collects and fills up to become your past.” She said. I heard her lay back on her bed. I pictured her staring at the ceiling. Fingers interlocked. Scared out of her mind but trying her best to talk her way out of it.

 

“I never heard that one.” I replied.

 

“It always feels like we’re going somewhere because we’re in the middle of the pour. But when you look at the past, it’s all in the same place. You can take a sip from any of it. I always liked that analogy for some reason. Maybe when we see ghosts it’s just time spilling. Out of their glass, out into the world for all to see. Maybe that’s why we see them most at night. It’s easy to spill things when it’s dark…”

 

Her voice slowly grew calmer. I listened, fearing deep down that this might be the last time I hear it.

 

She kept going, “I don’t think I spilled. Maybe a little bit, in the dark; maybe that’s what you were hearing. But I think I poured my time out. To you. I mixed up our glasses. Because I needed to.”

 

Maybe she was right. There’s no way of knowing, but it is a nice thought. We mixed our time. I pictured a plain milkshake in a blender, but with a little chocolate swirl cascading into the center.

 

“Or maybe I just threw my whole glass at the fucking wall.” She said, chuckling faintly. I smiled. That would do it.

 

“The thing in that room… Maybe it spilled too. Spilled over here from some place else.” I surmised.

 

The wall went silent. It was silent for a long time. Too long.

 

Then the creak. The creak I had become so familiar with. She sat up...

 

“Jane!” I shouted.

 

“I see it.” Her breath was shaky. Her words were weak. “It’s with me now.”

 

“Get out of there! Run! Just run!” I shouted.

 

“I can’t… I can’t move… Please help me, Leigh. Please.” She begged.

 

I couldn’t take any more. I couldn’t think any more. I took the keys Mike gave me, I grabbed a big kitchen knife, and I stormed out of the apartment as fast as I could. I didn’t know what I would do or what I could do. I just had to get to her.

 

Without hesitation, I plunged the key into the lock of 402 and burst through the door, letting it slowly close behind me. My heart was pounding out of my chest. I took in what I saw in the brief moments when the room was illuminated by the hallway light, and it was everything Mike said it was. Empty. Completely empty. Unkempt and unclean. The dust was thick. There was absolutely no mistaking the fact that this place was abandoned. Now though, with the door closed, all of those details were replaced by a thick blanket of darkness. So dark. Darker than my apartment ever was. I tried the lights and they didn’t come on.

 

“Jane!” I shouted again as I walked further into the blackness, but there was no response. She wasn’t here… But she was. She was on her bed, helpless, staring at something that was about to kill her. That was happening 8 years ago but it was happening right now. I just couldn’t see it. There isn’t even a bed here anymore. I stood right where it should be and there was nothing.

 

“Please answer me Jane!” I should be able to hear her, I thought. I tried to even just feel her presence somehow, but I couldn’t feel anything except dread. Was I too late? I called out to her again and again. Nothing. I turned my attention to her tormenter.

 

“Leave her alone! What are you!? Show yourself!” What the fuck was I saying? The adrenaline was too high, I didn’t even fully realise the scope of the shit I was in, but it was beginning to dawn on me. This thing… It killed Jane. It torments people. It “carves them up.” And I just walked right into its mouth.

 

I liked Jane’s theory about time, but maybe it was this thing that did it. It mixed up our time, it put us together, to lure me over here. 8 years without a victim and it was starving. It knew we would connect; it knew I would come to save her. It got me right where it wanted me.

 

In my adrenaline-fueled haze, I walked far away from the door without even realizing it. I was on the other side of the room. I could make a run for it, but I froze. The soundproofing panels were gone, but the place was just as silent. The intense dark made my vision fuzzy and grainy. Dark spots and subtle shapes manifested and dissipated, tricking my eyes. I tried to scan the room. All I could really make out was some of the basic geometry. The only light was an inch tall line coming from under the front door.

 

It could be hiding in any one of these pitch black corners. Standing there, watching me hyperventilate. There was a sliding closet door next to the front door. Very slightly open. Mike said something about people seeing it in the closet. I could imagine its eye peeking out. Maybe that’s where it hid in the daytime, watching Jane, and listening to us.

 

Something moved above me. I looked to the ceiling but saw only black. It could be up there too. Sprawled out on the ceiling like some kind of spider, looking down at me, waiting to pounce. I wouldn’t know.

 

More movement in the far corners of my periphery. I turned to face it out of instinct, and was again met with the void. I wanted to think it was all a trick of my eyes, but I knew better.

 

I told my body to run. It was time to run. My body didn’t want to move, but I had no choice. I couldn’t stay here. As much as it killed me, I was quickly realizing there was no saving Jane. There never was. I was still as powerless as I had been this entire time. So I had to go. Now.

 

Then I heard it. Creak. The floorboard, right in front of the door I was so anxious to get to. I turned and looked towards the door and… I saw it… The line of light under the door was now broken by two dark pillars… It was standing right there.

 

It was too dark to make out any other features, or maybe it didn’t have any. All I could make out was a shadow amongst the shadows. The vaguest confirmation of a form.

 

My legs fell out from under me and I came down hard. I kicked my feet and crawled back against the furthest corner. I didn’t take my eyes off of it. I didn’t dare to even blink.

 

It didn’t move. After  moment the floorboards began to creak subtly again… and again. But it still wasn’t moving. It sounded like it was only slightly shifting its weight from one foot to the other and back again. It was… swaying.

 

I really was trapped now. It wasn’t going to let me get to the door. I put my hands on the wall behind me to help me push myself back up. One of my hands touched something wet.

 

The wall was damp, and squishy. Instinctually I looked to see what I was touching, and my eyes were able to adjust enough to make out that it was mold. A ton of mold, coating several feet of the wall. I recoiled in disgust, but it quickly all started to add up.

 

This mold was exactly where the mold in my apartment was. It was the same mold, on both sides…  The guys who replaced my drywall, they never looked on the other side… But now that I thought about it, the day after they opened my wall was the day this all started. Opening the wall opened the threshold, that’s how it must have found me.

 

These revelations ripped through my mind within a few seconds, but the ultimate realization was that I took my eyes off of it. I quickly turned back.

 

The line of light was unbroken again. It moved. It could be anywhere now. It was toying with me like it toyed with all the others.

 

I began to feel my feet go numb. Just like how Jane’s did. I couldn’t make a run for it anymore. This was it, it was coming for me.

 

In my desperation, I took my knife and jammed it into the moldy wall. It slid in, so I stabbed it again and again and again, then I dropped the knife and forced my hands inside. Pulling and ripping and tearing at the decay. Some parts tore away easy, others were still rough and hard.

 

Amidst the crumbling and the squishing sounds of the wall being pulled apart and the sounds of my own struggling, the creaks began again. Coming closer now.

 

The tips of my fingers screamed in pain, my fingernails bent and broke as drywall lodged itself behind them, but I continued tearing at it with everything I had. It felt like I had an extra pair of hands. The creaks got closer; the numbness crept up my legs. The breathing I heard time and time again I could now feel on the back of my neck. Then… that awful sound of teeth chattering inches away from my ear.

 

Eventually, the hole was big enough for me to crawl into, and I hoisted myself inside with every bit of strength I had left. My body barely fit between the drywall and the solid concrete, I squeezed in as best as I could. I knew this wasn’t an escape. This was just the only thing I could do. Maybe this would be far enough outside of its physical domain. Sound could travel past the wall but maybe it couldn’t. It was a stretch but it’s all I had.

 

It was pitch black in here. I couldn’t even see myself. I was at the whim of the warbling fuzz of my own retinas… It stopped moving but it continued to breathe, right next to my ear. Maybe I was right and it couldn’t get inside.

 

Time passed… The breathing faded. My heart rate began to slow and the intense pain in my hands crept to the surface. I didn’t know how long it had been but it felt like ages. At this point I was waiting for the sun to come up, but instead it stayed pitch black.

 

I finally decided to take a peek outside of the hole just to see a glimpse of that line of light again. I reached my hand toward the edge of the hole to pull myself towards it but… I couldn’t find it. I ran my hand along the whole surface… I couldn’t find the hole. It was gone. It was like it was never there. The wall was perfectly smooth and solid.

 

I began to hyperventilate again. Then I began to scream. I screamed for help until my throat went coarse. I hit the wall as hard as I could over and over and it wouldn’t budge. I couldn’t see the blood but I felt it trickle down my knuckles. I managed to dislodge a wooden stud but that offered no help.

 

I fought until I had no more fight left in me. Then I sat back, staring into the blackness once again - defeated. Only there was something different this time. I could only describe it as something darker than pitch black. A little fuzzy orb of it, floating past the wooden stud that I broke off. I pulled myself closer and my eyes very slowly began to adjust.

 

It wasn’t an orb, I began to discover. It was three orbs, arranged in an inverted triangle. I pulled myself closer again... No, not orbs, they were holes. I couldn’t fully make it out until I was a mere foot away from it, then I gasped in horror. A face. Sunken black holes for the eyes and mouth. Withered and shrouded in a veil of cobwebs. I could barely make out the rest of the body. Slumped over and sitting like I was, decayed to bones.

 

There she was. The veiled woman… But not just the veiled woman… It was Jane… She was here all this time. It probably tricked her into the wall the same way it tricked me. Tears welled up immediately and turned to frantic sobs.

 

“No, Jane… Please, no. I thought I could save you. Please don’t be gone.” I knew she was dead, but actually seeing her like this broke me beyond repair. It sunk in now. That last glimmer of hope I had was gone. My friend is dead, and she died afraid.

 

“You can’t be gone. Tell me one of your jokes. You’re supposed to tell me them every day. You can’t miss a day. You have to. Please.”

 

I was hysterical. Thinking about her scared and alone and trapped for god knows how long. Never being found. It shattered me over and over. I couldn’t save her… I couldn’t reassure her… I couldn’t make things better… I couldn’t say goodbye… I couldn’t even bring her or her family closure because I will die in this place too and neither of us will ever be found.

 

“I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Give me more time. Spill me more time. Just a little more.” I begged. But nothing happened.

 

The next few hours were agony. Staring at the empty, decomposed husk of the girl I failed. Replaying every single decision I made. Thinking about how I could have done it differently. I was always too late. Always one step behind. Too scared. Too uncertain. I always knew I was like this, I always have been, but I didn’t think it mattered. I figured the only life I could ruin was my own.

 

I began doing our knocks on the wall. Over and over. Hoping maybe she would hear it, somewhere, sometime. Maybe it would reach her at a time when she needed to know someone was still with her. That’s probably not how it worked but it’s all I had left.

 

I was hungry. Dehydrated. My lips were sticking together. My vision got even spottier. Occasionally I would sleep, as much as I could. I tried to move my arms and my body every now and then to stop them from becoming completely stiff, but they hurt like hell. Two days passed. I continued knocking.

 

I was in a haze when I saw an axe crash through the wall. Bringing with it a beam of blinding light. It crashed through several more times. The light scorched my eyes. I heard a voice, and yelling, but I couldn’t discern it. Before long I was being pulled out of the wall. The pain in my muscles was unbearable.

 

My eyes wouldn’t focus, and my brain wouldn’t unscramble, but I could think just enough to repeat “Jane is in there” as I was dragged away, before I completely lost consciousness.

 

I awoke in a hospital room. Once again blinded by all the light, but my eyes eventually focused on Mike. He told me he regretted giving me the key to 402 and came to check on me, when he saw the key still in the lock. That’s when he heard me knocking, and he got me out. I told him I was grateful, and that I was sorry.

 

The police and the paramedics came and collected Jane’ body. Mike told me what story to use to explain what happened. Say I heard some rats and took it upon myself to set traps in the wall when I got stuck and found Jane. It worked well enough for them.

 

I got fired for missing work which made me laugh, and it goes without saying that I had to find a new place to live. I went back to my apartment after I got discharged, gathered everything I could in about 20 minutes, and left. Right before I shut the door, I knocked twice on the wall one more time. Just because.

 

Jane’ sister reached out to say thank you on behalf of her and her family. I wish I could tell them more, but there was no way. All I could do was wish them the best. I believe they’re trying to sue Mike for criminal negligence.

 

I struggled to find a new place and a new job. I got fired a few times for being too inattentive or slow. I wasn’t sleeping or eating. I had panic attacks and night terrors. I couldn’t bear the dark, or the quiet... The things I saw I couldn’t escape; but beyond the fear and the trauma, it was the guilt that was the worst. I saw her face everywhere. Her dead face haunted me while I slept, and her living face haunted me while I was awake. Neither face would ever forgive me.

 

I didn’t have enough money to drink away the sorrow. I was forced to face it all, every day. Dating was off the table, I wouldn’t subject someone else to me in the state I was in. I thought long and hard about giving up in those next few months. I got closer and closer to making that decision. I started stockpiling prescription pills and drafting final letters. I only felt more and more ready as the days passed. But, on the day I chose, and the time I chose… I heard two knocks on my wall.
