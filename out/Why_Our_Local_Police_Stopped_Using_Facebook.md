Who the Fuck is Mark Hamilition?

It only took a second for me to get distracted and then sucked into the social media blackhole. Like why am I watching an obviously staged prank video, commenting on “friend”’s post I haven’t since high school, and cringing at memes that my Mom wouldn’t find funny?

Worse of all, Mark fucking Hamilition. I don’t know who he is but he took my profile picture and added me as a friend.

It's annoying, because it’s so blatant and his account is filled with fake crypto phishing links.

I can't worry about this right now. I have to get back to work.

For those of you worried about him seeing my posts,  Why?

What is he gonna do?  Even so I already have him blocked.

It’s just annoying, and I don’t want my younger nephews clicking on those links and then getting doxxed or some shit. Though those of you who gave constructive advice, thank you but I don’t think Lizard man is gonna do anything.

So get this

\[Picture Redacted\]

How is he messaging me? He’s blocked. Facebook is really good for nothing.

He just keeps sending gibberish. I'm going to have to uninstall the app if this doesn’t stop soon.

Facebook fix your shit.

It just keeps on beeping every five minutes with a new message. 

I even muted my phone but it didn't stop. 

I'm about to smash my head into my desk. Does anyone know how to fix this? I tried reinstalling messenger but didn't do anything. I would rather not uninstall completely because my family talks to me on here but looks like I don’t have many options.

Fuck off Mark.

I don’t know if anyone will see this post.

My entire timeline is buried in his gibberish posts. He is posting faster than I can delete them so if you see this please message me on Twitter or if you have my number call me and tell me how to fix it.

Have I been hacked? I didn’t click on anything.

I’m not sure what to do.

I got a call from my home security company. A group of people broke into my home by kicking in the front door. 

Didn’t appear to take anything, he just opened every door looking for something. They even checked under my bed and in a few minutes just walked right out like nothing happened. I saw them but it was really blurry but only on their faces.

I don’t understand how that’s possible but I think I should go home.

I filed a police report.

I am going to a friend’s house, I’m wary about saying who for obvious reasons. I fear that I'm being targeted though the police don’t think so.

Fuck fuck fuck!. My car just stopped in the middle of the road. Headlights won’t even work, and no call is going through. I reinstalled messenger and managed to call and text my friend but he hasn’t answered.

I’m terrified. I’m messaging everyone I know in person but I can’t calm down.

I can’t see shit outside.

I’m double checking every lock and bunkering down till someone answers
