I started my YouTube channel after I lost my job.  

I worked in customer service for a big telecom company. Basically, I was a human punching bag for people with bad reception and even worse tempers. But the worst part wasn’t the angry customers—it was knowing they were right. The company was overpriced garbage. They didn’t care about their clients. So one day, I told a customer to switch to the competition.  

The call was recorded for "training purposes." A week later, my keycard didn’t work anymore. Of course, I knew the call was recorded. I just didn’t want the job anymore.

And then came the free time. A lot of it. For most people, that would be a dream. But for me, the emptiness just ate me alive. After two weeks, I was ready to call my boss and beg for my old job back. And I would have—if I hadn’t run into an old school friend at the supermarket.  

Tom had been the quiet, nerdy type in school. But the guy I met in the parking lot was nothing like the kid I remembered. He was tall, well-dressed, and carried himself with an easy confidence. He had that kind of energy people talk about when they say someone has "found their center"—whatever that’s supposed to mean. We started talking. He told me he was a YouTuber. A content creator. He had a channel about car tuning, one about baseball, and his biggest success was a channel where he posted bodycam footage from police operations.  

"You make a living from that?" I asked.  Turns out, he not only made enough money, but he also enjoyed his work. Maybe that’s why he had such a positive vibe. He liked going to work in the morning. He didn’t hate his boss. He didn’t have annoying coworkers to avoid.

He gave me his number and told me I should try YouTube too. It takes time to build a community and start making money, but he said it was worth it.  

"And what should I make videos about?"  

"Well… the thing you love the most."  

I drove home and thought about it. What do I love the most? I don’t know much about cars. I don’t care about sports. And watching cops beat up innocent people doesn’t seem all that interesting to me.  The only thing that came to mind was: cleaning.



I don’t love the end result of cleaning—the order itself—but the process. Watching something wild and chaotic slowly fade away, replaced by calm and structure, fills me with a deep sense of peace. The emptiness disappears, and for a moment, my existence in this world doesn’t feel so meaningless.  Cleaning was the only thing that made my unemployment bearable. I spent the first half of the day turning my apartment into a complete mess—just so I could enjoy cleaning it up in the second half. That was my drug.

So I started filming myself while cleaning my apartment. I uploaded the videos, and then… nothing happened. Just like Tom had predicted—at first, no one cares. But that didn’t bother me. The views didn’t matter because I still got that same rush from cleaning.  Then everything changed. My first viral hit.   When I take the bus to the supermarket, the route passes by a cemetery. One day, I glanced over the small stone wall and noticed an old, completely abandoned grave. The foundation had sunk, and the weed-covered slab was tilted into the earth. The headstone was covered in moss and dirt, the inscription long unreadable.  

The next day, I went to the cemetery groundskeeper and asked who was buried there. He checked his records but couldn’t give me a name.  “All I can see in my system is that the burial rights expired in 1987. The family never renewed them.”

"So that means no one takes care of the grave?" I asked.  

The groundskeeper nodded. "Technically, we could dissolve it. But since modern burials are becoming more minimalist and space-efficient, we don’t really need the extra room."  

I asked if I could take care of the grave. He looked at me with a mix of suspicion and curiosity.  I pulled out my phone, showed him my YouTube channel, and tried to convince him that I wasn’t crazy.

"The relatives haven’t shown up in 40 years," he said, scratching his head. "I don’t think they’ll show up now and have a problem with it."

I set up my camera tripod on the small gravel path and got to work. Around me were either old gravestones or open graves, so I had peace. First, I trimmed the wild hydrangea bush, its branches hanging over the gravestone, and pulled out the weeds from the ground. I got some soil from the garden center and filled the gap under the grave slab to level it out. The next day, I worked on the slab and the headstone. I first used a wooden spade to remove the moss and dirt, then scrubbed the sandstone with pH-neutral soap. After the third round, the headstone regained its original color: lava gray.

Once that was done, I cleaned the inscriptions, ornaments, and engravings with a toothbrush until they were legible. Beneath the name and the birth and death dates was a line: "Forget me not, or I won’t forget you." I thought about that last line a lot while I packed up my stuff and took down the tripod—why would someone have something like that carved on their gravestone? Was it a threat? Or was she known for her sense of humor, and maybe it was her way of leaving a parting gift for the world?

I drove home, worked on the video late into the night, uploaded it, and went to sleep. That night, I slept badly and had a strange nightmare: I was trapped in some kind of steel oven, surrounded by naked people with animal heads instead of their own. Then the fire appeared under the oven, and we were all baked alive. The half-human, half-animal creatures screamed, trying to push themselves up, away from the flames. I had no chance and was pressed down toward the fire. Even though it was just a dream, I felt the pain and fear. I was pushed against the hot floor, and the smell of my burning skin filled my nose, followed by blinding pain and desperate screams.

When I woke up, my chest hurt and felt burned, even though there were no signs of injury. The feeling went away, especially when I checked my YouTube account. The cemetery video had gone viral overnight. It had been online for less than six hours and already had 109,876 views, and my subscribers jumped to 2,318. The numbers kept growing throughout the day, and by evening, 876,909 people had watched the video and were discussing it. While some thought it was nice that someone had finally taken care of the grave, others felt I had disturbed the privacy and peace of the grave—just for clicks.

Less than 24 hours after I uploaded the video, I hit the magic mark of 1 million views. And with the success came the first collaboration requests from companies that made cleaning products and cleaning tools. Tom also reached out and congratulated me on the success—he said it would’ve taken him over a year to hit a million. Apparently, I was some kind of natural talent. He also wanted to collaborate with me.

A noise woke me up that night. I tried to get up and check, but suddenly, I couldn’t move my body. I screamed with all my strength, but no sound came out. The more I fought it, the weaker I became. Then I saw a shadow, the silhouette of a woman, as she entered the room and leaned over me. I fell into a dark hole. I lost all will to live. Everything bad and evil that had happened to me in my life suddenly came back to me. It was like sitting in an empty movie theater, watching the worst moments of my life on the huge screen. The tragic death of my parents, the child who only lived until the second trimester, the failed marriage, the drug addiction. I saw it all so clearly: I was worthless and deserved to die. Yes, it was my duty to throw myself out the window right now or slit my throat with a knife.

The loud knocking at the door woke me from my sleep. It had been a strange and terrifyingly realistic dream. Do you know that feeling of relief when you realize it was all just a dream, and you’re safe? That feeling didn’t come to me. I still felt miserable as I opened the door with a heavy heart, the words on the gravestone echoing in my mind: "Forget me not, or I won’t forget you."

Two police officers stood at the door and wanted to speak with me. One of them showed me the cemetery video on his phone and asked if that was me.  

"Yes," I said, rubbing my face, "but I had the gardener’s permission."  

"And you were just taking care of the grave?"  

„Yes."

"Is that all you did?"  

"Listen, what's the problem? Should I delete the video or what?"  

The officers exchanged a brief glance.  

"We’ve received a report of grave desecration."  

"Grave desecration? You’ve seen the video, right? If anything, it was a grave upgrade."  

"Someone opened the grave last night and stole the remains."  

He handed me his phone, showing crime scene photos. And sure enough, the grave slab had been moved aside and a deep hole had been dug.  

"Who did this?"  

"We're trying to find that out. The grave has been there for 90 years with no incidents. And right after you make a video about it, something happens. Don’t you think that’s a bit strange?"  

"A coincidence..." I mumbled to myself, thinking of the nightmare.  

"We were taught at the police academy not to believe in coincidences. There’s always a causal link. And we’ll find it."  

The officer stood up and paused for a moment.  

"Can I use your bathroom?"  

"Second door on the left.“

He went into the bathroom, and I walked with the other cop down the hall, when suddenly his partner appeared. I couldn’t quite read his look. It was a mix of awe and satisfaction.  

"I told you, we always find a connection," there was satisfaction in his voice.  

He gestured toward my bathroom. And in the bathtub lay the reason for the awe in his tone. The entire bathroom was filled with black soil, and in the tub were the bones from the grave, covered in dirt and brittle with age.  

I tried to explain to the officers that I had no idea how the bones ended up in my apartment, but of course, they didn’t believe me. I was arrested and spent the night in a cell. As they led me away in handcuffs, I couldn’t stop thinking about the words I had read on the gravestone: *"Forget me not, or I won’t forget you.“* He went into the bathroom, and I walked with the other cop down the hall, when suddenly his partner appeared.

They removed the bones from my apartment and reburied the remains. I was charged with disturbing the peace of the dead, grave desecration, and theft. The incident went public, and the media spun their own version of the story: I had cleaned the grave only to desecrate it afterward. A well-known influencer took the story further, claiming my goal was to turn it into a "ghost story" for my channel to gain more views. Other YouTubers jumped on the bandwagon, and it turned into a full-blown witch hunt against me. Videos about me and my "satanic acts" brought in good views, and even Tom made a video, claiming that during our meeting in the parking lot, I had allegedly talked about doing something "forbidden" for one of my videos.

The cemetery video hit nearly two million views before YouTube took it down and banned me from the platform. All the sponsorship requests were canceled, and Tom stopped reaching out. Since then, I dreamed the same dream every night. Every time, I burned in the oven, along with the people with animal heads. So, I slept less, which led my mind to play tricks on me. Over and over, I saw a shadow, the silhouette of a woman, wandering around my apartment.

*"Forget me not, or I won’t forget you.“*

It was all connected to her grave. So, I started to dig deeper. First on the internet, then at the city archive. I found nothing about her childhood or youth. Only a few newspaper clippings and excerpts from a book called "The Black Cult.\* The book mentioned her name in connection with a group of occultists who had been experimenting with dark magic. In another article, there were reports of several deaths, supposedly linked to a curse she had placed on the victims.

*"Forget me not, or I won’t forget you."*

And the darkness came into my life, too. I couldn’t get a job anymore because the whole country knew me as the "Clickbait Grave Desecrator."\*I couldn’t pay my rent and had to leave my apartment. I had no one to turn to. No family. No friends. I was completely alone.  

*"Forget me not, or I won’t forget you."*  

For a week now, I’ve been living in a homeless shelter, and even here, misfortune follows me. Yesterday, I got into a fight with a heroin junkie who stabbed me in the stomach with a box cutter. The wound got infected, and the sharp pain spreads through my body in a slow, burning circle.  

*"Forget me not, or I won’t forget you."*   


I curl up in my sleeping bag and get ready to dream of the oven and the people with animal heads. Every night, I burn again and wake up with invisible burns on my skin.  

***"Forget me not, or I won’t forget you."***
