I live alone in the countryside. Someone has been watching my house.

I thought having four dogs would make me feel safer. Usually it does.
Atlas and Kora, my two Anatolian shepherds, bark at anything that moves.
Milo, my black lab, is basically a walking alarm system.
Scout, my border collie, notices things before *I* do.

Last night, all four of them were quiet.

That’s what scared me first.

I went to bed around midnight after locking every door, including the garage door—I always double check it. It’s old and heavy, and if you don’t slam it hard the latch sticks. I slammed it. I tested it. It was locked.

Around 3AM, I jolted awake because Atlas let out a single sharp bark, the kind he does when someone steps on the property. Not an animal—he knows the difference.

Then silence.

I lay there listening to my own breathing, when something in the corner of my eye moved. Not dramatically—just a shape shifting in the hallway, a dark blur passing by the doorway. I thought maybe Scout sneaked out of his crate.

But when I sat up, all four dogs were staring at the hallway too.

Not barking.
Not growling.
Just… waiting.

I got out of bed and crept down the hall. Nothing was there. But every few steps, I’d catch another flicker in my peripheral vision—like someone stepping just out of sight every time I turned.

My heart wasn’t pounding yet. It was slowing down, which somehow felt worse.

When I reached the end of the hallway, Milo nudged my hand hard, whining at the back door. I figured he needed to go out, so I opened it a crack and froze.

The garage door was wide open.

I swear to God, I locked it. And no wind is strong enough to drag that thing up the tracks. It looked like someone had lifted it from the outside—just enough to slip under—and then let it roll up.

Atlas bolted outside before I could stop him, barking like he was chasing something. Kora lunged after him. Milo stayed glued to my leg. Scout stood in the doorway, staring into the darkness like he was tracking someone I couldn’t see.

I grabbed a flashlight and followed the shepherds halfway across the yard, but they stopped abruptly, staring toward the tree line. Not barking anymore. Not moving. Just staring.

I didn’t see anyone.
But I kept getting those flickers at the edges of my vision—the same shifting shadows, just at the line where my flashlight beam ended.

I herded the dogs back inside and slammed the back door shut. When I checked the garage, nothing looked disturbed. Nothing missing. But the latch on the inside had been bent slightly outward, like someone forced it.

The dogs didn’t leave my side all night. Even Atlas slept by my bedroom door.

This morning, I took a picture of the garage door to send to a friend. I didn’t notice it until afterward:

In the corner of the picture, right by the edge of the frame, there’s a shape.
A silhouette.
Low to the ground.
Just tall enough to be a crouched person.

Could be a shadow. Could be nothing.

But the dogs saw something before I did.

And the garage door didn’t open itself.

I’m not calling the police yet. I will if it happens again.

And something in my gut is telling me it will.

(If anyone wants an update… I’ll post again. I don’t think last night was the end of this.)
