This was in summer of 2021, as coronavirus rules in USA was less strict about traveling. I was 16(M), having finished 10th grade, and a couple weeks away from moving back to Europe due to unrelated reasons to this story. To celebrate our severed ties due to us moving to different places, countries, and even continents, my friends and I decided to have a small party in one of my friend’s house in the weekend, and a camping trip of 2 days total (1 to go and stay, 1 to leave) in a national park out of NYC. 

Not wanting to give much detail on the party, I can say that it ended at midnight, and that all of us were tired from partying with school friends, so we all left around the same time not wanting to miss the camping trip. We all had bought a huge tent, although mine was big enough to fit everyone. We all got some food and I personally learned some tricks for the camping trip thanks to my father. Safe to say, didn’t know what to expect that day.

When the morning came, I was ready: packing everything in my dad’s backpack I borrowed, with food and candy in a plastic bag, as well as my phone and 2 battery packs. Leaving early, I went to my friends house 3 blocks away from me, where all the details were given by my friend’s Sister: Ken, Matt, Nick and I were the ones participating in the camping trip, the one who would chaperone us and drive is my friend Nick’s sister, since she had a car. She would have her baby with us during the trip since my friend’s mom couldn’t keep the baby with her, and she told us where we would go and how long we would stay there. Having given all the details, we got in the car, took a pic for our parents, and we left.

Stopping once for lunch, and once more for directions, we arrived at the national park in 6 hours. Searching for a place to set up whilst also seeking a park ranger, we drove inside looking. The first weird oddity in the park was some building not too far from us: a giant hole in the ground with clothes, metal, ash, and other things, a stone fireplace, a car with nobody around it, and a clock on the fireplace that didn’t work. This place gave us weird vibes, so my friends and I called it “the clock” hoping we didn’t set near it. After that we just parked somewhere and started taking stuff out.

As we left the car I drowned my legs and arms in anti tick spray, as it was tick season and they were all over the park, so I made sure not to be bit. We walked for 30 minutes or so searching for a spot, helping the baby walk. There were good spots, although most were too vulnerable to fire, too far, or even too small for all our tents, but we found a big stick so we played with that. Finally, the sister comes back, having talked to a park ranger who gave her an area to stay, so we followed her. 

Blocked by trees, and very high grass vulnerable to ticks, I was skeptical and scared straight already, since I clearly did not want ticks the most out of everyone in the group. Jumping over the tick filled grass, we took all our stuff and set it up. I put everything in my tent, closed it, and left to find big flat rocks. A couple rocks and fire starters later, we had a fire, and we were cooking up pre heated Costco sausages and marshmallows, making hotdogs and melted marshmallows. The whole time we kept laughing, joking around the five of us, excluding the baby, taking a pic to remember, and even imagining what we would find, but nothing really happened like we thought.

Around 10pm, our fire diminished lightly, and we were full, so we just started talking about our lives and our future, joking sometimes, twirling our sticks filled with marshmallow. Minutes passed before we heard some kind of vehicle, maybe multiple, driving inside the park, but we didn’t notice it, at least none of us except my friend Nick, who was always analyzing the area. A bit later, and that’s when things got a bit creepy, a sound emerged. I can’t really describe the sound, but some form of really loud metal clang or bang, that was occurring at a 1 second interval. We heard it just as it happened, as it was loud, annoying, and echoing around the park. We didn’t want to think much of it, except that at some point, we had to notice it, because it was TOO precise. A bang. Every second. Nonstop.

I started freaking out calmly, my horror movie nights telling me I was gonna die, but Matt, who was reasonable and skeptical, never wanted to admit to horror or oddity, so he gave a reasoning for the sound. “Fireworks, gongs, knives”, he would never admit to it being weird, but in this context, it really was. My other friend Ken was as scared as me, but didn’t show it. Nick and his sister were the weirdest. Nick shut down completely, staring into the ground, but his sister just sobbed. I was freaking out: why was she crying? Why’s he staring weirdly, did something happen? A minute of that before Nick finally talked, and like a horror movie: “Guys, it’s coming from the clocks”. 

We froze, looking at each other. Not only were we 100, maybe 200 meters away from the clock, it was also where the sound came from. Now it was serious, and theories were emerging: guns, cults, sacrifice, weirdos, a killer putting stuff down the hole, every theory was told, unfolded, and continued. Matt, of course, tried to disprove each theory, but we did not wanna hear him.

11pm, the sound was now here for about an hour, maybe 2, time wasn’t really on our side, but it was there for a long time. Our friend Nick shined every few seconds at the area of the sound, hoping it would stop. To give a perspective, Ken and I were facing “the clock”, Matt was to its left, Nick was behind it, and his sister also faced it, but was behind us, near her tent calming the baby. We tried to tell each other stories to calm ourselves, but the sound wasn’t helping. Luckily, the sound slowed down in intervals, until it was gone, but we didn’t hear departures. Our nerves were calmed down, but we still didn’t hear people leave. 

It was long, very long, as I stopped checking my phone for the time. We were too scared to move or sleep, to the point we called Nick’s mom hoping she would let us sleep in her house, also outside of NYC and 2 hours away from us. Matt insisted on staying, and the mother wasn’t keen on us coming, but we kept pushing. After 10 minutes or so the mom doubled down and we hung up. Feeling despair, we finally heard another sound: cars and/or bikes leaving and going on the road, Finally. 

Midnight, the fire was basically dead, no more sounds, no more people, and no more anything. We talked for a bit more, as the sister went to sleep, and we kept going, still scared to sleep. I was still slightly uncomfortable, as it was my first time camping, and my horror movie experience didn’t seem to comfort me. A hallucination, or maybe it was real I still don’t know, but screeches, screams, or distress echoed in the night, with glaring eyes up in the trees, near us and in the skies. This is probably all normal things, but after what we experienced, I didn’t want to admit it

Too tired to stay on the seats, we went inside my tent, watching a piece of inception on Matt’s phone before turning my tent’s light off and fighting each other for a bit, talking and gaining back confidence. After a bit, we were finally ready to leave, but I didn’t want to sleep on my tent alone. I insisted, but they chose not to, and they all left my tent. I got in my sleeping bag, phone in hand trying to watch stuff with the limited data I had. Bored and half asleep, we made loud noises in our tents, in an attempt to laugh it off, pushing and brushing our tents when we went to pee, even calling on Instagram to prank each other. All ended well, more or less.

???   I don’t know the time for this, as I woke up completely exhausted, but it was still night. I felt a high amount of stress as if being watched, staring around me. I could barely see, rubbing my eyes, searching, but I was too tired to look, laying again on my bag. I finally heard someone, or something, walking around us, on each leaf, each branch, making a lot of noise near us. Finally, before I was knocked out cold from my tiredness, I saw someone put their hand on my tent, similar to how my friends did, but it was too late for anyone to sleep, right? After that, blank

Morning, finally. I woke up barely energized, but it felt good! It was morning. I looked at the time, stretched, and peeked out of my tent barely awake. My friends did the same, as Ken was the first to pop out. I popped out next, talking to him, asking if he brushed against my tent after we went to sleep. Very dry, he told me no, thinking it was me. We ate the remaining of our food and snacks, as Matt popped out. Same scenario, he said no, and thought we did. Finally, same scenario with Nick: “no, I thought it was you guys”. This gave me a little shiver, but it was morning, and no horror movie in the woods happens in the morning, so I had nothing to be afraid of.

Cleaning, scattering, throwing, we made sure to look like we were never here, and left. Going in the car, we didn’t choose to look back into the clock, although I really wanted to. As we drove out, I still had the question about the park ranger in my mind, so I asked my friend Nick who knew what he said to his sister about. With a rather scary tone, he told his sister where to go, what to do, but when she asked him about the clock, it was apparently some old psychiatric hospital or asylum of some kind, and kids usually would go there. If that didn’t give me the creeps, he added that the park ranger didn’t know the owner of the car, and that up to the moment we set up our camp, so 2 hours after we arrived, the car was still there, and the owner was not found. I blanked.

Arriving home, I had one last scare, as I checked my body for ticks: none, my tick spray worked, but Matt did get caught by one. In conclusion: cult, maybe? But that won’t stop me from camping again if I was asked, especially if it’s back in the park…
