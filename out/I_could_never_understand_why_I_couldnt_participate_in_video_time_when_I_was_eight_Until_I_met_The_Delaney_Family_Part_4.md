There was a countdown in my head.

29.

I didn’t know when this countdown started, but the robotic drone spiking into my head was enough to drag me from what felt like eternal slumber.

28.

27.

The countdown had no mercy, dropping to the early teens before my thoughts could catapult into fruition.

I awoke drowning in blurred black and white, almost like swimming in TV static. I was pressed to something ice cold, my head hanging upside down. 

I was numb but numb felt weirdly good—almost heavenly like waking up in a better place. But it quickly hit me that this wasn’t heaven, and it wasn’t a better place. I was partially aware of rough hands grasping hold of my neck, forcing my stiff body against the cool porcelain of something… a bathtub? 

18. 

The countdown was still there, warning me of impending doom, and yet I couldn’t bring myself to move. I was stiff. Paralyzed.  I had woken up feeling numb and wrong, almost like I didn’t exist. But now that I was coming back to the surface of myself and sucking in oxygen, my sludgy thoughts whirring to fruition, I could feel it. It wasn’t quite painful, more of a dull cutting at the back of my skull. Time did not seem real. It felt like both reality and fantasy as if I had been asleep for a long time. When I tried to reach for a memory, there was nothing, only the vague idea that my family was coming to get me out of this. I knew they were. Once I was aware of that, sensation slammed into me. I could feel something warm and wet dripping down my face and slipping down my back—almost a relief from the cold. 

When I managed to open my eyes, my training kicked in like a parasite—and I felt my body jerk, my hands attempting to reach for a weapon. Except I didn’t have one. 17. My hands were pinned against the tub, and when I tried to find them and move them, they were useless, detached from me. Through blurry vision, the first thing I saw was shallow water tinged black. It was supposed to be red. It was supposed to be blood oozing over the edge of the tub. I could see strands of my soaking hair, which was supposed to be blonde, now black. There was so much blood. 

There was no color, but I could smell it, the reek of old cardinal crusted to the tub. 

There was something sticking to my mouth, suffocating me.

16.

15.

Blood.

Was it mine…?

14.

13.

*This is an emergency broadcast to all agents,* a woman’s voice shrieked into the root of my skull.

7.

*The Delaney Family have been compromised. I repeat: the Delaney Family have been compromised. I have lost communication with Spencer Delaney, Luna Delaney, Jasper Delaney, and Elizabeth Delaney. Please respond. I repeat. Please respond. Final message received: 08/05/2022.* The message cut out before starting again, crackling in static as gloved fingers tiptoed across the back of my head, followed by the sharp prick of a needle slipping into my skull. There was no pain, nothing to suggest I was being hurt. But the feeling of a blade cutting through skin, muscle, and bone contorted me, reminding me of my training. I couldn't reach my gun.

No, I didn't have one. 

My arms were pinned against the side of the tub, useless. 

I cried out again, and this time I could see the drip, drip, drip of oozing darkness splattering white, blood completely drained of color hitting the water. 

6.

5.

4.

I wanted my thoughts, my name, anything. But it was all gone. And I was suffocating in static expanding in my eyes, and swirling oblivion diluting the tub.

3.

2.

This time, I tried to fight back, screeching into the wet duct tape over my mouth, only for those same hands to slap me across the face. They did not speak. Whoever held me was silent. I couldn’t hear their breaths or footsteps. They were like a ghost, a shadow. My thoughts spun and the countdown continued. I sucked in a breath and awaited one, and then zero. Everywhere my panicked gaze flitted, searching for an escape, I was stuck in black and white, a TV screen inside my head entrapping me. 

I didn’t hear the countdown reach zero, but I did start to feel the effects of it, my body growing limp, my mind shutting down. All except that voice, which continued when my head hit the side of the tub with a wet, meaty smack. *This is an emergency broadcast for all agents,* the crackling continued, growing louder. I could sense its urgency to reach me. And I wondered if that was them.

If my family were coming.

When the sound of a drill started up, and I could sense spinning blades getting closer and closer, I held onto that voice. *The Delaney Family have been compromised! I repeat! The Delaney Family have been compro—*

…

Who exactly was Spencer Delaney?

Six months prior, I was once again at the mercy of my brainwashed boyfriend who had dragged me into his family of mindless psycho’s. I come from a family who are not human, an entity named ʍopɐɥs, which made me a target. After witnessing his siblings brutally murdering my mother and little brother, I thought Spencer had come back to himself. I thought he’d gotten his mind back. I was naïve to think so, because once again I was stuck inside the Delaney family’s basement,  tied to a wooden chair. Spencer was standing in front of me, his arms folded, unblinking eyes finding nothing but an assignment. His job was to find out where the final Castor sibling was. 

Cam. 

Who had escaped Jasper Delaney’s bloodbath. I could still see my younger brother hiding inside the downstairs closet, only noticeable from the blanketed shadow wrapped around him, dozens of unblinking eyes and razor sharp teeth following me down the hallway, silently pleading for help. 

I saw him before I was dragged away, and when I caught his eye, I told him to stay. Because if he moved, he was dead. Cam nodded in one slow movement and pressed his hands over his mouth, bleeding back into the closet. When the Delaney siblings had been asked if my entire family had been taken care of, Jasper had confidently responded with, *Yes, ma'am.*  But Spencer kept looking behind him, eyes narrowed like he was searching. He didn’t give up, scanning through every room, drawing his gun when he stepped into each one, fingers wrapped around the butt, eyes vacant. 

With the way he swung his handheld with precision, trigger happy at every movement, I think that was the moment I realized there was no saving him, and I couldn’t use him as an anchor anymore.  

Spencer had witnessed my mother and brother officially “deleted” with no mercy, their brains painting the bathroom. 

I waited for him to react to it. I waited for his lips to recite Pi in a desperate attempt to keep hold of his mind—only for him to straighten up, his expression going flat, and following his orders to locate and kill my surviving brother. 

I was yet to understand the depths of the brainwashing done to the three siblings, though, from experience with the two “brothers” coming out of it for a short time, I figured waking up was rare—and even when they managed to tear from the programming, it was short-lived. Spencer Delaney was an enigma to me. I thought he had come back to me. I thought he had saved me. 

Only for him to slip back under the program’s control.  I hated a lot of things at that moment. I hated him for looming over me awaiting me to spill the location of my surviving brother. 

And I fucking hated myself for failing to drill into his head instead of my own. If I had saved him instead of trying to save myself, maybe the boy underneath Spencer Delaney would have saved my family. Or maybe I was delusional. *Who is Spencer Delaney?* 

The woman’s voice in my head mocked my own thoughts, her murmur tricking into me, accompanying drowning static pouring into my skull, all-encompassing. *You already know the identity of one sibling,* she chuckled. *Recruit Hart, a lost boy from your middle school days.* Spencer seemed to mimic her words, his fingers sliding up and down a blade he’d been holding for a while. His eyes didn’t flicker, and his lips didn’t part. 

His facial expression stayed stoic, only expanding into a smile when she wanted him to smile. The woman in the static liked to use the siblings as her puppets, regularly speaking through them.  I refused to look at the blade or think about what he was going to do to me to get the location of my brother.

Spencer crouched in front of me, and he was too close. Just how she liked it. 

"How about me?" 

His warm breath tickled my cheek, and I couldn’t resist losing myself to the boy whom I had stupidly fallen for. When he sliced off my first nail with a single flick of the blade, I barely felt it despite my body jerking, a scream escaping my throat. Instead, I was somewhere better. She was already catapulting me into my own mind. 

I was on our second date, my cheeks burning, my stomach trying to projectile into my throat.

"Are they still there?" 

Spencer Delaney wasn’t supposed to be the type of guy who was mine, and yet somehow he was sitting in front of me, shadowed by dark brown curls falling in half lidded eyes, a scowl curved on his lips. 

This guy didn’t seem real, strands of dark hair illuminated in the warm glow of candlelight. He was pissed. I could see it in the way he was uncomfortably shifting in his chair, his gaze flicking across the restaurant to where his siblings were unsuccessfully trying to be inconspicuous. Spencer had mentioned to me his family was “weird” but I wasn’t expecting them to stalk our every move. Instead of replying, I leaned across the table and pointed at his menu where he’d scribbled out the entire pizza menu with a pen he’d been fidgeting with, twirling it between his fingers.

“Don’t you like pizza?” I couldn’t resist a smile.

“Hm?” Spencer blinked, the pen slipping from his fingers. His attention turned to his scribbles and he laughed, albeit a little nervously. “Oh, yeah. I’m not really a fan,” his gaze was quick to flick back to his siblings. He held his menu in front of his reddened face. “I am so sorry.” He said under his breath. “Trust me, as soon as we’re done here, I’m going to strangle both of them.”

“At the same time?”

“Slowly,” he said, shooting a death glare at his older brother, who was hiding, or "hiding" behind a copy of The New Yorker.  “With my bare hands.”

“It’s kind of cute,” I hid behind my own menu, leaning over to him. “Does your brother think he’s Inspector Gadget?”

Jasper Delaney admittedly had the right fit. It wasn’t quite a cartoon detective, but close enough, a white shirt with a wonky, unbuttoned collar, and a pair of raybans pinning back disheveled curls. The elder Delaney brother definitely had his brother’s looks, though it was his too-sharp teeth that had caught me off guard. 

Maybe a vampire inspector? Spencer didn’t seem to find me funny, slowly melting in his seat, his cheeks burning bright red. My own joke made me laugh, and the boy sighed, lowering his head. He started to gather up all the menus on the table and positioned them around us, hiding us from sight.

“Something like that.” Spencer ducked, pulling me down with him, a slight smile curving on his lips. “I told you they were kind of weird.”

“You did.”

He cracked a grin which was more of a grimace. “Welcome to the Delaney family.”

“Your sister…” I cleared my throat, gesturing to her bobbing ponytail. Luna had gone for a more sophisticated look. She definitely thought she was a Bond girl, blanketed in a red flowing dress that made her incredibly, and hilariously noticeable.

I craned my neck. “I can see her behind that book.”

I didn’t think Spencer could somehow embody anxiety and stress itself, and yet somehow he was managing it. I caught sweat glistening on his forehead. “Yep, I know,” he said through a wide smile. “Luna is just… curious. I’ve never had a girlfriend.”

I folded my arms, enjoying the pretty glow in his eyes, which were mod-roll. 

Every time I looked at him, I felt myself melt. It wasn’t just his smile that completely entranced me. It was everything about him; the stain on his blazer from the wine he’d spilled, and the red glow in his cheeks elevating uneven freckles. I had considered having “the talk” with him when I realized his brother and sister were slightly on the crazy side, clearly obsessed with their brother. 

But it was impossible to let go of him. The number of times I’d almost left out of pure embarrassment, only for him to lure me back in with a spluttered laugh and attempt at an explanation, spilling his wine all over himself in the process. 

Spencer was an unhinged mess, adorable and dorky, and nothing like his psycho siblings. He shot them a warning look, and if looks could kill, they would be out like a light. 

Still, they didn’t back off. There was something about him, though. Underneath the clumsy mess of a man trying and failing to appear calm, I could see the edge in his eyes, the curl in his lips. I could only imagine the conversations they were going to be having when I was gone. Which was kind of hot. So, my butt stayed glued to that chair, and my annoyance and anger quickly faded into amusement when my boyfriend’s face morphed into a full-fledged tomato. I leaned closer to him, pressing the back of my hand against his clammy skin. “So, are we hiding from them?”

He looked surprised at my touch for a moment, before nodding. “That’s the plan,” Spencer grumbled from behind his menu. “Freida, if you want to, you know…” he trailed off, and I could see the mental turmoil on his lips. “I would understand.”

I didn’t budge. “Your brother and sister are literally stalkers,” I couldn’t help laughing when his face fell, and I poked him. “But.” I inched closer to him. “I like you. Not your weird family.” Slowly, as if testing the waters, I leaned forward, my stomach flipping. With a quick glance in his sibling's direction, I turned back towards Spencer and got an idea. It wasn’t the greatest of ideas because this could quickly go south. 

But I could really do with not having eyes burning into my skull. I grabbed the front of his shirt and tugged him closer, planting my hands on his shoulders to reassure him that this would get rid of… the nuisance. 

Then I kissed him. 

It took him a moment to respond, shooting me with a deer-in-the-headlights look before he kissed back, and with the way he was moving in time with me, almost copying my movements, it put me off. 

The kiss was flat and clumsy, but now I was the embarrassed one. With the way the two of us were awkwardly hiding behind our menus, keeping our heads down, I wondered if this was what celebrities felt like hiding from the paparazzi. The Delaney’s were an enigma just like my boyfriend, a mystery I couldn’t solve.  However,  there was something about Spencer Delaney that struck me as odd during our first kiss. His movements weren’t awkward, as in someone moving in for a first kiss. It was almost like he was mimicking my exact movements, mirroring me in a way, like he was learning, or teaching himself. I could have sworn his lips tasted of a chemical, but I couldn’t place which one.  Spencer sighed into the kiss. 

“They’re still watching aren’t they?"

I rolled my eyes. “I’m too scared to look.” I side-eyed the siblings, and.. yep. But at least Luna had the decency to hold up a book. Jasper, with that usual not-quite-there look in his eyes, was still staring directly at me. 

So, I loosened Spencer’s collar.

Then his tie. Jasper raised a brow, and I wondered if abandoning my pride in public would finally allow us some privacy.  “Freida.” Spencer’s voice was a low growl when I cupped the side of his face and kissed him again, telling him this would get rid of them. Spencer looked skeptical and a little nervous but after a quick glance at his siblings, he joined in with a quiet laugh. “You’re kidding,” he mumbled into my mouth, to which I shut him up with a hiss of my own, warning him to play along. 

My hands moved up and back behind his neck, fingers tangling in his curls as if to appear desperate. Another sharp glance at Luna, her expression twisted with disgust. I caught her lips mouth, *Urgh.* I prayed to god that our little wall of menus was hiding us from patrons, though it only took me noticing Jasper Delaney’s expression light up for a fraction of a second, only for him to mouth, *Right here?* for my fingers to creep down to the buttons on Spencer’s shirt. I sensed him stiffening up and looking closer, there were marks around his throat. 

For a moment I wondered if… no. I brushed away the thought, but the yellowing bruises tainting his skin put a sour taste in my mouth. They were in a pattern, and when I followed it, the bruises reminded me of… fingers. 

Fingers wrapped around his neck. 

“Wait.” Spencer’s chuckle brought me back to fruition, an explosion of warm breath on my face. My own breaths were staggered and shaky, and I couldn’t stop staring at the bruises. I didn’t even realize he’d stopped kissing me, my attention on the sudden smell. It wasn’t just his lips. Spencer Delaney smelled of a chemical that he’d tried to camouflage with cologne, something artificial drowning him, and I hadn’t noticed until then. Until his face was three inches from mine.  “Holy shit, I think they’re actually leaving.” 

“Really?” I quickly averted my eyes, my attention going back to his brother and sister. And sure enough, the two of them were gone.

I don’t know why I didn’t question the bruises tainting his skin, or the odd stink clinging to him, as if he had been dipped in detergent. I ignored all the warning signs and decided to fall for him anyway—which was my biggest mistake. I was a pawn in this organization’s game to delete my whole family, and Spencer was just the pretty face assigned to lure me to the family's house. 

*Daydreaming, Fredia?*

The woman’s crackling words seeped into my skull just as vivid pain exploded, and I was pulled back to my reality, where my fourth fingernail had been brutally torn from my finger. I didn’t scream. The woman wouldn’t let me, already drowning me in her own personal fantasy. I could see the flickering static of a familiar TV screen blurring across my vision. Spencer leaned closer to me, his expression nothing but a façade of human emotions. I had a thought. How did Spencer become part of the family?

He wasn’t in my middle school and high school memories, only his brother. 

“I am sorry, Freida.” He said in a breath, which prickled my neck. 

His robotic tone devoid of humanity suggested otherwise. This time he was slow, tearing off the nail with expert precision, his piercing gaze never leaving me. “We have intel which suggests there is a surviving member of the Castor family,” He inclined his head. “Cameron Castor. Seventeen years old. He is a ʍopɐɥs and designated as a category five level threat.” 

Another nail came off, and this time I did feel it, my scream clenched between my teeth. The pain hit in lightning bolts, too fast for me to register. Spencer leaned closer. He dug the blade under the bridge of my thumbnail teasing it, and my body violently jerked back and forth. “What is the location of Cameron Castor?”

I shook my head, trying to shake her from my thoughts.

“I have always wondered what will break you,” the woman murmured into my head. “Your father’s murder barely fazed you, and your brother and mother being blown to pieces right in front of you has only left you feeling…. Numb.” She sighed. “But… it turns out that it is not your own pain that will break you, Fredia. Like every other human being, it is others' pain. The people you love.” Spencer straightened up as she continued. “That is what will bring you over to us. Empathy is a weakness. It destroys the human mind, making you less of an agent—a soldier.” She paused. 

“But who do you have left to care about and mourn, hmm? I could show you your brother’s death, your mother’s head exploding in front of your face—and yet I don’t think it would be quite as raw and despairing as witnessing a loved one lose their mind. The human brain is delicate, and when pushed to the limit, it can be subjugated. Which is how we created him.” I could hear the smile curved on her lips despite her being a disembodied voice in my head. 

“That’s right…” she chuckled, when it started to hit me in slow instances, my own mind distracted from the pain of my body being ripped apart, my mind drowned in fog, that she was talking about my fake boyfriend. “Jasper Delaney was made from childhood, a young ʍopɐɥs converted into a human soldier, while Luna Delaney’s origins are far more… detailed.” I could sense the woman once again entwining herself around me, triumphant. “But Spencer Delaney? Oh, sweetie, he was.. well, why don’t I show you?” 

No. 

“Do you love him?” The woman teased in a giggle. “Is Spencer Delaney… special to you?”

*No.*

But she was right, latching onto and pressing down on every thought like it was a bruise. I was still holding onto him, and holding onto hope that he would snap out of it and get me out of there. “Yes, he is.” She chuckled. “You’re still holding on to those good parts of him. The man you met and fell in love with… regardless of his…” she paused. “Interesting… family.” Static buzzed in my brain, the TV screen flickered, and a title flickered to life. 

“The Delaney Family! In: “But I’m just the pizza guy!”

It was like watching an old sitcom, and I found myself glued to the twitching words enveloping through buzzing, just as another of my nails was pulled off. 

This time violently. 

It wasn’t the woman who spoke to me, then. It was Spencer himself, his lips attached to my ear when he brought the blade down on my arm and began to carve into my skin, digging deeper and deeper until my body was jolting back, my scream caught in an O. 

“Would you like to see how we brought the boy into the family?"

No. 

There was so much pain, enough to play with my mind, and with my words. 

*Yes.*

I heard myself speak through screams that rattled my brain. I wanted it to stop. I wanted everything to stop. I could hear myself speaking in gibberish and tugging at my arms covered in blood, at bloody flaps of flesh left behind from Spencer’s blade. When the television screen glowed brighter in my head, expanding into the backs of my eyes, I tried to throw myself from the restraints, fight or flight taking over. 

If I didn’t get away from them, they were going to shatter me. And my shattered self would give up Cam’s location. I couldn’t even hear my own scream, just the explosion of an old-style fifties theme tune bursting into my skull, as the program began. “The Delaney family! In: “But I’m just the pizza guy! Starring: Spencer Delaney!”

The cast list popped onto the screen in buzzing white text.

“Guest starring!”

“Jasper Delaney!”

“Luna Delaney!”

“And Mr and Mrs Delaney!”

“Stop.”

I could hear my voice slipping through the theme tune cracking through my skull, the blade slowly chipping off the flesh of my arm coming to a standstill.

Before slowly moving to my neck, his hands expertly sliced into my skin, careful not to nick a vein. The blade scraping across my skin almost played with my mouth, bringing my brother’s location to my lips. Instead of speaking, I gritted out a screech.

“The location of your brother, Fredia.”

His voice was like a footprint in the sand when the tide was coming in, washing away before it could fully register.

He dug the knife in again.

I squeezed my eyes shut, my body shuddering. 

“Your brother’s location.”

This time the three siblings spoke as one.

“I’ll tell you,” I managed to hiss out, a lie I knew would take my mind. “I’ll tell you! Just stop.”

“Oh, no, you’re going to love this!” The woman responded in my head. I could see her come to fruition, perfecting a cartwheel across the screen and sitting in her own chair, pulling out an overflowing bag of popcorn. “Just sit tight and enjoy the show!”

I was aware of myself trying to force myself from the chair, only for rough hands to grasp the back of my neck, paralyzing me. Jasper. Luna, in the corner of my eye. I could sense her watching, awaiting her orders to hold me down.  The screen flittered, and I was greeted with a black-and-white version of the Delaney yard, almost like I was watching a real TV show. 

And there he was. 

Even with all of the color drained away, reality twisted and contorted into this woman’s personal fantasy, I could still see him. Standing in a short-sleeved polo shirt, a pizza hut cap nestled over darkish blonde curls, Spencer Delaney looked almost unrecognizable. 

While the man whom I thought I knew seemed to be a clumsy mess, this guy’s expression was hardened, a certain hollowness in his eyes. Not the vacancy of a lost soul lost inside a shell of himself. This guy had a rough upbringing and definitely had street sense. He was younger, a piercing in his nose, and tattoos running up and down his arms. While Spencer had worn white shirts and sweater vests, a rich guy part of a high-class family, this guy’s hair was in need of a cut, lips chapped. I could see his attempt at coloring in the holes in his sneakers, and his cap was definitely thrifted. 

“Yoo,” Spencer’s eyes were narrowed, lips curved around a pen parting into a scowl. “Anyone in there? Dude, I’ve been knocking for like, five minutes. I’m here for, uh… The Delaney’s?” He ducked down and pulled out four pizza boxes from a large bag. “Three pepperoni pizzas, a large Coke, and a brownie dessert.” Spencer paused. 

“Do you want me to leave ‘em out here, or….?”

There was a sudden burst of what sounded like laughter—canned laughter from an invisible audience.

“I can literally see your light on,” he craned his neck. “Can you please come get your goddamn food?”

In a sudden dizzying burst of static on the screen, color dripped into fruition, bleeding into the dull black and white. 

I could see it in the smears of red smeared across Spencer’s forehead and pooling down his temples. His pizza cap was gone, blondish curls tainted and caked with old and new red glued to strands. This time, he was strapped down, lying on his back. His eyes were half-lidded, lips parted in what should have been a cry. But he wasn’t crying or yelling, only blinking rapidly at the camera staring down at him. I could already see the cavern in the back of his skull, the start of a wound drilling into his brain. The bandage wrapped around his head was soaked through with red, and I felt my own body recoil. 

While my attempted conversion had been fast and filled with fog and memories drowning my thoughts, his was brutal. 

His was pure torture. 

“Who the fuck are you guys?” The boy underneath Spencer Delaney’s voice was a whimper, a single breath from his lips when a blade slipped into the back of his head. I saw sharp red splash down his face, over his eyes, trickling down his cheeks, mixing with tears. His frightened eyes flicked back and forth, and I knew he was following that same dot, the one that had stolen my teen years. “Why…” His voice collapsed into a slur. 

“We are The Delaney Family.” Mr. Delaney’s voice responded in a low drone. I could hear him off-camera, placing down the drill with a low chuckle. “According to our database, you are the perfect son to perfect the building of our family. We currently have a mother, a father, a son, and a daughter.” He cleared his throat. “To complete a specifically targeted assignment, we are in need of another son. Your records show that you do not have your own family. Would you like to join ours?"

“Are you fucking kidding me?!” 

“Stay still.”

“But… I’m just,” he sputtered out a laugh. “I’m just the pizza guy! What the fuck are you talking about?” He strained against the velcro straps. “Let me go,” Spencer whispered. “I won’t tell a soul, I promise. I… I’m not what you’re looking for. Trust me—” he stopped speaking, his words caught on his tongue. Spencer screamed, and I could feel it—exactly what he had felt.

“Let me go.”

His voice became a shriek, a clawed-out cry I didn’t think I would ever hear. It was feral and animalistic when self-preservation took over.

“Let me go!”

I spat his blood from my mouth, trembling under the drill blade skating the back of his head. The woman was quick to notice my diminishing mental state.

“Had enough, Freida?”

I didn’t see the blade enter his skull, just like it had mine, but I could feel it all over again, just hearing the cry rip from his throat.

I don’t know how long I watched.

I watched until Spencer was writhing, laughing, giggling, and sputtering on his own blood. Mania quickly turned to submission. I never saw the moment he let go, his struggling wrists relaxing, and that spark leaving his eyes. 

His thoughts were in my head, a mess of gibberish crying out for a mother he didn’t know, and a father who promised to come back—a little sister who was waiting for him. The little sister he was trying and failing to keep from them, using the last of his mind to shove her into oblivion. “What is your name?”

“Spencer.”

His voice wasn’t quite that robotic drone that it was now, but it was close, humanity slowly bleeding away. 

I didn’t catch his real name. 

It came from his mouth so many times in attempts to hold onto it, but every time, it was blurred from my mind. Like the woman knew. Sitting in the root of my mind with her bag of popcorn, she knew knowing his name would give him an identity. And knowing his real identity would give me an anchor, a reason to hold on. She wasn’t wrong. 

Through my own turmoil, my own mind being turned to mush as I watched him lose his, I listened out for a slither of what made him human. The drilling stopped, and the bed reclined further down, a light flashing in his unblinking eyes.

“Spencer…?” Mr. Delaney’s voice pushed. I saw the curve of the man’s smile, his finger grazing the button, ready to rip it out of him.

“Spencer Delaney.”

That was the moment I snapped—and I let go of this idea of the man who was going to save me from his psycho family.

And while letting go of him, I slipped away from myself. The screen flicked off, and I stopped screaming. I stopped crying. I gave them Cam’s location when Spencer’s hands wandered over my body, finding patches of flesh left untouched. I was told that my brother would be spared, and instead enter The Family Program once being severed. 

I thought back to the bench next to the detention room, back inside my high school. Where recruit Hart— now Jasper Delaney— had mourned the pieces of himself cut and sliced away. That was Cam's fate. Because I couldn’t hold on. The scream that left my throat was pained, tangled, and raw. It didn’t feel real, nothing did. I screamed until my brain was foggy. There was a low murmur in my head, and I found myself latching onto it. It sounded like mom. 

“It’s okay,” she said softly. “You’re okay now. All of the bad stuff has gone. You were brainwashed by those monsters your whole life, and now you’re finally coming back to yourself, sweetheart.”

Yes.

I was coming back to myself.

I had been… brainwashed by the monsters who had taken me as a child and raised me as their own.

Monsters.

*ʍopɐɥs.*

I sensed my body relaxing, and the blood and pain blurred into nothing, the pain fading away.

*I want to go home.*

When I lifted my head, I spoke to the shadows looming over me. I wanted to go home. I wanted my… I wanted my family back.

“Oh, don’t be ridiculous!”

The woman’s motherly voice in my head was comforting, and I followed her murmur. “You are home!” she chuckled, and I found myself laughing with her. “Look! Your family have all been waiting for you,” she sighed. “It’s been so long. They’ve missed you.”

*They were.*

My mom smiled, my dad with a single tear in his eyes.

One of my brothers rolled his eyes, the other looking like an excited puppy dog.

My sister came towards me, dressed in fifties floral, and wrapped her arms around me. I could feel her gun strapped to her dress.

Home.

My head spun, tangled, and wrong.

Family.

The static in my eyes morphed into a new title. “The Delaney Family! In: a new sibling?!”

“Starring!”

“Mr. Delaney!”

“Mrs. Delaney!”

"Spencer Delaney!" 

“Luna Delaney!”

“Jasper Delaney!”

I was shown their original selves in the format of twisted audition tapes. 

Luna. 

Choking on freezing cold water being forced down her throat. 

Spencer. 

Writhing underneath a drill blade pulverising his skull. 

I saw Jasper’s ʍopɐɥs self, thousands of blinking eyes blanketed in shadow, wide in fright, his ʍopɐɥs form strapped into the chair inside the detention closet. I could see the pieces of him that had been sliced away, inky black darkness pooling beneath him mixed with blood dripping down his shirt. He was screaming, his cries raw, desperate for parents they took away.

“And… introducing...”

When I accepted my place in The Delaney Family, my world quickly turned to black and white, reduced to a never-ending fifties sitcom playing in the back of my head, while another girl with my face slowly bled inside my mind and wove herself through me. 

Her life flashed in front of my eyes. 

Instead of being pulled away from the training academy at twelve years old, she stayed and continued until she graduated. She shot her first ʍopɐɥs at the age of eighteen years old, and one year later, she was recruited to join The Delaney Family, specially assigned to target families of ʍopɐɥs and delete them from existence before the disease could spread. I saw her first assignment alongside her brothers and sister, framed in a sitcom-style format. 

The Jeffersons were the first. They were a quick fix, the four of them sneaking inside and shooting each member at point-blank range. The Delaney family lived a perfect white picket fence life in the suburbs. They were the idealistic family, quietly murdering their ʍopɐɥs neighbors behind a façade of book clubs and cookouts. It was when they—or we—moved into our newest neighborhood, was when I started to… stir. I had been asleep for so long, sick of the sitcom and wanting to turn it off.

Sometimes there were re-runs of the same episodes.

It was when I was helping my father carry out moving boxes when something… snapped. I remember not being able to feel for a long time before I was standing beside my older brother, a large box in my arms, carrying it from the moving van. Spencer was behind me, arguing with Luna, while our parents were hauling our stuff inside our brand new house. 

“Uh-oh,” Jasper murmured in my ear, his face momentarily flashing into mesmerising color, before going black and white. The sight was enough to draw breath from my lips, and I caught more color. I could see the green of the trees around us. Summer. It was fall the last time I remembered. The sky was the perfect shade of blue. “Is it me, or do our targets seem like they're watching us?"

The invisible audience laughed at that, some of them cheering. 

Spencer Delaney drew his handheld, patting his brother on the back. 

"Scared, Jasps?" 

Jasper inched away, blowing a raspberry. "Not even close!" 

Another screen erupted into life in front of me, glitching, the world once again filling with color. I almost dropped the box, static seeping back into my vision. 

*The Delaney Family, in: There's someone behind you!*

I turned across the road following the other's eyes, glimpsing a mailbox labelled with, “The Pattersons!”

Luna threw her arm around me, and I could suddenly see the bright pink of the ribbon in her hair. When I looked down, old red was caked into my fingernails and dripping down my dress. Partially free of the control, I tried to fight it. Elizabeth Delaney was strong, though. She quickly shoved me back down, and the show continued. I slept for a while, sometimes waking to myself blowing a ʍopɐɥs's brains out. 

I felt her face showered in them, in pure ʍopɐɥs. 

I sensed her smile growing, revelling in each kill. 

Something slammed into the back of her–our– head. 

I was aware of my gun slip from my hands, and my knees hitting the floor. 

A familiar voice, arms on my shoulders. Breath in my face. *Say it with me,* his voice was shaking. *Three point one, four–* 

*We’re running out of time, idiot.* 

Another voice. Harsher. *Oh my fucking god, let me try!*

*But she's not responding!* Shaky voice whispered. 

*You know we’ve got minutes, right?*

*It's all we've got,* The one with the trembling voice was the one holding me. *You guys taught me it.*

The harsher one groaned. *It's an anchor, that's it. This thing is permanent. We're never getting free.*

A girl's voice this time, *Maybe we're saying it wrong? Three point one, four, one, five, nine, two, six, five, three…* 

The voices faded into white noise, and I was left with the numbers in my head. 

"Three point one, four, one, five, nine, two, six, five, three, five."

Speaking their anchor into the wet, sticky duct tape over my mouth brought me back to the present, finally, to a countdown that had stopped, my head dangling over a tub spattered with my blood, and an old broadcast  slowly cutting out in my head. It was too late. 

Too late to recite that number because time had passed. Enough time for the voices in my head to be long gone. Still though, I was awake. I twisted my head. 

Next to me was another tub, another body hanging over it, but this one didn’t have a head. Something ice cold slipped down my spine, and I risked another look around the large concrete room I was inside, and the color was too much, latching me to bloody corpses hanging from hooks and piled on the ground, gutted and hollowed out, tangles of limbs and shredded flesh. *This is an emergency broadcast to all agents,* the voice crackled in my head when I recognized the body on top, a torso, and inches away was what was left of his head. Mr. Delaney.

*Dad*.

Something cold dripped onto my head when I tipped it back, blinking rapidly. 

Hanging upside down from her feet above me, a bulging mound of flesh, her guts squirming from a deep cavern sliced in her gut, was Mrs. Delaney.

*Mom*. 

There was another pile, tangled limbs dumped on top of each other.  I  couldn't see their faces. Breathing heavily into the tape over my mouth, I twisted back to the tub, my stomach reeling, the message whirring in my head. *The Delaney Family have been compromised! I repeat: The Delaney Family have been compromised! I have lost communication with Spencer Delaney, Luna Delaney, Jasper Delaney, and Elizabeth Delaney. Please respond! Self destruct will begin in 30 seconds–*

Before it was cut off completely.

“That’s enough of that,” a girl’s murmur caught me off guard. She was the one grasping hold of my neck, forcing my face against cold porcelain. “Hi, Elizabeth!” Her voice was practically a squeal. “I’m a big fan of The Delaney Family! Your guys are famous around here,” she chuckled, and I could sense her stink, a sticky darkness clinging onto her, dozens of eyes drinking me in. She was ʍopɐɥs. 

I could feel my body jerk in retaliation, but she just slammed my head into the side of the tub, my nose breaking on impact. "The family who murder our kind in our sleep,” She giggled, her fingernails digging into my scalp, harsh enough to make me scream. She tugged my head back, forcing me to drink the room in further. I could see my sister's dress crumpled on the ground, her pink ribbon hanging from the ceiling. "Well, I'm Wendy Patterson! We're going to have so much fun!" 

… 

Wendy Patterson made me realize why the government created The Delaney Family, even with their brutal methods.

Why they murdered my mom and dad. 

To wipe every ʍopɐɥs from this world. 

They were fucking scared of one's like *her.*
