As I sprinted towards the stairwell, I quickly dug my fingers into my eye, tore the glass ball out of my head, and threw it down the hall as far as I could. I wasn’t going to give that asshole any further advantage than he already had over me. I quickly entered the stairwell full of rotting corpses and sprinted up the stairs. I wasn’t going to bother going up to the 11th floor again, since he probably would think that I’d be dumb enough or panicked enough to consider doing that. Instead, I got off on the 6th floor and quickly sprinted towards the closest room. Taking my phone out and using it as a flashlight to illuminate the pitch darkness I turned the doorknob to see if this room was opened. It wasn’t. 



I quickly whipped my backpack around and pulled out my lockpicking tool; making quick work of the door even though I was working with only two working fingers on my left hand. I entered the now unlocked hotel room and slammed the door behind me. I wasn’t planning on hiding there however, I had a better plan. I quickly began to make a mess of the hotel room, ripping the sheets off and kicking up a mountain of decades-old dust into the air. I yanked the comforter off of the queen-sized bed and next went about picking the side door into the next-door hotel room. 



This door also met the same fate as the last one and I quickly ran inside, surrounded by my new comforter. I quickly exited the second room and made a v-line towards the ice machine and the vending machines. I had a hunch that a hotel this old and abandoned had to have an ice machine that was large enough for me to fit in. And to my immense relief there indeed was one large enough for me to climb into. Even though this hotel was supposed to be abandoned I was still confused as to how everything still seemed to work, including the electricity. But I wasn’t in the habit of thinking too deeply about it, as I quickly wrapped the comforter around me and climbed into the still-working and freezing ice box, shutting my phone off and plunging me into darkness. 



I shivered a bit as I got myself situated and waited for the ice to stop making noise as it also settled in around me and my protective blanket. Maybe even if Mirror Creole was able to find me the blanket would protect me from any attack he might make on me. Wishful thinking sure, but I needed any comfort that I could get. I waited in the ice machine waiting to see when my five-minute head start would be done. I didn’t have long to wait. 



“Ready or not, here I come.” Creole’s voice whispered in my ears, causing me to flinch and look behind me to see if he had somehow appeared behind me in the confined space. Even though he wasn’t there I quickly shivered uncontrollably. Both because of the freezing temperatures and because the game had officially begun. 



I wrapped the blanket around me as tightly as I could and waited to see what would happen. I had an hour to survive, and if I did, I would be free of him. Even though an hour might seem short I felt every single second tick by as I began to flinch at every single noise that happened. Every single ice cube that fell next to me caused my heart to nearly beat out of my chest. 



A few minutes later but what felt like six days later I heard the stairwell door open. I froze so tightly that I could probably have passed for an ice cube as I tried to listen to see if I could hear Mirror Creole walk around the hall. But judging by the fact that I couldn’t even hear mirror me’s footsteps when she was chasing me, I doubted if I was going to be able to hear his. But what I did manage to hear was a few doors being opened and closed. 



It sounded like whoever was doing it was just quickly popping in and closing the door soon after. That certainly didn’t seem like something the mirror creatures would do. Because they were much more likely to just bust the door down in their attempt at finding me. After a few more doors I heard footsteps approaching and I didn’t so much as move a muscle. And then to my horror, the door to the ice machine was opened, but before I could do anything a hand was placed on my mouth. 



My eyes adjusted from the pitch black as a lantern was shone into my face. I stared up at the button eyes and permanent smile of Jacob. I quickly let out a torrent of muffled obscenities at him. I was filled with so much anger, fear, and rage that they all boiled together when I finally laid eyes on him again. He had nearly tried to kill me just a few moments ago in Creole’s shop and now here he was probably about to sell me out to his boss. 



Instead, he quickly held a finger up to his smiling face and quickly pointed towards a corner. I followed his gaze and was shocked to see that a part of my comforter had been sticking out of the ice machine. He quickly stuffed the blanket completely into the ice machine and looked around him before finally removing his hand from my mouth. 



“Thanks,” I mumbled to him, still not fully trusting him after he had so nearly eaten me back at the shop. He nodded quickly and again looked around before handing me some hand warmers and slowly closing the ice machine lid. I heard his footsteps quickly walk away and become faint as he seemingly left to continue the search for me. I stared down at the hand warmers and gave them a little shake as I again settled back down into the blanket and the ice cubes surrounding me. 



It wasn’t long after Jacob left that I heard loud thumping coming from not too far away. And more horrifyingly, soft singing. It was faint at first but it slowly grew louder as I guessed the Mirror Creole was enjoying his hunt. 



“Don’t you ever laugh, as a hearse goes by. For you may be the next to die,” he sang as I heard soft clacking against the surface of the ceiling. He was crawling on the ceiling just like the mirror me had done. I involuntarily shivered as I imagined that lanky bastard crawling around on the ceiling. He continued singing as he came to a stop just near the ice machine. I couldn’t tell if he was scanning around or if he already knew where I was and was just taunting me. 



“The worms crawl in, the worms crawl out. The worms play pinochle on your snout. They eat your eyes, they eat your nose, as you begin to decompose,” he continued to sing as his voice grew louder with every lyric. It was here that my nose began to betray me. All the dust that I had kicked up had made itself at him in my nose and I suddenly needed to sneeze more than I ever had in my life. I quickly raised my fingers to cover my nose to prevent anything from escaping but in doing so I caused some ice cubes to move. 



The singing came to an abrupt stop and so did my heart. There was no way he’d heard the sound of the ice cubes moving. Was there? My question was soon answered when I heard something drop down from the ceiling. I had held my breath so long that it felt like my lungs were about to burst from lack of air. Just as I was sure I was about to be torn to shreds, a loud crash rang out from down the hall. 



Suddenly Mirror Creole took off toward the sound of the crash. I waited for him to get far enough away from me before exiting the ice machine as quietly as I could, abandoning my blanket in the machine and quickly crawling on the floor to be as quiet as possible in the dark void. I crawled my way towards the stairwell and was happy to see that just like the mirror me, Mirror Creole had broken the door. I quickly ducked into the stairwell and ran up to the 7th floor. 



Silently exiting into the hallway I quickly turned my phone on to be able to see what I was getting into. With the adrenaline winding down I now realized how absolutely cold I was. It seemed the comforter had not been enough to keep me warm. Shivering uncontrollably I quickly ducked into another hotel room and as silently as possible entered the room. I shivered softly as I quickly ducked underneath the dusty covers trying to get warm again. 



I was almost tempted to turn the shower on to see if I could get some hot water going, but my instinct to survive this game was far and above my need to warm up. It took me a few more minutes to warm up and when I wasn’t as cold I quickly exited the bed and began to look around for a hiding spot. All of them however were blaring obvious. The closet, under the bed, and in the bathroom, were all too obvious and would be probably found instantly. The ice machine had been my best bet but now that Mirror Creole probably already knew I had been hiding there, he’d most likely check all the other machines. 



“What the hell do I do?” I wondered aloud to myself. Sure this place had plenty of floors but all of them had the same things a hundred times over. And all Mirror Creole had to do was get lucky once and it would be my complete doom. I entertained the idea of hiding on the first floor but I was sure that regular Creole would be waiting for me down there. The first floor had better options, the kitchen, the laundry room, etc. But now I was trapped in the upper floors, with only a long game of hide and seek to look forward to. 



Electing to keep moving, I began picking the connecting doors to each hotel room for an easier escape if I crossed paths with Mirror Creole. All this picking was great practice for me as by now it felt like I had always only had two working fingers on my left hand. As I entered another room I ventured into the bathroom to look at myself. I stared at myself with my only good eye and lifted my hand to touch the empty void where my other eye had been. I hated how I looked, and this was with the ointment that hid the fact that a good chunk of my face was missing. I walked over to the bed and tore one of the pillow covers up into a strip long enough to cover up my eye. 



As I was done tying the makeshift eyepatch onto my face I suddenly was alerted to the singing again. And it was close. Tying the eyepatch on tightly I quickly ducked into the next room and looked around for any type of hiding space. The best spot I could come up with was behind a big sofa chair in the corner of the room. Honestly taking the head off a lamp and pretending I was a lamp would’ve probably been better but in my panic. I quickly ducked behind the chair as the singing grew louder, quickly shutting my phone off. 



“And the worms crawl out, the worms crawl in. The worms that crawl in are lean and thin, the ones that crawl out are fat and stout. Your eyes fall in and your hair falls out,” he sang as I watched from the corner as a long arm reached out from above the door frame and dug its long claws into the ceiling before pulling itself into the room. This Creole was an absolute nightmare to look at. He put the version of me that came out of the mirror to shame. He was absolutely giant as he crawled gingerly across the ceiling like some enormous horrible stick bug. Creole was already tall, over six feet tall but this Creole was almost a good ten feet tall as he crawled around on the ceiling searching for me. 



“Maaaaaace, daaaaaaarling?” he croaked as his singing came to an end and he scanned his button eyes around the room. I held my my hands over my mouth and nose to not let even the tinniest bit of breath out of my mouth. Nightmare Creole looked around the room before digging his feet into the ceiling and hanging down from it like some kind of giant emaciated bat. My eye did its best to adjust to the darkness to make out what he was doing from behind the sofa chair. 



My eye widened in fear as I saw what he was doing. He opened his mouth up wide and I watched as one by one the stitches keeping his mouth together ripped open. But what happened next almost caused me to scream my lungs out. I watched in disgust as he began spitting giant rats out of his mouth and down onto the floor. I didn’t see them at first, but I heard the horrible gagging sound he was making and the loud squeaking of the rats as they quickly began to scatter around the room. 



He was trying to get me to exit my hiding spot. And he almost succeeded when one of the rats he vomited from his mouth came squeaking over to me and walked across my lap. I quickly closed my eye and did my best to ignore it as I felt its feet and tail drag across my legs. I tried to focus on the giant rat that I had killed at the high school. These little things were nothing compared to that thing, I kept reassuring myself. But the thing about phobias is that you can be as rational as you want to be, butt the end of the day, you’re still terrified of the thing you have a phobia for. 



Suddenly I heard the room’s door open and the room was flooded with light. I was sure that I was about to be spotted when Nightmare Creole hissed and quickly scampered away from the light source. He really was like some sort of giant bug. 



“What? Trying to send me on another wild goose chase?” he hissed at who I assumed was Jacob. I ventured a peek to see what was happening and was instantly regretful when I did so. Seeing Nightmare Creole in more light was simply terrifying as he hung from the ceiling. I gazed over at Jacob as he held up the blanket I had used in the ice machine. 



“So she was in one of them,” Nightmare Creole croaked in glee as he dropped down to the floor and began to intensely sniff at the blanket, causing me to throw up in my mouth at the sight. Jacob dropped the blanket and made a few gestures toward Nightmare Creole which I assumed was his way of communicating with the monster. The monster nodded before hunching down to make it through the entrance and suddenly taking off down the hall at full speed. 



I poked myself fully out of the corner and quickly flicked and kicked the rats away from me, making internal screaming sounds as I quickly ran over to Jacob. He quickly hugged me and closed the door as he entered the room with me. I shoved my face into his chest and panted, the phobia catching up with me a the rats squeaked around me and Jacob. He patted my head and offered me the lantern, and when I took it I was quickly scooped up by him and we quickly went into the room next door. 



‘How much longer do I have?” I asked him as I held onto both him and the lantern. Jacob carefully placed me down on the bed and held up 3 fingers and none on his other hand. “30 minutes?” I asked him and received a nod from him. All of this had only been 30 minutes and I had another 30 minutes left to survive. I buried my face in my hands and let out an agonizing sigh. I felt like I’d aged 40 years during this game. 



“What do I do, Jacob?” I asked him. He stared at me and then over to the door. I thought he wanted me to leave and run but I figured out that he was thinking. He took his red hat off and rubbed his hair deep in thought. He was actively trying to keep me alive. I plopped my face against his shoulder and pulled him closer to me. I wanted to at least enjoy this moment of peace and silence. 



Finally, he carefully pushed me away and quickly stood up and rummaged through the desk. He pulled out a notepad and pen and quickly began scribbling something down. I half expected it to be another smiley face but was surprised to see that he was actually writing something. When he was done he showed me what he had written. 



“King Creole isn’t on the first floor. Maybe you can find some places to hide down there?” He had written and included a smiley face in the corner, getting a smile from me. But I was more concerned by the fact that Creole wasn’t on the first floor. 



“Do you know where he went?” I asked him. To which he shook his head and offered me a shrug. I didn’t like not knowing where Creole was. But if anything it seemed better to be captured by him than being captured by Nightmare Creole. I nodded and quickly took stock of everything I still had in my backpack. The gun and ammo were still there but I doubt they’d do much for me. I nodded and quickly stood up. I handed Jacob the lantern before swinging my backpack back on.



“Wish me luck,” I told Jacob. Staring at his sickly grey face with that permanent smile, I couldn’t help but kiss him on the cheek before quickly exiting the room and making my way toward the stairwell. I felt my face get hot thinking over what I had just done, but I had no time to think about that as I quickly ran down to the first floor, gagging at the smell of the twisted mangled corpses at the bottom. 



It finally clicked in my head what those things were. They were mirror creatures, all of them tangled together with their giant limbs intertwined. I wondered how they’d all ended up like that, but I needed to focus on not joining them. I carefully opened the door to the first floor and quietly exited into the hallway, making my way down toward the kitchen area. Turning my phone on so I would be able to see where I was going. 



I made sure to look around more thoroughly so that I didn’t miss anything in my now enormous blindspot. A part of me missed my eyes but the rest of me was happy to not be spied upon. As I entered the kitchen I quickly looked around for an area to hide in. The ovens were my first option but a part of me feared being trapped in there and baked alive. So my next best option was the walk-in freezer. 



I walked over towards it and struggled with the door for a moment. It was jammed by something and took a good few tugs until it finally gave way. And to my horror when it did was met with the button eyes of Nightmare Creole staring back at me. 



“I found you!” He hissed and chuckled, reaching out to grab me. I acted quickly and slammed the door in his face, panting uncontrollably as I quickly ran away out of the kitchen. The sound of the heavy metal door hitting the floor clued me into the fact that he’d escaped and was no doubt hot on my heels. I had to find either a place to hide or something to defend myself with. That was when I noticed that the gym was just down the hall. I sprinted towards it and was glad to find that it was open. 



I quickly ducked into the room and looked around for something to defend myself with. Normal shitty hotels usually only have a treadmill and elliptical maybe a few exercise bikes. This one was nice enough to have dumbbells and kettlebells. I picked up one of the kettlebells and waited for Nightmare Creole. I didn’t have long to wait as the lanky bastard came crawling into the gym after me. Crawling on all fours he stood up on his legs and I was astonished by how tall he was, he had to hunch over just to be able to stand up. 



“End of the line, Mace,” he hissed and giggled, licking his lips with a long slimy black tongue that caused me to involuntarily shudder in disgust. He slowly approached me, like a predator playing with a wounded animal. 



“You sure about that, asshole?” I asked him as I lifted the kettlebell and chucked it straight at him, hitting him square in the chest which cracked with a loud crunch that robbed the monster of all its air, it almost sounded like he was a deflating balloon. That staggered him and put him to the floor. I quickly reached over and grabbed a dumbbell before pouncing on him and tackling him to the ground. “Fuck you!” I screamed as I began to crush his face with the dumbbell over and over. 



He thrashed around like a bug on its back but instead of screaming or shouting, he was laughing as I began caving his skull in. This wasn’t bothering him in the slightest, even with his head starting to look like ground beef. As I began to tire I was suddenly stabbed in the shoulder by his long claws. They dug in deep and he effortlessly flicked me away like I had been a bug that had landed on him. 



“Fiesty thing,” he said to me even though by the look of things he had no way of being able to speak to me. That was until, to my horror, all the damage I had done to his head began to reverse itself. Like a time-lapse in reverse his head was put back together as if nothing had happened and he giggled uncontrollably at me. 



“That feels like fucking cheating,” I panted, completely out of breath and stamina and bleeding heavily from the stab wound in my shoulder. All this voodoo bullshit was getting on my nerves. I stood up and panted, my legs felt like jelly from the blood I was losing. I was so woozy that at first, I thought I was seeing things as I noticed something standing behind Nightmare Creole. That was until I noticed the familiar bright red uniform and the bright light that he was holding. Jacob waved at me and I noticed he had a hotel ice bucket in his other hand. Nightmare Creole followed my gaze and lay his button eyes on Jacob’s. The bellhop waved to him before tossing the bucket's contents onto Nightmare Creole. 



The smell of gasoline hit me and I knew immediately what was going to happen next. I quickly raced toward Jacob as he lit a match and tossed it at Nightmare Creole with a little flick of his finger. The monstrous creature lit up like a candle the moment the match touched him. He let out a horrible screech as the fire spread and completely engulfed him. Jacob quickly picked me up again and ran down the hall, quickly followed by the flaming creature chasing after us. 



“W-where are we going?” I winced as I looked down at how heavily my shoulder was bleeding and how lightheaded I was feeling. Jacob said nothing as he ran with me in his arms down towards the pool. Judging by the screams behind us, Nightmare Creole wasn’t far behind when Jacob entered the pool with me. I wondered what he could be looking for in here. He placed me down on the floor and quickly looked around for something. I looked around as well, trying to figure out what it was that Jacob wanted. 



“You’re dead! Do you hear me, girl?! Dead!” Nightmare Creole screamed as he entered the pool, his body still flaming like a forest fire. He was so hellbent on killing me and Jacob that he hadn’t noticed that the blue tarp across the pool was hiding a secret underneath him. The moment he stepped on it he went right through it and into the murky gross water underneath him. The loud sizzling and cloud of smoke that followed after clued us into the fact that the fire had been put out. 



I was ready for him to emerge from the water and ready to attack us when I noticed that he wasn’t moving anymore. He floated to the surface as a sizzled charred corpse. Nightmare Creole was dead. I was confused as to what the hell had just happened. Jacob quickly took off his uniform jacket and ripped the sleeves off of it to make a makeshift bandage for my shoulder. I noticed as he did this that he had a spider tattoo on his right arm. Not exactly something you’d expect from a bellhop but Jacob hadn’t always been a bellhop had he?



“How did he just…die?” I asked Jacob as I continued to stare at the crispy corpse just now floating in the murky gross pool water. Jacob finished tying up my bandage before pulling out his notepad and writing a quick explanation. 



“They don’t like fire. That weakens them. A sudden change of temperature from the water destroyed organs before they could heal.” And as always he put a smiley face in the corner. I smiled up at him. He’d saved my life. And just as the timer went off announcing that I had survived this game of hide and seek, I watched in horror as Jacob’s head fell off of his shoulder and onto the pool floor. 



“I don’t take kindly to traitors.” King Creole tsked in disgust as Jacob’s now completely lifeless body fell to the floor. I began to cry uncontrollably as I watched my savior fall to the floor and twitch about in the last stages of life. “You win, Macedonia. As agreed, you and your family are free.” Creole was just barely containing his anger and it showed. His stupid smile was gone, replaced with a scowl so hateful that I thought he was going back on his deal. 



“You…how could you…” I whimpered as I crawled over and picked up Jacob’s severed head and held it close to me. It was a stupid question to ask. Of course, he would do this to me. What had I expected? Me and Jacob walking away into the sunset scott-free? I held Jacob’s head close and gave it a soft squeeze. 



“Very easily,” he told me, staring down at me like I was a cockroach. “Tell you what, take his head if you’d like. I already have a new employee. And he has a lot of potential.” His smile returned, full of devious and malicious intent. “On your feet. I’ll escort you back to the shop, but after that, I’d advise you never to cross paths with me again,” he ordered me, snapping his fingers at me so that I could get a move on. 



I sniffled and nodded quickly, stuffing Jacob’s head into my backpack and quickly following behind him as he led me back toward the entrance of the hotel. I had one hope to get Jacob back. And that was Mama Dupont. I hoped and prayed that she’d be able to save him in some way. 



As me and Creole exited the hotel and reentered the voodoo shop I exited his office and turned the corner to see an unfamiliar person standing at the counter. He had brown hair, a grey hoodie, and a simple name tag on his chest. He looked up from his phone to look at me and was obviously confused as to where the hell I had just come from. 



“Travis mah boy! Don’t worry about her, she was just leaving. Right, Mace?” He ordered me, motioning me to shoo. I could take a hint, but I looked over at this dude, Travis, and instantly began to wonder what was going to happen to him. Every part of me wanted to yell and scream at him to just run away. But in the end, I just gave him a simple wave goodbye and exited Ol’ King Creole’s Half Priced Voodoo Store for the last time. Debt-free, but not unscarred. 



Mama Dupont was more than a little afraid of me when I stumbled back into her shop. Bleeding out of my shoulder and holding a severed head up at her and begging her to save Jacob. I ended up collapsing to the floor and passing out from blood loss. She fixed me up and when I woke up I was surprised to find Jacob standing before me, waving at me happily. He wasn’t exactly the same, his vertical stitches and stables were gone but his button eyes remained and he was about the same as when I first had seen him. 



“I had to use my last magic mannequin for him. They were a gift from my later mother, but I know that seeing what you have just been through she’d want you to have this as well, my love.” Mama Dupont told me as she walked over and rubbed my head carefully. I could do nothing but start crying uncontrollably and thank her a million times over. 



It took a lot of explaining from both myself and my dad to fill my mom in on everything that had happened to us. And also why I had this creepy mute bellhop with me now. But after a lot of arguing crying and a few broken windows, she accepted what had happened and was thankful that we had escaped. 



We decided to move as far away as possible from Creole and the voodoo shop. I decided to keep in touch with Mama Dupont as we became penpals and she continued to ensure that nothing bad happened to me or my family. Some of you might say it’s weird for me to keep Jacob around but I don’t care what any of you think. I’m free of that debt and I have something for a consolation prize. A protector and a best friend. 



I couldn’t have asked for a better ending. Well, I obviously could. I could’ve wished for my eye and fingers back. But I’ve learned the lesson of getting involved with wishes. At least this way, I’m not alone in the suffering that happened to me. And having Jacob helps me with all that. 



That’s really all I have to say. This was how I was indebted to a voodoo shop. And how I paid it all back. A pound of flesh and much traumatizing later. I’m debt free at last.
