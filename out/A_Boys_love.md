Another stormy night in same ol Oklahoma, as if the weather would be predictable tornado season, there was a young woman named Clemmie. She lived with her mother and younger siblings. Clem worked at a daycare center and was usually exhausted by the time she got home. One night, she was home alone and trying to get some rest before her morning shift. The storm outside was raging, and the sound of raindrops hitting the roof was deafening. But as she tried to sleep, she heard strange noises coming from different parts of the house. 

At first, she thought it was just her cat, Citrus, knocking things over or playing with objects around the house. But as the noises continued, she realized that Citrus was nowhere to be found. Clem got up to search for her cat and found the front door slightly ajar. She was sure she had locked it before going to bed. Terrified, she tried to close the door, but it wouldn't budge. 

Clem started to panic. She was alone, in the dark, and something was in the house with her. Suddenly, the power went out, and she was plunged into complete darkness. She reached for her phone to use the flashlight, but it was dead. She was alone and defenseless. 

As she sat in the darkness, she heard footsteps getting closer and closer. She cowered in fear, praying that it was just her imagination. But then she saw a figure moving towards her slowly, and she knew it was real. The figure was not human, it was something supernatural, something she had never seen before. 

Clem tried to run, but the creature was too fast. It caught her and dragged her into the darkness. Her screams echoed through the house, but no one could hear her. Her mother and siblings were away, and the storm was too loud. 

No help was coming, eventually the screaming would only tire her vocal cords out, and soon she's welcomed to the darkness before passing out.

Some time later....

Clemmie's eyes fluttered open, and she blinked several times to adjust to the darkness. She was lying on a hard, cold floor, and her head was throbbing. She tried to sit up, but her hands were tied behind her back. Fear crept in, and she realized that she had been kidnapped. 

Clem's heart raced as she looked around the room. The cabin was small and isolated, surrounded by dense woods. The windows were boarded up, and there was no sign of life outside. She could hear the sound of leaves rustling in the wind and the occasional hoot of an owl. 

She struggled to free herself from the ropes, but they were too tight. She tried to scream for help, but her voice was hoarse. She knew she had to find a way to escape before the creature returned. 

She heard a faint sound coming from outside the cabin. She listened closely and heard footsteps approaching. Panic set in as she realized that the creature that had taken her was back. She frantically searched the room for something to defend herself with but found nothing. 

The door creaked open, and a tall, dark figure entered the room. Clemmie's heart raced faster as she realized that it was the same creature that had taken her from her home. It was not human, not even close. Its skin was gray and mottled, and its eyes glowed a sickly green. 

Clem tried to scream, but the creature raised a finger to its lips, signaling her to be quiet. It approached her slowly, and she could smell its putrid breath. She closed her eyes, praying for it to be over quickly, but the attack she was anticipating for never arrived. She opened her eyes as the monster stares at her, not moving an inch, as if he was looking at something captivating, and tilts it's head so far and grotesquely till a bone snapped but not even the monster flinched from it. Seconds became mins, till she closed her eyes begging for it to end, and so it did.

Clem's opened her eyes again, but there was no monster, she wasn't even where she was, she's just in her warm bed. She sat up, panting heavily. She looked around her room, and everything was as it was before. She wondered if it was all a dream, but the memory of the creature's touch was still fresh in her mind. 

She couldn't forget, she had to tell someone, soon she got a call from her phone... Somehow it was put to charge, and the caller ID said Ángel her boyfriend of three years. She answered and almost cried and begged him to come over.

After waiting an hour, he arrived, she brought him to her room, and sat on her bed, as she explained the horrors she experienced that felt too real to be a dream. Ángel listened and absorbed every knowledge, he didn't even try to convince her it was real, in fact he believed her, and said yes it was real.
She always loved Ángel, he was always the rock in her life, and she could look at his face and somehow her worries always faded away....until now.

Clem's heart skipped a beat as she looked into Ángel's eyes. She had always admired his brown eyes, but now they glowed a sickly green, just like the creature that had taken her. She couldn't believe what she was seeing, and her mind raced to make sense of it all. 

Ángel looked at her frozen face with a mixture of sadness and hunger in his eyes. "You didn't have to run before," he said as he slowly tilts his head. "It was only me." 

She backed away slowly, tears streaming down her face. She couldn't believe that the boy she had loved and dated for three years was a monster, and she was his prey. She felt trapped, with no way out. 

Ángel stepped closer to her, and quickly she tried to run, but she was too slow. He grabbed her by the arm and pulled her towards him. She struggled to break free, but he was strong. 

Ángel's grip tightened, and Clem felt a sharp pain in her neck. She screamed, but it was too late. Ángel had bitten her, and she knew that she was doomed. 

Clem's vision blurred, and she felt her body weakening. She looked up at Ángel, who was now grinning with satisfaction. "You're mine now," he said. 

Clemmie's world went black, and she knew that she would never escape the monster that had once been her boyfriend. Her fate was sealed, and she was now a part of the darkness that had consumed Ángel. 

As dawn broke, Clem's family returned home, and they found her lifeless body lying on the bed. Her mother screamed, and her siblings cried, but it was too late. She was gone, and there was nothing anyone could do to bring her back. 

Oklahoma, was once again haunted by a tragedy, but this time it was not by a supernatural being. It was by the darkness that lurked within Ángel, the monster that had once been a boy in love.
