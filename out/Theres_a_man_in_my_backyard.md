I’ve lived in my current place for a little over five years. It’s small, but I’m single so it’s always felt like enough space for me. The yard is similarly tiny, but I’ve got a metal table and a couple of chairs out there so I can sit and drink beer with my friend Gray. Usually, I sit and drink alone. Not in a depressing way. I just like to sit there of an evening and listen to the sounds of nature. It’s peaceful. It’s how I like to unwind after a rough day. How I liked to unwind. Anyway, I’m getting older and I wanted somewhere bigger. Somewhere I could start a family. Somewhere I owned. Or, at least, somewhere I paid the bank to live rather than a landlord. So, I started looking for a place.

My budget was meagre, but my needs were short. Two bed, one bath, a yard of any size and far enough from a major road that I could hear the birds, while close enough that my commute wasn’t awful. As it turns out, that actually was quite a lot to ask for and places that met my criteria were few and far between. I’d get home from work – I work in customer service for a company I’m not gonna name so I don’t lose my job – and start house hunting. That became my life. Office – work – home – search. It was an intolerable weight on my soul and I would spend the twilight hours outside to repair myself. As my search became less fruitful, with property’s being taken off the market between me finding the listing and placing a call to the realtor, I admit I slipped into despair. I had made getting a house the cornerstone of my new life. Without that, it felt like I would never be able to do anything. 

It was a few days after that when I saw the listing for the property. I didn’t understand how I hadn’t seen it before, it had been on the market for about a month and was nearly perfect for my needs. It would increase my commute by about thirty minutes each way, but I was more than happy with that. When I rang the realtor there was no answer and I realised it was near ten at night. I went to bed and called them first thing the next morning.

“Good morning, you’re through to Todd at Last Home Realty, where we’ve got the last home you’ll ever need!” The guy had full customer service voice. You know the one, overly chipper and so eager to help it was almost desperate. That, combined with the frankly off-putting name of the realtor’s and I was having some doubts.

“Hey, I’m calling about your property on Cedar Street in-”

“That one?” He cut me off. He no longer sounded chipper, just...confused.

“Yeah, why?” I could tell already the issue. “Is it already sold?”

“No, no, no.” He reassured me, forcing a laugh. “It’s just...”

“Yeah?”

“The owner is a little kooky.” He sighed, and I thought of all the weird people I had to deal with in my job. The angry ones who called up demanding a replacement because the product was faulty, only for you to discover through gentle prodding that they hadn’t charged it. Ever. 

“Kooky how?” I could handle a little kooky if he was gonna sell me a house.

“Oh, you know, just kooky. Odd little habits, nothing bad.” He reassured me. I could hear the salesman return to his voice, playing things down. He really wanted to get this property off his books. “So, you want me to book you in?”

“Sure.” I said. 

“One thing: the owner said he won’t sell the house unless he’s vetted the buyer.”

“Vetted?”

“Yeah, man, I told you he’s kooky. He’ll be there when I show you the house, might ask you a question or two, like what you do for work, or who’s your favorite team.” I smiled at that, this old kook sounded fun. Wanting to make sure his house didn’t go to someone who supported his rivals.  


We set a date and I booked some time off work to head over there. It was 35°, which was sweltering for a January as I headed out for cedar drive. The property looked even better in person than it did online. Whitewashed walls and a slate roof that looked brand new. A man in his middle years with a gut approaching the unhealthy end of the spectrum stood on the porch. He had a goatee and was wearing a winter coat and mittens, which I thought was overkill. Maybe he wasn’t a native. I parked up and hopped out of my car, giving a wave to the man who could only have been Todd. He looked surprised for a moment, before holding up one mittened hand. 

“You made it! Was afraid I’d scared you off!” Again, he gave that nervous laugh. 

“Nope, not yet. You wanna step inside?” I gestured for the door; it was very clear Todd was not built to be standing around outside. He nodded gratefully and opened the door.

“Hi, Mr Lansley, just me.” Todd called. There was a harumph from deeper inside, presumably Mr Lansley.

“Another No-show!” He grumbled.

“Oh, no, no. John is here too!” Todd gave me an apologetic look. I stepped inside and was hit by a wall of heat. Despite this, Todd waited until I’d shut the door before removing his gloves and unzipping his jacket. 

“I’m in the kitchen” Mr Lansley called. “Bring him in.” The way he said it gave me a shiver which I blamed on the cold outside. We headed straight into the kitchen. I have to admit, it was beautiful. At least twice the size of mine, granite counter tops and stone floors. It was like a show kitchen. I ignored the men in the room and just envisioned making breakfast in here. Bacon and eggs, or pancakes, or just big bowls of cereal for myself and my wife and our kids. It felt right. Of course, I had to get the wife and have the kids, but at least I’d have the kitchen for it. Mr Lansley noisily cleared his throat, clearly unhappy with my daydreaming. He was a head shorter than me, with grey scraggly hair and a dark scar running the length of his neck. 

“Karl Lansley” He extended a thick-knuckled hand.

“John.” I shook his hand, but he didn’t release his grip. Just squinted at me. I knew what he wanted, but I really didn’t want to tell him my surname. Not because I was scared, I just preferred not to tell people my full name. It always became this whole thing.

“You’re not going to believe this” Todd said and I sighed inwardly. “It’s John Wayne.” He guffawed like a moron and, after a tense moment, so did Mr Lansley. He released my hand.

“Well, I guess I can see why you’d be hesitant to tell me. Pilgrim.” He jabbed me in the ribs at the last. There it was. Every time, without fail. I looked away from him, turning my attention to the window. It almost looked like a bay window, how deep set it was, and it looked out over an immaculate lawn with a potting shed at the end. 

“Does the shed come with the property?” I asked, eager to get away from the subject of my name. 

“Hmm?” He followed my gaze out the window. “Ah. You can have her if you want her. Not sure she’d survive the move anyway. Go on then, do your little speech.” He waved his hands at Todd who dutifully dropped into his explanation of the key features of the kitchen and how any drawbacks were really advantages I’d be gaining. I was only half listening. I tested the cupboard doors, which had a satisfying soft-close, before returning my attention to the garden. More than enough space for my crappy furniture. I could even get nice furniture for out there. Put in some bird feeders, maybe plant a tree at the far end opposite the shed. Even in the depths of winter it would be beautiful. Then, from the corner of my eye, I thought I saw someone in the potting shed. I glanced over but couldn’t see anyone.

“You really like that potting shed, eh? You a gardener?” Mr Lansley asked.

“No, customer service.” I replied mindlessly, still trying to spot anyone. I must have looked like an idiot, moving my head side to side and up and down to try and get an angle where I could see them.
 
“Everything ok?” Todd asked, having finished or maybe just abandoned his patter. 

“Fine, yeah. Thought I saw someone in the yard. Must have been a trick of the light.” I turned back to face Todd and Mr Lansley, affecting a smile. Mr Lansley’s face had gone flat and his eyes unfocused.

“I think you’d best leave.” He sounded hoarse.

“Oh, don’t you think he ought to see the rest of the place first?” Todd tried desperately, but he seemed to know it was hopeless. Mr Lansley didn’t say anything else, just turned and slowly walked out of the kitchen. A few moments later I heard him ascending the stairs. Todd threw a hand around my shoulder and began guiding me back to the front door. He looked utterly embarrassed. 

“I’m sorry. He’s not normally that bad, but he won’t sway on these things. I’ve got plenty of other properties I can show you in the area, I’m sure one will fit the bill.” We reached the door and Todd stopped to do up his coat and replace his mittens.

“Yeah, yeah we’ll talk about it.” I said, but I doubted he had anywhere like this in my price range. “I’ve gotta get back to work.”

Todd saw me to my car, apologising the whole way, and waved me off. Through my mirror I saw him look back to the house and shake his head in defeat. Well, I thought as I drove back to work, Todd had at least been honest with me about the current owner. Mr Lansley was a kook. My life returned to the same rigmarole, only now there was the added topping of disappointment that I’d found somewhere perfect, but the owner wouldn’t sell to me.
 

It was about a week after that viewing that things started to happen. I hadn’t sat out in my yard since then, the cold and the listlessness kept me firmly indoors besides work. I was even getting groceries delivered. One night I woke up at about 2am, and couldn’t get back to sleep. I decided to grab myself a snack and maybe a drink, just give myself twenty minutes to be up and out of bed before I tried to sleep again. I walked into my kitchen and saw it. It was standing in my yard against the fence.  In the darkness I couldn’t make out any details, but it was definitely a person. A person standing in my yard in the middle of the night. I felt like something was crawling on my skin. I flipped on the light to get a better look at them, but the dark outside meant it just turned my windows into a mirror. I quickly flipped the lights back off and waited for my eyes to adjust. He was gone. I guessed the light had scared him off. I took some deep breaths and tried to steady my heart before I flipped the light back on. Then, just to quiet my mind, I made sure my doors and windows were shut and locked and flipped on all my lights to check my house. Not the most rational of actions, but it made me fell a whole lot better. I didn’t bother getting myself a snack and it took longer than twenty minutes before I felt comfortable going back to bed. 


The next day I tried to chalk it up to my imagination. It was late; I was tired. I peaked tentatively into my kitchen in case I saw the figure in my yard, but it was mercifully empty. And, as the day went on, it became easier to dismiss. Work helped scrub away the sharp edges of terror the night had caused too. We’d received a brief that a product recall was being issued. There was an all hands for the CS team to prepare us. It wasn’t my first time with a recall, and it was always the same. If someone rang to complain: apologise, reassure, downplay, and most importantly confirm nothing. So, that’s what I did for the next ten hours. I lied through my teeth to concerned customers, assuring them it was just a precaution because the device didn’t hold up to our internal standards of quality. I dodged any questions about what, exactly, was wrong or the potential issues it could cause. I didn’t have to lie about that bit: I didn’t know what the issue really was. They hadn’t told us. They never did. But I do know that no company does something out of kindness; if they were issuing a recall its because there were potential lawsuits and fines they wanted to avoid. I got home that night exhausted and crashed straight into bed. I woke up feeling too exhausted for having slept 8 hours. I grabbed a bagel and poured some coffee into my flask and headed out. It had obviously rained overnight and my front lawn looked like a bog. I sighed and made a mental note to spike it when I got back from work to help it drain. 

Work was second verse, same as the first. Call after call after call of concerned customers. I must've fielded fifty calls by the time I left. The whole drive home all I could think about was curling up in bed again. I’m not super outgoing by nature and speaking to that many people, even if they were all polite (which they weren’t),  was exhausting for me. I parked up and saw my lawn and remembered I needed to spike it. 

“I’ll do it tomorrow.” I mumbled and headed inside. It’s the procrastinator's mantra, I know, but I did move my alarm back ten minutes to give me time to do it before work. I microwaved a pizza and ate it while watching tv. I was so exhausted I fell asleep in my recliner without even making it to bed. I awoke with a start several hours later as a gunshot rang out. The panic lasted only a moment before I realised it was the tv. There he was on the screen, the bane of my life up to that point, with his signature swagger. His real name was Marion, you know that? 

“The Duke.” I huffed mockingly as I switched the movie off. I headed for the kitchen to grab a drink and stopped dead in the hall. The memory of two nights before returned. I’ll admit it, my heart began to race. Maybe it hadn’t really slowed since I started awake. I decided to skip the drink and head up to bed, pretending it was a decision based on anything other than fear.
 
My alarm woke me bright and early at 5:45 and I barely resisted the urge to snooze it. Yes, I have my alarm set to 5:55 normally, sue me. I got up, got dressed, and headed downstairs. I grabbed my rake which I keep in the cupboard by the back door and went to aerate my yard. I stabbed at the grass dumbly, I knew this was supposed to help but not how or why. It wasn’t a job that would take long, again neither my front nor my back yard were large and pretty quickly I found myself at the fence line. That’s when I saw the footprints. They were deep and clear, as if someone had stood there very still for a long time before carefully moving away. Except, there were only two prints. They were right at the back against the fence and faced my house, my kitchen window. As if someone had hopped the fence and then stood there looking into my kitchen before...before what? Executing a standing backwards leap that allowed him to clear my 7 foot fence? Having an accomplice hoist him up? It wasn’t that I thought it had to be something supernatural that had happened. It was just that every natural explanation sounded just as outlandish. I thought back to the figure I’d seen, disappearing in an instant. It had been easy to doubt my memory of the event, but these impressions in the mud were very real. 

I went back inside and called in sick from work, didn’t say what it was, just that I couldn’t make it in. In spite of all the stress I was feeling I have to admit I enjoyed using the same evasive tactics on my boss that he made us use on our customers. Then I called the cops. I didn’t know what was happening. But it had to be some kind of crime. Hopefully.

The officer who responded to my call was less than impressed with my story. He had his hands folded over his chest, twiddling his thumbs. His face set a bored cast as I recounted events. 

“You think a guy was hiding in a potting shed in Dexter, and has followed you home.” He paused, and I could tell how deeply he despised me for wasting his time. “To stand in your yard. Am I getting this right?”

“I don’t know.” I tried my best to not sound crazy. I wasn’t convinced, so why would he be? “But there was definitely someone in my yard, there’s footprints!” He cocked an eyebrow at that and actually seemed halfway intrigued as I guided him outside to see the footprints. I squeezed my fists tight and prayed they were still there. That I hadn’t imagined it. 

The cop squatted by the prints and scratched his cheek in thought. “Boots on poles.” He announced at last, groaning as he stood.

“Boots on poles?” I repeated back to him because I must have misheard. That was stupider than my gymnast hypothesis. 

“Oh yeah. Seen it before. Kids do it to mess with folk. Old pair of shoes, plaster, and some sticks.” He shrugged and started walking to the gate. 

“Wait, should I call you if they come back?” I asked. He shrugged again but didn’t turn around.

“If you want.” 

I didn’t go back to work that day. I wasn’t exactly reassured by the police response. So, to ease my mind I drove to the nearest box store and picked up a floodlight with a motion sensor. 6000 lumens would hopefully be enough to deter any would-be prankster. I came home invigorated and rushed to get it installed. Turns out those outside lights need wiring in, most aren’t battery powered so I then had to call an electrician. I managed to get someone out the same day by paying a stupid amount of money. I needed the light up before I’d feel comfortable sleeping there again. Once it was installed I gave it a test and frowned as nothing happened. Then the electrician explained it wouldn’t come on until a sensor determined it was dark. Smart.

Gray came over that evening after work and we sat outside drinking and shooting the shit. The sun was setting and I leaned back in my chair, setting off the sensor and temporarily blinding us.

“The fuck is that?” Gray said, blinking until he could see again. 

“New floodlight.”

“Oh cool. So when are the Lions playing here?” 

“Uh, yeah.” I laughed nervously, thinking about the reason I’d installed the floodlight. I took a deep breath, figuring telling my best friend might help. He’d rib me for it, but maybe that would help?

“Boots on poles?” Gray laughed when I told him. “Tell a stupid cop...” he shook his head. I tried to join in with his laughter but even I thought it sounded forced. I took a long sip of beer to cover it. 

“It probably is just asshole kids, though.” He added after an uncomfortable silence. “I mean, when I was 14 me and my friends used to leave mangos on this dude's porch every night.” 

“Mangos?” 

He laughed, a deep sudden bark, as if the memory had returned to him sharply. “Yeah man, mangos. 4 or 5 each night for, like, two months. By the end, poor guy would sit on his porch with a shotgun. God, we must have scarred him for life.”

“So, is that why you stopped?”

“What?”

“The shotgun.”

“Ohhh haha, nah. We’d just wait until he fell asleep and carefully put them down next to him. We stopped because mangos are expensive!” 

By the time he left we were both too drunk for a weeknight and it had to be past midnight. But, I admit I was feeling better. I waved him off as his taxi pulled away and headed to my kitchen to grab some water. My hand hovered over the light switch but I was frozen. My heart, meanwhile, was making an effort to tear free of my ribcage. He was there again, outside my window. Right outside my window. He had a gaunt face and large eyes that were staring blankly at me. We’d been sat out there just minutes ago and now there he was. I couldn’t look away, I didn’t want to know what he might do when I wasn’t watching. There was an air of anticipation around him, the insinuation of a smile on his too wide lips. 

Then he was gone. I must have blinked. I stared in disbelief at my now empty yard still not daring to move. The floodlight hadn’t turned on. Why hadn’t the floodlight turned on? I didn’t want to spend another night in that house, but it was late and I was drunk. So, I steeled my nerves as best I could and grabbed a knife from the kitchen. Then I searched my house, making sure the doors and windows were closed and locked and he wasn’t inside somehow. When I was sure I was alone, I shut the curtains in my living room and dropped against the wall, clutching the knife tightly in my hands. I didn’t sleep. I didn’t want to sleep. As soon as the sun was up I left, just started walking into town, glancing behind me just in case. I pulled out my phone and hesitated on who to call. There was only one person who could make me feel safe right now. 

“Mom?” I asked when she picked up. There was a yawn.

“You’re up early.” She said.

“Sorry, did I wake you?”

“Are you ok, sweetie, you sound scared.” Concern was already creeping into her voice.

“Yeah, I’m fine. But, would you mind if I stayed with you and Dad for a while?” I felt like a failure for needing to ask them. I felt like a child for being scared out of my house. But I needed to feel safe. 

“Of course! You’re always welcome here, but you’re scaring me. Has something happened?” 

I told her briefly about the man in my yard, leaving out those pieces I couldn’t square in my mind. 

“You go grab a coffee- no, something without caffeine. Your father will pick you up in twenty minutes” there was a groan of protest from my Dad. “Thirty minutes. Love you.”

“Love you, Mom.” I wiped my eyes. 


I’ve been staying with my parents for a couple weeks, in my old room. I can see the backyard from the window, the rusty swing set was still there. It had been old when I was growing up, bought for my dad as a kid. I doubt anyone had even used it since my sister moved out. It was comforting to see that it was still there. Like there was still some stability in the world. I told my landlord I’d continue paying rent until my lease was up, but I wouldn’t be returning. My Dad enlisted Gray to retrieve my things from the house, most of which are now taking up space in my parent's garage. I’ve not been sleeping great. Every time I’m drifting off, I see that face, the way his lips twitched as if he was about to smile just before he disappeared. It’s effecting my work. It’s effecting everything. I keep staring out into the yard, convinced I’m gonna find him there, looking up at me
