"So...this is the place?" I asked as I looked at the poorly handmade sign. It read "Webberson Famly Corn Maze!" in big letters, painted with red paint. "This looks so run down.." I criticized. Oh, come on Brandon!" Sammy said. rubbing my hair softly. It was sorta his idea after all.

He showed me the cutout advertisement discussing the corn maze during lunchtime. He said we could try doing the maze for Halloween. I looked at him with questioning eyes as I ate my jelly sandwich. He insisted we go, and after a bit of pleading, I finally caved in and agreed to go to the maze with him. He was so happy.

We stood in front of the corn maze. Sammy stood with a bold and confident expression while I had an unsure and confused expression. "So wanna go first?" Sammy said playfully. "What? No way, you first." I sarcastically replied. 

3 minutes later, we were in a simple battle of rock paper scissors to decide who would be entering the maze. I was good at that game, and so was Sammy. But by some insane stroke of luck, I managed to win. "Damn! You win!" Sammy said cheerfully. 

Before entering the maze, he said “See you on the other side!” As he gently rubbed and patted my head before entering the maze while waving his hand, as he took the first turn left. I just smiled at his response. Sammy’s always treated me like his little brother, I don’t know why he would befriend someone like me. He was very popular, academic, athletic and social, like I was the guy who liked to do art related things like painting and digital artwork. I didn’t like socializing though. Maybe he saw potential in me? Or does he just want to be kind to look good, the reason I don’t know to this day.

Anyways I go to the end of the corn maze and wait for him there. I decided to text him after he was 15 minutes in. 

**”Having fun?”**

**”Yeah! This maze is fricking huge! It’s gonna take a while for me to get out of here!“**

**”Alright, try to find your way out, don’t stay around for too long.”**

**”Got it!”**

I turned off my phone and enjoyed the crisp autumn air as my dark brown curly hair flowed within it. 

I looked at the time. One hour passed by and I began to feel confused as to why Sammy hasn’t come out of the maze yet. Yeah it was a bit large, but it wasn’t that large for someone to not get lost in it. I decided to text him, asking what’s taking so long. Sammy doesn’t take this long to navigate mazes like this. 

**”Hey, Sammy, is everything okay in there? How’s it going for you?”** 

No reply. 

I bit my finger slightly and started to go back and forth. It was about 8:00 PM now. Sammy was literally gone for about 2 hours now. What the hell is he doing? I was about to dial 9-1-1 but as I was about to dial the last number I heard leaves crunching.

I looked up to see Sammy standing before me. He was out of the maze. “Sammy! Where the heck have you’ve been?!” I said, rushing over to hug him. But he just stood still. Not responding in his cheerful tone, nor did he even react to me hugging him. He just, stood still with a blank expression.

I looked up, and saw that his skin was half pale, and his eyes were the dark purple. No trace of what was once his normal brown eyes. Along with that, there was no light in his eyes. None. I stood back a bit in sheer confusion. “Sammy?” I questioned, confusion and concern in my eyes. He just looked down at me and just said “Shall we go back Brandon?”. He said it so calmly and coldly that it sent shivers down my spine.

The car ride home was silent torture. He just wore the same expression I saw when he got out of the maze. I shook as I sat next to him. “Hey, so uh, how was the maze?” I nervously asked him. He didn’t reply to me. Nor did he make a single gesture to answer. He dropped me off at my house and then went to his house which was a block away.

School wasn’t any better after that day. Sammy behaved normally, he was doing good as usual, but he still wore that same cold expression. His skin was still half pale, and his friends slowly started to feel afraid of him just by his presence. He acted the same way Sammy would usually behave. He dressed the same way Sammy would dress. He would do good in his classes just like how Sammy did. It just felt like he was on autopilot the entire time. Not feeling anything.

Of course, his parents tried seeking him help, but none of the doctors or therapists would find what was wrong with him. Yet they came up empty handed. He still continues to stay at my high school. I still try to communicate to him, to try and get to him one somehow. But he just stared at me with his cold expression.

I don’t know why he’s like this now, but the only question I still hold onto is, **what the hell happened to Sammy inside that corn maze?**
