It was a stormy night in London.  The wind howled, the sun slept and the moon took over but the people of London were still awake.  Although bad weather is not uncommon in London, this time was different.  many of my friends and I had been invited to a party that night, so we left hoping to have a good time.

 As soon as we arrived at the party, it looked like no one was happy or even having fun, people's faces were neutral in a bad way.

 Everyone stared straight ahead, without even blinking, emotionless.  I was scared, I knew something had gone into these people but I didn't know what.  I thought I would stay a little longer to see if this was some kind of terrible prank and have some fun with my friends who were with me.  But before I knew it, I turned to go get my friends.  They all looked lifeless like everyone else.

 I was scared, I was very scared.  I ducked into the bathroom and locked the door to think about what was going on.  As I looked out the bathroom window, I noticed a crow hovering right in front of me.  This party was taking place in someone's penthouse on the 27th floor of a building right next to the Tower of London.  So I knew something was wrong.

 As I splashed water on my face in the bathroom, I heard a loud thump coming from the living room where the party was taking place.  I left the bathroom to investigate.  I saw about 4 boys trying to break the window.  This confused me and I didn't know why, until one of the boys climbed in and threw himself out the open window without hesitation.

 Seconds after he did this, the crow I had just seen through the bathroom window passed by where the boy had jumped to kill himself.  The crow came over my shoulder and it was almost like it was whispering something in my ear, but I couldn't tell what.

 At that moment I felt like I was dreaming, I tried to pinch myself in the corners but came to the conclusion that I was awake.  These people were walking around like suicidal zombies.  suddenly out of nowhere, a transparent black figure emerged from nothing, followed by a huge clap of thunder.

 The spirit had no mouth but I could still hear it speak.  He says, â€œI am the spirit of depression, I am here to free your friends from their misery by pushing them to end their lives.  You may think what I am is bad but believe me I am helping these young people to end the suffering but you Samael you are a badass it seems I can't own you  for some reasons.

  I remained silent and held back my fear, until he continued and said "Well, I have a job to finish, I'll come back to get you later"

 I ran away as soon as possible hoping to get home before it was too late for my parents to leave as soon as possible.  I was running all twenty-seven floors as fast as I could, adrenaline racing through my veins as I walked home.

 As soon as I got home my door was open the car was gone and no one was home I knew it was too late I was soaked in the rain I had run home  but it was for nothing.

 I felt sad and lonely and depressed, I waited there silently on my bed for the spirit to come get me.  I knew it was the end.  Suddenly I heard a noise that was unfamiliar, I heard screams coming from every corner of my street until finally I heard a voice saying "you know what to do".
