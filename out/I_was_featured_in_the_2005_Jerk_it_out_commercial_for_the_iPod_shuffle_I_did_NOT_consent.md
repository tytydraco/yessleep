They called it The Peter Pan Project. 

I was tired from class that day, so I thought I was hallucinating the ad on the back of the magazine in my roommate's hands. Initially, I had been curious about the "MISSING PS2" notice which was taking up half of the page. (How do you lose a PS2?) But then my gaze was wandering, settling on bolded letters jumping out at me. 

**ARE YOU 18-25? 
NEED CASH? 
JOIN THE PETER PAN PROJECT.**

I was intrigued, half sitting up on my bed. 

"Leela."

Lying on her back on the bed opposite me, my roommate offered a grumble as a reply, turning the pages a little too violently. I admired her commitment to dye her hair every week. That day, it was cotton candy blue and pink. After rotting in bed all day, her pigtails were hanging on by a thread. "I'm reading."

"Yeah, but can you show me the back?" 

She peered over the magazine, one eyebrow cocked. "Aren't you supposed to be at the library?" 

"It's closed," I said. "It's Friday, remember?" 

"Oh."

Leela usually scanned the campus magazine for either jobs, gossip, or better rooms. We had a resident rat in ours, whom we had affectionately named PJ, after he broke into Leela's peanut butter. My focus flicked back to the ad on the back of the magazine, and I had to tilt my head to see it properly. 

Leela's manicure was in the way. "Hey, can you…" leaning forward, I peered at the back. Leela gave up trying to read after a moment. She sat up with a sigh, slapping it down on my bed with way too much emphasis. I could tell she was in a bad mood from the state of our room. Her clothes were strewn all over the floor, her bed, and my bed, while her books were a tripping hazard. 

Boyfriend problems, I figured. She stood up and stretched, standing on her tiptoes. "Oh, sure, go ahead," Leela was speaking fluent sarcasm as usual. 

Leela was hard to understand, initially. She swung both ways,  bringing in girls and guys, but was hung up on one guy in particular, who was the teenage equivalent of Will Ferrel. Not funny, and fucking annoying. He still had my Buffy DVD, after I asked him multiple times for it back. He picked his nose (and his butt) and the constant loud sex every  night drove me insane. Leela, however, was smitten. My roommate headed to our janky door and pulled it open. I could  hear someone violently throwing up down the hall. Leela pulled a face. "It's not like I was *trying* to read a freak out."

I looked up from the ad. "Freak out?" 

She shrugged, picking up the magazine, flipping it around to show me. Our campus magazine wasn't the same after the printing ban. Whoever had printed 560 copies of Britney Spears was probably still in hiding. The magazine was poorly made, with some of the pages scraps of paper taped together. 

It was kind of cute. "Page seven," Leela tapped the page with her nail, and I reluctantly followed her finger. 

"Anonymous wrote about the bathroom being inhumane. A toaster has been stolen, drugs found in someone's backpack… ooh, also, someone is convinced their whole floor has asbestos poisoning." She ignored my snorting noise. "Apparently they've all been, like, super sick. They're too scared to go to the Dean, so of course they go to the college magazine, who definitely aren't raging conspiracy theorists." 

She was right about that. Last month's issue was a six page exclusive on the moon landing being faked. Asbestos poisoning, however, was a clever one. 

"It sounds like bad food poisoning," I muttered. 

"Yep." Leela popped the P. "I can bet it's raw chicken. Asbestos is wild, though." she slipped through the door. I could hear her rattling around looking for PJ under his usual hiding place. "How do you delude yourself into believing that?" she shouted through, laughing. "A whole group of them too!" 

I glanced up from the magazine when I heard Leela throwing on her jacket. I already had the magazine on my knee, my eyes glued to the ad. I was strapped for cash, and these people were offering me free money. "Where are you going?" 

My roommate slipped her head through the door, her lips stretched into a grin. "Guess."

Studying her in the doorway, sticking out her butt teasingly, I couldn't resist my own smile. Bright blue eyeshadow, her favorite denim skirt, and the leather jacket without the hole in the sleeve. 

"Liam," I said dryly, failing to hide my disdain. 

Leela's smile widened. "You love him! You guys have the same taste in TV!" 

"He stole my Buffy DVD." 

"You gave it to him." 

I looked up, settling her with a patient smile. Liam was good at manipulating her. "Yeah, and he never gave it back!" 

Leela rolled her eyes. "Well… I'm sure he has it somewhere," she spoke through the hair tie in her mouth. "I'll ask him about it, okay? He's sooooo nice, and I'm sure he'll buy you a new one!"

That was the nail in the coffin. I was never seeing that DVD again. 

"Tell him I want it by Friday," I said, flipping to the back of the magazine. "or I'm adding interest every week."

I didn't hear Leela's reply, only the slam of our door. I was already invested in the ad. Before I consciously knew what I was doing, I was throwing on my sweater. The location on the ad wasn't far from my dorms, just a bus ride. I had a map in my backpack, and my phone if I ran into trouble. It was early evening when I jumped onto a bus, the ripped out advert stuffed in my pocket. 

What I wasn't expecting was what looked like an abandoned dental surgery. 

The Peter Pan Project. 

I was starting to over think.

Kids who don't grow up... was that my fate? 

When I walked through plastic flaps being used as a door, I started to regret my spontaneous decision. *I was broke*, I thought, glancing around the empty reception area. There were abandoned dentist chairs and instruments scattering the floor, scraps of posters brandishing wide smiles still stuck to the walls. I could make out shouting coming through the door, a pop song blasting. But was I *this* broke? There was a single unmanned wooden desk, a small notice taped to the side. "**PETER PAN PROJECT VOLUNTEERS, PLEASE WAIT HERE."**

So, I did, uncomfortably crossing my legs. 

After five minutes of standing like an idiot, a woman finally rushed through the door, looking frenzied. She looked me up and down, blatantly, before her gaze found the clipboard clutched to her chest. This woman was the embodiment of stress. I could tell she had been pulling her hair out. Her smile was polite and strained. I couldn't stop staring at the bald patch she was failing to hide under her ponytail. She kept shooting the door panicked glances, like a monster was about to come hurtling through. "Are you here as a volunteer?"

"Uh, yes." I said, "Hey, so was the cash thing serious?" 

She nodded. "Five hundred dollars per shadow, yes," she wrote something on the clipboard. "What is your full name?" 

Her words confused me. "Per what?" 

"Name," she said again, unfazed. Another wary look towards the door, and my stomach twisted. What was through that door that turned this woman into a nervous wreck? I noticed she tightened her grip on the pen, her writing growing frenzied. "I need your name so I can prepare the payment."

"Emma," I said, fast enough for her to raise her eyebrow. "Emma Carrington."

The woman nodded, scribbling. The scratching of her pen on paper made me wince. "Date of birth?" 

"October 25th, 1987."

She hummed, writing that too, before lifting her gaze to me. She smiled a smile we both knew was fake. "Okay! Why don't you follow me inside?" She led me toward the door. "Have you ever participated in a commercial before?"

"Commercial?" 

"Yes," the woman's tone didn't match her wide smile. "You will all be participating in an… innovative commercial. It will be great fun, I promise!" her pale cheeks and the shudder in her hands she was trying to hide, was not reassuring. In fact, I wanted out of there. My gaze zeroed in on a scalpel on the floor, and I took a step back with intention to turn and walk out. Screw the 500 dollars, I had no idea what I was giving myself to. 

When I tried to tell her I had changed my mind, however, the woman pretended not to hear me, politely ushering me across the room. Her hands were on my shoulders. 

Gentle, but firm. 

"Emma, it will not take long," she said, like I was a petulant child. "You're going to have fun! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for all volunteers!" 

I stumbled when she shoved me through the door. Before I could answer, I found myself in a large room where a stage and green screen had been set up, cameras and floodlights everywhere. Shading my eyes from the light, I could see what looked like a full set. The music was too loud, slamming into my ears. The place reminded me of a modelling studio. 

The knot in my gut started to loosen. I was told to take off my shoes and jacket, and the woman was taking them and handing them to her assistant. The stage was empty, the crew fumbling around screaming at each other. Across the hall was a bench, where several college students were sitting. I noticed none of them were speaking, either smiling like they had just taken one hell of a drug, or staring into oblivion, heads lolled. I must have looked freaked out, because the woman chuckled. "Don't worry about them," she said in a hiss. "Every reaction is different, though a common one is feeling exactly how they are feeling."

I eyed a curly haired girl, who's head dropped into her lap, her body following suit, crumpling on the floor. 

The others barely reacted. 

A boy in a baseball cap followed, his eyes rolling back before nose diving onto Curly Hair. 

I couldn't help myself.  "They don't look great."

"They're just feeling faint," I could tell the woman was starting to panic. She laughed when I opened my mouth to ask for my phone. "It's a completely normal reaction!" she pointed to them, her lip curling. "See? They're fine. A little pale and sickly, but that's just–" another crash, and a blonde ponytail had dropped, almost comically, on top of the other three, making a sandwich. 

"The side effects!" her tone grew shrill, when the last boy  standing (or sitting) fell backwards into a heap, hitting his head on the wall. He didn't wake up, slipping to the floor, curling into a ball. 

They reminded me of kindergartens at nap time. 

The craziest thing was, neither of them were acknowledged until the woman barked, "Can someone *please* get those students out of here?" 

Her assistant hurried to help them, or "Clean up the mess" as she delicately put it. I watched the youngish man haul each of them onto his back, taking them into a back room. He didn't call the police or a medic. I don't even think he checked to see if they were still alive. 

"Emma?" the woman wasn't even watching the unconscious students being dragged away. Her gaze was on me, while I was staring at her assistant dragging one of the guys by his ankles. 

"I'm okay," I finally said in a whisper. "I don't want to…" I didn't realize how terrified I was until my voice started to shake, my eyes stinging. "Can I go home?"

I turned around, only for rough hands to pull me back to face eyes I had no idea were hollowed out until I found them, enveloped in my own fear, my own oblivion suffocating me. I saw desperation. No humanity. Just a cog in a machine. Her expression was wild, lips twisted. I thought she was going to at least soften her tone. Instead, though, her eyes darkened. The woman introduced herself as Anna Siri, throwing a piece of paper in my face. 

"Don't be a baby," she hissed, saliva hitting my cheek. "Those kids you saw were our first batch, Emma. It's an exhausting shoot, so of course they're going to be struggling to stay awake."

"They collapsed," I managed to get out. 

She nodded patiently. "They did! And as you saw, my assistant has taken them to see the medic. They are fine, Emma."

"Siri!" 

One of the camera operators turned to her. "We need a second batch. Now."

Anna was in a rush, yelling across the hall, and I had no time to breathe, no time to try and get away or argue with this manicical lady who was trying and failing to hide an elephant in the room that I could not see. I could, however, see its effects. The collapsing kids, and her behavior told me to run. When I scanned for an exit, I saw two guards standing in front of the door we had come through.

Anna was practically vibrating on the spot, eager for me to sign. "Yes, I have another one!" she shouted, while I was struggling to sign my name at the bottom. The crew were pressuring her, repeatedly telling her they were ready. 

"Sign at the bottom, and we'll get you processed, Emma," she said, breathlessly. I didn't have time to squint through the small print, which was intentionally blurred together. Anna grabbed my arm, securing her hold, and pulling me towards a door on the other side of the room. "It doesn't hurt!" she said cheerfully. But she wasn't looking at me, her grip tightening on my elbow. "I would say it's just like a pinch! Just close your eyes, count to ten, no, twenty, or maybe thirty, if it's stuck, and it's all finished!" 

Anna was talking like I was getting some kind of shot. Her hands were firm on my shoulders. I couldn't get away. When the door opened, a guy was dragged out by a guard, kicking and screaming, hysterical, tears rolling down his cheeks, his eyes wild, almost unseeing. His eyes met mine, and for a moment his lips curved into what might have been words, before he screamed again, throwing himself around like a toddler. This kid was traumatised. 

Anna, however, didn't seem fazed. "Connie," her voice was almost mocking. "See, what did I tell you? It was just a pinch. It didn't hurt, did it?" 

He stopped screaming, going still, his kicking arms and legs freezing in place. 

I thought he'd calmed down, before he lunged at her, fingernails like claws, teeth bared like an animal. "I'm kill you," he spat, when he was violently dragged back, his feet skidding on the floor. Connie lunged again, a wet sounding sob escaping his lips. "Do you fucking hear me? I'll kill you! You fucking bitch! You're dead! I'll rip your fucking throat out and stuff your—into the— and then I'll claw our your god damn-" 

The boy's words muffled when he was thrown onto the ground, and he dropped face first, screeching into the floor. 

The crew didn't even acknowledge him, and Anna rolled her eyes. "I told you they were fine," she was talking to me this time. "They're all like Connie, before they mellow out and, well, you saw the finishing product, correct?" the boy seemed to be the most with it, though I think that was because he was fresh out of.. whatever happened behind that door. 

He didn't lift his head from the floor, letting out an almost animal-like whimper when a guard picked him up and threw him over his back. Anna tutted. "You knew what you were getting yourself into, sweetie," she told the boy, who muffled a threat into the guard's shoulder. She nodded to the guard. "Take him into the calming room." her face pinched. "Did you take his phone? I told you to kill the Sim."

I tried to peel Anna's fingers from my arm, my thoughts dizzy. But her grip was too tight, fingernails sticking through my sweater. I felt like I was going to be sick. This woman had her claws into me.

Connie had stopped sobbing, his breaths still heavy, like he and cried himself to sleep. The guard turned, and I caught the boy's head of curls buried in his shoulder. 

His body swung off the back like a puppet. He was out of it. It was becoming increasingly obvious That Connie wasn't going home. I felt paralyzed, my own breaths didn't feel real. I couldn't move. I couldn't speak. These kids weren't going home. 

**And neither was I.**

"Yes, Ma'am," the guard said, "And his backpack. I also took a pack of cigarettes, a lighter, and a Gameboy."

"No." 

The world seemed to go in slow motion, when the boy was carried across the room, disappearing behind a plastic curtain, and I was physically picked up by a guard, because I couldn't move. Anna was speaking, but all I could hear were her words from earlier, buzzing around in my head like a demented wasp. Kill the Sim. They were planning on destroying our phones so we couldn't be tracked. 

A door slammed behind me, and I jumped, blinking. I was already inside the room, already inside the room that had ripped away that boy's sanity. I took two steps forward when I was told to come closer. 

There was a smiling redheaded woman standing in front of me. Initially, she was nothing but a confusing blur of red in my frayed vision. When I swiped at my eyes to try and maintain some control, a face blossomed. Pretty features and a lipstick smile. "Emma." Her voice was smooth like honey, coaxing me to sit on a small white bed. I didn't look at the frayed wrist straps hanging off, or the smears of blood blotting the pillow and seeping across ocean blue floor tiles. 

The woman's voice took away my fear, plunging my thoughts into cotton candy. "Okay, so let's start with a question," she hummed. The lights glowed brighter above me, and the palms of her hands, then her tip-toeing fingers came to gently press down on my back, forcing me onto my stomach. 

The face rest I had my forehead and cheeks pressed into was wet. I could smell it, the rotten taste of copper. Someone else's blood painted my skin. I felt exactly where they had struggled, the wet patches on the sheets from loss of bladder function. But still, this woman's voice was so sweet, so relaxing, lulling me to almost slumber. 

"Have you ever had your tonsils removed?" she began. I could hear her rattling around, one hand steady on my back, while the other searched for something. I didn't– no, I couldn't answer. My lips were numb, my throat suffocated.

"How about a kidney, hm?" she chuckled. "There are certain parts of us that are not needed– and can be donated to a cause." I tried to lift my head, and she forced me back down, and I was drowning in the stink and taste of blood. "There are *other* parts of us that are no longer needed," she said. "Emma, can you guess what I'm talking about?" 

"No," I managed to gasp out in a sob. 

She tutted. "Why don't you turn your head, and I'll show you?" 

I did, and I found myself staring, baffled, at a shadow puppet she was projecting across the wall with her hand. "Dual consciousness is the theory of two minds inside one," she said. "However," the woman made her shadow puppet dance across the wall, morphing into a rabbit, and then a chicken. "What if you have always been able to see it? Since birth, Emma. Since you first noticed that presence behind and in front of you as a child, alive in the light, and sleeping in the dark. Your other half who never speaks, and yet feels exactly how you feel. She has your memories, your thoughts. A whole other you that you ignored all this time."

Her voice acted almost like a drug, because while she was speaking, my wrists had been strapped down, and the cruel, cold blade of a knife was slicing into the flesh of my foot. Then, my ankle, and down my leg. I could feel my blood following, pooling down my skin. I was aware of a scream in my throat, clawing for a way out, but I couldn't move. 

The cold blade dragged all the way up my leg, and then down my side. Trapped inside my own mind, I started to notice she was ignoring my stomach and chest, instead cutting towards my shoulder, over the bump, and around the back of my neck. I held my breath. She wasn't cutting into me. The movement of the scalpel reminded me of Leela making cookies, and cutting around the dough. 

I wasn't being operated on, or cut into. I was being… carved. She dug the blade in again, this time harsher, cutting down my right side. It was then when I felt something… move. My body jolted, and I felt it, a sudden, overwhelming screech caught between my teeth. Despair hit like icy cold water, agony that wasn't mine. 

I started to tremble, when I felt her gloved fingers pinch around something that was clinging to me, holding on for dear life. 

I tried to throw my head up, but she was forcing me back down. I held my breath, counting. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. 

"Almost got it!" 

The woman sounded like she was struggling, and my body was fighting back, wrenching against her blade pinning this living, moving, writhing Thing. When I risked turning my head, I saw it; beautiful darkness carved into my figure. She didn't have a face, and somehow, I was still mesmerised by her. 

She was terrifying.

She didn't make sense, defying science and logic. My shadow stopped writhing and turned to me. I felt it in one single breath, her none-existent eyes on me, before my shadow was cruelly sliced away, tearing half of me with it. 

I didn't even realize this thing existed, and it was there with me, screaming in agony and clinging onto me, before they cut her away. I understood why the boy was screaming, why he was hysterical. They didn't just cut away my shadow. They cut away half of who I was. Half of my emotion, my memories, my thoughts. The woman helped me sit up, and her assistant was cleaning up the blood. 

"See, Emma!" she beamed, but my gaze was on my disoriented looking shadow, standing with her arms folded, her head frantically whipping around, searching for a way out. "You didn't need your shadow, did you?" She lifted me to my feet, and my shadow started toward me, before she was dragged back by the woman. 

I blinked. Somehow, her hands were able to grasp my shadow's arm. "We, however, do need her." her smile widened into a grin. So, we're going to borrow her for a little while, okay?" 

I didn't get to speak, and my shadow was dragged away before I could. 

I don't know how long had passed before I was sitting on that same bench, swaying from side to side. The agony was gone. The despair and helplessness, and the pain of my shadow being sliced away was gone. In its place was a startling numbness that seeped into my blood and bones, entangling in my veins. I was squashed between a boy and a girl, as the bench filled up with more of us. 

I recognised Connie. Only from his odd hairstyle. 

Wait, no. It wasn't Connie. 

Connie was…in the calming room. 

*Dead*, my mind corrected in a dull murmur. At some point, the boy's head found my shoulder, and the girl's face dropped into my lap. Music was playing, I was aware of it in my ears. I was aware of yelling from the crew, and then screaming inside the door that stole away our shadows. I didn't realize the world was black and white, until I stared down at my hand still smeared. 

It was supposed to be red– not a greyish blur. 

I could feel my own energy draining away, like my shadow had held all of me. And what was left was just a shell.

I was hungry, but I wasn't sure what for. 

Food? 

No. 

Something that would fill the gnawing hole inside me. 

When my head was drooping, Anna was standing in front of me. "Okay!" she shouted, and the rest jerked their heads up. Her eyes were sparkling. She had so much life, while the people next to me were struggling to stay awake. I wanted to know where Connie and the first batch of students were. But words were so hard, clinging onto my tongue. 

"Do you want to watch?" Anna seemed gleeful. 

When we didn't answer, the six of us were pulled to our feet and dragged in front of the stage. The others slumped to their knees, so I did too. Standing was painful. The ground felt more real, something I could cling onto. I saw my shadow hiding behind the others, still trying to find a getaway. Music started, and my shadow was pushed onto the stage, along with two other's. I recognised the outlines as the boys sitting next to me, leaning on each other. 

"Dance," the man behind the camera ordered. 

The shadow's didn't react at first. Mine had her arms folded, while the boys made *how?* gestures. I noticed how animated their shadows were compared to the real versions, a chill creeping down my spine. It was like they had been skinned of their personalities, that had been cut away with their outlines. 

The two of them couldn't stay upright, guards having to force them to sit up. 

While their outlines… danced. 

"Dance like you're feeling yourself," the director said. "Just move to the music."

And they did. 

A little too well. The music began, action was yelled out, and the two shadows seemed shy at first, offering awkward shimmying, before getting into it. 

It was ironic, with the way the weaker the real versions became, their shadow's fully got into the dance, triple flipping and adding some serious moves. When my shadow joined in, she refused, until the director threatened her. The two male shadows coerced her, and eventually she too started to dance, moves that I would never be able to do. I watched the three of them go through multiple shots, together, then as twos, and then separately, before the director seemed happy, and shouted for cut. 

My shadow did not have a face, and somehow I knew she was smiling. Even sliced away from me, severed, I could feel her giddiness and excitement as she joined hands with the boys, and bowed. 

I had so much to say to her.

Even in my dizzy state, I remember jumping up to wrap my arms around her. Before the guy in front of me let out a sudden haunting cry that split into my skull. I didn't see him drop to his knees. I didn't even know he was standing. What I did see was blood splattering across the stage. It was raining blood, was my first thought.

And my second thought was, I can see color again. 

No. What I was witnessing was the guy's shadow getting his throat slit open, and I could see all of the red. 

I already knew what was going to happen. The guy in front of me cried out in agony, and I watched his shadow forced to the ground, a knife sticking into its skull. My gaze was on blood, real blood, pooling red seeping across the stage, and then I was staring at my shadow. I knew she was scared. 

Even without a face and a voice, she was terrified. I screamed for her to run, but she was too slow. She stumbled back, diving into the darkness of the wall to hide, before a security guard peeled her from the shadow, pressed a knife to her none-existent throat— and stabbed in the blade, severing her head from her torso. The sensation was like being stabbed myself. I felt her pain, her gasps for breath. Her confusion. The music was still slamming into me. The pain was agonising, stripping me of half of my emotion. Half of my everything. 

Before I stopped. 

I stopped feeling sad, because I wasn't sad. 

I didn't feel angry or helpless. 

There was no pain. 

I was taken to the calming room. 

But I was already calm. 

I was numb. 

Hungry. 

When the door was pulled open though, I was face to face with three dead security guards, and a maniacal looking Connie, his hands slick red. He had cracked open the man's skull like an egg. Connie's dazed, almost vacant eyes found mine, and he broke out into a toothy smile. In the dim light, he no longer had a shadow. 

Instead, I saw the remnants, stained blood on his hand and up his arm, smearing the cuff of his shirt. He was still swaying, and I laughed. I broke down hysterically laughing with him, the two of us falling over each other. There was no happiness or joy in my laugh. It felt flat and wrong. I don't know why I laughed. I don't think I had empathy anymore. 

I didn't have confusion or anger. I didn't see a murder. I just saw funny red stuff, and a dead bad guy who took away our shadows. 

Connie wanted to kill Anna too, but I was sure that would get us caught. There were seven of us who escaped that night. We made it out of the fire door into the darkness and didn't look back. I remember not feeling a thing. 

Not the cold graze of night air on my skin, or the emptiness that swallowed me whole. Anna came after us. She caught two of us, luring them with the promise their shadow's were still alive– and the rest of us got away. Connie started killing a year later. He started with homeless people, before his thirst grew stronger. 

To fill that empty side of him, he killed people to quench that nothing inside of him. Anna caught him easily. 

But part of me is glad she did. Being free to roam with the same traits and mind of a sociopath isn't healthy. I didn't realize our shadows make us. Because without her, I am nothing. 

I feel nothing.

Connie wanted to distract himself from that… hunger. 

Bess killed herself on my 20th birthday. 

A week later, I found her in a club drinking herself into the ground. 

Apparently, without a shadow, you can't die. 

So, I can only imagine what Anna did– or is still doing– to the survivors. 

Her corpse is still attached to me.  

I've carried her around for so long, and I'm so tired. 

I really fucking hate that commercial.
