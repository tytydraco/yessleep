Against all odds, the pharmacy was open. I grabbed a suture needle, some thread, gauze and disinfectant. I started off with Captain, who was still carrying the goddamn rock in his mouth, refusing to let it go, but at least he followed me. I sutured the wound on his neck and disinfected it to the best of my abilities, which didn't net a great result but still did the trick. I then moved onto my own wound; Captain's teeth all so clear in my skin, all in shades of red. It looked nasty, definitely nastier than the one Captain had, and I couldn't really suture it myself. I just poured some disinfectant and covered it with gauzes.

Once I was done with the wounds issue, I was ready to move on to the next town looking for another vet, hopefully one that would know what to do in this case. Then again, things never happen the way we expect or want. As I was getting closer to the outer limits of the city I noticed something in the middle of the road. It became apparent that it was a police blockage preventing anyone from getting in or going out the city. Contraty to what I could have expected from such a blockage, there were no other cars eagerly waiting to leave, no honking, no angry middle-aged man explaining why he needed to get out. Seems like movies add too much drama to this kind of situations, or there was just not enough people left in the city to paint such a picture.

It was the first time I realized that the lack of people was extremely strange. I found it odd when it was still early morning, but now? Now it was something else to worry about. Something more to add to the mix, alongside Captain's behaviour, the fact that it wasn't just Captain, and the collection of stupid rocks that had them obsessed.

I got out the car; just a couple of police officers, their cars parked each blocking a way of the road. Before I could start walking towards them, one of them pulled out his gun. I was still far from them, far enough I thought he wouldn't be able to hit me even if he pulled the trigger, but I stopped and raised my hands.

"I don't think there's any need for the gun". I yelled, hoping he'd hear me. "I just need to get to the next town to find a veterinary for my dog, would it..."

He shot. Not towards me, not meaning to actually hurt me, but as a warning. Or I saw it that way, at least. I dropped to the ground, covered my ears instinctively. "Please!" I pleaded from the asphalt, then another shot. I ran to my car and got in. The policemen were visibly shaken, now both of them holding their guns towards my car as if they were afraid I would try and run them over. I turned around thinking if I was fast enough I could maybe get to a different exit road before it was blocked too. I tried with two different roads with the same exact result, though the last one was only guarded by a single police officer, who did not pull his gun out.

"Please, sir, I don't know what's going on, but I need to get my dog to a vet as soon as possible". I calmly said as I was exiting the car, hands on the air.

The officer looked at me as if actually thinking about what I said, I could even sense some pity on his eyes. "No exceptions. If you've been to any of the city's vet clinics, you already know it's not just you. And if I make an exception for you, which I won't, then I would have to do it for everyone. Sorry, but this is how things are".

"At least tell me what's going on". I asked, trying to use the fact that this one was actually uttering words. "I just don't know what to do, I can't even get back home".

I knew I messed up as soon as I saw his expression. I shouldn't have told him that last part. I should have thought about the fact that transit was prohibited in both directions; in and out the city. I saw him reaching for his gun, trying to be subtle, but his body language had changed too harshly when he heard me. It was too obvious he was... distraught about that fact.

"So, tell me... where did you say you came from?" He asked me as he found the gun on his holster.

I began to phrase an answer, but his shooting was faster than my lips. A first bullet hit my car, and I rushed to it. Two more bullets flew close enough for me to notice, but didn't hit anything, and then I was back in the driver's seat. I hunched and started turning the key, but the engine seemed to have been damaged by that first shot. How could I be this unfortunate? Two more bullets, one hit the windshield, the other was lost. The glass cracked around the entry point, and I inmediately turned my head to make sure Captain was safe and sound. Our eyes crossed, which was odd as the dog had been staring at the floor for several hours now, and I saw something familiar in them.

The policeman was moving slowly towards the car, gun locked on his right hand. On his left, a walkie. He was asking for reinforcements for some reason. I was unarmed, trapped inside my car without means to defend myself, what did he need help with? The sixth shot hit me. Well, it barely scratched my shoulder, but still I'd say that counts. It definitely counted for me given how much it hurt. And that was it; Captain lost it, something I would have never expected given his current condition. The dog turned his head towards the windshield and jump through it, smashing the fragmented glass with his head. No sound other than several gunshots and glass still falling fom the windshield onto the dashboard. A few seconds later, screams.

I got out of the car and saw a macabre show: Captain had went straight for the officer's neck. I didn't see how it happened, given that I was hiding from the shooting, and I can tell you how grateful I am for not watching such a carnage. The aftermath was enough to get an idea of what Captain actually did, as the head was still barely attached to the body thanks to the spine. All the flesh around it had been torn apart, chunks of it still laying on the ground all around the body.

I started having trouble breathing, the whole situation... It was just too much to handle. My dog had just killed a police officer. Of course he was just defending me, I guess. Had he not acted I would probably be dead by now. And, still, I was having troubles processing it. Captain looked at me once again with those same eyes, that look, that seemed so familiar to the dog I knew and loved. But what I had in front of me was definitely something different from what I thought I knew.

"Go... Home". The dog said, still holding the rock.

My hands began shaking uncontrollably. It was a terrifying sound, half spoken words mixed with a distressed bark. The glow in his eyes vanished, replaced by something else, something sinister. I could not see Captain anymore, as what I saw behind his gaze was not animal. It was some sort of understanding, knowing that creature was... self-aware.
