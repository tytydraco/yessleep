As I look at my bedroom wall I see a tangled collection of medals that hang from dusty hooks. A sea of silver and bronze adorned at the end of ribbons in all colors, a physical representation of a lifetime achievement that would make anyone happy, but not me. It's a reminder that I have never finished first once in my life. I should be content with the numerous times I’ve finished on the podium, but being as competitive as I am, I won't allow myself to be happy until I have something gold to outshine the rest.



I’ve been running for as long as I can remember, my parents used to call me “Speedy Jack” because I was always racing around the house as a kid and when I got to high school I was always out on the track competing.



My bones start to creak, crack, and pop as I move around and start getting ready for the day, a 36-year-old man past his running prime stares back at me in the foggy bathroom mirror. My competitive days are quickly slipping away and the thought of finally winning something gold is outpacing me. Images of X-rays flood my mind and the life-altering echo of my physiotherapist explaining to me that my knees are done for and that I should start slowing down or risk damaging them even further still rings in my ears. My attention is diverted when my phone vibrates and the screen lights up. I see a message from my old friend and running rival Michael.



“Hey, Jack! Don’t forget about the race this weekend, I can’t wait to beat you like always!” the text preview reads.



I scoff out loud. “Of course, I didn’t forget.”



This is my favorite race of the year, the Annual Hillsberry Fall Marathon. There's nothing like running in the cool autumnal breeze past forests filled with yellow and amber leaves. I’ve been training all year for this race, you could say I’ve been training my whole life for it. Because for “Speedy Jack”, this will be my last chance to cross that finishing line before everyone else, especially Michael.



Little did I know, this would be the last race of my life…



Roads rain-drenched from the night before wind and snake as I drive into Hillsberry town center from home. Excited crowds have amassed to watch the race and I’m slowed to a snail's pace through the car park looking for a spot despite arriving early. When I find some empty spots down the back I get out and feel the sting of cold air. My running attire wasn’t made to keep me warm standing still so I quickly begin limbering up and use the side of my car as leverage to do some stretches. Blue runner tape wrapped tightly around my knees and shins doesn’t stop some pain from emerging as I firmly massage the surrounding muscles.



I hear Michael's car coming in the distance. He drives an obnoxiously red sports car that matches his personality all too well. Loud engine noises reverberate when he enters the car park trying to impress people and I can see his smug grin when he parks beside me. Michaels' laugh is immediate the moment he opens his car door and I grit my teeth in anticipation of what stupid remarks are about to spew from his mouth.



“Good stretching, I see you're getting ready for second place again Jacky boy,” he says.



“Second? You're thinking of your ambitions,” I say through a fake and bitter laugh.

“Aren't you going to stretch?” 



Shoving his hands deep into his pockets, moving his arm around like he is searching for something he pulls out a balled-up hand. When he opens it I see a bunch of little white pills in the center of his palm. Immediately Michael throws one pill to the back of his mouth before I get a chance to ask him what it is.



“Oh I don’t need to stretch, not when I have this,” he mumbles as he tries to swallow the pill dry.



 I ask. “What is it this time?”



“Oh you know, a bit of this, a bit of that. Something to give me an edge, you want one?” Michael offers.

This is no shock to me, I’ve always known that Michael takes things before races to give him an advantage. Anyone else would probably report him but to me, he's a toxic friend I put up with because I’ve run with him for almost a decade and it’s easier to put up with him than come to these things alone.



“You know I don't cheat Michael, I want my win to be real” I say condescendingly.



“Real? Come on Jack, this isn’t the Olympics, no one is doing drug testing, don't you want to get your first win against me?” 



“Here, in case you change your mind while you’re looking at my back in the race” Michael jokes as he shoves some of the pills into my left pocket.



Red anger flushes my face because despite hating the idea of cheating, I hate the idea of him beating me again even more. I open my mouth to tell him I don’t want anything to do with these pills before I'm interrupted by the race announcer over a megaphone calling for all runners to head to the starting area.



“Oh, baby! These are good ones, I can feel it already” Michael says excitedly as he starts running out of the car park.



I almost can't hear him yelling “Just remember, It’s important you only take one per hour, and I'll be waiting for you at the finish line” as he starts putting distance between us.



Tapping my pocket and feeling the pills at the bottom. I sigh in annoyance and start running in the same direction. 



Would I regret not throwing them out there and then? 



The starting area is located on the main road of Hillsberry. They've painted a big bright colorful square for all of us to stand in, flanked by barricades separating the races from the roaring fans. Looking around I start to size up the competition. There are many strong-looking athletes, both men and women, maybe 50 in total, many faces I recognize that I’ve beaten before but also many new faces. That doesn’t fill me with confidence but I take a moment to close my eyes and focus on breathing, clearing my mind, and preparing to give it my all. I come back to reality when I hear the countdown begin over an old buzzing megaphone and my heart starts to beat faster as the announcer holds up the firing gun while everyone assumes their starting positions. I can see Michael in my periphery lazily just standing there like he has no care in the world.



The gun fires with a thundering crack and everyone starts moving differently. I take it easy as this is going to be a long race, but fast enough to overtake a handful of slower runners in front of me. Looking ahead I can see Michael is a couple of places in front of me, he always starts strong and somehow maintains this momentum the whole race.



*Is he really that good? Or is it the pills?* I think negatively.

Distracted by my jealous thoughts I trip over an uneven part of the road and stumble, trying to regain my balance on the wet asphalt I fall and land hard on my knees and hands. Many runners start to pass me as I pick myself up and fight the pain of my newly acquired bleeding scratches. I grit my teeth in frustration and hold back tears from forming in my eyes as I start to push myself to make up for the valuable time and positions I have lost.



Twenty minutes pass and I have reclaimed most of the places I lost at the expense of my legs, my calves and ankles are starting to burn with the build-up of lactic acid and I know I need to slow down and maintain my energy otherwise I would burn out well before the finish line. Counting the runners in front of me while keeping watch of the road so I don’t make another mistake I see nine ahead of me. It’s hard to not feel discouraged about being in 10th place but I know there’s still plenty of road to go. Michael is in second place and I see him turn his head and look back for me. He gives me another one of his smug grins when his eyes find mine before quickening his pace and overtaking the runner in first place.



*There's no way I'm losing to Michael again!* 



Clouded with outrage I shove my hand deep into my pocket, desperately searching for the pills I hoped didn't fall out during my trip. Without a second thought, I pull one out and shove it into my mouth. 

  


It takes a lot of effort to keep up with the pack and Michael for the next 5 minutes while I wait for the pills to kick in but then I start to feel the pain in my legs ease, my ankles feel loose, and my heels bounce off the pavement with a spring in my step. My breathing becomes steadier and my heart rate slows.



*Wow, Is this really why Michael has won so many races?* I wonder.



Guilt starts to set in but I push it aside with excitement. I feel better now than when I started so I increase my speed and overtake many of the runners before me. There's just one person between myself and Michael now and I’m quickly gaining on both of them. The second-place runner dressed in all blue starts to slow down as they reach for a water bottle on the sideline. We have all been running for a long time now and everyone is tired and dehydrated. I consider using a few seconds to go for water but while feeling good I take the opportunity to pass. Now in second place, I can see the remaining distance between Michael and me and I  know what needs to be done.



Slowly gaining on Michael I start to feel the pain come back in my legs, the blood from my previous wounds leak as my breathing quickens and I start to sweat profusely. The loud sound of my short fatigued breaths reaches Michael's ears and he turns to see me with much surprise.



“Look who decided to join the winners club” Shouts Michael.



I think about responding with something annoyingly humorous but my calves are now painfully tight and are starting to burn. As I push through the pain and wipe a waterfall of sweat from my forehead I notice Michael is giving it his all to keep the lead and he starts pulling ahead even more and anxious thoughts begin to flood my mind.



*“Is Michael really this good? Or did he take another pill during the race?”* 

*“He must have, there's no way he could be still going at this pace. I must beat him, I must do everything I can to win this race.”*



As we turn the bend in the road at the top of Hillsberry I know there are about 30 minutes left in the race and I desperately shove my hand in my pocket again for the pills. 

Feeling the last three and without hesitation or intelligent thought, I throw all of them to the back of my mouth and take a big swallow which makes the dry pills stick to the side of my throat, frantically swallowing multiple times to force them all down.



This time the pills kick in much quicker and I assume this must have been what Micahel did to keep ahead of everyone else. Strangely though I notice Michael starts slowing down and I finally take the opportunity to pull up alongside him. His face is stunned when he notices me smiling and running with ease.

“See you at the finish line!” I say ecstatically.



My feet smash the pavement with determination I have never felt before. I can already picture myself crossing the finish line and now nothing is going to stop me. My thoughts are disrupted when I hear Michael shouting from behind.



“What the hell?! Did you take more than one Jack?! That’s not Safe!”



But I can't wipe this smile from my face. This is my time to win. 



I take in the surrounding beauty of Hillsberry, leaf-covered forest floors saturated with colors of marigold and tangerine. Sounds of a nearby stream slowly flow by and the trees sway and groan in the wind now that it’s not drowned out by the roaring sound of stampeding footsteps around me. All of a sudden I feel an agonizing stabbing pain and hear a loud crack from my left leg.



I look down and notice something very strange. My legs are a shade of deep bluish-purple, my veins are bulging out and I can see the blood pulsing through them. Reaching down to feel my calves I’m shocked they are solid as a rock. The sharp stabbing pain returns and my run briefly turns to a skip before regaining my balance and continuing.



*“Is this a side effect of the pills?”* I start to worry.

*“I can't lose, not when I’m this close”*

I shake the thought, I can worry about my legs after I win.



The road in front of me crests and I can see the finish line on the horizon. I quickly glance behind to see Michael far back but still within passing distance if I falter again. He notices me looking and tries to flag me down with a worrying look on his face. I ignore him as he is probably just trying to slow me down to catch up. I give every bit of energy I have while I still can.



This doesn't last long though as the pill's effects start to diminish rapidly, My breathing quickens, and my legs are now ferociously burning. The sweat from my forehead is pouring down over my eyebrows and I can barely see as it trickles over my eyes. The noises of the forest are now drowned out by my heavy breathing and the pounding rhythm of my heartbeat. I’ve never felt this exhausted in any race previously but I assume it’s because I've never been able to run this hard before. The finish line is growing and I can now see the crowd cheering from the sidelines, faces filled with smiles, hands shaking hand-written poster boards to celebrate their family and friend's achievement. 



The pain is unbearable now, I continue to wipe a mass of sweat from my eyes so I can examine my legs and I'm filled with dread to see they’re now a mixture of inky black and deep crimson. A sharp pain shoots up from my feet to my thighs, and with every step I consider slowing down for a second but my knees won't take any more races and I’ve never had this opportunity, so I must win. 



The crowd's eyes are fixated on me as I enter the last 100 meters into the finish area, most are cheering loudly and some are even taking photos. I put my arms up in the air ready to be the first runner to burst through the finish ribbon and finally receive that gold medal I’ve worked so hard for.



The pitch of the crowd cheering suddenly changes, I look around and the sea of happy faces has been replaced by a look of horror and disgust. Screams start to increase as more and more of the crowd begin noticing something about me and I look down to see what everyone is now pointing at. 



It takes me a while to recognize what I’m looking at. And even when my brain finally puts the sight into conscious thoughts I struggle to comprehend it. Most of my legs are gone…



My calves have exploded and my leg mass is now being dragged behind me on ribbons of tendons. Pools of blood erupt from my shoes and make a disgusting squelching sound with every step I take. Without enough muscle to support my left shin bone, it gives way and snaps so loudly it startles some of the crowd from screaming. I don't have the time or the worry to look behind me to notice where my foot has been left. Parents cover their children's faces as I stab my shin bone into the ground to support my weight and travel the remaining distance.



Fighting through my tears and the excruciating pain I still have my arms in the air as I hobble through the finish banner while leaving a bloody trail. The blood loss sends my head into a woozy state and the screams blur into a sound that I embrace as cheer again. A smile forms on my pale face and I use all my strength to remain standing on my grotesque stumps.  
  


“Winnings Winning” I say.
