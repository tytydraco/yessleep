Hello everyone. I’m not really sure if this is the right place to explain my story, but I don’t really know if a right place even exists. I’m not exactly sure what we encountered, but I want others to know about it. Let me explain everything from the beginning.

My band isn’t big by any stretch of the imagination, at least not in the mainstream. We formed in the winter of 2019 in a small, snowy town in Colorado and built up our reputation for years in the Black Metal underground scene. 

Our band quickly achieved notoriety for our haunting music, intense live shows, and intimidating aesthetic that was a byproduct of making raw, unpolished music.

Last year, we recorded the entirety of our first demo, \*Buried in Impenetrable Darkness\*, on a battered to hell tape deck. We borrowed it from our vocalist’s dad and wedged it between old paint cans and a toolbox in the garage we were rehearsing in at the time. 

Every take that we captured and played back made us realize that we had stumbled onto the exact atmosphere we had been striving to achieve since day one. The songs sounded like they had been excavated from a collapsed mineshaft, akin to Darkthrone’s \*Transylvanian Hunger\*. 

It became the kind of demo that was traded heavily, and rumors spread that the music had been recorded deep inside an abandoned crypt. We never corrected people; we just let the myth become a part of the legacy as much as the music.

Before I go any further, I should explain something. We never use our real names in the band. That’s normal in the Black Metal genre. The scene has always been built on personas and the mythos behind them. You don’t join a band like ours to be “Eric” or “Devin” anymore. You take on a name that sounds like it emerged from the foggiest graveyard. Pseudonyms in this genre aren’t just armor, they’re equal parts secrecy, legend, and ritual. 

My bandmates and I chose names that belonged carved into an ossuary wall rather than printed on a driver’s license. That’s how I became Ulalek, and how the rest of the band became N’gath, Ishkanah, Valgavoth, and Lord Markov.

N’gath towered over the rest of us like some giant, starving medieval saint who was all elbows and cheekbones. His arms looked like they belonged on a marionette, and the corpse-paint tattooed on them was self-inflicted with a stick-and-poke rig he had designed himself after listening to nothing but the Norwegian music scene for months. He possessed the seriousness of a monk, but also the theatrics of a guy who could summon malicious spirits. N’gath rarely spoke offstage, but when he did, his voice was surprisingly gentle, like he was determined to make every word of his count.

Then there was Ishkanah, our lead guitarist. She was someone who looked like she had crawled out of a mossy hollow but also maintained perfect eyeliner. The forest-witch vibe wasn’t just for show; she was devoted to that lifestyle. She collected and stored bones as “art projects”, obsessed over botany, and exclusively drank nothing but her herbal teas. Beneath that mystical exterior though, was someone whose nervous system was in constant overdrive. 

Valgavoth, the smartass of the group, was the one who wielded the bass guitar. He was barrel-chested and sported long, raven-black hair that looked freshly conditioned even though he insisted he washed it only in “mountain rain”. His eyes were always hidden behind sunglasses to “avoid the gaze of God”. Whatever the hell that meant. Despite his flaws, he was the glue that held us together. When rehearsals got ugly, he could shut everyone up with one raised eyebrow behind his shades.

Our drummer Lord Markov didn’t just play the drums; he attacked them like they owed him money. Everything about him was loud: his laugh, his personality, his snare hits. He was notorious for throwing his whole body into every story he told, but for all his chaos, Markov was a genuine soul. 

We were a mess, but we were a family, and a perpetually broke one at that. There’s only so much money you can make in music, let alone metal. 

As passionate as we were, it wasn’t paying the bills. Eventually, after slaving away at our day jobs, we managed to save up enough money to fund production for our first album. It seemed like a big break, but our savings were essentially pissed away in an instant when the engineer we hired to oversee our production ghosted us the day before our recording session. 

We were gutted and didn’t have the faintest clue of what to do. The money that we had was gone, the piece of shit took our money and ran. 

When all seemed lost, N’gath found a place he thought we should go record at. He told us when rehearsals had devolved into Markov pounding on the drums in frustration and Ishkanah spiraling about “rhythmic entropy curves”. 

Valgavoth and I were frustrated and wondering where N’gath went when he drifted in from the hallway like a wraith returning from a pilgrimage. He held his phone with both hands, treating it like it were some coveted relic. Valgavoth gave him a questionable look, prompting him to clear his throat.

He didn’t announce what he had to say; instead, he whispered, “I have found… something,”

Markov stopped mid-drumstick twirl and glared. “If this is another one of your “haunted” locations, I’m out,”

“It’s not a “haunted” location, Markov,” N’gath spoke, his voice calm but papery. “It’s a chapel.”

Ishkanah snapped her head up, pupils way too dilated for someone who claimed she’d “only had two coffees.” “A chapel?” she inquired. “Like… with acoustics? Or with spirits? Or with both? Holy architecture has resonance lines, you know. Some frequencies can—”

Valgavoth, still wearing his perpetual indoor sunglasses, put up a hand. “Before Google here goes on another tangent… what’s so special about this chapel of yours? Why should we give a shit about this place?”

N’gath turned the screen around to show a crumbling stone building perched on the edge of a cliff. Snow had swallowed the trees around it, but it was as haunting as it was beautiful. “It’s in the San Juans. The chapel was built in the 1890s and rumor has it that it was meant for monks who live in the mountains there. It has since been abandoned for reasons unknown. Others say they left because they heard and saw… things.”

“Perfect! Let’s go record there and terrorize whatever’s in the mountains along the way! We could get some cool ghost stories out of this.” Markov smiled the kind of smile that meant he was already packing in his head.

“Guys, shouldn’t we think about this? The mountains? That’s a tall ask of us.” I said, trying to talk some sense into my bandmates.

N’gath continued, ignoring Markov and I. “The article said that the acoustics there are flawless and can make harmonies echo for minutes at a time.” He paused, his voice dipping lower. “It would make us sound like we were conjuring something evil and powerful. Our music will finally have teeth.”

Ishkanah shivered with excitement. “Teeth have a frequency you know. You can hear the tension in enamel if the room’s quiet enough.”

“I swear to God, Ish, sometimes I think you’re just making up words.” Valgavoth shot her a side-eye behind the sunglasses before turning back to N’gath. “So, are we taking a field trip there? We’re just going to Magic School Bus our asses and our gear up a mountain and hope we survive the elements? Great plan Einstein. What if the building collapses on us?”

“What if we don’t make it and we’re stranded up there? What then? I want this as badly as you guys, but I don’t think that the potential payoff is worth the risk.” I voiced my concerns, much to the dismay of Valgavoth.

“Sometimes in life, you have to be willing to risk everything. That’s what being in a band is about.”

N’gath put his phone into his pocket and crossed his arms against his chest. “There is nothing to worry about guys. The route to get there is safe, and the chapel is still structurally sound according to my research.”

“Oh, well if an article said it, then clearly it must be true.” Valgavoth spoke dryly.

Markov slammed his sticks together like a declaration of war. “I’m in! If the mountain wants to fight us, let it. A little snow and ice never scared me! Mom didn’t raise no bitch! I’ll drum on its corpse.”

Valgavoth sighed like a disappointed father before replying, “You can’t drum on a mountain’s corpse you dumbass,”

Markov shot a dirty look at Valgavoth as he twirled his drumsticks idly. 

Ishkanah bounced on her toes in a jittery kinetic blur. “We should test the acoustics with dissonant triads! Or drop-tuned tremolo lines! Or—”

“Lovely,” Valgavoth interrupted. “We’ll die and it’ll be because we annoyed the shit out of a spirit with jazz chords.”

“This could be the breakthrough,” N’gath exhaled slowly. 

“N’gath could be right.” I spoke after sitting on the idea for a moment. “This could be our breakthrough moment. We could finally capture that sound we’ve been looking for at this place.”

For a few seconds after I said that, the room went dead silent. Nobody said anything as everyone thought the situation over in their heads. None of us wanted to admit that we were desperate, but we were. Months of hard work were wasted, and our dreams were hanging on to the hopes that we were impulsive enough to make them a reality.

Seeing everyone so passionate and alive made me have a change of heart about my concerns. Looking at everyone’s faces, I could tell the others felt the same, strange mix of dread and excitement when you’re about to do something profoundly stupid but possibly life-changing. 

N’gath just stood there, hands folded in his sleeves like some gaunt prophet as we all nodded one by one. With no second thoughts, the five of us agreed to drive straight into the mountains with nothing but our gear, worse judgment, and corpse paint.

We packed everything we needed shortly afterward and began taking everything to the shitty white van we owned. As we loaded up the last of the equipment into the van, Valgavoth slid his sunglasses down his nose, and said, “If this thing breaks down on a mountain road and we get eaten by whatever cryptid is trending this month, I’m blaming all of you.”

N’gath didn’t say anything at first. He just placed his microphone gently on top of one of Ishkanah’s amps, like he was tucking a child into bed. Then, softly:

“The spirits of the mountain will guide us.”

“Are the spirits a more reliable guide than Mapquest, N’gath?” Valgavoth rolled his eyes and climbed into the passenger seat.

Ishkanah buckled herself in, eyes wide and bright like she hadn’t slept in three days. “Actually, mountains have specific harmonic signatures—”

“NOPE,” Markov shouted from the back before she could get started. “Not listening to your ramblings again. Last time, I lost a whole weekend.”

N’gath climbed into the driver’s seat as I sat next to Ishkanah, laughing at Markov’s gripes with her. I had barely fastened my seatbelt before the van growled to life, and we rumbled out of the city. 

The van shuddered as it drove down the road, as snow gathered on the edges of the highway in jagged, messy piles. Somewhere between the mile markers, I watched the sky turn a bruise-purple and listened to the engine screech like a dying animal. 

Ishkanah just stared out the window, her voice was unsettlingly calm as she spoke to no one in particular. “They left because they heard and saw things…what was meant by that exactly?”

Valgavoth slowly shook his head in awkward disapproval. “Ish, why are you like this? Haven’t you ever heard of folklore or superstitions?”

“From what I read, the town was evacuated and left abandoned due to a monster.” N’gath whispered, almost to himself. Before I could speak up, I noticed a recognizable golden arch. 

“Pull into that McDonald’s N’gath. I want a goddamn McRib.” Valgavoth pointed at the McDonald’s sign like it was salvation, only for us to discover the building was completely dark. There was not a single soul in the parking lot and the drive-thru menu hung half off its metal frame. 

He cursed under his breath for a full minute before muttering that the universe was “a tasteless bitch.” We all laughed hysterically at his bitterness, our laughter thinning out as we ascended higher into the mountains. 

I don’t remember exactly when I fell asleep, but I remember waking to the sound of \*Beyond the Great Vast Forest\* by Emperor dissolving into static as our radio lost its signal. I looked out the passenger window to see that the roadside houses I’d been watching earlier had disappeared entirely into the darkness. 

Beyond the narrow cone of light from our dim headlights was but pitch-black pressing in. Snow whipped sideways, causing the asphalt from the road to be swallowed in places that erased the center line of the road entirely. The van hummed unevenly beneath us as the engine strained against the incline, causing the enclosed space to vibrate loudly. 

Valgavoth muttered something about the radio being garbage under his breath and reached for the dial to fix the signal. 

For a while, the only sounds were the engine’s labored whine and the rhythmic slap of snow against the windows. Every sweep of the windshield wipers smeared the world back into white noise. 

There were no signs of life other than the occasional reflective marker flashing and vanishing at the edge of the beams of our headlights. I found myself counting the seconds as I looked out the window, staring out at nothing. 

Suddenly, a heavy thud detonated against the passenger side. The metal of the vehicle boomed and I was driven hard into the door due to the impact, causing the breath to be punched clean out of my lungs. White sparks burst across my vision as N’gath fought the wheel. The van swerved violently across the narrow road toward the snow-choked shoulder before N’gath was able to stabilize the vehicle and snap us back onto the road.

Markov sat up in his seat having been woken up by the impact of whatever we had collided with. “What the hell was that?”

Before anyone could answer, an agonizingly slow, metallic scrape noise pierced the air. 

I turned my head to look outside my window, just in time to see a shape dart across the outside of our vehicle. I didn’t get a clear look, but before I could let anyone know about what I had seen, Ishkanah screamed. 

The roof dented inward and snow slid down the windshield in sheets from the weight pressing down above us.

“There’s someone on the van!” I cried out as another violent jolt rocked us forward.

“Hold on everyone!” N’gath declared through clenched teeth as he jerked the wheel hard to the left, causing us to fishtail. The tires screamed against the ice, the sudden force ripping the shape free from above. 

A sickening thud echoed through the still, night air as the body disappeared into the snowbank and the van came to a screeching halt several yards down the road. N’gath cut the engine and we sat in complete silence for what felt like an eternity trying to process what had just happened. 

Markov was the first to speak, his words being the ones to articulate what everyone else was afraid to speak into existence.

“I think…I think that was a guy.”

My stomach plummeted at the realization. We sat there in the freezing cold of the darkness, our breath fogging the windows as we listened for movement outside.

“We can’t just leave him,” Ishkanah pleaded in a whisper. “If we…if we killed someone—”

“WE…didn’t kill anybody. Got that?” Valgavoth turned in his seat to address us. “We’re going to pretend this didn’t happen and we’re going to drive away from here.”

“Are you fucking mental? We just hit a person and you want us to leave the scene of a crime?!” I cried out in anger as I reached for my door handle.

“We’re in the middle of fucking nowhere in the mountains Sherlock. Who is going to know? Besides, we were attacked first. We could just say it was in self-defense. The bastard was practically asking for this anyways.” 

Against my better judgment, I opened the door and felt the cold sting my face.

“Where are you going?” Markov asked as I unbuckled myself and stepped foot onto the snow-covered road outside.

“To do the right thing.”

No one moved at first. The only sound in the deafening quiet was the snow that continued to fall in thick sheets around the van. I half expected someone to argue or to tell me it was a bad idea, but guilt has a way of settling things faster than logic ever could. One by one, the hinges of the doors squeaked open, and seconds later, the sound of boots crunching in the snow could be heard following me. 

The darkness engulfed everything but the weak, yellow glow of our headlights as we made our way through the snow and into the treeline. My heart pounded harder with every step as the skid marks and churned powder morphed into dark smears until we approached the limp body at the end of the trail. 

“Jesus,” Markov whispered, his breath lingered in the air in a pale, trembling mist. “We killed him.”

I took another step closer, my boots crunching softly against the frozen terrain. Up close, something was off in a way I couldn’t articulate at the time. His clothes consisted of an old-fashioned dark coat and boots with no tread that were buried beneath the snow. The man’s chest didn’t rise, but I thought I saw the fingers of the arm twisted beneath him twitch.

“Guys, I think I saw movement.” I stated aloud as I approached and felt the ice-cold temperature of his hand against mine.

“We need to get him to a hospital!” Ishkanah declared as she crouched beside me to inspect the body.

Valgavoth rolled his eyes in annoyance. “We’re not taking him anywhere. He’s dead. End of story. Now let’s get back into the van before we freeze to death out here.” 

Before we could even acknowledge Valgavoth’s comment, the man’s eyes shot open. His pitch-black pupils reflected the van’s headlights before locking onto me. 

I didn’t have time to react. 

One moment he was in a crumbled heap in the snow, and the next he was airborne with the sudden and complete awareness of a predator.

The man tackled me and sent me sprawling backward hard enough to drive the air from my lungs in a panicked gasp. I screamed in terror as the man’s hands clamped down on both of my shoulders. His mouth ripped and tore at my hands as I raised them defensively on instinct. 

The demented and choked growling sound the man made didn’t sound like anything I had ever heard. It sounded ancient, primal, and most terrifying of all, hungry. His teeth scraped against the flesh of my hands, causing light drops of blood to fall onto my clothes. 

Ishkanah lunged forward instinctively, her fingers closing around my arm to pull me away, but the man reacted without turning to her. He struck her with one arm; the force sent her tumbling into the snow several feet away. She hit the ground hard, and her body let out a weak groan as she struggled to sit up.

“RUN!” Valgavoth shouted, his voice cracking as he rushed towards Ishkanah to drag her to safety while N’gath and Markov came to my aid.

Markov grabbed a nearby rock and launched it at the man’s head to seemingly no effect. N’gath found a decently sized tree branch on the ground and started whacking the man over the head with it in an effort to get him off of me.

After several sick thuds to the skull, the man lifted his head slowly. It was in that moment that we noticed that he wasn’t a man at all. He was something else entirely.

His mouth was dripping wet with saliva as he flashed his teeth and turned toward N’gath and Markov. I knew I had a small window of opportunity in that moment, so I took advantage of the distraction and pushed the man off me. 

I began running back to the van with the others, turning back once to see the frenzied gaze in the man’s eyes as we sprinted. The bitter cold tore at my legs and my lungs felt like they were on fire as we got closer to the van. 

Behind us, we heard a shrill scream echo as the man continued his pursuit. The headlights in the distance signaled safety as Valgavoth and Ishkanah were the first to reach the van.

Valgavoth helped Ishkanah get inside and yanked the driver’s side door open just as the rest of us were able to pile inside in a blind panic. Not even a moment later, the man slammed into the side of the vehicle, causing the entire van to shake. The metal groaned from the impact, the van nearly tipping over on its side.

“GO!” Markov yelled with urgency as Valgavoth turned to N’gath.

“GIMME THE FUCKING KEYS!!!” 

N’gath frantically searched his pockets and tossed them to Valgavoth. Outside, there was another screech and another thud that made the van slide a few feet across the road. Valgavoth turned the keys in the ignition, and floored it out of there.

The van jerked forward violently as we took off, but we were not alone. The man clung to the rear door and punched through the steel with his long, pale fingers. Under the immense pressure and strength of our attacker, the doors buckled and the metal began being ripped apart like paper.

“If he tears the doors open, we’re going to lose our equipment!” Markov shouted as he looked to Valgavoth for ideas.

Valgavoth never took his eyes off the road. “I’m not sure what you’re expecting from me, I’m the one driving!”

That’s when N’gath chimed in. “Ulalek, unlock the door and see if you can knock him off somehow.”

“Have you lost your goddamn mind?!” I protested. “How do you expect me to get this dude off our van?”

“FIGURE IT OUT!” Valgavoth jerked the wheel again, harder this time. The van’s tires screeched as we narrowly avoided contact with the guardrail. Whoever, or rather, whatever was clinging to the back barely reacted. A hand punched near the door handle, causing its fingers to curl inward.

Markov let out a laugh that was halfway between hysteria and shock. “Yeah, easy for you to say that while we’re being peeled open like a fucking can of Campbell’s.”

“STOP ARGUING,” Ishkanah snapped from her seat, where she was bracing herself against an amp.

I stared at the side door handle, as my heart pounded so hard it started to blur my vision. The metal surrounding the rear doors bowed inward again, and snow blasted through the holes in harsh, stinging bursts.

N’gath didn’t raise his voice, but instead remained calm as ever somehow. “You do not need to fight it, you only need to distract it.”

The van hit a bump and I slammed shoulder-first into the side of the vehicle. From outside, we could hear an excited scream echo as one of its hands disappeared through the door entirely. It dragged its fingers blindly along the interior metal as Valgavoth glanced in the rearview mirror at the sheer carnage unfolding.

“We’re running out of van!” He yelled before turning his attention back to the road, hands firmly planted on the steering wheel.

“No shit man!” I heard Markov scream as I unlocked the side door before I could second guess my decision. The moment the latch clicked, the door rattled violently and caved inward slightly. I hastily slid the door open, and in a blinding white rush, the icy wind bombarded the interior. 

I shuddered as I gripped the door, watching the road pass by in a blur below. I looked to my left and right, and it was on the right-hand side of the van that I could make out the man clinging sideways to the rear. Like a Spider clinging to a wall, gravity seemed to not have any effect on him in the slightest. 

With unsettling ease, the joints in his body flexed and adjusted with every jolt from our vehicle navigating the road. His knuckles were bloody and worn from the repeated seams and dents it left in the van. 

“What the fuck is going on out there?” Markov asked as he and Ishkanah watched me from inside.

I didn’t think about my next move, I just grabbed the first thing my hand found and held onto it like a lifeline. The mic stand I gripped was slick with the condensation from the palms of my sweaty, bleeding hands. I trembled at the wind tearing at me through the open door but braved the elements enough to slowly lean outside. 

The van rocked abruptly and nearly threw me out, causing me to instinctively grab onto the door and catch my balance. The thing clinging to the rear noticed my stumble and crawled across the metal towards me. Then, in an attempt to keep him at bay, I swung.

The metallic clang from the mic stand rang out on impact with its body and sent a rattling sensation through my arms. Its grip faltered and it shrieked with pain, but it didn’t let go. He hung there with his boots skidding uselessly against the bumper, scrabbling for purchase. With an outstretched arm, he turned toward me, and his blackened eyes locked onto mine. 

I tried to pull back and get the door shut as quickly as possible, but it lunged anyway. His mouth opened so wide that I could see his serrated teeth. 

As the gap between us closed, the van swerved, causing me to stagger and reflexively throw the mic stand up between us. I closed my eyes and felt an abrupt jolt, followed by a sickly thud and the sound of wheezing.

I opened my eyes to find his face pressed close to mine with the mic stand buried through his chest at an angle I hadn’t anticipated. Blood slid down the metal pole in slow, crimson drops that felt eerily warm against my hands. His breath washed over my face, smelling like rancid meat as it shuddered and gasped for life. All I could think in that moment was that I hadn’t meant to do that, I only wanted to make everything stop.

“DUDE YOU KILLED HIM!!!” Markov exclaimed as Ishkanah looked like she was trying her best to refrain from puking.

“You killed him?” N’gath asked as he turned around to see for himself.

“I’m putting this thing in park.” Valgavoth stated coldly as he gently pressed on the brakes and a few moments later, the van had come to a stop next to the guardrail.

I let go of the mic stand and watched the lifeless body whose blood covered my hands fall to the ground outside. I tossed the bloody, bent mic stand into the snow before N’gath could get a good look at it. For a while, the only sounds that could be heard were our ragged breathing, and the drip… drip… drip of gasoline leaking somewhere beneath us.

After what felt like eons, Ishkanah whispered the question that was on everybody’s minds. ”What do we do now?”

I swallowed the bile that had accumulated in my throat. “I’m not sure.”

“Like I told y’all earlier,” Valgavoth said. “We get rid of the body and pretend that none of this ever happened. Had everyone just listened to me we wouldn’t have ended up in this mess.”

“We can’t just pretend we’re safe here, we need to go back home. It’s too dangerous.” I looked at everyone in hopes that they would side with me.

He shook his head in frustration before slamming his hands down on the steering wheel. “In case you’ve forgotten jackass, we have traveled a long way to go to this place that N’gath INSISTED was the perfect place for recording our album. I’m not going to turn around just because some bozo doped up on ketamine or whatever thought that attacking our van in the middle of the night was peak entertainment.”

“He nearly killed us back there! You and I both know that he…he wasn’t human…  ” I explained before drifting off, afraid to finish my thought.

“Oh don’t tell me that you actually believe that this guy is what you’re trying to imply he is.” Valgavoth scoffed. “If you believe that then you’re a bigger dumbass than I thought.”

“No one here is a dumbass.” N’gath replied.

“Let’s just…move past this and work together as a group.” Ishkanah stated, still gripping to the loose equipment tightly as if any moment they could fall out.

“There is no moving past this, we leave now.” I insisted as I tried to reach for the keys in the ignition.

“You’re right, we leave now, but we’re not turning around.” Valgavoth swatted my hand away before I could touch the keys. “Newsflash, I’m the one behind the wheel so I’m in charge. I didn’t just nearly lose my life going up a mountain from your average meth head hanging around a 7/11 to not record this album. Now you guys can either join me or get the fuck out of this van and y’all can party it up out here in the tundra.”

An uncomfortable quiet overtook the van as everyone sat and pondered the next course of action. Nobody wanted to challenge Valgavoth’s stubborn, headstrong nature, but at the same time, nobody wanted to have this trip mean nothing.

“Look, we did come all this way. Let’s just get rid of the body and get out of here.”

That was the most level-headed and down-to-earth response I had ever heard leave Markov’s mouth. His words earned an approving nod from Valgavoth who turned the keys in the ignition to start the van up.

“Now we’re talking. Let’s make this fast, I want to make it to our destination by sunrise so we can get some proper rest.”

The engine purred unevenly as we stepped out into the cold once more, the snowfall and wind biting through our clothes.

Up close, the body looked monstrous in a way I hadn’t noticed before. I tried not to think about it or so much as make eye contact with the body as we lifted and dragged it toward the rail. My boots slipped on the ice, forcing my breath to come out in a burst of panic.

“It’s okay,” Ishkanah whispered quietly, just barely audible above the crunch of the snow. “You’re okay.”

N’gath and Markov nodded in agreement as Valgavoth kept his focus and grip on the body. Her reassurance helped me steady myself as best as I could to complete the task at hand. None of us spoke a word as we approached a narrow turnout where the guardrail bent inward. The area in that spot dropped away into nothing but darkness, and that’s where we decided to dispose of the body.

Together, as one, we heaved. When we went to let go, the coat from the body nearly got caught on the metal rail causing the fabric to snag against the long-rusted bolts. With a united shove from all of us however, the body tipped, rolled, and vanished over the edge.

I’m not entirely sure how long we stood there, but I know it was longer than we should have. We expected to hear a scream, a thud, or something that confirmed gravity still worked the way it was supposed to. But we never heard anything aside from the vast, engulfing sound of silence and its aftermath.

Eventually Valgavoth muttered and broke the silence. “Let’s get back to the van.”

With that, we all walked back to the van, secured the back doors, and got settled in. Valgavoth pressed his foot down on the gas and we surged ahead into the night. 

A little while later, Ishkanah spoke, her voice barely audible above the whir of the engine. “Is this why the town was abandoned?”

Nobody cut through the stunned silence except for Valgavoth who didn’t even bother looking at her.

“No,” he said immediately. “And don’t say that again.”

That was the last time any of us decided to speak.

I’m writing this as we continue toward the chapel, too anxious to feel how exhausted my body must be feeling right now as I’m pressed against the equipment. No one has spoken since we got back on the road, and I don’t think anyone plans to. 

I keep watching the rearview mirror, expecting to see something following us through the snow, but the road behind us is empty from what I can tell. 

A part of me knows we should turn back, that whatever we threw over that guardrail was an omen, but this trip is everything we’ve worked toward, and no one is willing to be the first to say that fear meant more than our dreams. 

If something else happens, I’ll give an update. If I don’t, then understand that nothing stopped us from turning back. 

We just didn’t
