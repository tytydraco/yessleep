Excuse how bad my writing is I've never been someone that was good at telling stories but anyways. A couple of years ago in October my parents and I went down to my grandfather's beach house in North Carolina for my birthday.

 His house was always my favorite to visit because it was secluded from the town and had a beautiful dock that looked out into the water. After 8 hours or so of driving we arrived at his house, it was fairly late so we all said our quick hellos and went to bed. 

I passed out almost immediately but was awoken from a weird sound outside my room at the ungodly hour of 2am, I didn't think much of it and just figured it was my Grandpa's old dog. 20 minutes passed and I couldn't fall back asleep to save my life, so I thought "fuck it. " and grabbed my bag and walked out to the dock.

 It was pitch black, chilly but not too bad and all I could hear was crickets and of course, the water splashing up against the dock and my grandpa's boat. I sat down at the very end, played Billy Idol on my phone and began rolling and smoking a jo!nt.

 After a couple of puffs I was hardcore spacing out gazing into the dark water in front of me, I don't remember what I was thinking about but I was vibing until I quickly snapped out of it when I noticed a dark mass pass by in the water in front of me, too small to be a shark but to big to be any regular fish.

 I had always been afraid of the ocean so it creeped me out a good bit, but I ended up convincing myself it was the weed even though I didn't feel high.

 A couple of minutes passed and I started to feel paranoid it felt like someone or something was watching me and I kept seeing moving in the water in my peripherals. I decided I finally had enough and was way too fucked up to be out there.

 So I started packing everything back into my bag and as soon as I turned off the music I noticed that it was quieter than before, the crickets seemed to have disappeared and the water was weirdly still.

 I remember mumbling "fuck this" and got up. what I saw a couple feet out in the water in front of me I will never forget. It was a head submerged up to its eyes, the dim lighting from the dock illuminating it slightly.

 I stood there frozen in fear, unable to fully process what I was seeing. It had the appearance of a man, with dark long hair, and strong intense eyes. I was unable to move it felt like I was in a trance, keeping my eyes locked with it's. Every possible thought and explanation ran through my head all at once, and just like a white dumbass in a horror movie I muttered "hello?"

 It then began to lift it's head out of the water revealing the rest of it's face and without breaking eye contact it whispered "hello." back to me. I ran to the house as fast as I could, I was losing my mind I didn't even know how I managed to fall asleep that night. For days I was trying to figure out if it was a dream? or hallucination?, but I could remember every detail. 

And the craziest part is that I've never stopped seeing it. I see it every time I visit. I see it in my dreams, and my nightmares. I know the majority of you aren't going to believe me and I really don't blame you, I wouldn't believe me either.

 Everyone I've told this story too either didn't believe me or told me what I saw was a mermaid, like ariel type shit. But it felt dark, and unfriendly, yet aluring?

 Has anyone experienced this before? Down in the East coast specifically? I just want an explanation. But thank you for reading, if you've had any experiences similar to this or any information please let me know.
