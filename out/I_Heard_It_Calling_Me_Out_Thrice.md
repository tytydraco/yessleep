I remember it like it was just yesterday. The way I felt at that time; it was like no other. I thought I was going to scream, cry, or hide in my closet. But, I did not. I did not want it to know the fear I felt, nor wake up my parents, which would be worse.

I was 18 years old. It was around 10:00 PM. I was eating a late dinner, because I had to finish my homework and do some nighttime chores. I placed the chopsticks on top of the seafood cup noodles to let it settle for 3 minutes. I searched for a perfectly good show to watch on Ne****, and found one of my favorite shows, which is H** I M** Y*** M*****.

"I didn't know Ne***** has H** I M** Y*** M*****," I told myself and clicked the play button. I put on my wired earphones, while it was loading. When the first episode played, it was a perfect timing. The cup noodles was ready. And so, I started to eat and slurp the noodles. A few minutes in the show, I finished eating. I paused it, threw the empty cup noodles, and washed the chopsticks. Afterwards, I went back to watching. It was there and then I heard it.

"Psst," It called out to me softly, as if it wanted to get my attention. And, it did. I removed one of my earphones, and turned around. I checked to see who it was. It was dark outside, so I couldn't perfectly see. When I realized the lights were turned off, I paused the show and turned on the switch. I checked it out once more, and there was none. Nobody was outside. 

"Maybe it's just the neighborhood kids...?" I shrugged it off, and went back to watching. I checked the time, and it was 10:30 PM. A few minutes later, I heard it again. 

"Psst," this time, it was a little louder. Loud enough to feel like it was calling out just outside the screen door. I removed one of my earphones, and turned around again. There was no one. "What the hell..." I was baffled and confused. Who was calling me out?

I shrugged it off once more, and put on my earphone. It was at a part when two of the characters went on a date. I laughed a little too hard to the point I needed to catch my breath. Then, it was at that time I felt it. I felt the chills running from my spine, and the goosebumps on my skin. 

"Psst!" It called out to me, but this time it felt like it was beside me. More precisely, it felt like it called out to me by the ear. I removed my earphones and immediately ran upstairs. When I was outside the bedroom door, my legs gave out. I was shaking. Not only that, my heart was also beating fast. "F****** hell..." I cursed under my breath. What was that? 

When I remembered I left my laptop downstairs, I burrowed my face onto the palm of my hands. "Ahh, I don't want to go down..." I cried out softly. But, I have to muster up my courage. I had to, or I would have to face the consequence of getting scolded in the morning by my mother for eating late again. "Ugh, I could hear her telling me off about my health again..."

And so, with the remaining courage I had, I stood up and went downstairs. Halfway through, I checked to see if it's there. "Coast is clear... I guess." I continued going down, ran as fast as I can to take my laptop and earphones, and sped upstairs to my bedroom. 

I laid down on my bed thinking about what happened. It was then I realized something odd. 

While I was watching, I was wearing my earphones and set the volume to the maximum.

How did I hear it calling me out thrice?
