I didn’t want to write this. After what happened in my last post, I figured I’d just stay quiet, try to forget. But if I don’t get this out of my head, I don’t think I’ll sleep again.

Because it happened again.

And this time was worse.

⸻

Why We Went Back Out

We swore we’d never go back to that first forest. Too many memories, too many close calls. But after a couple of weeks, someone suggested a different spot.

A forest not too far away, but with a completely different reputation. Not creepy. Not dangerous. If anything, it was the opposite. People said it was more of a “make-out” spot. Couples sneaking away late at night for… well, not exactly horror stories.

That made it feel safer. A stupid kind of logic, but it worked at the time. If people came here for that kind of thing, then surely it wasn’t the kind of place where something darker would happen.

We thought we’d be fine.

But I was wrong.

Entering the Trees

It was later than our last trip. Darker, colder. The streetlights barely reached the edges of the treeline, and once we stepped inside, the world narrowed down to shadows and silence.

The ground was soft with leaves, muffling our footsteps. It should’ve felt peaceful. It didn’t.

Every time I turned my head, I thought I saw movement. A shadow too thick against the trees. A branch bending when there was no wind.

We joked to cover it up, trying to sound casual. But our laughs were sharp and fake, and nobody really smiled.

Then we heard him.

⸻

The Follower

At first, I thought I imagined it. A crunch behind us, too heavy to be one of us. Then again. Louder.

We stopped, turned.

That’s when we saw him.

A man. Standing just off the path. No light. No phone. Just a shape among the trees.

We froze. For a second, nobody moved.

Then he stepped forward.

⸻

We Run

One of my mates panicked. He lived up the road from the entrance, so he bailed, muttering that he was done with this. He turned back and disappeared into the dark.

The rest of us? We ran.

Not all-out sprinting, but that quick, desperate pace where you’re half convinced you’re about to trip. Branches slapped at our arms, roots caught our feet, but we didn’t dare stop.

I glanced back — and nearly fell.

He was closer.

Somehow, despite us running, he had closed the distance. His movements were strange, not quite a sprint, not quite a walk. Just… gliding forward, steady, deliberate.

And in his hand — I swear I saw it — a stick. Or something long. The way he held it wasn’t casual. It was like he was ready.

⸻

The Shop

We didn’t stop until we were out of the forest and at the shop.

The same shop from before.

It felt almost safe there. The glow of the lights, the sound of traffic nearby. We tried to shake it off. Bought sweets, fizzy drinks, sugar to calm our nerves.

It didn’t work. My hands were trembling so badly I nearly dropped my change.

But we pretended anyway.

⸻

The Football Pitch

We headed to the football pitch, the same one from before. At least it was open, familiar.

We sat there for a while, but the cold got to us. Eventually we went inside, grateful for the warmth and the lights. For a while, it almost felt normal again.

But then one of my friends stood up. Said he had to leave. He slipped out without much explanation.

Minutes later, he came back — white as a sheet.

“GUYS. THERE’S CLOWNS.”

He wasn’t laughing. His voice cracked, his eyes wide. He was shaking.

Before we could ask anything, he ran out again, this time shouting into the night, trying to get someone’s attention.

We didn’t even think. We bolted for the fire exit.

⸻

The Voice

The door slammed open and the cold hit us like a wall. We spilled out into the night, our breaths clouding in the air.

That’s when we heard it.

“Hello, boys.”

The voice came from the dark. Low. Calm. Too calm.

I can’t explain it. It wasn’t just what he said. It was how. Like he already knew us. Like he’d been waiting.

We ran.

⸻

The Sprint

We tore through the streets. My lungs felt like fire, my throat raw, but I couldn’t stop.

J, my mate with torn ligaments, couldn’t keep up. He limped, fell behind, stumbling. I grabbed his arm, practically dragging him along as we both screamed at him to move.

And every time I looked back, I swore he was closer. That man. That shape. The stick in his hand catching the faintest glint of light.

How? We were running full speed. He shouldn’t have been able to keep up. But every corner we turned, every glance over my shoulder — he was there.

Not sprinting. Not struggling. Just moving. Smooth. Steady. Relentless.

⸻

Back to the Shop

We made it back to the shop, gasping for air, our hearts hammering. For a few moments, it felt like we’d shaken him.

But none of us really believed it.

The others split off, heading for home. Me and J stuck together for a while, but eventually we parted ways too.

That’s when I saw him.

⸻

The Man at the Shop

Behind the shop.

A man.

Too still. Just a shape, half-hidden in the dark.

I couldn’t see his face. Couldn’t tell if it was the same guy. Couldn’t tell if he was holding the stick again.

But I knew.

I knew it was him.

⸻

The Run Home

The walk from the shop to my house normally takes ten minutes. That night, I did it in two.

I don’t remember my feet hitting the pavement. Just the burn in my chest, the blur of the streetlights, the terror clawing at me from behind.

When I slammed my front door shut, I collapsed to the floor, gasping, unable to catch my breath.

⸻

What Haunts Me

I keep telling myself it was just paranoia. That maybe he was just some random guy. That maybe my friend was wrong about the clowns.

But then I remember how he kept getting closer. How no matter how fast we ran, he stayed on us, calm, steady, holding that stick like he was ready for something.

And I can’t forget the voice.

“Hello, boys.”

Not loud. Not threatening. Just… knowing.

And last night, when I looked out my window, I saw a shape at the corner of my street.

Not moving. Just standing.

A faint splash of white. A shimmer of red.

And I don’t think I imagined it.
