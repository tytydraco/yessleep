i remember it as clear as day, the memory is still fresh in my mind despite it happening years ago.

this one night in 2020 i had a dream about the woods and exploring it. at this time i lived in a trailer home with my mom (who was in the second trimester of her pregnancy), my step dad, my sisters and brother. the home was surrounded by woods so sometimes we'd walk through them for fun because my step dad knew his way around. 

in the dream tho, no one was with me, it was just me. i woke up a bit scared and confused but brushed it off because i had been having bad dreams a lot during that time. the day after, we all go in the woods, on the same path i had seen in my dream, everything was exactly how i remembered it. it was so weird but i didnt say anything because i didnt want to scare my little sister or something.

we kept walking and as we walked we grew closer to this part of the woods that was completely empty, besides this very large house right in the middle. it was very obviously abandoned, but the grass was cut and everything around it seemed recently taken care of which was odd but whatever am i right? when my step dad sees the house he makes us turn back immediately so we start heading out the woods. it was suspicious with the way my step dad wanted to leave so quickly but i didnt pay much mind to it.

we never talked about it again nor did we ever go in the woods again where the house was located. 

skip a year or two and my cousins are living with us now, my step dad ended up passing away may of 2020. 

me and my cousins are bored and decide to go explore the woods because they thought it'd be fun. i agree and we leave the house and walk in the woods. i tell them the story of the house i saw that day and they don't believe me so i take them to where it was, i could see the tip of the house slightly so i tell them we are almost there but when we get there, there was no house. the lawn was still cut but it looked like no house ever existed there. so i try to explain to them there was one but they don't believe me. i give up on try to make them understand and we walk out the woods, going to another part that was a clear path rather than trees being in the way. 

theres another story to tell on what happened when we went there, it doesnt have anything to do with the house but it happened. 

after we went to the other part we realized its a place homeless people hang out at and we found a lot of stolen stuff, like painting, book boxes, etc. we walk further into the  woods and find a mattress, toilet, and clothes, along with a mirror pinned to a tree. we hang out there and analyze the place before we see a goat skull on one of the trees. we go to it and check it out before leaving the area. 

as we walk back we notice another trail and it was shorter than the first one, we walk down it only to find a burnt tree with something pinned to it and the ground was made into a circle. (the ground was burnt too but there were small items we could kind of make out.) after we see that we get scared because wtf is that? so we run out the woods and apparently we had been gone for THREE hours. my mom had called the police and had the neighbors calling out to us but we never heard them. when we left the woods that has the house we had only been out for 30 mins. 

we go to my mom and shes mad that we left yet we told her we were leaving. 

when we got home, we went on omegle at night, trolling people, but before we went to sleep, we went to the living room because we kept hearing noises. when they stopped we started to go back to the room and when we turned around, in the mirror we saw that same goat skill but with a black cloak.

we ran into my bedroom and locked the door, hiding there for the whole night terrified. i never forgot about it since.
