In the next moment it lunged at me like a viper, but without moving at all. An invisible spike of cold intent stabbed at my mind with a force that almost whipped my head back, nailing me to the seat. As I reeled from the assault, it began picking through my thoughts, patiently searching for something very specific. 

I stared at the thing in my lap as my body sank into deep shock. It tilted its head and smiled a thin smile, head nodding serenely as it stabbed at my mind with its thoughts. Through waves of outrage, I gaped at it, unable to move.  

I could see now that everything about it was unnatural.  The way it breathed, the way it slowly blinked its eyes. Its body was small and frail, but the very air around it radiated with a potent strength.  

Now that my eyes were adjusting to the light, I could see that its own eyes were deep set and knowing, devoid of pity, and they glittered at me from their sockets.  

I can’t begin tell you how much I wanted to get away from that thing. Every nerve and muscle screamed at me to get far away from it. That instinctive voice screamed at me to run.  

Kill it if you can, but run.  

The other thing I felt was pure dismay. That’s the only word for it. The very fact that this thing existed filled me with a dread that I can’t express. Knowing that it crawled the earth was bad enough, but being trapped in this small space with it… having it touch me… feeling its cold, invisible tendrils burrow their way deeper into my mind… ‘Violated’ is the closest word I can think of to describe how I felt, and that falls very, very short.  

Its mind swarmed with a darkness so foul that I dared not examine it any closer. My eyes continued to look ahead at the weak vessel perched on my legs. As it sifted through my memories, I could feel how immense the true nature of the thing was. It surrounded me, enveloped the car and surrounding bushland outside. The radius of its presence must have reached a kilometre at least. Now that I was connected to it, I could sense all of the animals who quivered within that radius. They clung to their branches and flattened themselves against the earth, instincts reeling against the vast intruder. The trees themselves groaned at the transgression of it, and the grass screamed. 

I don’t know how I managed to do it. I’d never been in a situation remotely like this, an internal fight for survival, but for whatever reason I instinctively exhumed some Taylor Swift lyrics and thrust them into the searching, ice-cold tendrils that scooped and picked at my memories. The thing’s smile faltered as it was forced to process the lyrics one word at a time, as I silently shouted them.  

While it was brushing aside this inane string of words, I sensed a brief gap in its assault and I took it. Willing my body to act, I lunged at it with my left hand in one swift movement, my right hand flicking the driver’s door unlocked. I had to grab this thing by the neck and smash its head into the dashboard.  

But it was quicker than me.  

I’d managed to get the door unlocked, but before my left hand could close around its neck, it flooded my mind with its memories. Centuries of them. They gushed into my head - a cacophony of sight and sound, faces and rooms. 

Looking up out of a crib. Bumping along a road in a baby carriage. Endless baptisms. A procession of mothers crying, screaming.  Hundreds of them… and fathers… siblings. Hundreds of hundreds.  

My skull felt as it was about to burst, and my arms fell limp at my sides, dead as my tongue. The force of its immense will rode behind the flickering memories, rising like a monolithic tidal wave. This wave eclipsed my own will, engulfing it, washing it away to nothing. I knew in that instant that it didn’t yet know my name, and that’s what it needed to control my body.  All the same, it could overwhelm me with its own vast memories to the point where I would be crippled physically.  

The thing closed its eyes for a second, and I could feel it abandoning its search through my memories and it began picking at the frontal lobes of my brain, digging for my motor cortex. It began gathering up the threads of me that carried the signals to my limbs in its spindled mind-fingers, like a spider savaging another’s web. It gripped at these untended threads of me with a workman-like familiarity. I was reminded of an old woman I’d once watched skin a rabbit in Peru. She had carried out the operation with such sure-handed ease that she must have committed the dull atrocity hundreds of times.  

-Thousands.- 

The thing casually projected the word into my head, not bothering to speak out loud now that we knew each other. It gathered up the last threads of me like a puppeteer picking up a dropped marionette, and it squeezed.  

My senses screamed in protest as the last shred of control was crushed from me, the flow of command from my mind to my body pinched off like a kink in a hose. I knew that I would be unable to move until it released its grip.  

The connection between us meant that I could sense other things now. I knew somehow that it couldn’t access my memories while it was squeezing this conduit closed. And it didn’t care that I knew.  

Every nerve in my body sang with raw outrage. It was the worst, most intimate abuse that I had ever suffered in all my short years, and I tugged at the threads of myself with all my might.   

-Mine. -

The thing stated it as fact, and so it was. The wave of that terrible word thundered through me, dragging me with it. My mind screamed a hollow note as I lost my grip. 

It had me now, and it crawled into my mind like a greasy spider. 

I was suddenly saturated with the sour taste of the thing as it showed itself to me. It pointed to the jumbled chaos of images, sounds and thoughts - the legion of memories that it was now cramming into my mind.  That first wave was nothing compared to this. I turned my focus towards them, searching for a weakness. In the chaos, it allowed me to know a few truths: 

 

This thing was ancient. 

It had no name.  

It had travelled here long ago on a wooden ship.  

Folk tales had only guessed at its true nature. 

It needed mother’s milk to feed.  

 

The resentment that it felt towards humans for being dependant on us to survive was a bottomless pit of seething revulsion. It especially loathed women with a fiery hatred that I can’t begin to describe.  

It grew tired of me probing for answers, and it silenced me with more words, not bothering to speak them aloud. 

-Where is he?-

It cocked its head at the dark window. And internally conjured up the face of the man who’d been outside the car.  

-I don’t know. Outside somewhere-

There was no point lying to this thing. I couldn’t tell exactly which of my thoughts it could still monitor.  

Beside us, Natia twitched in her sleep under her purple coat. Her dream had caught an echo of the thing as its will pulsed from its soft head, penetrating rock, tree, flesh and mind. I could feel Natia retreating into her sleep for refuge, deeper. Deeper. 

The thing ‘spoke’ again. 

-You’re not ready to be a mother. But you could be.-  

It showed me a series of young women from its past, smiling down as it fed. A carefully curated stream of memories that felt worn, like dog-eared pages in a favourite book. This was its adoption pitch.  

-I can make you happy- 

It flooded my brain with sweet endorphins, and I felt my body relax, smiling despite myself.

-That’s it, pet- 

My smile faded. It was doing something to me now, manipulating the settings deep in the core of me.  

My breasts began to ache.  

-Oh God no- 

-It takes only two sunsets. I’ll be very hungry by then-  

The thing smiled a bitter imitation of a smile. It’s hard to describe how sickening it is to see such an insincere expression on the face of a baby. It licked its lips.  

-I will NOT!-

I shouted back into the abyss with all the strength of thought I had left.  

-Fuck you- 

It didn’t like this. 

The ‘smile’ evaporated on its lips, and its tiny red tongue disappeared back into its mouth. Its eyes closed and it wedged a new kind of image into my head. It played out like a movie and branched out into dozens of possibilities. Every one of them began with me killing Natia. One strand saw me drag her twitching body into the forest and driving off into the night. Another had me waiting by the road covered in her blood, held in place until a passing car found me. One showed me scalping Natia with my car keys and wearing her hair as a hat.

It could tell which of these scenarios upset me the most because they soon shone brighter and sharper than the others. The clearest, most vivid ones involved me eating Natia’s heart by the side of the road. For a full half hour it showed me these possible futures, painting each one in lurid detail.  

-Insult me again…-

It nodded towards Natia, who slept on peacefully. Then it showed me a selection of young women that it had actually forced to carry out its vilest fantasies.  Brief red scenes of abject horror swam into view. I will never forget them. 

A procession of families it had defiled through the centuries, its victims making victims of their loved ones.  

It had forced them to eat and eat until their gullets were clogged with flesh. Now it flashed me the glimpses of the remains, labelling each one in turn: 

Husband… wife… wife… daughter… twin 

-See?-

It showed me how it had made them smile as they did it. 

-See?- 

-Yes. Very creative- 

-More?- 

-Please no…- 

-Manners, then-

-Yes. Okay. Manners. I see. Yes- 

Natia stirred again. The thing did not break eye contact with me. A few minutes ago I had wanted with all my soul for her to wake up and save me from this malignant little fucker. Now I prayed that she stayed asleep. There was no telling what this thing would do to her. I had to get us out of this. Somehow.  

There was something about its threats that felt hollow…false somehow. It didn’t have my name yet. Most of the memories it had shown me featured young women that looked like me. And yet… it hadn’t exerted this control over me and forced my body to perform its twisted acts. Why? I could sense that it desperately, urgently wanted me to be its little meat puppet. It needed the key to fully control me, and it didn’t have it yet. 

DON’T LET IT KNOW YOUR NAME 

The cold thing in my lap twitched. It didn’t like my new train of thought. It syphoned fresh horrors from its memory into mine. These brief scenes flooded into my skull on an endless black tide. Each one had been preserved and examined thousands of times by their creator, and bore the careworn taste of cherished memories. A toddler eating his baby sister. A nosy priest forced to chew on the shards of a mirror. A woman puppeteered into peeling the soft skin from the underside of her wrist with a potato peeler and feeding the twisting skin to the family dog.  

And then there were the births.  

It had clearly crawled up inside dozens of young women through the ages to simulate a natural pregnancy and it treated me to a first-person view of its many harrowing deliveries. It had been saving these. The number of suspicious midwives that it had disposed of once they’d remarked on the lack of umbilical cord and placenta were in the thousands.  

It began to tell me that my own birthing scene would soon be added to the collection and I knew immediately that this was not just a hollow threat. It was going to crawl into me feet first whether it could puppeteer my body or not. It would hold me in paralysis until it was ready to be ‘born’ if it had to. Everyone I knew would believe that this thing was my baby, and if I told them otherwise, it would not end well for me. I knew it in the marrow of my bones that this was my future.  

I stared through these new horrors, telling myself they were just a trailer for some forced-birth horror movie that I had no interest in watching.  

I pulled my thoughts out of their spiralling tailspin of panic. I needed to distract this thing in a way that still allowed me to think and plot an escape. Song lyrics had worked… I needed something I could recite mindlessly, on repeat. I quickly settled on the alphabet.  

I thought-shouted my ABCs slowly and with great purpose, firing each letter into the middle of its face. It grimaced, and began to internally swat the letters away. I experimented with a faster pace, thinking each letter in a monotone. This was less effective. Was it the sing-song nature of it that did the job? The alphabet was basically just… what was it? Twinkle, twinkle little… 

-Be quiet!-

Wait… you know what would be even worse/better?  Happy birthday.  

I began shout-singing Happy birthday in my head, making sure to conjure the most obnoxious singing voice I could muster.  

I felt the thing release its grip on me. Just a crack. My arms and legs tingled. I could twitch my fingers. The thing had closed its eyes, and I could feel it slip through the crack it had just made and rummage around in my mind again with its ice-cold fingers. It was desperate now to find what it needed while it batted away at my happy birthday to yous. 

My name.  

That’s what it needed to drive me. Otherwise I was just a car without the keys.  

-happy birthday, dear… babyyy…- 

I was dangerously close to singing my own name there but I focused on the dark, furrowed face in front of me and sang to it so that my own name couldn’t enter my mind. 

Shit. How long could I keep this up?  I sang until I had four renditions completed and was rounding on the fifth. Why had I picked a song with an interchangeable name in it? I had to change the channel. In the second it took me to discard ‘Happy birthday’ and reach for ‘Pop Goes the Weasel,” the thing seized on my momentary lack of focus and scurried deeper into my head, searching for the key.  

Nothing.  

I started skipping round and round the mulberry bush and the rummaging halted. It really, *really* hated this one.  

-the monkey stopped to pull up its socks…- 



‘What in the fuck?!’ 

Natia was awake. She rubbed lazily at her eye, staring at the newborn baby sitting upright in my lap. She smiled a sleepy smile.  

‘Girl are you seeing this?’ 

The bloated slug of my tongue pushed against my teeth. I could barely move it, much less conjure speech. 

The thing turned to Natia and opened its blue eyes wide, in an adorably comic act of cutesy surprise.  

‘Hi,’ it simpered. ‘What’s your name?’ 

Natia’s head retracted, eyebrows poised in a quizzical ‘the fuck did you say to me?’ kind of way.  

Her face dropped and she turned to me, ‘Girl, what did I tell y...’ The words trailed off as we locked eyes. Tears streamed down my face and fear poured out of me. I was in a fight for my life, and she saw it immediately. 

I felt half of its focus seep out of me and gather itself before stabbing into the depths of her. It happened in less than a second. My vocal cords were released and a sob escaped my chest. 

My hand fumbled blindly for the door handle.  

Natia convulsed beside me. A single jolt. The thing had kept a spike of itself tethered to the base of my skull, and through this sinewy thread I sensed that it was quickly gathering up the threads of her. It had her completely, and it shrieked her name over and over again into the deepest recesses of her mind. How?  How had it found her name so quickly? I kept singing loudly inside the breached confines of my head. My skull rang with it.  

-…pop goes the weasel-

The thing turned its small, vast, terrible, delicate head towards me, eyes glinting with the purest spite.  

-I’ll have her get a name out of you, pet- 

Whatever it was doing to Natia, it was almost done. She would be its instrument, and together they would torture my name out of me. There was no way I would be able to fight her off - even if I wasn’t in this weakened state.  

I knew that it had already ruled out Natia as a possible surrogate. It found the very idea of breast feeding from her brown skin repulsive beyond comprehension, and it disliked being inside her head very much.  

She was fighting back. Hard. It needed to dedicate more of its strength to finish the job on her.  I could hear the distant echoes of her fighting through the thin tunnel that still connected me to the thing in my lap. Her will was strong. She raged and stormed against it, pushing back with every ounce of strength she had. The baby shook with the effort of penetrating her iron mind. Suddenly, I felt the thing release me so that it could dedicate every ounce of its resolve to the battle. I knew that she was no match for it now. The thing shook with the power of its renewed assault.  

The baby surrendered its grip on my motor cortex, but kept a spike of itself deep in the base of my skull, to monitor my thoughts. Now released, my limbs flooded with blood, and they prickled with a million pins and needles.  My hands were mine again, and I went to seize the shuddering baby by the throat so that I could throw it out into the night where it fucking belonged. But my arms flailed at the air in a weak spasm. I knew then that it would take time to regain full control of myself. The front part of my brain felt bruised and crushed.  

A blast of cold night air ripped into the car with a load ‘thunk.’ Before I knew what was happening, an arm reached into the car through my now-open door and grabbed the baby by the throat, ripping it from my lap and yanking it out into the howling night.  

The man had returned. I swung my head towards him and saw that he was standing in the rain and wind, holding the little beast at arm’s length.  

‘Let ...them g..go!’ He shouted.  

The baby writhed and gasped, its tiny legs kicking at the air.  

‘Tony... let...go!’ it cried in its little voice, ‘Die!’ The air around them rippled with the invisible force of its commands. 

Beside me, Natia cried out as the thing withdrew completely from our heads, wrenching itself from our minds. It felt like someone had just yanked an ice pick from the base of my skull. My mind felt like an open wound. Natia screamed for both of us.  

Once we were free, the man quickly scooped the thing into his arms. 

‘…nuh no!’ My mouth felt like someone else’s.  My head lolled towards him.  

‘Kuh… k..kill tha’ fffeck..’ 

The thing screamed in its baby voice and thrashed weakly in the man’s arms. He spoke loudly to it.  

‘I’ll t...take you back to her… just…’ He wrestled with the thing. Its frail body was no match for his strength.  

‘Just leave them alone.’  

Natia fumbled with her car door, throwing it wide open and stumbling out into the night. The wind rushed through the two open car doors, finally gaining entry.  

The man shook the thing by the throat.  

‘Leave them ALONE!!’  

‘You k…kill that fucking thing RIGHT NOW!’ Natia screamed.  

She stumbled around the bonnet towards the man and the defenceless baby/thing that had just defiled us.  

The man took a step back.  

‘Just ...stay c..clear.’ He shouted.  

‘I’m sorry.’ His voice broke, ‘So sorry!’ 

Natia gripped the edge of the bonnet for support, panting and gathering herself together.  

I clenched and unclenched my fists. 

‘L…let thum.. g…go!!’ I shrieked.  

I could still feel the strength of the thing’s influence radiating from it, saturating my wounded, gaping mind. It was like being drowned in sour milk. I needed it far away from me, to be out of its cruel radius.  

Natia looked at me. Her face blanched at the sight of me. One side of my face had slackened, my left eye sagged. I could barely see out of it. She started to cry.  

As the man was turning to head back towards his car, parked somewhere ahead in the dark, I caught a glimpse of something pale scurrying up his chest to peer over his shoulder.  Over the roar of the rain and wind I heard its harsh little voice.  

 

‘Natia!’ 

She froze, mid sob and stared at it.  

‘Eat her.’  

 

The air shook with the command, and the rain that fell between them vibrated itself to mist.  

The man stumbled, shouted something and smothered its mouth with his hand, bolting into the night.  

Natia stood perfectly still, staring at the spot where the man and baby had been, water vapour swirling around her. I willed my legs to move. I needed to be running. NOW.
