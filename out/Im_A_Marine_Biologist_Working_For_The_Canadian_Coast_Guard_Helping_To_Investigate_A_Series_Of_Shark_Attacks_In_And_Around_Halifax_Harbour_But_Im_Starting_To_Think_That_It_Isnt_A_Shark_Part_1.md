I was vacationing with my family out in Vancouver when I got the call a week ago. I had been sitting on our hotel room's balcony, overlooking the city, when I suddenly felt my phone buzz.

"Jamieson here," I said upon answering the call.

"Jamie, it's Dylan," My boss replied with a way too chipper tone, "How's the weather out there?"

I sighed, catching on immediately that this might not be just a call to check in, and inquired, "Something tells me that you want to know how soon I can get back to work, right?"

"I wish it was that simple Jamie," Dylan let out an exasperated sigh, "You recall how we were discussing the great whites starting to show up in the harbour right?"

"Yeah, what about it?"

"We've just recently had a few attacks," his voice rang out through the phone speaker, "Ten deaths have been confirmed, three of them last night alone. I was initially gonna wait until tomorrow when you and your wife got home, but with how serious things are getting I need all hands on deck."

"...Alright, she won't be too happy with me leaving her and her parents a day early, but she's been pretty understanding," I sighed, wondering how I was going to bring it up to them, "I'll be on the next flight to Halifax as soon as possible."

Not long after the call ended, I brought up the news to my wife and in-laws, and with the knowledge that she'd be home the next day, was on a flight to Halifax and arrived home a few hours later.

The very next day as I was driving to work, I curiously noted that there was a weather advisory about weather conditions hinting at a possible hurricane in the near future. This caught my attention since Halifax hadn't had a hurricane since Juan (a Category 2 Hurricane) hit the Atlantic Coast in 2003. Nevertheless I made sure to take caution, having occasionally worked in international waters and understanding that this weather advisory could make the upcoming investigation difficult. If there's one thing I've learned with my career and my family history of serving in the Navy, the ocean is a mysterious and dangerous place that you should never underestimate, for a single mistake out there can cause casualties.

I wasn't all too surprised to see the familiar fire, police & ambulance lights as I parked in the Rainbow Beach parking lot and headed towards the beach. Not too long after I could see Dylan talking to the paramedics, his trademark fishing hat and handlebar mustache making him stand out among the sea of Coast Guard officers, all in uniform and chattering quietly while awaiting instructions.

"There's our Marine Biologist folks!" I could hear my Boss call out and saw him wave me over as I approached, "Alrighty, now that's everyone's all here, let's begin."

After we were debriefed on the situation, everyone went their separate ways with a few officers helping the lifeguards change the flags to red ones to indicate to the public that the beach was closed. A few more along with police officers were putting up caution tape, fully blocking off the beach.

Meanwhile I had followed Dylan along with a police officer and a paramedic to a particular spot as he turned to me to say, "We just found another body, a college student in his early twenties. He'd actually been missing for a week now, and his corpse washed up to shore an hour ago."

Not long after he said this, we had reached our destination and I could see the corpse in question, or rather what was left of it, lying alongside what used to be a yacht. I nearly gagged, the putrid smell of something that's been deceased for a week invading my nostrils. Pushing through the stench, I knelt down to start my part of the investigation. I could tell that there were signs of animals eating away at the corpse over the course of the week the young man had gone missing, but there were two things that stood out and I feel will haunt my nightmares for a few weeks. The first being his eyes, glazed over but holding a look of terror in them. The second was what was most likely the fatal injury itself, a rather large bite mark in the young man's torso, large enough to the point that his left leg was barely attached ro his body. I frowned, noticing immediately that something about the bite mark didn't seem right.

"Something wrong, Jamie?" Dylan asked, his eyebrows furrowed in concern.

"You see the size of this right?" I inquired back, pointing at the wound, "The bite radius seems a little too big to be your average Great White, or any shark in general."

"It does look pretty big, true," the older gentleman noted upon closer inspection, "To be fair, there have been a few occasions where a Great White can be measured up to 19ft in length, so we can't entirely rule one out. Plus Orcas can get up to a similar length too, if you're thinking this isn't a shark."

"I don't know sir, Great White attacks usually only happen ten times a year, so finding 11 bodies over the course of a week is a bit strange," I replied as I pulled out my measuring tape to properly measure the wound, being silent for a moment before I continued, "Not to mention as you recall I've been in this field for 17 years sir. Judging by the radius, whatever man eater we've got...what was the nickname you gave for whatever this is again?"

"Bruce. I thought it was fitting."

"I'm not surprised," I sighed, "Well, whatever Bruce is, my guess is they're at least 20ft in length, possibly bigger than that."

"Alrighty then Jamie," Dylan declared, patting me on the shoulder, "Make sure you note down your findings, and then get ready to board one of the boats. Stay safe out there."

I gave a nod as the old man walked away, but as I prepared to pull out my notebook something shiny caught my eye. Looking back at the body, I saw something clenched tightly in the victim's hand. At first I thought it might've been a knife or a piece of the wrecked yacht. Barely managing to pry it from his fingers without damaging his body, i realized that this wasn't a piece of metal at all. What I now held and took a moment to examine appeared to be a large aquamarine scale, roughly the size of a license plate. Upon recognizing what it was, I pulled out my notebook on identifying marine life and flipped through it to try to match it with anything in the book. The closest I could get however was being able to note that it looked similar in shape to that of a coral snake. As I placed the scale in one of the evidence bags we had, I felt a sense of concern and knew I had to reach out online to any marine biologists. And I picked here because something was definitely off with that scale. I know for a fact that coral snakes aren't that colour, and they certainly aren't anywhere the size of whatever killed these people.

"Ow, fuck!" I yelped suddenly, nearly dropping the now bloodied scale that in my foolishness wasn't paying attention to while putting it in the evidence bag and had just cut my hand on. Dropping it fully into the bag and thinking quickly, I made sure to stop the bleeding from the fresh wound before cleaning it as best as I could and bandaging it tightly. "I gotta get someone to check that to make sure it doesn't get infected," I muttered to myself as I stood up with my stuff collected. Well, as carefully as someone with a bandaged hand can.

It was just then that the sky opened up and it began to rain. I saw the paramedics heading over with a body bag and figured that I should head out, when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. I wasn't sure if it was just my imagination or not, but I could swear I saw a glimpse of something out in the harbour. Curious, I grabbed out my binoculars and looked out towards the ocean, and what I saw filled me with a sense of dread.

At first it looked like a large sail boat cutting through the harbour, but something seemed a little off. It took me a moment to realize that the "boat" was heading out more towards the open ocean, whereas the wind was currently flowing away from the shore and pelting me in the face. Not to mention it was moving in ways that should be impossible for a boat. And it suddenly dawned on me that it wasn't a sail boat at all, but in fact a rather large series of spines making a sail-like fin. It was a pale blue-white, almost translucent. And the part that terrified me the most was its size, this fin looked like a rather large moving island in the distance, way too big to be a shark or whale. And then it was gone, as swiftly as I saw it the fin descended back into the sea water.

There was another thing I noticed too, somehow stranger than seeing the fin. I didn't hear them at first since it was subtle, but I've started to hear a voice in my head. It's androgynous and in a language I don't recognize yet I somehow understand. It's weirdly soothing, calling out to me even longer after I've left the beach, trying to coax me towards the water. I don't know what that's all about, but i didn't hear it until after I cut my hand on the scale. I think I may need to look into this more.

Whatever the case, I figured that if there's anywhere I can seek answers for what I saw, it's here. If what I saw is the man eater my boss is calling Bruce, then I don't think it's a Great White that we're dealing with. And the thought of that scares me.
