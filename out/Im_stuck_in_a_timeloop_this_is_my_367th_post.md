Hello readers, God that was formal, I'm posting on this subreddit as I'm sure you will understand my situation. It started 367 days ago, just over a year now, I woke up on the 6th of April 2023 like any other day, I made breakfast for my kids, kissed my wife and left the house for work. For context, I work a dead-end office job and almost every day is just as bleak as the last. Nothing changed today, it was just as awful as normal, I got to work, drank a black coffee, sat down, spent 32 minutes and 43 seconds reading through emails then got a call from my wife. The conversation is engraved in my mind nowadays, this is how it went. 

" hey hun, did the kids get to school alright"

" ye about that, I need you to get to the school... Like now please"

"Why, did one of them get into any trouble?" 

"no, there's a fire, the kids are in danger, and help is on the way but the traffic for the football match is so bad, I just need you here please"

And that was it, the call that marked the worst day of my life, the torture I now put up with every day. 
Of course, I ran out of the office with screams from my manager close behind, I get on my bike and swerve through the streets, I almost got hit a few times as well. 
When I get to the school there was not much I can do, the place is an inferno, and my wife comes up to me in tears but I dont speak to her, just stand in shock. 


You might say my next action was foolish but if you have two kids you love so dearly you would understand. 
I ran into the building with my hoodie over my face, I got loads of burns as I ran through but it was worth it, I see my kid's classroom with lockers fallen over the door and began lifting them out of the way but I was weak and my breath was short.
A cry comes out from my kids as they see me trying to get to them, they look so scared, but not of the fire, there was a kid in there with a table leg engulfed in flames. 
He was standing next to a kid with a pencil stuck through his eye, I knew he must have started it, that brat is about to cause the death of me and my family. 

I get in the classroom, I could have gone to my kids but I ran at the little brat, I hurled him into the blackboard coating it in blood. I make sure he's dead. Just as I do that the roof caves in and I die before waking up the next morning to the same day.


Well, that's the day, the worst of my life that I suffer every day now, it used to hurt but I'm numb to it now. Before anyone comments, of course, I have tried to change things and do it differently but it always has the same outcome or a worse one.

I suppose it would be smart to try telling you the rules of this world that I seem to live in. 

As far as I know, I can make minor changes to my day, like writing this post but anything substantial and I suffer a fate worse than the original day, some other torture. 
I dont know what started it or a way to end it 


I tried to off myself and the day just restarted. 

I tried telling my family and the day I did try telling people what was happening I spent the rest of it in a mental hospital before a breakout happened and I was killed in it. 

If I dont go to school burning debris falls on me. 


I try to keep the day as close to the original each day, any hope of changing things has gone for me. 

Honestly one day I might just leave all together.
