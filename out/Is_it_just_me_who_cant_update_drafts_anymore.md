So I am trying to create a story for the **nosleep** subreddit, and it is not updating drafts. But the weirdest part is that is was updating drafts earlier this week for me, and only started yesterday. So I thought of everything I did on reddit since yesterday and thought maybe it was becuase the site crashed after I tried to save a draft, but I'm not sure.

UPDATE 1: after I first posted I got a message from someone saying that they know the cause of the problem, so I met them at the caf√® that they said to meet them at. And they told this ridiculous story on how it's appearently a demon that chose a handful of people and said that the marked ones can no longer update drafts on social media, to no longer posting anything on any social media, to them then disappearing. And they said they know this becuase they survived this monster. I just thought I'd put this there just to show that I still don't know and need help, and that I don't want to hear any more jokes like this.

UPDATE 2: Idk why but ever since that one person said something about a demon, and me not being able to post, I haven't been able to say anything one things like discord, twitter, snapchat, insta, and others. And have only been able to post on reddit, and comment, and update posts, but I've also been feeling this strange aura around me since that day, like someone or something has been watching me. But this update is mainly to say I still haven't found help, and that maybe I might need help with a ghost problem after all, mainly for that presence.

UPDATE 3: I need say everything that has been going on now, I've been hearing voices from the dark at night, and feeling things touching my shoulder when I am alone, so I need help with this instead, since know I am not able to comment or post on reddit, just update past posts. And I don't know if I am actually going to disappear like that person said, I mean it sounds absurd but I think what they said was true. That there is a demon, and people disappearing is just their food- now I hear knocking at my door.

UPDATE 4: this update is only a few hours after my last, but I have to hurry, I am being hunted, and I am contacting the only survivor of this thing I know, whatever this thing is, it is mimicing voices of people I know, and takes form of shadows, so now I am asking for new help. Please I don't know if the other person can help me, I need help somehow if they can't so please if anyone can before it gets me, let me know if what this thing is before its too late. I can hear it getting closer, I gotta finish this update, it might be my last one so, please wish me luck too.
