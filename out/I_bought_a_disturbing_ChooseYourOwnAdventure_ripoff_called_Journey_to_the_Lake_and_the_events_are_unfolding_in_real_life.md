**Part I** - [Part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/14a5kgi/i_bought_a_disturbing_chooseyourownadventure/)

Since my wife died last year, I’ve been travelling across the UK in a decked-out van with my son, Sam. We’ve been heading up to Inverness, his mother’s favourite place, in the hope of scattering her ashes. It’s no surprise, then, that I’m a lover of adventures, is it?

***Journey to the Lake***  
*Choose Your End*

I picked it up from a charity store yesterday. A hardback novel with a tattered paper cover. Whilst some knock-offs are a little cringe-worthy, I was intrigued by this one. Minuscule white writing on an all-black cover. The stark, sinister minimalism of the art really gripped me.

Plus, I have fond memories of the “Choose Your Own Adventure” books from Sam’s childhood. But “Journey to the Lake” seemed a little more mature than the stories I remembered.

*Choose Your End*

The title alone seemed bleak, but I didn’t know the half of it.

“You reach a crossroads… Uh oh,” Sam said, chuckling as he read the book aloud.

“What?” I asked, smiling.

“Time to make our first decision,” He replied.

“Leave this to me,” I said, cracking my neck decisively.

Sam groaned. “Dad, no. You always made the worst decisions with these books back in the day.”

“I know,” I said. “Mum was always the smart one. I was the beauty, and she was the brains.”

Sam shook his head, before clearing his throat and leaning into the light above the van’s front dashboard. He read with the giddiness of a child. Of course, even at the age of 19, he’s still a child to me.

“Pick the safest path to the lake,” Sam read. “Take the road to Yellow Town. Page 11. Or take the road to Brickrock. Page 43.”

“Yellow Town!” I exuberantly requested.

Sam, being a people-pleasing saint, rolled his eyes and obliged. He flicked through the pages of the dusty, unbranded book and settled on Page 11.

To summarise, the road took our character to Yellow Town, a seemingly-serene place with a sinister history. It was haunted by the Seafarer, a stranger who was hanged for slaughtering seven townsfolk. And his ghost, donning a black raincoat, stalked the protagonist.

“Oh, so it’s *that* kind of story,” I said, smiling.

“I thought we would be going on a fantastical adventure with dragons and fairies,” Sam gulped.

“Maybe the Seafarer has a magical boat?” I suggested, smirking.

“Okay… I’m gonna stop there. I’m tired,” Sam said.

“Or scared?” I teased. “Well, if you want to stop reading so early, I might as well carry on driving to Carlisle. You okay with that? We could treat ourselves to a hotel, rather than kipping in the van.”

Sam shrugged. “Sure. Just wake me in a couple of hours.”

But I woke him far earlier than that. You see, we never made it to Carlisle.

“Welcome to Joune...?” I whispered, squinting to read the road sign for a town I hadn’t seen on the GPS.

The sign might’ve said something else, but it was dark, and one of the letters had faded.

I was more concerned with the neat rows of structures that rushed towards us on either side of the road. Quaint cottages, shops, and other quintessential British buildings — but they were all various shades of yellow. Like the town in the book. A strange coincidence.

But then, in one of the house’s upper windows, I briefly saw something which glued the flesh of my hands to the steering wheel.

A man in a black raincoat. Watching.

***Journey to the Lake*** was on my brain, so it had to be confirmation bias. That was what I told myself.

Sam laughed when I woke him and explained the situation. He said the tables had turned — suddenly, I was the scaredy-pants. I thought he might be right.

“Room for two?” Asked the hotel receptionist at a little B&B in the middle of the town.

“Yes, please,” I said. “Two singles, mind.”

Sam rolled his eyes — his favourite response to my humorous quips. The receptionist merely nodded and handed over a key.

“Room 11. The end,” She said.

“Beg your pardon?” I asked in a hoarse whisper, suddenly perturbed by the receptionist’s uneven tone of voice.

“The end of the corridor,” She clarified, offering a false smile. “You can’t miss it.”

Sam and I practically sleep-walked to our room in the early hours of the morning, but I was overcome by a strange sense of alertness when I plopped onto my bed. I wish I hadn’t remedied that with the following idea.

“I’m gonna read a little more,” I said, pulling the book out of my backpack.

Sam groaned. “Why did you bring that in here?”

I found myself unable to crack one of my usual jokes. “I just have to know what happens next.”

*Weary from your travels, you graciously accept the keys from the innkeeper.*  
*“Room 11. The end,” She says.*

How? How could the book have known? Heart gripped by the terrifying and inexplicable sensation of suddenly being watched, I stopped reading.

“Ha, ha,” Sam sarcastically grumbled. “I’m going to sleep.”

“Read it for yourself,” I shuddered, hurling the book at him.

My son sat up and read the page for himself. “Is this one of your jokes? First, the yellow buildings. Now, a scripted conversation?”

“You were there in the shop with me. I found the book. I didn’t write it,” I said. “I think we need to go.”

A booming sound echoed along the hotel corridor, and goosebumps bubbled across my icy flesh. I’d never been so frightened in my life, but I summoned the bravery to stumble over to the door.

“You hear a thunderous creak in the hallway,” Sam read. “Gazing through the peephole, you see…”

I didn’t need my son to finish the sentence — yet again, the book had predetermined my actions. And through the peephole of the hotel door, I saw something horrifying.

The man in the black raincoat stood in the hallway, one eye peering into the peephole from the other side — as if he could see me. He was warped by the curvature of the glass into a horrifically large, malformed man. Or maybe those were his true dimensions. And there was no accounting for his lifeless, sagging skin. That was surely no trickery of the glass.

I screamed, stumbling backwards from the door.

“Head into the hallway. Page 59. Exit through the window. Page 115. Dad, what is this?” Sam quivered, seemingly understanding, at long last, that I was not playing a cruel joke.

“Page 115, right?” I asked, turning and running over to the window.

Sam nodded, leaping to his feet and frantically flipping through the pages as I pulled the curtains open. Fortunately, we were on the ground floor, and the window opened wide enough for us to slip out.

Sam went first, taking our bags with him, but I struggled to squeeze my slightly larger form through the window.

“Dad!” Sam screeched.

And in the reflection of the glass pane, I saw him. Standing behind me.

The Seafarer.

The door hadn’t opened. I don’t know how he entered the room. I don’t know how any of it happened.

One of his cold hands clamped onto my shoulder, squeezing tightly enough to drain the very life out of my being — his touch filled me with a haunting hollowness that I cannot put into words. An eternal hell that must’ve only lasted a moment in reality.

Terrified, I wrenched my body free of the inhuman man’s grasp, and I slithered out of the window after my son.

We sprinted to the van and made a hasty getaway, grateful to have chosen the right path this time. Or so we thought. As I drove the way we came, something unexplainable happened.

We found ourselves back in Yellow Town.

No matter which way we drove, the road always led back to Yellow Town. And that’s when the horrifying gravity of events soon dawned on both of us. We were trapped.

We *are* trapped.

Only the book can determine our fate. We’re too frightened to go back to an earlier point in the book and change things, given that we don’t know how this unholy scripture works — all we know is that this isn’t a story. Every consequence is real.

Our next choice is as follows:

*You take the off-road route through the forest. But which road will bring you to the lake in time?*

*Route 15 — Page 152*  
*Route 11 — Page 191*

I have no idea which route to take, but I trust Sam’s judgement more than my own. I hope to update all of you soon.

If you never see a post from me again, then I guess we’ve chosen the wrong path.
