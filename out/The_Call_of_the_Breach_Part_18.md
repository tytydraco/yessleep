[\[Part 17\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1hmzs84/the_call_of_the_breach_part_17/)

*Boom.*

Dust rained from the ceiling onto the map table before us, and Chris swiped it away from the topographical lines with a weary hand. “So, we’re all in agreement?”

Around the conference room table, everyone else nodded, their faces drawn. The rest of the day had been nothing short of awful; Sandra and her researchers had worked overtime to keep Sean stabilized, his wounds somehow worse upon their expert inspection. The bullet that had entered above his hip splintered upon impact, and Sean lost a lot of blood in the three surgeries it took to remove it. His ribs were cracked in two places, and he had a concussion from being too close to his own grenades. Shrapnel peppered his torso, and it took hours to stitch him up. Eve and her healers threw everything they had into the fight, and between them, the Head Researcher and matriarch of Ark River had come as close to a miracle as anyone could. Our leader now slept under the influence of generous sedation in one of the hospital cots, but while his life had been saved, Sean’s position as commander had to be filled in the interim. Ethan refused the position, wishing to remain with his Workers, and Sandra couldn’t leave her patients, which meant the role fell one again to a Ranger.

Chris sighed, though I couldn’t quite tell if it was relief or dread from how his shoulders slumped. “Okay. As acting commander, I think our first priority should be to evacuate as many wounded from the city as possible, and work to offset our losses. What’s the status on the front?”

“Organ soldiers are massing all along the line.” Josh stared blankly at the map, his face ashen, though I could tell from the redness of his eyes that he’d been one of many people to shed angry tears. “They’ve been pounding our positions with artillery for the past hour now. I think we’re in for an all-out assault before sundown.”

News of Andrea’s death, along with Kaba’s, had spread through the ranks like wildfire, and the resistance were noticeably demoralized at losing yet another of their influential leaders. Our gate guards had already begun to report numerous attempted desertions from resistance cells, finding abandoned positions where the fighters simply picked up their guns and headed for the refugee camps to wait out the war. What survivors remained from the underground Castle had been evacuated through the long, grimy sewer tunnels beneath the city, but this only created further human logjam in the already crowded southern districts of Black Oak. Civilians from all over were trying to flee the fighting, but with the mutants outside the gates, and the snows becoming more and more frequent, there was nowhere for the masses to run. Food had run low, one of our researchers had discovered contamination in the local water supply which required a boil order, and there weren’t enough intact houses or tents for everyone. Frostbite cases were coming in, and a few old people had frozen to death in the brisk night air. It was a nightmare of human suffering that could only get worse, and Chris had inherited it all as his first day being commander.

Looking down at my arm, I picked at the yellow sash tied there to demarcate my own resulting promotion, since it would be a while before I had time to visit a seamstress. I wouldn’t have minded going from lieutenant to captain if it hadn’t come with the additional, temporary step-up in responsibility; assuming Chris’s old job.

*Will there ever be a time someone becomes Head Ranger without someone else being killed?*

“Yet my scouts report more withdrawal activity in the north.” In response to Josh’s musings, Adam frowned at the map, hand on his sword hilt, one thumb rubbing the pommel in idle contemplation. “At first we thought it might be supply units leaving to restock, but there are multiple ELSAR units pulling back to the northern border. Some of our observation posts even reported skirmishes between ELSAR proper and their Auxiliary hounds. Perhaps the attack on the negotiations wasn’t sanctioned by Koranti?”

“I think so too.” I couldn’t help but nod at Adam, his words almost perfectly in line with my thoughts.

Others turned to look at me, but I turned to Chris, as he was commander now, and I knew he’d understand. “Crow purposefully left Sheriff Wurnauw exposed so he had nowhere to run but their observation post, and then she had her gunners hit it with a heavy crossfire. Even if she couldn’t predict Sean chasing Wurnauw down, Crow knew the firefight between both sides would likely kill anyone inside that shop, which means this was premeditated. She meant to take out our leadership with the rocket attack, then remove her provisional government competition by killing the sheriff. I’d wager there are probably some others we don’t know about who were killed behind the scenes, local politicians, councilmen, maybe even the mayor. She’s trying to take over Barron County, and since Koranti doesn’t share power, I’d say she’s fighting him too.”

“Which means untold suffering for the innocents caught in the middle.” Eve folded her arms and shook her honey-colored head at the map in sadness. “After all, by your own account, these ‘Organs’ don’t hesitate at cruelty of the most extreme kinds. Our healers are reporting numerous young women who’ve tried to kill themselves in our care, because of the abuse they suffered at the Auxiliaries’ hands. We have to protect the people from further violence.”

Sandra perked up a little, the two sharing a mutual look of support due to their combined roles as medical personnel. “Some of our patients from the civilian sector are reporting that Organ troops are using detention facilities where they hold political dissidents as staging areas, since they know we won’t attack them. We have the chance to demonstrate to the people of Black Oak that we are the morally superior choice of government, if we can adequately shield them from the conflict. I think we should consider not only evacuating wounded, but also non-combatants to strategic refugee camps in the countryside.”

“That’ll mean drawing more fighters away from the front line.” Josh set his jaw with a hardened gaze, a cold gravity to his words that sapped further hope from the room. “And besides, we’re already seeing refugees coming *back* through our southern gate from the outside. There’s too many freaks beyond the wall, so unless you’ve got enough material to fortify these ‘camps’ we’re just sending them out to slaughter.”

In my head, I saw again the farmhouse from the southlands, the gore-spattered interior, the dead family ripped to pieces and stuffed behind piles of debris for ‘storage’. New Wilderness had been built on a hilltop before the Breach opened, and the palisade wall that once ringed it had taken the entire fort a long time to raise. Even if we could equip all the refugees with adequate weapons, tools, rations, and warm clothing, there was no way they’d all be able to find suitable hilltops with fresh water nearby, or get protective walls erected in time. Most would die, either from cold, starvation, disease, or worst of all, the mutants.

*Even if the regular freaks didn’t get them, Vecitorak certainly would. He’d have a field day, ambushing an entire column of helpless civilians. They wouldn’t stand a chance.*

Quiet up until this point, Ethan glanced at Chris, his bearded face shadowed with doubt. “My boys can’t work fast enough to set up both refugee centers and maintain logistics for our campaign. They’re dead tired as it is, they need a break. If it if true that the mercenaries are pulling out, then this might be our best chance to take the city.”

Adam raised a suspicious eyebrow at the rest of us, head cocked to one side to accentuate his point. “It still doesn’t answer the question as to why Koranti just gave up and left. Even if there are a thousand Organs in Black Oak, Koranti’s mercs are better trained than the Auxiliaries. He’s got unlimited logistics outside the county line, he has an army of well-equipped soldiers, and yet he’s retreating? Think about it, the radios are working again, they haven’t tried to intercept our comms since the exchange . . . this doesn’t make any sense.”

“It could be that Koranti wants us to kill each other, and then swoop in once it’s over to clean up the pieces.” Ethan stroked his scruffy face with one oil-stained hand. “He didn’t strike me as stupid. Arrogant, maybe, but not stupid. If the Organs really have mutinied, then he’s better off letting us use up all our ammo on each other, and not on his higher-quality troops.”

Chris ran a set of fingers through his disheveled brown hair, and stared at the map in front of him, littered with little tokens depicting unit placement. “It could be that he didn’t expect to lose the Auxiliaries so quickly and is pulling out his heavy weapons to avoid Crow taking them for herself. I figure he doesn’t want a three-way civil war on his hands, which means he’d rather lose all his local muscle than see them take up arms against him. Either way, we can’t pass this up, not when half of the enemy is leaving down, and taking all their big guns with them.”

I leaned forward on the table to point out a few places near the frontline. “A runner from Sergeant McPherson said he noticed less artillery fire than usual from the north. There’s lots of infantry moving in, but it seems their support is faltering. Josh is right, the Organs are getting ready for something big, but without Koranti’s regulars they might be vulnerable.”

Chris took some of the tokens in hand, and moved the pieces around on the map as he talked. “The enemy is massing most of its units in the center, some 800 by the look of it. I think they expect us to bunch up to meet them by the same number, and since they’ve got more men in the city than us, they want to grind us down. If we can pull most of our forces from the center to the flanks, we can encircle and destroy them unit by unit instead of facing them on equal terms. That way, we can make the most of our numbers while they are forced to defend every inch of the front.”

“If they push on the center while we’re attacking the flanks, the enemy could break through.” Ethan made an uncertain half-frown and wiped his hands on his overhauls to be sure they were free of grime before pointing out what he meant on the paper.

“So we move faster than they do.” Chris took Ethan’s comments in stride, his tone guiding and instructive, reminding me of just how well suited he was for such a role. “We hit them hard, use every shell, every mortar, every heavy weapon system we’ve got. Even the exterior scouts can harass their convoys in the north of the city walls. I want them to think we’re everywhere, all at once.”

At the mention of his infamous scouts, Adam straightened up with an air of pride. “I’ll lead the patrols to our west. Anything they do, we’ll see and report. *Amica mea,* can you take the east?”

Eve’s golden irises flashed with a similar glint as her husband’s and she made a demur nod his way, cheeks aglow. “We’ll ride circles around them, *amor vitae meae*.”

Satisfied with their enthusiasm, Chris turned to Sandra. “In the meantime, you and Ethan can work on that casualty evacuation out of the center. At the very least, get our wounded to the southern district, in case the center doesn’t hold. Be ready for more though, I doubt the Organs are going to go quietly.”

“Understood.” Sandra made a subconscious tug at her ragged sleeves, as if to roll them up before yet another surgery.

At last, Chris’s gaze fell on me, and I sensed a mix of pride and grim reluctance at what he was asking me to do. “I’ll take the eastern flank. As acting Head Ranger, you’ll need to be at the front of the offensive to help gauge our success. Since your platoon is already there, can you lead the pincer for the west?”

My skin tingling at the surreal sound of being addressed in my new rank, I nodded. “Can do.”

“Then you’ll have some of the ASV’s and our armored trucks, as well as a battery of mortars.” Chris moved the pieces accordingly, and the little tokens swept across the paper battlefield in two wide arcs. “Your objective will be the same as before; the prison camp in the north. I’ll push hard for the airfield. Once we reach our objectives, we can either radio, assuming ELSAR leaves the comms alone long enough for that to work, or we’ll fire three flares to mark it. As soon as that happens, we begin to collapse the lines inward and squeeze the Organs until they break. Questions?”

No one said a word, and another mortar shell exploded somewhere down the street with a dull *thud.*

Swallowing with a deep sigh of foreboding, Chris stepped back from the table, and reached for his gear, which leaned against the wall behind his knees. “Alright, let’s get to it.”

As the room cleared, Chris caught my arm on the way out and motioned for me to follow him through a small door at the back of the room. Inside, I found a back office with no windows, a desk, and a rather familiar green metal safe in the corner. A kerosene lamp lit it from the desk and cast eerie shadows across the old carpet. It had obviously been Sean’s personal office before he got hit, many of his personal possessions still sitting in various places, his rucksack, a spare pair of boots, and a rifle. As he was currently in the care of our nurses, the place gave off a melancholy aura, a dimly lit shrine to a world that was slowly being chipped away by this awful war.

Once the door clicked shut behind us, Chris strode to the safe and knelt to unlock it. “Sean briefed me on what to do if he were to temporarily be taken out of command. Told me you and I were to keep it under wraps. I take it you already understand the implications of this?”

Out came the canvas sling bag, and upon seeing it, my gut churned. Both ears crawled with the memory of screams, the shrieking of sirens, the arcing of missiles as they swept down to burn countless people to ash. The town of Collingswood had been destroyed by lesser weapons, conventional warheads launched long before I’d arrived in Barron County, but even that had left untold scars upon the wastes. I’d seen it myself, experienced the strange leftovers of the slaughter in its whispers, its shadows, its phantoms that refused to die for the sorrow they’d endured in their final moments. Human suffering always left traces, and the weapon in my hands now could do far more than even ELSAR could imagine.

“I do.” Taking it in hand, I tried not to look at the device, shuddering despite myself at how something so deadly could be so light.

Chris locked the now empty safe and stood to throw the sling bag an unpleasant look. “It can’t stay here, not in case the center gets overrun. You have to carry it with you, which means you have to learn to sit back and let others pull the triggers. No more running headfirst into carnage like today, understand?”

With a heavy sigh, I bit my lip and forced myself to comply. “Yeah.”

“With any luck, this will all be over in a few days, and we won’t need it.” Chris snorted at his own words, as if he didn’t truly believe them, and pulled a computer chair out from the desk to offer it to me. “How’s Lucille?”

I sat in the well-worn swivel chair, while he slumped down onto Sean’s unoccupied cot across from me, the two of us glad for any chance at a reprieve. “She won’t leave Andrea’s body. Won’t speak, won’t eat or drink, just sits there and stares at her dead sister. I can’t take her back to the front like that, Chris, but I don’t want to leave her here by herself. She’s got no one left.”

“Maybe we should send her back with the body to Ark River.” He leaned forward with his forearms on his knees. “You know how gentle those people are, perhaps some time in the church, away from all the shelling, will bring her back to her senses. Like you said, she can’t stay here.”

Lucille’s wail of mourning resurfaced in my head, and I squeezed my eyes shut for a moment to block it out. Guilt cut through my heart in a cold, cruel knife, and I thought back to how she worked hard to help me, set up my tent, ran errands, carried messages. I’d relied on her, but when the time came for me to be there for her, I’d let Lucille down. Her sister had trusted me, they’d all trusted me, and in my moment of responsibility I had failed both Campbell girls.

*If she hates me for the rest of her life, it wouldn’t be undeserved.*

Setting the sling pack on the floor by my feet, I rubbed at my face with both hands, and the fingers came away far grimier than I expected. “If I try to send her back, I don’t know what she’ll do. Lucille wanted to be on the front so bad, and if I pull her off it . . .”

“You’re her commanding officer, Hannah.” Chris’s mouth formed a hard, sad line. “Our job isn’t an easy one. I know you care about her, I get that, but sometimes you have to be a leader first and a friend second. Sending her to the rear might be the thing she needs to recover, and whether she likes it or not, an order from you isn’t something she can dispute.”

I picked at the seam of my trousers in a bid to distract myself. He was right, I knew that, but it still felt like a further betrayal of Lucille that I wasn’t sure I could bring myself to commit. “Do you think Sean will be okay?”

He looked down at his scuffed brown boots, and I saw doubt flit through Chris’s expression. “Physically, I think so. But I don’t know if he’ll ever be the same man again. He was always the calm, diplomatic, calculated one. When he ran off like that, straight into machine gun fire . . . I thought he’d gone insane.”

Wincing at how closely his thoughts matched my own, I looked down at the sling bag, the launch panel hidden under its coat of olive-drab canvas. “It seems like we keep losing people faster than we can capture living space. Jamie, Andrea, Sean, it never ends. Chris, what if we can’t win? What if Koranti has some greater plan, what if we lose Black Oak, and—”

“That’s not going to happen.” Chris reached across the space between us to catch my hand and gripped it hard. “This is going to work, alright? We’re going to finish this together, like we always do.”

I wanted to believe that, but part of me still spiraled with uncertainty. After all, I had always thought when the day of victory came, Jamie would be by my side, the two of us marching to the county border arm-in-arm together. Now she was banished, and I was leading our old faction, a role I felt I didn’t really merit. Could our belief be misguided? Could this war be unwinnable? Were we every bit as foolish as Koranti said?

*Come on Hannah, get it together. Chris needs you, and so does the coalition. If Jamie were here, she’d tell you to toughen up, and she would be right.*

On that mental note, I gave Chris’s calloused hand a return squeeze and shifted in the chair to shove the canvas bag into my knapsack. While my knapsack was rather deflated, given that I’d left most non-essential things back at Ark River, I had a hard time stuffing the square metal panel inside, and at last, in frustration, I dumped the whole thing out onto the office floor.

For his part, rose to Chris top his canteen off from a water dispenser against one wall, the two of us enjoying a peaceful, almost domestic moment. It was warm inside the tiny office, and I slid to sit cross-legged on the floor alongside my pile of things, accepting a small paper cup of water from Chris as I went.

At one point, I inverted my knapsack for a final shake, and from the bottom, a folded bit of plastic tarp I’d forgotten about since before the offensive tumbled out. I mainly kept it in case I had to improvise a crude shelter, or for covering ammo, a casualty, or creating a screen to hide behind while washing myself in the field. Thus far, I’d been either far too busy to need it, or had improvised without, but something brown stuck out from between the green plastic folds and caught my eye.

Curious, I picked it up and recognized the paper-wrapped gift from Professor Carheim. He’d sent it to me via the old resistance leader, Tex, the night I escaped from Black Oak. Due to the chaotic events that followed, notably Tex’s assassination at the hands of Crow, I’d completely forgotten about the parcel. Now that Professor Carheim lay dead, I peeled at the coffee-colored paper with a heavy heart, wishing I could thank him for whatever was underneath.

As the wrappings fell away, my mind spun in confused, bewildered sparks of fascination.

*What on earth . . .*

I’d thought it was a book, judging by its shape and weight, but instead I found a translucent plastic case, the kind a camper might use to keep things from getting wet. A notecard had been taped to the inside of the lid facing outward, and I held it up to the light of the nearby kerosene lamp.

*Hannah,*

*So much has happened in this past year that I do not, and perhaps never will, understand. Our old world has been turned upside down, and it seems our future is as dark as it is uncertain. All that being said, your survival thus far has been one of the few rays of light to pierce this shadowy veil that has been flung on us, and I hope it continues for many years to come. Never forget what we spoke of, amongst the books and writings of a bygone era in human history. You are a champion of Order, of a better future, one I believe in with all my heart. A future of light, peace, and freedom. May these records help you find the way forward, and preserve the work we, the last stewards of a dying civilization, have done in order to keep Barron County a place ruled by men, and not monsters. If there is a God, I hope beyond all measure that he has seen what I have seen of you, and takes it into account whenever you find the end to this long dark road we have all been forced to travel on.*

*Best of luck,*

*Professor Henry J. Carheim*

Tears welled in my eyes, but I blinked them back and popped the latch on the side of the case to empty its content into my lap. Inside, a tightly bound stack of folded papers was held together by scotch tape, and a little black notebook fell out as well.

My already wounded heart sank when I recognized the name in the front flap.

*Property of A.V. Kabanagarajan.*

“What’s all this?” Chris knelt beside me on the carpet and picked up the tape-wrapped stack of papers to examine them.

“Not sure.” I flipped through the notebook, brow furrowed, only to find row after row of names. Some had ranks, as if they were military or ELSAR fighters; others were simple civilian names, but they all had dates beside them. It struck me that these must be deaths, for all the dates were recent, within the past several months, and thus couldn’t be births or anything else. They were too numerous to be the ones Kaba had saved from ELSAR, and on the final page Kaba had inked a parting message on in his neat, studious penmanship.

*Lest they be forgotten.*

“Hannah,” Chris had cut the tape while I paged through the notebook, and held the unfolded papers in his palms, a growing look of alarm on his handsome face. “Look at this.”

They were printouts, page after page from various online forums, some obscure, a few recognizable. All were as recent as the names in the notebook, though there weren’t nearly as many. As I read, my pulse quickened, and I had to remind myself to breathe.

Stories.

Stories about us, about Barron County, about the Breach, all of it.

One was written by Ethan on his first day at New Wilderness. I unearthed another that Chris had created just after his crash landing, and he recalled how he’d used his phone to send it before the device died out. For his part, Chris discovered a post made by Andrea, and reading her words made my chest tighten in grief that hadn’t had much time to scar over. Professor Carheim had one of his own, though it was more philosophical, speculative, and short. However, as I got down to the bottom of the pile, where it seemed the earliest entries were, I came across one post made by none other than Deputy Sean Hammond.

*Just like the posts Matt and Carla first saw before we came here. They were trying to warn us, and we had no idea. Koranti must have had them removed to keep news from spreading.*

My fingers trembled as I traced the lettering and found a mention of an unnamed ‘auburn-haired girl’ who was brought in raving about monsters in the dark. “Oh my God.”

“What?” Chris looked up from a story that seemed to have been written by Adam Stirling, but I was already pawing through the stack to the final, and ultimately, earliest account, which dated back to February.

I held it to the flickering yellow glow of the old-fashioned lamp and read as fast as my augmented senses would let me, paper flying in my hands. I even skimmed over a few of the slower parts, but still, my heart could barely keep up with the whirl of questions going on in my brain. Deep inside, I relived it all, I glimpsed the girl in the storm, the road, the boy in the gray jacket calling to me as he ran. I saw my memories and I saw hers, all blended together in the howl of wind, rain, and thunder.

Like a lightning bolt, a revelation hit me out of nowhere as I turned the final page, and I looked up into Chris’s worried gaze with slack-jawed horror.

“Madison Cromwell.” I stammered, blood like ice in my veins. Her tormented face rose before my mind’s eye, both from the fever dreams of my infection, and from the memorial photo in the check in building. “She’s the one that went missing in February, at the start of all this. She killed the Oak Walker.”

“She’s also the only one of these accounts that actually went into the Breach itself.” He scanned the pages as fast as a normal human possibly could, and all at once Chris’s sky-blue eyes rose to meet mine as his brain locked onto the same conclusion. “Twice, by the look of it. If Vecitorak said he had someone who could resurrect the Oak Walker’s spirit, then it would have to be someone caught in the Breach with him, which means . . .”

I held my right arm up so the kerosene’s flame could illuminate the silver in my tattoos and let the pieces of truth fit together in my head with terrible perfection. “She’s alive, Chris. Madison Cromwell is still alive.”
