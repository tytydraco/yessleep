There had been a break-in. No forcible entry but when I came home last night my new Smart TV was gone. And there was a creepy envelope stuck to the wall in its place.

It read in laundry marker, "1978 isn't over".

I felt someone step on my grave and then I remembered.

It was a beautiful Saturday morning in April 1978. The birds were singing, the sky was blue like it had been freshly painted. Spring was here, at last.

And to top it all off it was the week right before my eleventh birthday which meant there was a fighter's chance that I would be able to scrounge up the seventy-five bucks required to buy that good condition copy of Hulk #1 in the window of Al's Comics on Fifth Avenue I had been fantasizing about getting my hands on.

I had my bat and glove and NY Yankee hat. I was on my way. To Prospect Park, that is, to play the great American pastime, baseball.

In 1978 baseball, along with comic books, FM radio, Bugs Bunny reruns, and movies like Superman, Star W\`ars and Jaws was what made life really worth living. My team was the NY Yankees. My defective paternal unit was a die-hard Mets fan but that's a different story. 1978 was the year it would all happen for the Yankees; but that was to come; now, now it was a brand-new season, and the Yankees had beaten the Rangers to win their first game off the bat.

It was all in front of us. Spring. Rebirth. Hope. Optimism. Baseball, hot dogs, apple pie and Chevrolet.

Unfortunately, what was also before us, well just me actually, was the defective maternal unit. She could smell a good time from a mile away and never hesitated to thwart it.

"Where do you think you're going?!?! You have to go do laundry!"

The defective maternal unit was really big on chores and revoking privileges. And drinking radish-onion juice at the first hint of a sniffle. And rubbing avocado on her face until she looked like the She-Hulk had run through the ugly forest. The DMU was only 17 years when I was hatched which put her just shy of the big 3-0. She was feeling her power that day.

"And I need you to go to the store. There's food stamps on the table."

i  thought of the twenty I lifted off the old man's thai stick stash in the Eggo waffle box. Fuck this food stamp shit. And I ain't washing the monster's dirty drawers neither.

"Put down that baseball glove and bat and go get me coffee or I am revoking all your privileges."

"Put down the sack of lemons you been sucking," I replied. I didn't just say it out of annoyance. She really did look like an angry, lemon sucking She-Hulk, and I know I was barely 5'4" but it was Saturday morning, I was bucks up, had my new glove broken in just about right and here stood this snarling, lumbering beast.

"Get yer own coffee, I'm going to the park," I informed her. Data processing was always a buggy affair with these 1950s units.

I heard a distant rumble through the apartment windows. They sky grew a little darker. I smelled my oiled up baseball glove. I thought of the Yanks going all the way this year. I thought of maybe even getting a hit in little league. What I got instead was a different kind of hit.

The hand shot out. I rolled with it but not fast enough. The sting of the slap made me squint.

"Get those food stamps and get me my coffee. OR ELSE."

"Jesus, who writes your fucking dialogue? Or else? Did you think that up all by yourself or did your scummy boyfriends give you help?"

She came at me with the closed fist but this time I knew it was coming. I shuffle stepped back a few feet and let my glove slide off the handle of the bat. The ball rolled out of the glove, and I heard thunder. The sun bailed.

"You get that coffee or...."

I got in my stance like Mickey Rivers. It's too hard to explain but it gives you maximum options for swatting a ball; it just looks a little funny.

"Put down that bat!"

"Get the fuck away from me. I'm going to the park."

Then she came at me. All snarly and green. A chunk of avocado fell to the floor next to my oily Rawlins.

"Last warning!" I warned.

Then she came with closed fists. I heard Phil Rizzuto's voice. It said, "Batter up!"

I took a swing, like I'd been practicing in my lonely bedroom to the oldies but goodies on 101 WCBS FM New York.

I heard the sound of Louisville wood on inhuman bone. It sounded just like a baseball.

Time stood still. If you've ever been in a car crash, you might know what I mean. There's that one point right at impact where time just stops and you're all in like a jacuzzi.

She-Hulk just stood there like a car collision in freeze frame. Mouth agape. Eyes wide shut. And then, then without another word she turned around, got her coat and left the apartment. The sky turned black, lightning proved the exception to the rule and then the deluge began.

Rained out.

I put on Fat Albert and found the roach I stole from the Met's Fan ashtray. It was thai stick. Wish I could get some now.

I got a box of nilla wafers from under my mattress, maternal unit only ate oats and groats and curds and shit and wouldn't allow any real food like Twinkies in her house; under her roof. Paid for with your tax dollars.

I was about to stuff my face and watch fucking Fat Albert pontificate on some shit when I heard the key in the lock. Then the defective unit came back. Unceremoniously unplugged the shitty black and white TV from the wall.

"You've just lost all your privileges and are going to foster care!"

I chewed my nilla wafer and listened to so many raindrops. So much for opening day.

Then, she stormed off, leaving me without TV. I would have walked my dog but she gave her away a few months before that while I was at the shitty Mets fan's decrepit house that always smelled like dirty litter and thai stick.

And that was it. I didn't get any more television privileges and within a few months I was in foster care. Anything was better than her fucking shitty broccoli and oatmeal loaf.

When I opened the envelope, stuck to my wall where my TV should have been, inside it was a note, typed out on onion paper, it read," You just lost all your privileges. Get me coffee."
