Hey everyone, I have no idea how long I've been in the Dollar Genera Beyond, but I figure it's been about a week. I've been keeping notes in my journal (it's the purple one with the glitter cover if you must know) so I could update you guys on what I've learned about this place. It isn't a lot, I'm still getting used to the DGB, but I have made a few little discoveries.

First, let me answer a few of your more burning questions. 

Yes all my social media works but most of my friends seem to think I’m just having a go at them. The ones who do call the police for me message me back and tell me to stop messing around. I’ve had my account seized on Facebook because they think I’ve been hacked, but Reddit still seems to work pretty well. Some of you have brought up the bathroom situation. I can pee down the sink in the back, but for number twos I’ve set up a bucket with a bag in it. I’ve been putting the bags in the managers office and just kinda don’t go in there. The doors do not open and the glass will not break, as I will explain later. Keep them coming though guys and I’ll answer some more on the next one.

My first discover was that the things inside the DGB are finite. DGB is what I started calling the place to save time because spelling out Dollar General Beyond got old pretty quickly. The stuff that's here doesn't seem to spoil, at least none of the packages have dates on them, but they do run out. You'd think it would take you a while to go through all the stuff in the store, but you'd be wrong. Seven sleeps, since there are no days here, after I got stuck here I was out of the sandwiches I liked, the coffee drinks I usually drink were starting to get a little low, and the ice cream was gone. I MAY have been doing a little stress eating, but most of it is the unnoticed replenishment that we all take for granted. I tried to find more in the back, but the back is just a big open space. There are some hand trucks back there and a couple of those pump-up lift things but no product to put on the shelf. 

This leads me to the second thing.

There is NO way out of the DGB. 

The doors are still locked and I can't see anything out of the windows. There may be things out there, but they seem content to ignore me or are unaware that I'm here. The doors in the back are also unmoving, and I looked for something big to break the front windows with but that only solidified rule number two. The found a lug wrench in the automotive section, but it simply bounces off the glass and doors. It doesn’t see to damage them, nothing beyond little dents, and I finally just gave up when I got tired. While I was laying on the floor, my chest working like an accordion, I noticed the ceiling. I scampered to the back and found a ladder near the wall that they probably used for changing out the ceiling tiles and took it to the floor so I could climb into the ceiling. I thought that if I could make a hole in the roof, it's just a green metal roof, I could get out and see where I was. I took some cutting implements and got the biggest ladder I could find in the back, but as I slid one of the ceiling tiles aside, I saw not an attic space but a giant pulsating void. I reached a hand out to it, but I couldn't bring myself to touch it. It was as if something was repelling me, and after standing up there for a few minutes or hours or however long I was on that ladder I climbed down and put it away.

I try not to think about it if I can help it.

I've started doing things in the store to keep my mind busy, and they've sort of colored my days.

If Day 1 was figuring things out and Day 2 was getting settled, then Day 3 was when I sat down to color.

I had meant to go get some mouthwash when I saw the rack of color books on the stationary aisle. There were all kinds of coloring books, Avengers and Princesses, Dinosaurs and Sea creatures, and before I knew it I had a pack of colored pencils opened and was filling the pages. I spent most of that day coloring in animals of various kinds or superheroes or the intricate designs in the adult coloring books. Heck, I colored in some of the regular books too, and I grabbed a couple of the more interesting ones to read off the spindle rack at the end of the aisle. 

On Day 4 I set about building as many of the Lego sets that were on the toy aisle as I could. You wouldn't imagine that a Dollar General would have a lot of them, but I spent the better part of twelve hours putting Legos together. Space ships, dinosaurs, buildings, vehicles, I assembled them all and began flying or driving them around the floor half-heartedly. By the end of the day, I was just throwing them at the front door and watching them smash to pieces.  I told myself it was to make it harder for anything coming in, but I really just liked the way they went to pieces when they hit the glass. 

Day 5 was spent cooking and making crafts. I used the gas stoves they sell to cook a few dishes from the cookbooks, and I even ate a few of them. I had found a cookbook on the shelf and had the ingredients for most of the dishes so I figured why not give it a try? After that, I built a bunch of the crafts on the craft aisle, inflated some of the inflatable pool toys and had a tea party with them, and really just kinda had fun.

This was honestly a time of relaxation for me more than anything. I had worked myself to the bone for years and the ability to just kind of exist was nice for a change. I had been sent home for about two months with pay during Covid and the longer I stayed here, the more I realized I missed it. I missed getting paid to exist, doing things I liked, and just having fun.

It wasn't actual fun though, I guess.

It was more like when you're a kid at daycare and waiting for your mom to pick you up while you play with their toys. 

It all came to a head on the sixth day.

I woke up, excited to find something else to do, but the longer I looked, the less I found to do. I put on some clothes from the clothing section, but I couldn't find anything that was my size. I found some pants that were too big, and a shirt that was too small, and threw them both on the floor as I just decided to keep my old clothes from yesterday. I went to the toy aisle, but nothing caught my eye and after stepping on a Lego truck with my barefoot, I went to find some shoes. I then went to make some breakfast, but I was kind of over it. I settled for grilled cheese before going to find something to occupy myself. Most of the crafts were built, most of the books were colored or read, and I was struggling to find something to keep my mind occupied. I found one of those old plug-in games, the kind you plug into a tv and play games on, but I couldn't find a tv to attach the cords to.

I went to bed that night feeling frustrated and realized some of the magic was gone from my sanctuary turned prison cell. 

Then on day seven I...okay this sounds a little childish but I got fed up and went around wrecking things.

It started with something small. I woke up with a pain in my neck, surrounded by inflatable toys, and went to go get a coffee drink. I stank, I could smell myself after not having showered in five days, and decided I might try to set up a camp shower. I was still hoping to wake up and discover that this was some kind of dream I was having, but the longer it went on the less sure I was. So I went to get the coffee drink, a Starbooks mocha frap, from the cooler, but they were out. I didn't remember drinking the last one, but I guess I must have. There was a whole row of French Vanilla beside it, but suddenly that made me even angrier. I didn't want French Vanilla, I didn't want microwave toasters cooked in the microwave I'd found in the break room, and I didn't want to be stuck in a Dollar General with no one to talk to anymore! I took one of the French Vanilla drinks, stepped back, and hurled it through the glass front of the refrigerator. It shattered, spilling glass and coffee all over the floor, and made another discovery right then.

Number three, that felt really good.

I did it again.

And again

And again

When I ran out of glass, I threw a few at the front door but it didn't break. 

After that, I went on a rampage through the aisles. I smashed all my crafts, threw all my Legos, popped my inflatable friends with scissors or knives or just by jumping on them, tossed soda bottles, watched the tops burst as they went flying, and basically had a tantrum that would befit any child under six. When I was done, I lay in the wreckage, making snow angels in a pile of chips I had poured out, and as I panted heavily, I felt a little better. I had pushed over a few of the shelves as well, and between two of them, the slant they made seeming to form an arrow, I saw something else I had done. 

In my chaos, something had hit one of the ceiling tiles and now all that blackness could be seen.

I started to worry about that, but it was burnt away in the face of my newfound adrenaline. I climbed onto the two shelves, shifting a little as they groaned mutinously, and looked into that void. It was still just hanging up there, motionless overhead, and I grabbed something from the top of the fallen shelf and tossed it towards the space. I didn't write down what it was, but I guess it doesn't matter because it never came out of that space again.

I grabbed something else, had reared back to fling again, but I stopped halfway through my throw. 

Something about that darkness made me very uneasy. The way it moved after I had tossed something into it made it seem...angry? I know how that sounds, how can darkness seem angry, but it did. It seemed to watch me as I prepared to throw, daring me to let it fly and see what happened. I let whatever it was fall to the ground and went down to get ready for bed. I was tired, exhausted from my day of destroying my prison, and I decided to drag my bedding under the shelves I had dropped together. One, it made it feel like I had shelter, and two it was the cleanest part of the floor with the least crap on it.

Three, I guess, was that if it all collapsed on top of me, at least I wouldn't be stuck here.

I had scratched that last part out of my journal, but I think it's important to have it now. 

It speaks a lot to my state of mind. 

I must have dozed off for a little bit because when I came awake I was surprised to see that something had changed.

The store was completely dark.

The store lights had never gone off in the week that I had been here, not unless they went off after I went to sleep, and the new dark was highly unsettling. I wondered if that was what had woken me up, but as the shelves groaned again, I realized it had been something else. Whatever that something else was, it was now perched on top of my makeshift structure. 

For the first time in a week, I had something else here with me, and the knowledge made my blood run cold.

I was under a big pile of blankets and inflatables that I had dragged here, and I snuggled down beneath them like a kid when he thinks there's a monster in his closet. I heard it moving around, heard it making its careful way off the shelves and across the mess I had created. The way it moved made me believe it was huge and hunkered to fit in the space, but I refused to peek and see what it was. It made noises of discomfort more than once, clearly coming down on some of the sharper bits of my mess, and I closed my eyes and tried to stay as quiet as I could. I wasn't sure if it was dangerous, and I didn't know if it would hurt me, but I knew enough to know that I didn't want to find out.

It moved about for some indeterminable amount of time, could be an hour as much as it could be five minutes, but eventually, it left and I could see the lights blink back to life as they came on again.

Whatever it had been, it had killed the lights and I made a note to watch out for that in the future.

Eventually, I gave up on sleep and got up to see what was still eatable in the destroyed ruins of my cell.

After finding some unopened chips, a mostly intact pizza, and some soda that I hadn't wrecked, I sat down to eat breakfast and write this.    

I decided to transcribe the journal into my phone, just in case something happens to it, and I've also decided to go into the bathroom again. It brought me here the first time, maybe it can take me back again. Even if it doesn't, maybe it will take me somewhere else. I've ruined all my food here during my tantrum, and if it brings me right back here, then I guess I'll have to salvage what's left and try to live as long as I can.

Looking through the door now, the DGB on the other side looks very different than the one I'm in. 

It looks like this one when I first came through, and I'm hoping that if it doesn't take me back where I came from then maybe it will take me somewhere that less wrecked.

Wish me luck.

Either way, that's all for now.

Hopefully, there will be a chance for more some other time.
