Ok, so I’ve been having some weird dreams, with no help from other places, so I’m here. I can safely say these dreams are the scariest things I've ever been through. I haven’t been through all that much though, so not that big of an accomplishment. I just hope someone here can help.

 Imagine you’re maybe camping. I’m not quite sure what exactly you're doing but, it seems related to MAYBE camping. It’s nighttime, you’re clearly deep in some mountain valley. You walk further along a path, to a dock in a lake. The doc is broken down, with the last few planks of wood just barely hanging on by its nails. The contrast of the water is striking, you see the reflection of the moon. Looking up at the real thing, it looks sickly, the color is slightly green? And I woke up.

  
On a different night, I woke up floating, looking up at the sky from beneath the murky water. You see an endless array of colors dotting the sky, that come more into focus with each second you get closer to the surface. The stars are brilliant, nothing you have seen in your life. you see the moon, It seems sick again. The water feels thick. You try to move around, wading in the endless abyss of water. When you catch your first breath of air, it's like you begin sinking, the water that was once still and viscous, now fluid. As you’re thrashing in the water you realize that it’s surprisingly… empty. My feet couldn’t touch the bottom, and in fact it was colder the lower your body was.

  
I saw that dock again, in the moonlight. Imagine you try to rush and swim towards it. You make it maybe, two feet. Something brushes along the entire length of your body. And you wake up. I don’t know what that was, but it shocked me so hard I woke up, so thank God. I'm so scared to have this dream again, I don't know what that was. It felt like a fish but, not. This wouldn't be so bad if this wasn't a big thing!

  
Now, on to the last dream I had. The one from last night. Imagine you’re in the water again, but you cannot breathe, and cannot break the surface tension of the water. Each Time you feel your fingertips scrape the surface, screams. No matter how hard I thrashed or swam, nothing could help. Now we can’t hold our breath forever, so my body inhaled all on its own. The water was hot, almost like pouring rubbing alcohol directly into all of my soft tissues in my lungs and throat. Eventually I stopped thrashing and awoke right before I passed out in my dream.   
  
 After these, I cannot sleep whatsoever. I need some help on this. Maybe I’m scared about the move? I don’t know. My Mom says It’s because of my internet habits, but I really don’t think screen time has anything to do with recurring nightmares.
