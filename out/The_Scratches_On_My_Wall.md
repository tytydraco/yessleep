AS usual it was 1:04am : I'm taking a night walk. I don't know why I do this; I just like to walk in the silence, probably a movie influence, even though my parents scold me, but I secretly get out of the house and enter it without them noticing. Tonight I came a little far, near the hilly area. I approached a small hill; it was not my usual path, but I had never been here before, and my other mind said to go for it; so I started walking, humming a song. It was dark as the street lights were old and dim, I was the only animal; it seemed, as there was no human or any nocturnal animal. But then some moments later, I heard a faint dry susurration. At first, I ignored it, thinking it was just the sound of trees, but later, when I looked up at the top while pointing my flashlight, I saw two dots reflecting light and two pointed things from the dark top, which were probably of a nocturnal animal at first glance.

Seconds later, it went away on its own. Later on my path home, I don’t know why I felt the temptation to point my torch at the top of the hill. I saw it again, closer this time, staring at me without blinking. The same sound accompanied a bad smell. I blinked again, and it disappeared. But this time, that animal made a loud sound and came running down the hill toward me. I ran faster, not toward my home but away from it.

The creature was quite fast! I've run as fast as I can; it approached near me. I glanced back a little and saw it under the dim street lights. It ran with a limp in an unnatural way, or maybe it was natural—I just got a glance. It was black, glowing eyes in the flash, with broken and curved horns, and four legs, its mouth was open. It was about 50 meters away from me and getting closer, my lungs were burning. But as I turned, I noticed a thick tree nearby; my mind came up with two ideas: flight or hide, and I chose to hide. I hid, trying to calm my breath and heartbeat, trembling and sweating profusely, with my eyes closed and my hands covering my face. For half an hour or more, I remained in that position, still trembling, and tears streamed down my face. I don't know where that creature went, but I feared that I would not return to my home, as the creature could be on the way. I don't understand anything.

Meanwhile, while I was hiding, I again started hearing the susurrus of footsteps and vibrations on the surface, becoming louder and louder. I was trembling faster, but my position remained unchanged. The sound was now hitting my left ear, and a terrible pungent smell, like old pennies, hit my nose hard; I felt goosebumps all over myself. Then the susurrus stopped, and I heard a sniffing sound and felt something touching my hair. My heart almost stopped; I felt like I was fainting. But then I heard the footsteps getting faint, as if something was going away. After that occurrence, I stayed there for about half an hour more, and then I slowly opened my eyes, fearing that the thing could strike me. But no, there was nothing. Somehow, I managed to look across the street, but there was nothing there either. I don't know how, but I somehow managed to get home, trembling and reacting to every faint sound or light.

I got inside my house, careful not to make any noise. I was still trembling and sweating. The pungent smell was stuck to my jacket, so I threw it off into the laundry cupboard. Then I noticed a wound on my heel; it was not that big but still not too small, so I washed it and applied medication and bandages. Then I went into my room, careful not to look into my dressing mirror. I just didn't want to, so I covered my eyes, approached my bed, and covered myself with the blanket, trying to sleep. But no sleep came, and my goosebumps never ended. Later that night, I heard something scraping against the walls with a tool. I was terrified again, fearing it would break in. But the noise disappeared. At some point, I fell asleep. Soon, the alarm rang, but I was absolutely exhausted and fell asleep again. My mom came and woke me up. But the bandages were still on my leg, and when I came outside the house and looked at my room's wall, there were visible deep scratches of multiple parallel lines.
