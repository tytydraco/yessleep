Im that one kid who never pays attention, always sitting there watching the class go by nothing interesting to talk about.  
Although everyone knows me in class no one talks to me, yeah.. they call my name a few times but that was it i was all alone.  
Alone was a strong phrase i thought as i trailed slowly to my English class after lunch. My class is just chaos. Theres this kid called Pera who was a class clown, he was loud even when he was calling his friend’s name you can hear him.  
He sat in the middle row opposite me in English, i sit by the window on the right and his friends Santi and Lenni in the middle row one behind eachother.   
Our teacher, Mrs Watts cannot teach, our class of 27 pupils always talk over her or do their own thing so life in her class is hard. I, on the other hand never do her work, none of the class do.   
I leaned against my chair as I listened intensely on what the girls behind me were saying.  
I couldn’t hear properly due to the class talking over eachother and Miss Watts monotonous “be quiet” “work on your own” shouting. I tucked my chair in and pulled my dark bag closer to me so i can read my book in peace - the girls stopped whispering and carried on talking in their normal voices they said something about a missing class and compared it to ours, i shrugged off what they were saying and turned back to my book.   
Pera was being annoyingly loud again, he got up and took Lenni’s equipment who smirked and made a big deal out of it. Pera did this a few times while Miss Watts was telling him off and sanctioning him with a warning. After a while Pera got bored as he hummed to himself and drew in his book.   
I kept getting distracted as i looked around at my class who were talking, eating, looking at Miss Watts, trying to get Santi’s attention and mimicking our teacher.  
“Aca! Aca!” I jolted in my seat as i turned to face Pera who waved to catch my attention. All eyes were on me wondering why a popular kid wanted to talk to a girl like me.   
“Aca, allow open the blinds and pull the window up is bare hot in here!” Pera shouted across to me as i did what any person would do.  
I got up, walked over to the window and-  
“No no no NO!” Miss Watts yelled as she lunged towards me. Her dirty blonde hair draped against her shoulders, black trousers and her light blue blouse fluttered around her. I felt like all the air was sucked out of me as her hands wrapped around my neck. She stood their facing me.  
“GET AWAY FROM THERE!! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU-“  
“M-MISS… MISS I JUST ASKED HER TO… O-OPEN THE WINDOW…!” I heard a familiar voice as my neck turned over to Pera who was already up and next to Miss Watts who ignored his reply.   
The whole class was silent as Miss Watts mumbled to herself, each utter progressively got louder as she realised what she had done. My neck was free as i let out a gasp of relief but the class.. they were stunned.  
Miss Watts walked slowly back to her seat, each foot she put in front of the other was dragged, and her body was slouched. I can still feel her nails digging into my neck as i rubbed the sides with my hand, Pera on the other hand, he didnt move he just stared into my soul.  
“M-miss what was t-that…” a stutter broke the silence as all of us turned our head to Santi, his long black straight hair covered his brown eyes, black hoodie even though he wasnt allowed to wear one and a facial expression that was hard to explain what he was feeling.  
She didn’t answer. She was seated in her chair, her dark eyes looking at the white desk infront of her. Everyone came out of their shocked position and started speaking quickly about the incident, i just stared at Pera who was breathing heavily as if he just ran a lap.  
“Uhmm, Aca.. hey.. are you erm.. okay..?” He walked up to me his hands in his pocket and a sympathetic look edged across his face, his cheeks flushed pink as i smiled at him.  
“Yeah.. i dont know what that was..” i trailed off as I noticed everyone was moving towards the door as well as looking at me. Miss Watts was still in her position as everyone was in a confused state still wondering what just happened..  
I apologised to Pera as i grabbed my things and came back beside him. For some reason, i didnt feel annoyed or angry at the situation just weirded out by it.  
Why would she do that? I know everyone was asking the same question as me.   
“WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN.. OPEN UP THIS DOOR!!” Lenni, a close friend to Santi and Pera was banging upon the door like a hooligan, his shouts became louder as he pounded his fists like an animal who wants food.  
“Lenni.. Lenni.. LENNI.! What are you doing?? Who is talking to you?!” Santi asked as he rushed to his friend who turned around with a disgusted look on his face.   
“LOOK AT ME BRO.. i hate this dumbass teacher im out man i aint staying here.” Lenni hissed to Santi who rolled his eyes with a smirk, both of them walked up to the door.  
Why was they so desperate to get out? I mean nothing actually happened we were just waiting for Miss Watts to carry on with her lecture upon poems but she wasnt.  
My eyes darted to Miss Watts who looked grey-ish to me, her blonde hair was messed up completely to the core as well as her clothes which had holes planted on it. I gasped as i noticed what she was doing, long red lines were on her neck as her nails scratched up then down. While we were panicking eventhough the incident was harmless to me, Miss Watts became more insane, worse than before.  
The door was locked. Santi and Lenni complained to Miss Watts but she never did anything. Only scratching herself.  
The air was hot as everyone banged upon the walls and the only way out of the English classroom was the locked door.   
“MISS I NEED TO GO TOILET!! HEY.. HEY.. HELLOOO” one of my classmates shouted, they were moving their hand over Miss Watts eyes to get her attention but it was no use.  
She was still in the same position.  
That’s when we heard it.  
We dont know where it came from.  
The chilling scream engulfed the classroom. It wasnt just regular shriek it was far more bloodcurdling as the voice cracked in half, it was as if the victim was being crushed brutally.   
The scream. No one could identify if it was a male or female. Everyone knew that we had to get out of this room. That was the only thought that edged across the minds of the fourteen year olds, get the hell out of there.  
What was that..?   
The whole class started panicking as all of us huddled together incase something might happen.  
We didnt think. Just acted on instinct.   
The only person who wasnt near us was Mei. Her dark long hair, layer of lipgloss on her lips and a calm energy that was closure to us.   
She was popular. Amongst every one of the popular girls, Mei was the most prettiest one. I thought she dated Pera, they would of been a power couple but i doubt they would get along with eachother. I was relieved they werent dating.  
She stood there glaring at Miss Watts coldly, all of us whispered to Mei to come over here but she didnt.   
“Guys dont move… stay over there… im going to work out where that scream came from..” Mei muttered to us as she paced around the room looking at Miss Watts then at the walls.  
The scream didnt come from this room… nor did it come from outside this room.. infact the halls were quiet, it was the end of english period shouldnt there be people walking to science or maths - whatever their subject was no one was going. The only view we had of the hallways was the locked door and the small square window, it only showed the red locker and the big light blue door to our left.  
“Mei! Listen to me, wherever that scream came from its not our problem now is it.. we should just focus on getting out of here!” The popular girl from before who was sitting behind me, she said that - she walked slowly holding her hands out to calm Mei down even though she wasnt showing any emotion of fear.   
“Uh yes it is our problem.. there could be a school shooting.. or i dont know!! I dont want to be here Riley okay..” Mei repiled as she turned around so her back was facing us.  
“The scream sounded like it came from outside the window.. maybe it was someone messing around..? We shouldnt jump to conclusion guys” she then turned around facing us, she was smiling faintly as her hands played with the end part of the table.  
“MEI… MEI COME ON.. COME OVER HERE!!” Pera and Lenni bellowed at the same time as half of the class hushed them.   
I looked at Pera who made his way to the wall and leaned against it while Lenni and his dark blonde hair, blue eyes and a smirk of satisfaction due to him arguing with Mei. Now that’s a power couple.   
“Pera…” i whispered as he adjusted his position, i then crept up towards him - his long curly brown hair, hazel eyes and freckles, and brown skin tone matching mine. I went beside him, we both watched the class come up with an idea to escape as well as asking Mei to join them.   
But my focus turned to Miss Watts.  
Miss Watts was weird, but she never acted like this. Obviously. But the class, they look like they’ve seen this happen, it was just me that was paying attention to her no one else - everyone ignored her presence whilst i was trying to figure out why she was looking like she was now.   
Thats when we all heard it again.  
I wish we understood what Miss Watts was saying.  
A loud scream stabbed my sides as my legs gave way. I quickly covered my ears, it echoed and it was longer than before. We all knew that it didnt come from outside the English door, everyone was coping my act as we buried our heads into the carpet bellowing at eachother to close the window, because that’s what was making our ears bleed.   
My hands pressed hard onto either side of my ears as my eyes lingered onto Pera who was trying to calm me down and not let go of my position. I panicked as i watched him get up and sprint to the big blue window where i sat previously, the air inside me escaped as i screamed, it was more powerful.   
I didnt know how i screamed like that but i made sure Pera heard me. Everyone was crouched onto the ground except him. Everyone was focused on the pain that slashed our ears and body. But me? I had to bare the agony that consumed my brain, i scrambled up to grab Pera, he was already at the window. but.. i was too late.. echoes of yells and gasps drummed in my ears as all of us spun around towards the locked door that burst open.  
All of us instantly recognised these people as they stormed in with weapons of all kinds. They grabbed Pera as he bellowed and begged, i closed my eyes as he winced and pleaded.  
I couldnt speak. I couldnt move. I was preserved in a position that was unexplainable.  I was alone. Again.   
That was a strong phrase.   
For some reason, after that incident we werent allowed to look out of any window.. Pera tried to close it when we heard that scream.. All of us had a sudden urge of what was out there, he knew..   
But whatever was out there was alone?.. Not really because when the second scream was heard it sounded different from the first.. it sounded like the victims were being crushed   
brutally.   
However something was off about this second scream. After replaying it over again in my head i was able to work out what it sounded like.   
Us..
