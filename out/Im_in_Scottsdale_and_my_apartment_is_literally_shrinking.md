I’m posting this from my phone while I still have a signal. I moved into the Optima in Scottsdale four months ago because of the Aura-Gen pilot program. 

It knocked $1,200 off the monthly rent, which was the only way I could afford a place in this zip code. 

The Dynamic Spatial Allocation was the selling point. The walls are on haptic rails and move based on "real-time utility"the bedroom shrinks during the day to make the office bigger, then it resets at night. 

It’s all automated.

It started acting strange a few days ago, but the real failures began last night. At first, it was just the "ghosting." I’d leave a coffee mug on the kitchen island, and when the walls shifted, the mug would stay behind, hovering for a few seconds before dropping onto the floor. I filed a support ticket (Ref: #8802-S), but the Aura-Gen rep just told me to "recalibrate the haptic floor sensors."

Last night, the floor lost its density. I walked into the kitchen and my feet left permanent indentations in the tiles. I went to the bathroom to splash water on my face, but the toothbrush holder was gone. 

My toothbrush is now embedded three inches deep into the drywall. The bristles are just sticking out of the paint. When I tried to pull it out, the surface of the wall shifted not the rails, the actual drywall moved away from my hand like a muscle flinching.

There is a constant hum vibrating in my teeth. It’s a low-frequency resonance that makes it impossible to sleep. I checked the Aura-Gen app for a manual override, but the UI has completely changed. There are no menus anymore, just a green progress bar over a black background:

\[Volume Optimization: 98%\]

 

The front door is a flat image now. I can see the grain of the wood and the deadbolt, but there’s no depth to it. It’s like a high res sticker on a solid slab of concrete. 

I tried to use my emergency key, but there’s no keyhole just a texture that looks like one. I looked out the window to call for help, but Scottsdale is gone. There’s no street, no traffic. Everything outside is just a blurred, high-contrast grey haze.

There’s a white sedan sitting in the middle of that haze. It’s slumped on the back-right tire. I’ve seen that car before. I shouldn't have.

The apartment is physically shrinking. The bedroom is now a four-foot-wide corridor. My closet is protruding into the room at a 45-degree angle, cutting off access to my bed. My shadow follows late. About a second late. I’ll wave my hand, and the shadow on the wall waits.

There’s a layer of fine, grey dust on everything. It’s on my skin, my laptop, and the floor. It isn't dust, really it’s bonded to the surfaces like a second skin. When I try to scrape it off, it feels like I’m scraping my own fingernails.

The app just pinged a new notification:

\[Occupant Status: BACKLOG\]

\[Repatriation Pending: SITE 04\]

I can’t hear the neighbors. I can’t hear the AC. The air smells like burnt plastic and stale, acidic coffee. Every time I close my eyes, I hear a mechanical shutter click inside my head.

I’m standing by the door image now. The handle is just a grey smudge. I can hear someone in the hallway yelling about a car and a guy named Gary, but the sound is coming from under the floorboards.

The app just updated to 100%.

I’m struggling to breathe. 

There isn’t enough air left. 

The room feels like a file that’s already been closed.
