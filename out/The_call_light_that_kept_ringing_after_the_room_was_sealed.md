This happened on my night shift last week in a private hospital in Kuwait City. I know how this will sound, but I need to put it somewhere outside my head because I haven’t slept properly since. None of my coworkers want to talk about it. Security told me it was a wiring fault. Maintenance said the circuit wasn’t even powered. I was the only one who went inside the room, and I was the only one carrying the thing that followed me home.

I’m not a nurse, not yet. I’m a float “runner”—the person who does everything that doesn’t fit neatly into one job. I push wheelchairs, restock IV sets, carry blood to the OR, and bring late-night meals up from the kitchen when someone’s blood sugar crashes at 2 a.m. I’m saving for nursing school, so I take every night shift I can. Nights are quieter, until they’re not.

Our hospital is modern in the way that looks good on brochures. White walls, soft lighting, stainless steel you can see your face in. The new wing—sixth floor east—had opened just a few months ago and then… half-closed again for “negative pressure calibration.” Infectious diseases, isolation, the kind of rooms where the doors whisper shut and air hisses around your ankles. They had sealed three rooms—615, 617, and 619—and strung orange plastic across the hall like a construction site. Someone hung a paper sign that said DO NOT ENTER. The tape curled at the edges because the AC never stops in Kuwait, even at 3 a.m.

That night, the sixth floor was my last round before break. The Amal nurse (we’ll call her L., because she was kind to me and I don’t want her name in this) was doing meds. The charge nurse, a Filipino lady who has worked nights for fifteen years, was half asleep behind a screen, charting with the world’s softest keystrokes. The others were in and out of rooms; you learn not to look too long into a room where someone is struggling to breathe. You learn a lot of things.

The call light on the board chimed: a soft, pleasant ding that is supposed to mean “please come help me reach my water glass” but very often means “I am about to die.” The square light labeled 617 lit up amber, then red, then amber again like it couldn’t make up its mind.

The charge nurse didn’t look up. “Ignore east,” she said without looking at the board. “Electrical is doing tests.”

The board dinged again. 617. Again. Again. Each time a polite little bell. Ding. Ding. Ding.

I shifted on my feet. The thing about nights is that nobody wants to be the one who breaks the routine. We all act like the ship runs itself. But a call light that doesn’t stop is made to get under your skin. It’s a baby cry designed by engineers.

“Electrical already finished,” L. said, her voice low. “They sent email.”

The board dinged three times in a row, fast. The light for 617 flashed hard red, then steady.

The charge nurse finally looked up with a frown and unplugged the sound. The light stayed on. She picked up the phone and called the switch. “IT, sixth floor east—yes, that one again. No, there’s no patient in 617. It’s sealed.”

She listened and rolled her eyes. “They say it’s a phantom input from the old panel,” she told us, then in a lower voice added, “Kul sana winta tayyeb,” like people say during Eid—except it’s also what people say when something that always happens, happens again.

“Phantom,” L. said back. “Okay.” Her mouth was a straight line.

The board flashed a tiny message in green text: PULL CORD—BEDSIDE.

That’s not how phantom inputs look. I know because I tested the cords in every room on my third shift ever just to see what the board would say. OVERBED if you push the pillow button. BATH if someone slips in the shower. BEDSIDE if you pull the red string by the bed.

“Who’s in 617?” I asked. It was my first week assigned to this floor.

“Nobody,” the charge nurse said. “Sealed.”

The board chimed again. The light wouldn’t go dark. The little message kept popping up: BEDSIDE.

“I’ll go check the door,” I said, because if nobody cut the sound, it would keep flashing red and we’d all feel slightly crazy.

“You don’t need to,” the charge nurse said, already dialing Maintenance. “They—”

“I’ll just check the door,” I repeated, because that’s a runner’s job: the small things that let everyone else pretend nothing is wrong.

The sixth floor east hallway was colder than the rest, the AC turned up to dry out the plastic construction sheeting. The orange tape vibrated with the vent’s breath. 617 sat in the middle of the sealed section, the door a heavy thing with a long window, the kind you can see your own reflection in if you stand in the wrong place.

I pushed the tape aside and walked up to the door. The light above it—the same light as on the board—was steady red. Somebody had taped a paper over the window from the inside. DO NOT USE was stenciled in English and Arabic on the crown of the door, neat and official.

I put my ear to the seam by the handle. The hospital at 2:47 a.m. is a collection of little sounds: elevator chimes, a cough two rooms away, the rubber wheels of a medication cart, a monitor down the hall pretending to be the ocean. Behind the door, I heard something else: a slow bell that didn’t belong on the sixth floor—an older sound, more metallic. Ding… ding… ding…

You never think about how bells carry through air until you’re counting them.

I went back to the nurses’ station. “There’s a bell ringing inside 617,” I said.

“Maintenance says the entire branch is dead,” the charge nurse answered. “No power on that circuit. And… don’t open it. Please.”

L. didn’t look at me. “Leave it,” she said softly.

The board flashed again: BEDSIDE.

“Do you remember when this started?” I asked because I couldn’t stop myself.

“Before you,” the charge nurse said. “Before the new wing opened. Before the pandemic.” Then she shook her head like she was shaking off a fly. “Go have your break.”

I nodded and lied and went to the supply closet instead. If a bell rings, you follow the wire. That’s all a hospital is: a tangle of wires and people who pretend the wires make sense.

The closet had a panel for call systems. I’d watched maintenance reset it once; the cover wasn’t locked, just clipped. I pulled it off and stared at a grid of ancient-looking LEDs and a handwritten label sheet that must have been copied over across multiple years. 617 had two lines: Overbed and Bath. The tiny red LED next to Overbed was lit. That part wasn’t surprising. The part that made my stomach drop was that the printed little number next to it wasn’t “East 617.” It was “Old East 617,” the way IT sometimes labels things they moved but never fully erased.

Old East was the part of the hospital that had existed before the renovation. Some of it got gutted; some of it became storage. One hallway on the basement level connected it to the new building: a service corridor just wide enough for a bed, painted the same pale green as every hospital anywhere.

I took the service elevator down to B2, where the corridors smell like bleach and old dust. If you’ve never walked the basement of a hospital, it feels like the undersides of your own thoughts. Laundry carts slide like phantom ships. The flicker of a single fluorescent light feels personal. There are fewer signs and more doors that say “Authorized Personnel Only,” which is a joke because on night shift, everyone is authorized if you look confident enough.

The motion sensor turned on a row of lights as I stepped into Old East. The walls felt closer. I heard the hum of a motor, a distant thump-thump of the vacuum pump that keeps the suction lines breathing. And faint under that, like the hospital’s heart murmur, a bell.

The call system panel down there was older, the kind with a real key. Someone had left the key in. 617’s light was lit on this one too. The label strip wasn’t printed. It was a piece of white tape with numbers written in faded pen. There were notes on the metal in pencil, dates and initials. One of them said 03/07. No year.

The bell rang again, not from the panel, but down the corridor where the old isolation rooms used to be. Most of their doors were propped open, empty as mouths. The last door—painted the same, with the same narrow window—was shut. Its number plate was missing. I only knew it was 617 because the white paint on the wall had a cleaner rectangle where the plate had been. Someone had removed it very carefully, like they didn’t want to scratch anything.

The red light above that door was steady.

I told myself that if I just checked that the door was locked, the noise would stop caring about me. I pressed my thumb to the crash bar. It didn’t move. Locked.

The bell rang again, but not from behind the door. It rang from behind me, at the far end, where the corridor took a forty-five-degree jog to the service elevator. A small white square on the wall flashed with each ding. It was a repeater—the old system’s way of relaying the call to the hallway.

“Is anybody there?” I said. I don’t know why I said it in English. My brain goes to English when I’m afraid to sound afraid.

Ding.

The sound felt patient, like someone who has asked for water and is willing to wait for you to remember you are a good person.

I went back up to the sixth floor.

When I came around the corner, security was at the nurses’ station: a big Sudanese guy I know who always calls me ya walad like I’m twelve. He was shaking his head. “Khalas, it’s dead,” he was saying. “There is no power. The board is lying.”

The board chimed again. 617.

I stepped closer and saw something I had missed: tiny text scrolling at the bottom of the screen. PULL CORD—03:07.

“Is that the time?” I asked.

L. finally looked up at me. Her eyes were tired in a way that wasn’t about the hour. “It always says that,” she said.

“What’s… what’s 03:07?”

“Three-oh-seven,” security said for me, like if he parsed it for me it would become less weird. “Three-oh-seven,” he repeated, softer.

The charge nurse’s lips pressed into that straight line again. “Eat something,” she told me. “You look pale.”

I didn’t eat. I went to the small lounge and opened the old incident log instead. Every unit has one: a spiral notebook with lines that run back years, where people write the things that aren’t serious enough for an official incident report but aren’t nothing either. Missing commode. Patient refused CPAP, will try again. Visitor angry about parking.

I flipped back. Marches, April, May. My hands shook the way they do when I haven’t eaten and the AC is too strong. There it was:

— 03/07, 03:07 — Call bell 617 keeps ringing. Room sealed. Cancel from panel doesn’t work. Tech “Hassan” came up—no power to room. Sounds coming from inside. — L.

My heart did something sideways. L. had been working nights a long time.

I turned the page.

— 03/07, 03:07 — Again. No patient assigned. Door locked. Security says “old wing cross wire.” — A.A.

There were five entries that date over the years, all at 03:07. The last one was from the year before I started. The handwriting was slanted and sharp.

— 03/07, 03:07 — RN left bedside. Returned to find call pulled. No one inside. — M.A.

The board chimed again, as if to agree.

I went back to 617. The paper on the window moved slightly with the pressure change when the service elevator down the hall opened. The red light above the door threw a dull glow down the plastic sheet covering the construction zone like the light you see behind your eyelids when the sun hits them. I stood in that light and tried to be brave enough to walk away.

Instead, I pressed my palm to the door and leaned close to the seam again.

For a second, I didn’t hear anything but the ceiling vent. Then, faint, exactly where my ear met the metal, I heard the bell. One ding, then a long pause, then another. In between, a whisper of air as if the room was breathing against the sealed door.

My radio clicked. The charge nurse’s voice: “Runner, ER needs transport in five. If you’re on the floor, call—oh. You’re on the floor. Can you take it?”

“On my way,” I said, because saying no would feel like admitting the noise had me. I stepped back, and in stepping back, my fingers found the door handle.

It turned.

I hadn’t pushed the crash bar. I hadn’t swiped a badge. I hadn’t done anything. The handle turned a fraction under my hand, the door shifted against the frame with a muffled suck as if a tongue had been pulled off the roof of a mouth.

I let go.

I went and took the ER transport and tried to forget the way the rubber gasket around the door had stuck to my skin for a second like it wanted me to stay.

When I got back, security was gone, and L. was sitting at the desk staring at nothing. “Do not go in there,” she said without looking up.

“I wasn’t,” I said, which wasn’t fully a lie.

“It’s not a joke,” she said. “We had a code in there years ago. Before your time. Sandstorm, power cut, backup failed for forty seconds. Patient on a vent. The nurse was alone in there pressing the call, pressing the call, pressing the call. The battery hit 03:07 and died. They said the call system was on a separate line, but… we could hear it long after.”

I waited for her to tell me she was teasing. She didn’t smile. She rubbed the bridge of her nose with her thumb and said, “Maintenance sealed the room when they rebuilt. They took the plate off the door. But the bell…”

We both looked up. The board was quiet. The little square for 617 was dark.

“Maybe it’s finished,” I said.

“Until next time,” L. said, and there was nothing in her voice but exhaustion.

I went on with my night. I carried things. I avoided that hallway. At 2:58, the board was calm. At 3:04, housekeeping brought out a mop bucket, and the smell of lemon cleaner filled the corridor like a joke about freshness. At 3:06, I was stacking IV poles back in the closet, to give my hands something to count that wasn’t seconds. At 3:07 exactly, my hospital-issued phone vibrated. Unknown internal extension. I answered.

There was no voice. Only a soft bell. Ding. A pause long enough for someone to realize the cord had to be pulled harder. Ding.

I hung up because my skin felt wrong where the phone touched my cheek. When I looked at the screen, the call history said the internal extension had come from “B2-Old East.” That’s what the switch labels calls when the repeater bounces them from the old system.

I should have gone home at 7, slept like a person who has to pay rent. Instead I told L. I’d make one more round. I told myself if I made sure the door was locked, my brain would let go.

The construction tape felt stickier under my fingers. The air felt cooler and moister at the same time, which means a vent nearby wasn’t working right. The red light over 617 was off. The paper on the window was perfectly still. I pressed my hand to the handle.

It turned again. This time I pushed.

It moved half an inch, no more, the rubber locking to the frame like a tongue to ice. Cold air slid through the gap, a thin ribbon along my wrist. It smelled like stale bleach and plastic, the smell of a room that has been cleaned and then sealed so the smell can’t escape.

I pushed again, and something on the inside pushed back, not forcefully, not with anger, but with the convincing weight of a person leaning with their shoulder against the door, the way nurses do when they’re talking to you but still guarding the patient. It wasn’t strong. It was enough.

I let the door swing closed and took my hand away. The skin across my knuckles was white where the cold had kissed it. There were ridges on the back of my hand that matched the texture of the rubber gasket. I rubbed them until they were pink again.

When I clocked out, the sun over the Gulf was doing that ugly-pretty thing where the dust makes it orange and coin-flat. I went home, showered, closed the blinds, lay down, closed my eyes, and saw the red light above the door bloom on the inside of my eyelids.

I put on a podcast to drown it. I must have dozed. Ten minutes later, my phone buzzed.

It was my personal phone this time, not the hospital handset. The notification wasn’t a call. It was a Bluetooth pairing request: CALL UNIT 600 SERIES wants to connect.

I don’t own anything by that name. The hospital does. The testing remotes—they look like white TV remotes with a red button at one end and CANCEL at the other—are called 600 Series. We hand them out when the wall pull-cords break. I had used one three nights ago in 603 when an old man with new broken ribs was afraid to reach for the wall cord; he kept the remote next to his hand like a talisman.

“Not funny,” I said to the empty room, because the alternative was not talking.

I hit DENY.

It popped up again a second later. CALL UNIT 600 SERIES would like to pair.

I turned off Bluetooth. I thought about throwing the phone.

Then the other thing buzzed.

I had thrown my bag on the chair by the door like I always do. Something inside the bag hummed once in a long, quiet note. I stood very still and listened for it to happen again.

Hummm.

I walked over to the bag and unzipped it. There were my keys. My wallet. A granola bar I had stolen from the staff fridge and then felt guilty about on the elevator. Under the bar, wrapped in the corner of my hoodie, was a white rectangle with rounded corners, the exact size and shape of a nurse call remote.

It wasn’t possible. I do not take hospital equipment home. Nobody does because if you do, everyone knows. I lifted it, stupidly gentle, like it was a sleeping animal.

It was heavier than I expected. The white plastic was scuffed at the edges the way everything gets scuffed after a few months of nights. The red button at the end was worn to a dull brown in one spot, where someone’s thumb had worried it over and over again. The CANCEL button was slightly loose under my finger, not enough to rattle, just enough to say “used.” The logo at the bottom said 600 SERIES in blue letters. There was a strip of adhesive on the back where you would stick a label with the room number. It was blank.

I have no explanation for how it got into my bag. I wish I did. Maybe I picked it up by mistake when I was pulling linens for 605 and didn’t notice the weight. Maybe someone put it in there as a joke. Maybe. Maybe.

The red LED at the top—tiny, really just a pinprick—sped up its blink as I held it, as if my touch excited it. Blink… blink… blinkblinkblink.

“Cancel,” I said out loud, the way you say R2 to a machine that you know is dumb but hope will listen. I pressed the CANCEL button. It clicked, and the light went dark.

I dropped it back into my bag and shoved the bag into the wardrobe and pushed the door shut on it and sat down on the floor like I had just outrun something. I told myself I would take it back on my next shift. I told myself I would hand it to Maintenance and say, “I found this in the supply closet,” and they would pat my shoulder and make a joke about night shift raccoons.

I fell asleep there on the floor.

When I woke up, it was dark again. My room smelled like dust and AC. Kuwait does that—you wake up thirsty even if you didn’t sweat. The clock said 03:03.

I stared at the ceiling and told myself to get up and drink water.

My phone chimed once. Not my ringtone. A bell I had never set. Ding.

03:04.

My phone lit its screen without being touched. A notification slid across. INTERNAL EXTENSION 6601 MISSED CALL.

Six-six-oh-one is the number printed on the sticker above the phone at the nurses’ station for the basement. Old East. Sometimes the morgue. Sometimes the lab when they have to call from the backup phone.

03:05.

The bag in the wardrobe hummed again, one long note like someone exhaling. I got up and opened the door. The remote’s LED was dark. I reached in and touched it. It was cold in a way plastic doesn’t usually get inside a hot apartment.

03:06.

The LED began to blink. Slow at first. Then faster. Blinkblinkblink. It felt like standing in front of door 617 with my hand on the handle, waiting for the push from the other side.

03:07.

The LED went steady red. The remote dinged even though it had no speaker. It dinged inside my skull, the way you hear your own blood if you lie too long in a quiet room. I pressed CANCEL hard enough to hurt my thumb. The button went down. The light did not go out.

The bell rang again. Ding. Then the tiny screen I had never noticed next to the LED, a thing smaller than my thumbnail, lit up a line of text I couldn’t believe a piece of hospital plastic metal could display: PULL CORD—BEDSIDE.

I don’t have a bedside cord.

The remote vibrated in my hand like a living thing. I dropped it without meaning to. It bounced once and slid under the edge of the bed.

Something on the other side of the mattress gave a weak, answering tug—as if there were a cord there after all, pulled by a hand too cold to grip.

I knelt and lifted the bed skirt. In the triangle of dust under my bed, the red LED glowed like an eye. The air under there was cooler. I put my hand in and felt the air move, not like the AC, but like a room breathing against a sealed door. I reached for the remote and my fingers brushed rubber, not plastic—the same rubber gasket texture that had imprinted my knuckles.

I pulled the remote out and the rubber came with it, an inch of gray-black flap stretched thin like gum. On the other end of the rubber, something pulled back, gentle but relentless, like someone leaning their shoulder against a door and refusing to be pushed out of a room where they had died at 03:07 on a night when the sand made the sunrise a copper coin.

I let go.

The rubber slid back under the bed. The LED blinked once like a wink.

I am writing this from my kitchen counter because the bedroom is—full. The wardrobe smells faintly of bleach and something that was cleaned too hard a long time ago. I called L. but she didn’t answer. I called security but I couldn’t figure out how to explain what I needed them to secure. I called my mother and told her I was fine and she recommended I pray, which I did, and the LED blinked on the last syllable as if to say amen.

It’s 02:58 as I type this. If you have ever worked nights, you know that 03:07 exists even on days you never look at a clock. The remote is on the table next to my laptop because I’m too afraid to push it back under the bed and too afraid to put it in the trash. The LED is dark for now. I pressed CANCEL, and it listened like a patient who trusts you for a little while.

There’s a strip on the back for a label. I keep thinking if I write a room number it will choose a different door. I keep thinking if I write my name it will stop pretending it doesn’t already know it.

The board in the nurses’ station will probably chime tonight. Old East 617. Someone will say it’s a glitch. Maintenance will say the circuit is dead. L. will make the sign of the cross—or maybe she won’t because maybe it never helps and she knows it. Security will say, “Khalas,” and drink tea.

None of them will hear the polite little bell in my apartment, the one that rings like water in a glass. None of them will see the text on the tiny screen asking for a bedside that doesn’t exist here.

It’s 03:06 now.

If you are reading this because you used to work on my floor and you ever took the Old East hallway past the sealed 617, I want to ask you a question and I don’t care if the answer makes me feel worse: When you pressed CANCEL, did it ever truly stop? Did it ever stop for more than a night, for more than long enough to make you brave enough to press the handle again?

03:07.

The light just went red. The bell is ringing.

Someone is pulling from the other side of my bedroom door. It is the polite pressure a nurse would use to keep you from seeing a thing you cannot help. It is the weight of someone who learned that if you pull long enough, someone will come. The rubber seals are very good in this city. They keep out dust and heat. They keep in… other things.

I am going to press CANCEL one more time and I am going to hold it down and I am going to tell myself that I am doing something that matters.

The LED is not listening.

The bell is very patient.
