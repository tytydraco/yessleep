So I'm sitting here, at my desk and a few sips of some cream liquor while writing this to cool my nerves. It has been an intense few weeks, more intense than I can ever imagine. I lost someone I though I would spend the rest of my life with because of the fact I couldn't help him, and because they didn't listen to the warning I gave the day they found the trinket. I'll give some context to this but this writing is a warning to other people who don't believe in the paranormal or are some degree of a skeptic. I won't be using our actual names for privacy of both myself and my former significant other.

So to give some context. I still live in my childhood home, both my parents have passed and I inherited the small house that sits in the country. Sucks that it's in the middle of nowhere, but owning the house means I don't have to pay any form of rent. So I'm happy to stay there. I lived there alone for a long time. Then I met Sam. He was this lanky bean pole, sweet guy. He was a total nerd and I loved him for it. We were pretty much compatible, months turned into a few years of a relationship. One of the things we didn't click on though; it was the fact that he didn't believe in supernatural things but I on the other hand did to a degree. It was mainly because of how I grew up.

You see, my mom's side of the family practiced all sorts of magic and witchcraft. Some of the standard stuff like card readings to things that were much more leaning in the occult. I had seen some things that were a degree unnatural, but I always brushed it off as my imagination getting to me due to being raised in around this most of my life. My dad passed when I was young, so I was raised by my mom. So I saw a whole lot of this odd stuff go on. One thing I remember big time was the fact that whenever someone died, personal family friend or someone we had intense hatred for, my mom would take a small box. Put objects in it and bind it with a ribbon in an intricate knot. I don't know the specifics. My mom even though practicing, didn't want to teach what she knew to me. She always said, "The practice dies with me". She never wanted to pass it on to her children. Neither me nor my sister knew anything but maybe the most barebones of what she practiced.

To those boxes specifically. My mom always said, "It's to stop a person from sticking around". What this mean was that in part of my family's beliefs is that when someone dies some parts don't want to leave. In some ways it's like how ghosts are at times depicted as imprints of a person rather than the actual spirit lingering. These boxes were made to basically trap or ward off these imprints. Mainly to stop imprints of malice towards certain people. The idea was that things like hate would seek out people, people the recently deceased had intense hatred for. That is why she warned me to never open them. Maybe before all this I just shrugged it off as a tradition made up by long dead relatives. After the last few weeks, I know for a fact that I will never even go near one of those boxes when I find them.

To the fateful day everything went wrong. I was with Sam, digging and getting my garden ready. I love growing my own produce and had picked out a spot to plant a bunch of peppers. We were digging the ground up, tilling it with garden soil to make it perfect whenever something got pulled up. A small box with a ribbon sealed in a plastic bag. Sam of course looked at me and asked, "What the hell is this?". I joked it off, telling him the whole thing with my mom and her little trinket boxes, and told him to put it away somewhere and forget about it. He didn't, and decided to pry. So I better explained it; of course getting a laugh in response as of how ridiculous something like this sounded. Sam saying, "Then why not just throw the box down a river or something", I responded with a shrug. I couldn't give a solid answer, I knew not to mess with the boxes and I had similar questions. Only answer I'd ever get was that destroying the container would be as bad as opening it up.

He teased me about it, joking how I needed to stop with all this silly stuff that my family taught me. He said, "Witchcraft isn't real, John. We're not going to be haunted or anything if I opened it". I stopped him, maybe a bit to harsh. I had been told and basically conditioned to leave those boxes alone for so long that even the thought of it made me nervous. Back then, it wasn't because I thought something bad would happen but because of the conditioning of a person who had been dead for a few years now. Maybe I was just scared of the fact it wasn't what my mom said, maybe she was hiding something she didn't want me to see. I didn't want to damage that memory of her.

He did eventually put the box away, and we left it alone for a while. It was fading from my mind the next week until the topic came up. He asked questions about it all, and I went into as depth as I could. The boxes, practices my family did that I knew about, and the whole belief that certain things linger after we die. He shrugged it off again, just finding the whole thing silly. He mentioned how it was just a bunch of superstitions that were passed down over generations. I responded with the fact that it may be that way, but I had wanted to respect them even if it was something as silly as not messing with a box wrapped up by a ribbon and buried in the dirt. We left it there and moved on from it. He'd occasionally mess with me about it, but it would never go that far.

I got back from work one day, about two weeks after we had our last discussion of the box. He was at the kitchen table, and there it was. The box open, the ribbon not undone but cut. He looked at me and joked, "See. There's nothing to worry about. It's just a bunch of junk", pointing to the contents of the box. I froze for a bit and walked over when I finally got that paranoid jolt to calm down. I then looked down on the table, and there were a number of things. Objects that didn't have much cohesion. A small card that had a depiction of Jesus, a few small trinkets that I didn't find too important, and a small figure made of a few sticks wrapped. I couldn't tell at first but then that shimmer came along. It was hair, a familiar shade of blonde that was obviously worn and starting to decay but I knew that hair. My mom had a similar dirty blonde shade on her head; this was my mom's hair. I felt a pinch in my chest. The last time I saw that shade, that color was the day I rested my head to hers during the final viewing. I won't lie, I felt tears wanting to form to just have some semblance of her right there in front of me. Some part of her that hadn't been burned away into ash and bone shards.

I was calm, even though so much of me wanted to scream at him. . It came out as me simply putting a hand on his shoulder, patting it and asking him to not do that again. I remember saying that I wasn't angry, but he should respect the beliefs that I was raised with just like how I respected he didn't believe in things like this. He did apologize to a degree, though trying to defend himself by saying he just couldn't stop being curious about what was inside the box. I gave a sarcastic remark, telling him how he really just wanted to try and prove me wrong and that ghosts and ghouls didn't exist which got a small laugh out of the two of us. I took the box and contents whenever he wasn't around and put it to the state it was before. I then slipped it into a small space in my barn shed, a spot I knew he'd never look. I thought, 'No reason for him to care if I put it back'.

Things started getting strange a few days in. It started with Sam, he didn't seem to be sleeping much. He constantly said it was just a rough night, needing a bit of a larger cup of coffee in the morning than usual. At that time the only bit of info I could pry out of him was the fact he was having weird nightmares. He wouldn't go into further context, just saying that the dreams were really damn weird. Then it went to things happening, objects in the house moving. Small things like car keys, our phones, maybe something we had just put down seeming to disappear and be found in other parts of the house. We shrugged it off, things like that get misplaced all the time. Where it really got weird was about another week in after things started moving. My dog, my sweet little terrier mix started acting funny. She'd look in spots, mainly when Sam was in the room. Seeming like she was looking at something, and even growling. Won't lie, even back then it was creepy but Sam reassured me that it was just my dog being dumb.

I was getting nervous at this point. Nervous because of the fact that weirder and weirder things were happening after the ribbon on that box was cut open. I kept it to myself though, knowing that Sam was going to just brush me off. It went from small things to big really fast. We were both in the living room, talking and Sam got up. He began to walk towards the long narrow hallway that led to the other rooms in the house, and then he stopped. He paused in his step and looked down the hall, his eyes wide for a moment before shaking his head. I had asked him what was happening but he said it was nothing, just had a moment. I could tell it wasn't just that though, he seemed off put by whatever he saw and he was just trying to stop himself from playing into some sort of trick his mind was playing.

I would start noticing things too. When I was in the house alone I felt like I had eyes on me. No matter what room I was in, it always felt like there was a pair of eyes looming over me. I always felt watched, like some creep was just peering through my windows at all hours of the day. I felt like I didn't have a moment of privacy to myself. I kept things quiet, just doing what I could to ignore the feeling. It would always leave when I left home was off to work, around other people and places seemed to make that feeling melt away. I thought I was being paranoid.

I'll stop here. Mainly cause I'm starting to feel the booze I'm drinking really pass through and I don't wanna pass out in my desk chair. I'll be sure to finish explaining things whenever I sleep this off and get the feeling to come back and tell everyone the rest of the story.
