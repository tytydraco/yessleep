After gazing into the floor for what seemed like an eternity, Alex finally broke his silence.

“.. energy can neither be created nor destroyed…”, he whispered. 

Dr Burk let forth a frustrated sigh as she quickly interrupted.

“Alex… you haven’t spoken to anyone since you were caught. They told me you had specifically requested to speak to me, to finally shed some light on why you did all of those horrible things. You are days away from being put to death. And this is what you so desperately needed to get off your chest?”

Alex shifted and sat up in his seat, so he could look Dr Burk directly in her eyes as he continued to speak. The shackles that were bound tightly to his hands and feet rattled with the sudden movement. 

“We all come from somewhere… but where? At one point we were simply ameba that formed into simple cell organisms. Those organisms crawled out of the sea, eventually grew legs, and boom… humanity is formed. But where did that ameba come from?” 

Alex seemed to drift, lost in thought for a moment as he set his gaze beyond Dr Burk’s shoulder. Dr Burk quickly snapped her fingers in front of Alex’s face, in an attempt to call his attention back to her.

“First, it’s the Law of Conservation of Energy, now you want to discuss the theory of evolution? This is ENOUGH Alex! Why did you do it? The acts you’ve committed are beyond comprehension. By all accounts, you were a model citizen. And then seemingly one day you murder your entire family and desecrate their bodies in ways I won’t even repeat.”

Alex continued to stare into Dr Burk’s eyes, unfazed by her words.

“The world deserves to know….”, Dr Burk said as her words broke under her emotions. “The world deserves to know why your thirst for murder wasn’t quenched there. As you continued to let yourself into home after home, after home... and repeated the same brutal atrocities. There are 26 families that deserve closure.”



“Where did that ameba come from?” Alex continued as if he didn’t hear a word she had said. “Energy manifests. You gather enough of it, and over time… an ameba is created. But where does the negative energy go?”

Alex said as he shifted his gaze past Dr Burk before quickly bringing his eyes back to hers.

“Eventually, that energy too manifests. It has crawled out of humanity, grown legs, and boom….”

Dr Burk shook her head and laughed. 

“So, this is your explanation? You believe yourself to be some kind of evolution of evil incarnate?” 

Alex leaned in, “Oh not me… I’m the vessel it crawled out of.”

“A vessel for WHAT Alex?” Dr Burk said as she grew inpatient.

“See for yourself, it’s right behind you”.

With a gasp, Dr Burk turned to look behind her. The room was empty.

“Alex, I’m afraid I can no longer continue to speak to you, as this has gone nowh…” She said as she turned to face him, her words ended abruptly upon seeing that his face had been twisted and distorted into a horrible grotesque parody of what was once a man.

“And now that I’m bound here”, Alex growled, his voice no longer recognizable as his own. “It needs to feed. It needs a new vessel, and it will be you, Dr Burk”.

Dr Burk jumped out of her seat with a panic and let forth a scream. As she turned to race towards the door, her escape was halted with a sudden impact as she collided into a scale covered torso.
