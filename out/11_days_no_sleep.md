My name is Alistor Lidner. I am 51 years old and live in Portland, Oregon.

I am a psychiatrist, and this has been my occupation for almost 30 years now.

I have specialized in the fields of stress, trauma and sleeping disorders.



Decades of experience and research have led me to elaborate the hypothesis that those three fields are interconnected, and for years have piqued my curiosity, studying how each has influence on the other.



Needless to say, my investigations stem from the need for answers, which I believe will contribute to the human species as a whole, and so they are approached with utmost respect and discretion.



A considerable amount of the people that recur to my help share the problem of the lack of sleep, usually manifested in the form of nights of little/no sleep.

Different factors influence it, such as depression and anxiety, but the subsequent effects that sleep deprivation has in the human mind (and consequently, in the human body) constitute a whole problem by itself.



Motivated by the need for answers, I started to investigate previous research in the field.



I found that severe sleep deprivation causes a fast breakdown of the mind, and eventually of the body as well. After a period of 24 to 48 hours, attention, memory, and judgment deteriorate, making the person grow emotionally unstable, irritable, and anxious. After around 72 hours, the brain begins producing hallucinations, paranoia, and distorted perception of reality, struggling to separate dreams from reality.



As the person stays awake, the body enters a state of chronic stress: elevated cortisol, rapid heartbeat, weakened immune function, tremors, nausea, and a poor temperature regulation. The person experiences microsleeps, brief involuntary moments of unconsciousness that make reality feel fragmented and unreliable.



Beyond five to seven days, symptoms resemble those of acute psychosis: delusions, disorganized thinking, violent impulses, severe paranoia, memory gaps, and emotional collapse. The boundary between what is real and what comes from the individual´s imagination dissolves completely.



I decided that it was convenient for me to understand the effects of sleep deprivation in more depth, in order to develop a real empathy towards my patients' experiences.

For this reason, I started a plan to conduct myself (for clear, ethical reasons, I cannot bring myself to use another individual to carry out the experiment).

The plan consists of subjecting myself to self-deprivation of sleep, to test its effects, for a period of 11 days (the longest a human being has been continuously awake).



My intention is not only to document the empirical effects in my mind and body, but also to feel first hand what great part of my patients and the world population experience in their everyday life.



In order to carry out the “experiment” the healthiest way possible for my body, I consulted my personal doctor. I don´t plan to do irreparable damage to my body, which would be quite unprofessional on my part. So I outlined a detailed dietary and physical/mental exercise plan for my body and mind to work the most optimal way.



# 1- Diet plan

# Breakfast

\-Oatmeal with nuts (slow-release energy)  
  


\-Greek yogurt  
  


\-Green tea instead of coffee (lower caffeine crash)  
  


\-Vitamins  
  


# Lunch

Grilled chicken (or fish)  
  


Quinoa or brown rice  
  


Steamed vegetables  
  


1 apple (natural sugar + fiber)  
  




# Dinner

Very light meals  
  


Tuna salad, eggs, or lentil soup  
  


Chamomile (not to sleep, but to keep the body relaxed)  
  


# Snacks 

Almonds

Blueberries  
  


Dark chocolate (70% cacao)  
  


A lot of water  
  


Electrolytes  
  


#  Stimulants allowed



Max 3 cups of coffee per day, spaced by 6 hours  
  


Green tea in between  
  


No energy drinks  
  


No nicotine or illegal stimulants  
  




# 2- Daily physical habits

# Short power walks

I will walk 10 to 15 minutes every 3 to 4 hours.  
This is good for blood circulation, keeping me temporarily alert.

# Cold Shower Part of my planned “alertness intervention technique.”

# Light stretching To avoid stiffness and micro-fatigue.

I will completely avoid laying down; I will only sit or stand, in order to avoid falling asleep by accident.  
  


# 3- Cognitive habits



crossword puzzles  
  


meditation



The last detail in my plan is one of the most delicate ones; since I don´t know the effects that the experiment will have on my psyche, I cannot expose my family to eventual danger.

I do not know whether this experiment will trigger aggression, confusion, or any form of psychological instability. I have two kids (an eight year old boy, and a fourteen year old girl) and a wife. Their safety is essential for me. This is why I rented a cabin on the outskirts of the city, with the intention of carrying out this experiment the safest way possible. This also implied having to lie to them, in order not to make them worry unnecessarily. Therefore, I came up with the excuse that I will be attending a professional retreat for psychiatrists. Excessive work has brought more than one argument in my marriage lately. This experiment should not be the motive of another one.

On the following pages of this notebook, I will write an entry a day, documenting in detail my observations and procedures. I pray that these pages will contribute something meaningful to our understanding of the human mind.  
  


Day 1



**9:00 AM, December the 1st, 2025:** 

I have just arrived at the cabin. It was a 30 minute trip by car, which felt like a blink. I woke early to pack my clothes, and set off at around 8:15. Driving to the outskirts of the city feels surprisingly calming. One forgets to value nature after getting used to the facilities and the comfort of the city, which is a good reason why people are less happy these days.

Upon arriving and parking the car, a family man greeted and welcomed me. He and his family live in a big house next to the one I will stay in. I learned, in the almost 15 minutes of chatting, that he also has a wife and two kids, just that both of his are girls. Seems like a nice, quiet man. He also offered his help in anything I might need. I said thanks, offered my help if needed as well, and got inside of the cabin.

The cabin is neat, well organized and comfortable. I hope this contributes to making the process of the experiment more bearable. It is considerably bigger and has more space than I thought it would have, but it contains everything I need, and even what I don´t need, including a huge 62” TV in the living room. When I thought it couldn´t be bigger, I found a locked door (probably a maintenance closet).

Now I will go on to have breakfast, and then I will go for a walk around the neighborhood. On the way, I will pass by the store and stock up on everything I need for today and maybe tomorrow.



**11:35 AM**

Breakfast took longer than expected, and I have to admit that I wasted a good amount of time sitting on the couch and watching TV. I enjoy watching cartoons on Cartoon Network. I particularly miss the old ones, from the early 2000´s and before. There is no clear explanation of why I enjoy cartoons so much. I prefer them over 90% of the movies and shows nowadays. Perhaps due to the familiarity and predictability they offer — traits my line of work has conditioned me to appreciate. My kids, on the other hand, will watch reality shows, streaming programs and anything that an average adult would watch.

After breakfast, I went for a walk around the neighborhood. It is a pretty quiet place, full of nice houses, nature and quiet people. It is certainly a place to consider for retirement. 

I stopped at a small store to buy food, toilet paper and other diverse stuff that I considered I could need. Like the rest of the people I have met here, the cashier is a nice and warm person. We spent some minutes talking about the comfort of the place, the neighbors, etc.

Now I am back in the cabin. I am going to make myself something to eat, watch some more TV and maybe do some crosswords. 

I will update again later.



**7:30 PM**

I had not updated yet, because I did not consider there was anything quite interesting to share.

After lunch I watched TV, solved some crosswords, went for another walk and took a cold shower. I am definitely not used to cold showers, and it felt like a torture, but I can say I feel way more energetic now. Actually, I feel amazing. It is quite interesting how a healthy meal, a routine of exercise and a cold shower can boost your energy up.

At some point I grew bored and decided to go to the backyard for some air. There I saw the neighbor (who I hadn't mentioned is called Eric) on the other side of the fence, and we established a conversation. I offered him some help to move a stack of firewood he was struggling with. He appears to me as one of those people who seem too nice and joyful to be true. This is a feature of some people I have always found rather unsettling (if the word applies here), although I am no one to judge, especially talking about a positive feature.

 We pretty much talked about work, taxes and shared political views. He demonstrated being an intelligent man, and quite involved in the matter of politics. He is also a big football fan, yet I couldn´t engage in that conversation, because I am not interested in sports at all. I have never been, and I have never been interested in cars or F1 either. Now, at 51 years of age, I can say this is a shame, because I am often excluded from many conversations.

Now I went completely off-topic.

I will update again when I have something interesting to add.

PD: At some point of the conversation, Eric mentioned that some wild animals wander at night, but that I should not be alarmed. I am still going to be careful.

Also, I avoided telling him the actual reason for my presence in the cabin, at least for now.



**11:24 PM**

I went for another walk. This time I went with a big stick, just in case I came across a wild animal.

After coming back to the cabin, I followed a meditation program from a book I have (a gift from my wife), and then I sat to watch TV.  

I have to admit I did not do anything else that I would consider productive. After some time, you run out of things to do. This is something I am going to have to deal with these days, especially considering I will not be sleeping at all.

Apart from boredom, I am starting to feel tired and sleepy, which is not very convenient. At this time I would normally be already in bed and getting ready to sleep. I do not discard the idea of making myself a good mug of coffee in a while.

To think that I still have 10 days and 35 minutes ahead makes me feel demotivated, but I will not surrender.

I should not fall asleep.
