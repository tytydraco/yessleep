I had always been curious about furries. My own curiosity led me to research certain aspects of the concept, appeal, and overall community known by this name. On the most surface level, they can be described as humans embroiled in a passion. Their passion of choice being to dress as “cute” animal fursonas—anthropomorphic animal avatars made manifest through an abundance of wealth, free time, craft supplies, and a mutual shared interest with like-minded individuals. This much I learned easily. My curiosity led me deeper into a nebulous web of subreddits, obscure forums, and Discord groups.

I could not describe to you what drove me in this fixation. I had no desire to be one—just an obscene academic curiosity into the anthropology of the furry phenomenon. I’d studied many groups in an attempt to grasp the intrinsic concepts of their collective identity. From the self-loathing of some groups and the absolute delusions of others, the central point was always “to belong.” It is a natural human drive. Every other group I had studied, though, had a more or less clear identity that furries somehow eluded. Inexplicably, the group is tied up in so many subcultures that it is hard to even comprehend the cohesive theme outside of the costumes. Each rabbit hole of research led to more questions.

I dare say that my own obsession was a decadence mirroring that of the subject I studied so adamantly. I had preconceived, early in my studies, that furries are a sign of the age of decadence—a turning point in the timeline of society that could not be walked back. A degenerative pox on society leading the way to further and further forms of excess.

Joyous was I to find those within that community that shared mutual interests—those that strayed from the pack, at least to my eye. Relatively normative people that just happened to dress in such ostentatiously expensive costumes. This kinship, while meaningful in my research, led to the inexplicable horror I now put to paper. Through these people who shared my love of trading card games, I had been invited to my first furry convention.

A friend from a Discord invited me. Vindication! I had a guide and a field in which to conduct research in the flesh—to take my work from the world of the hypothetical to the practical. On a dreary Friday, I arrived at this convention center. Oddly, this venue being a tottering old hotel, hollowed out and in ill repair. A building seemingly out of time and location for northern Minnesota. The architecture seemingly Victorian-inspired, but constructed of oddly brutalist cement blocks by appearance. A wide swath of evergreen forest played backdrop to this inexplicable structure. My guide, Randal, arrived. I beheld a portly man emerging from an oddly adorned SUV, his green fursuit an assault on all meaningful sense of sight.

His awkward gaze met mine. Cautiously, I raised my hand in a wave, him ducking back into his vehicle, panicked. Re-emerging with the fox-styled head of his suit covering his face.

“Hey man, nice to finally meet you!” he said, all panic seemingly having left him, bounding toward me with oddly animated movements.

“Likewise! I’d again like to thank you for inviting me to this, Randal.” I extended a hand to shake his. It was met with the odd oversized paw gloves, the texture of the fabric horrendously synthetic.

“No problem!” he exclaimed loudly. “Just don’t call me Randal. I like to stay in character. Call me Mossy.”

I had contemplated how long it would be before this meeting would get… disquieting. I quickly tried to change the subject.

“So, this building here—do you know anything about it?” I asked, turning to again take in the oddly out-of-place architecture.

“Honestly, not a whole lot. Used to be something called St. John’s. Sounds like a hospital, but this is too small to be a hospital, I think,” he said in a more mundane tone—the process of thinking clearly breaking him from his character momentarily.

“That is at least something to go off of.”

I removed my phone from the car and began trying to use the browser. I pecked at my phone multiple times as I slowly took notice of the terrible cellular signal out here.

“Oh yeah, cellular sucks out here—which is great for us. Sometimes people like to come and harass us or stream at conventions, and not all of us are about that life. Like jeez, leave us alone!” the furry formerly known as Randal offered to me. “No Wi-Fi either, just good furry fun for three days!”

Thankfully, I had several documents stored on my computer for reference, but this would be an inconvenience. Such is the nature of fieldwork, I mused to myself as I retrieved my travel bag from the trunk, taking notice of the various other attendants. A multitude of various-colored furries—so many of them wolves or foxes. I found slight disappointment in this. Of all animals in existence, these were the most prevalent among furries. I will admit to some joy seeing a furry in a suit that resembled a black cat—nature’s most perfect creation—then found the visage sullied by the presence of a diaper on the fursuit.

“Degeneracy!” I muttered, as I mentally damned such an affront.

“What’s that?” Randal asked, having somehow invaded my personal space to a frightening degree. “Hard to hear in this sometimes.”

“Nothing, just taking a mental note of all the costumes,” I said, somewhat louder than before, taking a few steps back to regain my personal space.

“Yeah, isn’t it cool to see!” he stated cheerily. “It’s gonna be a lot of fun. Let’s get in there!” he said, keeping pace with my attempts to step away.

“Sure, lead the way!” I replied quickly. “Have you been here before?”

“Yeah, a couple of times! It’s pretty much just an open area. There’s an artist alley and a place to dance! There’s an upstairs area with rooms if you need some private time. Not sure who furnishes the place or who even hosts the con, though.”

This he rattled off to me as he dragged me by the arm, his pace faster than his corpulence or age would seemingly allow. My heels digging into the soft, damp earth halted our progress. I wasn’t sure what I had seen at first—an orange, rigor-ed animal face looking directly at Randal or myself. The visage was a fleeting image that seared itself into the theatre of my mind as I lost sight of it in the shadow of the building as we moved.

“What’s wrong, friendo?” Randal asked, as I pulled free and stepped back a bit.

My heart quickened as I tried to scan where I thought I saw that horrific face. The more I thought of it, the clearer it became! It was like a fursuit head, but no oversized “cute” eyes. No, these were tiny, glassened, dead eyes. The structure of the head more failed taxidermy than design. The more I thought about what I had seen, the more phantasmal images of it played in my head. The faintest glance of this thing sent my mind reeling down a path of mental imagery with no origin point in what I could have possibly perceived. A furry paw on my shoulder snapped me from the mental spiral into the cool air. Sense returned as ringing ears faintly perceived the words:

“Are you ok, friendo?”

“Yes… Mossy,” I replied tentatively, swallowing hard as I composed myself. “I just thought I saw something.”

I was led by my guide into St. John’s and taken from location to location, being introduced to a series of colorful characters with equally colorful names. Their mannerisms—the childlike joy so many lose to age. I did my best to ask the questions I wanted answers to. I took notes, but only with half the presence of mind—the rest of my mind still drifting to that taxidermiesque face, playing over and over on repeat in the quiet moments of my mind. A sound of unknown providence accompanied its mental image, stained upon my mind.

Randal had tried to get me engaged in the “dancing,” as he coined it. I did my best to entertain the notion, losing interest quickly as the house-styled music grated upon me. I excused myself after, with no prompting, a person in a reptilian fursuit aggressively began to grind on me. My personal space being violated was enough to throw me off, but more offensive to me was why the female-presenting reptile would have the fattest set of tits I had ever seen on any living creature.

I walked away, finding myself back in the artist alley. Some of it was palatable by the definition of the word “art,” but most appeared fetishistic. I wondered to myself, as I observed these pieces, to which art school does one go to study animal genitalia in such dramatic detail. I had a brief chuckle as I contemplated an art major with a minor in agriculture being the appropriate answer—a laugh short-lived and stifled as that sound and mental image struck me, head pounding with shockwaves of crippling headaches. That unidentifiable sound was now a gale in my ears. A stench rising from an unplaceable vacua—the smell of rancid roadkill and freshly spawned maggots.

Hazed-over vision tunneling to perceive, at the entrance of St. John’s, that same horrific face—that dead-eyed, horrific fursuit head atop the slender, emaciated body of the palest man I had ever seen. A flannel covered in pine needles and detritus as his shuffling gait brought him into the room. A stained white crop top clung tight to his torso, revealing an impossibly vascular midriff.

My vision swam and swayed as I turned from him, looking for a location to flee. The artist alley was no longer there—replaced now with a winding dirt road ensconced by thick trees and undergrowth.

“I am John St. John!” the voice, low, dark, and primal, bellowed out! The very trees echoing this utterance. I turned back to see as he continued to shamble slowly forward, as though moving by sheer force of will alone. He now too walked a winding dirt road, the trees behind him folding in to close the way out. “And you have entered this ancestral birthplace without the proper blessings or adornments.”

I feverishly broke into a dead sprint, the unnameable sound bellowing in my head louder again. I shook my head against this, my pace slowing as I pushed further down the road, the trees and scenery now taking on a fetid vista—viscera of unknown origin weaving its way between tree branches, intestinal webs of no clear design or purpose, half-eaten squirrels and rabbits littering the edges of the road. In my frenetic glances, I failed to observe a hole in the road. Falling, hands scraping against the rough dirt and stones.

“What do you want from me!?” I shouted, turning to see the creature still slowly shuffling its feet, which were adorned in cartoon character slippers.

“I want to tell you my story,” it said, its stride never breaking. “You came to this home to study! You judged!”

The thing’s voice was growing angry, hostile, accusatory, and hollow. I saw as the gruesome fursuit head’s mouth moved, meaty sounds of fat popping crackling with each movement of the jaw.

“I just… I just wanted to know more about furries!”

“No, you came into this house with ill intent. My parents had ill intent.”

I turned to crawl and stopped as I saw two gored bodies on a hardwood floor, their guts chewed open, foxes rabidly tearing at their entrails and throats.

“God help me!” I shouted, in prayer to any being that would hear it. Tears streamed down my face. “I didn’t do anything!”

“Neither did they! They abandoned me—their legacy—because they could. But those that feast on their flesh are my real parents. The foxes raised me! They taught me their ways! They helped me claim my ancestral birth home, and it is a sanctuary for all my children!”

Visions fluttered across my vision of the furries I had seen—their own suits now disfigured taxidermy. Wherever I was, I could not truly see them, but they could see me. I saw Randal’s moss-covered skin jostled as he cheered, the fat tits of the scaly from earlier undulating as she jumped in exuberance.

“My children are not for your research. My legacy is not your curiosity. My will is your only grace!” The voice screamed, growing frantic and unhinged. The very vibration of this thing’s speech rattled my organs and teeth.

I turned and attempted to scooch away from the thing as it now moved to all fours, its slight musculature impossibly tight around its emaciated frame. The glassy eyes freewheeling in the sockets of the horrid countenance it bore. Its jaw moving, revealing black and red viscera snapping between teeth and tongue with each word.

“Just stop! I’ll leave! I’ll never talk to a furry again!” I screamed, pleading with the abomination.

“No, you will stay! Stay with us. Let me be your mother, child.”

“What the—” Words stolen as its fingers clasped my mouth, its free arm lifting my body like I was weightless. With eyes wide in terror and that sound deafening all but the beast's words, I whimpered. What was once a human-sized creature was now immensely bigger!

“Do you hear it!? That sound in your ears right now!” it asked, jaw opening wide and face splitting open, revealing a single sucking orifice. “Tell me, child! What does the fox say?”

In one swift movement, before the question struck my mind, I was plunged into the orifice. My body passed through an impossibly tight passage into a fetid pit. I panicked as I tried to think of a way out, waiting for gastric acid to assail my flesh.

“You will not be harmed, for you are not in my stomach, child. You are in my womb and shall be reborn in my image—one of my herd! Now be in darkness.”

I don’t… I don’t remember what happened after that. There are flashes—something touching my mind. An umbilical cord? A song. Faint images that are vague impositions at best.

Sentience only came back to me later—on the floor in the abandoned St. John estate. I was wet, covered in what I can only assume was birthing fluid. Something had changed, but I couldn’t tell what it was. I knew that I had passed through John St. John, but I couldn’t remember the trauma of the encounter. Not for a long time. Not until I realized what had… changed. My flesh is not my own anymore. It is a loan of that miserable wretch, John St. John. Soon I will replace it with an exoskeleton of my own design. I know now that I belong to that eldritch being born of neglect and malice. There is… I could end it all by my own hand—steal this flesh from John St. John! I could want to. The part of me that is still me knows that the madness should end—that I should do away with this cursed boon of flesh! But my fursuit arrives tomorrow. It’s a great suit. I am gonna be a black cat with the fattest tits you’ve ever seen. What’s one more day? What’s one more visit to the St. John estate? What’s wrong with inviting a few friends? UwU.

Love,
