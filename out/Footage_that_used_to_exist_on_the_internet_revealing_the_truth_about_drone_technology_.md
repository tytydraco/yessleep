The footage I am referring to was filmed by a secular party of human vigilantes, probably from the late 70's, I would guess. Though I knew very little at the time of my initial viewing -- being only a few years old -- I still remember seeing the footage from my computer savvy cousin who was one of the few people that actually understood how to use the ACTUAL internet (not the fake internet that just uses algorithms to emulate an interactive web of human individuals engaging in virtual communication).

  
Nowadays the "actual" internet is referred to as the dark web / deep internet, but I don't think it even works the same as it did back around the beginning of 2000's. There used to be a way to actually use the real internet for sharing files & info with others that only the more clever folks knew about, while everyone else just used the fake internet without knowing any better. Basically the same thing as watching the news & feeling like you have been informed of what is actually going on in the world VS going out & observing what is truly happening out there; VERY few people actually do that.

  
I will now describe the footage I saw & the significance of it, which I did not grasp on my first viewing.  
The footage was recorded from a distance & it was clearly nighttime; the one filming it was outside in some kind of overgrown field with forest nearby. There was no audio, but the visual quality was decent. In essence, the short recording displayed what appeared to be some hobo chasing another guy through the field, as if trying to catch or harm the guy being chased. The hobo was running in a pretty strange way, like really forceful & robotic but pretty darn fast. At the time, I recall my cousin remarking that he figured the hobo must have been some crazy guy on drugs or something. The guy ahead being chased was running in a noticeably more natural, proficient, coordinated way & kept looking back at the hobo chasing him as he was fleeing through the field in the dark. The camera was using thermal night vision so that the footage would be visible & even though it seemed to be zoomed in quite a bit the quality was good enough to tell what was going on.

  
Apparently the guy being chased was leading the hobo to some kind of trap. Once the two of them reached a certain point there appeared to be gunfire from hidden allies of the guy being chased which was aimed at the hobo chasing him. The vigilantes opened fire on the hobo ... & in that moment an explosion occurred. The hobo literally exploded like a bomb. The blast was big enough to where it seemed to injure the guy being chased, like at least 50ft ahead. The guy fell down & shortly after, a few of his allies came sprinting out to check on his condition.

  
The footage ended about a minute later, with the guy's allies surrounding him trying to help get him to safety, presumably. My cousin referred to it as "a crazy suicide bomber hobo trying to kill some guy for reasons unknown", as he would speak about it to friends & acquaintances. In truth however, he didn't know what to make of it & no one really did.

  
It was just one of those creepy "is it actually real?" internet videos that circulated for a bit & then died out ... except this one was NOT being circulated for a long period of time & not very many people seemed to know about it. It could only be accessed on the real internet & only for a limited time, as I recall asking my cousin about it not even a year later & him telling me that it got taken down / wasn't accessible anymore. Though he saved the footage on a drive & had it with him back home, he didn't have a way to show me again the next time he came to visit. I asked him if he could send it to my mother's email so that I could have it too & he scoffed in amusement stating with a chuckle, "Terrible idea ... I could get in big trouble for that ...". A few years later from that point my cousin died in a horrible car accident (friend was driving, car was totaled, smashed into oncoming traffic).

  
I will now explain the real significance of what that footage revealed, as I now understand the entirety of what was captured in that long lost recording. The "hobo" was actually a reanimated cadaver, or in modern terms a "drone". The reason it was chasing the human was because the human did something to provoke it; probably by trying to knock it out or immobilize it. That is how drones are programmed to react to situations where a human demonstrates hostility & the location is secluded enough so that no one will bear witness to what happens next. The drone will "shift gears" & start behaving like the zombified killing machine that it is, in an effort to stop / kill the human. In such a case, it is presumed that the human is informed of what the drone really is & that the human needs to be "taken care of", so to prevent the spread of information which might compromise the discretion of other drones. Essentially, a drastic method to silence the "Involved Party" before they reveal what they have discovered to any other available humans.

  
However, in such a case as what occurred in the footage -- with the human having taken extra preparation into account -- there is only so much that the drone can do besides wildly lunge at the human & pursue them until it catches & pummels them dead. Being that the human was going to escape after his allies began firing guns at the drone, it defaulted to it's last resort mode of attack & exploded in an effort to destroy the human along with it. This has happened countless times through recent history & has been obfuscated (or else loosely referenced, otherwise) as "spontaneous combustion", surprise terrorist attack, suicide bombing, sudden disappearances / kidnapping, etc.

Again, this drastic option is only employed in cases which ordinarily do not allow for other humans to bear witness to the real events that occur. With this in mind, it is not so often that the masses of society will have the chance to catch the lie that is sold to them, in place of the real events.  
There is also the matter of "destroying the evidence", that serves as a major factor in preventing other humans from realizing the truth about "drone technology". This is probably the main reason for why the design of the drone is made to explode; by dissecting the drone or performing an autopsy, even a novice would immediately recognize that the innards of the drone are completely altered from the organic human anatomy. Further, if the "Involved Party" were clever enough they might also be capable of learning how to make a drone that would serve their own interests, or else even re-program any drone to move / act under a different set of prerogatives. It goes without saying that something like this would utterly dismantle the schematic efforts of those aiming to eradicate the organic human species, or at least would serve to frustrate the process of replacing human life forms with such ease.

  
Currently, there is no way for humans to integrate with one another so to orchestrate a trap of similar nature to what was shown in the footage I mentioned. There also have been a great many advancements to the design of a drone to where they are virtually impervious to any means of destruction. The nerve channels in particular -- the medium for electricity to be conducted through the drone, resulting in all the motions & maintenance of operations -- are nearly indestructible. Every last human individual in today's time is constantly surrounded by nothing but drones, so it wouldn't be very difficult to just "shift gears" & send all the drones into "kill the human" mode without needing to worry about the secret getting out.

  
It makes me hopeful to realize that there were once organized groups of heroic humans that worked so hard to fight back against this dreadful nightmare. I like to imagine that a few of the more talented, determined, clever ones were successful in affording other humans a chance at seeing through all this deception & distinguishing between the inferiority of a drone VS the familiarity of a fellow human. I know that those responsible for all of this will pay a terrible price, even if they only carried out the effort due to their own incompetence. Deceiving children from the time of their birth into mistaking these demented pieces of furniture for their own parents / guardians / loved ones is completely unforgivable.

  
It is my dream to one day manage to reconvene with another organic human life form. Fortunately I am able to discern between drones & humans, which is how I know that not a single human life form is available for me to interact with ... for now.
