So I posted here before about some of the strange things I’ve seen in my work as an explorer of Fairy Pockets. Think backrooms if you didn’t read my last post and still need an example of what I’m talking about. https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/hFlQy7sXF5 here is my last post for reference. 


Last time I broke down a few of the places I’d seen. So today I’ve got a few more. 


One time I was in Europe on a “business trip” and found a bridge in a rural area east of Berlin that only appeared under a full moon. When I found it, it was guarded by soldiers in World War Two era uniforms, but from asking the locals about it I gathered that sometimes they would be dressed as NVA troops or Franco-Prussian war troops or medieval knights. Not sure what variable dictated the time period. The weirdest part was that they didn’t speak German, instead speaking a language I never could identify. 


They’ll ask for your papers… at least I think that’s what they want. But  they accept anything you show them. They mean you no harm, though what they are really I’m not sure. I can’t explain it but I got a pretty strong feeling they weren’t human. 



Another time I was in Florida, and I found a restaurant in the middle of the Everglades. A clean, well kept little cafe. Dead in the middle of a swamp, with no way of accessing it. 


Stepping inside I was greeted by a middle aged lady with a funny accent who told me the daily specials in broken English. They were bizarre things, cow eyes fried in butter or teriyaki rats. I posed as a health inspector and shockingly the kitchen was very clean. Still didn’t eat anything though… sup not of the faerie as they say. Or maybe I’m just too chicken to try weird swamp teriyaki. 


Now for the last one today, I warn you. This place was awful even by my standards. 


I won’t tell you how to get in, not because of any legal restrictions this time. But because I really don’t want any of you going to this place and getting killed. 


The entrance was a highway tunnel built into the side of a rise in the Pine Barrens. I'll tell you that much, because it won’t give you a hint how to make it appear. 


Follow it about ten miles into the ground and you’ll come to a parking lot. Like one of the multi level car parks you find in big cities. Find a parking spot, and take care to park legally. The traffic cops down there are seriously jackbooted. I mean TSA with a toothache kind of mean. Then walk to an elevator in the center of the garage and take it down. Congratulations you have just entered hell. The sign by the door reads Pinerock Mall, with a picture of a Greek comedy mask grinning next to it. But I’m sure they just misspelled Hell. Easy mistake for something made of solid madness and screaming eyes I’m sure. 


Oh it’s not the worst thing I’ve ever seen, doesn’t hold a candle to those clowns in Chicago. And it’s certainly no Rockport. But it was not something I would wish on my worst enemy. 


It was, a perfectly normal shopping mall. Probably built somewhere around the late 70s or early 80s at least in appearance. A bit large but nothing out of the ordinary. Abandoned but in good enough condition to restore. No leaks or flooding and the power was still on. Lights flickered faintly and as I wandered the halls scratchy speakers played a loop of Aretha’s RESPECT, just the chorus in a painful sounding twisted loop like the tape was melting. And an announcement in a chipper voice that “The Pinerock Mall is Eternally Blessed by Your Presence. Remember to shop excitedly!” Spoken in a strange cadence like the speaker didn’t know the language they were using. Everything was still pretty normal though except for the stores. 


All abandoned but they ranged from odd antique baby dolls and knives were the only things in one shop, to the wrong, another was full of cages like a pet store but there were human bones in the cages and all the signage said it had been a slave market. Yeah, you read that right. To the pure evil, a video shop like Blockbuster that seemed to carry nothing but videos of people dying. 


Still it was all abandoned, suddenly abandoned by the looks of it. Like that city in Ukraine that was evacuated after Chernobyl. Things were left sitting around as if everyone had just gotten up mid day and walked out. Like I’d missed the rapture, except with what these stores sold there was no doubt these customers were not raptured. Smited perhaps. 


Still so far you probably wonder why I said this place was so bad. After all all I’ve described is a lot of evil shops, big deal right? Just go to a bad part of New York and you’ll find worse. Well maybe not a slave market… openly. But you get my point. 


Now as I slowly made my way through the empty concourses I was actually glad that this place wasn’t any worse than abandoned evil. I mean there are places where the ground has teeth and the sky screams in colors beyond the mind. The slave trade is nothing compared the madness of gibbering gods beyond the concept of time. 


But then I reached the central plaza. 


You know how some malls have a hotel built into them? It was more of a thing in the 80s but you see it from time to time. A nice hotel rising like a middle finger pointed at heaven from the temple of consumerism below. As if a building that let you eat, buy a TV and get a cheap suit without stepping outside was worth spending a day or two in it. Alright maybe I’m a little; scratch that a lot jaded. But I still never understood that architectural trend. 


Well this was one of those malls, roughly cross shaped, with four big concourses coming off of a central plaza that went up about seventeen stories with hotel balconies looking down on you. Now picture if you will that arrangement with a fountain at the center of the plaza. A nice water feature that teenagers would congregate around in a normal mall. Now replace that water feature with an elaborately decorated hole in the ground and you're getting close. 


It was a pit about 20 by 20 feet with a raised lip around it decorated with a pattern of theater masks done in small tile mosaic. And from it was imitating a smell like death had died and started to rot. 


I pulled the gas mask from my belt and stepped the edge wondering what had gone wrong in my life to lead to this point. I played a spotlight into the pit and will try to describe what I saw at the bottom. 


A soup of liquid flesh, boiled below me with eyes and mouths rising to the surface like bubbles popping with a sound like a mating cougar crossed with a badly maintained piece of industrial equipment. Splashing as if churned by some force below its surface and stinking so bad I wanted to puke through the mask. 


That is a bad, cartoonish and mostly unhelpful description. But it really is the best I can give.


Now the hypothetical you. Mister Random who has wandered into this place by sheer accident and colossally bad luck would, being a sensible person, run. Possibly screaming like a little girl, as fast as you can in the opposite direction. You are a smart, sane and well adjusted person. I however get paid to poke cosmic bears for a living so I’ll give you three guesses what I did and the first two don’t count. 


Yeah that’s right. I, God  help me, tossed a coin into the well. Actually it was a glow stick, I digress. It hit the surface with a weird metallic sound and a splash, and that is when all hell broke loose. The masks all around the building carved into the artistic bits of walls and floors all began to laugh hysterically. 


The liquid flesh quickly bubbled to the surface, and at that moment I ran, turning once to see it pouring over the lip of the well. Screaming in a dozen languages telling me everything I’d ever done wrong.


As I ran it followed behind me like a tsunami of screaming meat. Unfathomable in how wrong it was, yet somehow alluring it made me want to turn and look at it. I didn’t. 


Sloshing and screaming It filled the floor quickly and by the time I reached the elevator it was already biting my shoes. Hairy teeth pulling strips of rubber from my soles. 


I climbed up the elevator cables as I doubted it would work with that stuff pouring in and made it to my car just inches ahead of the wave. I peeled out of the parking lot, and shot into the woods of the pine barrens like a wine cork. The tunnel entrance behind me was closing to chew. 


I’ll be quite honest with you, I don’t even know how to end this one. Other than to warn you against trying to find that place. Though if you did try and find it that would be natural selection at work. But there’ll be other stories coming, assuming I don’t die too soon. There are more weird things in this world than you’d ever know.
