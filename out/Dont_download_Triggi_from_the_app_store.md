I was lonely. I was desperate. That’s where I made my first mistake.

*“Hey handsome. I checked your profile and you seem like the kind of man I want—download Triggi so I can get to know you better.”*

It was obviously a scam. Some pudgy middle-aged guy with carpal tunnel shooting out thousands of those messages to a long list of social media accounts. You download the app, they prod you for personal info, and then they steal your bank account or open a credit card in your name.

Jokes on them. My credit’s shit. They’ll get laughed out of the country if they tried that.

But like I said: I was lonely and desperate. I hadn’t had sex in over two years. Not since Hailey dumped me for Evan. I lost my girl and my best-friend all in one go.

My social life was nonexistent. I barely left the house anymore. I figured that since I had nothing they could steal, I had nothing to lose. Maybe this was the one-in-a-million real, actual person reaching out to me.

So I went to the app store and downloaded Triggi. I’m being generous when I say it looked like donkey shit. I didn’t care. Less strain on my phone’s memory.

The whole setup was very basic: you sign up and create an account, make a profile, then start browsing. I assumed it was supposed to mimic a dating app, but it was never made clear.

There was little in the way of instructions. Once you finish your profile, you’re immediately beset by professional-looking photos of stunningly beautiful models posing as single women who were unlucky in love and just know their prince charming is out there swiping through profiles.

Triggi never indicated whether you’re supposed to swipe right, left, up, or down. I tried them all, and they all took me to a new profile. I have no idea if I was agreeing to match with them or not.

I swiped through the app for an hour. Nobody caught my interest. Just one clearly fake profile after another. I was about to give up when I heard a ding. An icon appeared in the bottom right corner, letting me know I had a message.

Curious, I clicked on the icon. It took me to a message center. I hadn’t seen any way to access it before, and there were no icons to take me back or exit to the homepage. I had one unread message from a user named “HotGirl20495.”

It read, *“You must be really lonely tonight, Wes.”*

That creeped me out. How’d she know my name? Again, curiosity got the better of me. I was unsettled, but not enough for me to shut down the app and delete it forever.

*“Why do you care?”* I typed back. *“And what makes you think my name’s Wes?”*

*“It’s right there in your account name,”* she replied.

I called myself “FewestStrokes69.” Yeah, I like golf and I still find the number sixty-nine funny. Sue me.

While I had to concede that “Wes” does show up in there, it’s quite a leap to claim you figured out my name from it.

She quickly added, *“I care because I loved you, once. I told you I’d never stop caring about you.”*

I messaged her, demanding, *“Who is this?”*

*“You know who it is,”* she insisted. *“How many girls would let you suck on their toes for hours?”*

To be clear, I *don’t* suck on toes. I did it once, as a joke. And it didn’t go on for hours. I’m sure she was just exaggerating.

*“How the hell did you find me on here, Hailey?”* I questioned.

*“It wasn’t hard. Only the loneliest and most desperate end up here,”* she answered.

*“So…what? Have you been stalking me?”*

*“I don’t need to stalk you. You carry me around wherever you go,”* she said.

*“Why’re you being so cryptic?”* I asked her. *“Actually, why’re you on a dating app? Things go south with Evan already?”*

*“Forget about him. I’m all yours,”* she told me.

I scoffed at that. Hailey was never mine. She and Evan started sneaking around together only a few days after we got together. I could never fault him for wanting her. She was incredible. There was never a dull moment when she was around.

*“Are you drunk or something?”* I asked her. *“The last time we talked, you made it very clear that you wanted nothing to do with me.”*

I waited for her to reply, but my message remained the last one on the screen. Thirty minutes went by without a response. Typical. The moment you said something she didn’t want to talk about, she just ignored it.

Taking her radio silence for an answer, I closed the app and tossed my phone down beside me on the couch. I got up and went to get a drink.

Trying to have a conversation with Hailey was always frustrating. It usually ended with me drowning those frustrations until I blacked out and forgot about her.

As expected, she never messaged me back. I kept checking Triggi, becoming obsessive. First it was every half hour, then every fifteen minutes. Soon, I was opening and closing it at least once a minute.

Still, there was nothing. My collection of empty beer bottles grew. I finished off an entire six-pack, stupidly thinking she might say something. She never did.

I passed out on the couch with my phone clutched to my chest. I never closed Triggi the last time I checked my messages.

A loud ding jostled me from an unquiet sleep. Barely half-conscious, I glanced at my phone screen. There was finally a new message in the app from Hailey.

*“Do you want me to prove how much I love you?”*

I tried to check her profile, hoping to see if there were really pictures of her on there, but I couldn’t find a way out of the message center. I still had a bit of a buzz, so I wasn’t thinking clearly. Stupidly, I replied to her.

*“Yeah.”*

Triggi immediately crashed the moment I hit send. When I tried to reload the app, I kept getting an error message.

I deleted it from my phone and went back to the app store. But when I searched for Triggi, it wasn’t anywhere to be found.

Not too surprising. It was a crappy app to begin with. I figured enough people reported it and had it taken down.

Throughout the day, I kept thinking about Hailey. She always knew how to get under my skin. Since I couldn’t talk to her on Triggi anymore, I decided to text her.

I composed a long message, pouring out my feelings and telling her how much she hurt me and how much I still loved her. Then I hit send.

Blocked. She’d blocked me. This woman was infuriating. She stalked me on some weird app nobody’s ever heard of filled with scammers, and yet she blocked me from texting her phone.

I drank heavily again that night. I’m not proud of it. At around 3 AM, I stumbled to my room and collapsed onto my bed.

I had a nightmare while I slept it off. Hailey was on top of me, riding me like she used to. I felt like I was in heaven. The way she writhed her body was mesmerizing. I felt like a snake charmer.

“Are you almost there?” she asked me in a sultry voice punctuated by a moan.

“Yeah,” I replied.

“Good.”

She lifted her arms, and I saw the glint of the blade a split-second before she plunged a knife into my chest. I watched in horror as she stabbed me, feeling every inch of the steel pierce my flesh and sink into my heart.

I woke up and clutched my chest. The pain lingered for a few moments as my brain reoriented to the waking world. I was drenched in sweat and my heart was pounding in my chest. I sighed in relief that I was alive.

Rolling over, I bumped into something. There was someone under the covers with me. They were facing away from me, and the comforter was pulled up over their head.

My first thought was that Hailey had broken into my house during the night and climbed into bed with me. I didn’t completely hate it, either.

Slowly tugging the comforter down, I quickly saw that their hair was too short to be Hailey’s. It looked like a guy.

“What the hell?!” I cried.

I threw the covers off and jumped out of bed. I pushed him, trying to wake him up. Instead, I ended up knocking him off the mattress. He fell to the floor with a thud.

I leapt out of bed and rushed over to the other side, ready to fight the creepy intruder who decided to hop into bed with me. I recognized their face immediately. It was Evan.

The audacity of that man! I kicked him harder than I should’ve, but I was pissed. After ten years of friendship, he stole my girlfriend and laughed about it. Now the two of them were messing with me, playing some kind of sick, twisted game.

“Get up, asshole!” I bellowed. “Get out of my house before I kick your teeth in!”

He didn’t move. My blood froze as I looked at his face again. It was chalk white, and his eyes were open. He wasn’t looking at me, though—they stared lifelessly at Death.

Evan was dead. I had been sleeping next to his corpse. I saw something poking out from beneath the collar of his shirt. I hesitantly crouched beside his body and pulled the collar down.

His throat had been slit. Strangely, there was no blood anywhere. Yet the flesh of his throat had been neatly severed in one clean stroke.

My phone dinged. I shuffled back around the bed in a stupor, my eyes fixed on Evan’s corpse. I grabbed my phone from the nightstand and unlocked it.

Triggi was back. There was a notification that I had a new message. I clicked on the icon, bringing up the message center.

*“Do you believe me now? Have I proven how much I love you?”*

My mind was reeling. There was no way Hailey murdered her boyfriend for me, and then broke into my house to stash his corpse in my bed…right?

*“What the hell did you do?”* I asked her.

The doorbell rang, causing my heart to nearly leap out of my throat. With trembling fingers, I checked my Ring camera. It was Hailey. She was now at my front door.

I clicked the button to talk over the speaker and exclaimed, “What’re doing here?! What do you want from me?!”

“Look—I know you hate me, but I’m worried about Evan,” she told me. “When I woke up this morning, he’d left a note saying you had an emergency and needed his help. I’ve tried calling and texting him, but he’s not answering. Is he here?”

I glanced over at Evan’s dead body. Yeah, he was here. But he was already gone. My phone dinged again.

“Hang on. I just woke up,” I said to Hailey. “Gimme a minute and I’ll be right down.”

Closing the Ring app, I hovered my thumb over the icon for Triggi. Another new message. I pressed it and held my breath as I read it.

*“That’s not Hailey. Don’t let her in.”*
