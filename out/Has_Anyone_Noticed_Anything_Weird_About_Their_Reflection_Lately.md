 

I am obsessed with online rumours and myths surrounding rituals and supposed “haunted” games. Some people find it weird, but the main reason I take so much interest in these things is the thrill that follows when I manage to debunk one. Bloody Mary for example. Turn on your tap to warm water, turn off all the lights in the bathroom, and say Bloody Mary three times in the mirror. No ghost, no blood on the walls, no nothing. I think a part of me hoped that I’d stumble across a game or a legend that was true. Something mystical in a world so bleak and unimaginative. I think I stumbled too far.

 

I read online that if you stare at yourself in the mirror for an extended period from 10 minutes to an hour, then you start to hallucinate and see ghosts in the reflection standing behind you. I tested it out one afternoon two weeks ago. I’m going to explain everything I did during this time just in case someone reading can point out any mistakes I made and suggest a way I can reverse the effects. Trust me I could really do with one right about now. I walked into the bathroom and closed the door. I didn’t turn on any lights since it was the middle of the day, and the sun was still up and lit most of the room. I walked over to the sink and positioned myself in the middle of the mirror setting a timer on my phone for 30 minutes. I placed my hands on either side of the sink and stared into the mirror blinking every few minutes. This is all I did. I thought it was ambitious to set a timer for 30 minutes, but I felt I had to prove to myself that I remained true to the legend and still managed to debunk it.

 

After what felt like 5 minutes the reflected wall behind me seemed to become darker as the shadows in the top corner grew and blanketed across the entire wall and started to inch closer to me. My vision seemed to blur around this time since I remember thinking my face looked a little fuzzy resembling that of static pixels on a TV screen. My skin tone remained the same, however, until around what felt like 10 minutes when the bags under my eyes began to droop down my face to the corners of my mouth in a melting effect. I remember grinning after seeing this. No ghosts, just a funky little hallucination that distorted the viewer's face. I even thought about telling my friend about how to do it, but after what happened I’m glad I didn’t.

 

The entire top half of my face began to melt downwards, my pupils additionally growing darker to the point they enveloped the whites of my eyes entirely. My heart began to race a little at the sight as the scene started to resemble that of a horror movie when the monster was finally revealed, only this time it was me. My eye bags melted further as they passed my mouth and dangled below my chin swaying from side to side. The room behind was now a black void absorbing all light save for the portion that still lit my face. My face began to ripple and create folds of skin like water droplets cascading down my cheek I couldn’t look anymore. Grabbing my face, the smooth feel of my skin making my stomach drop as I pulled it away from the mirror. I was back. The room was just as it was when I first started, only a little darker now as the sun began to set over the horizon. Catching my breath and laughing to myself I felt disappointed that I only lasted 13 minutes according to the timer. I wish the story ended here.

 

Every time I look in the mirror, I still see that face staring back at me. I’m starting to forget the way I looked before. Before any of you point out, I did in fact go back to pictures of myself on mine and my family’s phones. It's all the same. In the picture of my sister’s wedding, I’m no longer the handsome ring bearer people remember to be, but rather a horrific beast that makes my sister’s tears of joy now look like that of a hysteric woman on the verge of fainting. In my graduation photos, the cheering of students in the background now look as if they’re all screaming in terror at the creature that has stormed the stage.

 

It's not just mirrors either. Glasses, shiny mugs and silverware, a particularly reflective plastic tub, and even water. The ripples make my reflection distort into itself amplifying how sunken my eyes are. It's starting to affect my daily life. When I go to shave my beard, my face won't stop contorting as the folds of skin spiral around itself in a dizzying effect that makes me feel sick. Not one to back down I try to shave regardless, droplets of blood trickling off my face and staining the ceramic white sink beneath. The cut was so bad my parents believed it was an act of self-harm and rushed me to the emergency room to get stitches before booking me an appointment with a psychiatrist. I took this as an opportunity to tell them about my reflection, but I don’t think they understood the situation since they turned to me with a smile saying.

 

“Sometimes I hate my reflection too. It's easy to let Instagram get to you and fracture your perception of what you consider to be the beauty standard, but I assure you that apps and people like these will and have used Photoshop and filters for years now. I recommend that you limit your activity on these platforms for a while.”

 

Nothing’s improved. I can’t drive anymore out of fear that I'll see my reflection in the wing mirror. I’ve removed all mirrors and screens from my bedroom besides the phone I’m currently using. My heart racing so fast it feels like it's going to burst from my chest in a blaze of blood and bone, my hands slick with sweat, and my knees buckling every time I catch my reflection. I’m ashamed to admit that I wet myself closing the fridge door as the polished surface reflected my face, now melting down to my chest and breaking out into spirals as it intertwines with my stitches growing like tree roots through my pores.

 

I can’t live like this. I’ve started considering plastic surgery, anything that will alleviate my reflection in some way or another. My face is growing sore from the number of times I’ve felt it with my hand to reassure myself that I’m not in fact melting the raw skin now creating a shade of pink in the ever-growing melting pot of my flesh. I need help. If there’s anyone out there who can help me reverse the effects or give me any ounce of advice, I could really do with it. I pray for anyone else out there currently suffering the same fate as me.
