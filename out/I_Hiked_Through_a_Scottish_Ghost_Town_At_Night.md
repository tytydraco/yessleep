For the past two and a half years now, I have been living in the north of the Scottish Highlands - and when I say north, I mean as far north as you can possibly go. I live in a small coastal town, which is actually the northernmost town on the British mainland. I had always wanted to live in the Scottish Highlands, which seemed a far cry from my gloomy hometown back in England – and when my dad and his partner told me they’d bought an old house up here, I jumped at the opportunity! From what they told me, this place sounded like the perfect destination. There were seals and otters in the town’s river, Dolphins and Orcas in the sea, and at certain times of the year, you could see the Northern Lights in the night sky. But despite my initial excitement of finally getting to live in the Scottish Highlands, full of beautiful mountains, amazing wildlife and vibrant culture... I would soon learn the region I had just moved to, was far from the idyllic destination I had dreamed of...

In my spare time, I took to exploring the coastline around the town's area. On one of these days, I started to explore what was east of the town. On the right-hand side of the mouth of the river, there’s an old ruin of a castle – but past that leads to a cliff trail around the eastern coastline.

Six or so months later and into the Christmas season, I’d just gotten out of a long-distance relationship. Feeling as though I had finally found closure, I decided I wanted to go on a long hike by myself along the cliff trail. And so, the day after Christmas – Boxing Day, I got my backpack together, packed a lunch for myself and headed out at 6 am.

The hike along the trail had taken me all day, and by the evening, I had walked so far that I actually discovered what I first thought was a ghost town. What I found was an abandoned port settlement, which had the creepiest-looking disperse of old stone houses, as well as what looked like the ruins of an ancient round-tower. As it turned out, this was actually a heritage centre – a tourist spot. It seemed I had walked so far around the rugged terrain, that I was now 10 miles outside of my town. On the other side of this settlement were very high, distant cliffs, which compared to the cliffs I had already trekked along, were far grander. Although I could feel my legs finally begin to give way, and already anticipating a long journey back along the trail, I decided I was going to cross the bay and reach the cliffs - and then make my way back home.

By the time I was making my way around the bay, it had become very dark. I had already walked past more than half of the bay, but the cliffs didn’t feel any closer. It was at this point when I decided I really needed to turn around, as at night, walking back along the cliff trail was going to be dangerous - and for the parts of the trail that led down to the base of the cliffs, I really couldn’t afford for the tide to cut off my route.

I made my way back through the abandoned settlement of the heritage centre, and at night, this place definitely felt more like a ghost town. Shining my phone flashlight in the windows of the old stone houses, I was expecting to see a face or something peer out at me. What surprisingly made these houses scarier at night, were a handful of old fishing boats that had been left outside them. The wood they were made from looked very old and the paint had mostly been weathered off. But what was more concerning, was that in this abandoned ghost town of a settlement... I wasn’t alone. A van had pulled up, with three or four young men getting out. I wasn’t sure what they were doing exactly, but they were burning things into a trash can. What it was they were burning, I didn’t know - but as I made my way out of the abandoned settlement, every time I looked back at the men by the van, at least one of them were watching me. Already feeling scared of the creepy surroundings, I now felt very unsafe because of these men, staring suspiciously at me. I was paranoid that they were going to try and follow me - as if I had caught them doing something illegal... Thankfully, they stayed where they were, as I continued to make my way out the ghost town and back along the trail... 

The abandoned settlement. The creepy men burning things by their van... That wasn’t even the creepiest thing I came across on that hike. The creepiest thing I found actually came as soon as I decided to head back home – before I was even back at the heritage centre... But that's a whole other story.
