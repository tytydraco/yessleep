During the last few months, we've had reports of attacks on pedestrians. Victims have been completely torn to pieces, and the few survivors that witnessed the attacks describe a ten foot tall bat monster as the culprit.  The reports had been dismissed as pure trauma induced lunacy. It didn't help that most of the bats' victims were committing crimes or known violent criminals. The police department was not in any rush to get to the bottom of things  until those orphans were taken. 

The mayor is looking to get reelected soon, and rumors of a giant bat monster who's taking orphans now could distract voters. A special team was assembled to quietly and discreetly get to the bottom of this mystery. For some time,there wasn't a single sighting of the thing. Unfortunately for me, I'd have the displeasure of breaking that streak one rainy night. I received a robbery in progress over the radio while patrolling the streets and figured this could be a good opportunity as any to maybe find out if the bat was real.

As I arrived at a local Bodega, two armed suspects jumped into a getaway vehicle and sped away from the scene. I initiated pursuit and advised the situation over the radio. As I started to gain on them,they began shooting at me. Thankfully, they were as shitty shots as they were making life choices. As I was about to go in for the PIT maneuver, something landed right on the top of the suspects car. 

If I wasnâ€™t looking right at it, I wouldn't have fucking believed it. There was a massive creature with even bigger wings on top of that car. It had fur as black as the night, and thanks to a perfectly timed lighting bolt, I was able to make out a hideos grin adorning a nightmarish face. The bat grabbed hold of the car roof and began flapping its mighty wings. It was trying to fly away with the car. 

It got maybe 10 feet into the air with the car when it just dropped it on its head. I stopped my car a few feet from the wreck and considered driving away immediately.  "All units...this is James...I'm gonna need an ambulance on my location... we got a confirmed bat sighting." I was able to keep my bearings and do my job. 

I exited my vehicle as the rain died down and safely made my way towards the wreck, keeping an eye on the sky in case the bat came back down for round two. As I made it towards the driver's seat on the flipped vehicle, both suspects had been crushed to death on impact. Blood and chunks of humans were oozing out of the bent metal. After backup arrived on the scene and all the paperwork was handled, forensics were able to identify a foreign object left by the bat at the scene of the crime: a claw.

The blood that was able to be recovered from that claw was analyzed at the lab. Many questions came from the results of the blood analysis, but 2 answers came along with them: A name and address. We managed to track down a suspect to an address in the outskirts of the city. Not really a residence, but a run-down automobile repair shop. Running the shop was Al, a man too old to still be working but too broke to do anything else. 

Most active cops were dispatched to the workshop alongside a swat team. Al was placed under custody while the building was searched.  "Where is he? " I interrogated Al while the swat team cleared the rest of the building.  "We know he's here, and we know what he is. You can help us stop this monster." 
 
"You shouldn't speak that way of Bruce...he can't help it...he's been special ever since he fell in that cave when he was a boy." Al sounded like he was trying to be empathetic, but under that thin layer of love I could hear, he was scared shitless. "He wasn't the same since...he can't be held responsible... not even for what he did to his parents..." He was about to continue when a voice joined in the conversation. 

"That's enough, Al. Why don't you go feed the children? They seem to be taking well to their...gift." A man came into the room in the direction swat went to clear the building. The man was drying his blood-soaked hands with a cloth. Al looked terrified for a split second but got up and followed the man's orders. "Your friends won't be joining us, captain. Now I believe you've been looking for me? 

The man standing in front of me was somehow terrifying. He was soft-spoken and seemed completely in control of the situation he was in. Several officers surrounded him and tried to put him in custody... but the man was able to resist ten other men trying to dog pile him. Bruce began to violently convulse, painfully, and disgustingly transforming into the same impossible creature we've been hunting for month's. 

 The pile of officers exploded all over the room,some getting back up and immediately opening fire on the nightmare creature in front of them, some landing bad and breaking bones. The bat was able to rip through a room of highly trained marskmen in a matter of seconds, using his mighty wings to cut through men like a knife through hot butter. During this carnage, I was able to slip by the corridor where the swat team and bruce had come from. I wouldn't be able to take on the bat head on, so I bought myself some time to try and think of something. The corridor was littered with the devastated bodies of the swat team, not one of them complete or not turned into a pile of minced meat.

As I reached what looked like Al's office, I could hear the gunfire had died down and knew the bat would be on me any second now. I noticed Al was nowhere in the room or the children Bruce mentioned. in the corner by a bookcase,there was a secret door still opened all the way. I carefully entered the doorway to a badly illuminated staircase. The stairs were slippery, and I ended up falling what felt like flights of stairs. 

Once I landed on my back, everything was pitch black,for a few moments I wondered if I was dead but the pain all over my body from the fall assured me I was still alive for the time being. In the darkness, I could hear a weak stream of water and a terrifying wet slobering noise. I managed to pull out my flashlight from my belt and saw what was making the noise. The stairs were slippery because there was a trail of fresh blood leading from them to several feet in front of me. Al was being eaten  by what I could only assume were the three missing orphans. 

Bruce had done something to them. They were no longer human but weren't quite giant bat monsters yet. They were crouched over Al's corpse, mostly eating his intestines at the moment, luckily too busy to bother with me...yet. suddenly, they retreated to somewhere in the darkness in fear. "I fell into a cave just like this one when I was a boy. In it, I found a dying god. It gave me the gift to turn into the bat." I pulled out my gun and pointed my flashlight to every corner of the cave to find where the demonic voice was coming from. 

Some pebbles fell from the cave ceiling,from it was hanging the giant bat. It glided down,crushing the ground beneath its immense weight. It lunged at me with impossible speed, and I felt a sharp pain in my forearm. My weapon discharged hitting the ceiling, making a sharp stalagmite dislodge and impale the bat in the head. This staggered the beast long enough for me to fire a few more rounds into the ceiling, making more sharp rocks fall and impale the Bat.

The creature transformed back into a man as he quickly bled out. I managed to walk back up the stairs and out of the cave with my life. When I exited the building, additional reinforcements and ambulances were arriving on the scene. It was great timing, too, because Bruce had bitten down on my forearm... and I wasn't feeling too good...
