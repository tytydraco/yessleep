Growing up I had a very normal childhood, nothing out of the ordinary. I grew up in a small town down in the South and always hung out with my neighborhood friends. The town I lived in was quiet, except for the occasional get together on weekends and fish fry's on Sundays, even then those parties are pretty tame. 

Me and my friends felt like we owned the town, everyone who lived there knew us by name. I could always count on them growing up if I needed anything. We did everything together whether it was running to the local snowball stand, lighting fireworks out in the woods, hunting animals and shooting guns, or fishing the ponds near by our homes. 

We used to roam our small town on our bikes and ride looking for our next adventure. We even rode under the moonlight until the cops told us to go home because of curfew. We used to play around and had a lot of fun "roughhousing" each other as my parents called it but my Mom was always super worried and over protective of me. 

My best friend and the ring leader of our group was Adam.  He lived 3 houses down from me and we grew up together for years. He was like an older brother to me and he was always ready to hangout all I had to do was say the word and we were off.  One day we got back from riding on the back roads by the train tracks. 

We were walking in my parent's house and he thought it would be funny to trip me. I fell flat on my face. Looking back on this I used to think it was hilarious back then but now things are different. My mom was cooking super and saw Adam trip me, she lost it. 

I've never seen my mom act this way before, she yelled at him from the top of her lungs and shoved him back into the wall. "Why the hell would you do that! Do you know what could've happened if he... if he would've hurt himself. Get out of my house your mother will be hearing from me!" I never understood why she reacted this way, but now I know and I'm going to die. 


Part 2:


Two weeks had past since I've seen Adam. I really think my Mom put the fear of God in him that day he had no idea what the issue was, we always messed with each other and it was never an issue but something was different this time. 

I finally called him on our home phone and his Mom answered. "Hello...Oh Jack how are you" I asked to speak to Adam but she said he wasn't feeling too good and she would let him know I called. I wonder if what happened with my Mom is making him worried. Adam was never sick ever, he has had a perfect attendance since kindergarten. 

He always got that dumb award the school would give at the end of the year for perfect attendance. Don't worry we always called him a nerd for it, just couldn't help ourselves. I figured I'd give him some more space and maybe he would be ready to hangout next weekend. 

Wednesday rolled around and Adam didn't show up for school. Me, Nick, and Tommy were talking about it at lunch it was so weird not having Adam eat with us making us laugh until milk shot out of our noses.

 "Do you think he has the flu" 
"Yeah probably or maybe he pulled a muscle from jerking off too much"
"Maybe his Dick fell off and he had to get it sowed back on"
"Come on dude be serious you think something is wrong with him what if he never comes back to school" 
"You sound like a bitch he's been gone 1 day dude don't worry your boyfriend will be back soon"
"Shut up he isn't my boyfriend and yeah he probably just has a stomach bug or maybe he wanted to play hooky"

The day came to an end and I got dropped off at home and got off the bus. My Mom was waiting for me at the door. When I was walking I opened the fence, when I went to turn to walk forward I tripped and hit my knee on the ground. My mom screamed and freaked out acting like I just got shot. She picked me up crying and brought me inside. She looked at my knee and looked horrified. 

"It's just a scratch mom it's fine." "No no no you don't understand this is bad let me clean it up." She cleaned up my knee with peroxide and told me something that looking back still haunts me to this day. 

"It will heal but it will scab up...whatever you do, do NOT pick at the scab or you will die." Those words sent shivers down my spine and made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I always thought she was
exaggerating she was always dramatic and sheltering me. I didn't get much sleep that night trying to figure out how a small scratch that will heal over time can kill me. 


Part 3:


Adam finally came back to school he was out for two weeks and just said he wasn't feeling good and was sick and left it at that. My knee started healing up and sure as shit it's scabbing up. I couldn't stop thinking about what my mom said to me. Would I really die?Like bleed out or like rip all my skin off. Maybe it would get infected and then fall off? But then how would I die people live normal lives without limbs it's not uncommon. 

The longer I thought about it the more it made my head hurt. I talked to Adam about what she had said. "Dude your Mom is crazy. She freaked out the other day and I got my ass lit up by my old man when I got home, you ain't going to die it's a scab it goes away." "I know I'm sorry about that by the way, but I don't get why she said that to me it just doesn't make any sense." 

"Yeah of course it doesn't she's just trying to freak you out she worries about everything, remember when she was on the phone with the cops filling a missing persons report because you got home 5 minutes late." "Okay okay I get it she does over exaggerate a little bit." We continued to talk and I caught him up on school drama he missed when he was gone. School ended and I finally got home and went to play video games in my room. 

I started getting this itching sensation on my knee and I went to scratch, but I remembered what my Mom had said. There's no way I would die right? It's just a small scab. But my fear got the best of me and I avoided it for as long as I could but it started to become unbearable. So I finally gave in, I scratched it. 

Nothing happened at first and everything was fine. It started to bleed a little bit and the scab was starting to lift up on the edge where it was healing.  Five minutes had passed and it started itching more, it felt like I had a bug crawling on my leg. I looked down and saw it. The scab was moving. 


Part 4:


I stayed up all night watching my knee. I felt like I was going crazy, was I just imagining this or was it actually moving? I couldn't tell I was so tired I couldn't stay up any longer and I ended up falling asleep on the chair in my room. 

The smell of biscuits and bacon filled my nose and I opened my eyes. The rays of sun were shinning through my blinds reflecting on my mirror on my dresser. It was morning. I immediately started to panic and looked down at my knee. It was not moving. I had the biggest feeling of relief it felt like all the pressure of the world lifted off my shoulders, but I noticed something off. It was bigger. 

Panic immediately flooded my mind like a dam breaking. "How is this even possible I barely scratched it, isn't it supposed to shrink?" I have no idea what to do or how to explain the feeling. It was sore but it constantly felt like a spider or fly was landing on the scab and only that one spot. It was driving me nuts. I put some Benadryl cream on it and went on about my business trying to ignore the feeling. 

My Mom cooked breakfast every Saturday for me and my Dad. I made myself a plate and sat at the table next to him. "So where y'all running off to today?" "Um... we haven't decided yet me and Adam were talking about going to Clayton's Pond and going fish." "Sounds like fun make sure you take my cooler with you in case y'all catch we can have a fish fry tonight if yall do good, I was planning on getting some shrimp today from the store." 

"Yes totally I'll let Adam know but can I take your pole. I broke mine and haven't fixed it yet." "Yeah that's fine but don't break mine too or lose it." I promised him everything would be fine and I'll take care of his stuff. I finished eating my breakfast packed up a cooler with bungie cords on my bike and grabbed my old man's pole. 

He had a rod his Dad gave him when he was a kid and my old man called it his lucky pole. I decided to take that one hoping it would give us some luck. I started peddling my bike out the garage and I could see Adam already waiting for me rod in hand smiling ear to ear. 


Part 5:


I helped Adam finish loading up his bike, he was bringing his tackle box since I had the cooler this time. "So your Dad wants to do a fish fry tonight?" "Yeah so let's go to the honey hole so we can try and catch a limit." 

"Sounds good to me but don't forget your bubble wrap you might get poked by a thorn and we'll have to cut off your legs." "Shut up asshole." He laughed as he started peddling off with a shit eating grin on his face. 

Clayton's pond was about a ten minute bike ride from our homes, but the brush gets so thick that we have to walk another 15 minutes to get to our spot. We finally made it to our secret fishing spot most people don't go to. The fish pile up in this one spot in the pond and only a few kids in the neighborhood knew about it. You could dip your line in the water and the fish would still bite it. 

We started fishing and we were doing good. After about two hours we were closing in on our limit. I moved over a little bit to try and get a better cast and when I threw my line out I snagged a branch. "Nice job dude that's the biggest one you caught all day." "Shut up and help me get it off." "Should've brought my camera this is the biggest catch of your life." 

Finally Adam decided to stop being an ass and come help me get it off the branch. He started climbing the tree to try and get the lure off, we didn't have much left in the tackle box and we sure didn't have enough money to buy more. He started working his way closer and snap, the branch broke. Adam fell in the water getting pinned by the giant branch that broke off. 

I immediately dropped the rod and jumped in the water to try and move it off of him. I could feel the panic, his arms were thrashing around and I could hear his faint screaming under the water. I finally was able to pull him out. His shoe had got caught on the branch and was still pinned in the water. 

"Jesus Christ dude are you okay are you hurt?" "No I'm fine holy shit that was scary." "Are you sure you're okay dude you look shook up." "Yeah man I'm good just wish I didn't lose my damn shoe my people are going to be pissed." He started getting his belongings back together and we decided it was best to leave while we were ahead since we already had a good bit of fish in the cooler. 

When I went back to grab my rod, it was gone. My Dads favorite rod is gone and got pulled in the water when the branch fell down. "Oh shit dude what am I going to do my Dad is going to kill me!" "Relax man it probably didn't get far we can come back and look for it will be okay." We never got that rod back. We got everything packed up and started to walk back to our bikes. "Hey Jack you good?" "Yeah why?" "Your knee is bleeding." The scab fell off. 


Part 6:


We ended up having a big fish fry and some of the neighbors came over and ate. My dad was pissed about the rod but he wasn't as mad as I thought he would be. He said it's just a pole and he can go and buy another one, but I could tell he was upset that it was gone. It was meaningful to him and had sentimental value. When everyone was eating me and Adam came up with a plan to sneak out tonight and head back to the spot to try and get the rod back. 

I was so focused on helping my dad cook and worried about his reaction about the rod that I almost forgot about my scab. The second I got back I ran to the bathroom and cleaned it with peroxide and tried to cover it with a bandaid. The scab has now grown to the size of a baseball on my knee. Bandaids weren't going to cut it anymore. I started panicking and started looking through all the drawers in the bathroom. I finally found some medical wrap stuff and just covered it with that. 

I didn't want my mom to freak out so I just made up some bullshit story and said I wrapped it before went fishing to avoid bacteria getting in it. She bought it and seemed relieved at the time. I also realized she was wrong. Yeah the wound got bigger but the scab came off and I'm still breathing. She was making me worried for nothing and I'm perfectly fine. 

Adam was right and there was no need to panic at all. Everyone ate their meal and started heading home after putting back beers with my old man telling stories of their glory days. My mom finally shut that down and one by one they started heading home. Midnight rolled around and it was time for me and Adam to make our move. 


Part 7:


I got dressed and packed my backpack grabbing my flashlight and was ready to go. I lifted up my window and made my way out the house. Adam was on his bike ready to go. We ended up taking a back way to get to the path for our secret spot to avoid being seen by neighbors or cops. 

The last thing I need right now is to be caught past curfew. "You really think we will be able to find it?" "Yeah it couldn't have gone far I never took the lure off so it's still attached to the branch." I started getting an eerie feeling listening to the loud chips of the crickets and the sound of the southern marsh, the sound of the wildlife flooded my ears. 

We started walking to the honey hole but I started getting a weird feeling. I don't know if I was anxious about sneaking out or the thought of being caught by my parents but I had an uneasy feeling. I finally noticed it. As we were walking cracking jokes, it went from overwhelming loud to complete dead silence. My heart dropped to my stomach I felt sick. 

"What's wrong?" "It's completely quiet it was loud the whole way here and now I can't even hear the leaves blowing in the trees." "What are you a hippie now connecting with nature?" "Come on flower power we're almost there." 

Adam brushed me off but I could tell he had the same uneasy feeling I had in that moment. The realization that the only sound out here was us. We finally made it to the spot and started shinning our flashlights looking for the branch. "Hey look I think that's it." "Yeah it looks like it I can kinda see the lure still on the end of it." 

The gold on the lure shimmered with reflection of the light like we had just found buried treasure. We started inching our way in the water to grab the lure, but then we heard the loud snap of a stick cracking nearby and we froze with fear. We were not alone. 


Part 8:


You could feel it in the air. Something was watching us. "What the fuck was that?" "I have no idea maybe a dog?" "Let's just hurry and get the rod and get the fuck out of here" 

Adam finally  reached the lure and started pulling the fishing line and he could feel the weight of the rod on the other end. I kept scanning the tree line the fear in my body was immense. I slowly started scanning with my flashlight and then I saw something move. 

"Adam did you get the rod yet I think I see something." "Not yet I almost got it what do you see?" "I see...me." I was staring into the eyes of myself on the bank, but it wasn't me it was a grotesque mass of reddish brown flesh. It looked like an unfinished version of me and you could visibly see the mass pulsing and growing ligaments and muscle. 

There was a layer of slime covered the figure all over. And spots here flesh was trying to fill in as if it was trying to heal. Fear had over taken me and my fight or flight kicked in. It started moving towards us. "What the fuck is that thing?" "We need to go now fuck the rod!" Adam let go of the line and we started running immediately. 

This thing was fast, abnormally fast. The dead silence was now filled with heavy breathing and shaking panic in our voices. "Hurry we need to get to the bikes!" "I can hear it it's getting closer!" Adam was right it was gaining on us. I was too terrified to turn around and see how close it was to getting us but Adam's curiosity and fear got the best of him and he glanced back. 

I heard him hit the ground with so much force he knocked the wind out of himself. He tripped over a cypress knee. I stopped running to help him but the creature was already on top of his chest pinning him to the ground. "Jack help m..." I watched this mimic of human deformity rip out my best friends throat before he could get the words out. 

The sound of blood and wet tearing flesh was replaying in my head like a broken record. Adam is dead and this beast has his sights set on me. Without thinking I started running again tears running down my face. I had no time to process what the hell that thing was or what just happened I had to go. I finally made it to my bike before it could reach me but it didn't let up. I need to get help. 


Part 9: 


I have never been so physically and mentally drained in my life the horror I witnessed wouldn't leave my mind. I raced back to my house and this creature was still not far behind. 

I made it to my home and slammed my window open and shut it so hard the glass cracked. I went to my parent's room to find some sort of comfort and protection. 

"Mom Dad wake up please this thing is going to kill me Adam's dead!" "What the hell are you talking about why are you awake?" "What do you mean Adam's dead Jack what are you talking about?" "We went to go get the fishing rod back because I knew you were upset about it and this thing attacked us it killed Adam!" "Show me your knee." 

"What?" 

"Show me your goddamn knee now!" I removed the wrap I had put on it completed dumbfounded by my Moms request. The look of heartbreak filled her eyes. 

"I warned you..." "Mom what's the big deal you're not even listening to me!" "No...you didn't listen to me..." She grabbed me by my shirt and threw me out of her room slammed the door in my face and I could hear her and my Dad crying. 

They locked the door. "Mom what the hell are y'all doing help me please!" I heard the front door slam open. It's in the house. I immediately got into our bathroom and locked the door. I started trying to open up the tiny window so I could squeeze through. My heavy and frantic breathing came to a screeching halt. It's outside the door. 

I started pulling myself through the window and the doorknob started turning. This thing was pounding on the door so hard to get in the hinges started to shake loose. Right when the door slammed open I was out the window. I jumped over the chain link fence and ran like hell. I was alone and I had no one to turn to. 


Part:10


Everything up to this point was about 4 years ago. I never knew what happened to my parents. Honestly I don't want to know. That night they abandoned me when I needed them. I have been trying to piece everything together for years. I've always been on the run like I was on the FBI most wanted list. 

I made my way to a bus station that night after gaining some distance and time. I couldn't go back, my own family turned their backs on me and my best friend is dead. I started motel hoping trying to collect money any way I can. I robbed 3 gas stations just this week so I can have a bed to sleep on. 

I've lived in fear for the longest time and I still don't understand what I had seen that night. A mockery of me. It was made up of scabs. This whole thing felt like a nightmare that never ends I wish I had listened to my Mom that day when she gave me that warning. 

She was right. I picked the scab and I'm going to die. This is my final message. My only way out is by my own hands I can't keep doing this. If you were warned then you should listen and follow what you were told. I have to go now someone is at my door...
