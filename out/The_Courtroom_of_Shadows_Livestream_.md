Hi. Im not really sure how to start this as I'm not that great of a story teller. But I guess the best place to start is with me. I'm a nobody who spends way too much time on the internet. Specifically the dark web. Not to do anything nefarious. Just general curiosity of the human experience's darker underbelly in cyber form. I've read the description of different drugs that are "up and coming". Most of which with ridiculous names like "fufu" and "Smilewarm". I've seen the credentials of hitmen for hire. Even a few with photos of people I recognized from my other obsession: True Crime mysteries. It definitely dampers your hope a bit knowing there is a case you've listened to or read where the offender will never see justice simply because they were a professional hired by someone through the dark web. 

I suppose that's how I ended up in the Court of Shadows livestream viewer numbers. I don't exactly remember where or how I discovered them. Just one day, I found myself enthralled with their content. 

Let me explain exactly what this livestream is. You see when you open their site, which changes URLs extremely frequently, you are greated by: a red and black background, the Letters COS at the top in some sort of Death metal album cover font, and a robed figure in a mask that I can only compare to Darth Vader's helmet if it were designed by the CIA or something. Yes. I'm a nerd. Sue me.

Anyway, if the mask's eyes are glowing, it means "court is in session". When you click on one of the eyes, you are sent to a new url and are greeted by a single video screen. In this video screen sits a court room. A very dark, barely lit courtroom, but small tells let you know it was an authentic building built by some government. All of it's emblems hidden behind a flag with the same mask as their website. And sitting in the Judges chair is that robed and masked individual from the websites opening page. My guess is this guy, or girl, is the ring leader of this whole operation. Or possibly just a face for it. If you can call a mask the face of something. 

There are multiple cameras the live stream will jump between. One facing in to the empty jury section. One that faces the lawyers tables. And then the last one. The last one is a camera in a room lit by one single light. In that room sits a person. A group of people in armor stand around him. Sometimes 4. Sometimes 8. But never less than 2 on either side of them. The armor looks military in design.. I guess. I mean it kinda looks like someone made an iron man suit and then stripped away any of the bells and whistles. Like armor of a knight if it was modernized to today's standards. 

The person sat is almost always in a bad way. I'm guessing they probably put up a fight prior to being brought into their "custody" . There have been a couple times where their face was unrecognizable to the photo they show during the "trial". I use both those terms lightly as obviously this isn't a sanctioned court procedure. Kidnapping and Judgement are the better terms I'm sure, but for the sake of telling it how it is presented, I'll use the terms they use for it. 

 After they show you the person in custody. The judge in the mask speaks. I can definitely see why these guys haven't been caught, if anyone is even looking to catch them. Because the masked figures voice is distorted. Almost robotic. Like if you took the original Siri voice, deepened the pitch and added some sort of Max Headroom style Lag to it. I'm probably dating myself with that reference, but I'm sure most of you internet junkies like myself know what I mean. 

The voice is very careful about what it says. At the start, when all these people in the courtroom sit, after the Judge sits, they begin by the Judge saying facts about the person in custody. Name. Age. DOB. Height. Weight. Place of Origin. Current Address/residents. None of which is ever spoken with any inflation or deflation of tone. It's as if the judge has absolutely 0 feelings about the accused in custody. Just cold. Hard. Facts. 

They then go into what the person is accused of. Like a real court case I presume. Except the accusations aren't always illegal. Immoral? Absolutely. No one, so far, placed in that chair has ever been a KIND person. But not always a criminal either. Now sure. There have been a few that really were criminals. Hell there was even one that had already been convicted in a real court and was residing in a prison prior to being taken by these people. Makes you wonder just who these guys are and what kind of power they may have in society. 

An almost surefire accusation for whoever is in the chair is "lack of empathy". They will say "10 counts: lack of empathy" or "200 counts" yadda yadda. Not a crime. But to these people, it most certainly is a punishable offense. 

After the accusations are laid out on the table. A text box will appear under the video feed along with a number. My best guess is that number is how many questions those in attendance of the live stream get to ask regarding the case. This number varies. I've never seen one higher than 100. These questions are then presented by 2 of the masked figures, one on each side of the lawyer benches. The ones in favor of the accused come from the left side of the court room. Those opposed come from the right. 

When you type a question into the text box. A red button and a blue button appear below the screen. Yes. I have submitted a few questions myself. Just to see if I was correct. The ones in red is for the opposition. Blue, for the accused. For an insane group, these guys are seriously well organized. 

These questions can go on for hours. Sometimes it's only a few minutes. Each question is then responded to with a One word response from the judge. "Negative" or "Affirmative". No emotion. Just fact. Depending on the question, there is sometimes "exhibits" played on the sceen as proof. 

I'll give an example: the last one I watched involved a man who worked for CPS. He had been accused of lack of empathy, child abuse and purposeful neglect. The question was asked "did he physically harm any children in his care?" To which the Judge Spoke: "Negative." I remember thinking "well that's it then. How can they convict him if that is true?" It was obvious I wasn't the only one to have this line of questioning cause the next blue text on screen was "can he then be guilty of the crime if that is true?" 

As the text faded from the screen. The judge spoke again: "consider exhibits G through K" and the screen became security footage with "exhibit G" above it. This security footage was definitely not something placed by the building or anyone associated with the accused. It's two angles were from above his desk and the other to the side of him. In this video it showed the accused reviewing Adoption papers. At least 10 sets. Each one he either Stamped "DENIED" in big letters on them, or through them into the trashcan beside his desk. Until he got to the last one. This one he signed, stapped "APPROVED" and put it into a file folder in one of the desk drawers. 

After that was finished, the screen changed again saying "Exhibit H." And the same piece of paper was now readable on screen. The approved sheet was that of a foster family the names were blacked out but the address was not. Then half the screen brought up a news article. The News Article read "Foster Parents arrested for forcing foster kids to transport drugs" and then the screen went further into the story, showing that the Address matched that of the piece of paper the accused had stamped as "approved". 

So you are probably thinking "well ok. That doesn't mean he knew these Foster parents were doing this to their children." Which yet again, you share a thought process with the group, as the next question asked "did the accused set up the drug ring?" To which the Judge answered "Negative". Then the next question was "did he benefit from the drug ring in any way" and the judge Says "affirmative" showing a video of the accused, again through camera footage that was obviously not something the accused knew was being captured, meeting with the foster parents from the news story. The "Father" was wealthy and offered many gifts and things to the accused. Never explicitly "bribing" the guy but definitely buttering him up to which, as I'm sure anyone would in that position when it seems like there isn't a catch, he accepted. If anything, the guy was manipulated into doing what he did. 

But that's the opinion of one "Juror" which is me. I think I forgot to mention, that is what us viewers are called. You see, at the end of the trial. The judge stands up and says "the facts have been provided. Jurors, you may decide." And then the screen switches to a oddly well detailed rendering of 2 buttons. A Red one that reads "GUILTY" and a blue one that reads "NOT GUILTY". Above the button is a timer that reminds me of the show 24, counting down from 30 minutes. To the side of the buttons is a stack of papers that read "EVIDENCE". If you click on them, they have all the exhibits and videos provided in the courtroom in case you need a refresher. Like I said, they may be creepy but fuckin organized. 

So you cast your vote. Guilty or Not Guilty. Wait long enough and you are given the option to "abstain" which apparently just means you don't want your vote counted in either one. Which is what I do most of the time. I mean it's not like I came here to participate. I just wanted to witness. 

But the guy working for CPS? Something in me got curious. All the ones I had seen prior to his were small minor things or just things that I can't imagine needing more punishment than is already given to them. A person selling nicotine to underage kids, a guy whose friend was drunk and he let him drive home, hell even the one they took from a prison was in there for fighting someone causing them to hit their head and go blind. Which sounds bad I know, but they had videos of this dude crying about it in his cell. Not about being in jail, but feeling like complete shit for doing that to another human being. That alone I think deserves some recognition I think. 

But this guy. I just wanted to know what kind of punishment they would dish out. What would they do to someone found guilty. So I clicked the Red button. They disappeared from my screen, leaving only the timer. Which, for any of you brave enough to try this yourself, the waiting is insufferable. You wonder if you did something wrong. Then you think about how many others are watching. You wonder how many of them will say the same thing you did. And then you psych yourself out thinking "it'll be a massive difference in either way. So I either see what happens or I Don't. Either way my vote wouldn't have changed it." 

Until it does. When the timer finished on the CPS guys case. The screen lit up. 13 NOT GUILTY. 14 GUILTY. One. Vote. Difference. 

A pit formed in my stomach a little bit. What had I done? What would they do to him?
