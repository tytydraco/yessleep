I’ve always been a little introverted, especially when it comes to large gatherings and public places. The mindless chatter often drowning me out or the stampede of bodies drags me along, like a fallen leaf to the wind.



My commute to work takes me through the underground and as the unthinking current of bodies shuffles along, I’m often whisked away with little resistance.



That crisp morning, however, brought with it something different that day. The crowds ignored me as they always had, yet I was on edge. As my regular path was set out for me and I followed mindlessly, the distinct feeling of eyes stalking my traversal of those dim dirty tunnels pervade in my mind

.

It was a typical Monday in November, hot puffs of air bellowing from between the fibers of my scarf as I shrugged into my padded jacket. The crowds shambled along as I was guided on autopilot to platform 4B.



Waiting the couple of minutes for the rusted metal tube to come to a halt with a screech, I stood silently. All eyes from its departing inhabitants either quickly scanned the overhanging signs for their next platform or the coveted ‘exit’ sign.



Unlike the infinitesimal number of times I’d been in this position, all the hairs on the back of my neck stood to attention. For maybe the first time, eyes were on me. Scanning my immediate surroundings, I saw nothing, but streams of commuters on their daily march. Swiveling again, my mind was momentarily put at ease until my eyes locked with a man’s.



Laying in a small corner, wedged halfway between a bench and vending machine was an older man. He looked on the verge of death as blood pooled on the cold stone floor below his abdomen.



His eyes never wavered, as they stared deeply into my own. Something about them seemed relieved yet sorrowful, as if he was happy to see me, but whatever he needed was something he’d not wish on another soul.



His slowly closing eyes, beckoned me over and regardless of how much I tried to resist, my legs turned and pushed me onwards.



Stopping around a meter away, I knelt as he coughed a raspy, torn lung. With his evidently only working appendage, he shoved across a worn black backpack and withered out his final words.



“Its watching … no matter the cost, keep it safe.”  



Immediately as the words left his lips, his body slumped back as the task was clearly fulfilled and the torch was passed. As he had in life, his now motionless body drew no attention from the onrushing traffic as the scene was lost to time, with me its only preserver.



Opening the small black backpack, I expected some critical experimental device or even something of wildly high value. Though sitting comfortably in its central pocket was a book and a box.



The dark, aged leather book had seemingly been used repeatedly over a large span of time, as pages fell from it the moment I pulled it from the pack. Many drawings, tables and a lot of annotations littered each page, yet they all seemed to be in a variety of styles and languages.



Identically, the chipped small wooden box, which now sat in my hand was visibly damaged. Grooves and divots lined its outer shell depicting a stint of violent and primal desperation to acquire its innermost secret.



Equally the box was bound by a thick ring-mail chain, that covered its circumference in an ‘X’ shape. Its scratched and bent lock, damaged by a considerable amount of force, yet still held on.



Examining my newfound ‘treasures’, a sudden piercing feeling permeated my mind. Unlike the mans before, malicious eyes burned into the side of my head. Through the slowly dispersing crowds of pedestrians my eyes caught the subtle shape of a man. He stood motionless, without blinking, as his eyes were locked on the items in my hand.



Shifting from the box to the old man and then back at me, his oddly yellow eyes met mine. Something about them unsettled me and didn’t fit his proportions. They only vaguely looked human, with an abnormally large pupil and thin iris.



Breaking me from the staring contest I was losing, a loud whistle signified the arrival of the next train, in which I needed to board. As I filtered through the departing pedestrians, I would occasionally look back towards the man. However, every time he had inched closer. Every double-take his eyes seemed larger and wider, though his body showed no sign of movement.



Equally, no-one else seemed to even notice his presence. Just like myself, he was an object of unimportance to them, as flurries of commuters rushed by him.



The final time I looked back, just as I boarded, he was only a car length from me. The relief I felt as I planted myself in an empty seat, to see him still standing on the platform looking up at me. With a heavy sigh, I slumped down in my chair and raised my hand to wipe the droplets of sweat from my brow.



In the four or five milliseconds it took to raise my hand, the image of his eyes was burned into my mind. With an inhuman snap and jerk of his head in the direction of the deceased man, he blinked without eyelids. The shear presence of movement unsettled me, though the way his eyes folded in half from right to left was the way something with no prior knowledge would attempt to emulate a blinking motion.



For the rest of the journey, I tried to decipher the book and push out that horrible image from my brain. Much of the information littering the tattered pages was extremely hard to make out. Sketches and detailed anatomical drawings scattered the book, each seemingly working off the previous sections. The more I read, the more pieces of the puzzle fit into place.



For the rest of that workday, I was enthralled by the book and all its machinations. Each section, a new authors detailed notes, on everything they could gleam from the limited information left and what they could physically ascertain.



Outside on the street, on the tube home and at the supermarket, whenever there were crowds, he would be watching. Motionless, but transfixed. Those deep stained eyes evaluated me as I did the book.



As I sat at my desk, late that evening I had all the relevant information on ‘it’, what my role entailed and the closing window of time I had with these items. I had a monumental task to carry out and I would make sure that whatever happened, the box would be kept safe. Funnily, almost as if the book itself knew I was ready, the next page I turned left a blank set of pages, with my full name sitting in the top left corner.

My name is Emily, and this is as much information as I can retrieve from the torn pages, headed with my brother’s name.



He’d disappeared for a couple of days, with no-one hearing a word from him, until yesterday. After hearing a couple of soft repeated knocks in that melodious manner we used to as kids, I opened my front door.



Lying in a mess of lacerations and bruises was Jake. His torn damaged body, clinging to the dying embers of life. As his eyes rose and met my own, he said his final words and pushed a dirty backpack in my direction before succumbing to his injuries.



Obviously, I called the ambulance, but it was too late. He merely needed to know I had them before passing on and now I know why.



It’s my turn, I have my task, and I must ensure it is fulfilled.



If you’re reading this then I’m sorry Claire. Time is fleeting and you undoubtedly understand what’s next. Hopefully I’ve given you enough and this endless chain can be broken. Just remember.



Its watching,

No matter the cost,

Keep the box safe.
