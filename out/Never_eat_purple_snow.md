Laugh away — I know you’re thinking of the old adage that one must never eat yellow snow. We all know the crude connotations behind that advisory. But what of *purple* snow?

In these dying days of winter, I hope frosty weather is behind us for a little while. I thought it might be wise to explain to all of you why you must never, under any circumstances, eat purple snow.

If your skin makes contact with even a single flake of the hellish contaminant, you face an unimaginable fate.

“Look at this funky shit,” Tyreese laughed.

My brother was proudly cradling a fluffy snowball — seemingly dyed purple — in his shivering, gloveless hand. Proud of his discovery, he triumphantly licked it.

“What the fuck is that?” I asked. “Drop it, Tyreese. You don’t know what you’re touching.”

“Relax, I’m fine! You telling me somebody pissed purple urine?” He laughed.

Before I could respond, Tyreese screamed. The purple ball pancaked outwards, gloving itself around my brother’s hand and worming its way up his arm. I ran over to him as he clutched at the tentacles of the living thing.

“Shit! It’s digging into me!” He cried.

“What do I do? What do I *do*?” I screeched.

“I… No… Get away from me,” Tyreese growled in a voice that wasn’t his own. “Don’t let it touch you.”

His bloodshot eyes locked onto mine, but I quickly realised they weren’t bloodshot at all — purple limbs were slinking across his pupils, attached to something that was growing within his body. My brother’s terrifying transformation only worsened from there.

His flesh developed the consistency of rubber. Slowly, but surely, Tyreese started to sink into the whiteness beneath him. I swiftly snapped a branch off a nearby tree and extended it for my brother to grab. But when he seized the twig to pull himself out of the quick-snow, his purple tentacles started to craftily coil themselves around the branch — they were spiralling towards me.

“No!” Tyreese snarled. “Let go of it!”

I yelled, releasing the branch and tumbling onto my back. Tyreese’s consistency had become that of gooey, flesh-coloured liquid. What remained of his body seeped out of his furry jacket and jeans, as it started to unify with the snow. My brother unleashed one final wail of excruciating agony as he liquified into a purple pool, staining the snow.

When the scream abated, his lips fell still — they were the final body parts to vanish into the purple pool, and Tyreese’s parting words were hauntingly serene.

“Oh… It’s beautiful, Jack. I think you should dip your toes in the pool.”

I fled and didn’t turn back. I told family, friends, and police officers that I’d lost my brother in the woods. He was never found. And I couldn’t see any purple remnants when I returned to the forest in the light of day.

I don’t know where my brother went, and I don’t know what claimed him. I *do* know never to eat purple snow. In fact, I simply stay indoors during the winter. And when snow starts to fall, I draw the curtains, just to be safe.

Sometimes, on particularly icy evenings, I am certain I hear my brother’s wispy voice, billowing against my window panes. It beckons me to venture into the snow.
