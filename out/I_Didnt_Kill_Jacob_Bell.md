What are you doing down here at the pier? Not a lot of people come down here, anymore, at least not at this time of night. Me? You know who I am, and that I’ve always come down here, felt safe enough to roam around here. Do you watch the news? The local news? Anyway, we should shake hands, make it formal.

Now that we are met let’s do some clerical work. As it will be expected from you to ask me the normal question that everyone here does, and as I will give you the same answer I have always given and will always give, it’s best for me to make this situation less awkward for the both of us. Me, wondering why you want to talk to me (or, listen, that is), and you, wondering if I did in fact kill Jacob Bell.

I did not kill Jacob Bell.

I did not kill him that day, that day that we both walked into the forest. I did not kill him there. I did not kill him in those trees, I did not kill him in my car, I did not kill him with my car. I did not kill him on my boat. I did not kill him, stuff him in a box, and make sure he wouldn’t float. He’s not in the river and he’s not in the sea, and his death didn’t come from the hands of someone like me.

I would not kill Jacob Bell.

Even if he was siphoning off everything in my life. Even though the money my ever-lonely Aunt left to me was the only thing propping up the bike rental shop that we had opened together, and even though the salary the business paid him was the only thing allowing Jacob to live in his odor-effusing studio apartment that perfectly towed the line of low-cost enough for someone like Jacob to be able to afford, and still high-cost enough to keep the truly deranged about-town roamers out of it and away from the landlord’s precious property value. Even if he somehow made me feel guilty for my life and my wealth. Even if I was working my full time job and pouring my economic output into the business he had somehow talked me into putting him in charge of. Even if my salary and inheritance was paying his salary. Even if he bragged at the bars he drank too much at that he ran a successful business. Even if he downplayed my involvement and my investment. Even if he fucked my wife and got her addicted to those pills that stole her soul. Even then.

I could not kill Jacob Bell.

If you’re really that interested, you certainly read the court documents. Didn’t you hear my attorney? I heard my attorney. I liked what he had to say about me. He said I ‘was a great friend to Jacob’. That’s right, stranger. If *you* treat our relationship just right, you’ll get that same great friend treatment that Jacob got, the same kind the attorney described. He said that I ‘saved Jacob from a never-ending spiral of homelessness, addiction, and failure’. He said that, without me, ‘Jacob would have died years ago, a forgotten soul of the street’. I liked the way he said that, because he made succumbing to forces of death while alone on the street sound so *pretty* and *soulful*. But, most importantly, he got my doctor, Dr. Anderson, to say the sweetest thing I’ve ever heard: ‘I performed that surgery on this man myself not more than two weeks prior to the date in question. Even if he could have, hell, even if he *tried* to move a body that weighed as much as Mr. Bell’s, he would not only have come immediately back to my office out of sheer pain, but the damage to his body would have been extremely noticeable. Just as he had originally come to me after enough people at his workplace mentioned that he seemed stiff, uncomfortable, and in pain, they certainly would have noticed even more this time’. That gave me an elation deep within my soul. Because finally someone else could take over my thoughts for me and say the thing that I, and you, already know: I couldn’t have killed Jacob Bell.

I could not kill Jacob Bell. Would not kill Jacob Bell. Did not kill Jacob Bell.

Why are you even here again, anyway? No one seems to come down to the pier around this time anymore. I used to wander down here any time insomnia gripped my mind and shook it like a violent magic-eight-ball enthusiast. In those times I met many late-night strangers, and like a true stranger, I never saw or spoke to them ever again afterward. I would walk up to someone and say hi, we’d shake hands like old-west outlaws, exchange some words, and then I would watch and wonder about them as they made their way into some dark corner of our town.

And then it seemed that people only ever wanted to know about what happened. They wanted to know what the trial was like, what it was like to be accused of murder. They felt entitled to attack me, to degrade me. They used me to make themselves feel better. They felt that that was all I was good for. They knew where I worked and got me fired from my job. ‘I can’t have impromptu murder-interviews taking place here’ Mrs. Ogilvie had told me. That was fair, to her. And I agree. But it wasn’t fair to me. Because I can’t control what other people come up to me for. I can only control what I do in retaliation.

And I didn’t kill Jacob Bell.

So, it was all very unfair. Specifically, unfair to me. To be given this treatment. To be treated only as something to be feared at a distance unless you were one of those types who fail to be intimidated by murderers and obsess over the mysteries of the macabre. I lost my job and wandered down to the pier to satiate my catatonically aimless free time. Occasional insomnia gone, I was now a full-blown insomniac. So I’m here at the pier, here right here wandering around most nights. Up and down the boardwalk sometimes, but always here by this pier. Like it’s my sun. Like it’s my God. Even if I left town I’d still be attached to it, I’d still be a satellite to it, maintaining my orbit no matter how far away I tried to get. Even if I invented a rocket and flew a million miles away and hid behind a big star, there’d still be a tiny piece of me, scientifically, attracted back to this pier. I can’t escape its gravity and I can’t escape its secrets. The pier owns me, and it wants me.

It became well known, you know, that I was here. Me, specifically, was here, typically starting two hours prior to midnight was when I began to roam, and I would roam until I tired or had found what I was looking for: something to help me sleep. Or, at least, that was the rumor. A rumor, I assumed, that got around, because suddenly my peaceful midnight was infested with the types of people who played paparazzi not with their cameras pointed at celebrities, but with their microphones and notepads pointed at someone normal thrust into an otherwise abnormal situation.

And if there’s one thing I definitely am, it’s normal. That’s something else I really liked hearing at my trial. ‘Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, this is just some guy. Some normal guy thrust into an abnormal situation. That’s all that we’ll find here no matter how much this prosecution attempts to dig and dig and dig and throw dirt into your face’. Yeah, I really liked that.

I’m assuming you’re not here for that? At least not primarily. I’m sure you’re at least a little bit curious about me but it must be repeated that I didn’t kill Jacob Bell. Most people aren’t interested nowadays, plus it’s always dark when I’m here, so I assume if you’re here you’re mostly curious and maybe just a wanderer yourself? It doesn’t matter. People don’t bother to ask me anymore and they certainly don’t come down to the pier these hours anymore. The pier is dangerous, you know? The rumors of my whereabouts about town were replaced by other rumors. The sea is very angry. Sometimes I think the sea is a God, too, but I’m not polytheistic. No. If there’s two Gods in my life one is going to have to kill the other. No matter, the sea is very angry, and the pier isn’t always the safest place to be. That’s just why I don’t really know why you’re here.

So I assume it’s because of Jacob Bell.

You want to know if I killed him, right? I didn’t. You know a lot of people don’t come down here anymore, or they at least don’t talk to me when they’re doing it and I don’t see them either. I hear them, though. There’s always someone whispering, whispering far off in the distance on the edges of my mind, so I know I’m not alone when I’m down here. You should know that I couldn’t have killed Jacob Bell. We were good friends, and I wouldn’t have killed him even if I hated him. I’d tell you to ask my wife, to ask her for a second opinion, but I’m sure you’re aware that she’s dead, too. Dead like Jacob. I *really* couldn’t have killed her, because I loved her in that plain way that’s simple and impossible to explain. I’m certain, even after the drugs and the affair, she’d still tell you that I couldn’t possibly, wouldn’t, didn’t kill Jacob. ‘It’s just not him’ I hear her saying in her not dead voice. Even Jacob, I bet he would tell you right up until the moment he was dead that there was simply no way that I could have killed him or anyone else. ‘Him? Ha! No way!’ I hear him saying. I hear him saying exactly that, and it rolls off the tongue. It comes to him as a thought so easily it could even be the very last thing he, Jacob Bell, thought before he died. Could be. I guess. Is that proof enough yet I didn’t kill him?

Because I couldn’t have killed him. There’s no way I could have killed anyone!

People used to ask me all kinds of questions. Usually we’d talk about what a nice night it was, and how the other was generally doing. That was before Jacob died and I had been accused of killing him, which you and I both know I didn’t do. The worst question was why I was up late walking around at night, which I of course was doing aimlessly and innocently. I told them that I had trouble sleeping. Which was true. Sometimes I’m in complete awe how some people can just sleep without pain and without worry. It must be such a gift. Such a place of leisure in this life of insanity of ours. That’s why I hated that question. But I liked the people, I always liked them a lot, because the night is lonely and so is insomnia.

So I definitely couldn’t have killed anyone. I know people always like to say that kind of thing about one another. First, they say I killed Jacob, then they get so paranoid about that that they think it’s highly likely I killed other people, too. That’s just the kind of thing people like to say, though. They said that in court, they said ‘Someone who commits these kinds of crimes is far more likely to both reoffend, and to have also committed crimes of a similar nature before’. I think they said that in court, they may have just said it on the news. You don’t watch the news, do you? At least not local to this town? I’m glad they said nice things about me in court, besides that at least, but I wish they’d say nicer things about me in the news. Mostly they say nothing. I wish they would say ‘We respect the results of this trial. Jacob Bell either ran away from the defendant and succumbed to the elements, or was killed by something else. But he was not killed by the defendant. And we certainly don’t insinuate any recent disappearances could be the work of some specific dangerous individual’. That would make me happy to hear. We all know it’s true. I couldn’t possibly be a killer.

I couldn’t have killed Jacob Bell.

That’s for sure. He succumbed to the will of the forest, as was my understanding. They never found the body. Jacob’s body. Funny how once someone is dead we say it’s ‘their body’ and not ‘them’. That should be proof enough that everyone believes in a soul of some kind.

Because we’re talking about it, would you like to know about when I last talked to Jacob? I’m sure you read the court records. I testified as to my last conversation with him before he became lost in the forest and I was accused of his murder. But I talked to him last week. We always have a similar version of the same conversation. I’m sure you’d like to hear it. It goes something like this.

‘Jacob, what are you doing here? Please, go away.’ That’s what I say.

‘Why did you kill me?’ That’s usually his first question.

‘I didn’t kill you, Jacob. Didn’t you see the trial?’ Almost always this is my response to that question.

‘You totally killed me, dude. First, I really thought I heard you grunt or something like that maybe a split second before everything went dark. Next thing I remember I’m in some strange void.’

‘Well I could have been fighting off killers, be they human, animal, weather-based, or otherwise. I blacked out, too, you know, Jacob. I testified to that at the trial. You didn’t confirm previously but I assume you watched the trial? At least you must have read about it.’

‘I know you killed me. I was always suspicious that you blamed me for Caitlyn’s death.’

‘You did kill her! She never had such an issue in her life before you entered it, entered ours. You got her addicted to those pills! That was the beginning of all her problems! You manipulated her!’ Usually I’m close to screaming when I say this. Sometimes I scream a little louder so that the people whispering nearby remember to not bother me with the bad questions anymore. Jacob’s words were very callous. I’m honestly not sure that I had heard these types of opinions coming from him while he was alive.

‘This ain’t high school. We all know the risks, and we’re well-watered adults at this age. I gave her pills when she wanted them, she did them if she chose to. That’s totally on her. As far as the affair, she was waiting for you at our store. You no-showed your own wife! She broke down in a terrible onslaught of tears, about how you’re gone for long periods of the night sometimes, she thinks you’re having an affair, you’ve become increasingly cold and distant blah, blah, blah, blah, you know, that kind of shit. I gave her pills to calm her down, which isn’t honestly unusual for me when it comes to hysterical people. The rest is, well, you know, it is what it is.’

‘Yeah, I know what happened. Honestly, Jacob, I wouldn’t kill you or Caitlyn over an affair. And over drugs? Maybe if you got her seriously addicted, and then if she ended up overdosing, as she did. Maybe then. But, truly, even then it seems like a stretch, like something I wouldn’t do.’

‘I thought the same thing. I always thought the same thing. In fact, it was one of the very last things that crossed my mind before I completely blacked out. I thought that you were just the nicest, most clean-cut guy I ever had the luck of crossing paths with. I know now that I was wrong. It seemed like I knew it for a long time before finally realizing it in those final seconds before I blacked out.’

‘That I wasn’t clean cut?’

‘I remember one of the few times we got drunk together. One of the few times we came down here at one of these bars they allow just outside a few blocks of the pier around here. We met that one girl, Sandy. I never saw you act so different. I mean, you were *smooth*. It was like watching a pro at work. I knew some guys were charismatic, but this was next level, and it was a shock coming from you. Well, I remembered that but I didn’t think too much more of it, just thought it was fun about you.’

Usually I don’t stop to interrupt him, here. I know where this is going. He always brings this up. I think he remembers her because of her name. Sandy. He was drunk half the time I knew him, and Sandy was not the first stranger I flirted with around him. I got too drunk around him, and more than a few times than he remembers. I wanted to show off, to show how I did have the slight twinkle of a secret power. That was before he and my wife. Well, anyway, he’s got lots more to say now.

‘But then some time passed. I don’t remember how much time had passed before I was watching the news and there was her face. Sandy. Right there. It was far, far too spooky, dude. But I didn’t think you killed her, not right away.’

‘I, uh, didn’t kill her, Jacob.’

‘Well, I didn’t think so, not right away. Then everything with Caitlyn happened and I didn’t ever think about it. When you texted me about hiking I figured we would be making amends. I put it together just before I blacked out. You definitely weren’t having an affair in the middle of the night. In that very, very last split second I realized you *would* kill me not because I was a clear problem in your life, but because I mistakenly asked you about Sandy after her disappearance, and you finally realized that you had revealed far, far too much to me.’

‘I definitely didn’t kill you, Jacob.’ I always say that.

‘Yes you did. You killed me. And Sandy. And I’m guessing half the people that disappear here.’

‘I definitely didn’t. You and I both know that I didn’t.’

‘I know that you did. God sometimes accompanies me here, wherever I’m drifting in and out of. He shows me your path of destruction, of selfishness and greed. He shows me your sins.’

‘HE LIES. That’s the devil! That’s the devil because you burn in hell! Murderer. Adulterer. Drug-peddler. That’s what you are.’

‘It is God. He shows me your path of destruction. And he shows me the way out of purgatory. He helps me understand why I died. He shows me you will burn for all eternity.’

‘HE MADE ME THIS WAY.’

I am sorry for screaming. For my emotion. But I really hate this conversation with Jacob; I hate remembering it and having it seemingly every week since the trial ended. It is how this conversation moves me. I say, is this all proof enough that I didn’t kill Jacob Bell? I hate this question. Come to think of it, I don’t even remember you wanting to ask me anything else. I’ve been talking so endlessly about how much I didn’t kill Jacob Bell or anyone else, for that matter, and I find this whole thing highly inappropriate. I’m not sure why you’re down here, anyway and why you’re making me talk about all this again. I must assume you don’t watch the news. Most people know that the pier is dangerous at night.

That’s not to say I’m not so happy that you’re here. I haven’t slept much over the last week, and you’re just the kind of thing that might help me sleep. Not just tonight, but for maybe quite a while. But this is the last time, stranger, the last time I’m going to say it at all before I never see or hear from you again.

I did not kill Jacob Bell. Wouldn’t. Couldn’t. And I didn’t kill anyone else.

And I’m definitely not going to kill you.
