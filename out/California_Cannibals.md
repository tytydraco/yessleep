This was in December of 2017.

I went to a famous pier in California and there was a performance happening with dancers. A humongous crowd was surrounding them & they were calling in people from the crowd to make a line for them to jump over etc.

I don't think anyone else saw this because of how busy it was, but I noticed off in the distance a squirrel chewing on another squirrels ripped off head. 

I had four rommates where I used to live and brought it up to the three that were home and no one had noticed this before, ever. 

I looked it up online and saw an article talking about the phenomenon noticed in California. But while scrolling I saw a restaurant called *The Cannibal.* I thought it was extremely ironic because for the first time ever I saw a squirrel eating another squirrel. 

At the time I was bored enough to check it out. I was getting paid the next day around 1 pm so I waited until then. Those three of my roommates didnt have money they wanted to spend on a random restaurant & I couldn't ask the fourth because he not only wasn't there but was rarely ever there so I had to go alone. I didn't even know him well. He was a friend of one of the other roommates and didn't talk much.

I walked into the restaurant and it smelled like pork. There was a glass case on display that had all types of cuts but they were extremely large. Labeled as beef etc but the entire place just smelled like pork.

I sat down with the menu and everything on it just looked like a normal ordinary restaurant. The waiter (looked like the owner or regional manager) ended up taking my order. Probably just to show that he was helping out. 

He asked me how I was, and I said fine and asked him in a humorous tone if he had known about the cannibal squirrels around here. He said "what drink would you like?" I told him a coke. He then walked away and I was confused because I didn't even get a chance to tell him that I was ready to order.

He comes back with my drink, I told him I was ready to order. He laughs and says "I'll be back with your order shortly." At this point I was extremely confused, for obvious reasons.

Shortly was clearly a lie considering I sat there for about 30 minutes. He comes back with a large burger and says "bon appetit!" and walks away to the other side of the restaurant to take an order over there.

I didn't know what was going on. I just assumed I walked in on a special day and it was free and part of a whole whatever holiday thing they're pulling off. Like a Christmas event or something since it was December.

I took a bite of this "burger" and it tasted like a hotdog. Tasted well enough for me to not question why this burger tasted like pork yet. I thought, well clearly he just served me this randomly because it was something unique like a signature staple of their restaurant. That's when it clicked that something was off. 

This place is called *The Cannibal.* Now just the thought of this as an imaginary person burger was enough for me to spit it out into a napkin. I get up to go to the bathroom to wash the pork taste in my mouth out.

I'm walking and glance into the kitchen as I'm passing it and see something like a thick leg looking log hurriedly moved across the opening I could see. 

It looked like a bunch of plastic was laid out all around the kitchen too. Like a Dexter murder scene. 

I had a bad feeling about all of that and didn't even remember or think about the fact that the food I received wasn't paid for because I rushed out.

It was about 40 minutes away from where I lived so I had some time to think about it and was getting a shit ton of anxiety about even the potential of what happened and was occasionally gagging telling myself that it wasn't what I thought it might be.

When I got home the fourth roommate was in the kitchen cooking and it smelled like pork. I told him about how I went to The Cannibal for the first time and how their burgers were huge and like nothing I've ever tasted. 

He looked at me and smiled and looked back at the patties he was cooking on the stove and proudly informed me that he worked there as a chef. He then asked me if I wanted some of what he was cooking. Putting two and two together I thanked him, declined, and went into my room somewhat hyperventilating until I convinced myself that I just had a weird day.

I spent the rest of the night playing league of legends to get my mind off of all of that before I went to sleep. When I woke up I noticed a small, neat, embroidered porcelain looking box near my door. I walked up to it and it said "Cannibal Cuisine." I checked my phone and had a text from the fourth roommate that I mentioned saying "left you a gift. Didn't know you were a part of the group. Hope to get to know you better."

I almost didn't open the box and wondered if I was dreaming for a second. But I opened it and it was a glossy menu. One of the items was "*Finger Food*" and it looked like the chicken fries from burger king. But the cup looked ornate and was porcelain. It had a "code phrase" that said "is your favorite color white?"

There weren't descriptions on anything though. Just the item name and a phrase in quotations beneath it. I didn't see everything on the menu because I eventually refused to look at any more of it as I freaked out and went to the big apartment trash can outside to toss it all after wiping it down with a wet wipe to hopefully get my finger prints off of it while wearing cleaning gloves to hold it. 

I saw naked bodies in the Leonardo DaVinci "Vitruvian Man" pose but without the double arms. But they weren't drawings, they were photos of actual people and skimming my eyes across the rest there were individual "cuts" listed of each body on display. Like in the squared out section of one of the menu bodies, you would see photos of the limbs themselves named and prepared looking.

I called my uncle and asked if he still had the spare room he said I could use to put some of my stuff in. He said yes and I asked if I could move in and he said yes. I grabbed my essentials & sentimentals, left my bed and other heavy but replaceable things, sent rent through cash app to the roommate on the lease (not the Cannibal guy) blocked every single one of their numbers, deactivated all of my social media accounts and got out of there. 

I told my uncle everything. I didn't know what to do and was panicking because that "group" now knew that I knew what they were up to. He told me to get out of California. I left in February of 2018. Lo & behold, in January of that year the restaurant permanently closed.
