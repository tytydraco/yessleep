When I told my father I wanted my birthday present to be my first kiss, he rolled his eyes.

Just another one of Maria’s delusions, he probably thought.

Sure, I’m dramatic, but not crazy. I just want love, like the couples I used to see in town, walking hand in hand after school. But when I tried making friends, they treated me horribly. “Get out of here, monster!” one boy snapped. I’ll never forget.

After that, my father forbade me from ever going into town. “It draws too much attention,” he said. 

But I grew lonely. I lived in a swampy area, 70 miles from the nearest Walmart, with only Dad and my brother Jimmy. Jimmy couldn’t even talk—he just threw rocks into the river and wandered the woods.

So, a week before my 20th birthday, I decided to snuck back into town until I found someone special. 

At dawn, I slipped out as my father went to bed after another night in his lab. I wore a big hat, sunglasses, a scarf, and a coat. That way, no one would call me a monster.

After devouring countless romance novels, I was done experiencing love only on the page. And I ended up finding it in three days.

\---

On the first day, I went to the city park. Athletes are supposed to be the most handsome, at least it's what I read in my books. Maybe I would found a couple of them there.

After hours of wandering through old people again and again, I finally saw a good candidate: short hair, biceps like watermelons, and the height of a bear. He was running my way, headphones on.

I waited for him in the parking lot. When he was packing his stuff in the car I approached him from behind and made my move. “Hi there, handsome,” I said. 

He turned, confused. “Do we know each other?” he questioned.

I told him we didn’t and asked his name. Jared. He was the first boy to reject me.

\---

The next morning, I tried again, wandering Main Street as shops opened. People stared, probably thinking I had a skin condition, due to my clothes.

In a small bookstore, I spotted my next candidate: the clerk. He had gorgeous curly hair, dazzling teeth, and a warm smile as he helped an old lady get a book.  If I weren’t so shy, I’d have told her not to buy it—I’d read it already, and the twist was quite disappointing.

I entered the line. When it was my turn, he glanced at my heavily made-up face and asked, “What can I help you find?”

“Anything you want,” I replied, melting under his gaze.

He smiled like a man used to getting hit on daily. He said his name was Carlos.

Carlos was the second boy to reject me.

On the third day, disheartened, I tried again. But about 20 miles from home, my tire blew. As I started to change it, a car pulled up. A man stepped out and asked if I needed help. It was the perfect chance to play the helpless damsel.

He didn’t have Jared’s physique or Carlos’s smile, but he wasn’t bothered by my appearance and kept talking to me a lot. While he replaced the tire, we talked about car maintenance, the weather, sports and hunting. He even cracked a few jokes. It was the best conversation I’d had in years.

When he finished, I asked his name. It was David.

David didn’t get the chance to reject me, I couldn't take the chance of him getting away this close to my birthday.

\---

As I pulled into the driveway, I heard my father’s angry shouts. “Goddammit, Maria! I told you not to go into town!”. I froze, he had woken up earlier than expected.

He stomped toward me. Opening the truck bed, he revealed David’s body—stone-cold, with wide eyes and a slit neck.

“Another one?! Maria, I just found two more bodies in your room!” he roared.

“You went into my room? That’s such a violation of trust!” I deflected.

But as I saw he wasn't buying it, I collapsed, sobbing.

His anger softened. “I just wanted one good thing for my birthday, Dad,” I whimpered.

He sighed. “Fine, Maria. Just this once. But no more sneaking around.”

I hugged him tightly. “Can you do it, Dad? Can you make me a boyfriend the same way you made me?”

His eyes darkened. “Honey, you know I haven’t tried since I made your brother.”

“Please, Dad. Try for me.”

He silently consented, and I helped him carry the body to the lab.

\---

On my birthday, I wore my best dress. It revealed my bare arms with their different hues, marked by pins and sutures. My pale, stitched face—enough to give anyone a heart attack—was on full display.

As an accessory, I wore only an earring, which my father claimed belonged to my mother. Or at least one of them. Technically, I had several mothers. My life before I was given life by father is a mistery to me.

When I walked to the dining table, Jimmy was already seated, tied to his chair. I was delighted—Dad only tied him up on special occasions. Otherwise, he'd just wander out.

Soon, Dad brought my present: Jared’s body, Carlos’s face, and David’s brain. Its sutures were fresh, and mismatched parts showed flesh and bone beneath the old shirt.

“Can it speak yet, Dad?” I asked, eagerly.

“Sort of,” he replied. “Say something, Marvin” he commanded, also showing us the new name he'd given.

Its trembling eyes darted around before it opened its mouth and said, “Help.”

Dad smiled, pleased with the fact his new creation woudn't be like Jimmy. It looked a lot like me when I was created.

I hugged him tightly. “Thank you, Dad. This is the best present ever!”

Grabbing Marvin’s hands, I held them tightly.

“Kiss her,” Dad ordered. Marvin brought his face closer.

I kissed his cold lips for a solid minute, as tears flowed from both our faces.
