I’m an engineer in Scotland. Twenty-five years into the trade, I’ve never married, never really dated—always too immersed in the build, the next project, the climb. But two weeks ago, something unusual happened. An army friend, now high in rank, invited me to a private gathering at Balmoral Castle. The Queen’s estate. The invite alone made my palms sweat.

I dressed in my best suit—one of those that’s only ever left the wardrobe for job interviews and funerals—and set off. But fate, ever mischievous, threw in a complication. Fifteen minutes from Balmoral, my car broke down.

As I stood beside the bonnet, cursing softly, a silver Range Rover Sport rolled up behind me. Out stepped a sharply dressed man—mid-forties maybe—with slicked-back hair and a scent so strong and floral it could’ve stripped wallpaper. Bubble bath. Thick, almost artificial. He introduced himself as Mr Sgáil.

“Looks like you’re having car trouble, lad. Want me to take a look?”

“Are you a mechanic?”

“Ha! No, import/export executive. Got injured at work, was sent home on pay. Got bored, started helping my uncle at his garage. Picked up a few things.”

He peeled off his coat and cufflinks, rolled up his sleeves, and got to work—still in a waistcoat, oddly formal. While fiddling under the bonnet, he chatted.

“You headed to a party, judging by the threads?”

“Yeah. Balmoral estate. My mate’s hosting.”

At that, he paused. His brow creased—like he'd just remembered something he shouldn’t have.

“You ever hear the rumours about Balmoral? About the pyramid nearby?”

“I've seen YouTubers hike up to it, but no... no stories.”

“Well… they say a group of European royals meet there every year. For sport. But not the fox-hunting kind. Children. Used to import them from the States, before their supplier was shut down. Sheriff was killed. The whole operation collapsed. Now? They take them from impoverished areas in Glasgow.”

He gave the engine a firm kick.

“There you go. Good as new.”

I barely got out a thank-you before driving off—his eyes following me in the mirror. Unblinking.

The party at Balmoral was everything you'd expect—crystal glasses, tailored laughter, men who’d survived wars and women who'd started them. But I couldn’t enjoy any of it. Sgáil’s words weighed heavy. I slipped outside under the guise of a cigarette break and made my way toward the pyramid.

It took time on foot, but I found it—looming, silent, regal and unnatural all at once. Built for Prince Albert by Queen Victoria, the sign said. I ran my fingers across the plaque… and pushed.

A grinding noise. Then, the stone base of the pyramid slid open, revealing a spiraling staircase carved deep into the earth. I hesitated—then descended.

Below, the air turned colder. And then I saw them: rows of cells, each with a child inside. Silent. Motionless. Drugged? Maybe. But two things made my blood run colder.

There was a tunnel beyond the cells. Parked inside it: a silver Range Rover Sport.

And then—bubble bath. That same overwhelming scent.

A hand landed softly on my shoulder.

“ Fancy seeing you here "
