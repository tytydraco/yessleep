Whenever my roommate and I go to bed, usually around 11:30, I will always hear a faint noise from outside our dorm room. 

Most of the time, these noises are not human. I hear a faint growling, almost like it’s down the hall from us, and often times I hear the slight sound of a claw scratching a nearby door.

Whenever I ask my roommate about this he says he hasn’t heard them. I ask other people, and only one other person has heard them.

I always thought it was weird hearing these noises because we’re on the second floor. I would expect to hear cars more than growling and scratching. 

And then the sounds started to come from the outside.

A slight tap or pebble knocked the window last night. Nothing else, just that.

I wouldn’t have thought anything of it if I hadn’t have drawn open my blinds this morning and noticed the handprint.

A large, oily handprint on my corner of the window. I sat up in my bed in shock as my roommate slowly closed the blinds back up.

I wouldn’t be writing this if I wasn’t experiencing what I am right now. I am laying in my bed attempting to stay still, shivering through my warm covers, my body drenched in sweat.

I heard the scratching again tonight, but instead of to my left or right, dead in front of me.

I slowly leaned over in my bed and I saw it.

A large shadow blocking the light that usually slips through the cracks of my door and its frame. It is tall and will not move.

I will not move.

Neither of us making a movement. I’m doing my best to stay quiet, to not attract the attention of whatever may be on the other side of the door.

I’m not saying I’m afraid that it might be some random asshole.

That THING does not sound human.

I’m terrified to make a noise. If it hears me, it won’t leave. I’m hoping that I can just put in my earbuds and trust myself not to snore, but every now and then I hear the smallest little clawing at the door. 

3 inches of wood separate me and whatever the fuck is outside my room. I fear any movement that I make will be sensed, and I will have to stay on high alert. It is 1 am at the time of writing and I have to be up in 6 hours. 

If only I would sleep for any of those. Who’s going to believe me when they ask why I’m so tired? Who is going to honestly think I’m correct in the head?

Even I’m doubting myself. If this is some building wide prank, the person doing it is brilliant. Even then, why? Why do this? What do you have to gain? How much money are you getting for this?

I don’t if it’s a human though.

What kind of human growls like that?
