I was going through a pretty substantial teenage rebellion phase during the last year of highschool. All the adults and professors at the time were saying trite things about this one year we had to work our butts off for the finals and how it was the one year when holidays and breaks meant just more time to study and how we had to give 100% of our energy to that and be rewarded with the chill laid back uni life afterwards.

They were trying to motivate us I guess but they only made it seem like some impossible and torturous challenge, it seemed like they were trying to drill it into our minds that this year we had to abandon the idea of fun entirely and this didn't really sit well with me at the time. I guess you could say I was lazy or maybe it was because I had no idea what I actually wanted to study at uni or what I wanted to do with my life and what I was striving for so I had decided to not strive at all.

My professors at school who knew me as the smart kid from previous years were pretty surprised to see my grades plummet as they did, as was everyone else when I started dressing progressively more emo. At first it was just wearing all black for a while and then came the pentagram neckless and the spiked collar and a whole lot of skull imagery. Yeah I know... I was very cringy.

I was staying alone at the time; my father was in the hospital for what would become a full month. His chronic smoking had caught up with him and he had developed a lung condition with a fancy medical name which I don't remember and which basically meant that there was not enough oxygen in his system to keep his body working properly. After a whole summer of him not thinking straight due to it, being unable to keep himself awake while working on the pc or watching tv and regularly arguing with my mother at 3:00 over his habit of waking up in the middle of the night to smoke, him going to the hospital was actually quite a relief.

My father was not the only one with bad habits though, my main vice -so to speak- was truancy. My new stereotype among my classmates was "perpetually absent" it had become rare for me to stay for an entire day's curriculum. usually around the second or third break of the day I would just... leave and walk home. This would mean I didn't have the convenience of a schoolbus OfCourse but that wasn't really an issue to me. Walking home from school was a matter of half an hour, 45 minutes tops and it was actually quite a pleasant walk. Under the cloudy weather of late autumn I felt like I could be alone with my thoughts, away from my professors and their scolding, my classmates and their teasing and my parents and their house filled with bad memories. 

Part of the path I took to go home was a shortcut through a park, the shortcut itself was about one third of the total distance I had to walk. Refreshing as it was to go through the greenery, I was always a bit unnerved being in that park. Amidst the tall trees and the sounds of birds -and while I often wasn't alone there, seeing other people jog and walk their pets through the tiny pocket of "forest"- there was something about the place that made me feel uneasy ever since I was a kid.

There were scary tales about the park among the kids of my school ever since I was in primary. Those tales ranged from mundane to seer childish insanity. The most common was that there were packs of stray dogs living in the park and that they were dangerous and had bitten people or that the park was a common place for illegal drug sales and usage. The later was probably true if I was to judge by the frequency at which I saw discarded syringes amongst the dry leaves and the underbrush.

This park had a weird history. It was created on the site of a long-demolished ammunition factory and there were still storage bunkers under it. The locked doors to these bunkers could still be found around the park. It was also the site of a modern art exhibit and along the paths that go through it there were various abstract statues now covered with tagging, when I was a kid the bunker doors and statues seemed like the remnants of some lost civilisation.

Off course the childish campfire tales that were hard to take seriously included secret labs with mad scientists cloning mutant dinosaurs under the park. Doors that open to hell directly, nukes that will go off and destroy the entire city and herobrine hanging about along with slenderman. The most famous and widespread story however was of the Daphoenodon. The name was coined by a kid that was really into prehistoric animals back in primary school and it stuck for sounding cool, serious and grown up. Before it was decided on, we also referred to the creature as Gutdog, Bearwolf and Wildmutt after the Ben 10 alien.

The Daphoenodon was said to be a stray dog larger and more ferocious than any other that lived in the park. It was said to actively hunt and eat people. Some of the tales had it that it was locked underground in a maze that the bunker doors led to -like the minotaur- in others it only came out at night. It was said to be a cannibal who eats other dogs if you ever leave them in the park at night so you should never walk your pet there after sundown.

The Daphoenodon was terrifying to look at though the different accounts disagreed on its appearance. in Some it was a full-on zombie dog, in other more imaginative depictions it had blades coming out of its back glowing eyes and wolverine claws. Its origins varied too from childish tale to childish tale. In some it was created by a mad scientist, in others it was a werewolf cursed to stay in wolf form forever after committing an unspeakable act, in others it was the pet of a girl that died tragically and it was possessed by her soul.

Needless to say that no one believed the Daphoenodon was real by middleschool much less highschool. The story started we assumed when a kid got chased by a dog while in the park and from retelling to retelling the dog turned into some man-eating monster.

However, I would soon come to see that there was more truth in the heart of this absurd tale that I would ever have guessed. It was a November day and it was raining heavily. Wanting to spare myself the daily scolding by the physics professor and severely overestimating the protection offered by my umbrella and raincoat I had embarked on another glorious escape.

Avoiding stepping on puddles while on the street and pavement was easy, but as soon as I entered the park I was welcomed by the sensation of stepping on fresh mud with shoes that were very much not made for this weather. Flinching as the water quickly started soaking my shocks, I started walking forwards trying to ignore the feeling. As I went, I saw that the park was empty of people, no one wanted to enter it in such a horrid weather, this along with the grey blanket of heavy clouds above being occasionally split by a powerful lightning that sounded too close for comfort made walking through the park creepier than it already would have been.

"Just go through with it" I thought "As quickly as possible, before you know it you will be in your comfy home dry and warm" I hastened my step as I heard the loud gross slapping noise that my steps made on the wet soil. For some reason I was extremely unnerved at how much sound I was making. As if I knew someone was looking for me with ill intent.

When I was younger, while returning home in the winter after my swimming lessons in the rare cases when my parents couldn't pick me up I would run through the dark streets in fear as if something was chasing me. I felt the same way that day despite my age of 18 at the time. So, I was moving quickly through the park until I slept on the mud, landing unceremoniously and painfully on my butt with the entirety of my trousers and my schoolbag getting dirtied. My first instinct as a self-conscious teen was to look around for anyone who saw me trip like an idiot.

As I turned my head to the left I saw nothing but trees but as I turned to the right I just... saw it there. In the distance a figure of an animal walking slowly through the trees facing me, but that animal was not a normal stray dog. Even in the distance I could see it was anything but normal. It was tall, maybe looking taller while I was on the ground but tall nonetheless. larger than a German Shepherd.

It was hunched over like a hyena and its fur was long and off course soaked with rainwater. Its forelimbs were simultaneously looking muscular and malnourished. It seemed almost like the muscles where in the wrong shape and disproportional. The creature walked with a weird limp as if its back legs were not the same length with each other, and the worst of all was its head.

It was crooked, tilting to the side and its jaw hanged half open revealing a series of teeth that were too big for a dog. That monstrous mouth was framed by long hair around its snout that looked almost like a human beard. The creature either had no ears or the ears were too small for me to see at that distance. One of its eyes was blind from a deep wound and the other was almost entirely round as if it had no eyelids and it was looking right at me.

Any momentary hope that it would ignore me vanished instantly as I saw the creature start to walk faster right towards me. My mind was filled with disbelief like when you see something surreal and realise you are in a dream, but that disbelief was quickly shattered by an overpowering primal fear.

"The Daphoenodon" I thought in sheer terror as I tried to hastily push myself back upright dirtying my hands in the mud as I staggered back to my legs. I knew what people say is the proper thing to do when you see a dog act aggressively towards you, but whatever part of me could still think reasonably was overpowered by the internal argument that "This might not be a dog in the first place" All that was left was panic. I run in the opposite direction faster than I thought I could run screaming out "HELP" in the vain hope that another person hears me. I could hear the creature run behind me, but that thankfully it was not fast enough to catch up.

It seemed for a moment that the adrenaline rush could get me through this until I felt my foot slip in a sloped surface and before I knew it, I was rolling and tumbling down the ramp that led to one of the bunker doors. I was with my back on the locked door, triangular walls on either side and the only way out being back up the ramp to the surface where I fell from, and that way was soon blocked by the beast that caught up to me snarling and baring its fangs.

The only thing I could think of doing was simply push the open umbrella between me and the creature like shield and keep screaming. I am not physically strong in the least and had nothing on me that I could use as a weapon. Even if I was attacked by a normal large dog I would be helpless. I saw the monster's claws tear through the fabric of the umbrella, clawing and barking as I cried and screamed.

Even people who survive wild animal attacks end up deformed with horrific wounds, and that wasn't covering the very real possibility I would not survive. My life had never been threatened up to that point, I was a city kid whose biggest worry was bullies. And I was caught pinned against a wall by some feral beast I didn't understand.

I pulled out my phone with muddied fingers leaving imprints on the screen as I tried to type my country's emergency number, but I knew that there was no way I could hold that thing back for long enough for anyone to come. The creature could break the umbrella if it actually tried to, I was only spared cause it didn't seem to really understand the nature of the obstacle fully yet and was just trying to push it out of the way rather than destroy it.

Right as I was about to call however I heard something, a sound cutting through both my screams and the vocalisations of the creature, it was something between a human whistling and a wolf howling. And as soon as it was heard the Daphoenodon suddenly stopped attacking, not only that but I heard it walk away still snarling and growling as it retreated back up the ramp almost begrudgingly.

What I heard from then on was something I still cannot fully comprehend, it sounded like a fight, between the creature that hunted me and something else. Something else whose growling and snarling sounded eerily human. Like a person trying to mimic the sounds of an animal but being extremely good at it.

I heard claws sink into flesh, biting and scratching, splashing in the mud, amidst the sounds of the rain and the lightning. I didn't call anyone and I stopped screaming -I didn't wanna make any sound in case I drew attention to myself again. I waited there with my pitiful umbrella shield and my heart pulling off a drum solo for what seemed like hours. Until the sounds stopped. I heard something walking away and thankfully it wasn't the Daphoenodon and it wasn't walking in my direction.

I stayed there until the rain stopped. After a long while of silence I started crawling back out of my foxhole and saw the dead remains of the Daphoenodon laying a few meters away. The creature was torn to shreds, twisted across the waist with its spine poking out through the carcass. blood mixed with mud had formed a pool around it. There were deep cuts in sets of 4 that had to have been made by claws and the most glaring detail was that its head was missing completely.

Something had come and killed the Daphoenodon, saving me in the process. Something with claws which nevertheless left behind a set of bare human footprints walking away from the corpse of the monster.

I never entered that park again since then. I went on with my life in many things. I failed the exams the first time but tried again next year and did well. Now I am enjoying my time at uni and I also went in through the legal loopholes required to get a gun where I live, after that event I am a bit paranoid about my safety... But I am not yet satisfied to say "I don't know" and leave it at that,

There are feral things living out there in the shadowed crevices of the concrete jungle, I want to know where the come from I want to know what it was that attacked me and what it was that saved me.
