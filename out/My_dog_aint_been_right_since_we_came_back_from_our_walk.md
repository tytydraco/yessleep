Last week, I took my chocolate lab Max out for a walk. I live in the Appalachians, so there's no shortage of trails and wilderness for us to explore. There's a state park a short drive from my house, I gotta pass it to get to work even, so that has always been my go to. I guess I had a lot on my mind when we went out, because we kind of got lost. I remember just being deep in the woods, with no idea of how I got out there. I must've been deep in my own thoughts. So much so that the last, God knows how many minutes were just blank in my mind. The same thing that happens every now and then on my commute to work, highway hypnosis or whatever you wanna call it.

The more I looked around, the more nervous I started to get. If I didn't have Max there with my I probably would've been shitting my pants. I decided to just follow the trail I was on, I mean it had to come out somewhere. Another ten minutes or so of walking and we hear this rustling in the foliage about fifty feet away. So Max just instantly sticks his big brown nose up in the air and starts sniffing right? He only needs to smell for a half a second before his demeanor changes completely. He got down real low to the ground, bore his teeth. I'd never heard him growl like that at anything.

Now I like to think I'm a pretty logical guy, I can rationalize out of just about anything. But I've lived in these mountains my whole life. When you're out here by yourself, all that shit goes out the window. There is no impossible, because there is no law, of any kind. If something, "impossible" happened to me out here, something that couldn't happen under our understanding of the world, it wouldn't matter because no one would be around to perceive it. Things that are unexplainable happen out here, people go missing when they shouldn't. You can call these irregularities what you like, but anyone who has spent any real time out here knows that if you're out alone and things don't "feel" right, you get the fuck outta dodge.

Max wasn't as keen on turning tale as I was, I basically had to drag him by his leash while I did my best to keep a light jog. I wanted more than anything to run, but I wouldn't be doing anything with good intentions any favors by running outta breath out there. If all that shit wasn't bad enough, the last rays of daylight were already faltering behind the trees. I was just about to start really losing my shit when I finally saw something I recognized, an old mile marker. If you could've seen my eyes then you'd have sworn I saw God himself and all his apostles there in that brush. Max was still fighting behind me but he had calmed down a little himself. I gave him a good scratch behind the ears just how he liked. He walked by my side after that and a few minutes later we were back at my car.

Now what happened next I've played over in my mind a thousand times wishing I could have changed something, anything. Wishing I hadn't such a damned fool. I opened the back door of my truck and started getting the seat ready for Max, something I'd done so many times, it made me let my guard down. Something about a routine will do that to ya. I let go of the vice grip I had on his leash. As soon as I did, there was another sound from just inside the treeline. Max took off like a bat out of hell, snarling and growling. I screamed for him, but he didn't stop. He disappeared in the tall grass, barking with every breath. Then there was no barking, and I was just screaming into nothing. I didn't think I'd ever see him again.

I was froze in place, hot tears pooling in my eyes. I couldn't leave him, but I sure as hell couldn't go after him. It was probably only five minutes, but it felt like a whole lifetime there by my truck in the twilight. Enough time for me to say my prayers anyway. I think something heard those prayers, I just don't know what it was. He walked out of the woods real slow, real cautious. I was so overjoyed by seeing him I started crying even harder. I got on my knees and called to him, expecting him to run up wagging his tail. He didn't, his movements were restrained and labored. I knew right then and there something was wrong but I didn't care. 

He always laid down in the backseat while I drove, always had ever since he was a pup. But he didn't that day on the way back. He sat perfectly still, and his eyes sat locked on my reflection in the rear view mirror. I ain't seen him lay down even once since then. He either stands or he sits, and he always keeps an eye on me. See first I thought maybe he'd just been scared, seen some big animal or something. He'd always hated being in the crate, so that night I put him in. Expecting him to whine and protest. He didn't, he just sat there and looked at me. 

I laid awake in the for hours just thinking. There was something else wrong, not just in the way he was acting but, something else too. I couldn't pin it down then and I'm not even sure I can now. I gave up trying to sleep at some point, got up doing my best to not make a sound. I snuck into the living room and turned on the light. Maybe if I could've just caught sight of him laying down sleeping I'd feel better. He was sitting still in the middle of the crate, black eyes focused on mine.

I ain't let him out of that crate yet. I ain't a monster, I slid his food and water bowls inside too but he ain't touched them. He ain't even so much as made a mess for me to clean up. I live alone, just me and him. I never knew how empty the place could feel without him running back and forth, barking at the door. It's strange that I can spend so much energy missing something that's sitting in the middle of my house. 

Yesterday things got worse, I was working real late, I didn't get off until the sun way already setting. On my way home, I saw a chocolate lab absolutely hauling ass on the side of the road. You can call me crazy but I swear it looked just like Max. Not whatever the hell is in my living room but Max. I pulled a u-turn right there on the road and went after him. That's when I saw where he was running, he blew right past the old sign that said Brakes interstate park. I let off the gas and stopped dead in the road. My heart was pounding so bad I thought I was gonna have a heart attack. I just popped another U-turn and started on home. I gave one last looked out of the mirror and saw Max sitting by the sign. Perfectly still. That night I threw a blanket over his crate.

That brings me to this morning. I have the day off, and its a good thing too, because I didn't get a wink of sleep last night. Anytime I'd start to dose off I'd dream of Max and wake up. I'll be honest, I'm terrified for the sun to go down. I don't wanna spend another minute in the dark with that thing in my house. I just don't know what to do. Even after all that I just don't have the heart to get rid of him. God knows what they would say if I took him a to vet. This subreddit is kind of my last hope, so please, if anyone out there has any idea what the hell is going on or just any advice please let me know.
