I’ve been a police officer in a small town for about 15 years. It’s not a big city, so most of the calls we get are about neighbor disputes, speeding, or occasionally about burglaries. Nothing too heavy. But this night was something different.

That night, I was on duty with a colleague when we got a call about persistent nighttime noise. A woman complained about muffled screams and loud sounds coming from a neighboring house, almost every night for a week. A routine noise complaint, but repeated enough to warrant attention. I volunteered to go alone, my partner was covering another area, and it sounded simple enough.

The house in question was on a quiet residential street, well-lit and unassuming. A modest home with an overgrown garden. The windows were closed, and not a single curtain covered the panes. Everything inside was dark.

I approached and knocked on the door. Once. Twice. Nothing. I was about to head back to my car when the door suddenly swung open.

A man stood there, shirtless, his hair disheveled, and his face slick with sweat. He stared at me with wild, feverish eyes. He looked to be in his forties, wiry but tense, like a coiled spring. Dark stains covered his chest and arms, irregular and some still wet.

"Good evening, sir. I’m here responding to a noise complaint", I began calmly, trying not to react to his disheveled appearance. "Is everything all right ?"

He didn’t answer at first, just stared at me. His lips quivered slightly, and his eyes darted past me, as if he was expecting someone else to show up.

"There’s no noise here", he finally said, his voice raspy and uneven.

I couldn’t help but notice the stains on his body. They weren’t just sweat; they were darker, messier. I had to ask.

"Are you injured ? That stuff on you, it looks like blood."

He glanced down at his chest, then let out a dry, nervous laugh. "No. Nothing. You should leave".

His tone shifted abruptly, from hesitant to aggressive. I took a step forward to get a better look at him, and he stepped back quickly, trying to close the door. I blocked it with my foot.

"Wait a second. I need to ask you a few questions. If everything’s fine, I’ll be on my way."

"There’s nothing here ! Get out !" he suddenly shouted, slamming the door harder. The force made me step back, and before I could react, he turned and bolted inside the house, disappearing down a hallway.

I started after him but stopped at the threshold. Instead, I called for backup. Dispatch confirmed a unit would arrive in about ten minutes. In the meantime, I decided to stay at the door, hoping the man would calm down or come back, but something felt wrong.

The air in the house was heavy, thick with an acrid smell I couldn’t quite place. It wasn’t just stale, it was deeper, more organic. I shone my flashlight into the hallway and took a tentative step inside.

The walls were dirty, scratched in places. A few dusty frames with faded photos hung crookedly. And somewhere deeper in the house, I could hear faint noises, whispers or low muffled groans.

I reached what looked like the living room. That’s when things took a dark turn.

In the center of the room was a wooden chair with straps attached to the armrests and back. The floor was covered in old newspapers, soaked with what looked like dried blood. On a small coffee table sat an array of tools, knives, pliers, and other implements, all rusted or stained. And the smell... It was overwhelming now, a putrid mix of decay and iron.

Behind me, I heard a creak. I spun around, and there he was, standing in a doorway. He held something metallic in his hand, something heavy.

"No... No... No... You shouldn’t have come inside", he muttered.

I drew my weapon and ordered him to drop whatever he was holding. He didn’t. Instead, he smiled, a twisted, deranged grin. Then, he threw the object toward me and darted down another hallway, disappearing through a door I hadn’t noticed before.

I chased after him, my pulse pounding in my ears. I couldn’t let him escape, but every instinct screamed at me to turn around and wait for backup. Still, something drove me forward.

The door led to a staircase descending into the basement. The wooden steps creaked under my weight as I descended. My flashlight flickered slightly, or maybe it was just my shaking hand.

The basement was a nightmare.

It wasn’t large, but every inch of it was used for something horrifying. Meat hooks hung from the ceiling, some still occupied by… I don’t even want to describe it. A table held a pile of clothing, likely belonging to the victims.

And in the corner was a cage. Inside was a woman, curled up and trembling. Her eyes were wide open but lifeless, like all hope had drained from her.

That’s when I realized the truth. This wasn’t his first time. This man was a predator, a monster in human form. And this house was just his latest stage.

When backup finally arrived, he was gone. We searched the house, the neighborhood, but it was as if he had vanished into thin air.

Investigators later discovered that the house didn’t even belong to him. It belonged to a family that had been missing for two months. Their fate remains a mystery.

To this day, I can’t forget his face, or the smell of that basement. But what haunts me most is the thought that he’s still out there, somewhere, ready to start again, and that this house was just one of many.
