I still remember what happened that night, but it’s best to start from the beginning.

It was a winter day, and my hands were freezing, along with every part of me. That day, my parents made me clean up the things left over from the Christmas festivities. My parents invited every possible family member to these celebrations—they took the phrase “Christmas is for family” very seriously. I don’t complain, but they left all the work to me. Meanwhile, my father was busy returning the Christmas tree to nature, and my mother was out as well, taking her brother home, so I was left alone. Being an only child, they and I were the only ones living in our house.

While I was dealing with the aftermath of the celebrations, I found a straw doll under some gift wrapping paper. It seemed curious, but I didn’t pay much attention to it—maybe one of my cousins forgot to take their gift. I picked up the doll and left it on a shelf while I continued with the rest of the mess.

I managed to finish the cleaning on time, and just as my mother had arrived from dropping off her brother at his house, she headed straight to her room. I guess she was still feeling the aftereffects of the party, so I let her rest.

I went to relax in the living room while my father was still outside; it seemed like he was going to take a while, given that disposing of a Christmas tree, according to my father, was never that easy—especially if one wants to be environmentally friendly. I never asked my father what he meant by that, but I didn't give it much importance either.

Back to the main point: when I entered the living room, I saw the doll I had found earlier in the distance. I decided to leave it there until my father returned or my mother woke up; maybe one of them would know whose it could be, after all, they were there when the gifts were opened. So, I would just wait while I relaxed.

Nothing happened all afternoon until my mother woke up and decided to prepare dinner while we were still waiting for my father, who didn’t take long to appear. I decided to help my mother while my father got comfortable after his journey. During dinner, when the three of us were together, I decided to tell them about the doll. When I showed them the doll, their looks seemed puzzled. They asked me where the doll had come from; I told them I found it under some wrapping paper. They said they didn’t know whose it could be, but if it would put me at ease, they would make some calls to see if anyone who came to the party had forgotten it or knew anything about the doll. I told them that would be fine because, even though it was just a simple doll, I wouldn’t want to just throw it away, so I thanked them and decided to go to rest, taking the doll with me to keep an eye on it. To this day, I regret having done that.

I left the doll next to my phone on the little table beside my bed, turned off the lights, snuggled into my sheets, and went to sleep.

That night, I woke up wanting to check the time, but my body didn’t respond. I panicked; I wanted to scream, and my breathing was very heavy, the cold air stinging my lungs. I looked around, trying to calm myself by telling myself it was just a dream and I would wake up soon. That helped ease my breathing a bit until I started hearing senseless whispers echoing in the room. Out of the corner of my eye, I looked for what was making those sounds, all the while internally wishing I’d just wake up already. But beside my bed, I saw the silhouette of something that seemed covered in fur. My breathing quickened; I wanted to scream, but I couldn’t even make a muffled noise. I glanced at the little table, but the doll was no longer there. In that short span of time, I felt something grab my legs and press them down—it was that thing climbing on top of me. I could see more of its furry appearance, with short arms and long legs. It seemed to have several patches where it had no fur, showing bare and seemingly torn skin. Little by little, it came closer to my face, and I saw those big black eyes. Trying not to look at them, I glimpsed at its left hand holding the doll. Suddenly, I felt the creature’s other hand grab my hair as it began to smile—such a disturbing smile. That thing wasn’t human or anything I had ever seen before. Out of nowhere, I began to hear it whisper, even though it was still next to me. I couldn’t understand anything it said, but that no longer mattered when I started to feel the tips of its nails digging into my head. I woke up; my mother had woken me.

It seemed like just another morning. Everything was normal. My mom woke me up, telling me to get up for breakfast. My mother noticed I was confused and asked if something was wrong, to which I said it was nothing, just a bad dream. She kissed me on the forehead and said, “Your father and I will be downstairs waiting for you with breakfast; don’t take long.” I felt more relieved knowing it had all been a dream. My mother left, and I went to look at my phone. The doll wasn’t there, just a strange drawing that showed a silhouette very similar to that of the doll. All of a sudden, the spot where that thing had dug its nails started to hurt. I felt intense pain in my leg and the back of my neck, so I decided to check myself. My leg had nail marks, and on the back of my neck, I could feel a bit of blood where the marks were. I washed my head to get the blood off and went downstairs. I saw my parents and decided not to tell them anything about that nightmare, and we carried on with the day as if nothing had happened.

After breakfast, my father mentioned that he couldn’t find the owner of the doll, so I could keep it if I wanted, as it seemed like I had grown attached to it. I decided to just respond with a simple “okay,” knowing that I no longer had the doll and with so many thoughts running through my head at that moment. I finished breakfast and returned to my room. I stored the drawing in a box and left it at the back of my closet. Nothing happened that night, nor on the nights that followed, so I felt safer, but I still fear waking up in the middle of the night and starting to hear those senseless whispers. The day that happens, I’ll know that thing has come back for me.
