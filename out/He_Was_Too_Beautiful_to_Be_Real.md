I met him through my best friend’s cousin. His name was Julian, and from the first message, he had this easy charm—like someone who’d always been good at making people feel seen. He told me he was into watersports, that he spent summers wakeboarding and jet skiing at his family’s lake house on Lake Erie. I imagined him sun-kissed and laughing, the kind of guy who could pull off both a wetsuit and a dinner jacket.

He came from money, but didn’t flaunt it. Just little things—mentioning the private dock, the vintage sailboat, the fact that he’d been “desperately searching for someone real” before we started talking. I was busy with work and school, stretched thin and emotionally threadbare. But he seemed grounded, maybe even lonely too. I figured I had nothing to lose.

We talked every day. He asked thoughtful questions, remembered the smallest details, and made me laugh when I didn’t think I could. He said he wanted to meet soon, maybe halfway between our cities. I started to picture it—us, together, maybe even on that lake.

Then he ghosted me.

Eight days. No explanation. Just silence.

When he finally messaged me again, he apologized vaguely and said he’d started seeing someone else. I felt foolish. But part of me still wanted closure. So when he suggested we meet anyway—just as friends—I agreed.

We met in a quiet lakeside town. He was even more beautiful in person. Movie-star beautiful. His skin was flawless, his eyes a strange shade of gold-green, and his smile… it was mesmerizing. But something about him felt too perfect. Like he’d been sculpted, not born.

We walked by the water, talked about life, and he showed me pictures of his lake house. It was massive—almost palatial. He said it had been in his family for generations, but they rarely aged. I laughed, thinking it was a joke.

That night, he invited me to stay at the lake house. Just one night. Just to see it.

I said yes.

The house was stunning. Antique mirrors lined the halls, and the air smelled faintly of salt and lavender. But the longer I stayed, the more I noticed things that didn’t make sense. The mirrors didn’t reflect me quite right. The photos on the walls were all of women—beautiful, smiling, frozen in time.

Julian grew quieter. More intense. He watched me like he was memorizing my face.

Late that night, I wandered into a locked room he’d forgotten to secure. Inside was a mirror unlike the others—tall, ornate, and pulsing faintly with light. And in it, I saw her.

A woman. Young. Radiant. Trapped.

She mouthed something I couldn’t hear. Her eyes pleaded.

Behind me, Julian spoke.

“She was lonely too. Like you. Like all of them.”

I turned. His face was different—older, flickering between decades. He stepped closer.

“I don’t take souls. I preserve them. Beauty fades. Connection fades. But this… this lasts.”

I ran. I don’t remember how I got out, only that I didn’t stop until I saw headlights on the highway.

Weeks later, I tried to look him up. No trace. No social media. No property records. Just a single article from 1973 about a missing girl last seen near a lake house on Erie.

Sometimes, I still get messages from him. Sweet. Thoughtful. Like nothing ever happened.

I never reply.

But when I pass a mirror, I look twice. Just in case someone else is looking back.
