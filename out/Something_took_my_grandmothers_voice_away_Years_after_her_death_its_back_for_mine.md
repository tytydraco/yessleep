I’ve always hated that chair. It's an old, heavy wooden thing with curved arms and faded green cushions, a creaky rocking-armchair. 

My grandmother used to sit there every night, knitting or doing something that looked like experienced needlework, though I never saw her actually make anything. She never shared what she had made with me. I doubt if she even had any finished pieces.

The yarn never turned into a sweater, a scarf, or even any woven shape. It just… vanished. She would always pull and pull from that black ball of yarn, hum a little under her breath - and by morning the strand would be gone. The needles would clack, the chair would creak, and she’d hum - always the same three notes, low and slow.

Grandmother died when I was nine. She was in perfect health, then gone. The doctors said it was her heart, but my mother said she “just stopped speaking one day and never started again.” She *could* talk... but just not voluntarily. I didn't understand what that was supposed to mean.

I remember overhearing my uncle talk about what were presumably, her last "words" (or mutterings): *Fantasma.*

No one ever came to know what it meant. My family is old, rich, and secretive - most of our conversations are polite lies in large rooms. I grew up in that house feeling almost invisible, like my voice never really... reached anyone. It’s strange, but I think my grandmother felt the same way.

Because before she died, she stopped talking altogether.

The chair stayed with us. My parents kept it in her old room at the end of the hall, beside the window that looks out over a garden. Nobody sat in it anymore. It just… existed, collecting sunlight & dust.

One night, a few weeks ago, when I couldn’t sleep, I walked past that room and saw it rocking.

Not violently. Just a slow, steady back-and-forth like you'd see in stop-motion.

*Creak... Pause.. Creak... Pause.. Creak.*

I told myself it was the wind, or maybe I was just seeing and hearing it move in the dark. But when I stepped inside, the chair stopped like it acknowledged my presence.

I remember briefly seeing a faint outline of my grandmother rock the chair as if she was doing her needlework. I got a terrible feeling of something watch me from the corner of the room by the rocking chair, though I couldn't intelligibly make of any silhouettes. 

I couldn't stand there any longer - I left that room almost immediately. 

I didn’t tell anyone. It felt too stupid to say anything out loud.. who would believe me? But every night after that, I’d hear it again, faintly through the thin walls. The sound of something moving just enough to be.. alive.

A few mornings later, I mustered up the courage to investigate that room.

My grandmother’s things were still there. Drawers full of tiny scissors, half-burned wax candles, colored lace, her photographs - what not.

Almost by chance - at the back of her old wardrobe, wrapped in tissue - I found a single ball of black yarn, perfectly wound, as if it had been waiting. Next to it lay her knitting needles - thin, silver, and slightly warm to the touch.

I felt the urge to sit on that armchair and do some needlework all-day suddenly as I saw the equipment. I didn't know how to knit in the first place.

My mind threw intrusive thoughts at me, almost urging me to take a seat and begin. I grew too curious of my grandmother's half-ritual, the yarn - and the gnawing feeling in my chest.

The same curiosity got the better of me that night.

After a whole day of trying to take sides within myself, I brought the yarn and needles to the chair and sat down. It felt… wrong immediately. Soon, I started mimicking some basic motions I remembered - looping, threading, pulling. The yarn slid and vibrated through my fingers like smoke. My hands began to move faster, like something invisible was guiding them.

I began to hum involuntarily, like I was being forced to. My throat started to itch from the dryness.

It was the same tune my grandmother would hum, those same three low notes. The air started to feel still as I continued.

The yarn didn’t seem to ever end. No matter how much I pulled, it just kept coming. My fingers started to hurt and feel brittle, but I couldn’t stop. It felt like if I did, something terrible would happen... like I’d drop a thought that wasn’t mine and lose it forever.

Soon enough, everything around me began to change.

The air bent. My head was filled with noise - whispers in languages I didn’t recognize, images I couldn’t understand. My grandmother’s voice as I could recall it was somewhere in there too - distant but pleading. I could see flashes of her sitting here, night after night, her eyes rolled back as people surrounded her - writing, listening, whispering amongst themselves.

They weren’t worshipping her. They were *learning.*

Because maybe somehow, the yarn wasn’t just yarn... it was thought, memory. Something that shouldn't belong in any human's hands.

I don’t remember when I blacked out. I just remember my hands shaking terribly, the needles clattering to the floor - and the sound of the chair crashing as it fell behind through my weight. I felt it slowly recover automatically from the fall as my vision drifted into a dark, dreamless curtain of sleep.

When I opened my eyes, there was someone - no, something - standing right in front of me.

A shadow that looked like a faceless person - tall, thin, beckoning; its edges shivering. It didn’t move, but I felt it breathing. It was bowing, as if in some sort of twisted reverence - almost deliberately. It had extended a hand toward me.

It waited there for a while. I sat there in dread, trying to figure out what it was. It didn't move at all - just beckoned patiently.

I snapped into trance, and I don’t know why I touched it... maybe I wasn’t really in control anymore.

When my fingers met its hand, its chest slowly split open. Inside it morphed into a corridor stretching forever - walls lined with moving patterns of yarn, each thread stretched impossibly. Distorted faces flickered within them. Eyes opened and closed. I could hear a thousand voices whispering in unison, *“You called me. You continued the weave.”*

Then came the pain... like my skull was unraveling, being hollowed and filled forcefully from the inside.

Images poured in - my grandmother, maybe even my great-grandmother, and many women I couldn’t recognize, all sitting in that same chair - all knitting, all humming - people surrounding them as if they were drawing knowledge from an oracle.. 

The yarn looped from one pair of hands to another through time, never dying.

They weren't knitting clothes. They were making a door.

And maybe now it was my turn to keep it open.

When I woke up, it was morning. Blood had dried under my nose, my ears were ringing, and the yarn was gone. I could hear a distant bell ring a heavy, low thud in my head.

The chair sat still in the room that now smelled of iron and lavender. I was on the floor by the corner of the cabinet, my legs twisted - almost broken painfully.

When I tried to speak, my voice came out wrong - hoarse, cracked. 

...

Every day since then.. it’s gotten quieter. 

I've tried checking up medically - the doctors say it’s stress; vocal fatigue, nothing serious. But I know what it is.

The same thing that took my grandmother’s voice.

*Fantasma.*
