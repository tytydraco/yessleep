I should never have let him in. I knew it then and I damn well know it now, but hindsight’s a bitch. I keep telling myself that if I had just ignored the banging on my door, if I had just stayed my ass in bed…well, maybe none of this would be happening to me.

But guess what I did?

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

It was around 3am, a few nights ago, and I was lying in bed doom scrolling as usual. You know, typical night owl behavior. I live alone in a one-bedroom near Dallas: nothing to write home about, but it’s been home for about 3 years now, peeling paint, busted blinds and all.

I had just decided to put my phone down and try to get some sleep (for probably the 10^(th) time) when the banging started. Not knocking, mind you, but *banging*. Desperate, frantic, as if someone were throwing their whole-body weight against the door.

The first thought that crossed my mind was “*oh shit, someone’s being chased!”*

The second was *“why me?”*

But that sound…that banging? You can’t really fake that type of frenzy.

So against the better voices in my head, I got out of bed, walked out into the living room and opened the door.

Standing outside on my “unless you have pizza, go away” door mat was a guy probably around my age: mid-twenties, maybe. He was pale, gaunt (in the sense that he could use a pizza himself…) and his eyes were bloodshot as if he hadn’t slept in days.

The clothes he was wearing looked…odd, to be PC about it. He was wearing torn boots laced with wire, a jacket patched by hand, stitched together with varied pieces fabric that didn’t go together at all, and on the sleeve was an insignia which looked military in nature, half-burned away as if someone tried to erase it and only partially succeeded.

He startled and stared at me as if *I* were the one causing a ruckus in the middle of the night on a Thursday.

“They said I’d land in *before*,” he rasped, his voice sounding cracked and in need of hydration. “Is this before?”

“Erm…” I laughed nervously, peering outside to see if someone were filming this as some sort of weird tiktok trend. “I’m sorry, before what? Do you know what time it is?”

Without warning, he pushed past me, barreling into my apartment, and I immediately went into *oh shit* mode.

“Hey, whoa my guy! You can’t just come in here. Who the hell are you?”

As he was scraping past me, I caught a whiff of him and boy did he smell. Like a mixture of smoke and iron…but not any sort of iron I’d ever smelled before. It was a chemical-y smell, acrid, like burnt circuitry mixed with wet earth and something coppery…blood, maybe?

He peered around my living room like an awestruck tourist, his body shaking, though I couldn’t tell if it were from fear or some weird kindof excitement. He went around the room, touching my lamp, my phone charger, even a pile of assorted junk mail sitting on the coffee table.

He stopped and looked at me, a grin slowly spreading across his manic face. “Still work,” he whispered, more to himself than to me. “There’s still electricity, still light.”

I cleared my throat and repeated myself, asking who he was and if he were in some sort of trouble or danger.

He froze, his eyes filling with tears, and then he smiled. A broken, horrible smile.

“You don’t have them yet. They haven’t come.”

“What don’t we have?” I asked, starting to get annoyed.

He was bouncing with what I assumed was happiness at this point. “The Flags.”

He stopped, his voice dropping into something barely audible.

“You’ll know them when they come…same flag on every house, in every classroom, waving in every patch of sky they can reach. They watch you through it, your every single move. The flags aren’t fabric – it’s an *eye*, somehow…you look at it once and you can feel them looking back, watching.”

My stomach twisted, and my annoyance grew.

But he continued, seemingly impervious to the look of irritation I knew was written on my face. “They…they take the children first. One morning, buses came and picked them up, but never brought them home. Feeds on all security cameras went dark. They said the kids were being *re-educated*. That word means something terrifying there.”

Then he grabbed my wrist, his grip ice-cold against the warmth of my own skin. He held my wrist so tightly that I couldn’t pull away.

“Don’t let them tell you that safety is worth obedience,” he whispered, his voice dropping even lower. “That’s how it all starts. Curfews, registries…neighbors disappearing until people simply stop asking questions. And then—”

He stopped, mid-sentence, a look of renewed horror etching itself upon his face. His whole body began to shudder and shake violently, to the point I thought maybe he was OD’ing or having a seizure or something. His mouth remained open, but no words came out.

At that moment, the lights in my apartment begin to flicker and buzz but not like some normal power surge. The bulbs dimmed *red*, twice, like some sorta fucked up electrical heartbeat.

He panicked, and blood began to pour from his nose and down his face, dripping onto his clothes and then onto my carpet.

“hey! Oh my god, are you okay?! I’m going to call 911—”

“NO!”

He gripped my wrist even tighter, trying to pull me closer to him. My flight-or-flight instincts began to kick in, and my body was wanting to choose fight. I balled my fists, preparing to defend myself if need be, though I’m no fighter by any means and was more or less counting on him being weak due to his size.

“Let me go, now.”

“Oh god, no!” He was ignoring me now, due to  the skin blistering around his mouth as if he’d touched something corrosive to his lips. He began clawing in his jacket, fumbling around for something when he suddenly pulled out a small black cube, about the size of a car key fob. Coming from the cube was a humming noise, as if it held a trapped insect of some kind.

He shoved into my hands roughly, his skin literally cracking and burning where it held the cube, but he didn’t let it go until I took hold of it.

“If it hums again, *don’t answer it*, no matter what!” he commanded, his voice all of a sudden resolute. “Curiosity may get the better of you, and you may think it’s me. But it’s not me. They wear us like clothes.”

“What the fu—”

Without waiting to answer any sort of questions or to elaborate (as if anything he’d said up to this point made a lick of sense), he turned to my front door, closed it, turned and looked at me, blinked twice, then opened the door again and stepped through it.

Only…he didn’t step outside.

Instead, I swear to all that’s holy, I saw space *bend* around the frame of my front door and beyond, as if the air were water and he was slipping beneath the surface. And the sound was like the tearing of fabric. But then he was gone.

I stood there, dumbstruck, sure that maybe I was the one on drugs (though I definitely was not) and this was just a really strange trip.

A solid five minutes passed before I caught myself and slowly walked over to the door and poked my head through it, looking uneasily around the empty corridor.

He was definitely gone.

For a brief moment I thought maybe I’d just had some sort of waking dream and that everything that just happened were a figment of my imagination. But I looked down at my hand and I was still clasping that little black cube, which had fallen silent.

Just for shits and giggles, I looked outside one more time and then slammed the door shut and locked every lock on it, and then sunk to the floor, my back resting against it.

“What the actual *fuck* just happened?”

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I didn’t get any sleep that night. The smell of the guy lingered in my apartment until well past dawn. No amount of febreezing helped.

I put the cube on my coffee table and left it there. It’s actually pretty heavy, unnaturally so, for its size, and the edges are sharp…sharp enough to cut you if you hold it the wrong way. It hasn’t made a single sound since the man forced it onto me and then vanished. But as I’ve sat and watched it, sometimes I think I hear a faint scratching sound, like fingernails on glass.

I don’t know what to do with it. Google’s been unhelpful in identifying it and chatgpt says I should either destroy it or take it to the cops. I thought about hiding it away and just forgetting about it, but I don’t know.

Part of me is intrigued by it.

And then part of me wants to believe that it was just the ramblings of some random, insane dude who, for whatever reason, happened to stumble into my apartment building (which is code-locked now that I remember…). Maybe he *was* on drugs of some kind or maybe he was in the grips of some sort of manic paranoia.

But I can’t stop thinking of the way the world looked when he just disappeared. And his words still ring in my ears, leaving tinges of fear and uncertainty:

“You’ll know them when they come.”

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This all happened a few nights ago...and for the first couple of days, the cube was just that: a cube. Silent, still, just a weird thing taking up space on my table. 

Then, late last night...it hummed. I heard it from my bedroom. It was just once, but it was enough. The sound was low, like a bass note I could literally feel in my teeth. 

I slowly walked into the living room, wielding a plastic cosplay sword (you know, to do some damage if need be) but the living room was still. 

I looked at the cube from a distance, but didn't touch it. I somehow felt that would result in my "answering it," which the dude explicitly instructed me *not to do*. 

But as I was looking at it, I think for a split second I saw something shift across its surface. Not a reflection but almost as if...something inside were pushing outward. 

Oh and that scratching sound I was hearing? Yea, it's gotten louder now. I can't tune it out no matter what I do. 

I don't know what the fuck is going to happen when/if it hums again, and I'm almost sure that I definitely do not want to know...
