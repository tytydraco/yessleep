Through my peephole, I saw that it was still there. The flayed skin glistened under the dim glow of the hanging incandescent lightbulb. It knew I was watching and came close until the peephole framed only its visage. The conjoined faces of my neighbors stared into me, with mouths that might’ve been kissing once, it grinned or tried to. Their tongues had fused to become fat and forked and it now used them to lick at the glass of my peephole.

It pulls back without warning and once more I get a good look at it. Two human forms smashed together. The smaller one clinging to the larger one’s torso, resembling a gibbon and her young but distorted into something fleshy and vile. I can see the sinew of its exposed muscles, the blood vessels, and the flaps of flesh that hang off it. I can see the hanging skinned testicles on the larger body and can see that the clinging body grinds itself into him where their groins meet. But whether it’s in agony or ecstasy I can’t tell.  It runs off into the dark corners of the hallway but I’m not fooled. I know it’s trying to lure me out and I don’t want to find out why.

I need your help, please. I’m trapped on the 4th floor of  Rochester Heights, in room 405, a dilapidated highrise Apartment in east Oakland. Within the last 6 hours, at what must have been dead midnight, something horrible happened. Whether it was an invading force or a corrupting evil I don’t know, but I can’t leave and my room is the only safety I have. And even then I don’t know how long until it gets in. I’ll have to go back, recount all that’s happened leading up to this, and maybe, just maybe, someone can help me.

It all started with that damn fetish. Not the sexual perversion type, no it was an idol. It was 4 a.m. and I was about to throw in a load of laundry before I was off to bed and there it was. Splayed out smack dab in the middle of our laundromat, still slick with blood. I didn’t know what I was looking at, some spindly thing strung up to a wooden crescent frame. But with each passing second more of its form registered in my mind and I nearly doubled over and lost my breakfast at the realization that it was a skinned headless dog, crucified.

The cops were called and it was found out that the new cameras were touted by management and used as a justification for another yet another outrageous rent hike…was nothing more than a “deterrent.”  As in they’re useless and not even hooked up to a power source. They’ve let my bathtub sink halfway into the room underneath me so while it was infuriating, I wasn’t surprised.

Later it came to be known that the dog was Mrs. Lorent's beloved poodle, Butterball. The poor widow was hysterical and demanding a full-scale investigation. She might have gotten her way had nightfall not greeted us with yet another fucked up finding. Harold, a shut-in who lived on the top floor was found dead.

I’m a night owl through and through, so I was awake when the discovery was made. There was no commotion but hushed whispers and tensed bodies. I tend to creep around the stairwell between the 4th and 3rd floor since it’s scarcely populated and has a small accessible window that I can smoke out of. I was trying to fish for a signal this time since my wifi was acting up and my cell signal was dead altogether. That's when I heard them walking down the stairs, talking. Eleana and Macey from the 4th floor. I could tell from their tone of voice something was wrong, that and the time. 2 a.m. No one but me was up this late here most days. I strained my ears to listen in.

“Folded like a fucking pretzel and there was a mess everywhere. Tony says he thinks he’s been there since they found the hag’s dog in the laundromat. He tried calling the cops but it’s not going through.” Eleana was whispering to Macey

“Well, who was it?” Macey asked.

“That creep Harold from the 2nd floor. The one that Carter beat up for stalking his girlfriend, what was her name?... John?”

“It’s Joanna, don’t be mean, this is serious. What did Tony do about the body?”

“Sorry, I just think she’s frumpy and plain. Way out of Carter’s league. And nothing, yet. He told the manager and he tried calling the police too but no luck. He wants the body out of here as soon as possible so he sent Tony out to the station in person. But it’s been 2 hours since and he hasn’t even texted me once. I’m starting to get worried.”

“Wanna go look for him?”

“No, that would be dramatic of me, we’re not even dating, just messing around. Still… You know the Donut Royal is open 24/7. We can get a few and meet Tony halfway there.”  Eleana said, and the two started walking down the stairs.

I froze and the thought to try to sneak away came to me too late. The two women didn’t even acknowledge me as they walked past me. I knew 3 things then. That Eleana is fucking our maintenance man, that I’m either invisible or detestable enough to be invisible, and that Harold was dead. I wouldn’t know it then but I would learn later that night that this was just the beginning of a nightmare.

I finished my cigarette and sulked back upstairs, still unaware that anything was wrong. I should have paid attention more to my surroundings during my trek because I’m certain by then it had started. I only picked up on the fact that every light was dimmer, not by much but enough for it to be noticeable.

I went back to my room, bolted the door, and tried getting my laptop to connect to the internet again. The only two pages it loaded up were ones I already had open before the wifi shat out. Reddit, and a random porn site that only played a very low-quality section of a video I was trying to get off to. It wasn’t cutting it so I decided to use my imagination but after 15 minutes and a cramped hand, I decided to try to settle in for an early night.

I gave it up after 45 restless minutes and pressed my ear to the wall next door. The couple there, Joanna and Carter, were young and hot-blooded fucking all hours of the night, and I had gotten off to the sounds a few times. Sometimes they went at it around the building in communal spaces they thought were empty late hours of the night. I had caught them a few times but it was never reciprocated. They’d finish and sheepishly walk away and none were wiser of my presence. Now they were quiet except for the natural shifts and breathing that came with sleep.

I wondered if they knew Harold was dead, and I wondered how’d they react when they found out. I wasn’t there for the supposed blowout between him and Carter, but I had heard about it. Macey and Eleana love to gossip above my smoking spot. I think Harold caught them like I had and the poor fellow, trapped within the cage of his delusions, confronted Carter. Everyone knew he had a thing for Joanna, and she was too polite or sympathetic to ever be stern with him. So he must’ve interpreted it as reciprocation and it ended with him getting stomped out and the residents being quietly grateful for it.

Poor Harold, in his mid-40s and living with his geriatric mother because he was too messed up in the head to go anywhere else. Mary was her name I think and then I felt a horrible tinge of guilt. Did she know of her son's death and where was she? I hoped she had her mind completely slipped away tonight so that she couldn’t comprehend what had happened to Harold.

I used to fear ending up like him the most, but that was before tonight. Sleepless and frustrated I felt the ache for another cigarette and I went for a smoke. I pondered why no one else was freaking out about his death or why it was being kept secret. I didn’t consider it until then but if he was dead and he truly died in such an agonized way… who had done it? And were they still around? Cold sweat trickled down my face at the question and I felt compelled to turn around and head back to my room.

After two more steps, I decided to do just that but something else was off. The hallway was darker now, much more than before and the air was cold in a way that’s hard to describe, it’s bitter chilling piercing straight into nerve and bone. Vertigo threatened to overcome me with each passing moment as the persuasive wrongness intensified. I couldn’t define it at first but as I kept walking it became clear, the hallway was longer than it should've been. I froze, unable to make sense of that fact and I scrutinized my surroundings a bit more. The ceiling was higher too, by a few feet. My mouth was dry now and I tried to swallow but nothing could bring me back to lucidity.

Foot over foot I forced myself to walk back towards my room and I was halfway there when once more my heart stilled in abject fear. At the end of the hallway, from the 5th floor, someone was descending the stairs. Rational thought should have driven me to head toward them and ask or warn them about what was happening. But some deep instinct knew it was wrong in all the ways a living thing could be. Even the stairs leading up to the upper floors felt wrong as if they weren’t of this world.

I’d have to get closer to this approaching thing If I wanted to get to my room so I turned back around and tried to dash as silently but quickly as possible down the hall but feared I would be spotted before I could fling myself down them.

A storage closet to my right that was never locked served as my refuge and I tried to slink into it as quietly as possible. The closet used a repurposed apartment door so it had a peephole for me to gaze out of. Minutes passed by at an agonizing pace but it did eventually come into view. From the periphery it emerged, robed in ornate cloth and moving as if it were dancing on air. Upon looking down I saw that it was skating across the air, legless and floating. From its hood a strange blinking light cast out onto the dark hallway. As it was at eye level with me and directly in front of me I caught a side profile of its face and I held my breath to stifle a gasp.

Its face was like TV static, flickering in black-and-white chaos. I closed my eyes then, fearing that it would turn to face me and I’d get an unadulterated look at it. In the still moments, as I waited for it to fling the door open, I thought back to all the other strange shit I had heard about leading up to now. Tony had found nearly a dozen dead animals around the apartment perimeter in the last few days, he didn’t want to talk about the state he found them in, and I wondered if they were anything like butterball, skinned and crucified.

I waited until my body ached and I mustered the courage to peer into the hole once more. An empty hallway greeted me and I slowly opened the door and crept my way out. This floor was only occupied by me, Macey, Eleana, Carter, and Joanna. I went to their door and caught myself when I went to knock. I hesitated for a moment before I tried the knob. I winced as it creaked open and I made my way in, trying to close the door as quietly as possible. I called out for them in a hushed voice but as I looked around their empty living room I felt silly. Before I left I decided to check their room, someone needed to know about the wrongness of what was happening, and I still don’t know what the fuck is happening.

I didn’t recognize them at first, I thought it was a pile of blankets but as the heavy movement and labored breath caused something to click in my head I couldn’t stifle the yell. It caused the head, or more aptly, heads to snap up to face me and I had no delusions of what it was. Carter and Joanna permanently joined at their groins, chest, and mouth. They had been fucking missionary when it happened so Carter had his body draped over Joannas and her arms and legs clasped around his torso, waist, and ass. I thought they had been flayed at first but the more I looked the more it seemed like the flesh had sloughed off them.

They… it hoisted itself up on all fours if you can call it that, and let out a breathy moan in both male and female voices. The conjoined mouth grinned at me and as it took a step towards me I finally snapped out of it. We both ran at the same time but it was slowed by it’s deformed mass, but the distance between us was still too close for any comfort as I ran out into the hallway and towards my room.

I thanked God that I hadn’t locked my door as I threw it open and turned to slam it shut. I screamed the moment I was face to face with the abomination, and without a moment to spare I bolted and locked it. It tried the knob a few times before it resorted to gentle taps and then deafening pounding and then silence. Now it’s just waiting there for me but what I fear most is that whatever did that to them will come around, lured by its presence, and do the same to me.

It’s been hours since but the sun has not risen. I tried sleeping in the bathtub, I couldn’t stand the proximity of my bed to Joanne’s and Carter's. But when I stepped in I remembered that half the tub couldn’t support my weight as water damage had left it half sunk into the floor. So I went back to the living room and saw my laptop still sitting there with this webpage open. Please if anyone can help me or has any ideas, nows the fucking time. I don’t know how much longer I have left, just now I decided to peer out my window and was greeted by stygian darkness but what really scares me is the few breaks in it. Occasionally lighting flashes across the sky and illuminates the world below, a lifeless sand sea. Lighting cut through in brilliant flashes, stained by black and white patterning like TV [static.](https://www.reddit.com/r/grimoireofmadness/)
