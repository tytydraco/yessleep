When I was a kid I would often have random surges of fear. I’d collapse, sobbing, my head filling with image after image of the earth opening up and swallowing me whole. During that time of my life I was quite the crybaby. When people think the world is ending, when they have a gun in their face, they gain a certain cadence and pitch in their voice that is simply uncomfortable to be around. So after a few breakdowns I quickly found myself being out of any groups in school.  
  


In addition to being a crybaby I was also an idiot. My mother and father tried very hard to get me on track with my education. They delayed me entering kindergarten as long as they could. Multiple private tutors and experts were brought in. They were well off and I was their only child, so they spent a lot of money and time in their attempts to help me. It didn’t work. By the time I was in 2nd grade I had been held back twice.



I managed to not fall further behind after that but I believe in hindsight it was mainly due to pity. At that time in my life I was a cute kid who tried his best. It makes sense that eventually the idea that all I needed was a little more time would become less and less believed until they just decided to pass me on through the system and hope.



At the end of my 4th grade year I was already 13 years old. During the summer my family would take a week to visit my grandparents who lived near the upper peninsula in Wisconsin. Their house was on a slope with two floors. No stairs existed except on the outside of the house. Meaning you would have to go outside to go from one section to the other. The top section had a large porch that created shade for the bottom sections. Attached to the top of that section were two different sized swings and a bench. They hung from the wood and would often move slowly with the gusts of wind that happened to wander by.



It was in one of those swings that I decided to play one of my favorite games. If you close your eyes and press gently against your eyelids you’ll start to see blue patterns form. I was easily entertained. It was night, and I was basking in the adrenaline rush of being out past my bedtime. It was maybe a half hour of pressing against my eyelids before I heard it.



The wind under the wind.



Between my protective parents and relatively young age I didn’t have any reference to compare how I felt at that moment. Now however, I can find the words to attempt so. Many years after this event I stumbled upon a story about a man who was recounting his struggles with heroin. And in that story he said a quote that I feel can help you understand me: The worst part about doing heroin for the first time, is that you can’t do it again.I bolted out of the swing, my body spinning from the sudden shift from pulsing blue lines to desperate searching. That cowardly little boy didn’t take so much as a second to walk into those dark woods.



My gut was pulled by a thread. The underlying wind would take that thread in its current and I went where it told me. I had walked for over a mile but soon enough I found the source.



On the forest floor was a small hole. The moonlight was dim, but the small visibility was enough to see into when I positioned myself just right. It was somewhere else. Not a different location, but somewhere beyond. Over time I would come to call this hole in my head as “The other side”. On the other side was a cave with a path leading 40 feet down towards a dark liquid. It was impossible. I was looking down but drops of water fell onto the cave’s floor as if I was the one that was sideways



I wanted nothing more in the world but to go into that hole. That wind, that perfect engulfing wind, was louder than ever. But I knew that if I could only go to that other side I could hear it even clearer. My small arm was able to reach in but my body was far too large. When I tried to dig into the ground to create a bigger entrance I found that the gap never got any bigger. When I dug around it the rest of the hold was just dirt. I even dug under the original hole. The gap simply floated above the newly formed gap. The other side had one entrance, and it came in only one size.



The sound started to waver. I had lost my concentration trying to find a way in that I was losing that current. For hours I simply stared into the hole. I knew that if I left I would be able to find my way back. But eventually I had to go home.



I spent the next few days trying to recreate the series of events so I could go back. But it never worked. My parents tried to cheer me up but I never told them why I was so upset. My dad had to pry me from the swingset when it was time to go home.



A month later I had almost convinced myself that it was all a dream. So in order to attempt to hear that wind again I spent almost all my free time lying in my bed trying to fall asleep. My bed was in the basement of my parent’s house. At the base of the stairs going down was a wall to the right that extended only a few feet. This created a small square of space that you could see at the top of the stairs or from the main basement room itself. You could only see that space from midway on the stairs or when you were in the space yourself.



I was staring at my alarm clock, its red numbers taunting me, when I tried one more time to hear that wind. No matter how hard I tried it didn’t come back to me, but after enough time I managed to hear something else. In that corner at the end of the stairs I heard something breathing.The breaths of an Angel sound like a fraction of the wind on the other side. I cried. I cried as silently as I could as I savored the sound like a starving man sucking on bone marrow.



In our world a perceptual bistability exists that is constant, staggering in its enormity, and above all else: beautiful. Just like other ambiguous stimuli, once you know what to look or listen for you can train yourself to notice the other forms, you can hear the other side.



When I calmed down I stood up and walked to the corner. The breathing remained steady. But when my head looked around to that gap at the bottom of the stairs nothing was there. And much worse, the breathing had stopped. Quickly I went back to my bed and closed my eyes. Now that I heard it I knew what to listen for. This time I was able to find it again. My ears quickly became able to cross over to the other side. I couldn’t have been happier. The world around me changed. I felt safe. No matter where I was, if I started to feel scared or worried I could listen and know that around the corner was my guardian angel.



It was already halfway through summer when I started to be able to hear my Angel. But in that remaining half I underwent changes at a rapid pace. Physically I went through what my mother described as the fastest puberty ever seen. My voice cracked and repaired itself in a six hour period. I became tall. I was always bigger than the other kids in my grade due to the extra years but now I had suddenly sprung up to over 6 feet tall in the blink of an eye. My body put on muscle easily. My face had become sharp and handsome. If my parents had not watched it happen in person I’ve no doubt they would have never recognized me.



But that wasn’t the largest change. Not even close. I spent my time that summer reading. Reading so much that eventually it became a second nature to me. For the first time in my life when I looked at something on paper I was able to learn from it. What amazed my mother even more was that I called the school on my own accord and scheduled an exam to see if I could move up to my proper grade.



When I went back to school the old me may as well have been dead. I had been moved up all the way to 8th grade. My parents were so proud and for the first time in my life I wasn’t the oldest person in my class. I wasn’t behind. In fact I had moved ahead.



In Welsh mythology a common story is one of a man who encounters a Tylwyth Teg. Sometimes the creature gives the man a purse that is never empty, sometimes its cattle that multiply endlessly. But the condition is always the same. The gift only lasts as long as you never tell anyone where it comes from. The man lives for a good while with respect and fortune. Then they start boasting and getting pressured to reveal the secret of their amassed wealth. Eventually they tell their tale about meeting the Tylwyth Teg and it all disappears.Writing this story now is the first time I’ve ever mentioned my Guardian Angel. I never wanted it to leave me. I never wanted to go back to who I was before I could hear it.



It was for this same reason I never went looking for that hole. Everything was fitting together and I didn’t want to endanger what had already been given to me.Over the 4 years I was in high school things only seemed to get better. I had friends. I was praised for my academic performance as well as recruited by every coach that set their eyes on me. My parents apologized to me that they hadn’t started saving for my college earlier. I didn’t blame them. I wouldn't have thought I would be going either. But they still were thinking about the old me. To everyone else it was clear I wouldn’t need savings to go to college. And sure enough I managed to get into the college of my choice free of charge. Within the first week of college I saw a pretty girl. And within another week she was looking up into my eyes with her arms wrapped around me and a beaming smile on her face. Her name was Amy.



However, I didn’t just get better in terms of social interaction and school work. I began to hear more and more from the other side. To hear my guardian angel I no longer needed to focus. In fact sometimes I needed to focus to hear things in our world. I began to notice that my Angel shifted. Sometimes the breathing was one single sound. But it would then go into a large choir, multiple breaths all coming out and gasping for air in a random chaos. They both sounded wonderful.



Two weeks ago I was enjoying that life. In my dorm room I was working on an assignment and listening to the shifting breaths of my Guardian Angel. When I was done I got up and began walking to where I was going to meet Amy. At that point I had been able to hear the Angel for over a decade. It had always disappeared when I went around the corner.



But this time it stayed. This time I could see it. It Shifted



One form was an enormous head, moon-grey and cratered with perfect uniform indentations. It radiated worship. It was worthy of worship. It needed worship. The world would be better if you worshiped it.



The other form had the outline of a human. It had the arms, legs, and torso of a man but a head made solely out of lips. No flesh in between, no teeth or tongue, just lips of different sizes sewn together. They tore at their seams, each trying to speak, but without any tongues or throat nothing emerged. They fought each other, each attempted syllable pulling taut the easily stretched flesh of its neighbor. Blood flowed from lips stretched too far, smiles would form on the lips of the victorious flesh as it watched the weaker writhe. From this form radiated fear.



I fell to my knees. The fluctuations were rapid. One to two and two to one, over and over. Time became irrelevant. One moment I was in front of the most wondrous and awful being imaginable, the next I was alone.



College was meaningless, Amy was meaningless, utterly meaningless, everything is meaningless. Not because nothing new is under the sun, but because what is here is nothing compared to what exists on the other side.



I could see it. A decade of hearing and practicing but now I could see it. The thread in my gut was pulled again. The wind was back and it pulled me by its current back to where I belonged. My feet began walking. I had taken only a few minutes to pack up my phone, a charger, and a few other things I thought I would need.



As I followed the thread I saw a bike locked next to one of the school buildings. I reached down to the metal lock, and I pulled it apart. It was easy. The weakness of the human form was slowly leaving whatever it was I had become.



For two weeks I biked around Wisconsin. I used my ears and the faint pulls of the wind to slowly triangulate a gap to the other side. My phone was used to map out where I had been so I would be sure to never waste my time going in a direction I had been before. I didn’t stop to eat, I didn’t stop to sleep. I didn’t need to worry about that sort of thing anymore. I didn’t belong in a world where such things existed. Amy attempted to contact me. Her messages were distracting and so I blocked her. My parents soon tried to reach me and they too were soon silent so I could do what really mattered.



Earlier today I found it. In the woods near the Upper Peninsula, exactly as I remembered it, was a small hole with the same 40 foot path and same dark pool. But as I looked into it now in the daylight I saw that on the tip of the pool, barely breaking out of the thick substance, was a hand. It was waiting for me. My guardian Angel had given me all these gifts so that I could go and take God’s hands into mine. I took my backpack off and put my phone through the gap and prepared myself for what came next.Blood didn’t matter anymore. My hand reached up and tore off my nose. The cartilage takes off peels of my flesh with its removal. I took it and pushed it through the hole.A ship in a bottle. At first it’s a marvel. How did they fit such an intricate and delicate object through that small opening? If you go over the idea in your head for some time you will think about a number of options. Maybe they built the glass around the ship? Maybe the bottle has a hidden mechanism that opens it up? But the actual answer is that the ship is taken apart, and fed into that small hole, piece by piece, before being reassembled on the other side.

My ears came off next. The pain of the tear itself was immense, but worse was the removal of the ability to hear the sound. But I knew that if I threw my ears into the hold I would be unable to stop myself from following through. Even in this new form I was still a sound junkie.



By the time I had finished ripping off my leg all the blood had flown out of me completely. I had to crush my bones to dust to shove it through. My other leg soon joined it. Then I divided my torso into several sections, crushed the bone and shoved it through as well. My left arm was fairly simple. But I knew that in order to get everything across I needed my right arm to go last. So I needed to prepare before I went any further. The back of my skull needed to be cracked open. It simply wouldn’t fit otherwise. My right hand gripped my skull strongly and simply tightened until it was done. I had not crushed the bone enough and it took a long time and the bursting of my left eyes in order to get it through.Eventually all that was left was to slam my one remaining arm against a rock until it was ready. Its writhing musculature struggled to find its way to the gap. But when it was close enough I simply opened my jaw and pulled it through.



Over the course of the next few hours I managed to become partially reconstructed. Right now my ears have fully attached and I can hear everything that exists in this place in its true form. My legs are almost done. And when they are I am going to walk this 40 foot path to that hand. I’m sure it’s going to take my hand and drag me down. This sound is not the end. There is something further.



As my last act before I go on and accept the final gift of my guardian angel I am writing this so that if anyone else hears the wind under the wind, or sees into the other side, you do not hesitate.



That world you live in now is nothing.
