When we lived in New Orleans, we had a nice little two-bedroom apartment. Just my girlfriend (now my wife) and I living together for over 4 years. The apartment was nice and spacious and came at a great price. We felt pretty lucky. I guess its relevant to mention that my wife works weekends sometimes and I don't. That means sometimes I get to hang out all day by myself. That particular morning I woke up early. Like really early, 5:30 am. It was a Sunday and to no avail my girlfriend wasn't in the mood for my "shenanigans," So I resigned myself to make some coffee and sit on my computer. Lazily browsing the internet.

It wasn't notable the first time, so I don't remember when I saw it, but in our little office space there was a closet. This was full of art supplies for my wife and cleaning supplies for me. The thing I noticed was it was ajar. Just a little bit. the smallest of cracks. I pushed the door closed without thinking twice and went to crack some eggs. Breakfast drew my wife out of her slumber and as she ate I left the dishes to "soak" and wandered back over to the bedroom and turned on the TV. She yelled bye on her way out and it wasn't long until I was alone. I was barely watching TV and scrolling through my phone, I didn't remember falling asleep but I must have. Dreaming of something chasing me, usually zombies or some variation. something about the psychology of your friends and loved ones betraying you and becoming a threat always shook me to my core.

My eyes snapped open and I thought I heard footsteps, I looked around and saw nothing. The clock said 9:00am. She wouldn't be back this early. Maybe it was just part of the dream. I sat back and tried to play some video games on the computer but nothing really scratched the itch I had. I glanced over and saw the door to the closet open again. just a crack, just large enough for someone to see through. I thought this to myself and gave myself goosebumps. Then shook my head. Nah I'm not interesting enough for someone to hide in my closet. I open the closet door to confirm my feelings. Nothing but a tray of paints that had gotten stale because someone forgot to put the caps back on, and a full vacuum that someone forgot to empty, I blamed both on my gf and closed the door closing it tightly and even giving it a light tug to make sure.

I walked back to the master bedroom to shower and looking over I saw the spare room closet door open. Just a crack, just a small hair open. I had the stomach drop panic moment. and tried to shake it off. Again who is going to hide in my little ass apartment? I walked over with the confidence of a high school jock in a 90s slasher, opened the door to the closet, and met with nothing but Christmas decorations and my interview suit. There wasn't enough room to even hide in the closet if you wanted to. I closed the door the same as the other closet tugging on the knob to make sure it was tightly closed. I then began to imagine what I would actually do if someone was in there. the answer is probably shit the bed and run.

The continued normally from there, I made lunch, played online with friends, and just loafed around the apt. My gf came home and we made dinner together. As we were getting ready for bed I remember the silly things happening this morning and looked over to see the spare room closet door open, just a little bit. just enough to watch someone from. I knew I closed it. I knew it couldn't just blow open on its own. I walked up and opened the door expecting something, but found nothing again. I pushed the suit back and rooted around, looking for some reason. Am I going crazy? I thought about saying something to my gf but didn't. Every time I walked by that room I checked and the door was latched closed, it never opened. The other closet remained closed too. I checked other parts of the apt, cabinets in the kitchen, spare bathtub, and master closet. Anywhere a person might hide. I never found anyone. I didn't sleep well that night, and woke up at the tiniest noise. every time I checked nothing. doors were firmly closed. I finally found some peace. and slept. That morning I woke up and found the front door was open, just a little bit. just a crack, just enough for someone to look in and see us.

We moved across the country. We have a house now and to my demand cameras cover all the entrances. I'm certain someone was in my apartment, but I can't prove it. my wife thinks I'm just paranoid and watched too many movies. but I know someone was opening doors.

(don't read if you want to keep the mystery...

I actually found out my wife whom I had lived with for 4+ years likes doors to be open because she thinks the closets smell stale when they're closed. She had been opening closet doors for years on me. I just hadn't noticed until I was home alone and a little paranoid. if you notice each open door lines up with a time she was home to this day I find closet doors that shouldn't be opened. Not lying about the cameras. Those are the only way I feel comfortable knowing its just her opening doors in my house. The front door was open that morning, it was probably just that we forgot to lock it and it blew open. right? right?)
