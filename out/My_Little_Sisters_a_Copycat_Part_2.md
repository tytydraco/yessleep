[My Little Sister's a Copycat : r/nosleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hkrhhu/comment/m3uyaa8/?context=3)

Okay, so I went through the scrapbooks and found something unusual. It looks like C has always been a copycat, but I just never noticed. It was easier to realize when looking at so many photos of her with the people she copied.

The earliest instance was when she was four. She was wearing the exact same dress as her friend B, and the two were in the exact same pose. B looks miserable while C is having the time of her life.

When I texted B about it, she said that she vaguely remembered C getting upset and wanting to match with her. It was B's birthday, and apparently, C had gone home to change after seeing that they didn't match. I know that sounds pretty insignificant, but I know her temper tantrums used to be almost violent when she was young. B said that C "accidentally" whacked her in the face with a branch because she didn't want to match.

The next time she copied was when she was eight, and it lasted for three years. It was with my friend, J. It was bizarre to see her dressed in a style so unlike her own. Boring black and white shirts and skirts, stuff a kid her age would rarely pick out for themselves. I always thought she loved pastels and flower prints and cute bows that shake with every step, but it turns out that I was wrong because that's what a cousin liked.

At eleven, she switched over to our cousin. After that, friend after friend, family member and family member, and now, it's my turn.

I'm actually more concerned now that I've found these photos. I don't know why she's doing this, but I don't think she has good intentions with it. Why do I think that?

Each person got hurt in some way once she was done copying them. B broke her leg, J nearly drowned, our cousin ended falling down and break both a leg and an arm, and one of our other cousins even got into a car accident. I asked around yesterday and used the scrapbooks to help confirm everything date-wise.

If this copying is the most extreme it's ever been, what will happen to me?

It doesn't help that she barely talks anymore, but when she does, she just echoes things I've said. I think she wants to be me. It's weird to even say that I'm scared of her. I've seen her cry at sad movies and want to pet every dog she sees, and she's always been my precious little goofball of a sister. I'd never want her to go away, but the way she stares at me is like I've committed a terrible crime and got acquitted. Like I'm a monster. Maybe I am.

I want to send her to our aunt's house or a friend or something else, but there's a part of me that's screaming to keep her close. I hate whatever the hell is going on, and I want it to stop.

Instead of posting the first part, I'm simply adding on because I messed up big time. 

  
I came home from a date and saw C on the couch. She was watching a movie, but I was taken aback when I got a good look at her. It was as though I had seen myself.

  
She looked exactly like me. Same hair, eyes, build, face, clothes, everything. When she said hi, it was an imitation of my voice that came out of her mouth. Even the movie was my favorite one, not hers. 

  
Dad came out of his bedroom and was shocked to see us, and he told me that he thought C had gone out. She just snickered and threw a pillow when he said that, and he thought we were playing a prank at first. I pulled him to the side to explain what I learned, and my distress must have made him realize I wasn't joking. He asked C why she was doing this, and she shrugged and said, "It's funny." 

  
I admit, I lost my temper and yelled at her to stop. She got pissed and said that I couldn't talk to her like that anymore, we yelled a lot more, and I ended up hitting her. I regret that so much. C was shocked and began to cry, and I realized what I had done and tried to apologize. She ran up to her room, and I just fell onto the couch and stared into space. 

  
I really didn't mean to hit her. It just happened.
