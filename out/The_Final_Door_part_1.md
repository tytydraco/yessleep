Hello there reader, i'm Dominic and today i'm starting this diary on my phone. Let me explain why. So, today at around 10:30 ish, I was hanging around with my friends. We had 3 days off school as it was a parents teachers meeting today, so we planned to do something crazy. We were gonna go to an abandoned building. 

We searched up on google the nearest abandoned place near us and it was this abandoned clothes factory for refugees during ww2. It was perfect as there were multiple floors to it and it was pretty far from people but not so far that it was hard to get to. 

My friend Mark just got his license, which meant he could drive us. I haven't gotten mine yet as i'm planning to suprise my girlfriend by asking her to prom in my new car I bought 2 days ago. It was gonna be perfect. 

Fred didn't have a reason like that, he wasn't good at staying still which meant that sitting in a car and not trying to touch and move everything in the car would kill him. 

We were on our way to the abandoned factory when our tires blew. It was a warning, I was stupid for not listening to god. We decided that we would call a tow truck later as we were so close and didn't want to ruin our night out. 

We all marked where the car was on our phones in order to get back to it later. We walked for probably about 8 minutes before we saw the factory in the distance. It was suprisingly big with walls made out of bricks that seemed like they were 200 years old. Strangely enough, it was like the universe kept telling us to stay away from this structure. 

We kept getting onto the wrong paths. We would lose our way when backtracking. That was until this old guy saw us. He was on the same path as us and was walking away from the factory. Once he saw us, he stopped. He closed his eyes and started praying or something. 

I thought he was praying to himself, but I know now that he was praying for us. He walked up and told us without giving a single chance for us to respond "Please, please, go back. Forget, forgetting is best". He was really strange so after he stumbled away, we just kept walking while taking note that the locals are a bit strange here. 

We finally reached the end of the trail and found the abandoned factory. The doors were open like it was inviting us in. Fred was so excited to be able to explore something like this and hopefully find ghosts that he sprinted into the building. Poor Fred, next time I saw him he was dead.  He ran out of sight when we heard a clanking sound. We followed where he went when we found where he was. 

Hung up on the ceilling like stars in the sky were his fingers and toes. His legs and arms were used as the feet of a chair in the middle of the room. His head was strung up on the wall like a deer head. His torso was mashed into bits and placed on the chair with some of the less balanced pieces dropping off the chair as we entered. 

Who could've done it this fast and what could've done this? Instead of standing still like charecters in horror films, both of our bodies somehow knew the danger we were in. Mark was slower then me as I was in the track and field club. 

I heard him scream and then the thud as he hit a floor deep down a deep hole that swallowed him. I ran and ran and ran, until I made it to the hallway leading to the entrance. It was so close, but I wasn't getting closer. 

The floor had become a treadmill and behind me was a hole of fire and spikes. If I stopped running, I would be dead. After 10 minutes of full on sprinting, I heard a sigh above my head. From the roof, another hole had formed.

 The sky above it was pitch black and it looked at me as if I was a doll. It was a giant clown with sewn lips and no eyes and then it  changed and became what I imagine Cthulu looks like. It changed every 5 seconds, on the dot. 

I was mesmorized, the floor was no longer a treadmill, yet I couldn't move. It grabbed me with it's infinite appendages and lifted me up. 

When my body touched the darkness, everything burned, cramped, twisted, froze, tore and broke all at the same time. I fell unconscious and when I woke up, I was in a room. 

It looks like a hotel room with 2 couches, a reception desk and some ancient carpets. I felt my phone in my pocket and turned it on. My battery said that it had unlimited charge. It had no wifi or reception icons. 

The only thing on the phone except the battery, date and time was a note app. I've written everything i've experienced since friday till now. 

What am I gonna do? What about my family and girlfriend? What about prom? Everything was going perfect in life, why has it gone bad now? And why does the only door leading out have a sign above it saying room 0?
