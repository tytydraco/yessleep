Merry Christmas. Currently, I'm out of town visiting my grandparents for the weekend, an occasion that I usually enjoy. However, the conversations always take an annoying detour when the conversation shifts to politics, leaving me on cousin duty while my parents engage in discussions about America falling apart with the extended family.  
  
This prompted my cue to retreat to a hiding place where I decided to check in with my friends through our group chat. The responses I received, though, were far from the expected festive updates of most Christmases. Sarah expressed being "tired," Mark described the day as "exhausting," and Austin declared himself "ready for a nap."  
  
I get that extended family drains energy quickly, but my suspicions prompted me to ask questions. It turns out that they, along with seemingly everyone in our small town outside of Seattle, had a peculiar dream last night. Austin  explained "And the crazy thing is, everyone can remember their dream so vividly. Like, usually when I dream I forget it within minutes of waking up. But I can still remember my dream perfectly."  
  
I've pushed my friends into sharing the specifics of their dreams, although they all were reluctant, like they're scared. To my surprise, the similarities are incredible, with only minor variations. The realization dawns on me – how is it possible for an entire town to share the same dream? It's just not possible. I don’t know, I’ll let you guys decide. 

  
From Austin: 

So, I stumbled into this eerie mountain town, never seen it before, with all these doors locked up tight. Yet, there's this unsettling Christmas music drifting from some hidden spot, like off in the distance somewhere. Determined to figure things out and find out where the hell I'm at, I wander around until I end up in this desolate, snowy field just outside of the town.   
  
Above, there's this damn enchanting yellow star. I can't put it into words, but there's something wicked about it, holding my gaze hostage. It was... just beautiful. Then, on the other side of the field, right beneath the ominous star, a dark figure emerges. I think he came from the ground because I didn;t see him walk over there or anything. So he was just standing there, motionless. Suddenly, the star overhead starts growing, blazing brighter. The snow beneath my feet turns into slush, and a massive heat starts creeping up on me. That dark figure that's just standing there? He breaks into this sinister cackle, like in a really creepy way.   
  
Suddenly, I drop onto the frozen ground, looking up at the sky. The cold night suddenly becomes day, and the star inches closer. Here's the wild part: I'm engulfed in flames, and I can FEEL IT. Like, I could actually feel the pain. Agonizing pain like I'm burning alive. And guess who appears over me? Mr. Tall and Lanky had suddenly teleported in front of me. He looked so strange, and he was wearing a suit. No pupils, just staring into the abyss. And then he grabbed me. 

I woke up in a cold sweat after that, I think it was 4 in the morning. Couldn't go to sleep after that. It's like a nightmare that won't let go.

From Sarah:   
  
I was lying in snow when I first started dreaming. I looked around me to find myself in a Forest, absolutely freezing as I was wearing only my pajamas and a t-shirt. God, I’ve never felt so cold in my life. I thought I was going to die. I then heard distant Christmas music and followed it though snow up to my knees until I could see a small town with an enormous Christmas tree in the center. It reminded me of Whoville, you know, like from the Grinch movies. I was almost there when I looked up to see a star, twinkling much more than the others. It was a vast array of colors, switching between blue, red and yellow.   

I stared at it for a moment as all of the cold felt like it had disappeared. I felt okay. And then, just underneath it, I saw movement towards me. I looked back to the ground to see a tall man with this disgusting smile on his face, like he was hungry. I backed away, and as I did I fell into the ground, into a frozen lake I had been standing on top of. My vision became cloudy as I struggled to move in the water, every inch of me instantly becoming numb from the ice water. 

Then the figure stood on the ice over where I was. Although the sound came through muddy and jangled, I could tell he was speaking. The only words I could understand were the words “Star of Bethlehem”.  



From Mark: 

So I'm sitting on a couch in this random family's house, decked out for Christmas with a tree, stockings, and lights and stuff. But here's the weird part—the family's looking all sad and scared, not into the holiday vibes. I try talking to them, but they just stare at me, like they want me to shut up. Like something’s going to get them. 
Getting freaked out, I start wandering around the house, looking for a way out. I found the door, tried to open it, but nope—locked from the outside. Literally boarded in, I could see wood planks on the outside from the window. I try to break a window and the family starts to move towards me to stop me and I put up my fists because I wasn’t going down without a fight. I'm yelling to be let out, asking where we are, but no one's answering.  
  
Outside, bells start ringing, and then there's this loud thud on the roof. Then footsteps. One of the kids starts crying, and the mom covers the kid's mouth quick. The Christmas music turns all weird, lights flicker, and stuff falls down the chimney—first soot, then this big red sack.
  
Out pops a tall dude in a wet-looking Santa suit. Creepy long smile, white eyes. I back up, and I could tell he’s looking right at me. Then he walks past the freaked-out family, comes up to me, and suddenly grabs my head. I'm trying to scream and fight, but this guy is way too strong. He turns my head toward the window and points it up, and there are six big, bright lights in the sky, rotating in the clockwise direction.    
And then, in this creepy, hoarse voice, he whispers in my ear, saying tonight's the night, the star of Bethlehem is back, and me and my family are done for. Calls me a “sinner” and a “defiler”, stupid stuff. Then he laughs and says, "Merry Christmas." Suddenly, my head is turned backwards, complete 180 like in the movies, and I feel a massive jolt of pain. Then I woke up freaking out. It just felt so real. Freaky dream, man.

From Robert: 

I think I was in a town hall or something… it was a large government building. I was standing in a crowd of people, and the room was completely silent. No one was talking. The walls were decorated with colorful ribbons, bows and Christmas lights. Two large Christmas trees sat in the corners. And a line of children, between the ages of maybe 3 and 12, all stood in a straight line at the front of the room.      
I walked around the room, inspecting where I was. One of the things hanging up was a calendar and I approached it. The date marked was December 24th, 2031. I scratched my head in confusion. Isn’t it 2023? How did I get here? It was messing with me, and that’s when I figured I must be dreaming. But when I pinched myself I swear I felt it! It was weird.   
  
The doors in the back swung open and a tall man in a business suit walked in. I could hear some of the people in the room begin to cry, and there was definitely a change in the room tone. I can’t really explain it, but it was like the mood changed from uncomfortable shuffling to silent panic.   
  
The tall man  approached the line of children at the front, his back turned to us. Most of the children looked terrified. I had no idea what was going on.  
  
“Merry Christmas children!” The man shouted. No response. “I said… MERRY CHRISTMAS” he shouted. His voice was raspy but firm, and his scream shook the core of the entire room. It’s like everything vibrates when he shouted. “Merry Christmas, Belial” the children uttered.    
  
“That’s more like it. Have any of you been outside tonight?” No answer. He walked over to a younger girl, no older than 9. “What’s in the sky tonight, my sweet Kelly?” Her face was holding back tears. “The star of Bethlehem, Belial”. “That’s right” he replied.    
  
He then stepped towards a side door, stepped out for a second, and then came back in with a large, red sack. “This world is going to go away now, children. We don’t need it. And all of the sinners are going to a very bad place. But you’re all young, innocent. Precious. So I’m going to take you somewhere safe. I’m going to save you. I’ll be your savior this time.”   
He then propped down his sack, and I saw it begin to squirm and move. Muffled screams were coming from it. My eyes widened as he then picked up the children, one by one, and began to shove, and I mean SHOVE, them into the sack. I looked around at the crowd, expecting to see protest, but all I saw were silent tears. I had no idea what was going on, but I knew it was evil, and someone had to stop it. I ran forward and shouted at the man “Hey, what do you think you’re doing? Stop it!” Everyone’s eyes fell on me, and the man paused. He slowly turned towards me.    
  
A large, gruesome smile lined his face. His eyes... they were empty. All white, just blank. And then, he ran towards me with his sack. [And then I woke up.](https://www.reddit.com/user/UnderdonetoastHorror)
