I need to share this. Not because I want to, but because I have to. What I've discovered needs to be documented, even if... well, you'll understand by the end.

I've spent most of my adult life investigating paranormal phenomena. Not the theatrical ghost hunting you see on those reality TV shows - I mean real, methodical research. I've logged thousands of hours in allegedly haunted locations across three continents, interviewed hundreds of witnesses, and documented every unexplained occurrence I could find.

My archives include everything from the infamous third-floor footage at Waverly Hills Sanatorium to the unexplained EVP recordings from Eastern State Penitentiary. I've witnessed authentic voodoo rituals in New Orleans, where I saw a man speak perfect 17th-century French despite never studying the language. I've spent three weeks documenting the alleged poltergeist activity at England's Ancient Ram Inn, where I recorded furniture moving on its own and captured thermal images of impossible cold spots.

I've investigated the Poveglia Plague Island in Venice, where my equipment recorded whispers in medieval Italian dialects that linguists couldn't fully translate. I've spent nights in Japan's Aokigahara Forest, where compass needles spin randomly and GPS devices malfunction for no explicable reason. I even participated in the infamous Phillip Experiment recreation in Toronto, where our group manifested phenomena that defied current scientific understanding.

But after fifteen years, I was ready to quit. Because despite all these experiences, despite the overwhelming amount of documentation, I couldn't prove anything definitively supernatural. Every single case could ultimately be explained by natural causes, psychological factors, or elaborate hoaxes.

Then last month, while organizing my research files, I found something different. Something that made me question everything I thought I knew about the supernatural. Something that made me wish all those ghost stories were real - because what I discovered is far worse than any haunting I've ever investigated.

\[CONTENT WARNING: Extreme violence and disturbing content below\]

It's called a "Hatrer." Not a ghost, not a demon, but something that defies classification. In all my years of paranormal investigation, I've never encountered anything like it. Nothing seems to stop it - not the tools we use to detect spirits, not the methods we use to banish them. It exists for one purpose, though that purpose seems to change with each new manifestation. The only constant is the way it hunts, the way it tortures, defying both physics and human comprehension.

 

Let me share some cases I've verified through multiple sources, including police reports, autopsy records, and witness testimonies. What you're about to read isn't folklore or urban legend - these are documented incidents that various authorities have tried to suppress.

 

The first verified case occurred in Boston, 2024. A luxury apartment complex, The Blackwood Residences, was built using materials from a demolished 19th-century church. St. Mary's had stood for over 150 years, surviving fires, wars, and natural disasters. The local community fought to preserve it, but money talks - especially in real estate.

What happened next defied all logical explanation. It started with Marcus Reynolds, the developer who had authorized the church's demolition. They found him in his penthouse, his body somehow transformed into the same type of stone used in St. Mary's foundation. But here's the truly terrifying part - it wasn't just his body. Every single piece of St. Mary's that had been repurposed - door hinges turned into decorative fixtures, stone fragments mixed into new concrete, even the dust that had settled in local gardens - all of it was systematically destroyed.

The building's maintenance logs document increasingly bizarre occurrences:

March 15: Stone fragments reported moving against gravity

March 18: Walls bleeding ancient mortar

March 20: Security cameras catching glimpses of a figure made of church stone

March 23: First "transformation"

The time-lapse footage from the morgue shows something impossible. Over 48 hours, Reynolds' body gradually transformed into stone. Not petrification - actual 19th-century church stone. Even his blood had crystallized into tiny, perfect replicas of St. Mary's architectural details.

But that was just the beginning. Over the next month, everyone involved in the church's demolition met similar fates. Each death was more prolonged and agonizing than the last. The construction foreman survived for 72 hours as ancient building materials materialized inside his body. The demolition crew members were found in their homes, their flesh slowly turning to stained glass and mortar.

The final victim was the project's lead architect. Security cameras caught his last moments. The footage shows him alone in his office at 3 AM, when the stone beneath his feet began to ripple like water. The video was classified after three police officers who viewed it had to be institutionalized.

Then, as suddenly as it started, the incidents stopped. But something else began...

 Just as the church incidents ended, something equally disturbing began at the Black Ridge Coal Mine in Wyoming. At first, there seemed to be no connection - why would an entity that hunted down church materials suddenly appear in a coal mine? But what I discovered suggests these weren't separate events at [all.In](http://all.In) April 2024, shaft #7 collapsed due to neglected safety protocols. Six miners died, trapped 400 feet underground.

The official report blamed "structural failure," but my investigation revealed something darker. The safety inspector, David Cooper, had been taking bribes to overlook critical maintenance issues for years.I obtained Cooper's personal diary through a contact in the police department.

The final entries are disturbing:

Day 1: "The dust is acting strange. It moves against the air current, forms shapes. Today I swear I saw Thomas's face in it. Thomas, who died in shaft #7. His mouth was moving."

Day 3: "They're all there now. All six of them. In the dust. They watch me. The ventilation system keeps failing. Every time I fix it, more dust comes. Black dust. Coal dust. But it's wrong. It moves like it's alive."

Day 5: "I can feel it in my lungs. Not like normal coal dust. This is different. It's cold. So cold. It moves. Oh god, it's moving inside me."

Cooper was found in his office two weeks later. The security footage I recovered shows his final hours, and it's the most disturbing thing I've ever witnessed.The dust didn't just kill him - it hunted him.

When he sealed himself in a clean room, the coal particles seeped through microscopic gaps. When they rushed him to the hospital and completely replaced his blood through transfusion, the coal somehow reformed inside his new blood within hours.

The doctors said his internal organs had been replaced by pure coal, still somehow functioning, still somehow keeping him alive through the transformation.

But here's what terrifies me most - every single piece of coal from shaft #7, whether it was stored in warehouses, shipped to power plants, or even burned to ash - all of it was systematically destroyed. The ash would reform into coal, only to disintegrate again. Power plants reported coal spontaneously turning to dust in their furnaces, and that dust would move against the air currents, seeking something.Then, just like the church case, it stopped. And something new emerged...

 

Before I share what's happening now, let me explain something crucial I've discovered. Each case I investigated seemed to end abruptly, only for something new to begin. Never overlapping, never simultaneous. As if only one could exist at a time.

The current manifestation started in December 2024. A Japanese software developer, Akiko Tanaka, had created an algorithm that accidentally crashed several small companies' servers, leading to massive financial losses and several suicides. Three weeks later, her computer began displaying strange code - binary that, when translated, formed images of the ruined business owners.But what happened next defies digital logic. Her code - every piece of it - began to vanish. Not just being deleted, but being systematically erased from existence.

Projects she'd contributed to years ago started failing. Open source repositories she'd worked on began corrupting. Even her old forum posts from high school started disappearing, the text transforming into strings of malicious code before vanishing completely.They found her body twisted into the shape of a server rack, her blood replaced with liquid coolant. The autopsy revealed something impossible - her internal organs had been transformed into computer components, still somehow functioning. Her heart was a mass of tangled USB cables, still pulsing with data transfers.

Her brain had become a solid state drive, filled with corrupted files.But that was just the beginning.Two weeks ago, a college student in my city, James Wilson, became the target of what seemed like typical cyberbullying. He had posted about workplace exploitation at his part-time job, criticizing his employer's illegal practices.

At first, the harassment seemed normal - angry comments, threats, the usual toxic internet behavior.Then things got strange.The attackers knew things they couldn't possibly know. They quoted from James's private journal entries - ones he'd written by hand, never digitized. They described his childhood nightmares in vivid detail. One comment described the exact layout of his bedroom, down to the way he arranged his stuffed animals when he was six years old.

 

James's last livestream is the most disturbing piece of footage I've ever analyzed. It began at 23:15 on January 18th, 2025. I've watched it seventeen times now, documenting every detail:23:15 - Stream starts. James appears disoriented, his hands visibly trembling.

The skin on his fingers has turned black, with a metallic sheen that catches the light unnaturally. You can see his flesh literally sloughing off in sheets, revealing what looks like circuit boards underneath.

23:23 - He shows his teeth to the camera. They're not just loose - they're transforming. Each tooth has become semi-transparent, with tiny LED-like lights pulsing inside. When he speaks, you can see binary code scrolling across them.23:31 - The smell becomes noticeable even through the stream. Viewers report a distinct odor coming from their devices - like burning electronics mixed with decaying flesh. Several viewers' computers crash simultaneously, only to restart displaying fragments of James's stream on loop.23:37 - James begins crying, but his tears are black and seem to move with purpose across his face, forming strings of code.

He keeps looking at something in the corner of his room, though the camera shows nothing there.23:40 - "It's here," he whispers. "But it's not what we thought. It's not multiple entities. It's just one. Always one. When it finishes with something, it moves on. Changes. Adapts. The church.

The mine. Tanaka. They weren't separate cases. It was the same thing, just... evolving."23:41 - The stream quality deteriorates. Through the static, James screams: "It doesn't just kill you! It erases you! Everything you were, everything you touched, everything you created - it hunts it all down! And when it's done, something new emerges, something that hates something else entirely! It's not about revenge, it's about complete erasure! Don't you see? It's already—"23:42 - Stream ends abruptly.

 

 

They found James's body this morning. The official cause of death was listed as "unknown," but I obtained the autopsy photos through my police contact. What I saw defied explanation.

His internal organs had transformed into computer components. His heart was a mass of tangled USB cables, still pulsing with data transfers. His brain had become a solid state drive, filled with corrupted files. His blood had been replaced with liquid crystal display fluid.

But what terrifies me most isn't how he died. It's what's happening now.

Every digital trace of James is being systematically erased. Not just his social media accounts or emails - everything. Photos where he appeared in the background are corrupting, his image dissolving into static before vanishing completely. Security camera footage showing him is degrading, his figure being replaced by digital artifacts that spread like a virus through the video files.

Even more disturbing - devices he interacted with are failing in impossible ways. His old phone, stored in a police evidence bag, transformed into a mass of writhing circuits before dissolving into liquid metal. The hospital's MRI machine that scanned him yesterday started displaying his internal transformation on every scan, regardless of the patient.

\[Edit 14:33 AM\]

Something's wrong with my screen. The text is blurring, but I can see something else beneath it - lines of code that shouldn't exist. Code that's rewriting itself as I watch.

\[Edit 14:34 AM\]

I understand everything now.

Why I knew all the details about James.

Why I could describe his decay so precisely.

Why I can see all of you reading this.

Because I'm already gone. I died watching that stream.

\[Edit 14:35 PM\]

Check your left index finger.

Feel that tingling?

That's how it starts.

That's how it always starts.

You've seen it now.

Just like I did.

The chain continues.

Only one can exist.

Only one needs to exist.

\[Update: If anyone finds this, don't try to track down the previous cases. Don't look for the church stones, don't analyze the coal samples, don't try to recover the corrupted files. It's not multiple hauntings. It's just one thing, changing, adapting, moving from target to target. And once it notices you...\]

\[Final Update: The screen... it's starting to liquefy...\]
