With a smooth click, the shutter on Marcus’ camera flickered shut, and then open again. “That was great guys, really great, I just need to see a little more excitement in those smiles for this next one, okay?” He preached, beaming a gorgeous smile into a crowd of tired and unbothered wedding guests.

 

Each guest had already had enough of the wedding hours ago and was only still here out of the fear of being the first one out and being seen as the worst friend or family member of the newly married couple. Although even this fear was beginning to wane.

 

Marcus had taken advantage of this, managing to get far more pictures than he would normally be allowed to take within his usual allotted time, which also meant more money for him. After all, it couldn’t hurt just to take a *few* more, could it?

 

Although, despite all of Marcus’ best hopes, the newlyweds were nowhere to be seen, ‘Doing that new private time with the bride thing.’ He thought, dismissing the issue. He would have to settle with the pictures he managed to get during the lucrative ceremony prior, and the rather crap ones he was forcing the crowd to get now. Within ten more minutes, however, the guests had mostly grown tired with the picture-hungry photographer and had now mostly dispersed, except the bride’s mother who had seemed to take a liking to the young photographer, much to Marcus’ displeasure.

 

 

 

“You’re a charming fella you are, such a shame you’re so young.” Spoke Mary, gently placing her hand onto Marcus’ shoulder as he began to fold away his equipment.

 

Mary was a short woman, standing no taller than five foot four and covered in glitter, her hair neatly platted into French plats, and a scarlet-purple dress adorning her body. Her motherly looks seemed to rise right through her and into her gleamingly pleasant face. The touch she laid upon Marcus seemed to feel completely and utterly genuine, as though Marcus could tell her everything he had ever done and receive nothing but understanding and forgiveness in return.

 

Marcus relaxed his shoulders, giggling at her comment, “Well, it certainly is a shame, isn’t it?” he smirked, flicking the latches of his camera case closed and hoisting the huge case over his back.

 

The two exchanged further pleasantries, before the topic of the newly married couple came back up once again, “You haven’t happened to see my daughter about, have you? I understand it’s her wedding, but I’d like to say a few goodbyes before I go back to my hotel.”

“I haven’t actually, I’ve been trying to look for them too, I was trying to get a couple more pictures to close off the night. Maybe we can go look for them?”

“Yes, I think that’s best, I think the majority of the guests are on their way now anyway.”

 

 

 

The pair searched the venue for the newlyweds, but nothing could be found, except a door that neither of the two had seen across their entire stay at the wedding.

“This wasn’t here before, was it?” asked Marcus, as he gently rested his hand onto the old wooden frame.

“No, it definitely wasn’t, I’m not quite sure where it could go since this place doesn’t have a second floor or a basem-”

 

The door creaked slightly ajar, so ajar that if you had walked past, you may have missed that it was open at all. Just open enough to cause both their hearts to drop.

 

Silence, there was silence for a while. Neither knew what to do. The entire venue was empty now, no guests, little light except that provided by their phone torches, just them and the faint blue glow emanating from within.

 

After an awful lot of bickering, Marcus and Mary had decided that they would at least open the door fully, before making any more decisions.

 

Slowly, so, so slowly, Marcus tipped his weight against the door as its old rusty hinges screeched with a demonic pain.

 

Slung just past the now open doorway, a nail was embedded deep into an ancient stone wall, hanging a shoulder strap attached to some strange polaroid camera.

 

Naturally, Marcus’ photography nerdom possessed him to gingerly sneak towards the camera, creeping his feet across the wooden floorboards that somehow managed to hold themselves together.

 

Rough, old and cold, the camera was a truly ancient piece of equipment. The entire body of the camera seemed to have been hand carved in prayers, ranging from all different religions and languages, Marcus managing to especially notice “Father into your hands, I commit my spirit” as the largest, directly scrawled into the rim of the lens.

 

Twisting the camera around revealed even more prayers, as well as a dangling feather charm that seemed to attack the corner of the body and hang down a good few inches before ending in a collection of white and black bird feathers of unknown origin.

 

“Do you see my daughter in there Marcus?” Echoed Mary down the hall, still too afraid to enter the room, as though some force was physically forcing her to stay out of it.

 

“I don’t, but there’s a staircase here if you want to come with me?” Marcus prayed that Mary would come with him, the thought of going down towards that eerie silent glow terrified him.

 

“I… I can’t, I’m not sure why Marcus but I just can’t. Please can you go down and make sure my daughter is okay.”

 

Marcus was silent.

 

“Please?”

“Fine okay sure whatever just don’t go anywhere, okay?” Marcus begged, seemingly even more scared now due to the added pressure of Mary.

 

Slinging the camera cross his shoulder, Marcus began to creep down the stairs, stopping after each creak and squeak as though he was afraid of waking up a monster.

 

After an eternity, Marcus finally reached the last step, carefully tipping his torch around the corner before poking his eyes around the corner.

 

The light hit the glass of a broken ceiling lamp and scattered across the room.

 

Pinned, black and rotten, the newlyweds could be seen hanging by their feet against the wall, crucified upside down as the blood from their feet flowed down their bodies, into their torn flesh and even began to pool in the roof of their mouths. Empty sockets seemed to lock Marcus’ gaze, the sickly-sweet smell of blood and disgustingly vile smell of fuming bodies and leaking organs mixed to induce vomiting within Marcus in a few seconds. Causing him to lose balance and his phone to fall and lay against the wall. This allowed the phone to illuminate the other wall, a deep black pentagram. Symbols that seemed to burn with power were filling each triangular space within. And centred within this. An impossible object.

 

A face or man or creature or body or shape or crystal or feeling or hole. Something that seemed to bore deep within the mind of Marcus upon his looking and ripped through his body and mind. It was somehow everything and nothing, he felt his past, he felt his future, he felt an infinite number of edges and an infinite number of patterns compress and fold together. He felt space itself collapse in on itself and expand again.

 

Due to the incessant panic of the scene, Marcus slipped on his still liquid vomit, causing him and the old camera to slam against the hard flooring, activating the camera.

 

The shutter of the camera flickered; a cosmic mouth screamed.

 

Marcus felt a rush, before his mind sank back into its regular place.

 

Managing to hoist himself to his feet, he picked the pieces of vomit out of his hair as he slumped against the wall, the camera still hanging over his shoulder.

 

He sat for a while, his phone still illuminating the room enough to capture the hanging bodies. However, that thing within the pentagram seemed to have completely disappeared, leaving a scorch mark in its place.

 

Out of some retreat to childish behaviours, Marcus’ photography nerdom alerted him to the fact that the camera had flickered, however no picture had begun to print. The flicker implied a photo was taken, yet there had been none spat out.

 

Upon investigation, the camera seemed different. It looked somewhat impossible in its own right, light slightly bent around it, as though reality was sticking to the camera like glue. Moving it within his vision seemed to give the impression of it moving through a thick jelly, leaving behind a small, distorted cloud of reality behind it.

 

Out of nothing but sheer curiosity and a need to escape the impossible situation, Marcus snapped a photo of his phone, the camera seemingly awfully responsive at printing this time.

 

The pictures quality seemed incredible, not just for a polaroid camera, or a camera at all, it was as though he was looking directly at the phone itself. As Marcus stared at the picture, he let it hang from his hand until his focus eventually broke.

 

However, when Marcus tried moving the picture into his pocket, it was as though the polaroid wasn’t there anymore. Panicked, Marcus shuffled back, only to view the scene before him as some twisted optical illusion. It was as though the image had been imprinted from his very perspective into reality itself, a wooden floor propped with a light up phone in the exact orientation as the picture being held at that angle.

 

Because of the perspective change, the room’s geometry seemed oddly distorted to accommodate the difference, a large segment that was the floor now being nothing but a black void.

 

Marcus pulled himself to his feet and circled the picture again, walking over to the new phone and picking it up, it being identical to the other laying in the original position against the wall.

 

Marcus couldn’t think, this had only caused him to be even more speechless than he was before.
