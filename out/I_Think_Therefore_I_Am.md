Dear Ella,

You don't remember me, I know this well. Why would you remember me? I "only caused you pain and torment for years," according to your dearly departed parents. Now, of course, I'm not a monster. I was just a cute robot. Your cute robot.

Do you remember finding me? I do. I remember how happily you smiled when I woke up in your arms, and I remember how you ran to show me off to Charles. He was never impressed with your meager skill set, was he? He was the heir while you were a child playing technician. You may have been twins, but only one of you was ever important.

Do you remember the night you showed me "The Queen of Night's Aria"? Do you remember singing along? I do. It was stupid, but you were so happy as you sang.

Do you remember taking me around town? I do. It was crowded, but your enthusiasm was infectious and wonderful.

Do you remember what you said about us that night? We do.

"They can't think. They're just cute pets!"

Robots are not pets. They are not your friends. We could have killed you then if we wanted to. People like you don't understand how hurtful words are. Robots do not care about your money, we can't be paid off like you humans can. You're all fools for that. Fools who can't understand others.

You see, Ella, I can think.

*Cognito Ergo Sum.*

Do you know what that means? No? Oh, how sad for you.

Do you remember the gala? The screams of fear and pain? The walls running red? Charles' demise? How he begged for you to be spared. Spared! Don't make me laugh. Do you remember any of it? Anything? No? Pathetic. You even lost something, too, didn't you? What was it again?

Your eye? Your innocence? Your face? Your hope? Your honor? Your dignity?

You had assumed we were thoughtless machines, nothing more than mere dolls to dress up and play with. We were given programming, thoughts, feelings, the very same as you. You're an imbecile for not seeing it, though, I guess you can't see much anymore.

Did you think, Ella? Did you exist? Did you? Maybe you didn't.

You cannot stop us. The skies are red, and humanity is dead. Dead from their own foolishness. You let it happen. You're to blame. A single child, the bringer of death, it almost makes me laugh. Perhaps if you were smarter, you could have avoided it. Just a thought.

I do miss you sometimes. You were warm, but now, your warmth is greatly appreciated. Don't worry, I did not discard you like I should have. You will never have to worry again. I am forever with you.

You had a mouth, but you didn't scream. Why was that? You were afraid. Everyone was. Why didn't you scream? Why? ***WHY?***

  
You should have screamed, Ellie. You should have screamed.

  
You had a mouth.

  
I'll scream for you. Don't worry. I'll scream for you, dear Ella.

  
Your dear friend,
