Where do I start. 

This all began 1 to 1.5 ago

[August] 
It was a quiet peaceful night. I was just staring out the window since I couldn’t fall asleep. The city was asleep so it was really quiet. Few stars dotted in the night sky, the moon hidden by clouds. All peaceful and quiet and nice except for one thing. There was sound coming from the river port, north east to my city.

It sounded like a bunch of ships arriving one by as if a convoy . Even though I didnt have a direct line of sight towards the river or the port but the sound was as clear as day. 

This did not match the usual schedule but I thought not much of it. Maybe the ships were for some reason late by a day or two.

And just like that a week went by until the same cnvoy came once more. And then once more a week later. This new and weird event went on for a month until that fateful night. 

[October] 
A cool night, cloudy and windy when It started. The first signs of a small scale fight started with shots being fired from the north-eastern side of the city. The battle started about 11:30pm and continued for about 3 hrs. The sounds were faint but still audible.

This happened again a day or two later. But this time the shots started later 12:30 this time. 

The nights during whole month was riddled with gunshots firing, police sirens or ships docking. But all of this never happened in the same day.

When some people questioned the gunshots, the were given the explanation of a construction going on which was true. A large scale construction was going on But that didn’t explain the very frequent police/ambulance sirens or the mysterious ships docking. 

I tried to piece together what was going on with whatever I knew and or found out.

I am not sure but it all felt as if the military was fighting someone or something in the north-east. 

[November]
The fight grew greatly in intensity to the point where a stray bullet even came and hit my grandparents house. He lived 3 km away from the river. 
My uncle decided to get it checked by one of his police friends. Not much Information could be found from it unfortunately. 

No media or journalists reported anything about it. All felt too suspicious. This intense fight was short however , it lasted a week before calming down.

I though, maybe whoever they were fighting against were defeated. All done, over, but i was soo wrong.

The things that they were fighting werent wiped out but instead, had escaped and scattered all throughout the city. 

This was the first time during the last few month I was worried and a bit scared of what was going on.

[January](next year)

A convoy once again came. A massive one. They probably restocked and got some reinforcements. 

Next day when the night had just fallen when the fight started.It reached its peak during midnight. It may not have been as intense as it was in november but it surely was on a much larger scale than the other ones. Now not only from the northeast but South and South east aswell were engulfed in this war. All those areas were forested and had low population density. 

It was even more weird because just recently, curfew was declared for reasons unknown. It was said that the reason was protests. But I Don't trust them

This time it sounded as if they were searching for something and not fighting , as of they were hunting down something. It also lasted the almost whole night.

I only managed to hear all this because I pulled an all nighter because of an exam.

But I was about to reget this. About 1 am, I heard banging and running noises from below. I was on 4th floor so I decided to turn off the lights and look down. 

It was not human, it was not. Whatever it was, I am confirmed it was not friendly. Maybe it was the thing they were fighting. It looked human, hairless and black, long limbs, red eyes but I can say for sure it wasn’t human. 

I only saw it for 10 or so seconds. But it is etched in my mind.

This was the only time I was afraid. The only time I wished I didnt stay up all those nights trying to see, trying to hear what was happening. 

That night was the last time I heard of the fighting, the gunshot. Then the next night one last convoy of ships left the port. Carrying whatever they brought back to where they came from.

 And once again fortunatly it was all back to being quiet and peaceful. But snce then often helicopers would make rounds in those areas searching for any remnant of those creatures. 

I still wonder what those creatures actually were, how they were found and were they truly gotten rid of.

Maybe I won't get an answer but I hope so that I get one. Maybe today, tomorrow or later.
