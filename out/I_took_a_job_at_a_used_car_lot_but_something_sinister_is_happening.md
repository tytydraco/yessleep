For context, I've been in retail for years. Sometimes, I've been the manager, other times, the low man on the block. I don't know if any of you know the feeling, but retail is soul crushing work. Usually it's not hard, even when it is, it's much better than other jobs, but it wears on you quickly. 

I had reached my limit when I began searching for a different gig. I have a pretty decent resume so applied to tons of jobs. I was particular though, desperately trying to get out of retail.

Fast forward four months and I hadn't gotten a single call back. I felt extremely defeated and stuck to say the least. 

One evening I decided to go for a drive, just to get out of my apartment and clear my head. I headed towards the far end of my town, just relaxing. I live in the southern tip of my town, and to get all the way to the next county, it takes about 40 minutes. Near the line I saw something new.

Just off the right side of the main road, I saw what looked like a new street. There was no streetlights, no painted lines. Yet, as I got closer, I saw that it was indeed new pavement. Curiosity got the best of me and I turned on to it. 

It was very dark under the canopy of trees, which loomed overhead and seemed to nit together in the middle. For some reason, this raised the hair on my neck. I thought, "fuck it", and kept driving. 

This new road meandered through the forest, never straight. Before long, the trees opened up, and there it was. Settled in what had to be the heart of the forest was a brand new car lot. There were balloons, neon signs, and one of those wacky tube guys flailing in a phantom breeze produced by it's own fan. 

Totally normal ware for a car lot, except there were no cars.

I slowed my Honda and pulled in to take a minute and turn around. I didn't see anyone around. The lights were on inside, and though it was a small building, I got the feeling it was hiding something terrible inside. Weird I know, but I just had a bad feeling. You know what I mean? Like one of those liminal spaces people talk about. 

Seconds later, though I hate to admit it, I found myself screaming to the top of my lungs . Just outside my window, a rather lanky , tall man, was knocking. He was in a cheap suit, with dark hair slicked back, and bright eyes peering at me. I gathered my wits and rolled my window down, ready to apologize for being here.

"Hello sir how do you do!" he said to me before I could get a word out.

"I'm perfectly fine, but I'm headed out, sorry for stopping here" I told him. I was looking around like crazy, trying to plan how to quickly get away from the conversations. Then I saw a help wanted sign. 

"I was just driving through looking for work, but I'm sorry to have bothered you!" I said rather quickly. 

"That is just Perfect!" he almost seemed to roar. "I'm looking for a salesman. Come on out and let's talk."

Before long I found myself sitting down at his desk inside.  We talked for a good long time. He offered me a great opportunity. If you've never been in the car business it goes like this: Commission is your cut of a sale, front end is what the lot makes versus what they paid for the car, and back end is any "fees" you can tack onto the sale. A salesman gets a certain percentage of those aspects. Here, he offered me fifty percent commission! I have since learned that is almost unheard of in the car selling world.  On top of that he also granted me a salary of 65k, just to "show up" as he put it. And the best part? I wasn't required to do any marketing. He told me the customers would come all on their own. 

Like I said, how could I refuse? I wish I had. 

Eventually, after I accepted, he told me to go home and get some rest. Not to worry about coming to work until Monday of next week, but he would start my salary as of now. I thought that was a little crazy, but I wasn't going to look a gift horse in the mouth. Now I found myself with a four day weekend, and a well paying job. I hadn't felt happiness ever like I felt in those four days. 

Monday rolled around and in I went. I got my own office, hell I had the whole place to myself. When I walked in there was a note with my name on it and no one else around. The not was actually a list of "rules", five to be exact. Rule number one was, don't go into the boss's office, ever. Number two was don't call the boss, ever. Number three, don't question the boss. Number four, if a customer comes looking for a car they saw from an ad, we have it, even if there are no cars on the lot. And number five was the weirdest one: Never turn your back to the boss's door. 

I was, of course, weirded out, but there was also a check attached to the note. A check for the full 65k salary. Rule number two, don't call. So I didn't. I began to get comfortable. Shit, this was going to be the easiest job I've ever had. 

For nearly a month, there were no customers, and no cars showed up to sell. I went in every day, played around on my phone, and backed out of the doorway when I locked up in the evening. It was the last day of that first month when I finally had a customer. 

Being there by myself, I was honestly kind of worried. I hadn't been trained but I was going to try and help them if I could. The customer had arrived in an almost brand new Cadillac so I had no idea what they may want. I let him get out and come to the door. Before I could even say hello, I heard the office across from mine open up. As I shifted to see what was going on, the boss was standing right beside me.

He vehemently shook our first customers hand and ushered him into his office. Before going inside himself he came to me. 

"You are doing excellent young man, every rule followed to a T! Why don't you go on home for the day, here is your check!" he said with a large, toothy grin.

I looked down and was shocked to see another large check. This one was for the amount of 75k. 

"What is.." I began to say but quickly shut up. No questions to the boss. I don't know why I blindly followed these rules but, I was being paid a ridiculous amount so might as well.  He smiled, which sent a chill down my back, and said he just knew I would sell one today, so my monthly paycheck had been increased to include my commission.

Yup, you read that right. I was getting at minimum 65k a month! Like, holy hell this is massive life changing money. You best believe I shut um, walked backwards to the front door, and left. 

That was almost six months ago. You would be surprised to learn that the almost new Cadillac was sitting on our lot, priced and ready to sell by the next morning. This happened no less that five times a month following the first time. I was making massive amounts of money, life outside of work was amazing, but I never forgot that the boss was in his office all the time. The odd rules, the strange feeling the place gave me, it was beginning to make me feel nauseous. 

Every time we had a customer come in, they were almost always driving brand new cars, I never got the chance to speak to them, and the boss would send me home early. The vehicles were always on the lot, ready to sell by the next morning. 

Life was great, until about a month ago.

Our customer count has really skyrocketed. I'm talking fifteen to twenty people a day. People I recognize from town. Our lot was beyond full. See, none of the cars being left behind are ever sold, even though our influx of business kept growing.  The thought that something odd is going on is almost overwhelming at this point. That feeling is worse knowing that I have seen less and less people around town since we started getting busy. Hell it's almost like everyone has left.

Three days ago, I hit a breaking point when I came in and saw some heavy machinery stacking the cars on top of each other! How in the hell are we suppose to sell half crushed cars? I had had enough. 

I went into the office and immediately broke a rule by knocking on the boss's door. On the last knock, the door opened on it's own, revealing a dim lit room, with...nothing inside. The boss was not there, nothing was there.

Nothing. 

Then I broke another rule. I called him. Shocker here, but the line never rang. I got an automated message saying the phone number was disconnected. 

Strike three was when I turned my back to the door and walked to my desk. As I turned to sit, the boss was sitting at my desk. Yet again, I began to scream before calming down enough to laugh out loud. 

"You know, I thought you were smarter than this. Do I not keep you comfortable enough?" he said, with that sickening smile on his face again. 

"Yes sir you do, I just.... how can we sell stacked cars? We haven't sold a single one anyways, but we can't sell stacked cars can we?" I blurted out. I have no qualms in saying I was scared.

His eyes darkened as I slid into my chair. His frown is worse than his grin.

He told me that I had broken all the "important rules but one". He said he was disappointed. My punishment was to be present during his next sell. He said it was my turn to learn.

Like I said, that was three days ago. We haven't had another customer yet but, I'm terrified.

Shit, I gotta get off of here, a car just pulled up, and the boss's door just opened.
