My wife and I thought we were lucky to snatch up a genuine Victorian townhouse. Original brownstone, with the bay windows and a marble fireplace and all the awesome trappings of a young family that’s finally, really made it to the middle-classes. Well done, us.

As it turns out, we might as well have bought a fucking mausoleum.

But it was a great idea at the time. My wife’s a high school teacher, so she was looking forward to ripping up crappy carpets and punching through drywall - she said it was about restoring the house, but we both knew it was more about smashing shit up. Cheaper than therapy. Once, I bought her tickets for a local rage room for her birthday, but the only thing that got smashed was my favorite coffee cup. In our kitchen. Whatever, I still think it was a great idea.

As for me, I’ve been a rising star at the accountancy firm, so much so that the senior partners granted my request to work from home three days a week. My daughter’s started the third grade, so I want to be more present in her life before I blink and she’s suddenly leaving for college. And I figured that if I was going to work in my house, I might as well get a damn nice house.

And it is a damn nice house! With a lot of history. The Realtor told us that it started as a generational home, where the kids would look after their elderly parents and raise their own kids in turn, but it went on to be a small homeless shelter and some sort of clinic and a halfway house for abused women. 

Then she showed us the boiler in the basement, an ugly old barrel of warped, rusted metal and twitching gauges, looking like a hunchbacked beggar, bent double in prayer. She gave us some guy’s number in case we had any trouble with it - a local historian, of all people.

Every night, when I finally follow my wife to bed, I hear that boiler. Through the basement door. I swear to god, it sounds like a man in pain, moaning and wheezing. It sounds exactly like what you’re imagining, as if there’s someone actually down there. 

When I lay in bed, I hear the house settling, the floorboards outside our room creaking, and I imagine that the man in pain has escaped the basement, coming upstairs to share his agony. With my wife. My daughter. Bent double in prayer.

But that’s stupid. There’s no man in the basement. I know because a few nights ago, when my imagination was being particularly unpleasant, I actually went down to check. I must have looked like a kid, clutching a torch at the top step, too afraid to actually go down. The torch beam clearly showed an unmoving boiler and little else, and I could tell that the moaning, wheezing groans were in fact leaking out of the stupid thing. Just ancient valves winding down for the night, that’s what I told myself. My heart was finally winding down for the night, too.

And just as I was closing that basement door, I heard something else. Sharper than the moaning, wheezing groans. *Tap-tap-tap*. Like a knuckle against metal. 

I stopped. Everything stopped. The door was open just an inch, my hand clenching the handle so tightly that the marks on my palm have only just faded. There was a whistle of tinnitus in my left ear. A ticking clock from the living room. Upstairs, a settling floorboard creaked - and in the basement, silence. No groans. No tapping.

I was staring into that inch of blackness between the basement door and the door frame, as if waiting for glistening eyes to lurch out of the gloom, the way a rabbit must feel in those awful seconds before it gets hit by a car. But there were no glistening eyes. No sounds of shoes scuffing against the basement steps. 

I finally closed the door, a little louder than was necessary, as if to assert myself over those childish, nightmarish thoughts - it didn’t work.

That was two nights ago. Friday night. Too much beer, I told myself the next morning. I told myself because I didn’t want to tell my wife - *little ears have a way of hearing everything*, that’s what she says about kids. The last thing I needed was my daughter having nightmares about the basement. I quickly found out that wouldn’t be the case.

Yesterday, I was in my office, using my work computer to catch up on some fantasy football. My daughter came in, as relaxed as I had ever seen her, and calmly told me, “*There’s a baby in the boiler*.” 

What the fuck? She’d gone down to the basement to find some arts & crafts stuff that we hadn’t unpacked. By her account, someone was crying inside the boiler. Screaming. 

“*Like a baby,*” she said, more interested in the brass animals on my bookshelf, “*But bigger, louder - echo-y, y’know?*” 

I said I didn’t know and that she shouldn’t lie, which caused a tantrum. I understand why. My daughter’s never told tall tales, something that worried me a year or so ago but is very admirable now. She’s not like other kids - she’s creative, but never feels the need to fib.

I sat her down on my chair, the big chair, and calmed down the tears, apologizing as I hugged her. She wiped some snot away from her nose and giggled when I gave her a tax form instead of a tissue to blow her nose. I asked her if she heard or saw anything else down there. 

“*I was worried about the baby,*” she said, “*So I tried to look for a hatch or something, but there was just a bit of metal with bars.*” A grille. “*There’s a big black stone behind the bars, like a black diamond. As big as a baseball.*” 

That seriously didn’t make any sense to me, so I assured her that I understood and that I’d have a look later. Instead, I locked the basement door while she was having a bath. And I certainly didn’t tell her that the whole thing was scaring me shitless.

I talked it through with the wife that night, once our daughter was in bed. A bottle of wine. Restrained, insistent voices. She thought our daughter had overheard us talking about having another kid. I floated the idea that maybe she did hear something, because that boiler sounds fucking weird. I got accused of downplaying a serious issue, such is my way.

Our voices became less restrained and neither of us went to bed happy, but at least the argument distracted me from the goddamn boiler, which seemed louder that night. Whinier. As if the wheezing groans had turned to sobbing. The creaking floorboards outside our room couldn’t be heard over all that sobbing.

Which brings us to tonight. 

My wife and daughter are at grandma’s house for dinner, a monthly tradition that usually gives me some time to get a little drunk and watch an old movie. I was in the living room an hour ago, doing exactly that. A glass in one hand, Rita Hayworth flashing a huge smile on the TV. But I wasn’t really watching her, nor was I getting buzzed. I hadn’t had so much as a sip since the movie started, which I didn’t notice until I realized that I was tapping my foot. I was tapping it so much that my whole leg was shaking. 

I realized that I wasn’t looking at Rita Hayworth. I was looking at the hallway. Staring, in fact. Listening out for the boiler. For a creaking door.

I wasn’t drinking because I didn’t want to let my guard down. Because part of me believed that there was something incredibly awful inside that boiler. I had no idea what it was, but I was fairly certain it wasn’t a baby, as my daughter had said. Something that had used a baby’s screams to lure her closer, *closer…*

*Fuck this*, I thought. I was clearly having some sort of silent panic attack. Maybe it was the stress of the move, or from my new work environment, only now catching up - yeah, that makes sense. I turned off the movie and poured the scotch back into the bottle, then went to the kitchen to clean up my dinner mess. That’s an old-school mental health trick - *when in crisis, do the fucking dishes.* Thanks, dad.

There I was, hunched over the sink, waiting for the hot water to come through, for that boiler to kick in. The tap rattled, then wheezed, then the cold water sputtered - and something nasty came out, instead. Pinkish-red sludge. Darker chunks and paler mucus. Stringy. Sulfuric. The sound of that stuff hitting the basin almost made me gag, let alone the stench. I turned the tap off and watched the curdled slime circling the drain. 

I’d seen that stuff before, nine years ago, in a delivery room. *Placenta. Mucus plug.* Words that came fast and struck like punches, followed by my daughter's words: “*There’s a baby in the boiler.*”

I rushed to the basement door. Forgot I’d locked it. Found the key. Sheer, blinding panic replacing the whine of tinnitus with a roar of blood in my eyes. But I could still hear the boiler from behind the door, screeching and sobbing with a voice that was very much alive. No longer remotely mechanical. But rather a deep, terrifying basso. Several octaves lower than any human being. And it was **SCREAMING**.

I wrenched the door open without really knowing what I was about to do. Was I there to save something or to kill it? I still don’t know. I still had enough sanity to find the light switch, but in hindsight, I really wish I hadn’t.

There was a deep gouge in the boiler, running its entire length. Jagged fingers of torn metal pointed at me. Something had broken out from the inside. The basement was, naturally, flooded. Springs and valves and god knows what else floated around in the unwanted paddling pool, but also stringy chunks of viscera and pale islands of slime. Hell on high water, as my dad used to say. The whole thing stank like a ruptured intestine, sulfuric but also metallic. Bloody.

And something, that awful something, was splashing around behind the boiler. I could hear palms swatting the surface, then remembered giving my daughter her first bath. The way her fat little fists had swatted the water in the exact same way. Christ, it made me retch.

I shouldn’t have made a sound. It rose into view, an enormous moon of a head, perfectly spherical and nearly grazing the ceiling. The rest of its body is as spherical as its head, rivulets of fat and flesh soaked in rivulets of mucus and blood. The flesh is an angry red, interrupted by huge bruises that are almost black. And it turned to me, a foot of water barely soaking its ankles, and my eyes bulged and my throat danced and the saliva in my open mouth evaporated, replaced by useless, shivering breaths.

My daughter hadn’t seen a black diamond behind the boiler’s grille. She’d seen one enormous eye. But it was a good description - both of those eyes are little more than glittering black voids, wet and unblinking. I saw no intelligence. The thing just tottered from side to side, arms bobbing up and down uncertainly, 500lbs of blistered and bruised flesh as its toothless mouth opened and closed, releasing black gurgles and babbles, like a blocked drain.

My legs moved on their own, carrying me back up the stairs without ever turning around. The baby - the abomination, whatever the fuck - well, it didn’t like that. Its face collapsed, eyes narrowing and lips descending with a furrowed brow. And it **SCREAMED**. Christ, it *screamed*. That noise hammered the breath from my lungs and finally forced me to twist into a mad, spider-like crawl up the final steps.

It followed. *Boom-boom-***BOOM**. Fists crashing against the steps. Crushing a few of them. That awful, horrible face growing larger and larger and larger until I slammed the basement door shut. **BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!** The door shook violently and I screamed and *CRASH*. One of the door panels caved outwards in a storm of splinters, followed by a hand the size of a shovel, blindly groping. I pushed myself flush against the wall, three feet away from the door, and it still almost grabbed my throat.

I’m now in my office. Half a bottle of scotch down and barely able to find the computer keys because my fingers are shaking so much. I called my wife and told her to stay at her mom’s tonight. I made her promise, but I know she won’t listen. That’s why there’s a revolver next to the keyboard.

The baby hasn’t broken through the basement door. I think it’s gone back to splashing around in the reek and the filth. It’s not a baby. I have to keep telling myself that. It’s bigger than a silverback gorilla and almost killed me because I tried to walk away. If my wife and daughter come home, it’ll kill them. 

I haven’t touched the revolver since I bought it, which was a few days after my daughter was born. Not a gun guy. I drive a Lexus, for fuck’s sake. I almost left the bullets at the old house, because you just have to wave a gun at an intruder to scare them off, right? Not this intruder.

After I post this, "for the record" or whatever, I’m going to take the revolver down to the basement. To protect my daughter. That’s what fathers do.
