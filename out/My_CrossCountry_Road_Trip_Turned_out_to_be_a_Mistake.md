When I finally graduated high school, I knew exactly how I wanted to spend my gap year before selling my soul to a college for 4-6 years. I wanted to hit the road and see as much of America as possible. Get in my car and hit the interstate coast to coast. My parents were hesitant about allowing me to go at first, thinking I might go all “Into the Wild” on them, but I assured them, that after my grand adventure, I would return safely back to the east coast and begin my college studies. And so they agreed and loaned me about $5,000 in an emergency fund, in case I needed to pay for anything. Although I wasn’t planning on staying in any fancy hotels, I wanted this to be an experience just as much as a vacation, so I planned to live exclusively in my car the whole journey. 



Kissing my parents goodbye, and plugging California into my GPS, I hit the road with a suitcase full of clothes, a backpack full of books and snacks, and a mind ready to find itself out there on the road. Now I could bore you all with my stories of crossing the country, from the time in the Appalachians when I saw a bear and a raccoon fight over a sandwich. Or one time in Ohio when I could’ve sworn I saw Bigfoot. Or even the time while resting on the banks of the Mississippi where I watched two dudes battling a raft up the river Huckleberry Finn style. No, that's not why you’re here. You’re here to know about the mansion I stumbled upon.



 Now, I had left the East Coast right at the tail end of Summer, in August. I had hoped to get to the Rockies in time before it started snowing. But I also was taking my time and enjoying the trip, living my life as I wanted and even resting a few days at the same rest stop to take a break from driving. Unfortunately for me, Mother Nature had other ideas about when she wanted it to start snowing. I was driving through the Great Plains, marveling at the endless flat planes, when the first snow began to fall in mid-October. 



I decided to stop at a rest stop and wait the first storm out. Unfortunately for me, it was full of truckers thinking the same thing I had. I didn’t mind at all, after all, there isn’t a harder job than being a long-haul trucker, so I continued on the road, hopeful that I’d find a new rest area. I drove a few more miles, happy that I had decided to get a full tank of gas a few miles back. I made sure to turn the heater on and bundle up with the winter jacket I had been thankful that my mother had forced on me. 



It was smooth sailing until the snowstorm turned into a full-blown blizzard. My phone vibrated, alerting me to the terrible weather conditions. Now my car is old, a hand me down from my uncle, and her tires are not good in the best conditions. So you can imagine how badly she was handling in a blizzard. I was thankful that I was the only one stupid enough to try driving in the weather because my car began drifting in and out of the lanes of traffic. 



I pulled over to the side of the road finally, and laid back in my seat, thinking over my options. Looking at my phone I saw that there wasn’t another rest stop for at least 20 miles. Not terrible at all in normal weather. In a blizzard it was suicide. But if I stayed here on the side of the road, I ran the risk of my car getting snowed in and trapped. Not to mention a snow plow just showing up and burying my car in even more snow. So I was presented with two unfavorable options. Risk the weather and keep driving towards the rest stop, or wait for the storm to blow over on the side of the road. 



And I made the worst decision. Deciding to just drive slow and go for the rest stop, I started my car back up and returned to trying to drive in the increasingly difficult to navigate weather. I told myself that if it got too bad, I would just pull over and wait. I kept driving for about another half mile, barely going 10 mph in fear of my car spinning out and sending me into a ditch. Vision dropped to just barely past my high beams, and I was seriously starting to question my choice. 



As I made it about a mile and a half, something ran across the road. At the time I thought it might have been a deer. It sprinted across the road and I was barely able to catch it in my headlights. In a panic, I quickly turned to avoid it, and in the process sent my car into a hard spin. My poor traction sent me straight off into the road and my car ended up hanging off the edge of a bridge that was over a small stream. 



I woke up suddenly, with my face deep in my airbag. The impact had been enough to deploy them, and I was thankful that at least they worked and saved me from ending up more injured than I was, which amounted to a few aching ribs and some cuts on my face. I looked around the car and assessed my situation, and finally decided, I was fucked. My car was stuck in a shallow stream, judging by my lack of heater, the battery had been damaged and I was stuck in a blizzard. 



“God damn it,” I muttered to myself as I winced in pain and unbuckled myself from my chair. Already I could feel my body starting to shiver despite my body being clothed in several layers of warm clothing. I quickly grabbed my bag and started searching for something that could help. Then I quickly tossed it in the passenger seat when I realized it was the bag full of books, and grabbed the useful bag that my dad had given me. He always was one to be prepared for things like this to happen, and to my joy, I found a mini shovel and a road flare in the backpack. 



“You’re the best, Dad,” I said through chattering teeth. I reached over to the dash to get my phone, only to realize it wasn’t on its mount anymore. I looked around the car for it, but couldn’t find it anywhere. I elected to find it later once I could assess the car’s damage. Opening the door with some difficulty I was immediately blasted with a gush of freezing cold air in the face. Escaping my car, I quickly lit one of the road flares and walked around my car to assess the damage. 



The front end was bent upward, and it was clear that even if I dug it out and got it off of the edge of the bridge, there was no way I was driving it anywhere. I tossed the flare to the floor and quickly returned to the car, cursing my bad luck and renewing the search for my phone. I finally discovered it underneath the passenger seat. To my relief, it still worked, albeit with a large crack on it, but unfortunately, I had no reception at all. I had downloaded the map earlier to be able to know where I was going in a no-reception area like here, but now I was in the middle of nowhere, trapped in a snowstorm and in desperate need of reception. 



I decided to try calling 911, but although I managed to get through, I couldn’t understand a word of what the operator was saying as they just sounded like a jumbled mess of sounds and words. Slamming my head back against my seat I began breathing on my hands, trying to keep them warm as I tried to think of a way out of this. If it really came down it it, I figured I could maybe use one of the road flares to build a campfire. Or, hope and pray that a snowplow saw my road flares and stopped to help me. 



I wrapped my arms around myself to keep my body as warm as I could. I closed my eyes and sat there shivering for a moment, it was like I could feel all my body heat beginning to leave my body. I must have fallen asleep there shivering when suddenly someone knocked on my window. I flinched awake, suddenly painfully aware of just how cold I was. My body shivered uncontrollably and taking a quick look up at my rearview mirror I was scared to see my face was bright red from the cold. 



I looked over at my window and noticed that a heavily jacketed figure was standing there at my door. I was so happy to see another human I nearly reached out and kissed them on the spot. Quickly opening the door, the howling wind quickly shut off any conversation we might have had. I didn’t know how long I had fallen asleep, but it had been enough for the entire area to suddenly transform into Antarctica. 



The jacketed figure motioned towards me and then pointed at a car that was also pulled over to the side of the road. They motioned for me to follow. I nodded at them and quickly gathered my two backpacks, following after them as the snow and wind continued to slap my freezing face over and over. They opened the passenger door for me, and I quickly entered and was immediately greeted with the heater on at full blast. I quickly shoved my completely numb fingers against the vents. They were even redder than my face was and I was thankful that this person had found me. 



They soon entered the driver seat and pulled down their hood, revealing themselves as an exhausted-looking woman. She looked to be in her 50s and looked more like a disappointed school teacher than a guardian angel. But I didn’t care at all, she had just saved my life. 



“T-thank you so m-much.” I told her through chattering teeth. “I-I a-almost hit a deer or something a-and I almost ended up in the stream.” I told her as I desperately tried to get more heat into my body. She nodded and looked me over, she seemed disappointed in something at first but she quickly pointed out into the storm. 



“You’re lucky to have crashed so close to my patient’s house.” I looked at her in confusion. As far as I knew I had been driving past an enormous nature preserve, at least according to my GPS. “I shall take you up to his house to warm you up. He shall decide what we do from there,” she told me, as she put the car in drive and slowly drove up the road. 



The way she spoke seemed so empty. Like how a robot might talk to a person. But I figured from what she’d just said and by the look of her, that she was a nurse. So maybe she was just exhausted. I’m sure I didn’t sound much better, chattering like a cartoon character with every sentence. We rode in silence as the car had amazing grip and navigated the snowed-out road without any hassle at all. 



Soon we came upon a section of barbed wire fence. She told me to wait in the car as she bundled back up and exited back out into the blizzard. I tried to see where she was going, but visibility was so bad that I lost sight of her as soon as she exited into the storm. I waited a moment, still soaking up as much heat as I could. Soon she returned to the car, and without another word, she drove toward the fence. I thought for a second that she was just going to run the fence over, but instead, we drove through a gate that she had opened in the fence. 



After she exited again to close the fence, we proceeded out into the unknown. I could’ve sworn we were offroading for sections of the drive and yet this little car handled it like nobody’s business. And soon, a building came into sight. It was a massive plantation-style house, something straight out of Gone With the Wind.



“Who lives here? I thought this whole area was a nature preserve.” I looked over at my savior. She gave me a side eye as she continued to drive us toward the front of the giant plantation mansion. The crushing silence continued until she finally put the car in park and turned to stare at me.



“This is the house of Monsuier Jackon LeBlanc. Hopefully, he will allow you to stay until the blizzard passes.” She sighed and unbuckled her seatbelt. I nodded and did the same, only then realizing just how badly my ribs hurt. My pain must have been obvious as she looked over at me. “I suggest we head inside so I may assess your situation.” She opened the door and exited out into the whirling snowstorm. I sat in the car for a few more moments to enjoy the heat, before heading out with my savior, grabbing my backpacks, and braving the snow. 



Once I was inside the mansion, I was amazed by how beautiful everything was inside. Elaborate oil paintings hung from the walls, mostly of scenes of nature and of birds. On several pedestals were giant vases that looked to be from Ancient Greece. And thankfully for my freezing body, it was nice and warm. I dropped my two backpacks carefully onto the hardwood floor and marveled at the beauty that the mansion had on display.



“My name is Audrey. I’m Monsieur LeBlanc’s nurse.” Audrey finally introduced herself to me, as she took off her coat and walked over to me to take mine. I started taking it off, but immediately let out a pained grunt, and doubled over in pain. Audrey quickly came over to me and caught me before I fell to the floor completely. 



“Ms. Audrey? Have you brought in someone from the cold?” Another female’s voice pulled my attention back up from the floor to look over at the source of the voice. A maid was standing in the doorway, with a similar look that Audrey had in her eyes. Tired, hollow, robotic tone of voice. I almost thought that they were related. 



“I discovered him trapped in the snow. Poor thing seems to be in pain.” Audrey told the maid as she helped me walk over to one of the nearby fancy resting chairs. I sat down and allowed Audrey to fully take my several coats off. She pulled my shirt up and let out a quick, “Oh dear,” fall out of her lips. 



I looked down and quickly regretted doing so as I saw the enormous bruising forming from where my seatbelt had stopped me from going through my windshield. She quickly dropped my shirt back down and walked over to the nurse. The two discussed something as I sat in the chair, the pain starting to throb up from my ribs. 



“Can you walk, Mister?” Audrey and the maid walked over to me, for the first time since I’d met her, Audrey actually displayed an emotion. She looked worried over my condition, while the maid seemed to be annoyed at the melting snow that had started to melt onto the floor. 



“Nathan. And yeah, I think I can.” I told Audrey as I pushed myself up from the chair and staggered to my feet. Audrey offered me her arm to help support me, and I readily accepted it. She led me down the extravagant halls and over to a room that revealed itself to be a simple bedroom. 



“Take your shirt off completely, I want to make sure you aren’t about to bleed out internally.” She told me as she helped me sit down on the bed. I nodded as I noticed the maid had brought my two backpacks and my jackets, and managed to pull my shirt off with much pain and effort. Audrey produced a stethoscope and began to carefully listen to my vitals. She examined me as carefully as she could, but I still let out a few pained grunts. 



“Lucky you that only one of your ribs is broken. Without an x-ray, I can’t assess more of the damage, and with this storm, I doubt that an ambulance can get to you.” She spared a glance over at the maid who was hovering over her like an angel of death. “Until the storm passes you’ll stay here. We will speak to Monsieur LeBlanc about this, as I’m sure he will want to meet his guest.” Audrey stood up and looked at the maid who stared back at her before turning to exit. 



“I’ll return with some ice for the bruising, and something to help ease your pain.” Audrey bowed at me before leaving me alone in the room before I could thank her. I wanted to lie down on the bed, but even just turning my body to look down at the mattress was too much pain for me to handle. Instead, I walked over to my bag and started to search for a book to read, hoping that doing something other than just sitting there with this throbbing pain would take my mind off of my ribs. 



A few minutes later I heard what sounded like a cart being wheeled towards my room. I quickly placed my bookmark into the book and sat it down on the bed, expecting that Audrey had arrived with the promised ice and pain relief. Instead, I was met with an old wooden wheelchair with what appeared to be a man sitting in it. 



His face was covered by a silver mask, and he wheezed something fierce from his wheelchair. A large blanket covered his lower body and it looked like he was a few hard wheezes away from death. I stood up from the bed carefully, feeling the need to stand in my host’s presence. 



“It’s not often that we have visitors. Especially in weather such as this.” The man’s voice was like nothing I’d ever heard before. It was as if a speaker was playing a clear voice from somewhere. As if he was communicating to me through a scarily good text-to-speech device. 



“I uh…crashed my car not far from your beautiful house. Audrey found me and saved me before I froze to death,” I said with a small chuckle, quickly regretting it when my ribs screamed in pain at the sudden movements of my lungs and diaphragm. 



“Yes, it was quite fortunate of her to find you.” The man took in a deep wheezing breath before he flopped his head over to the side to look towards his maid. “You could not have gotten him a better room than this one?” he asked her, his strange voice sounded disappointed, but it was like he was pretending to be disappointed. 



“Well, Monsieur, this was the only room…we had ready.” She looked over at me before quickly finishing her sentence. She leaned down and whispered something into his ear. He sat there breathing momentarily before taking in another deep wheeze. 



“I hope the room is to your liking. Audrey will attend to you after she has seen to my needs. I hope to see you for…dinner.” The maid quickly took hold of the wheelchair and spun it around to exit the room before I could even answer him. 



I let out a sigh, quickly regretting that also as my ribs cried out in pain. I wanted to join them as I sat there on the bed, really hoping for Audrey and her pain relief. But judging by how badly LeBlanc seemed to be ill, I didn’t really mind her taking long. And to my immense joy, she soon showed up with the promised ice and painkillers. 



“So,” I asked her as she carefully wrapped my torso in bandages. “What’s wrong with LeBlanc?” I asked, trying to make conversation, while also wanting to be nosey. Seeing what looked like a living corpse with a silver mask on his face was enough to rouse anyone’s curiosity. She looked at me for a moment before glancing over at the door. 



“Monsieur, which you will address him as from here on out, has a genetic condition. It is the plague of his family, unfortunately,” she said as she took my hand and sprinkled two pills into my palm. “If you’re truly curious, you can ask him yourself at dinner.” She watched me take the pills and handed me a glass of water to wash it down. I swallowed with some difficulty but managed to get the pills and water down easily enough. 



“What do I wear? As nice as these bandages are I doubt this is proper dining attire.” Audrey flashed me a smile for the first time since we’d met. It felt like seeing a quadruple rainbow in the sky. “My clothes are in my suitcase, which is still in my car,” I told her, Audrey nodded and looked over at the wardrobe in my room. 



“I’ll ask Jane if we have anything that will fit you.” After she finished up with her quick checkup of me, she left me alone again in the room. Feeling the effects of the painkillers I was able to walk easier. I walked over to the window and pulled the curtain back, staring out into the great white void. As I was about to leave the window sill I looked down at where my hands were. Scratched into the window sill were the words, SAVE ME. I stared at these words for a moment. Was this some kind of joke? Or…



“Master Nathan? I’ve brought you a fresh pair of clothes. I hope these will fit you.” The maid, who I assumed was the Jane that Audrey had mentioned before, entered my room. I quickly turned to look at her, covering up the writing that I had discovered on the window sill. 



“O-Oh, thank you, Jane.” She seemed happier than when I had first met her, I supposed that now that LeBlanc had met me and agreed to my staying here, she had decided to treat me like a guest. I walked over and accepted the pile of clothes. As I looked down at them, I noticed that one of the white dress shirts had a giant stain on it. Jane seemed to notice it at the same time as me, as she quickly pulled it back from me and hid it behind her back. She had a big smile on her face the whole time. 



“Seems a dirty one found itself in there.” She gave a little giggle as I stared at her with bewilderment. Before I could ask her about the stain she quickly turned to leave. Just as she exited into the hallway, she turned back to look at me, that smile on her face had grown larger and offputting. “Monsieur is waiting for you, in the dining room.” She waved goodbye to me, before closing the door. I felt my whole body involuntarily shiver at the interaction I’d just had with Jane. 



With some difficulty, I managed to put on one of the dress shirts provided for me and slip on the dress pants as well. They fit me surprisingly well for seemingly being clothes that were just lying around this mansion. Not wanting to keep LeBlanc waiting, I exited the hall and returned to the mansion's entrance, hopeful that someone would be waiting there to guide me toward the dining room. Unfortunately for me, Jane was standing here, waiting for me. 



“You clean up rather well.” She walked over and fussed with my hair like a mom would when her son tries to leave with a tangled mess of bed hair. I let her do it, before following her down the hall towards a far door that led into the dining room. LeBlanc was already seated at the head of the table. A small feast was laid out on the great wooden table, with several cloches covering trays, all ready to be served. 



“Nathan, our guest, is here Monsieur.” Jane introduced me, bowing her head towards the decrepit figure in the wheelchair. Audrey was standing by his side, keeping a watchful eye over him. I bowed my head slightly, still not able to bend much at all with my ribs in such pain. Jane pulled out one of the wooden chairs for me to sit down at, and with some effort, I managed to sit myself down. While I was starving after my whole ordeal, and having not eaten in two days while on the road, I just wanted to go to sleep in my new bed. But I was a guest at this mansion, so I had to be respectful. 



“I hope the food is to your liking,” LeBlanc wheezed out. His voice seemingly being unaffected by the silver mask strapped to his face. “You arrived on such short notice, we did not have time to prepare a proper meal.” LeBlanc sat in his chair wheezing as he stared at me through the black eye holes in his mask. 



“I’m sure whatever it is that you prepared for me is lovely, Monsieur,” I said with my best smile. The more I looked at LeBlanc the worse my sense of danger became. Something about him rubbed a spot on the uncanny valley. Is breathing, his movements, his voice, just about everything about him seemed like something pretending to be a human. 



Jane uncovered one of the cloches and revealed a large roast of meat with veggies and a platter filled with bread rolls. She served me some on a large silver plate and I stared at the meal for a moment, before looking over at LeBlanc and realizing that no food was sitting in front of him. 



“You’re not going to eat, Monsieur?” I asked him as I took the silver fork and knife into my hands and began to poke and prod at the meat before me. LeBlanc took a loud wheezing breath as his head flopped over to the side to look up at Audrey before he flopped it back over to me. 



“Unfortunately, my condition inhibits my ability to eat properly. I would not wish to burden you with the sight of me eating.” He sat there wheezing, that explanation seemed to have taken him an incredible amount of effort to explain. I quickly nodded and returned to my meal, cutting into the meat and starting to eat it along with the veggies. It tasted like pork, but the way the meat acted when I tried to cut it was more like beef. 



I sat there in silence trying to figure out what the meat was, before Jane brought forth a pitcher of wine and filled my cup with it. I silently thanked her for it before grabbing the glass and taking a small sip of it. It was some of the best wine I’d ever tasted. I spared another glance at LeBlanc and saw a torrent of saliva falling from underneath his mask. Audrey quickly noticed this as well and she quickly wiped it away with an available handkerchief. I sat my wine glass down and quickly looked around for anything to distract myself from. 



“An…ancsestor of yours, Monsieur?” I pointed toward a large oil painting of a man in a wheelchair, but in what looked to be an old military uniform. He also had a similar mask that LeBlanc was wearing now, although the one in the paining was ornately carved as opposed to the current one. LeBlanc looked over to where I was pointing and seemed to be confused for a moment before he nodded slowly. 



“Francois LeBlanc, Comte de Vermandois. Was wounded at the Battle of Waterloo. My family…goes very far back.” He explained, some excess spit sliding down his chin. I nodded a bit, before returning to my meal and focusing more on the veggies and bread than the strange mystery meat. 



“May I ask then, Monsieur, what you’re doing out here in the middle of nowhere?” A noble French aristocrat hanging out in the great plains didn’t exactly make much sense to me. He stared at me for a moment, and a strange cracking sound started to emanate from him. Audrey quickly leaned over and whispered something into his ear again. 



“You’ll have to excuse us, Nathan. The hour is late, and I must put Monsieur to bed.” Audrey explained, quickly taking hold of the chair and rolling LeBlanc away before I could get any kind of answer to my question. I put down my knife and fork and also stood up. 



“I’d better be getting to bed as well then,” I told Jane as she hovered around me like a fly. “Thank you for the food, Jane,” I told her, walking past her and heading back towards where my room was. I had been lucky to have paid attention to where Jane had led me because the mansion was a giant maze of hallways and doorways. All of it adorned with paintings and artifacts, I had to wonder just how rich LeBlanc was. Finally arriving back at my room, I breathed a sigh of relief as I closed to door and locked it from behind. 



I walked back over to the window sill and stared down at the message still scratched into it. I then stared back into the blizzard still raging outside. The wind whipped and whistled loudly, and I could practically hear clumps of snow falling from the sky. I walked back over to my new bed and sat gently before unbuttoning my dress shirt. I decided to see if any kind of pajamas had been left around for me, seeing as I didn’t want to sleep naked in a stranger's bed, in this weather as well. Despite the house being old, it had good enough heating, but I could tell that cold was still seeping in from the crack in the wall and the like. 



Opening the wardrobe I was met with another message scratched into the wood. The words, ‘MONSTER’ and ‘HELP ME’ were clawed into the wardrobe with what looked like human fingers. Because sticking out of one of the words was a broken piece of fingernail. I quickly slammed the empty wardrobe shut, and as I did I heard someone trying to open the door to my room. 



“W-who is it?” I called out, quickly walking over to my backpack and searching for anything that I might use as a weapon. I still had two road flares left, my small foldable shovel, and a tire repair kit. I quickly opened this and pulled out the sharp reamer tool to use as a weapon. 



“It’s Jane,” Her voice answered. “I brought you some pajamas.” She explained the sound of jingling keys alerted me to the futility of locking the door in the first place. I quickly hid the reamer tool behind my back as she finally found the correct key to open my door. She was all smiles as she hung the giant key ring back onto her belt and approached me with my pajamas all folded neatly. Tucking the tool into my waistband I reached out and took the pajamas from her. 



Without a word, she bowed slightly and saw herself out. Whether she suspected me of doing something, I couldn’t tell. But as soon as she was gone I quickly closed and locked the door. But this time I also grabbed one of the sitting chairs and pushed it up against the door. 



“Something fucked up is going on here.” I thought to myself as I quickly changed into my PJs and looked around for any further evidence. But those words were the only ones that I discovered. I quickly sat in bed, and despite how tired I was I decided that no matter what I wasn’t going to sleep. It was an uphill battle, I already hadn’t slept in two days and now I was in pain from a car crash, medicated on painkillers, and had a glass of wine. The odds were stacked against me. 



I paced around in my room, flinching at every creak and moan of the old house as the blizzard battered it from the outside. I was almost thankful for the fact that there were so few trees out here. If I had seen the shadow of a tree at that moment in the window I very well might of shit myself. I constantly checked my phone for updates but with no signal at all and the blizzard still raging, it was going to be a long night. 



Around 3:40 in the morning as I was losing the battle to stay awake I heard something tapping on my door. That was enough to jolt me awake, so I quickly reached for my bag and the reamer tool, and held my breath to listen and try to see what was attempting to enter my room. It tried to open the door, but when it found it was locked, I heard a low hiss. I gripped the handle of the reamer tool tightly and waited to see what would happen next. 



It all happened in a flash, as loud banging started on the heavy door. I quickly shot out of the bed and grabbed my bags. The banging continued, only growing louder and more intense. The door was solid wood and I was hopeful that whatever was pounding on the door wasn’t strong enough to break the door down. It wasn’t, but the hinges for the door were unfortunately not strong enough to withstand the force of the thing on the other side of the door, and with a loud crash the door was knocked from its hinges and fell through my room and crushed the chair I had pressed against it to splinters. 



“Naaaaathan!” My mouth fell to the floor as I watched LeBlanc crawl through the door. Gone was the wheelchair, he was crawling on all fours. Or rather on all six limbs. A set of long insect-like legs had sprouted from his body, and he looked like what a centaur would look like if it was mixed with some sort of bug. Where his chin was supposed to be, a large mouth with rows of sharp teeth and pincers revealed themselves. 



“Oh hell no!” I shouted, grabbing into my bag and quickly reaching for one of the road flares. As I did, he pounced on me and began to slash me with his long claws. I shouted and grunted as I tried to block his flurry of attacks. Slobber fell from his mouth onto me and to block him from biting anything important, I quickly shoved my arm into his mouth to block him. I screamed in pain as he slammed his jaws shut and a loud sickening crunch and squelch came from my arm. 



I fumbled desperately in my bag before finally pulling out the road flare, despite only having one good arm and one being chewed to pieces by a giant bug creature in a fancy suit. But to my immense relief, I managed to light the flare to life. LeBlanc let out a loud and painful screech as I quickly shoved the flaming object into his neck. 



He loosened his grip on me, and to add insult to injury I also slammed the reamer tool into his neck with it. LeBlanc screeched and shoved himself off of me as brown juice began to leak from the hole I had made in his neck. I got to my feet as quickly as I could and ran out into the hall, turning back I tossed the flare at LeBlanc. I stumbled out into the hall and winced in pain as I stared down at the mangled mess of meat my arm had been turned into. 



As I exited into the main hall and stumbled towards the entrance, I noticed Jane was carrying fresh bed sheets. Our gazes met, and she dropped the clean blankets to the floor. I reached toward my bag for the last flare in case I needed it. 



“How did you escape?” Before I could answer her question, a screech from behind me clued me to LeBlanc having been right behind me. I slowly turned to see him sprinting full force toward me. In a flash of a moment, I jumped out of the way and slammed myself to the floor, letting out a pained yell as my ribs screamed out in pain. I managed to catch a glimpse of LeBlanc leaping toward where I had been standing mere milliseconds before. But instead of tackling me, he was now on track to tackle Jane to the floor. 



LeBlanc tackled Jane to the floor and, seemingly undaunted by the fact he had the wrong target, began to rip her to shreds. He ripped her limb from limb and ate the pieces he ripped from her. As he was blocking my escape route I quickly shoved myself up and ran toward the nearest set of stairs in the hallway. I clutched my ribs as I ran up the stairs, every breath I took felt like a stab into my lungs. Making it to the top floor, I started to try and force open any of the doors upstairs, but none of them were unlocked. 



“Run, little rabbit, run.” LeBlanc’s voice alerted me as I was trying to force open a door. I quickly whipped my head back toward the stairs and watched him crawling up them, slowly and methodically, with blood and pieces of cloth sticking to his teeth. “I love it when you run,” He let out a series of clicks and cracks from his body. His mouth didn’t move at all as he spoke. Instead, he simply let it hang open and the words seemed to just come out. 



I turned to try and open any of the other doors on that floor as LeBlanc slowly made his way toward me. The sick fuck was enjoying the fact I was struggling and squirming. Finally, to my small relief, I found a door that was unlocked, and quickly I ran inside and locked the door behind me. It wouldn’t hold him for long but I only needed a few seconds. 



The room was completely barren of furniture, so I had to use my backpack full of books to break the window in the room. I threw it against the window and winced as it shattered into a storm of glass. The blizzard blew its harsh wind through the newly opened window and I was alerted painfully so to the fact I was only wearing a pair of pajamas. I was presented with two options, freezing to death outside or being ripped to shreds inside the mansion. I took my chances. 



Crawling out the window and staring down at the large drop before me, I was given a metaphorical push out of the window when LeBlanc smashed his way through the door. Without even bothering to look back, I leaped out of the window and landed in the snow below. Almost immediately I could feel the cold deep into my bones, and it felt like a million little knives were cutting into my skin. 



In the darkness and mixed with the harsh and uncaring blizzard, visibility was absolutely zero. With my hands trembling uncontrollably I reached into my backpack and pulled out the final flare. Lighting it and holding it above my head, I started trying to walk toward the highway. I barely managed to get a few steps when I heard the crunching of snow behind me. 



Flashing the flare towards the sound, I let out a scream as I saw LeBlanc crawling his way through the snow toward me. Now given even more fresh motivation to get away, I started crawling through the snow as quickly as I could. The snow at this point was just above my waist and trying to run away was nearly impossible. But there was a silver lining, the same weather that was hindering my escape was also hindering LeBlanc’s pursuit of me. 



I crawled my way through the snow and didn’t dare try and see how close LeBlanc was behind me. The sound of the snow and the wind was just enough to cover the crunching of the snow as he chased me. I thought I might escape, that was until I tripped on an unseen rock. I fell face-first into the snow and dropped the flare down with me as well. 



I thought for sure that I was about to join Jane and who knew how many other people LeBlanc had eaten. I lay there in the snow and waited for what was going to happen to me. I heard the crunching of the snow grow closer and closer, as LeBlanc crawled over to where I had fallen. He stood there for a moment, but to my confusion, he didn’t begin to eat me. I slowly turned my head to try and see what was happening. 



The flare was still burning and was able to illuminate LeBlanc as he looked around in what looked like confusion. He let out more clicks and his body shivered. He leanned his head down to where the flare was burning, illuminating him before he pulled away. 



“Nathan!” he shouted. He let out a loud screech again before he started walking again, following the path I had been taking. I lifted my head from the snow and watched him disappear into the darkness of the blizzard. It then hit me. LeBlanc is blind and uses what has to be an echolocation and most likely smell to find his prey. In the blizzard and with my body buried in snow, he couldn’t see me. 



I lay there in the snow for a few minutes, waiting until the flare finally died and I was plunged into complete darkness. I waited some more before I stood up and started walking again. Every little noise I heard from the blizzard forced me to quickly hunker down in the snow and wait for the noise to pass. Finally, I made it to the highway. My body was shivering uncontrollably and I was struggling to stay awake. I had lost all feeling in my arms and legs but despite this, I continued to walk up the highway. Hoping and praying that a snow plow would be out. I made it another quarter of a mile before I collapsed into the snow and passed out. 



When I awoke, it was in a hospital bed. A snow plow had discovered me unconscious in the middle of the highway. I was barely alive and already had frostbite on many of my fingers and toes. I lost two fingers on my left hand, and one on my right, and lost four toes in total. But, I had survived. 



I tried to explain what had happened to me to the police. But they didn’t believe me. Chalking it up to delirium from my near-death experience. I was too weak and in too much pain to fight it either. My parents flew out to be with me, and it was decided that I would cut my road trip short and go back home with them. 



I haven’t thought about LeBlanc since that night. And as much as I would like to keep it that way, today I got a package in the mail. Opening it up, it had no return address. And to my absolute shock and horror, it was the bag of books I had thrown at the window to break it. With it was a note. 



“Run, rabbit, run.”
