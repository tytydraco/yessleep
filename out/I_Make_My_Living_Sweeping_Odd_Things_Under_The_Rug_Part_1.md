Wherever there is a big enough grouping of people, there will be anomalies. Now, i'm not talking about mere statistical outliers, or what have you. I mean, weird things, the kind that don't necessarily conform to the laws of physics.

There is no blueprint on how they appear, or how each one goes about it's cycle, or if indeed even has one. Everything about them is odd, and prone to quick change. The only constant being that they appear more often in bigger groups of people, roughly. That's what makes them anomalies. Anything that can be observed, measured, and quantified properly, would quickly become just another natural law. Easy pickings for a pattern-seeker such as our species.

Sometimes they have a theme, sometimes they follow the scripture, pseudoscience, and other times, they truly are unknowable. There is no official decree from higher up that says they have to stay hidden, no men in black, no altruistic groups on the forefront of man's war on the uncanny. It's just each of us, individually, deciding that we'd rather not comprehend the ever-spinning prism of flesh, we'd rather not indulge in what might just be a deal with the devil, and we will throw a solid fit if anyone ever brings up the black cube of saturn, no siree. At least that's what i've heard through the grapevine from proper authorities.

I've had a book-club buddy once who was a cop. Somehow i've let it slip about my profession while we were discussing the classics of sci-fi, and he reassured me that i wasn't the only one dealing with such matters. He's seen, shot at, and under-reported his fair share of oddities. I'm sure you all would love to hear about some of these, so i'll skip you the boring non-euclideans streetcorners, and what we're pretty sure is a benevolent being with the capability to maim just by being seen, since everyone who \*would have\* seen it, goes blind for the approximate period that it \*would have\* been in their eyesight.

As i'm sure you've probably sumrised by now, since anomalies are tied to population density, they must be related to us humans, possibly even caused by our very existence, somehow. The highlights of my buddy's tales were as follows. A group of homless ranging anywhere from ten to twelve dozen, who did not possess names. It's not that they refused to answer to ones, you \*could not\* assign any title to them, not on paper, not in audio logs, not in your mind.

That's why he's unsure as to the count. It made talking to them one hell of a challenge. He'd have to converse with several at a time, so that the "You"'s he dished out didn't take on an individualistic quality. From what they've told him, there was once an ancient pact the learned sages of humanity struck with the supranatural. All the mages, warlocks, men of the church, druids, swamp-witches, and bankers got together, and ruled the world of fantasy to be incompatible with what our species was shaping up to become.

The story goes, that they've combined all of their arcane wisdom, all of the eldritch lore, natural gifts, favours with the Gods, money, and split the world apart in two. None of humanity was to ever be allowed to witness miracles or demons ever again. They've said, however, that as with all pacts, there was a loophole. The deal prohibited all who are human to mingle with the fantastic, but once someone ceases to be perceived as a person, the pact would no longer affect them.

According to what the group had told my friend, they were akin to a monastic order, teaching their fellow bums how to dehumanize themselves further, and how to master the unseen fantasy once they've passed the zenith point. Why all the effort you ask? The claim is, that only two groups of people can hope to become inhuman in the modern day and age. The filth, bottom of the barrel, homonculi scraped out of the of the gutter. Or, conversly, the elite few. The demi-gods of the modern era. Those thought of as not mere mortals, but puppetmasters and deities.. Indeed, they have claimed to be on a quest to slay the Scornful Soros, the Lich Dynasty of Rot-child, and even the Emerald Prince of The Red Planetoid himself...

Usually, they'd be laughed off as madmen on a crusade towards the end of the bottle, however.... To this day i can't ascribe a name to the group, no matter how hard i try, and, they've demonstrated their "powers" to my friend, by casting a "fireball". He claims they've failed in their attempt, but an "electrical fire" of a wholly unknown source did occur roughly where the uh- someone, had pointed their "staff" carved out of a chair leg.

The other story he'd sworn up and down was true, was about bullets and the discharge of thereof. Apparently, this happened to all of the guys at his precint. He worked in a small town, and has only ever discharged his firearm once outside of training, and then instead of a gunshot, he heard it.

The voices of Stonewall Protesters rang out, loud as a bullet, flowing through the air in place of the deafening bang. He SWORE on the grave of his grandpappy that it happens to everyone at the precint whenever a service firearm is discharged outside of the firing range. Now, i've never followed up on this with any of his coworkers, and he does have a rather strained relationship with his gay son, so i'm willing to take this one in with a grain of salt, but then again, weirder things have happened. I've seen fair few myself.

My first time was fairly standard, a poltergeist.

While in highschool, i've had a friend who shall be known as the Boxer. Boxer was a jock born and raised, as well as the school champion in just about anything to do with physical competition. A tall and stout beast of a teenager whose bulky body contained the speed of a japanese bullet train. He enjoyed it in a manner pure and mindless. "It's just fun to move your body", he'd say, whenever asked about the source of his passion for the physical arts.

I myself prefered to indulge in the world of imagination. Tolkien, Vance, Welles and Orson Scott Card were more my speed.

We were friends not because we shared said inclination, but because he was friends with just about everyone. Just the kind of guy the Boxer was. A real golden retriever that one.

So, one evening we were feeling especially frisky, and have found ourselves in the retired ladies lavatory, which was generally thought to have been haunted by something. I'm not sure how deep in the red the school must've been to have kept that place around in the state it was in. It was located all the way in building C, the prettiest, and oldest out of all of them given the beautiful pre-war architecture, devoid of the usual obsession with square shapes and sharp edges.

The ancient doors leading to the abandoned ladies restroom were decrepit, awfully moist, and thoroughly rotten with mold. The line of green decay sliced through the middle in a fashion that brought to the mind the precise swordsmanship of the samurai.

The condemned restroom has been a hotbead of rumours and ghost stories well before it was ever put out of comission. Many a girl have spoken of the feeling of being watched, of eerie things happening on the rare few occasions someone went in there on their own. Perhaps the most damning piece of the evidence was the concussion of one of my classmates, which occured in full view of about a dozen of her co-students, and resulted in the closing down of said bathroom.

According to the eyewitness testimony, she was lifted up by an unseen force, flipped around as if by a giddy baby who had just gotten a new toy. and then violently launched towards the wall in the blink of an eye.

Luckily, she survived with minor brain damage. Her grades dropped somewhat, especially mathematics, but she ended up graduating and going to college, much to the shared joy of everyone.

As tragic as the whole event was, it struck me as interesting because of the sheer number of witnesses involved. In the world of conspiracy and cryptids, the more people accurately describe an event without contradicting one another, the higher are the chances of said anomaly being real.

In the days following i spoke with many of the girls who were present during the "haunting" to prod for details. I was equal parts excited and ashook when all of their accounts lined up perfectly.

One of the upperclassmen, a tall reserved girl who had seemingly skipped puberty altogether, had this to say: "I draw, you know? To make a really good illustration, you need a reference. I've often used pictures from sports magazines growing up. These really let you understand the whole of the human body. Anyway- what i'm getting at is this.

That girl had flown how a perfectly pitched ball in baseball would. Whatever force lifted her off the ground... I could clearly visualize it in a pitcher's pose, a hella' dynamic one at that. The whole body contorting to transfer all the energy it could muster into the "ball" at play. Everything from the bend of it's knees, fluidity of motion, and even the composition of the fingers over the "ball"... I just couldn't imagine it being anything less than a perfect fastball."

Another girl, one of the more popular ones who had once flirted with a special needs student for a laugh, had this to say: "It reminded me of movies, yunno. Like when they're trying to make someone look super-fast in a superhero schlock. I expected the afterimage but there was none, just a blink of colours and a thud."

Boxer and I passed through the moldy doors, and got to snooping.

There was a perfectly girl-shaped crack in the wall. The school hadn't bothered to clean any of it up, instead opting to simply decomission the bathroom as a whole. Dried blood covered the edges of the impact area.

Boxer leaned down to look me in the eyes, and asked: "Do you really think a ghost did that? Just like something out of the pulpy stories you read?"

I replied "Well, that's the only logical explanation there is, isn't it? Do you think a highschool girl could launch someone with such force? There isn't any explanation other than a ghost."

Boxer gave it a solid thought.   
  
In media, beefcakes like him are often depicted as lacking intellectually. That is nothing more than spiteful propaganda spread by the wretched and envious people, who have ventured into creative spaces not out of love, but to make up for their various complexes and weaknesses. Physical health, and thus fitness, is more often than not deeply correlated with intelligence. Strenght is a virtue, after all.

After a brief consideration, Boxer agreed with me. 

Therein laid the proof of his intellect. He was able to concur with a seemingly bizzare, yet undeniable piece of evidence laid out in front of him in an instant. To admit the existence of supernatural, even while staring it right in the eye, would have broken a lesser man. Not my friend, though.

Given, as smart as he was, his personality still was that of a musclehead. After concluding the supernatural was real, and that a ghost had assaulted one of our classmates, he reached the following conclusion.

Still leaned over to meet my gaze, his brows furrowed, his face turned to an expression of righteous fury. He said this: "Dammit! That's just so unfair. A person assaults another, they go to jail, right? But a friggin' ghost can just do this as he pleases, and face no repercussions, no justice, no nothing! Our friend is stuck in a hospital bed, and the ghost is what... Kicking back and-"    
  
At this point, something odd has happened. Boxer was no longer leaning over in order to be on the eye level with me, or rather, for a reason that has at the time eluded me, somehow, inexplicably i have risen above him midway through his passionate monologue, and he was now looking up at me. He realized what had happened the slightest bit earlier than i have. I was being lifted from the ground by the being that had already injured one of ours. 

Boxer jumped up in an attempt to get me down, but he was immediately launched back with great force. Had it been anyone but him, a second person-shaped crack in the wall would have appeared right then and there. Instead, he steadied himself, his long legs resisting the push. It looked like he was fighting a mighty gust of wind. In the end he was pushed all the way back against the wall, and the Poltergeist had given up.

To put it all in perspective, i will now invoke one of the fondest memories of my teenage years. About two years before the bathroom incident, when Boxer and i were about fourteen years of age, a powerlifting television show had set up one of their challenges on the traintracks used by the local chemical plant.

The athletes were pulling trains. Literally. When i first heard of it, i was as surprised as i was intrigued. A man could pull a whole train by himself? I did not believe it, but i wanted it to be true more than anything. What a sight would that be.

I wouldn't know it until much later, but train pulling was a fairly common competition among the elite powerlifters, the tradition preceding even the second world war which would define the modern era. In 1938, weighing 178 pounds, the great Charles Atlas towed a 145,000-pound train car through the Pennsylvania Railroad's Sunnyside yards. Using a rope, he moved the heavy car 122 feet along the tracks. I have Boxer to thank for knowing this incredible factoid.

Indeed, the only reason i've seen a train be pulled in person, was because one of his personal heroes performed on the show. He was scheduled to pull a one hundred and fifty-ton train, all by himself. Boxer had been recognized in a couple of local competitions, both for athletics as well as youth strongmanship, and so, was allowed to spectate the event. 

His champion of choice managed to break not only personal best, but as of then world-record in train pulling. The man was incredibly kind and personable. He gave both of us autographs, although i cared much less than Boxer did about such things. Afterwards, Boxer had requested to have a go at the train.

He was allowed to do so, in spite of the glaring safety concerns. A fourteen-year old boy attempted to pull a train which weigh one hundred and fifty tons, and he managed to do so. Of course, he didn't move it far. It budged slightly, i'd say, about ten centimeters ahead, before Boxer could pull no longer. Even those ten centimeters of distance rendered him into a heaving, wheezing puddle of sweat the shape of a boy.  
  
The Poltergeist managed to push back up against the wall someone who at the age of fourteen moved one hundred and fifty tons of steel. Seeing this scared me far more than the sheer existence of supernatural.

In the brief moment it took Boxer to compose himself, i could feel my limbs give way and bend. I was now shaped more like a ball than a man, and i could not resist in any meaningful manner. Just as Boxer had lunged at the Poltergeist, or where he thought he stood, i was launched.

I blinked, and when i next opened my eyes i could feel broken bones move about in one of my limbs. It seemed like i landed on the side, letting my left arm and ribs take the brunt of it. As favourable as the position was, i definitely had suffered from a concussion alongside it.

Air escaped my lungs, a menagerie of lights came about in my vision, and i knew that death would be soon to follow if nothing changed.

As he lunged, Boxer was grabbed by the Poltergeist at one of his arms, and suspended mid-air. However, unlike myself, he wasted no time in bewilderment of the situation. Whether it was due to reason, or instinct, he must've figured out that if something can touch you, it should be possible to touch it back. Faster than a lightining strike, Boxer had shot up and head-butted in the general direction of his assailant. Even through my concussion i could hear the crack, but it wasn't Boxer's skull that gave way.

He must've struck the ghost real well, because he was immediately let go of, and landed on the cold bathroom tiling gracefully. He steadied himself for another bout, and desperately tried to scout around for any signs of his ghastly enemy. It seemed like the Poltergeist had been scared straight, because it was now awfully cautious. He waited for a few minutes before striking at my friend with a careful and measured punch.

The imprint of his sizeable boney fist was visible across Boxer's chest. My friend was up and aware, but even a prodigy like himself couldn't have reacted in time to a strike by an invisible foe. He almost fell down, before weakly striking back at nothing in a desperate bid to defend himself.

Ever so compassionate, he screamed at me to "Get out of here! Get someone to help, i'll try to hold this thing back so it doesn't get you!"

Perhaps it was the traumatic brain injury talking, but i've had a far better idea. I wasn't about to turn tail and let a supernatural brawler slaughter my friend.

Niccolino Locche was a small man, and one of the greatest boxers of all time. The argentinian welterweight world champion did not pack a punch, but in turn, he could not be hit. His technique, footwork, dexterity and relaxed movements allowed him to outright avoid having to incure damage. Something of a rare privilege in the sport.

He was perhaps one of the few world champions of anything who has peacefully retired bearing no major health complications. He was so relaxed in fact, that during some of his exhibition matches against far bulkier fighters, he puffed up on cigarettes midway through, bobing and weaving while his lungs filled up with nicotine and tar. He could do all this and more, because of a training technique known as "shadow-boxing".

Visualization is king in competetive sports. It's what seperates the professionals from the bottom-feeders more than genetic predispositions ever could. Shadow-boxing on a low level entails pretend-fighting against most commonly used kinds of punches and grapples. That isn't what Locche was doing.

According to Locche himself, he trained very little and was self-admittedly a very lazy man. He freerly spoke of smoking up to fifty cigarettes a day, sometimes even during his matches as mentioned above. His trainers have gone on record stating that he'd often weave out of practice as if though he was dodging a deadly strike. However, this isn't the entire truth.

Locche was quite poor growing up. From an early age he was to help with the farmwork, and around the house. As i'm sure you all know, farmwork isn't very interesting, and children would do rather anything but. This lead Locche to develop a rather quite impressive sense of imagination. He'd conjure up tall tales to occupy himself while plowing the fields, or hauling feed.

Such imagination, coupled with his inherent gift of reflexes and the innate understanding of the human body resulted not only in a world welterweight champion, but also perhaps in the best "shadow-boxer" there ever was.

All it took Locche to completely "read" an opponent was as little as a single glance. Whenever he "trained", he simply pretended to be making a mook out of whatever fighter he'd have to contend with next, all while goofing off to the imaginary crowd of the mostly-empty gym.

As it turns out, the way to enlightement is not a rejection of the human form like so many new-age fools  proclaim, but rather the innate understanding of it.

Now, i was no Niccolino Locche, i was not even close to a boxing amateur, but i've had plenty of imagination to back me up.

I believed that if only Boxer knew where to strike, he could beat the Poltergeist. I closed my eyes, fought through the swerving lights bubbling beneath my eyelids, and got to thinking. I had to be quick about it.

Firstly, the ghost at play had to have been rather sizeable. Not only could he lift humans up like they were nothing but pebbles, but he also managed to push Boxer against the wall, through the whole lenght of the bathroom. I imagined long, spindly arms endowed with unnatural strenght. Lenghty arms, implied a proportional body. In order to reach through the entirety of the bathroom, the Poltergeist had to have been huge. Would he have even fit under the bathroom's ceiling? Perhaps if he was crouched down. There was no evidence of him being awfully fast, and so, i concluded that must've been the case. At the very least i've had no better idea.

Lastly, i sifted through the witness testimony that i had so eagerly gathered, as well as the many creatures i've come to know throughout my enjoyment of science fiction literature. Images of bugs, demi-humans, little green men and tall greys with bulging eyes came and went. In the end, i settled for none of them.

My upperclassman had mentioned the bend of it's knees. It was the smoking gun. I was inclined to believe the mind's eye of an artist over my concussed mind. The Poltergeist must've been shaped like a giant. A bulky man, homicidal man. Like Saturn devouring his children in that one famous painting. 

I focused on that mental image, and opened my eyes, but the silhouette i hoped for was nowhere to be seen. There was one more thing i had to do before i could do it. I fought back against the pain pulsating through my body, resisted the temptation to fall unconscious, and screamed.

I meant to bellow out something witty. Perhaps insult the Giant's throwing technique, perhaps proclaim that we'll avenge our friend no matter what. What came out instead was a gutteral pained screech, but it had done it's job.

I was violently grabbed and lifted from the ground. Before i was thrown oncemore, and likely killed, i managed to blurt out the crucial bits of information to my friend. 

"It's a giant man! Too tall for the ceiling, head should be half a meter up from mine if i got the proportions right!"

Boxer wasted no time. He lunged to attack, aiming precisely as i guided him. The starting speed he mustered at that time would have put Usain Bolt to shame. 

He managed to land at where i'd estimate the neck of the Giant was, latching himself around it, and then, he attacked. Have you ever seen a kindergartner fight? It was like that, no grace whatsoever. He simply locked himself on the Giant's neck with his legs, and began to pummel away at his head, no technique, no finesse, just the sheer brutality of fighting for one's life.

In his pained confusion, the Giant let go of me. I fell on my ass and quickly got up on my feet.

It must've been the first time such a thing has happened to the Poltergeist, because he was too stunned to even act for a moment. It took him five seconds, and a few dozen of brutal punches to the head before he had made himself intangible again. 

It seemed that he could either exist physically when he chose to, or become intangible at will. It made our situation seem almost hopeless. Boxer rushed to my side in order to protect me. We both stood there for a moment, anticipating another strike, but none came.

Was the Poltergeist too wounded to attack, or was he scheming something? I tried my best to focus and summon the mental image of him oncemore. He would likely not be unharmed at this point, and so, what were his options? He had to be careful, having found resistance for the first time in his existence. Then it struck me. He could become intangible at will, and then enter the world of the phyiscal at his leisure.

"Y-you need to duck! RIGHT NOW! The Ghost is IN YOU!" 

Boxers whole body immediately stiffened preparing for a blow he could not defend against. Instead of heading my advice, and ducking to avoid the impalment, he chose close his eyes, and take on a striking pose instead.

A second passed, and i imagined the Ghost manifesting itself with one of his lenghty arms in the middle of my friend's chest, skewering through him in a manner most unnatural. What happened instead, was more shocking than any paranormal event i would witness in the years to come.

Boxer had "rolled with the punch" at the very last second. Wherein i had the conceptualization skills necessary to figure out the mechanics of the Poltergeist, i knew next to nothing about fighting. Boxer however, knew a lot. He concluded that the enemy must've been fearing for his life at this point, and so, would settle for no less than a lethal deterrent. The Poltergeist would aim to make itself intangible, submerge it's limb deep within Boxer's head, and then materialize, exploding it from within.

The technique he used, was known as the Dampsey Roll, as i would later come to learn from him. It had existed in boxing for a while before Jack Dampsey had popularized it. Everyone knew what the expression of "rolling with the punches" means, but few knew just how difficult it was to implement in practice.   
  
In essence, a Dampsey Roll requires a perfectly-timed sharp angling of the head to the side, so that the incoming punch merely slides over one's face, as opposed to hitting them straight in the jaw. Only elite athletes were capable of using it in practice. I don't think any of them could've done it while fighting an invisible, intangible enemy, but Boxer has.  
  
 He executed it perfectly, and so, instead of his entire head being obliterated by the imminent materialization of the Ghost's arm, he lost only a sizeable chunk of his cheek and suffered deep lacerations to the side of his skull. Chunks of gore came loose and flew off of his face.

Whether it was the adrenaline rush resulting from his injuries, a move trained to perfection, or sheer luck, Boxer had at the same time, executed a perfect counter-attack.

His body compressed inwards like a spring, and he unwound to let out by far the nastiest uppercut i've seen in my life. I could hear it tear through the stale moldy air of the bathroom like a whip cracked. Then, a horrible crunch followed, and it was all over.

Something deep within the Ghost's skull gave way, a couple of his teeth must've chipped as his lower jaw was sent towards the upper mandible, and whatever served the function of the brain must've been thoroughly shaken. The Giant made no noise as he died. Only a meaty thud once his body hit the floor.

Even missing half of his face, Boxer still made an effort to take me under his shoulder, and help me up.

We crawled towards the safety, called in for an ambulance, and thus, concluded my first meeting with the paranormal.

I had gotten off easy, a couple of broken ribs, an arm that would never work quite as well as it used to , and minor brain damage.

Boxer on the other hand, had become scarred for life. Half of his face was practically gone due to the last desperate strike of the beast of abandoned girl's restroom. He lost the sight in one of his eyes. The fingers on his right hand had been broken, presumably by his last uppercut, and they never grew back the right way.

The rumour has spread around, and although neither the faculty, nor the police would admit it, everyone knew what had happened. 

When asked about the event, although he didn't have to, Boxer would always make sure to point me out as "The guy who helped me fight a Ghost!", likely saving me from the fate of a forever-virgin. Thank you Boxer. 

He would go on to marry the first victim of the bathroom ghost right after highschool. At the time i didn't know it, but he must've tagged along me for the ghost-hunt because of his feelings for said girl. What a great guy he was.

We still keep in touch from time to time, although these days i'm far too busy making sure no other overtly-athletic teenager has to duke it out against a ghost again. 

Now, with this little introduction out of the way, we can get into the real reason as to why i've made this post. A case far less benign than a Poltergeist of a Giant.

In part two, i will tell the currently-developing story of an insignificant office drone, whose body was forcibly compressed into the size of a grain of rice by an unknown force, why the event had rendered a whole big office building totally unusuable, and how it's my job to make the anomalous manmeat grain of rice disseapears.
