PART - I

My name is Franklin but I went by Frank. My therapist gave me the assignment of writing down what happened on that day in June, insisting it’ll help me process what happened. I think it’s dumb, it’s impossible to fix what I’ve done, the things I saw. I’d rather just forget it all and move on, reliving it won’t change what I did. But apparently that’s not healthy. She’s convinced I need to “confront what happened”. Whatever, I decided instead of a journal, I’d just post it here on r/nosleep. 

I’m supposed to write this in first person, she thinks it’ll help to put me back in the same headspace I was in during that awful day. Apparently it’ll help but like I said I’m doubtful. I don’t just agree with whatever people tell me anymore. 

I once read somewhere that people with 1 syllable names are something like 70% more successful than if your name had more than one syllable. Who knows if that’s true or not, but I needed any advantage I can get. So I went by Frank. 

At my previous job they fired the boss and replaced him with some 20 year old kid who thinks he is god’s gift to our company. All he did was mess the whole place up. All my coworkers were slowly leaving. We all hated the new guy but they all claimed that they had other companies that desperately wanted them, that they didn’t need this job. I on the other hand, needed this job desperately. 

The stress of it all was suffocating, especially with a baby on the way. We had only been married for 3 months at that point and the pregnancy was a shock, considering my wife’s consistent use of birth control. With everything going on, I couldn’t stay with this job. Now knowing that it didn’t matter if they fired me or not because the pay wasn’t enough to support us either way. 

So I sent out some applications and I got this job in sales at an insurance company. It was everything I wanted in a job. Opportunity for growth, a flexible schedule, good pay, I loved it and I seemed to be natural, despite never having done sales professionally before. I excelled in my first 2 months, already becoming one of the top salesman, with the help of Bryson my trainer. When we meet with potential clients, he’s always there with me, doing most of the heavy lifting, as there’s still so much I had yet to learn. But when it comes to people, I’m pretty damn good. 

I’m working with my trainer today, Bryson. He’s a tall young man around my age, with long hair that he constantly pushes out of his face. He wears his signature purple turtleneck and brown slacks. The same outfit he wears every time we run appointments, that I think is hideous and insane, considering the sweltering heat this time of year. But he slicks his long hair back, wipes the sweat from his brow, and swears that the purple turtleneck is what gets him his sales. I can’t argue with that, he’s only been with the company for about a year and he’s already one of the managers. Easily one of the most successful salesman in our office, I’m lucky to be on his team. 

Our first appointment today is with Lucan Mallory, a older man that I’d booked an appointment with over the phone. Lucan Mallory lives on Mallory St, deep in rural Indiana, about an hour away from town. Bryson tells me that the fact that the street he lives on has his own name, indicates either extreme wealth, or poverty. I’m hoping for the former. 

Im hoping that his family has been around for generations and have passed down land and wealth but Bryson is more cynical and assumes he just payed the state 20 bucks to name his street Mallory, apparently a common practice further out in the country. Despite his pessimism, I’m still holding out hope that he’s a generationally wealthy, older man who’s looking to buy a huge life insurance policy. 

According to the GPS, Lucan Mallory’s house appears to be at the end of a very long road far from where we both live. Because of how the rest of our day is booked, instead of meeting up and driving there like we normally would, we decide it’s best to meet at his house first thing in the morning. 

To avoid making the potential client uncomfortable, we agree to meet up once we get to his road and then drive up the rest of the way together.  I thought it would look weird to have two strangers pull up in separate cars to some old guys house at eight in the morning. Especially in an isolated location like this. 

Bryson is late so I arrive first. I pull off the main road onto Mallory St and immediately get the sense that my expectations of wealth were misplaced. The unpaved mess of gravel and dirt stretch out before me as it forces me to slow to a crawl. My car bounces and lurches over potholes and rocks, the suspension groaning, same as me. As I scan the road ahead I get a sense of the neglect and hardship this land has seen, not at all close to what I was imagining. 

The narrow road was cramped by trees, their branches tangling above me. Dead and forgotten leaves blew past me as the bare branches stretched down with their skeletal fingers, casting thin shadows, all of which were trying to scratch my car. 

I told Bryson that he’d find me, pulled off to the side of the road waiting for him. But as I carefully crept down the neglected road at a snails pace, I realized that there wouldn’t be space to pull over. 

That is, until about a half mile down the road. Suddenly the cramped road burst open into a large clearing. To my left, a short driveway, swallowed up by nature, wound its way to a looming blackened structure. I leaned forward and steered cautiously down into the overgrown drive, the crunch of gravel turning into the swish of overgrown grass. I tried fruitlessly to avoid unseen hazards lying in wait beneath the tall grass. 

As I put the car in park and crack open the door, the loud buzzing of cicadas envelopes me, a deafening scream that vibrates through the air. The sweltering heat sweeps in, chasing out the cold air from the car, instantly fogging up my glasses with a cool mist. I take them off as I step out into the weeds, squinting, carefully scanning the ground for mud. My curiosity drives me towards the blackened facade that dominates the clearing.  

Before me stands the skeletal remains of once large home.  A solitary, charred chimney rises, cutting the sky. Seemingly the only remnant of the house that withstood the test of fire and time. The rest of the structure lies in ruin. A tangled heap of charred wood lie blackened amongst piles of trash and soot, softened and deteriorated by the elements. Nature has begun to overtake the old burned down house, vibrant green shining through the dark ashy rubble. 

The remnants of a welcoming front porch, now ravaged and twisted, sagging under its own burnt weight. Everywhere on the ground lie the signs of a man with many vices. Burnt cigarette butts, crushed Coke cans and shattered beer bottles litter the ground.

As I stand there wiping the sweat from my brow and cleaning the fog off my glasses, I hear the crunch of tires approaching, overtaking the loud hum of cicadas. 

I turn around to see Bryson’s white Honda civic pop out into the clearing, a stark contrast to its surroundings. He rolls down his window. 

“Jeeze man, what did I tell you? I knew this wasn’t going to be some rich guy” Bryson says without a greeting. 

“Good morning to you too” I chuckle. “Hey man, you never know. Maybe he’s just a private guy who stays at home all the time. We still got like another mile or so to go. I wouldn’t blame him if he didn’t bother maintaining all this land. Maybe it gets nicer up ahead.” 

I grab my bag, lock my car and hop into the passenger seat as we take off back down the gravel road.

After another 15 minutes of slowly winding down the cramped road, it opens up into another clearing, far larger than the last. 

The clearing is dotted with rusting hunks of metal that used to be cars and tractors, abandoned and left to decay. Some sit on blocks, their wheels long gone, while others seem to be slowly being swallowed by the earth, their bodies half buried in the mud. 

The patchy gravel driveway dissolves into a mess of mud and overgrown grass, stretching out in front of the house. 

The house looks like no more than a massive, weathered shack. Its once white siding, now stretched loosely across the front of the house, covered in mold and grime, making it look like it’s been camouflaged green and brown by neglect. The poorly built front porch is sagged, buried under the weight of a mountain of crushed coke cans and empty bottles. What may have begun as a well intentioned recycling effort has devolved to a mountain of a pile, so large, there is no chance they’ll  ever be used for anything of worth now. The front porch has clearly become no more than a trash can. 

We park in front of the large shack of a house. Like the rusting vehicles out front, the house appears to be deeply abandoned and disgusting, left to rot. 

I turn to Bryson. 

“What on earth dude? There’s no way anyone lives here.” 

“Look the front door is open.” Bryson points out. 

“Yeah I guess you’re right. Do you think it’s worth spending time on this? This place looks disgusting and there’s no way he has any money right?” I say. 

“You’d be surprised, come on let’s check it out.” Bryson says as he opens his door. 

If only I had spoken up about my reservations and asserted myself, my life might have taken a dramatically different turn. I often wonder how things would have unfolded if we had simply driven away. But instead, I remained silent, and the consequences that followed still linger.

We walk up the sagging wooden steps, as they shift uncomfortably under our feet. As we make our way across the crooked porch towards the open door, we push loose cans and bottles aside with our feet, careful not to slip. The sound of a television drifts out, the professional voice of a newscaster, striking a stark contrast to the neglect and disarray around us. 

“Hello! Lucan?” Bryson yells into the house. His hand instinctively rises to knock politely on the open door, but hesitates, his fist hovering in front of the door as he takes in the layers of dirt and grime on the wooden door. He slowly drops his hand. 

As I lean to look over Bryson’s shoulder, I catch a glimpse of the utter disgust that lays inside, somehow making the outside of the house look tame in comparison. Every counter in the kitchen lies buried under large piles of dirty dishes, all encrusted with the remnants of half eaten foods, green mold covering most. Two corduroy couches,once red, sit in the living room, browned and covered in unidentifiable stains. Large piles of dirty clothes sit on top.  Every space between the living room and the kitchen that once was open, is consumed with trash, piles of it. I spot hundreds of discarded plastic bags, half eaten boxes of rotting fast food, and other miscellaneous junk. Amidst the chaos, a large metal tub sits in the middle of the living room. A desk lamp is duct taped to the side of the tub, emitting a dim red glow pointed inwards. The metal tub sits on top of a stained plastic sheet, surrounded by a scattering of dried dirt, feces and hay. I hear small chirps and things scuttling around inside. 

To the left of the kitchen stretches out a short corridor. Stairs go up on the right of the corridor and two doors line the wall on the left. There’s a faded, yellowed mattress, its bulk slumped against the corridors rear wall. A faint glow from behind casts a halo around its edges, the dull illumination causing it to stand out to the otherwise drab corridor. 

That’s when the stench hits me. A tidal wave of putrid air seems to crash down on me, overwhelming my other senses, making me breathless for a moment. The pungent smell of rot and feces mixed with the bitter smell of cigarettes assaults my nostrils like a physical blow and I struggle to hold back a gag. I immediately hold my breath and then let out a whisper in disbelief. 

“My god.”

Bryson looks back at me, nose crinkled, clearly disgusted as well.

“I don’t know man.” he chokes out, also holding his breath “Maybe we should go.” 

“JIMMY!” 

A booming, deep voice emanates from the house, tearing my attention back inside. An imposing figure emerges from the open doorway in the hall, his massive frame completely taking over the small corridor. His towering size is striking, he must be well over 6 and a half feet tall with long, strong arms. His impressive beer belly strains against the stained white tank top he has on. Sweat covers his chest, plastering the shirt to his skin as he moves. A wide, unsettling smile stretches across his face. 

The smile immediately falters, replaced by a mask of confusion that plagues his face. His eyes narrow as he takes us in. But then, he quickly furrows his brows, his face turning to a deep frown, sadness slipping through. But then, as quickly as it came, the frown morphs back to that same wide, unnerving smile. 

“Who the hell are you two?” His voice booms at us with curiosity yet his smile remains, never faltering. 

Bryson takes a small step forward, “Lucan Mallory?” he asks but before the man can respond, Bryson quickly says, “I’m Bryson, and this is my partner Frank. We had an appointment?”

The man’s eyes narrow with curiosity. 

“What kind of appointment?” The man asks, his smile inexplicably growing wider with genuine excitement, although I struggle to imagine why. 

“We’re here to discuss your life and health insurance.” Bryson says, confused. “My partner Frank spoke to you over the phone. We said we’d stop by the morning and see if we can’t help you out?” 

He suddenly booms with deep laughter. “Ok! Come on in.” But his words ring hollow, his tone suggesting he’s just playing along, with no actual memory our phone call. 

I look to Bryson with concern but he has already begun to walk inside. He easily navigates through all the trash, past the couches and stretches out his hand for Lucan to shake. He acts like this is all totally normal, his friendly demeanor a stark contrast to how deeply disturbed I feel by Lucan and this disgusting house. Lucan shakes his hand firmly, the smile still plastered on his face as he welcomes us into his world. 

“Welcome to Mallory Manor.”

Lucan brushes past us, his long strides carrying him into his living room. He pauses to gaze into the metal tub with a look of distain. Then he turns and with a heavy sigh, he collapses on the couch, shoving aside the tangled, dirty clothing underneath him. 

“Come, sit down.” Lucan says, his deep voice booming as he leans over to push the dirty clothing from the other couch onto the even dirtier floor.

“Thank you sir! Like I said, I’m Bryson and this is my partner Frank.” Bryson repeats his introduction, his voice cheerful as he steps over the clothing and sits down on the disgusting couch with a nonchalance that leaves me in shock. My eyes scan the couches revolting state. Crumbs and empty candy wrappers fill the edges, ants march in lines between the cracks. I spot a cockroach scurrying along the corner of the room and then dart under the couch. The couch is speckled with deep brown, unidentified stains, looking partially wet in spots. I can’t believe Bryson just sat down with such ease. As if this is just another day, another client.  

Lucan locks eyes with me, his smile burns away any sense of calm as it seeps deep into my very sense of being. 

“Boy. I can’t have you standing over me like that,’ he growls, his tone commanding. 
“Sit.” He demands. 

I find it odd that he thinks I’m standing over him, considering that even while sitting, he’s nearly eye level with me. 

I absolutely do not want to sit down on that disgusting couch. 

But instead of refusing, I meekly say. “Oh uh, sure sir, no problem.” My voice betraying a reluctance I dare not to show. I slowly walk to the other couch  as his eyes continue to bore into me. I try to find the cleanest spot as I sit down, deeply uncomfortable. 

Bryson forces a laugh, trying to ease the tension and steer the attention back on himself. “Thanks for the hospitality by the way and getting up early for us. I hope we didn’t wake you.” 

Lucan gaze lingers on me before slowly going back to Bryson. 

“Nah, I was up already. I was expecting someone.”

“Oh ok! So what’s this?” He points to the metal tub and leans over to peer inside. His eyes light up. “Oh man, baby chickens! Check this out Frank!” Bryson says laughing, somehow ignoring the stench. 

I lean over the tub, holding my breath again as the putrid smell intensifies the closer I get. My eyes start to tear up. I’m honestly baffled by Bryson’s nonchalance and professionalism. To be fair, despite the stench, the baby chickens are undeniably adorable. 

“Aww, that is too cute.” I say to Lucan, trying to sound friendly despite my discomfort. “How old are they?” 

“Couple weeks.” Lucan replies. 

“Wow, are they pets or are you selling them?” I ask, attempting to make small talk. 

Lucan’s smile widens as he laughs. Despite the context it feels like he’s laughing at me. 
“No, definitely not pets. Some guys in town will likely buy them off of me once they get a little bit older. I might even eat a couple myself.” he says.

While I know that’s normal around here, the way he said it was unsettling. 

Bryson abruptly changes the topic in a positive tone and says, “Hey, so Frank and I were talking on the way up here about Mallory Street! How cool is it that you have your own street named after you! Your family must have been around here for a long time or something right?”

“Nah no exciting story. I’m from all over.” Lucan says, “Some surveyors showed up about three years ago, wanting to map out the area and assign street names. I wasn’t  at home when they came, but my wife was. They asked her to suggest a name for our street, and she thought it would be nice welcome home gift for me- to have my street near my name, Mallory Street.”

“Oh wow, that’s sweet of her! Did you like it?” Bryson asks. 

“It was a nice thought I suppose… didn’t really matter in the end though.” Lucan responds. 

“Oh ok… Well we won’t take up too much of your time, I have this paper here,” Bryson pulls a yellow sheet of paper out of his bag as he breaks into the same speech I’ve heard at least 100 times at this point. 

“What I got here is called a fact finder! I don’t want to just sit here and suggest you buy something without first understanding the facts of your situation of course. 

This paper here has all the questions on it that I came prepared to ask. It mostly focus on your health and your finances. 

Now, Frank and I going to go very in depth with our questions, to get a full sense of your situation. So that by the end, you know and I know that whatever I suggest is in your best interest, does that sound fair enough Mr. Mallory?” 

Lucan laughs. “I’m not sure you’ll like what I have to say but sure kid, go ahead.” 

Bryson smiles, attempting to use his charisma to ease the tension. 

“Oh I doubt that! We’ve heard it all before, trust me.” Bryson laughs. “Ok! First question is the easiest. What is your full name and birthday?” 

“Lucan Mallory, December 12th, 1955.” Lucan says. 

Bryson scribbles that down on his paper as he moves on to the second question. 

“Great, thank you. So, do you have any family around here? I know you mentioned a wife earlier - got any kids that live in the area?” Bryson asks. 

Lucans smile returns again, but it feels very out of place. “Not anymore.” His tone is dark but not exactly sad. “No one comes around here anymore.”

“Umm gotcha… moving on then. Are you still working or are you retired Lucan?” Bryson asks. 

“Retired, 2 years ago.” Lucan says, his gaze drifting away, as a hint of sadness creeps into his smile. But when he turns back to us, the smile comes back. He reaches in his pocket and pulls out a pack of cigarettes. He lights one and takes a long, deep drag. The small light casts shadows across his face in this dingy house. 

“Oh congratulations Lucan! You retired at a good age!” Bryson says trying to be cheerful. “And what did you do for work?”

“As soon as I hit 18 I got drafted to Vietnam like everyone else. After the war I stayed in the military until I retired.” Lucan says, his voice filling with pride. 

Brysons enthusiasm on the other hand, immediately falters. “Oh ok…” Bryson says immediately loosing steam. “So I’m assuming you have a military retirement then? Do you still get your health and life insurance through them?” 

“Yep, I use the VA for anything I need.” Lucan says. 

“Oh ok, very good.” Bryson says. He uses enthusiastic words but his voice is barely above a monotone. I exchange a knowing glance with Bryson, both of us thinking the same thing. We got up early for nothing. 

A knot of anxiety twists in my stomach as I think about the hours we've wasted coming here, hours that could have been spent closing deals and earning commissions. Instead, we're stuck in this godforsaken house. My self doubt starts coming in full force. I was hoping this was going to be a really good client, none of our other appointments today felt that strong. I start to worry that today will be a complete loss. It's already Wednesday, and I haven't made a single sale all week. 

My gaze shifts to Bryson, desperate for a glimmer of hope, as he flips to the back of the page, bypassing most of the questions. Maybe he can figure some angle out to make this trip worth our while. He’s always finding opportunities that I miss. 

“So I’ll be honest with you,” Bryson says. “Given your extensive military background, we’re not going to be able to do much for you as far as improving your insurance goes. You’re already in the best position, so pat yourself on the back for that! I’m just sorry we can’t help you out more.” 

Lucan’s face lights up, almost kind looking for a moment. “That’s ok, I’m just happy somebody came by today. A friend of mine was supposed to come by today… this might be even better.” Lucan says, a big smile on his face. 

I feel a pang of pity for him despite his creepy behavior. Maybe, I think, his creepiness comes from loneliness and isolation, most likely made worse by the cluttered chaos of his home. Perhaps in the last 2 years of his retirement, he’s simply forgotten how to connect naturally with others. 

Bryson tries on final shot to make something of our long trip out here. “Let me ask you this then Lucan, when you left the military, did you have a retirement account set up? As financial advisors, we don’t only do insurance, we also work with retirees, helping them to make the most of their retirement funds.”

Lucan laughs deeply, but quickly devolves into a hacking coughing fit, making his years of cigarette use obvious. “Oh sure, I had a substantial retirement account!” He laughs still wheezing. “But I cashed it all out, spent it on this beautiful house you see here! Mallory Manor!” He gestures grandly, clearly proud of this disgusting dump.

I’m in disbelief. How could he have sunk his entire retirement savings into this dump?

“Ah, well, sorry we couldn’t help you out more. Thank you for your time sir.” Bryson stands up, signaling the end of our meeting. I can tell he’s ready to leave and so am I. 

Lucans smile crumbles into a deep frown. “No, you have to stay, are you sure I can’t get you anything?” 

I feel a twinge of guilt for the guy but on the other, I couldn’t care less. 

“No, thank you! We appreciate you giving us your time!” I say quickly, as I jump up off that disgusting couch and head towards the door. I’m already in front of Bryson, my right foot already out the door when I hear Bryson. 

“Actually, there is one thing,” Bryson says, his words stopping me in my tracks. There’s no way! We were so close to leaving.

Bryson shifts back and forth uncomfortably.  His feet doing the unmistakable “I need to pee badly” dance. 

“I normally try not to do this, but I had way too much coffee on the way up here and it’ll be a while till we hit a gas station. You wouldn’t mind if I used your bathroom, would you sir?” Bryson asks, his tone desperate. 

I stare at Bryson in shock, but then try and mask my surprise to not offend Lucan. Bryson must be insane. The thought of using a bathroom in this house disgusts me. If his living room and kitchen were any indication, the bathroom must be an actual biohazard. 

Lucans deep frown spreads slowly back into that deeply unnerving smile. 

“Of course I do. Come, follow me, the one for visitors is upstairs.” Lucan turns to start walking towards the stairs. When he turns I grab Bryson on the shoulder and give him a “please let’s go” look. 

Bryson gives me a look of desperation and whispers, “Dude I’m about to burst, I’m dying here. I’ll be quick I promise.” Bryson gives me a smile before he turns to follow Lucan towards the stairs. 

Lucan smile spreads even wider again as stands at the bottom of the steps, gesturing upstairs. “Follow me.” 

They both walk up the stairs. I can hear Bryson trying small talk with Lucan over the creaking of the stairs until they’re both out of sight. 

I stand in the living room, now completely alone, with only the droning of the TV and the occasional chirp of chickens breaking the silence.

After a moment, I pull out my phone, hoping to distract myself. I had already cleared my notifications earlier that morning, so there is nothing new. I opened Instagram, only to realize I have no signal. With a sigh, I shove my phone back into my pocket.

I watch the TV for maybe a minute before my mind wandered back to the conversation with Lucan before they headed upstairs. Something about it nags at me—why did he mention having a bathroom specifically for visitors if he also claimed that no one ever visited him? And didn’t he say he was expecting someone? If he has no family left, who could he have been talking about? As these odd inconsistencies tug at my thoughts, they’re quickly drowned out by the overwhelming clutter in the room.

I glanced around, finally taking in the mess in its entirety. It was overwhelming. Who on earth raises chickens in their living room when they have so much land outside? The smell alone was unbearable, not to mention the disgusting chaos surrounding the metal tub.

As I scan the room more closely, I notice religious memorabilia scattered everywhere.  A cross here, a statue of the Virgin Mary there. Piles of old newspapers cluttered the corners, with a torn-up Bible precariously perched on top. Among the hoards of junk were empty toilet paper rolls, dusty trinkets, and old toys. Towers of cardboard boxes loomed in one corner, all of it testament to what must be years of accumulation. A gun rack next to the entrance catches my eye, standing out in stark contrast to the disarray around it. Four rifles—or maybe shotguns, I’m not sure—sit in the rack, their wooden stocks polished and the metal gleaming. They’re the only things in the house that aren’t covered in dust or grime.

It had already been a couple minutes, though I wasn’t keeping track. I begin to inch further into the house, curious to see what was taking them so long upstairs. As I approach, the stairs reveal themselves one step at a time, each one cluttered with old clothes, dirty dishes, and empty bottles.

The stairs end at a hallway that branches off to the right, but from my vantage point, I can’t see down it unless I were to climb all the way up. A large American flag hung proudly on the wall facing the stairs, held up by duct tape at each corner. Like the guns, it was oddly clean.

I pause at the base of the stairs, straining to hear anything over the sound of the TV. Nothing. I take a cautious step up, listening intently. Still nothing. Just as I was about to take another step, a loud, booming laugh echos from around the corner.

Startled, I quickly run back into the living room, my heart racing. 

“How’s it going up there?” I call out, my voice carrying up the stairs.

I hear the stairs creak as Lucan descends, alone.

He bursts into loud laughter again when he sees me, his huge smile still plastered on his face, radiating, pure joy. It’s unnerving. 

“I had to do some quickly cleaning before he could use it, no biggie! Sorry about the wait.” 

He lets out a big satisfied sounding sigh and  as he runs his hand through his hair, a peculiar detail jumps out at me. I notice something that I hadn’t before. There’s a flat, short nub where his pinky finger should be on his right hand.

It’s a strange sight, but my attention is drawn away as he turns away from me and starts to saunter over to the couch. 

“Come, sit with me while we wait.” 

He sinks into the couch, letting out another big sigh of contentment. 

I just stand there, watching him warily, feeling an unwarranted pang of fear. The thought of being alone with this man frightens me deeply. Despite his friendly (albeit creepy) demeanor, some innate sense of self preservation is screaming at me to run.

“I said sit down.” He says, his done dripping with intimidation. His smile drops. 

“Yeah, of course. Sorry sir.” I quickly mutter as I return to sit in my spot on the couch. His smile comes back although it doesn’t quite reach his eyes. 

“Are you a god-fearing man Frank?” Lucan’s intense gaze makes me thankful that I can answer truthfully. I get the feeling he’s giving me some sort of test, one that I shouldn’t fail. 

“Yes sir.” I say. 

“Do you read the Bible?” His eyes narrow. 

“Probably not as much as I should sir.” I say with an awkward laugh trying to ease the tension. 

His expression turns dangerous and I quickly correct myself. I get the sense this is no time for jokes. 

I clear my throat and go back to being serious, “No, trust me, I do sir. I go to church every Sunday.” 

“Good. You married Frank?”  

“Yes sir. Been married a little over a year now.” I respond. I don’t want to tell him that she’s pregnant but I’m not sure why. 

Lucan begins to quote scripture, his voice dripping with unsettling fervor. 

“Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians, chapter seven… ‘But if they cannot contain themselves, let them marry. For it is better to marry…” he pauses, his eyes boring into me like a threat. “Then to burn.” 

The unnerving smile that was once plastered on his face is gone, which is almost more frightening. 

“Um, yes sir, of course.” I respond shakily. I look towards the stairs and then back to Lucan. “Man he’s sure taking a while huh?” I give an awkward laugh. “Maybe I should go check on him.” I start to get to my feet. 

“Stay where you are! I’m not done.” Lucan demands in a booming voice. The threat hanging in the air.

“Yes sir.” I say quietly as I sit back down.

Lucans gaze lingers on me, making me squirm. 

“Some people have… tendencies. Needs, I suppose you could call them. Evil needs.” 

His voice sends a chill down my spine. 

“Some people cheat on their wives, others kill them. It’s not their fault though right? That’s how god made them. God made us all in his own image, yet we all have unique needs. Do you agree?” 

I’m not sure how to respond. The last thing I want to do is upset him though so I say, “Yes sir. Of course, we all have needs.” 

He flashes me a crooked smile. “Do you?” Before I can respond the smile goes away. 

“For it is better to marry, than it is to burn. Right? God made us all with these… needs. I think he understands that though. He knows that sometimes we must… indulge in them. Only occasionally though, just so we don’t burn. Don’t you agree?” 

Again, I have no idea exactly what I’m agreeing to. All I know for a fact is that the last thing I want to do is offend him. 

“I do sir.” I say, nodding my head, trying to be convincing. But Lucans eyes narrow as he starts to scrutinize me. I notice my hands start to tremble slightly. There’s danger hanging in the air again. He doesn’t believe me. I clear my throat, trying to compose myself, and place my trembling hands on my lap. 

“Well… I agree sir but… just help me understand something. Correct me if I’m wrong, sir, but isn’t God like specifically referring to marriage in that passage sir?” I cringe slightly, anticipating his anger at the thought of my disagreeing with him. 

Instead Lucans face contorts into a patronizing smile. 

“Don’t be ignorant son.” Lucan chuckles, his tone dripping with condescension. “God speaks in riddles and principles, you know that. His words are layered with meaning and complexity.  If he spelled out exactly what he thought about everything, the Bible would he endless don’t you think?” His gaze bores into me, as if daring me to disagree. 

“I suppose so… so what exactly do you think he meant?” I ask. 

“I believe that sometimes we have to choose a lesser evil, to avoid a far worse outcome. God can forgive a single transgression, even if it’s indulgent and evil, as long as we genuinely strive to live a good life after that.” 

I’m torn, unsure how to respond. Part of me insists that doing something evil is never justifiable, even if it is just once. But on the other hand, I can’t help but acknowledge that none of us are perfect. We all have some darkness deep within us I suppose. 

By the glimmer in his eye, I get the feeling that he approves of me entertaining his ideas.
