I've had these dreams for as long as I can remember. They start normally, or at least what passes for normal in my world. I wake up in my bed, sunlight streaming through the window, the sounds of morning creeping into my consciousness. But then...something is off. A slight deviation, a feeling that the world around me isn’t quite right. 

It took me years to understand what was happening. I wasn’t just dreaming; I was waking up in alternate realities—universes that were almost identical to my own, but with subtle anomalies. The trick was to find the anomaly, correct it if I could, and then find a way to sleep again. If I didn’t, I’d spiral—caught in a cycle of waking up in new universes, each one more distorted than the last. 

At first, it was little things: a picture on the wall I didn’t recognize, a scar on my arm that I’d never had before, or my cat’s fur being the wrong color. Easy to notice, easy to ignore. But then it started getting more personal. It started becoming her. 

My mother.

She was always the anomaly. Sometimes, it was subtle—a different haircut, a strange look in her eyes, the way she’d call me by a nickname she never used. But other times...other times, it was horrifying. Her voice would sound wrong, guttural and too deep, or her eyes wouldn’t blink, staring at me as if she were trying to peer into my soul. 

In those dreams, I knew what I had to do. The only way to escape was to confront her, to make her reveal herself as the anomaly. Sometimes, it was a simple conversation. Other times...other times, it required more drastic measures.

But now...now I'm not so sure anymore. Because in one of those dreams, something changed.

I woke up, as usual, the world around me slightly off-kilter. But this time, my mother wasn’t the one acting strange. I was. I could feel it, deep inside me. The wrongness, the fracture in reality that I’d always attributed to the world around me—it was me.

I started testing it. Subtle things, like walking into a room and knowing what would happen next, or predicting the exact words my mother would say before she said them. It was like I’d become detached from time, slipping between moments and universes without even realizing it. And the worst part? She started noticing.

"Are you feeling okay, honey?" she'd ask, her eyes filled with concern. I’d nod, forcing a smile, but inside, I could feel it—the weight of the truth pressing down on me.

I was the anomaly.

For so long, I’d hunted down the inconsistencies in these twisted versions of my life, never questioning my role. But now, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was the one causing the distortions, that my very presence was warping reality around me.

Every time I woke up in a new universe, I saw it in her eyes. At first, it was just subtle: a lingering glance, a furrowed brow, like she was trying to figure out what was different about me. But as the days went on, the fear in her gaze became impossible to ignore. She didn’t say anything—how could she? She didn’t know. But I could see it: the suspicion, the unease. She was starting to doubt me.

She didn’t know that I was the anomaly. That I didn’t belong here, in this world, or any other. And I couldn’t tell her. How could I?

Because the scariest part? The part that keeps me up at night, even when I’m desperate for sleep, desperate for an escape from the endless spiral of realities? 

It’s that I don’t know if I’ve always been the anomaly. I don’t know if I was ever part of the original reality, or if I’ve been drifting through these universes for so long that I’ve lost my place, lost my mind.

I look at her sometimes, sitting at the kitchen table, her hands wrapped around a cup of coffee, her eyes tired but kind. She doesn’t know. She doesn’t know that the daughter she’s looking at might not be her daughter at all.

And I wonder, what happens when she finally realizes? When she looks at me and sees the truth? 

What will she do when she realizes that I’m not the one who’s supposed to be here—that I’m the one who doesn’t belong?

The worst part is...I don’t know what I’ll do either.

Because if she finds out, if she finally sees me for what I am...I might not be able to stop myself.

From what? I don't know. But the feeling gnaws at me, whispering in the quiet moments, making my skin crawl. I’m not the same person anymore, and maybe I never was. And if she finds out—if *I* find out—what will happen to us then?

I keep telling myself that I can pretend. That I can hold it together, keep going as if nothing has changed. But every day, it gets harder. Every day, I feel the cracks widening, the ground beneath me shifting.

And one day soon, I’m afraid I’ll wake up and look at her...and she’ll know. She’ll see the truth in my eyes, the way I see it in hers.

That I’m the anomaly. That I’m the one who doesn’t belong.

But until then, I keep pretending. I keep smiling, talking, living this life as if it’s my own. Even though I know, deep down, that it’s not. 

And that’s the scariest part of all.
