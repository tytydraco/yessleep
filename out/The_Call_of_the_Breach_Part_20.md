[\[Part 21\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1hxux37/the_call_of_the_breach_part_21/)

I dove to the cold steel of the catwalk beside Charlie, and not a second later, a wave of machine gun bullets tore through the building.

Broken shards of glass rained down around me from the windows, and sparks flew as high-speed lead projectiles ricochetted off the nearby metal beams. Three of our soldiers who didn’t crouch in time were hit and crumpled in a fit of agonized shrieks as their blood dripped down to the factory floor below. The entire structure trembled from a mortar impact on the rooftop, and bits of cement filled the air as the incoming rifle fire chewed away at the walls around us. If the fight for the depot had been rough, and the outpost in the square intense, this was a slaughter of brutal proportions, bullets and rockets sailing in from all angles. It seemed there was no end to the enemy fire, no pause for so much as a reload, and explosions rocked the ground beneath us to reverberated up the iron skeleton of the walkways in colossal shivers. Everything was swallowed in the titanic roar of battle, a fight so fierce that even the garbled cries from my headset barely made it to my eardrums.

*“There’s too many!”*

*“Ammo! We need more ammo on the right!”*

*“Back up! Back up, they’ve got thermite grenades! Get ba—”*

Charlie squeezed off a few shots out the window and ducked back down to shake his head at me. “We can’t hold em! We have to fall back! They’re going to swarm us!”

Daring to push my head up so I could peer over the concrete berm of the windowsill, I squinted against the kaleidoscope of muzzle flashes in the night. From what I could tell, both wings on our column to the north and south of us were being pushed back, retreating down the streets as the sheer number of enemy riflemen overwhelmed them. Three vehicles were burning, two ASV’s to the north, an armored truck in the south, but in our compound at the center the enemy charged the hardest. They were running right up to the concrete perimeter walls, to the sheet-steel gates, firing at us with every bullet they had, and boosting their fellows up so they could clamber over the ramparts. Most were shot before they could get over the top, but it didn’t stop them from trying, and more than one Organ trooper wearing an explosive vest had detonated themselves against the eastern gate. There were enemy soldiers everywhere, on all sides of our compound, and if we tried to withdraw now, they would simply catch us in the open.

*And then they’ll drive a big wedge right down to the square. Chris will be flanked, our headquarters will be overrun, and the field hospital captured. We can’t pull out, or Crow will march all the way to the southern city gates.*

Heart pounding in my chest, I threw myself to my feet and ran back and forth along the catwalk to push the others into various spots along the windows. “Hold the line, Fourth! Get up, return fire! Shoot for God’sa sake, or they’ll kill us all!”

More of our soldiers scrambled into position, and I ran down the catwalk stairs, out to the armored trucks at the back, which were already engaging the enemy trying to cross the street. I pounded my fist on the armored doors and ordered the drivers to various positions around the courtyard, so that the gunners could bring their mounted weapons to bear in the perimeter defense. The two ASV’s that were in the compound rolled to the eastern gate, where the heaviest enemy contact was, and began to fire point-blank with their 90mm cannon into the buildings across the road, collapsing them atop whatever machine gun or rocket crew had taken refuge inside. The one mortar team we had feverishly stacked bags of cement into a makeshift gun pit and went to work, loosing rounds into the surrounding charge of the enemy as fast as they could. As the Organs did to us, we threw all that we had at them . . . and yet, it still wasn’t enough.

“Building two, what’s your status?” I took a moment between running through the different gun positions to click my radio mic and glanced at the large production shop opposite ours across the parking lot.

*“Taking heavy fire, captain!”* The male voice of their leader came through, the platoon there one of our Ark River contingents. *“They managed to get a team over the wall, and there’s some in the ground level! We’re black on ammo, I say again, we are black on ammo!”*

The ever-dwindling stock of militia men who had joined the coalition during our days in New Wilderness had taught us the military way of clarifying our ammunition supply via colors. For my northernmost platoon on the compound to be ‘black’ on ammo meant they were down to the last rounds and needed more if they were to be expected to hold their position. Our trucks carried plenty of extra munitions in their armored compartments, but that meant going outside into the hailstorm of fire to get them. If the Organs had truly pushed so hard that they were inside our perimeter, on the northern shop’s ground floor no less, then getting more ammunition to our besieged troops would require near-suicidal determination.

“Ammos on its way.” I quipped back into the headset, and crouch-ran down the line, picking out a few riflemen with quick slaps on the backs of their green-painted helmets. “Hartman, Rogers, Clark, with me! Charlie, we’re going for ammo, get the machine gunners squared away!”

“Will do.” Sergeant McPhearson ducked an incoming volley and worked to reload his rifle while my chosen three and I hurried for the stairs.

Like stumbling children late for school, we took the steps down three at a time, air hissing as lead snapped around our boots. The ground floor was a similar chaotic mess, the dust hung thicker from numerous impacts on the cement, and enemy rifle rounds stirred up a cloud of grit that almost blinded me in the seething darkness. With the others in tow, I ran for the back door, dodging old machinery, and nearly slipped more than once on a slick of fresh blood.

*Kaboom.*

Right as I stepped outside, a concussive force blew me back through the doorway into my fellow ammunition runners, and ripped the metal door clean off its hinges.

We tumbled headlong over one another, and landed in a heap on the floor, the air filled with the acrid taste of burnt explosive.

My ears rang, both lungs hurt, and my limbs felt sluggish, as if they’d been dipped in some sort of numbing agent. For a moment, all I could pick up was the roaring of my own pulse in my temple and fumbled to roll upright on the shrapnel-covered concrete floor.

*Thump-thump.*

Coughing, I dragged myself upward in the flickering shadows, a fire burning somewhere outside near the gun trucks, and blinked to clear the dizziness from my skull.

*Thump-thump.*

My hands twinged in pain as I cut myself on a few shards of broken cement and groped for my submachine gun. The other three from my platoon lay around me, Hartman and Rogers moving slowly to rise as I did, Clark limp from where his head had been smashed open on an old lathe.

*Thump-thump.*

Through the haze of my clearing vision, I saw dark shapes flood into the courtyard out of a halo of orange flame. Crumpled bits of wall fell before them, the light of a burning truck glinting off their bayonets, dozens upon dozens of gray-shirted devils that screamed at the top of their lungs. They fanned out like locusts, and several turned towards the smoking remnants of my doorway.

*“Get up, Hannah.”*

A soft, baritone voice whispered in my ear, as though its owner stood right next to me in the murky darkness. The stranger’s silver irises flashed before my mind’s eye, and all at once, the fog in my brain cleared.

Three of the enemy charged in with rifles leveled, eyes red from either sleep deprivation or whatever substances the rag-tag soldiers of the Auxiliaries been given.

*Bang, bang.*

Hartman and Rogers tried to stand but were shot before they could. Their bodies jerked backward with the force of the rounds, and mists of red sprayed from their wounds.

My reflexes twitched, the ringing faded as my enhanced senses came back to life, and I snatched my Type 9 from the cold cement.

*Brat-tat-tat-tat-tat.*

In a shutter-stop horror show of flashes, the burst cut down two of the advancing Organs, and I rolled to one side just as the third’s bayonet grazed the concrete by my ribs, throwing sparks in the dim shadows.

Lunging onto the balls of my feet, I brought the Type 9 up and pulled the trigger once more.

*Clack.*

My blood went cold as the bolt slid home on an empty magazine, and the Organ soldier leveled his rifle at my chest.

*Click.*

His ash-covered face betrayed a similar level of dismay at his own empty weapon, but the boy thrust his bayonet at me without hesitation.

A half-twitch faster than his, my enhanced reflexes pulled me out of the path of the blade by a mere second, but the tip of the Organ’s bayonet caught my submachine gun by its leather sling. The gun was ripped out of my hands to clatter across the floor, and I barely had time to reach for my war belt before the next swing came my way.

The enemy soldier closed on me, his blade slicing and stabbing the air a hair’s breadth from my contorting body.

My fingers closed around the first handle I could find on my belt, and I yanked my knife free.

*It’s about speed, not force.*

Jamie’s words came back to me from the few days of training I’d had with her at New Wilderness after I first arrived, when she introduced me to sparring. I’d been rather bad at it, worse at boxing than knife-fighting, but she hadn’t given up on me. When I complained that I was too skinny to win a real fight, Jamie insisted I work on the speed of my strikes until I could weave circles around someone. I had never gotten as good as her, but in this moment, I’d run out of options.

*Here goes nothing.*

The bayonet sailed toward my throat, and I ducked to lunge closer.

With a flick of my wrist, I brought my blade up and jammed it between the trooper’s ribs.

He screamed, doubling over as I stepped past him, and I ripped the blade free.

Raising it high, I grabbed the back straps of his chest rig and brought the knife down as hard as I could.

*Crunch.*

I both felt and heard the blade drive itself between the vertebrae of his neck, the bone shearing, sinew snapping. Hot red blood spattered across the knuckle-duster hilt of my knife, and over the fingers of my right hand in a sticky spray. The shock of the blow reverberated up my arm and made a sick knot twist in my gut.

The enemy soldier fell to the floor in a crumpled heap, limp as a sack of potatoes.

Out of breath, I darted for my gun and snatched it up to hide in the shadows as I clawed for a fresh magazine. My brain shot panicked commands for me to run before another Organ could come in through the doorway, but I had nowhere else to go. The enemy poured into the shop like water from all directions, through broken windows, smashed in doors, and over the hasty barricades erected by our troops. Our soldiers fought back amidst the dusty machinery and pallets of abandoned industrial supplies, but the fighting was close and cruel. Shots were fired at point-blank range, some of our rangers using whatever melee weapons they might have, others tackling their opponent to the floor with their bare hands. Teeth ripped at faces, fingers gouged at eyes, and the interior filled with the smoky roar of unimaginable violence.

My fingers trembled with fear and adrenaline on the cold steel of another magazine, and I forced myself to breath deep as my heart tried to leap from my chest.

*Calm down Hannah, you’ve got this. Reload, and keep moving. You can’t stay in one spot.*

The magazine slid home into the receiver of my Type 9, and I found my second wind to jump to my feet, racing back into the darkness of the factory.

Through the haze, I found a cluster of my platoon mates huddled behind a plastic molding press, and baseball-slid into place with them. Back-to-back with the others, I went through half my magazines in a matter of minutes, spraying a wall of lead to keep the constant wave of enemy soldiers at bay. The other production shop didn’t matter anymore; there was no way I could reach them, nor the ammunition in our trucks which roared as they circled the yard like a wild-west rodeo. From between the gaps in the shop walls, I could see the courtyard was nothing short of chaos, the drivers keeping their charges on the move to avoid being blown up by the enemy suicide bombers. Whatever troops of ours were on foot tried to find cover anywhere they could, as every single building in the industrial park came under attack. Our mortar crew were too busy defending their lonely gun pit in the center of the compound to launch more bombs, and the gunners of the ASV’s worked overtime to shred the Organs that surged for the perimeter wall.

“Brun!” Charlie yelled from the upper catwalks, his voice barely perceptible in the speakers of my headset as the concussive roar of battle carried on.

“Here!” I shouted at the top of my silt-filled lungs, even as my group fought to push the Organs out of the factory ground floor. Somehow, we’d absorbed their first attack, but the next was mere seconds away, their war cries audible just outside the concrete barrier wall as they headed for the various gaps they’d opened with satchel charges. “I’m here! We never made it outside, there’s too many!”

“We need ammo!” Sergeant Mcphearson belted down to me. “Machine guns are almost dry! I’ve got half a belt left.”

*There’s no way I pull that off.*

Another rifle bullet snapped off the machine next to my head, and I pushed the last magazine I had into my Type 9. “I’m on it!”

Turning to the door, I tried to gauge the distance between it and where I sat, my heart beating a million miles a minute. I had no idea how I would reach a truck, much less how I would make it back with all the fire outside. Still, what choice did I have? Either I went for ammunition now, and got shot, or I stayed until we all ran out in a few minutes and wait to be shot.

*How can sixteen feet look so far . . .*

“Let me go.” A hand closed on my arm, and I whirled on reflex.

Lucille crouched beside me, a smoking M4 in her hands, her sister’s rifle slung across her back. Her face was pale in the light of the multiple surrounding fires, but she gave me a small nod as if we were just out on a walk somewhere and had met up by chance.

“What the hell are you doing here?” Stunned, I dragged her back into the cover of a nearby milling machine.

“My job.” With an annoyed glare, Lucille jerked her uniform collar out of my grasp and pointed toward the ceiling. “Are the belts for the 240’s still in truck three?”

Unable to pull my scattered thoughts together, her sudden appearance enough to muddle my brain, I nodded. “Should be more for the Browning heavies too. But they’re driving around the compound somewhere, you can’t just—”

“Be right back.” Lucille slipped past me, and my heart skipped a terrified beat as she dove out into the hellish night through a battered window.

*For God’s sake, Campbell, you’re a lunatic.*

“Covering fire!” Following her to the ledge, I propped my weapon up on the brickwork to send a stream of lead into the onrushing hordes of the enemy.

Lined up against the chipped cement, we fought to the last cartridge, making every shot count. The Organs kept coming, the parking lot carpeted with their bodies and took the room to our left in the building, firing around the corners as they urged the others forward. Engines roared outside as our ASV’s and other armored pickups moved in to help us, but enemy rocket launchers from across the street from us kept them from pulling too close. A heavy machine gun started to cut through our walls like butter, mounted somewhere in the rooftops off to our eastern flank, and I gritted my teeth as the hefty anti-material rounds chewed through the factory around me.

“Come on, come on.” I muttered under my breath, peering into the murky firelit night with terrified hope.

Boots thudded on the asphalt, and a red-haired figure appeared from behind a nearby pallet to throw herself over the low-rise windowsill alongside us. She collapsed in a clatter of metal, rolling head over heels in a clumsy somersault amongst rivers of shiny linked brass.

Half delirious with relief, I knelt with two other runners to claw the machine-gun belts from Lucille’s shoulders, more of our group scuttling over to cart off the two green ammunition can’s she’d managed to bring. “Hey, you okay? Talk to me, Lucille. You hit?”

Yanking her uniform coat off, Lucille turned it upside down to shake more loaded rifle magazines out onto the floor, which the other soldiers around us snatched up like candy at a parade. “I’m good, but building two’s in bad shape. They’re tried to run across the lot to us, but a machine gun pinned them down. I don’t think they’re going to make it much longer.”

*Sounds like we need that mortar back up and running.*

“McPhearson’s on the upper floor.” I waved the barrel of my submachine gun at the catwalk stairs, which were halfway between us and the nearest enemy cluster in the opposite room of the shop. “Once we get him the ammo, we go for the others. Stay on me, I’ll get you through.”

Taking some of the belts from her to share the weight, I turned to the others. “Okay, we’re heading up! Lay some cover for us!”

They fired back at the Organs with renewed fury now that there was something to put through their weapons, while Lucille and I sprinted for the stairs. Each step felt like a bad dream, the weight slowing me down, the stairs vibrating as scores of bullets hit them from both sides. Our forces on the ground floor worked to push the last Organs from the opposite room even as their bullets sailed around my ears, and the fractured building shuddered under the barrage of more enemy RPG’s. I coughed on the atomized cement in the air, tripped on my bootlaces that snagged on the steps, and nearly fell headlong over a section of broken railing that would have sent me tumbling to the concrete far below. Lucille ran along behind me in breathless pace, and somehow, we made it to the top.

“Friendly! Friendlies coming in!” Legs burning from the exertion, I crouch-ran to where Charlie hunched behind one of the old Browning .50 caliber machine guns we’d been handed down by the militia men.

Our ‘heavies’ as the twinkling-eyed boys manning the guns had nicknamed them, were bulky, long-barreled weapons designed in 1919 but still in wide use by various forces around the US. Just to carry them required three to four men, the guns broken down into tripod, receiver, and barrel. Each fired the enormous .50 BMG round, a cartridge as long as my hand, and powerful enough to punch through cement block, wood, and even some lightly armored vehicles. Most of the .50’s our coalition had were captured from ELSAR, who had purchased them newly made, and were mounted on our vehicles. With the best guns reserved for our trucks and ASV’s, the old ones from our militia stockpile were dispensed as additional support to the platoons so each had one .50 to use for dismounted operations. Despite the design itself being older than my grandfather, the Brownings were perfect for punching through walls of nearby buildings, and set atop their sturdy tripods, they could be devastating as a defensive tool. Charlie had been smart to get 4^(th) Platoon’s .50 up here, and it seemed to be the sole reason why our building had yet to be completely overrun, as the hefty machine gun cut through the enemy soldiers like butter.

Skidding to a halt beside the thundering .50, I thrust the gleaming ammunition belts at the gunners and continued on down the line pf 240’s until I had nothing left to give. “Load em up! Make it count, we don’t have much left. Who needs ammo?”

We passed the ammunition out to the other gunners, and Charlie conferred with me behind a square metal cabinet bolted to the platform, the three of us lying in the prone as the factory disintegrated all around us.

“We need some HE from the big guns!” He huddled low under the steel of his helmet and winced as a bullet sparked off the cabinet just over his head. “If we can torch the buildings across the street, it’ll force them back. Where’s our armor?”

I lifted my head to peer out the windows on the courtyard side of the platform, and spotted the vehicles far across the plaza, engaged in a bitter firefight with enemies to their south and north. However, my heart fell as I saw our own panicked troops scattering from their various positions along the concrete wall, many running toward my building for shelter. The Organs had taken building two and lacerated the courtyard with heavy fire. Our mortar pit was a sea of flame and smoke, having taken a grenade directly in the center, and two of our pickups were alight. A spring of gray-uniformed shadows blossomed in the center of the lot, and I spotted manhole covers flung to one side, which sent ice through my blood.

*That’s why we didn’t run into them until just now; they’ve been hiding underground, in the sewers. Just like what the resistance used to do to them. Crow had this all planned out from the start.*

Gut churning at the sound of my men screaming as they died in the parking lot below, I shut my eyes in dread and rested my forehead against the cold steel catwalk. The Organs had overrun us, and would be in my building once again at any moment. If they broke through, the entire western flank would collapse. At this point, I had only one option left.

 “No help’s coming.” I crawled back to Charlie, and met tried my best not to shake with fear. “We can’t get out . . . and we can’t let them get past us. What’s our grid location, sergeant?”

From the way Charlie’s expression faltered at my question, I knew that he knew what I meant.

“Should be three-five-niner.” Charlie hugged the catwalk as another enemy mortar shook the building from top to bottom. “But we can’t stay here for that, this place is going to come down any minute! There’s no way it takes the overpressure!”

“We don’t have a choice!” I jerked the small square map holder from my belt, and scanned the grid in a panic, wishing I’d practiced this more in my free time.

The canvas bag holding the launch panel dug into my side, and I gripped the heat shield of my Type 9 a little tighter in dismay. If all else failed, I would have to use one of my few grenades on the panel, to be sure it couldn’t fall into enemy hands. That meant throwing away our ability to use the nukes . . . and possibly costing us the war.

*Crow can’t win. Of anyone, she can’t be allowed to take charge. I have to stop them, no matter what it takes.*

Clicking my radio mic, I swallowed the morose foreboding that had risen in my throat, while Lucille and Charlie joined the firing line to hold the enemy back. “Clear the air, clear the air! Any Eagle units, this is Sparrow One Actual, we need immediate fire mission on the industrial park in grid square three-five-niner-six-four-niner, enemy infantry in the open, fire for effect, how copy, over?”

*“Solid copy, Sparrow One Actual, interrogative, how close are you to the target?”*

“They’re right on top of us!” I tensed as somewhere downstairs, another grenade went off, and more screams filled the air as the Organs moved in. “Just hit us with everything you’ve got! Danger close!”

*“Confirmed, danger close on grid square three-five-niner-six-four-niner. Six guns in effect, HE, impact fuse, rolling barrage. One minute to impact. It’s been an honor, captain.”*

On my stomach to avoid the dense cloud of bullets, I wormed my way toward the firing line. As I did so, another rocket screamed in to impact several yards left of me, sending the machine gun crew there tumbling to the floor.

Looking up through the fog of burned chemical dust, I saw they were dead, eyes wide with lifeless shock, their limbs twisted and broken with spatters of red blood on white bone. Amidst the debris, the old Browning sat propped in its tripod, the long barrel wafting little tendrils of steam. A fresh green ammunition box lay on its side close to the empty machine gun, and at the sight of it, a strange determination smoothed over my growing panic.

Hand over hand, I crawled to the ammo can and pulled myself upright behind the bulky weapon.

*Okay, think, what did Jamie say? Lock in the belt, pull the charging handle twice, slap the top cover, something like that. Calm down Hannah, there’s no point in fumbling; they’re going to kill you either way, might as well do this last thing right.*

Something about that, the certainty of knowing I was going to die, helped steel my nerves. True, I was scared, more terrified than I’d ever been, but at the same time, I refused to run. Chris was depending on me, the others had fought so hard on my orders, and countless innocent lives were at stake. Whether by bullet or bayonet, my death would be swift, and that wasn’t so bad, really. I’d seen pain before, in ELSAR’s lab, and after that how bad could a bullet to the head be? Either way this was our final stand, and as long as one of us remained, the enemy *would not* pass.

With the new ammo belt locked I place, I gripped the rear handles, squinted down the iron sights and pressed both thumbs to the butterfly-wings style trigger.

*Wham-wham-wham-wham.*

Unlike my diminutive Type 9, this gun didn’t bang or clatter; it *roared*, and I had to hold it on targe as the Browning spit hundreds of anti-material rounds toward the oncoming Organs. The gun chopped down the enemy in like cornstalks, punching three or four rows deep. My building had become the last bastion of the industrial park, and from here the remnants of my central column fought back with all we had left, firing in all directions. The enemy slithered through the other buildings, the central parking lot, the outer walls, and still more charged from the streets outside, but they didn’t triumph here.

Here, they were met with fire.

Looking over my shoulder back into the perimeter, I saw bands of our retreating soldiers shot, bayonetted, or blown up by waves of enemy hand grenades as they tried to cross the parking lot to us. Many were Ark River warriors, who often stayed behind to buy their comrades a few extra moments, so the youngest of our New Wilderness stock might retreat first. Organs engaged them at close range, blades flashing in the night as Adam’s kin resorted to their famous swords and bows when the ammunition ran dry. Few made it to our gutted part of the factory.

*Clunk.*

Its belt expended, the heavy bolt of my .50 ran home on nothing.

Desperate, I cast around for another green ammunition can, only to see a few scattered piles of spent casings that hadn’t fallen through the catwalk grating to the floor below.

*Boom, boom, boom.*

My body went rigid, and I instinctively glanced up toward the ceiling as the first shells hurtled in from the south.

“Incoming!” I threw myself to the frigid steel, and the others on the catwalk did as well.

*Ka-boom.*

Geysers of dirt, broken pavement, and ash went skyward outside, and as the explosions rolled across the urban landscape, the Organ infantry disappeared into the inferno. Across the lot, the factory buildings were hit, their rooftops buckling under the assault and flames burst forth as they caught fire. Horrifying shrieks came from the men outside our walls, their bodies torn apart by shrapnel, some bursting into flame. Underneath us the ground shook like a washing machine, the surrounding houses went under, the streets turned to dust, and some of our vehicles exploded as they were caught in the rain of steel. Building two went down in a groaning of broken cement, and everyone not under a roof was blown to pieces. Bits of the dead, both the enemy and our own, flew through the air, and the sky lit up orange from the intense heat of the flames engulfing our entire block.

*Ka-boom.*

Hands clasped to my neck in vain attempt to protect my spine, I screamed at the top of my lungs, and curled into a ball as the entire ceiling gave way with a great crashing of steel.

*Ka-boom.*

Our soldiers cried out in despair, Lucille reached for my hand, and I tried to do the same.

*Ka-boom.*

Dense gray ash filled the air, and the ground fell out from under me.

For a brief half-second, I thought of Chris, of his smile, his laugh, the way it felt to have his strong arms around me. I thought of Lucille’s face as she’d reached for my hand in those last moments, of the panel strapped to my side, of the strange necklace from Vecitorak’s book still tucked in the breast pocket of my uniform. I thought of Jamie, somewhere out there, cold and alone in the wilderness. My whole life had been there, right there . . . and I would never see it again.

*Chris . . . I’m so sorry.*

Steel screeched, concrete crunched, and everything tumbled down into smothering blackness.
