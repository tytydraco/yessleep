 There was one time, in the first house that i can remember living in i had frequent frights. One night, i awoke at who knows what time with one of them at the end of my bed. They were either really short, like 3 or 4 feet, or was on their knees. Pure white body, pure white clothes, pure white, spiky hair, and pitch black, empty eye sockets. It had no eyes yet i still felt that it was staring deep into my soul, it didn't do anything except just stay there, lifeless. I slowly covered myself with my blanket, trying to block the empty stare. I think i fell asleep again, and in the morning there was no trace of it or anything that i had seen, i didn't tell anyone.

I was at peace for years, however just only a few years ago, in a flat/apartment that we lived in whilst i was still in primary school i had more encounters. I was woken up in the night numerous times, however these times i couldn't see whatever it is.

After the first occasion i had lost something, my imagination. I cannot hear my thoughts, cannot dream or sleep well. Something was stolen. 

Back to the apartment, on one of the nights i was awoken with the sound of piano playing from very far above. However, i lived on the 10th floor of an apartment building with only 11 floors, and large instruments such as pianos were not allowed. So how was i hearing piano playing that sounded like it was beyond the roof. I only heard it once, it was calming and nice, but, i can't recall how it sounded - all i do know is that i can remember it happening. Other times i couldn't move, like i was restrained to my bed, however i was only restrained when i had my eyes open, looking for whatever it was. But the instance that i closed my eyes, stopped searching, i was free and could move. I opened my eyes again and my legs went numb. Again, I stopped looking for it and got up out of bed to enjoy my school-free weekend. 

Ever since then i haven't had any of these encounters since then, it has been at least 3 or 4 years since i've had an event, but strange things have still been popping up, notes and reminders appear on my phone on things that you can't predict, they will sit their for months having me dread them, and then days before the set date something in my life happens that causes the reminder to come true - such as emergency doctor appointments. And thats not all, i often see humanoid shadows from the corners of my eyes. Whats even worse is that, I still haven't regained the ability to dream, sleep peacefully, hear my thoughts, and its gotten worse - my short term memory has been getting worse and worse, showing no sign of improving and things that used to fill me with joy feel empty now. It's almost like i'm slowly being turned into an empty shell.

Although, I do not fear them, what i fear is the thought that they might go after and haunt others. It's not that my life is in danger (at least i don't think so) but that the paranoia that they cause is terrifying. Good luck to anyone who ends up running into them.
