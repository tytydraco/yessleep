 For the last 15 years I’ve been doing secret executions for the United States government.  I’ve executed, as of this post, 87 people.  The most recent one was 4 and a half weeks ago, and I expect to perform another one any day now. 

Now before anyone gets the wrong idea, this isn’t some sort of admission that validates any sort of stupid Right Wing Deep State shadow government fantasy.  I’m not executing American citizens in some sort of targeted hits for political or social reasons, lest not for any political or social reasons we don’t already execute people for.

Let’s get the obvious question out of the way.  Who have I executed?  Well, criminals.  Convicted criminals on death row.  Everyone I have executed was convicted, in a normal trial within our normal legal system, and given the death penalty by a jury of their peers.  They are as guilty, no more and no less, than the people who are executed that you know about.

I’m not alone.  There’s, best as I can figure, about a hundred of us scattered across the country.  Outside of times when one of us takes on a new trainee for a brief period we work alone. 

We don’t know each other well, we don’t get together in any official capacity as part of our normal routines, but we aren’t like forbidden from talking or anything like that, and sometimes we have to meet up for sporadic training or seminars from the higher ups, and we keep in loose touch online, sharing information and tips and stuff like that.

We all get a territory to cover.  I’m in a fairly urban area so my territory is small but busy.  I cover about 10 various correctional institutions, all within about a 3-hour drive from my home.  I’ve been called to both state and Federal prisons.  Some of the guys, like out in the Midwest, have larger but less busy areas.  I think a few of the guys even cover a whole state or at least close to it.  There’s one guy, he covers Alaska.  He says he has to take a small plane to a lot of his jobs, but he only does four to five jobs a year, max. Someone covers Puerto Rico as well.  I think there’s people assigned to the other territories; Guam, American Samoa, all that.  I doubt whoever it is gets a lot of assignments though.  The Native Reservations have their own people as well.  

And no before you ask, none of us had anything to do with Epstein or Vince Foster or any other stupid online conspiracy theory.  Or at least none of us will admit it.  Again, we do official, if not legal, executions.  We aren’t assassins.  We don’t do “hits.”

So how does my job work?  Well, every few weeks or so two things happen to let me know I have a new execution to perform.  First, I get a notification on my work phone, a regular off the shelf Android phone.  The notification is just a long, complicated alphanumeric code, probably randomly generated.  At about the same time, most often on the same day but never more than a day before or after, I get a package via Registered Mail through the United States Postal Service, delivered by my regular mail carrier on his normal route, usually alongside my other everyday mail.  The box is always the same, about twice the size of a shoebox, a standard, generic brown mailing box, always with a return address of a specific P.O. Box in Omaha, Nebraska.

Inside that box is another box.  This interior box is wrapped in a heavy metallic wrapping, I’m assuming to stop X-raying or anything like that.  If the weather is very hot or cold there is sometimes a cold or hot pack, again I’m assuming to keep the contents from getting too hot or too cold.  The alphanumeric code I get on my phone is printed on this interior box.

If at any point up to this anything is wrong, the package doesn’t come from that specific P.O. Box, if it is damaged or leaking, if the code on the inner box doesn’t match what I got on my phone, or anything else feels weird or off, I’m under strict orders to proceed no further and contact my superiors for additional instructions.  So far that hasn’t happened, whoever sets this up knows what they are doing.

The interior box contains a single printed sheet of paper.  It will have the full name, the full social security number, a clear photograph, almost always a mug shot, of a specific prisoner, along with the name and address of the correctional institute they are being held at, and a point of contact within the correctional institute, usually the Warden or equivalent.  Always someone high up, not just a random guard or something like that.

The other thing that comes in the box is what we call the Toolkit.  It’s a plastic box.  Inside are three sealed compartments.  The first is the prep kit.  The prep kit has a few pairs of latex gloves, a standard disposable medical face mask, a disposable Bic razor, a few alcohol wipes, and a small transdermal patch, like a nicotine patch.  I’ll tell you what the patch does in a minute.  

The next, and by far the biggest, compartment contains the actual method of execution, 4 large, prefilled syringes containing something which is like, but not exactly the same, as the classic Lethal Injection cocktail.  

The last compartment is the follow up compartment.  It has another pair of gloves and a folded up medical waste bag and a small sharps container.  All of this is just basically to pack up and safely dispose of everything when I’m done.

My procedure is simple, and rarely deviates.  I get the box and the code, verify everything is good.  The next day I drive out to the specified correctional institute, after normal working hours, usually late in the evening.  I present myself to the security check in or reception or whatever the specific place has and tell them I am here to meet the point of contact specified on my informational sheet.  Every time, literally every time, I’m told that so and so is expecting me.  A lot of the time my point of contact is already there to meet me.  Never have I gotten any pushback or been prevented entry.  I’ve never been asked to show ID or paperwork.  I think the prisons get instructions too, so they know I’m coming and for what.

I’m then taken to my, for lack of a better term, target.  The person selected for execution is always alone.  A room in the infirmary is by far the most popular choice.  Sometimes it’s an office of some kind.  Only twice have I ever performed the execution in the prisoner’s cell.

The person is already asleep when I get there.  The person is always asleep.  That’s important for reasons I’ll tell you later.  Usually, the prison has already done the prep work of making sure they are in a deep sleep, usually medically induced.  At the very least they are deep into normal REM sleep before I start. 

I get to work.  My point of contact always stays with me, but they aren’t involved, they just stand back and make sure I’m not interfered with.  First, I put on the patch from the kit.  The chest is the best place to put it, but I’ve got backup locations if for some reason I can’t put it on their chest, the upper arm, the small of the back, the inner thigh.  The Bic razor in the kit is if I need to shave any body hair.  I place the patch firmly on their skin and wait a few minutes, working quietly so as not to wake them.  

After the patch is firmly on, I bring up an App on my work phone.  It connects to the patch via Bluetooth.  The patch serves two functions, both as a bio monitor and as a delivery device for a powerful sedative.  I don’t know the exact method it uses but within 60 seconds or so the person is basically under, as deep as if they were under anesthesia.  The App gives me a notification when I’m allowed to proceed.  I was told that proceeding before getting permission would have grave consequences for me.  I don’t feel like testing that, so I always wait.  

Then I actually perform the execution.  The syringes are numbered, it’s pretty dummy proof.   You inject one.  Wait for the App to tell you to make the next injection, usually no more than two minutes, sometimes as quick as 20 seconds.  Inject the next one. Repeat.

The first one is the only thing I’m 100% sure what is in it.  It’s just regular medical saline, used to flush out and open the veins so the next 3 syringes work at peak efficiency.  The second syringe is some kind of advanced paralytic.  The third stops their heart.  The fourth is a neurotoxin of some kind.  Apparently, anyone of the last 3 syringes is enough to kill them several times over.  But we like redundancy.  This procedure isn’t too dissimilar to how regular lethal injections work, but our drugs are different and apparently highly classified, even from us.

The App records all the target’s vital signs and reports when death is confirmed.  I use my work phone to take a clear picture of the body and a close up of the face.  The App then uploads the information, to where exactly I don’t know.

I stuff everything; the printout with the information about my job, the empty syringes, the patch, the Bic razor, anything else, into the medical waste bag.  My point of contact then walks me back out.  I’m never searched or challenged.  I drive back home.  I put the medical waste bag into the same box the original kit came in, they even include a return postage label, and I mail it back.  I use my work phone to take a picture of the box and the return label.  The App then finalizes my job, asks me to enter into the notes if I need to report any anomalies which I never have, then after a final upload of information the phone reboots and any record of that job is gone.

Within a few days my payment is automatically deposited into my account.  From the timing I think I get paid when all the used equipment gets returned to wherever it came from, and someone makes a final review of the information that phone sends up.

Of course, I’m curious.  Usually if I check the news I’ll see a news report about my target dying in prison of a generic malady; strokes and heart attacks and unspecified “natural causes” are the most common.  

And that’s it until I get another job, where the whole process starts over.  

I’m left alone between jobs.  I have to tell my superiors if I’m traveling out of the area for longer than 48 hours and I have to give them 6 months' notice if I’m leaving the country, but nothing beyond that.  I get paid well and have all the standard government job benefits.

Once a year or so we all get a package containing plane tickets to somewhere in the Continental US.  Last year was a big hotel/convention center in Phoenix.  We get updated procedure info, we do a sit-down talk with our immediate supervisors and get feedback on how we are doing, get to meet the other operatives, welcome new people into the organization.  The two years before that we did it virtually because of COVID.   

I got recruited right out of Med School.  Or rather right after I flunked out of Med School and, as part of just applying to anywhere looking for a new career path, had applied to be a federal LEO, specifically the National Park Police.  From talking to the other guys “Some medical training with an interest in law enforcement” is the common thread in all of us.  Not sure why that is, the procedure certainly doesn’t need either official medical training or law enforcement experience.  

So, I’m sure you're asking yourself, who exactly is carrying out these executions and for what reason.

Well to answer the 1st question, the United States government.  Specifically, a special unit within the Department of Justice.  At least that is where all the roads I can track anywhere seem to stop.  And someone is opening all the metaphorical doors and rolling out the welcome mat at the prisons for me.

The why is a little harder to explain.  We execute these people for the same reason we execute anyone, to punish them for a crime.  They are all people who have committed crimes we publicly execute people for.  

From what I can piece together a few decades back the Supreme Court made a secret ruling on the Death Penalty.  They declared that the Death Penalty wasn’t cruel and unusual but waiting on being executed with no idea if your death was days, weeks, or years away was.  So, a solution as proposed.  Condemned criminals would just go to bed one night, having zero idea that night was any different from any other… and never wake up.  

That’s the key part in all this.  The people I’m executing?  They had no idea that when they closed their eyes to go to bed that night they would never wake up.  They weren’t counting the days until their last appeal ran out.  They didn’t have to come to terms with it.   They go peacefully and, relatively, worry free in their sleep.  They don’t have to feel themselves being strapped into the electric chair and feel the lethal injection needles go in or anything like that.

Is that better?  You could argue either way.  I think it is.  

Why do we still execute some people the other way, in public after appeals when they know it is coming?  I don’t know.  Maybe they are special and deserve a different way to die.  Maybe it’s for show to maintain plausible deniability about what me and my coworkers do, I honestly don’t know.

It’s ironic my phone buzzed as I was finishing typing this up.  I expect a package any day now.

I wonder where this one will take me?
