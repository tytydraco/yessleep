The Doorway Effect is that commonplace daily phenomenon of walking through a doorway and forgetting whatever you were thinking moments earlier.

On a neurological level, the explanation for this effect is that our minds compartmentalise thoughts, so passing over a threshold from one room to another can, from time to time, expunge one’s short-term memory.

Ever meandered around a room, not remembering why you originally entered it?

That’ll have been the Doorway Effect.

It’s a psychological quirk. Faulty wiring in the brain. A dotty, divvy, screwy, loopy moment. A neural refresh that happens upon updating one’s physical location to somewhere new. And that sudden scatterbrained forgetfulness tends to make people chuckle.

Is that always the case, though?

You see, I’ve been experiencing this effect a lot lately, and always with the same door. Whenever I stroll from the kitchen to the main hallway, my mind entirely erases. I forget whatever I’ve just been thinking.

Forget whatever I’ve just experienced in that room.

That’s frightening enough in itself, but something far worse happened after my last bout of short-term memory loss. Something that terrified me into fleeing my home.

“Shall we play a board game, then?” I asked my friend, Dale, as I returned to the living room, head feeling cloudy.

He raised an eyebrow and smiled. “Sure, but what about that cupcake, Mae? I hate to sound rude.”

“Cupcake?” I replied.

He nodded. “Yeah, you and Jem were bragging about them. Your birthday cupcakes? Are you pretending to forget so you don’t have to share them, Miss Greedy?”

I blushed a little—*not again*, I thought. *Why do I keep forgetting what happens in there?*

“Right, I, er… Yeah, sorry, I got distracted,” I stammered, knowing full well what had happened.

For the past month, I haven’t remembered a thing that has happened in my kitchen. I’ll come out with a plate of dinner in my hands, so I know I’ve been in there, but I didn’t have the foggiest clue what else had happened in there.

I do now.

“Is she still in there?” asked Dale, then he called out, “Hey, Jem, fetch me a cupcake! What’s taking her so long?”

I gulped and twisted my head to face the doorway to the kitchen. From that angle in the lounge, I could see only a sliver of the room—counters along the two perpendicular walls, meeting in the corner. Light spilt from the garden into that little cranny, but it failed to ricochet from the surfaces it bumped; it was as if a darkness were hanging heavily over the space.

“*JEM!*” Dale called again, before chuckling. “Is she deaf?”

I shrugged, hovering on my feet between the sofas and the doorway to the kitchen—that doorway which, until a few weeks earlier, had been just that: a threshold between rooms. Suddenly, I embraced the horror that I had been desperately trying to suppress.

It was a threshold to something else.

Something I was forgetting.

“Mae…” Dale began uncertainly. “Is Jem even in there? I saw the two of you walk through there only two minutes ago… Am I losing my mind?”

I opened my lips to speak, but nothing came out; that, along with my face likely turning ever-whiter, must’ve pushed Dale from curious to anxious.

“What’s wrong, Mae?” he asked, rising from the settee. “Why are you being so weird…? JEM!”

My friend continued to call out for her as he brushed past me.

“Please don’t go in there,” I pleaded with a croak, but Dale ignored me and entered the kitchen.

His shoes scuffed and brushed lightly against the tiles of the room, then slid to a sudden stop.

And he screamed.

It was the briefest sound of horror, extinguishing only a half moment after the halt of his footsteps.

The sun pouring through the window seemed to be wrestling even more futilely with the dark of the kitchen, which pushed its rays backwards—pushed them up from the counters and the floor, back towards the glass pane, leaving the room lightless.

Leaving me standing before nothing but a black doorway.

I blubbered, “Dale…? Jem…?”

There came no response from the unfathomably cold space, but the darkness started to lift a few seconds later—as if the room had simply been cleansing itself. Wiping away something. Washing its secrets out to sea with a tidal shade.

As I took tentative steps forwards, I took my phone out of my pocket; I had to record it. Had to know whatever was happening in there.

And as I stepped through that doorway, I found myself being spat back out into the lounge—memory having been wiped, leaving me unaware of whatever I’d just experienced.

But I knew it had been something terrible, as I felt agony from the waist done; I looked below and saw red marks running up my bare calves and thighs towards the bottom of my skirt. I’d suffered first-degree burns.

Hands trembling, I took out my phone and loaded the video I’d recorded whilst in the room. It was only twenty seconds long.

There was no video footage. Both the image and the audio were distorted; something had interfered with my phone.

But I saw it.

An opening in the wall—a black hole, leading to a cramped pit of mud and rocks that looked far from earthly.

And emerging from the shadows were two disembodied sets of hands, clawing into the dirt—desperately trying to drag themselves free.

I heard the garbled sounds of my two friends pleading meekly for help.

Heard distorted, robotic breathing.

Heard the low-quality sound of my own scream as those two sets of hands were dragged back into the shadows, ploughing lines in the dirt with their nails.

And then came two burning, murky oranges in the black—two dots, neatly aside one another.

*Eyes.*

I dropped my phone in terror, and spun to face the doorway to the kitchen.

Heavy panting came from within. It was that unmistakeable breathing from the video. No longer distorted. No longer a recording—a fiction tucked neatly behind a phone screen. No longer a forgotten memory. It was coming from the room before me.

And I wasn’t forgetting.

Then came the crunching, thudding sounds of something landing against the kitchen floor—something so weighty that it was cracking the tiles.

In terror, I screeched and fled.

That was 12 hours ago, and I ran straight to my parents’ house. I don’t have a plan.

I won’t tell them why I’ve run from home.

Won’t tell them why I’ve asked to keep the kitchen door [closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
