So...this is all new to me and I’m not entirely sure how this is supposed to help. To be honest I don’t really understand the point of it all but Dr. Aacker seems to think that it’ll be a good first step before doing a full sleep study. I can’t really remember the last time I’ve slept through the night so at this point I’m willing to try anything. 

I haven’t really been talking about the dreams I’ve been having and to be honest this is the first time I’ve had the chance to actually listen to them back. Maybe that would help. Some people think there’s meaning in dreams. Maybe if I can find that meaning it’ll put a stop to them. So I guess..let’s give it a go. Last night was another weird one, if you can call it that…

The dream starts in the car and I’m with Leah and I know the atmosphere so well at this point that I know it’s the aftermath of another fucking argument. It was like that a lot at the end and maybe it’s something I got used to. The awkward silences. The air heavy with disdain. It wasn’t always like that and I don’t exactly know how it got to that point. I know I wasn’t perfect and I should have been better. The late nights, the drinking, the parties. At the start, it was all part of a beautiful chaos that made up the relationship, but it was never built to last, not like that anyway. 

She had her dreams and wanted to start her career, while I was, and still am, drifting through life. Maybe that’s why she started appearing, is it guilt? Is it regret? I know I feel all of those emotions but at some point you have to move on. I also haven’t been thinking of her recently, or have I and I just don’t even know. Sorry I’m rambling but I guess this is the point of these entries, to record my thoughts and make sense later. 

So in the dream we’re driving along this long winding  road and it seems like it’s just never ending, it’s bend after bend and I honestly have no idea where we’re going. It’s nowhere I recognise, just road. The one thing I do know is that I just have this absolute feeling of dread. The atmosphere in that car, it’s like it was crushing me. At one point, I turn to Leah and I ask her where we’re going. She doesn’t even look at me, she just keeps driving. The road keeps going and the car gets faster and faster. 

Eventually she slams on the brakes, I nearly go flying through the window. The car has completely stopped and she still won’t look at me. I look outside and I can see that we’ve stopped outside this house. It’s an old house with at least two floors and I would hardly say its run down but looking at it you can tell it’s old you know and already I have a bad feeling about this house. 

I turn around and I ask Leah one more time what she’s doing and where we are. She finally answers me and she tells me “You have to go in there, I can’t do this for you. It has to be you.” So I ask her what she means and for the first time she turns round to face me. She looks at me, dead in the eyes, and she slaps me across the face. 

At this point I’m thinking…did that actually just fucking happen? We had arguments and sometimes they got crazy. Things were bad at the end but never, ever in a million years did it ever get physical between us. So at this moment, I’m in absolute shock and honestly I think that in that moment, I could have burst into tears. I get out of the car and without a second’s hesitation she speeds off down that long winding road. 

I turn around and I walk up the drive way to the house. I don’t recognise it but there’s this weird sense of familiarity around it. I go to the front door and in my hands there’s keys. I open the door and I go inside. So the first thing to mention is that I’ve lived in Glasgow my entire life. I have never moved and have only ever lived in two homes, with my parents when I was a kid and where I am now. But when I’m in this house, I don’t recognise any single aspect of it, but I know it’s my house. 

I look down the hallway…and this man appears from one of the rooms. He’s an older man, short white hair and beard. He doesn’t even look particularly unusual, just a normal, older man. The most distinctive quality about him is his clothes. He’s wearing this kind of grey fedora with a duster coat. Looking at his face, I remember thinking that he had a kind of Robin WIlliams look to him. Weird I know, but that’s the only way I can possibly describe him. What I do know is that I am absolutely terrified of this man and I have to get away from him. 

I look at his face and the only way I can describe the expression on his face is that he’s euphoric. It’s not one of those horror movie smiles. I mean it genuinely looks like this man could cry from happiness. And the absolute terror that makes me feel, I can’t even describe. I turn around and I try to open the door but I can’t and I’m trying frantically to get away from this man. 

I look behind me and I can see that he’s getting closer with that euphoric smile on his face. I know he wants something from me and I know it’s wrong. That’s the best way I can describe the situation, the whole thing is so so wrong. I eventually opened the door and that’s when I woke up. That dread I felt though, it’s still with me and I’m waiting for that security you feel when you wake up from a bad dream and you know you’re safe in reality. But it doesn’t come. 

The thing is, this isn’t the first time I’ve seen the man. At first, it was like he was a background character, almost like an NPC in a video game. Someone that you take note of but don’t pay much attention to. Lately though, he’s started to show up more frequently and more prominently. This is the first time that he’s tried to interact with me directly…and it scares me. 

I dunno if all of this is just psychological but I can’t help but feel there’s something more. Dr. Aacker has given me these pills to take every night before bed. She says it should put a stop to the dreams. It’s a new treatment, still considered experimental but there’s been some positive results early on apparently. At this point, I’m willing to try anything just to get a good night’s sleep. I’ve to keep this log going for eight days. Dr. Aacker has also asked that I keep the recording beside me while I sleep. I'll check in tomorrow with an update...

**UPDATE**

Okay, so this is really weird. I've listened back to the recording from last night while I slept and I'm officially freaked out. The dreaming is one thing, but talking in my sleep is definitely new. I don't even recognise what I'm saying but from what I can make out it sounds like ''Mah Sahra Occusta Riejo''. 

I don't know maybe it's a one off, a bad reaction to the medication? I'm going to give it another night or so. If it keeps happening though I might need to check in with Dr. Aacker.
