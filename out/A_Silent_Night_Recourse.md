I sat in the relative darkness as I waited for whatever waited out there, the sounds of the night were silent and all I could hear were the soft ticking of the clock. Nothing moved and neither did I as sat on the chair, the cold was getting to me as I left the fire to die in the fireplace, that was the only light and heat source, but I could do without it right now. The soft and heavy thumps returned but they were more urgent now and I could feel the tremors under my feet, or it could be my heart beating faster. The shadow returned to the front window and the figure moved closer to see inside, my finger tightened on the trigger as I waited. Time froze as I waited for the face to show up again and I was ready to fight, no one or thing is going to scare me inside my home and if they do then there will be blood to pay.

The figure did not move and neither did I, but I could sense the tension as whatever the hell that thing was slowly move back and vanish into the night, the light outside my barn shone brightly and soon I could see the sky lighten. I remained where I was until I could see everything in light. I did not care about my joints cracking as I got up, but I made sure my shotgun was ready to fire in case the bastard decided to test it’s luck. I walked to the window and looked outside to see if could spot an ambush, nothing, then walked to the kitchen to look at my backyard and see if it was in the tree line still blank. Satisfied a little but still not letting my trigger go I opened my front door expecting a rush but there was nothing. The birds were chirping and squawking as their usual rituals, but I did not care. I walked out so have a better look at the trail around my house to see if there was a trail, being early winter the ground was solid and so no footprints nor any sign I could use as a trail.

I looked up and around the trees surrounding my home and could see nothing, it was as if nothing happened last night and there was no shadow visitor. I took a few more rounds and then mustered up some courage and walked over to the barn to see inside, I heft the shotgun and slowly opened the front door. I let the daylight flood in and looked around, inside was a mix of tools and abandoned projects I accumulated over the years and knew there was very little space for something large to hide in. I opened the second door to let me light in and saw nothing had moved since yesterday, looking up for any surprises I saw the usual few bats who rooster up in the rafters looking back at me, it seemed they knew also and decided to stay out of the conversation.

Taking a few more steps into the barn I poked about the place and was satisfied nothing had entered so I turned and left. Closing the doors behind me I made sure this time to push the lock bar into place and take another look at the perimeter to calm my nerves. As I stepped back in to my home the phone rang, I closed and locked the door and walked to the phone and picked up. The sheriff was on the line, “Mason, you there?”

I replied I was and he sounded relieved when I replied. “Listen Mason, we made it back to the station ok, the girl woke up an hour after and went berserk, had the doc up her dosage to get her back to sleep, took over 2 hours but finally she seemed to calm down and talk. Look I know you can handle whatever is out there but honestly, I would rather babysit you than must pick pieces of you.”

I assured him that whatever the fuck the thing was had left and I was going to make sure I keep out of sight for a couple of days till the thing moves on. As I thanked him a large bang was heard coming from the barn, I jumped and the sheriff must have heard and he screamed at me to leave immediately. I looked towards the barn and could see the doors were broken out, not in, so the thing was hiding inside the barn but where?

I picked my shotgun and began walking to the window and that is when I heard the loud roar of something, I began to shake at the sound of it. I stopped as I heard it and waited to see what happened next but there was nothing, the silence returned, I was alone. I could heard the sheriff call my name on the phone but I was fixated at the front window. I could not see anything so I slowly began to move forward hoping the floor did not creak. As I neared the window I scanned the scene in front of me, the barn doors looked like a truck smashed through them and wood pieces lay all round like shrapnel from a grenade and all that was missing was smoke from the explosion. I began looking for the source of all this carnage and could not see it, my shotgun nozzle followed my eyes and I tried to find the fucker.

Then I heard the soft but heavy thumps, they were coming from my left it was standing next to me front door all this time. There was a low grumble I heard and I took a few slow steps back, I was sweating and I really wanted to run but instinct told me that would be a loosing move. I waited and last night’s shadow walked into frame, my blood froze as I beheld a dark form of monster. Dark and matted fur cover a man like figure and the head was above my window, so it stooped to look in, that face I saw last night came into view. I was snarling like I just stole its lunch, my face tightened and I brought up my shotgun and waited for it to move first. It saw the shotgun aimed at it and its eyes froze on that, from what I could see it recognised what I was pointing at it and its eyes looked up at me. I wanted to fire so badly but knew by the time I cocked it again to fire I would be in pieces, so I waited for the first move. The expression changed to annoyance and it huffed then rose it’s head and stood for a moment and made it seemed like it was about to move on, my I began to lower my shotgun and it was then a its left hand burst through the window and by instinct my shotgun raised and I fired. I hit the hand and part of its chest, the pain may have jarred it for a moment as it backed away and  I took that as an opportunity to cock the shotgun to take another shot and it moved forward and I fired.

The second round hit it square on the chest and it flew back, falling on the ground. I cocked again and moved backwards, it roared and tried to get up. I moved to the kitchen to see if I could get out the back as staying the house would leave me at a disadvantage with something like this. My truck was in the back and knew that the only chance I had against this thing was to run, my nerves were frayed and I need to run. I burst through the back door as I heard the front of house being blown in by the thing. I ran to the truck and I could hear the thing smashing its way to the back of the house. I got to the truck and jumped in; the keys were where I left them yesterday. (Yesterday, it feels like a lifetime ago when everything was just a normal same shit different day thing.) I turned the key and the engine roared to life and I gunned the truck forward, I did not care where but I needed to run. The thing broke through the back door and  I saw the thing in its full height it stood more than 7 feet tall, like hairy thing in the science fiction movie my wife loved, it took 2 shots from my shotgun and looked like it could take a few more without blinking, I stared at it and  I drove past the bastard, it began to run for the truck and I gunned my truck forward. It was fast and I was freaking out. I needed to run.
