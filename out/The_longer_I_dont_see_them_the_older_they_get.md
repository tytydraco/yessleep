My mother was older when I came back with the cake knife. Not tired—*older*. In the four minutes I spent fighting the sticky drawer, two extra birthdays showed up on her face. A white streak at her temple. New softness under her eyes.

“Where’d you go?” she asked, like I’d been gone a week.

That was the first time I noticed it: in my family, absence writes faster than time—but only **my** absence. If I’m looking at you, you age normally. If I’m not, you jump ahead. The longer I’m gone, the steeper it gets: a day away can be a week; a week can be a year. Photos don’t help. Video calls don’t help. It has to be light bouncing off your face and into my eyes. No one else’s gaze counts. Only mine.

You can imagine what that does to a life.

I made rounds. I put magnets on the fridge: **Mom—7am**, **Dad—noon**, **Abby—5pm**. I learned to “deposit” time—sit with someone for an hour and buy them a safer evening. Fights are withdrawals. If I look at you with contempt, the years move faster. So I practiced looking kindly even when I wasn’t.

People tried to help. Neighbors sat with my mother. Friends took my dad to lunch. It didn’t matter. They came home looking normal. The second I turned my back, time tested the seam again.

My sister, Abby, didn’t believe me until finals. She lived at the library three days. When I unlocked her door, she stepped into the hall with a thin white streak in her hair you could twist with two fingers. “Don’t freak out,” she said, voice huskier. I didn’t. I added magnets.

We learned stupid, tender hacks. I’d wave through windows if I had to run outside. I’d read to my mom while she showered so she wasn’t “unseen” behind a door. I ate in doorways. The house became a lighthouse and I learned the turn of the beam.

There were mistakes.

When my aunt stopped talking to us after a fight, I told myself the rule didn’t apply because I wasn’t *trying* to avoid her. It did. Two months later we let ourselves into her place with the lockbox key. She hadn’t died; it’s not that story. She just… *skipped*. The TV was on birdsong videos. Her voice said my mother’s name like a question from someone twice as tired. I visit her every other day now. Soup helps nothing except people, which turns out to be enough.

When my cousin had a baby, I stared until my eyes watered. I went to the porch to take a call. I was gone nine minutes. When I came back, the newborn had a fan of crow’s-feet that only shows when he scrunches his nose. He’s perfect. He’ll carry those nine minutes all his life. I am learning to live with that.

Sometimes the worst part is people needing dark. My father did it on a Tuesday. “I’ll just nap,” he said, and closed his eyes. I went to the garage for a hinge tool. When I came back he wasn’t asleep; he was *refusing*. A little older. A soft click behind his eyes, like a lock you can’t pick. “We’re here,” I said. He opened his eyes and let time behave again. Much later, he told me he didn’t want my life to be nothing but rounds.

“How else should I live?” I asked. “A lighthouse is a good life.”

We laughed. We ate soup. I reset the magnets.

I keep a card above the table now:

* **Look on purpose.** Deposits count more if I mean them.
* **No long doors.** If you close one, I sit on the mat and read.
* **Return, even embarrassed.** Absence is a slow saw.
* **Make the look a good one.** Anger still counts; kindness buys more.

Last week, Abby took a two-day beach trip with her husband. I hit every slot at home. Mom dozed. The battery clock ticked in a forgivable way. I slept in the chair by her door—feet flat, so I could stand fast. The house smelled like detergent. The minutes behaved.

When Abby texted **coffee?**, I met her at the corner cafe. She looked rung out and sun-soft. For a second I saw a double exposure—Abby at seventy: salt-white at the temple, a groove where worry dries—and then the present settled back over her like a fitted sheet.

“What?” she laughed. “Do I have sand on me?”

“I saw you,” I said, and stopped.

She touched my wrist. “I saw you, too. Old for a second. Yellow sweater you don’t own yet.”

So we sat there stupidly and drank our coffee slowly and *looked*, the way you look at a painting you’ll forget as soon as you go outside. When I got home, I stood in the doorway and watched my mother sleeping on the couch. Her mouth hung open. The soft snore of someone who trusts you filled the room like a small engine that never stalls.

People ask for the cause, as if a clean noun would make it livable. There isn’t one. There’s only practice. Cross the street. Wave through glass. Touch the frame when you leave. Come back even when you’re ashamed to. If you’re me: stop trying to be a hero and just *be there*. If you’re not me: you can’t help, except with soup. Bring soup anyway.

My dream ends the same every time: I’m on the porch counting windows, waiting for Abby, and I see her at every age as she walks up the path—fist like a plum; knees scabbed; teenager with a secret; woman with our parents’ key; old woman in the yellow sweater. It isn’t sad. It’s a litany. The beam turns, writes its clean line on the water, leaves, and comes back.

Before bed I add one more line to the card:

* **If you love them, look.** And when you have to look away, promise you’ll turn back.
