The job opening wasn’t on LinkedIn, nor was it on any job board. It was handwritten in blue ballpoint pen on the back of a tax receipt pinned to the bulletin board of a 24-hour laundromat in downtown São Paulo.

"NIGHT WATCHMAN - PRIVATE SECTOR. $18,000.00/month + Bonuses. Requirements: No family, military or security background, strong stomach. Discreet. Contact the number below via Telegram only."

Eighteen thousand dollars.

I read the number three times. At the time, I was living in a boarding house room that smelled of mold and old cooking oil. My bank account had been in the red for so long the manager didn’t even call me anymore. I’m an ex-military police officer, expelled from the force for "excessive use of force" and "incompatible conduct" (official code for alcoholism).

I had nothing to lose. I sent the message.

The reply came in thirty seconds. A GPS coordinate and a time: 03:00 AM.

The location was the underground garage of an abandoned commercial building in the Sé district. I was frisked by two men built like wardrobes wearing cheap suits. They took my phone, my wallet, my watch. They put a black hood over my head and shoved me into the back of a van.

They drove for four hours. From the swaying and the smell of earth coming through the vents, we left the city and hit a dirt road. Then, we went down. We went down a lot. I felt the pressure in my ears change, like when a plane lands.

When the hood was removed, I was in a white, sterile room lit by fluorescent bulbs.

Sitting at a metal table was Dr. Arantes. A thin man with gray skin and dark circles under his eyes so deep they looked like bruises. He didn’t smile. He didn’t greet me. He just pushed a stack of papers toward me.

“Level 5 Non-Disclosure Agreement,” he said, his voice dry as sand. “If you tell anyone what you see here, you don’t go to jail. You disappear. Your dental records vanish. Your birth certificate is erased. You never existed. Understood?”

“What is the job?” I asked, holding the pen. “Politician security? Organ trafficking?”

“Theological Containment Monitoring.”

I laughed. I thought it was a joke.

Arantes didn’t laugh.

“The salary is deposited into an offshore account in the Cayman Islands. You work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. You sleep here. You eat here. Your life outside is over. Sign or leave.”

I signed. My hand shook a little, not from fear, but from alcohol withdrawal.

Arantes gathered the papers and stood up.

“Welcome to Project Cathedral. Let’s go down.”

We entered an industrial freight elevator. The panel had no numbers, just an up button and a down button. We descended for too long. Two minutes? Three?

“We are three hundred meters below the foundation of an 18th-century church,” Arantes explained, staring at the elevator ceiling. “The church above is a façade. What matters is what’s below.”

When the doors opened, the air was freezing. We walked down a concrete corridor lined with steel doors fitted with biometric locks. We reached the end of the hall. A control room.

It was small, claustrophobic, filled with high-resolution monitors, panels with blinking lights, and an industrial coffee maker. But the focus of the room was the window. A pane of reinforced glass, ten centimeters thick, looking into a gray concrete cell.

“That is your post,” Arantes pointed to the worn leather chair in front of the glass. “Sit.”

I obeyed. I looked through the glass.

The cell was a perfect concrete cube, maybe 4x4 meters. No furniture. No bed. No toilet. In the center, on a Persian rug that must have once been red but was now dark brown, a man was kneeling.

He was facing away from me. He wore a black cassock, torn and dirty. His hair was white, thin, falling over his gaunt shoulders. He was rocking his body slightly, back and forth.

“Who is he?” I asked.

“We call him Father Thomas. He is 94 years old. He has been in that room for forty-two years.”

“A prisoner?”

“Working. Just like you.”

Arantes flipped a switch on the panel. Sound invaded the control room.

It wasn’t silence. It was a low, constant hum, like a swarm of bees inside a cave.

“...Khlerrr-thum-nagh... Sssrr-aaa-tuh... Mmm-glll-w'nah...”

“Is he praying?” I asked, feeling a chill run up my spine. That language didn’t sound human. The consonants were too hard, too guttural.

“He is vocalizing,” Arantes corrected. “It’s a sonic blockade. A specific frequency. As long as he maintains this rhythm, the Door stays closed.”

“What door?”

Arantes ignored the question and pointed to the panel in front of me. There were three large buttons, protected by acrylic covers. Blue, Yellow, and Red.

“Pay attention, Jonas. These are your only responsibilities. The priest does not eat, does not drink water by mouth, does not sleep. He receives nutrition and stimulants intravenously. He wears high-absorption geriatric diapers that we change with robots every 24 hours. Your function is to ensure he does not stop. Ever.”

Arantes pointed to the Blue Button.

“Hydration and mild stimulant. If his voice falters, if he coughs, press Blue.”

Then he pointed to the Yellow Button.

“Shock of adrenaline and pure amphetamine. If he stops rocking. If his head droops. If it looks like he’s going to pass out. Press Yellow. It will hurt him a little. His heart will race to 200 beats per minute. But it will keep him awake.”

“And the Red one?” I asked. The button was larger than the others, with a black and yellow striped warning border.

Arantes looked at the cell. For the first time, I saw fear in that man’s eyes.

“If he dies. If the sound stops for more than ten seconds. If you see... things coming out of the floor. Press Red.”

“What does it do?”

“Total incineration. The cell is flooded with flammable corrosives. Everything inside turns to ash in three seconds.”

“So, that button basically kills him?”

“If we reach that point, Jonas, the priest doesn’t matter anymore. The Red is to seal the room. To ensure nothing comes out.”

Arantes put a hand on my shoulder.

“The shift is 12 hours. Do not sleep. The system monitors your eyes. If you close them for more than five seconds, the chair shocks you. Good luck.”

The first few months were a slow descent into madness. Boredom is the worst kind of torture. You sit there, staring at a dying old man, listening to that sound.

“...Khlerrr-thum-nagh...”

It isn’t a Christian prayer. I was raised in the church. I know Latin. That was older than Latin. It sounded like the language stones would speak if they had mouths.

I started studying Father Thomas. With the camera zoom, I saw details the glass hid. The skin on his knees didn’t exist anymore. The fabric of the cassock, the flesh, and the rug had fused into a mash of dried blood and pus. He was calcified to the floor. That old man couldn’t stand up even if he wanted to.

His hands, clasped in prayer, had nails grown long and curved, piercing the flesh of his own palms.

But the worst was the face. Every now and then, he would turn his head to the side in a spasm. He had no eyes. The sockets were empty, scarred holes. Someone—or he himself—had gouged them out years ago. And the mouth... the lips were open sores from so much friction.

In the fourth week, I found a "Journal" on the control room computer. It was a text file hidden in a system folder. Previous monitors left notes.

Monitor Silva (2015): "He spoke to me today. Not the prayer. He whispered my name. The audio was off, but I read his lips. How does he know my name?"

Monitor Kowalski (2019): "The shadows in the cell are wrong. The light comes from above, but the priest’s shadow points to the left. And sometimes, the shadow moves when he is still."

Monitor Helena (2023): "I dreamed of what is below. It is an ocean. But not of water. Of teeth. Thomas isn’t praying to God. He is singing to put the baby to sleep."

Helena lasted three months. The log said "Termination for medical reasons (psychotic break)."

I started doubting my own sanity. The sound of the prayer entered my dreams. I would wake up in my quarters (a concrete room on the same floor) whispering just like the priest. My throat hurt, as if I had been screaming all night.

In the sixth month, the routine was broken.

It was 02:00 AM. I was fighting sleep, drinking cold coffee.

Father Thomas stopped.

The silence in the room was like a gunshot. The audio monitor showed the flatline of silence. I jumped in my chair, hand hovering over the Blue Button.

But before I could press it, he spoke. In Portuguese. With a clear, young voice that shouldn’t have come out of that destroyed throat.

“Jonas.”

I froze. He was facing away, but I knew he was "looking" at me with those empty sockets.

“Press the Yellow, Jonas,” the voice said. “I need strength. He is waking up.”

I didn’t think. I pressed the Yellow Button.

I heard the hiss of the automatic injector in the cell. The priest’s body convulsed violently. His back arched at an impossible angle. I heard bones crack. He screamed—a dry, airless scream—and went back to praying.

But now, the rhythm was frantic. Too fast.

“KhlerrrthumnaghSsrrraaatuuhhMmmglllwnah...”

He sounded like a demonic rapper. The frequency rose. The reinforced glass in front of me began to vibrate.

The red phone on my desk rang. I didn’t even know that phone worked. I answered.

“What did you do?” It was Arantes’ voice. He sounded like he was just waking up.

“He asked for it! He stopped! I followed protocol!”

“The seismic activity level just spiked! You injected too much adrenaline! His heart won’t take it!”

I looked at the vital signs monitor. Heart rate: 210 bpm. Blood pressure: 240/150. The priest was going to explode.

“He is rising!” the priest shouted, breaking the prayer again.

This time, he turned. He rotated his torso 180 degrees. His spine snapped, breaking, but he turned. The eyeless face stared at me. He smiled. Black blood ran from his mouth.

“The door, Jonas. The door is creaking.”

And then, the floor of the cell gave way. It wasn’t a hole. The concrete simply became... liquid. The rug where the priest was kneeling sank. I saw Father Thomas’s body being swallowed by the earth. He didn’t scream. He kept praying as he sank into the gray slime bubbling on the floor.

The prayer became muffled, gurgling, until it vanished completely.

The heart monitor beeped. Flatline.

The sound stopped.

“Arantes!” I screamed into the phone. “He’s gone! The floor swallowed him!”

“The Red!” Arantes shouted. “PRESS THE DAMN RED BUTTON NOW!”

I lifted the acrylic cover. I punched the button. I closed my eyes, waiting for the flash of flammable chemicals, the heat, the explosion that would incinerate everything on the other side of the glass.

But... nothing happened.

The button didn’t work.

I opened my eyes. The cell wasn’t on fire. The cell was glowing.

A sickly violet light emanated from the hole in the floor where the priest had sunk. The temperature in my control room began to rise. 30 degrees. 40 degrees. The plastic on the monitors started to melt. The phone in my hand melted, burning my palm. I dropped it.

And then, the Thing began to emerge.

First, it was the fingers. Long, translucent claws, made of something that looked like smoking glass and TV static. They gripped the edge of the hole in the concrete. The size... my God. Each finger was the size of a grown human.

Then, the head. It had no face. A polygon of flesh and light that constantly changed shape. Looking at it made my eyes bleed. I felt hot, red tears running down my face.

The central computer in the room came to life. A text message appeared on the main screen, giant green letters on a black background.

CONTAINMENT SYSTEM FAILED.

OMEGA PROTOCOL INITIATED.

MANDATORY REPLACEMENT.

The doors to my control room locked. Titanium bars slammed down over the exit. A mechanical needle descended from the ceiling, right above my chair. I tried to get up, but the chair had magnetic locks on the wrists and ankles. They snapped shut with a metallic click.

I was trapped.

“No! No! Let me out!” I screamed.

The needle descended and pierced my neck. I felt a cold liquid invade my veins. It wasn’t poison.

It was clarity.

Suddenly, the fear vanished. The pain vanished. My mind expanded.

I understood.

I understood what Father Thomas was doing. He wasn’t praying to a God. He wasn’t asking for salvation. He was telling a story.

The Entity... Whatever that thing coming out of the hole was... is made of chaos. It is pure entropy. It wants to undo the universe, atom by atom. The only thing keeping it trapped is Order. And the purest form of Order is Repetition. Rhythm. The Word.

The "prayer" wasn’t magic. It was mathematics. A sequence of frequencies creating a physical barrier against chaos. A wall of solid sound.

But Thomas had stopped. The wall had fallen. Someone needed to raise the wall again.

The Thing in the cell was rising. It already occupied half the space. The concrete walls were cracking, turning to dust. If it touched the ceiling, if it touched the foundation of the church above... the world would end. Not in fire, but in silence. Everything would cease to exist.

I felt the words rising in my throat. I didn’t know them. But they were in the serum the needle injected. Liquid memory. The knowledge of all the monitors, of all the "priests" before Thomas.

My mouth opened against my will. My tongue twisted into a painful knot. The sound came out ragged, weak.

The Thing in the cell stopped. The spinning geometry hesitated. It "looked" at me through the glass.

I felt a crushing pressure on my brain, like an ocean trying to fit into a water glass.

“SHUT UP, WORM,” the Thing’s voice echoed in my mind. It was pure murderous intent.

But I couldn’t shut up. The drug in my blood wouldn’t let me. The biological imperative was now: Pray or die.

“Khlerrr-thum-nagh...” I spoke louder.

The Thing recoiled an inch. The black slime on the floor bubbled. It hated the sound. The sound was Order. The sound was a cage.

The Thing let out a screech that blew out the remaining monitors in the room. Glass flew everywhere, cutting my face. But I didn’t stop.

The rhythm took me.

My body began to rock, back and forth, mimicking Thomas’s movement. It was the only way to pump the diaphragm to keep my breath.

The Thing began to shrink. The violet light dimmed. It was being pushed back into the hole by the weight of my words. It fought. Claws scratched the reinforced glass, leaving deep gouges right in front of my face.

But I kept going.

It sank. Slowly, inch by inch, the nightmare returned to the earth. The concrete floor, which had been liquid, began to solidify again, sealing the hole.

In ten minutes, the cell was empty. Only the dirty rug and Thomas’s bloodstains remained.

I sat there, panting, trapped in the chair. I waited for the doors to open. I waited for Arantes to come get me out, congratulate me, give me my money.

But the doors didn’t open.

The needle in my neck injected another dose. Nutrients. Water. Stimulants.

The intercom clicked on.

“Excellent work, Jonas,” Arantes voice said. “The transition was smoother than we expected. Thomas took three days to find the rhythm the first time.”

“Get me out of here!” I tried to scream, but the words didn’t come out. My throat was locked in "prayer" mode. I could only make the guttural sounds.

“You cannot leave,” Arantes continued, calm. “The frequency must be maintained within line of sight. The glass is the focusing lens. You are the new projector. The audio system was destroyed, Jonas. Now, it is just your voice. Direct into the room’s acoustics.”

The lights in the control room went out. Only a dim light remained on, illuminating the empty cell on the other side of the glass.

And a new button lit up on the panel in front of me. A button that injected water into my mouth through a tube that came out of the headrest.

“The contract was for life, Jonas. You should have read the fine print. 'Monitoring and Containment'. You are the Containment now.”

That was... I don’t know how long ago. There is no clock here.

My knees hurt, even though I’m sitting. I feel like they are trying to fuse to the chair. My eyes burn. I don’t blink anymore. And my voice... my voice isn’t mine anymore. It is a constant hum, an organic machine built to keep the demon sleeping.

Sometimes, when exhaustion hits and I slow the rhythm, I see it. The floor of the cell starts to sweat that black slime. And I hear its voice, from down below, laughing at me.

“Sing, little bird. Sing until your throat tears. I have all the time in the world. And you only have one life.”

My name was Jonas. Now, I am just the sound.

God help us.

Never stop praying.
