Organ harvesting isn’t a glamourous job. It pays well, but you can’t afford to be slow or sloppy. If you are, the best case scenario is that you miss a pay check, the worst, you get caught. And if you get caught, no one is coming to help you.

I’ve been doing it for a few years now, so I’ve got my strategy down. I’m fairly frail looking so all I have to do is fake a limp and people don’t think twice about ‘helping’ me. It’s laughably easy to lure bleeding hearts to a secluded area so I can slit their throats and open them up.

The target I had staked out that day was mousy stick of a man. He obviously spent more time at the computer than at the gym. He didn’t seem like the type to carry, but I was always careful to look a person over for signs of a concealed carry.

He stuttered when I approached him, practically shaking like a new born deer, but he was happy to help. He didn’t even bother to try to keep me in his glasses bound sights.

It made it all the easier to strike him down.

I want to say that I knew something was wrong, that even the tiniest bit a dread creeped down my spine, but I had no idea how bad of an idea it was to choose this guy.

I did my usual harvesting routine, packing the now free organs in a stashed cooler.

I space out my harvests and cycle locations to err on the side of caution, so I was miles away from where I killed him when I saw him again.

I have a pretty good poker face, but it almost shattered when I spotted him no worse for wear, humming to himself while talking a walk.

It was impossible. He couldn’t have survived; much less be in the condition to walk around. It had to be some weird look alike!

Still, I hated loose ends.

He acted just like last time, though he seemed to pick up on my distress. “A-are you o-okay?”

“I’m okay, just a bit stressed... Hey, random question but do you have a twin?”

He blinked owlishly at that. “No... I-I'm an only child.”

Even with how suspicious I must have been acting, killing him was just as easy as last time. Panting, I watched him spasm and choke as he hemorrhaged from the cut on his throat before he stilled.

Maybe it was just my nerves, but the following silence felt deafening. Instinct told me to run but I needed to at least harvest one organ today.

I nudged him with my foot, half expecting him to jolt up and bite at my throat like a zombie from a horror movie.

Nothing.

Still my heart would not slow.

I took more from him than I did last time but my cuts were much shakier.

I rested an extra few days after that and I was still shaken when I went out again.

Of course, he was there again. 

Instinct screamed at me to leave, to abandon what felt like a sinking ship, but I feared what would happen if I didn’t kill him more than if I did.

My composure was better, but I still felt I was drawing more attention than was healthy for my career.

Again, there wasn’t a slightest bit of difference in how he acted.

I killed him again. One slice and he was down.

The world spun. How many times would I have to keep doing this?

In a daze, I turned around and began to walk away.

“I think you’re missing a couple of steps.”

That voice, smooth and barely recognizable, froze me solid.

I couldn’t breathe as I looked back.

He stared back at me, a completely neutral expression on his face, unbothered by the gouge in his throat.

But that neutrality quickly faded into thinly veiled irk. “I let you rip out my guts two times, the least you can give me is a decent reaction.”

In an adjacent situation, that would have been moment guys with cameras would burst out of the woodwork and yell “*you just got pranked bro*!” but no one jumped out of the shadows. It was just me and what should have been a corpse.

I finally managed to choke out a pathetic “*how*?”

He snorted. “You haven’t been *remotely* entertaining enough for me to *entertain* answering that.”

I took a step back. “What?”

“Looks like you haven’t been harvesting enough brains.” He shifted so he was laying on his side, throat still open and oozing. “Why else wouldn’t I have struck you down the second I found you slicing a woman’s throat? You’re entertainment. Though lousy in that front.”

Ice cold terror and red-hot fiery rage battled in my bloodstream, the urge to run away fighting the urge to stomp his brains in.

“You’re lucky, really, to have run into me and not someone else. My moral backbone is quite bendable, especially when I’m bored. But,” He tapped his fingers on the bloody concrete, “You really weren’t worth keeping alive.”

“I’ll kill you!” I said reflexively, trying to repress my shaking.

He raised an eyebrow. “And how do you plan on doing that?”

My mouth opened but I couldn’t squeeze anything out.

“That’s what I thought.” He rose to his feet like he was wire-flying in a play, completely unnatural. “Now, I believe it’s time to discuss repayment.”

“What?”

If this had been some sort of game or film, his eyes would have glowed, but instead those dark orbs seemed to swallow light like a black hole. “For every organ you stole, of course. Every inch of skin flayed, every drop of blood spilled.”

“I can give you money!” I sputtered. “A lot of money! All the money!”

He blinked slow and sure, like a lazy predator who knew its prey could not escape. “Does it look like I have any interest in money?”

That’s when I finally succumbed to the instinct to run. I darted out of the alleyway.

At least that’s what should have happened, but as if I made a full circle, when I rounded the corner I was back in the alley with him staring blankly at me.

He clicked his tongue. “It’s far too late to back out now, especially since you’ve accumulated so much debt.”

I had to get out of here, out of this *thing*’s clutches. I looked down at my knife.

“*Like I said*.” He was suddenly way too close, a hand trapping the wrist of my knife hand. “It’s far *too late* to back out.”

My fist shattered on impact with his impossibly hard chin. He didn’t even flinch as I screamed in agony.

“Oh my, throwing a tantrum? The only person to blame is yourself.”

I continued to struggle against his grip, but I could not even make him so much as wiggle.

“How sad. And how *annoying*\-”

I suddenly couldn’t move, like the air around me had become stone.

His eyes in which nothing escaped bore into mine. “Let’s tally up your debt, shall we? Two hearts, two livers, four lungs, four kidneys, one stomach, thirty-six broken ribs, one-hundred ninety-one square inches of flayed skin and muscle, and 13 liters of split blood.” He tsked. “That’s quite a lot. And that is not including severed nerves.”

I choked, trying to say something, anything.

“Even if we broke it down to a matter of simply cells, you don’t have enough in your body currently to repay me. *So,*” He drew out that syllable. “If I were to harvest a pint of blood every 12 weeks, you would have 7 years before your final payment is required.”

“Now,” his bored expression broke into a sinister grin. “Let’s make the first payment, shall we?”

His free hand crept up to the forearm he held captive. I renewed my efforts to escape as he dragged a nail across my skin, though I still couldn’t move not matter how hard I tried.

His finger stilled on a vein and I felt a sharp sting, like a needle had grown out his fingertip.

After what felt like forever, he removed his finger, revealing an oozing wound.

“There. That wasn’t so bad, was it?” His grip, both physical and supernatural, released me. 

I scrambled back, but what distance I gained didn’t feel remotely enough.

“Whelp.” He made a show of dusting off his bloody clothes. “I’ll be seeing you. Oh, and try to cut your life short and you’ll regret it.”

With that, he turned and walked out of the alley, whistling an unfamiliar tune like he didn’t have a care in the world.
