I’m retired. My kids don’t talk to me, and my wife is dead. I have a small house up in the mountains. It’s what I always wanted, though. Well, I used to imagine it with my wife, but I guess you can’t have it all. It hasn’t been bad since she passed. I have a garden. I have time to paint and read. There is endless hiking and exploring, and I get to feel like I’m free.

Things have always been quiet out there. I mean, it’s the woods, so I never hear cars drive by my house. Planes rarely fly overhead. People don’t talk, and I live alone. Bird’s don’t even sing very often. Nothing. In the winter when snow pads the ground, I can hear my own heart beating. I can hear my stomach churning. But you get used to all of that. You stop noticing it. I’ve always been the very quiet and softly spoken type anyway. There’s so many other things to focus on, and I’ve never been the observant type.

I think that’s why it took me so long to notice that things had gotten, well, especially silent. I think they did, at least. It’s hard to tell. Up until recently it was quiet enough most of the time, but when I made coffee you would hear the pot. If I slammed my door a little too loud, I would notice. I don’t know when those noises faded away. It’s not like you really ever think about stuff like the door shutting when you live alone. 

I keep a little bit of company around: my cat Lucy. She noticed things were a little off sooner than I did. She tried to warn me, actually, about the unusual quiet, I think. I’m old, you know. I guess my senses have changed. I sleep more now. I’m lucky she’s around, even if it didn’t do much, when the worst of that uneasy-crawling silence pounced

You know how they say the woods go quiet when something bad is about to happen? Or maybe it’s any set of surroundings-not just the woods-getting totally spooky and empty. I can tell you that it’s true now, but at least for me it’s not like the way you usually hear it. It’s not this abrupt thing that suddenly stuns you, driving you off back into the unsuspecting comfort of noise. No. It’s slow and gradual. It disguises itself with the mundaneness of your surroundings. By the time you realize it’s there, it’s already stifling you. 

Yesterday, I woke up and found scratches on my bedroom door. The only culprit was Lucy, but it was bizarre. She’d been acting strange lately, but she’d never done this before, and it’s not as if I keep her trapped in my room at night. The door is always wide open, so she’s free to leave. Nonetheless, she’d felt the need to scratch at it during the night. She’d really scratched it up too, to the point where I felt I needed to go check on her paws. So, I started my morning off searching for her, and feeling a little uneasy that I couldn’t hear her. She’s a noisy old thing, you know? I figured age must really be getting to both of us now: She didn’t feel like talking, and I was having a hard enough time listening. I tried to ignore that realization.

Looking for her made me feel lonely I guess. I’m not one to get lonely, but I think that’s only as long as it’s self induced. It wasn’t this time. Lucy might have needed me last night, but I couldn’t hear her. It didn’t matter what sort of company I’d facilitated for the two of us. I simply couldn’t be present. 

I did find Lucy eventually. After about ten minutes of wandering around the property and calling for her, there she was, right in the house. She’s an outdoor cat, however she usually stays close in the morning.

Indeed she was home but, rather unusually, asleep in my kitchen. She doesn’t tend to hide out there, and I wondered what drew her in. Maybe it was the dishwasher. The thing runs at night, creating vibrations and sounds and the likes. I assume Lucy found comfort in that. 

To my surprise, she did not react at all as I approached. She’s a skittish cat, and doesn’t tend to have much of an interest in being touched or pet unless it's on her terms. This time, however, only once I touched her did she even start. She lurched suddenly with some sense of being startled and clawed at my arm leaving a firm scratch. I didn’t mind, especially since now I knew she was alive and seemingly well. 

I expected her to bolt, but after her little warning she stayed unusually close. She seemed stressed, if I might try to identify such a feeling in a cat as aloof as Lucy. She was scanning the room and pacing around my legs as if she was on guard. I began to feel uneasy myself, a renewed version of that lonely-anxiety I’d felt upon waking up some twenty minutes ago. I suppose Lucy and I had grown accustomed to each other’s unwavering conviction about our isolated living situations, and so neither of us liked seeing the other so… off.

In an effort to calm my nerves I went to brew a pot of coffee. As I poured out the beans this lingering uneasiness I felt cemented itself into a cold hard reality. Something was very wrong. The beans fell into the pot silently. It’s like someone had dunked my head underwater the moment that first bean touched my kettle. Let me try and be more clear: When you pour out an item, you expect a noise. I think of pouring beans into a pot as a visual sort of thing, but it’s also just as much an auditory thing. In this case, instead of pouring out pattering-bean-noise, I was pouring out silence. Everything became completely stifled in an instance. 

The stifling was nothing like the densely packed snow I appreciated. I wished I could hear my organs and my heart beating. In fact, I wished I could hear anything at all that told me my body was still working. Instead, I suffered in a way that I still find difficult to describe. Maybe the equivalent is if someone turned on a beaming torch in my face and it blinded me. It’s the type of loss of vision you don’t expect, and it burns your eyes. Alternatively, it’s like when your leg falls asleep and you start to move it and notice how it’s all tingly and lost lots of feeling. It was like that for my ears, my head-my whole body; mercilessly having the sensation sucked out of it.

This emptiness was shocking and painful. My ears ached, desperately straining to get some sort of idea of what they should be feeling and hearing. My instincts racked my senses, begging for some kind of impulse or nerve trigger. I screamed. Well, I think I did. I couldn’t hear or feel myself beneath this relentless and oppressive lack of everything.

In those miserable moments, I strained to rationalize: I’ve gotten hard of hearing in my old age. Hell, even my mother lost all her hearing in her later years. Nothing explained this, though, and that was perhaps the hardest for me: The unknowingness; the crushing lack of everything, including an end in sight.

I can’t say how long we rotted like that, minutes? Seconds? Well, it eventually ended. Vibrations that felt like foreign and distant creaks and screams came rushing back in, rattling my whole body. A sort of overwhelming rush of silence, actual normal silence, pummeled my senses. My vision worked well enough I guess, but I felt so disorientated and out of balance I couldn’t help but stumble around and crash against my fridge before slumping to the ground. I caught a glimpse of Lucy having a similar reaction. She was frantically pacing with her mouth agape, her back arched, and her ears strained. 

Indeed the overwhelming destruction of sensation adjusted back towards normalcy in the way your eyes acclimate after a sudden-blinding light. Lucy and I lay there terrified and incapacitated. Two older souls, and as much as it pains me to say, older minds as well, trying to recover from such intensity. 

Lucy wandered apprehensively towards her food, and took a few nervous bites. I dragged myself up after her, and stared into the pot of coffee I’d tried to prepare. I winced just looking at the beans, perfectly still and silent. At that moment, more than anything, certainly far more than usual, I wished for another person. Another voice to help with that silence. I decided then that the least I could do was exercise my own voice. 

It felt immense to simply utter those words. I had to build up courage while fearing some mysterious disaster might befall us if I mustered even the slightest sound. Nonetheless, I called out for Lucy. It came out dull and raspy, like a cylinder of sandpaper being dragged out of my throat and along my tongue. It coughed, but nothing else happened. Lucy perked up and came over. For the briefest moment, I felt relief. She could hear me. I bent down to give her a reassuring pet when the second attack came.

This time, it came from elsewhere, though. It hadn’t occurred to me the first time that this overwhelming sensory devastation had a range and proximity. You could say it came in explosions with seemingly random catalysts. And this second time, the explosion was outside the house, not that we didn’t feel the shockwaves. I screamed again in response. It felt like my voice was being ripped away from my mouth. The noise I created was torn away from me and stifled into oblivion at an aggression and instance far greater than the speed and force of sound. 

I fell to my knees yet again as the shockwave tore through us. Lucy fared worse. She knocked out and with deep concern I could see blood coming out of her ears. A mixture of rage and desperation filled me as I dragged myself towards her and scooped her up. The explosion, which I will call it for now, beat down on us relentlessly. I could just barely keep my wits about me as I hobbled Lucy and I towards the front door. I had to get us out of there.

I burst out into a sunny day, and the explosion ceased. Adjusting back to reality for a second time was very painful. My head pounded and my body felt weaker than ever, but I pushed myself towards my driveway. It was beautiful outside. The serenity felt cruel and misleading. I glanced around with terror, wondering if whatever caused the last explosion was waiting to attack us, but there was nothing except the beautiful trees I knew all too well. The sun warmed my skin. I was deceptively comforted. I felt the urge to tell myself what had just happened was simply a newfound hysteria, onset with my age. Maybe I’d finally cracked. But Lucy. What about her? 

Thank the gods for Lucy, and that I held on to my suspicion anyway. I think both showed me the true nature of the silence and the stillness. The woods were too serene. They were too inviting, after what I had just experienced. I thought back to Lucy scratching at my seemingly safe and protective house last night. We were flies, lulled in and trapped by sweet sticky leaves of a looming-invisible venus flytrap, and it was snapping shut.

Committing to my suspicion, I threw open the driver’s side door and climbed in. I placed Lucy on the seat next to me and took a deep breath. I grit my teeth and started the engine. Immediately, a violent wave of stimulation came crashing into my eardrums. I was ready this time. Well, as ready as I could ever be for something like that, so I fought desperately to keep my hold on some sense of control. I backed my car onto the dirt road that connected my house to the rest of civilization. 

I gunned it forward and the miserable sensory drain worsened. It evolved into into its truer self. It took me further and further into its depths of nothingness, and revealed something far more horrifying than before. It sounded-no, more like it pulsed-nothingness. To my confusion, it pulsed like music. I mean, it was rhythmic. Somehow it was a rhythmic assault of lack that tore into my auditory senses which were desperate for any familiar reception to plug their bleeding, abandoned nerve-endings. It was horrifying how much it reminded me of actual music: Harmonious human-like voices and sounds were coming together, despite being the worst thing I’ve ever heard. It felt as though my soul was being battered, licked, and taunted, only moments away from being wrenched out of my body and annihilated by whatever unnatural anthem assaulted me. 

I reached the third bend from my house, and all at once the explosion stopped. I could hear the sound of my revving engine fade back into existence. I looked around wide-eyed, wondering what had changed. I couldn’t tell at the time, so I just drove for a long time, getting far away. I think I now know why it stopped, though: Lucy. She’d been claimed-digested.

I’m sorry to tell you she passed away. I cried as I buried her at the edge of the woods, and then I ran. I’m staying in a motel as I write to you. I’m afraid to go home, and I’m afraid to tell my kids. They’ll think I’m crazy. Maybe I am. I’m getting old, after all. Even I find it hard to believe those horrific experiences and how I handled them really ever made any sense. Writing out my thoughts, I feel like a buffoon, you know? I feel like you’ll shake your head, and sigh at the apparent delusions of an old, fading man. But I’m doing this anyway, because that haunting-excruciating song has been stuck in my head. It’s relentless.

The miserable echo has worn me down as I rest here in my motel. To be honest, this place feels safe now. It’s been so long since I stayed somewhere cozy and subdued like this. I forgot how beautiful and still even the plainest little motel room could be: The wallpaper is serene, my bed is soft and inviting, and I haven’t had to speak a single word in days.

I don’t think I have it in me this time; to make coffee or get up and paint. I’m all alone now, I’m very-very comfortable, and I just don’t think I can face the music again. I suppose I will embrace the silence, even if it means rotting and digesting in its enticing tendrils…

Whatever, I’m probably crazy, but before I go-however I go-I advise you stay sharp and present when it gets quiet, just in case.
