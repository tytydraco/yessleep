September 15th, 1893 - My Pa said that we were picking up our roots and headed to travel the country for his work. Pa’s a doctor, or at least he sells medicine with some other doctors. He and them all made some sort of tonic that helps folks with measles. But he said there’s a bunch of other places that have written to him begging to get ahold of some of his medicine. So now him and his pals are starting a caravan of sorts to go and cure all these people. 



September 17th, 1893 - We leave tomorrow at sunrise with eight other families to head down to a place called Johnsburg in Florida. I’m not rightly sure how we’re supposed to get down these with just a few agons, but I guess they have hope. Pa got a letter fro this town as a downpayment that had almost a hundred dollars in it. Pa and his friends split it to buy provisions for our trip, and I even got my own rifle from Witacker’s store. Pa said I could be our wagon’s protector in case any bandits or bad guys show up.



September 19th, 1893 - We been traveling a whole day now and Pa said our first stop is a small mountain in kentucky that wrote to him asking for some help. Pa had me paint the words “Jackson Medical Caravan" on a couple of our wagons. I even painted one on Enid’s wagon. If she ain’t the prettiest girl I ever seen…



September 22nd, 1893 - Last night, when we stopped to sleep for the night, I sat with a couple people my age from the group and they said that back in the town we stopped at today, they overheard one of the townsfolk tell his Pa that we shouldn’t be heading through Tennessee, and to go around the smoky mountains if we could. I suppose when his Pa asked why, he was just told that bad things would happen. Truth be though that we all think that guy was trying to steal or business or hide something. So we all agreed that we ought to go through anyway. 



September 24th, 1893 - We just crossed into Tennessee tonight. But a few wagons with big families in them ran into us on the trail. They said they got lost from their own group that was headed to Georgia, and our group told them they could follow us since we was heading south anyway. They talk funny though. 



September 25th, 1893 - The three wagons that joined us yesterday must be home to some odd folks. They don’t say a single word and always seem to just stare at us if we go up to them. Pa and the others won’t give them food though when they ask, cause it’s all the food we got until the next town.



September 26th, 1893 - Mrs. Hudson went missing last night. Her family woke up to her missing but Pa said she may have wandered into the woods to relieve herself and got lost. Her baby keeps screaming though, and her husband just yells at anyone who mentions it. We all decided as a group that if she doesn’t come back by tonight, we gotta leave in the morning. 



September 27th, 1893 - Mrs. Hudson showed back up last night, but she ain’t acting right. She won’t talk to nobody and keeps eating all the food. Mr. Hudson told Pa that something was wrong with her but when Pa looked at her, he said she just seems hungry and needs sleep. Her kids won’t even go around her now, and she doesn’t pay them any mind anyways. I just hope Pa don’t have to kick them out of the group. Her kids are sweet, and I doubt they would make it long on their own.



September 29th, 1893 - Mrs. Hudson just keeps looking more strange. Her skin is white as a ghost, and lips almost seem black as night. Her eyes look bloodshot beyond belief too. To make matters worse, the strange families that joined us left in the middle of the night, and they stole half our food stock too. I told Pa that I was gonna head out in the morning and hunt for some meat to cook. He said it would be a huge help, so I plan to do just that!



October 2nd, 1893 - Two girls have gone missing from the group now. SueAnne and Eliabeth both ate nowhere to be seen. SueAnne is a Hudson, and Lizzy was her best friend. A few families think Mrs. Hudson had something to do with it, but when they said that, Mr. Hudson almost shot them for saying a thing like that. They got a search party out for them right now, They said they would be back by morning.



October 3rd, 1893 - Pa woke me up this morning and said we needed to go. The whole group packed up as Harriet, Lizzie’s mom, broke down and started crying like a maniac. She screamed at Mrs. Hudson who just sat there staring at her. She ran up and started hitting her but Pa and some other men stopped her. She blames Mrs. Hudson for what happened. I asked Pa what they found on the search and he just said Lizzy had passed away, and SueAnne runnin through the woods like a wild animal. I laughed thinkin that part was a joke, but Pa said it wasn’t. What on earth got into her? I rode with Enid and her family while we talked about what animals we passed by today.



October 5th, 1893 - Things should be way happier than they have been. Every town we’ve stopped at to sell Pa’s medicine has made more money than I’ve ever seen. I shouldn’t have looked but our stash has almost six hundred dollars in it. We’re gonna be rich and yet nobody but me and Enid seem happy. I guess our group has paid a small price, on account of some bad luck. Enid said she’s gonna build one of them castles we see in books. I think I’ll take my share and start my own caravan so that I can see the country and make money doing it!



October 6th, 1893 - Everybody is having a meeting by the fire right now. Mr. Hudson was found tonight, or at least part of him. Now everyone is trying to figure out what’s going on. Mrs. Hudson and her kids are all missing now too. SueAnne was acting right since that night she went missing but her brother Thomas seemed pretty normal. I guess they all decided to have three men keep guard at night from now on. They’re gonna make sure nobody leaves or approaches the camp, and also make sure the lanterns and fire stay lit all night. Any of the men who volunteer to stand guard would get to sleep in a wagon during the trip the following day. I asked Pa if I could be a guard, but he said it was too dangerous and me and him were gonna sleep by the fire tonight.



October 10th, 1893 - I don’t know what to think of the last few nights, or last night in particular. Each night, more people kept disappearing. None of our watchmen saw them leave either, which only makes things weirder. Most of them were kids or women, but Hank, Pa’s best friend, went missing last night. Enid snuck passed the watchmen and didn’t show back up until early this morning. Luckily nobody noticed she went missing for a while. I promised her I would cover for her if anybody caught on.



October 12th, 1893 - We started our trip with thirty eight people, and now we’re down to only fifteen. I can see that Pa is beside himself, he doesn’t do a good job at hiding it. Enid has been quiet, but I figure it’s because her mom went missing and never showed back up. Her Pa just sits in silence in their wagon, not saying a word. Most of the folks that go missing never turn back up. But unfortunately sometimes they find them…or parts of them. Pa said someone is following the group and hunting us. He said when we get to the next town, we should stay for a while. The others agreed and we’re making way for a town called Youngsville in northern Georgia.



October 13th, 1893 - Enid and I went to the town’s pond tonight to listen to the frogs. She sat down on the shore with me and we talked about what had happened. I asked her why she seemed so calm about her Ma missing, but she said she’s in a better place now. I sat with her for a bit and got up to leave but she insisted that we stay. She lit a lantern and hung it on the tree beside us. She said her Ma would see the light if she was out there, and would come back home. I thought the idea was a bit far-fetched, but it wasn’t my place to deny her hope. We sat in silence for a bit before we heard rustling in the woods by us. I turned to see what it was but Enid jumped on me. She howled and yelled like an animal and started cutting my arms up with her nails. I yelled at her to get off but she wouldn’t. Then the figure we heard in the woods approached, it was a thin and underfed woman, with dirty hair and a tattered dress. As she stepped closer into the light, I recognised her as Enid’s mother. She walked slowly and carefully like a wild animal. Enid has pinned me down with unnatural strength, but as I thought I had been done for, I heard a gunshot ring out and something wet hit my face. Enid fell to the ground. Another shot hit the lantern and the fire exploded onto nid’s mom, who ran into the woods screaming and burning. My Pa and Enid’s Pa scooped me off the ground and brought me back to town. Not a word was spoken.



October 14th, 1893 - Pa and Enid’s father, Franklin all packed up their belongings at the inn early this morning. They decided that there was definitely more than one of those things stalking our group, and that sneaking away would be the safest option, as they would be hunting the majority. Pa thought it would be cowardly to do that, and maybe he was right. But Franklin reminded him of what happened to his own family, and Pa started packing again. He and Franklin split up the money from their sales and left the other’s cuts in their wagons. Today, the three of us all took one wagon and fled town. We got as far away as possible as fast as we could. Only time will tell if it worked.



November 14th, 1893 - I found this journal after it had been stored away in a provisions crate by accident. Our trip home was actually rather smooth. To our surprise, the only threats we faced were a few bears but they scare off easily. Pa said he and Franklin were going to build a business here in town, as their traveling days were behind them. I still think about Enid and what I saw at the pond. I don’t like to ponder it too much though.

November 21st, 1893 - Pa got a letter from Johnsburg today. They asked him where they were, as nobody had shown up yet. Pa assumed the worst, and wrote back about the events that unfolded on the journey. Those poor folks never made it to Johnsburg. I sometimes feel guilt for what happened and how we left. But Pa reminded me that it was either we live and they die, or we all die. My only concern is after what I saw at the pond, I don’t think those people are dead at all…
