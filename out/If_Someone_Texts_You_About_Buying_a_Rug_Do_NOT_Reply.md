"Do you still need a rug for your home? Good condition and the price is negotiable. Call me anytime."


That was the first thing I read that morning while still in bed, as I picked up my phone to turn off the alarm. The sender's number wasn't saved in any of my contacts. It was sent at 4:00 AM.


I assumed I accidentally ended up on some spam list and ignored it, as the apartment I had been living in for the last month was already fully furnished. It was annoying, but I had to get ready for work and those things tend to happen. 


My workplace was just a short metro trip from the apartment. I lived alone, although my boyfriend Terry was planning to move in with me in a few weeks.


My supervisor, was waiting for me at the reception area.  Unfortunately for the first day since I got the job, the metro was late.


I worked at a consulting firm, and the only other time she had greeted me in the two months I worked there was on my first day. Not arriving on time was already not a good impression.


"Good morning, Monica. I'm afraid to inform you that the meeting we discussed has been scheduled for 11 O'clock. I'll need your report by then." My gut was twisted by anxiety.


"My report is almost finished. I'll have it on your desk by 11." I said, trying to keep a natural expression.


"That's great. See you later." 


The report wasn't exactly almost finished so realized I couldn't waste any time. I went straight to my cubicle.


There was a pink Post-it on the monitor.
"I still need your answer for tonight =)"


"Damn! I knew I forgot something." My friend Katy asked if we could have a double date at my place since I live alone. Terry had a night shift he didn't reply until this morning. 


She probably put the post it before I arrived this morning, as I forgot to reply to her last night. I quickly texted her that we would be there, then put my phone in flight mode to better focus on the report.


It wasn't easy but I managed to finish the report just in time. Lunchtime had already started by the time the meeting was over, so I went time to the cafeteria. Katy was already eating.


"Hey." I sat at her table.


"Hey. Are you still too busy to answer your phone?" She said with a smug expression.


"Sorry, I forgot to reply. But today I have been really busy. I got late and a rescheduling happened... Which nobody told me about until this morning."


"Damn, I'm sorry that you had it rough. So... Are you and Terrence not coming tonight?"


"We'll be coming. Didn't you see my text?" I looked at her, confused.


"What text? I didn't receive anything"


I pulled out my phone. It was still in flight mode. "I was sure I texted you earlier this morning, let me check..."


I got a notification about an unread message. The rug salesman had sent the same message again. 


"Oh, you're right... I accidentally replied to someone else." I kept looking at my phone as I didn't believe it.


Given the hurry, I absentmindedly sent the message to the top contact, which would have been Katy if the unknown number never texted me. I quickly replied that I mistakenly texted him and wasn't interested in any rug, then blocked the contact.


Katy laughed. "Monica, I told you that you focus too much on work. You should relax more!" she said, with her mocking smile in full display, "But don't worry, drinks are on me tonight. "


"Sure." I let out a small laugh. "Just make sure to not throw up in my living room. I remember the last party."


"We'll be fine. Alex is a good guy, he'll let stop me in time. I hope so at least."


The rest of the day was also stressful. Due to the rescheduling, I had way more work piled up than usual.


Terry would meet at home before dinner, to help me get the place ready. I had a shower, got changed and then I browsed social media on my phone, waiting for Terry.


I  noticed I had yet another unread message. It was another message about the rug, the same as the previous ones, but from a different number.


This was getting annoying. I just blocked contact without replying.


Terry arrived not long after, bringing the cake. 
I greeted him with a kiss and then we started cleaning up. We were talking about our respective workdays when my phone buzzed.


I expected Katy to tell me she was running late. 


"For fuck sake!" I exclaimed, slamming my hand on the table. It was another spam message about the rug.


"What's wrong, honey?" Asked Terry, worried about the sudden change in my expression.


"Sorry, it's been a long day. It seems my number ended up in some spam marketing list, so I have been getting texts all day. It's so annoying!"


"Have you blocked them?"


"Yes, twice. Those assholes don't seem to know when to stop. Maybe I should call the police?"


"For what, a spam message? Don't bother. Maybe you should just call them and tell them to fuck off."


"Are you serious?"


"Yeah, my sister worked at a call center, you know those about phone plans. She said her contract dictated to try again with the same client until they accepted or got an explicit refusal."


I wasn't really in the mood to argue and just wanted to stop it. "Alright, but you do it." I handed the phone to Terry. "I've had enough for today."


He called the number. After a couple of rings, the unknown seller picked up.


"Hello?" Terry's voice was followed by a complete silence. We could only hear faint breathing coming from the other side of the phone.

 
"Listen, I'm not interested in any rug. I don't want anything. Stop texting this number." More silence followed.


"Hello? Are you there? Just stop bothering me." Another ten seconds of silence later, the other number had hung up.


"It's probably an automated calling service or something like that. I doubt a real person was even on the other hand." Tried to explain to Terry while I was bringing the tablecloth.


"You're right. Hopefully, they got the message."
I had calmed down and just wanted to look forward to the night.


Around 20 minutes later the doorbell rang again. Katy and her boyfriend Alex had arrived. 
She greeted me by handing me a bottle of wine, while Alex followed her with the pizzas.


We were about to eat when the doorbell rang again. I looked at Katy, puzzled. "Did you invite someone else?"


"No. I thought it was just the four of us tonight, right?" She was looking just as puzzled as me.


Alex, as he was sitting closest to the door, went to open the door, as I got up from the table.


"I think it's your order, Monica. Someone must have left it here." He had picked up a sealed cardboard box as he closed the door.


"I wasn't expecting any package. They probably got the wrong address." 


"But it's your apartment number. This is #14, isn't it?" Alex put the package on the floor. It was a plain cardboard package. The address was correct.


"I'm sure, I did not order anything recently. Besides, isn't it too late for deliveries?" Christmas was in more than a month and nowhere near closer to my birthday. Terry also isn't the kind of guy to randomly make gifts.


Katy pat me on the back. "Well, maybe you have a secret Santa. Although a bit early. Let's see what's inside."


As I opened the box, my heart skipped a beat. A blue cheap-looking rug rolled up, with a red outline inside.


"What the fuck... This can't be real." 
I took a step back and looked at Terry, just to confirm that I wasn't hallucinating. He was also astounded.


"It's just... a rug? What's the big deal?" Asked Katy, trying to understand my reaction. Terry briefly summed up the story, while I couldn't avoid to look at the package.


"Maybe there was an error and the automated system sent an order for you instead of--"


The doorbell rang. Katy still looked confused. "Maybe they realized the mistake and came to take the rug back?"


Terry went to open the door. He looked around and then went back inside. "There was nobody. Are there some kids pulling pranks in this building?"


"I don't know... but whatever, why don't we just get back to the pizzas?"
We were about to start eating when we heard a couple of knocks, but they weren't from the door.


Everybody froze. Terry spoke first after what felt like an eternity. "It came from the balcony...? We are on the third floor!"


We couldn't see the balcony from the living room, as it could only be accessed from my bedroom.


"I'm calling the police. This isn't funny anymore." I picked up my phone. I noticed I had gotten another message. "Order accepted." From yet another unknown number. 


I tried not to think about it and dialed 911, my fingers trembling. We heard the doorbell again.


We looked at the door as the doorbell kept ringing nonstop. "What do you want from us? Fuck off!" Shouted Terry, while the knock on the balcony had resumed.


"911, what's your emergency?" A relief hit me as the operator picked up the phone.


"Someone is trying to get inside my apartment. We don't know who they are. Please help us!"


"What's the address of the em--" The call was cut short as the lights went out. Everything was pitch black, aside from the light from my phone, which had lost reception.


Something shifted in the dark. "Stay away from the door!" Terry and Alex had moved in front of me and Katy, grabbing kitchen knives from the table. Not long after, Katy's phone illuminated the dark room.


The front door was still closed, as well as the door to my bedroom that faced the balcony. The cardboard box, however, had been moved: the rug had been laid out on the floor and was no longer rolled up.


"What the fuck!? There is someone else in there! Monica, call 911." 


I hit the recall button, my fingers still trembling. "T-the reception... It's still gone."  I could feel my heartbeat shooting up.


"Try with mine." Terry handed me his phone.


I tried calling again and again, while we stood in the darkness.
"It's not working either! Katy, try with your phone please."


"A-alright." Katy's pointed her phone downwards, as the darkness engulfed us. 
We couldn't hear anything else but ourselves, as the doorbell and the banging noises from the balcony seemed to have stopped.


"I've got no reception either! Alex, try it as well." Alex also pulled out his phone.


"Shit. Same for my phone. What do we do? Should we try making a run for it?" 


"We have to try. Terry, what do you think?"


We could only hear his breathing as Terry didn't reply. "Terry?" I asked, grabbing his arm. Except that was not Terry. What I just touched felt rough, like sandpaper or rusty metal.


I screamed, dropping my phone. Then the lights came back. I felt reassured when I didn't see any stranger in the room and could still see Alex and Katy's faces.


As our eyes adjusted to the sudden lights, the terror returned, magnified. Blood had been splattered everywhere on the floor, with a trail leading to the door to my bedroom, now ajar. 


Katy and Alex also screamed. Terry was missing.


"Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Monica, we have to get out of here."


I ignored her and was about to go to the bedroom, determined to look for Terry.


"Now. Let's go." Alex grabbed my arm and pulled me to the front door, still closed. I stumbled on the cardboard box while looking at the bedroom door. 


As I looked down, my eyes filled with tears. Inside the box was a severed arm, drenched in blood. A piece of a shirt was still attached to the arm, and it looked exactly like what Terry was wearing.


I rushed outside the apartment, screaming. The neighbors had already called 911 due to the noise. The police questioned us and searched the whole building, with no results.


When they were done it was late at night and I couldn't return to the apartment. I did not want to return, after what happened, and Katy asked me to spend the night at her place. 


I was heartbroken and couldn't stop crying. Alex and Katy tried to comfort me, and I could feel they were also shaken. I told them they could go to bed, wishing goodnight.


It's no surprise that I couldn't sleep that night. I tried to close my eyes, but it reminded me too much of the darkness from earlier.


I tried to watch TV to not think about it, but I couldn't forget. I must not forget. So I started writing this down, hoping to finally fall asleep.


I had been asleep for a couple of hours at most when I was woken up by a notification sound. After checking, it didn't come from mine. I noticed Katy had left her phone on the couch after going to sleep. 


I was about to move it out of the way when I gasped. I couldn't help but read the received message: "Do you still need a rug for your home? Good condition and the price is negotiable. Call me anytime."
