You know how most of us, have trouble sleeping and sometimes that trouble can manifest itself into the "sleep demon".  But, why are they called this?  Sulk isn't a demon.  Yeah his name is Sulk and hates being called a demon.  He prefers imp and Gremlin....when he's feeling extra shitty.  

It all started around the time of puberty.  Those days, I was a raging pile of hormones, energy drinks, videogames and reefer.  So there was no wonder my sleep schedule was non-existent.  Sure I could have been chasing tail.  But Runewords and making bank by running my Ranger in EQ Worlds seemed.. more worth it?  Idk, but such was my time.

Anywho, I started having these fits where, due to having stayed up for days if not weeks at a time.  I would have moments where I would "sleep" but not be "asleep".  If that makes sense?  Like I has Sonombilism and in some narcoleptic like trance.  I would shut down, get rest and then suddenly wake up and continue on like nothing happened.

Months of this would occurr until one night.  A buddy of mine.  We will call him Kos.  Says to me, "Hey dude, you know if you keep this up you will lose your turn." I really wish I had listened to the man cause at first.  I thought this was just the ramblings of my Russian brother from another mother.  (Yes he's actually Russian)

Not taking my friend's advice.  I decided to go one more night and sorta wish I didn't....but then.  I wouldn't know my other bestie...Sulk.  See, Sulk had been keeping tabs on me.  Him and much of these other dream eaters and such.  Apparently our dreams are like a currency to those who exist in the sleeping world and that night.  Somehow.  I went there.

I know this all sounds all broken up.  Nonsensical and even made up.  Indeed, but it's true folks I went to Dreamscape.  The place is fine.  It's some of the folks there that are.  Unsavory?  Yeah we'll use that.  Well through all of the travel, countless nights and days of binging whatever.  I had nearly forgotten why it was I had even started.  Funny how that works?

But we had lost Grandpa then and unlike most of my family.  I was destroyed by this.  So in hindsight I must have lashes out with anything any everything I could.  The end result?  Waking up to some small short stack prick who like to tell me the most random shit one could possibly.  Don't believe me?

See supposedly, these bastards are supposed to induce fear and resentment.  But as the TV comes on....and his smug little shit eating grin forms.  It's the announcement voiceover.  That won me over.  Yes he talks like that one announcer from ScreenRants.  

"This Sunday, you too can the be proud owner of this random bullshit that even your grandma wouldn't have bought.  Let's order nine!!!"

It was like those old QVC ads you'd watch during insomnia attacks in the 90s.  But HE was voicing them.  Somehow controlling the TV too.  Every night now, this little prick, shows up, haunts me with fucking ads and then.  Just as I'm about to scream in frustration.  I and I'm not making this up.  Will for some reason fart.  To which what will he say?

"Febreeze!!"

What an asshole!!!?
