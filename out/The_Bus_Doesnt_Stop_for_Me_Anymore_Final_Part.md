“I’m sorry!” Kayden yelled back at me as I pushed him into the corner, my hand on his chest and the paper held high above my head.

  “Sorry? Sorry that you *forgot* that the bus I take everyday doesn’t fucking run anymore!” I was bellowing, a small fear crossed my mind that Bev or a customer would hear but I was furious, tired and miserable.

  He placed his hand on my arm and sighed, “Just listen, I didn’t forget, I just guessed it was runnin’ again.” He gestured to the paper, “It wasn’t a big story for anyone but the people who took the bus but yeah, kid vanished and the fucker gets retired, had to start taking the one fiftyfive.”

  I stepped back and frisbeed the paper into a table, “So…so what? It’s just back, running again?” He shrugged and I started to pace, “Can I call the council about it?” 

  He nodded, “Most likely.”



Kayden spent the rest of the shift sorting the papers while I sat anxiously on hold, for such a small town the council was awfully busy. Once I was finally connected and an old crotchety woman relayed line after line of text about the fiftyfive, it was retired, dismantled and discarded. It shouldn’t exist was the answer I got.

  I collapsed down, my head thunked against a drawer and Kayden looked over with distress, “You good, man?”

  *Why didn’t he tell me,* I asked myself, *why did he not tell me?* I rose to my feet and shoved my phone in my pocket, “I’m fine, I’ll finish off the papers, you go out front.”

  Kayden smiled weakly and scooped up his work, wandering out the front of the store and started setting up a halfassed display. I whispered to myself, “Why didn’t you tell me?” Paused for a moment, “Fucker.”

  The rest of the shift I didn’t speak to Kayden, he felt like too much of a guilty participant. *Everyone is involved, everyone,* I started to tell myself, again and again, until the words blended together into a messy soup. I had decided, the drunken man kidnapped Leroy, Gary had killed him, Kayden and Grant were hiding it. Every time I looked to the front of the store my stomach would sink, Kayden happily serving and working while he was hiding the sick truth behind my son’s murder.

  As the shift grinded to its finish line I grabbed my stuff and stormed outside. I saw Kayden hustle to pack his shit away into a little bag to catch up but I needed to get away and think of a plan. Would the police agree with me? Would they fuck it all up? I thundered down the footpath towards the bus and heard the quick clips and clops of Kayden’s work shoes, “Wait up, dickwad!”

  I swung around to him and without a thought drove my fist into his face, he tumbled over, rolled off the path and into the gutter. “Dickwad? Call the man who lost his kid a dickwad?”

  He wiped his nose, checking for blood, “Jesus fuck, sorry.”

  “I should kill you here,” I spat, “nobody around, no risk in it.” His eyes shot to mine, his pupils thinned as panic filled his body.

  “What the fuck? Why would you?” He paused and tried to gather his thoughts, “What the fuck did I do?”

  “You lied about the bus, you didn’t tell me!” I yelled down at him as he tried to rise to his feet, I kicked him in the side, sending him back to the ground.

  “That’s it?!” He screamed at me, “Fucking hell man, I fucking forgot!”

  “Bullshit! You’re hiding everything from me, covering for those sick fucks. Admit it!” I screeched desperately, a few people wandered out of buildings to see the commotion, some filming us.

  “Don’t ever accuse me of that shit,” Kayden said softly but angrily, “I will break your face for that.” I went to kick him again but he dove for my legs and toppled me, immediately jumping to his feet afterwards, “Pull yourself together or we’ll never find him.” His words were so quiet but frightened me, like a gentle parent suddenly turned sour.

  He extended a hand and I batted it away, “I know that something is going on, don’t lie to me.” I rose to my feet and turned away.

  “Look after yourself Freddy, please.” He said as I wandered off, tears rolled down my cheeks. I wanted to believe he was good, but I couldn’t shake the feeling. *Everyone is involved, everyone.*



I rode the bus home alone, my eyes scanning my phone for texts, I typed a few before deleting them. Apologies, accusations, just friendly banter, I didn’t know what to do. Before I knew it the bus screeched to a halt.

  I was at the first step when I saw the hulking freak at the end of the street, waving to me, smiling. I paused for a moment, hand on the railing, foot out the door and my body in. I was deciding if I should run at him or hide. If we fought he would kill me, if we didn’t he would be free. I decided to attack him and started bolting down the road, he turned away and started to drag himself out of view behind an abandoned house. 

  I pushed on as hard as I could, each footstep crunching the gravel beneath my feet, my balance waned and I thought I was going to topple. I steadied myself and charged forward, hands balled into fists, “Stop, motherfucker!”

  I reached where I last saw him and as I turned to look a massive arm stuck out and crashed into my throat. My head hit the ground and my vision vanished. When I awoke I was laying out of sight of the main road, my head and neck hummed in agony.

  Looking around, my wallet was open and the contents scattered around, my pockets were flipped inside out and my shoes were removed. He had searched every inch of me. Scooped up my wallet first and saw everything was there, including the money. I slotted the cards back into place and stuffed them into my pocket. I shoved my feet back into my shoes and patted myself down, *keys, where are my keys?*

  I spun around in panic, searching the ground desperately. My feet dragged along the dirt, dust kicked up making it hard to see and then I heard a PLINK and turned to see my keys flying down the road, I had kicked them.

  I let out a thankful sigh and wandered over, shoving them into my other pocket. As I trudged home I reported the encounter to the police and they were at my house before I was, questioning every inch of my story before vanishing into the night. I sat on my porch and waited that night, I’m not sure what for. Leroy? The drunk? A single text from Kayden? Whatever I was waiting for never came and with massive pushback from my brain I went back inside.

  The following morning came and I rose from my bed, three texts from Kayden;

  “I didn do nothin”

  “Im sorry I didn realise u didn no”

  “God im so sorry this mus b awful 4 u”

  I looked at the messages and tapped my phone against my palm, *everyone is involved, everyone.* I simply couldn’t shake it, I started typing back an angry text and as my fingers spilled across the keyboard, missing letter after letter I was cut short, Beverly was calling me.



“Want to explain why you bullied Kayden, threw *my* newspaper and forced him to do all your work?” She roared through the phone.

  “Bev, listen, my son is missing and I…”

  “Fuck off with this shit, Kayden deserves to be beaten for your missing son?” She paused for an answer but I had none so she just continued, “You’re good as done, find new work.”

  “Beverly please, I need this!” I cried, trying desperately to cling to the job but it was over.

  “You’re fired Fredrick, good luck.”

  I backspaced my message to Kayden and just replaced it with, “I got fired.”

  He spat back a few dozen texts, short rapid ones and I just tossed my phone onto my bed and made breakfast. I sat down in front of the paper my son left, its corners folding up around the rock I placed to hold it flat. I slid my arm across the table and pinched the edge, trying to squish it flat but it just bounced back, tried again and once more it recoiled. So instead I grabbed the rock and hurtled it across the room, obliterating my front window, glass shotgunned out into the yard, twinkling as they hit hard obstacles halting their descent.

  I turned to the paper and lifted it, looking closely at it for a clue that didn’t exist, I started to tear it down the middle, as the sound entered my ears I panicked and let it float down.

  “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” I mumbled to the paper, the last words my son ever spoke to me, scooping it back up and bringing it to his room, placing it flat on his pillow.

  I collected my damage from the front yard and tossed it into my wheelie bin, looking longingly inside, my eyes wandered off, just beside the bin was an odd divot, about as deep as my foot, it led all the way to the road.



I never responded to Kayden’s text messages, they came in everyday for a month, before slowing to a once a week thing. They were so desperate, sad apologies, begging me to call him, to be safe. He really seemed to care. My life went on to become meaningless, I got two casual jobs, a shelf stocker at night and a carwasher during the day. The work was awful but the pay was enough. I took the same buses in and out, watching the ghost bus, fiftyfive, thunder past each morning I worked, seeing Gary’s face, he didn’t look at me anymore.

  The drunk seemingly vanished, the cops never found him, assuming he was hiding in a drainage pipe or other odd spot. They promised that they would catch him but had no idea where to even start looking.

  I stopped looking for my son, I stopped sitting on the porch, I stopped watching his last moment on tape and I hadn’t checked his room since I left the paper in there. Months dragged on and on and slowly I just gave up. I planned the many ways I should die and chickened out of them all, just pushed on deeper and deeper into my collapsing life. 

  I woke up late one morning to get ready to stock shelves, I slipped on my jacket and walked into the hallway, liquid trickled in a solid line from my son’s room to the wall. I kneeled down and instantly whiffed the stench of alcohol. Turning to look at the door my stomach sank, I had never even thought about desecrating my son’s room with liquor.

  I placed my hand on the doorknob and twisted it, peeling it open to reveal the pitch black void of the room. An odd stench hit my nose, not strong enough to pierce through the door but with the door open it drove itself into my nose and made me stumble backwards. I squinted and saw nothing, I reached for the light switch and felt fleshy bumps lining it.

  I recoiled and whacked hard into the doorframe, I heard something in the room stumble back too, hefty thuds and a slow grind. I shoved my hand into my pocket and withdrew my phone. Turning on the flashlight I revealed the massive shape of a man.

  His teeth were like disorganised stones and he was tall enough that his head rested against the ceiling fan, scrunched in his knuckles was the note, he started to laugh his awful, slow, laugh.

  Then he spoke, softly, no emotion came from his body, “Your son seemed so lovely.” He heaved out a few more laughs and then struck my hand and knocked the phone to the floor, immediately plunging the room into darkness and hiding the monster from sight. I couldn’t see him coming as he charged me and yanked me into the yawning abyss that was my son’s room. I heard the door slam shut as I entered and now I was stuck with the beast, I could feel his hand let go of my shirt and I swung wildly towards him but struck nothing, then he grabbed my face, squishing my cheeks between his fingers.

  “I used the window,” he wheezed out, “reached through the hole and cracked it open.” I struggled to speak, sputtering out some words and he crammed his dirty fingers into my mouth, grabbing my tongue, “Shhh, let me talk.” He pushed me back into the dresser against the back wall, his fat body overlapping my arms and I could feel his breath as he looked down at me.

  “I love reading his note, again and again. He was so brave.” He laughed, “I’m sorry for what happened to him.” I drove my knee up and crushed his crotch but without flinching he grabbed the top of my head and slammed it into the dresser, making me immediately feel dizzy.

  “Stop it, stop hurting yourself.” He let go of my hair but not my tongue. I gagged on his filthy fingers and tried to bite them but it did nothing. “If you don’t stop and leave it alone, our boys will be gone forever.”

  My mind raced as he spoke, *our boys?* He continued, “I tracked them down too, the fake bus, the freak on board it. Nearly killed him, then that scrawny fuck broke my damn leg, I beat the piss out of him. I wasn’t thinking, he didn’t deserve it.”

  My vision slowly adjusted to the dark, I saw his visage, drool draped his chin like a diamond necklace, a smile clung to his face like a mask, “Then the old man said to me, *only I know where he is, kill me and you’ll never have him back, dead or alive.* So I left, deciding it wasn’t worth it. Then I heard you speaking on the phone about the bus that doesn’t stop, I had to stop you, I need my boy home.” He then whimpered and began to sob, “I need my boy home, I need him. Oh God, I need him back.”

  He let go of me and slunk to the floor, I spat a wad of saliva onto the carpet and then wretched a few times, turning to face the crying behemoth. His tears were ironically accompanied by a smile, one he couldn’t break easily.

  “Gary did it?” I whimpered, “You’re sure?” He nodded in response and rose to his feet, “Thank you. Get the fuck out of my house.”

  “I need you to promise,” he shot back, “promise you won’t do anything, promise me!”

  “Get out.” I swung the door to the hallway open.

  He charged at me and grabbed my throat with his massive paws, “I will kill you, if you even think about ruining this. I will break your fucking head off and mail it to your wife.” He let go and I dropped to the floor, watching him leave my house. I turned to my son’s room, filth covered the carpet, bottles, paper bags and useless knickknacks. I looked at the time, 2AM, I needed to get ready, I needed to catch the fiftyfive.



I walked down the road, past the houses, past the trees and past my usual bus stop. The bus would stop for Kayden, so it would have to stop for me. I felt so foolish, a hoodie two sizes too small pulled up over my head, an old mask from a box I got back in 2020 on my face. I couldn’t let them know it was me, I needed to board that bus and kill Gary.

  I had a kitchen knife in my hoodie’s pocket and all I needed was a single moment to lunge, Kayden would probably wrestle me away so I would need to make the attack lethal, throat or chest. A knot balled in my guts, I felt cruel, evil, I was planning a murder. I shook the feeling away, thinking about my son lost and alone or in the clutches of that sick pervert.

  After an hour of walking I reached the stop, sitting with a cigarette draping from his lips was Kayden, he looked tired. The cigarette was lit but he hadn’t ashed it in a while so it was half soot. I stood close to the stop, folded my hands in my front pocket, the handle of the knife nestled comfortably in my right palm.

  “You’re new.” I heard him say to me, half mumbled from the obstruction in his mouth. I didn’t turn or respond, I couldn’t risk blowing my cover. I heard him stamp out the dead dart and continue, “Not many new blokes round here, such a dead street,” he sucked air in hard to cleanse his lungs, “only me, Gary and his granddaughter.”

  I felt a chill run down my spine and clenched the handle hard, “Did you say daughter?” 

  “Yeah?” I heard concern in his voice, “Is that bad?”

  “He only had a grandson.” I mumbled to myself as pieces slotted into place, the kid that was with him, was it always the same kid? No, the hair, brown one day, blonde the next, the thoughts shot through my head so quickly, how did I miss this? *How many kids has he taken?* I thought to myself and then I asked it out loud, angrily, turning to Kayden, “How many kids has he taken?”

  I caught the realisation in his eyes, “Fred?”

  “Shut the fuck up, think, the kid is never the same,” I pulled the mask off my mouth and nose, “he has a new kid with him every fucking day, how many kids it that?”

  “Freddy, I think you’re just confused,” he had a soft smile on his lips and fear in his eyes, “remember, it ain’t Gary.”

  I gritted my teeth, “The drunk who attacked him, why was he attacking him?”

  “To get his grandson,” a sudden pause, “or granddaughter?”

  “No, I confronted him, he told me everything,” I was sobbing at this point, Kayden’s eyes were oddly watering too, “Gary took his kid and you stopped him, you had no idea of course.”

  He wiped his eyes, “And you’re sure of this?” I nodded and Kayden continued, “Then I’ll help.”

  I shook my head, “Once I kill him, just call the cops, I am willing to die in prison for this.”

  “Fuck that, we’re killing this pervert together.” He stepped up to me like he was going to cave my head in.

  “Why? Why do you care so fucking much?”

  His face dropped, his smile drooped to an awful frown and the tears started to flow harder than mine, “My daughter,” he collapsed back onto the bench, “I was a real young Dad, had a little girl on accident. I loved her with everything I had, then she wandered off one morning.” He pointed to the East, “Some little store near our work actually, I turned away for a second and she was gone. Just like that.”

  “I’m so…”

  He interrupted, “When they found her body it was all twisted, legs round the wrong way,  arms folded backwards, her neck was crooked to the side.” He placed his face in his hands, “She was only four, man. Someone mangled her, a four year old.”

  The buses’ lights covered us in an angelic glow and I hid my face, “You’re a good man Kayden.” The bus squealed to a halt, Kayden stood and we both started to board, I turned to him and shoved him off, he hit his back hard on the dirt, his eyes wide with confusion. I withdrew the knife and spun around to Grant, “Drive or I’ll cut you open.” He nodded and put his foot on the gas, “Just do your normal route, no stops.”

  “Okay, okay,” he looked shaken, “just don’t hurt us.”

  I turned to face Gary who was half standing, panic in his eyes, no kid with him. “Where’s the boy?” I asked.

  “He was sick today, let’s be reasonable Fred.” He had already clocked who I was.

  I walked down the aisle towards him, the knife firmly in my grasp, “How many kids?” He looked puzzled, “How many kids have you taken, you old fuck?”

  “What in the hell are you talking about?” He was clenching his teeth, sweat formed on his brow.

  “This bus isn’t real, your grandson changes,” I waved the knife around, “I spoke to that massive drunk, the one who tried to kill you, he told me.”

  A beat passed and then Gary started to laugh, a laugh filled with a hideous joy that churned my stomach, “Freddy, you’re an awful father.” I lunged forward and he yelled, “Kill me and you never see him again!”

  The knife was inches from his neck, the blade reflecting the passing lights, I was shaking, my heart thundered in my chest, “Where is he, where is my boy?”

  “Sit,” he gestured to the seat across from himself, “let me tell you one more tale, one more warning.”

  “Fuck you.” I spat in response.

  “Do you want to see him?” He questioned a hiss in his voice, “If you don’t sit I’ll never tell.” I conceded and sat down, the knife still pointed in his direction, “Thank you, Fred.”

  He rotated to be at an angle so he could face me better, “Once there was a boy. He was young in the fifties, a small boy. His parents let him wander around the park, all by himself. One day, when he walked off on his own, a man took him to the bathroom and hurt him.” 

  He paused and his face went red, eyes filled with tears, “He hurt the boy in such an awful way. As the boy grew he started to hate his parents, why did they let him walk off on his own? What was wrong with them? As the young boy grew into an adult he saw child after child, all by themselves, ready to be taken by a wandering monster. One day he snapped and yelled at a father, in return he was pushed down and beaten.”

  A smile crept across Gary’s face, “So the young man waited until their kid was alone again and he took the boy. He took the boy to the back of a store and stabbed him until he was gone. Now, the parents will learn. You see, adults were too strong for the thin man but kids, they’re just flimsy enough.”

  I could feel bile rise in my throat, “Oh God. “ I murmured out.

  Gary continued, “He was doing the world a service, so the man did it again, and again, and again, and again. Each kid he saw alone, he would take and he would slaughter, these awful, awful parents would finally understand. He hurt them good too, the only way to send a message is to make them suffer. But the man needed a better way, so he stole drugs from the chemist he worked at and hopped on a bus, the fiftyfive.”

  My heart stung from beating so hard, Gary’s smile never broke, he was proud of himself, “Kid after kid, drugged, taken and killed. Only if they were alone, only if their parents were awful people. As the man grew old he stopped counting the children, he thought he maybe got a hundred and fifty but he was always bad at math. One day though, the bus was shut down, taken to a junkyard, someone caught on. No matter, the pieces of a junked bus aren’t too expensive, he just needed to make it look convincing, hire a driver, then he could start up all over again.”

  He leaned in and spoke in a lower whisper, “Then, one morning, a young boy who the old man thought had a good Dad came onto the bus all by himself, the old man was furious. So he pricked him with a needle and the boy fell right to sleep. The old man punished the boy as he had punished so many, he broke his arms like twigs, folded them the wrong way until they grinded to a halt. He stomped on the boy’s legs until the femur snapped and jutted through the skin. Finally he took an axe to the boy’s skull. The drugs were good but not good enough to keep someone asleep during all of that. Oh God the boy screamed and screamed, poor thing.”

  He finally stopped reciting his awful, awful tale, “Tell me you’re lying,” I whimpered, “tell me he’s okay.”

  “No.” He shot back, a short dagger right through my chest, “You killed him, you let him go alone.”

  I lunged at him screaming and he stuck his arms in front of his face, my knife slashed through his paper thin skin, he squealed like a girl and screamed to me, “If you kill me nobody will know where their children are buried.”

  I paused, my hand clutching his weak forearm, I thought for a moment and realised how close people had come and were tricked into stopping. He would never tell anyone where they were, he was evil. So I continued to fight, pushing the knife as hard as I could, it pierced his hand and shunted right through to the other side, blood spilled down his sleeve and sloshed out the fabric.

  The bus suddenly took a hard turn and I collapsed, the knife escaped my grip and unstuck itself from Gary’s now disabled palm, clattering across the floor. He desperately tried to grab for it but I caught his legs and yanked him towards me, pushing my hands into his throat, squeezing as hard as I could. 

  “S…stop…the…stop the…” he tried to sputter out to the driver but I kept squeezing and squeezing, his neck skin enveloped my fingers, my tears fell from my cheeks and dripped onto his face.

  A sudden sharp pain stuck into my neck from the side, Gary had slammed a needle into my throat. I reeled back as he pumped the fluid into my body, letting go of his neck. As my vision began to spin and blur, I brought my elbow down on his throat.

  As my elbow collided with his throat I felt something burst, like a water balloon in a leather bag, it crunched ever so softly, his windpipe. I immediately felt warmth fill his throat as it was rushed with blood, foamy red liquid spilled from his lips and trailed down my arm. He gurgled out revolting sounds as he tried to suck in air. The noise crept into my mind like bugs, my stomach churned as I watched him thrash around on the floor before finally going limp.

  I felt woozy, my vision started to fade as I felt the bus come to stop, I collapsed back and my head thunked against the floor.



My eyes flickered open, I was looking to a forest nearby, wet squelching noises were coming from behind me. I sat up slowly, my vision still spun and I vomited into my lap. I turned to face the noise and saw Grant kneeling over Gary, his massive hands enveloping Gary's bruising neck, squishing it, liquid poured from his mouth onto the grass.

  “What are you doing?” I asked, trying to stand but stumbling back down.

  He wiped the ichor from his hands onto his chest leaving streaks of red down his nice white shirt, “I’m helping you.”

  “Why?”

  “I drove this monster around for twenty years, twenty fucking years,” he spat a wad onto Gary’s pale face, “I drove him here, day after day. He promised me my son was okay, that if I just did this he would bring him home.” 

  I clenched my teeth and balled my hands, “You knew for twenty fucking years and did nothing?”

  He nodded, “I’ll confess to everything, including killing him after he drugged you, just need to make the hand marks match.” He tossed my knife into the grass, “Wiped your prints off of it, they’ll only believe it was me. I called the police already.”

  “I hope you die in prison.” I said, my vision swirling. Grant simply nodded in return.

  When the cops arrived they trusted Grant’s story, arresting him and taking me to the hospital. Kayden and I stopped speaking. He knew what I did and never looked at me the same but didn’t blame me for it, just found it hard to be around me. Killing someone changes a person, makes them disconnected. I don't think I've ever recovered. 

  They searched the woods for weeks, finding seventy eight decomposed bodies, all children, all broken and twisted. Some were so mangled and torn up that the gender had to be identified through DNA testing. Local police had mass layoffs, how something this huge wasn’t uncovered was pathetic. They never found Leroy’s body, he’s still out in the woods, warped and rotten. I hope one day someone stumbles across the remaining victims so finally they can come home.

  The drunk never tried to kill me, I saw him once more, lurking a couple blocks away, my son’s note still in his dirty fist. He never stopped smiling. He hanged himself in the woods where the kids were buried. The note flipped and turned into his suicide note, the contents too person to relinquish.

  I've only ever told my wife the truth, called her after I left the hospital. She told me she'd keep the secret but her hatred of me grew deeper, told me that I had a chance to bring Leroy home and I killed the man who would have done it. I hate myself too.



I'll keep searching for your body, I'll only stop when I'm too old to move. I hope me telling your story helps get the word out and I finally get some help.

  I miss you, bud.
