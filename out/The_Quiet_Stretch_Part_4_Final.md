Amidst the chaos and rising tension, sound came at me from all directions at once, colliding and overlapping until it felt physical, like nails being driven into a coffin around my head. Before I could understand where I was or what anyone was saying, my vision buckled inward and I blacked out.

I woke up hours later on cold ground, surrounded by three men in police uniforms. They stood too close, forming a loose circle that felt intentional, as if distance itself was something they didn’t want me to have. None of them spoke at first. They just watched me, waiting, as though whatever was wrong with me might surface on its own if they stayed quiet long enough.

Before a single question was asked, a voice echoed inside my head.
“Hello… sir?”

The familiarity of it made my chest tighten instantly. I knew whose voice it was, knew it without having to think, yet my mind refused to settle on that truth. Other sounds followed immediately...honking, engines revving, metal screaming as it tore against metal. The noise piled up too fast, too dense, as if all the sound I had been denied earlier was being forced back into me at once. My head throbbed like it was being crushed from the inside.

One of the officers leaned forward.
“What do you think you’re doing here?”
I tried to answer. The response formed clearly in my head, but when I opened my mouth, the words came out wrong...uneven and disconnected, like they had taken a longer route than they should have. 

Meanwhile I felt another collision, sharper than the last.
I screamed.

The officers exchanged looks. One of them smirked.

"Huh," he said. "See? He’s playing mad."

Then Martin screamed, Inside me.
It tore through my head, raw and desperate, repeating over and over until I couldn’t tell where it began or ended. I pressed my hands against my ears even though I knew it was useless. The sound wasn’t coming from anywhere my hands could reach.

"I don’t understand", I said. My own voice sounded wrong to me, unfamiliar in my ears. “Please. I don’t know how I got here. I’m not from around here.”

"Indeed, you aren’t", one of them replied flatly. "Your documents don’t belong here. Neither does your truck."
He stepped closer, close enough that I could smell the road on him.

"So you’re going to tell us who you are. Or things get difficult."
I tried to explain. The words were there, but my thoughts kept breaking apart before they could line up properly. Honking filled my head again, the same song and the same pattern. I knew with certainty that if I said any of it out loud, they wouldn’t hear what I meant. They would hear something else. Or worse, they would write it down.

None of it could be proven, so I stayed silent. They made me sign papers I barely understood. My hands moved when they told them to, even though my head felt far away from my body. After that, they locked me up.

During my time in jail, I discovered something that has never left me. I could constantly hear truck engines, sometimes one, sometimes several at once. I heard tires screeching. I heard devastating impacts that rattled my bones even when nothing around me moved. To this day, those collisions stay with me. Most nights, I wake up to them, heart racing, convinced I’ve just survived another crash.

Martin’s voice stayed too.
While he had been sitting beside me in the truck, he hadn’t just been humming. He had been saying things. I understand that now. The sentences were broken, tangled and unfamiliar, but beneath them I could hear him crying... for help. The most haunting thing he ever said to me still repeats without warning:
"Please help… I can’t move on my own."

Eventually, I was allowed to speak with the people responsible for my release. I didn’t tell them the truth, I couldn’t. 

Instead, I told them I’d been kidnapped. That explanation was simple. Believable. The injuries on my body and face helped sell it.
In the end, they took me back.

Now this is a routine. I hear voices no matter where I am. I hear engines, collisions, my own honking repeating endlessly. And sometimes...
"Hello… Sir?"

Every time I hear it, I turn my head without thinking, convinced someone has called my name. The voice is mine, but it sounds wrong, distant, like it belongs to someone else who learned how to speak by listening to echoes.

I’ve completely given up driving. Not just trucks; any vehicle at all. And yet I still feel like a truck driver, because the road never really let go of me. The noises keep the experience alive. I feel like I’m always on the highway: driving, honking, colliding, sitting beside Martin.

Sometimes the real world feels like it’s humming, while the real sounds come from inside me. I hear footsteps when I’m walking at night, and I turn around quickly, even when I know no one will be there.

I still hear about missing truck drivers. Drivers who went to places they were never meant to go.
And I know that only I understand what that costs them.
Now I know I have nothing left but to live with it.
