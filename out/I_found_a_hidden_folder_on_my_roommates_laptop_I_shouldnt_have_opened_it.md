I don’t know how to start this. My hands are shaking so bad I can barely type, and my heart won’t stop hammering in my chest. I haven’t slept in two days. I can’t tell what’s real anymore. But I need to get this out. I need someone to know, just in case.

I live in a small off-campus apartment with my roommate Nate. We’re both computer science majors, so we spend a lot of time online, usually up way too late debugging code and ordering trashy food. Nate’s a quiet guy, friendly enough, but introverted to the point of being a ghost. He’s polite, never really had friends over, kept to himself.

I thought he was just socially awkward.

But a few nights ago, he didn’t come home.

No warning. No text. Nothing.

I figured maybe he crashed at the lab or with someone else, until I went into his room to grab my charger. That’s when I noticed his laptop was still open on his desk.

The screen had gone to sleep, but the faint whir of the fan told me it was still on. I shouldn’t have touched it. But… curiosity. I tapped the space bar.

The desktop lit up, and there it was. A folder on the desktop.

It was titled:  
**g̶̛̬͙͈̲͓̝̣̗̖͐̽͛͑͑̾̓̽̂́́͊̚̕͜h̶̯̐͆̊̂̉̃͠f̴̧̢̳̦̜͇͙͛͂̒́̊̎̆̔͠î̶̡̢̧̥͚̘̟̗͙̘͓̒̆̈̀u̴̡̡̧̥̤̣̦̲̠͍̥̍̆̀̒̉̑͋͂͊͠ĕ̷͚̗͆́̈w̷̧̡̡̖͈̻͓͈͚͕̖̺͙̒͆́͋͆̊͂͗̽̐͆͌b̸̤͍̗͌̓**

It looked corrupted, like the characters weren’t meant to be seen by human eyes. I hovered the cursor over it, and my stomach dropped. The folder was *1.4 terabytes*. It was the only thing on the laptop.

I opened it.

Inside were hundreds of .mp4 files. Each one titled with a timestamp. No names. No labels. Just dates and times. The most recent was from that very morning, 4:32 a.m.

Against my better judgment, I opened it.

It was a video—grainy, like it had been filmed through a cracked lens. The audio buzzed with static, the kind that made my teeth hurt. I almost clicked away, until I recognized the room in the footage.

It was my bedroom.

Me, lying in bed, completely still. The video was shaky, like whoever was holding the camera was breathing heavily. The angle tilted, zooming slowly in on my face.

Then, in the frame, something moved.

From the far corner of the video—something crawled into view. It was thin, naked, wrong. Its limbs were*too long*, its skin was pale and sagging like wet cloth, and its face was a void. No features. Just a smear of darkness. It crept toward the bed—toward *me*—and then stopped.

The camera trembled. Static spiked. Then the thing tilted its head and looked directly into the lens.

The footage cut to black.

I *screamed* and nearly threw the laptop across the room. My skin felt cold, like something was behind me. I turned—nothing.

But now I couldn’t stop. I *had* to know what the hell this was.

I opened another video. Then another. And another.

They were all from different nights. Different rooms. Always filmed in the dead of night. Always someone sleeping. Always the *thing* watching. And always that moment where it turned and stared directly into the lens.

Some videos weren’t just from our apartment. I saw dorm rooms. Public bathrooms. A church. One was filmed from inside someone’s *closet*—you could see the slats in the wood.

Another showed a man waking up and looking directly at the camera. He opened his mouth to scream—and the thing *lunged* at him.

The video ended with a wet gurgling noise.

I slammed the laptop shut and ran to the bathroom to throw up. I was shaking so bad I could barely keep my knees under me.

I tried calling Nate.

No answer.

I texted him:  
**Where are you? What the hell is this on your laptop? Are you okay??**

No response.

That night, I didn’t sleep. I kept all the lights on and locked my bedroom door. But around 3 a.m., the air changed. Do you know what I mean? Like the pressure *shifted*. My ears popped, and it suddenly got *cold*.

Then came the sound.

A wet dragging sound, like someone pulling a soaked blanket across the floor.

Then a tap.  
Tap tap tap.  
On my bedroom door.

I didn’t move. I didn’t *breathe*.

The tapping stopped.

Then—

SCRATCH. SCRATCH. SCRATCH.

I whimpered, curling under the blanket like a child. I don’t know how long it lasted, but eventually the sound stopped.

The next morning, I found the door handle was scratched. Tiny grooves dug into the metal, as if made by *teeth*.

I tried to report Nate missing. The cops didn’t care. He’s an adult. Maybe he just ran off, they said.

But when I went to show them the laptop, it was *gone*.

No trace of the folder. No videos. Just a fresh install of Windows and an empty desktop.

I didn’t imagine it. I know what I saw.

Then… last night, I got an email. No sender. No subject. Just a .mp4 file attached.

The timestamp read:  
Tonight — 3:01 a.m.

I shouldn’t have opened it.

But I did.

It was my room again. But this time, the footage was different. The angle was *higher*, like it was from the ceiling. I was sitting at my desk. Typing.

Writing this post.

The video paused.

Then skipped forward.

I was asleep on my bed.

The camera zoomed in slowly.

The thing was standing over me. Watching. Breathing.

Then… it turned and looked into the lens.

Except this time—

It *smiled*.

There was no cut to black.

The video kept going. The thing crawled onto the bed. Pulled back the blanket.

I *watched myself* bolt upright and scream as it lunged.

The last frame of the video was my face. Twisted. Frozen.

Mouth open.

Screaming.

The email vanished from my inbox after I watched it. I tried calling 911 but my phone just buzzed static. I tried going outside but the hallway just *loops*. Like a video game glitch.

I’m still here. I’m still typing. But I don’t think I’m alone.

The lights are flickering now.

I hear the tapping again.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

It’s at the door.

Please.
