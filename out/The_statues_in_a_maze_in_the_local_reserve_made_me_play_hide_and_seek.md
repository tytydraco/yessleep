Alabaster, made from stone dug up and intricately chiseled and meticulously sanded to form something humanoid in appearance. 

Staring at it's eyes gives you the most earnest definition of purity and tracing your fingers along its wholeness sends multiple shockwaves of recognition that deceived its host and tricked it into believing that it was made from inorganic materials yet it's smoothness tells otherwise, it felt alive to the touch, it's not breathing yet it pulsates, you can feel a subtle amount of resistance by pressing your finger against its surface. 

Posed in a manner any gentlefolk born in the years of a great revolution, crouched and is in the middle of reloading a musket, forever trapped in an action that had happened years ago. 

A clear description lingering in my mind as I walk towards the same path that led me to that awestruckingly eerie archway made up of conifer, reminiscing.


I was with my parents for a small hike as an introduction to the wilderness, everything was well and fine until my father suddenly got a call on his phone, both of them had concerned looks on their faces but despite what's happening though my attention was not focused on my parents troubled looks for there was something that caught it. 

It was a tortoise walking towards a small shrubbery. 

Knowing that curiosity is innate among almost all kids, I followed the said creature not minding small scratches from rushing headfirst into the foliage without protection. 

Not remembering how long I was in the undergrowth, the small hole in what seems to be a lush earthen wall for a kid, lead me to a path parallel to the one where I came from leading up into what seemed to be a small hill but what captured my curiosity  was rundown booth and the green archway made up of conifer beside it, bright green and looked like it was well taken care of, cut and trimmed close to perfection. 

A small clearing separated another collection of conifer hedges. 

The white statue stands between the two entrances, the daylight's rays bouncing upon its smoothened surface. 

Alabaster, intricately chiseled and meticulously sanded, I pressed my fingers on its surface and it felt alive to the touch, it's not breathing but it pulsates, the moment your finger grazes against its surface you can feel a subtle amount of resistance comparable to a velvet felt sheet. 

A good few minutes of close inspection brought no fruition. 

As I was about to turn to leave, I heard a faint rustle and the statue which supposed to be stationary started to creak itself free from its supposed erecting post as if waking up from a deep long slumber and instead of trying to acknowledge my existence, the statue started for the other entrance as if its stalking someone, as the figure vanished in the hedges it was slowly embraced by an indescribable thickness of mist, I stood there in astonishment. 

A child will always be a child, and a wondering child wanders towards the source of its wonder, with an enthusiasm of a child and with a bravery comparable to a hundred men, I followed suit. 

I was led into the verdant maze, what puzzled me the most is that the hedges were broken, what was supposed to be a continous row of green has somewhat melded with elements of a willlow forest that was highly unlikely to happen since we were on a trail where there is a healthy balance of randomness between birches and oaks a concentration of neither of the two is unlikely to happen. 

What's even more confusing was the mist, it was so heavy and I had to feel my way out of the odd amalgamation of conifer and branches of willow with its distinct drooping leaves which acted as a natural curtain. 

More scratches, and the unbearable  itchiness while walking blindly towards the place where the Alabaster man could be, as the sunlight started to dim while going in deeper into the maze with the occasional bumps, unavoidable trips and constant crawling, I saw a faint orange glow in the middle of the sea of mist, that must be the figure I was trying to follow so in haste I gave chase. 

As I was getting close to the source of light there was a strong gust of wind, my eyes automatically reacted to the nature's whisper by closing itself. 

As my vision reappeared, I just noticed that I was at the end of the maze and that it led me to a new place, the abundance of willows both dead and alive seems out of place or was I the one who was lost along this outlandish maze? 


I saw the figure I was looking for but the fear of being found out compelled me to hide behind a large rock that served as a boundary of this maze's end and the entrance to their solemn place of sanctuary. 

It moved closely to another sculpture, now made up of tin, in the same manner as it was back at the entrance but now its not only a musket which it was holding but a lamp and entrapped within the aged and broken glass container was an unnatural glow that looked like it could burn itself for an eternity. 

He moved stealthily to its side and started to whisper, the tin figure buried within an accumulation of ashes and dead foliage due to age started to shake itself awake, the creaks of its metallic body and the steady chime of the lamp it was holding are the only noises you can hear in this peculiar part of the reserve, this excited my young mind, adrenaline is being continously pumped from wherever it came from and gave me the drive to discover more. 

One tin figure started to become two, 
From tin there came bronze, 
From bronze there came copper, 
From copper there came stone, 
From stone there came concrete,
And lastly from concrete there came wood, 

I followed their small excursion in amassing numbers, trying to mask my existence by moving the way they do mimicking their movement yards apart from each other, me a mere spectator and them the object of my amusement, they get a little agitated from the rustles I make because of my missteps. 

My eyes not peeling itself from that white marbled figure. 

That calcite figure led the stealthy march of the assembly of what seemed to be a few hundred men strong, consisted of soldiers with differing sizes and features and made up of different varying materials. 

He led the band into what seemed to be their final act. The clearing up ahead was illuminated by the full moon and the wind gently breezed into the meadows filled with random ditches and potholes filled with water, surrounded by the drooping leaves of the willows. 

They formed into a column together with their own belongings and arsenal, that one outstanding figure among them shined even more as the light from the moon hit its entirety, it started what seemed to be a speech though inaudible I could faintly understand that it was meant to boost the groups morale and ensure that they perform their utmost and fulfill their sworn duties even at the cost of everything that they are and had. 

I watched them from behind a sturdy looking tree, careful not to disturb what was about to happen, cold sweat was greeted by the gentle caress of an oddly southern wind, making my body shudder, the clothes almost clung to my body because of an obscure dampness. 

While lurking in the shadows, I was shocked by the loud blares from horns that broke the silence lingering in the air and drove the winds away from the plain. 

Turning the field into one painted picture 

The Alabaster figure screamed three times, still inaudible but just as his mouth was halfway into mouthing its third word, screams from an incomprehensible language filled the other side of the plains coming from the rows of willows, and out came the charging figures carrying the same armaments yet looked more vicious yet so organized in formation, their humanoid figures were composed of decomposing organic matter, their weapons looked more formidable yet the brave statues stood there unfazed. 

And then in one broken charge from the hundred figures the two opposing forces clashed in the middle of the field, the plains that was silent moments ago, what was once torn by screams of retribution was then mended by a sudden burst of vengeful bloodthirst that came from a gradual burgeoning of years of unexposed hatred, guilt and shame from both parties. 

Explosions! 

The dirt flying around from ammunitions whirring around the battlefield, the figures struggled with each other hitting enemies with their rifles, stabbing each other with blades and bayonets. 

Their muskets never tasted rest for it never needed reloading, units being hit crumbled to the ground, a scene of a huge massacre was being unfolded right before my eyes, limbs flew around. 

Blood spurted from their inorganic bodies but pain never seem to translate into their faces, 

no evidence of emotions they all have the
same affixed expressions in their faces. 

They stood up to fight again with the same vigor at the very start, never tiring, never stopping, upper torsos crawled to grab a standing opponents' feet trying to hinder an enemy from gaining the upper hand, 

Assisting a comrade from the very edges of the grave, 

The stench of gunpowder, smoke and the metallic smell of putrid blood permeated in the air, 

They tore at each other, no one stopped until their bodies were both mangled and strewn along the once peaceful plains. 

I could taste and experience it as I crouch there watching enthralled at the macabre exhibition from whatever force of nature or anything beyond reason and logic caused the phenomenal phenomenon. 

But one thing is for sure, 

I enjoyed each and every single part of the phantasmagoric reenacment of an event I never even bothered to look into. 

Giving in into the innate feeling of wanting to see destruction, I walked into the battlefield that turned into a ceremonial heroic grave which looked rather foolish for they engaged in an exchange of entrails without the proper reason to do so. 

The last thing I remembered after I inspected the scene of genocidal suicide, was picking up a bullet, one half of it was lead and the other was alabaster. 

I awoke in the lodging house at the foot of the trail, my body was littered with small band aids. 

According to my parents accounts, I was found lying in a ditch a few yards from where I was last seen, I was lost for a period of sixteen hours, close to being considered missing. 

No one knew about what I witnessed aside from my parents, their verdict was that it was a dream of mine while shivering in the damp environment for a whole night. 

I know for sure that it wasn't a dream nor a hallucination though, for right now in my possession is the same lead and alabaster bullet held tightly in my left hand as I traverse the trail towards the same exact place, in the same exact day, and the same exact time. 

I was humming a tune and in the back of my mind was it's strangely pertaining poetry 

"Years passed by and I tried to find it's hidden entrance to play one last game but to no avail there was not a trace of the unkempt conifer maze nor the guardian safeguarding in the middle of the haze. How I wish I could play that one last tag to try and catch a final glimpse of it's eerie sneak. To escape yet again in that place where refuge is so dearly after sought..." 

The same exact march sung in hushed tones of the brave bicarbonate brigade as they lead themselves into heroic idiocy.
