I hate EVERYTHING right now. D is a puddle in a fishbowl, I just trafficked two people, and Aeshma is no longer my worst nightmare.

Assignment 24, Day 1, 6:04pm

"I'll take over," D offered, half shoving me out of the way.

"Great. Now I can find the quickest way outta the country " I grumbled to myself, flopping onto the mattress.

I was suddenly thrown into the side of the truck, the vehicle losing control.

"Oi!" I yelped, catching my breath. "What's going on-?" I pulled myself to the front, heart skipping a beat at what I saw.

"Take the wheel," my reflection ordered, snapping me back to reality.

"D? C'mon, this isn't funny," I nudged their shoulder, swallowing dryly as their body liquefied into a gooey, clay-like substance.

"Take the wheel," my reflection repeated.

So I did. The seat squelched as I sat, then lurched as something slammed from the left.

"Crazy mother trucker!" I barked, rolling down my window.

I know, I know, it's drastic, but I drew my pistol and fired.

I swear, it was supposed to be a warning shot. Instead, the bullet shattered their window… and my heart plummeted.

"Hey," the crimson skinned demon huffed, spitting the bullet out and spreading that terrible, toothy grin from ear to ear.

"Drive!" My reflection screamed. Absentmindedly, I stomped the gas.

Aeshma veered to the right, slamming into me. My hands blistered with how tight I held the wheel.

"Incoming call from Simon," the truck droned. Muscle memory caused me to accept the call.

"Cici, what's up? I see you're all over the place."

"Not now!" I growled, punching the hang up button.

"My feelings," Simon feigned offense with poor acting. "What's with that prototype, is it mucking things up?"

"I really don't have time right now!" I pressed, grinding my teeth as Aeshma rammed me again.

I entered a level of dread and terror English fails to describe at what I heard next.

"Pull over. It's out of my hands."

The line went dead. *Just like me, at this rate.*

Pulling over, I watched with bated breath as Aeshma did likewise. I shut my eyes, not willing to look death in the face.

Strangely, I heard two doors slam shut. Stranger, they were both behind me. *Aeshma parked in front of me, so what's going on?*

"Open the trunk," a stern woman demanded.

Cautiously opening my eyes, I made a double take.

The woman stood at 5" 9, a gnarly scar through her left eye. The disgusting smile stretched across her lips was ten times more unsettling than Aeshma's could ever be.

Speaking of Aeshma, the crimson demon knelt behind the woman. A tight lipped grimace spread across his face, finally hiding those terrible fangs for the first time.

"We have need of your services. Open the trunk, or Aeshma will be the least of your fears." The woman drew a jade dagger, six or seven inches long. She slid the shimmering green blade across her tongue, leaving a nasty gash.

Aeshma visibly cringed. I was too frozen to react.

The woman flicked the blade, speckling the window with blood. I flinched.

"Open the trunk. Now." She growled in a way feral animals would lose their nerve from.

"Just do it," my reflection said sadly.

So I did. The two paced behind me, her knife tracing my spine.

Inserting the key into the lock, it didn't budge.

"Uh…?" I grunted, feeling Aeshma pounce within an inch of me. His rancid, coppery breath began charring the back of my neck.

"Here, take it," Aeshma grunted, nearly stabbing a key into the back of my hand.

Removing the first key and inserting the second, the lock opened.

The woman impatiently threw the door up… revealing nothing. Nothing!

Aeshma let out a sigh of relief and the woman made a self satisfied "hmph!"

I grunted a confused "huh?"

"This isn't your truck. You thought it was, but I switched with you when we parked." Aeshma explained quickly, then yelped.

The one eyed woman slashed her knife across his crimson back, scowling as he fell to his hands and knees. "I did not permit you to speak."

His blood blended with the color of his skin, the only difference was the glimmering sheen of his life essence.

All color drained from my face. *This woman ordered around that demon, and now she did this?! I'm fucked!*

"Quit gawking. And get up," she kicked Aeshma, who got up on unsteady legs. "Fetch them."

Aeshma wobbled as he walked to the cabin. He returned with two unconscious people, one over either shoulder. He promptly tossed the bodies into the empty trunk, then slammed it shut.

"You may go," the woman dismissed with a wave. Aeshma promptly vanished, a pool of blood all that remained.

"Now, where was it?" The woman began fumbling through her two pockets, searching for… something?

*She has her knife. What is she looking for?*

I shit you not, the woman groaned, then slashed at her pockets. Two deep wounds quickly stained her pants, as her overstuffed pockets spilled on the ground.

I stumbled half a step back at the revolting display, praying that this would be quick.

Instead, she sifted through the pooling blood. All her moving around kept the wounds fresh and open. After half a minute, she withdrew a red-white clump of paper. She uncrumpled it, then forced it into my hand.

The bloodied napkin had an address and instructions on it.

"Drop those two off. Then you're free." The woman gave me one more unsettling grin, then added, "oh, right." She walked behind my truck, returning with a fishbowl. "For your… companion? That thing I killed in your truck. Scoop it up into this."

So I scooped D into the fishbowl, grabbed some of my weapons, and drove off in the other truck. The woman took my truck, disappearing the opposite direction.

I entered the address and was on my way.

—

I turned onto a gravel path, a poor excuse for a road. Crunching over pebbles and dirt, the woods thickened around me.

"Almost done," my reflection said, the same thing she'd said every mile.

Clenching my teeth and the steering wheel tight, I let out a long, incredibly infuriated sigh.

A horn honked from behind me. In the rearview I expected some sort of lost soul hoping to get directions. Instead, that crazy lady held an air horn out like Simba in the Lion King.

Slowing to a stop, I rolled down my window. I wanted this shitshow over with as soon as humanly, or inhumanly, possible.

"Pop the trunk and walk them through the woods until you find it," the woman ordered, crushing the air horn in her hand. 

Holding my breath, I obeyed.

The two bodies didn't even struggle. They mechanically followed behind me, taking calculated steps in unison.

Each snapped branch or rustling of leaves made me jump. I kept waiting for that maniac to lunge out at me, to finish me off.

*Surely I won't be walking away from this?*

We entered a massive clearing, rubble and broken structures scattered like a tornado tore through.

"Cadsberry Clearing" was written on the *now entering* sign, though it was fairly difficult to make out.

The only structure that still stood was a single subway entrance. Just on the far end of the clearing, the pristine white cement building sat. It matched the poorly drawn sketch I'd been handed, so I led the two to the mouth.

As I released their hands, the taller one stumbled into me slightly. Caught off guard and too exhausted to care, I ignored the obvious pickpocket tactic. My keys were in the other pocket anyways, and I didn't mind parting with that swiss army knife.

When I returned from the thicket, I found a truck facing away from me. I didn't even question how, when, nor why the trucks were swapped, but the body bag of guns was definitely mine.

I was back in my truck, and on the opposite side of the country from where I was headed. 

I sat D's bowl on the passenger seat, typed this up, and now I'm heading to bed. Fuck everything.
