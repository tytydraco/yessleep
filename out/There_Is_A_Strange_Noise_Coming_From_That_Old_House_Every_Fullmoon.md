In a small town in the northern part of the country, there is a legend about an old house nestled deep within the forest.

This house once belonged to a farming family, which included a young woman named Elizabeth. She was the only daughter of the family and was dearly loved by everyone.

One night, under a full moon, Elizabeth disappeared without a trace. Her family and the townspeople searched everywhere but could not find her. Eventually, her body was discovered in the forest near the house, left in a horrific state. Her eyes were blood-red, and her face was pale. The cause of Elizabeth's death remains a mystery, and shortly after, her family moved out of the house without anyone knowing why.

Since then, on every full moon night, the villagers hear whispers and cries for help coming from the old house. But no one dares to investigate, believing that Elizabeth's spirit is still trapped there, seeking help.





Tonight, the full moon illuminates the forest. The wind rustles through the leaves, creating a chilling and silent atmosphere. Anna ventures into the forest, seeking the hidden secrets mentioned by the villagers about the strange occurrences at the old house tonight.

A few steps in, Anna hears whispers coming from an indeterminate source. The voice sounds like someone in distress, "Help me... Someone, please help me..." Anna looks around but finds no one.

Following the voice deeper into the forest, she comes upon the old house, appearing long abandoned. The door is locked from the inside, but the whispering continues from within. Anna decides to find a way inside by climbing through a window into the dusty, cobweb-filled house.

Inside, the silence is so profound that Anna can hear her own heartbeat. As she reaches the central room, the whispers grow louder and closer, "Here... help me." Anna freezes when she sees a shadow in the corner of the room.

The shadow forms into the shape of a young woman with a pale face and blood-red eyes. She stands smiling a chilling smile. "Thank you for coming to help me," she whispers. "But now... I want you to stay with me... forever."

Anna tries to run, but all the doors are blocked. She is trapped inside the old house with the shadow she cannot escape from, and the whispers echo endlessly in her mind.

The last thing Anna hears is her own voice becoming one of the tormented whispers in the house. On the next full moon night, the old house still waits for a new victim to add to its chorus of eerie whispers.





Years passed, and the story of the old house became a legend among the villagers. On every full moon night, whispers would emerge from the forest, heard by many but investigated by none.

Until one night, a young man named David decided to uncover the truth. He prepared himself and entered the silent forest. As he reached the old house, the whispers began, just as Anna had heard.

"Help me... Someone, please help me..." David looked around but saw no one. He shone his flashlight into the corners of the room, but everything appeared empty and frightening.

Suddenly, the shadow in the corner began to move, forming into the shape of a young woman just like the legend. "Thank you for coming to help me," the whispering voice said again. "But now... I want you to stay with me... forever."

David tried to run, but the doors and windows were all blocked. He was trapped in the old house with the approaching shadow. His heart raced, and sweat trickled down his forehead.

He noticed a mirror in the room and, looking into it, saw his own reflection in outdated clothes with a pale face like the shadow. "What is happening?" David murmured to himself.

The young woman in the shadow approached and said, "You have always been a part of me, David. We were here together... Don't you remember?"



Suddenly, David's memories returned. He was Elizabeth's lover who had died that night. The true horror struck him when he realized he had killed Elizabeth in a fit of anger and jealousy upon discovering she planned to run away with someone else.

"No... This can't be true!" David shouted, but the mirror reflected a truth he could not deny.

The young woman reached out and held David's hand before embracing him and whispering in his ear, "You must take responsibility for what you did, David."

Her voice was so cold it made David shiver. "Why... Why did I have to kill her?" he sobbed uncontrollably.

"Because of love, David. But your love turned into hatred," the young woman whispered. "You couldn't let me be happy with someone else."

In that instant, David understood he had never escaped the house. His spirit had been trapped there since that night, living in a cycle of guilt and torment, unaware of his fate.



The last sound he heard before everything turned dark again was a whisper, "Welcome back home, my love."
