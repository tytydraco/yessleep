I lived in a small town in the northern part of the country, there is a legend about an old house nestled deep within the forest. This house once belonged to a farming family, which included a young woman named Elizabeth. She was the only daughter of the family and was dearly loved by everyone.

 

One night, under a full moon, Elizabeth disappeared without a trace. Her family and the townspeople searched everywhere but could not find her. Eventually, her body was discovered in the forest near the house, left in a horrific state. Her eyes were blood-red, and her face was pale. The cause of Elizabeth's death remains a mystery, and shortly after, her family moved out of the house without anyone knowing why.

 

Since then, on every full moon night, the villagers hear whispers and cries for help coming from the old house. But no one dares to investigate, believing that Elizabeth's spirit is still trapped there, seeking help.

 

 

Years passed, and the story of the old house became a legend among the villagers. On every full moon night, whispers would emerge from the forest, heard by many but investigated by none.

 

One evening, while I’m at a local tavern, I heard another part of the legend that piqued my curiosity. An old man, sitting in the corner, recounted the tale of a woman named Anna who had gone into the forest to uncover the truth.

"They say she heard the whispers and went inside the house," the old man said, his voice barely a whisper itself.

That night, the full moon illuminates the forest. The wind rustles through the leaves, creating a chilling and silent atmosphere.

Anna ventures into the forest, seeking the hidden secrets mentioned by the villagers about the strange occurrences at the old house tonight. A few steps in, Anna hears whispers coming from an indeterminate source.

The voice sounds like someone in distress, "Help me... Someone, please help me..." Anna looks around but finds no one. Following the voice deeper into the forest, she comes upon the old house, appearing long abandoned.

The door is locked from the inside, but the whispering continues from within. Anna decides to find a way inside by climbing through a window into the dusty, cobweb-filled house. Inside, the silence is so profound that Anna can hear her own heartbeat. As she reaches the central room, the whispers grow louder and closer, "Here... help me." Anna freezes when she sees a shadow in the corner of the room.

The shadow forms into the shape of a young woman with a pale face and blood-red eyes. She stands smiling a chilling smile. "Thank you for coming to help me," she whispers. "But now... I want you to stay with me... forever." Anna tries to run, but all the doors are blocked.

She is trapped inside the old house with the shadow she cannot escape from, and the whispers echo endlessly in her mind. The last thing Anna hears is her own voice becoming one of the tormented whispers in the house.

"Anna was never seen again, but some say her voice joined the whispers on those eerie nights."

 This tale haunted me. It was said Anna had ventured into the forest during a full moon night, driven by the same curiosity that now gnawed at me. According to the villagers, Anna had heard the whispers and followed them to the old house. She climbed through a window into the dusty, cobweb-filled house, only to disappear like Elizabeth.

 

Until one night, I decided to uncover the truth for myself. My name is David, and I was determined to find out what really happened. I prepared myself and entered the silent forest. As I reached the old house, the whispers began, just as the legends described.

 

"Help me... Someone, please help me..." I looked around but saw no one. I shone my flashlight into the corners of the room, but everything appeared empty and frightening.

 

Suddenly, the shadow in the corner began to move, forming into the shape of a young woman just like the legend. "Thank you for coming to help me," the whispering voice said again. "But now... I want you to stay with me... forever."

 

I tried to run, but the doors and windows were all blocked. I was trapped in the old house with the approaching shadow. My heart raced, and sweat trickled down my forehead.

 

I noticed a mirror in the room and, looking into it, saw my own reflection in outdated clothes with an unknown pale face like the shadow. "What is happening?" I murmured to myself.

 

The young woman in the shadow approached and said, "You have always been a part of me, David. We were here together... Don't you remember?"

 

Suddenly, Someone's memories enters my mind. The man i saw in a reflection was Elizabeth's lover who had died that night. The true horror struck me when I realized that he was the one who had killed Elizabeth in a fit of anger and jealousy upon discovering she planned to run away with someone else.

 

"No... This can't be true!, I'm not your David!" I shouted, but the mirror reflected a truth I could not deny.

 

The young woman reached out and held my hand before embracing me and whispering in my ear, 

"You must take responsibility for what you did, David."

 Her voice was so cold it made me shiver. 

"Look, i'm not your David. But Why... Why did he have to kill you?" I sobbed uncontrollably.

 

"Because of love, David. But your love turned into hatred," the young woman whispered. "You couldn't let me be happy with someone else."

 

In that instant, I understood that her David had never escaped the house. his spirit had been trapped there since that night, living in a cycle of guilt and torment, unaware of his fate.



But now, he has found a way to escape from this eternal torment, which is by possesing me and walk right out.



Before David in my body could do anything, Elizabeth came toward us with an incredibly speed.  



The last sound I heard before everything turned dark again was a whisper, "Welcome back home, my love."



  
I awoke with a start, my heart pounding in my chest. I was lying on the cold, dusty floor of the old house. Panic gripped me as I tried to remember what had happened. Had it all been a dream? The details were vivid, the fear real, but I couldn't shake the feeling that it was just my mind playing tricks on me.

I stumbled out of the house and made my way back home, the eerie whispers still echoing in my ears. I tried to convince myself it was just my imagination, fueled by the terrifying stories and the haunting atmosphere of the house.

But when I returned home, something strange began to happen. Every night, just as I was about to drift off to sleep, I would hear faint whispers. "Help me... Someone, please help me..." The same words that had lured me into the forest now haunted my own home.

At first, I tried to ignore them, thinking they would go away. But the whispers grew louder each night, becoming more insistent and desperate. It felt as though the spirits from the old house had followed me, seeking something I couldn't give.

I was living in a nightmare, unable to escape the whispers that now filled my home. The boundary between dream and reality blurred, and I found myself questioning my sanity. The legend of Elizabeth, Anna, and the old house had ensnared me, and there was no escape from the voices that haunted my nights.

In the end, I realized that some stories are better left untold and some secrets are best left buried. The old house in the forest still stands, a silent witness to the horrors it conceals, waiting for the next curious soul to fall victim to its whispers. And I, forever marked by the curse, could only wait for the whispers to claim me, too. 

i don't know how long i can live with these whispers. So please, "Help me... Someone, please help me..."
