Living on the couch now. Permanent resident. Day… eleven? Twelve? Time’s gone slurry, viscous, unreliable. Measured in lukewarm instant coffee and my heart trying to beat its way out. Haven't set foot inside the bedroom since the hall mirror… performed its silent, breathless autopsy. Door stays shut, chair wedged tightly under the knob. Pathetic, useless defense. Doesn’t matter anyway. The feeling of being watched is a constant, clammy, suffocating pressure, leaking like toxic gas from every potentially reflective surface. Laptop screen when dark, phone glass between obsessive scrolls, window panes slick with grime, the greasy curve of a spoon in the sink. Caught a sickening ripple, like heat haze but emanating palpable cold, distort the reflection on the chrome kettle yesterday when I walked past quickly, eyes averted. It can use anything. Anywhere it can see me. Any surface holding even a ghost of my image.



The exhaustion is a physical illness now, a deep, grinding ache in my bones, a persistent, nauseating buzz behind my eyes. Hands shake so badly I spilled coffee again this morning – ugly brown Rorschach patterns on the worn floorboards. Thoughts feel… slippery, fragmented, like trying to hold wet soap. Keep zoning out, staring blankly at the wall, coming back with a jolt, unsure what I meant to do. Short-term memory feels full of holes. Did I really leave the milk out again? Found it warm, slightly sour. Did I imagine hearing that sharp floorboard creak right behind me washing dishes, spinning around to find nothing? The doubt is a separate, insidious horror, a fifth column whispering maybe it's just you breaking down. Maybe Maya was right.



But then the cold numbness flares up unpredictably on my left arm – the exact spot where I felt that impossible icy pressure slide across my skin. Not constant, maybe a few times a day, a phantom chill distinct from the apartment’s damp coldness, making fine hairs stand rigidly on end like static charge. A visceral, physical anchor screaming That was real. This is real. Something touched me.



Tried covering the hallway mirror again. Brown kraft paper, half a roll of duct tape. Felt absurdly like warding off vampires with garlic. Stood with my back pressed hard against the opposite wall, didn’t look as I fumbled awkwardly, breath catching shallowly. Ripped it all down less than an hour later in a fresh wave of suffocating panic. The feeling of focused observation hadn’t lessened; it just felt intensely concentrated behind the paper, pressing outwards palpably, more intense and menacing for being unseen. Utterly pointless. It’s not in the mirror. The mirror is just… porous. A weak spot where it looks through. Or maybe, eventually, pushes through.



Started noticing the breathing again. Or maybe hearing it more clearly through the fear-fog. Late at night, city quieted to a low hum, sometimes I hear it clearly. A faint, slow, wet inhalation… followed by a long, sighing exhalation that seems to stir the dust motes, carrying a faint but distinct whiff of that sharp metallic/ozone smell, maybe with burnt hair underneath now. Makes me gag sometimes. Doesn't seem to come from one specific place, more like… the heating vents? Spaces between crumbling plaster walls? Seems subtly timed with unnatural shifts in temperature, pockets of cold air pulsing faintly with the ‘out-breath’. Like the building itself is harnessed as a lung by something parasitic. Using its decay. Maybe that smell near the fuse box is its… respiration? Waste? God, the thoughts feel contaminated, spiraling.



Searched online again, compulsively, hopelessly. Gave up 'mirror ghosts'. Too simple. Focused on the address, building history, old maps, local historical society archives – anything about the ground itself. Hours lost scrolling faded scans, eyes aching under the laptop glare. Found fragmented references. This specific area called "Cinder Marsh" or morbidly "Wicklow's Mire" before the city sprawled over it. Unpopular plot. Swampy ground that 'resisted' early drainage attempts according to a dry 1910 engineering report – mentioned inexplicable equipment failures, tool breakages, persistent worker unease bordering on mutiny. Found that chilling snippet again, scanned local newspaper, 1892 – small family homestead near the marsh edge found abruptly abandoned. Doors banging open, half-eaten meal rotting on the table, occupants vanished without trace. Article quoted a frightened neighbor mentioning the family plagued by "ill-luck, strange reflections seen in the marsh water even on cloudy days, and deeply unsettling mimicry heard in the calls of the night birds." Nothing concrete. Just faint whispers across a century of bad ground. A sense of the place itself being inherently wrong. Predatory?



The scraping sound came back last night. Against the living room window, slick with cold rain. Louder this time. Sharper. Definitely not fingernails, not branches. More like… shards of rock, or maybe dry, sharp bone, being dragged deliberately, rhythmically across the glass? Scrrreee… pause… skriiiitch… Set my teeth painfully on edge, vibrated deep in my jawbone. Followed by that faint, wet clicking sound again, seemingly coming right off the shivering glass pane itself. Click… click-click… Like something tasting the barrier. Testing its strength. Lasted almost two minutes, an eternity of frozen listening. Sat rigid on the couch, hands balled into white-knuckled fists, sweat trickling cold down my back, until blessed, heavy, watchful silence fell again.



Object manipulation feels less random now, more… pointedly intrusive. Came back from the bathroom this morning (rapid, eyes-half-closed ordeal) to find my laptop, left closed on the coffee table, now sitting wide open. Screen dark. But sitting squarely on the center of the keyboard, draped over the 'H' key? A single long, dark strand of human hair. Definitely not mine – mine’s light brown, shedding from stress anyway. Whose was it? Felt like a trophy deliberately left behind. Or a territorial marking. Claiming my space, my tools.



Reflection glitches are rare now, almost nonexistent, because the baseline mimicry is so terrifyingly, flawlessly perfect. But when they happen, they’re more disturbing. Caught my reflection in the microwave door glass waiting for water for yet another cup of awful coffee. Just for a split second, the reflection's eyes flickered sideways, unmistakably, towards the butcher block holding my kitchen knives beside the microwave. Head tilted slightly. Lingered. Like thinking about them. Before snapping back instantly to meet my own startled gaze. It wasn't mirroring me; I was staring straight ahead. It was looking independently. Assessing. At the knives. My stomach plummeted, cold and heavy as lead.



It’s learning faster. Interacting more deliberately. Sounds, moved objects, the intimate violation of the hair, the independent, assessing glances… feels like it’s consolidating its presence, pushing outwards from the reflections into the physical space. Into my space. Maybe testing what it can affect. Preparing for something more direct.



Tried the landlord again. Voice shaking, trying desperately to sound rational. Mentioned scraping ("Maybe rats? Big ones?"), moved objects (framed carefully as intruder concerns, knowing it sounded insane), cold drafts, electrical smell. He sighed, that world-weary landlord sigh. "Look," he said, patience worn thin, "it's an old building. Makes noises. Maybe get some thicker curtains? Put out some traps yourself if you really think it's rats. I'll send Gary the handyman again next week if you absolutely insist, but honestly, he won't find anything new." Pointless. Utterly, terrifyingly pointless. Nobody is coming. Nobody believes me. I am entirely alone with this.



The apartment doesn’t feel like my space anymore. It feels occupied. Infiltrated. Like its territory now, and I’m the increasingly inconvenient, maybe interesting, maybe edible, infestation it's patiently studying. Everything feels subtly contaminated. Light feels wrong, too harsh or too dim. Shadows pool in corners with unnatural, watching depth. That metallic tang seems ever-present, coating the back of my throat, a taste I can't wash away. Am I imagining the intensification? Hyper-vigilance feeding paranoia? Breakdown accelerating?



Or is it really learning? Adapting? Moving from watching and mimicking to… affecting? Preparing for the next stage?



The worst part is the constant, gnawing waiting. Knowing the next escalation is coming. Feeling that heavy, listening silence descend, hearing that chitinous scrape on the glass like claws testing the boundary, catching a reflection that isn't quite right for a horrifying split second before the mask snaps flawlessly back into place… and wondering when it will stop pretending altogether. Wondering when the mask will finally drop for good, and what nightmare I’ll see staring back at me from my own eyes.
