""I'm going out dad, I'll be out for a while, don't bother coming to find me." I say to my father who's passed out in the recliner with beer bottles all over the floor and his lap.
I then make my way to the back door with nothing but my phone, wallet, a half dead flashlight, and a notebook, I wish I had brought more, I need more I'm suffering a slow agonizing death, one of psychological torture, just a big mind fuck I guess, if you find this note it's too late, it found me."

What the actual hell..? How am I just now finding this 10 years later? Its was laying in the edge of the forest, anyone could spot it if you looked hard enough, no no, not even that hard, if they just would have fucking look over they could have found him, we could have saved him.. we.. we could have saved willium, my best friend.. Im going to do something about this myself, since these dimwits won't. I don't care if I put my life in the line, I need to know what happened. I'll avenge you Will. 

After I found the note I sprinted back to my house to gather supplies. Phone, wallet,flashlight...

I then remember the note..

I need more than this. I hurl myself down the stairs to grab a back pack. After maybe 30 minutes of searching, I find one I deem large enough. I fling myself up the stairs once again.

Phone, wallet,flashlight, clothes, snacks, a couple water bottles, I think that's enough. I hope-

Then I make my final choice, I write a note to whomever comes to my house next

"I'm sorry to say, but I'm unfortunately not home, I doubt I'll ever come home, I'm out searching for the man all of you were too lazy to take the time to look for,shame on every last one of y'all, I hope all of you, the people of Hawkhorn, have karma bite you right in the ass. And I hope it stings like the devil."

That's when I taped it to my front door and headed towards my dreaded destination. The forest.

I walk outside to see the sun setting, I should have left sooner, oh well, if I have to be out all night I will, i hated this town anyway, the forces are corrupt and the people don't care about anyone. The only man who cared was willium, and I want the town to remember his name, remember him for the great man he was, and if I have to give my life for it, that's what I'll have to do.

I then set out into the town that was once so carefree and happy, it's now so gloomy and dark. Once I pass the mall I find the forest, it's eyes staring into my soul, it's teeth ready to rip my flesh apart and drive me mad, I take my first step in, it's cold. It's summer, why is it cold? The sun is beaming down on me like a massive lamp. Sweat rolls down my forehead, I don't know if it was from the blistering heat, or from my worry. 

leaves rustle ahead of Danyel with a flash of dark light

What the hell was that? I must be going insane, there shouldn't be anything runnin' round in here. It's not suitable for animals, there's not water or nothin'. There's so sign of anything being here, wait, no, their are claw marks on a couple trees, they look to be human tho- willium? No, he kept his nails trimmed,  plus, how could human nails deal that much damage to a tree, especially a tree this thick.. Human like nails.. monster type strength... demon?
Shocking, "monsters" aren't real- I mean, killers and stuff like that, those are monsters, but I mean like demons and that kinda crap. Whatever, that's not the point, I need to find what happened to willium all those years ago. 

hours pass by of Danyel just wondering around, he's starting to have a shortage of breath

*panting* holy shit, I knew this forest was deep but I didn't know it was this deep..
I need to carry on, nows too early to stop, I can handle another few miles without wa..

*leaves crunch with a heavy silence following, and i pull my pocket knife off of my belt*

swinging it open i glare around me, "Who's there!  tell me who you are you..." something grabs me by my hood, what grabbed me couldn't be human tho, it's as if one hundred tons were pushing me down. I fall flat on my back, my head nearly hitting a rock, my knife still secure in my hand, but the blade is dug into the dirt, lucky me I guess. I sit up and glance back, there's nothing but kicked up dirt. Pulling my knife out of the dirt was like trying to pull Excalibur out of the stone, i got it out tho, blade dirty and the very tip snapped off, that's better than not having a knife tho. He just can't stab anyone anymore, which isn't a big deal anyways, he can always just slash at whatever this thing is, with it.

*leaves crunch as something moves by*

*Danyel spins around, heart in this throat,knife in his hand, he looks down to notice that it's only a baby raccoon* 

"Oh, hi buddy," he lays his hand down on its jagged fur, "you startled me."

*The raccoon hisses at him but just runs away*

Danyel stands up, heart still racing, but he's reassured by the sounds of the wind singing that he's safe. Then it hits him, the reason he's here, Willium. But willium isn’t real, he never was real.
