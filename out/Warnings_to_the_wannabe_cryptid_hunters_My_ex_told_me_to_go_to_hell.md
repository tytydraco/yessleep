Telling Jacek the story of my mother's death was exceptionally painful but turned out to be a pretty good decision. He said that he'd go get the dog after we'd finished our talk. I made him wait until I'd texted my employees that there'd be a man dressed in all black walking around in the woods today, and not to stop him. The older ones, namely José and Gus, still remembered the dark miller, so I actually got replies from them asking if he was back to stay now. Casimir and I stayed in the comfort of the house, busying ourselves with negligible chores and planning until he returned. 

"Incoming," Cas announced upon glancing out the window. 

I stepped out onto the porch to find Jacek crossing the red meadow. Jumping around him was the big black dog, nuzzling him and drooling everywhere. It sat down in front of the porch, waiting politely as the miller walked up to us. 

"Here's my plan," he began, raking a hand through slobbered-on hair. "Steal something from this Tom Hayes-person. Anything. Can be a hat, a couple hairs, a goddamn shoelace; whatever. You give that to me and Licorice will do the rest."

"Licorice," I echoed. "Right, *that* was his name."

Casimir shuddered as he threw a glance at the creature happily rolling around in the snow. "Why would you give your creepy-ass zombie dog such a cute name? That's just kinda jarring, no?"

"Well, Casimir Novak, it just so happens to be *my* creepy-ass zombie dog and I can name it whatever I want," Jacek replied with an easy chuckle. "Also, a little more respect—he's a good boy. He's gonna save your sorry butts. Hellhounds are *made* to rally stray souls."

I wasn't entirely sure where he was going with this, but it seemed that he wasn't quite done with his instructions either. "Once this Tom Hayes has no leverage anymore, you can fire him, or kill him, I'll leave that up to you. Your problem's bigger than him, though, isn't it. You need to cover this whole thing up again. Maybe we should take care of that first."

I nodded, watching as Jacek started chewing on his lower lip in thought. 

"I have a possible solution. At least a temporary one until it's all blown over and people start forgetting about you again," he said. "But you won't like it."

I told him I was open for anything, and he smiled. "That's good. So, do you think you trust me enough to do something… intense?"

"Intense, how?"

His grin widened. "Going to hell."

Cas and I simply stared at him for a couple seconds. He stared back, inkwell eyes sparkling. My little brother took a swift step back, raising his hands. "Nope. Sorry, buddy, not happening. Take my sister. She's into that sort of thing, but I'm, like, not."

"Come on, it's awesome down there! You'll love—"

"Nope! I'm not going. Fiona gets horny when she's scared, she'll have a hell of a time, but I'd prefer to keep my head on my shoulders."

I stepped on his foot, hard. "I told you that in confidence," I hissed. "Just sometimes," I corrected, addressing my ex.

"You people are sick," Jacek said cheerfully. "So, Fiona, this is about *your* land. What'll it be?"

"Oh, I'm doing this," I confirmed. "But—purely historically speaking—I know you like sending me into things blindfolded. So what exactly is our plan here?"

"What's it matter?" Jacek drawled, reaching into his pocket to pull out a pack of cigarettes. He placed one between his lips, then snapped his fingers a few times until a tiny flame appeared, hovering above his knuckles—he used it to light his smoke. "You only have to convince a friend of mine that your woods are worth protecting. You'd go to that length to save your forest, right?" he mumbled, not fully opening his mouth so the cigarette wouldn't fall out.

"I didn't know you started smoking," I pressed out, hurriedly tearing my eyes from his lips when he looked up.

"Dreadful habit, isn't it. Aren't you gonna ask about the fire-thing?"

"I was gonna, I just needed a segue."

"Good segue." Jacek smiled. "Did you know that in hell, you can make deals with just about anything? Even the fire. I promised that I'd use it for *a lot* of destruction, and that I'd cause all the pain with it it could ever wish for. So it's inside of me now."

I stared at him in silence for a moment, swallowing the lump in my throat. "I need to talk to my brother for a sec," I finally gritted out, shoving Cas inside and leaving Jacek on the porch to finish his smoke.

"Did you hear that?" I whispered. "That totally sounded like a threat, didn't it? He's gonna drag me to hell, and then he'll burn down the woods."

"That's what you got from that exchange?" Casimir asked, raising a brow.

"Why, what did you get?"

My brother cleared his throat, assuming a much deeper, gruffer voice to mimic Jacek. "*Hey babygirl, look how much cooler I've become since you last saw me, I can make fire now!*"

I took a step back. "What? Dude, that's not what's happening here."

Casimir chuckled dryly. "Oh, it *so* is. Anyways, it's not a threat. He was powerful even before you two broke up. Now, like… if he wanted to hurt us, he would have done it by now."

Hard to argue with that. I still hated Cas for leaving me alone with my ex, but I could hardly force him to come, especially since I was pretty sure I could handle myself. So I went back outside, informing Jacek that I was ready to go if he wanted to. 

"Nice. But you were right before." He stepped just a little closer to me. "This friend of mine we'll be meeting is technically my boss. The huldufólk, as you know, pays a toll to hell by taking a life every now and then. Ergo, they answer to *us*. So if you were to convince my boss, he could order the huldufólk to hide your land. Imagine the entire forest, surrounded by a charm that keeps outsiders from noticing it. Maybe folks would still read about the woods online, but if anyone else decided to come out here and explore, they simply wouldn't find anything."

I nodded along. "That would be great. And the huldufólk can really do something like that?"

"Oh yeah. They *are* the hidden people, after all. They would never do it if *you* asked them to, but if it's a direct command from hell, they'd have to. Afterwards, you can take care of Tom Hayes and that'll be it." He gave me a reassuring smile. 

"Okay, but, your boss… that's the Devil, no?"

"Sure," he said steadily. 

"I'll have to sweet-talk the actual Devil?"

"Yup."

"Well, fuck me."

Jacek threw his head back and shot a glance skyward, clearly discarding a sidelong comment. "It's not so bad, he's a chill guy! He won't care that you don't pray to him, he's super accepting. Besides, he likes me a lot, so that's already a point in your favor."

I sighed. "Let's just go before I start overthinking this. How do we get there? Is there a portal in the mill or something?"

"No, no." He plucked the cigarette from his lips. It was only then that I realized it looked kind of strange. It was black and red, and there was something written along the side in tiny letters. "Fire, walk with me," Jacek said loudly as he tossed the cigarette into the snow at our feet. 

It immediately went up into flames, cutting a blazing red lane through the powdery white. Licorice perked up, running to Jacek's side and poking him with his snout. 

"Wanna come along, boy? Ain't been home in a while, have you?" The miller raised his hand to pet the beast. He gestured for me to follow as he stepped right into the fire and started walking down the path. The dog trailed after him, wagging his tail. After glancing back to the house over my shoulder one last time and seeing Casimir wave to me from the window, I gave a deep sigh and followed Jacek Hettmann into the dancing flames. 

As expected, the fire emanated no heat. These were welcoming flames, their crackling sounded almost cheerful and their light strongly stood out against the drizzly gray sky. The further we proceeded down this otherworldly path, the darker everything around us became. I soon realized that we weren't anywhere near the woods anymore, despite having only taken a few steps. This was like descending a staircase, only that I didn't know what was waiting on the floor below. I wondered if Casimir could still see us marching off from where he was standing or if we'd already "changed sides". It was hard to tell.

Everything felt so surreal all of a sudden. The situation instilled within me a whole new kind of fear. It didn't know *what* to be frightened of, what to expect. I felt like I was being sucked into a black hole, and I was afraid I wouldn't come out as myself anymore. We were all alone in an empty, pitch-black space. I couldn't even see the ground we were walking on, I just kept taking step after step after step. Our surroundings defied logic and rational thinking, for despite the darkness, I could clearly see Jacek and the dog walking ahead. The miller seemed to be completely unmoved by this aura of existential dread his doorway emitted. He just walked on and on, pet beast by his side, eyes fixated on something I couldn't see.

Mounting panic spurring me on, I ran to catch up with Jacek. He just smiled. "This isn't what you're used to, I know. But it'll be over soon, we're almost there."

"Where is it that we are exactly?"

"This is nowhere. It's only a corridor. A hallway. It'll lead us to one of hell's populated junctions. The thing about hell is that you never know what sphere you're in, but we'll just ask around. There's a sphere for every cardinal sin, and the boss's office is in Pride. There's these elevators everywhere so we probably gotta take one to get us further down. Pride is the sphere that's all the way at the bottom."

"'Cause it's the worst sin?"

"Yeah. It puts you above God, 'cause God is the greatest and all that." 

"Since you know the Devil, have you met God, too?"

"Oh no, and I'd rather not. This is where I belong. And these days, I can't even go *near* a church. Makes me sick."

"How's that?"

"Blank magic contorts the practitioner's body. It jumbles up your insides. Your guts will be all over the place. They correspond to your thoughts, strong emotions, outward influences, stuff like that. That's why, when I felt like you were breaking my heart, it just… disappeared. Crumpled up and died." Jacek suddenly drew close again, whispering in my ear like he was sharing a secret. "If you were to cut me open right now, you could see my bowels writhing like a snake." Raising his head, he added, "Hey look, there's the door."

There really was a door. A plain wooden door, in the middle of nothing. He reached for the doorhandle, resting his fingers on it but not pulling. "Hey, um… Fiona?" He sounded hesitant all of a sudden, and when he spoke, he didn't look me in the eye. "Basically, I'd just like for you not to freak out and to… to trust me, I guess. If that's something you could do."
He sighed, clearly trying to collect his thoughts. This was a weird moment to bring up what had happened between us, but it seemed to really gnaw at him. "Why haven't you asked me to reverse the wedding dress-curse yet?" he inquired. 

"I don't know. I've gotten so used to it, it just wasn't on my mind."

"That's good, because… well, I can't. Don't know how. Curses are weird sometimes; I acted purely on instinct when I did that to you, so I don't know… I don't know how to take it back." He shook his head with a wry smile. "I'm so, *so* incredibly sorry. I mean, I can *live* without my heart, I literally don't need any organs to survive. But I can't imagine going around in that big-ass dress has always been easy."

"I've almost died twice because of it," I admitted, shrugging.

"Shit."

"Hey, I don't mind it, not really. It's not in the way as long as I'm careful. And you can make it up to me if you just take me to see your boss," I said steadfastly. "Besides, I kinda think it's nice. Very impractical, but nice, it, uh… makes me feel pretty."

"Okay," Jacek breathed, regarding me like he wasn't quite sure what to make of my response. "I mean, you *are* dreadfully pretty." His voice was all quiet again, but went back to normal after he swallowed audibly. He tugged the door open, and thus, we set foot into hell.

I don't know what I was expecting, but it was definitely not this. There was a lot of light behind that door, red light, like in a club. The streets we suddenly found ourselves walking on were busy, full of people pushing and shoving. They actually looked pretty normal. Sure, some were missing a limb or part of their faces, but nothing too serious. Only a few of them were truly unsettling. The fact that almost everything was on fire was more disconcerting. The tops of the skyscrapers looming ahead, the sparse decorative trees, the storefronts and traffic signs. Jacek sighed, reaching into his pocket and producing a pair of sunglasses.

"They really help with the brightness down here. I know it seems insufferable now, but you'll get used to it," he explained.

"They suit you," I remarked.

He grinned, tipping them down to give me a silly little wink. "Let's go."

He stopped a couple people on our way, asking them where to find the nearest elevator. Eventually, we were directed to a building so tall it disappeared somewhere in the orange clouds above us. 

"That's the shaft. We appear to be on Wrath, so we just have to go down a little ways. Pride is the next one, right below."

"Okay," I mumbled, head reeling. There was no line in front of the shaft, and mere seconds after being called, the elevator arrived with a *bing*. The doors slowly slid open, revealing a red little room. Only that it wasn't empty. I let out a sharp cry upon laying eyes on what was waiting inside.

Describing it won't quite do it justice, but I'll try—it was an enormous spider. But it also wasn't. The two parts of its body were veiny and pulsing, not black or brown and furry like a normal spider would be, but made of actual human-looking skin and flesh. Its eight eyes were, though varying in size, distinctly human and its fangs a solid, yellowish white. Its legs were more like a bunch of human arms and legs molten together, six hairy feet firmly planted on the floor while its two front arms which ended in hands appeared to be knitting.

It was by far the most horrifying and disgusting creature I'd ever seen, and I believe that's saying something coming from a person who has received involuntary hugs from a vodyanoy. 

Jacek tsk-ed, giving me an almost disapproving glance. He started towards the open doors, but I grabbed him, holding him back. "I'm not going in there," I hissed. "No way."

"Aw, come on. You've gotta be kidding me. Ain't you faced down far worse?"

"As a matter of fact, I haven't!" My eyes kept darting between him and the spider. Licorice had already bounded into the small chamber. He was wagging his tail like he hadn't a care in the world, but I probably wouldn't either if I was his size. 

"So this is where you draw the line? She doesn't even look threatening. She's knitting, isn't that nice? Do you knit? Maybe you'll have something to talk about."

"Jacek, please, can't we wait until she's off?"

"*I'm not going anywhere,*" the spider called out. "*I'm elevator security.*"

"See?" Jacek nodded, gesturing at the open doorway. "After you, madam."

I grunted, shoving past him and into the cramped red room. Patting my skirt, I gave the spider a forced sidelong smile. And that's when it happened. Just as Jacek was about to enter, the doors closed and before I could even think of stopping the horrid machine somehow, the cabin began its rapid descent, separating me from my trusty guide and leaving me alone, wedged between the spider and the hellhound.
