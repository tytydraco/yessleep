My childhood was not special. We moved into a house before I was born, which my father paid off with a mortgage. At first, everything seemed fine, but my parents started arguing more. And when I was five, they separated and my stepfather moved in. From then on, we lived in this house without my father. But he didn't disappear from our lives. My mother, my stepfather, whom she met afterwards, and my two older brothers and I.



I went to school, had a few friends and one nice thing was that the neighborhood we lived in was full of familiar faces. At that time, everyone really did know everyone. And on weekends, all the children on the street had made our street their personal playground. Everyone knew each other and life was good. I live in Germany and, as is often the case in Europe, there was a castle in our village, which used to stand on the hill where our neighborhood is now. Almost nothing remained of the original castle except for an archway that connected two houses and through which you drove if you wanted to come to our neighborhood and didn't want to take a detour.



One of the houses connected to this archway had been abandoned for many years and there were many myths surrounding it. It had three floors and was quite large. Inside, it was empty. Nevertheless, it was similar in structure to most of the houses in this neighborhood. This would become important later. We often referred to this house as a “castle” even though it wasn't one. Our children's brains had only superficially perceived that it was part of a former castle wall and so it was a castle for us.



On Halloween night, our brother wanted to scare me and my friends and he led us to this house. The lock in the house was broken and had never been replaced, so we could just walk in. We hesitated at first, but none of us wanted to be left behind as a wimp, so we reluctantly went into the house with him to explore. My brother played a few tricks and tried to scare us, making up a scary story for each room. He told us how people had been tortured here and that the ghosts had never left the house. Typical big brother. I knew his games and didn't let myself be scared, but my two friends were very afraid.



We were on the second floor when we heard it. A loud banging on a wooden surface. We were startled, but at first we assumed that my brother wanted to play a trick on us again, but my brother's look spoke volumes. He was paler than a vampire and his eyes were wide open. He told us that it wasn't him. My friends started crying and told him to stop scaring them, and I too had to fight back tears. After all, I was a little boy. I swallowed hard and walked carefully towards the stairs. The loud knocking didn't stop. At that moment I realized something. The knocking was coming from under the stairs. I told my brother and he instructed us to leave the house immediately.



We ran as fast as we had never run before. My friends slept over at my house, but none of us could really sleep. The next morning, we wanted to find out what the knocking was. Together with my brother, we went to the house during the day, which now seemed less creepy. We wanted to know what it was all about and then we noticed something. The structure of the house was similar to that of the rest of the houses in the neighborhood, as previously mentioned. Each house had access to the basement directly under the stairs. But this house had a concrete wall where the door should have been. We could still tell that there should have been a door here because the color of the wallpaper at this point was a much lighter contrast to the rest. We knew that the basement existed because, among other things, you could see into it from the outside through small barred windows.



We wondered what happened here and then we started asking around our neighborhood. The older of our neighbors, who had lived there for many decades, told us what happened in this house. I usually wouldn't take their stories at face value, but since they all told us the same story independently, I find it hard not to believe it. Nevertheless, I am not saying that it definitely happened that way.



They told us that in the 1960s, a man lived in this house who was known to worship the devil. He regularly performed satanic rituals in the basement until one day he didn't show up for work. Trying to reach out to him didn't work either. It took a few days before his boss alerted the police. They searched his house and found his burnt body in the cellar in the middle of a pentagram. At that time, people were still a bit more superstitious. It was assumed that he had sacrificed himself for a ritual and that this ritual had attracted evil spirits. Among other things, they said that priests were consulted at the time. However, they left the house immediately after they were in the basement. Especially when they were in the ritual room. They claimed to feel an evil energy in this house that they had never seen before. It was said to be so bad that it would no longer be possible to cleanse this place.



Subsequently, the order was given to concrete over the cellar for good. I don't know if it really happened that way, but why would all these neighbors tell a lie? I just can't imagine it. And why would the basement no longer be accessible if nothing happened?
