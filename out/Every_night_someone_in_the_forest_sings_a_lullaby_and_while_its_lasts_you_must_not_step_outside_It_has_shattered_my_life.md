Every night someone in the forest sings a lullaby, and while it lasts, you must not step outside. It has shattered my life.

I was born in a small town, half-forgotten by everyone. It stood on the edge of the forest, a forest that didn’t just rustle but seemed to breathe. Even during the day, it was a place one didn’t want to go, but at night, it became a living hell. The trees didn’t just cast shadows, they made the shadows linger in one spot. 

The house where I was born and grew up stood directly across from those cursed trees. A wooden structure with thin walls and wide windows, groaning in the wind. It was there that I spent all of my childhood. It was there that I learned to fear the time between one and three in the morning. I didn’t just learn to fear it, I learned to obey it.

From the moment I was born, I heard a lullaby at night. Not from my mother or father, but coming from the forest. Every night, something hummed the same lullaby.

"Mm-mm... mm-mm-mm... mmm..."

Not a single word, and this voice… it was not human. Ragged, breathless, hoarse, as if singing hurt, like the lungs were covered in moss and dirt. But the lullaby started every night. At one moment it would grow louder, at another quieter, sometimes interrupted by a long, hoarse breath, like an animal’s sigh, heavy and damp. But right after that, the lullaby would continue. My parents heard it too, as did all the houses near the forest, but no one ever spoke of it directly, even though everyone knew it. My questions about the lullaby would make my mother turn pale, and my father would frown, putting down his tools and whispering a single rule:

"Don’t go outside between one and three. Never."

My parents weren’t rich, quite the opposite. We always lived almost in poverty, with debts, huge medical bills, and my father’s work keeping us tied to this place, so we stayed in that house. During the day, I went to school, played with the neighborhood kids, lived a fairly normal childhood—except for one thing. 

As soon as it started to get dark, I, along with my friends, would run home as fast as we could, because soon it would begin. At one in the morning, like thunder on a clear sky, the lullaby would start from the depths of the forest, and something wanted the song to soothe, but it only filled us with dread. From one to three, I would listen to it if I hadn’t fallen asleep by then, or if I woke up, I’d hide under the blanket. I tried covering my ears, not listening to it, even praying, but I could still hear it clearly.

Over time, I just grew used to it, and even learned to fall asleep to it. As it turned out, it was a Russian lullaby, the kind meant for babies to fall asleep to. I even listened to the original version. The original sounded eerie enough, but the version that came from the forest... It was even darker, scarier. Life went on, with the one rule: don’t go outside at night. And when I turned ten, my little brother Mark was born.

With bright blue eyes, he was a very curious child from the start. Curious and stubborn. The lullaby turned my childhood into something sleepless and fragile, a fragment I wished to forget. But for Mark, it was something else. When he turned six, he began asking the same questions I once asked. Our parents said the same things to him they had said to me, and they always reminded me to watch over my younger brother, to make sure he didn’t look out the window at night, and under no circumstances, never go outside at night. Mark nodded, saying he understood. We thought he really had understood.

That winter night, our parents went to a neighboring town, just as small as ours, to help our seriously ill aunt. They begged the neighbor to stay with us, but he refused, I don’t even remember why. They were supposed to return by morning, and before they left, my mother kissed Mark on the forehead, reminding him to go to bed before midnight, and then she looked at me with a more serious gaze. "Keep an eye on him."

Mark and I sat in my room, the wall clock struck twelve, and I said it was time to go to bed. But he started crying and begging for just ten more minutes to play games or tell scary stories. I looked at the clock again, and with a heavy sigh, I agreed. We had a great time, and I didn’t even notice how an hour passed. I noticed it because of the lullaby, which started in the forest.

"La-la-la... La-la-la-la-la-la-la... Hm...mm-mm, hm-hm... mmm, Hm... mmm... La-la-la-la-la-la-la... La-la-la-la-la..."

I looked out the window, and so did Mark. I quickly drew the curtains so nothing was visible and told Mark to go to bed. Once I was sure he had fallen asleep, I lay down on the couch, planning to rest for just a few minutes before going to watch TV, but I accidentally dozed off, giving in to the strange lullaby’s lull.

I was woken by cold. The window was open, and I felt a fear I had never felt in my life, a fear I will probably never feel again. I screamed involuntarily and ran as fast as I could. Mark was outside, barefoot and in the cold, staring at the forest as if hypnotized. The lullaby stopped, and the only sound I could hear was the howling of the cold wind. I dragged him back inside, closed the window, drew the curtains, double-checked the door, and propped it up with a chair.
 
"Why did you go out there?" I hissed, barely holding back tears.
Mark was pale and trembling, but not from the cold—he was shaking with fear. 
"I saw someone... I thought it was Mom... She was waving at me..."

My heart pounded wildly, and I couldn’t believe it was happening for real. I prayed it was just a very realistic dream, but it was reality. I took Mark’s hand and backed away, trying not to breathe too loudly, slowly looking around, checking the house for anything unusual. For the first time in my life, I didn’t hear the lullaby at night. Just for a minute. And then…

"Hm-mm... mm-mm... La-la-la-la-la-la-la... Hm... Mmm... Hm... La-la-la... La-la-la-la... Hm-HRRRRmm... mm-mm-mm..."

The lullaby was coming from right behind the wall. I heard heavy footsteps, something struggling to take breaths, still humming the lullaby. It was circling our house, listening to what was happening inside. Mark started crying, and I covered his mouth with my hand, though I could no longer hold back my own tears, which streamed down my face. 

We crawled under my bed, and I still held Mark’s mouth with my hand. The lullaby continued, sounding as if something was already in our room, when suddenly there was a loud crack, and I saw shards of glass falling on the carpet in front of us.

 Something had broken the window and seemed to have looked into our room, still singing the lullaby. It started walking again, heavy, unnatural steps, right toward our front door. The door groaned, and then I heard a muffled thud directly against the door. It was a strike on our door, something was breaking it. Another strike, and the lullaby began to sound within our house. The chair I had propped the door with flew across the hallway, smashing into the wall. We stopped breathing, trembling under the bed and huddling together.

First, we saw its legs—moose legs. Long, crooked, covered in rough fur. Its split hooves clattered on the floor as it passed through the hallway, still humming. In my mind, I prayed, begged it not to find us and just leave, but instead, the creature came into our room. It knelt on all fours right in front of the bed, and we saw its face. It was worse than death.

 It was the face of a moose, but overall it looked like a werewolf. One of its antlers was cracked and stiff, the other completely broken. A rusty hunting knife was embedded at the base of its skull, its face twisted, resembling a mix of beast and corpse. Dried blood covered its rough fur, and its small, red eyes stared into our souls. Steam came out of its nostrils as it exhaled, and its mouth... Long, twisted fangs. 

It stopped singing when Mark screamed in terror, and I wanted to scream too, but I felt paralyzed with fear. One of the moose’s arms, long and twisted, held an axe. With the other, it reached for Mark. It grabbed him, screaming and struggling in my arms, despite all my efforts to hold on to him. The moose lifted Mark and pressed him to its chest, my little brother trying to break free, scratching and kicking, but the moose kept walking, humming the lullaby and gently rocking Mark as if he were a baby.

I didn’t know what I was doing, my body moved faster than my thoughts, and I lunged at the moose, trying to stop it, grabbing its leg, but it didn’t stop. In the blink of an eye, I was struck in the face with the axe handle, and I fell to the ground, unable to rise. My vision blurred and became very fuzzy, but I saw my little brother trying to break free from the creature’s death grip, screaming:

"Don’t leave me!"

And then the moose slightly turned its head in my direction. It breathed heavily, and its little, red eye looked at me, letting me know: it had remembered me.

It took me a little time to get on my feet. Leaning on the walls, I managed to crawl to the open door, which had a huge hole from the axe. I looked outside and saw the moose taking Mark into the forest, humming the lullaby and rocking Mark as if he were its own child, and he kept screaming and crying. At that moment, I lost consciousness.

That was the last time I saw Mark. No one saw him again.

When my parents returned, they wailed, but not like humans—like dying animals. My mother fainted, my father cried, and for the first time in my life, I saw him cry. They aged in one day. My father turned gray just a few days later, and my mother stopped speaking altogether. They were never the same.

My father started drinking every day, and my mother would do housework mindlessly, not knowing why or for what, her eyes vacant. I cried every day, blamed myself, cursed, wished the moose had taken me instead of my little brother. I stayed in that house for a few more years before moving to college in another city. And every night, while I stayed there, the lullaby would start again at one in the morning.

But the scariest part… since then, the lullaby has grown much louder, as if it were right outside our house. My father boarded up all the windows and chained the door, wondering why he hadn’t done this sooner. But it was too late.

Late at night, I cried and couldn’t sleep when I heard a soft tapping at my window, barely audible over the lullaby singing right outside my window. I got up and peered through a small gap between the boards, and saw that red eye. We stared at each other for just a few seconds, and then it went back into the forest, still humming the tune.

I’m writing this far from home. My contact with my parents has ended; we have nothing to talk about. We are just living corpses, with no desire or meaning to live. But even in my new city, sometimes, when the night is too quiet… I swear, I hear it.

"La-la-la-la-la-la-la... La-la-la-la-la... Hm-mmm... Mmm-mmm... La-la-la-la-la-la..."

It’s probably just my imagination, or maybe he really has started hunting me. I’ve never told anyone this story, but now my pain and fear, which have consumed me for all these years, have become unbearable. I take a lot of pills to numb these feelings, but nothing helps. 

What scares me even more are the monstrous nightmares that torment me every time I sleep. The moose is holding my younger brother deep in the night, calling me into the forest, to join them. My brother doesn’t cry; he sits in the moose’s arms, saying he’s happy. He and the other children.
