My father named me ‘Aarav’ so I would have a competitive advantage in life. He wanted me to appear at the top of class registers and government databases. He wanted me to be noticed.

What I would give to never be noticed again.

Anyhow, I’m aware that many Indian parents choose ‘A’ names for children, but the point is that my parents wanted the best for me.

Life doesn’t ever go to plan, does it?

Maa and Papa died in a car accident when I was 6 years old. That would have been awful enough, but then I found myself living on the streets, rather than in an orphanage. Papa often told me that I had Lakshmi, Goddess of wealth and fortuitousness, on my side. Alas, it was Alakshmi, the Goddess of misfortune, who set her sights upon me.

Or perhaps a rakshasa—a demon. I used to tell myself that. Better the Devil you know. In truth, I don’t know what I saw in that New Delhi slum, and the unknown terrifies me more than any nightmare detailed in religious texts.

After my parents died, I sought escapism in Hindu mythology. I would pinch religious books from local libraries, so as to feel some sort of connection to Maa and Papa; they had always been devout followers of the faith.

I needed escapism not only from grief, but from life on the streets. I spent 3 years living with pickpockets between 6 and 12 years of age. They helped me to survive when I had nothing and no-one.

That feels eons ago now. I’m a 29-year-old software developer working in Paris. I often wonder whether I would’ve stayed in India, had it not been for a horrifying experience. Something which incentivised me to do whatever possible to get far, far away from the slums. The city. The country. Heck, the continent.

Two decades later, I know that nowhere is far enough.

The year was 2004, and I was a 9-year-old street urchin—an orphan who subsisted on rupees pilfered from Delhi’s inhabitants. My group mostly targeted tourists, but it was an Indian businessman who caught my eye on this particular February morning. He looked displaced in the slums, like he’d strayed a little too far from Gurgaon’s gentrified streets of glass and smog. Displaced fools are the best earners.

The stranger was strolling stiffly—in odd, unnatural movements—along a cramped passageway of street stalls. He was a conspicuous man with a navy three-piece suit, pristine black loafers, and an upper face shrouded by a black shawl. I remember being a little puzzled by his covered eyes; I wondered how he could see where he was walking.

Of course, money was the main thing on my mind. Well, food, but money was necessary precursor to that. So, it didn’t matter that he was odd; it mattered only that he was important. And I knew that without a shadow of a doubt, as I’d spent 3 years perfecting the art of noticing important men.

Of course, I wish I *hadn’t* noticed him. I wish I hadn’t swiped the leather wallet from the side pocket of his trousers.

And I wish I hadn’t seen it.

In one of the wallet’s slots, below a healthy wad of green notes, was a Polaroid.

Ordinarily, I would have pocketed half the cash, then returned the wallet to the victim’s pocket. It’s always best to stick to rupees. Wealthy folk often lose track of how many notes they carry, so they don’t miss a few hundred rupees. Following this line of reasoning, my friends and I rarely aroused suspicion.

I should’ve stuck to the plan. Should’ve taken the money, returned the wallet, and fled.

But something about the white border of that Polaroid, brown-stained but poking tantalisingly out of the leather pouch, intrigued me. And I made the decision to let my finely-tuned routine fall to the wayside. I let the businessman start to walk away. I broke all of the rules.

And after I wiggled the photograph free, I whimpered, almost dropping both the wallet and the Polaroid.

*It was a picture of me.*

A picture that I didn’t remember anyone taking.

A picture of a place I’d never visited.

There I stood. A boy with a blue, tattered T-shirt, maroon-stained trousers, and bare feet. I was smudged a little, as if somebody taller had been standing in my place previously. And I was standing in a damp bedroom with mould-ridden walls and upper bunks clinging to the two walls. The camera flash should’ve illuminated the entire space, given that it was such a small room. The room shouldn’t, and *couldn’t*, have been a large space. Yet, it seemed unfathomably big. Too big for the light to reach the blackness beyond the bunk beds.

I looked frightened. My head was starting to turn, and my brown pupils were crawling across the whites of my eyes, as if daring to look behind me—as if there were something I’d seen, or heard, in that unlit back-end of the room.

I trembled, fearfully scrunching the Polaroid in one hand and the wallet in the other. My instinct was to look up at the man I’d robbed, though I expected him to have left the vicinity.

He hadn’t.

Standing motionlessly at the end of the dirt path ahead, like a rock bearing the crashing tide of impoverished market-goers against it, was that wealthy, navy-suited businessman. He was facing away from me, and that deeply unsettled my gut—more than the impossible Polaroid I’d discovered. Something was uneven about the way in which this man had paused in the middle of the path.

Then he began to turn.

Began to pivot on loafers that seemed impossibly clean in contrast with the dirt beneath his feet. He twisted around until he was facing me directly, and I finally got a proper look at him.

The black shawl still covered the man’s upper face, but his lips still showed. They had transformed into sub-human features. Had turned a muted grey, without even a hint of red, as if belonging to a corpse.

The man’s mouth neither smiled nor frowned. It simply started to open, and long strands of brown connected the upper and lower lips—gunky and thick, like rubbery mucus. Beyond the lips, and the brown strands of unknown consistency, was a black pit. An entrance that led to the man’s gullet. Staring at it pained my eyes and left a quiver in my heart. The black seemed to be tugging my eyes towards it; I felt a strain in my retinas. Felt my eyes start to bulge.

And then the man started to take powerful strides towards me.

I wanted to run. I still don’t know why I didn’t. He may have fixed me to the spot, with eyes or something worse hidden beneath that shawl. The man took angular strides towards me with grey lips parting wider and wider to reveal a lightless cavity within—a version of hell ready to engulf me.

However, moments before the gentleman came close enough to touch me, there sounded a harsh, braying honk.

I spun to look at an impatient driver sitting in a green-and-yellow tuk tuk, so I stumbled sideways to let the still-moving vehicle scoot past. But when I returned my gaze to the direction of the approaching businessman, he was gone. And the only remaining evidence, which convinced me that I hadn’t imagined any of the horridness, was the damning Polaroid I’d crumpled in a teensy, quaking fist.

When I arrived at the wooden shanty I called ‘home’, I was rebuked by one of the older boys for not returning the wallet to my victim’s pocket. He said something along the lines of:

“You just dropped a leather turd on our doorstep, Aarav. And we don’t shit where we eat.”

I was evicted, essentially, but that was the best thing to happen to me. It got me out of that hellish cycle, with nothing in my possession but a handful of rupees and a haunting photograph—a photograph that I dumped at the side of a road before leaving the slums behind.

All I wanted was to leave India—run as far as I could for as long as I could. That impossible photograph left me feeling unsafe.

Left me feeling pursued.

To leave, I needed money, so I pleaded with any and every business owner on the streets of New Delhi. A few unsavoury sorts offered me work as a pickpocket, but I declined—I had to leave that life behind. And I didn’t want to run into that suited spirit ever again.

I was eventually blessed by a sweet couple who owned a restaurant in Connaught Place. They adopted me, and I was enrolled in a new school. I had just turned 10 years old, so I was about 4 years behind my classmates, but I eventually caught up. My goal, initially, was to get far away from the navy-suited man. The man with the photograph that made no sense to me.

*How did he know I would pick his pocket?* I wondered. *How did he create a photo of something that never happened?*

As the years went by, however, I lost sight of my goal. Lost sight of my superstitious fears. Lost sight of my religion.

In 2014, at the age of 19, I believed that it had all been a dream—that I’d simply exaggerated events in my head. There had been no Polaroid. There had only been a string of traumatic events which had warped the mind and memories of a poor child. I no longer wanted to leave Delhi. I felt safe.

That all changed on a late-night taxi ride.

The driver released a series of expletives as his withered old tuk tuk spluttered to an abrupt stop on a dirt road. We both stepped out of the rickety rickshaw to inspect the damage, but the driver shooed me off.

“You’ll only get in the way,” he said.

I rolled my eyes, but it made no difference to me. I remembered the slums. Remembered the slums at night. I felt comfortable there. In fact, I recognised the road. The ramshackle houses and empty market stalls looked different at night, but the street itself hadn’t changed in the past decade.

I had returned to my old pickpocketing grounds.

But my stomach dropped when I saw it—crumpled up at the side of the road, exactly where I had dumped it 10 years earlier. I called it a coincidence, but I knew better.

The photograph at my feet was that Polaroid from a decade earlier.

I should have left it. I should’ve just kept my hands in my pockets until the taxi driver had fixed his tuk tuk. Instead, I squatted and scooped the Polaroid out of the dirt. Then, using my phone’s torch, I illuminated the picture in my weak, unwilling hands.

What came from my lips next was a scream. I screamed not because this was the same photo from 10 years earlier, but because it wasn’t the same photo at all.

It was a new picture.

A new picture of me.

Gone was the young, frightened boy in the dark bedroom. In his place was a teenage version of Aarav standing at the side of a dirt road, next to a broken-down tuk tuk, looking down at a mangled Polaroid in his hands. The scene depicted was impossible.

The photograph had already been lying on the road, yet it depicted a scene that had yet to pass.

I shot my eyes upwards, searching for the photographer who had to be standing at the other side of the road. However, as I eyeballed that spot, I saw only a black alleyway branching off from the dirt road—a road barely lit by a few sporadic lamps and string lights.

Regardless, even with no light to reveal the passageway, I felt absolutely certain that something lurked in the dark.

The taxi driver stirred me from my terrified trance, announcing that the tuk tuk was operational once more. I didn’t need to be told twice. I hopped into the vehicle and shrank into a foetal position, feeling vulnerable—exposed—as the vehicle, with no doors to provide even an illusion of safety, trundled slowly past the black alleyway. I was only a foot away from the spot in which the photographer must’ve stood, and I felt a wisp of wind wash over me as we drove past.

With a shudder, I tossed the photograph out of the vehicle and vowed never to return to that street again. Vowed, as I had 10 years earlier, to leave India behind for good. Leave that *man* behind for good.

I quit my porter role at the restaurant. My new Maa and Papa were sad to see me go, but they understood that I needed something better—not that they knew the full story. I found a job vacancy with a cruise line, and my hospitality experience helped me to secure the role.

*Out at sea, I’ll be safe*, I naively believed.

It sounds silly, looking back. Silly to believe that this man, with the power of premonitions, would be unable to find me. I’d left India, and that, in my eyes, equalled safety; I would never return to that street in Delhi, so I would never return to my trauma. It all seemed logical.

But when I was appointed to clean Room 11 on the 3^(rd) Level, I started to suspect that I’d been wrong.

As I walked down the corridor of rooms, I felt the graze of air against my nape—a gentle breeze that erected my hairs, though I chose to dismiss this warning sign. I didn’t want to believe.

The truth became undeniable, of course, when the door to 11 opened onto a black room with a crumpled Polaroid lying on the beige-carpeted floor. My belly lurched downwards; for a moment, I thought the ship itself might have been sinking to the depths of the ocean. To the depths of hell. To a nightmare that had been awaiting me for a decade.

I recognised that room.

Recognised the bunk beds clinging to the walls.

Recognised the darkness, not penetrated by my phone’s torch beam, that seemed to harbour some hidden thing at the back of the bedroom. Yet again, I made the mistake of squatting and picking up that photograph. I resigned myself, in a way, to the fact that I was trapped—that I would never outrun this stalking monstrosity.

And then I stumbled backwards as I faced a picture somewhat familiar.

It was the very first photo I’d found in the wallet, only that little boy wasn’t so little anymore. He was a 19-year-old man, filling the blurry smudge that had been there a decade earlier. I was wearing that same haunted expression on my face. Was wearing those same doe-in-the-headlights eyes.

It was as I’d always feared. The man was taunting me with prophecies. I thought I’d been changing my fate by running away, but I was *always* supposed to be in that room. On that ship. Not as a child, but as a young man.

I was always going to end up in Room 11. And something was always going to find me. Something at the back of the room.

*No*, I realised, eyeing the picture. *Something in the doorway, taking the photograph.*

I also realised, at this moment, that the breeze I’d felt on my neck had been no breeze at all.

It had been an exhale of breath.

Breath warm, stale, and *wet*—more liquid than gaseous.

*Don’t turn around*, I suddenly thought. *If you turn, the prophecy in the photograph will come true. And you’ll have to face what comes next.*

But I had to see. Had to see what was standing behind me in the doorway—what had exhaled warmly onto my skin. I slipped my phone out of my pocket and lifted it up, then I gasped fearfully at the reflection in the black glass of my phone screen.

Behind me, there stood a figure in a familiar navy suit and a black shawl, which had been pulled back to reveal—

Well, I’m not sure.

My eyes were straining again, you see, as if something were preventing them from seeing whatever was reflected in the screen. And with jittery hands, I dropped my phone to the floor.

I almost turned around to see the man’s face in full, but I reminded myself that I had the power to prevent the photograph from coming true.

So, I closed my eyes and started to back out of the room.

Those hot, rancid exhales continued to beat in wretched puffs against my neck as I reversed out of the room. And then I bumped into something immovable—something bolted to the carpeted hallway of the 3^(rd) Level. My shirt rubbed against the fabric of a blazer, producing an awful scratching noise.

I felt like a child—safe as long as I kept my eyes closed. Somehow, that unsound logic rang true, as I eventually managed to sidestep free from the awful creature in the corridor. I ran blindly down the hallway, bumping into walls as I went, and only when I reached the end did I dare to open my eyes—simply to find the button for the lift.

After that experience, I decided to return to land. There was no escaping that thing, but being trapped at sea made the nightmare infinitely worse. I felt stifled. Claustrophobic.

I spent the next few years in education, studying to become a software developer, and then I found a job in Paris. A gargantuan city with plenty of streets. Plenty of places to run. For I will always be running. I know that now. Whenever I let my guard down, a crumpled Polaroid will always resurface to unveil some direful prophecy of a future that may come to pass.

And I will try my best, every time, to make sure that it does not.

Because I don’t know what will happen if it [does](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
