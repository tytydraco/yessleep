So, I make fries at the mall at night. 



That's like 99% of my job. And they're paying me a lot. Like a lot. It's weird.



I'm kind of... How can I say this. I'm not a good student. I'm not a put together sort of a person. I really didn't take school seriously, and when I was twenty-two, (I'm twenty-three now.) I needed money.



I was in community college trying to figure out how to not be poor, and I was failing miserably. My family is a mess, my three friends from high school had all moved away, I've still never been in a relationship, I had nothing.


I just needed a job that wouldn't conflict with my class schedule.


The way I got the job was weird. So, I live in a suburb. One of those 80's relics that had a booming 90's-2000's. Now it's all families with huge amounts of credit card debt, driving around yelling at each other, entitled. It wasn't like this when I was a kid.


Katie Mills Mall used to be amazing, but I guess malls across America died a slow financial death in the 2010's. I don't really remember when Katie Mills closed. I think you can still walk inside it during the day but there's no stores, just a pretzel stand and a security guard.


My college was real close to Katie Mills, but real far away from my house. If I didn't want to pay for gas, it took me about an hour to walk from my house to the community college. And I didn't want to pay for gas that day. So I was walking.


It was sunset, late in the spring, and it was hot. I was walking off the campus in kind of a haze, trying to decide what chain restaurant to stop at on my walk home.


The days heat radiated from the pavement at every crosswalk.


As I'm passing the hedges by Katie Mills, a guy in a cook uniform wheels out this huge container of trash. I don't know why but I watched him as I walked by.


The cook slowly wheels out this enormous trash pile, and I'm watching as he's trying to maneuver this corner, and one of the wheels on his cart explodes. Pops. The corner of the trash container goes down. Sounds like thunder. THUD!


Tiny little pieces of plastic and metal go everywhere. Wheel goes flying off into the grass.


The cook starts cursing, FURIOUSLY. I guess he was Italian? Most people in my suburb are from America, or Mexico, South America, or Canada. But this was 100% full on an Italian man.


So this Italian guy is SCREAMING at the universe, no idea what he's saying, I'm doing my best to not die laughing. I also don't want him to suffer, so I hurry over to try and help, trying to keep a straight face.


"Hey, man-"


The guy is still cursing and doesn't acknowledge me.


"Here let me,"


I grabbed a corner of the cart, and the cook understood.


"Oh! Thankyou! Yes, thankyou."


With me at the back end of the cart lifting up the one corner, we were able to wheel the cart on three wheels.


"The wheel exploded. BOOM!"


"Haha, yea I saw that, that sucks."


"Thankyou so much sir, Left here."


We rolled the cart down a ramp into an underground parking garage. The garage was brighter than it was outside, fluorescent white. It smelled like damp concrete, exhaust, ozone.


We didn't really talk and honestly I was debating in my head whether I wanted a burger or a sandwich and not really paying attention to my surroundings.


A few hundred feet into the parking garage, we arrived at this weird door. It was metal, but really polished, like chrome. And I don't know, it was weird. The metal didn't seem like it was reflecting us in front of it. Maybe it was the angle. I don't know.


The Italian cook walked up and pressed a button on a panel by the door, and the door opened. Behind it I saw nothing. Just black. A space.


Graciously, the cook picked up the back of the cart and guided it into the space while I pushed from the front. With the cart inside, the cook was barely able to squeeze out of the opening.


The cook pressed the button again, and the chrome door closed. He clapped his hands, seemingly immensely relieved.


“Done. Thankyou so much for your help, Grazie mille."


"Hey no problem,-"


"Who is this?"


I spun around. There was a tall woman standing behind me, she had close cut hair, rimless glasses. She looked concerned.


The Italian man said something in Italian and the woman responded. I don't speak Italian. I felt like I was in trouble. But I was just helping?


"Come with me."


Now this is where it gets weird. I am not a person that takes directions easily, I have trouble listening, and I do not like being told what to do at all. To an unreasonable degree. But when she said that it was like my mind was fully docile, that I simply would absolutely follow this person. 


I followed the woman and the cook into the dark abandoned mall, thoughtlessly. The walls were mostly white, all the stores were empty, and the last rays of sunset were still shining through one of the half-dome glass rooftops.


The white walls and pink-orange light gave the giant space a dreamy, liminal feeling.


Our footsteps echoed through the corridors. For some reason, I thought of my family. We shopped here a few times during Christmas in the 90's, when my parents were still together.


I was led into an enormous open area where a group of mostly men dressed in white lab coats sat in front of what looked like a makeshift office. There were computers and wires running everywhere, and some sort of instrumentation shaped like hoops and towers of silver, kind of like the silver the door from the garage was made of.


I could hear the group speaking casually as we approached, but when they noticed me they fell silent.


"Who's that?" Asked a man with shoulder-length hair and an enormous beard.


"Someone new."


The woman answered, with finality. She seemed like she was in charge here too. Am I going to die? I thought to myself, kind of joking.


The glasses woman picked up a small black box next to one of the vacant computers and brought it toward me. When she opened it, there was a piece of black, broken metal on a small cloth bed. The metal looked like a piece of a broken soda can, kind of jagged and twisted.


"Can you pick this up for me please?"


"What? Uh. Sure."


Seemed harmless. I reached for the metal and as my finger touched a jagged edge I felt an enormous shock inside my forehead, like someone had hit me in the face with a sledgehammer. I crumpled to the floor.


“OW. OW! What is that?!” The pain was blinding. I felt myself rolling around pathetically in agony in front of these strangers. The woman closed the box.


“You’ll be fine.”


As soon as the box closed the pain in my head vanished, instantly. I laid there on the floor, gasping for breathe, sweating. The woman stared at me with indiscernible expression, her eyebrows slightly furrowed.


"Why you?"


That's all she said. She walked off into the dark mall without a word. For a second, no one said anything and I just laid on the ground, breathing.


The long-haired man sauntered over and offered me a hand to stand up.


"I've never seen a reaction that strong. Where are you from?"


I took a second to answer. My mental haze was gone. I realized the situation I was in was incredibly strange.


"I'm from here, Stafford. I grew up a couple miles from here."


"You ever come to Katie Mills in the 80's?" The man asked. He seemed like he was trying to cover up how interested he was in this question.


"No, I wasn't born yet."


A woman I hadn't noticed before approached carrying some papers and a pen.


"Fill this out. Ms. Sharon wants you to work here."


"Okay? Uh. What is this? What are you doing here?"


"That won't be discussed with you, we want to offer you employment. You will have to sign an NDA."


"Okay. Uh. I have class all day-"


"The job is at night." The woman answered me, curt.


"Can you tell me what the job is?"


"Ms. Sharon wants you working the kitchen."


"How much does it pay?"


Turns out, it was a lot. I won't say how much, but it was enough to get my car fixed and my bills paid and start saving. I was tempted to drop out of college but I didn't. I did drop a bunch of classes so I could sleep during the day though.


They had me sign pages and pages of documentation, asked me about my education, my family. I wanted to ask questions but I really needed the money, and I think some part of me just wanted to know more about what was happening here, so I shut my mouth.


The job itself is a lot of cleaning. I work with about six other cooks, two from Guatemala, two from Thailand, the Italian Sous, and I think there's one cook from Argentina as well. I'm the only native English speaker and they communicate exclusively in Spanish so I'm doing my best to work on that and keep up.


They mostly have me making the fries. The food there is surprisingly amazing, they just cook for the scientists and the security guards in the mall but these are definitely restaurant quality line cooks. I don't really know what to make of it.


When we make food for the science group I never bring it out, but I always deliver for the guards. The security guards are all hilarious, always making fun of each other and the situation. It seems like an easy job, all they do is smoke and play videogames and do "rounds". Rounds are just walking through the empty mall and back.


The job is fantastic, honestly. I've worked here about four months and I've made more money than I ever have in my life. I also have an actual friend, this security guard Santos. Santos is this big Fillipino dude, he’s into the same obscure metal bands as I am, and he's always talking about his girlfriend problems. He’s a good guy. Me and him play 2k every day during our shifts.


There is something "off" about this place though. No one really talks about it, but you can feel it in the mall. One night recently, Santos and I were playing 2k. Santos was winning, but he was using the Celtics, so was it really winning? Santos seemed a little distant that night, he wasn't really smiling or joking like he usually did.


"What's up man, your girlfriend making you go apple picking again or something?"


Santos kind of laughed, but it was fake. Like polite. He looked at me, then looked around. The other guards were on rounds, or outside smoking maybe.


"I need to show you something."


Santos got up and went over to one of the security camera terminals. It was like a big checkerboard of live feeds, all showing the empty halls of Katie Mills.


Santos typed something into the computer and pulled up a saved video. He dragged it over to another monitor and brought it up full screen.


"Look at this."


It was a security cam video of an empty hallway on the third floor of Katie Mills. The timestamp at the bottom said it was about 3am, a few days ago. For a while, nothing happened. It was looked like a static image, just a blank hall with the timestamp running the clock slowly. The footage was a little grainy.


"Amazing, Santos."


"Just wait."


Suddenly there was movement in the frame. Like a shadow. It was a group of people, walking toward the corridor. When they walked in front of the camera, they looked like college kids, but... Old. Like how kids dressed in the 80's. They looked like costumes. They just kind of casually walked down the hallway, talking.


Like it's just a normal day.


And then the group of people, they're walking and they're walking, and then they walk straight through a wall. Like it was nothing. Like it wasn't solid. They just vanished.


"Whoa, play that again?"


Santos paused the video and replayed it. He even slowed it down, frame by frame. I stared at the people. They looked like normal people, completely solid.


After we watched this strange group melt into the concrete wall and disappear a few more times, I felt a little uneasy. 


"What is that, ghosts? We got ghosts?"


"I don't know."


A phone rang next to the computer, jolting us out of our thoughts. It sounded like a fire alarm. It was a landline, with one of those old red lights that shined when a call came through. I'd never heard it ring before. Santos picked up the phone from the receiver.


"Hello?"


There was a pause. He looked confused, then looked up at me.


"It's for you."


He handed me the phone. I placed it to my ear and I heard the voice of the woman with the rimless glasses and short hair, Ms. Sharon. We hadn't spoken since the day I was hired.


"I need you to come to the Sublevel, room A103 please. You won't be working in the kitchen tonight."


"Okay. When?"


"Now."
