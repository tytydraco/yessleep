I was terrified. Still am, if I’m being honest. It’s not everyday your guitar amp gets possessed. Here’s what happened:

My guitar amp started picking up a random radio station. Initially, it was faint, barely above a whisper. I just grumbled, then went back to practicing whatever I was working on. Probably something by Brandon Lake. The next morning, I’d completely forgotten about it. I had other problems.

This was a dark period in my life. After spending my 20’s touring in a Christian alt-country band, I’d decided to settle down and find gainful employment. (Is there such a thing, these days?) Perhaps I’d find a partner and get married. Simple pleasures, right? 

Well, I did find employment, although I wouldn’t call working at an outlet store, selling shoes, gainful. Around that time, I’d lost interest in playing music. In fact, I’d gone a full year without touching my guitar. I was emotionally drained, having spent most of my young adult life touring crummy venues and crashing in cheap motels.

To make matters worse, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t find a partner. This saddened me. Probably, that’s why I picked up the old Fender Telecaster again. Shame me if you will, but I knew if I performed at some open jams on the weekend, my chances of finding an interesting partner would greatly improve. It’s worked in the past.

You see, I’m socially awkward. A wee bit on the spectrum, perhaps. Picking up women was never my forte. I’d sooner sit on a frozen toilet seat then approach some good-looking stranger in a bar. Yikes. And online dating just isn’t my bag, ya dig? Tried once, and failed miserably. I still prefer meeting people the old-fashioned way: in person, even though the process eludes me. When I’m performing music, however, they approach me. It’s how I meet people. It’s my superpower.

Anyways, back to the amp.

The following weekend, while I was plucking away on my electric guitar, it happened again. My amp was picking up a random radio station. Only this time, it was loud and clear. It scared the hair right off my head (what was left of it, anyways). The deejay spoke in a low-pitched, sardonic voice. Something about his voice sounded off. It was too harsh, for starters. Like a chainsaw. Voices don’t sound like that. Human voices, that is. His drawl was as deep as a Leonard Cohen song. A drawl that can only come from the Deep South. Eastern Kentucky, perhaps. But not quite. It was unlike any voice I’d ever heard.

I live in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in a crummy, one bedroom apartment. Nowhere near the South. So, you can imagine my confusion. The voice speed-talked for about a minute, while I stood stupefied, scratching my head. Ultimately, I chalked it up to a faulty patch cord, and kept picking away at Sturgill Simpson’s version of a Nirvana song. 

When the deejay spoke my name, I nearly died.

“Hey Noah,” the voice croaked, “you gonna learn to play that thing, or what?”

I dropped my guitar pick and watched it bounce underneath the bed.

“Welcome to WDVL, 666 on your earthly dial!” the voice went on as if nothing out of the ordinary happened, as if he hadn’t just spoken my name. “Hail Satan. He’s the truth, the light, and the darkness.”

The voice rambled on and on, speaking so fast he barely had time to breathe. Meanwhile, I was trembling, my bladder threatening to burst. That the deejay knew my name troubled me most. I wondered what else he knew. Did he know my faith was weakening? Or that I’m a sinner? With a flick of the wrist, I turned off the amplifier. His grim voice died an awful death.  

I gulped. My right leg was twitching a million miles per hour.

What’s going on? 

Was something wrong with me?

Clearly, there was.

But what?

I wasn’t taking drugs. I rarely drank alcohol. Nor was I on any meds. I wasn’t a weirdo – the people at work seemed to like me. And I wasn’t living in some random haunted house. This made zero sense.

Needless to say, I avoided the amplifier, choosing instead to practice on my acoustic guitar. Problem was, I could barely strum the damn thing, my hands were so shaky. That night, sleep was futile. My mind was racing. So, instead of tossing and turning, I did some research and discovered that the problem was, in fact, my faulty patch cord. Just as suspected. The next day, after work, I went to a local guitar store and purchased a new one. Paid a hefty price, but I wanted the very best. Guitar stuff isn’t cheap, lemme tell ya.

When I returned home, the guitar amp seemed larger than life, lurking joylessly in the corner of my bedroom, daring me to plug in. Every time I’d pick up my electric guitar, ready to blast out some chords, my anxiety skyrocketed, and I’d put it down. My nerves were shot. I started talking to myself. Not a good sign. I had to do something. This was getting ridiculous. So, at long last, I plugged the shiny new cable into my amp (a Fender '68 Custom Deluxe Reverb, for all you gearheads), and started rocking out.

Nothing. 

No devilish deejay, no random radio station. Just pure, angelic Fender tone. Phew! Relieved, I set about working on some Johnny Cash songs. Who doesn’t like the Man in Black? While I was belting out "Ring of Fire", giving it all I had, the unthinkable happened: the dreadful deejay returned.

“Hell yes, my son! You will, in fact, burn in a ring of fire! Loooooord below! Satan is the way, the truth and the answer; give unto him, and he shall fulfill your deepest, darkest desires…”

I froze. My tongue felt like a sponge, my hands as big as baseball gloves. My blood turned to ice. Something about the voice paralyzed me. It was like he was in my room, delivering his diabolical sermon directly to me.

“...that’s right, Noah,” he sneered, “give unto Satan, the Loooooord of Death, and he shall deliver salvation. You want a partner? A luscious, beautiful blonde? I’ll bet you do. Or how about a busty brunette? Yessir! A gal that looooooves her country music!”

I unplugged the cord, hoping that would stop him. 

It didn’t.

“Nah!” he continued, louder than before. “What you reeeally need, Noah, my hapless human friend, is a fiery redhead. Loooooord below! One that’ll suck the paint off your porch, if ya know what I mean. Ha ha ha. I don’t care to intrude, Noah, but yer looking awfully thin these days. I do reckon. Aaand…”

I turned off the amp; it crackled and popped, then went silent. My beating heart, which was louder than a bass drum at a rock concert, filled the room. Tears threatened my eyelids. I’d always loved that amp. Had it for years. Suddenly, I was too afraid to even look at it, let alone touch it. What a dilemma. Smartly, I put the guitar back in its case, and shoved the case in the closet. 

Then I wept.  

That night, the deejay visited my dreams. I can’t recall exactly what he said, but I woke up in a pool of sweaty sheets. Worse, my fingertips were encrusted with blood, and I was balding. My once-golden hair was sprinkled across my moist pillow, like evidence. I knew I needed help, but there was no one to turn to.

Having spent ten years on the road, my only friends were my bandmates, and let’s just say we didn’t end our partnership amiably. Spending that much time with anyone – even your closest friends – can cause serious friction, even in the best of times. And I’m not close with my family; they never approved of my musician lifestyle. I have many acquaintances, but only one true friend, Peter, and he’s going through his own version of hell, (a nasty divorce). So I didn’t reach out. 

After my morning shower, I put on a fresh pair of Levi's and a plaid sweater. As I was leaving the bedroom, my amp started hissing. The red power light was flickering. When it spoke, I nearly had a heart attack. 

“Plug me in,” the deejay said, in a croaky voice. “You’re not scared are you?”

The rational part of my mind insisted that nothing was wrong. That this was merely my overzealous imagination. Had to be, right? But that didn’t explain the voice. Amps don’t speak. Especially when they’re unplugged. 

I shoved the amp in my closet, next to the guitar. 

For the remainder of the week, I avoided the electric guitar and returned to my trusty ol’ acoustic (a Gibson J-100). Life seemed to settle. The following weekend, longing to find myself a partner, I decided to hit up a local jam session. It had been over a year since I’d last performed. I needed this. Problem was, most jam sessions provide inadequate amplifiers. And tone is king. (It’s a guitarist thing.) So, despite my trepidation, I loaded my amp, guitar, and a Tube Screamer overdrive pedal into the van, and drove downtown.

The house band was fairly decent. Weekend warriors, at best, but nice enough fellas. That they knew who I was certainly boosted my confidence. I’d only done backing vocals in my previous band; now I was to sing lead. Confidence was crucial. When they called me up, we blasted through a Georgia Satellites’ classic, followed by “Tennessee Whiskey”, always a crowd favorite.

Although it was a meager-sized audience, I had them in the palm of my sweaty hands. My voice felt strong, and my amp sounded superb. Halfway through “Tennessee Whiskey”, I noticed a redhead wearing a tight Zeppelin tee-shirt giving me dirty eyeballs. She couldn’t keep her gorgeous green eyes off me. I felt invincible. Just like old times. With the two songs completed, the small-but-mighty crowd demanded an encore. 

I busted into “Ring of Fire”, and all hell broke loose. 

The drummer kicked off a steady train groove. The bass player locked in nicely. There was a keyboard player on stage providing the much-needed harmony. I played the trumpet bit on the guitar. We nailed the intro. 

“Love,” I sang, in a throaty baritone, “is a burnin’ thang.” 

The redhead started dancing. 

“...And it makes a fiery ring…”

As I leaned into the mic, eager to deliver the next line, I got zapped. Electrocuted. I fell with a thud, cracking my head on the side of the stage. The mic stand went flying and slammed the keyboard player in the skull. He went down, too. Amidst the chaos, my amp started speaking. 

“This is WDVL, 666 on your earthly dial…”

Everybody stared, stupefied, as I lay sprawled across the stage, twitching.

The band leader approached me cautiously, “You alright, son?”

I tried speaking, but my lips felt like two balloons. Graciously, he helped me up. As my eyes adjusted, I noticed the redhead walking out of the bar, shaking her head. The remaining patrons chuckled, then returned to their drinks. With a troubled mind and scorched lips, I gathered my gear in disgrace.

“You’re pitiful, Noah,” the deejay pestered. “All hail Lucifer, the Prince of Darkness, the Evil One, Loooooord of the Flies…”

The hair on my arms stood tall. My mouth was as dry as a musician’s sense of humor. I studied the barroom. Was anyone else hearing this? Apparently, not. Or if they did, they chose to ignore it.

I drove home highly agitated. What the hell’s wrong with my damned amplifier? I pouted. And why me? What did I do to deserve this? Not only was I miserable, I was petrified. I needed to get to the bottom of it, and fast, so I contacted a local luthier (a guitar repair person, for you non-musicians). 

When I told Steve (not his real name) what was happening, he turned ghost-white.

“Heard of this happening once before,” Steve said in a nasally voice. He ran a large hand through his thinning gray hair, and paused. “Paul Marino,” he said thoughtfully, eyes cast afar. “Poor ol’ Paul is still in the mental hospital. Or whatever it’s called these days. Not allowed visitors, last I heard.”

Steve looked at my amp with suspicion, then smiled awkwardly.

I was as tense as a two-dollar steak. Having just turned thirty-one, I knew I was too young for a mid-life crisis, but that’s how it felt. And I was lonely. Playing guitar was my only outlet. I needed it. Even if only on the weekends.

“Tell ya what,” Steve said, inspecting the amp, “I’m sure it’s nothing. Probably your patch cord. You have your cables on you?”

I did.

“Good!” he said. “Leave 'em with me. I’ll have a look. Come back next week.”

I sighed.

He turned the amp on and, using my cables, plugged a guitar into it. No radio station. No disreputable deejay. He strummed a G chord; it sounded as sweet as roses. 

“Looks fine. Sounds good.” Steve shrugged. “It’s probably nothing but strange karma.” He winked. 

We shook hands, then I left.

It was a rough week. I could barely concentrate at work, and I no longer felt comfortable at home. I slept on the couch, avoiding my bedroom like the plague. The following week, when I hadn't heard back from Steve, I stopped by his shop after work. The lights were off. The parking lot was deserted. I called him, and it went straight to his voicemail, which was full. An icy chill climbed up my spine. Steve worked late hours. He should be open. 

The following Friday, there was still no word from Steve. My anxiety skyrocketed. I could only imagine what my dreaded amp was doing (or saying) to him. My life was in turmoil. I’d lost weight, and to my chagrin, I’d gone completely bald. Seemingly overnight.

None of that mattered.

What mattered was that people were posting about Steve on social media, asking for information. Apparently, he failed to show up for a band rehearsal, and he missed an important gig. His family and friends were worried sick.

By now, I was completely freaked out. The cursed amp! What the devil was going on? A question came, one I could do without: what would the deranged deejay do next? My mind jumped to many conclusions, each more terrifying than the last. Was the devil out for revenge? Was he punishing me for quitting my band? He probably hates Christian country bands. Maybe I should play heavy metal? Surely, the devil loves metal. Or perhaps, I should pack up and move to Canada. He’d never find me up there. Too damn cold. 

I stayed put. My rational mind was having none of this. Surely this is a case of bad luck. Or as Steve put it, ‘strange karma.’ Another week went by, and still no news of Steve. It was like he’d vanished. 

Ultimately, I was forced to purchase a new guitar amp.  Truth be told, I was kinda excited. Yeah, I was saddened about Steve – he’d helped me a lot back in the day, working on my road-worn gear – but perhaps a new amp was all that was required. Out with the old, in with the new, as they say.

(Don’t judge. Once a musician, always a musician. I had to do something. Besides, it’s not like I murdered Steve. All I did was bring him a glitchy amp. Repairing amps was his job, for Christ’s sake.) 

Thus, I bought a brand new Vox AC 30. A classic. 

When I plugged it in, it sounded wicked-good. No devil, no radio station, just a smooth, velvety tone. The amp soared. I cranked it to eleven and wailed all weekend. It was a blast, although I’m sure the neighbors would disagree.  

Relieved yet anxious, I needed redemption. It was time. I had to return to the local jam session. Perhaps there was still a chance of impressing the redhead. Needing new material, I decided to take a stab at something more challenging: a popular Charlie Daniels’ song. Not an easy feat, lemme tell ya. Playing the fiddle part on guitar would require a heck of a lot of practice and dexterity. But the devil’s in the details, as they say, so I woodshedded all week. 

I was extremely nervous. Bizarre amps, missing luthiers, electrical shocks; if only I had someone to soothe my worried mind. A fiery redhead, perhaps. Despite my trepidation, I practiced the Charlie Daniels song as though my life depended on it. And perhaps, it did. 

Another week passed, still no Steve. Surely, an omen. I was coming unglued, but sitting around feeling sorry for myself wasn’t helping, so I returned to the local jam session, toting my brand new Vox AC 30.

The place was packed. The fiery redhead was there, sipping cocktails in the corner with her friends. The host looked at me peculiarly, but smiled nonetheless. I was terribly nervous about performing the Charlie Daniels song. What if the house band couldn’t handle such a challenging piece. Maybe I should reconsider, and choose an simpler song? 

When I was called up to perform, a few patrons giggled, including the redhead. Despite my shotty nerves, I played exceptionally well. My guitar soared like an eagle. The Vox delivered what it promised: killer tone. The band was hot. The audience was receptive. After blazing through a Jimmy Reed song “Big Boss Man”, I started to relax. Things were actually going my way! It was time to play the Charlie Daniels song.
 
The drummer – a middle-aged Mexican man, with a cop mustache and hefty beer gut – looked uneasy. Nonetheless, he counted off “The Devil Went Down to Georgia”, and away we went.    

“You gonna play that thing, boy? Or stand there looking stupid?” 

The deejay. 

His menacing voice soared through the amp’s speaker, clear as a bell. 

“Because I’m in the mood for some fiddlin’. Loooooord Below. Yessir, I am.” 

His voice was as meaty as a porterhouse. 

Fear paralyzed me. My shaky hands could barely hold the guitar pick. I’d forgotten the words. I didn’t know what to do. Fortunately, singing wasn’t required. Apparently, Satan knew all the words: 

“Well, the Devil went down to Georgia,” he sang. “He was lookin' for a soul to steal. He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind. And he was willing to make a deal. When he came across this young man…”

I fainted. 

When I came to, the barroom had cleared out, the bartender glared at me with contempt. I felt like an imbecile, a total loser. I left immediately. In the confusion, I’d forgotten the amp.  I considered returning for it, but was too embarrassed, so I stayed at home and wallowed in self-pity. 

…

I’ve thought long and hard about this decision. Maybe I should’ve gone back for it. Maybe not. Hard to say. Because what happened next still haunts my dreams. 

Later that night, in a burning ring of fire, the bar was set ablaze. Foul play is suspected.  

And still no word from [Steve.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromStarr)
