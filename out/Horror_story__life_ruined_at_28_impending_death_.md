One steroid cycle - Sporodic fatal insomnia 

Did one seamingly harmless testosterone only steroid cycle for 12 weeks and it destroyed my life very quickly

Life was good i looked good very fit looking
Lots of life long mates, beautiful family and girlfriend Great job successfully being a supervisor
Associating with the gym world and being around people who experimented with performance enhancers i studied the topic vigorously before starting.  

I was a hypercondriac so i took supplements that where recommended by the bodybuilding world to control side effects
Unfortunately these where cross contaminated with something or the testosterone was dirty gear
I was monitored by a doctor for the time i was on and all was fine 
Then when i jumped off in a pursuit to be healthier and done with that as id rather stay natural and healthy the doctor called me saying my blood work was all scewed
Between this time i went camping with my mates and we visited a mental asylum ghost tour and took the piss out of it. I even quoted “how does anyone even end up in a place like this”

Then 3 months after i developed an extreme mental per personality change. I had a panic attack which id never experienced anything like this
Then the same night i had extreme insomnia
I tried for 2 months to get the insomnia under control with psychologist and good sleep hygiene practices. None of this put a dent in ny sleep. Keep in mind i have always been a big believer in getting 8 hours and loved sleep so much. 

After giving up on the natural route my mental health was taking a huge dip, i stopped working stopped leaving the house and was lit on sleep medication to try and combat the insomnia. Nothing would touch it but a benzo
This led me down the benzo path which wasnt doing anything but knocking me out until it stopped working. 

Now i have a benzo addiction that doesnt even put me to sleep and i have fallen into a deep state of psychosis. It has been 7 months since the extreme shift and i have not been able to pull my self out of the whole im in. With the mental decline and insanity that followed i have lost virtually everything. I lost all of my mates, my job, my family, my drivers license, my hard earned savings dwindling away and new health issues such as tinnitus, failing organs extreme weight loss and constant anxiety ridden brain. 

My memory is faulting and i am essentially in a dementia state. I have extreme emotions that fly off the handle when i look at photos of my family and friends and my dog :(
My reputation is completely destroyed and i will soon be homeless, yes homeless without the ability to sleep. I have lost a total of 15 kg of weight and sweat profusely. 

Every doctor i have gone to refuse to send me to a neurologist and just feed me medication to try and knock me out. 
I am paranoid everyday and ruminate over every possible death outcome known to man.
I am essentially involuntarily a drug addict due to one stupid cycle i did that is the equivalent of smoking meth with the amount of sleep loss i have accrued. 

So at the age of 28 my life got flipped upside down and death awaits. I have suicidal thoughts everyday and long for a normal 8 hours of sleep. I give myself another 6 months max
