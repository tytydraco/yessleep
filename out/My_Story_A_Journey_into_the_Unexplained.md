Here is my story about what I have experienced; everything is still ongoing. I didn’t ask for any of this, but it is very interesting. First, I will introduce myself so you know what kind of person I am.

**About Me:**

I am an atheist; I believe in science. I always found religion to be the most awful thing on earth—causing all the misery, wars, and spreading stories that didn’t fit with my personality. I am a science guy. I am highly educated, and I don’t watch too much TV, but when I do, I always watch documentaries.

In my parents' home, I experienced some spiritual stuff that couldn’t be explained, but let’s say on a soft level. I always thought that energy might be real, something science couldn’t explain. But what I have experienced was exactly like what you see in exorcism movies. I didn’t think that was possible. I am not someone who believed in God, the devil, or any of that stuff.

I am highly educated but come from the streets, just a talent for passing exams well without studying. I didn’t even buy books or do homework—just lucky with that. I love excitement and adventures, so I’m a street guy. I’m also connected to higher criminals; I can make money in both worlds. With my legal business, and if there’s an opportunity to make big money illegally in a kind of safe way, I’m always in.

I’m also very healthy, always eating whole grain foods, vegetables, fruits, etc. In my life, I’ve done judo, kickboxing, soccer/football, and fitness. But in the illegal business, sometimes you drink and take cocaine; that’s just how it works. In my country, we are the portal for all of Europe in distribution, so taking a sniff of cocaine is as normal as drinking a beer.

**How My Story Begins:**

In January 2019, I was feeling horny and decided to visit a sex worker, so I made an appointment. There was an unbelievable connection, which was strange for both of us. Sex workers are only there to get money from a client, not to fall in love in the end. The same for me; I’m a guy who never had a shortage of attention from beautiful girls when I went out. I’m extroverted, confident, and a good talker. But somehow, we were very connected to each other, something I never thought would happen with a sex worker.

At first, I just saw her as a new sex buddy—someone I paid for half an hour but ended up staying with the whole night just to have fun together. But after a while, we really developed feelings for each other; we were soulmates. She told me that she had nightmares every night, where her deceased grandma would try to pull her to hell with her demons. All fine to me; a nightmare is a nightmare—I didn’t believe that stuff.

**Here It Starts Getting Freaking Weird:**

Before I continue, I want to give a disclaimer: I probably forgot to write down a LOT that happened, because so much happened—maybe too much? But I’ll explain the major points.

Let’s say I live in hotels and rental apartments/houses. At one moment, we booked a hotel in September 2020, and after spending time together, I wanted to go to my rental home.

When I got home, I wanted to go to sleep and smoke a cigarette before. At that moment, a big red triangle popped up on both my phones—private and business—and made a sound. Just like a warning sign. At that moment, I could hear multiple people around my house. It seemed like another criminal organization had targeted me. They jammed my phone and wanted to break in, or at least that’s what I thought. Because that’s exactly what I would do—jam the communication so no police or backup could come. I tried to call some people, but I got no signal, no Wi-Fi, just total nothing—only the red triangle warning on both phones. So I got my weapon and went outside. I saw six people trying to attack me, so I went back inside but dropped my keys. So fuck, my front door was closed, but the back door was still open, and I couldn’t close it anymore. And I could hear a lot of noise around my house, like a manhunt. This went on for two fucking days. And still, I didn’t connect it to the spiritual. But okay, the “people” didn’t come inside—only motorcycles driving around and people talking to each other. All fine.

**I Go Abroad to Live with Her:**

I couldn’t rent a new house quickly, so we talked, and she said, “Come over to me.” She’s from Ukraine, from the most criminal city, where she had an apartment. I agreed with her because we loved each other so much. So in January 2021, I went to Ukraine.

That’s where all the extreme shit started to happen. I mentioned earlier that I’m still connected to the spiritual realm—can you imagine, as an atheist?

The moment I got there, she had a dog. The dog was watching the ceiling in a corner and barking. The dog saw something, we both knew. But my lady was also an atheist and claimed to only experience something because of her deceased brother, or at least that’s what she thought.

So two months passed, and a lot of stuff that I had experienced at my parents' home also happened there. Just the small, fun, interesting stuff—things disappearing, moving, the TV turning on by itself, and even when unplugged from the electricity, it would still function. Stuff like that—just a ghost moving things around. Nothing extreme, just interesting for atheists.

**It Started to Get Interesting Later On:**

In that place, there’s a bulletproof door with six locks. Every time you came back to the apartment, you always locked the door—just standard.

We wanted to get married, so we had some papers to sort out. At one point, the papers were gone. She blamed me, saying I didn’t want to marry her, or maybe the cleaner lady was jealous and stole them. Okay, that’s possible. Again, life went on.

At one point, my lady was resting in bed, and I was in the living room. The dog’s basket was in the living room, and the dog went to the bedroom where my lady was. At that moment, the basket instantly caught fire out of nowhere. So I grabbed the basket and ran to the front door with the flames in my hands, unlocking the six locks—it takes a while. When I opened the door to get rid of the burning basket, guess what? The dog was outside the door. What the fuck is this? I asked my lady about the dog, and she said the dog had just come into the bedroom. Okay, all fine, all strange. Life continued on.

**Now, the Extreme Stuff Starts:**

My lady wanted to treat me well and went shopping for me, buying a lot, including a Hugo Boss belt. The next day, the belt snapped, so we returned it to the shopping mall. We received a receipt and were told that if they could fix it, they’d call us, or we’d get a new one. We just went on with our lives, but remember this belt. The shopping mall was 10 km away from the apartment by taxi.

We wanted to get married, and so we did—in March 2021, we were married. We were extremely happy. All the stuff I’m about to mention happened in the 9 days following our marriage. The moment we walked into the apartment, there was a queue of missing/disappearing stuff (around 25 items), similar to what had happened before in the apartment, but now in a sequence. Very strange, but my lady thought it was her deceased brother giving us a sign. Damn, we were so wrong about that. After we married, everything started to go to the extreme, like it wasn’t allowed for her to be happy or for us to be married.

I forgot to mention, we were busy renovating the whole apartment, so we had construction workers over every day, guided by her best friend who did that kind of work.

**Episode 1:**

One night she was sleeping, and I was awake watching a documentary. She started crying in her sleep, so I asked, “Are you okay?” She got up in bed in a strange way and said in a weird tone, “YES, I AM.” She then sprinted out of bed to our clothing room. I thought to myself, okay, what the fuck is this? So I followed her and saw her gripping her neck with both hands, strangling herself. I thought, what the fuck, so I tried to remove her hands from her neck. She was extremely strong and kept saying, “I will die now.” I said, “You won’t because I’m here.” But every time I removed her hands from her neck, they would return. She was extremely strong for a small woman.

At one point, I pulled her to the ground so I could use my knees to restrain her arms and prevent her from choking herself. Normally, it’s not possible to choke yourself because the moment you start to pass out, your grip loosens, and you can breathe again. But this was different. When I was on top of her with my knees restraining her arms, I saw her fainting. Somehow, she swallowed her tongue, which is also not possible, so I said, “No way,” and pulled her tongue out. This continued for an hour; after that, it was over. So we went to sleep because it was around 1 AM.

**Episode 2: The Unseen Force**

The next morning, I woke up at 10 AM, which felt unusual. Something was off, and a thought crossed my mind—maybe she needs to talk to a “space herbal lady.” But then, another thought emerged, darker and more unsettling—what if it’s the devil? Just as that notion surfaced, an invisible force suddenly flung me out of bed. My head and arm started thrashing uncontrollably from side to side, like I was having an epileptic seizure.

I slammed my head against the walls, feeling the blood trickle down, while my mouth became painfully dry. I couldn’t speak or warn my wife, but my mind remained crystal clear. I was being dragged slowly around the room, and all the while, she was still sleeping peacefully. The force was pulling me toward the bedroom door. We had been busy with renovations, and construction workers were usually around in the mornings. As I was dragged toward the door, I saw, through the glass, two workers walking by. I couldn’t call out to them, and as much as I was terrified, part of me wondered what they’d think if they saw me, naked and being dragged across the room with my head and arm flailing wildly.

The force put me on my knees in front of the glass door and began smashing my head against it repeatedly. I realized then that whatever this was, it wanted to kill me. I had to break free from this spell. With tremendous effort, I managed to grab onto the bed sheet where my wife was still sleeping. I couldn’t scream, but eventually, she woke up. She was shocked to see me convulsing uncontrollably, unable to speak. She tried to help, but when she got too close, I kicked her away to avoid hurting her.

It took another half hour before the violent movements finally stopped. I held onto a pillar with my right arm to steady myself until it was over. My wife mentioned seeing the “cleaning lady” in the hallway, even though no one else was there. Just like how I saw the construction workers, who weren’t actually there either. She couldn’t remember much from the night before, and when I needed to use the bathroom, she was too scared to let me go, insisting I just pee in a bottle instead. Afterward, we discussed what had happened, still in shock.

Once the “spell” lifted, the room was filled with strange noises. It sounded like a dimension collapsing, a cacophony that lasted for several minutes. It felt like they were angry I had survived.

We were exhausted and decided to go back to sleep. But when we woke up again, my wife didn’t remember a single thing from what had happened earlier. That’s when I knew this was something powerful, something terrifying. Any normal person would have run away, but I stayed because I knew she needed help, and no one else would be able to do it after witnessing what I had. It requires a different kind of courage, one that doesn’t scare easily.

This might seem like the end of the story, but believe me, it’s only the beginning. Things are about to get even more twisted.

**Episode 3: The Possession**

This happened nine days after our marriage. We were watching *The Wolf of Wall Street* around 9:30 PM when suddenly, my wife started shaking violently. She asked me what was happening, but I already knew—here we go again. I thought it would last an hour at most, just like before, but I was dead wrong.

Her hands and arms moved to her throat, trying to choke herself again. I tried to pull her hands away, holding her arms beside her head, but she was unnaturally strong. We struggled so intensely that I was drenched in sweat. We ended up on the floor, wrestling around the bed. Despite her petite frame, she was overpowering me—a man trained in Judo, Kickboxing, Fitness, and Soccer.

An hour passed, then another, and still, it didn’t stop. It was clear she was possessed, and whatever had taken hold of her wasn’t happy about our marriage. As the battle continued, her legs started moving in an unnatural way, lifting towards her head. I had to restrain them too, using my legs to pin hers down while still trying to keep her arms under control.

At one point, her eyes locked onto mine, and I could see the entity’s rage intensifying. With no free limbs left, I pressed my head against hers, trying to stop her from butting her head into mine. We were at it for nearly three hours.

Until this point, the entity had been silent, but as it grew more frustrated, it made her scream—an eerie, ancient sound like something out of a horror movie. I didn’t back down; I was determined to save my wife.

But then, the entity escalated again. She began speaking in tongues, a mix of Latin or some ancient language. My head started moving on its own, just like it had that morning when I was thrown out of bed. That’s when I realized I was dealing with the same demons. This time, I could hear them, casting their spell out loud.

As I restrained her, my head jerking left and right, I leaned close and whispered, “Ah, now I see. You’re the same ones. Now I can hear you.” I kept repeating, “Get out of her! Get out of her!” over and over, even though I wasn’t raised religious and didn’t know what else to say.

At one point, I saw all the pillows on the bed moving toward her. She grabbed one and tried to smother herself with it. I threw the pillows away, but they kept creeping back toward her. It felt like an endless battle. Every time the entity tried to cast a spell in that strange language, I covered her mouth with my hand. She briefly came back to herself and told me to stop because she couldn’t breathe. I was grateful she could still reach me, even for a moment, in the midst of all this.

The entity tried to trick me, making her say, “I have a dry mouth, can you get me some water?” But I knew it wasn’t really her—it was just a ploy to get me out of the room so it could finish her off while I was gone.

After nearly five hours, I noticed she was getting weaker. It became easier to stop her from choking herself. I knew I couldn’t give up; it’s not in my nature. The entity was losing its grip. I was exhausted from shouting, “Get out of her!” in English, so in frustration, I switched to my native language—a language my wife doesn’t speak or understand. I yelled, “Get the fuck out of her, you fucking demon!”

To my shock, it responded fluently in my language, “No, we won’t!” I was stunned. I asked, “Do you speak my language?”

“We speak all languages,” it replied.

Then she looked at me and said, “How can you be here? You should be dead!” I responded, “Well, I’m not, so get the fuck out!” By this time, the entity’s power was clearly waning, and I knew I was on the winning side.

I kept demanding it leave her body. She would relax, but after a few minutes, the choking would start again. They couldn’t fool me. I never let my guard down and kept repeating that they were getting weaker.

After six grueling hours, there was a loud knock at the front door. The entity screamed in terror, that same horrific “aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa” sound, like something out of a nightmare. I taunted it, saying, “You’re afraid of what’s at the door, aren’t you?” The knocking continued, but whatever was outside couldn’t get in easily. I knew it was one of my guides or something good trying to help, but the demon was strong, and it kept knocking.

The entity told me her name was Eva, and she was 40 years old, and that there were more of them. Eventually, it left her body. We talked afterward, and she vaguely remembered seeing a woman in the apartment. I grabbed my laptop to record everything because my phone had mysteriously vanished in the room. On Google Maps, you could see the exact time and location when all of this happened, and how my phone was moving erratically before disappearing. The next day, my laptop vanished as well.

Believe me, this is just the beginning of a bizarre story.
