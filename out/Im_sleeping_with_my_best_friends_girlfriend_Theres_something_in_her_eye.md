First of all, yeah. I knows it's not right.
But hear me out.
My best friend, who i'm gonna call Dean, and I grew up together. we loved the same movies, we went to the same school.

He was the smart guy, the one who helped everybody get ready for an exam.

I was the girl who knew how to get fake IDS.

We we're not exactly popular, but also weren't unpopular. We had just the right amount of friends, we went to the right amount of parties and we always had each other's back.

Then Dean began to date Nicole (not her real name). We we're already on our late 20's and writing a screenplay together (yeah, that dream is never gonna come true). 
They met at a movie teather , where she worked.

Dean fell in love right away with her.
Sad thing is, so did I.

She was a really nice, quirky person. I really loved the way her blue dyed hair fell all the way down to her lower back, or how the little piercing she had on her left nosetril make her hole face glow.

They we're together for almost a four year, and in all that time I never made a move. I love Dean with all my heart. Of course i wouldn't. 

But then they decided to take a little trip to San Francisco. They stayed at an apartament that used to belong to Dean's sister.

They stayed there for two weeks.
Then they came back and everything was different.

Nicole began spending more time with me, or so i thought, but in reality, she just wanted to stay away from him.

Both of them changed.

Dean, who used to be a smartass, always with a quick response, or always with his old camera, filming everything, was now a distant, cold person.
He began calling me in the middle of the night, but he didn't said anything. 
Eventually I faced him and he just said that while in the apartament , both of them "Saw something on the walls" and whatever that was wouldn't let them sleep.

He and Nicole didn't break up. But they grew distant.
She came to me one night, claiming that she had a horrible nightmare but when she wake up, Dean wasn't there. He was in the kitchen, facing the wall.

I hug her and she hugged me tighter. And i'm sorry to say that l loved that hug.
She slept with me that night.
Honestly, I don't know how it happened but the next morning, once we had woke up, we just kissed.

And then we had sex.

It went like this for four weeks before Dean just abandoned her. And me.

In those four weeks he didn't call me once. 
Nicole was the only one who had contact with him.

I cried.
She cried.

I went to his place. The walls were torn down. 
Most of them.

He left a note. 
It said "i saw the colors" and in a separate note, wich I found on the bathroom it read "it's in our eyes now"

I promised I'll stopped sleeping with Nicole.
But she needed a safe place.
So did I.
And honestly I was in love with her.
I still love her. Wherever she is now.

Two weeks ago we has sex again. After se ended, we were lying on the bed, just holding hands when I hear something.

I run to the living room and waited.
There it was again. Like a scratch.
I stay quiet a couple of minutes, trying to figure out te source.

Suddendly I figure where the sound was comimg from and I almost ran away from there. I could swear I got cold and some horrible goosebumps traveled through my skin.

I leaned forward and pressed my ear against the wall.  

I didn't hear anything, but then, a scream.
It was Nicole.
I ran back to the bedroom where I found her on the floor, just screaming and crying. She was scratching her eyes.

I kneeled beside her and she screamed "it's in my eye"
I hold her hands down and looked.
There was a color in her eye.
No, not a color, Many colors.
Many imposible and horrible colors.
Her eye was like an ocean and I could just drawn in it. 
For a moment I couldn't move. I was hypnotized.
They we're horrible, yeah, but also pretty. Powerful.
But then it began showing me things.
Images.

I think I saw a glimpse of hell.
Or a version of hell.

I backed off and only stared as Nicole tear her eyes out with her nails.
I cried.
Minutes later she stopped screaming.
Minutes after that, she stopped moving.

Then I heard the scratching again.
I went to the living room, shaking and I just stared at the wall. Something was scratching ON the wall. Not inside it.
There were small white marks on the wall.
Then on another wall.
And so it went on all night.
I ran to the bathroom as tons of scratching noises filled the room. 

But before I went in I saw her.
Nicole was sitting on the bed. Waving at me. No eyes on her face, but her smile was all teeth. She kept waving as I locked my self on the bathroom. 

I slept there and for the whole day I didn't went out.
Once I finally managed to, I saw that the walls where all tear down, or atleast most of them.
And Nicole wasn't there either.

I'm having a breakdown, since now I can see a little spark of color on my eyes. And every night I go to sleep I keep dreaming about the things I saw in Nicole's eyes.

And I miss her. And Dean.
But a voice in my dreams said that I'm gonna see them soon.
