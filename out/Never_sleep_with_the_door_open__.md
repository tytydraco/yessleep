I had always been an insomniac. For years, I slept with my bedroom door open. But ever since that day. . . I fear what would happen if I left the door open again.

I basically lived in my room upstairs, because my Mom was a narcissist, and just terrible to be around. I had always slept with my door open at my old house, because me and my sister's rooms were right across from each other, and it felt comforting to know she was there. I carried this habit of keeping the door open at night at this new house. It felt a bit strange at first, because now my sister was in the room next to mine, and the bathroom was in front of my bedroom. Since my Mom had no other place to put a BB gun I got for Christmas one year, she gave it to me, and I left it resting beside my bed at all times. You never know when you might need a method of self defense. One night, while lying in bed, I heard a strange noise from downstairs. A loud, drawn out creak broke the silence of the house. I knew we had two cats downstairs, so I just rationalized it with a simple explanation. Whatever they had knocked over could be handled in the morning. So I went back to sleep, in blissful ignorance of what it could be.

The next morning, I was awoken by my Mom's yelling, as per usual. I rolled out of bed, turning off my heated blanket, and getting dressed. I walk downstairs, seeing my dog in his crate next to the table. As soon as he spotted me, he starting crying loudly and shrilly. I let him out of the cage, and called him over to the door to let him outside into the back yard. He tried to run up the stairs to use the bathroom upstairs instead, so I grabbed his collar and forced him out the backdoor. I proceeded over to the closet where we kept our food in the kitchen, and took out a packet of Pop-Tarts. I suddenly remembered the noise from last night, looking around for what the cats might have knocked over. There wasn't anything on the floor, so I just assumed that someone else had handled it. I ate my breakfast, and put my lunch in an air frier to cook. My sister came downstairs next, and I wave at her greeting her with a: "Morning, dude." After a while, it was time to go to school, but that's just plain boring. So I'll spare you the details. I got back home from school that day, going upstairs to my bedroom to watch TV and play video games for a while.

Eventually, it was nighttime again, and I was lying in bed. I woke up around midnight, having had a strange dream. . . and standing at the edge of my bed was a strange figure. It's eyes seemed to glow with how dark the room was, and it had a huge, manic smile on it's face. They looked entirely deranged. I screamed, reaching for the BB gun next to my bed. The figure ran through my open door, and as I followed it out, I could barely spot it running downstairs. I made as much noise as possible, and eventually my Mom walked out of her room, angry and confused. "What? Why're you being so loud?" she asked. "Mom, someone's in the house!" I replied, still in shock. She looked terrified, and grabbed her phone to call the police. She took me into her room, locking the door as she dialed 9-1-1. By the time the police showed up, the man was supposedly gone. The police questioned what I saw after sweeping the house. They told me they'd keep their eyes out for anyone that matched what I could tell them, and to call if I saw him again. With that, the officers left.

The next morning finally came, and the day passed just as quickly as the last. I woke up around 1AM, and this time, no one was there. I rolled out of bed, needing water, but the cup was empty. So I walked out my still-open door, and down the stairs. I had one of those fridges that dispense water from one of the doors, so I walked over to fill up my cup.

When it was around half-way full, I felt a cold, clammy hand grab my ankle. I looked down, and there he was. The man had found a way to cram himself into one of the cabinets. He was still in the house. And he was right there, staring me down. He let go of my ankle to climb out of the cabinet, his lanky figure being fully revealed. He looked to be around eight feet tall, but he barely had any muscle on his bones. He still looked manic, and terrifying. I moved on impulse, forcing my body out of shock to dart up the stairs. I got to my room before that man. . . no, that MONSTER could get to me.

I finally slammed the door shut, and locked it. Knowing my Mom and sister *had* to have heard that, I texted them this. "DON'T OPEN YOUR DOORS! LEAVE THEM CLOSED, AND LOCK THEM!" My next step was dialing the police. The man started pounding on the door, as I got connected. "911, what's your emergency?" "Hello? There's a man in my house, he barely seems human! He's pounding on my door right now! The address is \[You didn't honestly think I'd put my home address here, did you?\]! Please, hurry!" With that, I hung up. I grabbed my BB gun again, aiming it at the door. The man continued pounding on it. Eventually, I heard my saving grace. Sirens, loud shouting outside.

They broke down the door, leaving the man no time to escape, but. . . the pounding stopped, and he was just gone. I heard a loud knock on the door. It sounded like a male officer. "Hello? Is anyone in there?" He asked. I ran over to the door, unlocked, and opened it. "Oh thank God. . . did you get that guy?" I asked him. "Kid. . . there's no one here other than you and your family." He replied. "What? But. . . h-he was here! He was, like, eight feet tall, and he was pounding on my door!" I said, sounding desperate for someone, *anyone* to believe me. But he just told me it was my imagination, and left with the rest of his team. They didn't even sweep the house this time, they just. . . left.

I knew the police could make mistakes sometimes, but this just felt so unreal, and ridiculous. He was there, and I knew he was. The rest of that night, I didn't sleep. I relied on TV and video games to keep me up, too afraid of what would happen if I went to sleep. The door to my bedroom was still closed and locked. I didn't see the man again.

The next morning, I brought up the man again at breakfast. My Mom and my sister shared a glance, before my sister nodded at her. "Son. . . there's something you should know. That man has been plaguing our family for years. The first night me and your father slept in the master bedroom at the old house, we left the door open. Your father woke up, and he was greeted with the sight of that same man. He pulled a gun on him, telling him to get the hell out of our house. The man just stood there, looking deranged. He didn't even budge. The gun fired, and it hit the man. Black, seeping ooze slowly poured out of the bullet hole. The man started laughing. . . it soon turned into maniacal laughter, and he just vanished. When your sister was first born, she too, slept with the door open. The man appeared to her as well, but was gone as soon as she got there. He's always been there. We don't know who he is, or why he's following us. . . all we know is that sleeping with the door closed and locked stops him from entering your room."

I just stared in shock. This man. . . this **THING** had been watching me sleep, every night of my entire life. I hadn't even realized he existed. Knowing that someone was always standing there watching, every noise I heard, there was actually someone standing there, staring, just out of my view. I knew that from that day forward, I would never sleep with the door open. . .

((Hi, anyone who bothered reading all this. Sorry for any grammatical issues, this is my first post on Reddit, and my first ever creepypasta. I figured I might as well do something like this. This is all fictional, except for some of the details I took from real life. Of course, this eight foot tall, lanky, monstrosity I wrote about isn't real. That'd be absurd. Anyways, I hope you enjoyed this. Any criticism you might have, I'm completely open to, as I'm sure I could use it.))
