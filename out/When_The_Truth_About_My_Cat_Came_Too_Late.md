It's only been two weeks since I got my cat, two weeks that I can't take back. 


Let's start from the beginning. I first saw her on a Facebook post, keep in mind, I live off in the suburbs so a post giving away a cat was quite difficult to come across, especially for such a secluded area with little to no neighbours. The cat was a small, young short haired black cat. Completely black, with a set of cerulean eyes that glistened with a bright, flickering light, one that told wonders beyond belief. I immediately read what the post had to say and I was shocked to find out that this cat was being given away for free. It's strange, you never see owners just giving away their cats without at least pocketing a hefty amount of cash-- but this was *different.*


I had been looking for a pet to call my own for quite some time, having grown lonely over the past couple of years since I moved out of my parents house. It wasn't like I've never owned a pet before, in reality I used to own a cat. We had never grown a bond even though we lived together, alongside my parents, for years. Regardless, I learned the necessary skills on how to care for a cat, and the eccentric perks they exhibit. I can't describe how I felt when I saw the post, it was a soft, bubbling feeling starting to rapidly swell inside my heart-- almost as if this was some kind of fate being fulfilled... Well, if *you* believe in such a thing. So, it was safe to say I wasted no time at all in messaging the person giving away the cat and eventually we agreed to meet the next day. And so, I spent the entire day getting the necessary stuff I need for my "to be" cat. 


*I regret ignoring the strangeness of that post that day.* 



"Thanks for coming all the way here." I greeted the man before me as we stood on my front porch. 


There was something about this man that got something sharp, eerily thick running up my spine, threatening to stiffen it. Dim light clung everywhere on my porch, but not once did the light brighten the features of the man's face. A huge, black shadow covered each part of his face, the only thing I could make out was his inhumane, ghostly tinged lips. 


"Sure." He replied, and his voice was void of any emotion. He only stood there, holding a cat carrier in one of his hands with the cat in question inside. 


I could feel something tightening around me, closing me in, however I thought nothing of this man's strange behaviour. I could only politely smile, trying to come across as  enthusiastic I could.


"What's her name?" I questioned curiously, peering into the void that was the man's face. 


Then there was... 


*Silence.* 


It was almost like the world had stood still, that time had stopped and the reality as we knew it was nothing but an elaborate scheme. The man didn't move a muscle, utter a sound, he was just *there.* That feeling of something caving in around me went from a fragile, breezy feeling into something overwhelming immediately, and but once again I ignored it. 


"You should know," the man abruptly broke the silence, pushing the cat carrier gently into my hand. "*It* isn't what it appears to be." 



The rest of that day I couldn't shake off those words. I couldn't shake off the looming, darkened hands towering over me I couldn't see, filling me with an overwhelming sense of dread I couldn't shake off. I remembered I could only stand there as the man's figure eventually faded into the distance. 


What did that man mean? My thoughts were a fluttering, jumbled mess as I had constantly replayed the words inside my head. Little did I know that I already knew what that man meant all along. The cat. Even then, not once could I believe what was *clearly* there.


The cat had settled inside my house immediately. She'd sprint excitedly around the house, dashing between each and every tiny corner she could. She'd lean her body against my legs whenever I moved around the house, a casual, soft touch, an affection radiating for me as if it wasn't the first day she had met me. Wherever I went inside the house, she'd follow me without hesitation. She either curled up beside me or quietly did biscuits on my blanket covering me, silent except the subtle weight of her body pressed against me. She was an energetic, playful and sweet cat, despite the saying that black cats give you *bad* luck. I ended up calling her "Nyx" which in Greek origins meant "night." I found it fitting due to her black fur and the way she would stalk silently throughout the house. 



Only a couple of days had passed into the first week and things had went well. Just by seeing a glimpse of Nyx's slender, black tail swishing in the corner of my eyes brought a warmth to flick up the corners of my heart, and with everyday I found myself admiring the cat that always seemed to bubble with heinous amounts of energy. Perhaps that was why I started to notice things becoming strange. 


The first time something seemed strange I found myself sat on the couch, zoning off at the flicker of the TV screen before me. All was silent inside the house besides the quiet, almost incomprehensible murmurs of voices coming from the TV and the calm sound of my own breath leaving my mouth at a slow, relaxed pace. 


That was until I could hear something coming from inside the kitchen. 


"*Hrmph*" 


It sounded throaty, like a grunt, lowered in a tone so low it seemed impossible to recreate. It was subtle, very subtle, but I heard it through the slight pause the murmurs took on the screen before me. I never once took a second to think, I only stood up and started to head towards the kitchen, which was just to my right. 


Sullen golden light danced throughout the house, dancing fluently up the walls in a amber haze, every room besides the *kitchen.* I stopped inside the door frame of the kitchen, looking around inside. The room was pitch black, not a shred of light or a subtle outline of anything stationed inside the kitchen. My hand poked around the door frame to flick on the light, and when the blazing, bright light burst inside the room, I could feel my heart drop. 


Nyx stood in the centre of the room on the floor. *Standing.* She stood bolt right on her hind legs, her front paws stretched out before her like she was reaching for something that couldn't be seen by the naked eye. Her eyes were wide, her pupils shrunk to the point they were only the tiniest, black specks. The usual cerulean colour of her eyes seemed dull, glazed over as no light shone inside those dark, ominous eyes. 


As soon as the light burst into the room...



*Nyx immediately returned to normal.* 



Almost like a flash of blinding, white light, the cat stared at me with bright, curious eyes. I could feel the shock cascading down upon me violently, almost like heavy droplets of rain that froze my body to its very core, and I could feel the hairs on my arms starting to rise. I couldn't tear my eyes away from Nyx, who sat with all of her paws on the floor, her small head tilting to the side as she stared at me. 


"What-- what are you doing in here?" I stammered out the words without my consent, my voice only a weak whisper. 


Nyx's head immediately perked up as I spoke, the shining gleams inside her eyes glowing brighter. And that was when she let out a quiet, subtle meow. 


I could feel the way my heart squeezed ferociously tight, icy blades piercing each and every part of my skin, numbing every feeling I could once feel. It didn't sound high pitched, a tone that sounded so light that if you listened hard enough, you could make out what emotion the cat felt. It was deep, rough, like the screeching of bark against the sleek silver of metal. *Exactly* the same sound I had heard coming from the kitchen. 


My body was completely frozen, my breath hitched inside my throat and it felt like every part of my body had just-- stopped. I couldn't feel my own shock, the coldness or the horror that washed over me, i could only stare wide eyed at the cat before me. 


It was only when Nyx slowly walked up towards me, brushing herself against my legs lovingly, did I find myself melting back into reality. 


On the first day that something strange happened, I immediately brushed it off. Why? Well, I never seemed to convince myself that Nyx's deep meow was nothing to be concerned about--regardless of how eerie it was. "It's just her unique sound." I told myself repeatedly, "there's nothing worrying about it." I reassured myself, although my inner voice was completely and utterly wrong. 


Things only started to get worse.


Nyx's behaviour started to change. Her usual, enthusiastic and sociable nature abruptly flatlined into something dull, her tiny self nowhere to be seen. *Nowhere.* I'd check each and every square inch of the house and not once could I find her--until-- she was the one coming to *find* me.


The tiny shadow of her body started to flicker against the walls, illuminated casually through the dim light plaguing the house. Overtime her body started to grow, becoming larger, taller. Her front limbs started to stretch further in length than her hind legs, almost a foot longer, and she had grown to the point that she was six feet tall. 


I always thought that my mind was just playing tricks on me. Come on, it's just a shadow, right? Besides, Nyx was hiding off somewhere, she would've made a sound if she was close by. Oh, how I wish I wasn't so naive back then, If I hadn't, I wouldn't be writing this right now. 


With the grueling appearance of that shadow came the sound of--something. It always sounded distant, always sounding like a "*brrr*" or  a "*urghh*" a mix between a deep grunt, a groan, or an eerie screech that was definitely inhumane. With those sounds, I could always hear something almost silent, but there in sync with the sounds...


*TapTap*tapTap*tapTap* 


It came from everywhere inside the house. Not only did I hear sounds, I started to feel overly worried, completely paranoid. My eyes would dart back and forth all around the house, my guard would be up constantly and I'd jump at the tiniest noise or movement. No matter what, it felt like I was *always* being watched. As the first week finally came to and end, I couldn't take it anymore.


 I remember I found myself walking through the house searching each and every room, corner, gap and crevice for Nyx. I hadn't seen her anywhere, nor has she drank any of the food or water I had set out for her. 


I found myself looking for her everyday. 


I watched as the walls of my hallway blurred before me as I rushed down the hall, starting to check the only two rooms there. There was the bathroom and the bedroom opposite eachother, but I didn't need to check both as I could hear something coming from my bedroom-- 


*Thud* 


It was loud, the sheer force of the impact rocketing off the walls so it echoed throughout the house, and I could feel myself flinch viciously at the sudden sound. As my eyes darted towards my room door, which was wide open revealing nothing besides the darkness inside, a familiar feeling flushed over me. *Dread* 


My heart clenched tightly, starting to hammer against my ribcage violently like the sheer force of a thunderbird, trying to free itself from the fleshy chamber of my heart, spread out it's glamorous feathery wings, only to fly away and start to become only a dot as it sinks into the horizon. 


"Nyx?" I heard myself speak involuntarily, voice clear despite how scared I sounded. 


...


Silence. 


It was like the cold had started to turn rough, the temperature starting to drop so low it became freezing--Not once did I notice-- I could only feel the rapid beat of my heart piling through my ears. I couldn't think--i couldn't feel-- I could only walk. 


*Walk... Right into the room.*


"It's so nice of you to join me." Something spoke inside the darkness, a voice so deep it was the definition of something almost demonic. 


My head swung everywhere around the room, eyes scattering, lines in the darkness blurring as I looked frantically for something. I couldn't think, I could only act. Eventually, a light revealed *what* had spoken inside the dark. 


Crimson light delicately flared around the room, extremely dull, but just enough to see what exactly *it* was I was facing. 


The shadow I saw of Nyx on the walls laid on the bed before me. *Real.* Her once tiny lower jaw was slackened, stretched out one foot from where her upper jaw remained still. Rows of sharp, ragged yellow teeth shone sickenly inside the glow of red. Her mouth stretched as far up the cheeks it could go, stopping only when the ends of the mouth were a mere inch away from the start of the ears. An empty, dark hole replaced one of her eyes, while the other eyes dangled from its socket. Something red, fleshy attached itself to the back of the eye, dangling down and swinging slowly from side to side just before her lips. 


Her body was contorted, twisted in various sickening, horrific angles I could feel the bile morphing rapidly inside my throat. Her neck was cranked to the side, her elbows facing towards me, her hind legs bent in various angles, broken. *Inhuman.* 


This... Couldn't be real. There was no way I was actually facing this-- monster-- this creature. I couldn't feel a thing. Not the way I swallowed the bile forming in my throat, the way my body was rigid, frozen in place. Not the way my entire body started to tremble harshly, the way goosebumps covered me everywhere or the pure horror that plunged upon me. *Drowning* me underneath it's vast, heavy pressure. 


"You... Aren't real..." I whispered out, my sentence trailing off, words escaping me without my control. 


I watched as the creatures head slowly turned to the side, the dangling eye violently swinging from side to side as it just... Stared at me. 


"But, I am. I'm right here," It started to speak, it's voice slightly cracking, as if it was upset. "I thought we were friends? You and I, me and you." 


I couldn't steer my eyes away from the creature, I was transfixed. At those words, something inside of me clicked. *Words.*



*"You should know--"*

...


..


*"It isn't what it appears to be."* 


I knew from that moment that the entire time, I got warned of the very *thing* laying on my bed before me. This wasn't a figment of my own imagination. It was real. 


"I was friends with my *cat.*" I mumbled out without thinking, and the creature let out a heavy, ominous chuckle. 


"Don't be silly, do you not remember? *I* am you're cat. Nyx." It's voice simmered down into a low, intimidating whisper as it spoke. 


I could hear the sound of gut wrenching crackling as the creature moved before me, slowly getting closer to me. I couldn't move, but I knew that I needed too. Whatever this was it was no ordinary being-- *it was a curse from the fiery pits of Hell itself.* 


"Your no cat. Your a monster." As I spoke the creature before me abruptly froze. 


It remained motionless, and silence thickened the once ever so lively room. I stared into the huge, gaping hole where one of the creatures eyes used to be, obliviousous to the way the air seemed to fill with a dense, sinister feeling. 


"How dare you, all I have given you is love, care. And this... This is how you repay me?--" 


"What are you... What do you want?" I spoke over the creature as it started to speak. 


Silence. 


I could only stare into the void of *its* eyes. And it stared right back at *me.* The creature before me started to move again, it's grotesque, mortifying face drawing closer to mines. 


"I want to with you--" 


...


..


"*Forever*"


...


..



All I could remember since that moment was the millions of lines that blurred my vision-- the sound of soles smacking against wooden tiles-- a booming, ear plicing screech-- frantic, heavy breathing and frightened wheezes stringing through the air sharply-- 


And now... I find myself here. 


In the middle of the woods. I'm surrounded everywhere with trees and I'm shaking, so, so badly. I can barely breathe, my breath isn't coming out of my throat even when I try force it out by coughing. I might not remember what happened, all I know is that I ran. And here, in the middle of the woods, I hope that it won't *find* me. 


If anyone finds this and reads this, if there is no more updates, then I'm most likely dead. No. I will be dead. Whatever that was... It's no human. It's no soul. It's no spirit...


*It's the spawn of Satan himself.* 


You may think that my story is a complete hoax, and I would too. Shit-- of course I fucking would. Just know this, I would trade absolutely anything-- *anything* -- for this to be all just one massive, fucked up fantasy tale. Some shitty little horror story you'd find anywhere and everywhere on the internet. 


But... It's not. 


I wish that I could've lived a good life. I wish that I hadn't pushed the people I care about away. I wish I hadn't hurt strangers, the people that cared about me. I wish I was there for the people who were always there for me, I wish I didn't care about me, *myself* only. 


I've been alone for years, since high school. Since the moment I moved out of my parents home, and the moment I lost *everything.* It's now that I realise how truly worthless I am. I didn't achieve anything in this fucked up life except harming other people, abusing people who cared-- and people who didn't. The people who do that, I know realise, are the scum of the scum. 


People who deserve *nothing.* 


It made so much sense now. Maybe... This is what my fate was. I've lived life without ever appreciating anything, and the entire time... I was blind to my own actions, how cruel-- how much I have sinned. 





I'm sorry. I hope somebody, somewhere reads this. I promise that this isn't some fucked up hoax--



---------------




*Snap* 



My eyes immediately raised up from my phone screen, frantically scattering everywhere. Nothing but darkness swept, large, thick silhouettes of tree trunks outlined in the dark. As soon as I was about to calm down, I could feel something against the back of my neck. A slow, hot breeze scorching my skin. The *breath* of someone behind me, getting more intense, shrinking every fibre of my body.


No. Not someone...



*Something.*
