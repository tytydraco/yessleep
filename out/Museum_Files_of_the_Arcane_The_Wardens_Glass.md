The package was heavier than I expected. It sat on the worktable in front of me, wrapped in a layer of brittle, brown parchment that smelled faintly of mildew and old varnish, with a wax seal—red, chipped, official-looking—stamped on the front. *For the attention of Magdalene Driscoll,* written in the small, careful script of someone who doesn’t want their name connected to this delivery. I traced the address with my thumb, feeling a prickle of excitement.

The museum was quiet, colder than usual, with that familiar smell of dust, varnish, and the ever-present tang of metal from the displays around me. All around, cases of glass and steel stood like silent, forgotten sentinels in the dim light, each one filled with relics of another age—half-melted candle molds, tarnished sextants, peculiar tools that looked like they’d been assembled from spare parts in someone’s attic. I heard the creak of the floorboards settle and imagined the exhibits behind me listening as I worked.

A message from Tamsin had arrived earlier that day, her voice crackling over the line as if her words were being dragged through static. Tamsin held a Ph.D. in Industrial Archaeology, specializing in 19th-century mechanical innovations and esoteric technology. Her research focused on unconventional inventors who operated on the fringes of Victorian science, particularly those whose inventions blurred the lines between science, art, and the occult. She liked to call it "studying dead men’s toys," which never failed to annoy purists.

"Hey, Maggie! Just wanted to give you a heads-up," Tamsin had said, sounding more animated than usual. "Remember that inventor we talked about—Winslow? Well, guess what? A journal of his just surfaced, full of sketches and notes on his inventions. I thought of you right away! It's on its way over now—you’re going to love it."

I’d laughed it off then, but now, sitting alone with the package, I felt a sliver of apprehension. The stillness pressed in as I peeled back the parchment, revealing an old leather-bound journal underneath, its edges worn and cracked. I ran my hand over the cover, which felt almost soft, as though it had been handled by a hundred hands before mine.

The first page crackled as I opened it, and a musty, almost sweet scent puffed up—a mix of faded ink, dried paper, and something else, something metallic, like old blood. My fingers tingled as I turned the page, and there, in thick, dark strokes of ink, was the name: *Ivor Winslow, 1829*.

A thrill ran through me. I’d heard of Winslow, that much was true. Unlike the textbook names of other inventors, though, Winslow was known only to a select few—a shadowy figure referenced in half-forgotten papers and obscure footnotes among those in the field. Tamsin and I had laughed over rumors of his work—devices that supposedly let you “see beyond the veil,” things people claimed let you peer into other realms, glimpse spirits. It was all nonsense, but this… this journal made it feel solid, real. Winslow’s words sat heavy on the page, a warning as much as an invitation.

***Journal Entry, 7th February, 1829***

*At last, I have refined the diagrams for what I now denominate The Warden’s Glass, a contrivance designed to unveil the hidden substrata beneath the human countenance; to pierce the common veil and afford a glimpse into the architecture which, I am convinced, courses beneath the surface of mortal flesh. This apparatus, if assembled to the precise specifications I have delineated, may permit the wearer to behold not merely the tissue of our corporeal form but that elusive quintessence which lingers therein, half-visible yet wholly inscrutable.*

*The device itself demands the placement of two primary lenses—one convex, one concave—set within a brass frame that holds them at a separation exact to a quarter of an inch; such a distance has proven critical, for without it, the apparatus serves merely to magnify the mere superficies, yielding naught but an ordinary amplification. My initial trials, I regret to note, yielded only this, much to my chagrin; I shall not soon forget the unfortunate episode involving the dissection of a housecat, whose secrets were, alas, not laid bare by the preliminary lenses.*

*Further, I have introduced a third lens, set obliquely, and treated with a thin coating of silver nitrate—a substance which, I surmise, shall act as a filter for those more spectral elements which lie dormant to the unassisted eye. This treatment, I hypothesize, shall lend to the viewer a rarefied perception, one that transcends the bounds of mere organic scrutiny and hints at the immaterial. I have yet to comprehend fully the nature of this spectral substratum, though in prior observations, I have beheld faint vapours—fleeting emanations—particularly around those in the final throes of life, and, in one instance, upon a cadaver but hours deceased.*

*Yet, even as I commit these particulars to paper, there emerges within me a sensation not solely of elation but of something altogether more severe, as if some primeval warning lingers at the fringes of consciousness. The phrase, To see what lives beneath, haunts my thoughts incessantly, suggesting more than mere flesh or sinew; it alludes to an uncharted realm that may lie upon the precipice of the observable, awaiting its own dreadful unveiling.*

*There remains upon this very page a faint smear, left from an earlier accident in the course of the experiment; it is a smudge of blood, thin and dried, mingled with the residue of silver nitrate—a token, as it were, of the very boundary I seek to cross. Blood, yes; yet blood is but the beginning, the primal fluid from which my investigations must spring, leading me down that path where substance yields, finally, to essence.*

*To-morrow, I shall resume these trials, urged forth by a conviction both unrelenting and yet laced with apprehension, as though bound by some spectral thread; it tugs, invisible yet undeniable, drawing me onward into shadows where no man has ventured and whence no man may return unscathed.*

I turned the page, feeling the brittle edge scratch lightly against my thumb; a faint itch surfaced at the bridge of my nose, and I scratched it absently, my eyes falling once more upon Winslow’s neat, precise script. The ink looked darker here, almost oily, sinking into the parchment with an unsettling intensity. The next entry lay before me, waiting. I took a steadying breath.

***Journal Entry, 15th February, 1829***

*The apparatus, now augmented with certain modifications, has yielded the most extraordinary results; indeed, what I have observed may strain credulity, yet it must be recorded with the utmost fidelity, for the sake of both science and posterity. Upon this day, I dared to engage The Warden’s Glass upon a human subject—none other than myself—and thus set forth to test whether my theories held substance or were mere phantasmagoria borne of fevered ambition.*

*At first, there was naught but an unsettling disquiet, as if I had peered through a dense mist; shapes appeared, nebulous and indistinct, floating at the periphery of vision. I adjusted the lenses with trembling fingers, aligning them precisely; a curious vertigo ensued, a spinning sensation, brief yet palpable, as though I had plummeted from some great height within my very soul.*

*Then, as the vertigo subsided, I beheld—oh, how shall I describe it?—an apparition, not wholly human, but a shade of myself, clinging to the contours of my face, my hands, my form; it seemed a dark mirror of flesh, pale as death, as though some ghastly double had emerged from within, lurking beneath the skin. There were my eyes, yet hollowed and glistening with a malign intelligence not my own; there were my hands, twisted and elongated, as if stretched by unseen forces to an unnatural shape. This other self regarded me with an expression so dark, so hideously knowing, that a thrill of terror ran through my frame.*

*Yet, the spectacle did not end here; the vision grew stranger, still more grotesque, and I perceived upon my limbs faint trails—pale, winding veins—pulsing not with the warmth of blood but with a thin, sickly light; it traced across my skin as though some inner fire burned weakly within, struggling for release. These veins converged upon my heart, which throbbed visibly beneath the Glass, as if yearning to break free of its bony cage. Indeed, I swear I saw it, my heart itself, beating with a sickly rhythm and tinged with a hue I dare not name; it seemed a creature alive unto itself, malicious, hungry, and ever-watchful.*

*Such was the horror of this vision that I was compelled to tear the Glass from my face, lest I descend fully into madness. My breath came in short, gasping bursts, my hands numb with fright; it was as though I had glimpsed some heretofore hidden world, one that exists beneath our every waking moment, unknown to us, and yet profoundly, horribly real.*

*I write these words with trembling hand, for I know not what next I shall uncover should I continue these trials; yet I am driven by a force I scarcely comprehend, an unquenchable thirst to understand the dark inner workings of our being. There is something—some force or essence—that dwells within each of us, some shadow-self that lurks beyond perception, ever present, and I am determined to unearth it, though it cost me my reason, or my very soul.*

*Tomorrow, I shall endeavor to increase the refractive power of the lenses, to deepen the magnification, and perhaps unveil that which lies even further beneath; for there are layers upon layers yet unexplored, and I feel compelled to venture into these unfathomed depths, however treacherous they may prove.*

*May these notes serve as testament to my efforts, and as a warning to any who may follow; for there is, I suspect, a price to such knowledge, one that has already begun its dark toll upon me.*

I checked my watch—10:42 p.m. Just about time to pack up, call it a night and head home. That was the logical thing to do, of course, but the thought came and went like smoke, barely registering. I was stuck here, rooted to the spot with the journal practically pulling me in. The brittle pages caught the dim light in a way that dared me to leave it unfinished, to abandon Winslow and whatever strange things he’d uncovered. Instead, I turned another page, my pulse picking up.

My eyes landed on his sketches, meticulous and exact. He’d drawn out the *Warden’s Glass*—lenses sketched in sharp detail, measurements scrawled along the sides like the work of a man in a hurry. Below were lists of chemical compounds he’d tried, with a line or two about their “effects on perception,” in a mix of English and Latin that seemed to straddle the line between science and something close to mysticism. 

**Tinctura Salis Nitri**

* **Description**: A tincture derived from purified *sal nitrum* (saltpeter), thrice distilled in a copper alembic; proportioned as 3 drams saltpeter to 1 drachm copper. Purported to “steady the pulse and prepare the nerves for heightened vision.”
* **Dosage**: 12 drops, administered upon the tongue ere the handling of the *Warden’s Glass*.
* **Observation**: “Observed upon trial—a mild clarity of thought, yet tingling persists at the extremities. Requires further refinement.”
* **Latin Notation**: *Per visum maiorem, sed cum tremore* (For greater sight, but with trembling).

**Vapor Mercurii Sublimati in Vinum Plumbum**

* **Description**: A mist derived from calomel (mercury chloride) vapor, suspended in lead-infused wine at a ratio of 2:1 (wine to calomel); believed to “illuminate hidden recesses within the flesh.”
* **Application**: Inhaled sparingly ere observation. Caution advised, as mercury’s influence upon the constitution is known to be deleterious.
* **Observation**: “First trials reveal a subtle brightening in perception, though a dull ache ensues. Mild unease follows.”
* **Latin Notation**: *In corpore visio, tenebrae patent* (In the body, vision opens to shadows).

**Pulvis Lapidis Philosophi, admixtus cum Oleo Absinthii**

* **Description**: A powdered facsimile of the *lapis philosophorum* (Philosopher’s Stone), created through pulverizing native sulfur with oil of absinthe in a ratio of 3 to 1. Purported to sharpen the mental faculties to an extraordinary degree.
* **Dosage**: A small pinch upon the tongue, not to be administered more than twice per fortnight.
* **Observation**: “Immediate effect—awareness heightens, with a ‘second sight,’ though evanescent; faint illusions present to the mind.”
* **Latin Notation**: *Per lumen infernum lumen celatur* (Through infernal light, hidden light is revealed).

**Elixirum Fulmini, Miscere cum Spiritu Terebinthi**

* **Description**: A volatile admixture of spirits of turpentine with tincture of fulminated silver, at a ratio of 3 scruples turpentine to 1 scruple silver. Said to “cleanse the ocular sphere, removing impurities in sight.”
* **Application**: Applied delicately about the eyes using a cloth; vapor inhaled at a distance.
* **Observation**: “Excessive luminance detected in immediate vision, though violent throbbing persisted until following day.”
* **Latin Notation**: *Oculi aperti, cor videt* (Eyes open, heart sees).

**Pulvis Stramonii cum Lacte de Belladonna**

* **Description**: A powder derived from dried thorn apple (*Stramonium*), mixed with an extract of belladonna at a ratio of 2 grains to 1 grain respectively. Purported to allow perception of “phantasmal entities.”
* **Dosage**: A pinch stirred into water or wine, taken with sustenance to avert any ill humors.
* **Observation**: “Pupils dilate; slight euphoria, accompanied by mild hallucinations of forms obscured by shadow.”
* **Latin Notation**: *In somnis, veritas occulta* (In dreams, hidden truth).

**Essentia Aetheris Aquae Regiae**

* **Description**: An essence distilled from *aqua regia* with an admixture of ether, in a proportion of 5 parts *aqua regia* to 1 part ether. Said to unveil that which “lies beneath the flesh.”
* **Dosage**: To be inhaled directly from the bottle, not to exceed three breaths.
* **Observation**: “Dangerous in excess; a potent elixir causing immediate vertigo and narrowness of vision. Fleeting effect, to be used sparingly.”
* **Latin Notation**: *Corpus mutatur, anima apparet* (The body changes, the soul appears).



Winslow’s notes showed a fervor that bordered on obsession; he outlined doses, mixtures, ratios, specifics so precise they were almost unnerving. The parchment held dark stains—residue from his experiments, or maybe just the ink reacting to the years.

Then I hit the next entry, and immediately, the tone shifted. The ink was darker, almost pressed into the paper with a weight that practically dripped frustration—or fear. I took a breath, feeling a chill creep up my arms, and read on.

***Journal Entry, 22nd February, 1829***

*It is with great dismay, mingled with some measure of indignation, that I pen today’s account, for my recent revelations concerning the Warden’s Glass have met with scorn and derision among those I once counted as both colleagues and friends. The very mention of my observations—the vision of that dark being, that infernal double I beheld through the lens—was met with laughter, outright mirth, as if I were a common charlatan recounting tales of phantoms and spirits to gullible children. Even Dr. Abner Hollis, whom I had regarded as a mind of singular curiosity, dismissed my findings as fanciful delusion, urging me to “rest” and “let the fever pass.”*

*There is but one, Mr. Roderick Elwood, whose ear was inclined toward my words with more than passing interest; indeed, he listened as I recounted my ordeal with a silent intensity, his gaze fixed, thoughtful, as though he too had once glimpsed into some dark crevice of the soul. Mr. Elwood, a fellow student of optics and physiology, is a man of sober mind and unyielding curiosity; he has spent many years in the examination of light and refraction, often proposing theories both strange and inspired, yet rooted always in science and logic. At my behest, he agreed to come to my laboratory, to view himself through the Warden’s Glass and see if my account held merit.*

*Upon his arrival, I noted a strange solemnity upon his countenance, as though he approached some sacred rite. I placed the Glass in his hands, noting with satisfaction his careful grip upon the device, his movements precise and respectful, for he understood the nature of invention, of risk. When he at last held the lenses before his eyes, I waited, scarcely daring to breathe, as he peered into his own reflection, his gaze unwavering.*

*Yet, as the moments passed, his expression remained impassive, unmoved; indeed, his features betrayed no trace of horror nor recognition of that shadow-self I had glimpsed so vividly. At length, he removed the Glass and regarded me with a bemused smile, expressing no horror, no dread, but instead a mild disappointment; he claimed to have seen nothing untoward, nothing to suggest the “revelations” I had described with such fervor. He suggested, perhaps too kindly, that my vision had been the product of fatigue or nervous excitation, and recommended I abandon the apparatus for a time, lest it lead me further astray.*

*This revelation—this failure—has left me at once baffled and resentful, for it suggests that the Glass reveals not to all but only to certain eyes, or perhaps certain souls.*

*I am loath to abandon my inquiries, for in them I sense some deeper truth—a truth both terrible and irrevocable. Tomorrow, I shall proceed with another trial, perhaps upon a third party or upon some creature devoid of reason, that I may discern whether this apparition is unique to me alone. Let this entry serve as both testament and warning, for should my findings reveal some singular corruption within my person, I know not what end awaits me, save one of horror.*

I really should’ve been heading home by now; this journal wasn’t paying my overtime. Winslow’s journal had me in a strange grip, as if the lines of ink themselves were threads, winding tighter and tighter around me. I pulled the lamp closer, allowing the warm pool of light to spill across the worn pages, and I turned to the next entry with a growing sense of anticipation.

***Journal Entry, 24th February, 1829***

*To any who might follow my steps through these pages, let this entry serve as a testament to the precarious and beguiling path upon which I now tread. Today, I conducted my latest trial with the Warden’s Glass, and I am yet shaken by the result, unable to decide if the vision I beheld is truth or some horrid delusion crafted by a fevered mind.*

*Having resolved to test the apparatus upon another, I enlisted the company of Mr. Leopold Grant—a figure of some notoriety within the town and not unfamiliar to those versed in local gossip. Accused, albeit never convicted, of unspeakable acts against a woman and child, Grant remains a shadowed presence in our community, a man cloaked in accusations, though no judge’s gavel has ever fallen against him. Despite his standing, I confess a fascination with his intellect, for he speaks with an eloquence that belies the baser rumors surrounding him; his discourse is, in fact, often compelling, with insights that I might describe as mordant, even penetrating, if not for the faint whiff of arrogance which always accompanies his speech.*

*Mr. Grant is a man of many convictions, particularly in matters of social order and the so-called "rights" of mankind. He regards the world, as he put it in our discussions today, as “a vast tapestry wherein each thread is not woven by man, but dictated by nature’s own hand.” A peculiar view, yet I found myself reluctantly compelled by his arguments, for he spoke with such fervor on the inherent hierarchy of all living beings, on the natural superiority of the “enlightened few,” that for a moment, I found myself nodding in unthinking assent. It is a view, I must admit, that grows more common in our age—this conviction that certain men are fated for greatness, while others are destined to serve. Such beliefs disturb me; yet, in Mr. Grant’s company, I confess I felt strangely willing to listen.*

*It was with no small sense of foreboding, therefore, that I handed him the Warden’s Glass, knowing his nature but curious to observe if he, too, might glimpse his inner form as I had. I prepared a dose of Tinctura Salis Nitri, administering twelve drops upon his tongue precisely as prescribed. He accepted the tincture without protest, though I noted his lip curled slightly at the bitterness; still, his gaze remained fixed upon the Glass with a peculiar intensity, as though he anticipated some spectacle or revelation unique to himself.*

*At last, he held the lenses to his eyes, his features poised in cold anticipation. I watched him carefully, scarcely daring to breathe as he peered into his reflection, his gaze unwavering, his form statuesque, and his lips set into a thin line of contemplation. The silence stretched between us, thick as a shroud, and I waited for some flicker of recognition to pass over his face.*

*But it was I—not he—who beheld the horror.*

*Through the Glass, I caught sight of his reflection, twisted and blackened, a shadow-self that I dare scarcely describe; for in his visage I beheld not mere flesh, but a mask of malice, as if his inner being had warped his features into a grotesque semblance of humanity. His eyes, dark as pitch, seemed to absorb the light, drawing it inward to feed some monstrous emptiness within; his mouth curled into a smile, but it was a grimace of hollow triumph, a sneer stretched tight as if over bone. The flesh about his throat bore dark lines, winding like chains, as though some inner violence had left its imprint upon his very spirit.*

*I struggled to remain calm, to keep my face impassive, though every nerve in my body urged me to recoil. Mr. Grant lowered the Glass, glancing toward me with a faint expression of curiosity. “Is all well, Mr. Winslow?” he inquired, his voice low and untroubled. For a moment, I stood rooted to the spot, fighting the urge to confess the vision that had chilled me to my marrow.*

*But no words came. Instead, I forced a smile—weak, strained—and assured him all was well, that the Glass was simply an instrument, nothing more. He seemed satisfied with my answer, his mouth twitching into that familiar, unsettling smirk as he handed the Glass back to me, remarking idly that he “had hoped to see something truly remarkable.”*

*And thus, I let him go, saying nothing, betraying nothing, though my mind shrieked with horror at what I had beheld. I should have told him, should have confessed my vision, for he deserves, at the very least, to know the depths of his own corruption; yet, perhaps cowardice or some lingering fascination stayed my tongue. Even now, I cannot shake the image from my mind, nor can I fathom why the Glass should reveal such horrors to my eyes alone.*

I stifled a yawn, rubbing my eyes and reminding myself that any sensible person would’ve left hours ago. But here I was, still anchored to Winslow’s strange, unsettling world. I’d gotten used to this, I suppose—staying long after everyone else had clocked out, losing myself in archives and journals, just as I’d done back in grad school. My old study partners used to make fun of me for it, always the last one hunched over some musty old book while they grabbed drinks. But they’d gotten lazy after a few years; most of them were happily cataloging exhibits or doing desk work now, their curiosity worn down to a dull nub. Maybe I wasn’t exactly Miss Popular, but if that’s what they thought it took to be “likable,” I didn’t care.

I flipped to the next page, feeling the spine shift strangely beneath my fingers—a bit heavier than the rest, a peculiar thickness at the back that I hadn’t noticed until now. I pressed a little, thinking I’d feel something odd beneath the leather cover, but nothing seemed amiss. Just the pages and that sense of old weight, dense and ominous in a way I couldn’t quite explain. Maybe it was just my mind playing tricks on me, tired as I was, but it felt like the journal itself was pressing back, heavier somehow the deeper I got into Winslow’s entries.

Leaning into the lamp’s glow, I turned the page. The flicker of the light seemed to make the ink shift on the page, as though his words were still wet, fresh and almost alive. I took a breath, pushed my glasses up my nose, and read on, drawn in by that same strange, nagging pull.

***Journal Entry, 10th March, 1829***

*A fortnight has passed since the night of Mr. Leopold Grant’s visit, and I find myself gripped by an unease that no science nor rational philosophy can dispel. The Glass, in its cold and indifferent clarity, has revealed a dreadful truth—one I had, until now, successfully cloaked in the comfort of denial. Leopold’s visage, that foul, contorted shade I glimpsed, was no fleeting mirage; it was, I am convinced, a manifestation of his true essence, made visible to me alone.*

*Yet, how did I fail to heed the warnings? The rumors of his alleged misdeeds have lingered about him for years, staining his reputation like a faint shadow one might dismiss in passing, but which clings persistently to the air. There were whispers of a woman, a child—of lives cut short by a silent hand and buried by the cruelty of indifference. He eluded judgment, defended by technicalities and the absence of witnesses, and emerged unscathed in the eyes of the law. And here I was, deceived by his charming eloquence, his wit, even his mind, so coldly rational yet disturbingly vibrant. It sickens me to think that I too might have been charmed into silence, lulled into complacency by my own foolishness.*

*No longer, however, will I rest on such foolish conceits. I have devised a plan to expose the truth, to force this revelation upon the eyes of others who, like myself, have failed to see the wolf among us. I shall host an evening gathering at my own residence, an affair of unusual festivity; and I shall invite a select company—those men and women I deem most respected within our society. This will be a congregation of the learned, the curious, and those of firmest moral standing, for I must secure witnesses of unquestionable judgment; only then can the weight of Leopold’s corruption be laid bare for all to behold.*

*I shall prepare carefully, extending invitations to each guest with utmost discretion, lest the nature of my purpose be misconstrued. I have chosen them with utmost care; there is Dr. Abner Hollis, once a friend, whose skeptical eyes may lend credence to the spectacle I shall unveil, though he regards me now, I believe, with disdain. There is Mrs. Lavinia Crawley, a woman of high social standing, outwardly prim yet keen for the private scandal; perhaps she will delight in the unmasking of our mutual friend. Mr. Edward Salloway shall be among them, a man of inflexible conviction and a strict adherent to logic, whose presence shall serve as a bulwark against any claims of exaggeration or hysteria. And there is Miss Eleanor Finch, an artist of prodigious skill, whose temperament is both studious and unafraid, a woman with a keen eye for shadow.*

*The invitations have been sent, and I have taken pains to craft them in a manner both cordial and mysterious, hinting at a grand spectacle which might arouse their curiosity. Though I am seldom one to host gatherings, I trust that the unusual nature of this event, combined with their intrigue in my scientific pursuits, shall draw them here.*

***17th March, 1829***

*The night of the gathering has come and gone, and I am yet in a state of agitation, a turmoil so profound I scarcely know how to order my thoughts upon this page.*

*They arrived in finery, exchanging pleasantries in the candlelit corridors of my home; I greeted each with cordiality, concealing the quiet dread that gnawed at the edge of my mind. Leopold was among the last to arrive, sauntering in with that insufferable air of familiarity, as though he and I were kin of the closest order. He clasped my hand, a broad, arrogant smile spread across his face, and I felt a shudder seize me, an impulse to pull away, to banish him from my sight; yet I smiled, swallowing the disgust that welled within me.*

*Wine flowed freely, and soon laughter and the low hum of conversation filled the rooms; yet beneath it all, a tension simmered, invisible to all but myself. I waited until the hour was late and their spirits sufficiently loosened before making my suggestion—that we adjourn to the lower chambers where my laboratory lay, for I had “a marvel” to show them.*

*They laughed, teased me as expected, yet curiosity won out, and they followed, descending into the dimly lit room where my apparatus awaited. The laboratory was arranged with deliberate care: the Warden’s Glass rested upon a velvet-draped pedestal, surrounded by vials and tinctures whose oils glimmered faintly in the gaslight, casting shadows that flickered against the walls. I had prepared the room as one might a stage, each object meticulously placed, each light angled to create an atmosphere both scientific and foreboding.*

*One by one, I offered them the Salis Nitri, observing with satisfaction as each obligingly took a measured dose; I administered the preparations carefully, precisely as before, knowing that any deviation might compromise the outcome. As each guest took their turn peering into the Glass, I noted with relief that their reflections remained untainted, their forms unchanged; they laughed, finding nothing to remark upon save for a faint dizziness from the tincture’s effects.*

*Finally, it was Leopold’s turn. Yet no sooner had I extended the vial than he declined, laughing as he waved it away. “I have tasted your draught once, Winslow,” he jested, “and I see little need to subject myself again.” His voice, dripping with casual insolence, made my blood pound hotly, yet I forced myself to maintain composure, coaxing him with gentle persistence. He continued to resist, and the others began to laugh at my insistence, though I sensed a flicker of hesitation in his eyes—a trace of something that only deepened my resolve.*

*Before I could press further, a clumsy guest—young Mr. Pettinger, the son of a local magistrate and entirely inebriated—stumbled forward, declaring his eagerness to try the experiment once more. His heavy hand caught the edge of the pedestal; the Glass, my creation, my only means of revealing the truth, toppled to the floor with a sickening crash. In an instant, it shattered, shards of glass scattering across the stone, reflecting a dozen fractured images of my horrified face.*

*Rage surged within me, a torrent so fierce I feared it might consume me utterly. I scarcely remember how I ushered them out, my voice tight, my gestures sharp and unkind. Leopold gave me one last smirk as he left, a look that seared itself into my mind, mocking me, taunting me with the knowledge he had escaped yet again. As the door closed behind the last of them, I stood alone in the darkened room, staring at the remnants of my work, a hollow emptiness settling within me.*

*Yet beneath the emptiness, a darker impulse stirs, a heat that I cannot ignore. I find my mind drifting to thoughts of vengeance, to the image of my hands wrapped around a throat, squeezing, feeling the life drain slowly away. I see it as clearly as I see the room before me: Leopold’s face, contorted in shock, in pain, in horror as I exact upon him the justice he has evaded for too long.*

I closed the journal with a slow, steadying breath, feeling that prickling chill on the back of my neck, the kind that keeps its hold long after the lights go on. Winslow’s words were a trap I was willingly stepping into, deeper and deeper with every page. My shift had ended ages ago—but the idea of going home felt so…trivial. The museum was empty, quiet, and as always during these hours - rare as they are besides occasions such as this one - I liked it that way. The silence wrapped around me like a wool coat, somehow making Winslow’s twisted little world feel all the more real.

I got up, stretched, and wandered down the dim corridors, looking at the exhibits I’d walked past hundreds of times without a second thought. There were glass cases of polished brass instruments, faded maps, and fragments of machines that once hummed and clanked in some distant past, their usefulness as dead as their makers. Some pieces reminded me of that strange mix of people you meet in school—the ones who can’t leave the past alone, whose lives revolve around dusty artifacts, more comfortable with objects than with people. I’d been one of those, too. Still was, I guess.

I thought about the things Winslow had written, the strange way he seemed so formal, so poised, even while talking about horrific things. And yet, the cold detachment didn’t make it any less unsettling; if anything, it made him sound even more unhinged. Like he saw the world through a lens the rest of us weren’t privy to, and that lens wasn’t showing him anything pleasant.

Funny, though. The more I read, the more I could almost understand him. Winslow was someone you’d see wandering the library stacks at university, the one who barely looked at you, who muttered to himself like no one else was there. I’d known people like that. Hell, I’d *been* people like that. Lost in their work, their little pockets of esoteric knowledge, and wrapped so tightly in themselves they couldn’t connect with anyone else. Not that I’d had a huge circle of friends to begin with. They’d called me abrasive, prickly, or “too blunt.” Like that was somehow my problem.

But I’d never cared for the small talk, the endless cups of coffee over gossip about professors or breakups. Too many of them were just waiting for life to get started, like there was some grand event right around the corner. I’d found comfort in the straightforward nature of things like this museum. Artifacts don’t disappoint; they just…are. Just like Winslow’s journal, fixed and constant in its quiet horror.

I wandered past an old brass astrolabe, its darkened surface polished smooth by god knows how many hands, and caught a glimpse of myself reflected in the glass—a little older, maybe, and definitely tired, but the same me that stared back at people a little too directly. 

My mind wandered back to Winslow’s “*Nitre Tincture*” and the mad certainty in his words as he described his plan. The image of his guests in the cold light of his laboratory, not knowing they were about to witness something…something awful. I could almost picture him, adjusting the Glass with one hand, trying to hide his disgust for Leopold with the other. The man had ambition, I’d give him that. And even though he was bordering on deranged, there was something satisfying in seeing him out to prove everyone wrong. That sense of triumph over the ones who doubt you, who turn up their noses at what you know.

After a while, I made my way back to the journal, a little clearer, ready to get lost in it again.

***Journal Entry, 29th March, 1829***

*The deed is done; there is no turning back now, and I write this account with hands steadied by grim purpose. Leopold Grant is dead—by my own hand, and by methods as precise and deliberate as any experiment. I have, at last, silenced the monster within him, though I am aware that in doing so, I may have awakened the same within myself.*

*I encountered him alone, in the shrouded hours between night and dawn, when the streets are silent and only shadows bear witness. I had observed his habits with meticulous care; he often took solitary walks at that hour, basking, no doubt, in the certainty of his impunity. I had prepared my tools—the tinctures and powders that would ensure a swift yet undeniable end, items familiar to my hand but now turned to a darker purpose.*

*Approaching him, I offered my cordial greeting, concealing within it the cold malice that had festered in my heart. He returned my address with that same smugness, that insufferable smile; and yet, even as he spoke, his words rang hollow to my ears. I felt as though the world had narrowed to the beat of his pulse, to the delicate arch of his throat, to the faint gleam of his breath hanging in the air. There, under that shadowed lamplight, I pressed the vial to his lips, insisting it was a draft to ease “the malaise of the spirit.” Ever arrogant, he accepted it without question, swallowing my poison as if it were merely another trifling amusement.*

*The effects were swift, as I knew they would be; his eyes widened, his hand clutched his chest, and he fell to his knees, gasping for air that would no longer serve him. I watched, transfixed, as he convulsed, the once-powerful limbs now twitching feebly, his voice reduced to a mere whimper. The darkness consumed him, and I observed each stage of his passing with a dispassion that frightened me more deeply than the act itself; it was as if I had stepped beyond mere morality, into a realm where justice was the only law.*

*I write these words not from guilt, for I feel none, but from a strange, lingering satisfaction. I have succeeded where the law and society failed. Let this entry stand as testament; he has paid for his sins in kind, and I, though damned, feel a purity in my actions, as though I have struck a balance between the shadows of this world and the light.*

I dropped the journal, my hands suddenly cold, trembling as if I’d touched something forbidden, unholy. Winslow’s words echoed in my mind—a confession. Cold-blooded, calculated murder. This journal wasn’t just a record of experiments; it was his dark, twisted diary, and I’d just read his final, damning entry.

As the book hit the table, something slipped out from between the pages, landing with a soft thud. A flat object, wrapped in parchment. So that’s what had been causing that strange weight shift. I hesitated, heart pounding, before reaching for it. I slid it out from the parchment, cautiously peeling back the layers as it began to glint under the light—a piece of glass, clear but with an almost unnatural shimmer.

Then it struck me. This wasn’t just any piece of glass. It was *the* Glass, a shard of Winslow’s infamous *Warden’s Glass*. Somehow, he’d saved a fragment, hidden it here. But why? He’d never intended for the journal to be found, or did he? Was this some deranged message left for anyone who might stumble upon it? A tool for... what exactly?

As I held it up, the glint caught my eye, refracting the light, casting odd reflections across the walls. I squinted, adjusting it, when something shifted in the glass. I blinked, my mind insisting I was seeing things, but there it was—a faint, twisted image staring back at me. My own face, but… wrong. My features were there, yes, but warped, malevolent, a grotesque reflection filled with a cold, wicked intelligence that wasn’t mine.

I gasped, dropping the glass instinctively; it sliced across my finger as it fell, and a sharp sting brought me back to reality. I watched in silence as a single drop of blood slid down my fingertip, hitting the table with a soft splatter. My breath hitched, relieved it hadn’t splashed onto the journal, as though preserving Winslow’s final words mattered more than the thin line of red beginning to stain my skin.

For a long moment, I just stood there, staring down at the shard on the floor. That face I’d seen—had it been my imagination? Or had Winslow left this glass behind intentionally, some silent invitation to see what he’d seen?
