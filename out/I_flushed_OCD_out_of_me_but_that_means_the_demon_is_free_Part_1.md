**Part I** - [Part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10pl61f/i_flushed_ocd_out_of_my_head_but_that_means_the/)

My name is Darryl, and I am the unluckiest man on Earth. That might sound facetious, but I mean it. Minor and major misfortunes have befallen me at every juncture of my life. Woe is me, right?

I truly believe that the darkness at the centre of the Universe must be to blame. Have you ever seen it? Do you know its face? I have nightmares about the blackness that governs us all.

Perhaps you think I’ve lost my marbles. What makes me so special? What astronomically bad luck have I endured?

I’m always unwell. I’ve lost count of the number of times that I’ve broken bones. I’ve been in *twenty-five*car crashes as a passenger, so my driving isn’t to blame. My relationships always end through unfortunate events, such as bad timing. A better-suited candidate is always chosen over me for promotions. I’ve lived in four different houses and suffered ten different floods.

Oh, and, to top it all off, I suffer from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Simon, as I often call him. *Simon says*. Get it? I amuse myself. Anyway, I was certainly shafted by the genetic lottery in that regard.

You can imagine, then, my surprise at actually winning something for the first time in my life. The Universe grinned wickedly. You see, it would transpire that my winning straw was, in fact, the *shortest*straw. My luck hadn’t changed at all.

“I beg your pardon?” I asked.

“You won a free trip to Aaron Colt’s island resort,” The group facilitator repeated. “All support group attendees were entered into a prize draw.”

“I’ve never heard of Aaron Colt,” I laughed.

“Me neither,” The lady replied. “But I’m sure the invitation will tell you more. Congratulations!”

The invitation only raised more questions. It read:

*Hello, lucky winner!*

*My name is Aaron Colt, and this ticket serves as admission to my private island. You are one of five fortunate guests. Here, you will be treated to an all-expenses-paid stay at my three-storey mansion on a beautiful, secluded isle. During your trip, I shall be offering the gift of freedom from mental disease.*

*Safe travels,*

*Aaron Colt*

Nobody had ever used the words ‘lucky’ or ‘fortunate’ to describe anything I’d said, done, or experienced. Winning something felt incredible. However, the fleeting feeling of elation was quickly replaced with distrust. *What game are you playing?* I asked the Universe.

I feared the answer to that question, but that didn’t deter me from packing my bags. I’d never won anything before. At some point in my life, something good had to happen, surely? That was what I told myself. Whatever the case, I was certain, knowing my luck, that the boat would capsize. I decided I’d probably never even make it to the island.

In hindsight, that would’ve been far less horrific than what actually happened.

The small ferry, aptly named *Lucky Lucy*, arrived at the harbour on a blisteringly-warm day in June, 2022. I boarded, along with four other anxious souls. We huddled together on the main deck and, having only exchanged awkward glances on the dock, finally introduced ourselves.

Emma was a forty-seven-year-old restaurant owner from Massachusetts. She suffered from bipolar disorder. She was a plain, homely woman. Frizzy blonde hair. Short in stature. Weathered eyes. Forced smile.

Letitia was a twenty-eight-year-old personal trainer from London, and she suffered from schizophrenia. She was mesmerisingly beautiful. Tall, yet petite.

Ryan was a sixty-year-old History teacher, and he suffered from severe depression. He was only a little taller than Emma. Grey, thinning hair. Foggy, rimmed glasses. Perfectly-round face.

Finally, Nathaniel was a thirty-four-year-old stock broker, and he suffered from borderline-personality disorder. He was a stoic man. Lanky. Slightly malnourished.

We spent the duration of the four-hour voyage getting acquainted. As the mound of land on the horizon grew, I started to accept that something good might actually happen to me. It was a small, forested paradise with no signs of civilisation, other than Aaron Colt’s vast villa. A free holiday *and* a chance to rid myself of mental illness? Good fortune didn’t sit well with me.

To my surprise, we arrived on the island in one piece. The sun had begun to set. We had been at sea for most of the day. Once the ferry docked, the five of us exited onto a rickety, wooden pier. There, we were greeted by our mysterious host.

“Hello!” The man bellowed. “I’m Aaron Colt, and you must be my lucky ticket winners. Emma, Letitia, Darryl, Ryan, and Nathaniel. Welcome!”

“Willy Wonka,” I whispered to Letitia.

She snorted with laughter, and Aaron scowled at me for a split second. His false grin, dominated by artificially-whitened teeth, quickly returned, but I noted the fleeting fury in his eyes. Just for a second, the façade had fallen. That, I felt, was the *real* Aaron Colt.

Other than his untrustworthy face, however, he had an entirely unremarkable appearance. Medium height and build. Black buzz-cut hair. Doughy cheeks.

The man led us across grassy terrain to his astonishing abode. It covered a few acres of land at the edge of the island’s forest. Aaron Colt heaved open the hulking double doors of his grandiose home, and we strolled into a lavish lobby area.

“Big buildings unsettle me,” Letitia shuddered. “Let’s hope Aaron Colt can fix that.”

“I know we have entirely different mental illnesses, but one thing I’ve learnt is that it’s better *not* to expect a cure,” I said.

“That’s a depressing thought,” Letitia replied.

“Is there any other type of thought?” I quipped, making her smirk.

Aaron seated us at the dinner table in a grand dining room, and I got to know Letitia for the next hour or so. She talked about her struggle with schizophrenia, and I talked about my struggle with Simon. I think, perhaps, I was far too engrossed in the girl to notice the oddness of our host and the setting in which we found ourselves. In hindsight, I should’ve paid greater attention to the uneasy cloud which lingered in the air.

“This final course is special,” Aaron announced, as his members of staff served plates of indistinguishable green mush before us. “I call it Nevele.”

“Not particularly appetising,” Emma blurted out. “What’s so special about it?”

“Never judge a book by its cover,” Aaron smiled, seemingly proud of the dozenth cliché he had used that day. “Ignore the look and taste of the food. It’s less about what it can do for your body and more about what it can do for your *mind*.”

The five guests, chosen for their various mental impairments, exchanged disbelieving glances. Did Aaron Colt mean what we all inferred that he meant?

“Eat,” He instructed. “This is the moment that changes your lives. Bid adieu to your psychological afflictions.”

Hungering for freedom from mental illness, we all did as we were told. The five of us greedily gulped down our bowls of thick, green slosh. It didn’t taste particularly offensive. It could’ve been a bowl of tomato soup, if one were to focus on its consistency and flavour, not its colour.

And that was it. There was no dessert. There were no evening activities. Aaron Colt slinked stealthily to his feet and announced that the evening was over.

“My employees shall show you to your rooms,” He said. “Rest and recover. In the morning, you will be new people.”

As we were entering the lobby, our eerily enigmatic host hoisted Nathaniel to one side and whispered something into his ear. Nathaniel frowned, but he quickly joined the rest of us on our slow, sluggish march up the stairs to our respective rooms. The meal was sitting heavily on my stomach. I could tell the other guests felt the same.

“No chance of a second ‘magical meal’ to fix my irritable bowels?” Ryan sarcastically grumbled, clutching his gurgling abdomen.

The member of staff said nothing as she hurried the old man to his room. Emma complained of stomach pain as she was shown to her room. Letitia bid me goodnight as she entered the next door on the second-floor hallway, and the employee nodded at the final door on the left for me.

“What about me?” Nathaniel asked.

“Third-floor,” The worker curtly responded. “Attic.”

From my open doorway, I watched the lady lead the final guest up to the attic floor. Something was disconcerting about Aaron’s treatment of Nathaniel. What had our host whispered to the stock broker?

My room was little more than a broom closet. Disenchanting, given the impressive nature of the mansion as a whole. Still, I had a breathtaking view of the ocean from my sole window. There was also a four-poster bed, which fitted the dated decor of Aaron Colt’s bizarre home.

I flopped onto my bed, nursing both a horrendous headache and a gnawing sensation in my gut. I felt atrocious. Yet, drenched in beads of sweat, I told myself that must be a good thing. *I must be healing. The Nevele must be cleansing me of toxins.*

That was what I believed until something startled me from my sleep.

There was the sudden creak of a floorboard from the far end of the room. Quivering, I peered over the top of my duvet. I laid my eyes upon something so ghastly that it defied all reason.

A stone man.

I realised, in my state of spiralling horror, that the terrifying thing had actually been standing there since I first entered the room. I had simply mistaken him for a statue, but he was very much alive. The entity gazed upon me with ceaseless chasms. I cannot quite explain it, but I knew him. *Simon*.

“Tap your forehead three times,” It gently requested. “That’ll keep you safe. I know what’s best.”

I wailed, but a paranormal power muted my primal cry of terror. I was about to free myself from my covers, but I heard scuttling noises across the wooden floor, as if a living wave were crashing towards me.

Before I had a chance to process what was coming for me, piercing pangs of pain erupted across my thighs. I looked down to see lumps wriggling beneath my cover, like the bubbles of a boiling broth. Shaking manically, I peeled back the duvet to see what was tearing at my legs.

Tiny terrors. Marble-bodied minions of the stone man. Their horrid yellow eyes and teeth shone in the dark cave under my cover. Blood trickled down my pale legs as the arachnid-shaped statues of the stone man feasted on my flesh.

Then, the creatures sunk into the quicksand of my bloodstained bedsheets, leaving my massacred legs as a warning to abide by Simon‘s rules.

“Three taps,” Simon reiterated. “Otherwise, something *terrible* will happen.”

“You’ve been telling me that for years,” I whimpered, failing to conceal my horror. “You don’t control me anymore. I’m free.”

Simon’s demeanour shifted, as it always did whenever I ignored his demands. He was the abusive partner that once resided in my mind. Always nice until I stopped doing what I was told.

“Three taps,” He screeched. “Now!”

Suddenly, the white-clad entity was swelling to fit every nook and cranny of my box-sized room. Its limbs were liquifying, as it morphed to coat every surface of its surroundings. The vicious flower bloomed. The beast always became more fearsome when I did not feed it. I had never expected that analogy to carry any literal weight.

I slid out of bed in one fluid motion and, injured legs wobbling, stumbled to the door. I clumsily opened and shut it behind me. Standing in the pitch-black hallway, I expected the stone man to come crashing through the door.

He didn’t. I haven’t seen him since that fateful night. Intrusive thoughts no longer evoke any response from me. My Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is no longer part of me.

So, where did it go?

Every time I see r/nosleep posts about entities and rules, I wonder whether it might be *him*. My disorder. My curse. Unleashed upon the world. I’ve heard whispers of a stone man.

I’m sorry.

Worst of all, that isn’t even the end of that horrors that took place at Aaron Colt’s mansion. It’s barely the start.
