I’ll start this off by letting all of you know, I’m not a good person. Neither are the people I work for. 

We should all be in prison or even worse. 

This isn’t a life I found myself in; this was the life I sought out. And a part of me knows we deserve everything that's come for us. 

Growing up, my mom and I lived in a shithole apartment on the south side. Everyone called it the Pits. 

Dad skipped town on her when I was a baby, so it was just us. She worked double shifts, it seemed almost every day of my entire young life. 

Our place got robbed so many times that we started locking our cabinets and hiding important documents under the floor so we could leave the door open, since my mom couldn't afford to keep replacing the door locks when they broke it down. 

A gun was pointed at me, I don't even know how many times in my young life. I remember being so scared the first few times, blood rushing to my face, and being too frozen to even meet the eye of the assailants. They would usually demand my phone, wallet, or anything out of my bookbag. Not that I really had any of those things, as I was just a broke kid heading to school almost all of those times. 

My schools didn't even have names; they had numbers, and sometimes I felt it was the same for us. Just a meaningless flock sent into the slaughterhouse for years on end, we all knew there was an entrance, but no real exit to the Pits. But we just kept coming, day in and day out. 

The flooding of new faces that came and went every year, I never even bothered to memorize anyone. Parts of me liked to think their family did right by them and got them out, instead of the alternative. 

Those low-life twerps that would rob me and others weren't what made me want to be a criminal. Quite the opposite. It was the flashy cars that drove way too quickly past me some nights. The windows reflected the dirty streets with a pristine shine. They never stopped at red lights; they glided from location to location with confidence and ease. I had never seen someone in the car's face, only heard whispers about where they “work” and what they do. 

The moments I saw them were so fleeting, but they always made life seem so badass, like they were untouchable gods that ruled their very own universes with no consequences. And I wanted to be just like them. I spent my entire life afraid or numb. I never felt happy, I never felt joy or hope. There was nothing but dark ahead. I was too much of a pussy to off myself, let alone what that would do to my mother. I would live and die here just as everyone else I had the displeasure of slumming along with. And when I went out, I just hoped it was quick and hurt as few people as possible. 

Eventually, I met Tommy at the arcade when I was 14. He was an alright kid, probably wouldn't have wanted to see him again. He was pretentious, unfunny, tucked in his light colored polo shirt, and was shit at video games. The kind of kid you meet, and you just know they have a gluten allergy and an 8 pm bedtime. But he took a liking to me and asked me to his house, and that's when I knew this was my chance. 

His dad, Tom. He was everything I ever wanted to be. He ran a local restaurant that no one ever seemed to be eating at. He wore a watch worth more than my apartment building, he walked with swagger and confidence, and I wanted to be him the second I met him. 

Tom, when we first met, didn't ask more than my name and where I was from, but after worming my way into hanging out with Tommy more and more. I got invited over for family dinners, and soon for a holiday. Tom caught me eyeing him and his “family” crowded over the grill and invited me outside with them. Didn’t take more than complimenting their grilling skills to get asked if I could help them with an odd job for some cash next week. I accepted and tried with every fiber of my being to play it cool while I was swimming with joy inside. 

What started off as a delivery gig, simple as take this package to this location, and maybe don't look into it. Turned into a lookout gig before a shooting or a robbery took place. And now 10 years later. Tom trusts me with everything. I don't want to lie and say I’m his right-hand man; I'm a glorified assistant at best. But he takes me everywhere, shows me everything, and I would like to think, trusts me with everything. 

I got my mom out of the Pits and out of harm's way. I know she knows there's no way she's in a comfortable house outside of the city on an honest man's salary. But she's never asked, I just hear the worry in her voice when she calls me for our weekly check-in. 

Tom and his men are into the business of “making money,” they always say. And whatever their clients are buying, they are selling. Of course, it’ll always be drugs, experimental and not, maybe the firearm or explosive here or there. The chop shops and the illegal animals, the forbidden alcohol, and occasional top-secret information leaks. 

But a few years ago, they started in the business of “livestock,” as they call it. And yes, it's as disgusting as you think it is. It's sex trafficking. Particularly for high-end anonymous contacts that certainly know what they are looking for. We don't promise impoverished people overseas money and goods only to lock them in shipping containers. No, this is much worse. 

Our clients usually prefer U.S persons only. Usually, those who have a clean record and bill of health. They may even have preferences for location, looks, demeanor, age, and education. Sometimes they even have photos of reference or direct photos of the person they are requesting we “retrieve” for them. 

I stopped thinking about these people as people a long time ago. It’s easier that way, I view myself as a salesman who is helping my client get the best possible deal. I’ll say or do anything to move that transaction along, to make sure it goes smoothly and without error. And once that deal is closed, it’s no longer my problem or my business. And I get a commission on the translation. I'm happy, my boss is happy, and the client is happy. And we all win. 

What I’m really paid to do is lure those listed men and women from any location they may be. A bar, a mall, a library. Into a proper meeting location nearby so they may be transported to our Pit location and given to the client from there. I’ve flown all over the country to find these specimens. I have 15 different IDs and at least 10 different backstories I have reserved that work like a charm on almost any warm, willing body. 

Like clockwork, my boss's plane takes me there, and I’m briefed on what I'm looking for. I get it, we fly home and seal the deal. As little violence as needed when taking them, no drugging or being pushy in locations so as not to set any red flags. 

I'm great at what I do, and I don't miss my mark. We've never been made, and our clients are always happy. 

1 week ago, I think, we took her. 

On the outskirts of Chicago, our client asked for a trashy brunette.  He apparently said those words exactly. Tall, if possible, nice smile. This is all I had to work with and to land to make more than most people make in a year. He did, however, ask me to go to a specific bar around there to scout. He said if I didn't find it that night, to come back the next and the next until I did. Don’t know what the bar meant to him, or if he really was looking for this specific girl and didn't want to say.  

But I was in luck, cause that first night around 8 pm I saw her. She came in with a fire to her, makeup smeared like she had been crying. Torn cheap leggings around her chubby thighs that barely fit in her frayed denim shorts. Her top was too short and revealed a very patchy tattoo on her lower back that looked like a 6-year-old had sketched the linework. This was perfect. She flopped down, and the bartender put a cup of a clear liquid in front of her without question. She was obviously a regular. She lit a cigarette and put her head over her folded arms in defeat. 

“Rough day at the office?” I smirked.

She glanced over at me and ignored me entirely. 

“I really just came over to ask you for a cigarette, but figured I'd be polite first.” 

I could see her chuckle through her entwined arms. That seemed to soften her up. And conversation came easily after that. 

She told me about her piece of shit roommate not paying their share. I “opened up” and told her about my new job in the city and my fiancé cheating on me in our new apartment. 

I bought her drinks and we laughed. I didn't even have to try to direct her; she asked me eagerly if my apartment was nearby and if she could see it. 

I texted my team, and we were a go. As we came to the meeting point in the park. I usually avoid confrontation, and I get in the car to get going. This time, I don't know what compelled me, but I watched. 

I usually hear the muffled shriek or struggle. Sometimes they get a few good punches in before the drugs put them to sleep. But this time there was none of that, no fear, no scream. We met eyes before I got in the car; she didn't even move a muscle before gently falling asleep. She was at peace, smiling almost. I still will never forget the uneasy feeling it sent through my spine, as if she was expecting this. Excited for it even. 

When we got her home, something was immediately off. The client wouldn't answer his phone. This was very unlike them, as clearly they have already paid half of the steep price for retrieval. We've never had a client back out or become unreachable. Not in all my years of working this operation have we been ghosted like this. 

Tony called Tom to figure out what the plan was. We had never kept the stock for more than 24 hours. That's how Toms says you get caught, that's how people catch on to you. By staying put and being indecisive. 

But since the client was unreachable, we were stuck watching the girl through the night. I took the first shift; she was still out cold, bag over her head, propped against the vault corner. Her feet and hands were bound with wire, and a new, fresh set of cuffs locked her to the steel beam next to her. 

I had never watched the products before. I had never seen them past the meetup point. A pit rose in my stomach, and I turned my chair around. Just kept my ear out for any movement behind me, sat on my phone, and waited for my replacement to come in a few hours. 

Not even an hour later, I heard something move. It sounded wet, soupy even. Like when wet flesh bubbles onto the tile, yes, gross, I'm aware. 

When I turned around, I didn’t even understand how it was possible. She was melting, it seemed, the bag was off her head, nowhere to be seen, and all the wires that bound her had been dissolved. Her skin was sluffing off her muscles and dangling onto the dirty floor, mopping around pools of brown congealed blood. Her clothing seemed to mesh with her skin as the bones struggled to move with no muscle holding them together. All of this time, her eyes stayed glued to mine, with an ear-to-ear smile plastered on her face. Her teeth blackened with decay, as her jaw slowly fell off canter and then ripped from her skull.

I jumped up and grabbed the first thing I thought could help, the fire extinguisher. As I sprayed her body, the cool chemicals met her flesh and sizzled on contact. It sounded alarmingly like Pop-Rocks. She had to be dead right??? I got closer to her to make sure the burning had stopped. The cloud of chemicals left my vision in a haze as I neared. A hand with little other than a few ligaments left to it slashed at me from the cloud. I tossed the extinguisher at her with a sickening squish. Followed by silence.  Bitch had scratched me. The long pink line bearly broke the skin, looked like a cat scratch. But this sense of dread spun over me that she was contagious or something, some kind of flesh-eating bacteria or bio weapon I had never seen before. 

The clang of the garage door opening snapped me awake. 

The fluorescent lights of the vault dug into my eyes as I snapped out of sleep. I must have knocked out for a bit. I flung myself around. The girl was still out cold, very alive looking, propped up in the same place we left her. Maybe had sagged forward a bit, but that was it. I frantically checked my arm; it was clean. I had never had a dream feel so damn real in my life. 

I practically shoved past Tony as I ran out to catch some cold air, finally, and clear my head. 

The drive home felt so long. Every light felt like it clung to the past. Every bump felt like it shook my skeleton. By the time I was up the elevator to my place, I couldn't see straight. As I crashed on my couch, I heard something. It sounded like humming coming from somewhere else in my house. A light melody, hummed with grace and care. It reminded me of the lullaby my mom would lull me to sleep with as a kid. Or when I was scared or mad, she would hold me to her and hum a tune as she rocked me back and forth. What should have scared the hell out of me felt like warmth and comfort; the sleep embraced me in a way I hadn't felt in decades.  

My loud ringtone threw me out of the blissful coma I was in. 

“Marcus, where the FUCK are you? You were supposed to be here an hour ago!” 

I glanced around as the evening light poured into my living room. How long had I been asleep???

“Sorry, man, I overslept. I'll be there in a minute.” 

“Well, hurry the hell up, something's up with this chick!” 

When I got there, the panic on Tony’s face was immediately prevalent. 

“This girl man, she still hasn't woken up, and I'm freaking out, man. Weird shits been happening!” 

My terrifying nightmare crossed my mind, but I figured it was best not to add fuel to the likely nothing problem. 

“Are we sure she's not dead? Did you even fucking check??” I snarled. 

“I’m not touching that bitch man, I saw her breathing. That's all I'm doing. She’s your problem now. I’m calling Tom now to see if we can just get rid of her!” 

“You know as good as me if she's gone, we ain't getting paid!”

“You don’t understand man, I swear I looked away for 2 seconds and she was standing in the other corner of the room, just fucking staring at me. Her eyes were all white and shit, and I swear I could hear her bones cracking around, sounded like rice crispies or some shit. Before I can even blink, she's back where she started. Then at some point, I started hearing singing from down the hall, but no one was fucking there man. My grandma told me stories about shit like this bro, I'm out.” 

Tony stormed out of the building before I could even confess anything I'd seen or express my disdain for being alone with her as well. 

As my eyes panned over to the slumped-over girl, I couldn't help but think she was faking it. There's no way the drugs would last this long at this point, usually 12 hours at best. Had Tony given her more and not told me? 

I'm always told we can’t damage the merchandise, but this girl was as good as dead by the end of today if we didn't get paid. And no one can not flinch at something cutting them. Trust me I've watched much bigger and braver try. 

I took the knife from my pocket and slowly approached her. Why did I feel so terrified? She was tied up and 150lbs at most. She hadn't eaten in a day and was unconscious. What did I have to be scared of? But the hair on all of my body stood on end, like there was electricity flowing in the air around us. 

I grabbed her shoulder, and a shockwave went through my body. For a second, it almost felt like I was being pushed back, like when two magnets repel. 

I pushed through and took the knife to make a small cut above her elbow. No one would notice the small scratch. The second the knife slid against her skin, I felt a hot, searing pain behind my arm. 

“Fuck” I threw the knife back as I watched a trail of blood drip down my arm in the same spot. 

Only mine was WAY deeper then hers. Where a few droplets of blood pooled on her flesh. Mine felt like a chunk was bitten out of my arm. 

She still lay motionless on the ground. Still steadily breathing. Out cold. What the FUCK was going on. 

The phone ringing in the lobby slowly faded my fear back to the present moment. I jogged to answer it. Hoping it was Tom or Tony with some kind of update. 

“Marcus, my dear, why haven't you called this week?”  It was my mother. 

“Mom, how did you get this number? Is everything alright??” 

Silence. 

“Mom!! Are you ok?? Is someone there??” 

“Marcus, you really need to get out more. Meet more people. You’re always working. You’re not getting any younger, you know. We’re so worried about you..” She hangs up. 

My mom is calling me at my unknown work location to talk about my love life??? 

Something is very wrong. I know someone's there with her. I just know it has to do with this girl; everything started going off the second she was around. 

“HEY, what the fuck did you do to my mother, you stupid bitch-” 

She was gone. 

The cuffs swung against the beam in haste. Shit. 

That humming tune flooded from the walls, it seemed. As I walked down the hallway, it focused more and more on me. Like a beacon. Begging me home. I felt trapped in my body as I watched the natural light flooding in from the windows fade to dusk. And then darkness as it consumed the hallway in a hefty swallow. 

I finally became aware of my own heart rate and breathing as I closed in on the source. The file room. 

I reached behind my back for my pistol. I had never really felt a reason to need it until now. 

She was poring over the open file cabinets. A light clicking and moaning was coming from her. The entire room was covered in this vicious ooze. Presumably from her. She seemed to be so absorbed in the info in the files. All of our business files, all the legal ones that is. Why does she even care about this stuff? What would pulling information about people give to her?

I silently raised the gun and pointed it at her. No use in drawing her attention. 

“You don’t want to do that.” Her fuzzy voice said from behind me. The girl didn't appear to be speaking in front of me. Or notice I was there. 

I didn’t turn around, I just clicked off the safety. And put my finger on the trigger. 

“Marcus, you DON’T want to do that, you’re no use to us dead.” 

With a sharp inhale I felt my gun press deeper into my temple. What?? As I pulled it away it felt like it gave a lot of resistance, like a magnetic field drawing me into place. 

The girl was gone, the ooze was gone. The file room was still a wreck. Someone has been here and has been looking for everyone and everything that we are associated with. I'm losing my god damn mind. 

My body felt like it was covered in ants, my skin prickled and churned. I was feeling so compelled to do something, anything, but I had no idea what. It felt like worms were slithering around inside my bones. 

The girl did something to me; she poisoned me. Maybe we had done someone in her family wrong, and it was coming to bite us. She was taking us all out. 

Without even thinking, I fumbled to the bathroom, soaked in sweat, and looking deathly ill as I caught a glimpse of my reflection. I grabbed my knife from my pocket and sliced into my arm. I needed to see that I was normal on the inside. Just to try and ground myself. 

“NO”. Her voice charmed in. Her dusty hand grabbed my arm. 

“If you hurt, we all hurt.” Her eyes met mine, she didn't open her mouth to speak. It sounded like it was coming from inside my head. And all around at once. 

“The more you fight it, the more it hurts. I can feel the sensations of resistance you have. Please stop.” 

Her light voice fluttered like cracking electricity in the room. 

“What the fuck are you? What is all of this??” 

“We’ve been watching you for so long. So much pain, so much violence. We can offer you safety, peace, and kindness. I know you have felt it. I know you know what bliss we can offer.” 

“What about my mother? If I do what you say, will she be safe?” 

“Marcus, there will be no danger if everyone is with us. You’re not in danger now, and you never were. We are safe, we are your mother, we are you.” 

I looked down, and what was my blood-soaked arm was now being covered by her hand, as if it had meshed with my flesh. It was warm and felt as though I was being welcomed by the soft velvety breeze of an oceanscape. 

She slowly melted away, not like she turned to liquid, but as though she misted away in a nonexistent breeze. She knew she got what she wanted. What we wanted. 

So I'm begging you, please, if you're reading this. Just know, I’m not a good person. I never was and never will be. I've never had hope or happiness before today. I've never felt such peace. We forgive you for everything you’ve done. Peace and redemption wait for you with us. We know you feel the itch, the draw, the urges to find us. Please don't fight us. You’re only hurting all of us.
