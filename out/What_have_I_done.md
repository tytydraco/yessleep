I entered the department at around 10:30 pm. The small Iowa town I worked in was quiet, so my hours often didn’t extend past 7 or 8. As I hung my jacket, still damp from the cold November drizzle, Reeves walked in holding a few papers.

“Sorry boss, gotta get you to sign these.” He said, his barely lit cigarette hanging from his mouth. The dark circles that gnawed under his eyes were at odds with the dim yellow light from the desk lamp. I sighed, falling into my chair as I scribbled my name across the papers. They were still warm, freshly printed. I leaned forward, rubbing my eyes as I dreamed of being back in my own bed.

“This can’t be the only reason you called me in here,” I muttered, aching to go back home. “You said there was a fucking emergency.”

“Well, kinda.” He shrugged, smiled wryly, “May have exaggerated that a bit. Just got a call from a couple of folks near the old high school. They were hearing screams, thought we should go check it out.”

“Probably just the wind or some bullshit, do we really need to check it out? We’ve still got work tomorrow morning.”

He looked back at me, pushing some of his messy hair out of his face. He was a newer recruit, only a couple of years working here. Yet he carried himself with the same fatigue as a worn vet. “No, we should. I wouldn’t wish a sleepless night on others.”

I sighed again and nodded. Town only had about 1500 people, so we’re known by name. Ignoring even a small incident like this means I’ll have a personalized complaint, something I don’t want to deal with. “Alright, but we've gotta be quick about it. Don’t want my bed to be cold when I get back.”

We hop in the patrol car, a shitty ‘96 Caprice. The town doesn’t have that much need for police, so we essentially get hand-me-down equipment from the state. 

“So, screams huh.” I sighed. Reeves lit another cigarette. “What do you think it is this time? A cat? Maybe a couple highschoolers fucking around?”

He took a long drag, almost savoring it. “Don’t really care, doesn’t change the fact we gotta deal with this shit.” He reached out, offering me his already half burned cigarette.

“Sorry, don't smoke.” I said halfheartedly. “Wife made me quit. Can’t be dying and leaving her and the kids to fend for themselves.”

“Oh since when, yesterday?” He laughed, his voice cracking a bit with the cold air “Come on, one won’t kill you. Besides, if anything you smoke more than me.”

“I’m serious, I made a promise to my wife.” I smiled, though my face felt tired. “One smoke turns to two, then three, then to ten. Next thing you know we’ll be stopping at Lou’s to get another pack on the way back.”

“Suit yourself,” he said, turning back to his window. “It’s already been a long night, and I got a feeling it ain’t gonna get any shorter.”

We pulled into the dilapidated parking lot of Eaton High, the old town high school. The building had seen better days, practically neglected following the opening of Hillside across town a couple years back. We stepped out of the car, breath visible as rain lightly fell from the pitch-black sky. I pulled out my flashlight, illuminating a clear path to the entrance. Reeves tossed his smoke, following closely behind. There were no other sources of light aside from the street lamps a couple hundred feet away. As we got to the door, Reeves hesitated.

“You feel that?” He asked, his eyes on high alert.

“Feel what?”

“Exactly.” He said, scanning the parking lot. There was no one, just our patrol car. A slight pinging noise echoed as the rain pranced on the lonely vehicle. “Where’s the wind?”

“The wind?”

“Yeah, where is it?”

“The fuck are you on about?” I said, exasperated. “Does there need to be wind?”

“We live out in the open plains of Iowa, I don’t think I can remember a day without at least a slight breeze hitting my face, especially when it's raining like this.”

I thought about it. As I looked back on my time here, I couldn’t recall any windless days. “What does this have to do with anything?”

“Don’t know, just feels strange.” He pushed his hair back again as he went to open the double doors guarding the main entrance. I pointed my flashlight through the glass, getting a sneak peak of the layout. Dusty ceramic tiles, old lockers, and some graffiti met my gaze. Nothing looked out of place, although I’m not sure I’d know the difference if something was. Reeves pushed open the doors, surprisingly not locked, and headed inside. I followed closely, looking at the surrounding area. It looked like a typical high school, aside from the occasional art piece sprayed carelessly on the wall. The building was two stories, and consisted of six wings, labeled A-F. The school was organized nicely, with certain kinds of classes isolated in certain wings. Notably, the school was silent, almost eerily. Aside from the noises coming from Reeves and myself, the school was dead. Reeves made his way to the A wing, which housed the electrical unit for the school. It was also where the music department was located. As we approached, I kept looking around. It was musty, a lack of cleaning and ventilation leaving the air stale. The halls were lined with music lockers and a few classrooms, though the lockers were left empty and ajar. I poked my flashlight through a small window in one of the doors, revealing the old auditorium. Though still in fine shape, it was silent. I scanned the area, looking for any potential source of the reported screams.

“Found it!” Reeves said excitedly. I jumped, his voice still ringing in my ears in contrast to the silence of the school.

“Jesus kid.” I whispered as I made my way to him. “Don’t scare me like that. Can’t be screaming like that out of the blue.”

“Sorry, sorry,” he said, rolling his eyes. “Didn’t know you scare easy like that.” I pointed my flashlight at the panel board. All switches were flipped off. “What rooms you want lit up?”

“Just do the hallways. Flashlights should cover the rest pretty easily.” As he flipped the switches, the dim lights flickered on, slightly illuminating the run-down building.

“We may as well have just left 'em off.” Reeves remarked, laughing softly.

“Better than nothing.” I replied as we made our way back to the main hall. We had yet to hear any noises, much or less screams. We walked through the halls, cautiously. Something about dark, old run down buildings makes you feel on your toes. We browsed the classrooms, pointing our flashlights into the occasionally open door. Nothing too out of the ordinary, just the occasional graffiti or misplaced desk. I sighed. I wanted to go home, back to the comfort of my own bed. As much as I like Reeves, my ideal night did not include scouring an abandoned school with him at damn near midnight.

“Wanna just go home?” Reeves suggested. He was standing in front of me, obviously bored out of his mind. “It’s almost midnight, we’ve been here for close to an hour. Maybe the folks who reported it just had a bad dream or something.”

“Sure, why not.” I smiled a bit. “Would make the wife a lot happier if I was back home.” We turned to leave, both relieved this excursion amounted to nothing. Then we heard it. A scream. Human. A blood curdling noise to hear especially against the dead silence prior. It resonated through the halls as Reeves and I ran toward the source. We ended up in the D wing, where the history and english classes were located. I pulled out my gun, and Reeves followed suit. The screaming had ceased for the time being, as if it knew we were coming. We split up, scouring the old rooms for any sign of life. Just as I approached the end of the wing, Reeve’s voice broke the newfound silence.

“Got something!” I ran over to him, adrenaline still rushing through my spine. As I approached, I saw him crouched, talking to a little girl. She couldn’t have been older than 5, messy hair with a white dress with pink flowers. Her blue eyes met my gaze calmly, a sort of calm not usually seen in children.

“What’s going on?” I panted, out of breath from the cardio we just did. “Did she scream?”

“Don’t know.” Reeves was fixed on the girl, his eyes softening as he looked at the girl. “You got a name sweetheart?” She nodded shyly, playing with her hair. 

“Care to share it with us?” I asked. She looked back up at me, glaring slightly. She quickly turned back to Reeves, who smiled a bit.

“Guess we know who her favorite is.” He joked. “Don’t blame ya, sweetheart, he isn’t much of a looker.”

“Ha ha, now ask her what her name is.” I stated bluntly. “We need to find her parents.”

“True,” he said, “though she doesn’t seem too inclined to speak. Don’t even know if it was her who screamed.”

“We also don’t know what a little girl is doing alone in an abandoned fucking school.” Reeves covered her ears, glaring at me a bit.

“Not in front of the kid.”

“Sorry, sorry.” I apologized, though my suspicions were mounting as the initial adrenaline wore out. “Her being here raises a few questions though. There’s no way her parents took her to an abandoned school, which means she either brought herself or was brought here. And I don’t know too many 5-year-olds inclined to explore abandoned buildings at midnight.”

“You saying there’s someone else here?”

“Course I am. I can’t think of a reason why or how she’d get here by herself.” Reeves looked back up at me, still crouched by the newly found girl. He looked like he’d just seen a ghost.

“Know something else?” His face was pale as he turned back to the girl. “I’ve seen this girl before. I know it in my gut, my eyes have seen this face before, but for the life of me I can’t pinpoint where.” He looked at the girl a bit longer, who was still fidgeting with her hair.

“Wanna tell us your name? Who brought you here” Reeves asked softly, though the girl did not answer. Instead, she took off into the main hall.

“Hey don’t run! It ain’t safe in here!” Reeves called out as we took off after. She made a beeline for the gym as we followed close behind, shoes squeaking against the faded tiles. We entered the gym, though the girl was gone. I could have sworn we were only a few steps behind her. We looked around, dumbfounded. How had this girl vanished? We didn’t have much time to react to the strangeness of our current situation before Reeves shouted.

“Holy fuck!”

I glanced over to where his flashlight was pointed. At the edge of the gym, barely illuminated, was a body. Face down on the dirty hardwood floor, blood forming a pool around the head. A man, messy blonde hair splattered red, three distinct bullet holes poking through the back of his skull. His body was splayed out, clad in a brown flannel and jeans.

“Call some back up,” I ordered Reeves, “We gotta get this building locked down.”

“Who do you think did this?” Reeves asked, still staring in shock at the body.

“Probably whoever brought the girl here.” I said bluntly. “I don’t know what’s going on here, but we’ve got a murder and potential kidnapping. We’re out of our depth.”

“Who should I call for backup? Milton?”

“Milton won’t be able to do shit. Call the Des Moines department, they’re only half an hour away.” I scanned the surrounding gym. Where had the girl gone off to? As I tried to piece a reasonable explanation together, Reeves called me back over to the body.

“Toss me the walkie will ya?” Reeves said, still staring at the corpse. I unclipped it from my belt and handed it to him, careful not to contaminate the crime scene. He started flipping through channels, eventually landing on our shared frequency with the Des Moines department. 

“We’ve got a 707 and a potential 710 here at Eaton High, requesting back up.” No response. The static filled the once silent room with an eerie buzz. “Do you copy?” Reeves looked up at me, confused. The people working at Des Moines often pulled late nights, having people on stand by the full 24 hours for cases such as these. But no response? There hadn’t been even the slightest indication there was anyone on the other end of the line. 

“Did you check the channel?” I asked, hoping his tired eyes accounted for our lack of communication.

“Yeah channel 6.” Reeves said, puzzled. “I’m positive this is the right channel. I used it a couple months ago for that thief we were tracking down.” He was right. Channel 6 was a direct line of communication to Des Moines, yet the static persisted. 

“Shit.” I rubbed my eyes. The night just kept getting stranger. Why couldn’t this have just been some animal? Some sort of bullshit we could write off? “Did you check the time? I think there’s some sort of shift change at midnight. Maybe the operator overseeing the graveyard shift hasn’t clocked in yet.”

“Don’t think it’s that.” Reeves said, staring at his watch. “It’s 11:39”

“You serious?” I froze up, glancing at my own watch. Sure enough, it read 11:39, 6 seconds. “It was 11:39 half an hour ago.”

“Check the second hand chief.” I glanced back at my watch, and sure enough the seconds hand was still reading 6 seconds. It kept ticking, jolting right back to the same mark. 

“What the fuck is going on?” I muttered, shifting back slightly. Nothing was making sense. 

“Maybe our watches broke? Though with everything that’s happened I doubt it.” Reeves circled around the body, still trying to piece some sort of reasonable explanation together. “Also, do you remember hearing a gunshot? Much or less three of 'em?”

“What?”

“Blood’s still fresh, usually takes 30-60 minutes to dry.” His eyes remained trained on the body. “We’ve been here for about an hour, yet the blood is still wet.” He put his hand over the body. “Still a bit warm as well, should have at least gone cold by now. What we’ve got here is a fresh body.”

My eyes widened. None of it added up. “What the hell are we dealing with then?”

“I don’t know,” Reeves continued, “But whoever did this is most likely still here. Girl as well. We can’t get in contact with Des Moines so we’re on our own.”

I gazed at the surrounding gym. The musty smell of old wood met my nose, as my flashlight illuminated the dusty bleachers. The girl must also still be here, no way a young kid like that could make it far. “For now, let’s stick together.” I said, glancing back over at Reeves. His eyes were trained back on his watch. “We don’t exactly know what we are in for.”

Reeves nodded as we both turned back to the main hallway. As we stepped back into the light, we were met with a scream. It sounded as if it were on top of us, resonating from us. It was piercing, a scream populated with loss and sorrow. Reeves and I covered our ears, though that effort was in vain. Just as soon as it had started, it stopped. I looked back at Reeves, whose eyes were now wild with shock.

“The fuck just happened?”

“Don’t know,” I replied, “Can’t even begin to try and explain. PA system malfunction?”

“Fuck man.” Reeves rubbed his ears in discomfort. “Didn’t know these old PA systems had that kinda juice. I also didn’t turn this shit on back on the panel board.”

“Kid may have gotten to it,” I said, “Or worse yet, our suspect.” We made a beeline for the panel board, hoping to end this awful night once and for all. As we approached the A wing, we could hear the distinct clicks from the panel board switches. They were rapid, nonsensical. Someone just flipping them with no sense of what they even do. The panel board door was wide open when we arrived, though everything was where we had left it.

“Is someone messing with us?” Reeves said, exhausted from the oddities of the night. “Like who the fuck was just flipping through all of these? Are we both going crazy or something?” I shrugged, my mind alert that the killer could be around any corner. Just then, Reeves turned back to the door. “Oh, it’s you.” The little girl stood silently at the entrance to wing A, playing with her hair. She waved at Reeves, beckoning him forward.

“Alright I guess,” Reeves said, responding to some unspoken message. His eyes were bloodshot, tired. Each step he took appeared a challenge, as if he was falling forward and catching himself. “Where do you want to go?” The little girl took off, Reeves following suit. 

“Reeves!” I shouted, chasing after. “The fuck has gotten into you?” I reached out, desperately trying to grab onto his coat. Getting split up with a potential killer loose in the halls is the last thing we would have wanted. As Reeves passed through the double doors guarding the A wing entrance, they slammed shut, almost taking my fingers off in the process.

“Reeves!” I shouted again, banging against the door. “Open the door! We’ve gotta stick together, we haven’t got the foggiest idea what’s happening!” Silence. I pounded on the door, begging Reeves to come back. But I was stuck. What had gotten into him? Just a few minutes ago he was preaching the idea of sticking together, and now this? I stood confused, wondering what I should do next. Just then, I heard the auditorium door slam shut. I made my way to the door cautiously, peeking into the small window the door possessed. The stage light was on, and standing in it was my wife. Maya. She stood tense, wearing a sundress I bought her only a few months prior. Her brown hair shined under the piercing light, though her look was nervous. A bed lay behind her. Why was she here? I tried opening the door, but it was locked. The handle wouldn’t budge. As I struggled to open the door a group of six dark figures stepped onto the stage. They were clad in black robes, faceless shadows that haunted her. I watched as these things slowly undressed her, her now naked self lying on the bed set up on stage. The figures stepped back, forming a circle around her as she lay still. I called out to her, tried wrestling with the door handle again, but nothing worked. My continued was cut short as a man emerged from behind the stage. His back was turned toward me, revealing only his messy hair and brown flannel. Brown flannel. God, it was the same man we’d found dead mere moments before. What kind of game is this? I watched as he approached the bed, the figures humming a soft tune I couldn’t understand. I screamed as he mounted her, raped her. She cried out for someone, anyone, yet the figures only watched. She writhed as the man lay on top of her, having his way. I pounded on the door, screaming.

“HEY!” I cried out, though my call was ignored. “GET THE FUCK OFF HER!” My voice was cracking. I took a step back, now using my body as a battering ram against the solid wood door. I drove my shoulder into the door as my wife screamed out. God the screams. My head hurt, my shoulder ached as I kept ramming into the door. I let out a yell, a primal wail that brutalized the air around me. I flew into the auditorium as the door yielded, falling forward into the rows of chairs. As I shot up in anger, I noticed the stage lay empty. The scene I had so vividly endured was gone, not a whisper remained.

“I’ve gotta be dreaming.” I muttered to myself, laughing. “I’ve just gotta. None of the shit I’ve had the pleasure of seeing tonight makes sense.” I buried my face in my hands. What had I just witnessed? What does it mean? The screams, the clock, the body, the fucking wind. What could possibly be going on? I couldn’t think for long as I heard a giggle. The giggle of a small child. I looked up, meeting the gaze of the same little girl who took Reeves. 

She smiled at me, contrary to the usual scowl I received. She waved at me as she ran behind the stage, giggling as she went. I got up, still disgruntled from the previous display. I ran after her. Hoping to find some answers. Hoping to find Reeves. As I ran past the curtains I found myself outside. But not into the cold November night Reeves and I had left earlier to examine the school, but a warm afternoon. The sun was still up, though drooping slightly to the west. A warm breeze met my cold face, offering a bit of comfort. What had I stumbled upon?

I looked at my surroundings. I was in a park. The trees were bright green, the leaves rustling as the breeze overtook them. The grass was soft, my shoes sinking just slightly with each step. Kids swarmed the playground, laughing and playing, fighting and crying. The little girl looked back at me, giggling as she beckoned me to further explore. Why was I here? I looked back for the stage curtains, but they were gone. Was I trapped? My clothes remained the same, as I was adorned in a jacket not suitable for the sunny summer weather I found myself in. This had to be a dream. All of it. I watched as the little girl made her way to a man. Messy hair. Brown flannel. Fury raged in my chest as I took off toward him, tackling him to the ground. As I grabbed his collar, I got a closer look at him. It was Reeves. I faltered, loosening my grip as he smiled at me.

“What’s going on man? Long time no see.” He sat up, leaning back up against the grassy hill as he brushed himself off. 

“What the fuck?” I stammered. “How did you get here? What is this?” I paused as I let my shock wear off. “Why did you fuck my wife?”

He paused, confused. “Not exactly sure what you’re asking. We’re at Legion Park with my daughter.” He picked up the little girl, giving her a kiss on the cheek. “Little Riley here loves this park. Won’t shut up about it at home. Ain’t that right?” She nodded shyly, burying her face into his sleeve. 

“Is this a dream?” I asked, dumbfounded.

“More like a memory.” Reeves responded, setting Riley down. She took off, heading straight for the playground. 

“I don’t remember this.” I stared, confused as Reeves smiled.

“Didn’t say it was yours boss.” He sat down in the grass. I sat next to him, digging my hands into the soft earth. I clenched my fists, pulling out clumps of wet dirt and grass as I did. Reeves looked at me, a bit concerned. “Here,” he said as he reached into his pocket. He pulled out a pack of smokes. “It’ll help take the edge off.” I inhaled as he lit the tip, letting the warm smoke fill my lungs. God how I needed it. I exhaled, letting the gravity of my situation leave as I did. 

“Why did you fuck my wife?” I asked solemnly. I leaned forward, burying my head between my knees. “Why are you wearing the clothes of a dead man?”

Reeves stared, a bit confused. “I don’t follow.”

“I saw you, in the auditorium, fucking my wife. Some fucking cult people watched as you did it.” I was starting to yell, kids were starting to stare. I took another long drag from the dead man’s cigarette. “You’re wearing the same clothes as the guy we found dead at Eaton. Don’t you remember? We were on a case, investigating the screams.” Reeves smiled softly, trying to comfort me.

“You’re exhausted.” He said, placing his hand on my shoulder. “I still don’t understand. Maybe you should get some sleep.” I laid my head against the grass as the sun poked through the leaves overhead. Am I hallucinating? Did that scream fuck with my brain or something?

“Are you sure that’s your daughter?” I asked, “You couldn’t remember her face when we saw her in the school.” He laughed, shaking his head a bit.

“You and this school of yours,” he joked. “You’d think I would recognize my own daughter.” I just started in utter confusion. I didn’t know what to make of all of this. I offered him his cigarette back, only half burned.

“Nah you finish it,” he smiled, “I don’t really smoke anymore.” I stared. Now I knew I was dreaming. 

“You’ve gotta be kidding me, this has to be some sort of dream.” I said, laughing. “Reeves doesn’t want a smoke? What kind of fairytale is this.”

“I’ve told you; it’s not a dream.” Reeves stared, his smile gone. “It’s a memory. And if you want out, fine.” The A wing doors appeared in the distance. I looked, shocked. Reeves was now staring at me, smile gone. His eyes were still warm, but filled with sorrow. 

“Just remember this is what it could have been.” He said, tears filled his eyes.

“Reeves what are you sayi—“ 

“Just remember, we are all corpses here. The ones left in your wake.” He cried out as he turned his head. The kids had stopped playing. The parents had stopped talking. They all had turned toward me, turning their heads. Their heads started twisting past the natural limit, they all cried out as the tendons in their neck snapped. Reeves looked at me, screaming as his head completed rotation after rotation. His daughter Riley stood next to him, enduring the same fate. I watched in horror as they’re heads popped off, one by one. Blood gushed from the open necks as bodies toppled, children and parent alike. Reeves wailed, his head now purple.

“Leave. Now.”  He gurgled under his final breath. I turned and ran for the doors as the trees decayed around me. The sky turned grey and the grass withered and died. I sprinted, unable to make anything of the conversation I had just had. As I pushed through the doors, I heard a scream. The same scream I had heard all goddamn night. I didn’t look back, letting the doors slam shut behind me. I was back at Eaton High; the same abandoned school Reeves and I had entered. The dim hall lights were still on as I made my way through the building, calling out for Reeves. As I stumbled through the halls, I noticed the front office lights were on. I made my way forward, hoping Reeves would be in there. He has to be. I couldn’t take any more nonsense tonight. I approached the desk, half expecting Reeves to be there. How I wished he was there. Instead, a single case file met my gaze. A bit of dust coated the brown packet as I picked it up. It was filed by the Des Moines department on August 13th. The year remained the same. I sat down at the desk, compelled to read it. Something told me I must. I opened it up as the memory came to me. What have I done?

*Case File:*

*Robbery*

*Filed by Officer IA-2375 at approximately 11:39, August 12th, 20XX*

God what have I done?

*Det. Ramirez: Do you recall what exactly transpired?*

It was a warm August night. No wind.

*Officer 2375: Yes I do.*

I had just gotten home from work, another late night at the station.

*Det Remirez: Can you give an account of what exactly went down?*

I was tired, worn down, just wanted to get some sleep.

*Officer 2375: I was at home, just got back from work…*

I heard noises coming from the master bedroom.

*Officer 2375: …I heard noises coming from my driveway…*

I opened the door.

*Officer 2375: …I went to go check it out…*

My wife was in bed, though she wasn’t sleeping.

*Officer 2375: …saw a man clad in all black, couldn’t make out his face…*

A man lay on top of her, buried in the sheets.

*Officer 2375: …he was scoping out the house, at the time I didn't know if he had a gun…*

I saw his messy hair, brown flannel.

*Officer 2375: …I went to alert my wife, called up my partner Reeves to get over there…*

She yelled when noticed me, the man turned around.

*Officer 2375: …he broke the window, forcing himself in…*

Reeves looked at me. Shocked.

*Officer 2375: …he proceeded to shoot two shots into the ceiling, warning shots…*

He couldn’t believe I caught him.

*Officer 2375: …my wife ran from out of the bedroom, holding the house gun…*

I couldn’t take it.

*Officer 2375: …he shot her dead in front of me…*

I just couldn’t take it.

*Officer 2375: …Reeves stumbled in, half awake. Tried to warn him he had a gun, but he was quick…*

I grabbed my gun.

*Officer 2375: …Reeves was gunned down, didn’t count the number of shots…*

I shot Reeves 3 times.

*Officer 2375: …I thought I was next…*

My wife screamed. Oh, how that scream blinded me.

*Officer 2375: …but he went for my car keys, demanded my wallet…*

I unloaded the remaining 3 bullets into her skull.

*Officer 2375: …he just took my car and drove away…*

Oh god, what have I done?
