The following is my recollection of my life’s most traumatic event. It is like any other truly tragic one, chaotic and instantaneous. None of lives violent moments are long buildups and unavoidable consequences, they are disorientatingly fleeting and devastating, only properly understood with hindsight. But I think the retelling is important. If only to remember what happened.

 

I am an electrician with a engineering degree. My father had a passion for boats and so naturally I spent some time in the navy. Although I learned much it is only important in so far as telling you that **I** was very qualified for my job. I worked on a cargo ship. That work was a very lonely existence. Hard to keep onto people when you are off shore for long stretches of time, especially women. I had a highschool sweetheart, and I spent time dating after we broke up. But no one could stomach my proffession, and having me in exile so consistently. So I make due with my own company. Sure when you are at sea you make friends for life, no way you can’t under those circumstanses. The thing is just that most of these friends for life, you won’t ever see again. Everyone takes jobs when they can, and that means spending a lot of time on the same ship with different men. The men with families plan their scheduals around those families, staying true to whats important to them. And therefore often fly home when we port. It is different when you are a single man. Work can become an escape from your life. It can keep your mind off the things you really need, keep you from improving, from finding solutions, making changes. It can ocupy your mind even if that mind hungers desperately for change, seeking anything but that horrible doomed loneliness at sea. Still the work makes you stay, it takes away the energy you need to wonder, and find better things.

 

The work that consumed my time on the waters was relativly simple. I did maintenance. Specifically for the stuff that had to work. Lights, sensors, engine control and so on. Anything where you would think an electrical signal resultet in the mechanical change of a system, I was the man you talked to. That made days simple, I had one tool that was always with me, a voltmeter. Wondering if current is passing through this wire? Simple as connecting to it and you will know. Making my rounds around the ship this way checking this and that, I was constantly running into the entire crew. We all knew each other well after no time at all, but from the perspective of others I get why I was always greeted with surprise. I knew where they where stationed, but they knew little of my rounds, or didn’t care to.

 

“Hey Jim! Finding it hard to stay away from me?”

 

It was Mark. Basically the only part of the crew I knew from earlier. He was such a lovely man. Kind hearted, helpful, understanding and full of playfull humor.

 

“Of cause, you’re magnetic.” I held up my voltmeter like it was dragging me to him.

 

He gave out a small snicker.

 

“What’s wrong with our ship today?” No one liked Justin. Not sure why. Maybe it was because he forced himself into stuff people weren’t interested in sharing with him. Or maybe it was just me, and I despised the fact he didn’t understand I wasn’t interested in having mine and Marks friendly jester bouts interposed with generic small talk. I had a fleeting thought occur to me then, of replying “you are the problem with our ship” but kept it to my self.

 

“As usual it’s just lose signals that are being tightened up. I think the big problem is behind us. But I promise I’ll take a long look at our sonar before we lay to port!”

 

Setting of had been a real hassel. Our sonar wouldn’t work and it cut out right when we were navigating a underwater ridgeline. The captain had been yelling at me like a madman while I darted back and fourth trying to get everything in order.

 

All ships have a sonar that maps the depth of the seafloor. It isn’t really useful when your at the middle of the ocean, like we where at this time. But it can be extraordinarily important when close to shore. And if you are like most normal people you probably havn’t thought about how a sound based system knows what is underneath you and what is at the sides of you. After all it is a wave, how would it know what the echo was bouncing of off?

 

The reason why it works is answered by how it sounds. Multiple wavelengths of sound are emitted at once. The image is then created by how these waves have changed when they come back. When the sound is bounced of an object all of the different wavelengths, are shifted in relation to each other. Where there once was negativ interference there is now positive, and maybe, vice versa. Allowing you with some math to know what direction the return signal is coming from.

When interference is between two waves in head on collision it is relatively easy to understand. But when waves spread between each other in 3d, or even 2d surfaces like an ocean, it immediately becomes very hard to grasp how they interact. But this complicated interaction is why sonar works, and simultaneously why ours wasn’t always able too.

Because in some cases different wavelengths interact in such an unfortunate manner as to create spots of hyper enlarged magnitudes. A single spot can be placed in a location where all waves peak together in the same spot. Creating a wave of such intensity that it can fry the system, simply by being literal hundreds of times bigger than the equipment was ever designed to withstand. A rogue wave, as it is called. And it just so happens that our sonar has a tendency to create such waves much more frequently than you would expect.

 

“Wouldn’t want that malfunction again. You have that under control next time right?” I din’t answer Justin this time. Just looked at Mark as I went by them onto the next task.

 

“Don’t have to much fun without me now” I didn’t pity Mark having to stay with Justin.

 

We were all called to eat dinner together in the evening, which was a rare event. The captain chose to give us some bad news, in a nice setting. Not that the room was nice, just that company was. Imagine a ship and you will know what it looked like. Cramped, iron walls spray-painted with a thick layer of white-ish paint, fluorescent lights, tables mounted to the floor the feeling was like you had chosen to live with 15 other men in a floating prison. What a brutal proffesion.

 

“okay, so. SO WE are about a couple of days. A day or two out from really bad winds.” We all knew what that meant, even if his look hadn’t been so stern. Our captain was a man with many many years of expertise. That he even called a meeting meant this was critical information. And getting a wind warning out on sea, didn’t mean strong winds. It meant waves.

 

“and of cause that means dangerous waters.” The weight of his words draped over us like a duvet. Just like any slumber party anything outside of it became a distant reality.

 

I broke the silence

 

“How tall are we expecting them?” The captain turned his eyes to meet mine.

 

“The important thing is that we prepare for it, that’s the only focus at this point. Everybody on board with that assessment?” He turned his gaze towards the room. He didn’t know the answer, which was frightening.

 

“sounds good cap” A few of the men said uncoordinatedly. Allowing his desperate plea to let his ignorance of the hook.

 

That night I dreamt terrible things. I dreamt that all of us were in the lifeboat. The ship slowly taking on water, we had managed to make an escape. But the lifeboat wouldn’t unlatch. With such a technical fault, I dreamt of the men arguing, to some degree violently. They where choosing a crew-member to unlatch it from the outside. Staying back with the cargo on the doomed vessel. And logically, at least to my dreaming mind, they chose me. I was the only one that knew how to operate the latching mechanism. And whilst being forced to step out from the security of the life boat I watched Mark fight back against the group consensus. I landed back first on the though metal of the cargo ship, I watched the men that threw me give way to an enormous version of Marks head. Marks head filling the entire doorway with his big teary eyes. As the ship started listing I got to my feet, a new directive being installed into my being. Survival was no longer an option. Only the ability to save my tribe remained. Saving Mark. Dreams are weird conglomerations of ideas. And I don’t know if we hugged but we definitely exchanged a deepfelt goodbye. And I grabbed the small pin keeping me from ridding the boat of it's shackles. Pushing the life boat of the ship I watched as I was ripped from existence by my own heroism.

 

“You slept okay Jim?” Mark handed me a much needed coffee. Even if I had slept well I wouldn’t have been able to make coffee in this sea. Contrary to common belief a ship doesn’t sway every which way. The ship is most well equipped going straight onto the waves. The captain going in head on to the waves meant you could be pretty sure what ways you would be thrown. Although the sea wasn’t bad enough to throw us yet. But you could feel the winds the captain had promised, had worse in store for us when we reached them. I accepted the coffee graciously.

 

“thank you” a small smile towards him was unwillingly given off my lips.

“well I actually slept quite poorly.” I directed my following inquiry to the entire room.

“does anyone here know how to keep the lifeboat clamps engaged?” The question was vague. I designed it that way. Such that it would only get a reply from someone I could trust with the task.

 

“Yes sure why? Anything wrong with the controls?” This was my guy. A man named Joshua.

 

“No not necessarily, I just havn’t gotten around to check the circuitry is all. I need a hand with keeping the boat on tight whilst im in there. You have time?” Mark let off a smirk.

 

“arrhh” He muttered whilst bringing back my attention to him.

 

“Sure, holla when you need me.” After Joshua’s affirmation I returned to Mark with a disapproving look.

 

“Grab a jacket Joshua, it’s getting cramped in here.” Mark’s smirk disappeared.

 

Making our way outside wasn’t as bad as I had expected, yet not easy. The waves at this point being no more than an omen of the storm to come. Only the swinging oceanic vibrations, manifesting in the waves we now felt, had been able to travel far enough to reach us. The problem was that the seemingly random intervals between the waves made it hard to discern a pattern to the swaying they created. When walking you ended up having little indication of when they would hit. And looking out over the water the only regularity I could discern to their motion was their direction.

 

The lifeboat hang at a fortfive degree angle of the side of the ship. It Was orange. And it was very awkward to get into. I stepped up next to it with Joshua.

 

“Know what to do?”

 

“Yes sir” Joshua answered sarcastically. I waited for another respons. He didn’t get the hint.

 

“yes sir” he repeated. Now with obedience.

 

“And what are you doing?” He had a look of embarrassment on his face, as he understood what I had meant all along.

 

“I’ll be standing here holding onto the release, stopping the pin from disengaging.” I nodded.

 

“Great thank you Joshua.” With our roles defined I moved into the small canister.

 

Taking a hand to the top of the door I put my foot onto the sloped floor. What a terrible design choice this was. Ducking into it I used one hand to grab seats on the way down to the control panel, the other hand tightly gripping my trusty voltmeter. Each step into the maw of it my movement became more and more fluid, whilst my anxiety in turn grew worse and worse. For even if Joshua was the best I could find for this responsibility, I still didn't trust him fully.

As I came closer to the lifeboats control panel, I could see more and more ocean through the tiny, enforced windows above it. The waves were scattered across the ocean, like an ill commanded army their power was laughable. Given proper coordination they would be capable of much greater feats than putting us of balance. I sat myself in the captain’s chair of the small tin.

 

“Joshua you there?” I spoke with more nervousness that I thought I would. I wasn’t afraid of falling into the water. I was afraid that the boat would. Sure, I could get back on the ship. But the boat. Our only safety would be lost forever. An unthinkable consequence, that would put everyone at risk. Not just me.

“Yes, I’m here. Holding the release pin. You are clear.”

I popped the control panel. I looked for the wire that connected to the release button. It was in a cluster of wires that went to the door. This system had plenty of redundancy. Which was good, and unexpected honestly. Looks like my nightmare was unsubstantiated. But not checking the signal now would be silly. I placed my voltmeter on my lap and removed only one of the measuring clamps. Slowly I extended my hand and put the clamp to just one of the release wires. Once in place I retracted my hand and went for the next clamp on the device. Shaking and moving slowly, filled with nervousness as the defining moment came closer. Reaching forward I put the other clamp on the same wire, completing the circuit.

 

“Pressing release.” I warned Joshua.

 

“You are clear.” Joshua replied.

 

I pressed the button. It lit up green. My voltmeter spiked. The mechanism worked. The lifeboat remained attached. Relief.

 

“Okay yeah I felt it kick, that's a kick, it works alright!” The powerful joy in his last affirmation was exactly what I needed.

 

“Perfect. Thank You Joshua, I’m packing up in here you can relax again.”

 

Leaning down I went to take away one of the clamps. But Joshua interrupted me.

 

“Oh MY GOD. JIM; JIIIM”

 

I looked out the small window in front of me. The ocean was full of smaller yet dangerous waves travelling incoherently. But a pattern had emerged from their movement. And one peak had formed to such enormous mass that it began towering over the ship. A rogue wave was going to hit our ship. I went into shock. Everything slowed down. Watching that wave grow. Every gut-wrenching moment vividly detailed.

First was the rain. The wind blew of the water from the top of the skyscraper wave and showered the ship in heavy downpour. This is when I remember the horn sounding. A useless attempt at a warning. The next I remember was feeling our enormous cargo ship being lifted out of the water with a dizzying speed and ease. The rogue wave rolling us over. I felt my body being accelerated by gravity with my back first into the seat, a direction I hadn’t expected gravity to pull. Looking back towards Joshua I hoped he had made it into the lifeboat with me. Only to see him being swept of his feet plummeting toward a background of blue, that I couldn’t determine if was ocean or sky.

Being snapped out of my catatonic state, I hammered my hand into the release button on the console. Then was the impact. First, I heard the sound of waves impact the cargo ship. It sounded like someone had pitch shifted the crumbling of an aluminum can. The sheer brutality of the sound a dire reminder of the frailty of steel. Then the lifeboat was sent to the heavens. This boat, which was designed to plummet into waters from great heights was dented by the force. I dare not imagine what had happened if the wave had collided with it in any other manner than head on. I was thrown out of my seat and only barely saved my head from colliding with the inside of the lifeboat by sacrificing an arm. The wrist of which was pulverised, the halfway point of the arm having bones rushing out the skin in feeble attempt to escape the rest of the waves massacre. Landing on the floor I felt the lifeboat accelerate upwards. Emerging from the waters I and it was sent airborne again. When it hit the water I came crashing to a halt on the floor.

Abusing the adrenaline to ignore the pain, I scurried to get on my feet. I looked out the window for any signs of life. By some miracle I found it. A tiny spec of man was in the waters not that far from me.

 

It was Joshua, but the wave had already claimed him. The impact of the water had mauled him worse than a big rig ever could. There was blood all around him, and I could only see one of his arms flailing in an attempt to help himself afloat. His movements looked like the spasms executed by a mechanical doll, preprogrammed and soulless. If He wasn’t already following the light, the only humane thing was to let him. The Ship was gone. Only white foam on water and shifting waves remained on the sea. And as if someone had put the water underneath the vessel to a boil, the ocean bubbled with the air from the ship which was now rushing to the surface. The sheer volume of air the enormous exhalation from the cavities of the sinking iron long that I had called home, and that now others would find their grave. The thought that this air meant that Mark could be trapped in their. Still being in panic and falsely clinging onto hope deep beneath the ocean. The thought filled me with terror.

I was watching a scene of complete erasure. No evidence left behind of the carnage that had taken so much from so many. And as a devilish answer to my newfound dispair, evidence was brought back from the deep. Crates of cargo started erupting up from the water. Like floats that had been submerged, their buoyancy lifted the crates so violently that they became airborne. Careening out of the water soaring into the skies. Their reentry into the waters defaced them to liken accordions by the force of it. As much as I could have risked searching for survivors, seeing 20 foot crates, tons of steel shot from the ocean, only to come hailing down again; I had to get away.

Stumbling to my feet I use my good arm to hoist me up on my feet. The waves where much harder to ignore now that the lifeboat itself was in the waters. What before had seemed like inconsequential currents of water now rooked me violently back and forth. It wasn't any longer a curtesy to hold onto the rows chairs, as I once again walked down towards the control panel. This time my other hand clutching only blood, air and my will to survive.

Reaching the control panel I used my good arm to do everything. And with the motor coming to life the lifeboat was inches from being hit by a crate shooting out of the waters. I gave her all she could muster, desperate to get away from here. But knowing fully well I was at the mercy of whatever direction that crate would come back down. It ended up slamming into the water on the other side of the boat. The crash against the water an ear deafening explosion, followed by the anguished cry of thick metal walls being bend out of shape. It had been filled with stuffed animals. Their inerts now flew out of the compressed crates perforated sides and covered my small windows in fluff and teddy bear gore.

I was sailing blind. Only guided by the sounds of doom. Sounds that only way to slowly shifted from from around me, to besides me and finally to behind me. I had escaped. 

 

Days later I was picked up as the only surviver. Many ships go down like this every year. Rogue waves are not a myth. They do happen. And you just have to pray, that it won’t be close to you.
