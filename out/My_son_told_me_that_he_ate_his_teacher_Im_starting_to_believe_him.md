“Hey Kiddo! How was school?” I asked, as Dylan trudged through the door. 

I received no response. Just a shrug as he tossed his backpack aside. 

That type of behavior had become increasingly more common since his father had walked out on us three months prior. I had come to expect a bit of a struggle when it came to opening up to me, but his refusal to make eye contact indicated that something was wrong. 

“Dylan, did something happen at school today?” 

He meekly glanced up at me, swinging his foot back and forth. “Yeah.” 

“What was it, Sweetie? You can always tell me if someone’s bothering you.” He muttered under his breath, shifting his gaze to the floor. 

“I’m sorry, Honey. What was that?” 

“I ate my teacher. Mrs. Hollingsworth. I ate her.” 

I was momentarily stunned. What kind of weird confession was that? I was expecting him to tell me that he flunked a math test or got a conduct mark. It was totally out of left field. I was at a loss for words. 

“Um… why did you do that?” I replied, opting to play along. This had to be some type of game. 

He bit his lip, and I could see tears welling in his eyes. “I forgot to write my spelling words, so Mrs. Hollingsworth gave me more homework.”

I crossed my arms. “Well then, it sounds to me like Mrs. Hollingsworth had it coming. Go get a jump on today’s assignments so you don’t have to eat any more teachers, alright?”

Dylan’s face lit up like a firework on the Fourth of July. “Okay, I will! Thanks for not being mad,” he said, grabbing his backpack as he bolted to his room. 

“What am I gonna do with that boy?” I chuckled, turning my attention back to the pot roast simmering on the stove. 

The next day, I had to drop Dylan off at school myself. For the first time ever, he’d missed the bus. I really didn’t mind taking him. It would give me a chance to ask Mrs. Hollingsworth if she knew anything about his odd revelation.

But Mrs. Hollingsworth wasn’t there. She had a substitute filling in for her. I thought it was a strange coincidence, but nothing to worry about. Surely, she was just sick, right? 

Now, I’m starting to think that’s not the case. 

I was again in the kitchen cooking dinner, when I heard the familiar slam of the front door and little feet darting down the hall. 

“Hey Buddy!” 

Silence. Nothing, aside from the door to Dylan’s room clicking shut. Odd, but not too out of the ordinary. At least, not until supper. 

“Dylan, time for dinner!”

“Just a second!” 

“No, food’s ready now! Come get it!” 

“I *said* just a second!”

My blood began to boil. Who the hell did he think he was talking to? I marched up to Dylan’s door and threw it open, exposing him playing a new videogame. 

“Dylan Lane Webster, you listen-” 

“No, Jessica. You listen to *me*.” 

My blood turned to ice. Dylan had never addressed me by my first name before. His voice was suddenly so deep and sinister. When my son turned to face me, I didn’t recognise the eyes that locked with mine. 

“Leave me alone, or I will consume you, mind, body, and soul - Just like I did to your husband.” 

All the blood rushed from my face, and I felt as if I was going to pass out. Did I hear that correctly? 

“Wh- what. Did you say?” I squeaked, my voice shaky and uneven. 

Dylan didn’t respond. He just kept battling his way through digital zombies on the television screen. 

I stumbled away, afraid that I was going to faint. I made it to the sofa in the living room, fighting through tears and the nauseating feeling in my gut. Dylan’s strange confession suddenly didn’t feel like a quirky little game anymore. 

Once I managed to ground myself in reality, I determined that I needed to know. If “eating” people was jargon for some other method of making them disappear, I was going to get to the bottom of it. 

I raced to my bedroom and began rifling through the drawer of my bedside table. I tossed aside trinkets and papers until I found what I was looking for. The note from the day that John had left. I’d kept it in case I needed it for legal proceedings. And in that moment, I thanked my lucky stars that I did. 

I turned on the lamp by my bed and began inspecting the note. My heart dropped when I noticed it. Just what I was afraid of. 

The letter had been hastily scrawled in Dylan’s handwriting. 

My head spun violently as I compared the note to a letter that Dylan had penned a few months prior. There was no mistaking it. My husband didn’t write that note - my son did. 

I began to hyperventilate as the weight of the implications bore down on me. This was all too crazy to wrap my head around. My husband - the man whom I had built a life with for over ten years - might *not* have walked out on me? It was too much to process. 

I must have blacked out, because the next thing I knew, sunlight was flooding into my eyes, and I could feel little fingers tugging at my blouse. 

“Mommy? Mommy, I missed the bus again. Can you take me?” 

I groggily opened my eyes and glanced at the alarm clock. 7:45. I shot up from bed, trying to get my bearings. I’d been knocked out for a whole twelve hours. How was that possible? 

I didn’t have time to mull it over. I ushered Dylan out of the room, while I raced around like a bat out of Hell. 

“Come on Buddy, Mommy overslept,” I said, emerging with my top halfway on five minutes later. All the while, Dylan stood there, quiet as a church mouse. 

We were only fifteen minutes late. Not bad, all things considered. I peered through the door to Dylan’s class when I dropped him off. Mrs. Hollingsworth still wasn’t there. 

That was enough to bring all of the events from the night prior crashing to the forefront of my mind. That was right. I was looking into my husband’s disappearance. 

I flew home to go over the evidence once more. I made it back in record time, and I immediately started searching for the note that I’d discovered the night before. 

But it was gone. 

I searched up and down for it - in the drawer, under the bed -  I even rifled through all the trash cans. Nothing. I knew for a fact that I hadn’t thrown it out… So did Dylan take it? 

That was the only logical explanation. He must have disposed of the letter to erase any proof of his wrongdoing. That, or I was starting to lose it. I honestly couldn’t tell which was worse. I took a series of deep breaths and closed my eyes. I knew what I had to do, but I wasn’t sure if I had the resolve to go through with it. 

I unlocked my phone and thumbed through the contacts, pausing when I reached the name I was searching for. My thumb hovered over the call button for a long time, before I finally pressed it. My heart jackhammered in my chest with every ring. Just when I thought it was going to go to voicemail, she answered. 

“Hello?” 

“Hi, Mrs. Daniels. It’s Jess.” 

I could hear an audible groan from the other end of the line. “What do *you* want?” 

I wanted to snap back at her with every fiber of my being. But fortunately, I managed to keep my composure. “I was just wondering if you’d heard from John recently. He hasn’t been home in a few days.” 

She scoffed. “I ain’t heard from that boy since his papa’s funeral. No thanks to you.” 

“Okay, that’s all I needed. Thanks.” 

I hung up before she could get another word in. John’s mother *really* didn’t like me - but she was the only one I could have asked. His father had passed away when he was in college, and he had no other living relatives to speak of. It was beginning to dawn on me that John might not have left of his own free will a few months back. He worked from home and only hung out with friends every few months or so. His employer had probably assumed that he’d found another job and that going ghost was his way of submitting his resignation. John was the type of person who could disappear and no one would bat an eye - no one except for me. 

I was fairly certain then that if Dylan didn’t directly cause my husband’s disappearance, he had a hand in it at the very least. I was starting to think that my outlandish theory about “eating” people being code for something wasn’t so crazy after all. Still, though, I needed evidence. I was going to have to catch Dylan in the act. 

I decided that my best course of action would be to keep a close eye on him while I could brainstorm a more concrete plan. I had to be cautious about things so that he wouldn’t follow through on his threat. 

When Dylan arrived home from school, I put on my best poker face. A whirlwind of emotions surged through me, but I kept repeating to myself that I only needed to stick it out for a bit longer. Little did I know, that sentiment would hold more truth than I ever would have thought. 

“Hey Buddy! How was your day?” I asked, beaming at my son as he trudged through the door. 

“It was good. Mommy, can we go to the park later? Pretty please? My friend wants to meet me there!” 

I eyed him skeptically. “Oh yeah? And who might this friend be?” 

Dylan glanced down and shoved his hands into his pockets. “Josh. You don’t know him.” 

“Mmm. And how did you meet this ‘Josh?’” 

“On the playground. Please, Mommy! I really wanna go,” Dylan insisted, grabbing my hand with his little fingers and staring up at me with pleading eyes. 

I pretended to mull it over, shifting my gaze to the ceiling. “Okay, we can go. But only *after* you finish your homework. Deal?” 

“Deal! You’re the best!” he shouted, before darting off to his room. 

Perfect. This would give me a chance to observe Dylan’s behavior around other kids. It felt wrong to be going behind my son’s back like that. But I had to get to the bottom of things. 

Dylan and I left for the park around five o’clock. When we arrived, a handful of children were already romping around the playground. Once we were within view, a boy with sandy hair and a gap-toothed grin waved Dylan over. My son gave me a quick glance, before darting off to meet his friend. 

I claimed a seat on an empty bench and pulled out a book from my purse. I must have let myself get sucked in, because when I looked up, I experienced every parent’s worst nightmare - I couldn’t find Dylan. I leapt up from the bench and hurriedly scanned the playground. He was nowhere in sight. 

“Dylan! Dylan, where are you?!” I yelled, my heart thundering in my chest. While I *was* suspicious of him, Dylan was still my son. He was my entire world, and I would be absolutely devastated if anything happened to him. 

I rushed over to the nearest adults and pleaded with them to help me. Fortunately, they were a sweet elderly couple watching their granddaughter swing on the monkey bars. 

“Hi, I’m sorry to bother you, but I can’t find my son. His name is Dylan, and he’s about this tall with brown hair and blue eyes. I’m pretty sure he has a Reptar shirt on. Have you seen him?” 

The old woman innocently met my gaze and returned a warm smile. “As a matter of fact, I have. That wouldn’t happen to be him, would it?” she asked, pointing to the nearby tree line. She was right. There was Dylan, leading his new friend into the woods. 

“Thank you so much,” I said, before trotting over to the trees. Why was Dylan going in there? He was never one to venture off without my permission. 

I followed the duo into the underbrush. I was about to call Dylan’s name to get him to come back. Whatever was going on, I wanted no part of it. But in the end, my curiosity won out. 

I tailed behind the boys, keeping a safe distance and ensuring that I didn’t make too much noise. They paused in a clearing, and I watched as Dylan surveyed his surroundings. I quickly ducked behind a bush, barely escaping his line of sight. 

I had to work to stifle my breathing. A feeling of dread had settled into my stomach. My intuition was telling me that something sinister was about to happen. I peeked my head out from my hiding spot, and I nearly passed out right there. 

I stayed crouched, frozen in terror, as my son pushed Josh to the ground with a strength that I didn’t know he was capable of. He loomed over him and whispered something inaudible. Then, his jaw unhinged like an anaconda and began to stretch. Wider and wider and wider, until his mouth was nearly the size of a toddler. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. 

Josh was visibly shaking. The poor boy was paralyzed, unable to tear his eyes away from the twisted scene before him. And then, without warning, Dylan pounced. 

He grabbed Josh and shoved his head inside his gaping maw. He fed his body through the opening, swallowing him inch by inch. The child’s guttural shrieks resonated in my ears, growing more and more muffled with each passing second. Once Josh’s shoes had disappeared down Dylan’s throat, his mouth returned to its normal size. What he did next will haunt me for the rest of my life. 

Without turning around, Dylan calmly said, “Mommy, if you tell *anyone* about what you just saw, *you* will be my next [meal."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorJunkie123/)
