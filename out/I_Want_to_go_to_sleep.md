  Please let me sleep.


  I think to myself as I look with frightened eye's at the alarm clock on my bedside table. 2:34 am. I get shivers all the way down my spine. I try to close my eye's again but I can't. I know what's in here with me, and I know it's watching.


  When morning comes rolling around my body relaxes. How many nights has been like this? I don't know. I just want it to end.


  I don't want to kill myself. No. That will be cowardly. Melatonin will work a little but the creature will just jerk me back away from my dreamland. Not that it matters. It affects my dreams too. 


  I go through work another day with bags underneath my eyes. My coworkers tell me I should maybe up the Melatonin. I just try to sleep in at lunch with my phone alarm at high volume that way I can get back to it. 


  Working stock in a grocery store at least let's me not think about going to bed at night. It frightens me. I take a bunch of 5 hour drinks to get me through.


  That night I have a dream. I'm walking on a wooden plank bridge to a big pond. It's sunny. The sun glancing on the tree's telling you to not look at it or you'll hurt your eyes. I embrace the light and run into the pond feeling the cold water enveloping around me. I can't swim outside of my dreamworld but hear I can.


  I laugh as i swim. Pushing my body with every stroke of joy I have. The water splashing my face is a delight. Then suddenly the sunlight that I was just embracing suddenly grows darker. 


  (No No) I think to myself as I look around the suddenly dark woods around me. My heart beating feverishly as I start to panic. Something big then brushes against my legs. I look afraid of what I might see and my heart drops as I see two shark fins swimming around the pond with me.


  I try to swim back to the wooden bridge but now my arms feel like they have weights tugging at them. I'm thinking to myself, I don't want to die, i don't want to die.


  As I now look up at the bridge which is not far from me I stop. Not that I can move I just can't. My body now feels like it's paralyzed all the way as I see a man covered in darkness with a black hat and jacket. The head that the hat covers looks up at me and waves. I then notice that the sharks were getting closer and I try to scream with all my might with no sound coming out. 


  I wake up covered in sweat as the sharks ate me. (What the hell was that?) I think to myself as go wash and dry the sheets. (I've never seen or encountered that before.) 


  The next night I went to bed again. I try my hardest to go to sleep. Eventually I do but something jerks me awake. I look around the darkness of the bedroom with my heart beating fast again as like the night before I feel paralyzed. 


  I look towards my closet and see that the outside doorknob is shaking. The closet door then slowly creaks open as all I see is more darkness. Then a petrified hand made of shadow reaches out and touches the doorknob. 


  It pushes the door open as I'm trying to wake myself up. Then a thought occured to me. Am I already awake? 


  I look in frightened terror as the thing comes out of my closet and walks towards me with it's feet burning the wood as it walks. As it stands on the edge of the bed it just looks at me.



  I can't tell you for how long. All I know is that I was crying and wanting to turn away from this thing. Why? Why is it here torturing me like this? When will I get a good night's sleep?


  The creature then moves away from the bed. It walks it's firery feet down back to the closet. With it's shadowed like hand it then grabs the doorknob and then closes the door. 


  When It was gone I got up. Turned on all the lights. It wasn't there. The footmarks that were it's pressence were also gone.


  I told all my coworkers at work what happened. They reassured me that it was probably just sleep paralysis and maybe I just saw something in it that terrified me.


  Later that night I surprised myself by finally going to sleep. Is my sleeping troubles gone? I ask myself with grate relief. I slept peacefully that night with great dreams with any horrid creatures getting me. 


  After a few days the bags under my eye's were gone. My coworkers were excited saying that I've been looking well and finally got a good night's sleep. I thanked each and every one of them for trying to help me. I'm glad i got good friends. 


  Update: While at the grocery store last night I was getting stuff needed for dinner. I was walking by myself in the parking lot. The light that I see everyday flickering that never gets fixed when I complain about it just started flickering fast.


  As I put my groceries in the car and went in a sensation went through me. It was a feeling that I knew all to well and I was starting to feel afraid again. 


  When I looked at that flickering light I see the same creature that I saw in my bedroom. It was just looking at me with that terrifying stare as that light turned on and off. 


  Then it was gone and I started the car and sped home. I was anxious to go to my house and go to bed again. Now all I want to do is sleep.
