I've been working a new shift for the past month or so, to try and make some extra money. Everything is so damn expensive these days, I feel like I had no choice but to increase my hours. Normally I work a 7-3, but it's just not paying the bills. 

I'm leaving my house at 2am as of late, this will get me on site usually by around 2:30am. It's long hours, but I'm surviving! I work out of my vehicle, and visit several different job locations during the course of a day. Sometimes I'm working in town, but most job locations are pretty remote. A view from my eyes would most likely show you farmland, or dense wooded areas. 

Anyways, for this last month, I've quickly noticed that the birds act quite peculiar during these odd hours. I'm no bird expert, so I guess it's possible that these behaviors are normal, but either way I started taking notes in my phone.

For my sake, I'm just going to copy and paste my notepad here. I've written down a few instances, along with my thoughts at that time:

**April 27th**

*A group of small, black birds are standing in the roadway. Maybe they're just trying to eat something? I am just finding it strange that they won't move for my vehicle!*

**May 5th**

*A hawk flew at my windshield, narrowly missing! There have been other occasions where birds have flown by my car, but this time seemed like it was on purpose! Maybe it's just me... Probably nothing out of the ordinary.*

**May 9th**

*I am parked on a dirt road. I just looked in my review mirror and there's an owl! It is literally just looking into my vehicle through the rear windshield! I never see owls, let alone have one this close.*

**May 18th**

*There are a lot of Turkey vultures in this area. I just drove past two of them eating a DEER. Just surprised I guess? I didn't know they would eat a deer.*

**May 25th**

*Most of the birds I saw during the wee hours of the AM today seemed like they were startled by something. Taking refuge in the trees very quickly. Again... Probably nothing, yet noted.*

**May 26th**

*The owl is back! It's about 3am, and I had just looked up from my laptop when I saw it's head slowly pop up from in front of the hood of my vehicle. I had to turn the radio down because of the voices, but I could still hear them. The owl just stared at me for a bit, and I guess I lost track of time... sun is coming up as I am typing this note.*

That concludes my notes for now. I'm going to keep recording these weird instances with the birds, and if anyone has any knowledge on bird behaviors, I'd love to hear your two cents!

Might have to take some time off work to get my arm checked out, it started hurting suddenly in one spot. 

Anyways, so long for now!
