I work with an Aeromedical evac unit for the military. Our job is to treat and evacuate wounded soldiers in dangerous situations. Recently, my unit was assigned to a military facility known as the Tantalus Site where they developed a deadly biological toxin that wrought unimaginable havoc on their test subjects. A leak at the compound was reported before the entire place went dark.

When we arrived, we encountered a mess of people torn apart by something monstrous, I was chased by emaciated humanoids, and we were told by the final survivor that the creatures were prisoners of war who’d been used as test subjects. Despite degenerating on a cellular level, they still retained some degree of intelligence; being smart enough to harvest the organs needed to sustain their ever-depleting bodies and to mimic ordinary human behavior. Like closing the main doors and locking us in this infernal hellhole with them.

Now we’re locked in here and we have no way of knowing how to get out.

***************

Horror settled over the group like a fog. I felt blood rush past my ears. 

Locked in an isolated location. Only a few people knew where we were. Three feet of steel and rock shutting us off from the world. No other potential ways out. 

And a pack of intelligent, feral humanoids painfully aware of our presence here. 

“Well, what do we do now?” Bronson asked softly.

Everyone started sharing their opinions all at once. Fight, call for help, bed down. The usual. 

Keys eventually got control of things. Her cropped blonde hair gleamed dirtily in the flickering light of the lab. The slow drip of Ketterman’s brains oozing onto the floor punctuated the silence. 

“Let’s go over what we know and take it from there,” she said. “Now Ketterman told us he was injured trying to fix the controls that opened the door which means that not only is there a way to open the fucking things from inside, but they’re close enough to this lab for an injured middle-aged man to stagger back too with those things on his heels. Beyond that, we know these creatures can be hurt. The one Sheaf shot at retreated immediately. We also know we can still get a comms signal out, weakened or not, because Doctor Fuckface was patching through requests for help to us.” She pointed toward the door. 

“I say we go out there quietly, weapons primed, and head for the control center. We’ll find the door controls and have a team work on fixing that while another two work on comms. The rest will provide cover. Any questions?”

No one said a word. 

“Good. Sheaf, Sikes, you two will work on the door. Larson and I will work on the comms.” She nodded to Bronson, Connors, and myself. “You three will stand guard.” She had Sheaf hand his rifle over to me. Not everyone in our unit came armed to the gills. We had three rifles between us, the rest had pistols, and all of us carried standard army knives. This was the first time I ever regretted not having a heavier-duty gun. Sheaf’s M4A1 felt heavy in my hands, but the weight was reassuring. I checked to ensure a round was already chambered and the safety on before doing the same with my pistol. I also loosened my knife in its scabbard. You could never be too careful.

“Also, no firing indiscriminately,” Keys mentioned. “Two round taps only. Oh, and try to keep in mind that we’re in a place where almost every surface is stone, metal, or concrete. So physics is not our friend. Be mindful of ricochets.” 

Another obstacle to add to our growing list. 

Together, we waited and listened. We could hear the creatures skittering around the compound, squealing and clicking at one another. I began to realize the sounds were less random than they seemed. A form of communication these things created to replace their voices. Did the gas rot their vocal cords away too? It seemed likely. 

For some reason that saddened me more than scared me. Unwilling human experiments suffering a dark hell in the bowels of some remote mountain facility. Their bodies shutting down on them like cancerous tumors. No one deserved that.

I shook my head and returned to the present. Beyond the door, we heard the creatures recede into the darkness back to their lair. Keys made us wait for fifteen minutes to pass in perfect silence before she cracked open the door and had Connors stalk forward a pace or two with his gun. I came right after him, then the others with their pistols drawn and Bronson in the back to cover our tail. 

“Remember,” Keys ordered softly, “as quiet as possible.” 

As one, we crept out into the main tunnel, guns bristling in both directions, and made our way toward the center. 

Immediately, I could feel a difference in the air. A staleness that came with a lack of airflow through the mountain. The smells of human remains and chemically tainted flesh were more prevalent. I squeezed the handgrip on Sheaf’s weapon so tight it whitened my knuckles. Double taps to preserve ammo, Keys had said. The cool metal of the rifle rubbed against my cheek as I imagined firing at one of those things. As we trekked toward the front, I gently nudged Sheaf. 

“How hard was it to hit that thing?” I asked softly. 

“Hard,” the larger man replied. “It was fast and agile and ugly as a motherfucker. But it ain’t invincible.” 

I nodded. 

“Might sound silly,” he added as we closed in on the facility center, “but just imagine you’re back home plugging cans with a .22. Relax, aim, squeeze, fire. That’s how I was when your ass came booking it back up here like your nuts were on fire.” 

“Copy that,” I said with a quiet laugh. After a moment, I did as he recommended and relaxed my stance and grip. My hands stopped shaking and my heart rate slowed. 

Behind me, Sikes called out quietly: “Found it.” 

I didn’t turn to see what she’d found. Connors and I kept our barrels trained on the graveyard of lab equipment and bodies in the main cavern, roving for the slightest movement. We let Sheaf tap us and tug us back into a glass-windowed room elevated five feet above the cave floor. Within, a bank of dusty controls, computers, and other equipment sat cracked and stained in blood. A hand severed at the elbow still clung to one of the monitors, the flesh blackened around the tips. Larson carefully removed it before Sheaf and Sikes set to work figuring out where the controls for the door were. Larson and Keys headed for a battered radio station ten feet further down. I took point by the door with Connors beside me and Bronson situated himself beside a shattered window between our two groups. 

At first, things went surprisingly well. Larson and Keys had the most success. They managed to open up the radio and patch things up enough to comb the waves for a signal. The low whine of static seemed deafening to me, but I supposed the risk was worth it. 

Sheaf and Sikes faced a more difficult situation. The controls for the entrance were simple enough, but the lever designed to open and close the massive door was jammed by a bloody shin bone. I wondered if it had been rammed in there on purpose. It looked as though someone, probably Ketterman, had hacked away at it. Splinters of meat and gristle glistened amid the gears so Keys had Sikes carefully work the matter free with her knife. Sheaf oversaw the electronics. Despite the damage to the surrounding equipment, the controls had clearly been built to withstand the corrosive environment of a cave. Blood matted most surfaces, but underneath the damage was mostly superficial. What worried Keys the most was the potential of wrecking the lever’s inner controls even further as the shin bone got removed. Sikes seemed painfully aware of this as she continued to slice away slivers of it in microscopic amounts. 

Connors and I remained completely focused on our surroundings. He kept his sight on the tunnel and the stairs leading up to the control room, I swept the depths of the control center. I did my best to keep Sheaf’s advice in mind. 

Bronson stood by the shattered window, equally alert while Keys rotated the radio dial through different stations. A sudden crackle got everyone’s attention as she broke through into the outside world. “....Base… 74-.... This is…. -oral… Lancing with… hear me?” It sounded so good to hear someone else’s voice in here that I almost laughed. 

Keys maintained her composure as she spoke, though the relief on her face was evident. “We can hear you, Corporal Lancing. This is Captain Keys Jameson with the 112th Aeromedical Unit out of Camp Hartwell Marine Base. We were tasked with securing the Tantalus Site. Coordinates are three-three point...” She listed off the coordinates and then spent the next few minutes bouncing back and forth with the man on the other line. We weren’t sure how much information went through, but just the idea that someone beyond our initial contacts knew about us sent a wave of relief through my body. 

I was still smiling when Bronson had his throat ripped out.

The creature must’ve waited in the shadows of the ceiling above us. It attacked so quickly that Bronson didn’t even have time to scream. He still had his gun leveled toward the broken window when a pair of greasy, gangly arms sliced out of the gloom, wrapped their claws around his neck and face and yanked him over the control bank with an incredible amount of force. 

Bronson’s gun went off, firing bullets indiscriminately as two fingers sank into the flesh under his chin and exploded out of his mouth. Blood and teeth poured onto the equipment array while the creature used his lower jaw to drag him forward into the cavern. I caught a fleeting, horrid glimpse of the thing’s face. It reminded me of cadavers we’d operated on when we removed the skin from the muscle to study facial anatomy. Only this thing’s face was covered in weeping yellow sores, blackened flesh, and pitted fissures. Strands of hair clung to its scalp and dangled in front of bugged-out eyes. It lacked lips and a nose, bearing a ragged hole in place of both, and its teeth were reed-thin, the color of rotted blood. Those teeth sank into Bronson’s face as he was yanked onto the cavern floor below, his screams coming out in pitiful gargles. 

Without thinking, I ran and threw myself through the window after them and came crashing down on the humanoid’s legs. 

It screamed and ripped its jaws away from Bronson’s face, taking most of his cheek and ear with it. I tried squeezing off a shot from my rifle, but couldn’t make enough room. Instead, I ripped my knife out of my belt, and plunged it blindly into the thing’s chest and stomach. The blade drove in like a nail through rotted wood. The creature screamed and scrabbled under me, cutting at my fatigues with its ragged claws. Flesh sloughed off its body, falling away around the knife and I kept cutting. I barely registered the needle-sharp talons raking across my body. Shallow grooves sliced into my arms, chest, and abdomen, blood saturated my hands as I shoved them into the creature’s guts, letting fury propel me as I disemboweled its rotting insides. 

The creature let out a horrendous wail and bashed my head back against the concrete. I couldn’t register the pain. Too much adrenaline. My eyesight went fuzzy, tarry entrails squelched in my hands, blood seeped out of places it shouldn’t, and the stench of death swirled out of the thing’s awful mouth. 

A gunshot. 

Then another. 

The creature’s face caved in on itself as high-powered bullets ripped its head apart. Blackened tissue and pieces of skull oozed down onto my face and into my mouth. The taste of expired meat seeped between my gums. I coughed and spat and shoved the fucking thing off me. 

Hands slid under my armpits and hauled me up. Connors supported me while Sheaf grabbed Bronson’s limp body and slung him over one shoulder. Keys grabbed my gun and ordered us to get back to the lab. 

We were about to head out before I yelled for them to stop, lurched back around, raised by boot, and brought it down squarely on the creature’s head, crushing it into a mass of black and red pulp.

“Rot in hell, you bloodthirsty fuck!” 

I stomped again. I didn’t want it coming back. This was insurance.

“Come on!” Connors hauled me back the way we came. Keys shouted some more. Bronson stained Sheaf’s shoulders with dark blood. Larson and Sikes became our lookouts. 

From the bowels of the facility came a swelling wail as if in answer to the one given by the creature I’d killed. The tunnel came alive with the sounds of chitters and squeals as we lugged ourselves back into the lab. 

Only when Sikes slammed the door did I finally feel the adrenaline abate. Sheaf dumped Bronson on one of the lab tables and Connors lowered me into a chair.

Larson tried to inspect me, but I waved him to Bronson. “Him first, man!” 

A strange look crossed over Larson’s face. A mixture of sadness and guilt. 

“Bronson’s dead.” He said it matter-of-factly. I shook my head, my vision sloshing in my skull. 

“Like fuck he is! Check his pulse! Staunch his wounds! Fucking do something!”

Larson lowered himself to my eye level and slowly tilted my head to where Bronson lay. Even in my frenzied state, I could see he was gone. Most of his throat and lower face were gone. A gaping hole was all that was left, stained with slimy remains. My eyes tracked over him to the next table and something chilled me to my bones. 

“Where the fuck’s Ketterman?”
