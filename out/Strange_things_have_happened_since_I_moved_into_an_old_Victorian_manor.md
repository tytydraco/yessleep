I inherited a Victorian manor from my grandmother who passed quite suddenly and unexpectedly. She was old, sure, but she was healthy as a horse. From my childhood, I don’t remember much about the old manor. Just that it was beautiful and full of mystery. 

I started packing my belongings a week after the will was read. I sold my car, I left my home, and I felt like I was opening a new chapter of my life, one full of excitement. 

The town that my grandmother lived in is quite old, too. And there is a slight anomaly. Cars won’t work past the town’s borders, so there are only carriages within. Most of the residents forgo electronics of any sort, as they’re just as likely not to work. It’s a quaint yet cozy little town. It’s the type of place where everybody knows everybody, and news travels fast.

I vaguely recognized the baker, although she is a bit older now than when I last saw her. “Hello, dear,” she says. “I’m sorry to hear about your grandmother, but it is so very good to see you again.”

“Likewise,” I reply. “I’m afraid I don’t have time to chat at the moment. I’m exhausted from my trip and I just want to get settled.“

With that, I am on my way. I found a carriage driver willing to bring me wherever it is I wished to go. He has a somewhat soft, southern drawl. “Hello there lass. Where is it I’ll be taking you this fine evening?”

“The old Victorian manor, on…” I start.

He cuts me off, his face blanched. There’s a small handful of Victorian manors, but only one old Victorian manor in the area. “You don’t wanna go there, now lass. Nobody except your grandma would step within a couple hundred feet after some people went missing. It’s said to be haunted.”

I give him a look. “This quaint little town is scared of a ghost story?” I ask incredulously. “That’s fine and all… but, well, I don’t believe in the supernatural.”

He sighs, knowing there’s probably no way to change my mind based solely on how stubborn my granny was. “Well fine then lass, but don’t say I didn’t warn ya. I’ll take you to the gates, but that’s as far as I’ll go. I won’t enter that accursed land.”

The soft clip clopping of the horses’ hooves intermingled with the restless wind, creating a melody that was almost hypnotic as we ride along the cobblestone road. Before I know it, we are at the gate. 

“Thank you for taking me,” I say softly, paying him for the trip.

“You be safe now, ya hear?” He says before turning around and heading back into the town. 

I pull up the handles of my luggage and guide them along after me, rolling on their wheels. After the quarter mile walk down to the manor from the gate, I notice it almost looks as though the old place is staring back at me. I chalk it up to the carriage driver putting the idea that it’s haunted in my head. 

I head inside, a dusty floral aroma instantly filling my nostrils. As I turn on the lights, I could swear I saw a shadow skitter in the way a shadow shouldn’t be able to. This time, I chalk it up to exhaustion from the trip to the town. I head to the room I stayed in during visits to my grandma as a little girl, already knowing it’s the room I want as mine. 

I open my luggage and start putting my folded clothes in the wardrobe. I set my phone on the nightstand after trying it. It won’t turn on. No surprise there. Not because it’s dead, but because like I said, electronics have a way of not often working. At least the ones like computers, laptops, and handheld gaming devices. The fridge and freezer work just fine, as do the toaster and the oven. 

At any rate, I feel like I may be getting a little sidetracked. That night, after falling asleep, I woke up at three in the morning. For no apparent reason. But then I realize… the temperature in the room has dropped. Significantly. I shiver and curl in on myself under the covers. Then I see them. There are three tall figures in the room. Their skin is too tight, and their eyes… they’re burning. 

I wonder if maybe someone is playing a prank, and I sit up. But that’s when I notice they’re… floating? Their feet aren’t solid on the ground. I turn on my nightstand lamp, and with a loud, unholy shriek, they disappear. The room temperate is suddenly normal again, instead of frigid. 

The rest of the night, I don’t sleep. This happens the next several nights. I randomly wake up at 3:00 am. The room is cold, and then there they are. After a week, shadows start to move alongside the figures showing up, undulating in ways no shadow should. Then a mirror suddenly appears. Ancient. Ornate. There’s grime where the glass meets the frame. It sits on the floor near the wardrobe. I know it wasn’t there before. 

A couple more weeks pass, the same pattern again. But when I wake up at 3:00am for the umpteenth time, I make the mistake of looking in the mirror for several seconds. Suddenly, my body flits… in and out of this material plane. One second, I’m sitting on the bed. The next, I’m among the shadows that seem to be living, looking at myself sitting on my bed. 

The shadows whisper to me, promises of peace, of belonging. If only I’ll just join them there in the mirror, like so many others before. In the mirror, the figures won’t bother us. 

“Get out of my head!” I screech. Suddenly, I start to flit between the planes again, this time brought back to my body sitting on the edge of the bed. This happens again and again, night after night. Until I’m on the verge of losing it. I search the old Victorian manor for clues, for explanations. 

I find my grandma’s correspondence with someone who claims to be a ghost hunter. Van Holden. He’s scheduled to come tomorrow. I write him a letter, explaining that my grandma is dead, but I still need his help. I don’t know if I’ll last another night. The flitting between planes is getting worse. I’m starting to believe the shadows. That things would be better if I just joined them. I’m losing my mind. If I haven’t lost it before Van Holden gets here, I’ll update you about his visit.
