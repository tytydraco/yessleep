I had an old Rottweiler mixed named Wyatt. I’ve had him since I was a baby, he was probably around 16-17. I would let him outside every few hours to prevent him from having any accidents inside the house because of his old man bladder. He usually stays outside for 10 minutes or so (sometimes longer so he could lay in the sun,) then he scratches at the door to be let back in. I let him out a few weeks back in the evening, he never scratched on the door. After 45 minutes or so I began to get worried, so I went out to check on him. I spent a good 20 minutes searching before I found his body behind my shed, his head torn off from his body. I couldn’t find his head.

His body had no bite marks and no wounds, just his head ripped off. It wasn’t a clean slice, like a sword; it was like it was TORN. There was no signs of struggle around, and I didn’t hear him yelp or bark, absolutely nothing.

This same exact thing happened to my cat Smokey a while back, but he was covered in bite marks. I came to the conclusion it was probably coyotes, but I no longer believe that because I don’t think a coyote can kill a 100lbs dog without leaving any marks and proceed to tear the dogs head off, it doesn’t make sense.

I also had 2 of my cats dead a month or so back, too. Their heads weren’t torn off, but they were laid in front of my door in a way that means they could’ve only be placed there by someone. They were stacked on top of each other, and cats don’t naturally just die stacked on top of each other.

I’ve called the cops, and they’ve come to my house and told me they literally cannot do anything without evidence of someone being on my property. They told me not to worry too much because it probably was coyotes or other stray dogs. I’ve set up 4  motion detection security cameras around my property, and the cops recommended that I leave the house until I feel safe. I’m currently staying upstate in a motel until I feel safe enough to return. My friend Malory is watching the animals for me.

I’m just really scared and don’t know what to do. I already set up cameras and I’m staying upstate for a few days to get my bearings back, but I just feel so uncomfortable and unsafe in my home. Any advice on what I can do to protect myself and my animals would be appreciated.

Also, a side note; if this is someone who is reading this that has done this as some sort of sick joke, I will literally slaughter you like you did to my own pets. You don’t deserve to rest easy at night after the shit you’ve done to me and my innocent animals. Rot in hell.
