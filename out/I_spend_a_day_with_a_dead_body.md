My name is Eddie. I was the only child. My mom was a heart patient, she was really sick and couldn't even get up from bed. So me & dad had to take a lot of care of her. One day my dad had to go out of the city for a business trip so I had to take care of mom alone.

"Ed, I have to go for an important trip. I will be back tomorrow I promise" Dad said.

"Don't worry dad I am 12, have a save trip I know how to care for mom" I said proudly crossing my arms.

"You are all grown up, young man" Dad said patting my shoulder.

Then he kissed my forehead. Locked the door from outside. I watched him from the window. His eyes almost teard up.

"I have locked the door from outside for safety reasons. At night lock all the windows, okay"

I nodded "yes" while waving at him. He waved back, sat in his car and left. I sat on the chair next to mom's bed and put my hand on hers. She smiled. My eyes teared up from what mom has going through. 

"Mom, I don't want to see you like this anymore" 

"I am fine honey, you don't have to worry about me, you should focus on your studies" Mom said grabbing my hand tightly.

"Why don't I have to, you are going through so much and I can't even do anything" I said in an angry tone.

"I am taking my medicines, I will recover soon" 

"I hope" I said giving her tablets and glass of water from the side-table.

I was almost dark outside so I stood up closed all the windows in the house, then I cooked myself some instant ramen. Then went to her room locked the room and slept beside her. I woke up in the middle of the night feeling thirsty. I tried to open the door but it wasn't opening.

I creeped out. I tried to wake up mom but...to my surprise, she was DEAD. I was in shock and terror. I screamed loudly again and again and again for help. I was in so much fear that I sat in the corner of the room. I called dad repeatedly but he didn't answered. I kept looking at the corpse of my mom. Although I act brave in front of dad, I am just a normal teenager that is scared of everything. Just Imagine yourself locked in a room with a corpse. You would definitely faint.

"M-Mom, please wake up! please!"

"Mom wake up! I am so scared please!"

I kept screaming for help, crying, I had multiple nightmares that the corpse stand up straight and turned into a monster and approached me. I passed out in the corner. I got back to consciousness at 7 in the morning. I felt dizzy, my hands were shaking I picked up my phone and called dad. Luckily, he picked up.

"Dad!, Please hurry up home. Mom is d-d-dead" I said crying my lungs out"

"What!" He shouted.

The phone disconnected. I knew whe was rushing back home. At 9 in the morning I heard a car stopping in front of our house and the front door opening.

"Ed!, Ed!, Clara!, Clara!," He shouted.

"Dad!, Here, The door is locked"

"Honey, I am going to open it okay! don't worry"

I was crying loudly. Dad opened the door with the key in his hand. I felt relieved, I hugged him tightly. We both sat next to mom crying.

"You should have called 911" 

"I was so scared I forgot" 

We both hugged crying looking at moms corpse, her eyes went hollow, her skin was pale. She died of heart attack.

At first I wouldn't look scary, but when you actually spend a day with a corpse. Locked, alone, hopeless.

"You will never feel it until you experience it"

Fin.
