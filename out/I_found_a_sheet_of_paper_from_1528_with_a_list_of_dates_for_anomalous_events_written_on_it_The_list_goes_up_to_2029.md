I found it while replacing some floorboards in my bedroom. It was a metal case that had become rusted over who knows how long. I opened it up, expecting to find some old books, an old map, or whatever. What I found instead were three sheets of paper. Each of them were yellow, clearly well worn out by time. The year 1528 was written on the bottom right corner of each of them, which made a ton of sense.


Two of the three pages were filled with writing in some language I wasn't fluent in. The third page, however, had writing I could understand. It was a list of calendar dates with names beside them. The earliest one was January 16, 1529, with the name Kingston written beside it. There were dozens of these calendar dates and names on the page. Two rows of them side by side.


I flipped the page over to find there were just as many calendar dates on that side as well. They too were listed in two rows. The front side of the page had dates going up to March 16, 1765. The back side had dates going up to January 1, 2029.


I was curious as to who these were for. It looked like a randomised list. Whoever wrote these wrote them for a reason, but what was it? The closest day to the present day was April 29, 2023, which, at the time I read it on the paper, was the next day. I didn't think anything of it. It looked totally arbitrary to me. What were the surnames all about? I set the pages back into the box, then I went on with my business.


The next day, or more specifically, earlier today, I was sweeping my kitchen while letting some music play on the TV. As I went on with cleaning, the song that was playing slowed down. At first, I thought it was a glitch. There was no version of that song that suddenly slowed down like that halfway through. The song got abnormally slower and slower until it sounded like animalistic screeching. I turned my attention to the TV. The screech-like noises gave me chills, so I changed the channel to a different music channel. The same screeching was playing on that one too.


I texted my friend, Ashley, but she told me they weren't hearing any screeching.


"It's just SZA lol"


I turned the TV off. In the absence of the TV's noise, I heard an ominous hum. It sounded like it was coming from outside. I walked up to the window, but it was too foggy to see anything. As I pondered the source of the noise, a cracking noise came from behind me. I looked back and saw that my TV screen was cracked. Right in the middle of all the cracks was something that confused me. Teeth. There were regular, human-like teeth sticking out of the screen.


I heard something shatter behind me. I turned around and saw the ceiling light cover had shattered all over the floor. One of the pieces had a similar set of teeth growing out of it, with veins growing inside the glass, which appeared to be melting.


"What on this green Earth is happening?" I whispered to myself.


I then heard what sounded like the shattering of the mirror in the bathroom. I was already weirded out by what I had seen so far. I didn't need to use the bathroom, so I wasn't going in there.


There was no way I wasn't going to talk to anybody about this. I took a picture of the teeth, then sent it to my friend. A minute later, he responded to me with a string of messages.


"The same thing is happening to me"


"They're everywhere"


"I was just bitten by a shard of a kitchen plate"


"I'm bleeding rn"


They bite?! Once that was implied, I went cold. I sweeped up the shards of glass and dumped them in the trash bin. One of the plates in the cupboard made a sound. Not seeing this stuff happening was unnerving. I opened the cupboard and took the plate. As I set it down on the counter, I took a look at the sight. The plate was shattered, with one of the pieces of course being adorned with teeth. This time, red veins were protruding from the piece as the piece melted.


Maybe melted isn't the right term. More like it changed material, if that makes sense.


The roar of a helicopter went right over the house. After it passed, there was a knock at the door, followed by a woman's voice.


"Please answer the door, this is an urgent matter."


I answered the door. A woman in a suit stood on my doorstep, holding an FBI badge.


"A scientific division of the FBI has detected a brash anomaly within this town and so we will be closing it off," she said, with urgency. "You cannot leave the town without special permission. You will be notified face to face when the quarantine has been lifted."


"So… this is about the teeth," I said.


"We understand the teeth are concerning and we will be doing whatever we can to stop them from growing," she said.


"I'll definitely be keeping up with the news," I said.


"We're going to be keeping this investigation, along with the anomaly, under seal until we've determined it's appropriate to release information about them to the public," she said. "Have a good day."


She walked away into the fog. I shut the door, thinking about the fact that the government was watching this. A slight pit formed in my stomach as it occurred to me that this situation was so special, the FBI had to cover it up for a while. Most people wouldn't know about this event for years, considering the FBI only releases information when there's a public interest group or an FOIA request remanded by the Justice Department.


Where does this anomaly even come from? As I thought to myself, the bag covering the inside of the trash bin began moving until there was this tiny little ripping noise. Then, I saw movement in the corner of my eye. It was the plate shard, crawling by the sink. Its teeth were moving in a biting motion. A pit formed in my stomach.


I reached into the cupboard for a cup to place on the thing like it was a bug, but every single cup had that freaky mouth on it. One of the cups happened to shatter as I was looking.


I managed to sweep all that stuff into the garbage and threw it all outside. I threw the TV outside as well. The tickling I felt on the palm of my hand as I carried the TV by its sides didn't make me feel any better. Back inside, I put a cleaner pair of shoes on just in case I would accidentally step on one of those mouth things while walking between rooms.


Luckily, my phone was still working and didn't have a mouth. My friend sent me a photo of the inside of the back of his TV. Veins had wrapped around everything, and the batteries were BLOATED. I felt like puking. All of a sudden, everything was turning into a living thing. I took a hammer outside and smashed my TV a dozen times. Purple blood began dripping out of the cracks. I went back inside, not planning on even looking at that TV again.


I sat on my couch, looking around to make sure no mutant creatures were crawling around in at least the living room. I texted Ashley about the thing going on in town. She lived only one town over, so she wouldn't have been caught up in this or informed at all. After I hit send, my message wouldn't go through. It kept giving me an error message.


As I grew annoyed with the error, I recalled the sheet of paper with the dates.


It couldn't be…


Was it really hinting at what was happening today?


I fished the paper out and looked at the date again. April 29, 2023... my name... Although it was happening across town, but I guess I was supposed to be the main victim?


I decided to go through each of the dates and names to see if the paper was legit. Many of the calendar dates had common names beside them. I typed the first one into Google to see which event it referred to. All that came up were official websites for various cities named Kingston. Advanced search parameters didn't help yield anything either. Kingston was such a common name, so of course nothing was going to come up.


The five up the list only gave me the same lack of information. So was it a coincidence? I looked at each of the surnames, searching for a name that was familiar to me. One name stumped me. It wasn't a person's name. It was the Paris Catacombs. Just those two words with the date of September 16, 1788 written beside them. Thing is, the Paris Catacombs weren't named the 'Catacombs' until 1786, so the paper it was written on had to have been written around then rather than in 1529.


At first, nothing came up about the Paris Catacombs on that date. There weren't even any legends from 1778 in general. I decided to put the search terms in quotation marks, but nothing came up. I put a website-specific search parameter beside it in the search bar. Nothing. I put that search query in quotation marks. I found something, at the very least.


It was a post titled "Legends of the Paris Catacombs?" The initial post asked for lesser-known legends from the Catacombs. It seemed far-fetched since legends always seemed to trend and get overblown, but one of the comments suggested something else.


"My great grandparents lived in France. They had a story had been passed down for a couple of centuries that I've been told repeatedly throughout my whole life so far. Apparently, my grandpa's great-grandmother stumbled upon the catacombs and saw a yellow mist that moved on its own. She heard noises she had never heard before coming from deep inside the grave, and things she couldn't describe poked out of the mist. I always thought something like that would've made the news, but apparently nobody talked about it aside from her and two others, according to my grandpa."


After a few dozen more empty searches, both with and without quotation marks, I came across one dated December 15, 1900. It was named Flannan. Upon Googling it, I came across an event that happened on the date in which three lighthouse keepers disappeared off the coast of Scotland. Their disappearance remains a mystery to this day, apparently. There are lots of articles about this. They're interesting. It turns out the cause really did seem unknown.


Did it really just fly under the radar? Did some creepy thing just happen and nobody knew about it? Someone could've died and nobody would ever be able to find them again, and they wouldn't know why? The person who disappeared had to have known why… they experienced it firsthand! If they weren't dead but trapped, nobody would know.


I felt cold thinking about it, so I moved on to the next familiar surname.


Looking up "Rugh-Mast 1915" brought up images of a run down house in Ohio. The origin of the house was unknown, but over the years, it was subjected to easily disprovable legends and accusations of paranormal activity. Between the 1850s and the 1910s, the property was owned by the Rugh family. That was the time most of the paranormal stuff was alleged to have occurred. I couldn't find anything about what supposedly happened there on March 10, 1915. In fact, there was a general lack of verifiable information about anything that went on there.


Looking up November 24, 1974 Ackley paranormal yielded results about a court case. One involving a house in New York that was ruled legally haunted by the New York Supreme Court back in 1991. The owner of a house that had a reputation of being haunted by ghosts had to admit to such a thing when selling the house.


I couldn't find anything about what supposedly happened on November 24th 1974. I emailed both the owners and the previous owners of the house, asking them if they knew what happened at the house on that day. One of them -I'm not going to say who for privacy- got back to me. This is what their message read:


"Is this a day you randomly selected? How did you get any clue that something happened then?"


"I'm checking for a hoax," I responded.


"A hoax? Who told you? I guess word always gets out somehow. I'm not going to say a thing about what happened. It's too discomforting and I would sound insane," they replied.


It was interesting there'd be something they didn't want to mention out of fear of sounding insane, since it was mentioned that ghosts casually interacted with those living in the house on a regular basis. Especially during the 70s.


The following calendar dates yielded the same type of thing. Some with no event popping up in any search results, others in which an event that happened on the respective date did come up. Here are some dates that stood out to me for some odd reason.


October 13, 1986 — Queen Anne


March 17, 1995 — East Shore


June 3, 2002 — Bower


March 17, 2005 — Monte Vista


March 23, 2007 — Ken


October 8, 2008 — Welland


November 11, 2011 — Morris


March 5, 2014 — Malay


October 4, 2016 — Grove


July 27, 2022 — Matthews and Livingston


And then that last one… January 1, 2029 — Alt. Smith… I'm guessing the lack of room on the page was the reason it was the last one written, but if predating all those events was important, wouldn't there be another page? I mean, if it all happened to fit entirely on one page, that would be a nice coincidence. Either way, something was going to happen to an Alt. Smith on the first day of 2029.


My phone is making an unsettling erratic buzzing noise. I'm going to post this right now, then I'm going to figure out this anomaly.
