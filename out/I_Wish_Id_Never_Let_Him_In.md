I always thought online dating was a modern convenience—until I met Dev. In my early twenties and working long hours in tech, I craved genuine connection. When I matched with him on a dating app, his profile radiated an enigmatic charm. Our conversations were easy, his texts warm and attentive, and soon we arranged a date.

Dev drove 100 miles to meet me. Our first date unfolded in a picturesque park, where autumn leaves danced in the crisp air and sunlight filtered through the trees like liquid gold. We talked about everything—from our favorite movies to our wildest dreams. Later, over dinner at a cozy restaurant, his humor and intelligence made me forget the long drive he had taken. I felt a spark of possibility.

After dinner, we returned to my small apartment. I was still buzzing from the evening when Dev’s demeanor shifted. What started as subtle quirks soon became bizarre behavior. While I set his bag on the table, Dev’s eyes darted around, unsettled, as if searching for something invisible.

“I’m sorry if I seem odd,” he said, his voice trembling slightly. “I—I have a condition. It makes me extremely hungry… an insatiable hunger.”

I frowned, thinking it was just an eccentric quirk he’d mentioned in passing. “Hungry? Like you haven’t eaten enough?”

“No,” he replied, his tone darkening. “It’s different. I crave… things. And I need you to help me find food.” His words sent a shiver down my spine. At first, I assumed he meant something exotic or perhaps a bizarre dietary fix. But his eyes, wide and frantic, told a different story.

Unsure how to respond, I offered to order takeout, hoping to diffuse the tension. Dev’s response, however, was chilling. He stood abruptly and walked over to the living room window, pressing his hand against the cold glass as if trying to summon something. The wind outside moaned like a living thing.

“Emma,” he said, turning to face me with an intensity that made my heart race, “please, go to the kitchen and get me something to eat. I can’t— I can’t control it.”

I hesitated, my mind a jumble of confusion and alarm. “Dev, what exactly do you mean? What are you craving?”

Before he could answer, his expression contorted into something half-human, half…something else. In one fluid motion, he strode over and slammed the front door shut, trapping us inside. I reached for the doorknob, but it wouldn’t budge. My pulse pounded in my ears as Dev’s voice lowered to a near-whisper.

“Call 911, Emma. Please,” he said urgently, his tone laced with panic and something more sinister. “There’s a guy under your bed.”

My breath caught. “What? Under my bed? What are you talking about?”

Dev stepped toward me, his eyes glistening with a desperate intensity. “I’m not joking. Listen—go now, call 911. Tell them… tell them what’s down there.” His hand reached out, almost pleadingly.

I fumbled for my phone, every instinct screaming to run. The room, once familiar and safe, now felt claustrophobic and hostile. I dialed 911 with trembling fingers, barely hearing my own voice as I reported the emergency. While I waited, Dev watched me with an unreadable expression.

The operator’s voice came through, calm and measured, “911, what’s your emergency?” I tried to explain, stammering about a mysterious figure under my bed, but the words felt hollow and surreal. The operator promised to send help, and I clutched the phone like a lifeline.

Dev’s behavior was odd even in his calmness. He drifted to the bedroom and stood silently beside the bed. The room was dark, the only light coming from the muted glow of my phone. I mustered the courage to follow him. Slowly, I approached the bed, my heart in my throat.

Under the bed, shrouded in darkness, I saw a shadow—a shape that seemed to flicker at the edge of my vision. I leaned in, the hairs on my arms standing on end, and gasped. There, in the half-light, was a figure. It was indistinct, its features blurred as if hidden behind a veil of mist. The figure shifted, its movement unnervingly slow, and then it vanished, leaving behind an oppressive silence.

I turned to Dev, desperate for an explanation, but he was already stepping back, as if repulsed by what I had seen. “I’m sorry,” he murmured, his voice cracking. “I can’t… I didn’t want this.”

Confusion and terror tangled within me. “What do you mean, Dev? Who was that?”

His eyes filled with a strange mix of regret and dread. “It’s been with me for years,” he said, his voice barely audible. “I tried to keep it hidden, but my hunger… it’s more than physical. It’s a curse, Emma. I brought it here with me, even if I didn’t want to.”

I felt the world spinning. The phone call with 911 was still active, the operator’s words distant and unhelpful in the midst of my mounting panic. Dev’s condition, his inexplicable hunger, and the spectral figure under my bed all converged into a nightmare I could barely comprehend.

Then, as if in a final act of horror, the lights flickered, plunging the room into darkness for a split second. When the lights returned, Dev was gone. The door to the living room now stood slightly ajar, letting in a sliver of cold night air. My phone buzzed with the operator’s question, but I couldn’t bring myself to speak.

I searched the room frantically, my heart hammering with dread. The shadow under the bed had reappeared, larger now, more defined. I couldn’t see its face, but I sensed a malevolence that chilled me to the core. It was as if the figure was waiting, patiently, for something inevitable.

The police arrived soon after, their flashlights cutting swaths through the darkness. They found no sign of Dev—only my terrified expression, the unanswered phone call, and a bed that held nothing but lingering shadows. The officers offered little comfort, dismissing it as a hallucination born of stress and isolation.

But I know what I saw. And I know that Dev’s curse, that insatiable hunger, was real. The figure under my bed remains a mystery—a specter that might have been Dev’s tormentor, or perhaps a part of him that he could never escape. Now, every night as I lie in bed, I hear a faint rustling beneath, a reminder that some curses never truly vanish.

I’m still waiting for answers, and I’m still haunted by that final, chilling order: “Call 911.” Even as I try to rebuild my life, the shadow under my bed grows bolder, and I can’t help but wonder if I’ve become part of something far darker than I ever imagined.

*What is the true nature of Dev’s hunger, and what—or who—lurks beneath the bed in the darkness? I fear that the answer might be a fate worse than the unknown itself…*
