Hey y'all,  I'll keep my name anonymous, I'd like the most insane experience of my life with you, I have nowhere else to post it.


I was friends on discord with a guy named "IGotZamn13" he seemed pretty chill and friendly but also pretty annoying, overall, we were fine together, we shared stories, talked to each other and more.


But one day, all of that changed.

That day, som
ething happened to something I supported, I'm going to hide what that is because I'm afraid you'll harass me.about it, but it was bad for the thing I supported

Zamn texted me about the topic and I knew he was against me, so I tried to change his mind, after a few chunks of text, he responded with "you broke me in half" I continued, and he didn't even try to fight back.

I blocked him later, and honestly it was a huge relief, I ran to Chaz to tell him.about the case

Chaz was my best friend btw.

He told me that it was good that I tried to change Zamn's mins, but I might've gone too far and offended him. I didn't agree with Chaz, I went out to my other friends, same answer, some even blocked me for just doing that to him.

3 months passed, no news about the case.

On April 23rd 2023, I received a discord friend request, it was a guy named Starman45, he told me about the Zamn case, and told me he was his friend, he also told me that Zamn missed me, I didn't believe in that.



On May 4th, 2023, I received a discord friend request, and decided to check who it was, and my heart started to race, it was IGotZamn13, with a different account, I knew it was him by his profile pic alone

I took a screenshot of it and sent it to Chaz, and he responded with: you monster, get lost. 

Chaz blocked me after that, I didn't know why, but all those years of being together, suddenly gone, I wanted to cry, but I didnt.


To ease my pain, I decided to talk to Zamn.


I said: why are you doing this?

Zamn said: doing what?

I responded: Stalking me.

Zamn said: because I miss you, and I want to see if you have changed your mind, also I want to know why you threw the rant

Rant? What rant? I never threw a rant at him?

He shown me screenshots of said rant and it was me, just trying to change his mind. Idk what's going on.

I blocked him AGAIN to avoid anything further.

Just 12 hours later, he sent a friend request to me, I rejected, he kept sending friend requests, I rejected them all.


A week later, Chaz unblocked me, his first words after unblocking me were: this is how you made him feel (referring to Zamn)

I never understood why Chaz supported Zamn a lot, but soon after, he started becoming friendly to me again.


In June, EVERYTHING changed.

I got a stalker in real life, I live in the United Kingdom. I got so scared, that eventually told Chaz about it, Chaz followed me wherever I went. 

Eventually the stalker became so scary that I couldn't sleep for DAYS. I felt like he was sexually attracted to me and he could do something to me any second.

Eventually I pointed to him to Chaz and we just went home.


That day, Chaz and I were hanging out until someone knocked at my door, when I looked at the window to see who it was, My heart started to race, it was the stalker, I felt like this was it, I'm getting raped or something.


But Chaz opened the door, and talked to the stalker, and I couldn't believe my ears, it was IGotZamn13

Chaz told Zamn that he really didn't have to travel all the way to the UK to see me, Zamn convinced him that he needed to see me, he walked to my room, and I felt so scared, I closed my eyes and then.



Zamn said that he was sorry for stalking me, and then he asked if I was sorry for throwing the rant, I didn't believe in the rant, so no, he went outside, and started crying, Chaz went outside with him and tried to console him, I went outside to buy groceries.


On my way to the grocery shop, I suddenly saw Zamn running to me, I felt so afraid, but when he was nearing me, a car at 90mph hit him, and barely didn't hit me. If he wasn't there, I would've died, but zamn was gone, he had feelings for me, I lived in eternal guilt knowing that I've caused someone to go so insane that eventually that person tried to stalk me.
