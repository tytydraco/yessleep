I sighed boredly as I drove onto where my newest project was in a middle-of-nowhere area in Colorado once used for mining silver and the occasional gold. I was planning on renovating it and using it for historical tours. I wasn't much of a believer in the supernatural, but I knew I could use the town being haunted to bring in tourists. Ask any hotel the word haunted brings people in.  I finally arrived moments later and cringed at the state of the town. It was worse than expected with the old motel nearly collapsing and all the other buildings having vines and other stuff growing. I was slightly worried about bats or rodents or something. I shrugged that off though. It wasn't important. In the worst-case scenario, I have to set up traps for the rate or call someone for the bats. I grabbed my bags, the sun setting in the background, as I headed for the first building I saw. I recognized it as the local store I was told it was the safest of all the buildings to sleep in. The door wasn't in great condition, but I was in the middle of nowhere so I was sure I would be fine until I got someone up here.  I got a sleeping bag out and laid it on the floor as I prepared my bed, I heard a faint growl I swung my head to the side where the nose came from and saw a dark furry creature ducking down. The moon was full in the sky, but the thing wasn't illuminated. I silently prayed it wasn't a bear or something. I did not need to have that on my hand. I got in my sleeping bag and drifted off to sleep. 

I awoke with a start as a loud howling noise rose through the air. All the hairs on my arms stood on end. I saw the amber glow of eyes through the broken front door, and I froze. It was bigger than any forest animal, it was standing on four legs but somehow, I knew it didn't need to. It took slow predatorial steps toward me and that's when I got a close look. It was solid black with a scarred muzzle and bright amber eyes. It was a furry muscular thing, and it would be cute if it didn't look like it was about to kill me. Suddenly I came to my senses as I chucked my pillow at it I sprinted for the closest exit as I heard it growl in frustration. I flew into a room with an oddly secured door. The door screeched shut as I shoved the deadbolt in. I looked around the room taking in the scenery everything was old-fashioned and I realized this was a bedroom. I went through the drawers of the desk and found an old journal. I knew I was going to be here for a while so I thought I'd do something to pass the time knowing well that I couldn't sleep now. 

Monday January 15th, 1858

We found an area that looks promising for gold we set up some tents and are hoping to start tomorrow.

Tuesday January 16th, 1858

We got started on the mine and found some silver which isn't half as good as gold but will do for now. I mean it will sell for something. 

Wendesday January 17th, 1858

We found gold a ton of it. We are going to be rich. So far we haven't come across any animals or wildlife besides the occasional squirrel or rabbit. It's odd.

Thursday January 18th, 1858

We are starting to build a town here we've got a store, a little motel, and some other businesses coming around.

Friday January 18th, 1858

John got bitten by something last night on the full moon he decided to sleep outside last night and we heard a scream and rushed out. It's not looking too good. We don't know what it was. We are trying to keep the wound clean and stop the bleeding.

Sunday January 20th, 1858

John's wound is looking odd. I don't know what's wrong with it we did everything a doctor would do. It looks infected. He's been getting weaker too. I'm not sure he's going to make it. 

Tuesday, February 20th

John's been getting more aggressive. No one wants to be near him anymore. I'm afraid of what might be going on. 

Wednesday, February 21

John turned into a beast we had to fight him off and hurry to the house. We aren't too sure what's going to happen.

Thursday, February 22

John's dead. We shot him after he broke through the door, he's not the only one though. We are working on building a safe room. 

Sunday, July 15th

I'm the only one alive if you are reading this leave as soon as you can. Whatever John turned into is the least of this town's worries. It gets worse. Leave while this place will still let you.

I put the book down my hands shaking. I never knew the origins of the town just that it was abandoned suddenly. Something made me doubt it was truly abandoned though. I checked the time on my phone I think it's safe to go out now. I unlocked the door pulling it open as the door screeched in protest. Everything was shredded but the beast was nowhere to be seen. I knew what it was though. It's a Lycanthropy or werewolf. I decided to stay. Surely I was safe in the room who even knows if he survived or not? I called the builders who came out here and gave me an estimate for the repairs. I chose to keep the room as is. I would repair it when it was safer here. I currently needed it in whatever shape. As long as that door was there I would be safe. The workmen started working on repairing the motel as it was in the worst shape. They made great progress before calling it a night. After eating dinner, I headed into the new bedroom setting myself down in the old lumpy bed. I'd need a new one but it was better than nothing. 

I woke up to an inhuman male screech and a banging on the door. The man was begging for help and begging for me to let him in. When that didn't work he started to scream names at me calling me a bitch. Though it truly didn't bother me. I am now sort of believing in the supernatural. No one is here to be playing pranks. Then screams of agony and the sound of ripping flesh and crunching of bones were heard. I had to muffle a whimper at the horrifying sound. It took me a while to fall asleep again. 

The workmen came back again and finished up the motel. It's in near-perfect condition. I was able to save some artifacts from in there, including gold bars which of course will be locked up securely behind a glass case. I decided to stay out later than usual as the last monster thing didn't come out until later on in the day. That was until I heard multiple growls that one might hear from a dog. I slowly lifted my head seeing a three-headed dog. Despite what the myths may have said he looked like he was a Mastiff possibly a Cane Corso or Presa Canario. I slowly got up and backed away only daring to sprint when he charged his sharp teeth stained with blood. I ran for dear life slammed the door shut and deadbolted it right as I heard a thump. So, werewolves, ghosts, and Cerberus the 3 headed guardian of the underworld. What will be next? A fucking Hydra?
