Many girls Caroline's age would be thinking about boys, or their future wedding or what they want to study in college but not Caroline, oh no, Caroline had everything she needed on the family ranch, loving parents, annoying brothers and a loving dog, what's more to want but the Williams family held a secret, one that could put them at risk of anyone found out: the Dragon Flame.

Our story begins on a cool June morning, the family is just getting ready for their morning chores all except for one. "It's 7:45 where is that girl?" Susan said pouring her and her husband's morning coffee, Roger go check on your daughter" Roger Williams, the man of the house set down his morning newspaper and walked upstairs and knocked on the door "Caroline, sweetheart it's time to get up" meanwhile in the bedroom Caroline was fast asleep, her bed a mess, a girl with brown hair quietly climbed out of the bed and got dressed before walking to the window and was about to open it when Caroline grabbed her leg "please don't leave" Caroline said groggily, we can tell my parents I'm sure they'll understand, the girl knelt down and looked into Caroline's green eyes "Caroline as much as I would love to tell your parents about us you know what they would say" Caroline sighed "yeah your right, one day, me and you let's just run away together and elope and be happy?" The girl smiled and kissed Caroline passionately on the lips before pulling back "have I ever told you how beautiful you are?" Caroline smiled and laughed "only about every day" the girls kissed one more time before the girl stood up and quietly opened the window "see ya tonight sweetheart" Caroline sat up "see you later Amelia.‚Äù

As Amelia climbed out of the room and quietly but quickly made her way far from the house and to her car, Caroline heard another knock at the door, "Alright I'm coming hold your horses" Caroline said standing up and wrapping herself in a sheet and heading to the door, opening it a crack "what?" Roger had a look of anger and impatience "it's 7:45, we have morning chores and you know what day it is?" Caroline peered over to her calendar "June 13th?" Roger smiled "it's your birthday today, now get dressed and get downstairs" Roger said turning and heading back to the kitchen. Caroline shut the door and proceeded to get dressed, opting for a grey field shirt, jeans, her typical green field jacket and some boots before heading down to the kitchen.

"Ah there's sleeping beauty, I told you not to stay up too late" Roger said drinking his coffee and reading paper, "Haha very funny" Caroline said sitting down at the table and grabbing some breakfast "mom can you pass the orange juice?" Susan smiled and handed it over. "So Caroline what did you want to do 1ur your enthudy, we can go mo town and 8 shopping, go hiking, whatever you want?" Susan said as Caroline filled her glass. "I don't really know I was probably gonna ride Starlight up my favorite overlook and draw but other than that I never gave it any thought" Susan smiled "well it's your special day so you can do whatever you want just be home by 8:00pm ok?" Caroline smiled and thanked her mom.

After breakfast Caroline walked out to the barn and started saddling her horse Starlight, she then made sure she was along and texted Amelia where to meet her at the overlook, "Who you texting?" Caroline jumped and turned around hiding her phone "Geez Jacob don't sneak up on me like that, what do you want?" Jacob walked around the barn "nothing just curious who my baby sister is texting, I am your overprotective brother after all" Caroline smiled "thank you for that but it's really none of your business, it's just Amelia, we're gonna ride up to the overlook and I'm gonna draw" Jacob continues pacing around the barn "Caroline you know you don't have to hide it from me, I know she's your girlfriend"

Caroline was shocked "I have no idea what your talking about, Amelia is my best friend, she's the closest thing to a sister I have since mom and dad disowned Sarah" Jacob leaned against the stall "Caroline you seriously think I didn't hear you sneaking into the house when mom and dad where in bed, I saw her run from the house, I don't care if she's your girlfriend and I'm not gonna tell anyone" Caroline wiped tears from her eyes and hugged Jacob "thank you so much" Caroline said crying into her brothers shoulder. "Don't mention it, now go have fun and remember back by 8:00pm tonight" Caroline smiled as she grabbed her bag and got on her horse riding out.

After a 2 hour ride Caroline hitched her horse to a tree and went to sit on a bench where she started drawing, about 4 minutes later she felt a tap on her shoulder, when she turned around Amelia was standing their holding a bouquet of roses a box "Happy Birthday Caroline" Caroline wiped tears from her face and hugged Amelia "thank you so much sweetie I love them" Caroline said looking at the flowers, "well that's not the only thing" Amelia said getting down on one knee and opened the box revealing a ring "Caroline Williams will you" before Amelia could finish a massive wave of energy blew past them, when the girls looked into the sky an object was falling very fast not far from their location

"Amelia what is that?" Caroline said in terror.
