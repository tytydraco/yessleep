Alice and I loved to explore abandoned buildings, especially if there was a hint of anything paranormal. Two months ago, we went to a dilapidated house two towns over. It is isolated from the rest of town, surrounded by woods and is boarded up. It has a sketchy history with strange deaths, dating back to when it was built in the 1800s. The last owners fled after their son died at the house in the 60s. No-one's returned since and so it fell into disrepair.

We arrived there just after dusk. There are signs along the dirt road leading up to the house, “no trespassing” and “turn back”. It didn't deter us but I wish it did. We parked the car amongst the trees and made our way across the grounds. The only sound was of branches snapping under our footsteps. You couldn't hear the trees or any animals in the surrounding woods. The heavy silence had the hairs on the back of my neck standing up, it felt unnatural. 

&#x200B;

We done a quick lap around the outside of the house, looking for the easiest point of entry. There was a back door that had some wood nailed across it, it snapped and came off with not much effort. We entered in to the kitchen, my face involuntarily screwed up from the musty, stagnant smell which made Alice laugh. 

&#x200B;

We explored the house using our flashlights. It was still fully furnished and there were clothes hanging in the wardrobes. Every surface was covered in thick dust and there was mould on the walls and fabric. What we first found strange, was that it didn't seem as if anything had been touched since someone had lived there. Usually, when we explored abandoned buildings, there'd be evidence of others having been there before us. You'd expect to see graffiti or the place to have been trashed by kids or something. This house looked like it had been completely untouched since the owners left. 

&#x200B;

We were looking around the main bedroom when Alice asked me, “In all the places we've been, have you ever had such a strong feeling that we shouldn't be here?” 

I laughed, “to be fair, we *shouldn't* be in any of these places.” 

Alice shook her head with a slight smile, “maybe it's because it looks like we're the first ones to break in to this one.” 

She was clearly uneasy, I should have suggested leaving at that point. I would give anything to go back and say “let's go”.   

Instead I said, “this is the creepiest place we've been to, maybe we'll actually make contact this time.” 

I pointed at the dusty, full length mirror in the corner of the room and asked “shall we try scrying?”   
  

&#x200B;

For those of you who don't know, scrying is a method that can be used to make contact with spirits. There are a few different ways of doing it, but Alice and I favored using a mirror. Basically you clear your mind of all thoughts, sort of putting yourself into a trance like state, whilst looking into the mirror. If it works, it allows you to see things in the mirror. We had tried scrying in every building we explored, although it had never worked for us before. We had been obsessed with the paranormal since we were kids though, so we never gave up on trying it.     
  

&#x200B;

This was the first time Alice had been reluctant to do it. She said she felt like it was a bad idea, that she had a feeling we might be messing with something we shouldn't. I ignored her hesitation. I ignored her obvious fear. Hell, I ignored my own gut telling me to leave it well alone. I pushed and convinced her to do it. I'll never forgive myself for that.   
  

&#x200B;

I wiped the dust off of the mirror as best I could and sat in front of it. Alice moved to the edge of the room out of the mirrors view, her eyes locked on me. I stared into the mirror and began clearing my thoughts. For a few minutes there was nothing, but I could feel the air in the room had changed. So I was patient and sat perfectly still. Eventually I saw some slight movement on the left edge of the mirror, a dark shadow. I watched intently as whatever it was would slightly come into view, disappear and come back. Then a second shadow showed on the opposite side. Then another at the top. Then another in the top left corner.     
  

&#x200B;

I spoke slowly to Alice, describing what I could see. I don't know what her reaction was to any of this, she knew she had to stay quiet as to not distract me and break the connection. I continued looking into the mirror, watching as more and more shadows came into view. After a few minutes, there was at least ten of them. The shadows became more defined, I could start to make out their faces. They looked sad and they were reaching out to me. I could see their mouths moving, but I couldn't hear them.   
  

&#x200B;

I don't know what came over me, but I had this overwhelming feeling of sadness and pity. I leaned closer to the mirror. I think I heard Alice take a step at this point. Maybe she was going to stop me, I wish she did. I put my hand on the mirror and asked them, “what happened to you?” As soon as I asked, multiple voices started screaming, “help us!”, “he won't let us leave!”, “he'll take you too!”. The voices were unbearable, there was so many screaming at me at the same time. I covered my ears, closed my eyes and shouted “STOP!”     
  

&#x200B;

The silence returned and Alice asked me what was wrong. I asked her if she heard them. Her face was as white as a sheet as she said no. I looked back to the mirror and the people were gone, I assumed the connection was broken and I was relieved. The feeling of sadness was gone, but I still felt pity for them. I knew something terrible had happened to them, that something terrible was still happening to them. I could feel it so strongly.   
  

&#x200B;

I stood up and started to explain to Alice what I had seen and heard. I looked back to the mirror briefly and in the reflection of the open door, I could see a dark, tall figure standing at the other end of the hallway. I kept my eyes locked on it and beckoned Alice over to look. She stood behind me and said she could kind of make something out, but it was dark. We both turned and shone our flashlights out into the hallway, but there was nothing there. We turned back to the mirror and it was right behind me, it leant into my ear and whispered “run.”   
  

&#x200B;

We sprinted out of the room and we could hear it running behind us, laughing maniacally. We ran to the kitchen, towards the only door we had taken the boards outside off. The figure was now stood in front of our only exit, blocking the way. I grabbed Alice's arm and dragged her back out of the kitchen. We ran into a bathroom and I locked the door behind us immediately. I stood back and listened intently, the silence of the house had once again returned. Alice was hyperventilating and I tried to calm her down. I told her it was just trying to scare us but, I didn't believe that.   
  

&#x200B;

We didn't know what to do, we couldn't hear any movement outside of the door but that could have been a trick to lure us out. We felt like we were trapped. We knew we couldn't stay in there forever, but we did not want to leave that room if that thing was still out there. We sat quietly, trying to think of a way to escape the house.     
  

&#x200B;

I thought about the spirits I first saw in the mirror, the sadness and pity that overwhelmed me when I connected with them. Then I thought about when I first saw the dark figure in the hallway, I was consumed with fear and knew we were in danger. I couldn't shake the feeling that the “he” the spirits referred to, was that figure. They were obviously connected somehow, so what if the spirits could help us? So I suggested trying scrying again.   
  

&#x200B;

Alice was adamantly against it. She felt the scrying was what set it all off, told me that we shouldn't have done it in the first place. I asked her what our other options were? There was something out there and we couldn't stay in the bathroom forever. She wouldn't budge. Then we heard laughing from the other side of the door. We stood as far away from the door as we could, watching it closely. We were both holding our breath, hoping it would just go away.   
  

&#x200B;

Every few minutes its activity would escalate. It started with the laughing. Then it began scratching at the door. Once it started throwing things at the door, Alice turned to me and said “fine, do it.” I frantically wiped the mirror down and tried my best to clear my thoughts. It was impossible with all the noise that thing was making and the fear saturating my brain. Alice could see me struggling and reached her hand out to mine. I gripped it tightly, took a deep breath and stared into the mirror intently. The spirits began to show along the edges of the mirror. The feeling of sadness returned. The fear also remained.   
  

&#x200B;

I asked them for help, they all started screaming over each other again. I pleaded for just one to talk at a time as I couldn't hear them. A teenage boy seemed to edge closer, he raised his hand to the others signalling them to be quiet. I asked him if he knew what was trying to attack us, he solemnly nodded his head and explained it was the same spirit that had trapped them all here. I asked him what he meant. He told me that this house has a dark spirit attached to it, he causes harm to people within it. I asked him why. An older lady spoke this time, she told me that the spirit wants people to die in this house, so he can trap their spirits here with him for eternity, where he can continue to torment them. The spirit outside of the door laughed wildly, the sound was almost deafening. Alice screamed at me to hurry up.   
  

&#x200B;

I asked the spirits in the mirror how to stop him. The lady told me the only way is to escape the house and never come back. She told me he likes to play with his victims first, but the longer you're here the more dangerous he will become. The lock on the bathroom door started to slide open slowly. I looked back to the mirror and the spirits were gone. Alice ran to the lock and was trying to keep it closed. I told her that we need to run out of this house right now. She screamed at me asking if I was crazy wanting to go out there. I told her we had no option but to get out of this house as fast as we could, I told her to trust me. She nodded and a tear slid down her face. I put my hand over hers and counted down from 3, we slid the lock open and burst through the bathroom door.   
  

&#x200B;

We ran as fast as we could towards the back door, furniture was being thrown around us as we ran. Alice was faster than me. I shouted at her that if anything was blocking that door, we had to run through it. We got to the kitchen and the figure was stood in front of the door again. Alice ran straight for it and braced to tackle it. I noticed it had something in its hand. I screamed “NO!” But it was too late. Alice barrelled into it and the figure disappeared. Alice fell to a heap on the floor. I ran to her and turned her over, the snapped wood we broke off the door sticking out of her stomach. I told her it'll be fine, that I'll get her out of there. She shook her head and pulled me closer, she lifted her head and whispered into my ear “run”. Then she was gone.   
  

&#x200B;

For the first time since I got there, I listened to her. I ran to the car and left. Once I got to the town, I called the police. They didn't believe me. They believe she had an accident when we broke in, that we were just stupid idiots messing around and it went wrong. There was a funeral but I couldn't bring myself to go. Her body might have been there but I know where she really is, stuck in that house. How do I ever forgive myself? I don't think I ever will. I need to find a way to free those spirits. To free Alice. I have to go back.
