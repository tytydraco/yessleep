It's been a long time since I've been on this subreddit, and dispite having had so many bad experiences in my life, I never wanted to put anything on this page.

I really don't know where to go for closure in this situation, and of all the things I've experienced and wittnessed in this life, supernatural and preternatural... I can't shake this from my mind or body. People need to know. It's been a repressed memory in the back of my mind for some time, an underlying feeling that gives me PTSD and I was in denial for a very long time.

It was nothing supernatual to start with, but somehow it was only ever men who were turning themselves into deamons. Nothing more than monsters.

...

To begin, the year was either 2017 or 2018. I was still in high school at the time I think, and couldn't have been any older than 18. 

I had been invited to an off the beaten trail place to eat by a friend, call him Kyle, at least someone whom I did consider a friend at the time. He said he wanted to take me and another friend of mine, call her Kate, to this place someone else had taken him to to eat a burger. 

Kyle told me it was a pit stop burger joint where truckers coming off the highway go, or something along those lines. A place you'd have to know about to have known about.

Although I did like trucker stuff, and imagined how cool it would be to see big rigs and a real truck stop near my home town I had never known about, I was a vegitarian at the time and really wasn't interested in going out for burgers. 

Kyle insisted, almost pleading with me promising that my friend Kate will be going too, and the place is only open on very specific days. He mentioned the owner or the owners had talked with him and insisted he come back. Kyle said he couldn't go back there alone, but needed to go back there.

Then he mentioned there was something that said "Vegetarian" on the menue. So I agreed to go.

...

It was a Friday. The hour was late by the time Kyle pulled up to pick me up from my house with Kate in the passenger seat. 

Now they're both about 2 or 3 years older than me. We all went to the same high school in the same shit hole gang riddled city about a 30 minute drive down the highway 68 from Monterey. I wasn't really from the salt mines like they may have been though. I've lived in California most of my life, but when I was ages one through three I was raised up in Colorado Springs, and then my family moved to Yolo County for some time. I may have been young by the time we moved to that murder city, and did most of my schooling growing up there. Even though we may have lived in the nicest part of the city, it wasn't unheard of and not at all uncommon for someone to be murdered down the street or a few blocks over from my very own home, some kinda suburbs. 

Although I hadn't personally witnessed a murder before me, signs were everywhere. The wrost I can think of was when I was walking to college in 2019 or early 2020 down a street that my own continued onto. I had to stop because there was a memorial site with a cross and hundreds of flowers and photos and letters. It hadn't been there the day before and a man from the same apartment building was there to tell me that a woman who lived in the same complex he did was leaving for work at 4 a.m. that same morning, and someone ran up on her, stabbing her to death in the infant. She was 6 months pregnant and only trying to get to work at her office job. Call me suicidal if you will, but I did continue to take the same route to class even after that, up untill the college was shut down for the pandemic, maybe it was so I could continue to pay my respects to a woman I didn't even know who lived on Clay Street in Salinas California.

Anyone who lives in this city I was once from... I think people only end up there because they have to. I don't think anyone lives there by choise.

Anyway, on this Friday night in 2017 or 2018, Kyle took me and Kate to the burger place he had been fated to go to. I don't think I'll ever know how he knew about the place, but he knew about it some how. 

Once we were on the outskirts of the city, the sky looked very dark. In the limits of the city, it's common not to see any stars in the sky due to a marine layer paired with light pollution. Yet, even though the night was so dark, I can't recall being able to see even one star in the sky. 

He took us past Spreckles, the very small town where John Steinbeck's novela 'Of Mice and Men' takes place. Then he took us on a turn towards Marina, but not to Marina, made a sharp turn under an overpass, and up a few dimly lit streets that went up into the hills. I know I'm giving some location details about the towns, but I cannot say where it even was. Don't go looking for this place.

Once we arived, and Kyle parked his Prius, it was obvious it was not a rest stop for truckers like the image Kyle had put in my head. The only light on the hill was florecent LED coming from inside a dingy looking small one story building. There was no sign out front or on the door or above this so called burger joint. No sign of a local destination at all.

Kyle mentioned that we needed to go inside because "they know we're here." We were the only people there other than whoever it was already inside who aparently knew we were there.

Kyle got the door, and we followed him inside. The floor was white linolium, very clean, no stains or traces of anykind of foot traffic whatsoever. Walking through the door, right away I noticed the place smelled like it was only ever cleaned meticulously with very harsh chemicals.

Kyle wanted to do all the talking, and Kate didn't say anything at all when we walked in. I know she was smelling what I was smelling. 

Kyle showed us where the menue was. It was a crude board behind a counter top devider that separated the linolium froor from some other area. It was all one room somehow though. It was dimly lit behind the counter, despite how bright the light in the area we stood in was. There was a man behind the counter infront of the board, I don't remember what he looked like. Kyle said not to look into the kitchen when he noticed I was peering in that direction. The kitchen was partially visible from behind the menue board, it looked like everything was stailess steel. The man behind the counter showed his teeth at me when I looked away, but he wasn't smiling.

Everything on the menue was the same price. I recall thinking at first, trying to push away the terrible suspicious feeling I had about this whole place, "Why is everything the same price, veggie burgers are supposed to be at least 30% less in cost, this better be a damn good vegie burger." It was only burgers on the menue, there were no drinks and there were no sides.

The tree of us sat down at a table. There might have only been about three or four tables in total. As we were sitting down, Kyle insisted Kate sit by the window, he on the outside seat next to her, and I sat across from both of them. Kyle didn't want to say anything, but he was scared of the owner, that man behind the counter, and didn't like the way he was looking at any one of us. 

The man from behind the counter brought us three burgers imediately, still warm and then walked away while still watching us.

The burgers all looked the same. There was no lettuce or tomato. The bun was maybe whole wheat of some kind with no sesame seeds or distinguishing marks. The patty looked like a fine ground beef. 

I looked at Kyle and said "I think they got my order wrong. This looks like a meat." 

Kyle in a quiet low voice he doesn't noramally talk in replied, "He knows what he served us. Your's is vegitarian." Me being as trusting as I am and thinking it would be impolite to not eat this that my friend had bought me started to eat the burger.

Kate after seeing me take a bite after that then tried her burger, and then Kyle started eating his. Neither of them looked happy about it, and I kept eating what was given to me, very slowly getting more and more upset by the taste. They each one after the other said, "It's beef." Like they were trying to convince themselves. It wasn't until Kate mentioned how sweet the burger was that I started crying. I only had taken about two small bites and I put the burger down, we were all eating the same thing. It could have been the soft texture that brought me to tears at first, but even the taste was too much.

Though my tears I started choking out something in sobs, "What the fuck kind of a sick prank is this? Feeding some real meat patty to the vegitarian. This tastes like the butcher ground lamb, beef and pork together and added sugar. Is this even, is this, is..." I startes hyperventilating about now and couldn't really speak, but somehow I was only able to get out the words, "It's human, this is human, this is human flesh, it's human." Endlessly on repeat. 

I began having a full blown panic attack and at this point I was screaming. Kyle continued muttering in that low quiet tone, "It's beef," but I wasn't having it and yelled at them to stop eating even though neither Kyle or Kate were eating at all at this point. 

I was violently shaking, and said, "We need to go, now!" Even if I didn't even say it out loud. I might have only been making nausious gagging noises while dry heaving as I stood up from the table. I had only had two or three bites but any amount was always going to be too much, but I couldn't throw up at all for any reason no matter how much I wanted to, I was inable. Standing from the table, I ran immediately to the door we came through. It was locked. There was a back door I saw, and I have no idea how I noticed it, but I ran to that door. It was locked too. I start slamming against the windows, and they were not glass, it was some clear matterial chosen so they could not be shattered.

All this time, I was screaming at the top of my lungs still the same, "It's human." Kate was silent, and Kyle still saying, "It's beef." 

I run at the man who served us someone, now behind the counter and demand he unlock the doors. He only ever said, "We're closed." 

I wasn't having it and start screaming anything that came out saying each thing that came up on repeat. "Do you know what your serving?" The man was silent. "Who was that?" The man was silent.

At this point, I knew. This man was eyeing us like the sweet meat we aparently are. He wouldn't unlock the doors. But his face dropped when I started crying out repetatively, "Where are we? Where am I? Can't you hear me?" The man looked as if he heard the voices of the dead speaking through me in reverberating wails. 

The man said again, but quieter now, "we're closed."

Kyle said, "It's beef." To himself once more.

Kate didn't say a word.

I was still screaming. When I yelled at that man behind the counter, "You'll never know who has HIV. You'll never know who I am, and you'll never know who you're eating." 

The man's eyes widend, he walked off somewhere, got a key, and let the three of us go after that. Locking the door imediately behind us as we walked out. The lights in the one room and kitchen building when out before we even made it back to the car. 

We got in the car without a word, and I must have been exhausted by it all, I passed out near immediately when the car started moving. I didn't wake up until Kyle pulled up to Kate's house. I don't know if it was the movement of the car coming to a stop, or Kate who woke me up, but she said she would feel a lot better if she drove me home from there. I got out of the car rather groggy and I'm not sure if I even remembered what had happened once I woke up. I know momory loss is a common body response to deal with trauma at times. I think Kate drove me the last stretch back to my house after that. I don't know if she trusted Kyle anymore after that... Though, I don't really remember who dropped me off at home anymore. I passed out again as soon as I got to the bed in my room, didn't even get undressed.

I think if my dad asked me the next day how the burgers were, all I could do was gag and say, "Bad meat." Nothing more. 

...

Though I'd like to put this all behind me and move on with my life and this has all been a repessed memory for years now. I can never move on, mentally and physically I've been tainted. It will always be in the back of my mind now that I've remembered. The worst part about it for me, is that even though it was only a very small amount that I consumed, I did swallow, and it did get digested. 

Although who ever it was that was murdered for conumption did not have anything like HIV or Syphilis, I believe I did developed another incurable disease because of what I ate that day. A prion disease similar to Chronic Wasting Disease in deer and Scrapies in sheep... but it's not wither of those, it's something different. These kinds of diseases tend to develope from consumption of DNA too close in structure to that of the consumer. In people, prion diseases develope most commonly after consuming urine, feces, and yes, human remains...

I've been taken to phsychiatric doctors through out my life. It was only ever depression and anxiety I was supposed to be depression and anxiety I was getting treated for, but after the whole Meat Insident, I've been given a variety of mental illness diagnoses including Bipolar Disorder type One and two, Schizoeffective Disorder and even Schizophrenia. No drugs I've ever been prescribed have ever helped. 

And as far as physical changes go, I know I'm not a vampire, and I don't crave human flesh or bloody life essence from anyone. I know about prion diseases, it causes permanent changes to DNA by diseased prions folding the DNA in on itself. Other than an increasing difficulty I have with maintaining mental clairity, along with occasional invuluntary movements and painful feelings like something is burning me that a doctor of sorts called "tactile hallucinations"... and even if I'm the only person on Earth who will ever know or even notice, at times when I look in the mirror at my reflection, all I see are my canine teeth that seem bigger than they were before. 

A rather grim reminder, of the unchanging reality that anyone anywhere could be the very monsters we chose to call fictional. 

You never know, could be right on the outskirts of your very own home town...

Take care of yourself out there.
