The night was still and silent, and I was sound asleep in my bed when a sudden, shrill ringing jolted me awake. Groggily, I fumbled for my phone on the bedside table and answered the call from an unknown number.

"Hello?" I said, my voice hoarse and scratchy from sleep.

"Is this Joseph?" a voice on the other end asked. It sounded unfamiliar and sent a shiver down my spine.

"Yes," I replied, rubbing my eyes to clear the grogginess.

The voice proceeded to ask me a strange question about the layout of my house. I found it odd, but I answered anyway, not thinking much of it.

For weeks after that strange phone call, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. Every creak and rustle in my home seemed louder, more sinister. Every shadow seemed darker, more ominous.

Then, one night, I heard a sound that made my blood run cold. It was a scratching at my bedroom door, and I froze in terror. I lay there, paralyzed with fear, as the scratching grew louder and more insistent. Someone or something was trying to get into my room.

I tried to shake off the fear, to tell myself it was just my imagination or some animal outside. But the scratching continued, as if whoever or whatever was on the other side was determined to break through. I could hear my own heartbeat pounding in my ears as the scratching went on and on.

When it finally stopped, I lay there in silence, my ears straining for any sound. But there was none. I was left alone in the darkness, with only my fear and paranoia for company.

The next morning, I checked my bedroom door and found deep scratches in the wood. It looked like someone or something had been trying to claw their way through.

I knew I had to take action. I installed cameras around my house, hoping to catch a glimpse of whoever or whatever was stalking me. But every time I reviewed the footage, there was nothing there. No sign of anyone or anything.

As the days went on, my fear grew to an unbearable level. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. Every time I left my house, I felt like I was being followed. I started to see strange figures in the corners of my vision, but when I turned to look, there was no one there.

Then, the photos started arriving. They were pictures of me, taken from a distance. I couldn't see who had taken them, but I knew someone was watching me.

My fear turned to desperation, and I hired a private investigator. But even the investigator couldn't find anything concrete. It was like whoever was after me was always one step ahead.

One night, I woke up to find a figure standing at the foot of my bed. It was the same figure I had seen in my peripheral vision for weeks, but now it was right in front of me.

The figure was tall and shadowy, with glowing eyes that seemed to pierce my soul. I tried to scream, but no sound came out. The figure simply stared at me for a long moment then raised itâ€™s long claw like  hands,

I knew that I was going to die. I had felt it coming for weeks, and now it was here. I closed my eyes and waited for the end.

But when I opened them again, I was alive. The figure was gone, and I was alone in my room. I couldn't explain what had happened, but I knew that I had been given a second chance.

The next day, I received a package in the mail. Inside was a note that read, "You got lucky this time. But I'm still watching." I knew that I had to leave my home behind and start a new life, I packed my bags and left the next morning.
