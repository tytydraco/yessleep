After the third week, I started keeping a notebook. I didn’t tell anyone. I wrote down the groan times, the smells, the strange little rituals people around me seemed to be performing without realizing. One entry just said:

Janitor humming. Smells like soup. Eyes rolled back.

Another:

7:13 a.m. Steam vent burped. Left shoe soaked. People smiled.



I remember one morning in particular. It was snowing, kind of. Slush-flecked flakes, beige instead of white. I saw a man in a pinstripe suit kneeling in the middle of Lexington Avenue, arms out, head tilted back to catch them on his tongue like they were blessings. A cab honked. He didn’t move. Just kept smiling up into the storm. When I told my mom, she said, “City people are strange,” and wouldn’t look up from her tea.



But the oddest part wasn’t what people did. It was how they moved. Their rhythm. Their timing. As if something beneath the surface was pulsing, slow and steady, like a second heartbeat shared by everyone but me. On the subway, I’d feel it — a distant bass, too low for ears, too deep for words. People would adjust their breathing to match. I held mine.



One night I dreamt of it. I was floating down an alley filled with syrupy light and sticky footprints. Something massive loomed overhead, unseen, its weight making the buildings sweat. When I woke up, my mouth tasted like copper and something... meatier.



That’s when I started avoiding the steam vents.



The groan came again the next night, but this time it felt closer. The walls didn’t just rattle—they pulsed. I sat up in bed and held my breath, waiting for someone to react. Nothing. Just the faint hiss of radiators and the soft creak of old wood. My mom’s bedroom door was cracked open, light off, but I could hear her whispering. I thought maybe she was on the phone. When I got up and tiptoed to the door, I realized there was no voice responding to hers. Just a low chant in rhythm with her breath. Three syllables, over and over. I couldn’t make them out.

School was no better. My English teacher, Ms. Gruber, wore gloves that day. Long ones, up to her elbows. I only noticed because they were the same shade as raw chicken skin. She never took them off, not even to write on the board. Her hands moved stiffly, like her fingers weren’t quite hers anymore. When she handed me back my essay, I saw something wet had seeped through the glove at the fingertips. The paper smelled like brine and burnt rubber. She smiled at me too long. Didn’t blink.

During lunch, I sat outside the cafeteria with my tray. They were serving "slop stew" again—brown and green and steaming like compost. Everyone else ate it like it was cake. I just pushed it around with a spork. A boy across from me, Jonah, was staring at me with red-rimmed eyes. "You don't like it?" he asked, not angry. Curious. Like he didn’t know it was possible. I told him I wasn’t hungry. He nodded slowly. “It helps keep her calm,” he said. I asked who he meant. He tilted his head and whispered, “The mother.”

That night, I finally opened the heating vent in our bathroom. I don’t know why. Curiosity, I guess. I unscrewed the grill and knelt down with a flashlight. The vent didn’t end where it should’ve. Instead, the duct sloped downward at an angle, too deep and too wide. It looked wet inside—throbbing, even—and something was moving far down, beyond the reach of the light. Not crawling. Shifting. Like a muscle flexing. I dropped the flashlight.

When I told Mom, she just stared at me. “It’s not polite to look inside,” she said. That’s all. Then she went back to stirring a pot of stew that smelled like the vent.

That was when I knew it wasn’t in my head. There was something alive beneath the city. Something big. Something fed.

I stopped taking the subway after that. I told my mom I liked walking better, which wasn’t entirely a lie. It gave me time to think, to notice things. Like how no one stepped on the manhole covers anymore. People made small detours around them—some even crossed the street just to avoid them. Once, I saw an old woman drop her purse on one, and instead of bending down to get it, she waited. A kid ran over, picked it up, handed it to her. She didn’t thank him. She just turned and shuffled away, whispering under her breath.

The city had been weird before. This was something else. There was a pattern to it, like a hidden language being spoken right in front of me. I started writing down symbols I saw scratched into the sides of buildings, underneath the grime of alleyway doors, carved into subway platforms behind peeling ads. Circles with lines through them. Spirals surrounded by feet. A huge open mouth, always open, always dripping. I saw that one the most.

Once, I followed a woman wearing hospital scrubs down into a closed maintenance stairwell. She didn’t seem to notice me. She moved like she had a purpose, like she was late for something holy. The stairs led down five levels—far more than I knew existed in our building—and the walls got warmer with each floor. There was light down there. Not from bulbs. A dull, pulsing amber glow, like the inside of a body.

I didn’t go all the way down. Something smelled sharp, like vinegar and wet pennies, and I heard a distant sloshing noise. Like something turning over in a giant pool of thick soup. I turned and ran. When I got back to the ground floor, the door was closed behind me. Locked. The woman was gone.

I told my school counselor about the symbols the next day. She nodded a little too eagerly. “You’re noticing things,” she said. “That’s good. That’s very good.” Then she handed me a pamphlet. I expected it to be about stress, or maybe therapy. But it was the same kind of wax-sealed fold I’d seen in the library. This time, the wax was brown, and smelled faintly like feet.

“You should come to a meeting,” she said.

I didn’t go.

That night, my mom didn’t come home from her shift at the depot.

When I woke up the next morning, the entire apartment smelled like old broth and sweaty clothes. A bowl of stew was on the table, still steaming. The wax-sealed pamphlet was next to it, only this time, it was open.

Inside, instead of words, there was a picture: a smiling woman with her ear pressed against the floor. Below her, drawn in thick lines, was a bloated stomach—round, lumpy, veined like a map. Her smile was peaceful.

The caption just said: **“Do you hear her gurgle?”**

I didn’t go to school that day. I couldn’t. I just kept thinking about the pamphlet and the stew and the silence in our apartment. Mom’s coat was still on the hook. Her boots by the door. The bowl hadn’t been reheated. It was like she had never come home, and yet… somehow had.

I dumped the stew in the trash. It didn’t splash. It landed with a heavy plop, like it had skin. I tied the bag and took it outside, down to the chute in the alley. But when I opened the metal door, something was already inside. Breathing.

Not loud. Just faint. Wet. I slammed the door and ran.

No one else seemed to notice. On the street, a man with no shoes was sweeping puddles off the sidewalk with his bare hands, murmuring “clear the pores” with each stroke. A group of teens passed me laughing, but their laughter didn’t sound right. It was too even, too timed. Like a loop.

I walked for hours, hoping I'd spot Mom walking back from work, or maybe at the corner grocer where she used to flirt with the rations clerk. But everywhere I went, I saw more signs—actual signs now. Posters, pasted over old advertisements. Pale brown paper with swollen letters in red ink: **"Her Belly Must Be Filled."** **"The Gas Must Rise."** **"You Are Already Inside Her."**

I ended up in Central Park. It was mostly empty. The grass had a sheen to it, like it was oiled. A few figures stood still around the pond, backs turned, their arms hanging at strange angles. One of them slowly dipped his hands into the water and pulled out a small, gelatinous egg.

I didn’t breathe until I’d left the park.

Back at the apartment, Mom still wasn’t there. But the stew bowl was gone. So was the pamphlet.

I sat on the couch for a long time, lights off. I could feel something beneath the floor—movement. Not shaking. Shifting. Like something getting comfortable. I pressed my ear to the wood.

And I heard it.

Not the groan this time. Not the usual belly churn I’d come to dread.

This was whispering.

Hundreds of voices. All speaking in rhythm, like a chant from deep underwater. I couldn’t make out the words. But I could feel them.

That’s when I realized something I hadn’t wanted to admit until then:

The city wasn’t sitting on top of this thing.

We were inside it.

I didn’t sleep that night. I kept imagining the floor softening beneath me, the walls exhaling. At one point, I swear the ceiling bubbled, like there was something just above it pressing down — a bulge of meat and warmth and sound. I covered my ears. But I still felt the rhythm.

When the sun finally came up, I left the apartment. I didn’t know where I was going. I just walked. The streets were quieter than usual. No cars, no buses. Only people, barefoot, dressed in loose brown robes that hung off them like damp towels. Many of them had smeared something on their faces — a dark paste that cracked when they smiled.

They all smiled.

I avoided eye contact and ducked into the nearest subway entrance. I don’t know why I thought that would be safer. Maybe because it was familiar. But the turnstiles were twisted, bent backwards like something too large had forced its way through them. The walls were wet. The tiles had softened, swollen around the seams like old flesh.

I walked the platform alone.

Down the tracks, where it should’ve been dark, there was a light. Flickering. Orange and red, like firelight. I followed it. The heat grew stronger with every step. So did the smell — not just rot anymore, but sweet, like syrup or spoiled fruit. I felt dizzy.

Then I heard singing.

Dozens of voices, humming in unison. I turned a corner and saw them: people kneeling in rows on the track bed, facing a great hole bored into the tunnel wall. A massive circular wound in the earth, ringed with fleshy tendrils. The people were feeding it. Not with food. With breath.

Each exhale was long and deliberate. A ritual. Some held their arms out. One was pressing his forehead to the ground.

I backed away, slowly. But I must’ve stepped on something, because a squish echoed down the corridor. Several heads turned. One of them stood — a tall woman in a red cloak, her face hidden behind a mask shaped like a swollen foot.

“You don’t belong yet,” she said. Her voice was gentle. “But you will.”

I ran. I didn’t look back.

Outside, the sky had turned a greasy gray. People were lying down in the streets, bellies to the ground, as if trying to listen to something deeper than the city. I ran the entire way back home. My building smelled like stew.

Mom was in the kitchen. Stirring. Humming.

She turned and smiled at me. Her eyes were glassy. Too wide.

“You missed your calling,” she said. “But it’s okay. She forgives.”

That night, I found a new pamphlet on my pillow. This one wasn’t sealed. It had only one sentence, handwritten in oily ink:

**“The belly waits for you, little Lila.”**

I didn’t go back to school after that. I don’t know if it was still open. I don’t know if anyone was going. The news stopped playing anything besides looped footage of smiling families eating together in brown-lit kitchens, stew bowls steaming between them. The newscasters always wore brown robes now, their hair slick with something shiny. They blinked too slowly. Their teeth looked… soft.

I tried calling my old school friends. No answer. No voicemail. Just static — wet-sounding, like a tongue scraping the inside of a mouth. When I tried to text them, the messages bounced back with the words: **“Delivered to Belly. Thank you.”**

That’s when I realized something worse than being alone.

I wasn’t.

I started hearing movement inside the walls. Not rats, not plumbing — breathing. Soft, labored. In and out. In and out. When I pressed my ear against the plaster, it pulsed warm, almost comforting. Almost. Like something very large was asleep behind it and dreaming of me.

My mom stopped using words I recognized. She spoke in gentle rhythms — tones and syllables that reminded me of the subway chanting, but slower, more intimate. I didn’t know what she was saying, but I understood what she meant. She was happy now. She had been accepted. Welcomed into something vast and wet and warm.

I wasn’t allowed in the kitchen anymore. She told me the ingredients had to remain secret “until my gut was brave enough to listen.” I don’t know what that meant. But I could smell what she cooked. The scent wrapped around me when I tried to sleep, climbed into my lungs like invisible vines, and whispered strange cravings into my chest.

I started eating strange things.

At first it was just glue. Then paper. Then the stuffing from couch cushions. One night I gnawed the corner off a soap bar and didn’t spit it out. The taste reminded me of that alley vent — copper and curdled milk.

I was changing, too. I could feel it. My dreams no longer belonged to me. Every night I stood on the edge of an impossibly deep pit, a hole in the center of a city that pulsed like a stomach. A massive thing coiled beneath New York, its skin a tapestry of sewer lines and abandoned malls. It breathed through manholes and subway grates. Its gurgles shook windows. Its hunger never slept.

In the dreams, I always jumped. Fell forever. Landed in the belly. It was full of liquid that smelled like sweat and soup. People floated beside me, smiling with mouths too wide. One reached out and touched my face and whispered:

“You were born for this.”

And I believed them.

When I woke up, I was already crying. Not from fear. From loss.

I wanted to go back.

It’s hard to explain what it feels like when the world you knew melts away — not all at once, but in sticky drips, like the inside of a rotting fruit. At first, I thought I was resisting. I kept to my room, kept a knife under my pillow. I told myself I’d run away. I told myself I’d find someone — a teacher, a guard, anyone — who wasn’t… part of it.

But it’s hard to resist something that makes everything else feel like a lie. Something that fills your lungs with a sweetness you didn’t know you were starving for. I started dreaming with my eyes open. I’d stare at the ceiling and see folds of flesh above me, gently expanding and contracting. The shadows on the wall moved like tendons. The heat in the apartment took on a rhythm. Like breath. Like digestion.

One morning I caught my reflection in the mirror. My eyes had changed. Not color — just depth. They looked… softer. More swollen, like they’d been soaking in warm water. I smiled and didn’t know why. My teeth felt loose in my gums, like they were deciding whether to stay.

I kept hearing the belly.

That’s what I called it now — *the belly*. I didn’t even question if it was real. I knew. The city’s noises made more sense that way. The traffic wasn’t traffic — it was churning. The footsteps on the street were her peristalsis. The rising fog was her breath, the rations her milk, the sirens her hiccups.

I didn’t ask where Mom went during the day. She stopped saying goodbye when she left. She only whispered, “She’s almost ready.”

One night, I followed her.

She didn’t take the subway or a bus — she walked through alleyways I’d never noticed, down a stairwell hidden behind a dry-cleaning shop with a broken sign. She never looked back. I kept my distance until she reached an open lot filled with others. They stood in a wide circle around a hole in the asphalt. Not a hole, exactly — an opening. A pore.

And from it rose a wet, warm wind.

They sang. Not with mouths — with breath. Each exhale harmonized with the others. The wind grew stronger, carrying with it a stench like boiled meat and fermented socks. My mom raised her arms. Her robe fluttered. The skin on her hands gleamed slick under the moonlight.

Then I saw it.

From the hole emerged a toe. A massive, glistening human toe, bloated and gray-pink, the nail thick and yellow. It twitched. The people gasped in unison — some wept. The toe flexed, smeared across the lot, and tapped once against the concrete. Like knocking on a door.

A door for me.

I don’t remember walking home. I only remember the sound the toe made when it moved — a deep, wet pop that echoed in my ribs.

That night, I slept with my window open. The groan lulled me to sleep.

And in the morning, I wasn’t scared anymore.

The day it rose, the sky turned beige.

Not gray. Not black. Beige — the sickly, sticky shade of half-chewed meat. It oozed across the skyline just after noon, thick and cloudless, like someone had smeared lard across the sun. My building trembled. My bones did too. But no one screamed. No one ran.

They knelt.

They faced downtown, hands clasped to their chests like children waiting for a story. My mom didn’t say a word. She just opened the window and breathed deep, her nostrils flaring like she’d just caught the scent of warm bread.

That’s when we heard it — the belly. But louder. It wasn’t just a groan anymore. It was a full-body churn, like an entire world had just taken a breath in. The streets cracked. A distant roar thundered from beneath Grand Central and echoed upward like thunder in reverse.

And then, it rose.

Not a building. Not a monument.

A body.

Her foot surfaced first — enormous, stinking, deeply *human*. The toes were curled, each nail the size of a yacht, yellow and warped and caked with filth from centuries of unseen trudging. As it lifted, it pulled with it a mile of sewer lines and subway cars, which hung like spaghetti from between its toes. Each step sent shockwaves through the city. Sirens screamed — not from emergency systems, but from inside her.

The mech was real.

She was real.

A titanic, flesh-colored colossus, the size of Manhattan itself. Her belly, round and distended, jiggled with each footfall. It gurgled audibly, even from across the river. Not a machine — a womb, a storage, a cauldron of digestion and mystery. Pipes coiled from her back, pulsing with methane and steam. Each breath she took expelled a cloud of greasy fog that sent birds crashing from the sky.

And her arms — not arms, but weapons. Giant cannon-barrels crusted with barnacles and soot, wrapped in old wires and dangling intestinal tubes. They looked like repurposed silos, leaking radiation and revving with ancient hums.

Above her shoulder, stretched taut between spires of bone and metal, flew a massive brown banner. Its words, written in crimson sludge, read: **"THE GASSY MOTHER HAS AWAKENED."**

People cheered.

Some wept.

Some threw off their clothes and lay prostrate in the street, faces pressed to the ground, whispering prayers into the pavement.

I didn’t cheer. I couldn’t move. I watched her step over the Chrysler Building like it was a pebble. Her other foot flattened a block of cafes and tourists and taxis — and left behind a footprint that steamed and bubbled, the concrete turning to soup.

Her belly gurgled again, louder this time. Something inside it shifted. I could see its outline bulging under the skin. It wasn’t empty.

She was full.

And hungry.

And looking for more.

By the next morning, the city had no skyline.

It was her now — Mother Slop — whose belly eclipsed the sun. Her shadow fell across five boroughs. Bridges sank under her stench. Ferries drifted, abandoned, toward her steaming footprints, where the water had turned yellow and thick like broth.

No one tried to stop her.

No planes. No news reports. No resistance. Only worship.

The streets had become rivers of people dragging sacks of offerings — old shoes, spoiled meat, VHS tapes labeled "GUT MATERIAL," and pale eggs the size of basketballs. They rolled them down sewer drains, lifted them toward her twitching toes, or simply opened their mouths and whispered *"accept me"* while her great belly belched from above.

Mom was gone. Just gone. No goodbye. No stew. Just a trail of brown cloth leading out the door.

I tried calling someone. Anyone. Phones were dead. The internet was still up, but everything was different. Every site, every page — all of it replaced with looping footage of the belly. A livestream, from inside it.

I don’t know how the camera got there. But it showed a cavernous chamber, slick and pulsing. People floated in the digestive fog, eyes rolled back, smiling like newborns. At the center sat something huge — round, trembling, cradled in a sack of viscera.

An egg.

And it was hatching.

I didn’t eat for days. Couldn’t. The only thing that made my stomach turn less was the fog outside. It had started seeping through cracks in the windows. It didn’t choke. It lulled. My dreams got louder. In them, I wasn’t afraid anymore. I was being welcomed. Held. Warmed.

I woke up one night already standing in the hallway, door open, shoes on.

I didn’t remember getting up.

The city was quiet, humming. Everyone was walking the same direction — toward the pit. The Slop Pit. The one we were never supposed to talk about, where the first belly groan was heard. And I followed. Not because I wanted to.

Because I needed to know.

I needed to understand what I was *for*.

The Slop Pit wasn’t where I remembered it.

Or maybe the city had shifted. The streets felt different underfoot — warmer, pulsing faintly, like I was walking across skin stretched over bone. Buildings leaned inward, as if they too were peering toward what waited in the pit. Even the stoplights blinked in strange patterns now. Red-red-green-brown. A rhythm. A heartbeat.

I walked for what felt like hours.

No one spoke. We were pilgrims, silent in our hunger. Some held candles, others clutched spatulas or pacifiers. All of us carried something. I didn’t know what I was carrying until I looked down and realized I was holding one of the eggs.

It was warm. Slick. Breathing.

And it smelled exactly like the steam that rose from the Slop Zone — like boiled cabbage and long-worn socks, like the belly's breath. I tried to let it go, but my arms wouldn’t listen. It was mine now.

When we arrived, the pit was wider than I remembered. As if it had fed. It groaned — not like a machine, but like something dreaming of food. People filed in a circle around it. They placed their eggs in shallow craters at the edge, dozens at a time. The moment each one touched the ground, it began to wiggle.

I held mine tighter.

A woman in front of me opened her mouth and released a low, wet moan. The kind of sound I’d only heard from pipes in old buildings. Her body shook. Then another beside her. Then dozens. It spread like a cough — until we were all groaning together, swaying, the eggs humming in our arms.

And then She descended.

Mother Slop’s foot came first, lowering from the clouds like God had kicked off her sandal. It pressed gently into the pit — not to crush it, but to feel it. To *connect*. Her belly hovered above, so wide it blocked the sky, its surface rippling with gas and life.

Then it opened.

Not her mouth — her **navel**. A great vertical slit in the center of her belly peeled back, revealing a chamber within, glowing yellow. From it dropped thousands of **eggs**. Not laid, not birthed — **regurgitated**. They landed with wet thuds, rolling among us. Some split. Some screamed.

Each one was… someone.

Faces stretched across the shells. Human faces. Familiar.

One of them was my mother.

I dropped my egg. It pulsed and hissed, twitching toward the others. I screamed — not in fear, but in understanding.

This was the cycle. This was the truth.

We weren’t feeding Her. We were Her food. But more than that — we were **incubators**. Every chant, every breath, every drop of stew, every gassy belch — it was a process. A recipe.

To create more eggs.

To **grow** the Slop Line.

And the city was the womb.

I don’t know how I got out.

I remember the heat. I remember the gas — thick like soup, heavy with old air and egg-mist, coating my tongue in a sour-sweet film that tasted like the end of everything. I remember the president.

Yes. *Him.*

Hovering in circles above the pit in a rusting F-35 VTOL, sirens screaming, his tie flapping against his mouth as he shouted through a megaphone:

**“I PARDON THEM! I PARDON THEM!”**

Each word shook the air like thunder. He stood on the plane's back, arms wide, the mech’s cannons reflecting in his sunglasses. No one looked up. No one *cared*. The Slop had already taken the city. The pardons were too late. Or maybe too early. Maybe they were part of the ritual. Maybe his words were keys, unlocking something deep in the belly.

Something old.

Something that wanted to be *hatched*.

I stumbled through the crowd, egg goo on my legs, the pit behind me still yawning wider, deeper. One of the mech’s toes flexed, and the stink of it knocked out the sky for a moment. A foot like a continent. Yellow nails curled into the skyline. A gassy belch thundered from the belly and rattled car alarms in states I couldn’t name.

And I walked.

And I kept walking.

And now I’m here — typing this. If the net still works where you are, if this reaches you before the final groan, then please:

**Do not go to New York.**

Do not look for the Slop Pit. Do not answer the chants in your basement. Do not eat the stew. If an egg shows up on your porch, **do not let it in**.

Because they are spreading.

The eggs.

The hunger.

The soft, human feet that walk where no monument ever stood.

I still dream of her belly sometimes.

And I think… I might miss it.
