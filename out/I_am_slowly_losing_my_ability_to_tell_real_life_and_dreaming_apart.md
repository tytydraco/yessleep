To keep it simple, for the last roughly month and a half my dreams have been becoming far more realistic. This is getting to the point where recently have been literally unable to tell when I have dreamt something and when I’ve actually done it. I’m going to do my best to explain what’s been going on but I’m really just looking for some advice. The obvious thing would be to go to a doctor but only recently has it been getting bad enough to consider going. 

It started with my dreams morphing from me fighting characters from video games or driving in Formula 1 to the most mundane things imaginable. I have dreamt I was doing homework I had already done, changing components on my PC, or just driving to work. At first I was even able to control the dreams. Meaning instead of continuing to drive to work for example, I would “spawn in” an F1 car for me to drive. Eventually though they just become way too realistic. It’s as simple as that, there’s not much to say beyond this. 

So to address the massive elephant in the room, the reason I am posting this in r/nosleep is because I’ve already tried to post it in advice subreddits. I’ve tried r/tooafraidtoask and r/nostupidquestions but in both I was called a troll and a “just trying to write a story”. This is likely because if you look on my profile you’ll see I’ve written stories about trying to convince the reader it’s real. So yeah this style is sort of biting me in the butt but I figured even if people here treat it as a story at least you will give me advice on my situation.

For example, where I work there is a valve that you need to turn in between the men and women’s restroom. All it does is shut off the water for the night. It is the most mundane, easy thing in the world. It can be easy to forget but the way I forgot was through my dreams. I’ve started sleeping during my break and I woke up thinking I had already done it because I had dreamt it. So, the next day when my manager asked me if I forgot, I confidently said no. But, I really think it was me now based on how vivid the memory is while simultaneously knowing it wasn’t done. 

Writing it out now, this feels like something that I could tell at parties as a funny story. However, it has continued to happen in the middle of the day. I fell asleep watching Peaky Blinders on Netflix and at some point I began watching a documentary on a Formula 1 driver. Now, I really love Formula 1 so I have a lot of knowledge on the history of it. I began watching a doc on a driver called Jim Clark. I was really in to it and I was enjoying the documentary. Then at some point I sort of just realized I’m staring at a black screen. I then realized the tv is off. I get on Netflix to continue to watch the doc but it just doesn’t exist. I must have looked on Netflix, using every name imaginable to try and find that doc. It just doesn’t exist. I think I dreamt it and was sleeping.

I know this isn’t scary or fictional. I know this doesn’t seem like a problem with these two examples; but it’s getting so realistic and so often that I’m being late to school, late to work, I’ll dream I’ve already ate and not eat breakfast, I’ll dream I told my mom something when I haven’t, it just goes on and on. I am sort of getting emotional writing this because it really feels like I can’t tell what is real anymore.

Honestly it’s not a problem if I just doze off while watching tv. But when I am standing in my bathroom wondering if I already brushed my teeth or if it was a dream, it gets scary. I don’t want to question my reality when I’m driving to work and wondering if I’m about to wake up. 

Please please please at least treat this like a story and respond how you would if it were real. If this isn’t well written I’m sorry.
