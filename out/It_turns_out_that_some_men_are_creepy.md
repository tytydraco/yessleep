“Because of the *implication*.”

I smiled and ran my fingers through Bert's hair. “So… what, exactly, are you implying?”

He looked away from me, up at the star-speckled sky, and smiled wider. “The implication that things might go wrong for you if you tell anyone my little secret.” 

I rolled my eyes and pulled my hand away. “So you finally ask me out after I’ve been dropping hints at work for *weeks*, and you think it’s the perfect time to let me know that you’ve about to get a higher body count than John Wayne Gacy.”

He pursed his lips and raised his eyebrows. “Nineteen last year, thirteen this year. I’ve only got – well – just one more to match his thirty-three.” He stroked my nose with his fingertip.

I folded my arms as unease crept up my neck. “And you’re confident that I’ll won’t tell anyone you’re a – um – a *serial killer* because of the implication that…”

“Look around, Jill. I took you ten miles out of town so that we could drive *way* up to the highest hilltop and look at the stars.”

The fear was starting to spread. “Which I thought was pretty romantic. I got all dressed up.”

“That doesn’t have to change, sweet thang.” He licked his upper lip with a long, thin tongue.

“And if I told someone what you revealed?”

His hand was on my neck before I realized that he was moving. “*I* have experience killing a person. I know what it takes.” He flashed his ice-blue eyes at me and squeezed like he was juicing a lemon. “Do *you* know what it takes to kill someone, Jill?”

I tried to speak, but his grip was too tight. I stared at him and shook my head. 

“Well let me *tell* you what it takes to kill someone, Jill.” My vision blurred as he squeezed tighter still. He slurped up a rogue strand of drool. “What it *takes* is knowing that someone presents a *threat*, Jill. Someone who can’t keep her mouth shut and says that she’ll let everyone know a *deep personal secret* that she was *entrusted* with! That gives a man the strength to *kill* someone, Jill!”

My head spun; the white-hot pain in my throat was the only thing keeping me alert and conscious, but I knew the darkness was about to win. I couldn’t believe that the sensitive guy with the cute dimple had so much hate.

My mind worbled. 

I’d gotten all dressed up for him.

That was going to be my last though.

*No.* 

I reached down and fumbled with numb fingertips until I found it.

*crack*

The tip of my stiletto hit his temple and Bert immediately slackened his grip. I dropped the shoe and snatched my phone from my purse, tumbling out the door just as his fingertips grazed the hem of my dress.

I ran. 

He had the car, so I sprinted away from the road and into the woody forest. My brain was still oxygen starved and I had no idea where I was. The worst was the paranoia: every creak, every snapping twig, every sound that I *imagined* to be real convinced me that Bert was just behind, waiting to add me to his list. I periodically checked my phone, but had absolutely no service. I ran like that for so long that there seemed to be no differentiating dreams, reality, and the dark trees that had become my horrifying nightmare. I had never been so afraid.

And then I found the road again. I ran onto it and almost burst onto the other side before slamming myself to a halt. I looked to the right and saw nothing. Then I turned left.

Headlights. *Headlights!* I jumped and waved until a big rig pulled to the side of the road. I was crying by the time I jumped into the passenger seat.

“This is a long way to be out by yourself, little lady,” the driver offered in a kind voice.

“Yes,” I sobbed, focusing on getting my story out. “Bert… my date… he tried to kill me. Can you please help me?”

He stared at me to shocked horror. “My God… of course. I’ll radio that in for you.” He shook his head. “Wild night. Denny over here flagged me down as well, says his car got stuck in the woods after he tried to follow where his girlfriend had disappeared.”

Every hair on every part of my body stood on end as I slowly turned around. 

No.

It couldn’t be.

Ice-blue eyes stared back at me, hovering over a malicious grin. “If I include you *and* Dirk the trucker, I’ll be ahead by one with thirty-four.” He licked his upper lip and grabbed my neck. 

He seemed to have forgotten that I always carry two shoes.

Hopefully the second blow to his temple slowed him even more than the first, but I don’t know. I dropped the other shoe and was running through the woods again as soon as I hit the ground. 

I have no idea what happened to Dirk. 

I can’t make outgoing calls or texts, but for some reason, I have enough service to post online. If I disappear, that means Bert found me a third time. I’ll update if [I’m alive](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/).
