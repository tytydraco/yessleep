Whilst fighting two devotees of Satan and a particularly militant atheist in the cratered parking lot of a derelict White Castle, a most bizarre and singular thing happened.  

There I was, with my two best friends and comrades in Christ, dealing scriptural blows to the blasphemous followers of The Evil One, whilst parrying the pseudo-philosophical punches of the pimple-faced faithless, when a black-rimmed rift opened up in the middle of our melee.  

The tenebrous portal hovered a few feet off the ground, smoldering blackly, and emitting a low, metallic rumble; not dissimilar to an idling bulldozer—perhaps like one that will, someday, demolish that onions-scented shell of the abandoned restaurant. 

All present were rendered speechless, and for a moment I thought that the adherents to the Adversary had conjured this weird and assuredly unwholesome anomaly. But, before I could levy an accusation, the rift suddenly disintegrated into a shadowy cloud of particles, leaving in its wake a Thing out of some warlock’s fantastical sketchbook.  

I can only describe it as a mass of bubbling grey flesh, intermittently spherical—for it ceaselessly pulsed and shifted—of a rather disconcerting size; it would’ve just barely fit into the bed of a nearby abandoned truck. A faint blue static coursed across its unstable surface, crackling loudly. A smell as of burnt plastic emanated from either the tumultuous shape or its electric emissions. There was no face, no indication that this was a sapient or even dimly sentient thing; and yet something about it, some instinctually sensed aspect assured me that this was not a mindless object, but an incredibly intelligent *being.*  

The atheist was the first to speak. “Oh my Science!”  

Despite the circumstances, both theological parties groaned, and shot the lone atheist looks of disgust. Then, remembering that we were ideological rivals, we began the finger pointing, accusing each other of having brought this strange thing into the fray; calling such a sorcerous act “cheating”, given its utter lack of precedence in our previously mundane conflicts.  

But it soon became apparent that neither of us had any idea of how the strange elemental entity had come to be, and so we turned our attention to it—not bothering to credit the atheist with such a momentous occurrence.  

We waited, expecting the grey, lightning-streaked entity to speak, to formally introduce itself. As its surface intermittently deflated, inflated, and tremored, the gravity in the immediate area seemed to gradually increase; until it felt as if someone had subtly slipped an extra twenty pounds’ worth of clothing onto my body. Noticing my friends feeling similarly encumbered, and that the non-believers and heretics were suffering the same unusual sensation as well, I quickly deduced that the spherical phenomenon was the source of the gravitational aberration. 

“It’s that thing—it's weighing us down, somehow. This is surely the work of some devil—if not yours.”  

But the Satan-worshipping duo were clueless; this was plainly of a greater caliber of sorcery than they were capable. And despite his praise of the discipline, I knew that the atheist lacked any considerable degree of scientific learning. If the thing were of some dark science, it was surely far beyond his intellectual and scientific ability.  

Finally—but, unfortunately—the entity made verbal contact. With a voice that was as sonorous as it was terrifying, it spoke the word, “Everything”. None of us had any idea what that meant. Then, as if reading our minds, the thing spoke again, saying: “That is what I am. The answer to the question you’ve been pondering since my arrival. I am Everything.”  

The gravity of its voice, the weight and presence of its intonation, suggested that this thing literally meant what it had said: that, somehow, it was *everything.* But still, being a devout believer in God and his omnipresence, I questioned it: “What do you mean, you’re *everything.* Wouldn’t you be a lot bigger, if you were?”  

Without pause, the spheroid horror rose a few feet higher in the air, and emitted a massive pulse of electricity. All of us were floored by the shock of it at once, though there wasn’t any considerable amount of pain in the effect. I felt a little dazed, and there was a lingering static about my person, but I was otherwise unharmed.  

Still, I found it oddly difficult to move my limbs, so I stayed on the ground and motioned for my friends to do the same. The glorifiers of evil, following our lead, made no attempts to rise; but the atheist, ever-overconfident and prideful, quickly rose from the ground and stood beneath the crackling, bubbling prodigy. 

‘Oh, how beautiful! I cannot wait to see what the great scientists say about you! The studies, the documentaries! I bet there’ll even be a Netflix film about you!”  

A sigh arose from somewhere amidst those of us who had not risen from the ground, but I cannot say who uttered it. The entity, still hovering in the air with the gleaming sun behind it, ignored the gawking atheist, and addressed us all, generally:  

“The ‘afterlife’ holds neither Heaven nor Hell, neither God nor Satan. There is no endless nothing into which you will fade—oblivion is as much a myth as Paradise, or Hades. No, quite the opposite awaits you following the end of your mortal term. When you perish, you will enter into *everything.* You will become part of all that is—subsumed into a state of total, inescapable omni-presence. You cannot imagine it, I’m sure, but it is the truth. You will feel every pleasure, every agony, forever—long after Time itself has ceased to be.”  

Despite the obstruction of the sun from our vision by the entity’s darkly celestial body, it seemed to then grow darker, the grey flesh blackening, the electricity ceasing to emit light but sparking on nonetheless. I suddenly felt a chill despair flit through me, as if I had briefly forsaken my beliefs and succumbed to an ephemeral state of hopelessness. A few feet away, I saw the characteristically pale faces of the devil worshippers redden, and noticed a soft twinkling in their eyes; as if, for a moment, they’d felt the joy and love of community with Christ. On the atheist’s face I saw an already fading expression of wicked lust, of a desire for devilry and perversion.  

“You now know something of the *other side,* and can perhaps understand one another’s positions more clearly. If so, then use this newfound capacity for existential empathy to prepare yourselves for the reality of post-life existence: There is no hope, but neither is there the despair of non-existence: You *will* continue to exist—endlessly, irrevocably.”  

Perhaps perturbed by the idea that he would not simply fade away into thoughtless nihility upon giving up the ghost, the atheist responded, “Wait. I’ll become one with the universe? *And* I’ll somehow be aware of it? I’ll have to...endure *even* *more* suffering?”  

The spheroid entity, acknowledging the atheist for the first time, spoke: “Yes. No matter how violently your body and brain are destroyed, your mind will live on and inhabit every single sub-atomic particle; will course through every flow of energy; will occupy spaces both mundane and ultramundane.”  

As if the alleged knowledge was too much for him, the atheist fell to his knees and began babbling incoherently. The sons of the Father of Lies snickered at the youth’s mental collapse; and after speaking among themselves for a moment, rose to their feet. It was obvious they meant to challenge the entity, and even though our rivalry had not ended and undoubtedly would not, I felt compelled to join my human kin in contesting the plainly anti-human entity. Beckoning my friends to follow my lead, we rose and went to stand beside the blackly dressed duo, who accepted our alliance with nods of their heads.  

Having initiated the challenge, they spoke first: “The Dark Lord would eat you for a snack, should we care to invoke him. We laugh at your lies, you buzzing ball of space spaghetti.”  

Nonplussed, the blackened orb responded: “Is your ‘Lord’ not merely another prisoner within *his* realm? Does he not toil in the Hadean fires along with those he has, through treachery, condemned to that most unwholesome place? Why would you worship such an unsuccessful being?”  

The confidence of the devil worshippers wavered, but only for moment. Regaining his composure, the foremost speaker retorted, “Propaganda. He reigns supreme among Pandemonium, and when his army has been fully mustered, he’ll usurp that unfair ‘god’. Satan will be a Messiahbolical autarch—Unholy, Undivine, and Unbeatable.”  

As if bored by the iniquitous (and wholly false) prophecies, the entity turned to me and said, “And you?”  

Needing neither promises of perdition nor overwrought omens, I said, simply: “He will not allow any spiritual harm to those who have faith in him.” My friends both offered supplemental amens to my statement.  

“How optimistic. Remember that as you feel, with every aspect of physical and extrasensory perception, the detonation of stars and the unraveling of galaxies in the afterlife. I, merely being an Emissary of Everything, will not bring you physical harm; I will, however, allow you a taste of what is to come. Savor it, suppress it—I do not care. Just know that it is what awaits you in the end—or should I say the beginning?”  

The entity then imploded into itself, becoming a fraction of its original size—no larger than the blackball of pool. A single thread of electricity arced laterally across its surface like the ring of some stygian Saturn, and the thrumming sound lessened to become almost inaudible. 

 Without warning, the ball then shot down, striking the insensate atheist in the head. He went rigid, ceasing his babbling. Not stopping there, the ball then flew toward the two fledgling Satanists, striking them in their heads. Finally, it streaked toward my friends and I, colliding with our skulls in turn, despite our attempts to dodge it. 

The pain was immense, but the worst part was not the physical sensation of its impact, but the potent and deeply unsettling sense of.... *spiritual bloating* that followed.  

I felt both dispirited from my physical form and attached to everything inside, outside, and around it. For what couldn’t have been longer than three or four seconds I felt a nigh indescribable sense of sensorial totality, of wholesale and widespread community with everything—living, dead, abiotic and immaterial; incorporeal and super-dense. It was the most dreadful, the most soul-shaking experience I’d ever felt.  

It was obvious that all of us had been similarly afflicted. My companions and former opponents all shivered as the feeling passed from us, and our shared glances bespoke of the same terrible experience. The mind-broken atheist lay on the bare ground, drooling and staring thoughtlessly. Of all of us, he’d been the only one to harbor a belief —if not a hope--of utter nihility upon death. To have one’s bleak existential nihilism so boldly contradicted....I did not envy that poor man.  

The ball, having achieved what it’d set out to do, quietly flew sunward, disappearing from our vision in the brilliance of the star.  

The theological conflict did not continue. It was decided that, given the circumstances and stresses of that horrific experience, it’d be best to continue our disputes another time; and perhaps in a venue less prone to incidents of the supernatural.
