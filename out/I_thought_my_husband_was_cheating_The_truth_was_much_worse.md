I used to think silence was empty. Turns out it’s just the sound of secrets too heavy for words. Every creak in our old floors, every sigh of wind against the windows, I’d swear it was Ethan whispering another woman’s name. The late-night texts, those murmured calls from the porch, I stacked them up like evidence in a trial only I knew was coming. I wasn’t guessing; I was certain. That certainty clanked against my ribs every time I walked into the room, and he would flip his phone face down like the glow of another message could end the world. I was ready to confront him, ready to torch the whole damn marriage, because I just knew he was already halfway out the door with someone else.

Spoiler: I was wrong. The truth, whatever this was, crawled out of the basement instead.

Seven years in, Maple Street felt like forever. We’d bought the place for the wrap-around porch, fixed the squeaky step together, planted lavender like we were setting down roots you could smell. Year five, though, the music skipped. After the miscarriages, the rooms ballooned out, too much space where a crib should’ve gone. Too much quiet where laughter should have been.

I felt like a failure. I was unable to do the one thing I was meant for. The doctor told us there was nothing wrong with either of us. “These things happen,” he said, but I just knew Ethan blamed me. After the third miscarriage he started growing distant. Despite my failures I wasn’t suspicious, I thought our marriage was strong enough to see this through, and his little project in the basement would help him cope with the loss.

I was told men grieve differently. I’d never seen him cry. Not even when Oscar was born at nineteen weeks. He was absolutely beautiful. Ten fingers, ten toes. A boy too perfect for this world. They call it “born asleep,” and that’s just how he looked. We got to hold him for a few hours before they needed to take him. I cried and cried and cried. Ethan didn’t. He held me in a way that looked comforting, but I could tell he was disappointed in me.

When he told me he needed some “me” time to “sort his head,” I didn’t protest. I left him alone down there, to build his man cave. I must admit I was surprised, though, when instead of hauling wood and nails down those creaking stairs, he carried bags of salt. Oils. Candles. A heavy old book I didn’t recognise.

Listen, I’m not judging. If he wanted a secret man-spa, fine. But looking back, I realise he wasn’t trying to escape his grief. He was bargaining with it.

He would spend every Friday night locked in that room. Whatever he was doing seemed to be working for him, so I left it alone. After about two months he started looking at me again, really looking, like I wasn’t just a reminder of everything we’d lost.

By the third month, when I told him the heavy scent of patchouli oil was making me throw up, he just smiled and quietly packed everything away.

I found out I was pregnant with Jessie that same week. Strange thing was, when I told Ethan, it was like he already knew.

I’d been nervous about breaking the news. He was so happy lately, and I knew this pregnancy would be filled with dread just like the last and the one before that. Pregnancy should be a time of joy and excitement, but for people in our position that excitement is replaced with worry, anxiety, and whispered prayers to gods you don’t even believe in, begging not to have it end the same way.

Some people pray for a boy or a girl. I prayed to just have a baby at the end of it all.

Ethan, though, he wasn’t worried in the slightest.

“It’s going to be okay this time,” he said one evening as I soaked his T-shirt with tears.

“You can’t possibly know that.”

“I do. I can feel it, Cara. We have someone watching over us this time.”

I thought he meant Oscar, our perfect angel watching our rainbow baby grow safely.

I didn’t’ know it then but that’s not what he meant at all.

He was right, nonetheless. The pregnancy was a breeze. The twelve-week scan showed a tiny, wiggly bean stretching and twitching on the screen just as it should. Of course, I agreed to every extra measurement and blood test they offered. Her Down syndrome screening came back as one in a hundred thousand, which was a shock considering both my cousin and his cousin have Down syndrome. Not that it would have mattered in the slightest, I just wanted my baby, extra chromosome or not.

Jessie was born bang on forty weeks. The labour was manageable, eased by soothing words from Ethan and my Spotify playlist. Very different from the out-of-control, morphine-induced haze of Oscar’s birth. She weighed seven pounds eleven ounces, with a shock of thick chestnut hair. strange, considering I’m blonde and Ethan’s brown. He joked about the milkman being the real father, and we laughed as we looked into our daughter’s ocean-blue eyes.

We left the hospital a day later. Jessie fit into our home perfectly. Her clothes and blankets filled the once-empty spaces. Her cries and gurgles smothered the silence in the most exhaustingly joyous way. I was the happiest woman on the planet.

Was.

It could only have been four or five weeks after we brought her home when I made the comment. We were curled on the sofa, watching Jessie drift in and out of sleep in her bouncer. Ethan had just come in from an unusually long shift at work. I don’t know what I was thinking, call it hormones, call it madness. But I said it.

“I want another one.”

Now I know. After all the struggles and heartache before Jessie, I should have been grateful. But in that moment, I just… did.

“No!” Ethan’s voice cracked like a whip. Jessie startled in her bouncer, tiny arms shooting out in a flinch.

I froze, breath caught. He never raised his voice.

Ethan sat forward instantly, rubbing his hands over his face as if he could scrub the word back into his throat. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean—”

I crouched beside Jessie, rocking the bouncer gently until her whimper settled into a soft hiccup. My chest thudded with the echo of his reaction.

When I looked back, he was trying to arrange his features into calm, but dread still leaked through. “It’s just… it’s not the right time,” he said. “Work’s getting harder, I’m exhausted, we can’t manage another right now.”

I tried to laugh it off, keep it light. “Oh God, I didn’t mean this second. Just, you know… someday. In the future.”

His eyes locked on mine, sharp as broken glass. “No. One’s enough.”

The way he said it, flat, final, left no room for jokes. Jessie cooed between us, and I swallowed the argument pressing against my teeth.

We had always planned on having a large family. Before the miscarriages, before the trouble, we’d talk for hours about two girls and two boys, what they might look like. Ethan would go on about teaching the boys his skills on the football pitch, how they’d grow up strong enough to protect their sisters.

Yes, we’d had our struggles with the other babies, and I knew it had taken a toll on him too, but I thought we were finally moving forward. Christ, we’d bought this house because of how much space it had. It was meant to be full of children; not ghosts of the ones we never got to keep.

After that night he grew distant again. His occasional calls to say he was working late turned into at least three nights a week. After a while he didn’t even bother to call. I’d be pacing the kitchen at nine o’clock, Jessie tight against my chest, his dinner stone cold on the table, and he’d saunter through the door like nothing was wrong.

My “what the fuck’s” were always met with the same line: “Sorry, I forgot to let you know.”

Even then I still didn’t suspect cheating. How could any decent man play around when he knew he had a loving wife and a four-month-old baby at home?

Now I wish he had been cheating.

When Jessie turned six months old, nothing had improved. Ethan spent hours away from the house. Away from me. He’d take Jessie to his mum’s and “accidentally” stay so late it was “easier for Jessie” if they stayed. Or he’d take her on “adventures” that lasted from dawn until dusk. At night he blamed his sore back, preferring the sofa to our bed.

I was losing him, and I needed to fix it. I needed to fix this issue I hadn’t caused. Or at least I didn’t think I had.

One rainy Friday, whilst Ethan was still at work, I packed Jessie’s Peppa Pig backpack with all her essentials and favourite soft toys and took her to my mum’s. After Jessie was born healthy, I promised myself I’d never use a babysitter. That no time alone was worth missing a moment of her life. But standing at my mum’s door, ready to hand her over, I was convinced the best thing for my baby was to fix my marriage.

By the time he got home I had everything ready. I wore his favourite dress. I had His favourite meal was waiting on the table: turkey dinosaurs, smiley potato faces, and spaghetti hoops. What can I say, he’s a simple guy.

I had twelve cans of Fosters and mango and two bottles of premixed passion fruit martini on standby for the conversation to come.

“Where’s Jessie?” were the first words out of his mouth as he came through the door.

I swallowed the disappointment at him not noticing my effort. It sank like a stone in my chest.

“She’s at my mum’s,” I said gently. I was trying to be as non-confrontational as possible. This needed to go well, or it could be the end of us.

“Come and sit. I’ve made your favourite. I think we need to talk.”

“Why is she at your mum’s?”

“Stop using her as a shield!” The words snapped out before I could catch them.

He froze in the doorway, keys still dangling from his hand.

“A shield? What the hell does that mean?”

“It means every time I try to talk to you; you hide behind Jessie. You dodge. You vanish. And I’m left here wondering what I did wrong.”

He flung his keys in the bowl, dropped his phone and wallet on to the table and walked past me like I hadn’t said a word. He scraped the chair out opposite me and sat down, picking up a turkey dinosaur and biting into it without even looking at me.

His phone vibrated loudly, cutting through the silence. It was closer than it had ever been before. I should have snatched it up; I should have gone through all the messages there and then. It would have changed everything. But I didn’t. All I was able to see was the name of the sender—*Alex*—and the word *impatient.*

He snatched the phone up and slid it back into his pocket.

I tried to rationalise it, tried to play devil’s advocate in my head. *Impatient* could have meant anything. Maybe Alex was a woman. Maybe she was waiting for him. That’s what my gut told me.

But it wasn’t that. Not even close.

Later, I’d learn what “impatient” really meant.

My chest burned “Do you even care anymore, Ethan? About me? About us?”

He chewed slowly, then finally looked up. His eyes were bloodshot, ringed with something that wasn’t just tiredness.

“How could you say that” he said flatly. “I’m doing this for you.”

“Yeah, great. Thanks. The way to a woman’s heart is distance and insecurity. Well done.” I set a can down in front of him a little too hard.

“Sorry,” I mumbled.

He looked up again. “Remember when you tried to carry five shopping bags in from the car and you dropped my beer but didn’t tell me?”

There was a ghost of something forming on his face. A smile. A smirk. I couldn’t tell if this was his way of trying to diffuse the situation.

“You opened a can straight away,” I said, sliding into the chair opposite him.

“It sprayed up my nose.”

I couldn’t help it, I laughed. The first real laugh we’d shared in months. He grinned, beer can still in his hand, and for a moment I saw the Ethan I’d fallen in love with.

“God, that was a nightmare, it hit the ceiling too.” I said, covering my face with my hands.

“You should’ve just told me,” He chuckled. “Instead, I thought I’d been cursed.”

“Maybe you have,” I teased, reaching for a passion fruit martini. I cracked it open and took a long sip. Savouring the smooth tang as it burned down my throat.

His face fell slightly when I said that, just a split second of a micro expression I couldn’t read. Then he smiled again.

My own smile dropped when the ceiling above us gave a slow, deliberate creak.

Jessie was at Mum’s. The sound didn’t make sense.

I knew the floorboards in this house; I actively avoided the two creaky ones directly in front of Jessie’s room when she was napping. The only thing that could make that sound was a footstep.

Ethan’s jaw stiffened. He tilted his head, listening, then shrugged. “Old house,” he muttered, but his eyes lingered a beat too long on the ceiling.

“I’ll check,” he added, pushing himself to his feet.

There was a chill in the air, not the kind that made you cold, the kind that made you anxious. My eyes stayed fixed on the kitchen door as his footsteps faded upstairs.

Then it came—a faint, cloying waft of patchouli, out of place and wrong, curling through the air like smoke. I wrinkled my nose and stretched my neck to try and spot Ethan coming back.

Nothing.

A draft brushed the back of my neck before the basement door gave a heavy thud as it swung shut. Not a slam, but hard enough to jar. I jumped, then froze. I was sure I’d closed it earlier.

“Ethan?” My voice was too thin.

I could hear my own heart beating in my ears. This house had always felt safe to me but, right then I felt like a child left alone in a strange place.

I was about to go and look for him when I heard him padding down the stairs.

He plopped himself back down, pale but trying to look casual. “Nothing there,” he said, but his hand shook as he picked up his can.

The smell still lingered.

We sat in heavy silence for a few minutes, but as the prickle of alcohol hit our veins. We quickly reverted back to the teenage like giggles.

One can turned into two. Then three. Jessie was safe at Mum’s and the house felt lighter, like the walls weren’t listening for once. We traded stories, half-teasing, half-serious. The kind of conversation that leaves you smiling but aching at the same time.

We didn’t talk about anything heavy, right then I felt like I had him back. And all it took was some breaded turkey in the shape an extinct creature, embarrassing nostalgia, and alcohol.

By the time the cans were gone, we were sitting close. His knee brushed mine, and neither of us moved away. For one night at least, the distance between us blurred and I felt whole again.

The next morning, I woke, having slept the first full night in 6 months. I was rested at peace and surprisingly without a hangover. I rolled over to find Ethan snoring softly beside me.

“morning” I said softly, stroking his bare shoulder. “how’s the head.”

Ethan stirred beside me, eyes fluttering open. For a second he looked startled to see me there, then forced a quick smile.

“Morning,” he muttered, sitting up and swinging his legs off the bed.

He rubbed the back of his neck. “Did we… you know?”

I sat up, blinking at him. “Oh, erm, I’m not actually sure.”

The worry that crossed his face was almost comical. He started glancing around the room like he’d lost something.

“What are you looking for?” I asked.

“A condom packet or something,” he muttered.

“Ethan,” I laughed, shaking my head. “Did you forget I’m your wife? It’s fine. We haven’t done anything wrong. I don’t have any diseases… and you don’t… do you?”

“No, course I don’t!” he snapped.

I recoiled, that familiar sting of rejection flaring in my chest all over again.

“Sorry,” he said quickly, rubbing his face. “I just meant… you’re not on anything, are you? I could get you pregnant or something.”

I forced a smile, trying to brush it off like a misunderstanding, but the words still stung. He didn’t want more kids with me. He’d made that crystal clear.

“Relax,” I said softly. “I’m due in a few days anyway. The chances of anything happening are basically zero.”

He nodded, but his jaw stayed tight, eyes fixed anywhere but mine. I told myself it was nothing. Just a slip. Just nerves. Still, a tiny thread of distrust began to knot in my chest, pulling tighter every time I remembered that conversation on the sofa.

The days slipped by, ordinary on the surface but full of little things that dug under my skin. Ethan was quieter again, he was still distant, every so often he would come in for a kiss or a hug then pull away again. It was like, now he knew I knew he was distancing himself he tried to throw my off. He would still take Jessie on their adventures but now he would invite me, we would have a lovely day but when we got home, he would make his bed on the sofa again. It was an emotional rollercoaster I kept telling myself not to overthink it, that I was being hormonal, paranoid, whatever excuse made it easier to swallow. But the memory of his face that morning, the sharp way he recoiled at the thought of me getting pregnant, wouldn’t let me rest.

I blamed my late period on stress at first. Then on my tracking app not working properly. But when two weeks passed, my stomach sank with a mix of dread and disbelief.

I bought a test that day. After I used it, I shoved it into my bedside drawer and left it there, like hiding it might make it less real. It was hours before I worked up the courage to look.

Two pink lines. Clear as day.

I sat with it for weeks. The nausea I blamed on bad milk. The bone-deep tiredness I blamed on Jessie’s teething. Every excuse I could reach for, I used. Anything but the truth tucked away in my bedside drawer.

Ethan didn’t notice. Or maybe he did and chose not to ask. He was distracted, jittery, always finding reasons to be out of the house. When he was home, he’d pace or sit staring at nothing, like a man waiting for a storm he couldn’t stop.

Sometimes I caught him watching me with an expression I couldn’t read. It wasn’t love, and it wasn’t hate. It was something colder. Calculation, maybe.

And still I said nothing.

There was something he wasn’t telling me. Hypocritical, I know, but I had my reasons. No wife should be terrified of telling her husband that *he* got her pregnant.

At the end of the day, I didn’t get myself pregnant. He did this to me. I might have consented, yes, but if someone asked you to kill them and you pulled the trigger, you’d be the one on trial. You’d be the one sentenced. Not the person who asked for it.

One afternoon he was sitting at the kitchen table, watching me in that silent way he sometimes did. His eyes followed me as I stood, and I made a beeline for the basement. That’s where the bleach was kept.

“No!” He shot up so fast his chair screeched across the tiles. “I’ll get it.”

I froze on the step. “What’s your problem? It’s just bleach.”

“I said I’ll get it,” he snapped, already brushing past me toward the door.

I stared at his back, a dozen answers running through my head. He didn’t want me down there. And that stung worse than the words themselves.

I stood at the top of the basement steps, heart thudding. He’d never snapped like that before, not over something so stupid.

The smell of patchouli oil hit me like a brick wall. I staggered back, taking shallow breaths trying to hide the nausea.

“It’s just bleach, Ethan. I can carry a bottle without shattering into pieces.”

“I said I’ll get it,” he barked again, voice too sharp, too fast.

He padded up the stairs, walking straight past me with the bleach and put it next to the sink.

I turned to face him crossing my arms. “What the hell is down there you don’t want me to see? Another woman? drugs? A man spa? What?”

His eyes flicked past me, toward the half-open door, like he expected something to crawl up.

A cold chill ran down my spine, the kind of feeling you get when you’re a child, and you automatically run up your stairs because you think your being chased.

I moved toward the sink as he slinked past me Then he shut it firmly and leaned against it, breathing hard.

“You just don’t need to go down there,” he muttered. “It’s damp. It’s not safe.”

“Not safe?” I snapped. “It’s a basement, not Chernobyl. Jesus, Ethan, you need to make your mind up. You’re either invested in us or your not. Pick one!”

He didn’t answer. Just locked the door and slipped the key into his pocket.

That was the moment my confusion curdled into something uglier. Suspicion. Distrust. Rage. Whatever it was, it meant one thing: I wasn’t welcome in my own damn house.

His phone buzzed on the table,

I looked at it, then at him. He didn’t move. Didn’t even flinch. Just stood there with his hand buried in his pocket, the basement key pressed tight against his thigh.

“Aren’t you going to get that?” I asked.

He shook his head. “It’s nothing.”

Nothing. Right. The screen lit up again, it was face-down but I could see the glint of light reflecting off the table, as I walked away.

My blood boiled. Nothing had a name. Nothing had a number. Nothing had secrets he couldn’t show me.

Now I’m left with is nothing.

The next week was hell. The morning sickness ramped up, and I was wrecked with guilt and anxiety about not telling him. But the bastard didn’t deserve to know.

What if the reason he didn’t want another baby was because he was already shacking up with someone else? Jessie was only seven months old. This must have been going on since before her because he shut me down the second she was born.

Every retch over the toilet, every wave of nausea, I thought of him sneaking around while I carried his child. My body ached, my stomach turned, and still I kept my mouth shut.

And yet, I didn’t leave. With every buzz of his phone, every late night, every diverted question, I still stayed. Because deep down, I was scared. Scared to be a single mother of two. Scared to be divorced at thirty. Scared to be alone.

It makes me wonder now though… if I had left, would things be different?

That night I woke to the sound of Ethan screaming.

For a second I thought it was Jessie, but her soft breaths came steady from the cot beside me. My heart hammered as I crept down the stairs.

The smell hit me before I reached the bottom. Patchouli. Thick and cloying, like the air itself had soured.

He was on the sofa, hunched over, sweat dripping down his temples. His chest heaved like he’d run a mile.

“What the hell is going on?” I snapped. “Who have you had in here?”

His head shot up, eyes wide. “She’s here? Where?”

My blood ran cold. “So, you admit it.”

“What? No—I mean—” He dragged a hand across his face, forcing calm that wasn’t there. “Cara, no one’s here. It’s just work stress, that’s all. You’re imagining things.”

But the patchouli clung to his skin, his clothes, the sofa cushions. And in his eyes, I saw something I couldn’t name—

“Don’t fucking gaslight me.”

I spun on my heel and stormed back upstairs, every step shaking with rage.

“Cara, wait—please,” he called after me, his footsteps heavy on the stairs.

I shoved the bedroom door, but he caught it before it closed, slipping inside. “You’ve got it wrong,” he pleaded, voice cracking. “There’s no one else, I swear.”

“Then why the hell does it smell like her perfume in my house?” I shot back, yanking the covers. “Why do you keep lying to me?”

He reached for me.

“don’t fucking touch me!” I flinched.

His hand hovered, then stilled on my arm. His face changed.

“Cara… what’s this?”

I looked down. Dark smudges, finger-shaped, blooming across my skin. I pulled away fast, heart racing.

“Don’t change the subject,” I snapped, pulling my arm back.

He ignored me. His eyes were still fixed on the bruises. “Do you have any more marks?”

Before I could answer, his hands were on me, pushing up my sleeve, brushing over my skin like he was checking for evidence.

“Ethan, stop!” I shoved at him, but he didn’t listen. His palm slid lower, across my stomach, and he froze.

I realised too late what he’d felt — the slight swell beneath my nightshirt, soft but undeniable.

His face drained of colour.

“You are pregnant,” he whispered. It wasn’t a question. It was confirmation.

my heart stopped. I was frozen in something between terror and shame.

For a second I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think, only felt the weight of his hand against my stomach.

His hands lingered there, his thumb brushing across My belly in a slow, absent caress. This wasn’t the touch of a man planning to leave.

“yeah” I whispered back.

His body sagged with what looked like quiet resignation.

“I tried so hard to stop this,” he whispered, voice breaking.

My stomach knotted.

“Stop what?” I choked out. “Another baby with me, or another secret with her?”

“There’s no *her*, Cara. Not in the way you think, anyway.”

I pulled away from him then, cold rushing into the space between us. He had just admitted it. Right there, in front of me. As his hand lingered on the child growing inside me.

my throat burned as the words rattled around in my head. *Not in the way you think.*

That was it. The confession. Proof I wasn’t crazy after all.

“You’ve been lying to me this whole time,” I hissed, clutching my stomach like I could shield the baby from him. “Dragging me through hell while you sneak off to *her*.”

Ethan shook his head hard, reaching for me again. “Cara, no. It’s not like that—”

“Don’t. touch. me.” My voice cracked but I held my ground. “You made me believe I was paranoid. You made me doubt myself. And all along you had someone else.”

His face crumpled. “It’s not what you think.”

But I’d already decided what it was.

“I want you out.” The words slipped out before I even had time to process them.

He looked at me with something close to terror in his eyes. “No,” he croaked.

“Yes!” I doubled down, my voice shaking. “Get out!”

“You’re not safe,” he whispered.

The way he said it made my skin crawl. I thought he meant from him. From the man who had just confessed another woman.

But now, looking back, I know that wasn’t what he meant at all.

I went to Jessie, scooping her up with shaking hands. She buried her wet face in my neck, her tiny fists clinging to me as if she could feel it too.

That smell hit me again. Patchouli. Thick, choking, sweet in a way that made my stomach twist.

“What the fuck, Ethan?” I snapped, rocking Jessie against me. “Get her out of here!”

My own words froze in my throat. *Her.* I didn’t even know why I said it.

yanked open the door, Jessie pressed tight against me. Ethan stood there in the hallway; his face drained of colour.

He wasn’t looking at me. He was staring straight ahead, past my shoulder, breathing fast, eyes wide, too scared to move.

For a heartbeat, the air thickened, and I felt it too — the weight of something else standing with us, unseen but heavy enough to press against my skin.

Then it was gone along with the smell of patchouli, like it was sucked out of the air.

Ethan stood frozen at my door. Like a rabbit caught in headlights.

“What’s happening?” I whispered, my voice barely a thread of sound over Jessie’s wails.

Ethan’s lips moved, his eyes still locked forward. “She wants her debt paid.”

My stomach dropped. “What debt?”

He didn’t answer. Couldn’t. His whole body shook like a man trying not to break.

Jessie screamed against my shoulder, and I clutched her tighter, terror clawing up my spine.

\*

I sat cross-legged on the bed, staring at the digital clock. The rhythmic flashing of 6:00 a.m. soothed something inside me.

Ethan rocked Jessie silently in her crib. We hadn’t slept since the incident at the door. I hadn’t asked for an explanation yet, and Ethan hadn’t offered one.

Tap tap. Tap tap.

The sound made us both jump.

“What the fuck is that?” Ethan exclaimed, pointing to the half-cracked window.

Perched on the sill sat a crow, the morning light reflecting off its feathers. My heart settled.

“Chill. It’s Jerry. The crow I feed when I can’t sleep. He’s kind of got into a routine.”

Ethan raised an eyebrow. “Crows aren’t white.”

“This one is.”

I crossed the room and picked a cracker off the dresser, slipping it through the crack in the window. Jerry snapped it up neatly, white feathers gleaming in the pale light.

He seemed to nod a thank you before disappearing back into the gloom.

“Why didn’t you tell me?” Ethan’s voice cut through the silence.

I glanced back at him, frowning. “It’s just a crow.”

“Not the crow, Cara.” His eyes didn’t leave mine, wide and unblinking. “About the baby.”

“I was scared, Ethan,” I whispered. “I thought you hated me. I thought you didn’t want me.”

“of course I do,” he said quickly, almost tripping over the words. “I love you, Cara. More than anything. You just don’t understand?”

“Then make me understand!” My voice rose sharper than I meant it to. Jessie stirred in her crib, gave a soft whimper, then settled back into sleep.

Ethan’s hands twitched, like he wanted to reach for me but didn’t know how. “Cara, please. You have to know, this isn’t about you. It’s about—”

“About what? Your needs? My lack of attention what?!” The words were out before I could stop them, and they hit us both harder than I expected.

“No!” He flinched, almost angry now. “God, no. It’s not about that. It’s—”

His eyes dropped to the floor, and I saw it. The weight of something he was holding back, something darker than I could guess.

“Then what is it, Ethan?” I pushed. “What is so bad that you’ve been hiding it all this time?”

He opened his mouth, then closed it again, like the words wouldn’t come.

“You were so sad Cara. After…Oscar.”

“don’t you dare blame this on me!”

“Listen please!” he begged. And I did. The words that came out of his mouth were like something from a b rated horror movie.

“I was hurting too, after Oscar. But everyone is always so focused on the mother, the father gets forgotten. I found a forum, a website for dads just like me. We had all lost a child in one way or another, it was comforting.”

His voice shook, but there was almost relief in getting it out.

“We talked, shared stories. Then one of them, Alex, messaged me directly. Said he could help. Said there were ways. That there’s someone you can go to if you were struggling.”

I frowned, felling the guilt rising in my throat “Ethan—”

“Please! I need to get this out. It’s important now more than ever” he cut in quickly, eyes wide. “She helps. She bargains. If you want a child, she will give you one. All she asks is that, in time, you give her something back.”

He rubbed at his face, trembling. “It sounded mad at first. Like a horror story. But Alex swore it worked. He said he had proof. And Cara, I thought maybe this was our chance. Our second chance.”

The room felt colder. The words didn’t sound like comfort. They sounded like chains being snapped shut.

“This person…” I started.

“No. See, that’s the thing. She’s not really a person. Not anymore. That’s what made it unbelievable. But he showed me. He had his son, Max, after his wife was diagnosed infertile. All he had to give in return was his voice.”

He was rambling now, speaking too fast. I wasn’t sure if he was trying to convince me or himself. I opened my mouth to interject, but he cut me off.

“He was a singer. It wasn’t his job; he just liked to do it. See, she wants something you treasure but you don’t know the true value of until it’s gone. Something you won’t realise you’ll miss until she’s taken it. Now he can’t speak above a whisper. That’s why I was getting so many texts. Or if he called, I’d leave the room. It’s hard to hear him.”

He nodded at me like explaining it this way would make it all make perfect sense.

Outside the door, the floor creaked. A long, dragging sound moved down the hall. My chest tightened.

I forced a laugh, brittle and too loud. “So, what, Ethan? You think some whispering bogeywoman hands out miracle babies in exchange for party tricks? Do you hear yourself?”

The smile fell from my face as the sound outside the door stopped dead. The silence pressed in.

I dropped my voice. “What did she ask you for?”

Ethan’s eyes were fixed on me, wide and glassy in the dim light. He looked like a man who had already answered that question a hundred times in his head but never out loud.

“The one thing I wanted was a large family.”

Ethan’s voice was raw, almost broken. “She wanted my ability to have more kids.”

An unexpected snort escaped me; my body relaxed a little. “Well, that’s not true, is it?” I put a hand to my stomach. “Look at me.”

He shook his head, eyes shining. “No. You don’t understand. You can still get pregnant. That’s not what she took.” His breath shuddered out. “She wants to take them. All of them.”

The words hollowed me out. For a second I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe. The sound outside the bedroom door came again, a dragging weight against the floorboards, as if something was waiting for us to accept the bargain.

I stared at him, horror knotting in my chest. He grabbed my wrist like he was begging me to believe him. “I tried not to get you pregnant, Cara. Can’t you see? I did this for us.”

“*Tried* not to get me pregnant?” The words tore out of me. “What the fuck, Ethan? You’re not an animal. You slept downstairs so you didn’t get me pregnant? For fuck’s sake, you could have had a vasectomy.”

His face crumpled. “I didn’t think of that.”

The room went ice cold.

“What?” I whimpered, eyes darting between his and the bedroom door.

Before I could answer, something slammed against the door so hard the frame rattled.

Then came the scratching. Slow, deliberate, like nails dragged down the wood grain. The sound set my teeth on edge.

A sickly wave of patchouli seeped under the door, thick and wrong, as if the room itself was filling with her breath.

I pressed both hands to my stomach and couldn’t stop shaking as Ethan ran over pressing his hands against the door.

“That’s her, isn’t it?” I said, my voice barely more than a breath.

Ethan’s hand stayed on the flimsy wood. His knuckles were white. “Yes,” he whispered. “It’s her.”

The scratching paused, like she had been listening for his answer. Then it dragged across the wood again, slower, crueller.

The scratching paused, like she was listening.

“She knows you know now,” he said.

“She knows you’re not happy. She knew you were pregnant. That’s why it started up again. And now she’s impatient.”

My throat tightened. “*Impatient.* That’s what the text meant.”

I stood from the bed frantic now “Alex. Alex must know how to stop this.”

The scratching started again, dragging lower this time, closer to the floor. The smell of patchouli thickened until it sat on my tongue.

Jessie’s cry split the air, high and panicked from the corner of the room. I stumbled to the cot and scooped her up, pressing her trembling body to my chest.

Ethan fumbled his phone out of his pocket, hands shaking so hard he almost dropped it. He jabbed at the screen, pressed it to his ear.

“Alex,” he hissed. “She’s here. Tell me what to do.”

Static, then a rasping whisper.

“I can’t hear you!” Jessie’s cries escalated as the banging and scratching increased in volume.

“Say again!” Ethan cried plugging his ear with his other hand, back firmly planted on the door.

His face drained of colour.

“Agree,” he said, nodding frantically at me. “Just agree out loud.”

I clutched Jessie tighter, her wails hot against my neck. “Agree to what?”

The scratching at the door stopped. The silence on the other side was worse than the sound.

“Agree to give her the baby” he pleaded.

I clutched Jessie tighter; her little fists knotted in my shirt. My throat was raw, but the word wouldn’t come.

“No,” I said, shaking my head. “I’m not giving her anything.”

Ethan’s face twisted, a mix of fear and despair. He pressed the phone harder to his ear as if Alex could crawl through and fix it for him.

“No,” I whispered again, laying my hand gently against Jessie’s damp cheek. “I won’t.”

On the other side of the door, the scratching stopped.

A heavy silence filled the room.

Silence.

Jessie no longer cried in fear. She no longer cried at all.

She wasn’t breathing.

Her arms released from my shirt and flopped lifelessly to her side.

“Ethan!” I screamed.

He spun toward me, eyes wide, the phone slipping from his hand and clattering to the floor.

Jessie’s head lolled against my chest, her lips parted, her skin already cooling.

Ethan dropped to his knees beside us, hands fumbling uselessly. “No, no, no—don’t let her take her instead!”

Ethan dropped to his knees beside us, pressing his hands to her tiny chest, breathing into her mouth, begging between gasps. “Come on, come on, breathe for me, baby girl, please…”

I could still hear the phone, Alex’s voice rattling out of the speaker in a broken croak. “Agree… agree…”

My hand shook as I reached for it. I pressed it to my ear and heard him sobbing, whispering the word again and again, a desperate chant.

I looked at Ethan, hunched and frantic, trying and failing to bring Jessie back. The room smelled of patchouli, thick as smoke, pressing in on all sides.

My throat closed, but the word forced itself out, a broken whimper into the void.

“OK… I agree.”

For a heartbeat, nothing.

Then Jessie arched in Ethan’s arms with a sharp, rattling gasp. Her tiny chest rose, a cry bursting out of her that split the silence.

I crawled to her, sobbing and held them both against me, kissing her damp hair as her fists tightened in my shirt again.

Ethan fell back on his heels, tears streaking his face, staring at her like she was both a miracle and a curse.

The scratching at the door was gone.

But the smell of patchouli still lingered.

I’m 20 weeks pregnant today. It’s a boy. We sat at the ultrasound with faces like stone. Ethan won’t look at the pictures. He just stares at my stomach like it’s already a grave.

I don’t know why I’m writing this here. Maybe I just need someone to tell me what to do. Maybe someone has heard of her before. The Hollow Lady.

Because if Ethan is right, the baby growing inside me doesn’t belong to me at all.

It belongs to her.
