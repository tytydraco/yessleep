So, as everyone knows spring is a few weeks away from settling in but her effects have already started appearing. There is a lot more heat, day is longer which I really like ,pollen is all around and finally caterpillars are crawling everywhere in town. I have serious allergies with caterpillars and pollen so I have been suffering a lot lately but the sunny scenery of my town is worth it. However those small disgusting pests are acting especially odd and honestly it is starting to make me anxious. I know you are gonna think I am paranoid but trust me these things are not normal caterpillars.

It started passively. At first I would randomly find caterpillars inside my pockets which when I grabbed them to throw away they triggered my allergies and made my hands swollen for days. Because of that happening regularly I was forced to stay at home a lot more isolated from my friends but then they started appearing at my house too. In my drawers,my closets and even under my couch cushions there were tons of them almost like every caterpillars in town was invading my privacy. For 2 days I tried to take care of it by myself but no progress was made so I decided to hire a bug exterminator. After inspecting the house for a while we started talking about how long it would take and how much it would cost.

\-So what do you make of the situation?

\-It’s definitely the first time I see an infestation of caterpillars but I suppose half a day is gonna be more than enough as for the price.I interrupted him.

\-Just tell me when you are done and I’ll pay any price I need them gone.

\-Alright sir let me set up my equipment and come back tomorrow at midday alright?

\-Yeah just fine thank you.

I packed my stuff and stayed at a motel where I stayed for the rest of the day thankfully without caterpillars to trigger my allergies but then I woke up next morning with tons of them circling around my bed like vultures. I stood up almost immediately after noticing them trying not to fall off and into them suddenly I heard whistling from the hall and they all left my room and followed the sound. When I got over the shock I ran to the haul to see who was whistling but I was too late and the whistler had disappeared together with the caterpillars. I couldn’t bear the thought of staying there a minute more so I packed quickly,checked out and wasted my time in a restaurant eagerly waiting to go back to my home after the extermination. After killing some hours my watch reached 12.00 so I started heading back home to finally let my head relax. The exterminator’s van was still there but no sign of him I thought that he was still finishing off his work so I waited for a couple of minutes hoping to see him walk out my door asking for his pay however that moment never happened and after waiting for more than 40 minutes I called his company.

\-Hello I hired one of your exterminators and I am back at the time he told me while also waiting for about 40 minutes more and only his van is here can you provide any help?

\-Yes of course sir I am gonna send someone to your house can you give me an address?

\-Yeah it’s {CENCORED}.

\-Thank you expect us to arrive at about 10 minutes.

\-Thank you I will be waiting.

After ten minutes that felt like an eternity I finally saw another van similar to the one parked outside my house and my worries were put to rest for a bit. The van parked close to me and a guy not more than 30 got out and started walking towards me we started talking. I explained the whole situation ,not mentioning the motel incident,and he started checking out the van

\-Yeah there’s no doubt that’s Mike’s van is he still inside?

\-I...I suppose so yeah.

\-Ok I am gonna report it later to the boss but first put these on. He gave me a gas mask and an exterminator plastic suit

\-Are we gonna go inside?

\-Yeah I want to talk to him and I need you to show me around.

\-Alright.

We went in. The house was covered with caterpillar shells hanging from corners and extermination equipment scattered around the floor the sight alone made my heart skip a beat. Suddenly while we were walking around a weird repeating sound of something wet and sloppy flopping around causing both of our hearts to skip a beat. We slowly walked towards the sound locating the room where it was coming from and after taking a deep breath he opened the door slowly. What followed was a moment I will never be able to forget. Mike’s body was on the floor lifeless with caterpillars the size of a laptop crawling inside his mouth,stomach,hands and legs using him as a human cocoon. After we finished screaming we ran out as fast we could almost tripping down the stairs and left with his van. After catching our breath we started talking about what we could do.

 \-H...have you ever seen anything like that?

\-No what’s wrong with you of course I haven’t god those things the size of them.

\-What should we do?

\-YOU ARE GONNA STAY IN A HOTEL FAR AWAY FROM YOUR HOUSE and I. He sighed.

\-I am gonna try to convince someone from my office to come see it with his eyes so we can get the big guns evolved.

\-Yeah fine by me just call me when it’s all done I don’t even want to think about it again.

   I am now out of town on the run due to what happened when I followed the exterminator’s advice. It was night time and I decided to stay at a far away motel so there wouldn’t be any problems but I could not for the life of me close my eyes without the image of Mike being crawled in by giant caterpillars popping up. Around 5 am I started hearing a knock on the door when I asked who was it no one answered and instead a familiar whistle could be noticed. Suddenly I heard the sound of something heavy repeatedly being hit onto the door. I was terrified out of my mind. Then someone or better something had started whispering.-easy money,as much as I want,what a weirdo. Then my scream echoed muffled from the other side of the door which froze me dead at my place. The banging continued and continued until I couldn’t handle it anymore jumped out the window spraining my ankle and drove away from town where I am now on the road driving to god knows where someone please help me figure out what’s going on.
