[It’s been a while](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o4we5o/i_am_a_banisher_reflections_are_the_bane_of_my/). Sorry about that. Things got weirder, if you can believe it.

It all started with that stupid wet patch, right in the middle of the hallway wall. In hindsight, I am not a clever man. To be fair, I never claimed I was.

A damp spot wouldn’t be entirely unbelievable. I live in a pretty old building and my landlord is shady as can be, and most of the other residents are, well, old? Rent is pretty cheap, so I never complained when things didn’t get fixed and shit like that. Not my jam.

Guess that might not matter, anymore.

I was collecting snails, as you do. Had lost count of the dumps, at that point. I know I was up to four separate piles in different locations, and that the number kept creeping down. I know the last count was 587, at least.

When I returned from that last dump, it was already dark outside. *Very* dark. That kind where the streetlights don’t reach very far, just a slight orange-red glow right beneath. Bit spooky, to be honest, which was the first warning sign: I am not usually afraid of the dark. Not at all.

I was halfway through taking my shoes off when I noticed it again. I looked not because I *wanted* to but because I *had* to. Second warning.

I could feel it, then: The anchor. It felt… different, from others. Usually, the anchors feel *heavy*. It’s not a physical sensation as much as an emotional one. You’re drawn to it, it *wants* you to look. It wants to scare you.

This one felt more hollow, or inverted. The usual pressure in my bones wasn’t present, there was no *pull*. 

I walked closer, anyway. Why had it suddenly decided to appear?

My eyes were locked to the patch, and I approached with my single sneaker, left the other one by the door. 

It looked as if it pulsed, or bulged, when the low light hit it. It was strangely illuminated, even though my apartment was pretty dark. There was no way it *actually* bulged, my brain reasoned. Surely it must be a trick of the light? 

I got closer, rested my hand next to it. The wall felt solid. I gave it a knock, and it sounded like it should. Not hollow. Woody and solid. I can’t really explain what happened next.

Right next to my hand, a bubble was forming in the wallpaper, distorting the daisy above it grotesquely. 

It grew, stretched, and— *pop!*

Skalman, his little splotch even more smudged than before, slid out. Landed on the skirting board with a soft click.

I stared at him.

He stared back, I think.

Then, another *click*. And another. And another. Then the entire patch gave way.

You know how it feels to peel off a scab? If that made a sound, *that’s* what that sounded like. Horrible and papery and *wet*, and for a split second I knew exactly what would transpire, yet I didn’t move.

An *impossible* amount of snails came pouring out of the slit, an obscene and slow fall of soft clicks and little heads and eyeballs and mouths and it *just kept coming*.

They brought the smell with them, growing for each snail that was making its way out: sick and sweet, of mould and decay and rot and forest. Of earth and dirt and rocks and soil and—

By the time my brain *finally* decided that stepping back was a fine idea, the whole wall looked alive. The paper bulged and rippled and *pulsed*, the wall following along in soft ripples, and there were snails *everywhere*. The outline of the patch seemed to grow, wider and taller, as the slit opened more. 

I said something brave, like “oh fuck me oh hell no”, and then the lights went out.

The silence that followed wasn’t normal. It was deep and dull, and everything disappeared at once: I couldn’t hear my own breaths, or the buzzing of the freezer, or my heartbeat. I couldn’t feel anything either. As if all my senses went out with the light. 

Then, they were back. In the dark. On me and over me and *everywhere*. Tiny ribs and shells and mouths, chewing and kissing and leaving wet trails all over my body and limbs. Sure, snails aren’t *fast*, but there were *so many of them*.

When my brain caught up for the second time, I think the first thing I did was scream until my throat was hoarse. Then, I clawed. I scratched and ripped and spun around like a clumsy ballerina, trying to get these fuckers *off*. It was entirely an animalistic instinct, by the way, I don’t think there was a singular conscious thought in that entire sequence. Just *off with them!*

I stumbled, backward. Still blind and deaf and mute and numb. Eventually, I hit the other opposing hallway wall. My back went from damp and cold to *wet*, the remaining shards sharp. It startled me enough to force my feet forward, and—

*Crunch*

*Crunch*

*Crunch*

It felt as if I was stepping on glass marbles, soaked in thick syrup. The floor suddenly had a give it didn’t have before, my feet sinking down with each wet, crunchy step into the carpet of shells and slime and pulsing meat.

I tripped, then. I don’t know on what. I caught myself on the doorframe, and I know this because I could see again.

Then, nausea hit me like a truck. For a moment, everything spun around and around and around and there was snails everywhere still and I couldn’t fucking *breathe*.

Then, just all at once, it stopped. I was completely still, for a little while.

There were no snails, not on me. My eyes were locked to the floor, though, and that was *covered*. Not snails, mind you, but their bones. Shells of all colours, the usual. 

When I reached for the switch, my fingers sank into the wall. Not entirely through, not clean like that, but still *into*. Felt like pushing my hand into a soggy loaf of bread, but still better than the snails eating my skin flakes. I pulled back, looked. The plastic of the switch had been pushed into a palm-shaped hole.

It was dark, still. No lights were on. I was still undeniably in my apartment, though, which felt comforting for all of two seconds. Then, I noticed two things.

Firstly, I could see my living room window when I turned my head. I was no longer on the fifth floor. 

Secondly, Skalman was sitting on my phone, on the floor, softly illuminated by the screen. There were no traces of other, well, *live* snails. I snatched the entire setup up, inspected him closely.

He looked like a snail.

No glowing eyes, strange markings, no secrets etched into his shell. Just a very average, very moist yet *normal* snail, with a smudged splotch on his shell and a cool name. I almost laughed.

The background of my phone, below his trail, was a photo of a forest. Looked like one of those standard ones, you know? Except, my background had been this stupid picture of a *really* nice kebab I had taken months ago. Nope, no more kebab: Just pine trees.

The same ones I could see outside the window.

I don’t even know how to begin to describe the situation, from here. It’s difficult.

I am not at home, except I kind of am? Like, my apartment is here. Just a box of wood frame and plaster board, if you look at it from outside. It’s no longer in the building, obviously.

My phone works fine, but obviously I don’t have water or electricity. 

That felt like a win, at first, but less and less since time passed here. What do you *do?*

Call 112 (that’s 911, for you Americans)? The city council?

*Yes, hello*, *I would like to report subpar living conditions… oh? Where? Well, nowhere!*

Nope. Google it? What the fuck do I *google?* I thought this post was to be the helpful thing and honestly, so far I’ve only gotten one or two leads. I guess no one knows about snauntings, or wherever the fuck I am at.

I did call Henning, and registered an emergency ticket. I don’t know.

It took four tries to reach Henning, and he was *underwhelmingly* upset about the situation I had found myself in.

“Why are you *calling* me?” He whined. “You haven’t picked up a new assignment for the last week.”

“Uh, yeah. That’s the thing.”

I explained, or at least I tried to. Patch, snails (more snails), walls. The not-fifth floor. The pine trees. I even described Skalman in detail, because why not? 

Henning listened, patiently. Didn’t interrupt, but I could tell the air over the crunchy line was one filled with a slight annoyance. When I finished, there was a long pause. I held my breath. 

Then, he sighed heavily. I could hear rustling in the background.

“Alright,” he started. “So, you’re stuck somewhere *weird.*”

“Yeah.”

“And you don’t know if it’s a *where.”*

“Correct.”

“And there’s still ghost snails.”

“Not ghosts, and not snails. Just shells. And Skalman.”

“Well. Good for you.”

Another pause. I could almost hear him scroll through whatever mental spreadsheet handlers keep in their big brains, looking for the entry for “ghost snails” or “accidental trans-planar housing incident”. With snails. Snincident?

“Here’s what I’ll do,” he said, softly. “I’ll open a secondary ticket and get that streamlined for you, see if we can get an Archivist to help out. Easier that way. Then, I’ll also contact maintenance. Y’know, just in case.”

“In case of *what?*”

“Well, in case this were to take a dark turn. Sorry to be blunt, but there’s not much we can do without more information. I guess you’re going to have to gather that.”

He sighed heavily. More rustling. Papers being moved, the scratch of a pencil.

“Meanwhile,” he continued, “I’d suggest you do your fucking *job*, Arvid. You’re a Banisher. Not a very good one, by the sound of it, but you need to do *something*. What’s gonna happen, more snails? So far, they haven’t hurt you. I don’t even think they’re important.”

I paused then, too. Except for the, well, hurting of my feelings a little, he had a point.

There was not more to the exchange, really. He just kind of reiterated “do your job you moron”, then hung up.

So, anyway. I’ve been bringing Skalman on walks, around the… eh, neighbourhood? It just looks like forest to me, except unusually crunchy. Just pine trees and roots, the occasional moss or fern. Smells exactly as you’d expect, too. Haven’t seen any more snails, either.

I’ve also done inventory. I have most of my shit still, interestingly. So, bags of salt. Some holy water. Herbs, iron, planks. Chants and charms, the lot. The only thing that clearly *is* missing is my one sneaker, the one I took off before digging myself deeper in the shit, and I still haven’t found it.

Annoying, but I had more shoes. So, eh. It was a damn good sneaker, though.

I have been preparing. To do what I *know* works, at least some of the time: A banishment ritual.

Now, I am not entirely sure *which* one to do. I don’t know which religion or belief had anchored, eh, snails? And pine? Into existence.

I figure I can’t make shit worse, anyway, so I think I’ll just… combine. 

There’s not really been any more spooky shit, except that I don’t know where I am or what the fuck is going on. I don’t dare to go too far away from the apartment-non-apartment, but it’s been two days or whatever and it feels odd to be this alone.

Sure, I have always been alone, I think. A little bit. But there’s still *people* everywhere, you know? On the streets, in the buildings, out and about and inside. Everywhere, at any point, within a few kilometres: people. I never thought about it as a fundamental truth, not until it no longer felt like it *was* one. It feels less safe, I guess. Something primal with groups, with *adjacency*.

Anyway. Back to the banishment, and my attempt so far.

For my first try, I went with a hybrid. The ol’ “when in doubt throw the entirety of the pantheon at it” approach. Bit of psalms, some Norse wards, a sprinkle of folk charms and generic chants for extra flavour. Salted the floor in a half circle, mixed it with two different herb mixes. Smells pleasant in here now, if nothing else. Set up some candles (battery-driven, because apparently I came prepared for liminal camping), poured a little of the holy water into a chipped coffee mug.

It’s hard to pray when you don’t know what for or to *what*, but I gave it my best shot. When nothing really seemed to change, I resorted to begging. A little might not hurt, you know?

“I don’t know what you are,” I said to the wall or the air or myself. “But I am asking you *very* nicely: Please let me go home. Thanks.”

Nothing answered. The candles flickered a little, but they’re *built* to do that, so do with that information what you will.

Skalman had teleported to the opposite side of the room, from my shoulder, sometime during the setup. He was happily munching away (I think) at the soggy wall, as far away from the… ritual-site as he could get.

Now, that’s interesting. Could mean *something* worked.

Or maybe he just has boundaries. Recognises crazy when he sees it, that stuff.

Either way, I guess I’ll have to keep watch tonight. It’s still *too* quiet.
