I knew “Secret Catcher” back when he was just Adrian Blackwater, a pimple-faced nerd who sat next to me in Freshman English. Our seats were assigned by the professor, and I don’t think I would have chosen him as my seat mate otherwise. He had, what my Mom calls, “darty eyes”, the kind of gaze that never quite connects with yours. He would also draw stick figures fucking during the lectures.

After college and everything that happened, I tried to ignore his newfound success, but I was seeing it everywhere. As his YouTube channel blew up, he got brand deals, TV appearances, an interview on *60-minutes*. But, I didn’t tell people I knew him. If I did, I’d have to share *everything* I knew about him, which I didn’t want to do. It was embarrassing, and frightening, and if I spoke it out loud I worried he might come back and finish what he started.

The premise of his channel was simple—he’d go up to crowds and ask people their biggest secret. It started as people admitting to drunk hookups, but then he made his way to political rallies and different alternative communities. His videos that did the best normally involved mentally-ill conservatives, religious fanatics, or poor people. Someone would say something crazy, which would then get edited with drastic zooms and goofy music. People loved it, which made sense. Society has always loved to mock the sick and the poor, and his videos were no different.

After college, I moved to California, hoping my incident would stay on the coast where it occurred. But, as his channel grew in popularity, I couldn’t run from it. My roommate, who looked like the caricature of “Los Angeles Twenty-Something”, loved his content and, on multiple occasions, told me how hot she thought he was. But, as much as she tried to sell me on his desirability, I couldn’t shake the image of him standing outside my house.

“You’ll change your mind one day,” she would say. 

Then, last night, things *did* change. I heard her scream from her bedroom. A minute later, she ran into my room, her phone screen pushed into my face.

“Did you see?” She asked.

I took her phone and looked at it. The article was from *The New York Times*. Adrian’s picture, which was him at a protest with a microphone in his hand, was right below the title: *Four Women Come Forward with Allegations Against Radical Journalist “Secret Catcher”*.

My hand went numb as I scrolled through the text. I couldn’t even read it—I just stared at the screen for what felt like the appropriate amount of time.

“Wow,” I finally said, handing her back the phone.

“I’m devastated,” she said.

I nodded, hoping my quiet would make her leave. But, she sat on my bed, tears welling in her eyes.

“It’s just… I don’t know. He was doing such incredible journalism, going to the kind of places CNN and MSNBC would never go. Why can’t we just get one person who doesn’t suck?”

I shook my head. As she spoke, I tried to ignore to numbness as it made its way up my arm and shoulders. It felt like he was touching me again.

“It’s getting late,” I said.

“I invited over some people, if that’s okay,” she said, flipping a strand of dyed pink hair behind her ear, “We’re going to have a little memorial. You know the girls from my improv class right?”

I nodded. When they got together, they liked to scream and pretend box one another.

“We always send each other his videos,” she said. “We’re all just so devastated. I thought burning his picture while we rewatch some of our favorite videos of his might make us feel better.”

I nodded again, studying the numbness as it walked down my back. I closed my eyes, which was a bad idea. When I did, I saw him again. I remember the pebble hitting my window. As I got out of bed to see what the noise was, I saw him in my front yard, stumbling back and forth. He waved to me. It took me a second to even recognize him—we hadn’t exchanged a single word since that Freshman lecture hall two years before. I opened the window and yelled down to him.

“Are you lost?” I asked.

“Not anymore,” he called back, his words slurring. Then, he walked toward the front door.

I thought I locked the door. I always locked the door, didn’t I? But, then I heard someone walking up the stairs. My housemates had all gone home for the weekend. There was only one person it could have been.

I ran to lock my bedroom door, but it was too late. The doorknob turned and the door swung open, pushing me back. I looked up at his silhouette in the doorway, his posture slouched and breathing heavy.

“I’gawd a secret,” he mumbled, pointing at me. “I have a crush on YOU!”

He walked toward me. I wanted to scream, but it was a college town; people were screaming up and down the street all night. He yanked off his shirt, revealing a flabby stomach and droopy chest. He had a couple of small, ironic tattoos—a beer can with a “Mom” banner over it, Santa riding in a convertible, two cats kissing. He, like so many men at my liberal arts college, were the kind of guys where nothing was supposed to mean what it really meant, where reality could be bent to their liking. He reached for my face, pulling me toward his with hot, sweaty hands.

“Hey,” my roommate barked, snapping her fingers in my face. “I asked if it’s cool if my friends come over?”

I nodded again.

“Yeah. I just—“

“We talked about being better at communication,” she said. “We split this rent 50/50. I shouldn’t even have to ask to invite my friends over, but it’s a courtesy to you. Maybe I won’t even ask anymore, I don’t know.”

With that, she stood up and left, slamming my door behind her.

I stared at my closed door for a moment, remembering how safe I used to feel behind one. 

I spent the night scrolling through the comments on his Instagram apology, which was a screenshot from the notes app. He begged his supporters to believe the victims, saying that we should always believe women. He said his actions were a result of toxic masculinity, which was followed by a story about his father beating his mother. He said everyone could use a lesson in consent, and he hoped his supporters would learn from “this situation”. At the bottom of the apology, he directed his followers to a link for a GoFundMe for his victims. He put up another post a few minutes later, stating that his next video series would be him sitting down face-to-face with his victims, taking “accountability” to the next level.

I don’t know what I expected from the comments underneath it. Maybe I was hoping there would be no comments at all, that Adrian’s voice would finally fall on deaf ears. But, instead, I read things like “this just ruined my weekend” and “can’t we have just one good guy?”. The more I read, the sicker I felt, which was only made worse by the screams and laughs of my roommate and her friends. Not long after, our fire alarm went off. I guess they burned his picture. They all cheered.

I imagined his face, twisting and blackened by the approaching fire, smoke rising off his charred skin. Like everything else, I thought it would make me feel better, but it didn’t. I also thought about taking my story to Instagram, of adding fuel to the fire. But, I knew that wouldn’t help. The jury had clearly decided.

I remember back in high school before Adrian broke me, I was with my Dad in a Grand Canyon thrift shop. There was a whole section of the store dedicated to Bigfoot. I asked him why so many people loved him—wasn’t he supposed to be a monster? Dad put his arm around me and whispered in my ear. 

“People say they hate monsters, but that’s a lie. Everyone loves a monster. That’s why we want to film them,” he said. “Humans are dazzled by [dangerous things.](https://www.dandeluise.com/)”
