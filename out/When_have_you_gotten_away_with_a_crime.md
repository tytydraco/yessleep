The streetlights outside my window cast long, skeletal shadows across the living room floor. It was late, past midnight, and the silence was usually a comfort. Tonight, it felt like a drum, amplifying the frantic knocking that had just started at my back door. *Knock, knock, knock-knock-knock.* Aggressive. Impatient.

I froze. Who on earth would be at my door at this hour, especially the back door? My heart hammered against my ribs. This wasn't the kind of neighborhood where you got surprise visits after dark. A cold dread seeped into my bones.

The knocking intensified, followed by a muffled shout. "Hey! I know you're in there! Open up!"

It was that new guy from down the street, the one with the loud car and the perpetually scowling face. He'd moved in a few weeks ago and had already caused a ruckus with the neighbors over his barking dog and late-night parties. I'd tried to avoid him, but he seemed to have a knack for finding trouble. Or, in this case, bringing it to my doorstep.

"I saw your lights! Open the damn door, I need a word with you!" His voice was slurred, thick with what sounded like alcohol. Great. A drunk, angry neighbor at my back door. My hand instinctively went to the heavy iron poker by the fireplace. Just in case.

"Look, I don't want any trouble," I called out, trying to keep my voice steady. "You should go home. It's late."

He laughed, a harsh, grating sound. "Trouble? You're the one who's going to have trouble if you don't open up right now! I know what you did!"

My blood ran cold. *What I did?* This was escalating quickly. He started rattling the doorknob, hard. The old wood groaned. Was he trying to break in? My mind raced. This wasn't just a drunk neighbor; this felt like a threat. A genuine, terrifying threat. My grip on the poker tightened.

The rattling stopped abruptly. There was a moment of silence, and then a loud *CRACK* as something hit the door. He was trying to smash it in. Panic seized me. I couldn't let him in. Not him. Not like this.

I braced myself, waiting for the next blow, but it didn't come. Instead, there was a sudden, sharp *thud* from the other side, followed by a choked gasp. Then, silence. Utter, complete silence.

I waited, poker still raised, for what felt like an eternity. Nothing. No more shouts, no more rattling, no more thuds. Just the distant hum of the city. Slowly, cautiously, I lowered the poker and crept towards the door, peering through the peephole.

He was there, lying on the ground, still. A dark, spreading stain bloomed on the concrete beside his head. He must have slipped, or maybe tripped over something in the dark, and hit his head hard. What a clumsy fool. It was an accident. A tragic, unfortunate accident.

I sighed, the tension slowly draining from my body, replaced by a strange, almost clinical calm. It was a mess, certainly. A problem to be dealt with. But at least the immediate threat was gone.

The first step was to ensure no one saw. The back alley was usually deserted at this hour. I dragged him inside, the surprising lightness of his frame a minor convenience. The floorboards creaked under his weight, but the house was old, and the sounds were familiar to me. I worked quickly, efficiently, cleaning the concrete outside with a bucket of water and a stiff brush until no trace remained. Inside, the process was more involved.

I laid him out on the tarp in the basement, the fluorescent light casting a stark, unflattering glow on his pale skin. His face, even in death, held that same scowl. Such a waste of good potential. I ran my gloved hand along his jawline, feeling the firm structure beneath. Yes, this would do nicely.

The initial incision was clean, precise, following the natural lines of the body. The blade, honed to a razor's edge, slid through skin and muscle with satisfying ease. The rich, coppery scent filled the air, a familiar perfume that always sharpened my focus. First, the major arteries, carefully drained to prevent excessive bruising. I worked with a surgeon's meticulousness, separating muscle groups, admiring the intricate architecture of the human form. The deep red of the muscle fibers, the pearly sheen of the tendons, the glistening white of the bone â€“ each component was a testament to nature's design.

I started with the thighs, the thick, lean meat always a favorite. Slicing away the quadriceps and hamstrings, I trimmed them meticulously, removing any fascia or excess fat. The texture was perfect, firm yet yielding. Next, the glutes, large and substantial, perfect for a slow roast. I moved to the torso, carefully excising the tenderloin and sirloin equivalents, the prime cuts. The ribs, too, would be excellent, stripped clean and slow-cooked until the meat fell off the bone.

The organs were always a special treat. The liver, rich and iron-filled, would be pan-seared with a touch of garlic and herbs. The heart, resilient and strong, could be thinly sliced for a carpaccio or diced into a stew. Even the brain, a delicate, almost custardy texture, had its own unique appeal, best served lightly scrambled. I carefully separated the head, the skull surprisingly robust, but easily managed with the right tools. The eyes, still wide and staring, were removed and set aside; some things are best discarded.

Hours passed, marked only by the rhythmic scrape of the blade and the soft thud of muscle hitting the prepared containers. By the time the first hint of dawn touched the sky, the basement was pristine, and the freezer was well-stocked. I wiped down my tools, each one gleaming, and carefully put them away.

I brewed a fresh pot of coffee, the aroma mingling pleasantly with the lingering, faint scent of my night's work. The morning news would likely report a missing person, perhaps a "clumsy drunk" who wandered off. They'd never suspect the quiet neighbor, the one who just wanted to be left alone.

I took a sip of coffee, a contented sigh escaping my lips. The world was full of rude, aggressive people who just didn't know how to mind their own business. And sometimes, those people just happened to stumble into the wrong backyard. It was a shame, really. But a man had to eat. And some ingredients were just too good to pass up.
