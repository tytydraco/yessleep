## The Burden of Stories

Between my tiny little flat and my university campus, I didn't spend a lot of time anywhere else. Other than the walk, of course, which ate up an hour and a half when I had classes. I hadn't given the antique shop more than a cursory glance, despite passing it twice a day, nearly every day, for almost three years now.

But today was different. The display had changed, as it did every month, when the shopkeeper decided the tired old trinkets on display weren't going to attract anyone else, I guessed. Usually, it was an incohesive mass of dusty junk, but today was interesting. I stopped, hooking my thumbs into my backpack full of sketchbooks and art supplies, rocking back on my heels to take it all in. 
The display was a testament to adventure and travel. There was an old brass telescope, a sextant, and an exquisite ship-in-a-bottle, along with a compass, made of copper or brass, gleaming like it was brand new on a pillow of purple velvet. It was particularly pretty, and even from here, I saw the ornate needle pointed north, pointing toward me. That was a clever move on the shopkeeper's part. 

Draped over a leather stool were lace opera gloves and an ornate mask that appeared to haved been stolen from a rococo princess' bedchambers. A steamer trunk, battered with time and age, squatted in a corner, the heavily stickered front propped open just enough for more lace and silks to peep out the crack. A tired, dull machete lay, naked tip down, in a corner, along with a necklace that looked like Aztec gold draped around the hilt. 

The university recently announced a Halloween ball, and some of these items would make for interesting costumes. After all, when everyone was a neurotic creative of one brand or another, myself included, it did well to stand out. Everyone was already discussing the ornate masks they would carve or sculpt, the period-correct costumes they could sew. 

I took a special interest in the mask; showing up as someone to make Marie Antoinette scoff at the sheer flamboyance gave my little artist heart joy.
So, I went in, knowing full well I probably couldn't afford anything properly antique. Behind me, the door closed as if on a gentle spring.
"Good afternoon," a woman greeted. She was an antique herself; skin like crepe paper and white-silver hair swept into a style that fell out of favor forty years ago. "Can I interest you in anything?"

"I have a party coming up, and I wanted something unique to wear," I admitted. "I really like the mask in the window."

"Oh, yes, that's a fantastic one. I bought it in Italy some time ago, and finally decided to part ways with it. In fact, most of that display is part of my personal collection." She beamed like accumulating old junk was a crowning achievement, but then again, it was kind of her bread and butter.

My smile, already small, faltered. "That sounds expensive."

"Some, yes. I see you quite often, passing by, but I don't remember you coming in. Students don't usually have a lot of spare money, so maybe we can work something out. Give you a bit of a break for once. You look exhausted, dear."
I was tired, but it was unnerving to know it was visible. 

As she pulled the mask from the display case, she told me about the woman it belonged to. A widely known opera singer, so beloved by her fans that she only wore masks in public so no one would know her true face.

The only one who did know was the mysterious man she fell in love with. He'd been so enamored with her voice that he dared speak to her after a concert, and from that day ,he was hooked. He loved her charm and wit, and even not knowing her face, he was persistent in his courtship. 

She handed me the mask; it was heavier, and more beautiful, than it looked in the window.

 I turned it in my hands. "Oh."

"It always gives more weight to something, when you know the story, doesn't it?" She smiled, cheeks wrinkling.

"Do all these objects have stories?"

"Every one of them. Antique stores are like libraries; full of stories and adventure and mystery, happiness and sadness." She laughed. "I'm a librarian for all the tales that aren’t deemed important enough to write down."

“That’s really kind of charming,” I mused, putting the mask on.

“Darling, you look like you were made for it,” the storekeeper gasped. “But I couldn’t possibly let it go without the compass, you know. They aren’t meant to be separated again.”

“The compass?”

“The one that belonged to the courtier of the opera singer. Oh, yes, she thought it was true love. You can’t keep that apart. Just like you can’t keep an artist from creating.”

“How much for both?” I asked, steeling myself for the hefty sum surely to follow.

“A dollar. But you must return after your party to tell me how it went. That’s my price.”

“Only a dollar?”

“And a story. I like those more, you know.” She smiled, eyes crinkling.

When I was little, my grandmother taught me how to sew. These days, I spent a lot of free time in my flat, sewing things to sell to pay my rent. Because of this, I was in the craft store a lot, and I’d picked up a lot of designer fabric when it went on sale. A particular bolt would match my new acquisitionperfectly, and as I slipped the mask on for inspiration, I knew something great was about to happen.
	
It hit me, like a ravening hunger, a feverish desire to create, to make something worthwhile. Inspiration buzzed through me, sending my brain into overdrive as idea after idea crashed into me in undulating waves.
	
It was a day and a half later when I snapped out of it, when my hunger was finally sated. I sat back, breathing heavily against the wall of my apartment, staring at the sewing mannequin wearing the most elegant ballgown I’d ever seen, all chenille and lace and satin, truly fitting for a rococo princess. Behind the mask, my eyes traveled across my apartment, scattered with page after page of artwork that I didn’t even remember sketching. I had never been sucked into the creative space so deeply and absolutely before. The dress and art appeared as if by magic, but the cuts, charcoal, and callouses on my hands told a different story. I just didn’t remember getting them, which normally would have concerned me, and yes, I did miss a class or two, but everyone needs a mental health day once in a while. Clearly, I needed some time to do what I do best and make something that gave me joy. 

Joy wasn’t quite the right word, though, it didn’t feel full enough. I felt whole, but as soon as I removed the mask, the feeling, ever so slowly, began to dwindle. Maybe I was just too excited about the Halloween party now, and getting to show up in that glorious costume I made myself. I couldn’t wait. The excited buzz still danced over my skin.

I set the mask on my coffee table, alongside the compass, and began counting the days until the dance.
With a week to go, I sat on the sofa, bored with the show I was trying to watch, and got the itch to make something again. The mask seemed to be my lucky charm, so I picked it up and put it back on. Instantly, the hunger returned, that empty void needing to be filled by the act of creation, and I inhaled. Well, perhaps some painting was in order.
I woke up, curled in a painting sheet that was thankfully mostly dry and clean, other than a blue blotch on one corner. I didn’t remember falling asleep, but then again, I didn’t remember painting one, no, two…

I continued counting, nervous sweat beading down my spine. I’d gone through my entire collection of spare canvas, at least a dozen, a bedsheet hung in the living room, and one wall of my dining area. It was all my best work, though, and my heart swelled with confidence and satisfaction. Remembering the mask, I removed it to ensure I hadn’t gotten any paint on it. It was safe, and I laid it back on the table. How long had I painted? How long had I slept? 
The clock on the wall said 7:45, and it was too bright to be evening. Oh good, I hadn’t missed class, even if I had been up half the night.

Or…for two days, if my phone was correct. There was no way. Had I fallen that deeply into my inspiration again? My stomach rumbled as if to fortify the claim. I put off eating to shower, washing the paint that clung to my hands and bare feet, the adrenaline rush wearing off again. Now, I was just tired, but I forced myself to attend class, trying to make sense of what had happened twice now. I’d worked too hard to flunk out, but I couldn’t argue with the results of my creative fugue. 

I did remember small bits, splashes of memory, from my time creating those two occasions. Pricking my thumb on a needle—one of the sketchbook pages was filled with a self-portrait smudged in my own blood—after cutting miles of silk ribbon, pulling out the canvases, being upset when I ran out. But they were just shadows and snippets. Just enough to convince me I wasn’t going insane. But firmly at the root of it all, was the memory of the mask. Maybe the opera singer’s spirit was my new muse? I didn’t know, but though it was a little scary to have so little control over myself once the bug to create bit, it was also exhilarating. I’d felt less burnt out and run-down than I had in months, and it was amazing.

The compass accompanied me in my little clutch to the party. It seemed wrong to leave the courtier at home when the starlet went out. I kept the mask off for a while, allowing myself to get past security before sliding it on and opening the door. Once I entered the gymnasium, the world transformed into a spooky forest of gnarled trees carved out of foam and hanging rubber bats. A fog machine belched green and silver mist over the floor, parting in the wake of my dress.

I forgot to mention that I am not very popular. No one swooped in to meet me, no one called my name from across the room. No one offered to dance with me, or get me a drink. You needed friends for that, and I hadn’t really made any. I’d been too busy, too invested with my studies, too in my own head, I guess, for that. But I’d still wanted to come; Halloween was my favorite holiday, other than perhaps Christmas.

A hollow hunger entered me, starting in the pit of my belly and creeping out, making my skin buzz. I wanted to create, but I wasn’t sure what. There wasn’t anything here I was used to working with. A scratching sound came from my clutch, and in my confusion I was almost afraid I’d open it to find a mouse inside. Purses normally didn’t sound like that.
The sound grew louder when I looked inside, discovering the compass needle spinning wildly. Almost as if realizing it was spotted, the needle snapped in my direction, despite that not being North. Directly at me. I shifted a little on my feet, angling ever so slightly to the right. The needle remained fixed. I exhaled shakily, taking it out. 

A burst of energy rushed through me and into the compass, which swing wildly again before pointing towards the east wall, and the door nestled within it.
Looking around, my heart beat a tattoo against my ribcage. Should I…follow it? In amongst the fog and foam trees, people mingled, but none paid any attention to me. 
	
Why not? What else was there to do when a mysterious compass, received for free from a junk shop, starts moving of its own accord but to follow it, especially on the night the veil between worlds was thinnest? Or that was the story of Samhein, anyway, as far as I remembered. I really wasn’t good at history. Which might not work in my favor if this didn’t end well.
	
Cupping the compass to my chest, I followed it, weaving through the crowd as the needle rocked in the direction of the door. Well, at least it was specific, the direction shifting as I left the gym. The heels of my buckled shoes clicked on the worn tile of the school’s hallway, which was more a ghost town than the spooky forest, no one else here in this wing. The compass led me to the wood shop, where tools and unfinished projects lay strewn over the thick workstations. I still felt inspiration coursing through me, looking for an outlet, but this didn’t feel like my normal kind of medium. I passed the compass over the table, where the needle indicated a sharp knife, probably used for whittling, a handful of nails, and a hammer. I threw them into my clutch, and the compass, satisfied, pointed me in a new direction. My throat felt tight, but my heart still pounded. This was a real adventure, and I had no idea where the compass would lead me next.

	
I was home when rose out of the creative fugue wearing the mask always seemed to inspire me to enter. My muse, the opera starlet, and my finder of inspiration, the courtier, had done me well. I felt…well…good.
	
A newspaper lay on the table, innocently folded to diplay the headline. 
COLLEGE STUDENT FOUND BRUTALLY MURDERED IN SUPPOSED HALLOWEEN SATANIC RITUAL. 
I pulled it closer and skimmed the article. The student, no one I recognized the name of, was found in the woods near the school…nailed to a tree to maintain a pose, skin scribed with intricate scrollwork.
	
“No,” I breathed. I was afraid to look down, to confirm what I feared, my gut writhing. I closed my eyes, then inhaled deeply and reopened them, steeling myself for what I was about to see.
	
My dress, my beautiful dress, was covered in crimson drops and splashes. There was a nail tangled in some ripped lace. I vaguely remembered grabbing the tools off the bench, but after that, my memory was just a blank void.
	
“What did I do?” I breathed, but not before a tingle of memory, of coursing inspiration, of doing my best work no matter what the cost, flowed through me. 

That was what passion felt like, wasn’t it?
