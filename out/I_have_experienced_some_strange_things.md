This is my first time posting here and on Reddit, so excuse me if I did something wrong. I am also using mobile so excuse the bad format.

I know stories here can be fictional, but this are somethings that actually happen to me and are the reason I like to keep the lights on in my house after dark.

I'm 21 years old, and through my life I have experienced some unexplained things, thankfully these have been few but enough to know better than to investigate.

Like just last night, I heard the sounds of cows when I know there aren't anywhere I live. There's goats, sheep, chickens, and rosters, even a few horses, but no cows. The longer I heard them, the more wrong they sounded, deeper and more distorted, thankfully I just fell asleep after awhile.

The second oldest, my brother, only had one experience and that was when we were in school.

The lights all went out in our neighborhood, and my brother was looking out into the foggy night to see if we were the only ones out with power, and if we were that means the switches just went out and we can get our power working again. I don't remember what I was doing but I heard him call my name and I came over to where he was.

He pointed out to one of our cars and told me he saw something run behind it, I told him it was probably one of the neighbor's dogs but he argued saying it looked like a small person walking on all fours.

We got scared but eventually forgot about it.

Another time was in my last year of highschool, I went outside in the night with my dog, I don't recall why, all I know is that I had been hearing music on my headphones but I turned off the moment I stepped outside. This was because if I heard something I would immediately run back inside.

Then I heard it, it was like a woman singing but also slightly broken it a way, like those when you play a vinyl and it skips. I first thought it wasy headphones and figured I didn't turned off the music but when I put them on and grabbed my phone to check, no music was playing and no sound was coming out of my headphones.

Of course, I freaked out, grabbed my dog and ran back inside telling my mom what had happened. I wasn't allowed to go out at dark alone anymore.

More stuff like this happened, occasionally at 3 to 4 A.M. I would hear a woman screaming off in the distance and it always ended at exactly 5 A.M.

One time I heard the screaming right next to my house, but it was just for a second and that scared me enough to run straight to my mom's room. Mind you I was a teenager when that happened, and I don't care how much you judge or make fun of me for it, I was not going to sleep alone for that night.

I did woke up my mom up during when the screaming happened but she told me just go back to bed where it's safe and she can keep an eye on me incase something happened.

There was also the strange whistling that happened during the more windy nights, like always I thought it was just the wind but the whistling always stopped when it got to the other side of our house.

Thes happenind in the morning when we were just coming home from work.

To keep it short, my mom and I were checking out a house for sell, it was old but it wasn't creepy old like you see in horror movies. It was a nice house, needed a bit of fixing but still very lovely, at the back there's a porch with stairs that lead up to the balcony on the second floor. We go up and look around for a bit, that's when I get this weird feeling that something might pop out and try to scare me.

After I said something about the floor needing to be fix, that's when I heard a loud siren, before it just cut off after a few seconds.

Like an actual emergency siren, loud enough that you'd think the moment you turned to where you think it came from the source would be right next to property. Not gonna lie, my thoughts immediately turned to Siren Head and expected to see it coming running towards us.

There was just woods surrounding this house and the balcony was place high enough to clearly see the surrounding property, so there was just trees everywhere and nothing that could give a source of where that sound came from.

My mom however told me she heard a woman laughing, in a malicious way but didn't hear the siren. We stayed around a bit more before we quickly left the property and never came back to it.

I know there will be some people asking why not go and investigate? Why not get proof this is actually happening? Why not record it? Take pictures?

Well for one, I am not ending my life short just to get people to believe me. And the times I actually did try, it never could be heard in the recordings, perhaps because I was too scared to go any closer which means leaving the safety of my porch.

I posted this because perhaps you might find it interesting to know some of this stuff or probably not and I just bored you. Again this are all real life experiences, I still have a couple more stories, and one that happened in a hiking trail in the middle of the woods at night because for some reason we wanted to be teenagers in a horror movie cliche, if anyone is interested.
