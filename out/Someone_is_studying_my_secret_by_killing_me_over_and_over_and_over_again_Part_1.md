“Rise and shine, Mike.”  


  
The mere sound of such a familiar expression, uttered by a stranger’s voice, was more than enough to jar me from my slumbers.  


  
“No time for sleeping in,” the man continued. “We’ve got a long road ahead of us.” There was something off about his voice, as if muffled by something.  


  
By the time I was able to clear the crust from my eyes, he had already started pacing around the room in front of me, his body hidden in shadow.  


  
“Where am I?” I muttered, still groggy from what felt like the deepest sleep I’d ever slept. I tried to remember how I could have ended up here, but my memory seemed to escape me.  


  
Eyes fully open now, I scanned the room to find just that. A room. Nothing more, nothing less.  


  
“What is this place?” I asked the mysterious figure.  


  
“Should we start from the beginning?” He continued, stepping out of the darkness and taking a seat in a metal chair that stood in the center of the room, directly under an overhead light.  


  
He was wearing what looked like a hazmat suit, made of plastic, or rubber, with gloves, and a mask that obscured everything but his eyes. Cold, blue eyes.  


  
“Beginning?” I replied.  


  
“Why’d you go through with it, Mike?”  


  
“I’m sorry? Go through with what?”  


  
“What you did to yourself. There.” He said, pointing down to my arms.  


  
I followed his gesture to my wrists, where I spotted two large bandages, each taped to an arm. This… I remembered.  


  
The recollection jarred my memory back to Elise. *Elise. Where’s Elise?* I wondered.  


  
“Tell me, Mike.”  


  
“I… don’t know. I guess… after Elise left, I just wanted to end it all. I didn’t have the strength to start over again. I don’t know why I-”  


  
“Hey, easy there, Mike. Easy. No need to get sentimental. It’s a time for celebration.” The man reassured me, calmly.   


  
He pulled his metal chair closer, leaning in with an eerie smile that I couldn’t see behind the mask, but knew was lurking behind it. “You succeeded. At least at the first part.”  


  
“But you said the first was… ending it all?” I asked.  


  
“Correct, which you… succeeded at.”  


  
“I don’t understand.”  


  
“We didn’t think you would.”  


  
“We?”  


  
It was at that moment that my eyes went back to the room. It was just a room, yes, but there was something slightly off about it.  


  
That’s when it hit me. The walls. The walls were lined with something. Curtains of sorts. Were they plastic? It was too dark to tell.  


  
“Nevermind the we. You fancy yourself much of a gamer, Mike?” The man asked.  


  
“Huh? I mean, not really? Can you just tell me what’s going on?”  


  
“But you do know what the restart button is, right, Mike? The one on the console that lets you start the game over, from the beginning, after you die?”  


  
“Yeah… I’m sorry, what does this have to do with anything?”  


  
He stood up and walked over to the corner of the room, once again shrouded in shadow.  


  
“Well, for ordinary people, Mike. When they play the game, and they die, they can’t start over. Their consoles… well, they don’t have restart buttons. They have one shot. One, sad little shot at beating the game, or whatever beating the game means to them. And when they die, it’s over. Forever. But you, Mike. You’re special. ‘Cause you get to play the game again.”  


  
The man walked over to what I, upon squinting, realized was a large, metal door. He knocked on it four times, paused, and then a fifth.   


  
A few moments later, the door opened. The man reached out into what appeared to be a hallway, grabbed something, and stepped back inside, the heavy door slamming behind him.  


  
“Wait, are you saying that I tried to kill myself, and survived?” I was still trying to wrap my mind around what he was implying.  


  
“No.” He called out. “I’m saying that you succeeded in killing yourself, and survived. And we’re here to understand how, exactly, that’s possible.”  


  
“And how… do you plan on doing that?”  


  
“I mean, Mike, look around you. How dull can you possibly fucking be?”  


  
“I don’t understand.”  


  
Stepping back into the light, he held up a large syringe, droplets falling from its needle and splashing onto the concrete floor below him.  


  
“By killing you, Mike. Over. And over. And over again. Until we understand, how that restart button of yours works.”  


  
I hopped up and darted for the far wall. “Can we please just talk about this!”  


  
But before I could even attempt to talk any sense into him, he had already lunged at me, tackled me to the floor, and jammed the syringe deep into my neck.  


  
“No!” I gasped, clutching my neck, as he withdrew the needle.  


  
I lay there, writhing in pain, foam pouring from my mouth, as I saw his boots slowly step away.  


  
And then… darkness.  


  
—  


  
“Rise and shine, Mike.”
