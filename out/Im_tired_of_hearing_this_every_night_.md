It started with a simple Craigslist ad. "Vintage Writing Desk for Sale. $50 OBO." As a freelance writer, I thought a nice, old desk might spark some creativity. The ad included a phone number, so I called.

An elderly woman answered, her voice quivering. She sounded relieved when I told her I was interested and invited me to her house the next day. The address she gave me was on the outskirts of town, in a neighborhood I wasn’t familiar with.

The next day, I arrived at the address. It was a large, Victorian house that had seen better days. The lawn was overgrown, and the paint was peeling. I knocked on the door, and after a few moments, the same elderly woman from the phone opened it. She looked frail and tired, but she smiled warmly.

She led me to the attic, where the desk was stored. The attic was cluttered with old furniture and boxes. The desk was beautiful, intricately carved, and despite its age, well-preserved. It seemed like a steal for $50.

As I was loading the desk into my car, the woman seemed hesitant. She looked at me and said, “There’s something you should know about the desk. It belonged to my late husband. He was a writer too. He spent countless hours at that desk. Sometimes I still hear him typing at night.”

I brushed off her comment as the ramblings of an old woman living alone. After paying her, I drove home with my new desk, excited to set it up in my office.

That night, I decided to work late. The desk fit perfectly in the corner of my room. As I settled in, I felt a strange sense of comfort, like the desk belonged there.

Around midnight, I heard a faint tapping sound. I paused, thinking it was just the house settling. But the tapping grew louder, more insistent. It sounded like typing. I looked around the room, but there was nothing that could be making the noise. I brushed it off and continued working.

Over the next few days, the typing continued every night at midnight. I started feeling uneasy, but I convinced myself it was just my imagination. Then, one night, I woke up to find my laptop open on the desk. A new document was on the screen, with words typed out: “Help me.”

Terrified, I deleted the document and tried to ignore it. But the next night, the message was there again. This time it said, “I can see you.”

Panicked, I called the elderly woman. Her phone was disconnected. I drove back to her house, but when I arrived, it was abandoned, boarded up, and looked like it had been for years. The neighbors told me no one had lived there for decades.

I returned home, determined to get rid of the desk. But when I tried to move it, it wouldn’t budge, as if it were bolted to the floor. That night, the typing was louder than ever. The message on my laptop read, “You can’t escape.”

Desperate, I smashed the desk to pieces and set it on fire in my backyard. As the flames consumed it, I heard a piercing scream. Then, everything went silent.

The next day, I thought it was over. But when I sat down to write, my laptop opened to a new document. The words appeared slowly on the screen: “Why did you do that?”

I moved out the next week. But no matter where I go, every night at midnight, I still hear the typing.
