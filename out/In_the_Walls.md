It’s only been a few weeks since I moved to this place. I’m already regretting it. I think I’m going insane. The walls… they’re talking to me. I should’ve listened to my sister and given this place up for sale. It’s in the middle of nowhere, in a dilapidated condition, far from civilisation.

I thought I could fix up the shack and earn a profit on the margin. But things have been really weird these few days. It started with the tapping. At first, I ignored the strange din – I tried to, I really did.

I worked my fingers to the bone trying to make this place work. My debt was piling up. I was too deep into the mud to just succumb to my inane fears. Then again, how could I know what awaited me? I was only human, made of dirt, composed of skin and bones.

A hole in the peeling wall kept bothering me. It wasn’t there when I first moved in. It gradually grew bigger. A perfect circle. It would be a lie if I told you I hadn’t considered tearing down the wall. But I couldn’t. I tried. Whenever I made up my mind, something beyond that wall fixed its eyes on me. Through that hole. That massive black hole that beckoned me to challenge it.

The whispers were what really got to me. Man, that shit broke me. It was… How do I put this without sounding crazy? Whatever it was, that thing, it knew me. I had these dreams, nightmares if you will, about these strange-ass people I had never met before. What did they say again? Oh, right: “We come from the walls.”

My sister wouldn’t pick up her phone! I sent a message three days ago! I told her I was scared. That something about this place was off. I’ve been staring at the black screen for hours, waiting, as the hole kept getting bigger. The whispers were louder now. I stopped sleeping. Hell, did I even breathe?

Eyes. Several of them. Packed into that fucking hole! They talked with their eyes. Through that hole. Trapped behind the crumbling walls. Coming for me. I just knew it, I… Oh, god! Oh, god! I missed Denise. I promised I’d buy her that doll on her sixth birthday and now I was…

I shouldn’t have come here. What were they gonna tell her? That- that—I recoiled. Crawling back, towards the locked front door, a decaying hand stretched out from within the hole. I clutched to the door. The people in the walls escaped. *Shit!* I- I was going to die! I- I didn’t… Oh, god! No! No! I didn’t… I don’t want to die here! Oh, god! Please, I…

Hundreds of hands ripped my face off.

When I flew my eyes open, the mouldering hands and the blinking eyes enclosed me from all directions, surrounded by profound darkness. A single string of light shone through the narrowing hole. In the walls.
