Hey r/nosleep,

This might be the most disturbing thing I’ve ever stumbled upon, and I need to share it with someone who might understand. Last weekend, I found a diary hidden inside a secret compartment of an old desk I bought at an estate sale.

The entries inside are horrifyingly detailed, describing gruesome murders that span days. The first entry I read shook me to my core: 

“Day one: I captured her just before dusk, the struggle vibrant and intoxicating. Her terror was palpable, the sweat mixing with the tears on her cheeks. She fought bravely, but it was futile. I brought her to my prepared place, an old shed deep in the woods, where no one would hear us. I tied her to an old chair, her arms and legs bound tightly with rough rope that cut into her skin whenever she moved.”

“Day two: I began with small cuts, superficial but numerous, across her arms and legs, the kind that sting sharply but are not life-threatening. Each whimper she made was a symphony to my ears. I used a scalpel, the blade sharp and precise, making sure to clean the wounds to prevent early infection. Hydration was minimal, just enough to keep her conscious, to experience every moment of her slow demise.”

“Day three: I increased the severity of her wounds, cutting deeper, exploring the textures of her muscles and sinews. The smell of iron filled the air, her blood a vibrant contrast against the sterile white of the shed. I documented her fading vitality, noting how her eyes began to lose their shine, her screams turned to whimpers, and eventually, she could only produce a gurgling noise as her body gave up.”

Horrified but needing to know more, I checked the local unsolved cases and there it was—a woman had been found just as described, her body abandoned in a shed in the woods, the case still open and cold.

I couldn’t stop there. I read another entry:

“Day one: He was an easy target, alone at a late showing in an old cinema. I watched him from the shadows, calculating. When he left for the restroom, I followed, injecting him with a sedative I had prepared. He collapsed, unconscious, easy to drag into my waiting van.”

“Day two: In my soundproof basement, I hung him from the ceiling by his wrists. His awakening was met with the harsh reality of his situation. I used a variety of tools, pliers to remove nails, a hammer to break fingers. His cries filled the room, a desperate plea for mercy that would not come.”

“Day three: Exhaustion had set in, his body weak from pain and blood loss. I carved words into his chest, a message to those who would find him, my signature. By nightfall, he was no longer responsive, his life extinguished under the cold glare of my surgical lights.”

Again, the details matched a man found in similar circumstances, his body discovered in an abandoned building downtown, his injuries a mirror of the diary’s descriptions.

Tonight, I’m going to read another entry. I'm terrified of what I’ll find, but I feel compelled to continue.
