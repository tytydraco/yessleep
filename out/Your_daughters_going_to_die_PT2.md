Charlotte Stubbins. That's her name.  

It didn't take much digging to find out who she was. All I had to do was ask Jerry if I could see the security footage of the night since I 'left my phone somewhere!'. Then a quick screenshot of her face and a reverse image search later and voila her name! Got to love the internet.

She's a smart woman, some PhD in microbiology or something fancy like that. Seemed to be a pretty avid researcher too, lots of papers published.

Do smart people go crazy? 

Regardless of whether or not she was crazy, I had to go visit. Look, I know what you're thinking: don't chase the crazy woman, go be with your daughter! I have. I was with Ellie the entire night. She's not going to get better. I don't want to just sit around and hope she recovers. I need to do something. Even if it's borderline insane. 

I waited till Tommy ended his shift at the precinct and then went over to pay the bail. I said I was her cousin. Luckily, Hendricks is too old to really give too many shits about paperwork or ID. Her bail wasn't cheap. $1000 is a pretty penny. I had to ask *them* for the money. You'd think when your estranged daughter calls you, you'd have the decency to pick up the phone but nope call didn't even make it past the secretary. 

I waited outside the precinct for Charlotte to come out. She seemed calm when she walked out, a far cry from the nearly rabid woman I'd seen before. 

'**Didn't know I had a cousin named Audrey.'**

**'That's an odd way of saying thanks to the woman who paid your bail.'**

**'My bad. I'm so so so so thankful for your generosity. How ever can I repay you?'** 

**'You could start by telling me why you were screaming about my daughter dying'**

**'Don't know what your talking about',** she said, walking away. My calm exterior wavered as desperation crept into my voice. 

**'Please. She's sick in the hospital and I don't know what to do.' Her eyes remained cold as she responded:**

**'I was tripping on acid. Nothing more. I'd appreciate if you forgot about my trip since I'm definitely trying to.'**

**'Please. I'm begging you. Her name is Ella Aetheridge. She's 11 years old and she loves playing soccer and she's doing great in school and she's full of life and...'**

**'Stop. stop. stop. Aetheridge you say? like the biotech company. No wonder you paid the bail so easily, mommy and daddy probably let you dip into your trust fund.'**

I prickled as she mentioned the 'trust fund'. 'Mommy and Daddy' really wouldn't like me telling other people me and Ella are associated with them but whatever. 

**'I still have tons of connections with the firm if that's what you're looking for'** 

She turned her head in contemplation. **'That would be exactly what I need actually. We can't speak her because** ***they*** **could be watching but tell you what come to this address at 10 and we can reach an agreement'.** She handed me a business card as she walked away. 

What a weirdo.

Nonetheless, I wasn't going to lose the opportunity to speak with her so at 9:30, I was sitting in the fiat armed , ready to drive off. Was it a bit of an overreaction to arm myself before going? Yes but the woman was crazy and when Ella recovers I don't think she'd want to wake up just to find out that her mother's trapped in a serial killers basement.

The address was just a normal, white picked suburban house. Not exactly the rotting hut in the middle of the woods I was picturing. I rang the doorbell and Charlotte picked up.

**'Come in'**

The inside of the house was dirty. Not like a hoarder house but more like a cheap motel type dirty. Stained curtains. Dirty couch cushions. A fraying rug. 

**'Cut to the chase. What do you want and what happened to my daughter'** 

The knowing look in her eyes gave it away. She knew what happened to my Ella.

**'Well, All I want is for you to give me some information on someone who worked there. Is that easy enough?'** 

**'Sounds like a plan',** I said wearily.

**'Well to explain what happened to your daughter, we're going to have to do a quick little bio lesson.',** she said with a grin on her face.

I'm going to punch her.

**'Animals',** she continued unaware or ignoring the I'm-going-to-strangle you expression I had, '**have three main types of relationships :** 

**mutualism where both are happy, commensalism where one is happy and the other is unaffected, and parasitism where one is happy and the other is harmed. Those relationships are all well-known but pretty much no one knows about the fourth'** 

My mouth felt like sandpaper as she continued her tirade.

**'The scientific word for it is soma-shift. I like to call it skin-stealing. It occurs when one organism destroys another's mind completely. Emotions, values, personality, the very soul of a being all gone.'** 

She made a 'poof' motion with her hands.

**'Every being gives out a unique type of signal. I'm one of the very few humans blessed with the ability to detect it when a being's signal changes, I know soma-shift has occurred. It's a fascinating process, really. The memories of the person stay, the knowledge they gained stay but the very essence of who you are: your consciousness, your love for others are all snuffed out.** 

**On a microscopic level, it's equally incredible. The brain rewires itself to match the parasites. Your genes stay the same but the brain begins to shift as the skin-stealer takes over slowly erasing yourself and replacing it with another consciousness. Think of it like using the same computer with all the same files and applications but changing the user. This of course is difficult for the brain to process so the host gets very sick, seizures and bleeding are all very common as the body tries to fight off the parasite. Not to mention, the host begins to lose memories as some of the rewiring goes astray. '** 

This can't be real. She has to be crazy right? There's no way this is real. This is a crazy woman and I'm crazy enough to actually believe her. 

**'At the coffee shop, I began to feel your daughter signal wane. I thought it was nothing at first since it's insanely rare for someone so young to undergo soma-shift. To put it into perspective only like 5% of cases I've observed have happened to people under 35. More developed brains are more attractive.'**

**'what happens next?',** I answered back as if in a trance. 

**'Well, if your daughter wakes up. It's not going to be her behind the wheel.'** 

'**You're lying',** I responded back.

**'You and I both know that's not true. I don't know how to save your daughter but someone else might. I need your contacts at the firm to find her.'** 

**'Or you could believe I've lost it and let your daughter get taken over. Choice is up to you.'**
