Hello there my name is Brook Simone, I was told this was the site my son used before he disappeared. I have read his story and what he experienced during the nights. I...I should have known this would happen, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN DAMN IT.  I...I knew about the visitor I knew about EVERYTHING. It's just that I thought since I survived, I thought it won't go after me or my family ever again.

Oh right, sorry you must be confused. You might have some questions about what happened to me in the past or just what the visitor is. It might not be the right time for explanations but you should know as well.

lets start off with me back when I was in college back before my ....son..... was even born back when I used to live in the same apartment my son also lived in.

I was a "tech wiz" or what people call those who invents and discover new things. I may not be the smartest of the bunch but my friend tells me I was the brightest and most innovative in our class. In pre-school, I wasn't the one who can answer instantly when a teacher asked a question, I was the one who sits in the back building car engines using lego pieces.

As time went by, I began to have an interest to the supernatural. In college, I stopped inventing things and started doing research to anomalies and such. I was so intrigued in the stories of fictional monsters and gods to the point where It became my life's goal to encounter one. Boy, what a dumb dream that.  


It all started when I found a peculiar book under one of the bookshelves in the library I go to when I study, it looked like it sat there for hundreds of years. As one might expect, the book was covered in dust and cobwebs, I blew on it scattering all the dust away from the book making a cloud of dust in the air. I stupidly inhaled some dust and made me cough a bit, after that I looked back at the book. The book was covered in leather, I don't which animal was it from though. It also had a bunch of weird symbols written in its spine. In the front the title wrote " o le  aon  quod  daxil oldu  o le dii". It took a while to translate it since each words were in a different language but it might have said "the one that entered the gods" or "...entered the realm of the gods". I don't know I only remembered it vividly since it was years ago.

If I remember correctly the story was about a being that transcended all logic, speaks in actual contradiction, like it speaks about it being a dog but it's next sentence stated that in fact it was a cat. I don't know, reading it's story really made me run for my money as it was very difficult to read sentences with each word being in a different language some I don't even think is from this world.

The book talked about the being named  **Philoxenus.** though not human It was a but a normal being, living and surviving day in day out. The book stated that Philoxenus existed before man, before life on earth, it also stated that it lived when the earth did not have a proper barrier from the heat rays of the sun making it dangerous for life to flourish in the planet, but of course Philoxenus defied the law and existed in small patch land where it stayed lying there dormant not being able to move to the intense heat of the sun. It stayed stationary for millions of years until the ozone layer was finally formed. In which case it finally regained it's conscience.

It's awakening shook the earth which made a volcano to erupt under the sea and formed an island. Seeing its new creation Philoxenus wanted more, it wanted to know the limit of what it could do.  while it was on it's vegetable state before the ozone layer formed, Philoxenus had a dream, it dreamt of reaching the heavens, the sky the it looked at for millions of years waiting to get up. It jumped as high as it can shaking the very earth as he past through the moon, maars, and even the sun. It jumped so high it reached the void, a place between galaxies, a place where nothing exists, a place where no light, no life, and no planets.

Philoxenus questioned where it was, with no sense as to what direction it came from, it continued exploring the vast emptiness of the void. Hundreds of years has passed, still no sign of life, Philoxenus was big but the void was larger... much.....much larger. Philoxenus wanted to see something again, it wanted to see light, and life again. It has spent many years wishing to go back home, wishing to find a place to stay, wishing to find sanctuary, wishing to **VISIT** the place where it could finally fulfil it's goal of reaching the heavens. Hundreds of years passed by more, hope was fleeting, It did not know what to do, it had been floating in an endless void for many centuries. Until finally it saw light.

It finally found what it was looking for, the heavens the realm of the gods, in front of it was a door, a gigantic door bigger than the sun itself. Philoxenus clenched its fist winds up its arms preparing to **KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK** the knocking echoes through space and time, one so loud it penetrated the vacuum of space. The door then opens revealing a very bright light and in that light came out something Philoxenus did not expect.

An entity of pure light with wings bigger than planets, eyes that are impossible to count, a being so mystical, it temporarily blinded Philoxenus due to it's unfathomable features.   


it then spoke:  
"be not afraid for I am a seraph of God"  


Philoxenus:  
"seraph? God? what's that?"

&#x200B;

the seraph ignored Philoxenus' question and said something that would change Philoxenus life for the worst.  


Seraph:

"child, thou are not meant to be here, thou must go back from whence thou came"  


Philoxenus rightfully enraged from what he had heard;

"WHAT? what do you mean I need to go back? I suffered HUNDREDS of nothingness just to get here and you want me to go back? DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IV-"

&#x200B;

The seraph:   
"DO NOT QUESTION THE WORD OF GOD"

&#x200B;

it's wings with impossible size and numbers started to move and flapped once. With that one single flap of it's wings. Made Philoxenus fly away with incredible speed. within seconds it arrived from the same place where it left, earth. fueled by rage, it's muscles tensed up so hard it's body emitted smoke. it's body then became so small it looked entirely different from what it originally look. It became skin and bones, its once might flesh turned to what you might think is it robes like a witch in a cartoon.

with one final fuel of rage it shouted "CURSE YOU AND YOUR CREATION! I WILL TAKE EVERYTHING FROM YOU! YOU AND YOUR AVATARS! YOU SHALL SEE MY WRATH'' 

Philoxenus then vanishes to the shadows never to be seen again.

&#x200B;

well folks, that's about what I remembered in the book since the last few pages was complete gibberish and I could not decrypt any words from them. I do not know what it meant by "avatars" and how it correlates to it's **visits** If I knew I would have told you sooner. But for now let us end it here. next part will be about my encounter with **THE VISITOR.**
