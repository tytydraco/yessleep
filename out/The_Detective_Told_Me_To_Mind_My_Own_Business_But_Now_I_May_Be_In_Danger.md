I quit my job as a public defender a couple of years ago, because I met a client, let’s call him Isaac, whose case made me question my own sanity.

Now, after all this time, I need to share his story. People may be in danger, including myself. Or perhaps I'm freaking out over nothing. I hope so.

When we first met, I had Isaac write down his version of events in as much detail as possible. What follows is his account.

\-

About five months ago, I woke up one morning with a persistent itch under my right eye. When I looked in the mirror, I found a red mark on my eyelid and thought maybe I’d scratched myself during one of my stress dreams. I didn’t think much of it, but then it started to look infected. Every day for weeks I would take stock of the blemish in the mirror; every day it would get nastier. Kept telling myself it would probably heal on its own while it grew into a yellowish lump the size of a grape. Looked at all kinds of horrors on WebMD, but I couldn’t figure out what it was. I felt it when I blinked.

That’s when business started to dry up. I’d been flipping cars on Craigslist with my buddy Lucas. He had the mechanical know-how and handled logistics, while I’d go out and work my charm, make deals. It’s important not to look like a skeezebag in that line of work and suddenly I couldn’t unload this Nissan Altima on anybody. People looked at me different. Got skittish.

Lucas stopped returning my texts. The gall of the man. He lived in the apartment directly below mine. I could hear his life: his shouting matches with his girlfriend Polly, his toddler Ophelia throwing fits, his Doberman barking at nothing. We would have a relationship whether he liked it or not.

Even the old, gray cat stopped coming around. I called him Gravy. He was a long-haired fella that would waltz into my place through the window above the fire escape. I lived on the 4^(th) floor. I’d feed him licks of vanilla ice cream during that sweltering summer. He probably belonged to somebody. I had to wonder if he stopped returning because of my face.

And yeah, I must admit, I was nearly dead broke after making a few bad bets on DraftKings. Couldn’t make rent or my phone bill. So that’s why I never made a doctor’s appointment. Knew in the back of my mind that if things got desperate, I would have to go to the pawn shop to loan my prized Rolex. Again. It was my only real asset. I slept with it on.

And finally, the wasp appeared. It got stuck inside the dome of the light fixture above my bed. Didn’t know that was possible. With the light on, I could see it’s body in silhouette, it’s big ass stinger. It bounced around, tapping the glass when I tried to sleep. And that was the night I started to lose it. Like goddamn, why me? There’s always some bullshit. Can’t catch a goddamn break. All these little indignities had piled up and now I had this wellspring of venom spilling out of me. Paced around cursing, checking the mirror over and over, looking at my ugly mug, rapping my knuckles on my head, turning the light on and off, watching the wasp crawl in its cage.

The next morning, I went to Lucas’s to confront him. The dog went nuts as soon as I knocked, and when Lucas answered with Ophelia on his hip, she started scream-crying at the sight of me.

Polly dragged the dog and kid away and I was pissed. And when I get pissed, I get to ranting, and I ranted about all this stuff—the wasp, the cat, his dog, my face, him ghosting me, DraftKings—and the whole time he couldn’t look me in the eye. He constantly sniffled and rubbed his nose, this nervous tick—made him look pathetic. I couldn’t fathom how he’d get along without me.

To my surprise, he cut me off and said, “Isaac, I’m not giving you money, man. And you know why.”

He knew I would ask. Then he looked at my blemish and his expression flickered. Seemed he was cycling through several emotions. I read them as queasiness, worry, and then contempt.

He sniffed and said, “I can see you’re in trouble. Go see Sylvia in 205. She’ll help.”

No other explanation. He shut the door in my stunned face.

Well, I assumed it was about my skin problem, and he just didn’t want to say it. So, I moseyed down to 205, knocked, and this tiny, wrinkled woman, maybe 80 years old, let me in. She was a hoarder. The place was cluttered with potted plants, newspapers, and all kinds of knick-knacks and pieces of junk. I remember lamps made from blown glass. Jewelry and letters strewn on the coffee table along with a fancy letter opener. A metal ring puzzle. Family photos and abstract paintings covering the walls from floor to ceiling. A bowling trophy. A marble bust. Fine China displayed in a cabinet. A PhD placard for folklore studies. A dog bone. A dreamcatcher in the window.

She shuffled over and sat cross-legged on the floor. By the way she dressed, wearing this red, silky robe thing and feather earrings, she seemed a bit new-agey. I figured she’d give me a salve made from tree bark or some shit. When you’re in a crisis, you start to look everywhere for a solution, even towards mumbo jumbo. But she didn’t say a thing for the longest time, so I filled the dead air with my rant again.

She finally said in her croaky old woman voice, “give me the wasp.”

“What do you mean?”

“Give me the wasp.”

We stared at each other for a long moment. It seemed like her eyes pointed in two different directions, just slightly.

“I thought you would help with my whole facial issue,” I said. 

“Give me the wasp.”

I couldn’t pry anything else out of her. She just repeated it over and over, and I was fuming, like is this a joke? Does she have dementia? Eventually, I zipped out of there and my spite carried me back to my apartment. I unscrewed the light fixture and after stalking it for two minutes, captured the wasp in a Tupperware container. Then I returned to old Sylvia.

She didn’t say shit as I brandished the container at her. So, I opened it. Let the wasp float out into her place.

“There’s your wasp.”

No reaction. She only stared at me. Not so much as a shadow of an expression. I left with my fury peaking and simmering down into this cold nothing.

A day later, I went out to the pawnshop to loan out my precious watch. But when a got to the parking lot, I spotted a glint on the pavement—a diamond ring. I hurried and pawned it for $800. Later, I won $1000 on DraftKings. And over the next couple days the gnarly spot on my face began to clear up.  It receded back into a small red dot, though it still itched a bit. I paid rent and sold the Nissan. Couldn’t help but connect my strange interaction with Sylvia to my turn of luck.

I enjoyed a week of normalcy before the spot returned with a vengeance. But not a lump this time. It quickly spread out into a flat, yellow-brown splotch, like a bruise on an apple. One morning I poked the flesh with my pinky, and I can only describe it now as *too soft*. My finger left an impression that lingered like memory foam. Almost threw up right then. Decided to go to urgent care. But my keys were missing. In a nauseous panic, I tore up my whole apartment, my closet, my dresser, and the furniture. What did I find? One: a couple of mysterious blood stains on the carpet that I’d never noticed before—small and round. Two: Fat cockroaches in the couch cushions.

And I thought of Sylvia, sitting there in the corner of my mind, expressionless. Couldn’t dislodge her. I thought maybe I would apologize for the wasp… to cover my bases. Realign my karma. I was a bit dizzy. I clenched my teeth and went down to apartment 205. Again, she let me in and sat on the rug; again, I filled the silence, rambling about my problems.

She said, “bring me the cockroaches.”

“What’s your deal?”

“Bring me the cockroaches.”

“Are you all right?” I raised my voice at her.

“Bring me the cockroaches.”

And on and on.

What can I say? They were harder to capture than the wasp, but I corralled two cockroaches in the Tupperware container and returned to Sylvia. This time, I knelt, sort of bowed to her, and placed the container at her feet. Thought I was making peace with her. Caught a whiff of her—earthy. She had fuzz on her upper lip, liver spots. She breathed long and deep through her nose. Had this reptilian stillness. Her eyes—just a bit bloodshot in the corners—they followed my movements, but only after a short delay. Like when I stood back up, they looked into the empty space before flicking up at me. Didn’t blink. It occurred to me that she was in some kind of meditative state. 

I walked to the door and when I turned to say goodbye, her mouth hung open, yellow teeth on display, a glisten on her lips, maybe saliva. At this point, this dread congealed in me. Left feeling weak.

I decided to walk the 4 miles to urgent care. Clear my head and get some fresh air. By the time anybody would see me they looked at me like I was a moron because the thing on my face had gone back to a somewhat normal color and reduced dramatically in size. Looked like a standard bruise. They told me to see a dermatologist.

And over the next few weeks, I watched the blemish shrink back into a red speck. Almost didn’t want it to happen because…it just wasn’t normal. I was stuck in this psychedelic headspace, checking the mirror every two minutes. After staring into the mirror for a while my vision would go blurry and I’d think it was there again. I couldn’t bottle my nerves.

One evening I went over and knocked on Lucas’s door, but he wouldn’t answer.

Started slamming on his door and yelling, “What’s with Sylvia, bro? Answer me.” No response, but I heard Ophelia crying, so I knew he was there.  

I banged on the door, hard. “Some weird shit’s going on and I’m not having it anymore.” I stood there listening for a long while. Once Ophelia stopped crying there was silence.

I won something like $4,000 on the sportsbook apps. Never found my keys. And the roach infestation was gone.

The whole time slack-jawed Sylvia was there in the back of my mind watching my life. Had an appointment with a dermatologist scheduled in a couple goddamn months. I prayed to God that this was just a weird episode, and things could go back to normal.

No. A few days later, I woke up at 3:00am with my face itching. Something smelled like sweaty feet and my skin was wet. Checked the mirror, and my stomach dropped. Pus leaked out this wound, a hole in my eyelid. And, I thought, maybe, I could see a bit of white. The white of my eyeball through the hole.

I puked into the sink. Turned away spitting, couldn’t look at it again. It was my face. I was losing my mind. I wanted to go back to urgent care, but I couldn’t find my phone or shoes. Looked everywhere.

Ran out of the apartment in a panic. Started knocking on doors.

“I need help.” Yelling, moaning. “Someone call me an ambulance.” Nobody answered. Knocked on all the doors on my floor. “Where the fuck is everybody?” Not a peep.

Went back into my apartment and slumped onto the couch. Noticed drops of dried blood scattered all over the carpet. Sat for a long time waiting for something to happen. Maybe for the police to show up. Tried to calm down. Tried to tell myself that I wasn’t dying. Went to the fridge, but my damn ice cream was missing. Blood drops on the linoleum, too. Grabbed a bottle of Jameson and drank until I got really tired. This confusion hit me. Dissociative. Almost didn’t know where I was. Heart went crazy. There’s nothing else like it, the feeling that you’re having a psychotic break. It’s damnation.

Sylvia was out there, watching me through the cement and drywall. This rage, directed at her, started building in me. Rage was better than the confusion. I Prowled around, bouncing off the walls until the inertia propelled me out the door. I took the bottle with me down to 205.

Banged on her door. When Sylvia opened it, I raved at her. I said that I wanted out. No more. Demanded she give my shoes back. I think I threatened to, you know, kill her.

She didn’t flinch. Just shuffled back to her spot on the carpet and said something I couldn’t hear. So, I stepped closer, into the apartment. The place smelled like cooked porkchops.

“Give me the watch.”

I hesitated.

“Give me the watch.”

I realized then I was a coward. I guess I sort of always knew in the back of my head.

“Please, just leave me the hell alone.” I flung the Rolex into her lap and left. Stumbled back to my apartment and drank until I fell asleep.

Spent maybe four weeks, the longest period yet, watching the thing heal. The hole disappeared and the blemish shrank down into the red dot. But it still itched. I still didn’t have my phone, shoes, or keys. I only left my apartment to go to the corner store to buy ice cream, Oreos, Jameson, and like a thousand scratchers. Won nearly $10,000. Counted the days until my dermatologist appointment.

Woke up one morning to the smell of rot. Gathered my courage to look in the mirror. The bottom half of my eye was exposed. Lower eyelid gone, with the area around it necrotic black. My first reaction was to put my hand over it, because I thought it would fall out. I felt the wetness and I fainted.

When I came to, I crawled into the living room. Gravy the cat stood perched on the fire escape. I coaxed him into my arms with a spoonful of ice cream. He purred and I wept as I cradled him. Soft friendly guy. 

Sylvia was out there in her apartment, as still as a lizard, watching me. And I knew she was saying, “bring me the cat.”

I went slow. Could barely walk straight. Took the stairs one at time and thought, like, oh God, what will happen to Gravy when I give him to Sylvia? Every step I would pause and think about turning back, but I kept going, I had no other choice. I needed to save my face. Fought to stay upright, scratching Gravy’s chin, telling him I was sorry, until I reached the landing and turned the corner. I saw something and crept back.

Down the hall, Lucas held little Ophelia outside apartment 205. Polly’s little girl Ophelia. 4 years old. Lucas knocked on the door and entered.  

I padded down the hall with Gravy still in my arms. Pressed my ear to the door. A muffled voice. A long pause. I stood behind the door when it opened again. Lucas stepped out, without Ophelia, and turned to find me. We both said something like *oh shit.*

His nose was bleeding. He held his hand up to it, but couldn’t stop the flow down his lips. The blood had dyed his mustache and beard completely red, like a lioness’s fur after feeding. Blood dripped off his chin onto the carpet.

I stared until it hit me. The blood.

“Have you been in my apartment?” I asked.

He doubled over in laughter. Sounded like hiccups. *Hic Hic Hic.* Blood fell onto the floor in spurts.

He coughed out, “Sylvia… wanted your ice cream,” and laughed some more.

I pivoted into the apartment. Sylvia sat on the floor with Ophelia in her lap. A string of drool dangled from her mouth onto Ophelia’s hair, but Ophelia was oblivious, playing with the metal ring puzzle. Sylvia's eyes looked up to me. She placed Ophelia on the ground and stood. She took the letter opener and pulled it from its sheathe, revealing a black blade. With her right hand, she held the blade aloft; with her left hand, she touched Ophelia's head.

I threw Gravy at Sylvia. He landed claws-first on her head. As Gravy raced down her back, his claws made this popping sound, tearing through her skin, but she barely reacted, moving her hands slowly, trying to catch him. I ran and grabbed Ophelia like a football. Sylvia tumbled over as I shoulder checked her on my way to the window. I lunged out the window and onto the fire escape.

All the way down, I begged little Ophelia to take her mom and escape, leave Lucas, leave the apartment.

“Please do you understand?” I asked her, but she beat on me with her little hands.

I guess my face looked normal by the time the cops caught up with me several hours later.

\-

And Isaac looked normal by the time I came to see him. He was charged with kidnapping. After reading his tale, my first thought was that he obviously made up the whole thing in a stupid attempt to justify his actions. Then, after he assured me he wasn't lying, I thought maybe I would plead insanity for the first time in my career. But his case never made it to trial. Strange things began to happen.

The cops found out that Polly, Lucas’s girlfriend, had gone missing. And before they could figure out what was going on, they found Lucas covered in blood in his bed, expired. The detective in charge mentioned other missing people. When I asked him how many, he wouldn't say. I told him to visit Sylvia in 205. He told me that they had everything handled and to keep my nose out of it. 

Isaac told me that he had money for a better lawyer. He just needed help getting it from the bank. Shortly thereafter, he landed in the hospital. I never heard from him again. They wouldn't divulge the cause of death.

Ophelia ended up with her Aunt and Uncle.

None of the disappearances made the news. I called the detective again at some point. He told me NOT to go to the press. It could ruin the investigation. I thought it was a bogus threat, but I complied anyway. I tried to forget about it and move on. 

Why am I sharing this now? Because… I think I did something stupid. Sylvia. She got stuck in my mind. Lodged in there. I’ve dreamt about her numerous times, even though I’ve never seen her. I had to know if she had anything to do with the disappearances. So, after all this time, about two years, I tracked down the apartment. 

Once I entered the lobby, I knew it was the right place, because I found a bulletin board with an old missing cat poster for Gandalf the long-haired cat. But when I saw it, I was overcome with a sense of dread. I left without visiting 205. I guess I'm a coward.

The day after I visited, I got this big zit on the center of my nose.

Now, I keep telling myself not to worry. But I check the mirror every two minutes.
