She came to me in an empty room.

It was the other way around. I sat with "nothing" on a green carpet.

And then I sat. My room probed with thoughts.

I cast

my mind. My mind was found.

Through my eyelids I faded saw an image.

What I had \*thought\* of as someone washing dishes.

"\*what are you up to?\* I ask

She responded. She answered?

And then she TOLD me to get off the line.

&nbsp;

She called me one word

PYCHOPATH

&nbsp;

I had found delight.

I found nightmare

\\---

Later

I ate at the kitchen table.

The family was there.

"TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW OR YOU WILL DIE"

They did not hear. I ignored it.

That is when I felt something:

A shift

My parents looked alarmed: their eye shifted.  A turbulent wild edge to their gaze which fractured my false calm.

I left.

Out the door -

Up the hill.

My parents -

They followed.

Something told me to not leave the gate.

I went up the rock.

They yelled for me.

They yelled after me?

I went to the top.

They followed.

&nbsp;

I fell

and damaged an intervertebral disc.

When I awoke on that couch I realized that I no longer wished for life: I wished for death.

I felt a pressure in my lower back. One that wouldn't go away. I felt it and felt it and then I felt my consciousness slip.

I had lived and my body did not die. I tried to let my body waste away until the memory of that day faded.

But I did not die. I was moved to bed where by back did not waste me.

\---

Near where I lived later we went on a walk to a small stable, my mind's attention weak.  The horses bit.

A horse bit my hand. I knew how to not let it hurt. I held out my hand palm open with closed fingers.

I felt joy at their gentle bite: the connection to another living being.

mom asked me if it was nice.

It was.

But I refused to say it to her.

\---

I walked down that street with no sidewalk to the stable. A horse layed on its side. It lay dead.

A man asked me if I thought the horse had rabies. I said "no". He asked me who might have thought such. I told him I did not know. I looked down the lane. He looked at me with concern in his eyes.

SHE was nearby.

\---

It was winter.

Butterflies landed on my shirt. The warmth of the greenhouse pavilion led to my wonder at the plants and the Monarchs.

My sister grabbed at them and crushed them. My mom looked back and forth slowly unfocused, their minds in an unknown state.

I wrested my sister from killing them by grabbing her hands. When I let go she grabbed more from my shirt. I took off the shirt and gently waved it to release them.

An attendant came by. She was confused at why I took my shirt off.

I explained. She said the color brought them to me.

\---

Downstairs.

The new year. A party.

I twirled found a spinner, layed abandoned. It made a loud clacking sound at it spun.

Instantly serrated nerve ends; a sharp pain in my sinus: metallic pain, liquid and hot

A pain that could not be comprehended fully by the brain.

I stood quiet in my pain.

SHE came down. Morbid. I heard her thumping down the wooden stairs.

She looked at me and told me she didn't like that noise.

She asked with her lips, throat and lungs: "Are you going to kill me?"

"I nodded" sheepishly,

The spinner struck on her shirt from my hand.

\---

A snake lie in the grass. I picked it up. It did not bite me. She bit me. The woman with black hair AND a rough and strained voice.

So hard the bite, only decades later

did I name it.

The snake did not speak. She spoke.

She did not speak. She spoke.

I ceased to hear her: she spoke through my family

They asked: I ignored; I insulted; I spoke nonsense. She bit my family instead. Something developed within me.

Glee

\---

In a dream, I was running through the foliage.

always caught and brought back. A dream?

When I awoke, my parents treated me as if I had done that very thing.

\---

A wolf creature looked through my window with eyes of hate and hunger. I knew it wanted to eat me.

I awoke.

A man with a the mask of a wolf looked through my window at me. The eyes of the mask stared forward toward at me.

My sister entered the bedroom. Only then could she conceal her alarm: she knew it did not like loud noises.

\---

I sat at the table speaking or eating. Dinner. My jaw lunged out to the side, unable to retract.

\---

My mind fragged: the pain of a psychic bite. As a kid I learned to aggravate her to find a visceral comfort in a life forced to live.

In middle school she taught me to forget her name. The thought of her threw my brain into a pit of fear and alarm. During school I heard whispers. People couldn't understand why I was spoken of in such a hushed, fearful way, for I rarely spoke in class.

In high school she brought down the roof. The entire grade was afraid of me. I had befriended her daughter, and her daughter said such a lie that which I cannot speak of. I turned toward obscenity and obscenity turned toward me. Often was I told to leave.

I failed to remember. In college she destroyed lives. I was ousted from each building bit by bit until I could no longer attend.  I threatened her family. I turned toward hate.

I failed to remember. I joined a therapy group to help myself -- she destroyed the group. Those there had horrifying experiences from which to draw from and behave with. I left.

I failed to remember. In Medellin She cast people at me the way waves break upon sharp rock. I could hear their cries, their anxiety, their hate as they followed me. I almost died -- the airplane home was filled with a cacophony of hate.

I decided to start a new life without anyone I knew. There I learned that her hatred of me had grown to never let me go, no matter how much it harmed her life.

And in Vietnam, all the way across the world, she brought me back.

\---

Only decades later did I realize again that there was a dangerous person nearby: a person that reflexively bites out of hate; a person that can speak in her sleep; a person who will bind those who learn of her name and her ability unto her forever will I condemn my parents for not taking us away.

&nbsp;

I will say that it isn't finished. She will not let me go. I cannot leave my hometown. I cannot speak with others for fear of them turning. I can barely work.

As a kid I had made a transgression upon her being: to connect to her and give insult.

And for that she gives no mercy.
