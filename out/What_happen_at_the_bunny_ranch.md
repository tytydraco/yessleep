15 years ago i was working as a escort doing « incalls » with a well known and established agency.  
That agency had 4 studios apartments rented in a ‘70’s high rise complex located in a shady part of downtown.  
One of that studio was solely rented for us, girls, to wait between « dates » and the 3 other ones were used for us to go do our 30mins or 1hr job.  
We were usually 4 girls per shifts.  
The atmosphere was really weird in theses studios, although you could expect it when you think of all the ugly things that have happened in theses studios over the years.  
It all started about a month in.  
As I got a « date », leaving our waiting studio, going up a floor to another studio waiting for my John to arrive, I found one (of the 4) stovetop bright red, left on max.  
I didn’t think anything and simply quickly turned it off, thinking the previous girl opened it and forgot to close it.  
This will then became a trend.   
Every time I was going to (any) studios to meet my John, I was greeting by a burning stove top.  
Every time, even if I, myself, was the last one in that same studio.  
I told my coworkers about this, asking them if they experienced it. To my surprise; none have been greeted in a studio by a open stovetop but 2 told me they experienced weird events that I didn’t believed at that time.  
Brushing it off my mind thinking that they must be on hard drugs.  
As the weeks went by, the stovetops have calm themselves and I almost forgot about all of this, until one day; while doing the job on the bed with a Jon; the bathroom light turned off and the shower started.  
Jon looked at me, stood up, got dressed and left « like he had seen as ghost ».  
The shower story repeated herself twice.  
Sometimes, despite all the closed windows a freezing cold wind will blow in the studio.  
I was petrified. I obviously didn’t want to work there anymore… ok I won’t lie, the money was good, it was great and this was the only « little » problem I repeated.  
One morning, as our shift began; a coworker grab a Ouija bord from her bag telling us that today is the day we found out what’s up with this place.  
I was prettified like the 2 other girls working that day.  
As you might imagine there’s a lot of turnaround in that « field » of work you often don’t get to know your coworkers very much and this was the case for me that day.  
The Ouija board girl were begging us to play but none wanted.  
I was tired of her acting like a child so I said « okkkkkk me, I’ll play » being convinced that this doesn’t work anyways.  
She said « coool, the only thing is that I can’t find the little plastic thing but I’m sure we could use a shooter glass ». I laugh and said sure!  
She then put 2 fingers on it and tell me to do the same.  
15 seconds later it started to frantically move from right to left non stop.  
She said something that I don’t remember, then it started to spell my real name (obviously, I was using a fake name and no one there knew my real name), actually; it spelled the short version of my real name that I HATE people using.   
I was frozen.  
I didn’t want to play anymore.  
The girl told me I I can’t, that I need to ask to quit.  
So I’ve asked; it kept circling the no.  
At one point I’ve just removed my fingers and prayed it was all in my head.  
After this event, I was more scared of that place that of that sad work I was doing.  
I left couples days later but never forget that place.  
I learn that it closed about 2 months after I’ve left despite being a decades old institution in that area.  
Weird…  
I never told this to anyone because no one knew I was doing this job back then and this is the hardest part.  
Writing it feel good, thanks for reading.
