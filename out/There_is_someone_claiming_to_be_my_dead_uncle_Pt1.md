I come from a long, old family line, but most of it feels like a blur. When I was four, my mother left for a life wrapped up in drugs. I barely remember her face. Since then, it’s only ever been me and my dad. We left Brooklyn years ago and moved to a small desert town in Southern California called Shadow Ridge. He works in housing development, usually stumbling home at midnight, reeking of aftershave and stress. 


That’s when I got a strange notification on Instagram one night, I froze. The account had no profile picture. No posts. Just a single line. “Hello Maribel, my name is Cody and I believe you are my niece?”. I read it about 6 times. Each time, goosebumps rose on both my arms. I wrote back: “I’m sorry but I think you have the wrong Maribel, I don’t have an Uncle Cody”. No reply that night. When I woke up the next morning, my phone lit up with notifications. All I saw nothing but notifications from YouTube videos, my emails from University, and Instagram. When I checked my Instagram account, I got a new message from the same blank account, but this time they had sent a picture. 

It was of me. Of when I was about 2 months old. In the picture, holding me was a man, long brown hair that looked like the end of dusty old broom, his frame gaunt, starved. His eyes were worse than the rest: wide, sleepless, almost feverish. Beneath the picture. It said “This was you when you were about four months old”, I stared at the picture until my eyes burned. My hands shook so badly I almost dropped my phone. Then came another message. “I remember the day you were born, the day you first walked, and the way you wore that pink princess dress until you were five.” Tears blurred my vision. I did own a pink princess dress. I wore it until the fabric tore at the seems. I thought only my dad remembered that. 

I typed back with trembling fingers. “I barely remember any of that. How do I even know that you are who you say you are?” Almost immediately, another ding. “I understand your concern. But your father and I had a falling out about eighteen years ago. We lost contact after that.” I didn’t reply. I couldn’t. My mind spun with questions I couldn’t answer. Who was this person? How did they get that picture? How did they know my childhood? Sleep came hard, but exhaustion eventually dragged me under. 

The next morning, I caught my dad as he was heading out for work. He wore his company uniform, hair slicked back with too much gel, the sharp sting of aftershave following him. He looked tired, but not surprised when I asked the question that had been drilling into my head all night. “Dad,” I said carefully, “do you…. Have a brother? Or an uncle? Someone named Cody?” The change in his face was instant. His brow dropped like a storm cloud, his polite half smile folding into a grimace. His voice came out low, sharp, like he was choking back rage.  “No,” he snapped. “I don’t. And I don’t know why you’d ask me that?” “I….. I was just curious, that’s all.” My voice broke into a whimper. Before I could say anything else, he slammed the door behind him, climbed into his pickup, and roared down the street. 

I stood frozen, then collapsed onto the couch, hot tears burning down my cheeks. My dad had never spoken to me like that. Never. Why would a simple question about family make him so furious? I tried to distract myself with the TV, flipping through channels, but every noise felt wrong. The house was too quiet. Too heavy. At some point I fell into a long, restless sleep, ten hours swallowed whole. 

When I woke, it was to my dad nudging my foot. His face looked pale, set. He carried an old cardboard box, edges frayed, dust clinging to the lid. He dropped it on the coffee table with a thud that rattled through me. Without a word, he opened it. Inside were stacks of photos yellowed edges, curled corners. He shuffled through them until he stopped at one. He slid it across the table. It was the same photo. Me as a baby. The same man holding me. Only this time, his face had been violently scratched out with something sharp. I forced the words out “Who was holding me?”My dad’s jaw clenched. His voice dropped to a whisper. “It was your Uncle Cody. He died when you were five.”
