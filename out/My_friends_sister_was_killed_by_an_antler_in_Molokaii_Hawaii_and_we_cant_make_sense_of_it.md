Edit: to remove Vivian’s last name.

Edit 2: Ok. Lua and I talked most of the night. All my intuition is telling me there’s nothing supernatural going on. Viv’s wake is tonight so I really don’t have a ton of time to update but I may write something up after that.

\*\*\*\*

Edit 3: brief update, all I had time to write. Lua and HW are fine. Wake is still on for tonight and funeral for tomorrow. I’m having to update in this post since I made the original post not that long ago.

*“I just went to visit Harrison very briefly. I asked him how he was doing, he was pretty drugged up but he said “never better.” I told him I talked to Lua and that I knew it wasn’t him who was driving and he FLIPPED. Kept saying “stop it, get the fuck out, tell Lua to shut the fuck up too.” I had to leave quickly. These are my friends guys. I’m actually scared now.*

*Since there’s a 1000 word requirement for an update (geeze) I’ll give a little background. My friend Lua’s sister Viv met Harrison at Princeton a few years ago. He was majoring in music and Viv was finishing up her degree in environmental architecture. Apparently they fell for each other very quickly, got married soon after they finished college (he switched to public relations) and were ecstatic to have found each other. Viv had been working with scientists at Princeton on deer populations for years before the trip to Moloka’i. I remember Harrison stole my line to court Viv: “You will have the tallest, darkest leading man in Hollywood.”*

*Unsurprisingly he turned out to have a bit of a mean streak. As far as I know he never hit Viv but he clearly had anger issues. I saw him blow up a couple of times when he was drunk and yeah it was scary. He got into scrapes occasionally but as far as I knew he was non-violent. He has sustained head injuries before and this shit can’t have helped. I’m really concerned about him. He is a very talented guy but a bit of a weirdo, when I say he was into music I mean classical music. Intensely. His favorite work was this thing by Haydn if I remember right called The Seven Last Words of Christ. Had a ton of biblical knowledge, Christian but like German Christian. Gothic or something. I don’t really know.*

*Viv, Lua and I all grew up in Texas. There are plenty of Axis deer here too but also plenty of whitetail. Lua and Harrison hunted together a couple of times in Alaska I think. They were into big game and Harry at least was pretty good at it. Elk and such. They got a moose together. Hunting isn’t exactly my thing.*

*At this point I should say Viv was my dear friend, I knew her best of the three. She and Lua were very close having grown up in the same foster family. She had been interested in the Axis problem in Hawaii since undergrad at Texas A&M and had worked with the deer populations here a bit too. Axis and whitetail both.*

*Harrison got into business for himself soon after college doing talent management. He’s seriously connected and comes from a family that’s about as close to Illuminati as you can get without any of the crazy shit you see in the movies. Allegedly his family is descended from this German scientist/philosopher guy Hermann Weyl. Harrison and Viv both were total brainiacs. Too much for their own good. Harrison got very rich on his own very fast and they started taking all sorts of trips, you name a place and they went there. Egypt, Greece, Baghdad. Think peace corps without being in the peace corps. They liked to do their own thing.*

*This is how they ended up in Moloka’i. Viv wanted to do research on the Axis deer population there but was having a hard time getting Princeton faculty on her side, much less grants or donors or anything like that yet. So she and Harrison went to Hawaii together to scope things out and get away. Apparently they had been having trouble.*

*I’m fairly certain Harrison cheated. Last night Lua referred to him as “the thirty-two-timer” among other things. I’ve never seen someone quite so sideways as Lua is currently. It’s hard. It’s hard to comfort any one person adequately. We all lost her.*

*Viv and I went to Hawaii a few times. In addition to deer there are numerous other gorgeous flora and fauna there. If you‘re thinking “Hawaiian flower” that’s probably plumerias. Gorgeous. The colors are never not vibrant. In Honolulu you can take wildlife tours and pick the flowers. Viv and I went once. If you can pay for it there are extensive tours that take you into places you can’t imagine, people and cultures we never really consider in day-to-day life here. The three of us went to a fire dance festival one time and Lua ended up crying in the bathroom. Harrison, always great at cheering people up, said “dance Lua! Don’t you know it’s a vivrant thing?” After the Q-Tip song. We would say that about events we all needed to be cheerful for in order to ensure that we could make Viv happy since she had planned them. If we didn’t stay cheerful it would be a Viv Rant thing for sure. Ha ha.*

*Viv’s parents aren’t around. She had an endless array of friends in different social strata and disciplines - artist, stockbrokers, you name it - but Lua and Harrison and myself were really the “core three” for her. There will be plenty of folks at the bonfire tonight I imagine. Viv was a big deal at Princeton so you can imagine the status she carried in a small Texas town.*

*My biggest concern at this point is confrontation between Lua and Harry. If I can get one to go to the wake and one to go to the funeral I think everything may be ok. If not Viv’s family and I need to re-evaluate, and quick. I would welcome any and all feedback on how to handle this situation. No matter what I’m not really optimistic for the next 36 hours or so. But I’ll keep you all posted.*

*Oh dear. I have to go for now. Viv’s wake is still on for tonight and Lua has calmed down a bit. I’m somewhat involved in funeral planning so we have a decision to make soon as to whether that’s still on or not. More soon. I have a very important date and I absolutely cannot be late. Not this time. Kommienezuspadt!*

P.S. Going out on a limb here but does anyone have any personal experience witnessing CWD?

Original Post

I found my friend’s journal, it’s really fucked. He got fired from his job this week, I drove by and saw cops outside his house. Apparently police took him away to a mental health facility and he just got back today. He can’t be alone so I’m staying with him but I looked through his journal. I know, spare me. It’s too much I don’t know what to do. Should I get anyone else involved? Her funeral is tomorrow and we/I just need everything calm.

*“I spent last night in a mental ward. I don’t really want to go into why. It involves a suicide attempt, police, an overprotective mother…anyway, this is what I wrote down while I was there. It’s also why I was there.*

*“My sister Vivian, who was alive until Sunday evening of this week, was an environmental scientist working in Moloka’i, Hawaii. Fun fact: on Moloka’i there are more than eight Axis deer for every human being. These are not to be confused with whitetail deer which are found more in the continental United States, but notably not in Hawaii and definitely not on Moloka’i. I make this distinction deliberately.*

*On Sunday evening Vivian and her husband Harrison were driving down the highway \[which?\] in Moloka’i, or rather up into the hills. Viv’s work involved gathering various samples from the deer population there. Axis deer were introduced into Hawaii as a gift to King Kamehameha I in the late 19th century So they do not occur naturally. They are wreaking havoc on the population there and that’s what Viv’s work was contributing to, although I admittedly and regrettably don’t understand what she was doing as well as I would have hoped. I should have asked.*

*According to Harrison, he was driving and he and Viv ended up behind a truck of some kind going up into the hills and the truck hit one of the deer, a buck. Harrison told me they thought it was raining at first and then they realized it was blood from the carcass right before the head hit the windshield. He was driving but the antlers came through the windshield and killed her instantly. It wasn’t an Axis antler It was a whitetail one.“*

*I’m in the hospital with Harrison now in Texas, he woke up today but he’s not doing great. He keeps going on about “the man in antlers” and how “he got her. he got Viv.” We are very concerned about him. But he’s very tough. He always did love to hunt. He was very good at it, very thorough. No one had trouble rubbing deer piss on their necks but I remember he would carry antlers on hunts with us to simulate the sounds of bucks fighting. He’s a very smart and creative guy. He’s on life support and for now I’m the only one who can pull the trigger or not since everyone’s flying in tomorrow for Viv’s funeral. It’s just me and Harry for now. We’re so glad he’s safe, aren’t we?“*
