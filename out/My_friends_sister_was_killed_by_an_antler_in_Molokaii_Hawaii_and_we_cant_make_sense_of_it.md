I found my friend’s journal, it’s really fucked. He got fired from his job this week, I drove by and saw cops outside his house. Apparently police took him away to a mental health facility and he just got back today. He can’t be alone so I’m staying with him but I looked through his journal. I know, spare me. It’s too much I don’t know what to do. Should I get anyone else involved? Her funeral is tomorrow and we/I just need everything calm. 

*“I spent last night in a mental ward. I don’t really want to go into why. It involves a suicide attempt, police, an overprotective mother…anyway, this is what I wrote down while I was there. It’s also why I was there.*

*“My sister Vivian Jackson, who was alive until Sunday evening of this week, was an environmental scientist working in Moloka’i, Hawaii. Fun fact: on Moloka’i there are more than eight Axis deer for every human being. These are not to be confused with whitetail deer which are found more in the continental United States, but notably not in Hawaii and definitely not on Moloka’i. I make this distinction deliberately.*

*On Sunday evening Vivian and her husband Harrison were driving down the highway \[which?\] in Moloka’i, or rather up into the hills. Viv’s work involved gathering various samples from the deer population there. Axis deer were introduced into Hawaii as a gift to King Kamehameha I in the late 19th century So they do not occur naturally. They are wreaking havoc on the population there and that’s what Viv’s work was contributing to, although I admittedly and regrettably don’t understand what she was doing as well as I would have hoped. I should have asked.*

*According to Harrison, he was driving and he and Viv ended up behind a truck of some kind going up into the hills and the truck hit one of the deer, a buck. Harrison told me they thought it was raining at first and then they realized it was blood from the carcass right before the head hit the windshield. He was driving but the antlers came through the windshield and killed her instantly. It wasn’t an Axis antler It was a whitetail one.“*

*I’m in the hospital with Harrison now in Texas, he woke up today but he’s not doing great. He keeps going on about “the man in antlers” and how “he got her. he got Viv.” We are very concerned about him. But he’s very tough. He always did love to hunt. He was very good at it, very thorough. No one had trouble rubbing deer piss on their necks but I remember he would carry antlers on hunts with us to simulate the sounds of bucks fighting. He’s a very smart and creative guy. He’s on life support and for now I’m the only one who can pull the trigger or not since everyone’s flying in tomorrow for Viv’s funeral. It’s just me and Harry for now. We’re so glad he’s safe, aren’t we?“*
