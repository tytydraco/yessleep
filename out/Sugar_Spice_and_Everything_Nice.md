Two Men, white coats, stood in a hallway of cinderblock walls slathered in thick, creamy white paint. Shrieks, like hellward souls, echoed with such insistence it was as though the spectral form of pure suffering herself were pressing in on them, breathing down their necks.

More voices bellowed their agony from behind heavy wooden doors sealed shut, the occupant only one of hundreds of muffled wails that made the wicked chorus of which the white coats now found themselves eager spectators of. This door before them now, was opened to them, they are the ones with the keys. 

They may look upon whomever they like. 

Any private, personal, painful moment of the wooden door hidden dwellers, these men found themselves privileged to be standing witness.

 And why shouldn't they be? 

They had, after all, sought higher education to be standing in this hall, didn't they? To best understand the banshee’s woe? The tale they belt as their minds are further ripped to shreds in the clawed, gnarled fingers of the good intended.  

Oh yes, there was indeed a sick delight in watching what *was* a human being's last vestige of self, slipping away and their entire perception of reality being violently unraveled as they, the all too often innocent victim, must sit and watch it encase them, in horrified realization that there is no cure. There will be no going back, their insanity will be their tomb.

Like the husk I am becoming, I will be cast in a heap with others of my kind, and we will pile and rot together, till the shovel comes for us and churns our bodies into the soil. They had been left by all. They had been forsaken. 

This was education, you see? 

For the white coats.

It's good for them to see all of these often-final moments of sanity before it evaporates completely. 

These damned creatures, some more pitiful than others, but all condemned the same, bound in red hot chains, dragging to their fiery fate in the chasmal jaws of the hell mouth. 

Not by any God, but by a judge and a jury of peers, perhaps even directly admitted by the ones they had trusted most.

Her shrill cries were piercing, the younger white coat flinched, ash falling from his untouched cigarette that perched between bony fingers. 

Amusement huffed out of the older white coat, a short, big nosed man.

“This one's been a particular handful.” He puffed his own smoke.

“What’s got her so agitated tonight?”

“The case worker came by to ask her again about the alleged crime and see if she'd made any ‘improvements’ to her story.”

“Yeah uh, Lisa the mother from new jersey, she accused her husband of drugging and repeatedly raping her on multiple occasions.”

“Exactly. Can you imagine such a thing? A husband *raping* his *WIFE?* The very idea is preposterous.”

“Indeed.” Said the younger.

“But after so many rounds of electroshock therapy, she still insists that she was somehow abused because her husband made love to her a little more often than she'd have it. I mean, that's insanity!” The older emphasized with pudgy fingers. “Even if he did give it to her a coupla times when she was bein feisty, she gave her body to him in vows, *for better or for worse…* Does that just mean nothing to these girls nowadays?” The younger tsked. 

“It's a shame, the file says that by all accounts she was a real good woman before this. Too bad.” The two walked down the hall, members of staff rushing past to subdue the woman.

They continued up to the corridor that led to the front of the sanitarium’s north wing. The steady thuds of their oxfords against the dingy, yellowed wax of the linoleum, a metronome to keep on time, the dark music swelling around them. 

They continued their conversation about the lost lunatic, the bipolar beauty. Maybe a more archaic form of therapy was needed, they mused. They could try a sexual reconditioning treatment, that could be promising. Those were always such a jolly bit of fun. Well, once the broads settled back and stopped screaming and begging to stop.

 If all else failed there was always a Lobotomy and starting fresh, many husbands found this to be the treatment with the most satisfactory results. Always got the gals in tiptop shape with little waiting involved! 

Both laughed, discreetly adjusting their trousers at the prospect.

Education, remember? 

Yes, she would be the teacher of the treacherous, imbalanced female mind and the chance to learn under her was an opportunity both men covet greatly.

Their steps, their laughs, the voices all swarming with the others, with even the voices of the twisted children who wail still for mercy that will never come.

 The sonnet of the damned, of lost suffering floating even now, ghouls left to howl into the haunted wind, to this very day. 



“OH NO THE FUCK THEY DO NOT, AMANDA!!” 

“Yes huh, my brother told me, and he heard it from college guys, and they don't lie about shit like this.” She nodded earnestly at Brittany B. 

“If everyone hears voices and shrieking, and whispers,” She counted, condescendingly on her fingers like a know-it-all… “Then there'd be like, news reports and tons of recordings when you look it up on google.com.” 

*God she was being a real bitch tonight!* 

Something spoken telepathically in the glances the other girls shared behind Brittany B’s back.

 But no one said this out loud.

All the girls were secretly intimidated by her, even though they acted like they weren't when she wasn't around to hear. They could at least all, if not begrudgingly, admit she was their sort-of leader. 

“It’s only if you're there on Halloween Eve. That's why there aren't more recordings and stuff, people go on the wrong days and give up! They don't follow the legend right, but we’re doing it exactly right, you guys will see. We're gonna see some freaky shit tonight!” She was grinning like a maniac, obviously getting off on the adrenalin. The other girls rolled their eyes at Amanda's enthusiasm.

Brittany McCarty tried to placate the group, always the pacifist, never one to pick a side.  Cici trudged into the center of their party.

“Okay, go forward, go back I don’t give a shit but I’m fucking cold and we need to get out of the wind. Let’s just go and stand inside of there since it's closer, then we can decide to look around or not, cool? Yeah, let's go.” She commanded, rallying the girls to walk on and end this tiring quarrel about ghosts already. That's all the group ever talked about since Amanda’s brother told her about the legend a couple weeks prior.  

Brittany B stood a moment longer before laughing and walking up, locking arms with her closest friend in the group, Cici and the two quietly whispered back and forth the whole way down the steep hill to the down barbed wire fence. 

They used large branches and held the fencing down for each other. The exact way in was an earned bit of knowledge, passed down from the older, cooler kids to their little thralls only after enough booze and smokes were lifted from unsuspecting parents and convenient stores to prove their value to the group.

Amanda's brother had told her, but rumor has it, he told Brittany B first, because she sucked his dick behind Burger King during summer break and then he had to tell Amanda or she was gonna tell their mom, but Amanda and her have never brought it up. Cici and Brittany McCarty were sure as hell not going to say anything, but desperate to know if there was any truth to this. 

Such simple problems, such a simple time, there was no way to know what would come for them.

After making their way inside, converse and combat boots crunching on debris, the four girls made their long way into the bowels of an overgrown building treading deeper to escape to blistering wind.

 Silence engulfed the forest around their labyrinth....
