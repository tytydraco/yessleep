Hey,

There's something that's been bothering me and you're the only one I feel like listens; even though you only respond when it involves my new girlfriend... anyways about a week now I can't SEEM to walk to work without this guy bumping into me. Just an ordinary suit and tie business guy (eh see what I did there?).  He acts like he's on the Bluetooth headset adorning his stupid ear, talking to some entity on the other end of the line, but I SWEAR his eyes don't break contact until he runs into me. 

Everyday is something new, a bagel splattered into my shirt, a coffee that can't drift away from my pants, or a casual shoulder check. Am I crazy?? Is he trying to get a rise out of me? I asked Sarah about it and she just thinks it's my chest that stands out like when we go out to the bar and every guy hounds me like a puppy wanting a treat. That doesn't explain the piercing eyes that stare into my soul as he casually finds a way to ruin my short commute. 

Today it was different. He stared at the ground, as if some kind of guilt was consuming him. No headset, no suit, just another cis gendered white dude taking up the sidewalk. I felt bad and stopped him. He murmured a plethora of words that didn't make sense except the part where he finally said sorry, but it was more like he was just sorry for existing in that moment. I said thanks and headed to the brew house like any other day, thinking that was the end of it.

Fast forward to the middle of my shift the dude stumbles through the door, Sarah might have been onto something, this dude walk up to the counter and is just staring at me as if I was a rack of ribs at a BBQ eating contest. I didn't notice it before so maybe I was overthinking. He ordered a coffee and bagel breakfast (classic) and tipped me some weird coins and sat in a booth that had the slightest view of where I stand behind my safety net of beers and patrons that at least tip big for staring. 

Walking home I couldn't help but think about the dude and all the possibilities of why he could've been fired. I flipped his coins listening with my air pods to the tune of the backseat lover, until I dropped the damn thing, it rolled down the concrete up to guess who the same dumb guy. 

Taking the opportunity of a lifetime I asked him how he got fired or if he quit. My money was on an HR complaint or something. Like always he just stared at me, but not my breast, or my eyes, just staring hard. I asked again, "Hey so whaddya doin out on the streets?"

Shaking his head he said the most jarring thing. "My coworkers wouldn't let me mooch of of them anymore and I'm the only one left." 

*The only one left?* It must have been some small firm if they closed up within the few months of me moving here. I bet he's just another sexual harassment case. 

Wouldn't you know it he grabbed for me; luckily I've been carrying my pepper spray and he got a mouthful, eyeful, face full. I ran without looking back. Taking a few roundabout streets to make sure he couldn't follow me. 

When I got back to the apartment I share with Sarah, she was standing outside. She kept asking where I was  and kept going on and on about me cheating. Just cause I did it with her doesn't mean I'd do it again (sorry). The horror in my eyes shut her up quick, coming up the other end of the sidewalk was my red faced victim looking even more worse for wear. I didn't remember hitting him but the dude looked worse than the first guy in the 100 vs 1 gorilla match. I tossed his coin towards him and some sensibility returned to his hyper focused shuffle. Some business men never let go of their money like they say. Sarah, and I ran inside and called the cops. 

I've just been typing this to you and listening to the slow beating on our door while we wait. Hopefully, they come soon he won't stop grumbling about how he just needs some more meat. I get it my body has been a walking object of desire ever since puberty, but this is some next level freak shit. Sarah has been doubling down about how I'm some sort of affair heifer. Cow references yay it's not like I chose to be born like this. 

I hope this finds you well and you feel some sort of relief that my life has been crazy and my new partner has grown suspicious of me just like you did. Maybe it's karma or something. I still love you Steph <3
