As a kid, my mom always told me to never leave a room without turning the lights off. I had always asked her for her reasoning, but her answer was continuously, "Because I said so!". I had always just assumed that she wanted to save energy or lower the electricity bill. The next few years I had always abided by that rule because it just made sense. Every time I'd leave a room, I'd flick the light switch off. Until last week. 

It was a rainy Tuesday morning, and I was planning to sit on the couch all day and have a Netflix movie marathon. My mom was at work, so I had the house to myself. I was about to start an interesting looking movie when I got a text from my friend, Sierra. 

"Wanna go to the movies at noon? I'll pick you up."

And since I had nothing particularly important to do, I agreed. I checked my watch. 9:00 AM. That gave me three hours. I decided that I had plenty of time get up and make myself some food. 

Over the next hour, the rain picked up. It was accompanied by some strong winds. I looked out the window, concerned for how Sierra was going to drive to my house safely. 

Some time passes and I peer down at my watch again. 11:50?! How has it already been two hours? I flick off the light in the living room as I scramble to my bedroom and yank on some sweatpants and a pink tank top. 

I'm shuffling through my closet, trying to find some decent shoes, when my phone pings with a text, "I'm here!". I decide to just slip on some running shoes and call it a day.

I sprint out of room and out the front door. I'm greeted with a, "Hey girl!" and a smile from my friend. Just as we get to the movie theater, my heart skips a beat as I remember I forgot to turn off my bedroom light. Then I relax, as I remember that my mom is at work and can't scold me for wasting energy. We get inside, buy some snacks and drinks and sit down. 

The movie is pretty good and lasts about two hours. As we leave the theater, my eyes adjust to the light and I realize that its still raining outside. 

"Greatttt. We get to walk to your car in the rain.", I groan. 

After a few minutes, we jump inside of her car, soaking wet. My running shoes are covered in mud and my pink tank top has wet splotches all over it. I'm exhausted. We finally reach my house, say goodbye, and I dash inside as quickly as I can in muddy shoes.

I sigh as I get inside my warm, dry house. I kick off my shoes and peel off my damp socks. I decide to go to my room and take a much needed nap. 

When I reach my room, I half expect the lights to be off, but nope. They're on. Just how I left them. Guilt suddenly washes over me for not conserving energy. The guilt is soon extinguished by the sight of my soft, warm bed. I turn off the light, close my curtains, and crawl into bed. I pile blankets on top of my cold skin and close my eyes. 

I'm right on the edge of sleep when I feel something fall into my hair. At first I ignore it, passing it off as being tired and delusional. But then there it is again. I start to worry that theres a leak in my roof, as that has happened before. I snap my eyes open and look out the window...its not raining anymore. I look up. My ceiling is dry. All I see is a bright light. My lights are on. Didn't I turn the lights off?

I get up to turn them off (again) when I feel three more drops in my hair. I run my hand through my hair and screech. There's a bug in my hair. There's two bugs. There's seven bugs. IN MY HAIR. I try to get them out, but more and more tiny black spiders are falling from the ceiling. Why are there bugs in my ceiling? 

That's when I realize they are falling out of the light bulbs. There are so many bugs in my hair, that my head feels like it weighs fifty pounds. I drop to the floor. Spiders start to climb onto me. They're on my face. They crawl into my nostrils, my ears, my eyes. I try to scream but my throat is clogged with insects. I start coughing and wheezing and everything goes black. 

Now, a week later, I'm writing this from my aunt's house. My mom said that she came home from work, and found me unconcious on my bedroom floor. I asked her about the spiders and she looked at me like I was crazy. They want to send me to a mental hospital. They think I'm crazy. But I know that there's a reason my mom is keeping me at my aunt's house. They're hiding something. Something dark. There's something in my house. 

And that's when I feel it...a small dry object in the back of my hair, just behind my ear. A pull it out, already knowing exactly what is sitting in my fingers. A spider.
