And here we are again. Against all my better senses and hope, I'm back on this site. To report on what happened since? To ask for advice? To find some sort of solace? I don't know. I'm just... writing this out. I just need to get it off my mind. I feel like I'm going insane.

That night, when I got off the bus, I watched it leave. Travel into the distant fog and disappear over the horizon. After that, I had a few weeks of absolute silence. I thought I was finally away from all this. I thought I finally broke whatever curse or bind or whatever this thing was. I even started to forget about all of this.

And that's what it wanted. It was waiting. It wanted me to feel safe, it wanted me to have that false sense of security before it started to tear at my mind again. Three months, reader, before the tapping started again. Like I said, at this point I'd forgotten about this whole thing, so I opened the curtains to see if it was a bird or something. It wasn't. How I wish to tell you, with all my heart, that it was just a bird. No, what I saw wasn't natural, it wasn't normal. This horribly disfigured shadow figure, too tall, too many teeth, claws curling on the window into a rhythmic tapping, stared back at me. I quickly closed the curtains and turned around, taking a deep breath.

I tried to convince myself it was just something I saw out of tiredness or... something. I couldn't really find any reasonable explanation. My heart was racing, and I'm confident it skipped a few beat when I heard a wolf howl. I was just outside town, in a rural area, that I need to clarify, did not have wolves. Lots of smaller pests and mountain lions, yes. Wolves? No.

With that howl, all the memories of this gods-forsaken book came flooding back. The book I had left near the other side of town. The same book I had no access to, and I thought had no access to me. How very wrong I was.

The rhythmic tapping and howling grew worse with every passing night since. I did my best to ignore it. A few weeks in, I had even started to convince myself that I was delusional, I was seeing things, hearing things. I started going to therapy, I talked to the doctors and they put me on medication for it. And here's one of the most disturbing parts of this entire story. It worked.

For weeks, it was silent. I kept taking the medication, going back, talking to my therapist. I thought I was just crazy, and that I was finally free. The medication was working, I was sleeping well, I hadn't heard or seen things in weeks, and I was finally calming down. 

Until that fateful day. On a walk to restock the bread in my friend's place, I saw him. The man in the suit from that night on the bus, he was standing across the street, just... staring at me. I waved, I called over, I asked what he wanted. Nothing. No response, no movement. He just stood there, still as a corpse, staring. A truck flew past me, and I heard another howl in the background, when the truck had left, the man was gone.

I chalked it up to another delusional event, the doctors and therapist said I may still experience some of it. It's fine. I got the bread, went back home, and made myself a sandwich. After I finished it, I went to grab my meds, but they were gone. It's important to know that I was very rigid about them. I knew exactly where they were, and I never moved them. I even bought to of those little every-day-of-the-week pill containers to organize them and know what to drink when.

I looked everywhere, I ransacked the apartment and couldn't find anything. Not a single sign of them anywhere. Not until I went back, and there they were, where I'd always left them. So I took that day's dose and went about my routine before finally going to bed. I couldn't sleep that night, the tapping kept me awake.

And it only god worse. Despite taking the meds everyday, the noises, the feelings, the sights, it all just kept getting worse. The doctors increased my meds, changed it, did everything they could, and nothing worked. Eventually we agreed it's safer to just check into a ward and experiment until they can figure out how to help me.

They have a wonderful library with computers, where I play games or read or do whatever to take my mind off of all this. And from which I'm writing this. Here's the thing, I'm glad they're helping me, but I don't want to go back to my room. It's in there, it's waiting for me. That thing has attacked me in my sleep. No, it's just sleep paralysis, the doctors say, despite the evidence of physical scratchmarks across my arms. They're going mad trying to figure out how I'm harming myself. I'm not. I don't want to go back.
