When I had the idea to surprise my Fiance with lunch at her work today I didn’t expect to find multiple dismembered corpses and live human captives. 

I wanted to surprise my fiance at her work today. I have been making an extra effort to be spontaneous and show how much she means to me. That's how I came up with the idea of surprising her with some of our favourite sushi for lunch.

As I entered the front reception of her work, a pep in my step, I was surprised to see the front reception desk vacant. I rang the bell on the reception desk, but it went answered. I called out and was again met with silence. I attempted to call my fiance which went straight to her voicemail. I decided to go see if she was in her office. 

Reaching her office I found the door wide open and the room empty. I put the food on her desk and proceeded down the hallway.

I had never been passed the reception or her office before, so I really had no idea where I was going. 

As I walked down the hallway I noticed how eerily quiet the building was. This shouldn't have been alarming, the staff at the surgery consisted only of my Fiance, her lab assistant and the receptionist.

I walked down the narrow corridor, passing multiple locked doors, until I came to an open door with a sign stating “Laboratory 2” on it. I knew I should not have been snooping through a private surgery, but given my Fiance was in charge here I figured there wasn't too much harm in it. 

Pushing the door open I called out, “Helllllooo? Babe it’s me, I brought you some lunch. Surprise…” 

No one responded and as I turned to leave the room a shape on the bench caught my eye.

The room was dimly lit so I fumbled around the wall till I found a lightswitch. With the room now illuminated I took in the site before me. 

Up on the bench lay a body, partially covered by a white sheet. The body was missing its right arm and right leg. I noticed the eyes were removed as well as the top of the skull. I don't know why but curiosity forced me to walk over and look inside the skull. 

I am still unsure what I expected to see? I guess a brain or blood or something! The skull was an empty void, whatever bits normally occupied a human skull were absent from this cadaver.

Casting my eyes over the room I found jars and cases of various parts lining the benches and shelves. Brains, eyes, hearts. Even whole limbs and heads. The room looked like an auto spare parts store, but of the human variety. 

The deeper I delved, the stranger things became. Several of the human samples were disfigured. Bulbous growths like barnacles covered some. Reptilian looking scales grew on others.

What I was seeing in this room, all these human experiments made me tremble. It gave off a real Frankenstein type vibe. This undoubtedly felt ethically wrong. What type of research was my Fiance doing here?

The sound of voices in the hallway broke me from my trance. Looking  for a way out, I found another door at the back of the room. Luckily the door was unlocked and it led me out into what looked like a small warehouse. 

Stumbling through the darkness I hid behind a large timber crate. The voices grew louder, getting closer. The most unsettling thing was that they were both unmistakably male. All the staff at this small surgery were female as far as I knew.

They were talking amongst themselves in the other room. I could only make out parts of what they were saying. Something about meeting a deadline or they risk losing their funding.

Stealthily I made my way a bit closer to the door, hoping to better hear what they were discussing. I was finally within earshot when something unbelievably strong grabbed my shirt and jerked me around. 

I looked down at the hand that had just grabbed me, sticking out between a thick barred steel cage. Light brown scales covered the hand, spreading half way up the forearm. Normal human skin resumed leading up to a muscular torso covered in scars and stitches. 

I stared in confusion at what stood before me. Struggling to make sense of what I was looking at. 

The person grunted at me, and that is when I first took notice of their face. Their mouth had been crudely stitched shut. Scales similar to those on their hand sporadically dotted their face. Where their nose should have been were two small oval holes. Their dark brown hair was matted and thin. A large scar spanned the circumference of their head, starting slightly above their brow line.

Their eyes were completely orange with large black pupils. They looked like the eyes you would expect to find on a large mammal. Although the eyes lacked any resemblance to those of a human, I was positive I could see desperation in them. This captured soul was asking, no pleading, for my help. 

"What happened to you?" I asked. The captive creature dropped its head and pointed to the room I had just come from. "Did they do this to you?" It nodded a reply of yes.

"I'll get you out of here. Let me find something to open your cage" I said as I started looking around the room for anything that may be useful.

Using my phones torch I slowly explored the small warehouse. I was horrified to find he wasn't the only prisoner here. Multiple cages lined the room. All freakishly unique in their own ways. A tiny man with antlers and patches of fur. A young woman with two extra small arms protruding from the sides of her shoulders.

They all had stitched mouths and pleading eyes of despair. 

As I took my next step, I felt my footing give and stumbled. I had tripped on a mop and bucket. It happened in slow motion, as I fell forwards a cry left my mouth. Followed by an almighty bang as I knocked over a bench of utensils on my way to the floor. 

As I lay on the cold concrete floor, I struggled to regain my bearings. I must have smacked my head on the way down as the room was spinning all around me. My ears were ringing and dots clouded my vision.

"What was that noise? Did one of those samples get loose out the back!" I heard one of the male voices yelling out to the other.

I scrambled to my feet and ran. Passing more cages, all encapturing more unique figures. Several normal people were also bound and gagged in separate cells. Undoubtedly being stored until they too were subjected to similar forms of torture and experimentation.

I crashed through a fire exit at the back of the building and ran for my life. I haven't been home yet. I can't face my Fiance knowing what she is involved in. I could pretend I didn't see anything, but I left the sushi on her desk so she will know I had stopped by.

I'm tempted to go to the authorities but at the same time I'm conflicted because I love her.

What should I do? What would you do?
