Ever since I can remember I have suffered from sleep paralysis. It wasn’t everyday or every week, it was random, sometimes I’d have 1 in a month and sometimes I’d have about 10. I got used to the feeling of not being able to move and only look around with my eyes. I could instantly recognise that I was in sleep paralysis and wouldn’t be afraid of the shadows and things I saw because I knew it wasn’t real. That is until a few days ago.

 It was a normal day, I spent it playing Xbox and watching Netflix, I’m out of work right now so my day usually goes like this. As I was heading to sleep I put my AirPods in and put on some horror stories on YouTube and began to fall asleep. About 2 hours later I woke up and couldn’t move, I looked around and didn’t see anything, I realised I’m in sleep paralysis again and I kept looking around the room.

I wasn’t able to see anything until a large figure stepped out of my closet, he was dark, tall and looked muscular, he steeped out and looked straight at me. Now I could feel my heartbeat quicken as I haven’t seen something like this during sleep paralysis. It was always a regular looking human shape not a giant man like this. 

This is when it happened. I heard him say “don’t be afraid”. This is the only time that I could hear voices during my sleep paralysis. I started to think how and why this thing was talking to me when he answered my questions himself. “I can hear your thoughts, don’t be afraid” 

I couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right, I mean this guy can hear my thoughts, and he keeps saying don’t be afraid. 
As you can imagine I was very much afraid and started thinking “what do you want?” The figure moved closer and he said “I just like watching, watching you sleep.” 

I was panicking now and started to look around the room trying to find any way out of this situation. I tried closing my eyes and waiting but I could hear him breathing heavily in front of my face. When I opened my eyes he was very close to my face, our eyes meeting in the middle. I say eyes but there was nothing but darkness as if I was looking at a black wall. 


I thought “can you leave me alone?” Not knowing what else to do or say to get out. He moved back a little bit and said “of course I can, for now, I’ll see you later little one.” He moved back into my closet, I could still hear his laboured breathing.

I closed my eyes tight and waited until I could move, it felt like hours but I know it was only a few minutes at most. When I could move I walked to my closet and opened it to find no one and nothing in there. 

I checked my phone and it was about 3 am. Not needing to go anywhere in the morning I stayed up and watched YouTube videos to get my mind off things.

When I felt a little safer and calmer I decided to search up if sleep paralysis demons can talk to you, I found varying results but many said that they can. I know now that I need to be more careful and not be so careless about sleep paralysis. 

I really hope he didn’t mean it when he said he’ll see me later, I hope I never see him and hear his laboured breathing again.
