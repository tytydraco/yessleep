I have always taken great pride in my Halloween decorations.

Every year I ensure that *my* house is the life of the street. A beacon of shimmering, flickering orange, adorned with skeletons and props and other such interactive features for the trick or treaters. You know, animatronic figures that jump and shake when you walk past the sensors, that kind of thing.

Holidays are only as special as we make them, that’s what I believe. I just want to make the experience as fun for everyone else as I possibly can. As memorable. And whilst my own Halloweens weren’t always too ‘happy’, as such, there was still always a certain, undeniable magic about them. And that’s what I want to perpetuate. That magic.

I wipe my forehead and stick my tongue out the corner of my mouth, brow furrowed as I work on my next pumpkin. And don’t make fun of me! Sticking your tongue out DOES help! It frees up brainpower that would have been spent on your tongue muscles and allows you to redirect that power elsewhere. Which in this instance, is into the careful, intricate carving of the pumpkin.

I glance over my shoulder at the row I have along the table, all completed and ready to go, funny faces carved into the front and candles placed inside. Just need to light them, but, I’ll light them all at the same time, of course.

I have a date coming over later. I wipe some pumpkin residue on the side of my pants and lift my wrist for a glance at my watch. He’ll be here soon, actually. I want the place looking as spooky and as ‘thematic’ as possible before they get here, but, I’m a little behind schedule. Might have to get him to help me set the pumpkins up outside.

I force the serrated knife into the top of the latest, holding it at an angle and slicing a rough circle around the centre. The angle is important as it means the lid won’t fall inside by mistake when you want to put it back on. I grunt and bring up my elbow to get through a tough part, looking up to my TV as I work. It’s still set to the news channel of my old home town, and a reporter talks earnestly to individuals on the street, all dressed-up and preparing for trick-or-treating.

“But are you not concerned”, the reporter asks, “that the murders might take place again? Are you not putting yourself and your children at risk by bringing them out tonight?”

I grimace. So morbid.

The woman shakes her head in response. “I’m not going to let my children’s Halloweens be ruined by this *fear*. We’re a strong community! We have neighborhood watches set up, nothing’s going to happen because we’ll be making sure of it”.

I nod and half-smile. *Good for you, I think. You shouldn’t let fear rule your life.*

I shoot another look to my watch.

&#x200B;

My date should be here at any minute.

&#x200B;

I complete the serrated circle with the knife and draw it out with a pop, lifting the lid and placing it on the table beside, tearing away the wet, gross little gooey pumpkin strands, and I reach in to start scooping out the gunk inside, bringing a quick finger up to my mouth for a taste.

…Yeah I know it looks gross but come on, the taste is awesome. 

I consider saving some to make some pie with later that evening, once the last trick-or-treaters have been and gone.

Trick-or-treating is so much fun. Though personally, I never actually had much luck trick-or-treating myself, when I was a kid. I loved the holiday, but, I didn’t have many friends to go out with, and I always got picked on for my choice of costumes.

I didn’t realize until I was older that it wasn’t really the *costume* at all. It was just *me*. It didn’t matter what I wore.

I sigh bitterly, shaking my head. Those days are over, thankfully. And whilst I can’t get my Halloweens back, I can at least make them special for others. The smile returns to my face and out goes the tongue, as I plunge a slightly sharper knife into the pumpkin’s front, carving intensely around and around. I’m going to give this one a ‘cross-eyed, wobbly-smile’ kind of look.

…

…It’s difficult to explain, aright? It’ll look good when it’s done, trust me.

I grunt with exertion as I push the knife right through and juice squirts across my shirt, oozing and pulsing over the table. It starts to sag a little where I’ve cut and I swear under my breath. It’s not holding its shape as well as the others.

*Hm. Maybe this one is just a little too ripe.*

Still, I’m an expert. I can make it look good.

I look over my growing collection on the table, and on the windowsill. I tap my chin in thought. *I could use cocktail sticks?* I did that for one of them. I stuck little cocktail sticks into the flesh to force it to keep its smile, and it looks pretty good! I tested it with a candle and the light made the cocktail sticks look like sharp, grinning teeth. It creates a very pleasant glow through the eyes as well.

“Will the killer strike again?” the reporter asks, and my attention is returned to the TV. “Police presence is high, and the locals here seem convinced that-”

I shiver and switch the channels. I don’t need to see this. The reporter is replaced by the soothing songs of *The Nightmare Before Christmas*, and I relax a little.

I squat down lower and with concentration renewed, I slowly push a spoon through my pumpkin’s eye, there’s a little splatter and a crunch as I bring it around, the muscles in my wrist tight as I scoop out the straggly bits.

“Ugh”. I splat the spoonful down on the tray I have placed beside the ‘carving zone’ where it leaks and pools.

I’ll be able to get this one completed for sure, though I’ll need to let it dry out a little first. I might even have time to do another. I glance over to the pile of pumpkins in the corner of the room. 

…There’s a lot of them.

I may have overdone it a bit this year.

*No, you shouldn’t apologize for being optimistic! Nothing wrong with a little ambition!* My inner voice tells me, and I laugh. *Yes, I suppose that’s true.*

I just want my house to be the absolutely best on the street To keep up my ‘streak’.

I scoop out some more of the shmutz inside and use my fingers to pluck away the finer, stickier threads. Some of them take quite a bit of pulling.

I bring around the knife and force it back into the pumpkin’s face, squishing the blade around as I try to fix the drooping, but alas, I am unable. And I don’t think the cocktail-sticks would look as good in this one. So I decide to simply rework the decoration’s expression, making it ‘scared’ instead, the wobbly-smile turning into a wobbly-*frown*.

Yes, oh this works much better.

I don’t have as much space to work with either, as this pumpkin is a little smaller than the rest of them. I’m so focused on the soft, slick sound of the knife slicing wetly through my modest work of art that I almost miss the sound of the door opening. 

&#x200B;

I hear a man call out my name.

&#x200B;

I look at my watch, flicking away a little pumpkin stuck on the face.

&#x200B;

He’s here, how wonderful.

&#x200B;

“Come on in!” I say to him, attention returned to the pumpkin. “I’m just working on the decorations!”

&#x200B;

He’s such a good guy.

&#x200B;

I hear his footsteps, slow and heavy against the floorboards as he approaches. A gust of cold, Fall air is sent rushing into the room and I suppress a shiver, goosebumps shooting up my arms as I ease my hand through the pumpkin’s mouth to clear a space for the candle.

&#x200B;

“How was your day?” I ask, as I hear him enter the room behind me.

&#x200B;

“I have something for you”, he says, his voice low.

&#x200B;

“Oh?” I stand up with a little exhale and wipe my hands on a nearby towel, turning to face him.

&#x200B;

And I watch as he dumps, with a grunt, the lifeless body of a child to the floor. He crouches down and pulls a bag off the kid’s head, and then he looks up at me with a slow, dark smile.

&#x200B;

Time stops.

&#x200B;

I feel the blood drain from my body. I am vaguely aware of the knife slipping from my hand, clattering as it lands by my feet. 

“Max…” I mutter. “Max, what the hell is this? What- what have you done?”

&#x200B;

Confusion flickers across his face. “Eh? What do you mean? I did what you asked,  didn’t I? What difference is this one to all the others?”

I point at the kid’s face, angry. “What difference? This is a BOY, Max. What the fuck am I supposed to do with a BOY? Did I or did I not specify GIRLS, Max? GIRLS ONLY”.

Max winces and rubs his chin with embarrassment. “Right, oh yeah, sorry babe”.

I put a hand to my forehead and let out a sigh, heartrate returning steadily to normal. “Look, it’s fine, okay? It’s fine. But please, don’t make this mistake again. It’s such a waste. Just throw him out back with the rest of them, I guess”.

“Alright”, he says, apologetically. “Sorry”.

I reach down to collect the knife. “And pass me another pumpkin? A fresh one, I’m nearly done here”.

He raises an eyebrow and shakes his head. “I wish you wouldn’t call them ‘pumpkins’. It’s so creepy”.

I put my hands on my hips as he relents, walking over to the corner and grabbing up one of the pumpkins by the hair, dumping her onto my table in front of me with a little splat. He grabs the poor boy under the shoulder and hoists him up, heading out round the back to the garden.

I shake my head and grab up the serrated knife.

No time to waste. The trick or treaters will be here soon.

&#x200B;

So I set to work. Sliding in the knife with a crack, and a crunch.
