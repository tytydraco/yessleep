The lights are off. The heat is gone. I can hear the windows cracking from the cold. I’ve locked the doors, put on as many warm clothes as I can find and now I’m just waiting this out. In the back of my mind, I can’t help but wonder if I’m going to die here… And I suppose that’s why I’m writing all of this down. Just in case…

&#x200B;

I’ve got half a mind to try and make a run for it. Grab a knife from the kitchen and try to make it to the car, but I don’t think that’s going to work. Even if I could make it, I’m not sure if I could drive through this snow. Besides, the car must be completely buried by now… No, no, no… It has to be safer to stay here. Wait it out. He can’t stay out there forever… He can’t.

&#x200B;

I want to make it very clear that I don’t think that I did anything wrong. A lot of people said we were ‘scum’ or ‘monsters’ for what we did. But they were just reacting to a story that was twisted to make us seem like the villains. We did the right thing, and people said we were monsters because of it.

&#x200B;

My boyfriend, Scott, and I used to volunteer for a few local animal rights groups before they asked us to leave. Even then, that was just because people made them do it. They never said a word before about some of the public protests we did, hell, a few of them were completely on board with it when we did our grocery store protest! We went to various grocery stores and spilled buckets of fake blood on the meat section to illustrate the horrors of the meat industry. 

&#x200B;

They never said a word when we held a public demonstration showing the graphic details of milk and veal production outside of an elementary school to try and educate the younger generation on the violence they were choosing to perpetuate against animals. But no. All of that was fine up until some people online got upset over one homeless guy and his dog.

&#x200B;

We’d seen him around countless times before. He was an older man, somewhere in his sixties and usually hung out around one of the local shopping malls. On a lot of winters nights, you’d find him in the doorway, bundled up tight and holding that dog of his close. He’d usually ask if you could: *“Spare some change for me and my girl?”* but most people ignored him.

&#x200B;

That dog of his always looked sick. Of course it was sick. The old man obviously couldn’t care for it. I can’t imagine he was feeding it very well and I think it was pretty transparent that he was only using it to garner sympathy for his begging. 

&#x200B;

Somebody had to do something. So, that’s what we did.

&#x200B;

Scott and I approached him about a year ago and offered to take the dog off his hands. We promised we’d get it some food and some shelter. We’d even offered him some money for her. He’d just sort of smiled at us and said:

&#x200B;

  “That’s kind of you. I appreciate it… But I don’t think I could part with her. Y’know, she’s been with me since my wife passed. Having her around is probably the only thing that gets me through the day.” He’d laughed at that, as if it were funny. The old dog had looked up at him, tail wagging slightly and he’d scratched it behind the ears.

&#x200B;

  “And it doesn’t bother you that by keeping her, you’re making her suffer?” I asked.

  “I do my best to take care of her.” He said, “We split the food we get. I make sure she’s fed, make sure she’s cared for as best I can. Maybe we don’t have a lot, but we’ve got each other.”

  “That’s not an answer though!” I’d argued, “Look, we’re offering you money for the dog. Just take it, and we can put her in a better home!”

&#x200B;

His eyes had narrowed at that.

  “I’m not just going to sell her to you.” He’d said, “I’m sorry, but I don’t want your money.”

  “Then don’t take it, just give us the dog so we can help it!” I’d said. As I’d spoken, I’d noticed Scott getting closer to him. The Old Man took a step away from us. I could see his body tensing up in fear.

  “If you don’t leave me alone, I’ll call mall security on you.” He’d warned, and that had been the last straw for Scott. He’d made a grab at the dog, trying to tear it out of the old mans grasp. He’d fought back of course, but Scott was stronger. 

&#x200B;

When the Old Man tried to pull the dog back, Scott gave him three hard hits to the face. The first one broke his nose. The second one made the Old Man back off and the third one sent him to the ground.   


Scott ripped the dog away from him, although I will admit that he wasn’t really holding it well. He had it by the neck and the poor thing was squirming in his grasp. I was quick to take it from him as he stood over the old man, who meekly reached out to us.

  *“Give…”* He rasped, voice wet and raspy. He tried to stand again, but Scott sent him back to the ground with another punch. 

&#x200B;

We took off after that, leaving the old bastard on the ground and that should’ve been the end of it.

&#x200B;

The police had stopped by our house a few days after the incident. Apparently, the Old Man was trying to press charges. Then of course there was the hate mail that we got once people started hearing about what we’d done. 

&#x200B;

We answered the police’s questions, Scott said that the Old Man had attacked him first and that he was obviously completely crazy and I’d backed him up. It didn’t change anything. Just because we’d rescued a dog from some old man with dementia, we were suddenly the worst people on earth! 

&#x200B;

We just sorta tried not to pay any attention to it. People get riled up over the stupidest things, but I won’t pretend it didn’t screw up our lives a little. The group we were volunteering with told us we were no longer members, we tried to volunteer with a different group but they wouldn’t let us work with them.

&#x200B;

In the end the whole uproar over the event was for nothing. The Police said they were going to give the Old Man back his dog, but the shelter we’d sent the dog to ended up putting it down after nobody wanted to adopt it. Honestly, the poor thing was probably better off.

&#x200B;

We were banned from the mall after that particular incident, although I saw a post on Facebook a few months ago saying that the Old Man had passed away. He’d been caught in a blizzard one night and been found the next morning. Good riddance, if you ask me. 

&#x200B;

Scott and I were still keeping a low profile, but we were both sort of hoping that with the old man finally dead, this whole stupid thing might finally blow over. 

&#x200B;

It was his idea to do the holiday ski trip. After the shitty year we’d had, he thought it might be a nice, private and romantic way to end the year. I absolutely agreed. My boyfriend is more of an outdoorsman than I am, so while a private cabin in the woods with no wifi is more his idea of a good time than mine, I was still happy to give it a try.

&#x200B;

The first couple of weeks actually went well. We went skiing and snowshoeing, we spent our nights together doing puzzles and reading books. The rest of the world seemed so far away from us and it was a nice change of pace. We’d had a quiet little Christmas together and were hunkering down to have ourselves a quiet little New Years too when the storm had hit.

&#x200B;

The storm really shouldn’t have been that much of a setback. We’d known the kind of weather that could hit us and we had a laptop with some movies downloaded onto it to keep us occupied through the night. It was getting pretty late, a little closer to midnight and we were drinking vegan hot chocolate and cuddled up on the couch. It seemed like a nice way to ring in the new year.

&#x200B;

That was when the power went out. 

&#x200B;

The lights flickered and went dark around us. The laptop was still playing the movie, although Scott paused it to look around. We both sat in silence for a little bit before he got up. I watched as he used his phone as a flashlight to find the breaker panel in the next room. I could hear him flicking the switches, but the lights didn’t come back.

&#x200B;

  “No luck?” I asked.

  “It’s not the breakers…” He said, trying a few others, “Could be a powerline went down, maybe?”

  “Shit, I hope not.” I said, “How long would they even take to get that fixed?”

  “I don’t know.” He said, before sighing. “Well shit.”

I hugged him from behind and planted a kiss on his shoulder.

&#x200B;

  “We can make do.” I said, “We’ve still got the laptop and I know a couple of fun things we could do in the dark.” 

  “Do you now?” He asked, before chuckling, “It’d be a hell of a way to ring in the new year.”

&#x200B;

He kissed me, before grabbing a beer from the fridge and heading back to the couch. I heard him opening the bottle before watching him pause in front of the window by the couch. The light from the laptop screen illuminated him from behind, casting his shadow through the small living area we had.

&#x200B;

  “Hey, Wynita?” He said, “There’s a guy out there.”

  “A guy?” I asked, walking into the living room with him. It was hard to really see anything outside of the frosted window. The angry flurry of snow outside was really the only thing visible.

&#x200B;

  “Are you screwing with me?” I asked warily.

  “No, I swear there’s a guy out there!” Scott said. I got closer to the window to peer out, and when I actually looked, I really could almost swear that I did see something out there… It was hard to say if it was a person or not but, well… It sort of looked like one. But who the hell would be standing out there in that cold?

  “There’s no way anybody’s out there…” I said, “It’s got to be a tree or something.”

  “Wynita, it’s not a tree.” He said, “There’s a man out there, I’m telling you!”

&#x200B;

He stepped away from the window, going to grab his coat and boots.

  “Where are you going?” I asked and tried to follow him, only to slam my little toe against the edge of the nearby coffee table. 

&#x200B;

  “You okay?” He asked, pausing to check on me.

  “I’m fine! Where are you going?” I demanded.

  “There’s a guy out there! We can’t just leave him!”

  “There’s nobody out there!” I snapped, “Even if there was, why would we let him in?”

  “He’s going to freeze if we don’t.”

  “Yeah, and you’re going to freeze if you go out there.” I said, “Just leave it. It’s like 11 at night. We’re in the middle of nowhere. There’s nobody outside!”

I saw him hesitate for a moment before continuing to put his boots and coat on.

  “I’m just going out to be sure.” He said.

&#x200B;

I was kinda done arguing with him at this point. I sat down to wait for the throbbing pain in my toe to go away and just quietly resigned myself to the fact that this is what happens when you date a guy who’s got more muscles than brains. I already knew that in a minute or so he’d come back in complaining about how cold it was, admit that there was nobody outside and that would be it. We would continue watching our movie in peace and maybe, just maybe we’d have some fun ringing in the new year before calling it a night. 

&#x200B;

I stared out the window, watching as Scotts approached the shape in the distance. The raging flurries quickly swallowed him up and he barely seemed to be a few feet from the door before I couldn’t even see his bright red coat through the snow.

&#x200B;

I stared into the whiteout, listening to the howling of the wind and waiting for Scott to come back. 

&#x200B;

But he never did.

&#x200B;

The snow stuck to the window, making it harder and harder to see outside, but I didn’t see a single trace of Scott's red coat outside and after a few minutes, the worry began to set in. What the hell was taking him so long? Was he okay? Did something happen? I stared out into the snowstorm but I saw nothing. Just a vague shape in the distance that vaguely resembled a man… And the longer I stared at that shape, the more certain I was that I’d been wrong.

&#x200B;

The way it seemed to move slightly, the way it held itself…

&#x200B;

There was no way it was just a tree or something like that, it had to be a person! It had to be! But who the hell would be standing out there during this kind of weather? And why hadn’t Scott reached them? It didn’t make any sense to me! None of this made any sense!

&#x200B;

I checked my watch. Fourteen minutes until midnight. It was around that time that the laptops power suddenly died. I remember the light had flickered off without warning and I’d looked over at the dead computer before trying to turn it on again. We’d had a full battery when the power had gone out, and that couldn’t have been twenty minutes ago! This laptop had never had battery issues before, why wasn’t it turning on? I hit the power button, but the screen remained dark. The room around me felt colder too. 

&#x200B;

I looked out the window again and this time, felt my heart skip a beat in my chest as I realized that the shape that I’d thought was a man had gotten closer.

&#x200B;

I stared at it, knowing without a doubt that there was another person out there now… And tried to figure out why he didn’t seem to even notice the cold. He just stood there, bundled up in what looked like a flimsy jacket with a worn grey scarf.

&#x200B;

I couldn’t see his face clearly, but I couldn’t shake that there was something familiar about him. He was holding something in his arms but I couldn’t see it clearly either. I watched him take slow, deliberate steps toward the window. The snow should’ve been hard to walk in, but it barely even seemed to inconvenience him. He just leisurely strolled closer like he was coming by to ask for a cup of sugar. But no matter how close he got, I still couldn’t tell where I recognized him from… Not until I saw the dog…

&#x200B;

I only realized that it was a dog when I saw it move. He’d been holding it close to his chest like a baby and it had lifted its snout to lick at his face. He’d given it a reassuring pat as he’d drawn closer. I still couldn’t see his face clearly, but I didn’t need to… I saw enough through the shadows to recognize the Old Man from the mall. The one whos dog we’d saved.

&#x200B;

The one who’d died almost a year ago.

&#x200B;

He stopped several feet away from the window. I couldn’t see his eyes through the darkness and the snow, but I could see the eyes of the dog. That dog stared at me, its expression vacant… It looked dead, although it still moved like it was alive. The man gave it an absentminded scratch behind the ear. He didn’t take another step closer. He just stood there, staring at me through the snow.

&#x200B;

I saw the first crack shoot across the glass of the window. The air around me felt colder than it had before, and with a deep, quiet terror welling up in my chest I tore myself away from the window and the old man. 

&#x200B;

I ran for the front door, making sure that it was locked before running around back to check that door too. No one should’ve been getting inside! I went back to the living room to check and ensure that the old man hadn’t moved. He hadn’t… Yet… But that didn’t really set me at ease. I still tried to stare at him, trying to be defiant despite the way that my heart thudded anxiously in my chest. 

&#x200B;

He stared at me through the window, petting his cold, dead dog all the while.

  “You’re not going to get me…” I said under my breath, “You’re dead… You’re not going to get me…” 

Saying it out loud didn’t help it feel true.

&#x200B;

The fire that Scott and I had stoked earlier had died down and from the corner of my eye, I watched it flicker away. The embers glowed for only a minute or so before even they seemed to sizzle out.   
With the fire gone, the air around me felt so much colder. I could see my breath now. The cottage hadn’t always been this cold. Why was it this cold now? I caught myself shivering, and tore the blankets off the couch. No way in hell was I going to stay downstairs where he could see me! I needed to get away from him! So I did the only thing that made sense. I went upstairs and I locked myself in the bedroom.

&#x200B;

That’s where I am now.

&#x200B;

I’ve got my coat, my sweater and two sets of blankets on me… But they aren’t helping. The cold is cutting right through me, but I need to make it through. I don’t know what’s going on here… If I’m being haunted by a ghost, or if this is some sick fucks idea of a joke. I don’t care either. I’m not going to let it get the better of me! I’m better than that! It’s 2 in the morning. I’m cold. I’m alone. But I’m not going to let this get the better of me!

&#x200B;

I think if I can make it until morning, then he’ll be gone. Then I can get in the car and leave this fucking place. I’m feeling a little warmer now, I’m going to try and sleep for a bit. Then tomorrow, I’ll have a good laugh about this whole thing.

*This journal was discovered on the body of 24 year old Wynita Sexton on January 2nd, 2023. Sexton was found in the bedroom of a cottage she had rented, wrapped in several blankets and covered in snow from the broken bedroom window. Sexton's boyfriend, Scott Johnson was found buried in a snowdrift outside the door of the cottage.*

&#x200B;

*Despite the contents of Sexton's letter, Police have theorized that Sexton had knowingly locked Johnson out of the cottage during the storm during some sort of psychotic break and that Johnson may have shattered the windows in an effort to get back in.
