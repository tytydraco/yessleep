Here’s a recollection of the scariest experience I’ve ever witnessed.  

It all started some time ago, during the closing weekend of the Northern Zone rifle season in New York. The sun sets around 4:30, but it’s already pitch black by 4:00. I figured freezing my ass off wasn’t worth another fifteen minutes of hunting.

I climbed down from the frigid tree stand, my back turned to the dark, silent forest. Normally, the walk back to the main road takes about ten minutes, but it took me an hour. Whether it was the darkness, the cold, or sheer exhaustion, I lost my way. And, like a hungry lion, the forest seemed to swallow me whole.

Stumbled through the mud-covered snow, my white knuckles growing even paler as my grip tightened around my rifle. The sounds around me were faint—the hostile wind whipping through the forest, the soft clink of my bullets in my pocket—until, suddenly, I heard it.

A sound I’d never forget. A sound that still haunts me to this day—the cry of an infant. Wailing, calling for a mother who wasn’t there. I froze in my tracks, but only for a moment. Then I started walking faster, breaking into a light jog. The rational part of me insisted it was just some half-starved coyotes, scavenging for any scraps to ease their shriveled stomachs. But deep down, I knew that was the biggest load of bullshit on God’s green earth.

After running for fifteen minutes, I stopped to catch my breath, gasping for air in the cold, icy wind. When I finally lifted my head, I realized just how complete the darkness around me was, my headlamp barely making a dent. My phone had never been great in the woods, but I’d always managed to get a signal when I needed it. This time, though, my phone wouldn’t even turn on.

Then, I heard something that shook me even more than the infant’s cry—the voice of a woman, coming from deep within the woods. At first, it was a light, almost gleeful laugh, but then came words, chilling in their calmness.

“Hello. I see you. You know that, right?”

Her voice had a strange, twisted cheerfulness to it—like she was savoring my fear. If I hadn’t been running before, I was certainly sprinting now. The forest around me seemed to come alive with an unsettling chorus of laughter, cries, and agony. The sounds of an unseen symphony wailed into the night, each note a twisted blend of every human emotion, harmonizing into a singular, horrifying sound of pure terror.

Then it stopped.

Silence closed in around me as I took in my surroundings— a clearing I didn’t recognize, yet somehow felt familiar, like it had lived in a dream I couldn’t quite recall. The clearing was barren, save for a stark white tree standing alone in the middle of the muddy landscape. Its twisted branches reached upward, as if grasping for an unseen place, a place not meant for human eyes. The tree was a grisly tangle of knotted branches, skeletal white bark, and an unsettling, silent aversion. I took a step closer, my hand reaching out, yearning for something that wasn’t there. At the center of the tree, a crude drawing was carved—a rough outline of a human female, her form distorted and unnatural. Her hair ran down to the roots of the tree, disappearing underneath miles of bloody soil. Perhaps the most chilling detail of all was the ex carved into her chest, right where her heart should have been. Jutting out from the ex, right where the lines intersected, was a rusty nail driven deep into the tree’s surface. Finally, my hand reached its destination—the head of the nail protruding from the bark which released from the tree like a knife slowly pulling free from a slab of meat.

Then, I snapped out of my trance, realizing the stream of crimson blood oozing from the tiny hole in the tree. As soon as it hit my mud-crusted boots, I heard it—a blood-curdling scream echoing from the woodline behind me. It didn’t sound human... but it didn’t quite sound like an animal either.

I bolted through the forest, crashing into the godforsaken trees as I went. My frantic flight through the woods abruptly ended with just a few more steps. I stumbled out onto the dirt road, falling onto my rifle as I tripped, finally reaching the path that led to my truck. I jumped into the cab, slammed the engine to life, and sped down the road. I’d never felt such relief in my life as I saw the familiar outline of my small house in the distance. 

Even now, six years later, I’m not ashamed to admit that I’ve never been hunting since—or even set foot in the woods, for that matter. But every once in a while, on a cold winter’s night, I’ll hear something in my yard—or sometimes even from behind my window. A voice I’ll never forget, whispering something that haunts me to this day:

“Hello. I see you. You know that, right?”
