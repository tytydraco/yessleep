Before I start this is the first time I’m every sharing this experience it’s been my closest call to being in harms way. It left me completely shaken up. I’m 21 now this took place in my hometown a small non violent town in north east Texas named mount Vernon. I was 16 just got my drivers license that year. I was going to the store down the road a mile or so and it was raining outside. There was a dark skinned man walking it was dark outside and he was walking underneath a street light. Me trying to be nice and wasn’t thinking I stopped and asked if he’s alright. He said he needed a ride so me being the teenager I was I allowed him to get in my moms car. 


I took him to the store and he then asked me once he reentered the car if I smoked weed. I did and have been for a year or two, so without hesitation I said yes I do, he said he has some at his grandparents house and asked me to drive him to it. I followed his instructions and he brought me to this abandoned house, I knew this house cause I’m familiar with the town and knew it was abandoned me being a stupid kid I didn’t realize these red flags he started making small talk and we was just talking and I looked in the rear view mirror and could see him in the back stroking his penis from the outside of his pants. 


I started getting creeped out and acted like I didn’t see, I asked about the weed and he said he would get it in a second but then changed the conversation to asking me if I liked to party. I said I party sometimes with my friends and then he out of nowhere asked if I would jerk him off. I said nah I’m not into that I asked if he could get out but he said no. He proceeded to ask if I would suck his dick or let him fuck me and even just watch him maaturbate. After the first weird remark he made I had a metal pen of my moms in my hand but luckily a cop came from nowhere and slowly drives by I saw him looking around watching the cop I asked him to get out and he did after he saw the cop gone. 


I got out of there as fast as humanly possible I noticed he had something in his pants I couldn’t tell what it was but my guess could only be some kind of weapon. From this day I haven’t ever talked to anyone or offered anyone a ride since. I’m glad nothing bad happened but I can only think how lucky I was to get out alive and well. He ended up being related to a neighbor of mine and living next to me a year later but that is a story for another time please don’t talk or give rides to strangers you never know who they really are
