Yesterday I was at the dentist to get my lower teeth extracted until they gave me the news that I needed an x-ray. A few days later I went out to live my regular day and regular life but out of nowhere my mother asked me if I wanted to get the x-ray done today, so obviously I said yes to get it done and to save time.



 We found a mall that contained a dental clinic in which it was available. However this place had looked like it'd been abandoned, although there was a friendly woman who worked there. She put this vest on me and took me to the room to get my x-ray done. I happily follow her despite getting an eerie feeling about this place. I felt uncomfortable in this area. I hear her say sit and bite down on a plastic object. I do as she says, her last order was for me to close my eyes so I do just that. I had no idea it was going to be the most traumatic experience I've had in my life.



I hear the x-ray machine say it was moving to its proper position and to wait for a while. A few minutes go by and it's finally ready. The lazer goes across my face and I feel a burning sensation. I thought this was normal so I said nothing until it goes across again and I feel unbearable pain in my face. I move away from the machine and I look in the mirror only to be horrified with what I see. My face has been completely skinned down to the bone and muscle. My mother screamed in horror but I saw the lady who did my "x-ray" and she was smiling, but it was this inhuman smile the corners of her mouth went up to her ears. Almost as if she had slit the corners of her mouth to make it look like that. I felt blood dripping down my neck and clothes.The woman looked at me happily knowing what she had just done. 



After 3 months of being in the hospital to get my face fixed, I still live in horror of that specific event that I had gone through. Sometimes I wish that I had said no to going to get that x-ray. I regret every second of my decision and I wish I could go back in time to say no. 



It’s been a few weeks since I’ve gotten out of the hospital. My mother said we had to go to that mall, but as soon as she said those words I felt a chill run down my spine and a sense of horror. I asked her what the reason was for us to go to this hell of a mall. I felt relieved as she said only to get groceries. I got ready and left my house.



My mother is usually a very talkative person, however, when we were in the car she didn’t say a word to me. On regular days we’d have long conversations about our lives. I started to get nervous so I tapped her on the shoulder. I got shocked or startled as she grabbed my hand swiftly, almost inhumanly. She said in a deep, loud, nearly demonic voice to not touch her and she continued driving. After what seemed like an eternity we arrived at the mall. I got out of the car to my surprise, she violently grabbed my wrist and told me to do as she says in that same tone. I started panicking as we approached that same goddamn dentist. It was that same woman that I thought was friendly last time. They strapped me down to a bed as I started panicking and moving around, trying to be freed but it was too late. That lazer went over my entire body this time, not just my face. I felt as if I was dying in flames. It went on for exactly ⅗ minutes. At that point I was on the verge of death due to blood loss and being skinned to the bone. I was there lying helplessly on that bed. I looked at my mom and that woman, their eyes were completely gone and replaced with black holes as if their eye sockets were just lifeless voids, they were both smiling that same terrifying inhuman smile. 



Blood was dripping down the bed and my body I started sobbing, the tears went down my face, it felt like pouring hot magma on my face. It was burning me. At that point I couldn't take it anymore. I grabbed my hunting knife I carry with me for self-defense and stabbed myself. I vividly remember this from my past life. I was a 19 year old girl. My name was Audrey Connor. I lived in California with my loving family. I had 2 brothers and a mother and father when that event happened. I’m now a 27 year old man living in Yorkshire, England. The memory of this event lives in my head and has been living in my head since I was 14. I've told my parents but they don’t believe me despite the police having found a case about that exact event with that exact person’s name. That case has remained unsolved for 2 years. I remember every detail of what happened then. It was traumatic. I hate having to remember and think about it everyday. I wish it could just be erased from my memory. Nobody ever believes me when i explain this to them.
