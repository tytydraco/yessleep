Have you ever had sciatica? I have. A puffed out slipped disc on one side, solid bone on the other, and my sciatic nerve smushed in between. You may have a bad back but it’s probably not ‘feels like there’s a white hot corkscrew being twisted in my spine’ bad. Mine was. 



Surgery was an inevitability. No amount of touching my toes with a physio or chiropractic snake oil would *ever* be enough; no, if I was *ever* to stop feeling as though my back was being sliced open then I would, ironic as it may be, need my back to be sliced open, and sliced open it was.



Of course I was asleep for the whole thing. Funnily enough, I can distinctly remember when I was put under, my anaesthetised subconscious subjecting me to ethereal visions of my back being split apart, hunks of flesh and viscera torn back like teeth pulling meat off of a chicken wing’s bone, only to look back and find my mangled traps and lats gone, replaced, no less, with the wings of a raven. Drugs are, and I cannot stress this enough, a hell of a thing. I barely had a moment of lucidity between the moment I was put under and the moment I arrived home and collapsed in bed, little orange bottle of oxy in hand. 



Down the hatch.



And, oh man, if you thought the anaesthetics were something, boy, oxy is something else. Warmth, fuzziness, numbness, serenity, cessation of *everything*. No thought, no pain, no troubles. There was no doubt in my mind as to why people couldn’t get enough of this stuff but, as for me, the doc had decided two weeks worth well constituted ‘enough’. 



Sprawled out in bed, empty water bottles littering the floor, the dim glow of the TV and the almost hypnotic procession of queued up films whose mere titles even would be naught but the faintest of memories by the time the next pill went down the hatch. 

Lucky for me I had Kate. When I needed food, it was Kate who fed me. When I needed clothes, it was Kate who dressed me. You get the picture. Luckily any reservations I may have had concerning being ostensibly babied by my own sister during this period were washed away with the oxy down my throat.



I’ve told you once and I’ll tell you again, drugs are a hell of a thing. Sometimes it seems there’s nothing they can’t do; drugs can heal wounds, erase pain, sharpen the mind, cure diseases… but there are things even drugs can’t do, which is why I simply cannot chock up my story to some drugged up hallucination. It’s just not possible.



On Day Four I heard a knock at the door. Knock. Knock. Knock. Not Kate. Kate had a key, no need to knock. Mind you, I had little interest in who was at my door then; I was in no condition to even *open it* after all. 



Knock. Knock. Knock. Once more, a little bit louder. I just tried to ignore it.



Knock. Knock. Knock. Once again, even more forceful. Had I had a mind beneath the opiate haze I may have had half a mind to shout and holler and shoo them off.



Knock. Knock. Crash. Beeps, whines, whirs. I could hear the cacophony of twinkling shards skittering across the floor. The window. Click, clack. The lock. Creak. The door. 



‘Front, door, open,’ the security system spat in that stilted cadence of theirs, and soon the shrill whine of the alarm began ringing in my ears. 



Someone- some*thing*\- was inside. 



Clomp. Clomp. Clomp. I could hear the sound of ‘footsteps’ thudding across the floor below. My ears were assaulted by the deafening sound of crashes and bangs, cupboards being flung open and objects being smashed against the floor. 



I, however, was silent as a strange and dizzying cocktail of adrenaline and oxycodone flooded my system. Whoever it was, *whatever* it was, was *tearing* the place apart. Even from a floor up I could hear the sound of ceramic being cracked against the hardwood floor, cabinets being ripped off their little metal hinges, cutlery clattering on the ground…



Enough was enough.



I don’t know why- blame the drugs, I guess- but at that point I simply couldn’t take this any more, and rather than ring up the cops or text Kate, my first instinct was to call out, to shout, to scream: “Hello? Hello?!”



Silence. At least, at first. Then came a voice, not my voice, but from below. It was a voice so deep and so thick and so congealed and distorted the only way I can think to describe it would be like trying to scream with your head submerged in melted wax. 



Boom. Boom. Boom. Footsteps, up the stairs now. Coming. It was coming. Round the first bend, round the second bend. It was at the door, my door, it was outside. 



I nearly lept out of my skin as my bedroom door swung open, *smashing* the doorknob into the drywall which utterly crumpled around the metal. But, there was no one. Nothing. All that stood outside the door was the closet on the other side of the hall. But, make no mistake: it was there. It was there and it was getting closer. The footsteps were in the room now, then they were at my bed. It was at my bed. It was standing there, it was looking down at me.



But it didn’t end there. It didn’t stop *at* my bed, it got *in*\- or rather *on*\- my bed, and more specifically, on *me*. While my eyes could see nothing amiss it felt as though a great scruffy grizzly bear had rolled on top of me in the throes of hibernation. It was warm, and felt fuzzy, and it was breathing. I could feel it expanding and contracting, growing and shrinking, breaths in, breaths out, as it lay on top of me.



As for me, I couldn’t even begin to *think* of breathing. The great, big, heavy bitch of a thing was on top of me. My lungs could hardly expand and air could hardly enter my body. Even worse, my spine, by then about as fragile as a rotted-through toothpick, was being crushed under the weight of this thing. It felt like my back was a flimsy piece of straw being crushed under the wheels of the farmer’s tractor, except if that piece of straw was filled with brittle bone and raw nerves. This thing, this *thing*, this *beast*, felt as the camel that would break my straw back. It was only a matter of time before something gave out, I just didn’t know which would come first: my back or my lungs.



It was there on the edge of passing out, passing out from pain and passing out from a very severe lack of oxygen, that I heard the screams: “Alex? Alex?!”



Kate. It was Kate. She’d later tell me she’d rushed over as soon as she’d received the alert from the alarm system, and she didn’t get there a moment too soon.



With Kate’s shouts, *it* finally rose. I coughed and spluttered, trying as hard as I could to catch my breath, my chest now throbbing so intensely even through the haze of painkillers I had worried I’d snapped a rib.



Thud. Thud. Thud. Off the bed. It was leaving the room- not just leaving, but running. I could hear it sprinting, sprinting out of the room, sprinting down the hall, sprinting down the stairs, and with one more great thud, I could hear it no more. It was gone.



When Kate found me, the police were already well on their way. To say my home was a mess was to put it more lightly than lightly. I saw the pictures. My window was shattered. My front door was thrown open so forcefully one of the brass hinges had snapped. *Every* cabinet was open and *all* of their contents had been warped and bent and broken against the floor.



Police said ‘home invasion’. I didn’t fight them; I had neither the energy nor the desire to. And maybe, just maybe, I’d accept that as all this was: some freak burglary, and all that ‘invisible invader’ stuff was just my drugged out mind playing tricks on me. I *would* accept that, if not for one thing- one tiny, purple, yellowish blotch of a bruise on Kate’s right elbow. A bruise she got as she stood in my doorway, shattered glass all around her feet, chaos and devastation as far as her eyes could see, that something, something she *couldn’t* see, something she *swore* she couldn’t see, knocked her clean over as it burst out of the front doorway and into the crisp, autumn night.



Trust me: as much as I’d love to simply put all of this behind me, I simply can’t do that because there simply is nothing *simple* about this. Don’t ask me why, because I don’t know why, but it’s going to come back. It wasn’t done; it didn’t finish. It was interrupted. 



I can lose all the sleep in the world over this. I could fix all the windows and doors, install new locks, a new security system, cameras, the works- which I have- but none of that will change the fact that I *know* it’s going to come back, it’s only a matter of when. All I can do now is sit, wait, and prepare. Because I know it’s not done with me. Not yet.
