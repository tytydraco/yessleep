I’ve worked as a cemetery groundskeeper for four years now.  
Hillrest Memorial Gardens — about sixty acres, old enough that some of the headstones are barely readable anymore.

Most people think that kind of job would get to you, but it never did. Night shift is quiet. Peaceful, even. The dead don’t complain, don’t judge you, don’t make small talk. At least, that’s what I used to believe.

I work Tuesday and Thursday nights, 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. My supervisor, Glenn, usually hands me the work orders before heading home. That Thursday night was no different. Three graves to dig in section G before the rain hit. Routine work.

By a little after midnight, I’d finished two of them. I was heading back to prep for the third when my phone buzzed with an email from the cemetery’s administrative system.

**Urgent additional work order.**

That happens sometimes. Unexpected deaths, last-minute scheduling changes. I opened it without thinking.

Plot G51.  
Service time: Friday, 10:00 a.m.

Name: **David Reyes**.

My name.

Same spelling. Same middle initial. My birth date was listed correctly too. What stopped my breathing was the death date — the day before.

I assumed it was a glitch. A sick coincidence. But then I noticed the family contact number.

It was my mother’s.

I tried calling Glenn. Voicemail. Tried the admin office. No answer. It was nearly 1 a.m.

I told myself I was being stupid and drove over to plot G51 just to prove it wasn’t real.

The grave was already dug.

Six feet deep. Clean edges. Fresh dirt piled neatly beside it. A temporary marker stood at the head of the plot with my name, birth date, and death date printed neatly on it.

I don’t remember backing away, only realizing I was shaking so badly I could barely stand.

Then the emails started coming in.  
One every few seconds.

More work orders. More names. Glenn. An admin assistant. A few regular visitors I recognized. All with death dates in the coming days. All scheduled for burial.

I turned my phone off and tried to leave.

That’s when I saw lights on in section M — excavator lights.

Glenn was there, digging. Or at least someone who looked exactly like him. Same uniform. Same posture. But his movements were wrong. Stiff. Empty. He didn’t respond when I shouted his name.

Then another excavator started.  
Then another.

All across the cemetery.

As I ran past section G, I looked at the graves I’d dug earlier.

Two of them were empty.

Mine wasn’t.

Someone was lying in it.

Me.

Same clothes. Same boots. Even the tear in my sleeve from the fence I caught it on the week before.

When I blinked, the grave was empty again.

I locked myself in the maintenance building and called 911. While I waited, I watched the security monitors. The excavators were still running.

No operators.

Another email came through. One of the names belonged to the responding officer. Death time listed down to the minute.

Twenty minutes later, I watched his cruiser lose control on the wet grass and wrap itself around an oak tree.

Everything after that feels distant. Like I was already gone.

I quit the next day. Glenn’s wife told me he’d died that night — heart attack while driving home. The others followed. Every name from those emails showed up in the obituaries within days.

That was three weeks ago.

I never went back to Hillrest. My mother and I left town. I deleted the email account tied to the cemetery system.

But my work order is still burned into my memory.

According to it, I died Wednesday night.  
My funeral was scheduled for Friday morning.

I didn’t attend.

So technically, I’m already dead.

And lately, I’ve been dreaming of that grave again — lying there, staring up at the sky — and feeling like I forgot something important.

Like someone is still waiting for me to come back and finish my shift.
