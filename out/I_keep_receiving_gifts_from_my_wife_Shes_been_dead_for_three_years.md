It happened on a Tuesday night. My wife had been out jogging when a drunk driver hit her head-on. She was dead before she hit the ground. At least, that’s what the cops told me. 

I moved into my parents’ place for support. But no amount of help could replace Meg, the beautiful woman who had given birth to our daughter, Isla. Three years later, I was still shaken by her death. 

But what happened next hurt me so much more and threatened to rip apart my sanity. It started on a frost-bitten morning. 

I had dashed outside, late for work, and noticed a small gift on the hood of my car. 

*What the hell?*

It was a tiny box wrapped in red paper. My wife had always dressed her presents in this way. 

I separated the wrapping from the container and found a small plastic ring inside. It was the same toy jewelry my wife had won at the fair years ago. 

*Are my parents messing with me?* I went back inside. My mother knew nothing about it. I called my dad. He didn’t either.

The only person I could think about was Kate, my wife’s best friend from high school. After Meg and I had started dating, Kate had grown hostile, like she resented me for stealing her closest companion.
When I made the call, her bitterness was evident. 

“Scott, long time no see.”

“Kate… did you leave a gift on my car this morning?”

“What gift?”

“A ring Meg won at the fair.”

“You actually think I put it there?”

“It’s a possibility… to torment me.”

“Scott, we’ve never liked each other. But I’d never do something like that. It’s crazy.”

Over the coming weeks, I started receiving more gifts. Each one was something only my wife and I could have known about: gifts from past dates, oddities we’d picked up during our travels. 

It was all so strange. I tried ignoring them. But when one appeared at my daughter’s preschool, it was too much.

“Someone left Mr. Fishy on my desk,” Isla sobbed, curled up in my arms after class. “Mr. Fishy was mommy’s favorite. She must’ve put it there, right daddy?”

I called the police, but they just told me, “We’ll keep an eye on it. If we get any information, we’ll call you.”

That was two weeks ago. Thankfully, I got a breakthrough. I dropped off Isla at school and swung by my house to pick up some tools for work. And that’s when I saw it… a massive teddy bear sitting on my doorstep. 

It was the same one I had bought Meg during our first date at the mall twelve years ago. 

*Who else could have known about that?*

Kate… she’d been there that night, shadowing us, making sure Meg and I didn’t get too handsy.

My mind burned with rage. I got in my car, drove across town, and waited at Kate’s place.

About an hour passed and her car arrived. Kate hopped out and went to the door. 

“Kate!” I shouted, my voice chilling the air.

“Scott…” She backed away, lips trembling.

“I know the gifts are coming from you.”  

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“Stop lying!”

I showed her the teddy bear. Her face went blank. “It’s not my fault… I promise… she made me do it…”

“Who?”

“Just come inside.” She motioned to the house. “I’ll explain everything.” 

***

I followed Kate inside and she disappeared down the hall. I was hurt and desperate for answers, so I plopped down on the couch, my eyes focused on every corner.

“Meg,” Kate’s voice drifted into the living room, “your husband’s here.”

*Meg?!*

My throat tightened as footsteps padded down the hall. I stood slowly and saw…

… my wife, Meg, appear from around the corner, still in her jogging attire, the exact outfit she had worn during that fateful night.

“I’m so happy to see you.” She wrapped her arms around me. “Have you enjoyed your gifts?”

I was so shocked I couldn’t speak.

“I’m sorry, Scott.” Kate wandered in. “I should’ve told you as soon as she arrived.” 

*As soon as she arrived?* I turned toward her, confused. “Tell me everything.”

“After Meg’s accident, I felt lost. I had to find some way to bring back a sense of my friend. And that’s when I found him… the man who lives in the woods.” 

I cast a weary glance outside her window. There was a dark forest near her property. Were those the woods she was referring to? 

“He promised to bring her back in exchange for… well... you can probably guess. The only rule is she can’t leave the house. So… she makes gifts for you and your daughter, and I deliver them.”

“It’s true.” Meg smiled. “She’s been helping me this entire time.”

I shrank back, traumatized. “Why didn’t you tell me sooner? Didn’t you think I’d want to know that you were alive?”

“I’m not alive, Sweetie. I’m in the in-between, neither here or there. But we can still be together.” 

Her cold fingers cupped the sides of my face. They felt icy, frost-bitten. And her eyes… there was something off about them… like I was staring into death itself.

“No,” I pulled back, stepping to the door. “This is wrong.”

“Scott, please…”

“You’re not her!”

“Don’t tell anyone else about this, Scott,” Kate pleaded. “You’ll ruin everything.”

“Stay away from me!” I ripped open the door and dashed outside.

***

That was the last time I saw Kate. Several weeks later, I got a call.

“Meet me at Kate’s. Three o’ clock.” 

It was Meg. Her voice sounded so subtle and enchanting.

I fought every impulse to go over and see her. But I had to gain some sort of closure. I had to see if there was some semblance of her still inside. So…

… I drove to Kate’s after work. Made sure my parents could pick up Isla from school so I had a few good hours. 

When I got there and knocked, Meg answered, dressed in the same jogging outfit.  

“Thanks for coming.” She pulled me inside.

I glanced around for signs of Kate. Her car wasn’t in the driveway.

“Where’s your housemate?”

“Don’t worry about her.” Meg caressed the back of my neck. “It’s just you and me now… and Isla. I want you to bring her over, so I can see her. Can you do that for me?”

***

I’m sitting in my car now, typing this on my phone. 

I’m not sure how to move forward. Part of me wants to tell Isla that her mother’s back. But another wants to keep her safe from whatever my wife has become.

What do I do?
