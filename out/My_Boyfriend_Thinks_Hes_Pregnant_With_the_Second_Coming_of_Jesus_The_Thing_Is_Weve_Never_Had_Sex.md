My boyfriend, Chandler, has been adamant that he’s got a bun in the oven. I’ve tried explaining to him that it’s simply not possible, but he won’t listen to me. He swears up and down that he’s with child. And the kicker? He says he’s carrying the second coming of Jesus Christ. Needless to say, this has all been a bit too much to bear.   
  
“Babe, for the last time. You. Are. Not. Pregnant.”  
  
“Oh yeah? Give me one good reason.”  
  
I pursed my lips. Why did I even need to explain this?  
  
“Okay, I’ll give you three. One, you’re a virgin. How the hell would you end up pregnant without having sex?”  
  
He grinned at me smugly. I wanted to slap that stupid smirk right off his goofy face. I just knew that whatever was about to come out of his mouth next would *seriously* piss me off.  
  
“Immaculate conception. This is the second coming of Jesus Christ in here,” he said, lovingly rubbing his belly.   
  
I crinkled my nose. I wasn’t sure whether I was more ticked off or appalled by his revelation.   
  
“You’re joking, right? Please tell me this is all some messed up prank,” I grumbled, shaking my head.   
  
“Nope. I’m completely serious. And your second reason is?”  
  
“Oh, yeah, right. Number two,” I said, feeling my frustration barreling back. “Number two is that you don’t have a fucking uterus. How are you supposed to carry a baby without a uterus, huh?”  
  
“Who’s to say I don’t have a uterus?” Chandler retorted, his nose pointed up to the ceiling.   
  
“Basic biology, idiot. Men don’t have the organs to carry a baby. That’s common sense.”  
  
“Well, this is divine intervention. Maybe I don’t need them. Your argument is falling apart, honey bunch. What’s your final piece of concrete evidence?”  
  
I stared at him, mouth agape. Was he on drugs?   
  
“You’re delusional. You are absolutely psychotic. Okay, smart guy. Assuming your wackadoodle theories are actually worth anything, *this* will be the determining factor,” I said, producing a pregnancy test from the medicine cabinet.   
  
Chandler looked visibly uneasy. I don’t think he ever expected me to poke a hole in his *flawless* logic.   
  
“W-well, I don’t know how to use it,” he proclaimed, smiling wide as if that would get me to throw in the towel.    
  
“There’s instructions on the box, moron. Nice try.”  
  
“Okay, fine. I’ll take your stupid pregnancy test. But just know that if this comes back positive, I’m going to hold it over you until the day you die.”  
  
“Deal. If this, for some magical, impossible reason comes back positive, I will kiss your feet every day for the rest of my life. But it’s *not* going to come back positive,” I proclaimed as my boyfriend stomped into the bathroom.   
  
I was running over in my head how I was going to rub it in his face, when Chandler emerged from the restroom, the little pink test in hand. But instead of moping like I thought he would be, he was grinning from ear to ear. My heart dropped into my stomach. Something was wrong.   
  
“Read it and weep, baby girl,” Chandler boasted, practically shoving the piece of plastic into my face. My blood turned to ice and my vision grew hazy when I saw the results.   
  
Two solid lines… It was positive.   
  
I stumbled over to the kitchen table, pulling out a chair to prevent myself from passing out. It couldn’t be. Anatomically, it was out of the cards. Not possible. Couldn’t happen… But the results showed otherwise.   
  
“What do you have to say to *that*?” Chandler continued, folding his arms across his chest.   
  
“I say it’s a false positive. It has to be. Happens all the time,” I replied, watching his expression falter. That had to be it. A logical explanation to this wild circus act.   
  
“Fine. You don’t believe me? Let’s go to the drug store, then. I’ll take multiple tests. The outcome isn’t going to change.”  
  
“Alright,” I said, regaining my composure. “Let’s go. There’s no way this isn’t some kind of mistake.”  
  
Well, we bought the pregnancy tests. Four of them, to be exact… And they all came back positive. Every. Single. One. We even picked out different brands to add a little variety. What are the odds that five pregnancy tests would give false positives?   
  
“What do you have to say now, genius?” Chandler gloated, tossing the plastic tests into the garbage bin.   
  
“I… I don’t know. Part of me thinks this is all some elaborate hoax, but I can’t figure out what to make of it. It’s just so strange.”  
  
“Strange is an understatement,” Chandler admitted, “But whatever happens, it’ll be alright. I won’t let this come between us.”  
  
I blushed as a smile began to inch across my lips. “Thank you for saying that. You always know what I need to hear. I love you,” I said, wrapping my arms around him.  
  
“Any time, sweetheart. I love you too,” he replied, returning the gesture.   
  
  
\*\*\*  
  
Sunlight beamed into my face, effectively killing any chance I had at returning to sleep. I groaned as I tossed the sheets from my body.   
  
“Hey, what gives?” Chandler mumbled sleepily. He lazily rolled over to grab the blankets. When he did, my eyes grew wide and I nearly threw up.   
  
My boyfriend’s gut was twice the size that it had been the previous day. How was that possible? Even if Chandler was somehow pregnant, it should have taken *months* for him to be that far along.   
  
“B-babe?” I stuttered, my voice quivering.   
  
“Yeah? What’s- wait, what’s wrong? You look petrified.”  
  
I pointed a trembling finger at his torso. Chandler’s jaw fell open when he realized why I was so shaken. I watched as his expression shifted from one of shock to one of… elation? He looked like a kid who’d just received a new Playstation 5 for Christmas.   
  
“Riley, this is amazing! Do you understand what this means? We’re going to be parents soon! Aren’t you excited? We’re going to be famous! Like, Bible2.0 famous!”   
  
“Chandler. Let’s stop and think about this for a second. One, that’s very shallow to say that we would be famous if this insane theory of yours *does* hold water. Two, *if* that’s correct, we should be absolutely terrified. It would probably mean that the rapture is coming, and I don’t know about you, but I’m not ready for that. Best case scenario is this is some kind of parasite and those pregnancy tests were false positives, against all odds. I really think you should see a doctor.”  
  
He sighed, visibly disappointed. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it like that. I let it all get to my head for a second. But this definitely *is* an immaculate conception. I just know it. I can’t go to a doctor because they’ll try to take my baby away. I won’t let that happen,” he said, rubbing his stomach and glancing down at it endearingly. I wanted to be sick.   
  
“You have to go to a doctor. This isn’t normal. We-”  
  
“Riley,” Chandler interjected. “It’s not happening. End of discussion.”  
  
“Okay. Look, I think I’m going to stay at my parents’ house for a few days. This is all just too much right now.” He locked eyes with me despondently.   
  
“I understand. Just don’t stay gone for too long,” he said, puffing out his lower lip dramatically. A pang of guilt struck my chest like a lightning bolt. I did feel bad for leaving, but I *had* to clear my head.   
  
“I won’t. I promise. I love you,” I said, hugging him tightly.   
  
“Good. I love you too, babe.”   
  
I took the following three days off from work. I told my parents that Chandler and I were in the middle of an argument. Mom pressed, but I didn’t dare tell her about my boyfriend’s “pregnancy.” Her judgment was the *last* thing I needed.   
  
After three agonizing days of my mother prying into my personal life to no avail, I decided to go back home. Mom was making my head spin, and I was starting to miss my boyfriend. We hadn’t spent that long away from each other for the entire time we’d been living together.   
  
I pulled into our driveway around nine at night. I exhaled sharply and steeled myself to face my significant other. I *really* hoped he’d seen a doctor like I’d asked. Unfortunately, he hadn’t.   
  
“Babe, I’m home,” I yelled, hanging my coat on the rack.   
  
“Oh, thank goodness. I’ve missed you so much. Please don’t leave me alone like that again,” Chandler said, emerging into the foyer.   
  
My face drained of color. The only sound I could hear was the blood rushing in my ears. I fell back against the door for support so that I wouldn’t faint.  
  
Chandler’s stomach was massive. It was at least the size of a large watermelon. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. He was about to pop.   
  
“Ch-Chandler. You *need* to see a specialist or something. We have to get you to the emergency room.” His demeanor shifted from warm and welcoming to cold and disgruntled.   
  
“Riley, I already told you. I can’t do that. They’ll take our baby. If I-”  
  
“No. I’m giving you a choice. Either you see a medical professional, or we are done. I can’t take this. We need to know what’s going on. And I won’t accept ‘divine intervention’ as a legit answer. Got it?”  
  
“Yeah. I got it,” he mumbled, staring at his feet.   
  
“Well? What’s it gonna be?” I demanded, tapping my foot impatiently.  
  
He glanced up at me with tears in his eyes. “Fine. I’ll see a doctor tomorrow, but I *will not* let them take my child from me. Happy now?”  
  
“Yes, I am. Thank you for seeing reason. Now, I’m going to bed. I’ve got work tomorrow, and it’s already been a long week.”  
  
Chandler dejectedly trailed behind me and joined me under the covers. I lay on my side, facing away from him. I was still slightly ticked off. Somehow, though, amid my mental chaos, I was able to drift off to sleep.   
  
I awoke to a shrill screech from Chandler’s side of the bed. I instantly bolted upright, assuming the worst.   
  
“Chandler? Sweetie, what’s wrong??” I shouted, desperate to pinpoint the source of his anguish.  
  
In the dim moonlight flooding in through the window, I could faintly make out his visage. He didn’t need to say anything. The look of pure agony and fear written across his countenance said it all.   
  
“The baby. It’s coming,” he croaked through clenched teeth.   
  
“Okay, okay, shit. Um, I’ll help you to the car. We need to go to the emergency room.” I didn’t know how the hell it was possible, but if my boyfriend really was about to give birth, I was determined to do anything I could to help him.   
  
“No. It’s coming *now*,” Chandler uttered, sweat pouring down his face.   
  
“Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh. Alright. I’ll be right back. I’m going to get some towels and I’ll call an ambulance.” I threw the blanket off of me and jumped out of bed. I didn’t even have a chance to reach for my phone before it happened.   
  
“AH. AHHH.” Chandler shrieked at the top of his lungs. A primal, guttural shriek that I couldn’t fathom hearing the likes of. My eyes hesitantly wandered from his contorted face to his stomach. I was suddenly paralyzed with fear. A bulge appeared right below the skin, stretching it tightly.   
  
Dread coursed through my veins like venom when the realization hit me. This thing, whatever it was, it didn’t have an orifice to crawl out of. So it was going to make one.   
  
All I could manage to do was watch as my worst fear became reality. Chandler continued to scream as all the color drained from his body. I began to shiver uncontrollably as it all played out. Then, it broke the skin.   
  
A black, bloody talon emerged from Chandler’s belly. It sliced through his skin like a letter opener. Slow. Calculated. As if it knew *exactly* how much pain it was inflicting.   
  
I wanted to run. To hide. To pass out. Hell, *anything* would be better than watching that scene unfold. But I still couldn’t move. Like a train wreck, I couldn’t bring myself to look away. I watched in unabated horror as the thing began to emerge. As it did so, my boyfriend’s body went limp, and everything went silent.   
	  
A crimson-soaked hand grappled for purchase. Followed by another. And finally, a horned, bulbous head. Red, glowing eyes quickly darted around the room before connecting with mine. My heart pounded like a jackhammer as I readied myself for the possibility that this thing might attack. But it didn’t. Instead, it smiled at me.   
  
That’s it. It flashed me a grin full of jagged, razor-like teeth, and… it left. It hoisted itself from the gaping gash in Chandler’s torso, and it just left. It walked out the door like nothing happened, leaving a trail of bloody footprints in its wake.   
  
I’m feeling so many emotions right now. Fear, anger, devastation. My boyfriend is dead, and whatever ungodly thing that crawled out of him is out there. I’m absolutely terrified.   
  
Because Chandler was right about one thing: He was impregnated through immaculate conception. But I’m afraid that what he gave birth to is the antichrist. And it is here to bring about the end of life as [we know it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorJunkie123/)
