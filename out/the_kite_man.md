The sun was warm on my back as I leaned against the fence, watching the pigs snort and shuffle around their feed. The morning chores were done, and the farm stretched quiet and still around me, just the way I liked it. A light breeze carried the scent of fresh hay and wildflowers, mixing with the earthy smell of the pigpen.

That’s when I saw it.

A kite.

It was the kind of thing you didn’t expect to see out here. Bright red, with long, tattered white tails that fluttered lazily in the wind. It drifted above the forest at the edge of the property, its movements almost hypnotic. I tilted my head, squinting against the sun.

Who on earth would be flying a kite way out here?

I couldn’t stop watching it. The kite dipped and twisted in the breeze, its tails catching the sunlight like ribbons of fire. There was something graceful about it, something deliberate. Whoever was flying it knew exactly what they were doing.

I rested my arms on the fence, my mind racing. Nobody ever came out this way—at least, not that I’d seen. Our farm was surrounded by miles of empty fields, with the forest standing like a wall on the horizon. It wasn’t the kind of place where you just stumbled across another person.

But there it was.

The kite swirled again, its string disappearing into the dense canopy of trees. I squinted, hoping to catch a glimpse of whoever was holding it, but the forest was too thick. Just shadows and shifting leaves.

“Strange,” I muttered, more to myself than anyone.

The breeze picked up, tugging at my hair, and the kite danced higher. I found myself leaning forward, trying to imagine who might be on the other end of the string. A kid, maybe? But the nearest neighbors were miles away, and they didn’t have kids. 

None of it made sense.

I glanced back at the house, its windows gleaming in the sunlight. Mom would probably laugh if I told her about the kite. Dad would just tell me to get back to work.

Still, I couldn’t help myself.

I shifted my weight, my hands tightening on the rough wood of the fence. The kite hovered, teasing me like it knew I wanted to follow. The breeze tugged at my hair again, almost playful, and I let out a small laugh under my breath.

One quick look wouldn’t hurt.

Swinging a leg over the fence, I felt the familiar scrape of the wood against my jeans. My boots hit the ground on the other side with a soft thud, and I brushed my hands off, already taking a step toward the forest.

“Ellie!”

I froze, my heart skipping.

“Ellie, where are you?”

Mom’s voice carried from the house, sharp and insistent. I turned, spotting her standing on the back porch, one hand shading her eyes as she scanned the yard.

“Coming!” I called back, my voice tinged with reluctance. I glanced over my shoulder at the kite, still floating high above the trees, its tails trailing lazily in the breeze.

It wasn’t going anywhere.

I slipped back into the house, the faint scent of soap and cleaning supplies greeting me as I stepped inside. Mom was already at the sink, scrubbing away at a pot.

“Good, you're here. Mop the floors while I finish in here, will you?” she said, not even looking up.

I nodded, my mind still wandering back to the kite and the way it had danced so freely in the air. I grabbed the mop, pushing it in slow, repetitive circles across the kitchen floor, trying to keep my thoughts focused.

What could it have been? A person, sure, but who would be flying a kite out in the middle of nowhere? The more I thought about it, the less sense it made.

I pushed the mop harder, angry at myself for not having gone to look earlier, for letting my mom call me inside when I was so close.

“Ellie,” Mom said, snapping me out of my thoughts. “Get the dishes too, after you finish the floor.”

I sighed, grabbing the dish soap from the counter. By the time I was done with everything—sweeping, mopping, and cleaning up the kitchen—it was almost lunchtime.

“Alright,” I muttered, wiping my hands on a dish towel. “I’m going back out there.”

The sun was higher in the sky when I finally stepped outside, the air warm and heavy. The farm still stretched out around me, quiet and endless, but something felt... off.

I glanced up, hoping to see that kite again, but the sky was empty, the breeze too still to carry anything.

My chest tightened, the curiosity from earlier creeping back.

I bit my lip, staring out toward the edge of the forest, where the kite had been flying. The thought of it, gone so suddenly, left me restless.

I knew what I had to do.

I made my way across the field again, toward the trees, but this time, I didn’t stop at the fence. I kept walking, my boots crunching softly in the dry grass, the forest getting closer.

I followed the line where I had seen the kite dipping lower and lower. Something had been in the woods—something I hadn’t seen before.

And sure enough, as I passed into the trees, I noticed a break in the underbrush.

I pushed through the branches, heart racing as I followed the path. Then, just as I thought I might be imagining things, I stepped into a small clearing, and there it was.

A shack.

It was old, rundown, and almost hidden by the thick trees that surrounded it. The wood was chipped and faded, the roof sagging with age. I hadn’t seen it before, at least not up close. And now that I was standing here, I realized I had never even noticed it in the distance.

How had I missed it?

I took a cautious step forward, a wave of unease washing over me. There was no sign of life, no obvious footprints, but the air felt thicker here.

I stood there for a moment, my breath coming in slow, steady bursts. The air felt heavier in the clearing, as if the trees themselves were holding their breath, waiting.

I could turn back. I could go back to the farm, forget about it, but...

No.

Something inside me stirred. This was too strange to ignore.

I stepped forward, my boots crunching softly against the dry ground. Each step felt like a betrayal of everything my parents had told me about staying away from the forest, but I didn’t care. I had to know.

I reached the shack and pushed open the door with a groan of rusted hinges. It was darker inside than I expected, the light filtering in through gaps in the rotting wood. The air smelled like mildew and decay, but there was something else too—something faintly sweet, like forgotten memories.

I hesitated, my hand hovering near the doorframe as I stepped inside. The floor creaked under my weight, and I winced at the noise, hoping it wouldn’t draw attention.

The place was eerily still. Dust and cobwebs hung thick in the corners. A small window on the far side of the room let in a sliver of sunlight, casting long shadows across the cluttered space.

And then I saw it.

Leaning up against an old, rotting wooden table was the kite.

It was the same one I had seen earlier—bright red, its white tails fluttering slightly, even though there was no wind inside the shack. The string was neatly wrapped around a spool, resting on the table as if whoever had flown it had just stepped away for a moment.

I couldn’t tear my eyes away. There was something... off about it.

Who would leave a kite here, like this? It didn’t make sense. It felt wrong, like the kite didn’t belong in this place.

I took a hesitant step forward, the floorboards creaking louder now, and my heart thudded harder in my chest. I couldn’t help but feel the weight of the silence pressing in on me, like I was intruding on something that wasn’t meant to be disturbed.

I reached out, my fingers brushing the edge of the kite. The fabric was surprisingly soft, and the tail rustled faintly at my touch. I recoiled slightly, my skin prickling as the quiet of the shack seemed to settle around me, even thicker than before.

I stood there for a moment, my fingers still resting on the soft fabric of the kite. The room was silent, but something about it felt wrong, like I was being watched by invisible eyes. But the kite... it was so bright, so vibrant against the dull, decaying surroundings.

I could take it.

A wave of desire washed over me. Who would even notice? It wasn’t like anyone else would come out here to see it, let alone take it. The thought of leaving it behind felt almost ridiculous.

It was a perfect kite.

I glanced around the shack again, as if expecting to find someone watching me from the corners of the room, but the place remained empty, still. The air was heavy with silence.

I looked back at the kite, my hand tightening around the string.

It wouldn’t hurt to take it, would it?

My heart pounded a little faster as I carefully untangled the string from the spool, making sure not to damage it. The kite fit easily into my arms, the edges soft and smooth under my fingertips.

I didn’t think about what I was doing, or the fact that I was probably doing something wrong. All I cared about was how it felt to hold something so... perfect.

I made my way back toward the farm, the kite still in my arms. As I walked, I glanced over my shoulder, but there was no sign of anyone—no one had followed me, no one had even been there. The feeling that I had just stolen something precious gnawed at the back of my mind, but I ignored it.

This kite was mine now.

When I got back to the farm, it was like the world had shifted just a little. The kite felt like a part of me now, an extension of my hands as I ran through the fields with it trailing behind me like a banner.

The wind was perfect.

I let it soar, feeling the power of it, watching it catch the breeze and glide like something alive. It wasn’t just any kite. It was... special. The way it dipped and climbed, twirling on the wind, as if it were designed to cut through the sky like an eagle on the hunt.

I ran circles around the yard, the kite pulling me along, its long, fluttering tails dancing behind it.

I was on top of the world.

But then, I heard Dad’s voice from the porch.

“Ellie.”

I froze.

He was leaning against the doorframe, his arms crossed, eyes narrowing at the kite in my hands.

“Where’d you get that?”

I hesitated, the joy in my chest turning to a nervous lump. “Uh, I found it... out by the woods.”

His brow furrowed. “The woods?” He stepped down the porch steps, walking toward me, his eyes still fixed on the kite.

“Yeah,” I said, my voice shaky now. “I saw it in the forest. It was... it was just there. It’s amazing, right? It flies so well.”

He stopped a few feet away, his gaze hardening. “Put it back,” he said, his voice low and steady. “Now.”

I opened my mouth to argue, to explain how perfect the kite was, how it felt like it was meant for me, but the look in his eyes stopped me. It was the same look he gave when he meant business.

“Alright,” I muttered, feeling the weight of his words settle on me like a stone.

I turned and walked back toward the trees, the kite still clutched in my hands. As I entered the woods, I noticed the air had grown colder, a stiff breeze biting at my skin. The trees seemed to close in on me, casting long shadows across the path.

When I reached the spot where I’d found the kite, my breath caught in my throat.

It was gone.

The clearing was empty, the ground undisturbed, as if nothing had ever been there. No shack, no broken-down table, no kite.

I glanced around once more, but all I saw was the same empty space.

I turned in circles, scanning the forest like I might find some clue, some trace that it had all been real. But there was nothing. No shack.

I felt a knot tighten in my stomach.

What the hell was going on?

I knew I was supposed to go back home empty-handed, that’s what Dad would expect. He’d told me to return it, and part of me knew I should leave it here, just drop it and go back, pretend nothing happened.

But I couldn’t.

The kite was... too perfect. Too beautiful. I couldn't just leave it here. I couldn’t explain why, but the way it flew, the way it felt in my hands—it was different.

I bit my lip, standing there for a long moment, torn between what I knew I should do and the desire to keep it for myself.

It was too pretty. It flew too well. I couldn't just give it up.

So, I made a decision.

I slipped into the barn, the familiar smell of hay and old wood filling my nose. The barn was empty, quiet. I pushed aside a stack of hay bales, the loose strands of straw brushing against my fingers. Then I tucked the kite into the shadows, carefully wrapping the string around its spool and hiding it beneath the bales.

It was the perfect hiding spot. No one would find it.

I took a deep breath and forced myself to walk back to the house, empty-handed. I kept my head down, trying to ignore the feeling of the kite still lingering in my hands, even though it was hidden away.

When I walked inside, Dad was sitting at the kitchen table, his eyes scanning me as I entered.

“Well?” he asked, his tone flat.

I looked up at him, my throat tightening.

“I... I put it back,” I said, trying to sound convincing.

He raised an eyebrow. “You sure about that?”

I nodded, swallowing hard. “Yeah, I’m sure.”

He didn’t look convinced. His gaze hardened, and he pushed himself up from the table, walking over to me.

He shook his head, muttering under his breath, but he didn’t press me further. Still, the weight of his words hung heavy in the air, making me feel like I was doing something wrong. Like I couldn’t quite understand what I was dealing with.

I just wanted to get away from him, away from the farm, away from the fear that was slowly crawling up my spine.

But I didn’t say anything. Instead, I quietly walked past him, heading to my room to try to forget the kite.

But no matter how much I tried, I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

I couldn't stop thinking about what I’d found.

I slipped into bed, hoping to forget the day—the weirdness of the shack, the strange emptiness where it had been, the way my dad had looked at me. The covers were warm, but my mind wouldn’t settle. I tossed and turned for what felt like hours, my body restless under the weight of what I’d done.

At first, everything was fine.

I was out in the yard, but it wasn’t like it was during the day. The light had a softness to it, like the sun was setting just below the horizon, casting everything in a warm, golden glow. The air smelled like summer, fresh and sweet, and everything felt peaceful.

Then, without thinking, I lifted off the ground.

It wasn’t like I was flying high, but I was hovering—floating—just a few feet above the grass. The wind tugged at my clothes, and I felt light, like a balloon lifted by the breeze. My arms stretched out, and I could feel the wind guiding me, carrying me across the yard.

It felt amazing at first, weightless, free. I zoomed around, gliding over the field, feeling the wind rush past my face. It was like I was a part of the air itself, just drifting along without any effort.

But soon, the freedom started to slip away.

I tried to turn, to go in a different direction, but I couldn’t. My arms were stiff, stretched wide, frozen in place. The wind wasn’t letting me move how I wanted. I tried to push myself forward, but instead, I felt myself pulled in a direction I didn’t choose.

That’s when I noticed it.

The string.

It wrapped around my arms, tight and unyielding, pulling me. I wasn’t flying—I was being flown. My limbs were stuck, unable to break free from the invisible hand that controlled the wind.

I looked down, panic setting in.

There, on the ground beneath me, I saw the figure. A man, standing just beyond the fence, wearing a straw hat. He was holding the string.

My heart skipped. I tried to scream, but no sound came. I couldn’t move. I was a puppet, dangling in the air, my body tied to his will.

And then, everything went black.

I woke up with a jolt, gasping for air. The room was cold, and I was drenched in sweat. My heart pounded in my chest, and the remnants of the dream clung to me like a heavy fog.

I glanced at the clock—it was 2:00 AM. My breath still ragged, I lay there, staring at the ceiling, the chill of the night creeping into my bones. My mind raced, trying to process the nightmare.

I turned over in bed, curling into a ball, hoping sleep would finally take me.

The morning came too soon. I didn’t feel rested, but the day didn’t care. The first rays of sunlight streamed through the window, pushing away the darkness of the night, but the unease lingered, like a cold hand wrapped around my chest.

I forced myself out of bed, rubbing my eyes and trying to shake the remnants of the nightmare away. It was just a bad dream. Just a bad dream. Nothing more.

The scent of fresh hay and the sounds of the farm quickly filled my senses as I went through the motions of the morning chores. The pigs grunted, eager for their breakfast, and the chickens flapped around their coop. But even as I filled the buckets and checked on the livestock, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong.

The air felt heavier than usual, thick with the same tension I’d felt last night. I glanced over my shoulder more than once, expecting to see something in the distance, but there was nothing. Just the wide-open fields stretching endlessly, the fence posts, the barn… and the forest at the edge of the property, its trees looming like silent sentinels.

By the time I finished the last of the chores, my mind was still on edge. I tried to focus, trying to remind myself that it was just nerves. Nothing more. I was imagining things. Everything was fine.

But then I saw it.

A shadow. Moving between the trees.

At first, I thought it was just a trick of the light, maybe the wind causing the branches to sway. But as I watched, the figure became clearer—a silhouette, tall and unmoving, standing just beyond the tree line. I couldn’t make out any details, just the outline of a person. And the straw hat.

My heart skipped a beat.

I froze, unable to tear my eyes away. There was something about the way it stood, so still and silent, like it didn’t belong. Like it was waiting.

I swallowed, my throat dry, and took a cautious step forward. But the moment I moved, the figure was gone—vanished into the trees, like it had never been there at all.

The feeling of being watched lingered long after the shadow in the woods disappeared. My heart was still racing, and I couldn’t shake the image of that figure standing so still, so unnervingly calm, in the trees. It felt wrong. Everything about this felt wrong.

I walked back to the barn, trying to steady my breathing, but the unease gnawed at me. My mind kept returning to the kite—its impossible perfection, the way it flew as if it had a life of its own. I thought about the way it soared, so effortlessly, and how it had felt in my hands, like something ancient and not quite meant for me.

The thought of it made my stomach turn.

I had to get rid of it. I had to destroy it.

I found myself heading toward the barn, not even fully aware of the decision until my hands were already reaching for the hidden kite. My fingers trembled as I pulled it from the hay, the fabric cool and smooth beneath my touch. I could hear the faint sound of the wind picking up outside, and for a moment, it almost seemed like the kite was calling to me.

But I couldn’t let it.

I grabbed a match from the kitchen, my hands shaking as I struck it against the side of the box. The flame caught quickly, and I held it carefully, walking back to the barn. The kite, still beautiful and perfect in my hands, was about to meet its end.

I set the kite down in the dirt, the fabric crackling softly as the match touched the edge. It caught fire instantly, the orange and red flames licking at the edges. But as the fire began to spread, something strange happened.

The smell.

It wasn’t the normal scent of burning fabric, wood, or paper. It was something foul—something sharp and acrid, like burning hair. The stench hit my nose with an intensity that made my eyes water. My stomach churned, and I stepped back, unable to stop the retching that rose in my throat.

What was that?

The flames seemed to twist and writhe, as if the kite itself was alive, fighting against the fire. I could feel it—a presence, pushing back, refusing to be destroyed. But it burned nonetheless, the strange stench growing stronger, almost suffocating in the air. The fire didn’t burn like it should, flickering unnaturally, as though something inside the kite was resisting, holding onto life.

And then, just like that, it was over.

The fire burned itself out, leaving behind only the remains of the kite, blackened and curled. The smell still hung in the air, thick and lingering, as if it had seeped into the very walls of the barn.

I stood there for a long moment, staring at the ashes, my heart pounding in my chest.

I had to go inside.

Reluctantly, I turned toward the house, trying to shake off the sense of dread that clung to me. As I stepped through the back door, the familiar warmth of the kitchen hit me, but the feeling of unease didn’t let up. It was almost worse now, as if the house itself was pressing down on me, suffocating me with its silence.

Mom was in the kitchen, humming quietly to herself as she worked over the stove. But when she turned to look at me, her eyes immediately narrowed.

“What in the world is that smell?”

I froze. My heart skipped a beat.

The smell. The stench of burning hair—of something wrong—was still clinging to me like a shadow. It hadn’t gone away. Not even with the showering rush of fresh air.

I quickly blurted out, “I slipped into some fresh manure in the field. Sorry, I didn’t mean to track it in.”

She raised an eyebrow, studying me for a moment, but then she sighed, shaking her head. “Well, you’d better go clean up before it gets worse. I’m not having you smelling like that around here. Go shower.”

I nodded, relief flooding my chest, though it was hard to shake the feeling that something wasn’t quite right. I made my way to the bathroom, my footsteps heavy on the floor. The thought of the kite burned into my mind, but I pushed it away, hoping that the shower would wash it all off.

I turned on the water, scalding hot, letting the steam fill the room as I stepped under the spray. The water cascaded over my skin, warm and comforting, and for a moment, I closed my eyes, trying to push everything from my mind.

When I finally stepped out of the shower and wrapped myself in a towel, the smell was gone.

Gone.

Like it had never been there.

I looked into the bathroom mirror, my reflection blurry from the steam. My heart was still racing, my mind still reeling from the events of the morning, but the air around me seemed clearer now. Calmer.

It felt… normal again.

I stepped out of the bathroom, a wave of relief washing over me, trying to shake off the weirdness of everything. I was just overthinking it. After all, everything else seemed so normal.

Until Dad barged in.

He didn’t knock, just pushed the door open, his face breaking into a grin as he held something behind his back.

“Got something for you, kiddo,” he said, his voice carrying a bit of excitement. He stepped forward and revealed what he was holding.

My heart dropped.

It was a kite.

The same shape. The same color. The same tattered white tails fluttering in his hands, just like the one I had burned.

“Where’d you get this?” I blurted out before I could stop myself, my mind racing to make sense of the sudden, overwhelming wave of déjà vu. How could he have possibly known?

Dad’s smile faltered for a moment, but then he shrugged. “Well, I felt bad about how I snapped at you yesterday. You didn’t deserve that, and I don’t always do a good job of showing you I care, so…” He hesitated before continuing, looking down at the kite. “I saw this in the city today. It kind of reminded me of the one you were flying the other day, and I thought you’d like it. You know, to make up for me telling you to return it. I didn’t want you to feel bad about it.”

I couldn’t move, couldn’t speak. I felt my stomach twist in a knot as I looked at the kite in his hands. My heart pounded against my chest. It was like the universe had decided to mock me.

“This looks… exactly like the one I had,” I managed to say, my voice trembling despite myself.

Dad’s face softened, and he laughed a little, shrugging again. “I guess it does, doesn’t it? It’s not the same one, though. I just thought you'd like it.”

I stared at the kite for a long moment, my mind screaming at me to say something, anything, but all I could feel was the gnawing dread that had settled in my gut. I had burned that kite. I had destroyed it.

And yet here it was, identical in every way.

“Thanks,” I finally forced out, my voice barely above a whisper. I couldn’t bring myself to tell him the truth. Not yet. Not when everything was so… wrong.

Dad smiled, oblivious to the turmoil swirling inside me. “No problem. Just don’t let it get away from you, alright?”

I nodded, the words caught in my throat. I couldn’t even look at him now. I just wanted to run. To throw that kite as far away as I could and never see it again.

But instead, I stood there, staring at the kite in my hands, and wondered—what was going on? What had I really burned?

Dad, still smiling, looked at me with that familiar gleam in his eye. “Hey, why don’t we go outside and fly it together? You can show me how well it flies.”

I hesitated, glancing between him and the kite. My gut was telling me to refuse, to throw it in the trash, but I couldn’t bring myself to say anything. The gift was from him, after all, and he was trying to make things right. Plus, I didn’t want to seem ungrateful.

I nodded stiffly. “Sure. I guess we can do that.”

We headed outside, the sun bright against the sky, the air warm and inviting. It was a beautiful day, too perfect to ignore. I didn’t want to spoil the moment, so I focused on the task at hand. Dad took the kite, and I stood back, watching as he expertly unspooled the string and let it catch the wind.

For a few moments, it was just… normal. The kite soared gracefully, its bright colors standing out against the sky. Dad stood beside me, guiding it with ease, and everything felt like it should—like it was supposed to be this way. There was no strange tension in the air, no feeling of being watched, no unease.

The kite was just a kite.

“See?” Dad said, looking over at me with a smile. “Just like you were flying it the other day.”

I watched him, my shoulders relaxing slightly as I began to let the strange thoughts slip away. Maybe it was all in my head. Maybe I had been overthinking it. There was nothing wrong with this kite. Nothing wrong with the way Dad was flying it. Everything felt… good, again.

The kite danced in the sky, tethered to Dad’s careful hands, and for a moment, I felt like everything was back to normal. Like the past few days had been some weird nightmare I could forget about.

Dad was right. It was just a kite.

I tried to focus on the kite, watching it glide smoothly through the air, but something felt off. The unease from earlier was creeping back into my mind. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched.

My eyes flicked toward the treeline.

There, at the very edge of the forest, I saw him.

A figure in a straw hat, standing perfectly still, just beyond the trees. At first, I thought it was just my imagination, or maybe a trick of the light. But then, he took a step forward.

My heart skipped a beat.

Another step.

I didn’t want to look. I didn’t want to see him moving closer. But my eyes betrayed me, my body frozen, unable to look away.

“Dad,” I whispered, voice trembling, “there’s someone out there…”

Dad’s hand rested lightly on my shoulder, his voice calm and soothing. “It’s probably just a trick of the light, Ellie. Don’t worry about it.”

I wanted to believe him, I really did. But the figure… It was human—no, too human. It wasn’t right. I could see the outline of him clearly now, his figure moving slowly, deliberately, closing the distance between us.

My breath caught in my throat. “Dad… he’s coming closer…”

Dad turned, still relaxed, a soft chuckle escaping him. “It’s fine. Probably just someone walking through the woods. It’s nothing to worry about.”

But the figure kept coming, his steps slow, methodical, each one taking him closer. My stomach twisted. Every instinct told me to run, but my legs wouldn’t move. My breath was shallow now, my eyes locked onto the man in the straw hat. He was too close. Too real.

I couldn’t take it anymore.

I buried my face in his chest, my hands gripping his shirt as if holding onto some semblance of safety. I could feel my heart pounding in my ears, my body trembling as I tried to force the terror down.

“Dad… please…” I whispered into his chest, the words barely escaping my lips.

Dad gently placed a hand on my back, rubbing in slow circles, trying to calm me. “Ellie, it’s okay. It’s just the wind playing tricks, or maybe… maybe it’s a curious anima. There’s nothing to be afraid of.”

But when I pulled away from his chest and looked up, the figure was gone.

Gone. No sign of him anywhere in the woods.

I scanned the trees, my heart still racing, but the only thing I could see was the wind gently rustling the leaves.

I stared at the empty space where the figure had been, my breath still shaky, my heart thudding in my chest. The woods were quiet again, but the fear didn’t fade. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something—someone—was still out there, hidden in the shadows.

I tried to focus on the kite, but the breeze felt colder now, the sky darker. My dad’s hand, warm on my shoulder, grounded me, but it didn’t fully chase away the panic.

He gave me a soft, reassuring smile, though I could see the concern in his eyes. “Alright, Ellie,” he said gently. “I think that’s enough kite time for today, don’t you?”

I nodded quickly, relieved that he was reading my nerves. I didn’t want to be out here anymore, not with that feeling gnawing at me.

Dad tugged the string gently, pulling the kite down and folding it neatly. “Let’s head inside,” he said. “It’s been a long day, and you’ve had enough excitement for one morning.”

The wind had died down, and the air felt colder now, the tension still hanging thick in the space between us. We started walking back toward the house, my mind still racing with what I’d seen—or thought I’d seen—in the woods.

As we passed the field and got closer to the house, I glanced back once more. The treeline was still, empty. No straw hat. No figure. Just trees and the morning fog settling in. But that cold knot in my stomach remained.

“Thanks, Dad,” I said quietly, my voice almost a whisper.

He smiled down at me, his voice light. “No problem, Ellie. Let’s get inside and get some breakfast, alright?”

I nodded, not trusting my own voice, and we walked inside, leaving the quiet woods behind.

But even as the door clicked shut behind us, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the day wasn’t over. That something was waiting for me out there. Watching.

I slipped into my room, trying to block out everything that had happened. The door clicked shut behind me, but the chill of the outside still clung to my skin. I didn’t know what to think anymore. I wanted to shake off what I’d seen, but it wouldn’t leave me. My heart was still racing.

I crawled into bed, pulling the covers up over my head, trying to force myself to sleep, but all I could hear was the wind outside, rustling the trees like whispers. It was so quiet. Too quiet.

I drifted off, the tension in my body eventually giving way to sleep. The unsettling thoughts faded as I slipped into a dream.

was back in the field again. The sun was warm on my skin, and the air was just right. I could feel the wind lifting me, the sensation of weightlessness. I was flying, soaring above the grass, diving and twisting through the air like a kite, just like before.

I wasn’t in control. My arms were locked out, spread wide like a kite’s frame. My limbs stiffened, and I realized I wasn’t flying on my own—I was being flown. I couldn’t move them, couldn’t pull myself away from the wind’s grasp. The string was pulling tight around my wrists and ankles, like a leash, and I couldn’t escape.

I could barely move, but I tried. I tried to scream, to fight against the pull of the string, but nothing came out. The wind howled around me, and I could see his silhouette below, his hand turning the spool, reeling me in like some kind of prize catch.

Closer and closer, I was pulled, and with every turn of the spool, the world around me blurred, the field spinning faster, the sky spinning faster, and I felt myself becoming smaller, weaker. I couldn't stop it.

I wanted to scream, but no sound came out. I couldn't stop him. I couldn't stop myself from being reeled in.

And then, just as I was about to be pulled to the ground, the world vanished. I jerked awake, my body drenched in sweat, heart pounding in my chest.

I jolted awake, my body drenched in sweat. The clock read 1:00 pm, but the heavy weight in my chest told me time had lost all meaning. I could still feel the ghost of the nightmare clinging to me, making it hard to shake the dread lingering in the air.

The farm was quieter than usual, almost too still. I could hear the wind rustling through the trees, but there was something... off about it. Then I heard it.

Mooing. Pigs grunting. Not the usual sounds, but frantic, panicked. My heart thudded in my chest as I stumbled out of bed and rushed to the window.

The livestock were restless, pacing in their pens, agitated for reasons I couldn’t explain. I could hear them from here, their noises rising in urgency. Something was wrong.

I didn't think. I just ran.

I burst out the door and made my way toward the pens, my legs moving faster than my thoughts. As I reached the edge of the field, I saw it — a figure in the distance. A person? The sun was still high, casting long shadows over the land, but there was no mistaking the outline of a straw hat, the shape of someone standing in the field.

A cold chill ran down my spine, and my heart skipped a beat. 

I quickened my pace, but as I got closer, the figure didn’t move. It was still.

A scarecrow.

My breath caught in my throat. It wasn’t a person at all. Just an old, weathered scarecrow in the middle of the field, a straw hat perched on its head. I could feel the tension leave my shoulders, but the unease didn’t fade. I stood there for a moment, staring at the stupid thing, my pulse still racing.

That afternoon, I went outside to check on the animals again. My heart was racing in my chest as I moved toward the barn. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. Every creak of the trees, every rustle in the grass made my skin prickle. It felt like the world was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.

I reached the fence and paused. Something in the air had changed. The birds had stopped chirping. The breeze had gone still. I looked toward the treeline, my eyes scanning for any movement. And then, there he was.

Standing at the edge of the trees, his straw hat barely visible beneath the shadows. I froze, my breath caught in my throat. He wasn’t just a figure in the distance anymore. He was closer. Not by much, but enough to send a chill down my spine. My stomach twisted into knots.

I felt the panic rising in my chest again, the cold dread wrapping around me like a vice. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think.

And then, he stepped forward. Slowly, deliberately. My body screamed at me to run, to get away, but I couldn’t move. I just stood there, rooted to the spot, watching him draw nearer.

No. This isn’t real. It’s just a trick. It’s just the wind.

Then, I felt the overwhelming urge to look back, to run inside, to get away from him. And so I did. I turned, stumbling back toward the house. My heart was pounding in my chest, and every step felt heavier than the last.

I slammed the door behind me, my breath ragged, my hands shaking. My father was sitting at the kitchen table, reading a newspaper. He glanced up at me, concern creasing his brow.

“Ellie, what’s wrong?” he asked, his voice calm, steady.

I didn’t know how to explain it. I didn’t know how to tell him that something was out there, something that wanted me, something that wasn’t human. That he was still out there, watching, waiting.

“I... I’m fine,” I whispered, though the words felt hollow. I couldn’t stop the trembling in my hands. I could still see him in my mind, standing at the edge of the trees, his presence heavy in the air.

That night, I tried to sleep. But every time I closed my eyes, I saw him again, standing at the edge of the trees, waiting. The wind howled outside, tugging at the edges of the house, but I couldn’t escape the feeling that it was pulling me back out there.

But then, a sound—a distant creak—woke me. It wasn’t the wind. It was something else.

The next time I went outside, the world felt different. The air was too heavy, the sky too dark. The livestock were quiet, still. The ground beneath me felt too solid, like I was waiting for something. I took a step, then another, my feet dragging as though something was holding me back.

The field stretched out before me, peaceful at first, but then it all changed. I looked up, and there he was—he was there again. Just beyond the fence, just standing at the edge of the trees, watching me. His straw hat barely moved in the wind, but I could feel his presence, cold and unblinking.

I wanted to scream, but my voice was gone. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe.

He stepped forward. Slowly. His shadow stretching out toward me like a dark cloud.

No. Not again. I can’t...

I turned to run, but it was like the ground had turned to mud beneath my feet. Each step felt like I was sinking deeper, and the more I tried to escape, the closer he came.

I glanced back, and that was when I knew it was too late. The wind picked up again, howling through the trees, tugging at my clothes. The string was there. The string was pulling me.

I could feel it around my chest, tightening, lifting me off the ground. I was floating, helpless, weightless. The earth grew smaller beneath me, and I knew then, with cold certainty, that I wasn’t coming back down.

I was his kite now. Forever.
