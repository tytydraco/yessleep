Static. Heavy rain droles outside of the parking structure. It reminds Hitama of static. A relic of the past. A sound only heard in museums and retro art exhibits. Hitama feels outside of his body. If not for that boring tour of past appliances he’d never think of static. It fundamentally changed him. What would he have called this sound before such an experience. He can’t recall. He can’t think of a time before the change. Now, he stands once more on the precipice of change. He tries to blink away the thick blood pooling underneath his coworker. Pale, doll-like body, so uncanny and heavy. He’s different now.

“Did you hear me son?” His lieutenant asks.

“You brought me here because we share case notes,” he parrots the last few sounds he heard under the static. Hearing the words once more from his own lips allows him to slowly decipher them. His mind is buffering. He arrives to the present, “We only spoke of two cases as of late.”

“What were they?” The lieutenant opens a small notepad and readies himself.

“A woman’s missing cat and the terrorist attack on the train,” Hitama answers without a second thought. He winces at the disapproving gaze of his lieutenant. He doesn’t look away, as ashamed as he is, the lieutenant grounds him. He must keep some level of decorum.

The lieutenant stops scrawling on his notepad, “Nothing about the Hamm case?”

Hitama blinks at the notion, “We hadn’t talked about that in quite some time. He seemed to be going in another direction.” It was his coworker’s high-profile case, and the only one he *should* have been working on. “We only shared notes when we knew the other had some expertise in the matter.”

“Missing people’s your bread and butter, still surprised the Captain past you up,” the lieutenant crosses his arms, his posture relaxing.  *She didn’t,* Hitama thinks to himself.

“You could say it was a misstep on my part, but if the case was going where Mohammed thought it was going,” Hitama’s words slow into silence. He hadn’t said his name up to this point. His eyes scroll over to Mohammed’s body once more. Mangled and strung along the floor. Hitama’s stomach heaves, “I need a moment.”

He apologizes as he staggers away. He finds a urine-soaked corner to throw up in. He can hear his lieutenant’s footsteps moving closer. He raises a hand, as if to say he’s in no need of assistance. He heaves up the egg sandwich he bought from the convenience store just down the street from his house.  He wipes at his cold wet lips and reaches out for the rain. His fingertips can only reach the ricochet of drops. He turns to face the lieutenant once more.

“He was going to the temples,” He answers, his voice rasping the words out. The back of his throat felt thick with mucus, it makes him regret speaking. If prompted he’ll have to speak again. The idea runs ice up his back. He wants to shiver and shake, but he remains as stoic as possible.

“Mohammed was always a religious man,” the lieutenant replies.

Hitama shakes his head, “This was different. He made it seem like scripture or a fable was being played out. Once he came to that conclusion, we stopped talking about it all together.” There’s a sweet and bitter taste of dairy in the back of his mouth. When he speaks the air turns it sour. His stomach churns.

The lieutenant’s head bobbles and his eyebrows furrow to dismiss the notion all together, “Everyone believes in something in some way or another. No reason to stop sharing notes.”

Again, Hitama shakes his head. Eyes cast, but adamant, “No sir. I really don’t believe in anything.” Hitama is saved from the lieutenant’s scowl. He despises the way Hitama talks. He knows this, so would rather not be berated or scowled at. He simply watches the lieutenant’s tie. It looks mint in the cold grey of this morning light.

The lieutenant shifts his weight, “Do you know if he kept a second copy of his notes. Maybe even a separate notebook or hardrive?”

Hitama’s eyes flash up to meet the Lieutenant’s, “He carried around a special notebook. Four by six, leather bound.” He remembered how excited Mohammed was of that book. Hitama often thought the way Mohammed worked was like a shot gun blast. Thoughts and theories written on napkins and postcards. The book was some special brand his wife found when she was fed up with the mess. The spine of the book was interchangeable and she bought him the hole punch that allowed you to attach other paper to the spine of the book. If he was a shotgun blast, it was that day his wife turned him into a 50 cal. It’s why Hitama wasn’t surprised when he turned down the Hamm case, that it was instead given to Mohammed. His heart sinks with guilt at the relief he now feels. Relief that he isn’t the one lying in the empty parking structure, mouth agape in silent horror.

His eyes burn, *his wife still thinks he’s alive. It’s my fault he’s dead. Maybe I should have taken the case. Would’ve hurt less people.*

“I swear to god if you don’t stop ignoring me,” the lieutenant closes the distance. Hitama isn’t sure when the Lieutenant started to speak again.

Hitama staggers back, “I’m sorry sir, what were you saying?”

“I said I’m putting you on his case. What he has written on file is sparse. If he had any recent notes on this case, it would have been in that notebook. In the meantime, we’ll tell everyone to keep an eye out for it. I’ll tell the sergeant what you told me. She’ll probably want to make an announcement,” the lieutenant lists. There’s a pause. The lieutenant stares at Hitama.

“Yes sir,” Hitama finally answers. The lieutenant moves back toward Mohammed’s face, walking some length away from the strewn corpse.

“There’s no way of knowing what Mohammed was up to, but it’s wrong what they did to him… The detective who will investigate this murder seems to be running late,” the lieutenant crosses his arms. “If this is all too much for you, you can go. But I would advise looking over whatever the forensic team puts together.”

Hitama gives the lieutenant a diligent, but rushed goodbye. He can feel the day beginning to weigh on him. He’s tired already.



 

Sparse was either a euphemism or a delusion, Hitama thought to himself as he scanned over old theories and questions. Conversations they had, flooding back to him as he read key words. There were perhaps two threads of thought that he didn’t recall being discussed. He made note of them, opening his notes App and tapping in the Keywords:

Ignacio

 Marisela

He can see his captain staring at him out of the corner of his eye, but remains theatrically preoccupied with his newly acquired case. At some point he will have to talk to her, but he’d prefer to drag that out as long as possible. He thinks about the possibility of being written up. Thinking of infractions or rules he could be breaking in the midst of his mutinous behavior.

He can’t hold out any longer. He gathers his papers and steels himself. *This’ll all be over soon*, he thinks to himself. His throat is dry. He swallows and the spit makes it halfway down before it stops dead. He can feel it hanging in his throat. His face begins to skew into perplexity as he swallows again.

He freezes. He reminds himself he is at work; others can see him. He adjusts his tie. Puts some note cards in his pocket. Before heading towards the captain’s office with paper in hand.

As he’s walking toward the door, he can’t help but notice she’s on a call now. When did that happen? She’s turned away now. He could have snuck away in the absence of her watchful eye. But he’s already made it halfway to the door. He can’t turn tail and run now. He's at work. He is being watched. He must continue.

His heart sinks when his hand grips the cold door knob and he can hear the words murmur from the other side of the door.

“Yes, Mr. Hamm.”

Now he knows he’s in for a tongue lashing. He can hear his captain raising her voice as the door slowly creeps open. *They’re arguing again. I get that it’s your kid, but what has this gotten you man*, he wants to sigh. He holds it in. He’s not allowed to be in distress when the captain is getting her ass eaten every day since the abduction of some rich kid. He takes his time shutting the door behind him. Sweat mists his forehead as he, works past the rough edge of the door. He knows it scrapes if you don’t adjust. It always scuffs at the corner whenever the captain rushes out of her office, off to do some other menial task.

He can hear her hanging up as he releases the door knob. He moves toward the center of the room. He holds his papers in front of his chest, like a child gripping a blanket.

“Those better not be resignation papers,” the captain leers.

“No ma’am. I was under the impression we were going to have a conference. I wrote up a statement on the off chance you wanted me to make my introduction as the new detective on the Hamm case,” Hitama answers. The captain’s brows furrow with mistrust. Her arm swings up, a gesture to hand over the goods. She scans over the text. She begins to shake her head.

“I can’t let you say this,” She looks back up at him.

“I refuse to do this , if I must drop all my other cases,” Hitama shouts. He didn’t mean to. The sudden bravado shakes him. His posture becomes smaller.

“A child is missing, Hitama,” she scolds.

“Children,” Hitama corrects. He wants to say more, but his resolve is wavering. With every act of defiance, he becomes weaker in his efforts. He feels as though he’s trudging through the mudflats. However, she sits back. Her body slackens. She seems more tired than angry now.

“You think I don’t know that,” Her voice is harsh. He can see the rush of emotion come and go as she moves to speak once more. “You can keep your other cases, but you can’t make this statement. It would literally kill me.”

Hitama imagines himself breathing a sigh of relief as he moves to take a seat. The battle is won, now they must work together. The captain runs her fingers through her hair. She pulls out her hair stick and her thick black hair cascades behind her, before she gathers it and ties it up once more.

She sighs, “I still have to talk to his wife.”

“I’m sorry captain,” he answers instinctively.

“For what,” She leans forward to rest her elbow on her desk.

“I know if it were me. I would feel somewhat responsible for his death,” his answer comes out blithe, despite his best effort.

She laughs, “You haven’t changed.” She turns away and nods, “I do.”

“You shouldn’t. It could have been anyone on that case,” he reassures.

“I’m sure he got close. He must have,” she says, but it doesn’t feel quite as earnest as it should.

“There wasn’t any sign of his notebook?” Hitama decides to change the subject.

“Marshall says there wasn’t,” She’s the only one who calls the lieutenant by his first name. “But maybe he left it with his wife”

“He never left his home without it,” Hitama knew that for a fact.

“Wishful thinking I guess.” She reads over the rest of the speech Hitama wrote. “You can say this last bit.”

“I won’t be making a statement unless I can say that in its entirety,” he says quickly. As if not wanting to be talked into it.

“I already said you could keep your other cases,” she says annoyance wringing in her tone.

“I’d like that in writing if I can’t make a statement,” Hitama argues.

Her eyelids drop. They’re at the halfway mark. She’s either tired or dumbfounded. Perhaps a bit of both.
