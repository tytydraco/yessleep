I am not insane. Please. I am not insane. 

As I sit in the white, padded room of the mental institution, I write to you. This is my story—how I became the monster. 



It was a hot summer day. I was driving to work. I was employed at a mental hospital called Oak Ridge. We treated patients with ranging emotions, from anxious ten-year-olds to suicidal teenagers to the mentally insane. I was assigned to the younger kids. Some of them had early signs of clinical depression, and some had lost loved ones. I dealt with mainly the latter. The kids were adorable. I would play GaGa Ball and Mario Kart with them. We would eat apple slices and talk about dinosaurs. I loved my job. 

I peeled into the parking lot, exited my car, and walked up to the hospital. A young, blonde woman ran up to me the minute I entered. I wasn't used to harsh conversations like this, so I took a back step. 

"Mr. Morgan?" She asked, out of breath.

"Yes," I questioned, "what can I help you with?"

"Mr. Van needs you to pick up some files from the printing room in Hall 8 immediately," she said, adding more urgency to the situation.

"Is it that big of a deal," I probed.

"It's for Mr. V, of course it's a big deal," she demanded. 

"What's it for?" I probed further.

"We have a new patient. He's an 8-year-old boy from Kansas," she said, walking away.

I began to walk towards Hall 8. It was a long walk; I would have to pass the physiatric units and the solitary confinement sector. It was my least favorite area. The LED lights in the hallways burned my eyes. I veered right into the units. I walked past rows and rows of white, padded rooms with beds, toilets, and sinks. Everything was padded to prevent the patients from offing themselves. As I reached the final room, I heard weak, feeble crying. Someone was in the last stall. I began to creep towards it, trying to stay as quiet as possible. I peered inside the room through the small, vertical window on the door.

A naked man was curled up in the corner farthest away from me. At least, I thought it was a man. His skin was so white, almost entirely transparent. I could see his blood vessels; he was so skinny I could see his bones. His skin was so tight that his spin looked like a bony sail on his back. I couldn't see his face, but I could see the patchy hair on his head. I kept staring; I began to turn away when the fire alarm began to blare. I turned to see the alarm's flashing lights. All the LEDs turned off, and the only way I could see was the alternating red and white lights. I began to turn away when I heard a click—followed by hundreds of others. I turned to the patient's door. It was unlocked now. The handle began to turn slowly. Before I could react, a skeletal creature exited the room. I could see its face now. Its eyes drooped lower and lower. Its mouth was huge, I had never seen someone do something like that before. It began to breathe in slowly before it let out a scream. It screamed so loud yet quiet that I thought I had gone deaf. It ran at me and grabbed me with its long, pointed hands. It swung my limp body around; its other hand was tearing up my clothes and my skin. I grabbed onto a cell door handle in the flurry of events. It then yanked me so hard that I tore the door open without turning the handle. The door crashed as it swung open and slammed against the concrete walls. The creature stopped, hearing the sound. It began to scream again. I escaped from its grip and ran into a unit in its wraith. I yanked the door behind me. Its screech increased by hundreds of decibels. The scream became so loud that I crouched in the corner and covered my ears.

I was so cold. The creature had torn my attire to shreds. I had gashes and scars all over my body. It hurt so bad and coupled with the screams; I began to cry. I had never been in so much pain before. Then, the alarm stopped, and the lights turned back on. The creature ran away awkwardly to the exit, but I could still hear the blood-curdling screech in my ears. The noise was so painful. I felt as though my head would burst off my head. I was crying so much; my pain was indescribable, and that scream. That damn scream. 

Now I sit in my cell. Doctors come to me every once in a while, yet I sit in the corner and cry. Sometimes I write. It's my only way of communication. The scream still hurts. The doctors whisper about my condition. They say the noise destroyed part of my spinal cord, and the part of my brain that controls my jaw was damaged. Leaving it permanently open. I never eat. I can't; my mouth cannot even chew. Now, the doctors are entering with apple juice; one sits on my bed beside me, and the alarm goes off. Doctors flee my room. The last one shuts the door. The noise is horrible. The red and white lights burn my sensitive eyes. I hope I can leave soon, too.
