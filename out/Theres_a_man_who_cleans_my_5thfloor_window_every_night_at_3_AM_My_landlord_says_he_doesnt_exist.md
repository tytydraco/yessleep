To understand, you need to know my situation. It’s not unique. I’m a young guy, working a dead-end, minimum-wage job that requires me to be up before the sun. If I’m late, my pay gets docked. No exceptions. I live in a small, cheap apartment on the fifth floor of a pre-war building that’s seen better decades. The plumbing groans, the floors creak, and the windows rattle when the wind blows just right. But it’s what I can afford. The most important thing in my life, the thing my entire precarious existence balances on, is a good night’s sleep.



And for the last few weeks, something has been stealing that from me.



It happened about a month ago, and i still can't clear my mind of it, I was deep asleep, probably dreaming about something mundane like stocking shelves or making coffee, when a sound dragged me violently back to consciousness.



It was a grating, rhythmic scraping noise. Right outside my window.



Shhhh-kreeet… shhhh-kreeet… shhhh-kreeet…



It was the kind of sound that sets your teeth on edge, like nails on a chalkboard made of glass. I lay there in the darkness, my heart hammering against my ribs, trying to place it. A tree branch? No, there are no trees tall enough to reach the fifth floor. I glanced at my alarm clock. 3:17 AM.



Shhhh-kreeet… shhhh-kreeet…



It was slow, deliberate, and undeniably human. Someone was out there. On the fifth floor. My mind raced through a dozen impossible, terrifying scenarios. Finally, fueled by a mix of fear and angry exhaustion, I slid out of bed and crept to the window. The thin curtains were drawn, but the sound was coming from directly behind them. I took a deep breath, grabbed the edge of the fabric, and pulled it back an inch.



There was a man out there.



He was old, with deep, cavernous lines etched into his face, wearing a set of faded gray worker's coveralls. He was perched on… something. I couldn’t see it clearly in the dark, but I assumed it was one of those window washing platforms, the kind that hangs from the roof. In his weathered, bony hands, he held a long-handled brush with stiff, dirty bristles, and he was methodically dragging it back and forth across my windowpane.



I stared for a second, my fear giving way to pure, baffled anger. I approched the window so he can hear me.



“What the hell are you doing?” I hissed, my voice a harsh whisper.



The old man stopped his scraping and turned his head slowly. His face was pale in the moonlight, his eyes dark, sunken pits. He didn't seem surprised to see me.



“Evening, son,” he said, his voice a dry, gravelly rasp. “Just doing my job.”



“Your job? It’s three o’clock in the morning!” I said, trying to keep my voice down but failing. “You’re making a racket! People are trying to sleep!”



He just shrugged, a slow, tired movement of his thin shoulders. “Landlord’s orders. Wants the facade cleaned every night. Says it keeps the building looking sharp during the day. Gotta get it all done before sunrise.”



My anger deflated, replaced by confusion. That made no sense. What landlord in their right mind would pay for nightly window washing, especially on a rundown building like this? And why at this hour? It was the most absurd, inefficient thing I’d ever heard.



“Look,” the old man said, his voice softening slightly. “I don’t make the rules. I just follow them. I’m just an old man trying to make a living. If you’ve got a problem, you should take it up with the landlord in the morning. For now, I’ve got a job to do.”



He turned back to the window, ready to resume his scraping. I was about to pull the curtains again when he said with different look on his face.



“Say, son,” he rasped, licking his dry, cracked lips. “My throat’s as dry as a bone. You wouldn’t have a glass of water you could spare for an old man, would you? It’s a long way down and a long way back up.” He gestured with his thumb towards the darkness below. “Just… open the window.  And give me some water”



I hesitated. It was a simple request. A harmless one. But something about it felt wrong. The idea of opening my window, in my bedroom, in the middle of the night, to this stranger suspended in the darkness… a cold knot of dread formed in my stomach. It was an instinct, a primal feeling of no, don't do that.



“Sorry,” I said, my voice tight. “I… can’t. The latch is broken. And i can't move it” It was a stupid lie, but it was the first thing that came to mind.



The old man’s face darkened. The tired, folksy demeanor vanished, replaced by a flicker of cold, hard anger in his eyes. It was there for just a second, and then it was gone, hidden again behind the weary mask. “Suit yourself,” he muttered, and turned back to his work.



Shhhh-kreeet… shhhh-kreeet…



I got back into bed, but sleep was impossible. The scraping sound continued for another hour before finally stopping. I lay awake until my alarm went off, my mind buzzing with anger and confusion.



The next morning, on my way to work, I stopped by the landlord’s office on the ground floor. He was a portly, balding man who always looked like he’d just woken up from a bad nap.



“Excuse me,” I started, trying to sound polite. “I just have a quick question. About the window washer.”



He blinked at me, his face a mask of confusion. “The what?”



“The window washer,” I repeated. “The old man you hired to clean the building facade at night. He woke me up at 3 AM. It’s really loud. Is there any way he could do it during the day?”



The landlord stared at me for a long moment. Then he let out a short, barking laugh. “Window washer? Kid, are you feeling okay? Look at this place.” He gestured around his dusty, cluttered office. “Do I look like the kind of guy who pays for nightly window washing? I haven’t had the windows on this building cleaned in ten years.”



“But… there was a man,” I insisted. “He said you hired him.”



“Then the man was lying,” the landlord said, his tone shifting from amusement to annoyance. “Probably a crazy person. Or maybe you were dreaming, kid. You look like you could use some sleep. Nobody else has complained about a thing. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m busy.” He turned back to his paperwork, a clear dismissal.



I walked to work in a daze. Was I dreaming? It had felt so real. The sound, the cold air, the look on the man’s face… But the landlord was right. No one would clean this building at night. It made no sense. I must have been overtired, stressed out. It had to be a dream. A very, very vivid anxiety dream.



I managed to convince myself of that for the rest of the day. But that night, I went to bed with a sense of gnawing dread.



And sure enough, at 3:24 AM, I was woken by the same sound.



Shhhh-kreeet… shhhh-kreeet…



I sat bolt upright in bed. My heart was pounding. This wasn't a dream. This was real. He was back.



I got out of bed, my fear now mixed with a cold, hard anger. I marched to the window and ripped the curtains open.



He was there. The same old man, the same faded coveralls, the same relentless scraping. He looked even more comfortable tonight, perched on his invisible platform, like he belonged there in the night sky. He saw me and gave me a slow, almost lazy nod.



I approached the window, my hands shaking with adrenaline. “I talked to the landlord,” I said, my voice sharp. “He’s never heard of you. He didn’t hire you. So why don’t you tell me what you’re really doing out here before I call the police?”



The old man stopped his work. He sighed, a long, theatrical sound. He turned to face me, and his expression was completely different from the night before. His face was a mask of profound, heartbreaking sadness.



“Please, son,” he said, his voice trembling. “Please don’t do that. I… I need this job.”



“It’s not a job!” I snapped. “You’re lying! Who are you?”



Tears seemed to well up in his dark, sunken eyes. “The landlord… he must have forgotten. Or maybe he just said that. He pays me in cash, you see. Off the books. He’s not a bad man, just… forgetful.” He leaned closer to the glass, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “But I need this. Every penny. My… my little girl… she’s sick. Very sick. Needs an operation. An expensive one. This is the only work an old man like me can get.”



 I felt a pang of sympathy. What if he was telling the truth? What if I was about to ruin this poor old man’s life over a little lost sleep?



He must have seen the hesitation in my eyes, because he pressed his advantage. “I know you’re a kind boy,” he said, his voice thick with emotion. “I can see it in your face. You wouldn’t want to hurt a little girl, would you? Maybe… maybe you could help me? I don’t even need the job if you could just… help. A little spare money? Anything you have. It would all go towards her surgery. Just open the window. Please. Or… or maybe just something to eat? I haven’t eaten since yesterday morning. I’m so hungry, I can barely stand.”



And just like that, the spell was broken. This was too much. The desperation was too theatrical. The hunger, the sick little girl, the landlord… it was a web of lies, and every single strand was designed to do one thing: get me to open my window.





I didn’t say another word. I just backed away from the window, pulled out my phone, and with my eyes locked on his, I dialed the police.



I put the phone to my ear. “Yes, hello? I’d like to report a prowler…”



The old man’s face changed. The mask of sadness dissolved. The pleading look vanished. His eyes went cold and flat, and a horrible, twisted smile spread across his lips. He knew he had lost.



He slowly raised his hands in the air, as if in surrender. “You win, son,” he rasped, his voice no longer sad or gravelly, but a smooth, chilling baritone.



And then he threw himself backward.



It was a fluid, almost graceful movement. He just leaned back and fell, off the thing he was sitting on, into the black emptiness of the night.



A scream tore from my throat. He’d killed himself. He’d jumped, right in front of me. I scrambled to the window, my mind screaming, and threw it open wide, leaning out to look down, expecting to see a body, to hear a scream, to see anything.



And I saw nothing.



I looked down. Five stories of sheer brick wall dropped to the dark, empty alley below. There was no body. There was no platform. There was no scaffolding. There were no ropes, no harness, no cherry picker.



There was nothing.



There was absolutely nothing for a man to sit on, stand on, or hang from outside my fifth-floor window. It was just thin air.



I clung to the windowsill, the cold night wind whipping at my face, my mind trying to process the impossible. He hadn't been sitting on anything. He had been floating. Levitating. And he hadn't fallen. He had just… vanished.



I stumbled back into my room, my body shaking uncontrollably. The police operator was still talking on the phone I’d dropped, her tinny voice asking if I was still there.



I hung up. What could I tell them? That a floating ghost tried to trick me into opening my window?



I’m writing this now because I need to warn you. Be careful of the things that knock in the night. Be careful of the voices that ask for your help. Listen to that cold, primal feeling in your gut. It’s there for a reason. It’s there to protect you from the things that stand on the other side of the glass, smiling and begging to be [let in](https://www.reddit.com/user/gamalfrank/).
