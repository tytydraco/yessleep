No one knows where he came from. No one really understands how he died, either.

We all woke up one morning, and Dough was just…there. 

Slumped over belly-first against the Cemetary gates, naked as the day he was born. No pulse, no signs of external trauma, no nearby missing persons reports that fit his description.

No ID, for obvious reasons.

Our city’s medical examiner, who also moonlights as the father of my children during his off-hours, informally christened him “Dough”. The corpse was short, pale, and exceptionally pudgy around the midsection. In other words, an unidentified body with Pilsberry Dough-Boy like proportions.

So instead of being a “Doe”, he was a “Dough”. It's tacky, I'm aware. Given his profession, you’d think he’d have more reverence for the dead.

To his credit, he came up with the nickname *after* he performed the autopsy. 

Jim’s a resilient, dauntless individual. You stare death in the face enough times I think the development of an emotional carapace is inevitable. On the rare occasion something *does* rattle him, dumb jokes are his go-to coping mechanism. It’s a bit of a tell, honestly. He doesn’t resort to gallows humor under normal circumstances.

So when he arrived home that night cracking jokes about “Dough”, I knew something was bothering him. I wanted to press him on it, but I was initially more preoccupied with how Paige was doing.

You see, my daughter discovered Dough. She could see him propped up against the black steel bars from her bedroom window as the morning sun crested over the horizon.

Turns out, she was feeling fine. More curious than disturbed. In retrospect, I suppose that shouldn’t have been surprising. Paige received a crash course on death and dying way ahead of schedule. It’s hard to tiptoe around the taboo when your mom owns and maintains the Cemetary, your dad is the county coroner, and you just so happen to live *next* to said Cemetary.

Paige reassured me that if the whole thing started to make her feel uneasy, she wouldn’t hesitate to tell me or Dad, but she doubted it’d come to that with Pippin by her side. Our trusty St. Bernard would ward off the icy inevitability of death, like always.

Later that night, after Paige had gone to bed, Jim spoke up without me prying, emboldened by a few generously poured glasses of wine.

*“Whoever he was, he took superb care of himself,”* he remarked, sitting back in the porch chair, eyes pointed towards the stars.

Leaning in the front doorway, I glanced at him, puzzled.

*“Wait, what? Isn’t the whole joke that he’s, you know…pleasantly rotund? Out-of-shape? Giggles when you poke his belly, like in the commercials?”*

He forced a weak chuckle.

*“No, you’re right. Dough is certainly uh…yeah, pleasantly rotund is a diplomatic way to put it. That’s what’s so odd, I guess. You’d think he’d look as unhealthy inside as he did on the outside. But every organ was pristine. Fresh out the box. Like he jumped from the pages of an anatomy textbook. Couldn’t find a single thing wrong with him, let alone determine what actually killed him.”*

The chair legs screeched against the porch as he stood up. He walked forward, settled his elbows on the railing, and put his head in his hands.

*“And he doesn’t giggle - Dough chatters.”* He muttered.

\- - - - - 

He would go on to explain that he witnessed the unidentified man’s jaw spasm at random times throughout the autopsy, causing his teeth to chatter like he was experiencing a postmortem chill.

Nearly gave my husband a coronary the first time it happened. Still definitely dead, by the way. Jim had already cracked the ribs and removed his heart.

The faint clicking only lasted for a few seconds. A half an hour later, it happened again. And again ten minutes after that, so on and so on. Had to convince himself it was a series of atypical *cadaveric spasms* so he could complete the procedure without succumbing to a panic attack.

But no corpse had ever done that before. Not in his thirty years of experience, at least.

When he slid Dough into his temporary resting place, a refrigerated cabinet in the morgue, he was more than a little relieved. If his teeth were still clinking together every so often, the metal tomb made it inaudible. Jim considered opening the door and listening in.

Ultimately, he decided against it.

We hoped an update would find its way to us over the weeks and months that followed. Jim had plenty of loose lipped contacts in the police department. We did hear about the case, but the news wasn't illuminating. Unfortunately, the investigation into Dough’s identity went nowhere fast.

The first and only lead was a total dead end, and it created more questions than answers.

CC-TV from local businesses revealed Dough popping out from an alleyway about twenty minutes before Paige called me into her room. Sprinting at an unnatural pace for his proportions. A stout, flabby cheetah. Not peering behind him like he was being chased or anything, either. He just made a B-line for the Cemetary. A man on a mission.

Here’s what really had everyone scratching their heads, though: the alleyway he appeared from is heavily surveilled on both sides, but there’s zero footage of Dough *entering* on the other side. No windows on the walls of that narrow corridor, either.

The only workable explanation was that Dough climbed out of a sewer grate present in the alleyway. Naked. No one loved that explanation. Per Jim, he didn’t smell *feculent* on arrival, either. He couldn’t recall the corpse having any odor at all.

A thorough police search of the tunnels beneath that alley revealed only one cryptic anomaly. Nobody could make heads or tails of it. More than that, no one could say for certain that it was even *related* to Dough. It was definitely as bizarre as him, but that was the only discernible connection.

A circle drawn in red chalk with about a hundred empty sun-flower seed packets neatly stacked in the middle, only twenty yards from the sewer grate Dough supposedly materialized out of.

Years passed, and Dough quickly became a distant memory. A story told in a hushed but theatrical voice to enthrall wide-eyed dinner guests. No more, no less.

Until last month, when it became my turn to deal with his uncanniness. I received a call. Dough’s clock had run out. He needed to be removed from the morgue.

It was time to bury him.

Historically, the unclaimed dead were eventually buried in what’s called a *Potter’s Field*. I don’t know the exact origin of the term. Try not to hold that against me. I’m confident it’s a biblical reference. Beyond that, your guess is as good as mine.

Most cities have strayed for that practice nowadays. Cremation is cheaper than a pine box, and it’s a smaller burial plot. I live in one of the few hold-out cities that still utilize Potter’s Fields. If I had to speculate, I’d say we’ve resisted that change because of the high percentage of Greek Orthodoxy present in our community. It’s one of the few Christian faiths that hasn’t evolved to accept cremation.

I procured only the finest of pine boxes for our old friend Dough. Less than forty-eight hours later, we lowered him into an unmarked grave.

Jim asked me if I heard any chattering. Thankfully, I did not.

All was quiet for about a month. Then, the stray animals started appearing.

It was just a few at first. A mangy-looking cat here, a devastatingly-emaciated dog there. I’d see them wandering around the graveyard, searching for something that always led them to the foot of Dough’s grave. A weird nuisance, sure, but our city is full of strays, so it didn’t alarm me. Couldn’t say what was so enticing about the area Dough was buried. I rationalized the phenomena as best I could and moved on.

Things escalated.

Before long, it wasn’t just a few lost animals loitering through the grounds. It became a coalition of animals dead set on unearthing Dough. A task force of unlikely allies - cats, dogs, raccoons, foxes, bats - joining together under the same banner to bring their unusual goal to fruition. Even Pippin began enlisting in the cause, ignoring his training and leaving the backyard at night, something he’d never done before.

Mr. Thompson, our grounds keeper, just wasn’t prepared for such an onslaught. He’d visit Dough’s grave multiple times a day, blaring his whistle, trying to get the animals to disperse. We ended up temporarily hiring his nephew to do the same at night. Two days ago we were forced to call animal control because the whistle wasn’t doing jackshit anymore. The strays just ignored it and kept digging.

Yesterday morning, Mr. Thompson barged into the house, drenched in sweat and trembling like a child. He begged me to follow him. There was something I needed to see with my own eyes.

When we approached Dough’s grave, I couldn’t quite grasp what I was looking at. From the front, it appeared to be some sort of discolored potato, a red-blue spud peeking out of the soil. The growth had many ridges, tubes that slithered and twisted under the violaceous peel towards the apex, almost vascular in their appearance, accompanied by what looked to be a few bite marks. Hundreds of incredibly thin, crimson sprigs emerged from the length of the tuber: dainty threads that connected it to the surrounding dirt, faintly pulsing every second or so.

*“What do you suppose it is?”* I asked Mr. Thompson, standing in front of the mysterious polyp, perplexed but not yet afraid.

Wordlessly, he walked to the opposite side of it, and pointed at something.

I followed him. I wish I hadn’t.

A glossy, curved half-crescent covered the back-half of the growth. It was opaque at the bottom, with a line of yellowish coloration at the top.

It looked like a fingernail.

Something about the soil had allowed Dough to bloom.

And when I listened closely, I could appreciate a high-pitched, rapid, clicking sound in the earth below my feet.

The last twenty-four hours have been an absolute whirlwind. Long story short, the entire Cemetary is on lockdown. In the meantime, they’ve quarantined me, Jim, Paige, and Mr. Thompson to the house. Armed men standing at every exit, something I thought only really happened in the movies.

I think their efforts may be too late, though.

It’s the middle of the night where I live. An hour ago, I woke up to a weighty thump at the foot of our bed, where Pippin likes to sleep.

I crawled out of bed and found our dog lying on the floor. unresponsive and pulseless. I shook Jim awake. We argued about what to do. How to tell Paige.

A sound cut our deliberations short. We rushed out of the room and shut the door behind us.

That said, I can still hear it from across the hall. The chaotic ticking of a time bomb that we’re praying isn’t airborne.
