As I was writing the last part, I remembered this story from my childhood. As a kid, I was always scared of the dark. My mom, being aware of this, always kept a night light on somewhere in my room. I couldn’t sleep without it no matter how hard I tried. It was a comfort knowing that no matter what, when I woke up I could see everything in my room.

This story happened when I was 8 years old. We had just moved to Oregon because my Dad had recently got a job with a local marketing agency. This was great for our family because we were rather on the poor side and didn’t have much to our name. This job was a huge step in the right direction. The house we moved into was your average 2 story family ranch style house out in the middle of a clearing surrounded by woods.

I was fine being surrounded by woods because that meant that, during the day, I could go out there either pretend to have stick sword fights with no one or build a stick fort that I was the sole leader of. There was, however, an area of the woods I was not allowed to enter. My dad told me, “Under no circumstances should I ever see you near that part of the woods.” When I tried to pry him for information as to why, the best answer he could give me was “I want to be able to see you safe at all times.”

From our kitchen, you could see the woods from a window overlooking that area. I understood and promised him that I would stay where he could see me, but a nagging feeling kept coming over me as to why I wasn’t allowed to go back to that area.

I had made a friend at my new school in the couple of months I had been there. He was my best friend, and his name was Aaron. Now if you know anything about Aaron and I, you would know just how nerdy we can be. We both like Star Wars, Jurassic Park, etc.  But I introduced Aaron to the wonderful world of the woods. I taught him every broken form of lightsaber combat I knew, and the best way to conquer a fort that no one wanted. I did everything with Aaron. So when my parents were going out for dinner, I asked them if Aaron could stay at the house as they were out. They reluctantly agreed and left.

I called Aaron and told him that my parents had given me the go ahead to have him over. He arrived shortly after with his PS3 and more games than I had ever seen in my life. Between video games, snacks, and board games, we did enough activity for 30 people our age.

Aaron asked me, “What would you like to do now, John?

What did I want to do? I thought about it for a moment before replying to him, “Have I ever told about the area of the woods that I’m not allowed in?”

“I don’t think so.” He replied with a puzzled look littering his face.

“My Dad told me that there is an area in the woods that is completely off limits. He says that he just doesn’t want me to go back there to keep me safe. I’m not sure I completely believe him.”

Aaron laughed before saying, “Probably because there’s aliens back there dude. They might turn you into one of them. E.T would have nothing on alien John.”

We both erupted into laughter at the thought of alien John.

“No seriously,” I said after catching my breath, “lets go explore that part of the woods.”

“Your dad doesn’t want us going back there, bro. He must have a good enough reason.”

Aaron was always a good two shoes. Teacher’s pet.

“Come on, we wont even be gone that long. I just want to have a peak. Now is the perfect time! My parents are gone!”

“Nah man,” Aaron replied, “I think I’m going to sit this one out.”

“Suit yourself, I’ll see you tomorrow as school.” And with that, I headed out with a flashlight to the part of the woods I knew I wasn’t supposed to go.

As I trekked, I grew more and more excited as to what I would find back here. Maybe if was a pot of gold that dad didn’t want us to find, or maybe it was a lifetime pass to the arcade. Both were exceptionally good possibilities. As I got farther out, an uneasy feeling started to sink over me. The sun was just beginning to set on the horizon, and it was becoming harder to see. I pushed forward anyway.

I came to a clearing in the woods and stopped dead in my tracks. I had to blink and rub my eyes to comprehend what I was seeing. There, right in the middle, were the skinned and gutted remains of some of the local wildlife. I didn’t find it incredibly odd, just really disgusting. I moved past it without a second thought. It had become much darker now and I realized that I only had half an hour till my parents were home. I had to wrap this little adventure up.

I started to head back when I heard rustling in the nearby trees. The sound brought me to a dead halt. I was hyperaware of every little sound around me. Every leaf crunch, every twig snap, everything with like a gunshot in my adrenaline induced state.

“Hello, “ I let out with a shaky voice, “Is anyone there?”

The noises didn’t stop though. I shined my flashlight in the direction the noises were coming from. There standing just out of view but just visible enough was a shadow. It looked human and I assumed it could be Aaron coming to join me.

“Aaron, is that you?”

Silence.

“This isn’t funny man, cut it out.”

Again, silence.

The longer I looked at this… thing, the more the feeling of dread starting to wash over me. I wasn’t sure what I was looking at, but I knew it wasn’t Aaron. He would’ve at least announced himself at this point.

Suddenly and without warning, a loud noise started all around me. It was deafeningly loud, and it sounded like it was coming from everywhere all at once. I immediately drop the flashlight to cover my ears. It was louder than anything I had ever heard before. And then as suddenly as it started, it stopped.

I picked the flashlight back up and flashed to the direction the figure was standing. It was gone. Where… where did it go? Did that… thing make that noise? I heard a twig snap behind me and there it was. The shadow figure was now much closer than it was before. I immediately bolted for home running as fast as humanly possible. As I ran, I heard it clambering after me. But not just on the ground, it also sounded like it was swinging from the trees. It alternated between these two methods of transportation in split seconds. I had never heard of an animal capable of doing that before.

I kept running. I passed more trees than I could count, a river, a large boulder until I ran out of the forest and into my backyard. I stopped to catch my breath and decided to eye the tree line to see if it was still following me. To my horror, it was standing just inside the tree line watching me. I ran into the house through the back door and almost collided with my father.

“Where have you been?! We almost called the police!”

I looked at my watch. It had been 3 hours since I last checked it. That’s not possible, I just checked my watch 20 minutes ago. I wasn’t out there for that long. At least, I didn’t think I was.

“I was just out in the part of the woods you told me I couldn’t go to,” I said in between labored breaths, “I saw a shadow man, and loud noise came out of nowhere. Dad, I thought Aaron was with me but he wasn’t.”

“You didn’t see any shadow people,” My dad replied angerly, “You need to go to bed, we will discuss your punishment in the morning.”

I walked to my room like a sad dog that walks with its tail between its legs. What my dad didn’t know is that I had seen a shadow person that day. I didn’t know what I was seeing until recently. I didn’t know the importance of what this shadow meant. Not yet anyway.
