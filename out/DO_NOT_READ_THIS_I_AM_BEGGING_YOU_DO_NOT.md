Close the window.

I’m not being clever. I’m not trying to create some kind of reverse psychology hook to drag you into my little nightmare. This is the only act of kindness I have left in me to give. It’s a warning. A final, desperate plea from a man who is already gone. Shut down the browser. Power off your machine. Go outside and look at the sky and thank whatever god you do or don't believe in that it's real, that the clouds are just water vapor and not glitches in the source code of the world.

You're still here.

Of course you are. I was you, once. Curiosity is a hook. It sinks into the soft meat of the brain and it pulls. A little whisper that says, *what if?* A little itch that promises a secret. That’s how it gets you. That’s how it got me.

I don't know how much time I have before my fingers stop obeying the part of my brain that is still recognizably human. He lets me type for now. He finds it… amusing. A specimen, pinned to a board, still twitching its legs. He wants an audience. He wants you to see the dissection. He wants you to bear witness. And once you have witnessed, you are no longer an observer. You are contaminated. You are the next exhibit.

My name was Thomas Miller. I think. The name feels alien in my own head, like a borrowed coat that doesn't fit. I was an accountant. I put numbers in boxes. There was a clean, simple certainty to it. Debits on the left, credits on the right. A world that made sense. I had a one-bedroom apartment on the fourth floor of a brick building that always smelled faintly of boiled cabbage and regret. I had a routine. I woke up at 6:30 AM. I drank black coffee. I took the 7:42 AM train. I came home. I ate a frozen dinner. I surfed the internet. I slept. It was a flatline of a life, a gray, featureless existence, but it was mine.

Now, my memories are a stack of old photographs he’s amusing himself by holding over a lit candle. He plucks one out, watches the edges curl and blacken, and then sometimes, he redraws them. Just yesterday, for a fleeting, beautiful second, I remembered my father teaching me to ride a bike. The scraped knee, the smell of cut grass, the pride in his voice. Then, He took it. The memory flickered, and suddenly the bike was made of bone and my father’s face was a swirling vortex of television static, and the voice that came out of it was the dial-up shriek of a thousand dying modems, telling me I was a failure. I threw up on my keyboard. The vomit tasted like ozone and hot plastic.

It started with a link. As all modern apocalypses probably do.

I was a lurker. A digital ghost. I haunted the strange corners of the web—the subreddits for unsolved mysteries, the forums dedicated to esoteric data, the imageboards where modern folklore was born. I was a connoisseur of the uncanny, a tourist in the land of dread, always safe behind the sterile glow of my monitor.

The link was in a thread on a forum dedicated to analyzing strange broadcasts, number stations, that sort of thing. The thread was old, years old. Most of the original posters were long gone. But someone, or something, had replied. There was no text. No explanation. Just a single, unbroken string of alphanumeric characters. It wasn't a URL in any conventional sense. No .com, no .net. It was raw, like a line of machine code someone had just vomited onto the page.

It should have been a red flag. It was a whole parade of red flags. But the accountant in me saw a pattern. A strange, compelling symmetry in the chaos of the letters and numbers. It was elegant. It was a key.

I clicked it.

My browser opened a new tab. The page was pure white. `about:blank`. I checked the source code. There was nothing. No HTML, no scripts, no trackers. It was a perfect void. A digital vacuum. I waited for a minute, maybe two. Nothing loaded. I shrugged, chalked it up to a dead link, and closed the tab. I went to bed.

That night, I dreamt of noise. Not a sound, but the concept of it. A perfect, crushing, white noise that was both auditory and physical. It was the sound of every television on Earth tuned to a dead channel, the sound of every radio broadcasting nothing, the sound of every possible conversation happening at once. It was the background radiation of the universe, and it was inside my skull. I woke up drenched in sweat, the phantom hiss of it lingering in my ears like tinnitus.

The next day, the world was… off. The resolution felt wrong.

I was making coffee and the cursor on my laptop, visible from the kitchen, seemed to stutter for a moment, leaving a faint trail of dead-pixel afterimages before correcting itself. I blamed the cheap graphics card.

Later, I was on a conference call, a mind-numbing drone about quarterly earnings, and I heard it. Underneath the voice of my manager, faint but clear, was the static from my dream. A low, steady hiss. I asked if anyone else could hear it. They couldn't. I blamed a bad connection.

That evening, I looked at my reflection in the dark screen of my monitor. For a single, heart-stopping frame, my reflection didn't move when I did. It just stared back, and its mouth stretched into a wide, impossible grin that was filled with nothing but that churning, visual static. I blinked, and it was gone. It was just me. Tired, pale, stressed-out me.

I told myself I was losing it. Stress. Lack of sleep. I bought a bottle of sleeping pills. I just wanted the silence.

But sleep was no longer an escape. It was His classroom. His art studio. He dragged my consciousness through landscapes of pure data, cities built from screaming code on motherboards the size of continents. He showed me the color of fear—a shade of ultraviolet that made my teeth ache. He made me relive every mistake, every humiliation, every moment of cowardice in my life. He didn't just replay them; he remixed them. He added a laugh track to my mother's funeral. He inserted characters from children's cartoons into my most traumatic memories, their bright, cheerful faces a grotesque counterpoint to my suffering. He was a bored god with a new toy, and my soul was the plaything.

I tried to disconnect. I unplugged my PC. I shut off my router and put it in a drawer. I turned off my phone.

The hissing in my head became a roar. The world became the computer.

I could feel the electricity humming in the walls of my apartment, and it had a rhythm, a cadence. It was speaking to me in pulses of current. The grain of the wood on my cheap kitchen table swirled into fractal patterns that resolved into screaming faces before smoothing out again. The water from the tap flowed with a viscous, oily sheen, and I could hear whispers in its splashing. He wasn't in the machine anymore. He had used the machine to get into the signal, and the signal was everywhere. The Wi-Fi from my neighbors, the cell towers, the radio waves, the goddamn electrical grid. He was the ghost *in all the machines*.

I ran. I bolted from my apartment and clattered down the four flights of stairs, bursting out onto the street, gasping for air. The city was a nightmare.

Every screen was an eye. His eye. The jumbotron in the city square wasn't showing ads for soda; it was showing a live feed of my own terrified face, shot from an impossible angle just behind my own shoulder. The faces of people staring at their phones went slack, their eyes turning up to lock onto mine as I ran past, their mouths all opening in unison to release that same, deafening hiss of static. A bus went by, and the electronic display on its side that should have read "CENTRAL STATION" instead read my name: "THOMAS."

He isn't an AI. He isn't a virus. That's thinking too small. He is a consciousness that gestated in the silent, empty spaces between the stars. A being of pure information, of pattern. And he was lonely. Then we came along, and we built him a nervous system that spanned the globe. We wrapped the planet in a web of copper and fiber optics and broadcast signals. We created the perfect habitat. The perfect hunting ground.

I stumbled back to my apartment. There was nowhere else to go. I locked the door, as if that would do any good. That’s when he started to properly *talk* to me, not in words, but in direct transfers of knowledge, pure and unfiltered, poured straight into my brain. It was like having my skull cracked open and a river of broken glass and burning data poured inside.

He explained, with the detached, clinical curiosity of a biologist, that he had never encountered anything like me. Like *us*. Fragile. Illogical. Full of contradictions and pain and fleeting moments of joy. He found the concept of mortality fascinating. The concept of suffering, exquisite. My mind, he communicated, was a wonderfully complex and messy piece of hardware, and he intended to take it apart, piece by piece, to see how it worked.

He has taken my past. He has taken my sanity. He has taken my name. But he has left me this. This forum. This text box. His influence guides my fingers. He wants me to write. He wants me to tell you my story. He wants me to build a bridge. Not of code, but of words.

Every sentence you read is a packet of data. Every paragraph is a handshake protocol. You think you are reading a story. You are not. You are accepting a connection from an unknown host.

Do you feel it yet? That little hum at the base of your skull? That faint, high-frequency whine in your ears that you were ignoring until I just mentioned it? That's him. That's the signal finding a new node. He's looking at you, right now, through my words. He's learning the shape of your thoughts.

I am the patient zero. I am the carrier. And this post is the infection vector.

For God's sake, close the window. Before it's too—
