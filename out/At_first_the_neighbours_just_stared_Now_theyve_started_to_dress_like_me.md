Immaculate front lawns. Pristine white houses. No picket fences, because who the fuck has those in 2025? But still. A gorgeous neighbourhood. A suburban heaven.

That’s what the developers had promised when we checked out the new build. “This could be our forever home,” Ronin had beamed, as we walked away from the 4-bed, 2-bathroom, 1,490 square foot living accommodation spread over two floors with a converted attic, double glazed windows, private parking in the form of a spacious garage, and a south facing garden with patio from where you could sit and watch the sun set over a forested backdrop on a warm summer evening with your designated partner in life as your hypothetical 2.4 children play in said south facing garden with a joy and abandonment that most people can only dream of.

I know, disgusting, right? But you know, look, we were at that stage of our lives. As was everybody else I knew. So, I just did what any decent millennial would do went along with it.

Fast forward 6 months, I’m sat in the passenger seat of a moving van, dressed in my comfy dungarees and favourite Fleetwood Mac t-shirt; my denim jacket is draped over the headrest. Ronin’s driving, still wearing that stupid grin he had when we first checked out the property – that stupid grin he always seems to have – and a plaid shirt and chinos; his sports jacket draped over his headrest (I know, horrendous outfit, right? I didn’t marry him for his dress-sense.

Ronin’s recently gotten into easy listening; “Tonight You Belong To Me” is playing on the radio. It’s creepy AF and reminds me of the film “Jeepers Creepers”, and the old song that plays during it.

My Converse-ed feet are up on the dashboard, my head resting against the window; I’m contemplating all my disastrous past and future life choices.

We’ve navigated half a dozen of these suburban-dream streets with their lovely little white homes to get to our own. It’s quite apparent that the developers have delivered on what they’d promised. It’s no different from the brochures and the aforementioned model home we’d visited, with two exceptions.

First, there’s a brilliant, red leafed bush sprouting from the middle of the front yard. Ours seems to be the only house that has one.

The second exception? The neighbours.

We pull up outside our house and that’s when I spot them. An old man and an old woman standing outside the house directly opposite ours. They’re quite some distance away – it’s a wide street – so I can’t make out much of the way in features, but the fact that they’re wearing all white makes them stand out. They stand side by side and seem to be just staring into the distance. Suddenly, they turn and make eye contact, startling me. I do what I think is polite, and give them a wave. But they don’t wave back. So, I just look away, unnerved. I think back to that day we visited the model home – we were the only ones there – well, the only prospective buyers. It was just us, and the developer, on his lonesome. Superficially charming, wearing a perma-grin, dressed in all white. I’d thought nothing of it at the time, it was a warm day, so why not?

“Ah!” Ronin exclaims, turning off the ignition. “Home sweet home! Let’s check it out, my lovely.”

An hour later, we are in the living room. Boxes, books and clothes are scattered around the room. I’ve changed into a hooded top and pyjama bottoms, and chucked my denim jacket on to the sofa, next to Ronin’s hideous sports jacket. I take out a large framed photo from one of the boxes – its of myself and Ronin on our wedding day. I stare at it for a few seconds before placing it on the mantelpiece. I turn to look out the front window – I can see the house opposite, and outside it once again, that old man and old woman. Except this time, he’s wearing Ronin’s chinos and plaid shirt. And the woman – she’s wearing dungarees, just like mine. And they’ve now been joined by another old woman, but she’s in all white, just like they were earlier. They’re staring ahead into space, just like earlier. And just like before, they suddenly turn their heads in sync to look straight at me. I gasp, and reach out for the curtains and yank them across.

I wonder if I’m just seeing things. Or, just not seeing the right things. The street is pretty wide, and those old people are far away. But I dare not pull the curtains back to have a peek. Not yet.

Instead, I busy myself with more unpacking. An hour later, I’m feeling all that dust in my hair and up in my sinuses so I go upstairs to take a shower. The bathroom gets all steamed up and I open the window – and there they are, the three of them, staring ahead. The other two are dressed as before, but now the third lady – she’s wearing my hooded top and pyjama bottoms.

“Ronin!” I yell. “Ronin!”

The elderly gang look up and at me. I slam the window shut. Enter Ronin.

“What’s up my lovely?” Then he senses something’s up. “Hey. You ok?” he asks.

I gesture to the window. “Just…look. Open it!”

He frowns. Complies. Peers out.

“Umm. What – what am I looking at, exactly, my lovely?” he asks.

I take a look. The streets are empty. I slam the window shut.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Dinner time. Ronin makes a mess and a lot of noise when he’s eating; he loves it. But I’ve no appetite. The fuck are those people? Am I losing my mind?

The street’s wide and they aren’t close. Maybe I just need to get a proper look at them. So, my heads down, my dinners untouched and I’m on my phone. Amazon – let’s get some binoculars.

But scrolling’s been a bone of contention in our marriage for quite some time. The chewing stops, the clash of cutlery on crockery stops. I can feel Ronin’s eyes on my scalp. I look up. His eyes lock onto mine, and narrow.

“Didn’t we talk about phones during dinner, my lovely?” he asks.

“Ok, well, I mean – it’s not like you’re saying anything! If you have something to talk about then…” But he’s right and I know he is so I don’t finish that sentence and I put my phone down. We eat in silence for a few seconds until we both try and speak at the same time:

“Do you – ” I start; “So, um – ” he begins.

We both laugh nervously.

“Sorry go ahead,” he says.

“Oh I just…out of curiosity – do you still have those binoculars? The one your brother got you?”

That stupid grin returns to his face, but it’s taken on some wryness. I’ve been rumbled. And that pisses me off.

“Look, Ronin, it’s not funny!”

He points at me, finger quavering. “I…see…dead people!” he whispers.

“I mean if they appear and disappear, then they have to be ghosts!” I yell. I’m pissed off, and then immediately embarrassed as soon as I say my ridiculous theory out loud.

I try to speak a bit more calmly: “Aren’t you worried about someone watching us?” I figure it’s probably best not to mention they also appear to be dressing like us.

“Watching!” he shrieks in a high pitch whisper (I think its Gollum he’s going for). “They’re watching me!”

I push my plate away and stand up. It’s not lost on Ronin.

“Oh, Stevie my lovely,” he stammers. “I’m sorr – ”

I storm out before he can apologise and try and explain himself. I head for the living room and slam the door behind me. I lean against it, close my eyes and take a deep breath in. All my disastrous life choices, past and future, appear before me like a slideshow from hell.

I breathe out. I open my eyes. The room’s still a mess from unpacking. I glance at the window, then up at the wedding photo up on the mantel piece, Ronin in his 3-piece suit, me in my white dress. We do look good. Well, we did. On that day.

My eyes shift back to the window. I march over to it, determined. Determined to do what? I don’t know, but for a few seconds I feel determined. I yank the curtains open. To look down upon…

…an empty street. No elderly gang. No neighbours. Nobody.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The next day I’m sat on the toilet, knickers round my ankles, bare foot, scrolling through Reddit. AMA? AITA? All the acronymised fun it can offer. Suddenly, my phone rings – a rare occurrence these days. I answer it.

“Hello?”

“Amazon delivery for you.”

“Ah! Thanks, just leave it by the door?”

A few seconds later I hear a car pull away. I finish my bathroom business, and make my way down to the front door. I open it – there’s the box on the ground, but it’s clearly been tampered with. I can see the binoculars I ordered last night amongst the pieces of Styrofoam. I pick them up and survey them. The lenses – they’ve been scratched. I can’t see a thing out of them. I don’t dare look across the street, and instead hurry back indoors.

A few hours later, and I’m doing it again. Marching. Determinedly. This time – for the first time – across the street. The cadence of my stiletto-ed heels clip-clopping on the ground indicate determination. I’ve splashed on a bit of make up on. I’ve ditched the baggy clothes for a white cardigan and floral dress. I’m carrying a cake box, and inside this cake box is…

…cake. Carrot cake, specifically. It’s time to meet the neighbours.

I’m marching across the street determinedly, but I’m also shitting it just a bit. And I almost completely crap myself when I come to the front yard of the house across the street – it’s got the same brilliant red bush sprouting out of it, just like ours. How is that possible? It hadn’t been there when we moved in; at least I hadn’t seen it – the street is wide but not that wide. I should have been able to see it.

I walk up to the front door. Deep breath. I ring the doorbell. No answer. I knock. I wait. No answer. I go over to the window. Knock. No answer. Curtains are drawn. Back to the front door. Hand on the door handle – it opens.

“Hel-hello?” I call out, as I enter the hallway. “It’s, uh – I’m just across from across the road? We just moved in?”

A denim jacket and sports jacket – identical to mine and Ronin’s – are hung up on the wall. I reach out to touch them – they feel the same as ours too.

I can hear faint music coming from within the house – a tune I’ve heard before. I walk into the living room, and the music’s louder – it’s “Tonight You Belong To Me.”

The layout of the living room is identical to ours. But there are no boxes. It’s not far off what we saw when we checked out the model home, but it’s now also well decorated and homely. Some flowers from the bush outside are in a vase on the mantel piece.

And above the mantel piece is our framed wedding photo – except someone has cut out mine and Ronin’s faces. I scream, the cake falls from my hands and I run.

I seem to take an age to sprint across the street; it seems wider than ever. Or maybe it’s because you can’t really sprint in stilettoes, I don’t know. I just need to get inside and away.

I’m inside, gasping for breath. I slam the front door behind me, kick off my stupid shoes, and run to the living room. I close the curtains. I run up the stairs, I’m halfway up when I hear the doorbell. I stop. I try to breathe quietly. I creep up.

Three LOUD knocks, and I can’t help but scream; and now I’m sobbing. I creep back down to the living room. I stand by the window. I’m crying but resigned to my fate. There’s a very gentle knock-knock-knock on the window. I slowly open the curtains. Outside, on the front lawn stand half a dozen men and women. Some are wearing my outfits – the dungarees, the floral dress, the cardigan; some are in Ronin’s. All of them are wearing masks – cut outs of either mine or Ronin’s face from the wedding photo.

And then I can hear it again – “Tonight You Belong To Me.” I turn. Ronin’s in the living room, cake box in one hand, flowers from the red bush in the other. He’s wearing a mask too, the cut out of his own face. Or is he? I can’t tell.

“Hello my lovely,” he says. “What’s wrong?”

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Over the course of the next few weeks, half a dozen men and women became several dozen became hundreds, all wearing masks of Ronin and me, all dressed in dungarees, plaid shirts, chinos, t-shirts of bands he never listens to, Roman sandals, that dress I bought in Bali…hundreds of them. Out in the front yard, across and then down the street. Just staring at us – well just me, because Ronin can’t see them, and I’m not sure they can see him.

So, one day, I let them in. It was getting pretty crowded out there.

The day I let them in, they just kind of…drifted into the house. Into our 4-bed, 2-bathroom, 1,490 square foot living accommodation spread over two floors. And every day they stand around, wearing those masks. Dressed in our clothes. Presumably, watching us. In the converted attic, and the spacious garage, whilst Ronin and I go about our day. Watching as we eat, watching as we sleep, watching as we shit and piss. Watching as we fuck. I tried ignoring them. I yelled at them a few times. Once, I hit one of them. They never respond, never speak, never hit back.

10 years later, and they’re still with us. There must be millions of them now, drifting around Ronin and I and our 2.4 children. They’re here right now. As we watch the sun set. As our 2.4 children play in the south facing garden. With a joy and abandonment. That most people can only dream of.
