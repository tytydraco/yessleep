I bet you're surprised to see an [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1e1fbao/the_fifth_shadow/) show up in the feed, huh? To be honest, not as surprised as I am to be writing it.

Two days ago, I thought it was over. I'd played a stupid game and won a terrible prize. I sat in my nice, comfortable office [chair](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/591088030341791763/1261979974244503684/20240714_042111.jpg?ex=6694edf0&is=66939c70&hm=811e4e6623ae48248a58cb168e78850c8d847df51ec7866db774292b9a6c09fe&), staring at a phone screen and typing out what seemed at the time to be an incoherent rambling mess of a final testament. But there's more to the story I need to add now.

When I found out that it could touch things, I almost shit myself (pardon my language) and shined the flashlight at it like I had outside, hoping to sever whatever connection it had to me, the world, or whatever.

It knocked the flashlight out of my hand.

Let me repeat that.

It. Knocked. It. Out.

Its touch felt like ice. It almost stung; it was so cold. It slapped the light out of my hand, and I heard it hit the other wall and snap. 

Guess that's what I get for buying a cheap one.

I must have been alone in the dark with it for only a few seconds, but that adrenaline made it feel so much longer. In a panic, I fumbled my phone out of my pocket and tapped the screen until it lit up.

Not a second too soon, it seemed.

It hadn't left its spot, but now it had its hands stretched out, the fingers almost impossibly long. It wasn't a flat shape anymore but a physical form in the third dimension. The fingertips seemed to… smoke? Fade? I'm not sure, but it moved its hands back pretty quickly.
The phone light isn't amazingly bright, so it seemed content to let me keep that, even if it couldn't get closer than it was. That was an hour ago, and it's not going to last forever.

I stared at the battery percentage tick down slowly.

10%.

Behind me, I could almost hear the thing counting with me. It didn't actually make noise, now that I think about it. It moved around and interacted with things; I could hear it bumping into my water cooler, the extra chair, and knocking my broom over. It almost seemed like it wasn't used to being able to touch things, like it was experimenting?

5%.

And now it's started reading over my shoulder. First, I felt the cold. As the light began to fade, it was able to get closer. I think it was reading, anyway, because the only thing I could see was its face looming over my shoulder. Last time I described it, I said that it was a void that seemed to swallow everything it ran over. It was like staring into a deep hole or a well, or under your bed in the darkest part of the night. Something primal inside of me couldn't look away. The hollow void that I'd soon fall into.
3%...

That's not quite true, it seems. Whatever this thing was, now that it was in physical form, I could tell it wasn't hollow. There's something in there… or down there… I'm not sure. It was like staring into a deep hole or a well. I don't know what I saw, but it seemed too… Flicker? Like a light?

1%. This was it. I'd turned the brightness as low as I dared. It seems to understand what's happening because it seems to be getting closer, somehow. The icy cold feeling was stretching all around me, like it was stretching itself out to surround me, like some sick embrace.-

And that, dear reader, is when my coworker opened the door.

At this site, there are always three of us: one to watch the main office, one to watch this conex office, and one on a mobile patrol.

As soon as she opened the door, the cold feeling disappeared, as did the shape over my shoulder. It was like a cloud had lifted from me, and I almost started sobbing immediately. She shined her light in, saw me, and flicked the light on immediately.

Apparently, she had seen me run full pelt back to the [conex](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/591088030341791763/1261979974680838325/20240714_042222.jpg?ex=6694edf0&is=66939c70&hm=422d3525f550bb162770e038d97213f2ab2a34248050740f6f09032720c868f4&) on the camera and came as soon as she'd finished her patrol to make sure I was okay. If I wasn't so glad to be alive, I think I might have been a little snarky about how long she'd taken. As it stood now, I couldn't exactly tell her that the boogeyman was trying to get me.

That'd make me sound crazy.

For now, that's the end of the story. I'm not sure if I'm coming back here; I'm not sure if I can… but there's a part of me, deep down, that wants to. I may be your average overweight Midwestern hick, but damn it, I just survived this horror movie. I want to know, I NEED to know what the hell just happened.

Was it those [lights](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/591088030341791763/1261979975205257256/20240714_042256.jpg?ex=6694edf0&is=66939c70&hm=7ccaabc821c220fb514305621509e43a14eb8626ab19f4d09207d7a21e467355&)? Was it the Conex? Maybe a chemical sprung a leak in the plant? I don't know, but-

Tomorrow is my next shift. I'll think about it. I need to decide if I'm going in, or if I'm quitting. Maybe I'll update again, maybe I won't.
 
Hopefully, I won't just be dead. Fingers crossed, everyone.
