My name is Jeff and I go to Blackwell junior high school two weeks ago Mark went missing, there was no trace of him ever found. The school tried to keep it quiet but the missing posters keep turning up round campus, heck, even on the bathroom stall you can see marks face sometimes. 

Today while I was washing my hands i saw something red in the corner of my eye when I picked up the object it appeared to be the tongue of a red shoe it said “ IF LOST RETURN TO: Mark Mchollo, PHONE: should be in pocket lol” ironically, I found what I assume was his phone with a cracked screen and even though the screen was cracked it appeared to be functional. When I came home I plugged in the phone, soon a pear logo flashed across the screen before it turned on to show marks wallpaper which looked like a selfie of him and his brother in the forest together. Even though me and Mark weren’t very close we still played basketball together so i started to guess possible passwords I guessed his birthday, his brothers birthday, his address, all zeros and finally 12345 before the phone shut down I whisper shouted “ dang it!” then tried to go to sleep



The next day I was tired from staying up and guessing passwords but I got up anyway and after putting on my baggy sweatshirt and cargo pants I looked in the mirror, My mom says I have the brightest eyes she’s seen but i think they’re a pretty dull hazel colour another thing people say about me is that i should do my hair more often but I usually wear a beanie so there is no real point in doing so, after putting on my Jeffreys my mom calls me for breakfast, My Mom makes the best eggs and paired with cholula they are absolutely delish. After eating breakfast I run ou to the bus and look out the window, we live in a forestry area in oregon the trees are so pretty in autumn, Suddenly the bus jerks to a stop I get up to see what happened but it turns out it was just  a snake crossing the road, I look out the window and swear i can see someone standing there in the woods i assume its nothing and revert to my usual position on the bus. When we arrive at school Im immediately greeted by the blaring sound of the P.A announcing the lunch, because of marks disappearance now the annoucments end with a warnng to always stay wth another person. After going through my morning classes i grab snack during break but the schools seems quieter, I think parents are worried about their kids safety and pulling their kids out of school. Have you heard of the “Backrooms” its a horror series about empty public places thats what school feels like today except there is no eighteen foot tall monster with sirens for head chasing me through the halls, but at this point I would rather that to this at least I would know what happened to mark.



The bus ride home to day was slow until the bus broke down, Mr. Ricardo went to check it out but after about 15 minutes the was still at a stand still so I looked out the window and couldnt see him, I decided to step out of the bus to see if he was still there, he wasnt there, suddenly I felt an uneasy feeling almost as though I was being watched. I decided to step inside the bus. After another 10 minutes I heard a loud resounding BANG then a sloshy noise. When I stepped outside I saw a long shadow outside and almost as though on instinct I closed the bus doors and hid under one of the seats, There were several more Bangs on the walls and windows and the sloshy noise turned to a ripping and tearing sound and I swear i head something smear across the side of the bus this went on for several hours until I heard something that sent a chill down my spine at first it sounded just like a whisper saying, “Hi” or “whats your name” but in seconds it unturned to a inhumane screeching noise that sounded like it had a hint of both Mr. Ricardos voice and Marks voice too I pulled my phone out to record and just like that it went silent, I looked both ways before stepping outside to make sure whatever that was wasnt there but everywhere i looked I saw still silhouettes, one looked like a human with its arms as long as its legs on all fours one looked human but with a far to big mouth I ran as fast as I could Before I knew it I was home once i was there  I decided to try to fall asleep after all it was probably just a dream.



In the morning I began to question if that was real Mom was at her job at the hospital and Dad was in Toronto so I had noody to talk to about the previous night, Im thankful they both work hard enough for us to keep our house but I wish they home more. Today I had to walk to school because Mr Ricardo was gone. I went through the school day like usual but i still feel like Im being watched when I got home mom had left a message saying she was going to be working a double shift at the hospital, “Great” I thought to myself sarcastically. I after getting ready for bed I scrolled on Tok Tik for an before an unusual video showed up, A man was talking about how he had assumed to be a homeless man wandering around in the forest when suddenly something made the same unholy sound I had hear last night and he yelled at the top of his lungs when suddenly he went quiet. Almost immediately after this his phone cut to a EAS alarm, he couldnt mute his phone as the alarms went off and suddenly a figure that looked like a man except where the eyes should have been were another persons eyes that looked as though they were photoshopped on except they look to real and somehow it whispered to him in a text to speech voice “im home mark” repeatedly he heard the terrible roar again, the eas alarm returned to normal it said to not open your door to anyone tonight no matter who or what they sounded like before the screen showed for a split second what appeared to be Mark except it wasnt, His eyes were little to wide in a almost cartoon like fashion his mout wa alittle to wide but before i could process it My phone started making a violent screaming noise mixed with pleading,It was mark who was screaming before I could contemplate any of this I heard mom at the door  exclaiming in a exited voice saying “Hi JeFF i Have A G g g g g Gift FOR y-y-yOUUU” I knew it wasnt her, she had too much happiness in her voice she also didnt have a stutter I yelled back “GO AWAY!” holding back tears it said back “come ON M-M-Jeff I wont hurt YOu” Just ask MARk!” his phone made the horrible noise again and sped up childrens music played in the background I just wanted to cry I rushed towards the phone and dialed 911 i told them the situation and they hung up beofre a man on the otherside of the phone started to repeatedly say Dont respond in a monotonous voice, The lady said Im sorry before she actually hung up the creature on the other side of the door started to laugh a unholy robotic laugh over and over and over again, my only hope was to keep the door closed till morning.
