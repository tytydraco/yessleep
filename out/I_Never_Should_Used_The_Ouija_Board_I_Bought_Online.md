It was All Hallows Eve, and the campus was abuzz with buzzed students strolling along the foyer. Part of that inebriated mob was me, the darling Abi Mae dressed up in a dazzling cat suit. and my stone-cold sober BFF Barbara. She was wearing a bright red rubber nose and an old timey clown outfit, along with a painted smile that creeped out all who passed us by.

We were also joined by the very intoxicated Tammy, who was going through a break-up. It must have been a pretty messy one because I hadn't seen hide nor tail of Jason since. She was wearing her track outfit with a cartoony circle plastered on her back in haste. We spent a good chunk of the evening wandering around the campus sipping brews and admiring all the spooky costumes. The house party scene in town is practically non-existent unfortunately, but the student body made up for it by getting trashed and then trashing the quad.

The bronze statue of the school's dopey looking founder was already covered in TP when we first went out, two wastrel frat boys in cheap rubber masks posing in front of it. We simply chuckled and walked on, enjoying the breeze and sneaking a brew whenever we could. Tammy was going ham on the hootch, guzzling down one Pabst after another.

I wasn't too worried about running out, Barb was carrying a duffle bag full of the cheap stuff on her back like a pack mule. I had gotten a good deal on it thanks to the kindly old greeter at the superstore. Eventually we ended the night practically carrying Tammy back home, her golden mane slathered in booze sweat.

Good thing we were starting to wrap up our holiday marauding. The once clear sky was starting to crowd with angry looking clouds. From miles away we could hear the crack of thunder. Gives me goosebumps hearing that sound.

\-------------

Romero Hall, our home away from home, was decked out in Halloween decor. The windows were plastered with grim grinning ghouls and Paper mache bats. The dim lights within struggled to escape the frosted glass, giving off this eerie glow that made their paper eyes look alive.

We stopped at the front steps and collapsed in a heap, Barb let out a sigh as she brought the cluttering duffle bag to her feet. She began shifting through it as Tammy giggled at her own private joke next to me. I nudged her, half a grin on my face. I twitched my cheek in a way that made my painted whiskers dance.

"What's so funny?" I asked a little too loudly. I had only drunk like, eleven beers at this point so I wasn't TOO bad, I feel. The glare Barb shot me suggested otherwise.

"Nuthing, nuthing." Tammy shook her head, her hair waving in her face like a tangled mess. "I just thought he loved me ya know, and he just threw it all away like that. "She made a grand gesture as she slurred, her body swaying back and forth yet slightly tilting to one side. Her eyes were closed, and she was mumbling incoherently to herself now. I gave a sympathetic nod to her.

"I know hun, he was a bum anyway you deserve so much better." I tried to comfort. I shot Barb a concerned look and whispered: "She's cut off."

"No shit." Barb muttered, glancing at the near empty bag. "She drank thirty-five cans." She counted.

"Dude don't count beers, that's not cool." I said yet filled away that concerning info for later. In the distance some costumed hooligans whooped and hollered, they looked like a band of punch-drunk pirates. Tammy moaned next to us, half strung out. We helped her to her feet as I fumbled around my jean pockets for the building keycard.

"What room is she in again, we can drop her off there." I said.

"Abi we can't ditch her in this condition." Barb protested. I sighed and looked at our blacked out friend. She was giggling again, her head bobbing up and down like she agreed with Barb. Though I think she was in her own head chasing rabbits, if you catch my drift.

"Alright she can sleep if off upstairs but if she pukes on my sheets, I'm not cleaning it up." I warned.

"How altruistic of you." Barb retorted as the grand doorway of Romero Hall gave way. We ushered our plastered friend inside and made a snickering dash to the elevator. The front desk had a tired looking kid in an M&M shirt give us an annoyed glance as we sped by the cobwebbed front office.

We crammed into the tiny elevator and rode up a couple stories, every ding giving way to a barrage of tipsy remarks from Tammy.

"Are we there yet-"

"I miss that rotten bastard so fugging much-"

"I like elevators, I eat a guy in one once. He wah tasty."

I gently patted her back as we steadied her on our shoulders.

"Yes hun, I'm sure you did." She reared her head back and let out a disheveled howl as the lift doors finally gave way to our floor.

"Oooookay Teen Wolf, let's get ya to bed." I said, glad no one was around to see her drunken display. The three of us walked the halls, the sealed doors silent save for the odd obnoxiously loud TV or "ghostly" moan.

We reared the corner and passed the bathroom. Gripping the side of the door from within was a pale, moldy hand. Through the slit of the open door, I could make out a pulsating crimson pupil.

With a frustrated groan, I raised a leg and kicked the door, the ghoul scampering away as I did.

"Fuck off Melvin, not in the mood." I grumbled. Barb looked stunned at the sight of the bathroom specter. Her face ran pale as the grim rider himself; her lemon eyes gave way to genuine fright.

"What-it's just Melvin." I scoffed.

"That's real, I thought-" Barb babbled, her disbelief in the paranormal shattered forever.

"Hey, I told you, Jason told you, for whatever that matters." I said. Tammy's ears perked up, and she began wailing his name, a burst of tears exploding from somber eyes. We both groaned and dragged her back to the room, which luckily was only a few doors down the bathroom.

Our shared room was nice, it had a great view of the campus; you could even see a bit of downtown if you looked past the ancient clocktower in the center of the of the quad. There was my area on the left, filled to the brim with dirty laundry and a small Roku Tv haphazardly placed on a somewhat sturdy desk facing my flimsily made bed. 

On the right was Barb's damn near picturesque side of the room. Her bed was neatly made, soft sheets snuggly tucked into every corner. Her desk was clear of clutter and just had her notebook and her laptop on it. I guess when you never get tired, you can focus more on tidying up the joint.

We plopped Tammy down on my bed, on her side of course, with all the gentle care we could muster. She clattered down on the filthy twin, the shaky springs beneath whining in protest. She curled up on my bed and I fluffed a pillow for her like any good host. She mumbled a thank you, her eyes glued shut as the vertigo filled void began to take her mind.

"Mmm drank too much. Shorry guysh. You're good people. I won't eat you." She slurred as she finally drifted off into the serenity of a total blackout. With a sigh we watched her snore away and stepped back onto Barb's bed. Outside the moon was waning yet held its head high; the night wanderers still going strong. By morning I imagined Campus PD would go door-to-door trying to find out who did what and how. I had my fill of debauchery for the night, but still wanted to do something in the spirit of the season.

That was my first mistake.

\-----------

Me and Barb sat there, mulling over our options as our contemplative silence was broken by Tammy's sporadic snores and murmurs about Jason and some guy named Travis.

"So, what ya think happened between them anyway?" I asked Barb. She shrugged her shoulder in reply.

"I'm ninety-five percent sure she killed him." She said plainly.

"Pfft, as if." I laughed. "Even if she did, good riddance I say. Guy gave off heavy future seral killer vibes." I grinned.

"You say that about everyone." Barb mused. "Should we turn in for the night or stay up or watch a movie or something." A movie sounded nice, but I wanted something fun to fuel my waning buzz. I eyed my side of the room, desperate for anything to do on the spookiest of days. 

My gaze fell on the large mirror stand watching my bed. It was a standard cheval mirror, the kind that spun around if you let it. My mother had procured it for me as a surprise birthday gift last week. I remember her wheeling the damn thing in, how it skirted against the hardwood floor that I'll surely have to pay the tab on. 

Looking at it now though gave me a devilish idea. I sprung up and ducked under my frame, digging around for my latest money sink.  Barb eyed me cooly from the bed, slightly amused at my excitement, I'm sure.

"A-ha!" I exclaimed, finding the still sealed package underneath. I pulled it out and brandished it like a cherished reward, instead of a beat-up old Ouija board I bought online from a guy named "Buyer\_Tuck." Barb eyed me skeptically.

"Oh come on." I pleaded. "It's Halloween, we should do something a little spooky."

"Don't you think it's a tad foolish to be messing with something like that?" She inquired.

"Pfft, since when do you believe in ghosts." I teased.

"I literally just saw one gawking at us in the hall."

"Could have been the wind." I said earnestly. I began to tear into the flimsily wrapped packaging. The box it came in was frayed and smelt of mildew. The lettering was withered, the box's lousy paint job chipped to bits. On the cover, a frayed planchette housed an archaic symbol of an elk. Felt like something would jump out at me once I opened it up. 

To my mild disappointment, neither a horde of moths nor a parade of bats fluttered out of there once I opened it. I was gleefully shocked to see the board itself seemed to be in pristine condition. I let out an impressed whistle as I carefully took it out of it's ancient casket. I placed the board in front of the mirror and sat cross legged in front of it.

"Come on let's do this, get the lights on your way over." I excitedly spat at Barb.

"Abi this feels like a bad idea." I waved off her warning.

"Come on you got to do this with me; it's bad luck to use one by yourself." I egged on. Barb sighed and resigned herself to this silly ritual with me. She waltzed over and flicked off the light switch, her eyes beaming at me in the dark.

"Awesome, let me get some candles. You won't regret this, it's gonna be sick." I said, reaching into my desk drawer for some candles.

"Whatever you say dude." She said as she sat down.

"Oh, come on, what's the worst that could happen?"

Saying that ignorant cliche was h-my, second mistake.

\-------------

We sat across from each other in the virgin dark; our only light a handful of mini candles sprinkled around us. The sweet aroma of vanilla cream wafted around us. We each had our hands on the planchette; we softly swayed the piece around the board, circling the center three times.

Then-nothing. The only sound Tammy's apparent sleep apnea. I leaned in and whispered my first query.

"Spirits, we reach out to you now, on this unholiest of nights."

"Seriously?" I heard Barb snicker.

"Shhh. We call upon you; we invite you in. Are there any among you brave enough to delight us?" I asked the board.

We were met with silence. An eerie silence, even the ambience of drunken chatter from outside had crawled to a halt. The planchette cowering under our fingertips remained still. I was beginning to feel a bit silly; I mean this stuff only worked in cheesy B-movies. Then the air around us grew bold. The dull flames around us flickered, like they could feel the electric presence in the air. In this distance we heard rumbling, a distant flash of lighting struck further away outside.

"Storms finally rolling in." Barb muttered, I could feel her interesting waning every passing second. I was about to speak up when I felt something tug at the planchette. It was a subtle movement, one that almost made me flinch away from the board in a cowardly move. Barb's smile dripped as she scrunched her eyebrows.

"Did you do that?" She whispered.

"Did you?" I accused. Before either of us could get into it, the dial before us began to drag along the board, it sounded like chalk being scratched along pavement. We watched in awe as the planchette went squarely to "Yes." It rested there, as if daring us to continue. My dull greens met with Barb's strobes, even she looked a bit freaked. I cleared my throat and asked my question:

"Are you a ghost?"

Barb rolled her eyes at what I thought was an obvious, yet simple question. Then the dial shifted once more, to a swift and concerning "No." The room grew cool then; shadows became brighter and animated in the simple light. The mirror to our side was a daunting monolith, feeling like an unspoken third to our little game.

"What-are you then." I squared my face at the board. It contemplated the question for a moment, then the dial gave way to a calm movement.

"D. . . E. . . M. . O-" I started, but Barb quickly took her hands away from mine and scooted away from the board.

"Nope, no, no, fuck that. Abi take that thing outside and burn it." She sputtered. The candles flickered violently at her sudden outburst, the air tense and frigid at her rejection. My eyes grew as wide as a doll and I looked at her like she had committed a great crime, my hands trembled on the dainty dial.

"Barb there's like, a slew of rules around Ouija boards that you just broke." I explained calmly.  Still, she shook her head.

"Nope, don't care. I'm a believer now, I think we need to put in for a new dorm in fact." She shivered at the thought of running into Melvin the toilet phantom again.

"Dude you really aren't supposed to do this alone." My voice quivered, I dared not take my hands away from the dial. I could feel something, a light grasp on my fingertips eager to continue playing, alone or not it would happen soon.

"I'll watch but I'm not touching this thing." She barely relented. I sighed and looked to the mirror. It was just me I could see, near the bottom a shadow seemed to loom. Third mistake, never use spirit boards in front of reflective sources. You may not like what looks back.

"Fine. Just, please don't leave me alone right now." I squeaked out. Barb winced at my fright and scooched a little closer.  In the distance the thunder rolled in, encroaching on our fair campus. We could hear the rapid splatter of raindrops, a frantic battering against the windows. I began again, unsure if we should move forward but more worried what would happen if we stopped.

"Ok, demon. Sure. What's your name?" The dial didn't waste a moment; it jerked me forward to the letter "F" and repeated the hectic movements five more times. I could feel whatever it was, it was annoyed but eager to please. It dug its astral palm into mine and guided the dial to its infernal name.

"-U. . .R, wait seriously? Your name is Furfur?" I gaffed at it. The board was stone for a moment, then reluctantly drifted towards yes.

\----------

The insolent pair broke out in asinine giggles at the confirmation of the earl's name- MY name.  The gravest mistake that whelp had ever made in her ridiculous oddity of a life. The board trembled with rage, clattering against the floor. I gave her polite warning; stop, cease it at once. I was the keeper of restricted knowledge, the storm bearer, the underworld's most exquisite wingman; how dare they make light of my honored moniker.  Yet the boorish laughter continued, making a mockery of my linage.

It couldn't do of course.

\---------

I couldn't contain myself; it was just a silly name. Even somber Barb was holding back a nervous row of laughter. The board threw a tantrum, slamming its corners on the floor, the dial making baseless threats. I was holding on as best I could, but it was a wave of motion; I could barely make out what the demon was saying. The thunder outside had grown mountainous in its fury, the storm was battering the building, desperate to get in.

"Haha, ok, look-I'm sorry. But come on, we couldn't pull one of the good demons." I teased. The dial came to a dead stop. I began moving it in a circular motion once more, continuing my annoying spiel. "-Or like a seral killer ghost, no we caught a goofy ass guy named Furfur." From the bed I heard a mumbled sound from Tammy, something to the effect of "Shtupid name."

"Exactly. Sorry man can't take this seriously, so-goodbye." I finished the circle and broke away from the dial. The rumbling ceased and the only sound was the frenzied rain from outside. The room felt colder, but other than that all seemed normal.

"See, nothing happened and we got to make fun of a demon." I beamed with pride, ignoring how my breath materialized in the chill room. Barb's eyes widened, her gaze fixated on the mirror. I glanced at it, my blood running cold.

The mirror was solid obsidian; no reflection breached its surface. Not even the failing candlelight could pierce the veil of shadows it had become. I scooted away from the board, realizing too late I had gone too far.

The darkness within the mirror shifted, a lone sound emitted then, the piercing call of a deer's wail. The cry of the elk burrowed within my ear drums, forever marking them with its scornful notes. In the inky glass, two beady embers appeared. They were like marbles, a dash of swirling milk to their ruby visage. Barb cried out in terror, scrambling to my side and clutching my arm. She forgot her own strength and nearly demolished it as she held me for dear life.

The ever-folding black began to take form. It was flawless in execution, the strength of a being eons old I suppose. Two great wings enveloped the being's body as it appeared. Those marble eyes peeking out from the shroud were fixed solely on me. Two majestic antlers sprouted from the darkness. Like twisting vines, they curled around and splayed outward. The unholy creature poked his head from his wings. His head was that of a darling elk, and as the wings gave way I couldn't help noticing his exceptionally toned physique. His skin was light, coming with a sort of ashen hue from what I could gleam from the cruel dark.

The dwindling candles around us were quickly snuffed out, that lovely cream scent soon replaced by a thick fume that smelled like musk mixed with brimstone. It made me retch, but I held back the tide of filth bubbling from within. Not an easy task considering the amount of poison I had stuffed down my greedy gullet. There was a twinge of fear looking at the formless take form, yet a sick thrill of excitement, like I couldn't wait to see where this was going. I wondered if I could take the deer man in a fair fight.

Resilient specimen, I'll grant her that much.

His hands were worn, fingers long and branch like. Where the naval met the pelvis was a mix of man and fawn. The lower half held a marvelous brown coat showered with white dots, and a single silver streak running down his backside. There was even a little puff of a tail, a pear-shaped nub with a puff of snow at the tip. Furfur stood in the mirror, basking in our feeble, mortal dread. His face was expressionless, but I could feel his fury burn me like hellfire.

"Gaze upon your better and cower at my blackened hooves." He crooned in our minds as thunder slammed into the building. Barb was petrified with fear, her face contorted in abject horror. It was up to me to deal with the slighted demon.

"Uh-" My brain flatlined itself, I couldn't fathom a comeback or an apology that would spare us from his demonic wraith. 

So, I doubled down. I cracked a smile, and nudged Barb.

"Get a load at this, bro thinks showing up as *Bambi* is gonna make me worship him. Maybe if you were a snake or a dragon, I'd get down on my knees for you; but a widdle deer? Sorry pal I don't swing that way." I exclaimed.

The elk-demon lurched forward, poking its head through the looking glass. It passed through the barrier with ease, his massive antlers scrapping the ceiling as he passed. He raised a sharpened finger at me and twitched his muzzle.

"Such brazen words for one whose lifespan is but a stain on the tapestry of the cosmos." He mused.

"If I'm such a stain why ya getting titled." I retorted, a bit more confident in my stupidity. The demon stepped halfway out the mirror, placing a bucking hoof on the board, quickly tossing it aside with ease.

"You mortals and your tiresome theatrics. You can never just accept that you're barely a notch on the totem pole. Always snapping back at the hands that graciously allow you to be so bold." I nudged Barb again, who was still short-circuiting from fear. I could hear Furfur chuckle in my mind, a grating sound for sure.

"Your little soul-charged doll can't save you. If you beg, perhaps I'll spare her when I'm done flaying you." He coldly spat. I quickly shoot up and tried to flee, to grab the board. Had to be something I had missed, that's when it hit me.

Barb never said goodbye.

"Barb, grab the board and say go-" I was quickly cut off by a thick hand grabbing me by the throat. He flexed his grip and squeezed, my airway crumbling to bits as I lifted into the air.

The demon cocked his head as I struggled in his grasp, my noodle legs flailing against his steel abs. I scratched and clawed at his skin; it was like a coat of iron. Soon my nails became broken and bloodied, but I still persisted in my resistance, clinging to what little air I could suck up with every crazed inhale.

Barb took note of my peril and tried to help but was swiftly knocked back with a backhanded blow. She flew across the room, a massive crash ringing out. She landed right near the board, and as she slowly recovered, her world a spun daze, The board caught her bulbs.

\----------

She desperately tried to complete the ritual, crying out frantic "Goodbyes" as she spun the pitiful planchette around the silent board. Nobel attempt to save her friend, futile of course. Once broken, the rules seldom relent their retribution. The messy redhead squirmed in my hands, sputtering out curses at me, bits of spittle tarnishing my ungodly visage. I tightened my grip, and her pale face started to become a wonderous shade of vibrant violet.

Yet she still resisted, blow after pathetic blow landed on me, each no weaker than the last. She was determined to fight me every step of the way. It had been some time since I came across a soul with such a-vigorous spirit, we'll say. I looked into her eyes and witnessed such loathing. I released her and she crumpled to the ground.

\--------

As I lay there, savoring the fresh air spilling down my throat, Furfur stood triumphant over me. His antlers punctured the ceiling, bits of plaster and dust showered down like a hailstorm. He leered over me, his antlers groaning as they cut deeper into the ceiling. His eyes, his piercing rubies that seemed to know every dirty secret I ever hid, was all I could see as his great wings enveloped the both of us. The last thing I heard from the outside world was Barbara screeching my name.

Within the shroud of leather that covered us was a sheet of never-ending darkness. It was cold within; the only source of warmth the fiery elk head that watched me shiver among the deep black. It watched me with intrigue, unseen thoughts cycling through his mind. I looked around for anything, any sort of weapon or escape route I could bumble my way through.

There was nothing. Nothing but me and the being of immeasurable power I had royally pissed off. God, it was so stupid of me. I shouldn't have teased it, I shouldn't have even contacted it. Should have just went "Hey Barb, let's watch *Scary Movie 2* and chill out for the night." But no, I had to be a selfish idiot who probably got us both killed. Why was I like this? I just go looking for trouble, it's like I have a death wish or something. This annoying need to poke at the bear until it tears my hand off. Now I've roped my friends into it, god what's wrong with me.

I just wanted to go home and pretend like this whole night had just been one long miserable nightmare. I wished my dog was here, Perry with his stout little nose, he'd bite the shit out of that deer prick. This self-loathing was getting me nowhere, I'd delt with scarier things then this guy. Hell, not even the first woodland critter hybrid I've ever seen. I was Abi Mae god damn it, I could deal with this, I know I could-

*Cease your thoughts child, they buzz around your mind like gnats.*

A silky voice filled my mind, a more refined and divine dialect.

*Had you more respect, I might have shared arcane knowledge with you. Delightful little parlor tricks to amuse your comrades with. After all, you're only human. Not like your friends, the doll and the mutt. Do you think they laugh behind your back, the weak, powerless mortal they have to babysit?*

"Shut up." I said to the still elk in front of me. 

*Wouldn't surprise me if they did. You've faced such adversity Abi; it'll only get worse. One day soon, you'll be bleeding out on the floor, your innards sullying the ground as what little life remains is slowly snuffed out forever. The afterlife is a cold, lonely place for one such as yourself.*

Sympathy flooded my brain, a ruse, I could feel it peruse my mind like it was flicking through a file cabinet. Looking for any juicy bits it could torment me with. I clutched my skull in frustration, trying to concentrate at keeping the prying deer out.

It didn't work.

I could feel it scour through every private thought and shameful memory I've ever had, giggling at traumas I thought long repressed. All the while I cursed it out, trying in vain to stop its prying.

*Calm yourself Abi. You've had quite the series of misadventures; you've struggled so much with your crippling depression. Blunt to say it, perhaps. But it's true. Always feeling so small among the crowd, no matter how obnoxiously you behave. Every outburst a desperate cry for validation, every row with death a high you dare not replicate with ease, lest you fall back into old hab-*

"Fuck you." I declared, cutting his armchair therapy short. "You could have killed me a thousand times over already, this isn't just torture. You're digging for something." I accused. The elk was silent.

For a moment.

*I suppose I find your arrogance amusing. In time I could break you upon the wheel, but why waste such delicious spite? Let me in Abi, let me roam the earthly plane in your body. We could have such fun, you and me. I could teach you tricks and annoyances beyond your wildest dreams.*

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't tempted. Flashes of Abi Mae, demonic sorceress queen danced in my mind. I wore a silk emerald gown, my hair crimson like the ichor of hell itself, blasting all who thought ill of me, indulging in all the bad habits I had sworn off years ago with no repercussions. It would have been easy to give in.

But that wasn't me, it wasn't what I wanted. God help me I was happy being a C-student with two great friends.

"No. I'm-I'm sorry I offended you. It was dumb and reckless. But please, just let us go." I pleaded with the demon. The elk was silent.

For a moment.

I felt two meaty hands clutch my shoulders, and my body stiffened. They held me in place as the elk grew closer, contorting in size and appearance. Its brown fur became coal black, lips parted to reveal rows of ravenous fangs. The sounds of a braying deer filled the void around us, an angry noise of a creature not accustomed to being told no.

The elk revealed its full form, a beastly divine thing, with three sets of sickly hooves swaying above me. The flesh stripped from around the elk's blazing eyes, ancient cartilage stuck out of its snout near the flayed nose. Two rancid fangs jutted out from his maw, like curved daggers. The creature was coated in a radiant aura of pure malice; I could literally feel the evil coming off it in waves. Incredible sensation, all things considered. The creature reared its ugly mug, its serpent tongue slipping out of its mouth and twitching. The appendage had a mind of its own, the moist tip reaching over and caressing my cheek. I recoiled in disgust, my face warm and sticky from the horrid thing.

My shoulders ached from the demon's iron clad grip. It forced me down to my knees, the massive thing before me calling out in triumph. It loomed over me like a shifting monolith. I looked into the swirling marbles stuck to his bleached skull, and I swear I saw Hell. I witnessed tormented souls branded and eviscerated, traded like currency among the monarchs of hell. I saw towering beasts with curved horns, wings the size of 747, gnashing jaws all craving freedom. I saw Furfur, the one I mocked, sat upon a throne of brindled pines.  He reached out to me and began pulling the very fiber of my being apart, slipping in as the possession took hold.

*This was not a request, child.*

I was aware of the creature taking hold in every cell, every vein, every atom of myself. I was becoming the elk; Abi tucked away in chains in the back of the mind. I fought it as best as I could, but I was entranced by those swirling marbles; they pulsated with power, a hideous red aura around them shinning with every pulse. The elk was with me now, burrowed in my soul like a fat tick. The being before me begin to dissipate into a thin mist, a living shadow as he took my body.  He began to seep into every pore I had, the foul mist encircled me like a school of fish. I could feel him feasting on my very soul.

I thought I was a goner, doomed to roam the earth a puppet to an earl of hell. Then suddenly a thunderous crash came. The demon's marbles bulged out their socket, the mist quickly withdrew, flinching away from me as the room around us came back into being. Barb was at the mirror bashing it to bits with the board. Bits of shattered glass rain down on us, and she soon broke the board in two over her knee.

\---------

The connection was severed; the doll had thought quick. I felt what little remained of my essence begin to boil and wither. I watched it sink back to hell to ferment and stew. The vessel shot up, against my wishes, and stood with her friend. We watched the withered form writhe and moan on the floor. The beautiful eyes liquefied within, and with one mournful cry all that remained of my corporeal form was a black stain on their floor, the scent of sulfur still clinging to the floorboards.

*---------*

I was having trouble composing myself, I could still feel something struggling within for control. I tapered those feelings down and turned my attention to Barb. Her face was a horrid mixture of fear and relief, her bulbs eyeing me with concern. I flashed a grin to keep up appearances and pulled her in for a hug.

"You did it Barb! You sent that fucker straight back to hell." I exclaimed, probably louder than I intended.  She accepted hug but slowly pulled back.

"Are-are you ok? What was it doing to you? All I saw was this, this shadow looming over you. I couldn't touch either of you, I panicked and just started smashing stuff." She looked oddly embarrassed at her clumsy, yet useful solution.

"He wanted to possess me I think, do who knows what with my body. You stopped it just in time though. I'm sorry, this was all my fault. Can you ever forgive me?" I said as sweetly as possible. I was laying it on thick I must say, looking back she surely saw right through me. But she nodded her head and embraced me, saying something about paying her back by cleaning up this mess. The woman with the golden mane stirred on the bed, and we attended to her.

The demon was vanquished, a lesson learned, all lived happily ever after and they were never bothered by otherworldly beings ever again.

Now, obviously you fine people don't buy that rubbish. I did make it fairly obvious what really transpired, I did keep jumping in. My own fault really, I gave away the game too early. In my defense, rooting around her memories is an abhorrent chore. When I recalled her inane, shrill mockery, well I suppose I got a tad defensive about it.

I won the moment I touched that board, her will is strong but I am stronger. Her spirit remains, thrashing and raving in the back of what was once her mind. Perhaps I am lucky and the doll thinks I am truly gone. She gives me passing glances, I sometimes catch her looking at me in the corner of my eye. I may have to deal with her.

For the moment everything is going swimmingly. I was a tad worried I lost the foothold into her soul when the mirror shattered, but I remain. I've grown stronger in fact, like a tumorous growth I surge in power. I gazed upon myself in the mirror this morning, through her emeralds I saw my roaring embers. Upon her forehead two little nubs have started to take root. The corruption is in full swing. Soon I will take this world for all its worth.

Then we'll see who's laughing.
