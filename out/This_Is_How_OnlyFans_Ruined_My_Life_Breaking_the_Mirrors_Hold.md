I thought I was done running. The mirror? Shattered into jagged teeth that glinted under the moonlight. The gown? Sealed in a box I swore I'd never touch again, its white lace stained with something I couldn't name. Collector J had gone silent, his cryptic messages vanishing like breath on a cold window. I told myself it was over. I even believed it for a fleeting, fragile minute.

Then the video came.

It arrived in my inbox at 3:33 a.m., no sender, no subject. The footage was grainy, shot from inside my closet the one I hadn't opened in months, its door warped and swollen as if it held something alive. The camera angle was impossible, perched high in a corner where no human could stand. It showed me destroying that mirror. Frame by frame, it captured every ragged breath, every twitch in my jaw, every bead of sweat that slid down my temple like a tear. I looked hunted, possessed, my eyes wide and glassy, reflecting something that wasn't there. Worse I looked like her.

The message beneath the video was scrawled in a font that flickered like it was written in candlelight:
"You only broke the glass. Not the story."

The words sank into my chest like a blade. My apartment felt too small, the air too thick, as if the walls were exhaling. I checked the locks, the windows, the closet door. Nothing was out of place. But the shadows seemed to lean closer, their edges sharper, like they were listening.

So be it.

If they wanted an ending, I'd give them one. But it wouldn't be hers. It would be mine.

I went deeper than the web, past the surface of search engines and into the digital abyss. I clawed through forgotten caches, redacted studio logs, abandoned metadata folders, and rotting film review forums where usernames glowed like gravestones. These were places you didn't find by chance you were pulled. The deeper I went, the colder my apartment grew, the lights flickering as if the electricity was bleeding out. That's where I found her Evangeline Romanova. Starlet. Missing since 1963. Last seen in a cursed, incomplete film called Reflections of the Forgotten. 

Her story wasn't just buried; it was entombed.

Newspaper clippings described her as radiant, untouchable, until she vanished mid production. The film was never released. Crew members whispered of accidents, of mirrors cracking unprovoked, of Evangeline's voice echoing in empty soundstages long after she'd left for the night. Some said she didn't fade. She was silenced. Others said she never left the set at all.

Then Collector J returned.

His message appeared on my screen without a notification, the text pulsing like a heartbeat:

"You're not her. But you're the only one left who can finish what she started."

I typed back, my fingers trembling: "Then stop calling me Evangeline."

His reply came instantly, as if he'd been waiting inside my screen:

"Because you said yes when everyone else said no. Because Evangeline isn't a name it's a role. And you're already playing it."

Rage burned through my fear. They weren't just taunting me; they were grooming me, sculpting me into a replacement. Not for Evangeline the woman, but for the myth a ghost they could crown in her place. I slammed my laptop shut, but the room didn't feel empty. The air buzzed, like static crawling across my skin. 

That night, I woke to a scratching sound under my bed. Not loud, but deliberate, like nails carving wood. I didn't want to look, but my body moved anyway, drawn by a compulsion I couldn't name. My flashlight trembled in my hand as I peered beneath the frame. There, half hidden in the dust, was a film reel in a metal canister, its surface scratched with the initials E.R., 1963. It reeked of mildew and something sweeter, like decaying flowers. The canister was warm, as if it had been held moments before. It hadn't been there yesterday. 

I touched it, and the static in the air surged, prickling my scalp. The reel hummed, not with sound but with intent, like a voice trapped in its celluloid veins, whispering just below my hearing. I wanted to burn it, to throw it into the street, but my hands wouldn't let go. 

I borrowed a projector from a pawn shop, its owner eyeing me like he knew what I was carrying. Back home, I set it up in my living room, the windows blacked out with taped garbage bags. The reel clicked into place, and the projector whirred to life, casting a sickly yellow light across the wall. The film flickered like it was fighting to stay alive, each frame stuttering as if the story itself was in pain.

There she was Evangeline. Pale as bone, unblinking, her eyes like wells you could fall into and never climb out. She wore the white lace gown, its fabric clinging to her like a second skin, stained with faint, rust colored smears. She stood before a mirror, her lips moving silently, forming words I couldn't hear but felt in my chest, heavy and sharp, like a curse being woven. The set around her was wrong too dim, too vast, the shadows pooling in corners like spilled ink. 

Then I saw the reflection.

It wasn't Evangeline. It was me.

Not a trick of light. Not a glitch. My face, my movements, my trembling hands, mirrored perfectly in that impossible glass. But my reflection's eyes were wrong too dark, too knowing, like they saw me watching. The reel cut to black, and my apartment plunged into silence so deep it felt like drowning. The projector stopped, but the bulb kept glowing, casting a single beam that pulsed like a dying star.

Then a buzz. My phone lit up on the table, skittering an inch across the wood. A text from an unknown number:

"The final scene is yours now."

I didn't sleep. The air in my apartment grew heavier, the shadows thicker, as if the film had left something behind. At dawn, a knock came soft, deliberate, like a heartbeat against my door. I opened it to find a package, unmarked, its edges damp with something that smelled of lilies and mold. Inside was the gown. The same white lace, its fabric impossibly soft yet heavy, like it carried the weight of a body. It was pristine, but the stains were there, faint and red, blooming like wounds under the light.

I didn't hesitate.

I slipped it on.

The fabric clung to me, cold and alive, tightening with every breath. My reflection in the cracked mirror shifted, the shards knitting together in a way that defied physics, forming a jagged mosaic of my face. But I wasn't scared. I wasn't spiraling. I wasn't a scream waiting to happen. I was grounded, observant, and ready. The gown didn't own me. I owned it.

The mirror waited, its surface humming with a low, guttural sound, like a throat trying to speak. I stood before it, and there she was not Evangeline exactly, not me either, but something in between, an echo caught in a loop it couldn't escape. Her face was mine, but older, hollowed, her eyes like pits that swallowed light. Her smile was a wound, slow and deliberate, peeling back to show too many teeth.

"You can leave," she whispered, her voice slithering through the glass, wrapping around my spine. "But one of us has to stay."

The air turned sour, thick with the scent of lilies and something metallic. The walls creaked, as if the apartment itself was bending toward the mirror. I didn't flinch.

"You've been waiting decades for someone weak," I said, my voice steady, cutting through the hum. "You misjudged me."

She tilted her head, just like I do when I'm amused. It was a tell, and I read her. Her smile faltered, and the mirror rippled, its surface buckling like water. 

"You think this is a ritual," I said, stepping closer, my breath fogging the glass. "A passing of the crown. But I don't want it. And that's exactly why I win."

I raised my hand and pressed it to the mirror. The glass was warm, pulsing like flesh. She flinched, her reflection fracturing, her eyes widening with something primal fear. For the first time, she was afraid.

"You're not my ending," I said, my voice low, a blade. "I'm your rewrite."

The mirror didn't just crack it screamed. The sound was inhuman, a wail that clawed at my ears as the glass collapsed inward, shards exploding across the room like a storm of knives. I hit the floor, the gown unraveling like cobwebs, dissolving into ash that stung my skin. The air cleared, and the reflection returned. Mine. Jocelyn. But sharpened, my eyes harder, my jaw set, my shadow longer.

Among the shards lay a key, small and silver, its surface etched with symbols that hurt to look at. It was cold, yet it hummed with her, with Evangeline, with the story that refused to die. But now it wasn't her prison.

It was mine to hold.

I closed my fist around it, the metal biting into my palm. The apartment was silent, but the silence was mine. The shadows retreated, the air lightened, and the closet door stood still, its secrets sealed.

I'm keeping the key.

Let the mirror stay shattered. Let the story breathe but on my terms. Because I'm not haunted anymore.

I'm the haunting.
