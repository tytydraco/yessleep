It's been a long time since I last updated, and I'm sorry for the silence. I've been running from shadows that won't let me go. I thought smashing that closet mirror would break Evangeline's hold on me, but I was wrong. After I shattered it into a hundred pieces, each shard still showing her hollow eyes, I got that video from an unknown number, filmed from inside the closet, capturing me as I broke the glass. The message that came with it still haunts me: "You're hers now, Evangeline." I've moved again since then, hoping a new apartment would stop the mirrors from cracking, stop that silk scarf from reappearing with its red marks on my neck, stop her from taking me over. But nothing's changed. I'm still not safe, and I can feel myself fading into her.

Then I found it: a dusty film reel, tucked inside a wooden box under my bed, where I'd never looked before. It wasn't there last week. I know it wasn't.
The reel was old, its metal canister scratched with faint initials: E.R., 1963. My hands shook as I held it, the same cold as that key I keep finding. I didn't want to watch it, but Collector_J's last text echoed in my head.

"I have something you want, Evangeline. A video. Not yours. Hers," he had written.

This had to be it, the video he promised, the one he said would explain her. I borrowed a projector from a thrift store, set it up in my new apartment's bare living room, and let the reel spin.

The footage was grainy, flickering like it was fighting to be seen. A woman appeared:
Evangeline, unmistakable, her face so like mine it stole my breath. She wore a white lace gown, delicate but heavy, like a wedding dress for a ghost. She stood in a dimly lit room, staring into a cracked mirror, her eyes wide with fear. The camera lingered, unnaturally long, as if it was feeding on her. There was no sound, just her lips moving, forming words I couldn't read. The scene cut abruptly, unfinished, but her expression burned into me. I'd seen that look in my own reflection, in every mirror I couldn't escape.

I played it again, and this time, I noticed something worse. In the mirror behind her, a shadow moved: formless, but watching. It wasn't in the room with her. It was in the glass. The reel ended, and my apartment went dark.

"Evangeline," a whisper hissed from the projector, so faint I thought I'd imagined it.

My skin crawled, and when I turned, my reflection in the window wasn't mine. It was her, in that gown, smiling with eyes too old for her face.

I researched her name, scouring library archives and old microfiche. Evangeline Romanova, a 1960s starlet, vanished after filming an unreleased movie called Reflections of the Forgotten. The articles were sparse, but the details chilled me. She'd been a rising star, lured into private photo sessions to pay her way, her images sold to men who thought they owned her. The movie was her last project, abandoned when she disappeared. Rumors swirled: powerful men, secret deals, a betrayal that left her erased. One grainy magazine ad showed her in that white gown, standing before a cracked mirror, with the tagline: "She vanished. But her story didn't end." The ad felt like a warning, like she'd been trapped in that moment, waiting.

Collector_J knew. His texts started again, slipping through my new number like water through cracks.
"You're the final piece, Evangeline. Finish what she started, or you'll be lost like her," he wrote.

I tried to block him, but my phone glitched, opening to photos I didn't take: Evangeline in her gown, then me, my face morphing into hers. The requests had stopped, but his demands grew sharper, like he was running out of time. I wanted to run, to burn the reel and leave, but the key was back, sitting on my kitchen counter, colder than ever. It didn't fit my locks, but I knew it belonged to her story, to that unfinished film.

Then the gown arrived. It came in a package with no return address, wrapped in tissue paper that smelled of lilies. The same white lace from the reel, heavy with age, its hem frayed like it'd been worn through decades. A note was pinned to it, inked in shaky script.

"Wear it, Evangeline. Become her," it read.
My stomach twisted, but the scarf from before, the one that left red marks on my neck, flashed in my mind. I'd tried throwing it out, and it came back. This gown felt the same, like it was already part of me.

His final text came that night.

"Step into the gown. Stand before the mirror. You will see her. And you will become her," Collector_J demanded.

I knew it was a trap, just like the payphone, the scarf, and the Polaroid. Every request had pulled me closer to her, made my eyes look less like mine. But the reel haunted me: her fear, her unfinished story. If I didn't do this, Collector_J would expose me, splash my face across the internet, or worse, let her take me without a fight. I had to know what she wanted and why she was doing this.

I slipped on the gown, its weight pressing into my skin like damp earth. It fit perfectly, too perfectly, like it was made for me. My apartment was mirrorless since I'd taped paper over every reflective surface, but I'd kept one, hidden in the closet, the cracked full-length mirror from the last place. I dragged it out, my hands trembling, and stood before it. The air thickened, the lily scent choking me. I stared into the glass, and there she was. Not me. Evangeline. Her smile was wrong, not joy but inevitability, like she'd waited decades for this moment.

"Evangeline," I whispered, repeating her name three times, like the payphone ritual.

The mirror shimmered, ripples spreading across the glass like water. My reflection shifted, my face melting into hers: same jaw, same eyes, but hollow, ancient. A flash blinded me, and I heard a click, like a camera shutter. When my vision cleared, a Polaroid lay at my feet. It showed her, in the gown, standing before the mirror, her eyes wide with fear, just like the reel's final frame. But the face was mine. Jocelyn, gone. Evangeline, real.
Everything went black.

I woke on the floor, the gown still clinging to me, the mirror dark. My phone was dead, its screen cracked like the mirror. The Polaroid was gone, but I felt her, heavier now, like she was inside my skin. The key in my pocket burned with a cold I'd never felt before, and I noticed something new: a tiny lock on the mirror's frame, hidden in the cracks. My hands shook as I slid the key in. It fit. A click echoed, and the mirror glowed, Evangeline's face appearing one last time. Her lips moved, forming words I could finally hear.

"You can leave, but one must stay," she whispered, her voice like ice.

I understood. The mirror was her prison, Reflections of the Forgotten a curse that needed a vessel. I could trade places with her, let her take my body and walk free, while I stayed trapped in the glass, or I could refuse and lose myself completely. I thought of my life, my name, everything I was. I couldn't let her have it. With every ounce of will I had left, I smashed the mirror again, screaming my name, Jocelyn, until the glass was dust. The gown fell from my shoulders, the air cleared of lilies, and my reflection in a nearby window was mine again. But as I turned to leave, I saw the key on the floor, glowing faintly, and I knew: she was gone, but the curse wasn't.

Someone else would find it, and the loop would begin again. I walked away, free, but haunted by the thought that I'd only delayed the inevitable.
