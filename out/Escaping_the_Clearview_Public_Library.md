[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/MattBenjamin/comments/1p1it4d/the_library/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) was posted by my boyfriend a few months back. But he said I should hop on and share the rest of the story... so here we go!

Every few days, though it's difficult to track time here, I'd get a flash of lucidity. A subtle memory of who I once was before all this, before I became the librarian. But those glimpses were always short-lived, quickly replaced by my next administrative task. You'd think there wouldn't be much to do in a library nobody ever visits. But there are shelves to dust, new books to order, old ones to dispose of, not to mention the labyrinthian complex of flesh codices spanning miles below ground. It was a lot to keep up with.

And the work didn't end when the sun went down. That was when I had to deliver books to the townsfolk. You learn a lot about a town based on its reading habits. Mayor Blythe, for instance, is an avid gardener. Mrs. Roberts, the school secretary, for all her rosy cheeks and hand-knit sweaters, reads the sort of smut that would make Sheriff Ervine blush.

I had just returned from my nightly deliveries and was descending into the underground-section when I got another one of those flashes of clarity. But this time, it didn't fade. I remembered details I hadn't for months. I remembered my name. I remembered my family. I also remembered how I had come to be in this situation. *I was such an idiot for ever stepping foot in this place.*

But with the memories came something else.

Fear.

Far from being my regular workplace\*,\* this network of hellish subterranean passages was unfamiliar and terrifying. The stone walls danced in the light of dying candlelight as old wooden shelves stretched into the darkness like a pair of ragged arms. Worse yet was what sat upon the shelves. Books, if you can call them that. Each with its own unique shade of fleshy pink, the books sat side by side gently pulsing on the splintering wood. Some were thick, some not larger than a credit card. None of the covers had any writing, though each had its own unique network of purple veins.

Maybe whatever was controlling me for the past who-knows-how-long knew how to get out of this place. But as I stood there in the dank darkness, it was as if I were in another world. Which way to the exit? How far until I got there?

All I could do was pick a direction and walk. 

Step by step, I made my way down the seemingly endless stone corridor. My footsteps, my heavy breathing, and my heart beating out of my chest were the only sounds aside from the occasional gurgling noise coming from one of the ‘books’.

My foot caught on something, and I stumbled forward. Flailing my arms to steady myself, I accidentally touched one of the books.

My vision went white as a warm sensation flooded my chest. Suddenly I was somewhere else. In a living room? A man stood in front of me; his face was red with anger. He was yelling something. I couldn’t make it out. He raised his fist to hit me. I recoiled, raising my arms to block the blow. But it never came. I was back amongst the stone, the shelves, the books.

Catching my breath, I stood up, and though I wanted more than ever to be away from this place, I slowed my pace to keep from repeating that unpleasant experience.

 Eventually, the hallway opened onto a vast expanse of platforms and the web of wooden footbridges that connected them. Below, nothing but blackness. Each platform looked similar—rocky outcroppings, each featuring a small wooden table. That was all I could make out from my vantage point.

But one element of the room was indeed comforting: all the footbridges led upward. The gradient was slight, but the only way was up.

So I started across one, taking my time, careful not to slip or stumble as the old wood creaked beneath my feet. Though I tried my hardest, I couldn’t help but look down.

It wasn’t that the ground beneath was a great distance away—no. There was no ground at all. If I slipped, I would fall into infinite nothingness. But I wouldn’t slip.

With a sigh, I stepped onto the first platform, relieved to have solid ground beneath my feet. And here, I could finally see what was on the tables.

They were books indeed—if you could call what was stored down in that cavern books. But they were different. Unlike the living, fleshy volumes I had seen behind me, these were dried up. They had once been alive, but now they were shriveled and hard. Somehow, that made them more austere. Less disgusting, at least.

Still, I had no desire to interact with anything down there more than I had to. So, I continued on to the next platform.

Each of the footbridges had its own unique character. Some felt sturdier than others, but all of them were bridges I would have avoided if I could. Platform to platform, I traveled slowly upward, with nothing new to see on each successive stop… More tables, more shriveled books.

As I ascended, I could see the last platform ahead, which I hoped would lead to my escape. I was utterly relieved when I finally reached it and found a door.

But as I hurried toward it, something on the table caught my eye.

It wasn’t a book. It was a key. Jet black with a thin silvery stripe running down the shaft.

Something about it drew me in.

I found myself stepping closer to the table, eyes fixed on it. Almost against my will—certainly against my better judgment—I reached out and touched it.

Nothing happened.

Relieved, though not entirely sure why, I picked it up, slipped it into my pocket, and turned to pass through the door. I was closer to my escape. I must have been.

At least where I stood now, it looked more like a human-made structure. A library. More grandiose and antiquated than any I was used to, certainly. Though I suppose that isn’t quite true. Having lived in Clearview my whole life, I wasn’t used to libraries at all. Still, I knew what to expect when I saw one.

I was relieved to find shelves lined with books that had paper pages and leather covers—none of that grotesque ornamentation. Passing between them, I began to feel, if not relaxed, then at least less anxious.

I didn’t stop to examine any of the books. I just walked quickly in what I hoped was the direction of the exit.

The library was massive, but I could see the far wall. It wasn’t endless. As I moved toward it, I heard something other than my own footsteps for the first time.

Someone else’s.

Muffled. Intentional.

Before I could fully process the sound, I saw her. Turning from beyond the end of a row of shelves was the librarian—the woman whose job I had stolen for the last couple of months.

She froze. So did I.

Her eyes narrowed. She tilted her pointed nose up at me, her bony fingers curling into a fist. Then she shrugged and gestured toward a doorway just visible behind her.

She turned and walked in the opposite direction.

Only then did I realize I’d been holding my breath. I let it out slowly. My whole body was tense, my hands tingling with nerves, but I forced myself onward.

*I have to get out of this awful place.*

I reached another door and finally felt as though I had stepped into a library that existed in this century. The shelves were metal now. The books looked modern. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, clearly powered by electricity instead of wax or oil.

I was close.

I kept walking, hope rising with each step—until I heard a shriek behind me.

“Thief! Thief! Come back here!”

I ran as fast as my legs would carry me, away from the sound of the librarian’s shrieks. Past shelves, over piles of books, around wooden tables—I dashed toward the far end of the room.

And then, to my horror, I found myself at a dead end.

The shouts grew louder. The footsteps, once muffled, now thundered behind me as the librarian drew closer. There was nowhere to go.

I had to hide.

I threw myself behind a cart of books, wedged between two half-assembled shelves, and crouched as low as I could. The footsteps grew louder—the huffing, the screaming. Whatever I had taken must have been important to her. To that thing.

Part of me wanted to step out and hand it back with my apologies. But I didn’t think she would be forgiving.

So I stayed hidden.

The stomping slowed, then stopped. Through a gap in the cart, saw the librarian’s lower half. Her hand flexed in front of the gray wool skirt she wore—but something was wrong.

Her fingers were abnormally long. Or were they fingers at all?

Fleshy tendrils crept from her fingertips, writhing at her side as though ready to reach out and envelop me.

No, I told myself. She won’t let me go.

I held my breath as she stomped forward again. She huffed.

“I’ll find you,” she muttered.

Then she moved off in another direction.

I waited—one minute, maybe three or four—before slowly extricating myself from my hiding place. More terrified than ever, I crept back into the open, praying I wouldn’t be seen, hoping I could find the exit.

I retraced my steps for a while, then turned down a different corridor. The silence was worse than the noise. No stomping. No shouting. Just the creak and crack of the rickety wood floor beneath my feet, each sound sending shivers up my spine.

Finally, I came to a door. It looked like a way out. Though, for all I knew, it could have been a closet or another dead end. I had no choice.

I eased it open slowly and peeked through.

It was the library I remembered. The one Eliot and I had snuck into.

I was one doorway away from freedom.

I couldn’t help myself. I broke into a mad dash—over the front desk, straight toward the exit.

And then I heard her again.

“Thief!”

I whipped around. She stood in the center of the library, arm extended. The fleshy tendrils shot forward.

I scrambled away, but one wrapped around my ankle, yanking me backward. I grasped at anything I could to keep from being dragged away from the entrance.

As I was pulled past the librarian’s desk, my hand struck something—a paper slicer. It clattered to the floor, useless as an anchor. But when the long blade detached from its base, it became a weapon.

In a terrified frenzy, I hacked at the tendril around my leg. After a few strikes, I cut it clean off—but others quickly took its place. The librarian screamed in agony as I slashed through tendril after tendril, scrambling away as fast as I could.

Then she tried something else.

She extended her other hand toward a nearby shelf. A book soared off and struck me in the head. Then another. And another.

Books bombarded me from all sides.

I raised my arms over my head and ran. Through the storm of flying volumes, I reached the front door and burst into the light of day—

Straight into Eliot’s arms.

I had never been so happy to see another person in my life.

I buried my face in his shoulder and finally let myself cry, releasing the tears I had been holding back for far too long.
