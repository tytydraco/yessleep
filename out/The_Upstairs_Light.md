It had started so small, I didn’t even notice. It was just a faint glow on the ceiling one night while I was lying in bed, half-asleep. I thought to myself, “Maybe I left the hallway light on?” But when I got up and checked, the house was pitch-black, except for that faint yellow glow spilling from the upstairs hallway.

It was the spare room.

I had not gone in there since I moved in a couple of weeks ago; the door had been locked the whole time, and no one had a key. Still, I decided to climb the stairs, with one hand brushing the cold wall until I reached the top. I could see now that the light was seeping through the door like fog. I decided to open it.

The lamp on the nightstand was on.

That was really it. Nothing else. No movement or sound. Just the smell of dust and frigid air, the kind that has been trapped in there for years. I switched off the light and went back to bed. I didn’t think about it again, at least until the next night.

2:14 a.m.

The light had come on again. As it woke me up, I thought to myself, “What is going on?” I could see it from the bottom of the stairs, but I didn’t move. I stood there listening, but there were no creaks, no footsteps, nothing, though I swear I felt something watching me. Not from the window or from outside, but from the top of the stairs.

On the third night, I decided I'd had enough. I set up my phone to record. I wanted proof. The next morning, I rushed to watch the footage, and as expected, at 2:14 a.m., the light showed up again. For about the first three seconds, nothing happened. Then, and I swear I watched that thing ten times, the shadows on the wall moved. They were not flickering shadows, though; they shifted as if something had passed in front of the lamp.

I tried to tell myself that “It was just the phone glitching.” I told myself a lot of things. But the next night, I did not sleep. I sat at the bottom of the stairs, with my flashlight off, waiting.

That's when I heard the breathing.

It was not a fast or a panicked kind of breathing; it was steady, slow, wet, human. It came from just behind the door. Each time the breathing occurred, the light would slowly dim with each exhale. 

Something shifted.

It was a shadow, crossing the hallway like someone was pacing around my house ever so slowly. The floor creaked once, twice, then disturbing silence.

I immediately turned on my flashlight and ran up the stairs, but when I reached the room with the lamp, it was empty. The lamp was unplugged, and the cord had been cut clean.

Nowadays it’s every night. Always the same, 2:14 a.m. I've been trying to sleep downstairs, but last night the glow came through the cracks in the floorboards. 

Tonight, for some reason, as I am in bed jotting this down  in my journal, trying to make sense of my thoughts, I can't help but keep looking at the ceiling. I told myself I would stop, that ignoring it would make it go away. But tonight is different, something about that glow is softer, closer. The hum in the walls hasn't stopped since it began around ten minutes ago. It still sounds like breathing if I listen too closely. 

I think I finally understand it now. It wants me to keep lying here. It wants me to stay awake.
