"Hello Captain.”

My eyes began to focus, like I had awoken from a dream. It took a moment to get my bearings. I stared at the faces in front of me, my brain failing to connect them to my memory.

“Good day Sir”

“Captain on deck!”

The USS Constellation. I snapped out of it, of course, how could I forget? I couldn’t help but feel proud. I was lucky to have the crew I did, I respected all of them, and they respected me.

“Greetings all! How are we faring? Commander Glen, anything to report?”

“No, Captain. The team is still sourcing data.”

I looked out the window of the cockpit into the blackness of space. A vast array of stars and stellar clouds in the distance.

‘What systems are we scanning currently?” I took my seat at the helm.

No one spoke for a moment.

“Well, come on now. Out with it, then.” I said laughing at their slowness.

“Right, of course Captain, we are scanning several unnamed systems in the Theta Quadrant... and uh, it’s very promising.” the Lieutenant mustered out almost halfheartedly.

Suddenly I felt a wave of dizziness. I clasped the arm of my chair and wiped my eyes with my free hand. *Why were we scanning planets again?* Suddenly it clicked.

“Well, that’s great then!” I looked around the room, nobody seemed enthused.

“Absolutely sir, I feel we will have found a suitable planet to call home in no time’ Glen said reassuringly.

“I can’t wait!” a woman in a turquoise uniform said with a beaming smile. I couldn’t help but think, something about it was forced...

“WOO! YEA!” a blond man with wavy hair and a red uniform barreled into the room, pumping his fist in the air gleefully.

“AREN’T YOU GUYS GLAD? WE’RE GOING TO FINALLY FIND OUR NEW HOME!” he was loud, but, not in the jubilant tone one would expect given the situation. Something about it seemed almost... sarcastic.

“Okay Mackleroy... yeah, we are all as glad as you. Keep it down will you?” the man who I recognized as 'Fisher' said, almost scornfully.

“What? AREN’T YOU GLAD?!” Mackleroy said with a wild looking grin while grabbing Fisher by the lapels.

“GENTLEMEN!” Glen shouted sternly.

“GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME MACKLEROY, OR YOU’RE...”

“ENOUGH!” Glen barked again.

“What’s the problem Commander? I’m just so happy we’re finally going to get off this stinkin’ ship! Aren’t you all GLAD?!” there was something sarcastic about his tone, I hadn’t imagined it.

“We ARE all GLAD... we just don’t show it like you. Now sit down.” the woman in turquoise said sharply, her name... it was Jean. We were friends I thought.

“Yeah... whatever” Mackleroy said bitterly and sat down.

The lights on the control panel flashed an array of different colors, I furrowed my brow as I watched them. I realized I had tuned out again, drawn in by dancing blips.

“Captain, why don’t we have lunch?” Glen said placing his arm around my shoulder.

---

The kitchen was nearly empty other than a few tables. Some men sat at one of them turned and looked to us as we entered. They nodded and turned, back to each other. I could hear them laughing heartily. Finally some levity I thought. The commander and I sat down at the table and one of the crewmen brought us our food.

“Radish and beef stew, your favorite sir” he said placing the tray in front of me. In my peripheral, I saw the group seated at the table again, looking over their shoulders towards us. They were laughing still... were they laughing at me? Surely not, and if they were, well I wasn’t the type of Captain who couldn’t take a joke.

I ignored it.

“Thank you... um Pierre” his name almost escaped me, I looked to Glen.

"Eh hmm, my name isn't Pierre sir... it's David. Remember?" he looked worried.

"I'm sorry... I was sure your name was... Pierre. Why did I think it was Pierre?"

"Sorry, you'll have to excuse me Captain. Don't worry about the name thing." he said as he walked away quickly. I wouldn't let it get to me, it was a simple mistake, I carried on ignoring what had happened.

“Well... according to the debriefing this morning the prospects for a new host planet are quite good if I understood correctly?” I spoke asserting my role as captain, I might have been a little out of sorts but I wouldn’t let the crew notice.

He cleared his throat “Ughmm, yes... yes sir. The prospects are quite good. Lieutenant Daryl says he is quite... um confident.” he took a long sip of water, gulping loudly as he swallowed.

There was something he wasn’t telling me.

“Glen... look. Is there?” I paused, rephrasing.

“This morning I woke up...” he interrupted me.

“Captain, please... we don’t need. Oh! Look it’s Officer Mona.” he waved.

“Mona” I said about to stand to greet her. Her smile was radiant. Her wavy blond curls matched the yellow hue of her uniform.

“Hello Captain” she said placing her hand on my back.

“I just wanted to say hello, I was held up... in engineering, this morning and missed the debriefing. I heard we may soon be on our new home!” she was giddy, she leaned in close placing her other hand on my shoulder. I was some years her senior, but it would be a lie to say she didn't spark something in me.

“Now this is what I’d expect when hearing we’re about to achieve the goal we have so long set out for! It’s been nearly...” I paused the fog clouding my memory. I began to stutter.

“Nearly... n-n” I couldn’t find the words.

“Ten years sir! We left ten years ago sir. Remember” Glen said laughing.

“Right... ten years... since we left home" I said my voice trailing off.

"Well... you've been under a lot of stress captain, and with all that happened, you're still recovering." Mona said clearly concerned.

"R-right... with the incident at Gamma 3. Sir are you still experiencing side effects?" Glen mustered out.

"Well... that's what I wanted to talk to you about..." I said feeling slightly confused.

"Well Captain, I have to go now... just don't forget our dinner plans next week alright" she said tapping me on the shoulder, nodding to Glen and taking her leave.

Glen explained that months ago we had surveyed a planet and there had been an accident. I had encountered a rare form of flora that emitted a noxious gas, evidently one which caused lapses in memory.

"We figured it would only last a few days. So you are still experiencing symptoms? This is concerning. I'll inform Doctor Leung, sir" Glen said looking deeply at me.

"Alright... I'll make my way over there then. That is if I still know the way there!" I said with a feigned laugh, yet feeling a strange sense of unease. Did I know the way there?

---

As I made my way to the med bay, I racked my brain trying to account for the events of the last few weeks. It was strange, although I felt l could recall a vague sense of everything prior to this morning it still felt like I was forgetting something. But why?

We had left Earth in search of a new home. I assembled the crew from a select team of highly trained individuals... I was the captain because I... I... was a high level officer... or no, I was a CEO?

Was I losing it? I hoped the doctor would have answers but our meeting was rather brief. He almost seemed surprised to see me. "Ca-captain? Is everything alright"

"Well no, unfortunately. It's that neurotoxin again... you see I woke this morning with some lapses in memory" I said trying to sound as certain as I could.

"Oh! Right, the neurotoxin... yes certainly. Captain I can tell you with complete confidence the neurotoxin is nothing to worry about. I have encountered this many times, what you are experiencing is very common. You should be right as rain again in a few days."

I left the office feeling slightly better, was that it then? I just had to keep it together. I then made my way back to my quarters to rest at the doctors recommendation.

---

Upon waking from my nap, I went to regain my bearings with the ships layout. I overheard officer Jean and Mackleroy whispering in the halls. I listened in, the best I could from out of sight. I do not believe they noticed me. Things are not good here on the USS Constellation.

The conversation went as follows:

"I am so sick and tired of this crap. How long are we gonna be at this for? His memory is completely shot! If I have to hear about prospective planets one more time I'm going to lose it!" Mackleroy was whispering furiously under his breath.

"Mack... calm down. This is what we signed up for, remember? We're going to be here looking for our new home planet for as long as it takes, got it!?"

"Pfft! I'm sick of it Jean! Hey, you know what? I might go leak the fuel out of the tanks and stop this ship dead in it's tracks just for the fun of it!" he scoffed and then hammered the wall with his fist in frustration.

"Hey... not a bad idea! Should I decouple the escape pods?" Were they insane? How could they laugh at jeopardizing all of our lives?

"Now you're talking!" Mackleroy said enthusiastically.

"Okay... it's a plan then. Commander Glen already said he'd take over once Captain finally loses it." Jean said, both in hysterics.

I was stunned. Mutiny? On my ship? Not on my watch. Though I would have to be careful, as even Commander Glen appeared to be in on it. How long before Mackleroy made his way to the fuel compartment? I needed to act... but who could I trust?

Mona.

I ran to her quarters, the halls mostly empty. Where was everyone? Was Mackleroy gathering his supporters for the mutiny? Why would he do this now? We were so close to our destination! None of this made sense.

I called for Mona outside her door.

"Mona! I need to speak with you. Quickly!" the door glided open and Mona stood there with her eyebrow raised.

"Yes Captain... what is it...?" she said almost seeming annoyed, her demeanor not nearly as welcoming as it was at lunch.

"I must speak with you... I no longer know who I can trust. It's Mackleroy and Jean they're planning a mu..." my mouth fell open as Fisher walked out from the other room in her quarters wearing only jeans. He leaned his muscled frame on the arch with his elbow and rested his head on his hand.

"Hey Captain... what's going on?" he said, his voice as if he was talking to a child.

"F-fisher..." I said, a ringing in my ears starting. Why was he with Mona alone like this? Weren't Mona and I... I put my head in my hands in confusion. I took a breath and ignored whatever thoughts were tearing at my mind. It could wait.

"I can trust you two... but the others: Mackleroy, Jean... even Glen. They are planning a mutiny." I said in a hushed rage, the words bubbling up.

"Oh!" Fisher said looking to Mona concerned, who was now on the bed with her hands in her head facing away from me.

"Mona... what's wrong?" I said in shock.

"No... no it's nothing captain... I just. I'm just, AGH... F-... come on!" she said seemingly infuriated yelling into the ceiling and hitting her bed.

She composed herself "It's just, well I can't believe they would try something like this! I mean, when were so close and all." 

"Right... don't worry captain. No one is going to take the ship. You go to your room and lock down. We can't lose you. I'll send security over as soon as possible."

"But Mackleroy!" I said

""Don't worry about Mackleroy Sir, I'm, uh... on it" for a second he flinched... was he in on it too? I couldn't trust him. I couldn't trust Mona either. I would have to stop Mackleroy myself.

"Right, I'll go to my room then" I said and ran out the door.

---

Once I made it to my quarters, I grabbed my laser pistol. There was no time to waste. I had to stop Mackleroy before he depleted the fuel containers and pray that Fisher is on the right side of this mutiny. I might be losing some memories but I'm not going to lose my ship.

I sprinted as fast I could to the fuel reserves. I passed the doors helm, there was Jean and Glen talking with the crew. No... I thought, but my fear was soon multiplied. Looking out the bow of the ship, I no longer saw the sea of stars and clouds from earlier. All that remained now was an empty darkness. Where had they taken us? Had they already commandeered the ship?

Suddenly the lights turned off and the amber warning light on the wall began to cycle. Down the hall I thought I saw a shadow. I had seen enough episodes of... episodes of... my thoughts trailed off, something was wrong. Had the ship been breached by an alien life form?

"Captain?" One of the crew said as I ran past.

"There's no time! Go and find Fisher immediately!"

"Right... of course sir" he said and jogged off.

I slammed the door to the fuel tanks open. Not now... who would have cut the power?

I stumbled over to one of the fuel compartments and turned the release valve.

Nothing.

I tried another.

Nothing.

I was too late. I let out a primal wail. We would be consigned to floating in space for the rest of our miserable lives, and if Jean sabotaged the escape pods it was truly over. Why Mackleroy... why? Tears began to roll down my face. I heard the door open, It was him.

"Hey Captain... what are you doing in here? Are you okay?" he said in a mocking tone of consolation.

"You bastard! You've consigned us to death!" I said enraged pulling the laser pistol from it's holster.

"Easy Captain... let's stay calm okay." he placed his fingers on his earpiece and spoke.

"He's in storage. Yes, he's okay. I'm trying to calm him down. Okay." he looked at me like a wounded animal. I started to feel sick, why was he so caviler? He began to walk closer to me.

"STAY BACK!" I shouted. I started to feel dizzy again and my ears began to ring.

"Captain it's me... remember? Roy Brown? You're a big fan of my work?" he was right in front of me know. The laser pistol shook in my hand. Roy Brown? My head started to ache.

"GET BACK MACKLEROY! GET BACK" I was screaming.

Mackleroy placed his hand on the laser gun, he was going to disarm me. I pulled the trigger expecting him to fly backwards, but, nothing happened. Why? Why didn't it work?! I used the but of the gun and struck him as hard as I could on the head.

"OW!" he screamed grabbing his head. He let down his guard, now was the time to strike. I began to throw a barrage of punches at him.

"Get off of me!" he yelled. Suddenly Fisher and Mona appeared with the rest of the crew behind them.

"Dr. Leung he's in here!" Fisher called.

They had betrayed me... but why? I could barely speak, my lips and jaw moved up and down but no sound came out. I backed up slowly against the wall. Mona ran up to me and placed her hand on my face "Everything is going to be all right Sir." I felt a sharp pain in my leg and saw her pull a needle from it. As I slumped down against the wall my vision began to fade.

I saw Fisher approach the far wall. He removed a panel and I watched as he pushed. Light beamed into the room, and a breeze, there was grass on the ground.

I lost consciousness.

---

"So is that all you can recall from what happened over the last few days" Dr. Leung said staring at me from my bedside. Sun rays shined from the large windows outside. A swallow sat perched chirping from one of the branches and fluttered away.

"Yes..." I said defeated.

"Alright. Sir. I'll be honest, I cannot advise we continue this practice any longer. Your condition is only getting worse, and soon enough I doubt you will remember much of anything at all. If anything we are worsening it, you living in a fantasy like this." He sighed and stared out the window.

"I know... but... but... it's what I want." I said ashamed of myself.

"What's the difference if I end up in a care facility or the 'USS Constellation' care facility." he was right, but I while I could still argue, I would.

"Alright..." he said resting his head on his palm, seemingly exhausted.

"I don't know how much longer you have. Your condition is deteriorating by the day. I'll tell Glen... agh... I mean Thomas to get the crew together. Just so you know Brown is going to want at least double what you were paying him before."

"It's fine..." the money was nothing to me. I said coughing

"We will wait another day for you to stabilize and then we will return to... the Constellation. If that's what you really want. Though, like I said it is getting harder for me to condone."

"It is." I said looking to the ground.

Dr. Leung left and I stared around the richly adorned room. Wooden paneling and gold fixtures. I looked out the window of my estate, this place was not really my home. I owned it, but it was not somewhere I cared to be.

I looked at the mementos on the wall, reminders of the gargantuan fortune I had amassed when I was a much much younger man. I flicked on the TV in front of me and began to switch between films.

I felt my eyes begin to water as I flipped through the films.

"STAR SEARCHER" staring Roy Brown and Pierre Cook.

"SPACE FLEET" staring Thomas Darner

and finally "THE USS CONSTELLATION" staring Sarah Dale and Scott Hunter.

On screen was Mona and Fisher. I felt the dizziness set in and my vision begin to fade.

Like I had awoken from a dream, my eyes began to focus...

"Hello Captain.”
