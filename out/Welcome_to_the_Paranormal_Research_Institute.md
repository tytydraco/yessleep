Welcome to the Paranormal Research Institute

Welcome Researcher, to the PRI. Should you be reading this, it means your application to the Paranormal Research Institute has been accepted. This letter will be going over the basics of your position, and some other important aspects we deem would be necessary to your success within the PRI. 

The Paranormal Research Institute is an organisation founded to research and exterminate creatures dubbed as “Anomalies”. Anomalies can be classified as beings which possess powers or abilities which defy our current laws of physics, nature and chemistry. Your job as a researcher is to assist in the study of these anomalies.

Throughout your position, you will be stationed at Site-███ , one of our most prestigious sites in the Organisation. Within the site, there are three sectors, each having their own unique purpose but remain essential to the site’s operations. You will be allocated in the Research Wing, and will conduct your duties from there. However, you may be reallocated to other sectors for research or seminars throughout your career. 

As per Institute Protocol, we have attached a list of rules to assist you throughout your career within the Paranormal Research Institute. It is imperative you follow these rules at all times, failure to do so will result in possible repercussions. 

Rule 1: It is imperative that you keep your identification card on you at all times whilst present in the facility. You may be asked to present identification to members of security at certain periods of the day, thus it is important that you keep your identification card ready. Should you not have an identification card, or have lost your identification card, please visit the logistics department in the Research Wing.

Rule 1a: As per Rule 1, all members of personnel whilst on duty possess an identification card. If you see anyone without an identification card, or a member who refuses to show their identification card, please report them to security. The security office is located in the Research Wing, or you may call the Security Hotline via your pager.

Rule 2: Your designated shift hours are 8am-6pm (however should you need to stay overnight, a dorm will be provided to you), during this time you will be assigned to the research wing and thus will carry out your designated tasks. Should you need to leave the facility for any reason, please notify both the Security Office and the on-site Head Researcher. Furthermore, should you be suffering from hunger we have a 24/7 cafeteria located in the Research Wing, feel free to utilise this whenever you please, we have a wide array of delectable food and drinks available at your disposal. However, should you plan to visit the cafeteria, please make sure to notify the on-site Head Researcher.

Rule 3: It is imperative that you stick to your allocated zone, which is in the Research Zone. As mentioned, in the research zone you will be conducting most of your duties and responsibilities within your time at the PRI. However, you may occasionally need to visit the Light and Medium Containment Zones (abbreviated LCZ and MCZ) for research purposes, seminars etc. Should you need to visit these zones, follow all necessary protocol and instructions regarding these zones, they are there for your safety. Failure to follow designated instructions will result in repercussions.

Rule 3a: Should you be present in the Light or Medium Containment Zone (abbreviated LCZ and MCZ), there is a minutiae chance that you may come across a sector labelled “ANIMATIONAL ANOMALIES”. Under no circumstances should you enter the sector, this sector does not exist and is not part of the facility. It is unknown how the appearance of this section occurs, however research on this anomaly is ongoing. Should you encounter this sector, report its location to the Security Office.

Rule 3b: Should you again be present in the Light or Medium Containment Zone (abbreviated LCZ and MCZ), there is again a minutiae chance that you may encounter an individual in a Test Subject Uniform. Under no circumstances should you approach this individual. The Paranormal Research Institute does not possess any test subjects as of our strict abidance to the Geneva Convention rules and regulations. Should you see this individual, report him to the security office immediately and slowly remove yourself from the area. 

Rule 3c: Should you be present in the Light or Medium Containment Zone (abbreviated LCZ and MCZ) and suffer from auditory or visual hallucinations at any point throughout your visit, inject yourself with your vial of ███. ███ is a specialised psychological drug which prevents and deters external influence on the brain. You may stock up on ███ in the Medical Department located in the Research Wing. 
Rule 3d: If you see a small group of children dressed in traditional 1900s attire, do not approach them under any circumstances and instead report them to the security office. If they see you, remove yourself from their line of sight immediately, they will try to find you. Should this happen, page security and inform them of your situation.

Rule 4: The site utilises an alarm system to effectively broadcast information across the facility. If at any time during your shift you hear the words “CODE RED”, immediately cease what you are doing and make your way to the bunker. There are two bunkers located in the facility, each marked respectively on your map. Whilst proceeding to the bunker, follow all instructions of Security personnel, along with standard protocol. If for any reason you are unable to make your way to a bunker, hide in whatever nearby room is closest to you and pray they do not find you. 

That concludes this letter, should you have any other questions please feel free to contact any member of the Research or Administrative Department on your first shift. Furthermore, please visit the Logistics Department to obtain your new Identification Card and more information on your position, good luck in your new career.
