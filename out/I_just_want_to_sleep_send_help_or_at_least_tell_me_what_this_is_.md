Ok, ok, ok I don't know what to do. This is the last place I have to write this. I've tried calling the police, fire department. My family, hell, even my neighbors and I haven't gotten anything in hours now and it's driving me insane. It's this GOD AWFUL SCRATCHING. Every second it's under my floor. No other noise. I tried looking in my basement to see if an animal had gotten stuck to see if there was anything that could make that god awful noise. It's not loud, it's this awful scratching and tapping. I've been listening to it for hours now. At first it started in the middle of the day and it's now approaching midnight. 



I tried to go outside during the first hour just to get away from the noise but the door wouldn't budge. There is this awful spit? Slime? Drool? I don't know how but it's all around my door. Same with my windows along with hundreds of little scratches on the glass. The noise had only come from the floor SO WHY THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT ON MY DOOR. I've tried to break the door out of desperation. Taking a hammer and nail to it. I broke the window on the door but that shit was still around it. I tried to move it but it wouldn't budge. It has this warm feeling to it and the texture is ugghhhhhhh. I tried to push past it with my hand but it was so damn thick that it let me through. It was such an awkward angle and I just hated every second of it. It's like trying to hold a large pile of vomit. Chunky but gooey



You can get it off but it's a bitch to do so. I had to pour some bleach and goo gone on it. I would let it sit for a few seconds and then try to wash it off in the shower. I had to be careful not to get any of that stuff on the door handle to the bathroom. I repeated this process till it finally came off. 



My place is a small place. Single story with only four rooms total. When you walk in the bathroom is on the right and the living room is also my kitchen. Then there is my office room and my bedroom. No hallways, it's all pretty cozy or that's the excuse I tell myself for why I live like this. There is a small hatch in my office room that leads to the basement. It's a small metal trapdoor looking thing. If you ever wanted a place to describe single guy then i could show yah 



It took 3 hours to get that crap off. God it's awful. The best i can describe it is like almost see thru tar. It's not super dense so you can see stuff on the other side but only shapes. I've tried to take some of my cleaning stuff to the tar on my door. If I was making progress I couldn't tell. I'm going to try and go to sleep but this damn scratching and tapping is just so annoying. Not too loud to hurt your ears but it's stuck in your head almost replacing the sound of my breathing. It's hard to complete a thought as every time I think I have to talk out loud just to hear myself or at least anything other than that damn scratching. 



4 hours in and I thought it was a code of some kind. Maybe morse so I looked up some morse translator online and when I tried to decipher what it was constantly drilling into my ears, all nonsense so it's nothing. I tried tapping back, yelling ect.. Nothing. I'm lucky I have some ibuprofen in here with me. I'm going to try and go to sleep. But it is almost impossible.



Especially with some of the shit I have been seeing. Usually it's out of the corner of my eye but sometimes I will see something trying to take a peek at me through the window but then scurry off when it sees me start to look in that direction. It wouldn't just be one either. It would be 2 or 3 of them. It's impossible to get good look at them due to the tar stuff and the fact that they shimmy away so quickly.  I have already covered the hole in my door with a small 2 by 4 where I broke the window and used a impact to make sure it doesn't come free from anything. After words I caulked the sides . What ever is out there I don't want seeping into here  



I have a gun in here with me. It's just a small shotgun. Single barrel. It's made so after you fire a shot you have to release the barrel and then load another shell. I'm not a gun guy. Always hated them but kept it just in case. I live alone in the woods next to some nice old lady. I usually help her out from time to time and vice versa. We keep an eye on each other. Last year when she first moved in she didn't like me but after a druggie had broken the back window of her car one night and she frantically called me at 1 in the morning she has been a lot nicer ever since. 



But I've been trying to watch out the window and from what little I see . Nothing has come home for her. No car, no house light. That is the least of my worries right now though. That damn scratching still wont stop. I keep thinking that I should shoot my floor where I think whatever is scratching to just get it to stop. But I saw a few of those things by the window. I'm not stupid enough to make entrance for them. Or not desperate enough yet. 



I have plenty of food because I was supposed to cook for some of my family that was supposed to come over for the holiday. The water still runs and those things still are only just watching me and i don't know what to do other than just sit here and wait 



PLEASE I JUST WANT THE SCRATCHING TO STOP AND THE DUMB TAR CRAP TO GO AWAY ANY INFO IS GREATLY APPRECIATED. I JUST WANT TO SLEEP
