It wasn’t like Bo to be late. Ever. 

Mike, Rochelle, and I sat at our usual table in the back corner of the Starbucks, not drinking coffee, and wondering what was going on. 

My three best friends when I was 13 were Bo, Mike, and Rochelle. We had a tradition of meeting every Saturday morning at the Starbucks in our hometown. We never bought anything. Half of the baristas would kick us out within 10 minutes. That was kind of part of the fun. 

Bo was one of those kids who was always wise beyond her years. The ringleader of the group, she always had the plan, she always was the one to talk back to adults, and she was always the first one to the Starbucks every Saturday. 

Bo finally came through the front door 15 minutes late. We were more shocked by how disheveled she looked than her tardiness. She was never one to not be on-point and her hair was a mess, no make up, and she was still in her pajamas, dirty pajamas. 

“You’re never going to believe what I’m about to tell you, but you HAVE to, *please*,” Bo started in on us before she even sat down at the table. 

Mike, Rochelle, and I waited with baited breath. 

“I’m communicating to you all from the future right now - technically. My future self. This is my body, today, but my mind is in the future,” Bo stated, completely serious. 

Mike, Rochelle, and I looked at each other - each clearly ready to bust up laughing. *This had to be a joke.* 

“I’M NOT FUCKING JOKING!” Bo yelled at us so loud other people in the place looked over at us. 

This was entirely out of character for Bo. She NEVER lost her cool. 

“We’re all being stalked,” Bo said, quieter. 

Bo’s statement instantly froze Rochelle’s face. 

“Someone has been following me,” Rochelle blurted out once Bo got her statement out. “An old man.”

“There’s a monster that’s going to kill us all if we don’t stop it,” Bo explained with our attention more than secured. “But I’m communicating backward, because there’s a way we can stop it.”

Bo reminded us of a couple weekends before when we had been playing in the woods. We had started a fire, having fun, pretending like we were camping. 

What we didn’t know was we didn’t actually put the fire out and it spread to the cabin of an old couple who had been squatting deep in the woods for years. The husband and wife had spent decades lurking in the dark of the forest, dropping psychedelic mushrooms and experimenting with potions and the afterlife. 

They were sleeping when the fire reached their cabin. The husband was able to get out. The wife didn’t. 

The husband had to listen to his wife burn to death inside the cabin as it burnt to the ground. He could still hear the screams even after it had been reduced to ashes. He knew exactly what her cries from the beyond were telling him to do. 

Revenge started to take over his soul. He locked onto the four of us, and he wasn’t going to stop until all of us were dead. 

I didn’t believe Bo. I usually did, but nothing about this seemed plausible. I agreed with her at that moment and went home and wondered how she lost her mind. I don’t know, it was a small town, kids lost their minds and got into drugs all the time.

I went about my life. Family dinner. Chores. Video games. No worries about anything. 

I was pissed. My older brother ignored his duty to bring in wood for the fireplace and then took off to a friend’s house so my dad made me go out and get some. Well after dark. 

The pile of firewood was at the far back of our property. A little ways into a patch of woods. Cold. Dark. Windy. I cursed my brother as I filled up a wheelbarrow and tried to fight my internal dialog of fear. 

I also cursed Bo while I was out there. *Why was she putting all of that weirdo bullshit into our heads?* I could tell the other friends believed it too. I also cursed the town, and drugs. It was only a matter of time before one of us got all messed up. It was sheer odds. 

I saw him out of the corner of my eye just as I had finished loading up the wheelbarrow. It shocked me and I knocked it over - spilling the wood all over the forest floor. 

There was an old man walking through the woods not far from me. Dressed in winter gear, I could barely see his face through the long, silver hair hanging down from the inside of the hood of his sweatshirt. 

He wasn’t far from me and he was coming right for me, moving through the brush. 

I was momentarily frozen, but eventually broke out of it and ran away before he was just a few feet away from me. I ran all the way to the house and never looked back to see if he was still there. 

I didn’t say anything to my parents. I just went to my room. I texted Bo that we needed to talk. 

Hours went by. The text was “delivered,” but not “read.”

I reached out to the rest of the group. We agreed to meet up at the school and then go to Bo’s house. 

Bo’s family wasn’t the best. Case in point, neither of her parents were home when we got to her house and I knew neither worked. They were assuredly out getting drunk or doing drugs, or both. Only Bo’s sketchy sister, Ali, and her even sketchier boyfriend, Travis, were there. They let us into the house and we went to Bo’s room. 

I smelled the burning stench before we even got to her room. It overtook me though, once we threw open Bo’s bedroom door. 

I’ll give limited detail about what waited for us in her Bo’s bedroom. Not just because I want to save your stomach, but because I could barely look or bring myself to look.

What I vaguely saw and heard was it appeared someone had taken a torch to Bo’s face and burned it until she died. She was tied to her bed and based on the mess in the space, she had put up a fight. 

It appeared she had kept putting up a fight after she had died as well. We discovered when a piece of paper drifted from her body and to the three of us as we stood heartbroken and horrified in the doorway. 

*It was a note from Bo.* 

Bo let us know that that she had been murdered by the old man whose wife we had murdered. He found her first, but his intentions were to kill all of us. 

Bo’s spirit had found a way to get back into her body so she could at least try and forewarn us of what was going to happen to us back at Starbucks, though she could not save herself. She would also do her best to help us move forward.

And we were going to need it. 

The old man who had killed her and who was stalking the rest of us was evil, and relentless, and out for revenge for what he believed we did to his wife. He wasn’t going to stop. He would follow us wherever we would go. We could not run. 

The old man was especially dangerous because he and his wife were deep into the occult. As were Bo’s parents, and she knew of its real powers because of that. 

Bo only knew one person who could help. Her parents’ friend - Maye - a psychic who lived up in the hills. Off the grid. She was the only person who was probably more skilled in the occult than the man who had locked onto them. 

We needed to go to Maye immediately. Fuck school. Fuck their parents. We didn’t have time for any of that. We would start to get picked off one by one if we didn’t start moving quickly. 

Bo left us directions to Maye’s house in the woods. She also told us where the keys to her parents' spare care out behind the house were.

We had barely finished reading her note when we heard a conversation in front of the house. Someone who we couldn’t make out was talking to Bo’s sister and boyfriend, and it didn’t sound like the conversation was going well. 

Then we heard a struggle. We knew not to waste anymore time. 

We left Bo’s body in her room and went out the window. We got into her parents’ beat up extra car, fired it up and took off through the driveway. 

Rochelle was behind the wheel, the only one who had ever driven. She sped us out onto the street, but not before we saw the old man, standing in Bo’s front yard, blood splashed on his white sweatshirt. 

He glared at us as we drove off into the night.
