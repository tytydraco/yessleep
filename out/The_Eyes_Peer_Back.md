I’ve never really been that good of a person growing up. I’ve always skipped school, had horrendous grades, and I always had a general disregard for rules. To put it lightly, I was not going to be nominated for ‘Most Likely to Succeed’ anytime soon. My friend Molly was the exact opposite however. She was bright, always tried in her classes, and had way better marks than me. I had to admit, I was pretty jealous. But she wasn’t the kind of person to gloat and tease me for not having as good of grades as her. She sorta saw me as someone lost in their own teenage hubris and tried her best to keep me in line with varying results. At times, we were mistaken as brother and sister or boyfriend and girlfriend. And I was teased for a whole month for that. I surprisingly felt a little bad about my kind of crowd mixing in with the wrong people, but reassurance from Molly made me forget about it.

One thing about me that Molly knew very well was that I liked to explore abandoned places. No matter how illegal it was, I still found myself exploring every nook and cranny of any place I could find. Unfortunately, I was running out of places that were suitably ‘creepy’ for my taste. Now when I say creepy, I mean just the occasional urban legend surrounding the place that would ultimately be disproven very quickly. The only things that I found interesting about the places I went to were the gang markings that must’ve been a decade old and the occasional crackhead that couldn’t be bothered to even acknowledge my existence. Either way, my town doesn’t have much to offer when it comes to exploration.

Something that piqued my interest was the local zoo. It wasn’t abandoned whatsoever, hell, it was the exact opposite during its opening hours. Hundreds of people bustle in and see the animals every day because it’s the one of the only things to do in this town. I have to admit, it is pretty entertaining to see the animals every once in a while. But the reason why I saw this location as perfect was the fact that the place wasn’t completely empty aside from the animals. There’s this group of animal rights activists that try to break in and “release the animals from their torturous confinement”. Almost everyone hates this group and they’ve made more than one attempt to release them from their cages. One time they released them during the day and it caused quite a scene. Everyone had to leave early so that the animals could be put back into their zones and cages. With all of this said and done, I decided it would be quite the experience to maybe catch one of these attempts and see it for myself.

At school, I told Molly my plan and she laughed at my idea. She said that although it would be funny to see them in the act, I did have a chance of being caught by one of those lunatics and who knows what they’ll do to me. I told her that I’ve been doing this for a few years so I don’t think those idiots would know that I was ever there. I then asked if she could join me for the venture later tonight. She, of course, declined but I insisted. She said that she wasn’t experienced at all in whatever I do and that she doesn’t want to risk herself getting caught. I told her that even someone like her could do it and that two is better than one. She finally changed her mind when I told her that I’ll cover our butts when we get caught and tell them that it was my idea. She reluctantly agreed and she said she needed some rush in her life at some point anyway.

…

Later that night, We met up at a safe distance from the zoo’s entrance. We wanted to see the activists going in ourselves just so that we weren’t there for nothing. We waited in the dark for so long that I had thought they weren’t coming after all. The only light that illuminated the place was a lone street light that lit up the bold lettering on the sign up front that read, “Forest Ridge Public Zoo”. We decided to sneak around the side of the park property and see if we can find a ladder on the back of one of the shops that built their back walls bulging out of the side of the wall. As we rounded the corner, I shined my flashlight to the white backs of the buildings that lined up against the wall. That’s when I noticed a hanging ladder made of thick, white laced rope that was tightened by several knots.

“I guess they beat us to the punch. I didn’t even see them, did you?” I whispered to Molly.

“No, I couldn’t see much. It’s really dark out here. Either way, you wanna go first?” Molly offered.

I scrambled up the ladder and Molly soon followed. We overlooked the main entrance to the zoo and saw a little light flicker its way in different directions. I ducked under the ledge on the roof and quietly told Molly to do the same.

“Did you see that?” I said in a hushed voice.

“I think so. Who was that?” Molly whispered with a hint of worry in her voice.

“Calm down. I think that was a security guard. We need to get down to the main floor and see where these people went.” I whispered with a hint of worry in myself. We were both in new territory and I didn’t know the repercussions for getting caught.

I peeked over the ledge and only saw the faint shadows of the exhibits and no sign of life anywhere.

“The coast is clear. Follow me.” I whispered as I made my way to the rooftop door that led into the store below. I tried the knob but it wouldn’t budge. I’ve run into this situation many times before, so I pulled out my trusty screwdriver and my set of bobby pins. I inserted the bobby pins into the lock and felt the pressure of the springs in the door knob release. I carefully pushed up the springs into the cylinder and felt the oh so satisfying click of the dead bolt being released from the rusty strike plate. I signaled Molly that the way was clear and I carefully opened the door that led to the dark, concrete staircase that sent a pit of dread into both of us.

“We need to be careful down there. Not only do we need to avoid those activists, but we also can’t wake up the animals.” I whispered clearly and seriously.

“Okay.” Molly whispered back with some uneasiness in her voice.

We both crept down the stairs and took great care in not making any noise on the way down. As we were entering the last section of the staircase, we were met with a tight, pitch black hallway with a checkered pattern tile floor. I took out two pocket flashlights and handed one of them to Molly. I clicked the button on the light and a beam of light shone the ground below me.

“We can try the side door. Over here.” Molly whispers, pointing to the far left of the gift shop.

“Nice catch.” I whispered back. We made our way over to the side door and tried to quietly open the door only to be stopped by some boxes from the outside

“Damn. The boxes are in the way.” I hushed in frustration.

“Try and push them from the inside.” Molly suggested.

“No. I can’t risk the noise. We’ll need to go out the front.”

As we snuck to the front of the store, we heard footsteps coming to the store and we quickly split up into the aisles of the gift store. I turned my flashlight off and hid behind a shelf that had a bunch of stuffed animals on the shelves. As I sat there crouched behind the shelf, I saw a beam of light scan over my head. I heard footsteps slowly approaching my shelf and I quickly switched spots and dove into another aisle. I peeked over and I saw a black figure with a cap on. The figure shone a light onto my previous spot and I could just see the outline of the bold lettering on his jacket reading: SECURITY. I stayed quiet for what seemed like hours. That is until I heard the sound of the door opening and closing, and the footsteps fading away. I breathed a sigh of relief and slowly peeked out from my hiding spot. I looked at the window and saw nothing but the glare of the glass pane window.

I looked around for Molly and saw that she was hiding under the cashier’s desk. She looked petrified and felt glad that the guard was gone. I couldn’t blame her. It was her first time and these moments can get very tense.

“You did good. That was a close call.” I whispered with some relief in my voice.

“You did too. He almost caught you!” Molly whispered.

“He didn’t even spot you. Are you sure you haven’t done this before?” I said mockingly.

“Oh shut up Jack.” She said playfully.

“Anyway, we should probably move. We can’t be caught in the same place.” I whispered with caution.

We quickly moved to the front door and I looked through the glass door to see if the security guard was still around. I couldn’t see much movement besides our shadows and I confirmed it was safe to go outside.

Beyond the glass door of the gift shop, most of the lights on the walkways were turned off. This was good for us as we needed to stay in the darkness to hide much easier. We carefully crawled and hid behind the zoo benches that were spread out in between the square bushes and the tall trees that covered our every move. We eventually got to a crossroads with a wooden sign that pointed to different directions to the zoo’s various different exhibits.

As I was pondering on which way we should go, Molly pointed to a sign on the floor that led to the big cats section. I picked the sign up and saw that it had the activists logo on the front.

“I guess we should start here.” I quietly said looking at the arrow pointing to the big cats exhibit followed by a little drawing of a lion right next to it.

We followed the path that was enclosed by thick, jungle-like trees that had their branches somewhat sticking out of the foliage and just intersecting the main concrete path.

“Jeez, they should really trim these trees a bit.” Molly remarked

“Yeah, they get pretty annoying when they're on the pathway.” I said, with a hint of annoyance at the pervasive foliage.

“What, you have experience?” Molly snarked.

“Yeah, I've tripped on these damn things so many times that I lost count.”

“Wow. Shouldn't the zoo do something about this? Isn't this a tripping hazard?”

“You bet your ass it is. I'd tell ya if my mom hadn't reported this place more than once. But the zoo doesn't do a damn thing about it. To be honest, I'm surprised they haven't gotten sued yet.” I said with a hint of comedy embedding in my anecdote.

“Wait, did you see that?” I said leading us behind a bush.

“What is it?” Molly asked with confusion on why we hid so suddenly.

“That.” I pointed at two mounds on the floor with two cube shaped objects next to each other.

“Do you want me to check?” I said with some shakiness in my voice.

“Are you sure? Is it safe?” Molly worriedly asked.

“I don't know. I'll check really quickly and see if it's safe.”

“Okay.”

I took a deep breath and gathered as much courage as I could. I got my flashlight and clicked it on. Its beam shined ahead of me and I stalked forward into the dim path that laid before me. As I got closer, I noticed a dark red liquid was sprayed over the gray pavement and an iron smell wafted into my nostrils. My heart dropped once my flashlight beam laid over the two mounds. The two mounds were barely recognizable as human. Chunks of flayed flesh surrounded them and their internal organs were splattered on the concrete with bite marks on the legs, hands, arms, and almost all over their torsos. I nearly threw up at the sight of it and I was too sick to notice that Molly had noticed the carnage as well.

“What happened here?” Molly said, shocked at the scene before her.

“I don't know. Did we just witness a murder?” I said, still gasping for air. As I scrambled to my feet. I noticed the two boxes on the floor with the contents spilled all over the walkway. I picked one up and saw it was a prescription bottle filled with white pills with green specks embedded inside them.

“Uh, Molly? What is this?” I said, handing her one of the bottles.

“This looks like amphetamine pills. What are they doing with these here?” She pondered to herself.

I looked to my right and saw the protective fencing and the wooden gating had been torn off. Just below the broken gate was cutting pliers and metal tins.

“Molly, what do amphetamines do again?” I asked, already knowing the answer.

“It calms you down, why?” She said matter of factly.

“What are some of the side effects of amphetamines Molly?” I questioned, trying to lead her into what I was thinking.

Her face turned pale as she now knew what I was getting at. “It makes them angrier.”

I sighed in frustration at the situation and threw the pills on the floor. I put my hands on my head and started to think about what we should do next.

“Should we leave?” Molly questioned.

“No, I don’t think we can.” I said with some exhaustion in my voice.

“Why not?”

“Because those bastards will pin this on us! We don’t have gloves on do we? If we let them do this to the animals, I can’t imagine what would happen tomorrow morning. Then, when the police come and investigate,  they’ll see our fingerprints and those nutjobs will pin this entire incident on us to cover their tracks!”

“So what do we do then, Jack?” Molly said, throwing her arms up in distress.

“We need to get some evidence that proves that we weren’t involved in any way. And stop these lunatics from hurting any of the other animals. If we catch them in time, we could possibly save the animals from being under the influence of whatever this medicine is.”

“That sounds all well and good Jack, but how are we going to do this?” Molly said, interested in what my so-called plan would be.

“While we were getting over here, I saw some security cameras. That must mean that someone is watching our every move. Now we need to find out where that is and find some footage that shows the activists entering and giving the animals the medicine. That way, we can’t be blamed for this and the activists would be screwed legally.”

“That sounds good, but what about the animals? How do we prevent them from being drugged?” Molly questioned.

“That…I do not know.” My answer did not please Molly one bit.

“You don’t know? Then, how are we supposed to do this?”

“Like I said, I don’t know. Do you have any ideas?” I said, hoping for some sort of answer.

“The only thing I could think of is that they’re asleep and we can take away the water they’re given.” Molly said with some hesitancy.

I thought about it and said “That might work.”

Molly looked back, “Hopefully.”

…

Underneath a large oak tree, we sat behind rounded square bushes and peeked over at the featureless building up ahead.

“This should be it.” I said, looking at the lack of detail of the building ahead of us.

“Are you sure this is it?”

“Hopefully. The building’s easy to miss.” I said, looking at my watch.

“2:00 AM. We need to hurry before the staff come in at 6.”

“Okay, the camera’s looking away. Go.” Molly and I quickly moved to the side of the building. Before we positioned ourselves, all of the lamp posts were shut off all at once.

“They found their way to the power supply. Is that a good thing?” Molly said.

“Yeah I think. More cover for us. And them.”

Molly did not like the last part.

“We’ve got our chance. Look out for anything and I’ll try and get the door open.”

I pointed my light to the keyhole and started to fidget around with the mechanism inside. It was relatively strong as expected and somewhat difficult to get the pins in the right place. Eventually, after many tries and gripes from Molly about being finished yet, the lock clicked open and the door slowly opened revealing its pitch black insides.

The room inside wasn’t particularly special, only containing shelves of boxes and crates. However, an open doorway was tucked behind a large, rectangular crate. After some help from Molly, the crate revealed what we were looking for. A series of monitors plastered the back wall of the room. Several monitors and servers were seemingly working perfectly. I went over to the main set of monitors and they all sprung to life. I clicked on one of the cameras that showed one of the exhibits and saw something that made my face go cold.

The exhibits were all empty.

I tried for the life of me to see if any of the animals were still in their cages, but none of them were. I saw lions and cheetahs roaming the food courts, gorillas and orangutans fighting in the shops, jackals and foxes rummaging through knocked over stands, and more animals outside of the exhibits. We were too late. It seemed that every single animal was affected. I looked around for any sign of the activists and I found nothing. Then I looked at the camera that was near the office and I saw the camera knocked over on the floor. Shortly before the camera disconnected, I saw the image of animalistic eyes looking directly into the camera.

“Molly lock the door NOW!” I frantically said, pointing at the open doorway. Molly, not understanding the situation, did so urgently and locked the security office door. Molly was about to ask what was going on until she saw the screen and immediately understood my reaction.

“Jack, what do we do?” Molly whispered, on the verge of tears.

I fell silent and I didn’t know what to say. What do we do? Reality set into me and I started to feel regret. “We should’ve never gone here. I should’ve never brought her here. We’re going to die here because of me.” Molly noticed how distressed I was and started to try in her best efforts to calm me down.

“We can’t get those animals back in their cages, Jack. That’s what we both know. What we can do is get out of here and call the police. All we need to do is leave. We just need to know how to do it.”

I nodded. “Yeah, we need to leave this place. We just need evidence first.” Molly agreed.

I looked back towards the computer and found a recording of the footage that had the activists in clear view. I downloaded the footage and saved it to a USB that was in one of the drawers.

I put the USB in my pocket and started to ponder. Ideas were floating around in my head and all of them were risky. I started to pace around the room and tried to grasp at something. Time was a luxury that we can’t afford to lose and I had to think of something that we could use.

“What’s the plan Jack?” Molly said quietly.

“We need to leave, but with those animals outside I’m not sure. The way we came in isn’t an option at all because of obvious reasons. Maybe something in this room?” I started to rummage around in the desks and found a Phillips head screwdriver tucked in between paperwork.

“Maybe this could work.” I thought. I looked around the room for something that I could potentially screw off and found a vent opening that was just small enough to look through to the other side of the wall. I scanned the room with the flashlight, and found nothing except the boxes and crates from earlier. The door that led to the destruction outside vibrated slightly in varying intervals. I didn’t want to think about what could be waiting for us beyond that door. I scanned the office further and found an opening in the corner of the room. The opening was blocked by large crates and wooden palettes. I looked towards the locked door of the security room and I reached for the knob. Molly must’ve seen my hand and asked, “Do you know what you’re doing?”

“I think. I just want to check something.”

“Are you sure? What are you trying to check?”

“I saw this little opening in the back of the room out there.” I gestured outside the door.

“Okay then, be careful. For our sake.” Molly said, opening the door and watching me creep outside towards the end of the room.

I carefully moved the crates to the side and it revealed a square opening that is big enough for someone to crawl through.

“Come look at this. I think this is our way out.”

Molly comes over and looks into the darkness of the vent. The vent was dusty and tiny cobwebs were sticking to the corners of the vent.

“Ew Jack. There’s cobwebs in there.” Molly said, disgusted.

“Do you see any other way out of here?” I said, gesturing to the unknown darkness of the industrial closet that we trapped ourselves in.

“Good point Jack.”

“Come on, let’s move.” I crawled on all fours into the vent and Molly hesitantly followed after me. I shined the flashlight forward which led to my elbows touching the dust covered vent floors. I covered my arms and hands with my sweater, and started to hold in the need to release the phlegm in my throat which was waiting to be let out in a string of coughing fits. The walls of the steel vents echoed the thumps of arms and legs. I held my breath for as long as I could, waiting for something to come around the corner. Soon enough, I found the vertical lining of a cover at the very end of a short vent passageway. As I approached the vent cover with a screwdriver ready in hand, I stopped dead in my tracks as I heard the chilling noises of flesh tearing from bone. From the vent, I can vaguely see legs of an animal shaking from the tension of tearing meat from a particularly stubborn subject. Blood trickled down in a large red pool and it leaked into the crevasse of the vent. It reached my arm and my spine shivered from the very fate that potentially waited for us outside of this metal grate.

However, my thoughts were pierced by a sharp feeling of being watched. I looked at the grate and saw eyes peering into the darkness that contained both me and Molly. Its slit pupil narrowed into a snarl. A black jaw gnawed loudly at the grate which started to shake violently. I gripped the screwdriver as my life literally depended on it. Soon, the opening would be clear and my opportunity to strike would arrive for only a few moments.

The vent was now torn off and its head started to narrow into the opening and it aimed for my arm in order to pull me into the carnage outside. As its head shot forward towards my arm, I thrusted my screwdriver into the general direction of the animal. Its screeches echoed into the darkness of the helpless night. It staggered back and fell to the floor in pain. I scrambled out of the vent and looked at the creature. The first thing that caught my attention was its face. The screwdriver was buried into the creature’s eye. Blood trickled down in droves and its face alone said how much pain it was in. However, its face also showed unwavering anger and rage at whoever had done this to them. That unfortunate soul would have to wait because it had to escape. It bolted away and a small trail of blood followed it. Molly looked at me with terror in her eyes.

“Are you okay?!” Molly said, with panic in her voice.

I looked at my hand and saw blood running down into my sleeve. Further down my arm was a slight puncture into the cloth of my jacket. I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw that it didn’t break the skin.

“Yeah, thank god.” I said, with a small sigh of relief

When I went to pick up the screwdriver, it was now covered in blood. The screwdriver shook in my hands and the feeling of doing such a thing to an animal gave me a sharp chill down my back.

“Jack, you’re shaking. Are you feeling alright?” She said from behind, laying her hand on my shoulder.

“I just hurt an animal. It didn’t have anything to do with those activists. Should I feel bad about this Molly?”

“No, I don’t think so. It attacked you, and you defended yourself. What else were you supposed to do?”

“I don’t know, Molly. It was drugged…it was angry. I feel like a monster.” I said, fighting back tears.

“Look Jack. It’s difficult to say what you're feeling right now, but now is not the time. We need to leave before one of those animals finds us.”

I look down at the puncture in my sleeve. “Yeah, we should.”

…

“Did you find anything?” Molly asked, leaning up against the wall.

“Not yet. A lot of the exits here are very risky.” I flipped through the cameras and scanned for any resemblance of some sort of exit with no luck.

I sighed, “I can’t find anything Molly. Do you have any ideas?”

“Well, there is the way we came in. But from the looks of it, we’d be lunch meat before we even get there.” Molly pondered.

I sat there in the chair for a minute and tried my hardest to think of something.

“We can try and wait till morning.” I said, trying to take a stab in the dark. I was interrupted by a sudden scratch at the door leading outside. That shot my idea down pretty quickly.

I sighed in frustration, planted my hands on the table, and looked  down at the keyboard. I was drawing a blank yet again, and I looked at the security cameras yet again. I was fully expecting to find nothing yet again, but something caught my eye. In the horrible, pixelated screen in front of me was a gap in the middle of one of the outside walls that seemingly led to the back alleys of the main entrance.

“Molly, come look at this!” I beckoned excitedly.

“What is it? What did you find?” She said with piqued interest.

“Look at that right there.” I pointed at the slightly noticeable gap in the wall.

“What is that?” Molly said, squinting her eyes to try and make out the low quality image on screen.

“I think that’s a gap. It might be a way out.” I zoomed into the gap and saw a part of a pathway that led behind the buildings.

“Nice catch Jack! How’d you notice that?”

“I guess looking at the screen for a while has done me some good.” I said while looking at the map plastered on the wall.

“From that map on the wall over there, I think that crack is around the back of the cotton candy stand near the entrance. It shouldn’t be far from here.” I said, feeling in my pockets to check if the USB is still there and thankfully it was.

After gathering up the courage for the both of us, we headed into the vent for the second time and we were a lot more perceptive of our surroundings this time. I peeked outside of the vent and saw that it was clear this time around. We crawled out of the dusty, cobwebbed vent and advanced towards the path that took us to the front of the building. I looked to the floor and saw a small trail of blood that led around the back of the cotton candy stand. A sinking feeling of dread and exhaustion started to brew in my stomach, but the thought of that path being our only way out made my ever growing desperation for escaping stronger than the trail of blood that preceding us.

We climbed onto the dumpster and squeezed our way through the crack. Before us was a long concrete corridor with several stands blocking the left side. As we walked down this long passageway, we saw something slumped against the concrete wall to the right. Upon closer inspection, we saw something that made our hearts drop. A man slumped against the wall, with intestines hanging out and a gunshot wound under his cheek with the exit wound going out the top. His brain was splattered against the wall behind him with the blood splattering high. I couldn’t take it at this point. I dry heaved and my eyes started to water. Molly looked away with audible disgust and started gagging. The worst part of all is the bold lettering on the man’s jacket: SECURITY.

I looked back at the security guard and saw something beside him; a pistol. Around 4 9mm ammo cases lay on the floor. One of those must’ve been for him. I slowly approached him and picked up the pistol.

“Jack, be careful with that.” Molly grudgingly said.

“We need this Molly. If these…fucking animals wouldn’t give mercy to him, what do you think they’ll do to us?” I roughly said.

“We need to leave. There’s no time to waste Molly.”

We left the security guard’s body slumped against the wall, and we never looked back at it. I felt bad for him. I had no idea who he was, but no one should die like that; eaten alive by those affected animals.

We finally made our way to the entrance of the court. However, something made us stop in our tracks. An absolute nightmare lay before us.

Dozens of lions, leopards, panthers, and cheetahs were laying on the floor sleeping. We just stood there with disbelief and absolute horror. How are we going to get to the exit now?!

“What now?” I whispered as softly as I could.

“I…don’t know.” Molly shivered.

“We need to step around them.”

“What?” Molly whispered with shock.

“Can you think of anything else?” I whispered, hoping for a better plan.

Unfortunately she did not.

I looked around the mess of giant cats on the floor and saw a sizable gap in the chaos of tattered fur. I stepped forward and I landed my foot precisely in the middle of the gap. The problem was that it could only fit one person. I looked around for another spot and nearly had a heart attack when one of the lionesses yawned. It was still asleep, thankfully. I found another spot and stepped further in this organic minefield (however, in this case, I’ll be mauled to death instead of being blown to pieces). As I carefully stepped into the gap, I gestured for Molly to follow. She shook her head in defiance. I couldn’t blame her, but it was the only way we could get across. I couldn’t just talk her into it now, so I just continued on. Eventually, she started to make her way into the first gap in the path that was predetermined by the sleeping felines.

As we stepped our way through the field of giant cats, I saw a metal structure that was meant to be operated by a cheery salesman that would sell the overpriced chicken legs. Now, it was shut tight by metal shutters and a rusted sign stood as the only evidence of any sort of establishment. I looked towards Molly and I pointed towards the structure’s roof. She understood the plan and I stepped up on the wooden counter of the structure. I held the roof and set my other foot on the sign that lay crooked on the wall. I pulled myself up to the roof and looked towards Molly at the bottom. She soon began to climb up the structure and her foot landed upon the crooked sign. Then, a loud screeching sound emanated from the sign as the metal started to bend and break under the pressure. It then ended painfully with a loud clatter as it fell to the floor. It all took only 10 seconds, but it felt like it was 10 minutes. I looked at the lions below and I saw the twinkle of their eyes begin to dimly shine. Slowly, more and more of them started to get up from the concrete floor. I felt like time just stopped at that very moment. It tortured me with the feeling of death waiting for us just a few feet below us. A death that would be more painful and horrific than anyone’s imaginations. As the situation became more clear, I pulled Molly up to the roof as a large claw came swinging towards Molly’s leg.

Molly yelped and she stumbled onto the floor of the structure’s roof. I turned around and saw a gash on Molly’s leg. It was bleeding quite a bit and she was starting to panic. I took off my jacket and wrapped it around her leg to try and stop the bleeding. Molly was sobbing, giant cats were clawing at the structure, and the exit was so close.

“Molly, remember when I said I’ll cover our butts if anything goes wrong?” She nodded with tears still in her eyes.

“I hate to say this Molly, but I’m going to draw them away. This is a stupid plan I know. But this is the only thing I could think of. Take the USB and the gun, and run.” I’ll buy you some time.”

“Jack…why does it have to be you?” She weakly said.

“I got you into this. It’s only right that you get out of here safely.” I said, slowly regretting my decisions up to this point.

Molly stared back at me. She didn’t say anything else.

I looked around for something to distract them with and saw the exhibits splitting off into different sections. I then thought about what happened earlier. One of the exhibits was opened by one of the activists and it should be enough to get inside. And with the animals out of their cages, it should be empty.

“I’m going to lead them to the exhibits. I’ll find a place to hide and see if I can wait them out. I’ll be fine Molly. Now get ready to run!” I positioned myself near the edge of the structure and looked towards the invisible pathway ahead of me. Thousands of possibilities ran through my head, many horrific scenes of disembowelment and a lot of blood. I washed those thoughts away. Now wasn’t the time to get distracted.

And just like that, I jumped and ran into the darkness ahead.

…

My feet were pounding against the cracked concrete. A tight corridor of messy bushes was constantly shifting and rustling. The animals were chasing behind and beside me. I was hoping that the branches below me wouldn’t decide to get in my way now. Running through the dark has always been something that I was used to, but not to this extent. I finally reached the first exhibit and the two bodies still lay there with their entrails spilled all over the floor.

I looked to the right and saw the hole in the dark exhibit. I squeezed my way through the hole and looked around for something to cover it. I found a long piece of log sitting on the side and I pushed hard so that the heavy log could block the hole in the wall. Just as I did that, I heard the repeated slams against the metal gate. I shined the flashlight and saw multiple rabid eyes looking directly at me. It felt weird being in a cage like this and a bit ironic too.

“Now who’s looking at who?” I said to myself, with a bit of a smirk.

The clouded sky was now slowly being covered in a bright pink. The giant ball of fire we call the sun was slowly rising above the horizon. The shadows of the animals stretch from outside and my shadow stretches towards the end of the cage. In the shadows that have not been graced by the sun’s warm embrace, one singular eye opens in the corner of the cage. I looked towards it and a cold chill ran down my spine. A black cougar slowly moved out of the shadows with one eye still open. The other had blood dripping down from it. I knew that the thing that attacked me and dragged me from the vents, the one that tried to bite and maul me, the one I had stabbed with a screwdriver was now in a cage with the one that stabbed them; Me!

It prowled through the grass like I was their prey and its one eye narrowed onto me. I tried to feel for the screwdriver, but I felt nothing. It must’ve fell out of my pocket while I was running into the exhibits. I looked towards the floor and saw a branch on the floor. It looked sturdy. I picked it up and held it like a baseball bat. It shook in my hands and I felt like a poor prisoner waiting to be executed. Before I could compose myself, it dashed towards me with foam hanging out of its jaws. I aimlessly swung towards the foliage and I felt resistance vibrate from the branch and into my arms. A heavy thunk echoed through my ears and a growl rumbled from the grass. I backed away towards a mess of branches standing on each other and readied my branch like a batter at a baseball game. However, the fear of missing still filled my mind thoroughly.

I felt its singular eye watching me from every vantage point; to the left of me, to the right, and behind me. I looked behind me and was confronted by nothing but a tangle of grass and giant roots. However, the rapid crushing of foliage drew my attention towards the left and I was tackled to the floor with a black, furious head biting down on my branch. Blood ran down my arms and I didn’t know whether it was mine or not. Drool sprayed around me as it struggled to get past my wooden barricade that I had in my hands. I felt this trembling in the palms of my hands and my heart started to beat at a rate I can only describe as a trembling snare drum. My vision became blurry and the gnashing teeth came closer and closer to my neck.

A high pitched clicking sound broke my thoughts with the giant feline falling to the floor twitching. Two metal prongs poked out of the black, matted furry mass that lay upon the floor. A capable set of hands pulled me from the floor and led me out of the cage. The animals outside were long gone and the front entrance was desolate. As I was taken out of the zoo, I looked at my arms and saw several deep gashes along my arms.

…

I was taken to the hospital and had to get several stitches on my arms. The doctors saw that I had some infection in the wounds and I’ll have to treat it with antibiotics. When I got to the waiting room, Molly was waiting there with a white bandage over her leg similar to mine. She was glad I made it out somewhat okay. It was a miracle that we made it out with no life threatening injuries.

After we left, she told me what happened after I ran for the exhibits. She said that once most of the animals cleared a path, she ran as fast as she could towards the entrance and contacted the police through the booth. When they arrived and found me, she gave them the USB that showed who exactly was the culprit. When they checked the footage, it showed the activists drugging the animals through tampered water.

Later, we had to appear in court in another city. We had to tell our side of the story and leave out the sneaking in part. We just told them about how we found drugs around the back of the bathrooms and how we reported it to security. When they showed the security footage in court, the leader didn’t object to anything. He seemed to think that this was justified in some sort of sick way.

We weren’t there long enough to hear about his sentence, but I hope he gets at least life. This was several years ago and I’ve already graduated from high school and college. I finally pulled my life together and tried to stay safe. Molly and I still stay in touch and we meet every so often. I guess I can say I lived happily ever after, and it would sound a bit cliche. However, I guess it was the case this time around. And I think a happy ending is something that everyone wants. Anyway, I got to get back on my shift. The lions need tending to.
