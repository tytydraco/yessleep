I don’t post things often, but I discovered something quite unusual and frankly quite terrifying the other day. I’m not sure how else to put it but I haven’t been able to think about anything else. I was hoping someone could help me make heads or tails of it.

A little background first. I’m an assistant curator at a pretty famous museum. I won’t say which, as I would like to maintain my anonymity. All you need to know is that we have an unbelievably large archive of artifacts, art, and research. Takes a lot of manpower to organize, manage, and digitize them. Anyways, I was going through boxes of records from field teams the other day when I came across a satellite communication device. It’s just an audio recording device that lets field teams, who probably don’t have internet where they work, to record logs on what they find. This isn’t anything out of the ordinary for me. I do, however, absolutely hate coming across them as it was my job to transcribe the hours of recordings on these devices. I love my work, but every job has its tedious duties. Thankfully when I opened the files, there were only 22 logs. I should mention that the device that I have is not the original recorder the team had with them, but is only a receiver. We don’t receive the recordings in real time as it takes an exhaustingly long time for any data to be transferred between these devices over great distances. It is, however, a reliable way to keep records. Usually the team would arrive home before their recordings do. This is only done as a precaution if the original device is lost.

The other files, along with the satellite device, included information on the research team and other files pertaining to their mission. I won’t be specific, but the team was sent to the outskirts of Jordan to investigate a previously undiscovered Mesopotamian ruin. 

Anyways, I’m just going to put the finished transcriptions here for you guys. I’ll be adding additional notes of what I think I hear in the background. The names of those involved have been changed. I hope you understand. Date and time listed are in (mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss) format. The following logs were received in September of 2020.  



Log 1 (05/11/2019 09:13:42)

Milo: Hey, what’s up guys? Just casually making history out here. Or uncovering it I suppose.

Carter: Milo, put that down, it's not a toy.

Milo: Just having a bit of fun. Alright, gotta go. Don’t forget to hit that like and subscribe.

Carter: MILO!

**It sounds like it’s raining heavily in the background.**

Bob: How does this thing work?

Milo: Just hit that button on the top.

Bob: There’s like four buttons on the top.

John: Is the red light on?

Bob: Yep.

John: Then it’s working.

Bob: Oh. Okay, the progress here is slow. Well, we haven’t even begun to investigate the site yet. A massive freak storm hit us the moment we got here, and we’ve just been waiting it out. That’s it, right?

Carter: Yeah, that’s all for now. Looks like we’re gonna be waiting a while.

Milo: OH SHIT!

**Milo’s comment is immediately followed by the sound of thunder.**

Log 3 (05/12/2019 12:16:05)

Milo: Let me tell them.

Carter: No. I’m the team leader here, so I get to tell them.

Milo: You won’t say it with gravitas.

Bob: Come on, let’s go. We’ve got things to prep.

Milo: THIS IS MOMENTOUS CARTER!

**Bob and Milo’s voices and footsteps die down.**

Carter: Alright. You would not believe our luck. So, the storm has passed but a lightning bolt last night struck the site. There’s a massive crater, yes, but don’t worry, it gets good. It opened up an untouched tunnel system under the site. We found it earlier today and by the looks of it, we think it’s manmade. Can’t be sure yet. We’re going in to investigate tomorrow. We won’t go in too far. However old it is, I doubt its architectural integrity. Don’t have much to report right now. Hopefully, I’ll have more tomorrow. Don’t want to get my hopes up but we might be standing on something huge. Maybe Milo was right about me lacking gravitas.

Log 4 (05/13/2019 08:34:18)

**Milo and Bob can be heard yelling in the background at the start of the recording, although I can’t make out what they’re saying. Everyone’s voices in this log are noticeably echoing.**

Carter: It’s exactly what we had hoped and maybe more. We’re at the tunnel system right now and there are carvings and symbols all over the walls. I don’t recognize what culture they belonged to, but it definitely isn’t Mesopotamian. The architecture  doesn’t match any of the ruins above.

John: It doesn't look like any ancient language we have records of. This might actually be something new.

Carter: You hear that? We might have found a new ancient civilization. This changes the entire timeline of human history. This could be fucking Atlantis for all we know. 

Bob: Carter! John!

**Footsteps gradually grow louder in the background.** 

Bob: We found a door.

John: Holy fu—

Log 5 (05/13/2019 08:39:56)

Milo: Can’t we just grab a few sticks of dynamite? We did pack some after all.

Bob: No, you idiot. You want to destroy priceless artifacts and bring this entire tunnel down on us?

Milo: One stick of dynamite.

Carter: Guys, shut up. Okay, we’re at the end of the tunnel system. It’s about three hundred meters from the opening we came in from. I know I said we won’t go in that far, but this is really exciting. Anyways we found a … door?

John: More like a wall, honestly. Looks angry too.

Carter: It’s a massive flat circular rock that’s blocking the tunnel. There’s a face carved on it. Milo got some photos, so I won’t bother trying to describe it. John’s right though. It does look quite ferocious.

Bob: And ugly. 

Carter: We’re documenting everything here, don’t worry.  

End of Log 5

 

I didn’t find any of the photos they described among the files.

 

Log 6 (05/13/2019 16:21:22)

Carter: Quite the day we had. God, I still can’t believe how lucky we got. This is incredible. We’ll go investigate further tomorrow but we’re gonna have to wait for a larger team to arrive. We don’t have the manpower or the equipment to handle something of this magnitude. Some of us want to force our way through and as exciting as that sounds, every brick and stone in that tunnel are considered artifacts and evidence of this civilization. Can’t have them damaged. Maybe if we pry it open somehow. Just thinking out loud.

**There’s yelling in the background.**

Carter: What are they doing now?

End of Log 6

 

Log 7 (05/13/2019 16:24:10) 

John: Give me that.

Carter: Hang on. Just, run me through what happened again.

John: Milo and I were bringing back the equipment we left near the tunnel.

Carter: Right.

John: And a man came stumbling out of the tunnel system, yelling at us.

Carter: What do you mean he came out of the tunnel?

John: I mean I— well Milo saw him first, but we watched him crawl out of the tunnel.

Carter: There’s nothing in the tunnel. It’s a straight shot to the dead end.

John: Yeah, I know that. I’m just telling you what I saw.

Carter: Did he come from the direction of where the tunnel is or did he actually–

John: Carter, I’m fucking telling you he came out of the tunnel. I don’t know, maybe there's another opening we missed. 

Carter: You said he was yelling?

John: Yeah. Well, I don’t know. I turned my hearing aids off cause Milo was being annoying. Milo heard it, though.

Carter: Milo? Milo!

Milo: Huh? Yeah?

Carter: What was the man saying?

Milo: I don’t— I don’t know. I didn’t understand it.

Carter: And where is this man now?

John: I don’t know. He’s just gone.

Carter: Into thin air?

John: Well, there’s not a whole lot of places to hide out here so yeah, maybe. Didn’t get a good look at him. Milo, tell him.

Carter: Milo? Where’s Milo? 

End of Log 7

  

Log 8 (05/13/2019 22:07:11)

Carter: Alright, we’re all back at camp. Milo’s not feeling that well right now. Hopefully he gets better in the morning. I still want to go back to that tunnel tomorrow. Maybe see if that door would budge.

Bob: What happened out there? Milo is really shaken up.

Carter: I don’t know. They said they saw a man coming out of the tunnel.

Bob: What?

Carter: You think this is another one of Milo’s antics?

Bob: I’m not sure about that. Have you seen the state he’s in? Besides, didn’t John say he saw the man too? 

Carter: Yeah.

Bob: What do we do?

Carter: There’s nothing to do except our job. How do you delete recordings on this anyway?

Bob: You’re asking the wrong person.

 End of Log 8

 

Log 9 (05/14/2019 09:33:48)

Carter: I don’t know how but the door is opened. I was bringing our equipment for today’s excursion, and there it was. The circular stone face had been rolled aside. Still can’t really believe it. I’m going to go get the others to take a look inside. Gonna need to bring some headlights. This is big. I can feel it.

End of Log 9

  

Log 10 (05/14/2019 10:56:27)

**Once again, everyone’s voice is echoing.**

Bob: This whole thing must be massive.

John: Be careful. Nobody touch a thing.

Carter: John’s right. We’re just here to observe for now. Milo, hand me the lamp.

Milo: I’ve got a bad feeling about this place. 

John: Yeah. Especially what we saw yesterday.

Carter: Enough of that.

Bob: Carter, bring the light here.

Carter: Yep.

Bob: How far down does that go?

Carter: Can’t even see the bottom. I suppose these carvings would tell us something. Bob, didn't you take a course on philology?

Bob: They can’t teach me a language that was previously undiscovered, can they?

Carter: Fair enough. Wish we could read some of these. Still have no idea what this structure is. We need to get as many photos as possible of their language if we’re ever gonna hope to reconstruct it. Milo, come take a picture of this one.

Bob: This one’s bigger. Kinda like a banner. Must be important.

Carter: Could be the name of this place?

**Milo’s voice can be heard mumbling something, but I can’t make out what he said.**

Bob: What was that?

Log 11 (05/14/2019 11:34:19)

Carter: We’re gonna go deeper into the underground structure. There’s a set of staircases leading downwards. No idea how big this structure is. Heading back to camp right now to grab some more torches. Bit concerned about breathing in the air down there. Might bring some face masks along. It’ll probably be fine. 

Carter: Oh shi—

**There’s a muffled sound here and a soft thud. I’m thinking Carter might have dropped the recorder.**

Carter: What in the world?

**More muffling and loud smacking. Probably Carter wiping sand off the microphone.**

Cater: Holy crap, no way.

 End of Log 11

 

Log 12 (05/14/2019 11:58:20)

Carter: Back at camp right now. Tripped over this robe on my way back just outside the tunnel. It was covered in a bit of sand. Smells terrible though. No idea how I missed it the first few days. Anyways, I may be reaching here but it looks old and maybe it belonged to the people of this ancient civilization. Might also just be something the locals left behind. Yeah, it probably is.

John: Where did you find that?

Carter: What? Oh, I found it on my way back.

John: That’s what he was wearing. The man I told you about.

Carter: This again? I don’t know how Milo talked you into this.

John: He didn’t. I can understand not believing him but when have I ever lied to you.

Carter: You expect me to believe that some guy out here in the middle of the desert crawled out of the tunnel, that has no other openings besides the crater that was made two days ago. 

John: Carter—

Carter: Not only that but he just disappears. Into thin air according to you.

John: I didn’t say that.

Carter: This is the last time I want to hear about this man alright.

John: I saw what I saw.

**Everyone’s voices are echoing and muffled.**

Bob: It is really dark down here. Smells god awful too.

Carter: Yeah. Good thing I brought the face masks, right?

Bob: I don’t think it’s helping.

John: We should bring some of the flood lights in here next.

Carter: I think those would blind us.

John: I can turn down the intensity. I mean we had no idea we would be working underground. We’re not exactly prepared for it.

Carter: Alright we’ll get the floodlights later.

Bob: Why do you always have that thing on?

Carter: I just have it on when we’re about to find something new. So, I can give live commentary of what we’re seeing.

John: Well so far, it’s just more carvings along the wall down this way. Man these people had terrible handwriting.

Carter: Looks like we’re coming up to the bottom.

John: God, the smell is definitely getting stronger.

Bob: Whatever it is it's probably in there.

Carter: We’ve reached the bottom of the staircase. There’s a short stretch of hallway leading to an open doorway. Let’s go check it out. Milo, get the camera ready.

Bob: Where’s Milo?

Carter: MILO! 

**A deafening explosion goes off, followed by the sound of stones collapsing.**

John: Don’t tell me that's what I think it is.

Carter: Shit.

Log 14 (05/14/2019 15:20:32)

**Bob and John are heard yelling in the background. I can only make out a few words and most of them are profanities. I think I can hear Milo crying.**

**Carter starts coughing.**

Carter: Fuck. Umm. Milo just…blew up our only exit. We’re completely caved in. We’ll try to dig our way out but if we can’t we’re gonna have to find another exit. There’s got to be another way out. I…fuck. GOD FUCKING DAMMIT!

**There's a loud pounding echo as Carter punches a wall. Then there’s stomping footsteps. John, Bob, and Milo’s voices grow louder.**

Milo: I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry.

Bob: Carter wait, let’s—

Carter: WHY? WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU THINKING? 

**The audio here is muffled. The microphone must have been shaking a lot. I can make out the sound of violent punching and Milo’s screams.**

John: CARTER STOP! THAT'S ENOUGH!

**More muffled noises and the rustling sound of clothes. The screaming and hitting sound stops.**

Carter: Relief team arrives in three days. We’ll run out of oxygen long before then. If we don’t find a way out of here you’ve effectively killed us.

Milo: Please stop. I’m so sorry. Please. I’m so sorry.

Log 16 (05/14/2019 15:35:16)

**Someone is sobbing in the background. I can’t discern who. There is also the sound of rock clattering on a hard surface.**

Carter: We’re in the main room right now with the collapsed tunnel. John’s trying to dig our way out right now, but it’s not looking like a viable plan. That explosion earlier destroyed most of what was in this room. This whole structure might collapse on us even. I think. Sorry I can’t think straight right now. We think this place is a mass grave. The other room down the stairs… it was filled with long decayed bodies. With how things are looking, well, we might be adding to the pile.

John: Hey, what's your problem?

Carter: What? Hey! Knock it off!

**There's some shuffling sound.**

Milo: No, you can’t. We can’t leave. We can’t leave.

Carter: What the fuck has gotten into you Milo. If you want to die down here, be my guest. But I’m not letting you take the rest of us down with you.

Milo: No. No. Stop. Make him stop. MAKE HIM STOP!

**Milo’s begging is cut short by a grunt from Carter, followed by the sound of something heavy hitting the floor.**

Carter: Stay out of our way.

John: Bob, pull yourself together. We’re not dying here.

**The sobbing gradually dies down to a whimper.**

Milo: I won’t. I won’t let you. You can’t make me.

**There’s a rhythmic dull thudding sound followed by grunts of pain after each thud.**

Milo: You – Can’t – Make – Me.

**Milo strains his words. Each word is followed by a thud.**

John: What the fuck. Carter, stop him.

Carter: What do you want me to do? He’s clearly lost it.

John: For god’s sake, Milo, stop. Milo! You’re bleeding! Stop! 

Carter: Damn it. Milo get–

**There’s a shuffling sound followed by fast footsteps echoing.**

John: Where are you going?

Carter: Milo get back here!

**The footsteps quickly get farther away, although their echoes can still be heard.**

John: We’re not gonna go after him?

Carter: I’m not going down there again. Plus, it’s a dead end. Not like he can get too far from us. He can rot with the others down there for all I care.

**The sobbing resumes to its initial volume.**

Log 17 (05/14/2019 23:14:52)

Carter: We’ve been down here for… umm… almost eight hours now. It’s getting unbearably hot. The smell isn’t helping either. It’s gotten a lot stronger, even up here. Probably because the only ventilation we had collapsed. We’re taking a break from digging our way out. Progress is… slow.

John: I’m going down there. 

Carter: Just leave him.

John: I’m gonna go see if there’s another way out.

Carter: Alright. Yell if you find something.

John: Yeah.

Carter: And… check on him.

John: Yeah.

**Soft footsteps gradually dissipated until there was only silence. The silence went on for seven whole minutes. I assume Carter had forgotten to switch the device off.**

Carter: Bob? Bob, are you alright?

Bob: We’re gonna die down here.

**Another four minutes of silence follows.** 

John: MILO, NO! CARTER GET DOWN HERE! NOW!

**John’s voice is echoing and hard to hear but he is clearly yelling.**

Carter: SHIT! Bob, come on.

**A single set of loud footsteps on stone floors and the shuffling of fabric is heard.**

Carter: Dammit Bob.

**John and Milo’s yelling gradually gets louder.**

John: Milo put the knife down.

Carter: What the fuck is going on?

John: Like you said, he lost it.

Carter: Milo, where did you get that?

Milo: He demands. He keeps demanding.

Carter: You better start making some sense.

**Milo starts crying loudly. He talks, choking through the sobs.**

Milo: He’s in my head, Carter. He won’t leave me alone.

Carter: Who?

Milo: No. No. NO! I can’t. That’s what he wants. We can’t let him leave. He’s angry. He’s so angry. They trapped him down here. He’s so scared of rotting down here like the rest of us.

Carter: What has been going on with you? Who are you talking about?

Milo: John. The man from the tunnels. He told me. He told me his name. Ever since then he’s been in my head.

John: The man from the tunnels is in your head?

Milo: No. Not him. Not a man. It. It is in my head. It was in his head and now it’s in mine. He wasn’t strong enough. Oh, but how it made him suffer. To have to die for so long. 

**Milo’s sobbing intensifies.** 

Carter: Get a hold of yourself. Be specific. Tell me what did this to you.

Milo: I CAN’T! I CAN’T! Please. That’s what it wants. It’ll make you suffer for it. I’m so sorry. I couldn’t let it. We can’t let it. 

Carter: MILO!

**The sound of ripping flesh followed Milo’s blood curdling scream. There is a loud gelatinous splat then thick dripping sounds of liquid gushing onto the floor.**

John: MILO, STOP!

Milo: I– It dies with me. I’ll kill it.

Carter: BOB! BRING THE FIRST AID KIT! BOB!

**A faint whimpering can be heard in the background.** 

Carter: We… Milo found a ritualistic dagger amongst the bodies. He’s hurt, really bad.

John: Give it a rest will you.

Carter: I’m just doing my job.

John: Your job? YOUR JOB? YOU FUCKING—

Bob: GUYS STOP!

Log 19 (05/15/2019 02:03:40)

Carter: I think I’m starting to get used to the smell down here. I don’t think it’s actually a mass grave. The bodies aren’t piled together or organized at all. I think it’s a temple or church of some kind. There’s an altar right there at the center of the room. There’s art on the wall. And the statues. Looks like it’s the God they were worshiping. Same face as the one on the door we found yesterday. I took photos but the visibility isn’t great down here so maybe we could… What am I doing? No one’s gonna find—

**Carter starts quietly crying. He resumes talking after a few minutes.**

Carter: So… umm…we only really have access to the two rooms. The main room upstairs and … down here. Everyone else is upstairs. Milo is… he’s hanging in there. I… I don’t even know how he’s still alive. Christ, there’s still pieces of him on the floor. I don’t know what to do. I— 

**Carter trails off and there's a minute of silence.**

Carter: I think I hear air. There’s an opening somewhere here.

**The audio goes silent. The recorder doesn’t pick up any sound for a few seconds. Then an almost negligible audio is picked up. It sounded like breathing.**

Carter: What the—

**Carter starts screaming. The sound of his heavy footsteps pounding on stone steps echoes.**

Carter: No. No. No. Fuck no. 

John: Carter?

**John’s voice is cut off by the loud sound of stones scraping and clattering onto the floor.** 

Carter: HELP ME! WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE! NOW! 

**Suddenly, the rapid, heavy thud of footsteps closes in, growing louder until, with a deep, resonant thud, the sound of a body colliding with another fills the air. There's a sharp, forced exhale followed by a muffled thump accompanied by scattering pebbles.**

Carter: John? WHAT ARE YOU–

John: I’m sorry. Milo is right.

Carter: What?

John: He told me its name.

Carter: Put that away. What do you think you're doing?

**The harsh sound of labored breathing and strained grunts from both Carter and John. There's the occasional sharp scrape of a metallic object against stone.**

John: I’m doing you a kindness.

Carter: BOB! GET HIM OFF ME!

John: I’m so sorry. 

Carter: BOB! PLEASE!

John: Bob you know better. We can’t. 

**The struggle is suddenly interrupted by a swift, solid crack as a rock strikes the assailant. There's a sharp, surprised grunt as a dull thud of a body hitting the ground followed by the clattering of metal.**

Carter: Took you long enough. What the fuck happened? I was only gone for a few hours. 

**The clattering of rocks being thrown continues again.**

Bob: Come on. Let's get out of here.

Carter: Bob. The bodies down there.

Bob: I know. Isn’t it wonderful? Actual miracles sealed down here. This really is the discovery of the century. How lucky I am to not only witness it but share it with the world. 

Carter: Not you too. This place is cursed. There are monsters down there. 

Bob: Not monsters. Devout worshippers. Don’t be afraid Carter. He bears gifts for us. Isn’t that right, John?

**There's a low groaning sound in response.**

**A steady beat of stone clattering onto the floor continues from the previous recording, although slower. It is accompanied by the sound of labored panting.** 

Carter: It’s been almost twenty four hours since we’ve been down here. Supplies are getting low but we’ll make it to when the relief team arrives. Milo and John are in critical need of medical attention. There's only so much I can do for them with what I have on hand. The corpses in the lower levels aren’t —. 

**Carter pauses for a few seconds before continuing.**

Carter: We seem to be experiencing some kind of mass hysteria. No one seems to be in the right state of mind down here in the dark. We had to restrain John for the time being. For his and our safety.

John: Bob. Please don’t do this. It’s lying to you.

Bob: Was he lying when he cured you?

Carter: Where are your hearing aids, John?

Bob: He has no need for those anymore.

**A moment of silence hangs in the air before the sound of rocks scattering resumes.**

John: Carter. Can you pour me some water?

**The audio picks up the light sound of footsteps and a bag unzipping.** 

Carter: Here. Careful.

**John speaks in a whisper.**

John: Carter, listen to me. You have to stop him.

Carter: We’ll get out of here soon. It’ll be alright.

John: No, it won’t be alright. Not if we let it leave. I know I sound crazy to you right now but I can’t explain it to you. Not without putting you in the same position as us. Just promise me you won’t let us leave. You alone can survive. But bury us.

Carter: Hang in there. Just two more days.

John: Damn it. Carter. Don’t make me have to tell you.

Carter: Tell me what? Why you tried to kill me?

John: What I’m about to do to you is infinitely worse. Turn that damned recorder off.

Carter: I don’t want to be down here with them.

John: Yeah well I don’t want Bob hearing us. 

Carter: He won’t care. The only thing on his mind for the past twelve hours is digging a way out.

John: You think he can?

Carter: Unlikely.

John: You destroyed that recorder like I asked right?

**A moment lingers before Carter replies.**

Carter: Yeah. 

John: Right, so our only way to get out of here is the relief team. And if you’re right, they’ll be here in a few hours.

Carter: They’ll be here.

John: You know we can’t let them find us right?

**There’s a few seconds of silence. Carter doesn’t reply.**

John: You know what it’ll do if it gets out. 

Carter: So we just resign ourselves to a noble death? For the greater good?

John: We’d be lucky if it lets us die at all.

**John’s words hang in the air. The silence is broken with a quiet sob.**

Carter: Fuck you.

John: You wouldn’t have believed me if I didn’t tell you. 

Carter: So what then. We rot down here with the rest of them for eternity. 

John: They made the same sacrifice. For us. 

Carter: Don't you want to see her again?

John: I'm doing this for her.

Carter: I can’t.

John: It’s been in your head long enough. You can read the walls right? Warnings of an idea to be left forgotten.

**John begins to cry out in pain. There is a thumping sound as something hits the floor.**

Carter: Shit. John, are you alright? 

John: Stop it. You make sure I remember you and I’ll make sure no one will ever hear your name again. YOU PATHETIC PARASITE!

Carter: He’s calmed down. 

Bob: Merciful.

Carter: You haven’t taken a break since last night.

Bob: Has it been that long? Then the relief team should be arriving soon.

Carter: Yeah, about that.

Bob: He asked you to stop me didn’t he? To ensure that we’re not rescued. I bet that fool spoke of a noble sacrifice for the greater good. If he wants to be a martyr then let him alone suffer.

Carter: It will–

Bob: He is not an it. He is a God. He is the Prometheus. He nurtured the flame within man. Gifted us with knowledge and wisdom to stand at the pinnacle of beings. And this was how they repaid him once they deemed him unnecessary. Hubris.

Carter: HE will unleash vengence upon everyone if he gets out.

Bob: Perhaps. I’m sure his anger seems boundless now, but there will come an end to his wrath. When the dust settles we will be standing at his side. His Adams in his new Eden. Afterall, we’ll be the messengers of his name.

Carter: I’m sorry, Bob.

Bob: Do you really wish to share the fates of those men down there? The unfathomable pain of existing as nothing more than a pile of decaying dust, forcibly held together by his will. TO BE BURIED IN THE DARK FOR THE REST OF—

**A wet slashing sound interrupts Bob. A muffled gurgling noise of viscous liquid pouring is heard. A loud thud follows as something heavy falls to the floor.**

Carter: I’m so sorry.

**John can be heard hysterically laughing in the background.**

John: A voiceless prophet.

**A gurgling cry of anguish echoes through the chamber, before quickly being stifled.** 

Carter: I’m sorry. I can’t let you share this curse.

**Note that the relief team they spoke of were scheduled to arrive on the site at 06:30.** 

Carter: I think they’re here.

**As if in response, a muffled sound of clothes starts ruffling and scraping across the floor.**

Carter: Shit. Hold him down. John, help me. JOHN!

John: What? Oh, shit. Stop him.

**More muffled struggling ensues until it slowly subsides.**

Carter: What’s the matter with you? John? 

John: I can’t hear very well right now. It took it back

**There is a distorted sound of voices yelling in the distance. It’s impossible to make out what the words were, but it definitely wasn’t coming from the four men on the original team.**

John: Stay strong Carter. Sacrifice.

Carter: Sacrifice.

End of Log 22



Upon the completion of this transcript I had to know more of what happened to that team. I’ve already gone through all the files that came with the device. Other than the series of logs, none of the information I found there pertained to anything that happened during the team’s time on the site. I’m sure like many of you would be, I was compelled to find out more. The first place I looked was in the files of the secondary team that was to arrive on site on the 17th of May, 2019. Similar to the first set of files, there wasn’t a lot to go through. The files did include another satellite communication device. This device was the original. There were only two logs in the device. The names in the following transcript have also been altered. 



Log 1 (05/17/2019 12:47:22)

Riley: This is Dr. Riley of the secondary team. We arrived on site five hours ago at O-seven hundred. The preliminary team is nowhere to be found. We already notified the PSD and the university. We’ve been looking for them all day but there doesn’t seem to be a single trace of them. They must still be here. There’s no other way off the site unless they’re willing to trek over 400 km of barren desert. The rest of the team is scouring every last square meter of the site. We’ll find them. I really hope John is okay. 

End of Log 1  


Log 2 (05/17/2019 22:06:11)

Riley: No. Explain to me why. We’re authorized to be here for the duration of the project. As far as anyone is concerned that is still happening.

**The man responding to Riley speaks in a thick Arabic accent.**

???: This is no longer a research project. Your jurisdiction here is hereby revoked. We have arranged for you and your team to leave the country tomorrow morning on the earliest available flight. Please gather your team. You are to be transported off site now. 

Riley: I’m not leaving without them.

???: I’m afraid that is not up to you. It is no longer safe here. Men have gone missing. We are currently organizing efforts to search for them.

Riley: Will you at least let us know if you find them.

???: Rest easy knowing that these men have contributed greatly. Have a safe trip doctor.

End of Log 2



The research project was officially postponed indefinitely on the 18th of May 2019. There is no further information on the search effort for the four missing men. Even combing through social media I found nothing. It was as if the missing researchers ceased to exist. The last known record of them are contained within the logs. I stated that there were only 22 logs at the beginning. There is however one last log. It isn’t transcribed as no words are spoken during the recording. In fact the majority of log 23 is 27 hours of complete silence. Occasionally I think I can hear air circulating. Like soft labored breathing. 3 hours into the log there is a spike in audio as a gasp is heard followed by the sound of stones shifting. This final log was received last week. The time stamp reads 09/18/2023 11:07:36.

I think they’re still down there in the dark.

With the rest.
