Need to write this down. Feels stupid, like proof I’m losing it, but I have to get it out somewhere that isn't just the panic loop inside my own head. Maybe someone else... knows this feeling? This specific, creeping wrongness. It’s getting worse.



Moved into Apt 4B fast, three weeks ago. Bad breakup, messy, humiliating. Had to run, didn’t look close. Cheap rent, pre-war building, edge of nowhere interesting. You know the type. Thin walls – hear muffled neighbors fights like trapped ghosts. Bedroom radiator clangs: clang-clang-clang, pause, clang-clang. Always. Like Morse code for ha ha ha. Floor slopes west just enough my cheap office chair drifts to the wall unless I wedge my heavy Gardner's Art book under a wheel. Place smells… old. Dust from FDR maybe, lead paint probably explaining past tenants. And underneath that… faint, sharp, metallic tang. Like ozone or old pennies. Or old blood you tried to scrub out. Strongest near the ancient fuse box in the hall closet. Told myself it’s just old building crap. Can't complain, sound nuts.



Job? Remote data entry. Stare at spreadsheets till numbers blur. Cheap instant coffee tastes like acidic dirt. Landlord did the five-minute speed-walkthrough. Talked ‘original charm’ (cracked tiles, dripping faucet). Pointedly ignored the brown water stain blooming across the bedroom ceiling like a diseased lung. Didn’t care then. Just needed anywhere else.



Place has too many reflective surfaces. Didn't register it properly at first, numb from everything. Bathroom medicine cabinet mirror, huge, half the wall, bottom corners perpetually fogged like trapped breath. Living room window faces a close brick wall, reflects the room back greasy and dim, especially revealing at night. And the bedroom… dominated by massive, floor-to-ceiling mirrored closet doors. Tarnished fake-gold trim, pure 80s tackiness. Supposed to make the room feel bigger. Just makes it feel vast and judgy. Makes you feel watched. Never alone. Always seeing yourself.



First week, unpacking hell. Cardboard ghosts. Exhausted. Upstairs neighbor seemed to combine competitive furniture bowling with grief-stricken sobbing around 3 AM nightly. Didn't care.



Second week. Things felt… off. Not jump scares. Smaller. Weirder. Insidious, like finding mold just out of sight. Sitting on the floor, sorting books. That heavy Gardner's textbook, spine wrecked from college. Set it on the ‘keep’ pile left of me. Felt the thud. Glanced up. Living room window reflection, dim afternoon light, dirty glass acting as a murky mirror. In the reflection… clear as day… the book was still inside the cardboard box I'd just pulled it from. Cold. Stomach went ice cold. Looked down – book physically on the pile. Looked back at the reflection – correct now, showing the book exactly where it was, mocking me. Tired eyes? Old warped glass? Grabbed the excuses like lifelines. Needed them.



Bathroom mirror. Hung my blue towel – one frayed edge I never snip – on the hook beside the sink. Went to brush my teeth later, head down, avoiding my own gaze. Looked up quickly. My reflection looked back, but for a split second, the eyes… were they green? Mine are dark brown. Snapped back to normal instantly. Blinked hard. Imagined it? Then I saw the hook in the reflection: empty. Utterly empty. Breath hitched, loud in the small room. Reached out – physical towel right there beside me, damp terrycloth under trembling fingers. Looked back at the mirror. The reflection seemed to… shimmer? Like heat haze off asphalt? Then the blue towel just snapped into existence there, reflected perfectly. Condensation? Smudge? Brain glitching from stress, caffeine, heartbreak? Fine. Tried to ignore it. But felt that first real prickle of specific unease. Low down. Like swallowed stones.



It kept happening. Quick, unsettling flashes of wrongness, always contained within reflections. Always snapping back to normal the instant I focused, making me doubt myself relentlessly. Question my sanity. A coffee mug reflected on the kitchen counter, the one with the hairline crack I know I washed and put in the dish drainer minutes before. My reflection caught momentarily in the dark TV screen wearing the other sweatshirt, the grey hooded one still hanging on the back of the chair across the room. Tiny visual stutters. Glitches in the mirrored world that felt… deliberate. Pointed. Targeted. Like reality had typos only I could see, designed specifically to make me unravel.



Tried taking photos. Obsessively. Useless. Point my phone, reflections look subtly, undeniably wrong. Click the shutter. Check the photo. Perfectly normal mirror image. Every. Damn. Time. Holding the phone, looking at the digital picture that proves I’m not seeing what I’m seeing… it’s a specific, insidious, perfectly executed form of psychological torture. Makes me want to smash the phone, smash every reflective surface in this goddamn apartment until there’s nothing left to lie to me.



Tried calling Maya again. Tried to sound casual, joking about weird light, needing glasses, ha ha. "Maybe cut back on the coffee?" she suggested, voice laced with that careful kindness that telegraphs I think you're cracking up. "Get some sleep, Sarah, okay?" Didn't push it. Hearing my own shaky voice trying to rationalize reflections being actively wrong… sounded completely unhinged even to me. Hung up feeling the isolation clamp down harder, thicker. Breakup left a hollow space; this creeping wrongness was filling it with cold dread.



Then it wasn't just momentary glitches anymore. A few nights ago. Sitting hunched on the second-hand couch (smells faintly of stale cigarettes and cat), rain hammering the windows, turning them into dark, slick mirrors reflecting the single lamp. Scrolling numbly through depressing news on my phone. That prickling feeling on my neck intensified – the stare. Not just a feeling this time. A heavy, physical certainty. Looked up slowly, deliberately, heart beginning its frantic drumbeat, at the living room window reflection. My own head and shoulders reflected back. Behind me, the reflection showed the bedroom door. Closed. Firmly shut, a solid, pale slab of wood in the murky reflection, looking unnaturally flat and final.



Except… I froze. Breath caught hard, painfully. I never close the bedroom door. Live alone. Makes the tiny apartment feel like a shoebox closing in. Suffocating. I always leave it open.



Heart started that sick, heavy pounding against my ribs, panicked bird trapped inside. Didn't move. Didn't breathe. Just stared at the reflection, eyes wide. Closed door. Stayed that way. Five seconds. Ten. Fifteen. Long enough for the absolute, concrete impossibility to sink in, cold and sharp as glass under a fingernail. Slowly, fighting the tremor that started violently in my hands, I turned my head just enough. Looked over my shoulder at the actual bedroom doorway.



Wide open. A dark, yawning rectangle leading into the unlit room. Exactly as it should be.



Whipped my head back to the window. The reflection instantly corrected itself. Open door. Matching reality.



But I saw it. It wasn't a flicker. It wasn't my brain misfiring. It was wrong, objectively, demonstrably wrong, and it stayed wrong until I looked away. Like it was waiting. Like it was flexing a muscle. Or testing the flimsy barrier between my reality and its… distorted, increasingly bold echo.



Last night. Couldn't sleep. Predictably. The 3 AM radiator clang (three, pause, two) felt like hammer blows against my skull. Felt wired, raw, skin crawling. Every settling creak sounded deliberate, like footsteps. Kept glancing towards the bedroom door, shut tight now (by me, useless lock checked three times), thinking about those huge, dark closet mirrors lurking inside like predators. Finally dragged myself up for water around 2 AM, throat painfully dry, mouth tasting like old pennies, heart fluttering wild.



Walked back down the short, dim hallway towards the couch, the only place feeling marginally less hostile. Had to pass the full-length hallway mirror near the bathroom. Tried to avoid looking. Watched my feet on the worn carpet runner, counting faded roses. But caught movement – or rather, a profound, shocking lack of movement – in my peripheral vision. Froze mid-step, muscles locking painfully. Forced myself to turn slowly, neck cracking, stiff with dread. Looked.



Stared into the hallway mirror. My reflection stared back. Looked… normal at first glance. Same worn grey pyjamas, same sleep-deprived eyes shadowed purple. But something was fundamentally, terrifyingly wrong. Took a sickening second for my oxygen-starved brain to register. My own chest was visibly rising and falling, breath coming in short, panicked gasps that were loud, wet, obscene in the utter silence. The reflection’s chest was perfectly still. Utterly, unnervingly motionless. It wasn’t breathing.



We stood there for what felt like an hour, probably only ten agonizing seconds. Me, gasping, dizzy, vision tunnelling. It, perfectly still, wearing my face like a freshly borrowed, poorly fitting, suffocating mask, not breathing.



Then, its head tilted. A slow, deliberate, inquisitive movement that didn’t match any muscle twitch I made, smooth yet somehow disjointed. Its eyes – my eyes, but suddenly vacant, glassy, like cheap doll's eyes reflecting dim light without depth or life – seemed to focus directly on me with a dawning, profoundly alien intelligence. Calculating. Assessing. Curious.



Its lips parted slightly. Not a smile. Something worse. As if testing the mechanics of a mouth. A faint, wet clicking sound seemed to emanate not from the reflection's mouth, but from the surface of the glass itself, sharp and distinct. Click… click-click… Like saliva snapping between teeth that weren't quite real, or insect mandibles rubbing together.



That broke the paralysis. A strangled sob tore out, raw and ugly. I spun away, scrabbling blindly at the living room doorway like a trapped animal, stumbling onto the couch, burying my face deep into the musty cushions, muffling my own whimpering gasps. Didn’t look back. Couldn't.



Sat there, shaking uncontrollably, drenched in cold sweat that chilled me to the bone, until the grey, indifferent light of dawn filtered through the dirty windows. Didn't hear anything else. But I felt it. The stillness behind me. The focused, calculating awareness emanating from that hallway mirror, even hours later, even facing away.



It’s not just glitches anymore. It’s not just watching. It’s animating. Demonstrating independent movement. Making sounds. It’s… practicing? Testing its borrowed form? Learning the basic mechanisms of life it observes, like breathing?



The reflection in my dark phone screen looks normal now. Tired. Scared. Haunted. Shattered. But the eyes… are they my eyes looking out? Or just holes reflecting dim light back at me? When I look away, do they keep watching? Do they blink when I don't? Do they practice expressions in the dark?



I don’t know what this thing is. But it’s here. And it’s learning my face. And I think it's learning faster now. Much faster.
