Half past eight, Carolee shuffled into the corner bodega, pieces of her tattered sneakers slithering around her feet. Seven minutes later, she reemerged. Like clockwork. She scurried down the sidewalk, canvas bag sagging off her shoulder.

“It’s just little stuff,” the cashier had told me a few weeks before. “Protein bars, chips. A can of soda here and there. The Rodriguez’ would kill me if they knew, but shit. I just feel bad for her.”

I slipped from my car and across the street. Naked without my camera, the evening's thick humidity still weighed on me. Clung to me. Entering the alley felt akin to being swallowed.

Carolee's mass of messily threaded braids bobbed around a corner.

The alley spread out like veins, opening into narrow pathways scattered throughout the beating heart of the city. Turn here. Turn there. Mind the unforgiving brick closing in. The deepening shades of rot to either side served as a roadmap.

Though the final dregs of murky daylight still dripped from the sky above, a burst of fluorescence up ahead left me reeling. Just last week, that fixture had been barren, the door beneath it equally lonely. Paint peeling, knob missing; the city might’ve boarded it up had an official been bothered to wander this far.

As my hand met flimsy plywood, something in my belly clenched tight as a fist. I pushed ahead.

Dust danced before me, softly illuminated. Nests of moth-eaten blankets and cracked syringes crowded the periphery of the abandoned living space. No audience, as far as I could tell, but a distinct image of desiccated bodies pulling themselves from cloth-covered graves flashed through my mind. 

There was no room for doubt. I wouldn’t get a second chance.

I cleared my throat.

“Carolee Mick? Are you in here?” The words crawled their way through corners and cracks before bouncing back to me. They were met with silence. I pulled the door closed behind me and slipped my phone from my pocket.

“I just need to speak with you. And then I’ll leave, if you like. Just fifteen minutes of your time.”

Shining my flashlight made it worse, the pure squalor of the surroundings. Scattered wrappers, molded styrofoam. I pushed forward into what was once a dining room to find a bucket in the corner overflowing with human waste.

“Your parents just want to know that you’re okay. They’re very worried about you.”

Shrill laughter pierced the air. I couldn’t tell where it came from. Another door in the corner led me to the kitchen.

“Look, I’m not here to make you do anything you don’t want to. You're an adult now, it's your decision. But your family deserves some closure, don't you think?”

A cabinet door shot open, wobbling on its single hinge. A shadow scuttled inside, sending shivers radiating down my spine.

Technically, my job was finished. It'd been finished days ago when I'd sat across from Mr. and Mrs. Mick, slid glossy photos across their marbled countertop and confirmed that the grimy street urchin captured within was, in fact, their missing daughter. I offered hope less often than I dashed it, but it wasn't my responsibility to bring her home.

Yet this case had burrowed into me like a thistle.

The back exit was blocked by an overturned refrigerator. A half bath to my right was empty save for its share of apocalyptic debris. One darkened archway remained, my light just barely cutting through to reveal a descending stairwell. 

“I'm coming down, Carolee. I'm not here to hurt you. I promise. Just stay where you are.”

It was her picture that’d grabbed ahold of me, erupted into my mind in the dead of night, or while in line at the coffee shop. Not the ones that I’d taken, but the photo that her parents had provided: Carolee at twelve years old, wild-haired and fierce, elbows buried in the dirt. She must’ve looked up just as the camera flashed, glaring eyes displaying her eternal frustration at the intrusion.

It’d been charming at first, her parents claimed, back when she was younger. At around six, their daughter had started to dig, ripping holes through their yard with single-minded determination. She’d shove her toys in and cover them up, then spend the day sitting cross-legged in the lawn as though waiting for them to sprout. 

They never did.

As she grew, so did her obsession. Instead of knick knacks, she was soon burying more valuable objects. Her father’s car keys. Her mother’s wedding ring. Their home became a war zone when her offerings were unearthed. She'd bash her head against the walls, tear the carpet to shreds. A severe and unusual form of OCD was the official diagnosis, but no amount of treatment dulled her compulsion. By the time she’d reached her teens, her parents would’ve been relieved to fret over older boyfriends or drugs. Instead, they were locking her in her room at night to keep her out of the dirt.

Yet the dirt was right where she’d found herself. The basement that I emerged into was not only unfinished - it was demolished. Concrete had been ground to rubble, mixed with the loose earth beneath. The floor was pockmarked with wells a half-foot deep. I dared a couple measured steps onto the treacherous terrain, scanning the cavern with the beam from my phone.

“It’s been awhile,” Carolee said, the words enveloping me like a rushing wave. They may have been a whisper. They may have been a scream.

“It’s been eight years,” I confirmed. Eight years, almost to the day, since Carolee had gone missing. She’d slipped out of school between classes. The alarm was raised after her second absence. A neighbor boy who’d been home sick that day had sworn he’d seen her out in her yard. Digging and digging. 

He’d sworn he’d seen her crawl into the hole she’d dug. Sworn it’d closed right up behind her.

“It’s been awhile,” Carolee said. “Since someone’s heard her calling.”

There, in the corner! I jerked my light to the left but found nothing save for some flickering shadows. They stretched and contracted, teasing me from my periphery. The tightness in my stomach turned to stone.

“Carolee?”

“But it’s not enough to hear her, Max. Anyone can hear her, if they try to. Anyone can hope.”

A groan echoed down the staircase. I spun around, yelping at a shadowed figure now crouched on the bottom step. This one didn’t wane. It elongated. Carolee Mick was a slight woman, all skin and bones and draping cloth. Yet there in the doorway her presence felt nigh impenetrable. 

“What do you hope for, Max?”

I scrambled backward, heel sinking into a ditch. Fragmented rock tore into my back and my phone clattered across the floor. It landed prone a yard or so away, beam pointed skyward and offering the smallest hint of illumination.

Carolee loomed over me, grimly cheeks pulled into a grin. Those eyes were fierce as ever, reminiscent of the young girl she’d once been; tow-headed and stubbornly streaked in dirt. Yet when her lips parted to reveal blackened teeth, graveyard breath, the pressure building in my gut erupted into a scream.

She dropped to her knees and forced a fistful of rocky earth into my mouth. 

“It’s not enough to hope, either. Hearing and hoping, that’s what they all do. Because they’re afraid. Because they’re cowards.”

I rolled to my belly, gagging and clawing at my lips. The feral creature at my side skittered a few feet in front of me and perched on the edge of another crater. 

“If you want her, Max,” she said, “if you want everything, you’re going to have to find her.”

I pushed up on my elbows, struggled to find purchase with my knees. The hole before me was black as night, black as death. Even as my body fought to run, my gaze caught on that hideous well. It wasn’t a trick of the light; the darkness was moving.

Carolee caught my collar, lurched me forward. 

No, Carolee hadn’t moved.

Another scream tore from my throat and was swallowed moments later by the warm embrace of her.

I awoke days later, half buried in a field several towns over. The early morning sun felt like fire on my skin. I gasped for breath and then gagged until a torrent of black soil seeped from my mouth onto the dewy,  torn grass below.

A hiker found me a few hours later, still mewling and weak.

I never told the Micks what happened.

I keep close to my apartment in the city. I steer clear of parks, never venture out of town. It's enough for now. 

It won't be forever. 

My dreams of Carolee have shifted to dreams of soft, pliant dirt. A maternal embrace, enveloping me in endless darkness. I feel it in my gut, shifting in my veins. 

It feels like home.

And each night as I close my eyes I hear a gentle whisper, coaxing me further into the ground. 

You have to find her.
