I've experienced so much spiritual/paranormal stuff in my life.

Younger years: Sleep walked out of my bedroom and into the den in the middle of the night and could see my Mom (something that made itself to look like my mom) at the kitchen table with a candle lit in front of her, looking dead ahead no movement, nothing. I snapped out of it and was so freaked out I couldn't go back to sleep alone. Next case was I was sleeping in bed and was in the middle of a dream where I was watching baseball and/or hearing a baseball crowd and I could feel two fingers walking across my shoulder/arm like when you use your fingers to make it look like a person walking. Woke fully up and there was nobody there. Mid-day nap. Definitely not part of my dream.

College era: Saw about three paranormal demonic entities on separate occasions. One was kneeled down next to my bed that resembled a woman I was in college with except she had a shiny/glossy face almost like a porcelain doll and was murmuring something but eventually disappeared. Second one resembled my grandmother with her back turned and then turned to face me, and the third one was a "shadow person" about halfway through the floor in front of my closet in the middle of the night and was definitely a darker shadow than the darkness in my room cause I could make out a body shape and a wide-brim hat.

Years later: Started getting bloody scratches on my back and shoulders that were three or four "claw marks" that were like kinda bleeding and would burn when they started to "appear." Much of the time I was awake and during the day or morning or evening and not even touching that part of my body when they would appear. That kept on for years here and there.

More recent years: Hearing my name called, hearing demonic voices wheez laughing or just saying things, saw a serpent-like angelic being watching over me that looked like it was thousands of years old, had someone with a deep voice try to comfort me and even knew my name and placed their hand on my shoulder, saw myself trying to get back into my body laying on the couch coming from behind my head after my spirit was being chased by some demonic entity in this alternate shadowy dimly lit dimension of my same apartment as I was "sleep." Also recorded footage of banging and stuff going on in the kitchen as I was sleep and an audible voice saying "hey" near the phone camera and a visible distortion in the video when that happened. Also, sleep walked into my bathroom and drew an image of patterns all on the mirror using water from the faucet and didn't know I had done it until I woke up the next morning. Saw an image of an African American (homeless?) man dancing in front of me one night when I woke up suddenly.

So yeah been through some stuff.
