This may seem so fake but please somebody hear me out and help me, idk what is going on. My name is Marcy, I’m a 17 year old gender-fluid individual. (Pronouns she/they/it) I live in the upper midwestern part of America. I am being hunted by something but I don’t know 

what. Weird things have started from a very young age but the last few years have been the weirdest. I should start with the walker that hunted my neighbourhood. I was in my room with the window open and I heard this sound, it almost sounded like a sobbing baby. I ran downstairs and said “what the hell was that” and my brother (11M) and mom (49F) were standing in the kitchen with the back door 

open. I started laughing at them and said that they scared me, but they looked at me with the same look I had when I had heard the sound. They were saying they didn’t make any noise and that they heard it too. I did not believe them and told them that they got me and that 

the joke was over, I did not find it funny (I 
suffer with awful mental health issues like psychosis and BPD so hallucinations happen quite often) they know about my mental health so it struck me as odd for them to play that kind of joke on me. When they continued to look scared I realized they weren’t joking. They started to tell me they heard a noise that 

sounded like something trying to mimic the sound of a grunting man, I told them I heard the sound of a crying baby. I sent my brother to his room so he wouldn’t be freaked out. Me and my mom stepped outside to see if we could hear anything else. She pointed out that my dog was terrified. I could see my dog 

trembling and staring across the yard. After a bit all the dogs in the neighbourhood started barking (including my dog) after about 5 minutes of barking they all stopped abruptly. My mom and I were super weirded out. Then we heard another dog start barking, the weird thing is that it didn’t sound like a dog,  but something trying to mimic the sound of a dog. It sounded like it was coming from our yard but the only dog that was there was my dog Lucy. 

She shook and ran inside. The barking was slow and extremely unnerving. I heard a neighbour shout “shut the fuck up!” So obviously he heard it too. The barking sounded closer so we went inside and closed the door. We went around and locked every door and window. That happened almost a year ago. Now I have been struggling immensely with 

mental health issues and on the first of this year I tried to take my own life. I was super close to succeeding until the cops found me. It’s just gotten worse. Two days ago a mark appeared on my collar bone (it looks like a semi circle with a tiny circle under it) it burned and then suddenly appeared. Yesterday during school I opened my laptop to do some school work and it started to freeze, then the screen 

went black, when it turned back on everything was red and there was an awfully terrible face in the middle. I freaked out and shut the laptop, pushing it away from me. My partner asked if I was okay and I asked if they saw it too, they said they weren’t looking and asked what I saw. I didn’t wanna seem crazy by telling them. My luck has been awful and I 

keep hearing the whistling noise. Today I went face first into the ice, I’m all swollen and cut up. I noticed today another mark, identical to the first mark on my neck now. The first mark looks like it’s gotten more prominent and it hurts more. It looks like a significant design and I’m looking for answers. I feel like I’m going insane and I’m getting very little sleep. Please somebody help me.
