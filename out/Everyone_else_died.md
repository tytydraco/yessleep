I've been kind of obsessing over wtf happened out there. I grew up deep in the mountains of north Idaho, 30 miles from the nearest town with had a population of 2000. The woods are a comfortable place for me. Just not this place. I'll try to keep it as breif as possible without leaving out key details.

My wife's uncle (J) bought some land just north of spokane Washington with a friend of the family (K).
They got it at a significant discount because a nearby aluminum smelter had polluted the ground and it was impossible to use the water beneath the ground. They had set up 2 plots and each had a camper to live in.


J had been progressively getting paranoid and saying people where stalking him and watching him in the trees.
About 3 months into living there a man wandering through the woods there had an interaction with J and ended up attacking him and breaking his jaw. Upon being arrested the man said he was overcome with the desire to see if he could kill him with a single punch.

 2 months later J was murdered in his sleep on the couch in his camper. K found him and immediately ran as far away until he stopped to call the police. There was sufficient evidence of who did it and they quickly caught the killer who was a 19yo boy who said he simply wanted his bike. He beat him to death with a power tool that was lying on he floor nearby, completely bashed his brains in.


K was completely terrified at all times to be there alone, he had moved in with a family member until 8 months later he ended up with nowhere else to go and had to return. In constant fear he finally convinced my pregnant wife and I to come stay with him. The second I turned off the highway onto the property I was overcame with dread. There were at least 250 crows covering the dirt road up to the property. I didn't sleep whatsoever the first night. I stared into the forest searching for the cause of my intense fear. The energy of this place was so uncomfortable and I assumed it was simply just knowing uncle J was killed here.

Even the days were eery, never did I have a moment where I didn't feel watched here. My wife and I always had the sense of fear especially after dark. Things sort of normalized for a while until one day K began puking and feeling very light headed all the time. I took him to the hospital and they said he was fine, probably a flu. At this point it was the anniversary of J's murder. 3 days after the date of J's death K comes running out of his camper screaming I can't breath waking my wife and I up and we run out to see what's wrong. K had gotten into his car and floored it crashing into a nearby tree.

I run up and peer through the window to see the most intense and most primal fear I've ever seen in someone's eyes. He was gasping and clutching his chest, moments later he breathed out one last time and he was dead. I preformed cpr for 30 minutes until ems arrived and pronounced him dead
It was July 10th, one year and 3 days after moving there with J and they were both dead. 

Now it's only me and the wife alone on the property. Every moment living in fear and not understanding what had happened here. Idk why we didn't leave right away. One day I come out to get fresh water from a drum we kept for water to smell the worst smell I'd ever smelled. The water container had a 1 inch opening on top, and inside the water was bits and pieces of chipmunks. Like spines and heads. They didn't fall in, something ripped them apart before putting them inside.

 The nights were getting worse and worse. I never saw anything just always filled with unease. Hearing crashing and footsteps every night. One night my wife and I return home to having the worst feeling I've ever felt. Everything looked different, although everything was right where we left it nothing seemed in place. Looking around I suddenly see this orange long haired manged cat sitting on a stump. This cats eyes were so intense. Fiery, almost glowing but not quite.

We start hearing branches snapping, pine needles crunching, seemingly from every direction. I'm still staring at this cat almost frozen in fear. Suddenly a voice breaks out echoing throughout the forest. "Hello? Is anyone out here"? A little girl I thought, but something was off. My wife yells back. "Hello? Are you ok?" "Anybody!" The voice had changed. "Help, help me!" We yell back several times without response "SOMEBODY FU#KING HELP ME!!!" The most intense shreiking, evil sounding voice of a woman.

I'm filled with more intense fear than I can ever describe, but my wife, she Is overcome with the need to find this person, and she started to head off into the forest without a word. I grabbed her by the arm and tell her something isn't right, why won't she respond to us? She tries to break free from me to go off alone.  I tell her to get into the truck and I'll grab the spotlights we aren't going on foot.

We roll the windows down and shine my intensely bright LED lights throughout the forest. We slowly creep down the road yelling back. As we get further down the road the voice strikes out "please, won't anyone fu#king help!" Sounds are difficult to pin down in the woods but this one was very close.

 I hit the breaks and stop immediately, we shine the lights and yell back searching. No sign of anyone when suddenly the voice explodes into the cabin of the vehicle as if they were standing right outside my window "HELP......ME......SOMEBODY FU!KING HELP!"  leaving my ears hurting and ringing.

I hit the gas and didn't look back. Called the police when I hit the highway and afterwards they said there was no one around. I picked up our stuff the next day and my wife gave birth the following day. We never stayed there again after the baby was born. What the hell could do these things? I never even believed in paranormal things before but idk what else happened.
