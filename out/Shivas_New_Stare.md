I can't sleep anymore. It's the same thing every night. I shut all the fences of the pens, I set food for the barn cats, turn off the lights and get in bed. I lie down, overwhelmed with hypotheticals and questions, all about the night they took my dog. Shiva. She was a dog I had found when I first moved up here. She had a wolf like snout with dirty blonde fur, pointy, heightened ears, and dark brown eyes that stared at you, never into you. She was an intense burst of emotion, staying by my side to light up my farm.

But that one, unforgettable night, we were herding the sheep later than usual, when a car came blasting down one of my highways. They're those old connector highways the government would use in the 70s, but they're all shut down now. They don't lead anywhere anymore, they don't come from anywhere anymore, yet still, the shadows of my land are now being stolen by the glow of their lights. The sheep usually focus on Shiva, because she looks like the predators you'd find here, but everybody's attention was on that car in the distance. Shiva saw it coming as soon as its light showed faintly on the hills. It got closer and closer, lighting up more and more as it grew on the road. The light got Shiva's attention, and she seemed stuck in a trance, hypnotized by the twin headlights. She shook and whimpered, her legs buckled and her tail flew down. The car came up right next to us, and Shiva took off with it. She bolted up and ran as fast as she could, chasing the car until my eyesight failed me. 

I moved here to get away from those creatures. All those people that I couldn't force myself to live with. I hated every single cell in their lying, cancerous bodies. I hated having to choose what face to look at when I spoke, I hated when they'd avoid my eyesight when they talked, but what I hated with the most burning and passionate fire was their blinding stares. Walking through the streets, the white of their eyes ignoring me while their pupils darted to me like the arrow of a compass. Their white would pass through me while their pupils blew my body through the streets with the wind. Now I lie in my soggy bed, sighing harmonies with the coarse groans of my dying home, following the metronome of raindrops on my porch. I listen for whatever blows through the fields, open eyed, yet absent minded. It was a little while after I heard an owl on some of the trees outside, when the wind shoved the echo of a bark against my red stained window. 

That impact seemed like it should have broken the window, but instead, the moldy wood began to slip out of place. The glass panes dismembered like a finished puzzle, and lifted as though gravity became conscious for me. My wall opened up and the outside blew my crippled bed against my bedroom door. All the contents of my room were shoved against the walls, and a staircase of glass formed as the wind slowed to a stop. I flew out of my room and into the land. 

The fields opened up for me and I sprinted through them. The sky opened up and made me my own atmosphere. I felt like Moses. The grass was darting away from me like magnets repelling as I continued to make my way down the path. I met the dark shadow of the forest and made my way in. The willow trees grew, their arms reaching out and stretching along the dark green ceiling of the forest. Their leaves turned to constellations, showing me the way like traffic signs. My new bubbling sky led me to the bridge down by the stream. I stumbled over mossy rocks and past whispering fireflies when I saw a little tail through the blanket of leaves. It was Shiva. 

Her head poked out of the trees on the granite path. I sprinted towards her, but as I bent down to embrace her, my stomach dropped. It was odd, I haven't felt that since my eyes were stuck on the slabs of sectioned sidewalk. I slowly stood up, and she threw her face violently against my legs and started nuzzling me. It wasn't like an embrace to signify you missed someone, it was more forced and planned. Like she was trying to rub her scent through me. Shiva was a relaxed, lethargic, and emotional dog, I don't know what happened, but now she seems robotic. She computes her decisions and acts with little to no emotion. 

Shiva was jumping up on my leg, trying to get her head through my shin, when all of a sudden, she froze. It wasn't like a "just stopped moving" freeze, she froze mid air, pausing everything that controls her with her. She had took gravity back as her jester, the stream stopped it's descent, and now seemed to be running in place My atmosphere lost it's power. All the constellations slowly died out, and the shadows of the forest retook their place. I looked around at my new surroundings. There were trees that were full of leaves, acting healthy and fresh, but the leaves were all withered and gray. They looked like they would disintegrate at the touch. The warm orange light that seemed so welcoming and blissful, was now a red hue you can vaguely see through the gray of the trees. The trunks of the trees shifted to the crooked teeth of some sinister smile, the red eyes the finishing touch that stared into me. I looked at Shiva, her head down, frozen in place from when my forest went black. 

Her head began to twitch and seizure like some wrecked video film on an old camera. Her seizure head slowly raised up, and with every millisecond of her intense ascent, more and more of my dogs face was revealed to my eyes. Her eyes. There were eye sockets still, but now, on the place where my dog used to see me from, there were two pairs of chapped human lips, bleeding from the stitches that kept them sewn shut. Her snout came up, and I saw the waves of blood gushing out of her nose. It was horrible, but I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Her head was now shaking so intensely, it seemed like it would collapse in on itself like a dying star at any given moment. The last thing I saw while her head was still shaking was her mouth. Once I had seen Shiva's full face, her twitching stopped. For a second, I almost found it comforting. The radio silence, the complete lack of motion, the end of her seizure, it was a relief. But that was before she opened her mouth. Shivas snout opened slowly, going so wide that it exceeded the limits her jaw had provided. Inside her mouth, I saw a sunset. The white sky ran along the floor of her mouth as it waited for the sun to awake. That's when I saw it. The thing that made my muscles give up, the thing that made my throat close up and dry out, the thing that told me something new has taken it's place; Shivas new stare. 

Inside her mouth, I saw one bright red pupil taking the place of the sun. It was surrounded by a sea of white, confined to the bars of her teeth. It was a familiar look.  It stared at me and shot it's gaze into me. My body was thrown back. When I looked back, I saw worms of light oozing out of it, like a kaleidoscope vision getting increasingly closer and closer. I kept taking steps back and back, but the worms didn't move with me. They kept wiggling closer and closer until they reached my face. They bit into my eyeballs and I let out a piercing scream. The walls of the damp forest compressed, and the noise bounced back a distorted and backwards version into my ears. 

It's worms are inside me, they've taken my vision. I could feel them wiggling around, trying to get inside my pupils. I fought, and fought, and fought. I pinched and lifted my eyelid for my bitten fingernails to dig out the parasites, I shoveled at the white dirt until my hands bled, I stuck my fingers in my ears to try to pop them out from the inside, but nothing worked. I could still see everything. Zombified and lobotomized, I turned my blank expression down towards Shivas eye, but I couldn't find it any longer. I just saw that red Pupil, staring into me while the ocean of white grows out of the mouth to swallow my perception. It felt like It was controlling my motion, like the Pupil was magnetized to me. I was standing an arms reach away from it when we first met, but now it seems like I'm standing two inches form a illuminated billboard. The Stare swallowed my perception and shit out a boundless Gaze for me to mindlessly consume. 

The ocean of white was flowing through me now. All I saw was the Pupil, staring into me, and it was mesmerizing. The Eye speaks to me. I feel Its voice holding my hand, I smell Its words every time I take a breath, I can see Its touch as It surrounds everything I know and embraces my vision. The Gaze unlocked me, all I'll ever feel is shivas stare. I'm eternally indebted, but I'm sure It doesn't mind, It's found It's new home in me. The worms slither through all the wrinkles in my brain and fill my blood with red pupiled manure. My body is It. I am whatever It wishes. I'll be a never-rusting statue, an infinite monument to the Pupil. As the growing whiteness began to swallow the rest of that dark green scenery, I took one last observation. I looked around at whatever this was, the dark green trees filled with shadows running away from me, the rabbit and firefly all trying not to drown in the enclosing white, the limping coyote staring at me, the granite path dissolving to dust, it's all leaving me. Now I'm stuck in this boundless nothingness, feeling the Stare throughout my being. I'm here now, but I don't need to understand. The Stare tells me all I ever need to know. I'm just grateful I can be a temple to Its beauty.

Oh shiva, thank you for letting me be an extension of your gaze.
