I woke up with a bitter taste in my mouth. Not coffee-bitter—sharper than that. I reached for the water on the nightstand.

“Ow!” a woman said as I accidentally smacked her in the head mid-swipe.

My eyes snapped open.

A woman was in bed with me. Older than me—at least ten years. How the hell did she end up here?

Wait… where is here?

The bed was a king-sized monster with a plush mattress topper, silky comforter, and a fortress of pillows. There was a nightstand on either side.

This wasn’t my bed. Mine was a sad twin with the same sheets I’d had since moving out of my parents’ place.

I sat up fast. The woman was watching me, rubbing her head.

“Are you alright, honey?” she asked.

“H-honey? I’m your honey?” I said, inching toward the edge of the bed. My foot touched the floor, and I flinched—it was stone. Cold stone.

I finally looked around. The room had cobblestone walls, floors, and ceiling. Light came from a tall, barred window. The whole place felt like a castle.

“Alan, are you feeling okay? I know we had a fight last night, but—”

“Where am I?” I interrupted, heart pounding. How did I get here? What even was last night?

I remembered drinks with Rob. Was that yesterday?

“You’re home, dear. In our bedroom,” she said softly.

“Home? Our bedroom? I… I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

I stood up, shielding myself and scanning for clothes.

“What are you looking for?” she asked, rising from the bed. She was also naked. I turned away quickly.

“Clothes. My clothes. Any clothes.”

“They’re in the wardrobe, dear,” she said, gesturing to a tall dresser beside a vanity cluttered with makeup.

I opened it. The clothes inside looked like something from a period drama. Velvet, high collars, weird buttons.

“Whose are these?” I asked, not turning around.

“Yours, honey!” she said. “Seriously, are you okay? Do I need to call the doctor?”

I pulled on a pair of trousers that fit disturbingly well.

“Ma’am… what year is it?” I asked, staring at the wall.

“Alan. You’re really starting to scare me. Let’s go get some breakfast, alright?”

“What year is it?!” I shouted, turning on her. “Am I in the past? Is this a joke? Why am I in a castle? What’s with these clothes?”

“Y-you said you always wanted to live in a castle,” she stammered. “You picked out all those clothes yourself.”

That… sounded like me.

I looked down at the suit. Midnight blue, double-breasted, a silver chain across the vest. It looked expensive. Regal. Something I would’ve drooled over in a fantasy artbook when I was a kid.

I turned to the mirror, curious to see how I looked in it.

For a second, I was impressed. The suit fit perfectly, the cut made me look taller, stronger.

But then I really looked at the face.

It wasn’t nineteen anymore.

My jawline was sharper. There was faint stubble, like I hadn’t shaved in a few days. My eyes looked... heavier somehow. Tired.

I looked like someone who’d seen things. Someone who'd lived a little too much life.

Someone ten years older.
