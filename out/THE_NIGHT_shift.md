**Hey Reddit,**



**I wanted to share a personal experience that’s been haunting me for a while. It’s taken me some time to come to terms with it, and I’m still not sure I fully understand what happened. I’m not looking for sympathy, just a place to share what I went through and maybe find some peace. So, here it goes**



**I’ve always hated working the night shift at the hospital. The long, empty corridors, the dim lights, the eerie silence—all of it combined to create a perfect setting for unease. But nothing prepared me for what happened that night.**



**It started like any other shift. I was assigned to the psychiatric ward, a place notorious for strange occurrences. Patients would often scream in the middle of the night, claiming they saw shadows or heard whispers. We chalked it up to their conditions and the effects of their medications. But deep down, I always felt there was something more to it.**



**Around 2 AM, I was making my rounds when I noticed Room 304’s door slightly ajar. The patient inside, Mr. Owens, was a middle-aged man who had been admitted for severe paranoia. He claimed something was following him, something only he could see. Despite the security of the ward, he seemed perpetually terrified.**



**As I pushed the door open, I found Mr. Owens standing in the corner, facing the wall. His body was rigid, and he was muttering something under his breath. I approached cautiously, trying to reassure him.**



**“Mr. Owens, it’s okay. You’re safe here.”**



**He didn’t respond, his whispers growing more frantic. I stepped closer, and that’s when I heard it. He wasn’t just muttering—he was conversing. There was another voice, low and guttural, responding to him. The hair on the back of my neck stood up.**



**“Mr. Owens, who are you talking to?”**



**He slowly turned to face me, and I saw pure terror in his eyes. “It’s here,” he whispered. “It’s always been here.”**



**Suddenly, the room went ice-cold. My breath became visible, and the lights flickered. A sense of dread washed over me, something primal and instinctual. I wanted to run, but my feet were rooted to the spot.**



**Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a shadow move—only it wasn’t just a shadow. It had form and substance, a shape that defied logic. It slithered along the walls, growing and contracting as if it were alive. My heart pounded in my chest as it approached Mr. Owens.**



**He began to scream, a blood-curdling sound that echoed through the halls. The shadow enveloped him, and his screams turned to gurgles. I watched, paralyzed, as his body convulsed and then went limp. The shadow retreated, leaving nothing but a lifeless husk.**



**I stumbled back, my mind racing. This couldn’t be real. I had to be hallucinating. But the cold, the terror, the screams—they were all too vivid.**



**I reported the incident, but the hospital administration chalked it up to a psychotic break and a heart attack. They assured me it was just my mind playing tricks on me due to the stress of the job. But I knew what I saw.**



**Weeks passed, and I started noticing changes in myself. I felt constantly watched, even in my own home. Shadows seemed to move in the corners of my vision, and I began hearing whispers when I was alone. Sleep became a distant memory as nightmares plagued my nights.**



**One evening, as I was getting ready for another shift, I noticed a dark spot on my bedroom wall. It pulsed and writhed, growing larger by the second. The whispers grew louder, and a familiar dread settled in my stomach.**



**I realized then that whatever had taken Mr. Owens had followed me home. It was biding its time, feeding off my fear. And I knew that it was only a matter of time before it claimed me too.**



**Now, as I sit here, writing this, I can feel it behind me. The temperature is dropping, and the whispers are becoming more insistent. I don’t know how much longer I have, but I needed to share my story, to warn others.**



**If you ever feel something watching you, hear whispers in the dead of night, or see shadows that don’t belong—run. Because once it finds you, there’s no escape.**

**Sleep well**
