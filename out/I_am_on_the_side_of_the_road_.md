I am on the side of the road. I have been for what feels like centuries. Time feels slower, much slower, when your only view is barren trees that line the interstate along 280. 

This started thousands of years ago. Or, maybe it was last week. It was like any night. I was driving home from work. And, like every other night, I passed by the only thing that interested me in my life of cycles - 

a car.

It'd been there for at least a week now. An old, beat up, Honda Odyssey. For the fun of it, I decided to theorize about exactly why this car persisted throughout my week, never leaving its spot on the side of the road. Maybe there was some car killer, luring people out of their vehicles at night and taking them somewhere, to never be found again. It was one of the very few bright spots of my day, theorizing about that car. 

And then there was another.

My headlights cut through the darkness. It illuminated, tall, winding trees, trees with spindly branches devoid of leaves. It illuminated the stray piece of litter every so often, whether it be a plastic bag or a soda can. I was reaching the spot where the Honda was- It was there, like I expected- but so was another. A car I couldn't recognize. It shined a color I couldn't quite name. This confused me, I could name every car I passed. But there was something about this one- maybe it was the way it shined, shined like the stained glass of a church window at golden hour, despite its surroundings being an inky pit of darkness. Maybe it was its color, a color I had never encountered once in my life, a color that felt so foreign yet so familiar and comforting. 

It drew me in, more than the Honda had ever. This was no longer a silly game of theorization. This car, this new car, had a different kind of draw to it. It felt like a magnet, like no matter how far I got from it I'd always want to go back. The next day, or maybe the months after that, I found myself focusing on nothing but the car. I decided that I must get down and personally investigate. 

So, that night, I left for work and never came back. 

Once I got out of my own car, the pull only felt stronger. Deep in my bones, a sense of ecstasy formed. It rung inside of me, forcing me to walk, no, run, towards the car. I reached for it, placing my hand on the hood. Instantly, something shot through me, an ethereal or divine force that passed through my body. In that moment, I was convinced that this car was heaven sent. On the driver's seat, there was a note. I carefully pulled the divine door open, and snatched up the piece of paper. Four words were written at the center of the page, in perfect handwriting.

*Keep going down 280.* 

I did what the note said.

Even if I hadn't wanted to go, it wasn't an option. There was a force pulling me down 280. I drove for what felt like months. It didn't make sense. I had driven down 280 before- it'd only take a few hours. The longer I drove, the more things seemed to melt away. It seemed I was travelling through an endless field. My line of view got lower and lower. I tried to look down, but I couldn't- My eyes were glued to the road. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't look away. 

My legs began to dangle. I began to feel very, very frightened. I wept. My legs began to dangle. That's not possible, that's not possible. I could feel that something was wrong, very, very, wrong. Soon, my waist joined my legs in this strange, unfamiliar feeling. Using all my strength, I resisted whatever was forcing me to keep my eyes on the road. I looked down. 

My feet were no longer at the breaks. I was not sitting in the seat. I could not sit at all. I did not have a waist. I did not have anything below my stomach. 

I was becoming one with the car. 

Desperately, i tried to pull myself out. The leather of the seat stretched with every pull. But no matter how hard I tried, it was impossible. It was like I was stuck in molasses. 

Even though they were gone, I could still feel my legs. I began to scream. My head snapped back up, and without my control, I looked back up. I could hardly see the road anymore- it had got to my stomach.

 I reached a forest. One full of barren trees with spindly branches. Whatever had been controlling me pulled over. It was the same divine force I felt when I saw the car painted in the impossible color, although now I began to wonder if It really was heaven sent. Finally, I let go of the wheel. What was left of me sunk into the seat. 

And here I am. I can't move. Not a single muscle. Not even an twitch. I can still see, though. I can see the trees. I can see the tail end of the Honda Odyssey that I saw so long ago, or weeks ago, or hours ago. 

There are two cars on the side of the road. They will never move again. The third car has left this location for another highway. 

If you see that car, the car that shines in darkness, the car with a color not known to humanity, do not stop. Do not stop, even though the drive to do so will be strong. 

It's still hungry for more fools to trap.
