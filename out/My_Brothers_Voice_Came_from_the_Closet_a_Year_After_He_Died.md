Hey, if you prefer listening, I actually narrated this on my YT channel üëª \[https://youtu.be/yhWreBWLXwk?si=\_Kejld4ocXW89ZdS\]‚Äù

You know how some people say they can still hear the voices of the dead? I used to think that was just grief... playing tricks. Your brain, desperate for one more moment, one more word, just‚Ä¶ makes something up. Echoes of the past in the halls of your mind.

But I heard my brother‚Äôs voice.

Every night.

Coming from the closet.

Not just any closet‚Äîthe same one we used to hide in during storms when the lightning scared us more than the thunder ever could. The same closet that was sealed shut‚Ä¶ after Tyler died.

I was sixteen when he vanished.

They said it was an accident. He had wandered into the woods behind our house one night‚Äîno one knew why‚Äîand never came back. For a week, search teams combed every inch of those trees. And when they finally found him‚Ä¶

His body was twisted. Mangled. Like it had fallen from a height. Bones shattered, neck turned wrong, eyes wide open like they froze in fear.

But here‚Äôs the thing:

There‚Äôs nothing tall in those woods.

No cliffs. No towers. Nothing he could have fallen from.

Mom couldn‚Äôt take it. She sealed his room, packed away every trace of him. She said she couldn‚Äôt breathe with all the memories choking the air. Dad‚Ä¶ he just went quiet. Like a switch flipped. He stopped being there, even when he was in the room.

We moved on. Or at least‚Ä¶ we tried to.

But on the exact anniversary of his death‚Ä¶ I heard it.

2:17 AM. I remember the time because I looked at the clock, my heart already pounding from a nightmare I couldn‚Äôt remember.

And then I heard it.

A whisper.

My name.

‚ÄúSophie‚Ä¶ open the door‚Ä¶ please‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so dark‚Ä¶‚Äù

Tyler‚Äôs voice.

Clear. Scared. Small. Just like I remembered it.

I froze. My blood turned to ice. My mouth opened, but nothing came out.

The next night, it happened again.

Same time. Same voice.

And again the next.

Every night. 2:17 AM. My brother. Calling from the closet.

I thought maybe I was cracking up. Maybe this was the grief I‚Äôd been warned about. Some delayed trauma unspooling in my mind like a horror film.

So I started recording it. Just to prove‚Äîto myself, to anyone‚Äîthat I wasn‚Äôt crazy.

But every morning, the recordings were ruined. Corrupted. White noise. Static. Sometimes a high-pitched shriek. Once‚Ä¶ a faint laugh. Like someone‚Äîsomething‚Äîwas mocking me.

I finally broke down and told Mom. She refused to listen. Wouldn‚Äôt even let me finish the sentence. She screamed at me to stop. Said it was cruel to bring him up. That he was gone. End of story.

But then‚Ä¶ I found the drawing.

Tucked into the frame of the closet door.

It was old, crumpled, drawn in Tyler‚Äôs scribbly handwriting. He‚Äôd always drawn little monsters‚Äîhis weird imagination splattered in crayon.

But this wasn‚Äôt a monster.

It was me.

Standing in front of the closet.

And behind the closet door‚Ä¶ a shadow. With glowing eyes. Watching me.

He drew it before he died.

He knew.

That‚Äôs when I stopped sleeping.

I set up a camera. I needed proof. I needed to see if I was imagining it all.

But the next morning‚Ä¶ when I checked the footage‚Ä¶

I wasn‚Äôt in bed.

I was standing right in front of the closet.

Just staring at it.

Smiling.

Like something was behind the door‚Ä¶ whispering to me.

And I had no memory of it.

Sleepwalking. That‚Äôs what they said.

But why always at 2:17?

Why always toward the closet?

One night, I almost opened it. My hand was on the doorknob. I could feel the cold metal, slick with condensation. My other hand was shaking. And just before I twisted the knob‚Ä¶

Something grabbed my wrist.

Cold. Ice cold. Like death itself. And it pulled me back.

I swear‚Ä¶ it felt like Tyler.

Like he was trying to stop me.

Or maybe‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt him at all.

Maybe something else was using his voice.

I started digging. Researching. Looking up any story, any legend, that even remotely sounded like mine.

And I found it.

An old urban myth. Whispers on forums, deep in Reddit threads, and dusty paranormal blogs.

They called it *The Hollow Voice*.

A creature, a spirit‚Äîno one really knows. But it mimics the dead. Takes the voice of someone you‚Äôve lost. Uses your grief, your pain, like a key to get in.

It waits for anniversaries. Places of trauma. Doors that were once left open in fear or love.

And it calls out to you.

With the voice you miss the most.

If you answer‚Ä¶

If you open the door‚Ä¶

You trade places.

That‚Äôs when it clicked.

Tyler didn‚Äôt die in the woods.

He opened the closet.

He heard something that *sounded* like me.

I should‚Äôve burned the closet. I should‚Äôve sealed the whole room. I should‚Äôve *listened.*

But that night‚Ä¶ something changed.

I felt calm. Still. Like everything was right again. Like Tyler was there‚Äîreally there. His voice wasn‚Äôt scared this time. Just‚Ä¶ cold.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm cold, Sophie‚Ä¶ please‚Ä¶‚Äù

I opened the door.

If you ever hear your dead loved one calling from a dark place‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt answer.

Because whatever‚Äôs calling you‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs not them.

And if you hear me now‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶it‚Äôs already too late.
