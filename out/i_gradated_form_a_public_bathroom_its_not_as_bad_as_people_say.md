  
Yes, I know what you're thinking. Let me start from the beginning. I am 18 years old and just trying to look for an education. Going to college or university is far too expensive for me, so that meant I had to find some unconventional ways. I got on Reddit and many other internet forums to find information that might just help my situation. I tried everything until I found something on Reddit. It said, "IMPORTANT opportunity for an education. Don't miss it. Only 1 more slot remains." Now, I know what you're thinking, but I was desperate, so I contacted the phone number, and a woman on the other end picked up and told me where this so-called "opportunity" was going to happen. I then punched in the information into Google Maps, and it led me to a cinema. I called the number, and the same lady picked up. She told me to follow her directions, and I did, into the cinema and into a bathroom. At this point, I thought I was going to get mugged, but to my shock, I saw 5 other people there and a man with a white hood on. The others told me to come and sit down.  
  
In total, there were 5 students and 1 teacher. The teacher was the person in the white hood who seemed to have no face. All 5 students and I sat down, and the person wearing the white hoodie started to speak. "I have gathered you all here, my students, to ascend beyond the bounds of your human mind and body. But first, I must get to know all of you. First, tell me your names, then talk to each other for 5 minutes, and then we will start."  
  
The man in the white hood pointed at me and said, "You, what is your name?"  
"Zain," I said. He nodded and pointed at the next person.  
"What is your name?" he asked.  
"Noura," she answered. He then pointed at the next person before he even asked the question. They answered with the names Nick, Holly, and Leaum. The man in the white hood spoke again, "Very good. Now, get to know each other a little. You have 5 minutes."  
  
We were all socially awkward; it seemed because nobody talked for the first minute or two until I decided to build up the courage to go and speak to someone.  
  
Me: "Noura, is it?"  
Noura: "Yes, it's Noura."  
Me: "Our lives must have gone really wrong for us to end up in a public bathroom trying to get an education, am I right?"  
Noura: "Ahaha, you're right. Let's see where this takes us."  
Me: "We should try talking to other people so we all get to know each other in this crazy place."  
Noura: "Good idea. Let's do that."  
  
So, that's just what we did. I walked to Leaum; he was already talking to Holly, and I said hi.  
  
Leaum: "Hello, this is my sister Holly."  
Me: "Nice, it's good to know someone in this place."  
Leaum: "Me and my sister like to surf Reddit and found this. We were bored and came here."  
Me: "Oh wow, for me, I really need an education."  
They looked at me like I was crazy, and I added, "I was desperate."  
They laughed.  
  
I moved on to Nick, who was currently talking to Noura. I said, "Hey."  
Both Noura and Nick said, "Hi" to me. I guess Noura told him about me. But then, the man in the white hood spoke, "Sit, that is enough time getting to know each other. Now, our first lesson shall begin." He brought out 5 vials from his hoodie and filled them with tap water and told us to drink. Noura instantly rebelled.  
Noura: "There's no way you expect me to drink water from a dirty public bathroom!"  
The man in the white hood said, "Trust me, you will understand in due time."  
Noura: "I can't believe I am actually doing this."  
Everybody drank it. Noura was the last to drink; she only drank half.  
  
The man in the white hood spoke again, "Very well, I shall send you to your first test. Best of luck, my students." And just like that, with just 2 claps, we were all in a desert.  
Noura: "What the heck just happened? No, no, no, no, no. How are we here? I did not think this was real. Now we're stuck out in the middle of nowhere."  
Zack: "No way."  
Holly was petrified.  
Leaum: "Will you all get yourselves together? Look, I know what just happened is insane and makes no sense, but if we don't get it together, we are going to die out here."  
Me: "You know what, Leaum has a point. If we don't do anything, we will end up dead."  
  
It took me and Leaum about 10 minutes to console everyone, but after that, we were up and going. Noura reasoned that we should start walking in a random direction and hope to find someone or something that may help us. After about an hour of walking, we found a village that didn't look modern. It looked like it was out of the first century BCE. Their houses were made out of a mix of hardened sand and stones. What's weirder is that they spoke a mix of Brazilian and Egyptian, and even weirder, we could somehow speak and understand it.  
  
They gave us food and shelter and told us that we were not the first to come. Just a year ago, a man came to our village and solved our major problem at the time, which was water, and disappeared shortly after without a trace.  
  
Noura: "Tell me more about this man who solved your problem."  
One of the villagers responded, "No, that's all we know. He came and disappeared right after fixing our problem."  
  
Zack: "Umm, maybe we are here to solve something, a problem perhaps?"  
Me: "What makes you think that, Zack?"  
Holly: "Yeah, Zack, what makes you think that?"  
  
Leaum: "With all the crazy things that have been happening to us, I'll believe anything at this point."  
  
We asked the villagers if there is anything that they needed help with. They went silent and said, "I am sorry, but we can't tell you. It would put you in too much danger because we know you guys will go out trying to fix it."  
  
We pressed a little, and we got the villagers to spill the beans. They said that every night, a member of the village would disappear.  
  
Leaum: "So now we know what we must do. Find out whatever is making these villagers disappear and stop it, so that we can all go home."  
  
We all agreed. That night, we watched the village, and to all of our surprise, we saw somethingâ€”a black humanoid with red eyes lurking around the village. Noura was the first of us to rush to the shadow. As soon as she got close to it, it punched her with shocking amounts of strength, sending her flying.  
  
We all arrived on the scene to see the creature for ourselves. It was a standoff. Somehow, Noura got up and came to our side. She stated that she didn't even feel pain. Just then, it rushed at Leaum. Leaum dodged at light speed, returning a powerful kick, sending the creature flying. Zack jumped on the creature and got on its back. No use. The creature hit Zack, sending him flying into the air and said, "Enough." It reached its hand into the air. Right then, two hexagons appeared, one next to its hand and another next to Leaum. Just then, tentacles came out and grabbed Leaum, pinning him to the floor. Then two more hexagons appeared, one by its other hand and the other by me. Just like Leaum, the tentacles came and pinned me to the ground. Just then, at the speed of sound, Noura performed a flying kick, not just sending the creature flying but decapitating it. The four hexagons disappeared instantly. We started to cheer.  
  
But the cheering would soon come to an end as we noticed the creature's dead body started to transform into a massive hungry worm.  
  
Suddenly, I felt like I knew what to do.  
Me: "Everyone, hold hands. With the power of friendship, we will win."  
We all held hands, not knowing what else to do, and to my surprise, we became one. The power of the public bathroom water made us become one being that was above all. There were no longer 5 of us but 1 of us. All of us had combined into one. In a beyond-light-speed flash, we rushed at the worm. The whole world shook. The worm was obliterated in a flash.  
  
Just then, in a blink, we were back in the public bathroom. We were separate once again. The man in the white hood said, "Amazing, you did well, my students." Just then, Zack started to laugh as he started to hover off the ground. "Now I have the power of the public bathroom. My master, Donte, will be happy to hear this." And just like that, he vanished.  
  
The man in the white hood sat us all down and explained that there are more schools like this one. You all may have graduated from a public bathroom, but some people have graduated from a McDonald's. My enemy Donte, the very first one to graduate from a McDonald's, has ascended to god-like levels of power and is only growing stronger. His followers wish to rule the world, and so does he. He grows stronger the more people graduate from his McDonald's. He already transcends time and space. It is only me stopping him from taking over this world. I am hoping you five can stop him.
