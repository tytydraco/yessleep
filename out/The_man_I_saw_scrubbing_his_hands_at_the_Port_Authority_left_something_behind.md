Hey everyone. I work overnight security at the Port Authority. I've seen my fair share of drunks, lost tourists, homeless folks wander around during the early hours. Most of them are just trying to use the bathroom. Some are there to keep warm. They just come and go. Some linger, but none have stuck with me like this guy I saw a few weeks ago.  

Curiosity got the best of me and I read it...

I don't know what this is, or even if its true, but I have to get it out there. 


September 5th


We were four rounds deep when someone made a toast to “earning it”. I grinned, clinked, and sat back down again to enjoy my overpriced seared scallops. Bob, my coworker, slapped my back and tightened his grip on my shoulder and shook me.


“Great fuckin job today bud, you really locked it in”, he said with a mouthful of Hors d'oeuvres.  
I plastered a grin on my face and saying “all for the team, bud” as I tightened my grip on my fork.


“Fifty fuckin million deal contract! The bonus we’re getting from this will cover my entire vacation, Jack, shit, you’re lookin at a promotion, man.” he let out a roaring laugh that cut through the restaurant’s subtle ambiance of jazz music and high-priced tailored suits.


A half second later, I managed to loosen my grip on my silverware and join in with the table in their polished laughter. I sat back down and starred at my plate, desperately hoping for this night to end. A song came on that elated our guests. I had never heard of it but claimed it as my favorite band. “Did you see them here in Boston last year?” a client asked.


“No I missed it” I said, playing along. “If I had the chance, I would’ve loved to be there”  
“I’ll get you tickets! They come next week, right here at TD Gardens. Bring the family. We’ll lock it in”. I smiled and thanked him. The song played on. I was already thinking of ways I could gracefully decline.  
The dinner finally ended. As my coworkers headed to the bar for a nightcap, I slipped out the door to take a walk. Any excuse to let my jaw rest.


I had made my way about a quarter mile down the street when I stopped at a bus shelter with a Navy ad. “U. S. NAVY. A GLOBAL FORCE FOR GOOD. ” A photo of young sailor dressed spiffy in his dress whites with a lone ribbon on his uniform stared back at me like a ghost.  
Did I ever look so hopeful?


I felt my back ache and took a seat took a seat on the bench. I remembered how easy it had been carrying a 70-pound kit up a 20-foot watchtower to relieve another hollowed eyed sailor shattered by the weight of a mission that never ended. I didn’t even realize how much weighed on me until I could taste that cold pistol barrel I had placed in my mouth. Flipping the safety off just before I chickened out.  
I shut my eyes. God, please give me something else. Let’s remember the good stuff. The jokes. The bullshit in the FOB. The time we roasted the new guy for getting caught jerking off in the head. Even the admiral’s suicide got turned into a punchline. That was our morbid version of therapy.

  
And now?


Now I laugh at shitty jokes. Playing the part. These civilians. .. would they have lasted even one night with us?


September 6th


I flew home the next day. I tried shaking off the anger. Instead, I found myself back in the office giving an uninspired debrief to my boss. I slipped out early, blaming my lack of enthusiasm on a headache.  
I didn’t go home. I needed a drink. I hit the Holland and drove to a bar I’d passed a hundred times. Tonight felt right.


I had been white knuckling the steering wheel since leaving the office. I had only noticed once I put the car in park. I sat for a moment and checked my phone for a missed call from Nina. Nothing. I had texted her earlier when I landed but have gotten no response.


I made my way inside, greeted by dim lights and a sticky floor that made my loafers croak. making My way past a sea of gaunt faces, I took a seat at the end of the counter. The place seemed packed for a Tuesday, although the only noise that could be heard was the middle-aged woman singing love songs on the karaoke machine to a pan dead audience.


I caught the bartender ordered a third drink. Tequila sunrise. I was stirring the grenadine before hearing the quick footsteps behind me. I spun my stool around to look, but the man was already sitting in the stool to my right.


“Not from around here, are you? ” he asked, speaking quietly in a southern accent, careful not to disrupt tuneless karaoke singer’s solo. He looked middle-aged and had leathery skin that looked almost pasted on.


“What would give you that idea? ” I shot back. The man smiled and looked down at his beer. “The twang in your voice” he muttered, “military? ”.


I knocked back the rest of my cocktail, “You always this nosey? ” I asked through the burning in my chest.  
“Nah, I just know a fellow vet when I see one. I could tell by how you walked in. ” The man hadn’t taken his eyes off his hand, still locked around his beer.


I motioned to the bartender for a fourth, then turned to face him. 


“Yeah. Navy. Eight years. ”  


“Well tell me, how does it feel trading in your neckerchief for that fancy tie there? ”  


“Like it’s choking me”, I chuckled.


“So, where are you from. ” He asked again.


I thanked the bartender as he handed me another cocktail. “I aint from nowhere. Just looking for a bit of peace”


“Your peace is dead and gone” he said in a mocking tone. He turned slowly and locked eyes with me for the first time. “You look like you’ve sold it already” this time under his breath before taking a sip of his beer. I let out an involuntary laugh before raising an eyebrow.


“Aint nothing worth that price” I said, finally noticing how plastered I was.

  
“That’s the first genuine thing you’ve said all day. ”


My eyes darted away from my drink and towards the man, but he was gone. Then I heard the front door close on his way out.


September 7th


The next day was a Saturday. I woke up to Nina cooking pancakes for Ben. I stumbled my way to the bathroom and spent some time trying to hawk up the taste of copper from the back of my throat. My stomach convulsed and I choked back vomit. The man from last night was still whispering in my skull. I couldn’t seem to stop my hand from shaking as I squeezed toothpaste all over the bowl of the sink.  
Nina’s back was turned when I walked into the kitchen. I greeted her with a half-hearted “good morning” that was met with silence. Ben was watching something on his phone while eating his breakfast. I came over and tussled his hair. I squeezed out a smile and tried my luck with him, “Good morning, bud”.  
“Good morning Dad. ” he said, then shoveled another bite of pancakes in his mouth.


I switched on the TV and let the morning news fill the silence. No plate was set out for me, so I got a coffee instead, moving closer to where Nina was busy cooking. “Have anything for me to do today? ” I asked in a cheery voice. She motioned to a shopping bag on the counter without looking up, “go return that stuff” she said curtly.


“Ok, let me just get something in my stomach. ” I grabbed a Pop Tart with my coffee and took a seat with Ben who was too sucked into his phone to pay attention. I ate slowly trying to keep it all down while waiting for Nina to join me, but she kept herself busy with housework. I finished my breakfast and threw on my Croc’s and grabbed the shopping bag and my keys. I passed Nina as she carried a load of laundry without even making eye contact.


Only the sound of my own heavy breathing accompanied me as I made my way down the stairs of my apartment complex. I found my car in the garage and cranked it on and quickly cranked up the car radio loud enough to drown out the suffocating silence.


I pulled into the Whole Foods parking lot and grabbed the bag of Nina’s ill-fitting clothes from the back seat. I walked slowly, trying to milk every second I could. While depositing my returns, my eye caught the flower stand. I tried to think – what was Nina’s favorite again? Hibiscus? I approached the display and looked through the tags before finding a small bouquet. I laid the flowers on the counter and was reaching for my debit card when Finn, the kid behind the counter, asked me if I wanted a card to go with it. I looked through the display and found a small generic card that had a heart on it. I put the pen to the stiff paper, but nothing came to mind. I thought for a second before writing “I Love You, Love Jack”. I stared it, noticing the emptiness that filled the rest of the paper around those five words. I thought about crossing it out. I didn’t. Instead, I tucked it into the flowers and walked back to my car.


I took the stairs slow up to my apartment. Nina was watching some Spanish soap opera while Ben laid by the couch, coloring. I approached her with my sullen grin and the flowers outstretched. “Got you something at the store”. She looked up in my direction, staring right through the flowers. She turned her attention to Ben “lets go to the park honey, go get your shoes on”. Excited, Ben shot up and ran to his room. Nina got up slowly. Deliberately looking in every direction but mine. “You don’t like them? ” I said in a quavering voice. She didn’t answer me until she was walking away “get them the fuck out of here”. Ben had his shoes on by now. I watched as they left the house, Nina made eye contact with me for the first time before I watched her slip out the door. I stood in the family room alone, holding the bouquet.


September 12th


Group therapy was on Thursday. It was something suggested by the VA doctor while I waited for a real one-on-one therapist. The waiting list was long for any type of mental health appointment, and this was the only thing they offered for the meantime. I arrived late to my appointment. I drove around the parking lot for a solid ten minutes before I found parking down the street and made my way up to the entrance.


When I walked in, they were already in full swing. I greeted everyone and took a seat in the semi-circle of chairs while I listened to Steve, one of the new guys dominate the group.


“And that’s when I just kind of felt, lost, you know? Like there wasn’t a place for me in my unit. My mom was going through her stuff and, I just couldn’t focus. My sergeant wasn’t having any of it. He made me scrub the latrines as a punishment for weeks. That’s when I just said, ‘fuck it’ and left. Went AWOL. I grabbed the first train back to Pennsylvania to go see my mom. It didn’t take long for them to find me. I should’ve waited until my third year for my mom to move to Tennessee before going. Maybe they’d have a harder time tracking me down. ”


“Third year? ” another participant piped out, finally breaking Steve’s monologue.


“Of my enlistment” Steve replied.


I shifted in my seat and tried with all my willpower to resist rolling my eyes out of my head. Two measly years? And he’s been in therapy for how long now? I looked around to try and meet eyes with anyone else who shared my disgust but came up empty.


Steve wrapped up his story. My turn was next.


“Alright Jack, last week you told us about…” the therapist checked his notes “your feelings of alienation, was it? Why don’t you tell us a little about your progress this week? ”.


I sat up in my chair and took a deep breath and cleared my throat “It’s been a good week, I guess. I closed a major deal at work, A-and I’ve been journaling like you said. It’s helped a bit”.


“That’s good to hear. Would you like to share some points of pain with us? ”


My mouth dried up. I tried swallowing, but it was no use “Uhh yeah uhm… I’ve been feeling… anxious? I don’t know how to describe it”. My stomach fell. My mind raced to find the words while I fought back any semblance of shame. “I’ve felt like my life has been teetering on a knifes edge. Like I could lose myself at any moment. I been feeling…alone…very alone. I’m having trouble connecting with…well… anyone”.


Steve laughed. “I know exactly how you feel Jack”. I glared in his direction, feeling myself looking past him to the wall just behind him as he went on. “Once, right after I was court marshaled, I visited a legion post down in Linden. I tried connecting to those guys, but they told me I never earned it. Like what the fuck? Didn’t we all sign the same contract? Luckily, I found this group. I truly feel like we’re all the same”.  


“Okay Steve” the therapist interrupted, preventing one of his twenty-minute stories from gaining traction. “And we’re all glad you’re here too”. How do you relate to that Jack? ”.


“I don’t”.


The room fell silent. Steve piped up “…you’ve never been to a Legion post before? ”


“No, because you’re a fucking pussy” I felt the dam break. Rage began to flood my eyeballs and all I could see was red.


“Hey man I was a god dam Marine! What do you know you squid!?”


I stood up, knocking my chair over and stormed over to Steve, lording over him, feeling like I could rip his head off in that moment. “I don’t care what you were. You were barely out of bootcamp while I was on the god dam wire. You think we don’t have families? You think we didn’t miss birthdays, Christmas’, first words, first steps, fucking funerals! ? You know what we call guys like you? Fuckin sick-bay warriors, soup fuckin sandwiches. You think I give a fuck you were a Marine? I should break your god dam neck calling me a squid. Every single person here has more of a reason to cry at group therapy. You’re the fuckin imposter here! ”.


I was out of breath. Steve sat in his chair with a look of shock and horror. I waited for someone to say something. I straightened my back and quickly walked back to my chair to grab my things and headed towards the door. That was my last session.


September 21st


I ghosted my way through the rest of the week, stuffing my emotions into a bottle while delivering half-hearted PowerPoint presentations. I barely spoke to Nina. I kissed my son on the forehead each night like I was clocking out of a shift. I stayed in the office a little later Friday, afraid at what another full weekend at home.


Saturday morning started off like most days off. Nina waking up before me and making Ben’s breakfast. I muttered “good morning” to her while passing the kitchen, not expecting a reply anymore, and sat down on the couch, flipping on the morning news and ignoring the tension.


“I have a couple errands for you to run today, Jack” she said with a sigh. “Could you please run these to the post office? It’s some of Ben’s clothes. They don’t fit. I need you to send them back”. She motioned to the stack of boxes on the counter, then to the door.


“Anything to get me out of the house huh? ” I kept my eyes fixed to the morning news.


She turned to face me “Don’t start. ”


“Start what? ” I faced her. Throwing down my preverbal gauntlet. The silence stretched the tension like a line holding an aircraft carrier to port.


“Nothing”.


“No say it” I said, refusing to let go. I wanted this. I needed this.


“Trust me, you don’t want me too” her forehead furrowed. She stood steadfast and resolute. Desperate to avoid what was to come.


I replied defiantly. “What do you mean by that? ”


In her last effort to stop the inevitable, she turned off the faucet on the sink and stood in the kitchen facing me. “Jack. Stop”.


That’s when I lost it.


“You need fucking therapy Nina” the statement’s absurdity was not lost on me. I knew she came from a real traditional family, where this statement is a marked sign of shame.


“That’s a joke coming from you! ” She slammed a pot with such force that in any other situation, I would’ve paused to assess the damage to the counter.


“No for real. You need fucking therapy. You think it’s easy trying to keep you happy? Whose decision was it to come here huh? Haven’t I done enough to make you happy? What the fuck is your problem? ”. I said as I rose up from the couch. Ben began to cry.


Nina went to Ben. “It was both of our decision you piece of shit. How dare you? Now you just walk around here like a fuckin ghost and expect me to smile? ”. She held Ben in her arms, trying her best to calm him down.


“No but fucking your husband would be a nice touch” I said, growing angrier as I saw her quick resignation.


“Nice Jack”.


“And going fucking grocery shopping for once. Or how about taking the kids to a god dam doctors visit. You think this has been easy for me? ”


“Poor you”.


“Oh for fucks sake”. I laid both hands on the counter. We had switched sides. I paced the kitchen like a lions cage. I laid both hands on the counter, feeling as if I could push right through it.


“You expect me to treat you like a man when you don’t know how to treat a woman? ”.


Silence. I glared at Nina. Then to Ben. A voice in my head to stop, but there was no stopping this.


“Fuck you, Nina. I should’ve left you at that dirty ass bar in Spain where I found you. Just like all those other desperate women looking for the next dumbass American”.


I didn’t yell it. I said it in almost a whisper. Through gritted teeth. Ben sobbed into her shoulder. She didn’t yell back. She just looked at me like I was already gone. I grabbed my keys and slammed the door.  
On the road, I thought about Ben before resigning my fate as a parent to an absent father. “Your peace is dead and gone”. His voice echoed as I was on my way to nowhere. At a light, I opened my phone and searched “ESCORTS NYC”.


I ended up off the side of the 495 that led straight into the Holland Tunnel. At a Super 8 motel that a man like me had no place to visit. I got out of the car, slipped my wedding ring into my wallet and looked up at the rows of rooms and the billboard that read “Travel safe! All rooms sanitized”. I checked the room number from my text messages a second time and crept up the stairs. 203. I knocked. She opened the door, hiding most of her body out of sight and asked me to leave the money on the counter.


November 23rd


I woke up to the smell of the sea carried by a cool breeze from the Hudson River. The morning sunrise illuminated the silhouette of the Manhattan skyline. It’s orange light casted behind the tall buildings dissipated into a purple sky. The air cut through the thick tree line and breezed through my camp on the New Jersey palisades, rattling the fixtures on my plywood abode loud enough to wake me up.  
Sharp pains throbbed in my temples from mistakes made the night before commanded immediate attention. Then memories. I had hoped they were only nightmares. I tried convincing myself they were. I fell into a fetal position, letting out a blood curling howl that echoed into the quite streets of Hoboken below.


Nicotine. That was my next thought. I rose up from my sleeping bag and tore the peacoat off a hook nailed to the plywood. I threw it on and began to frantically search the pockets. First the flap pockets to no avail then the coin pocket near the top. Nothing. I made my way to my sea bag. I littered my camp with pots, pans, spare medical supplies, canned food, until finally near the bottom of the sack, I found it. I took a long puff. I closed my eyes as I became lightheaded and exhaled a cloud of vapor and collapsed into my lawn chair near the firepit. I sat for a moment, feeling my headache slowly begin to fade. I sat up in my chair and rested my arms on my knees while I started to sort through the horror of the night prior.


“I killed that man” I said quietly. I said it again as if the words themselves would carry the weight of shame and regret I knew would be with me until my grave.


I felt the urge to cry but quickly suppressed it, knowing that if I had, I would not be able to stop. I made my way towards my clothesline snatched a pair of dirty jeans to cover up my naked lower half. Booze was the next thought to enter my mind. I found the ill-gotten crisp $50 bill in my peacoat pocket and, in a daze and with great difficulty, marched the steep palisade cliff to the fence line separating the vermin from the good folk of Union City. I finagled my way through an opening in the gate as a gape mouthed jogger passed by. I began heading towards 14th street, making the long trek into Hoboken.


I came out of the shop with a small bottle of 1800 tequila in hand and headed towards Sinatra Square. The park had a few people around. Tourists mostly. There was a group behind me taking photos with Frank Sinatra’s statue. Others were walking down the pier. A couple to my right held each other as they admired the sunrise.


I cried with my eyes closed while trying to numb my nerves. I waited for a police siren, but none came. Instead, what I heard was a familiar voice. A smooth Georgian southern drawl. I opened my eyes to see a middle-aged man in a bright yellow suite smiling down at me through a thick scraggly beard.


“You alright friend? ”


I composed myself enough to get a better look at him. His suit seemed to glow in the morning sunlight so bright that I had to squint to see his face. His eyes were gentle, and he had a half smile relayed a look of concern. I felt peace wash over my body like a shot of morphine and sat up. “What are you doing here? ”


“Same reason you’re here, to look at the sun rise” he said with a hearty chuckle. His grin widened as he turned and gestured with his hands towards the streaks of yellow reflecting off the skyscraper windows. “New day, new beginnings” he said as he let out a deep breath and took a seat next to me  


“I fucked up man. I fucked up bad” I said hanging my head, my voice cracking through every word as they hung in the air. The man in the yellow suit took a moment to respond.


“There aint nothing gods good grace can’t make whole again” he said in a gravely, subdued voice. Not one that carried reverence, but mockery. I turned my head to look at him. His eyes were focused on his lap as he rolled a cigarette.


“Thanks, but I’m no believer”. The man burst with laughter, slapping his knee and spilling tobacco on the ground beneath the bench. “You’re no believer? Then why the hell are you wailing here in front of all these good people? ” he stretched his arm out towards the crowd of people starting to gather at the park. I felt embarrassed until I noticed that not one person was paying any attention to us. “Aint nobody here gonna pay you no mind. I’ll tell you what you’re doin out here, your just tryin to get attention” he said sharply, “but aint nobody here give a fuck what you been through Jack, your just another loser to them. ” I felt my sorrow turn to anger, then rage. Rage directed at a world filled with plastic people, set up inside a fake dollhouse existence while I was tossed in the garbage. He finished his thought by saying “they aint your brothers. They sure as hell aint your keepers”. I’m not sure I understood the words then, but I felt them. “What’s your point old man? All this anger, all this sorrow, all this guilt, what do you suppose I do with it? Like you said, there aint a soul here that’s going to take it off my shoulders. Should I just fuckin put a bullet through my head and end it? !” I screamed. I may have been angry, but I meant what I said. I was looking for answers. For relief from my mental hell. He didn’t answer right away. Just lit his cigarette and blew smoke into the sunrise.


“C’mon, ” he finally said, standing. “Church don’t start ‘til nine. ”


I didn’t think. I didn’t argue. I just stood and followed. Because I had nowhere else to go.


I craned my neck to look up at the steeples of the cathedral. Its once pearly white façade had turned to gray, and every single one of its stained-glass windows were broken like a mouth full of chipped teeth. Three towering wooden doors loomed at the entrance, their crisscrossed iron bands like prison bars.  
A signpost read “UNION CITY REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT”. That sign had been there for as long as I could remember, but I had never seen a construction worker anywhere near this building. No scaffolding, no building material. Nothing. A monument to something lost and not properly buried, only left to rot. Why hadn’t they just knocked it down already?


The man handed me a padlock key and motioned towards the mundane chain link fence. The normally busy street grew still, and all I could hear was the fence rumbling like I was waking up a sleeping giant. My hand trembled as I tried fit the key. A sickening feeling hit me as if I shouldn’t be there.


My eyes fixated on the “NO TRESSPASSING” posted by the door, but I was drawn inside, as if the cathedral had been expecting me for a long time


Inside lay about a dozen rows of pews. Some intact, some with sections that were reduced to splinters. I imagined what the church might’ve looked like in the past. Pews filled with pious folk. A firebrand pasture preaching the gospel, telling his flock what God had expected of them. Had God expected this? His home reduced to a ruin?


I kicked up dust from the ground that tickled my nose as we made our way inside. It smelled of soot and ashes. As I walked forward through the middle of the pews, I could hear little else than the echoes of our footsteps. I moved closer to the alter and admired one fixture of the church, seemingly untouched by time - A life-sized statue of Jesus Christ with his arms stretched out. From a distance, his face was gentle. But up close, his eyes looked sullen, his smile faded. He seemed disappointed. I stepped closer. Not sure why. My hand moved without thinking, tracing the cool porcelain surface.  


I couldn’t help but admire its beauty, especially in the wreckage that surrounded it. How was this statue still standing? Other structures had disintegrated long ago. Reclaimed by the city that surrounded it. Two fires that hadn’t left even the slightest smudge of dirt or ash. Had the man been washing it? Before I had time to ask my companion about it, I had noticed another structure. One equally pristine and out of place.


Just behind the statue rested an alter. I had never seen anything like it. Instead of a typical one-piece solid supporting structure, this alter had legs. Long thin legs that came down to an almost needle like point piercing the ground like living flesh. The legs jutted out high above, curling up into a menacing arc. In the middle of the arcs rested a sigil. To this day I struggle to describe it. It was impressive, then foreboding. But this was just a church. Just an old building, right? Still, the instinct didn’t lie. Something was off. Paranoia must be playing tricks on me, I thought.


I spun around to ask about the strange alter to my old friend in the yellow suit about the peculiar alter, but he was no longer behind me. For a moment, I felt a profound sense of dread as my eyes darted around the cathedral looking for where he had gone, then subsided when I noticed him in one of the pews on his knees with his head bowed and hands clasped in front of him. The question vanished. I held the silence.


I couldn’t help but feel more awkward as the silence drifted in the air. I even felt guilty by interrupting the silence with the harsh tapping of my footsteps as I walked to the nearest pew and took a seat. I couldn’t tell you why I decided to join my new companion in silent prayer, but I hung my head and closed my eyes. Darkness. Only for a moment. Then a vision.


The smell hit me first. The soot and ash were replaced by a nauseating stench of fresh flowers and rotting fish. I immediately forced my eyes open. What I saw next still haunts me. The statue was gone. Only the alter remained, and a pair of hooves stood upright behind it. I forced my gaze up toward the sigil, still glowing, still watching. I could’ve sworn I heard it speak though I heard no words. I snapped back when I heard him laugh. “God’s house shouldn’t smell like a gutful of maggots!”. I turned to look behind me. “I’ve been doin my best here to clean this sucker up, but I can’t get rid of that dog gone smell”. I was silent for a moment. Did he see it too? I decided not to ask. “Listen man, I think this asbestos or some shit is giving me a headache. Let’s catch up later”. I couldn’t wait to get out of there.


I took my leave politely and headed out the doors. I needed air.
  

November 24th


I was $10 short of a handle of tequila. Luckily the Indian guy behind the counter would sometimes allow me to do work around the store to make up the difference. Last week was emptying the trash, this week it was sweeping the front. I grabbed the push broom and went to work pushing the loose dirt and leaves out of the way of the storefront.


I noticed a beater parking just down the road with some teenagers giving cash to a guy in the passenger seat who looked slightly more mature. The passenger got out and headed towards the store and I stepped aside and held the door open for him. He left shortly after with a cart full of beer and liquor and return to the teenagers waiting in the beater with smiles on their faces.


I continued my task while my mind drifted to memories of being young again. The good parts of at least. When success meant scoring liquor or drugs for another day of endless parties and friends.


I thought of Andrew. My friend of a by-gone era. I thought of how he made my old Thunderbird’s shocks cry as his fat ass got into my car. How we would tear up the streets, wasted, bumping our music for all to hear. Andrew never had gas money, but it never bothered me. I knew all he wanted was to get away from his family. Andrew had been that way since he was fourteen when his parents told him he was adopted, which put the beatings his dad gave him when he was younger a whole new context. Together, we just sort of drifted through our high school years, somehow avoiding getting arrested or seriously injured.  
I finished up my work and took my booze from the shop keeper and thanked him. I took my bottle to a quiet park and checked to see if Andrew’s number still worked. I hovered over his name in my phone, growing more excited at the prospect of talking to a friend who knew the old me. The person I was before the Navy’s hard lessons.


I hit the call and he answered. I was a little surprised he still had my number.  


“What’s up dog! Its been a while” he said. His laugh instantly put a smile on my face  


“Like over ten fuckin years man. How you been?”


We caught up and reminisced about the good days. He told me he had gotten his GED, then went to culinary school and was working as a chef. He’d done well for himself. Had a little place in Tarpon Springs, where he lived alone. Had a girlfriend too. I was happy for him.


“How’s your mom?” Andrew asked. The conversation took a melancholier turn.


“I wouldn’t know. Haven’t seen her since that night” I said, trying to hide the ugliness of the situation.


“She was a nice woman from what I remember. I still can’t believe things turned out that way”.


“Yeah, me neither. Hey, remember how we hotboxed my room that day? I never thanked you for staying with me. I was so gone; I barely remember calling the cops.” I said.


“You were half a ghost when the cops showed up. Just staring at the wall.” Andrew said flatly.  

“I keep seeing the knife on the floor. I can’t shake it.” I appreciated the fact I could finally talk about that day with the only other person who was there.


“You remember what happened before the cops came? ” Andrew said quietly. “Yeah. I came out of the room. I saw the blood. That’s when I called.”


“. .. You sure?” Andrew asked slowly, like he was confused at my answer “What do you mean, am I sure?”  
“I remember somebody being there when we showed up. Whispering to her. Calmed her down. Just… stood there while she dropped the knife.”


“Andrew, there wasn’t anybody there but us.” Now I was confused.

  
“There was. Tall guy. Yellow suit. I remember thinking he looked like someone out of a church painting. I thought you knew him.” I tensed up, feeling my heart drop clear through my stomach. I contained my panic and my urge to puke. “…I don’t remember that.”


“Maybe I was just high as hell. But I swear, I’ve never forgotten his voice. ” He said, not wanting to pursue it further. “Why are you saying this now?” I asked.


“I don’t know man. I still think about it sometimes. I always wondered if you knew the full story.”  
“…No. I guess I never did.”


“You okay, man?” a shift change occurred in the conversation. Andrew sounded concerned. “I don’t know.”


We said our goodbyes and hung up. I closed my eyes and relived every moment from that night.


I could hear Andrew’s sharp snorting through the bong hits and the heavy bass percussion of the hip hop. I remembered getting up to take a piss. I rose up slowly and secured my footing and started towards the door. I opened it, letting a plume of smoke out into my parent's hallway. Through my hazy vision I held onto both adjacent walls as I made my way towards the bathroom. I stared at my feet to make sure they were still on the ground when my eyes passed the bloody knife still resting on the kitchen floor. How could she do this? I rested my head against the wall and closed my eyes. The day’s events came flooding back. The car parked sideways in the driveway. The manic episode I witnessed walking inside my home. How dark it felt even though it was 2pm. finally, I remembered the cops taking her away. She left the house in handcuffs, calm and subdued. She was just a shell when she went into the police car.  
Two months later she was gone. She hung there on the bathroom door. On her knees, with a quiet look of horror painted on her face.


I had to go back to the cathedral.


By the time I got to the cathedral it was dark. I walked through the chain link fence and up to the double doors that guarded this unholy temple. I braced myself before shoving the doors open. I tried calling out for the man as I entered but realized I had never gotten his name. “Hey! ” was the next best option.  
The interior was dark. Almost pitch black. I could barely see anything. I looked towards the front of the church and noticed the moonlight reflecting off the Jesus statue responsible for the only light inside the building. I walked slowly, carefully sliding my feet across the floor as to not trip over anything or encounter an unaccounted-for step. I walked straight up the middle of the pews, calling out for the man in softer and softer tones as the silence enveloped the atmosphere. Which made what I heard next surreal enough to cause me to forget why I came.


A bleating goat. Coming from behind the statue.


This place was sick. Rotting. “Jack, this world aint meant for people like us. ” I heard next. It was the old man. “They chew us up and spit us out. You aint got no honor around here, you’re cursed. Look at yourself. Whatcha need to do is follow me. I can show you a place where none of this bullshit matters no more. ”


A voice in my head told me to leave, but it was weak and hollow. “Show me. Please. ” I whispered.  
I walked with the man in the yellow suit down a long staircase behind the alter, then another. As we descended, I couldn’t help but think how impossibly deep this cellar was. As we neared the bottom, the walls began to lose their beautiful carved molding and just became solid gray rock. Lights were strung up with a single wire, barely illuminating the steps. With every step I took deeper and deeper into the depths of the Hudson Valley palisades, the number I became.


“Your mother cut across her wrists” he said.


“Huh? ” his statement broke my trance, but not my pace.


“How did you know that? ”.


“She should’ve cut down. Everyone knows that’s truly how you do it. ”


It was true. He had been there. My heart tried to command my knees to stop climbing, but in that moment, my heart only wanted to continue.


“What did you say? ”


“Your mother. You sent her away, right? Did she ever come back once you called the law on her? ” He said, in his familiar twang that had returned, but I was hung up on the words he said.


“No…she didn’t. All the memories I had spent so much time learning to suppress opened like floodgates in a dam. I dropped to my hands and knees. I’m not sure how much time I spent there on that staircase with my eyes closed. I only remember opening them to see the man standing on the steps above me, kneeling and touching my shoulder. I raised to my feet, and like an automaton, walked with him down to the cellar until we reached a large door with the same insignia as the alter. Clarity returned for a moment. I told him not to open the door.


“It’ll be alright friend. Have faith. ”


He pushed. It opened. The darkness was great. It enveloped us in its embrace.


December 28th


I woke up in a gutter off fifth avenue with no idea of how I had gotten there. My legs laid outstretched into the sidewalk, causing early morning commuters to step over me. My body was scraped and bruised with some wounds forming scabs that I didn’t recognize. I rose up and tried to walk before feeling a shooting pain jolt up my spine from my left leg. I was shirtless, hungry, and afraid. I looked around hopelessly for my peacoat out of instinct before realizing I wasn’t cold at all. That’s when I noticed my hands, blackened with soot. The cathedral. What happened there? I had to go back to the Palisades. Back to my camp, or whatever was left of it.


I limped across midtown dragging my left leg behind me. My visible breath weaving around me like the commuters as I made my journey block by block until I reached the Port Authority. I made my way inside and up to the ticket machine and waited next a machine with a long line. I saw a man, half asleep, paying cash and asked him for his change. I became hopeful when he looked up at me, then shocked when his face contorted in a horrified expression as he grabbed his ticket and took off without saying a word. Confused, I chalked it up to my appearance. Nobody is in the mood for giving out charity when you look like some drug crazed fiend.


I gave up after a while. Not earning a single penny for my efforts. I had to clean myself up a bit. I made my way towards the men’s room. The silence struck me first. I had just weaved through hordes of people making their way to work just outside of the doors, but inside there was no line for the toilet. Nobody standing at the urinals. Just a faint drip of the tap in one of the sinks that lined the wall. I looked around for a reason but none were apparently obvious. I dragged myself to one of the sinks and began scrubbing the blackened dust off my hands. I stared down into the sink, cleaning my palms, each finger, and under my nails. As I scrubbed, I tried not to think about its origins until I felt a strange familiar presence. Then the water ran black. The mirror fogged over. The weight behind me came softly. No footsteps, not a sound. I broke my concentration from my hands and saw a cloven hoof standing next to me at the sink. I raised my head but can’t remember what I saw. Only the smell of flowers and rotting fish and a sense I was being watched that hasn’t left me since.


Since that night, I have woken up in strangers’ yards, hospital beds, jail cells, and once inside of a freight container traveling west across Pennsylvania. Always somewhere new. With new scrapes, bruises, and injuries. What does seem to stick is the soot covering my hands and the strange sensation that I’m being watched inside my own skull. I think it’s been a year since then but its useless for me to keep track of time. Every so often it’s a new city that chews me up and spits me out. The hours, months, or maybe even years between are lost to me. Like a giant ink blot on my memory. Sometimes I catch my reflection and notice my beard has grown inches since last time. He’s almost done with me, I think, but I continue to dream through his eyes.
