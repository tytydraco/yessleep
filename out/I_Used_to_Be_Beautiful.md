When my face started peeling, I thought it was the new face wash I had recently bought. My friend recommended it, and it was rated 10.0 on the best of lists on several websites.

I was disappointed because the few times I used it, I really liked it, but I couldn’t chance it.

I threw the cleanser in the trash.

Two days later, my face was still peeling, and it was much worse. It was so dry, the texture akin to snakeskin. I racked my mind for a possible cause but couldn’t think of any.

Not only did it look disgusting, but it itched like absolute hell. I found myself scratching absentmindedly.

I scratched so hard that I drew blood. I only noticed when I glimpsed my red fingertips. My nail beds were clogged with chunks of skin.

I finally realized that something was very wrong when I went to get my hair done.

I went to my stylist to get my standard summer box braids. When she was done, she dipped my braids into a boiling pot of water and carefully wrapped my hair in a towel so I wouldn’t get burned.

When she took the towel away, she gasped, and my heart thumped painfully.

“What’s wrong?” I asked, but she didn’t answer.

I snatched her mirror off the table and peered at my reflection.

I screamed.

Every braid had come out of my head. Some clung to my scalp hanging by bloody, viscous threads.

 I watched as a trail of dark blood slowly dripped from my skull and trickled down my nose.

I slammed down the mirror and ran outside to my car. I blocked the stylist as she repeatedly called me to ask for payment.

By the time I got home, all of my hair was gone--every single strand and most, if not all, of my scalp.

My skin fell off in long bloody strips. My face formed boils that burst and spurted foul yellow pus. My eyes which have always been my best feature, were now wet with thick mucous and yellow, like the eyes of a reptile.

I looked into those eyes. My once beautiful eyes and

I remembered.

It was a memory I had tossed aside because I didn’t deem it important to remember.

My cousin’s birthday was a week ago. She had always been into that mystic, spooky bullshit.

The woman she hired referred to herself as a spiritualist. She told us we were going to host a seance. She ignored my laugh and the roll of my eyes.

We lit red candles and turned off the lights, and then we sat in a circle and held hands.

The Spiritualist chanted a name. I remember how uneasy the name made me feel. When I opened my eyes, the woman was staring right into my eyes.

I was unnerved, but I wouldn’t show it. I had drank quite a bit, and it annoyed me that I had to sit through this shit.

She kept looking at me, and I refused to back down.

And then she smiled, and my vision went completely black.

I heard screams, and I felt flames lick at every part of my body.

I tried to scream, but my mouth was sewn shut. My skin turned black and peeled.

I saw her then.

She had her back turned to me. She was tall and thin and had the most beautiful black hair I had ever seen.

She looked at me, and this time I did scream. My fear forced me to wrench my mouth open. I didn’t even register the pain.

She had no face, and what skin clung to it mottled her blue, black, and gray.

She lurched towards me and tapped my forehead with a gnarled, bloated finger.

She caressed the contours of my cheeks, encircled the hollows of my eyes, and traced patterns on my lips.

She gripped the underside of my jaw, and with a surprising strength, she sank her fingers into my flesh and tore off the entirety of my face.

The world burned, and I screamed again. I never thought it possible to scream without lips.

She fit my face over that empty canvas of hers. She smiled at me, and I drained away.

Hell was here for me, and my body sank into its fires. I smelled burning; I heard screaming. I

I awoke on the floor, dripping wet and reeking of alcohol. My cousin and her friends surrounded me. They looked confused and concerned.

“What happened?” I asked, snatching the towel offered to me.

My cousin told me that I had fallen and then started screaming. They didn’t know what to do, so she, my cousin, threw a glass of water on me.
“Where the fuck is she?” I spat. I took out my compact mirror and vigorously checked my flawless reflection.

“Where is who?” My cousin asked.

“That bitch,” I said. “That spiritualist! She did this. She did something to me.”

My cousin looked at me as though I were crazy.

“There was no spiritualist here, Bree.” She gestured to her friends. “Just us.” She peered at me. “Are you sure you’re okay? I think you might have drank too much.”

I pushed past her to grab another glass of wine.

“No, the problem is I haven’t drunk enough.”

So, I drank more, and I forgot. I forced myself to forget.

I don’t believe in the supernatural, at least I never used to, but now, as I was losing everything, I believed. 

I believed some demon bitch had taken my face and given me hers.

Every time I looked at my reflection, I cried.

What else did I have if I was no longer beautiful? I was not known for kindness. My personality did not win me friends.

I have always been an indescribable beauty. The kind of beauty that countries go to war over. And now I was a monster because that bitch had stolen my fucking face. I didn’t know what to do anymore, so I cried.

My tears burned and made holes in my skin.

I’ve been holed up in my bathroom for days now. I broke my mirror with my fist and shattered it with my brittle bones.

There are shards everywhere--reflections of me. I can’t escape it. I can’t run from myself.

I give up. To whatever took my face, congrats! You win!

I no longer want to see what I look like. I am tired of seeing my soul reflected at me.

I thought I would be able to see her. I wanted her to appear. If I saw her, I would reach out and tear off MY face. I would take back what was mine.

She doesn’t appear, though, and why would she? She’s gotten everything she wanted, and I don’t have much time left.

I am so tired. I’ll close my eyes and rest for a moment.

I just want to sleep because if I sleep, then perhaps I will dream, and I will get lost in the memory of my beauty.
