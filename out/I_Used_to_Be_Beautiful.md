When my face started peeling, I thought it was the new face wash I had recently bought.

My friend recommended it, and it was rated 10.0 on the best of lists on several websites.

I was disappointed because the few times I used it, I really liked it, but I couldn’t chance it.

I threw the cleanser in the trash.

Two days later, my face was still peeling, and it was much worse. It was so dry, the texture akin to snakeskin.

I racked my mind for the possible cause, but couldn’t think of any.

Not only did it look disgusting but it itched like absolute hell.

I found myself scratching absentmindedly.

I scratched so hard that I drew blood. I only noticed when I glimpsed my red fingertips. My nail-beds were clogged with strips of skin.

I finally realized that something was wrong when I went to get my hair done.

I went to my stylist to get my standard summer box braids.

When she was done, she dipped my braids into a boiling pot of water and carefully wrapped my hair in a towel so I wouldn’t get burned.

When she took the towel away, she gasped, and my heart thumped painfully.

“What’s wrong?” I asked, but she didn’t answer.

I snatched her mirror off the table and peered at my reflection.

I screamed.

Every braid had come out of my head.

Some clung to my scalp hanging on by bloody, viscous threads.

 A trail of dark blood ran down my skull, and I felt and watched as it trickled slowly down the bridge of my nose. 

I slammed the mirror down and ran outside to my car. I blocked the stylist as she repeatedly called me to ask for payment.

It was only when I was halfway home that I cried.

By the time I got home, all of my hair was gone—every single strand and most, if not all, of my scalp.

My skin fell off in long bloody strips. My face formed boils that burst and spurted foul yellow pus.

My eyes have always been my best feature. They were my favorite part of me.

And now they were wet with thick mucous and yellow like the eyes of a reptile.

Every time I looked at my reflection, I cried.

What else did I have if I was no longer beautiful?

 I was not known for kindness. My personality did not win me friends.

I have always been an indescribable beauty. The kind of beauty that countries go to war over.

I don’t look like myself anymore. Hell, I vaguely pass as a human.

I’ve been holed up in my bathroom for days. I broke the mirror with my fist and shattered it along with my bones.

There are shards everywhere. Reflections of me.

I can’t escape it. I can’t run from myself.

I give up. To the Goddess or God that has cursed me, you win.

I just have one request.

I ask that you take what I love the most. I beg you to take my eyes.

I no longer want to see what I look like. I’m tired of my soul’s reflection staring at me.

I want to be able to imagine what I used to be.

I want to get lost in the memory of my beauty. I never want to forget it.
