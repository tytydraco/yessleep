  

Ik that most people wont be reading this whole cuz I wrote so much but for those few who do read this, can you reassure me that im just being paranoid.

Okay so Im probably just being paranoid and overthinking (that’s the kind of person I am, cant help it) but can my house actually be haunted. So the house we live in rn was constructed like 4-5 years ago, our former house was at same spot but we broke it down and rebuilt it. Welp our grandparents and uncle’s family lived here after it was rebuilt while me and my family lived in a different place. So there was a addition to the number of floors recently and we moved onto the 1st floor like 2 months ago and I feel like there might be something wrong here. Lemme list some of the instances that made me feel this way  
 

1) Even before the construction of 1st floor, when it only had one ground floor, there was this one instance when my father was all alone in the house, that’s when he heard something that sounded like ankle bracelet, as if someone wearing one was walking from one of the rooms (the room that’s used to pray to god). My father is a very sensible and unwavering man and not many things can spook him. Well that was it about this story ig, there was no one there when he checked the room.  
   
 

2) This incident happened with me. This happened when the construction of 1st floor was still going on and we hadn’t moved in yet, it was around 7 pm when my grandma thought she heard doors shutting on 1st floor and asked me check it, ofc me being a scaredy cat was afraid but agreed. So right when I got upstairs, the moment I stepped on the floor, I heard this voice, as if someone took a loud but quick breathe right next to me and there was absolutely no one there, I just ran back down and shut all doors incase it was some burglar.

3) So this happened just yesterday, to my aunt actually. She was studying in the guest room while laying on bed when she felt as if someone tightly holded her legs, she ofc was startled but thought it would be our grandpa playing pranks but when she turned, there was no one there and our grandma was asleep in a different room. This happened on ground floor.  Also my uncle sometimes feels as of someone were touching his feet or just stood in front of him and watched him sleep in that same room.
   
 

4) lemme list some small things too like me and my father heard some stuff falling on our 1st floor, we don’t know what fell or where did it fall (we don’t have any mices or insects at all) this happened like 2 weeks ago. There was this one time when a plate was placed on a closed gas stove, I placed it like 20 mins ago but when my mum checked it out, it was broken from all sides except for centre (this happened last week). Okay so the plate was pretty old and maybe the temperature caused it to crack ig?? A couple of days ago, I thought I heard someone knocking on my room’s door twice at midnight time then again that might be my paranoia plus I was listening to joji on speaker so it might be the music. 

AND TODAY, I was using my laptop in one of my empty rooms (we have quite a few since it’s a big house) recording something on my laptop with my camera on, that’s when the door right in front of me suddenly slammed completely out of nowhere, and at the same moment a door at the other side of the floor was also closing but slowing, both door face OPPOSITE direction. My mom said it must have been the wind but how can the doors shut in different directions if it was wind tho. When I checked the recording on my laptop, I genuinely seemed so terrified, my reaction just said it all. This made me question if there might be something in here. Everything might actually just be coincidence with valid explanations idk but this seems one too many times to be just coincidence to me. Im soo afraid at nights rn, I have had a lot of sleep paralysis and insomnia troubles and the experiences are horrifying so I get spooked easily

Also our neighboring house’s kinda famous for paranormal stuff happening, my uncle and grandparents had rented that particular house when our own was getting rebuilt. 

My parents moved in here 2 months ago, I returned back home after my exams were over like 4 weeks ago but idk why but im always at unease, it’s as if im hypersensitive about everything around me for no reason, like if I were to pass by a room then ill make sure to recheck twice to confirm that’s nothing’s in there or check every corner of any room before settling in. istg I was never like this, I used to be rather carefree before moving in here, the place we lived before this was in a place that’s very uhhh like old area. Old houses with low density, full of trees, ponds, It was the green area of my town yet I never felt this uncomfortable there. On the contrary, our new home is in a very urban area, full of people yet there is not one minute of peace in here. Also our family is very religious so they all just discard everything as god’s doing but im genuinely concerned.    
 

so for those who read all of this, should I be worried about something or is this just me being paranoid
