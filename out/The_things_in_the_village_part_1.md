I remember when I first arrived to this village I only saw ruins and ash for a mile an awful smell of decay filled the air as I stepped out of my car my friend, mark called out from behind

 "Hey! Daniel why are we stopping"

"the engine seems busted!"

| shouted back, I had never been good with mechanics so I didn't know how to fix my now non-functioning car and neither did mark. I check my phone, no service 

“great" 
I muttered to myself, I looked back at mark but he was gone then I got an eerie feeling of dread then I heard mark shout
"hey come look at this" 
as I walked towards the direction of his voice | stepped back as a shriek came from a distance I covered my ears but i couldn't drown out the high pitched sound then felt a hand on my shoulder, I jumped back
 
“whoa mate didn't mean to scare you" 

It was mark
 "Jesus Christ are you trying to give me a heart attack?!" 
"Maybe" mark jokingly said
"did you not hear that scream?" 
| asked mark who was now staring at one of the many ruins of a home that used to be habitable "what scream?, I didn't hear anything"
 "never mind" I said shaking it off as my imagination playing tricks on me
The sun was starting to set and we weren't making any progress on the car situation 
"hey don't move" 
mark whispered 
 "what?Why?" 
| whisper back 
" when I tell you to run, run" 
I didn't understand but I wasn't going to not trust him
"RUN!" 
Mark yelled we both darted for his car as I hurriedly closed the passenger side door, mark already in the drivers seat something slammed itself on the door. The front headlights shined on a dark figure on all fours as it started to circle the car the it slams itself on marks driver door, that wasn't a very pleasant night as the creature outside never left. We passed out as me and mark are awoken by a tap on the window...
 "hello there young lads" 
a woman said she looked like a grandma but she seems friendly at least friendly enough. I went to wake up mark to let him know it’s morning but he wasn’t in the drivers seat “where did this idiot go now” I said talking to myself, I exited the car to greet the old lady “hello ma’am have you seen my friend by any chance he was in the-“ I get cutoff
 “yes he’s over at the diner”

she pointed, I turned to see where she was talking about and there it was a wooden building not just one but over 20 buildings and homes almost as this place has been here all along 
“thanks ma’am” I said thanking the old lady
 “please call me Eva” 
she happily exclaimed 
“thanks Eva” 
I walked over to the diner and inside I could see 9 tables all filled with someone seated I see mark drinking a cup of coffee 
“mark”
 “hey Daniel sit “
 I sit in the empty chair next to him
 “would you like to order something to eat or drink“ 
the man behind counter asks his name tag reading “Roy” 
“yes I would like a cup of coffee”
 he nods and walks off into the back I turn to mark and ask 
“when did you leave the car?”
 “Near morning the sun was just rising an-“ 
he gets cutoff by a man frantically running into the diner bashing through the doors
 “DUCK!!”
 He yelled and nobody hesitated to comply as an ear piercing shriek can be heard close by, mugs and cups falls,plates shatter into pieces on impact but everyone stays down, screams can be heard in the distance but are silenced just as quick as they began,but no one looks up I close my eyes as the diner doors can heard bashing open and the voices started 

“look up please I beg of you to look up” 

a girl says and everything goes quiet for a second and a ear piercing shriek shatters the silence but no one looks up except for one unlucky soul I assumes as a woman screams but is silenced as quick but now the sound of an objects piercing one’s flesh is heard and a liquid drips to the ground, bones crack an break but everyone’s stays down not daring to face the monster in the diner the diners doors can be heard opening and closing I stay down 

“it’s okay we may look now”

 I hear a familiar voice say it’s the waiter, Roy I look up and to the wall fresh blood now covering most of it same with the floor beside it.
