I work for a government you probably haven't heard of, see the higher ups do a very good job of keeping our work out of public knowledge. After all, people tend to fear what they can't yet understand.

Now I know you have questions, people always have questions.
So before we begin, I'd like to address one of those questions. 

How the hell you can trust me?  

Let’s start with just a simple yes or no, have you ever seen something that you swear you saw but… no one else believed you? Maybe it was a shadow, maybe it was a voice, maybe it was a creature that deep down you know shouldn't exist. Well, that's what we do.

I don't have all the answers, but what I can tell you, is that we create and study “anomalies” now, I don't like to use the word anomalies, I much prefer the word subjects… but for simplicity reasons, let's stick with anomalies for now.

We “create” these anomalies, and study them. Of course, sometimes these anomalies escape containment, and that's what I do for a living. I hunt down what the higher ups call ‘jailbreakers.’ Every now and then, we find them within a few days, but as always, occasionally one slips off the radar.

Now, normally when a member of the public encounters one of these anomalies, we offer them a large sum of money to keep their mouths shut, and in exchange, we’ll ensure they are kept safe… and alive.

Unfortunately, every now and then, someone decides to speak. It's also part of my job to hunt these people down and… well you can probably guess the rest.
I won't lie, I've done some things that I'm not too proud of. It's one of the major downsides to this kind of job.

Now, in order to prevent information leaks, only the highest officials know everything there is to know. Many of us just get told the bare minimum, just enough to do our jobs and go home. That's why I don't have all the answers you might be looking for, I only work on the surface, the truth is I’ve never even been into the deeper levels of the dive - oh and, I forgot to mention. Generally, headquarters is referred to depending on what level it is… levels 1-5 are called ‘the opening.’ Below that, levels 6-10 are referred to as the ‘middle of hell,’ and you can only guess what that means. Finally… Levels 10-20 are known as ‘the dive,’ and in all honesty, the deepest I've been is level 15.

For the majority of my work, I work on floors 6-10. That's where most of the anomalies are held. I do my rounds, make sure everything is where it should be, and on the off chance it's not, it's my job to fix it.

Every now and then, we get a call from below… one of the more dangerous anomalies has gone missing, and it’s our task to track it down. Anyway, the job is pretty easy - when a member of the public encounters an escaped anomaly, they're usually pretty quick to tell people… of course, no one else believes them but when you know what you're looking for, witness accounts are exactly what you need.

Of course… this story wouldn't be here if there wasn't a problem. See, recently we did get one of those calls, a few men in the dive discovered subject 1064 missing. After the entire building was searched, we had no choice but to wait.

Eventually, witness accounts did crop up a few miles west of HQ, people claiming to see a tall wheezing monstrosity, most accounts described it as a humanoid shape with the limbs bent and twisted at odd angles, the lips peeled back into a snarl and most said they heard it speak to them.

We followed up on every single account one by one, and whilst we found clues that subject 1064 had been there, we searched for months on end to no avail. Eventually the witness accounts stopped coming in altogether, and it seemed like subject 1064 had just vanished.

Part of me was relieved, but one night, I came home from work. I settled down for the night, and I must've fell asleep on the sofa, but I woke up to a horrible sound in my ear, something wet dripping down onto my face and a warm breath on my neck.

I wanted to scream, but I knew that only made things worse. Subject 1064 only attacked people when loud noises were present - such as screaming, but I had no idea how it found me.
Before I had a chance to update HQ or escort the subject back, it was gone.

We still haven't found it, but I know it's been following me. I've updated HQ on my situation, and they said they'd look into it but every night, I hear it's breathing, and every morning, a little piece of me wonders… what are they doing to people down there?
