I won't bother you with too many background details. I'll try to get to the main scene as fast as possible. 

So, there was this guy, lets call him jack for simplicity(I'm pretty sure he was nameless). Basically he, and a group of a few more guys did something to anger the local authorities, so they were kidnapped and tortured. 

Before I continue this, I would just like to clarify I didn't see the events through Jack's eyes, but through a third party perspective. No one noticed me though, so I wasn't a character in this dream, just a spectator.

This was the last in a series of tortures, however I don't recall any of the other tortures for the simple reason they're nothing compared to this last one.

In a circle of chairs, Jack and the rest of the victims were seated and roped to chairs,  they were also naked. Around them there were strange, weird, nightmarish (literally) creatures, whom I'll refer to as demons (my dream didn't give them an origin or a name). In the next paragraph, I will attempt to describe demons in detail.

They were humanoid, they seemed to have been genetically manipulated/cursed to be this way. I'm pretty sure they had no arms. They were long legged. They were covered in blood. Their most distinct feature was their head, or lack there of, instead they had a sack of testicles where that's supposed to be.

Now for the torture itself. I'd be lying I said I understand what happened or if it made sense, but I will attempt to describe it in detail. The demons did something that was bizarre to say the least. Their method of torture wasn't to stab the victims or break their their fingers, they just sat on the victims. Each demon just sat on a victim and than moved on to sit to the next (i would like to remind that the men are naked, so i think this might be considered rape). This doesnt that bad, and yet, the victims just screemed like crazy, not of fear, but of pain.

After an unknown amount of time of this thing, you could see piles of dead demons in the background of the room and most of the victims in the room were gone. 

More time passes, now all the victims are gone and all the demons are just laid on piles, the demons seemed to have died. 
The torture seemed to have deformed Jack significantly. His head is gone, his stomach is sunken in as if he's starved, he has holes around his body. Even though his body has extreme injuries, those injuries had no blood on them. 

Jack stands up, with his new, interesting appearance, and then I wake up.

The story on paper, wasn't scary. This is one of those things you have to see in order to exprience well. Because it wasn't real, but at that moment, it damn was.

But the thing that truly horrified me, only happened after the dream. I woke up and thought to myself "man what kind of deranged and insane guy would come up with something like that?". I seemed to have thought I watched a movie or something, but than I realized it wasn't a movie. After I realized it was a dream I thought about my question, only to realize who's brain came up with it.
