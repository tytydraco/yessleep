I was senior in polytech university. Before I start my story real true story let me give you a little background. I was born and raised in a family that goes to church every sunday. Never missed a day. Sunday no one was allowed to make a plan to go out. I do believe in Jesus and one and only God but attending church every sunday? sometimes you can miss one or two days relaxed kind of a person. now here is my story...

During my last year of university only left with final test / project before graduating. I was preparing for real working life. i lived in a small apartment with one room and fairly big livingroom. i used that bedroom as my walkin closet and livingroom as my bedroom/computer room. I was living my single college student life like anyone else. few days before my finals, i was studying day and both night. In my apartment theres a sensor ceiling light in a dark hallway right infront of the front door. never had it light up when no one was there. during nighttime study where all the lights were off except my desk lamp. concentrated like a mofo studying my ass off all sudden from far side of my eyes i see light turning on. it was the sensor light going on where no one there. 

"what the... fuck..? man i must be tired or something.." that was first thought that came to my mind as it was unexplainable. that was only the first day...

second day same shit happened and third day same but it never occur to me that maybe there is something there that i can not see. maybe something was watching me. the only thing that i was so focused on was that i need to get good grade for my finals. 

before i coontinue. i didnt go to church for maybe 2 months since my parents were not there to drag me to church. i was out partying or hanging out with friends lol. 

on my 4th day.. when that sensor light came on again.. i saw something.. you see the sensor light was LED. its really bright.. if it goes on theres practically no shadow.. but that night that 4th night there was a black figure peeking from the corner... like 7 year old height black figure.. peeking.. I was scared.. by the unexplanable thing.. could not take my eyes off of it until that light when off.. 

"now im imagining things like that? fuck.. im dead ass tired.."

6th day was my finals so on 5th i decided to take a rest and just relax for the finals so i went to sleep around 10. now here comes that main event...

on 5th day 10pm... i was on my bed sleeping like a baby. never in my life wake up in the middle of the night for drink or washroom, that night middle of the night my eyes just opened.. but unable to move not even my head so i thought what the fuck... whats going on.. i need good night sleep for my finals and this is what i get.. and alsudden side of my eyes i see that sensor light go on... and this tall black figure walking towards me slowly.. i didnt know what to do.. or what was going on.. only thing i can do was pray.. pray that itll all be just a dream.. so i closed my eyes and started to pray.. even though my eyes were closed i can feel that the sensor light just turned off so stupid as i am thought it was over... wrong.. i opened my eyes and there right in front of my face.. there was this big red blood shot eyes.. with huge smiling lips with sharp cringe like teeth dripping spit... i wanted to scream get the fuck off my face demon! but i couldnt... only in my head i said those words and yet this thing... said...

"get out of your face demon? i just got here heheh... i wanted to play with you since you dont go to church anymore why no be friends ?"

as soon as i heard that i fucking prayed.. i said god please.. i will never miss church days i will always go to church no matter what.. please i learned my lesson..
