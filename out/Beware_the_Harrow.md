I’m not a storyteller, which is fine, because this isn’t a story.  It’s an account of what happened to me and my best friend three years ago.  I’m writing it down now because therapy and medication hasn’t helped me much.  Maybe if I was honest with my therapist about what really happened it would be more effective, but  I think they’d just think I was lying or crazy.

 

So I’ll write my confessions here.  I might delete it when I’m done, but I doubt it.  It’s not a real confession if no one hears it.  Instead, I’ll post it somewhere on the internet anonymously.  People won’t believe it, but that’s on them, right?  And maybe it’ll finally be enough.

 

\*\*\*\*

 

I didn’t know what was in that house before I convinced Marcy we should go there.  I swear to God I didn’t.  Sure, we’d both heard stories about it.  Someone died there, maybe killed, maybe killed themselves, and maybe it was “haunted”.  But it was small town, kid bullshit “haunted”.  There were probably a dozen places across the county with stories like it attached to them, and even growing up we hadn’t really believed there was anything in any of those places beyond some mice and maybe a raccoon or snake.  The stories were told by parents to entertain and warn us away from dangerous abandoned places, and they were passed between us kids for much the same reasons—the idea of something dark and magical and dangerous was appealing, even if we didn’t believe it in our heart of hearts.

 

By the time Marcy and I were home for Christmas break on our senior year of college, you’d think we would have outgrown some of that.  But being back together always set us back a few years, and this was our last Christmas where the routine of college and coming home for the holidays guaranteed us a week together again.  There was a bit of unspoken desperation between us—the shadowy fear that, after fully entering the adult world, we might grow apart.

 

Maybe that fear is what pushed me to go to the house—to see if I could still convince her to do stupid stuff and have fun in the process.  And maybe that’s why she said yes, because like me, she was afraid of losing what we had.  Either way, it only took me a few minutes of talking it up on a boring Thursday night before we got into my truck and headed toward where the house sat crouched at the edge of town.

 

The house had no name, no grand history that we knew about other than the shabby stories of possible deaths and ghosts.  It was a large house, built in what some people call Victorian, but it was really just a mishmash of curves and straight edges and styles, with a big wrap-around porch rows of narrow windows on the upper floors that somehow reminded me of the gillslits on a shark.

 

At one time it been white, but that night it looked a sullen grey that seemed to softly glow in the sliver of moonlight we had to see by.  It was like some bioluminescent mushroom that had grown up from the guts of some deep cave instead of having been built and lived in by people.

 

I remember shaking my head as we stood out at the road, wondering where all these strange thoughts were coming from.  Sharks and fungus and…Marcy was already walking up the overgrown driveway.

 

“What’re you doing?”  I hissed the words at a whisper, though we were at least half a mile from the next house, and no one was going to care about us poking around there anyway.

 

She looked back at me with a smirk.  “You’re the one that wanted to do this, pussy.  Let’s get in there and bust those ghosts.”

 

I felt my heart speed up slightly as I forced myself forward with a grimace.  “Fine, hotshot.  Let’s see how you do when we get in there and a bat attacks your ass.”

 

She was terrified of bats, and I knew it, and she knew I knew it.  Using her middle finger, she blew me a kiss as she reached the bottom of the porch steps.  “Whatever.  You see a bat coming, I expect you to take the hit for me.  I’m not getting rabies on…”  Her smile faded as she turned to look up at the house and then back to me.

 

“What’s wrong?”

 

She shook her head.  “I…I don’t know.  It just feels weird.”   Stepping up onto the porch, she paused for a moment before beckoning me to come up where she was.  I did, and as soon as I started stepping onto the porch, I knew what she meant. 

 

It wasn’t a specific sense of something—not a smell or a sound or whatever.  It wasn’t even tied to a particular sensation or emotion other than some sense of alertness and fear that wasn’t there before, like an antelope that raises its head nervously, knowing danger is near without understanding more.

 

It was more the absence of a thing, an unnatural stillness.  I’d call it a void, but that doesn’t seem right, because part of the problem is the sense that the place wasn’t empty.  Just *almost* empty.

 

I know hearing this, you’d think there’s no way we’d go further, right?  We’d run back to my truck and go.  Except everything I’m describing now is my interpretation years later, based off of memory and hindsight.  At the time…I don’t know.  Maybe it was us being stupid, or too cynical, or not wanting to look scared in front of the other one.  Maybe we were being drawn in.  All I know for sure is that when I met Marcy’s eyes and nodded that I felt it too, neither of us mentioned leaving.  Instead, we just held hands and walked up to the front door.

 

The door was made of thick wood, strips of faded red paint running down and pooling its color around a rusty brass latch handle that I felt myself hoping would be locked.  But of course not.  The latch pushed down with the slightest press of my thumb, and when I pulled on the door, it opened easily with a soft, dusty squeal.

 

“Is this trespassing?  Is this a crime?”

 

I looked over to see a mixture of worry, hope and fear on Marcy’s face.  She wanted me to say yes as much as I’d wanted the door to be locked.  Instead, I shrugged.  “I mean, we don’t have permission, but who’s property is it?  No one lives here or keeps it up.  Does it count as trespassing when it’s abandoned?  Maybe technically, but…”  I left it hanging, waiting for her to pick up the thread.  I honestly think if she’d bit just then, I’d have left.  Instead, her shoulders slumped a little and she gave a shrug. 

 

“Yeah.  I don’t know.  I guess let’s get this over with.”   Getting out her flashlight, she shined it inside, lighting up a long, empty entry hall with doors along both sides.  Tightening her grip on my hand, she pulled me inside.

 

The hall gave me some hope at first.  It wasn’t clean—there were thick layers of dust and dirt everywhere—but there was no junk, no signs of disrepair, not even dead bugs or mouse droppings that I could see.  Marcy noticed it too and poked me in the side.

 

“Isn’t this weird?”

 

I glanced at her and then back to the roving pool of light from my own flashlight.  “What?”

 

“It’s so *clean*.  I mean, not clean, but empty.  How isn’t there any trash or roaches or whatever?”

 

I shrugged.  “Yeah, I don’t know.  Maybe there are further in.”

 

She snorted.  “Yaaay.”  Shining her light to the right, we headed into the first doorway.  It was immediately clear that it wasn’t empty but that it wasn’t junked either—it was full dusty furniture that seemed to be in good condition, except…

 

Everything was upside down.

 

The table, the chairs, the sideboard, even the oriental rug in the center of the room that much of the other furniture rested on, had all been flipped upside down.  And not in some jumbled pile, but with everything pretty much in the same positions they’d be if they were right side up.  It was so odd that I found it disorienting, my mind trying to reconcile what I was seeing while coming up with some explanation for why it would be like that.

 

“Why is it like this?”  I heard an uncertain tremor in Marcy’s voice. 

 

I shook my head.  “I don’t know.  I mean the furniture is kind of weird, but why do the rug like that too?”

 

I saw her nod out of the corner of my eye as she started backing up.  “Let’s try a different room, okay?”

 

I didn’t argue as we passed back into the hall and across to the other side.

 

This room was empty too, except for two dark blotches—one was on the carpet near the far wall, while the other was a few feet over on the wall itself and going down into the carpet below.  “Jesus.  Do you think those are blood stains?”

 

Marcy nodded.  “Maybe?  It could be something else.  Rust or water damage or something, but nothing really seems in bad shape.”  She glanced back behind us to the other room.  “Are we done or do we look around more?”

 

My tongue felt dry in my mouth.  “Um, maybe we go down the hall to one more room and then head out.  Sound good?”

 

She gave me a nervous smile.  “Sure.  Let’s just hurry.”

 

We stuck to the left side of the hall, and this time we found what had once probably been a normal living room.  It had a sofa, a recliner and a couple of tables, and across from that was a television—one of those giant rear projection t.v.s that was probably really nice thirty years ago.

 

All of it was sitting upside down.  The furniture, the rugs, even the pictures on the walls, were all upside down.

 

We stood there together, moving our flashlights around and staring in growing confusion and fear at what we were seeing.  None of this made sense.  Some of these things, the angles they were sitting at, it didn’t even make sense that they’d still be sitting up at all after so long.  The dining room chairs had at least been partially propped up against the legs of the table, but here?  I didn’t know how the recliner and t.v. were even balanced like that.

 

Marcy squeezed my hand hard.  “Let’s get the fuck out of here.”

 

I didn’t argue, and we immediately backed out of the room and turned to head to the front door, our lights flashing across the walls of the hallway as we prepared to run out.  In those streaks of light, I saw several things at once.

 

First, the front door, which we’d left open,  was now shut. 

 

Second, something was written on the inside of the door, though it was too far away to read.

 

Third, I saw someone move at the edge of the darkness.

 

I pulled on Marcy’s hand to make sure she didn’t start forward as I leaned closer to whisper.

 

“Someone…I think someone is in here with us.”

 

When I glanced at her, she was still staring forward, moving her flashlight around, but she gave me a quick trembling nod as a single tear ran down her cheek.

 

“Do we try to go out the front or?”

 

She nodded again, her voice barely audible.  “We don’t know what’s farther back.  We try the door, and if it doesn’t work, we break a window and climb out.”  Giving a small shudder, she added.  “The room with the stains.  We can use our flashlights.  The other one is…where it was standing.”

 

Heart pounding in my ears, I nodded and gave her hand another squeeze.  “You stay here and look out while I go get the door open.”

 

Marcy looked at me with a frown.  “No.  We go together.  Stay together.”  With that, she pulled me toward the front door, shining her light into the dining room and when we didn’t see anyone there, she shined it around behind us.    I reached out for the door as my eyes landed on the words scratched into the white paint on the inside.

 

**Beware the Harrow**

 

It made me hesitate for a moment, but I pushed all my questions aside and grabbed the knob, turning it hard while yanking at the door.  It didn’t budge.

 

“What the fuck!  It’s…”

 

“It’s coming!”

 

Marcy’s voice was right behind me, still a whisper, but high and terrified.  I looked behind me, past her, but I didn’t see anything.

 

“What…?  Where?”  I yanked and twisted the knob again while still trying to see what she was talking about.

 

“It’s…oh God….It’s reaching out…”

 

My body was vibrating with adrenaline and I could hear the static of fear wanting to become shock crackling in my ears.  “Marcy, I don’t see it…I…”

 

She let out a gasp and started coughing hard,  a deep, hacking cough that doubled her over as her light bounced around the walls.  I reached out to her, eyes looking everywhere, as my other hand gave one last desperate tug on the door.

 

It opened easily out into the world.

 

Grabbing Marcy, I ran her outside and back out to the truck, getting her in and buckled before going around and getting in to drive.  She was still coughing, but only a little now, and she hadn’t said anything else.  When I asked her if she was okay, she just nodded without looking up at me, and I decided it was better to get away and then ask her more questions after we were somewhere safe.

 

So I drove us back into town.  I thought about going to my house or hers, but I didn’t want to wait that long to check on her again.  Pulling into a well-lit gas station, I parked in front of the store and looked over at her. 

 

“Are you okay?”

 

She sat silent for a few moments before turning to look at me.  “I don’t think so.”

 

Her voice sounded hoarse, and her eyes were wet, though I wasn’t sure if it was tears or just from coughing so hard.

 

“Do you think you’re sick?  Like you’re having an allergic reaction to something?”

 

Reaching up to scratch the back of her neck, she shook her head.  “No, it’s not like that.  I saw…I saw that thing coming towards us.”

 

I nodded, reaching out to touch her arm.  “I know.  I couldn’t see it, or find it maybe, I don’t know.  It all was so fast.  What was it?”

 

Still rubbing her neck, she shrugged.  “I don’t know.  It was like a shadow, or like a dust cloud, except it was moving itself and it had a shape that kept changing.  Like…it was a *thing*, not a cloud.  And…” Her lip began trembling again.  “It was reaching out.   It…it touched me.”

 

“Fuck!  I…okay, what do we…do you want me to take you to a hospital or something?”

 

Marcy shook her head.  “No, I just…fuck!  Look at my fucking neck, okay?  Something back there hurts like fuck, and I can feel something…something back there.”  She turned in her seat to put her back facing me as she pulled down the neck of her shirt.  “Ahhh…Do you see anything back there?”

 

Turning on the overhead light, I leaned forward and sucked in a breath.  There were raised marks, lines, on the back of her neck just below the hairline.  Not just lines, but…they were fucking letters.

 

**N**

**I**

**W**

 

“It…just, listen, try not to freak out.  It’ll be okay.  We’ll figure this out.”

 

“What the fuck is it?”

 

“It looks like letters.  N I W.  I don’t know what it means, and the N is turned wrong,  but they look like letters in your skin.  Like raised from your skin.”

 

She was breathing fast, panicked breaths now.  “What the fuck?  What the…oh God.”

 

“I… I don’t know.  We need to take you somewhere.  Get help.”

 

“You’re sure it’s letters, not just a scratch or a rash?”

 

“No, I…I mean it really looks like letters.  Either NIW, or if it’s backwards, it could be WIN.”

 

She froze just then.  “It…It’s backwards.  Because…oh God.  I can still feel it.  It’s writing from the inside and I can fucking feel it.  Oh Jesus.  Oh no, we have…ahhh!”

 

Marcy jerked and I reached out to touch her, comfort her, help in some way, though I didn’t know how.  But then I saw it and my hand froze.

 

Something inside, pressing outward, making its mark as it drew another letter into her skin while I watched.

 

“What is it?  What is it writing?”

 

Everything was static to me now.  I could barely think, barely hear, barely do anything except try my best to not jump out of the truck and run.  “I…Fuck, it’s an E.  It looks like a fucked up E.  Do you want to go to the hospital or where?”  My eyes were still transfixed to her skin bulging out as the last of the lines of the letter were drawn against her insides.  This had to all be a nightmare, none of it could be real.

 

I saw a sudden change in Marcy as she shifted back to sitting normally in the seat.  Her breathing was quiet now, and when she spoke, her voice was hoarse but calm.  “No, I can go home.  I think it’s okay now.”

 

I frowned, my worry and concern pushing through my fear for the moment.  “Are you sure?  That’s not normal.”

 

Marcy shrugged.  “Probably just stress.  The body can do weird things when you’re really scared or stressed.  If it’s not gone tomorrow I can go to the doctor then.”

 

I should have pushed harder.  I knew then I should have, but I also knew what I’d just seen, and in that moment I was so scared I just wanted to see her home safely and run away.  Wake up the next day and have it all be a bad dream.

 

So instead, I took her home and let her out.  She walked away without another word, up the well-manicured walk to her parents’ front door.  I almost called out to her, told her to come back, but I didn’t.  I was too afraid, so I didn’t.

 

Instead I went home, and for hours I sat alone in my old bedroom with the lights on, going between wanting to text or call her and being scared she’d call or text me instead.  It was nearly sunrise when I finally fell asleep, and a couple of hours later I woke up to my mother on the phone, talking loudly and starting to cry.

 

After I left her, Marcy had went inside her house.  When the mail man came by the next morning, he saw the front door was open and what looked like bloody footprints leading out of the house and into the world.

 

He called the cops, and when they went inside, they found what she had done.  Her parents were in the living room, her little brother was up in his bed.  All three ripped open  and hollowed out like you might field dress a deer.

 

Outside of those bloody footprints, they never found a trace of her again.  They talked to me about it, of course.  They talked to everybody.  For my part, I told the part they’d believe.  That we‘d gone out riding around and then I’d dropped her back off at home.  She hadn’t said anything about hurting anybody, and I hadn’t known she was going to do what she did.  All of that was true.

 

I didn’t tell them about the abandoned house we stopped at or the thing that had lived inside.  About what happened to my best friend.  About how I abandoned her once I truly understood.

 

Because Marcy had been partially right.  The letters were backwards to me because it was writing from the inside.  But it wasn’t writing nonsense.  And it wasn’t writing WIN or WINE.  It was giving me a warning.

 

A warning that, like everything else, was upside [down](https://www.reddit.com/r/Verastahl/).
