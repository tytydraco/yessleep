Not like I believed any of this when I first heard about him.

The Man Who Started The Apocalypse. It sounded like a bad joke.

It all started with a persistent letter in my mailbox. Like I said, it wasn’t like I believed any of it at all, and given the many stories and myths I had debunked—this one might have been the most outlandish of them all.

My recent blogs, I’ll admit, have run dry of the kind of reality-bending horror stories that once brought this account to life—it was a cruelly slow process of watching my blog lose the life that once made it so enjoyable.

It’s been 7 whole days since I’ve even had anything in my mail. 

But I didn’t want to be like other creators, taking up on unbelievably contrived clickbait stories—no, that wasn’t the kind of journalist I am—so it took me exactly 72 letters in my thirsty mailbox, a river of bills I could no longer sail away from—and the irritable urge to just get it over with to finally take this story in. What could be so urgent, so important that it simply must be broadcasted to everyone worldwide?

This.

The Man Who Started The Apocalypse didn’t knock. In his head, he was already in the living room, and “that’s what mattered for now”. You will come to find that he’s very cryptic; he would hide major information, yet still over-exaggerate less relevant ones.

“Come in,” I encouraged, by the time I had realized he was standing outside the door for twenty minutes. “Make yourself comfortable…here.”

I tried to not pay attention to the weird mixture of relief and confusion on my dad’s face as I finally brought in a subject after three months of idleness. My dad, still not over the fact that I’m over 18 and yet still in his house, stood by the door protectively—I guess the parental instincts never switched off.

It was more than often a deranged lonely man, or old lady, would see things that weren’t there. Some even got violent. My dad has seen them.

“Here, do you want tea or anything?” I offered. For those of you who may have watched my interviews before, this was but a dirty trick—a trick to get my subject as comfortable as possible before the real questions begin. Questions yielded best results when the subjects didn’t believe they were revealing anything. Although, I think this was one of those cases where the subject wanted nothing but sharing their story.

The Man Who Started The Apocalypse was eerily silent. Matter of fact, his mouth appeared to be full of whatever drink I could possibly offer him.

“So,” I cleared my throat after setting up the recorder, “you know why we’re here today, I’m sure.”

The Man Who Started The Apocalypse was still just as silent.

“Yeah…uhm so, why don’t we refer to this questionnaire—a little practice here and there, just to break the ice? You agree?”

He nodded so subtly, that I may have not caught it, if I had been looking down at my paper for a millisecond. His mouth was full of something, now I was sure of that, because his jaw constricted his movement.

“Okay…so, I’ll take that as a yes.”

He didn’t move an inch.

“Yeah, uhm anyways,” I continued, “if you could tell our listeners what your name is…maybe so people have a context to who you are?” I tried my best to keep the patronizing tone out of my voice.

“Hello?” I urged again, when he continued to hold his silence. “Your name?”

It looks as if I had been the one who was sending spam mail begging for my story to be heard. I was hardly getting any information, and I worked hard to keep my calm. I was supposed to be coaxing reactions out of him, not the other way around.

“There’s the name you’ve registered here, so would you mind if I let the listeners know what it is? Of course you could—“

Cough. Cough. 

I finally learned what it was that he had in his mouth when he spat it on my living room table. It was blood. My stomach turned. I’ve always had a low tolerance for blood. And now it was spreading in a nice, circular pattern on the table. 

I think if there was ever a time where my disbelief started wavering, it was at that point. Something in me cringed like it was infectious waste. Something in me had registered the fear of the moment, even when I had tried so hard to keep it down.

“Hey! Hey!” I cried. “Shit! I’m gonna need to wipe that off….hey, are you okay?”

He was still violently coughing up more blood, and I rushed for a glass of water and a tissue. “I…I…I am alright…I suppose….”

“Okay,” I said. “It’s okay, it’s okay…let me get that in just a—“

“NO!” he screamed. I looked up. “No, no, no, no, no….no. Don’t you dare do that.” He physically got up, and took the tissue from my hands.

“What?” I asked. “What do you mean? You spat on—“

“You CAN’T do that,” he croaked desperately with all the strength he had left. “You just can’t. You must not…you can’t….no….no, no, no…”

All the professionalism I had been trying to maintain evaporated. “And why should I listen to you? You’ve barely said a word since you came in, although you’re the one who’s been sending hundreds of applications in my mail….for months. And now you—“

“Because this is how the apocalypse starts.”

Finally. Something I could work with. “Hmm? What do you mean?” I pressed.

The Man Who Started The Apocalypse sighed as if this was already common knowledge. “You wipe that table off, you mess with the timeline. Then the apocalypse wont start.”

“Why should I want the apocalypse to start?” I asked. I am guilty now to admit, that some childish part of me had wanted the apocalypse to start. I’d wanted to be important. Special. The one who told the story first. Maybe finally, I’d have a good piece to report for this week of my blog. Something more than the usual missing dog flyers and coffee shop reviews nobody read. Something real.

It was the kind of want that begins when you feel too small for the world you’re in. When your life has gone quiet for too long, you start confusing noise with meaning.

I just wanted a story.

“You wouldn’t,” he said simply. “But you would mess with things that were supposed to happen.”

“You’re not making any sense,” I grilled. “If ‘the apocalypse’ already started, then how would it ‘start’ now?”

“I can tell you about that.”

“Good. Finally,” I huffed.

“But first I need to tell you about this plant.”

“What plant?” This interview was going off track, and I knew it was the sign of a weak reporter to let it. But trust me, this time you shall not be disappointed.

“The one in my garden,” he said sadly. “I’ve never had much of a green thumb…I was victim to a deep procrastination that paralleled my love for these plants. I know this is very ironic, since literally my job is to cut trees for lumber—“

“Very funny indeed,” I agreed miserably. I couldn’t see the point of this.

“But the love was there,” he insisted, “and it was why I’d find myself with a new packet of seeds by the end of each week.

“Oh I would so love watching them grow, grow—from the seed to a delicate seedling. But that was when the interest usually died out. I would forget about them for weeks and weeks on end, only to return to their dried remains by the end of the month.”

This conversation was going awfully off track. “I can’t see how this is possibly related—“

“But then there was this plant,” he continued like I had not spoken at all. “My friend had given it to me, and believe me…it was so easy to take care of. Didn’t ask for much water, didn’t care it was growing in the side of the wall with no sunlight—it was one tough plant. It took only three days for it to sprout from a seedling to a fully-grown plant.

He was so engrossed in his story, it was like he was talking to himself. “At first I didn’t take much notice of it but—“

I had to redirect this conversation right now. “I’m sure it—“

“But this plant was special!” he cried out with such emotion in his eyes. He was slowly working himself into a fit thinking about some plant. Maybe my dad was right, I had one of the loonies instead.

“Of course,” I patronized, “but—“

“Once it has grown to full height, it would call out my name every single day, every single hour of the night!” he spat fiercely. I could still see the blood-streaked spit on his lips. “It was a beautiful curse! A beautiful curse I had knowingly—even lovingly—put in my garden. I could not keep my eyes from it for one whole day without becoming severely unhappy. 

“And God was it so full of life, so beautifully lush and green, with long slender branches and frilly edible leaves. They looked so edible, that as the days went on—“

“I think I’m gonna have to cut you off here—“ 

“—that as the days went on, I turned more and more animalistic!” he persisted frantically. “I wanted to eat it!”

“And if you ate it?” I resorted to humoring him, exasperated.

His face darkened with fear. “No, no I could never do that. I could never….I could never bear to try—that plant was the only thing that resurrected my garden back to life.”

“Back to life?” I laughed at his obsessive ramblings. This was already turning out to be one of those interviews I would never look back on, and discard away as ‘not even being halfway reasonable’. “Back to life you mean…?”

“Back to life I mean as in back to life,” he said so solemnly. “All the dead stems, all the dead branches I had neglected…they rose back to life. They were now just as lush and as beautiful as my plant was.”

“Okay so—“ I began, ready to debunk whatever story he had cooked up. Most of them just wanted the extra buck, I couldn’t blame them, but this one was going too far.

“You can believe whatever you want,” he said serenely. “But this plant saved my life. Being a lumberjack meant that I was so used to taking the lives of many trees, so used to the cold of destruction…but this plant taught me life again. It restored the life in my house, the life in my garden…the life in me!”

“I’m sure it must have, but today we—“

“I couldn’t bear to kill it off!” he exclaimed, nearly exploding into the tears that collected from his emotional reaction. “Even when it grew eyes and weird bulbs, I just-I just couldn’t…”

“Now you’re just reaching,” I scoffed.

“I am telling the truth.” 

“Sure you are,” I said sweetly. “Now if you could just tell us, what does this have to do with The Apocalypse?”

“Hm?”

“I said,” I repeated, “what does this plant have to do with The Apocalypse?”

“Everything,” he replied as if this was an obvious fact. “The whole world is a garden now.”

“What do you mean, ‘the whole world is a garden now’?” I pressed.

“I mean, the whole world is a garden now. It spread. Like infection.”

“Right,” I nodded sarcastically. “If you could just elaborate on that, I—“

“It’s a great thing,” he said dreamily. “Nature is fighting back. I’m finally gonna pay for my crimes against her—the whole of mankind is. This plant is beautiful in its persistence against the parasite man is. If it weren’t for—“

This was the first time I had looked at the pool of blood on my table that I had avoided wiping—avoided looking at. My heart sank, and I lurched back on my chair.

“What’s this?!” I screamed. “What did you do to…to my table?”

The Man Who Started The Apocalypse was oblivious to the horror that’s been growing on my dad’s living room table. “What do you mean?” he asked innocently.

This can’t be real, this can’t be real. No no no no no….

“There’s something—it’s growing on the….on the table….” No, this wasn’t real, and I was going to go out with my friends, tell them what a real piece of work I had talked to—we’d laugh at how they got crazier and crazier by each interview.

Things like this don’t happen. And it grew exactly as fast as he said it would, it happened exactly the way he said it would happen. He’s drugged my tea. Or the air I’m breathing—I don’t know how but he must have. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

“Goddammit there’s a mother fucking plant growing on the table!” I yelled, waving my arms desperately. I needed to get up, I needed to get fresh air. “What part of this is hard to understand?”

He laughed—it was a horrible sound that escalated and escalated and grew into an inhumane high before it stoped. “Are you sure about that? Are you?”

It finally clicked. He was playing my game. I was the crazy one with the crazy story, and his belief depended on it. 

“Oh my God, yes!” I yelled desperately. “There’s an ugly plant growing on the fucking blood you spat on! Oh my God, this isn’t happening, oh my God. I need to wipe this off—I”

“No, don’t,” he said simply. The way he said it, it wasn’t just a warning, it was a sure truth. Something bad will happen. “It’s unsafe.”

“Hell if I listen to you again—“

“Everyone will die.”

I looked at him carefully. My eyes hurt—the edges of my vision started blurring with one another. It must be the tea, he probably drugged my tea…

But how? My dad had been watching carefully from outside the room, and he hadn’t moved an inch since he got in. “What?”

“Everyone you know and love will die,” he said ominously. “You will be infected. You have no idea what this plant can do.”

“What can this plant do?” My head was spinning—either from the tea he couldn’t have drugged, or from the remains of the fear.

“Bad,” he replied calmly. “Bad things.”

“Then why are you letting this happen?”

He looked at me sadly. He looked at me as if I was ignorant of something so important. “Because nature is speaking to us. And you should never interfere with divine intervention. Do you believe in divine intervention?”

I kept quiet.

“Of course,” he said bitterly. “You’re so caught up in your facts and proofs and theories—that you fail to see the magic in front of you. How can you be a journalist reporting ‘the truth’, yet hide from the truth many are afraid to stomach—?”

“Maybe you should consider the fact that what you’re saying isn’t real,” I threw acid back, even though fear was growing in my body. “Maybe you should consider that you might not be right, and that this is some unexplainable alien phenomenon—“

“Oh this isn’t alien,” he corrected bleakly. “This is very familiar. This is nature. The one you knew. This is the aftermath of the abuse you refuse to look at—“

“Enough,” I interjected. “You’re not explaining what this is, and why it’s happening—“

“You have to be okay with the fact that some things are better left unexplained, [redacted],” he stated quietly. I’ve never heard my name spoken out loud before, not by people I didn’t have a close direct connection to. My dad knew the protocol—to not refer to me by my name when I had to interview someone—yet somehow the Man Who Started The Apocalypse knew.

“How did you—?”

“I can tell you about that,” he reassured calmly. “I’m just so…hungry. Do you have food I can…?”

“Fine, but you better explain—what happened to the floor??”

The floor had folded neatly into an impossible V-shape. The furniture was somehow magically glued to the floor, also adhering to the V-shape the floor had morphed to. It was unreal, and this was when I knew I was far gone.

“Don’t notice it,” he warned quickly, before all the furniture started sliding into the valley of our floor. It was like our awareness of the impossibility of the situation removed whatever glued this reality together, and now it was all coming apart.

“Shit,” he grumbled, “just get the food, we’ll be fine. And…try not to notice it.”

A million protests rose to my tongue, but I knew he was right. The less I paid attention to this madness, the less damage occurred. I got out of the room—my dad was also glued to the floor, blissfully unaware of the impossible V-shape it had bended to—as I climbed over the kitchen counter to make whatever PB and J sandwich I could muster.

Holding my balance, I returned to a nightmare. It was one of those moments, I wished I could just come back and not walk in to a moment. I think I really need some sleep. I started counting my fingers. Five.

This can’t be real.

An impossible darkness had covered the whole living room—yes it was midday—and there were plants everywhere. Left and right.  I couldn’t see them, but I still knew they were there. I could feel the vitality radiate off of them—the lush life that The Man Who Started The Apocalypse had described. It was still my living room, but the vegetation had taken over—almost like a parasite.

“He-hello?” I called out to the darkness. “Dad? [Redacted]? Are you there? Hello? What….what is happening?”

“It’s too late now,” the Man Who Started The Apocalypse croaked. “The whole world is a garden now. You’re gonna be saved, don’t worry. Just…just try not to touch the plants.”

“That’s funny,” I retorted, but still shied back from them. “They’re everywhere.”

“Burn!” I heard my dad screech, and a relief overcome my body. “BURN IT. BURN THE PLANT. WE NEED TO BURN THE PLANT AND STOP THIS MADNESS!”

He ran through the dense vegetation to the center of the living room. The living room table. The gnarly plant that was growing from the blood. The beginning of all of this. 

And he flicked on a lighter.

For a split second, I saw the plant’s leaves recoil from the licking flames—an instinctive response to harm. And then all the vegetation and darkness disappeared from the room. The floor had returned back to normal. My brain hurt as if returning from a hangover. Something occurred to me.

“[Redacted]?”

“Yes?” he responded.

“What does the plant do?”

“What do you mean?”

“You mentioned that the plant does bad things. I’m asking, what does the plant do?”

He pondered for a moment. “It…it makes you see things. Things that are not real, things that can’t be real! But they feel as if they are.”

“How does the plant achieve this?”

“I have a theory,” he said, “but it’s not really for sure. I think it is most likely releasing spores that also work as a hallucinogen and it may be—“

I felt a glimmer of hope. “What’s the chance that, maybe something like that is happening? That this is all a hallucination?”

“Have you stopped for a moment to think that, maybe you’ve already been stuck in a hallucination?” he asked gloomily. “Maybe what you thought was ‘the real world’ wasn’t so real after all?”

“That’s not—Dad?“

Like a game settings loading into real life, the dark forest glitched back to reality as well. I turned to see if my dad was still burning the plant or not. His aim had hovered to the right, and he was just pitifully burning the empty air.

It makes you see things.

This plant was protecting itself. 

I cut through the jungly vegetation to stop this. “Dad? Dad? Listen to me, you’re burning it the wrong way—“

“What are you talking about?” My dad responded angrily. “Here, look! I’m burning the plant! I know I’m old, but you cannot call me that old—“

“No, Dad, look!” I tried again desperately. “This is where the plant is. You burn it…here.” My dad was too far gone. It was like trying to get a sleepwalking person to see the fact that they’re not in bed anymore. Futile. Pitifully stupid.

“Watch his hand,” the Man Who Started The Apocalypse warned. “Don’t. Don’t touch it!”

A nasty overgrown vine had risen from the plant, and was slowly eating at my dad’s hand. No, it was worse than that, it was merging. Through all the gnarly eyes and pus-filled bulbs, it was hard to tell where the plant ended and my dad’s hand started. The lighter had been absorbed into the yucky, green nightmare that was slowly sucking my dad in.

My dad was blissfully unaware of it. It was like he was asleep with his eyes open. For him it looked like he was high up in heaven.

I remembered how I used to wake my Dad up every Saturday to teach me biking. He would never wake up from what we called his ‘night of the dead’. But even then, he would still wake up at the last call—a “yes, I’m alive!” to reassure my worried self. And now at this cruel time, that was all I needed.

But it never came.

“Dad! No no no! Dad wake up. Dad wake up, we need to go!” The tears slowed my voice to a whisper.

“He’s too far gone,” The Man Who Started The Apocalypse said. It was a nice replacement for what he really meant. My dad was dead. 

“We need to go,” he urged. “Don’t touch him, he’s infected.”

“Dad! Dad! Dad, please wake up,” I pleaded. “Please, wake up, wake up, wake up. We need to leave….before this plant eats you, Dad, you need to listen to me. Wake up…”

I was dragged outside past a dark forest of vegetation, as I watched my dad become fully consumed by this alien plant nightmare. The more horrific events happened, the easier it got to believe that this was just a nightmare. The benefit of the doubt? I had to erase all remains of it—because this was not real. No, can’t be.

This was just a nightmare.

“Do you believe me now?” The Man Who Started The Apocalypse asked as he dragged us outside to the day. If I thought my living room was a dark forest, this was a whole new planet. 

Rainstorms gathered near intense overgrown trees—trees that went at least an impossible 15 meters high. Their trunks were bloated with a black rot, splitting in some places to reveal wet, pulsing bark that looked too much like flesh. 

There were barely any humans, just carcasses of what they used to be. 

They weren’t people anymore. They were living greenhouses—hosts for something older, crueler, and patient.

Some of the humans moved, though movement is too kind a word. They staggered, dragged their feet through—like they were carrying a whole tree inside of them. And this tree would poke out of one of their orifices. Some had it grow out of their ears, the others were completely blinded by the branches that poked through their eyes which once saw—but now was just weeping pollen.

The deeper into this nightmare you went, the louder the wind screamed—not a howl, not a whistle. It sounded like breathing. A forest that exhaled. And it….it was watching us.

“Oh my dear, look!” I heard a lady’s voice scream in delight, and relief. “Barney dear, look! She’s one of the normal ones! She’s not infected. Now we can finally call the emergency services and deal with this—“

Humans, humans love their normal. Anything that’s familiar brings them great comfort. It was an old instinct, to be washed with such relief when you meet what’s familiar. Because back in the cave days, it had meant safety. For the first time in my life,  I understood what my ancestors meant.

I wished I had relished in that small moment of normalcy before I turned around.

It had once been a sweet old lady with her husband, alright. But they weren’t anymore. 

She stood still smiling. Her arm—the one that had once held her cane with such pride—was now a twisted, bark-covered limb. The fingers had fused together, nails stretched into splinters, and small green leaves grew from her wrist like jewelry made of thorns.

Still, when she spoke, her voice was sugar-sweet. The kind of voice that had once offered tea and warm cookies. 

“Barney, why aren’t you saying anything, darling?” she asked, turning her head just slightly towards her husband. “We’ve found other survivors, they’re like us.”

Barney stood with his spine forced unnaturally straight, his eyes leaking tears he didn’t seem aware of. A thick sapling had burst through his throat and up through the roof of his mouth. It stood out, proud and leafy, like a terrible second neck.

He tried to move his lips, but no words came out. It was like the plant had taken his voice.

“You’ve gone quiet again, Barney dear,” she smiled as if trying to pretend it was just one of his silly moods again. “You always do this when we have company.”

She gently patted his hand with her good one. “Oh don’t mind him, he was the one who’s been pestering me about finding company.”

“Oh my God,” I breathed as I held my mouth in horror.

“I know,” The Man Who Started The Apocalypse agreed sadly. “It’s okay, we’re no better than they are anyway.”

It was at that moment I looked at the Man Who Started The Apocalypse. Properly looked at him. Without the effect of the spores, or no hallucinations. I looked at him with complete and utter acceptance of whatever nightmare he was also stricken by.

“Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Are you…are-are you okay?” His leg—the right one—had split open at the calf from pressure. Something had grown in there. Not a bone, not muscle.

A trunk.

It sliced through the skin like it had been growing for years, not months, pushing flesh aside as easily as parting weeds. Veins wrapped around the stump like ivy, quivering under the surface of what used to be his skin.

I finally understood why we’d been walking so slow. His foot barely touched the ground anymore.

“I walk easier when I can’t see it,” he explained. “You should try not to see it too. The hallucinations can be your ally.”

It occurred to me so simply. I looked down at myself as well.

And for a second—just a second—I almost believed I was fine. My hands still looked like hands. My shoes still had laces.

But then I saw it.

My sleeves had darkened—not with blood, but with something sticky and black, seeping up the fabric like roots drinking through cotton. It wasn’t much. Barely there.

“I don’t feel anything,” I whispered.

“Yet.”

I stared at the dark patch spreading up my arm. An eerie calm possessed me. “How long?”

“A week,” he answered with the same blankness. “It’s different for everyone. Some people go fast. Others…it’s like the tree takes its time. Sips instead of eat.”

“The ones who panic…they blossom too fast.” He reached for the disease my hand was. “If you don’t look, you can walk a little longer,” he reassured.

I stared at him. “And go where?”

“Do you see all of this?” he motioned to the air. “People have been living in this nightmare, believing they were in the real world. Believing they weren’t infected. The spores do that. They keep you locked into an imagined reality so it can feed. On you.”

“So I don’t go anywhere,” I said emptily.

“Yes,” he admitted. “A lot of them are too far gone in their delusions, it’s sad watching them really. But some of them, like you, the infection isn’t as severe. So you try to wake them up…and maybe find a way to stop all of this madness.”

“Have you woken up any others?”

A sad smile told me he didn’t. Or even worse he had tried, and wasn’t successful. “The infection catches up. I don’t have much time left.”

He fell to a collapsed tree beside him. The vines immediately snaked up to receive him, like a darkness that’s been waiting for its old friend. 

I noticed the way his ribs moved—shallow and forced, like he was fighting for every breath. Like the forest was already inside his lungs, deciding when to stop letting him breathe at all.

“I thought I could do more,” he croaked. “Warn them sooner. This is nature’s calling. No one believes the ones who see too much.”

The same blood-curdling cough rattled out of him. He covered his mouth, and when he pulled his hand back, sap and blood oozed between his fingers like saliva.

“But you still can,” he said. “You’re still lucid. Still early. You still have you.”

“I don’t know what to say,” I mumbled.

He grabbed my arm urgently as the coughing got worse. His fingers had already started to fuse together—bark, bone, and muscle twisting into something neither man nor wood. “Wake….them up. All of them.”

“And if they don’t listen?” I asked, voice breaking. The time I had laughed at him felt so far away. “If they just laugh at me? If they think I’m the one who’s deluded?”

He smiled resignedly, like someone finally closing their eyes after a long, long day. “Then you’ll tell them what I told you.”

I felt the weight of it before he said it.

“That you started the apocalypse.”
