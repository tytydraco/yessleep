The woods were supposed to be a refuge. After everything that had happened, I just needed to get away. My life had been falling apart—work stress, a messy breakup, and the overwhelming suffocation of city life. The decision to spend a weekend in a secluded cabin, far from everything, felt like the only way to breathe again. 

The first day had been exactly what I needed. I woke up to the sound of birds, the crisp air filling my lungs as I stepped outside with a cup of coffee. The trees stretched up to the sky, their leaves rustling gently in the breeze. I spent the morning wandering the trails near the cabin, finding peace in the simplicity of nature. But that peace was short-lived.

It started when I decided to go deeper into the woods. I wasn’t worried about getting lost—I had my phone with GPS, a map, and I was confident in my sense of direction. Besides, I’d always been good at hiking, and the thrill of exploring uncharted paths was too tempting to resist.

The deeper I went, the more the trees seemed to close in around me. The light filtering through the canopy grew dimmer, the air cooler. After a while, the trails became less distinct, overgrown with shrubs and brambles. I paused, realizing I hadn’t seen a trail marker in some time. No big deal, I thought, I’d just retrace my steps. But as I turned around, the woods felt different—more menacing. The path I’d come from seemed to vanish into the undergrowth.

I tried not to panic. I took out my phone, only to find the GPS struggling to get a signal. The map app spun uselessly, and a cold trickle of fear ran down my spine. The sun was beginning to set, casting long shadows through the trees. I needed to head back to the cabin.

I walked in what I thought was the right direction, but nothing looked familiar. The trees all started to blend together, their branches reaching out like twisted arms. I picked up my pace, my breath coming faster, trying to ignore the creeping dread clawing at the edges of my mind. 

Then I heard it—a rustling in the bushes behind me. I froze, straining to listen. It could have been anything, a deer or a squirrel, but the noise was too deliberate, too careful. It was as if something was watching me, following me.

“Hello?” I called out, my voice trembling. The rustling stopped. Silence fell over the woods, heavy and unnatural. I waited, my heart pounding in my chest, but there was no reply.

I took a step forward, and the rustling started again, closer this time. I didn’t wait to find out what it was. I broke into a run, branches slapping against my face, my feet stumbling over roots and rocks. I didn’t care about the direction anymore; I just needed to get away.

But the rustling followed me, growing louder, more frantic. Whatever it was, it was fast. I could feel its presence behind me, just out of sight. A low growl echoed through the trees, primal and hungry, and I knew then that I wasn’t imagining things—something was hunting me.

My lungs burned as I ran, my legs screaming in protest, but I didn’t dare stop. The trees blurred past, and the last of the daylight faded into twilight. I was running blind, my mind a whirlwind of terror and exhaustion.

Then, out of nowhere, I tripped. My foot caught on something, and I went sprawling, skidding across the dirt and leaves. The impact knocked the wind out of me, and for a moment, I just lay there, gasping for breath. But I could hear it—whatever was chasing me—it was close. Too close.

I forced myself up, pain shooting through my ankle, and looked around frantically. The rustling had stopped, but the feeling of being watched was stronger than ever. My eyes darted through the darkened woods, searching for any sign of movement, but I saw nothing. The woods were deathly silent again.

Then, from the corner of my eye, I saw it—a figure, standing just beyond the tree line, shrouded in shadow. It was tall, impossibly tall, with limbs that seemed too long for its body. Its head cocked to one side, as if studying me, and a wave of nausea hit me as I realized its eyes were glowing—a sickly, pale yellow.

I wanted to scream, to run, but my body refused to move. The creature stepped forward, its movements unnaturally smooth, almost like it was gliding. As it approached, I could see its features more clearly—or rather, the lack of them. Its face was a grotesque mockery of a human’s, with skin stretched too tight over its skull, and its mouth—if you could call it that—was a jagged line that split its face in two.

I scrambled backward, trying to put distance between us, but the creature didn’t rush. It moved slowly, deliberately, as if savoring the fear radiating from me. Then, it spoke—its voice was a distorted echo, as if a dozen voices were speaking at once, some too high-pitched, others too deep.

“Lost… alone… afraid…” it whispered, each word crawling under my skin, twisting my insides with dread. “Why… do you… trespass?”

My voice failed me. All I could do was shake my head, tears streaming down my face. The creature leaned closer, its breath a foul stench of decay, and for a moment, I was certain this was it. I was going to die out here, devoured by whatever this thing was.

But then, something changed. The creature stiffened, its head snapping up as if listening to something I couldn’t hear. Its glowing eyes narrowed, and for the first time, I saw something that looked like fear cross its twisted features. It turned its head, slowly scanning the woods around us, and I followed its gaze, though I didn’t want to know what it was looking for.

The air grew colder, the temperature dropping so rapidly that I could see my breath in the air. The trees around us creaked and groaned, their branches shaking as if buffeted by an invisible wind. And then I heard it—a low, rumbling growl that vibrated through the ground, through my bones. It was deeper than anything I’d ever heard, more primal, more terrifying.

The creature in front of me recoiled, taking a step back. Its glowing eyes darted around frantically, and for the first time, it looked unsure, even vulnerable. I didn’t understand what was happening, but I knew one thing: whatever had scared this thing, this monster, was far worse than it could ever be.

The growl echoed again, closer this time, and the creature hissed in response. It turned back to me, its voice more frantic now, the distortion in its tone more pronounced. “Run,” it said, its voice overlapping itself in a chaotic cacophony. “Run… hide… now.”

Without waiting for me to respond, the creature backed away, its form dissolving into the shadows as if it had never been there. I was alone again, but that sense of relief was fleeting. The growl was still there, louder now, reverberating through the trees, and I could feel something moving through the woods—something massive, something that made the ground tremble with each step it took.

I pushed myself to my feet, ignoring the pain in my ankle, and started to run. I didn’t care where I was going anymore; I just needed to get away, to put as much distance between myself and whatever was coming. The woods were a blur around me, darkness closing in from all sides, but I kept moving, driven by pure, primal fear.

The growl followed me, relentless, growing louder and louder until it felt like it was right behind me. The air was thick with the scent of decay, the cold seeping into my bones, and I knew that if I stopped, even for a second, whatever was chasing me would catch me, and there would be no escape.

I don’t know how long I ran. Time had lost all meaning, my world reduced to the sound of my own heartbeat and the growl that stalked me through the woods. My legs were numb, my lungs burning, but I couldn’t stop. I couldn’t.

And then, suddenly, the trees thinned, and I burst out of the woods into a clearing. The sight of open sky, the stars overhead, was like a shock to my system. I stumbled forward, gasping for breath, my mind struggling to comprehend that I was out—that I had somehow made it through.

But the growl… it was gone. The air was still, the woods behind me silent. I turned, half-expecting to see something emerge from the trees, some monstrous form to come crashing through. But there was nothing. Just the wind whispering through the leaves.

I didn’t trust it. Every instinct screamed at me to keep moving, to not look back, but my legs wouldn’t cooperate. I collapsed onto the grass, my entire body trembling with exhaustion and fear. I was safe, I tried to tell myself. Whatever it was, it was gone.

But even as I sat there, staring back into the dark maw of the forest, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was still being watched, that something was still out there, lurking just beyond the edge of the trees, waiting for the right moment.

And then I heard it—a voice, faint and distorted, carried on the wind. My own voice, calling out from deep within the woods, pleading, desperate.

“Please… help… I’m lost…”

My blood turned to ice.

It was unmistakable—my own voice, distorted and echoing through the trees. It wasn’t possible, it couldn’t be possible, but there it was, drifting through the night air like a mocking whisper. 

“Please… help… I’m lost…”

The words repeated, each one hitting me with a wave of dread. I scrambled to my feet, my heart racing again, but I couldn’t force myself to move. It was like my legs were rooted to the ground, my mind paralyzed by the terror of what I was hearing. My voice… but not my voice.

I turned slowly, my eyes scanning the darkness, searching for any sign of movement. The woods were still, eerily quiet, but the voice kept coming, closer now, circling me, as if something was moving through the trees, just out of sight.

“Please… I’m scared… help me…”

My hands shook as I fumbled for my phone, hoping to use the flashlight, to shine some light on the surrounding area, to see what was out there. But my phone, which had already failed me in the woods, flickered to life for only a moment before the screen went black, completely dead. I cursed under my breath, the last shred of control slipping away as the voice continued to circle me.

Then, from the corner of my eye, I saw it—a figure standing at the edge of the clearing, half-hidden by the shadows of the trees. It was too far away to make out any details, but the shape was familiar. It looked like… me.

No, not like me. It *was* me.

I stepped back, my breath catching in my throat as the figure mirrored my movements, stepping forward into the moonlight. I stared in disbelief as I saw my own face staring back at me, my own eyes, wide with terror, my own mouth forming those same desperate pleas.

“Please… help… I’m lost…”

The words were wrong, twisted, like a recording played on a loop, and I realized with a sickening lurch in my stomach that the figure wasn’t quite right. Its movements were jerky, its features just slightly off, like someone trying to paint a picture from memory and getting the details wrong.

The figure took another step closer, and as it did, its face began to change. The skin rippled, stretching, and the mouth split open into a grotesque grin that tore across its face. The eyes, which had once been a mirror of my own, glowed with a sickly yellow light.

It wasn’t me. It was the creature, the skinwalker, and it was using my voice, my face, to lure me in.

I turned to run, but the moment I did, the air grew heavy again, that oppressive cold seeping back into the clearing. The growl returned, low and menacing, vibrating through the ground beneath my feet. The skinwalker froze, its grin faltering as it whipped its head around, searching the darkness.

The growl was closer now, much closer, and I could feel the ground trembling with the weight of whatever was approaching. The skinwalker hissed, its distorted voice breaking into a cacophony of overlapping sounds, a frantic chorus of voices pleading, crying, screaming.

It started to back away, but it was too late. The woods exploded with movement as something massive barreled out of the trees, crashing into the clearing with a force that knocked me off my feet. I hit the ground hard, the wind knocked out of me, but I forced myself to look up.

What I saw defied comprehension.

It was a creature of darkness, a mass of shifting shadows and grotesque forms that writhed and twisted, never settling into a single shape. Eyes—dozens of eyes—glowed from within the mass, and a maw of jagged teeth opened wide, releasing that deep, primal growl that reverberated through the clearing.

The skinwalker screamed, a sound that pierced the night, and it turned to flee, but the shadow beast was faster. It surged forward, tendrils of darkness shooting out, wrapping around the skinwalker, dragging it back into the depths of the woods. The last thing I saw of the creature that had been hunting me was its face—my face—twisted in a final, desperate scream before it was consumed by the darkness.

And then, just like that, the clearing was silent.

I lay there, too stunned to move, my mind struggling to process what had just happened. The air was still, the oppressive cold lifting, but the fear didn’t leave me. I knew I wasn’t safe, not yet. Whatever that thing was, it had taken the skinwalker, but it was still out there, lurking in the darkness, waiting.

I forced myself to stand, my entire body trembling. I couldn’t stay here. I had to get out, had to find my way back to civilization, to safety. But the woods were vast, and I had no idea which way to go. I glanced back at the spot where the skinwalker had been taken, the ground disturbed, the grass flattened, but there was no sign of the creature or its predator.

And then, from the darkness, I heard it. Not a growl this time, but a whisper, low and insidious, slithering into my mind.

“Run…”

It wasn’t a threat. It was a warning.

Without another thought, I turned and ran, sprinting across the clearing and into the woods. The trees closed in around me, the darkness thickening, but I didn’t stop. I couldn’t. I didn’t know what was behind me, but I knew I had to keep moving, had to get away.

The whisper followed me, echoing through the trees, urging me on, and I ran until my legs gave out, collapsing in a heap on the forest floor. I lay there, gasping for breath, waiting for the growl, for the whispers, for the darkness to claim me.

But nothing came.

The woods were silent again, the oppressive presence gone, and for the first time, I felt like I might actually survive this. I forced myself up, my body screaming in protest, and continued forward, walking through the night, praying that I would find the cabin, or at least the road, anything that would take me away from this nightmare.

I don’t know how long I walked, but eventually, I saw a light in the distance. It was faint, but it was enough to renew my strength, to push me forward. I stumbled through the trees, my vision blurring with exhaustion and fear, until I broke through the undergrowth and found myself standing on a dirt road.

The light was coming from a small cabin, not mine, but it didn’t matter. I staggered toward it, every step an effort, and pounded on the door. A few agonizing moments passed before it opened, and a man stood there, his eyes wide with surprise and concern.

“Please,” I gasped, my voice barely a whisper. “Help me.”

He didn’t hesitate. He pulled me inside, shut the door, and the warmth of the cabin washed over me, a stark contrast to the cold that had gripped the woods. I collapsed onto the floor, my body giving out, and darkness took me.

When I woke, I was safe. The man had called for help, and I was taken to the hospital, treated for exhaustion and dehydration. They found my cabin, but they never found the creature—or its predator.

I didn’t tell them what I had seen. They wouldn’t have believed me anyway. But I knew the truth, knew that the woods were haunted by more than just ancient trees and wildlife. There was something out there, something beyond human comprehension, and it was hunting the hunters.

I left the city after that, moved far away, somewhere the woods were nothing more than a distant memory. But sometimes, in the dead of night, I wake up to the sound of a low growl, or a whisper that slips through my mind like a cold breeze. And I know, deep down, that it’s still out there, waiting.

And one day, it might come for me again.
