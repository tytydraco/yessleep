Have you ever heard the expression, “Can’t see the forest for the trees”? It means getting so caught up in the little things that you miss the bigger picture. Something about that phrase has always bugged me. A whole is made of parts, tiny details that shape everything. If you keep looking at the broad strokes, you won’t notice what’s right in front of you. This is almost entirely unrelated. The story I’m going to tell you isn’t about idioms; it’s about my family, and what happened to my father.



I’ll start with some background. I’m from rural Kansas, I was born there and spent most of my childhood in the same house. My family and I lived in a farmhouse near the edge of the woods. It used to be a pretty sizable farm apparently, but most of the arable land had been reclaimed by nature. The only evidence of what used to be was the large meadow at the back of our house. My dad told me it was on what used to be a corn plot, now nothing more than a collection of tall, yellow grass. A couple hundred feet back sat the treeline, the forest guarded by a span of massive evergreens. Our house itself wasn’t anything special either. It was a wooden two-story farmhouse, built almost a century ago. My father told me he and my mom bought it when they were newlyweds. I came shortly after I suppose.



I must’ve been about 8 when I began to hear the whispering, from the meadow I mean. It didn’t happen often, only when I was alone outside and even then only on a handful of occasions. I can recall the first time I heard it. I was playing right on the edge of the porch, the grass about 10 feet away from me. I didn’t notice it at first, but the wind suddenly died down to complete stagnation. Accompanying that was the usual sound of buzzing insects fading away to silence. Absorbed in an imaginary world of cowboys locked in a gunfight, my head was only ripped away from my toys when I heard the sound of a soft voice come from the grass, 



“Come here.”



The voice sounded sweet and bubbly, not unlike a mother beckoning her young child. It reminded me of my own mother at the time, although it was unmistakably distinct.



“It’s okay, don’t be shy.” 



The female voice giggled after it finished speaking. I didn’t say a word, only standing up and gazing into the field. My naive mind wasn’t exactly sure what to do; the voice seemed kind and sweet, but like every child I was taught not to talk to strangers. I eventually decided on the latter instinct, picking up my toys and walking inside as best as my short legs allowed.



That night at dinner, I told my parents about what had happened to me that day unprompted, as little kids tend to do. 



“There’s somebody outside in the grass.”



My father was at the stove finishing up on plating our meals, only half-listening to what I said. My mother was sitting in her chair, staring almost catatonically at the opposite wall. Looking back at my childhood now, I can only recall a few times she actually spoke. Most of the time she just lightly smiled, watched tv, or swept the house robotically. A majority of the housework was done by my dad, which included cooking. He was the first one to break the silence after my statement of fact.



“Is that so? Another cowboy escaping the law?” He asked, entertaining my usual fantasy of outlaws in the old West.



“No daddy, it was a woman. She was whispering to me from the meadow.”



With that, my father immediately stopped what he was doing and focused on our conversation. He did not move from the stove, only turning his head to face me.



“Boy, there is nobody in the field, understand me? Do not make up such nonsense.”



“But there was daddy, I heard her.”



His voice snapped, “No you did not, no one is in the grass or anywhere else on our property besides us and that is the end of it. Stop lying to me and your mother.” He was a lot harsher in his response, looking at me in the way he only did when I had done something gravely wrong. I remember seeing the look on his face falter for a moment, his angry expression fracturing for no more than a second. Once he finished his dressing-down, he returned to what he was doing as if nothing happened. He placed each of our plates of food in front of us and sat down himself across from my mother. She turned her head to me and softly placed her hand on mine with a small smile,



“Your father just doesn’t want you believing anything silly, James. He loves you more than you’ll ever know.”



If that was true, I wasn’t feeling it then. The rest of dinner was in silence, my eyes welling up and distorting my vision. My father picked up our dirty plates as usual and began washing them, my mom still sat at the dinner table. I pushed my chair back and ran up the stairs to my room, shutting the door and crying into my pillow. Even as a small child I could tell my father knew more than he was letting on, although I didn’t know what at the time. 



Later that night, I came down to the kitchen to get a glass of water. Looking into the living room I saw my mom watching tv, her body unmoving save her bouncing leg. My father was standing at the kitchen sink, looking out the window and into our backyard. As I filled up my cup from the fridge, I looked closer at my dad. He didn’t seem to acknowledge me, just standing almost as frozen as my mother. His eyes were scanning the treeline, like he was searching for something. As I left the kitchen with my cup he gave me a silent pat on the back, assuring me that he wasn’t mad anymore and that I wouldn’t be punished. 



I heard the whispering again the very next day. It was a situation very similar to the previous one, only this time it was a male voice I heard.



“Hey, come here.” It beckoned softly, same as the woman the previous day. I stood up like before, responding to the voice for the first time.



“My daddy said you aren’t real.” I didn’t say it defiantly, more as though I was informing the voice of a fact that it ought to be aware of.



“That’s okay. Sometimes grown-ups pretend things aren’t real.” 



I frowned at that answer. I wasn’t used to grown-ups being wrong, especially not my dad. But the voice didn’t sound angry or mean, just reassuring.



“But… he gets mad when I talk about you.” I said in a hushed tone, my head quickly checking the kitchen window. No one was in sight. “I’m not supposed to lie.”



“You’re not lying, you’re just listening. You can listen a lot better when you’re closer to us.”



I felt my stomach twist in knots. Even with how gentle his tone was, this didn’t feel right. I could feel the wind pick up, blowing against my face and causing the grass to sway in my direction. The reeds leaned in, pale yellow hands of grass grasping out at me. I bolted inside, my steps causing the planks of the porch to shake as I heard the voice’s final command, much louder than the rest, “Come back.”



I slammed the back door behind me, huffing and puffing while leaning my weight against it in a mixture of stress and relief. 



That same day my parents and I left to visit my grandparents who lived a couple hours away. After the experience I’d had, I wasn’t going to object to that. This meant it wasn’t until about a week and a half later that we were back at our house. When we returned, I walked up the stairs back to my room to find something strange. My cowboys toys were laying neatly on my bed. I didn’t remember bringing them inside, and my parents certainly wouldn’t have brought them in from the yard. That night I experienced something far stranger.



 I was under the covers as usual when I began to hear whispering coming from beside my bed.



“Jaaaaaaaaaames.” It whispered in a hushed tone, a voice different from the other two I’d heard. This one had a sing-song quality to it, like it was trying to comfort me. I turned my head to look at what made the sound only to see nothing. Instead I heard the whispering again, this time right outside my bedroom door.



“Jaaaaaaaaaames.” It called again. I was hesitant to leave my bed, but curiosity overtook fear and caused me to stand up. My bare feet made a light sound against the hardwood as I opened the door to my room. Again, nothing was there. I heard the voice call again from the bottom of the stairs. In the dead of night, I could only see the top few steps. The rest were enveloped in darkness, as if black ink had flooded the bottom floor.



Slowly, I descended the steps into the kitchen. The door to the backyard stood just a few feet away, and I heard a final whisper come from just beyond it.



“Jaaaaaaaaaames.”



I don’t know what compelled me at this point, but I slowly walked up to the back door and turned the knob, my body hit with cool night air. The wind was blowing towards me softly, the grass billowing as it bent with the wind.



“James, come closer.” The voice beckoned. Unlike the other times I’d heard the whispering, this time I felt more drawn to it, like I was in a trance. Slowly, I approached. I felt my feet touch the cold wood of the porch, followed by the steps down onto the yard and into the soft blades of grass above the dirt. 



“Come on James, you don’t want to be alone out here, do you?” It kept up its soft, coercive tone, although it was clearly masking excitement. I continued to get closer to the field, the grass waving harder as the wind got stronger. I was only a few steps away from the meadow when I felt a strong, firm grip on my shoulder.



“Boy, go to your room and do not come out until I get you.” I looked up to see my father standing there, a stern neutral expression on his face. He was looking straight ahead, into the meadow and beyond. I quickly obeyed, running back inside and up the steps into my room. I could hear the back door being slammed behind me as I dove back into my covers.



I don’t know when I got back to sleep, but when I woke up daylight shone through my window and my father was sitting on a wooden chair a few feet away from my bed. Once I came to and sat up in bed, he spoke.



“I don’t want you to go into the yard alone ever again, understand?” He took on a serious tone like the night before, but this time it was much softer. I don’t think he was mad, but moreso wanted to make sure the message was clear. I just nodded silently, and he got up from his chair and went downstairs to make breakfast. We didn’t talk about the whispering again for a long time.



I spent all my summers after that at my grandparents, and my father seemed to drop me off for “surprise visits” quite often when school allowed it. I got to know them better, and my own parents less. It felt like my father was trying to keep me away from the house as much as possible. Whenever I was home, I made sure to heed his instructions and never even dared go into the yard. Even if I tried, I was sure that he’d locked the back door. I did still catch glimpses of the field whenever I left for school or came back from my grandparents. Most of the time it looked as such; just a meadow full of tall, yellow grass that occasionally billowed in the wind. But, sometimes I would swear I saw things. Nothing major, just split-second glimpses that could be written off as tricks of the mind. Things like all black figures hunched over, clutching the ground, or the same figures standing and swaying with the grass, letting the wind bend them. Like I said, these probably weren’t even there, but it added to the uneasy feeling I got whenever I was in our house.



It no longer felt welcoming, instead at night all I would notice was the rhythmic groaning of our house. It would creak with a shrill sound for a bit, then groan with a deep guttural sound a few seconds later. Sleep wasn’t so easy in our house anymore, and I felt myself dashing whenever I was in the dark anywhere besides my room. I always came back to this feeling. Like something was there right behind me, ready to grab me and pull me away into the unending darkness. Fortunately, that never happened. If something was in the house, it was biding its time, waiting for the right moment.



The next memory I have in the house isn’t until I was 12. I got thirsty in the middle of night and went down to the kitchen to fill up a glass. While I was walking past the sink, something caught the corner of my eye. I looked out the kitchen window to see my mother in the field. The grass meant I could only see above her waist, but even from inside the house I could tell something was… off. She looked like she was ballroom dancing, except by herself. Her arms were stretched out, draping over her invisible partner’s shoulder while resting the other on their waist. She kept waltzing in a square, swaying side to side over and over. I set my cup down on the counter, stuck watching my mom moving in a trance. I walked over to the back door, the warning my father had given me years prior far away from my present thoughts. Turning the knob, I pulled open the only barrier between the house and the field. Looking out into the yard, my mom had disappeared, replaced only with the billowing meadow.



“JAMES!” I heard my name yelled much louder than ever before, a cacophony of voices calling it out from the field. An intense wind picked up, one stronger than I’d ever felt before. My hair tousled almost immediately, the back door swinging back into the kitchen and slamming against the wall.



“WE’RE TIRED OF WAITING, JAMES. WE WANT WHAT IS OURS.”



I put my arms up to block against the wind, which was about as effective as chicken wire against a dust storm. The reeds of grass were almost sideways, vibrating from the intensity of the wind.



The voices started to become more discordant, their speech overlaying as they became filled with more rage,



“WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING / WAITING / STARVING.” There were even more I couldn’t make out before I heard the sound of thumping footsteps running up from behind me. It was my dad, pointing around to the end of the house’s wall,



“Boy! Get to the car now!” His command was terse and loud, cutting through the howl of the wind. I did as I was told, bolting around the house to the driveway. As I left, I could still hear the field calling to me, “YOU HEAR US / YOU FELT US / YOU CANNOT DENY US.” I could see my mom next to the car, her arms open and hugging me tight. It was the most animated I’d ever seen her. She got in the driver’s seat of our car and let me get in the passenger side. Once I buckled in, she sped off at full speed. I watched through the window as our farmhouse disappeared into the inky night.



“What’s dad doing?” I asked, not getting a response. My mom had fallen back into her usual catatonic routine, robotically driving the car forward without a word. I don’t even remember if I saw her blink until we reached my grandparents’ house.



\~

I never saw my dad again after that night, nor did I go back to our house for a very long time. My mother went back a couple days after we left. Once she came back, she was even more distant than before. Eventually, she had some kind of psychotic break and was put in an institution a state away. I haven’t really seen her since.



If I had written this story a couple weeks ago, that would’ve been where it ended. I grew up, my grandparents passed, I had a life of my own. The thing is, I went back to my childhood home last week, and what I saw has put everything else in perspective. It started with a memory I got the other night. I don’t even think it’s a real memory, since I have no idea when it was and my dad and I were on the back porch, something he wouldn’t have allowed. In it, he was sitting in a rocking chair, the night air heavy and thick. He was rocking back and forth slowly, watching the tree line. His face remained neutral, but his eyes were constantly darting between the trees, like how a frightened animal scans for a predator. I remember seeing a half-empty bottle of whiskey on the end table next to the chair, something I don’t think I ever saw my dad drink. The night was silent, the only sounds being the creaking of his rocking or the crickets chirping. Then he began to speak, slowly. It sounded like he’d been wanting to say this for a while, but it was difficult to phrase it correctly.



“Boy… some things don’t need teeth to eat, they just need your eyes. They feed off of attention, drinking up your soul like roots to water. Some things only grow when they’re seen.”



It was extremely cryptic. And again, I don’t even know where the memory came from. But something about it kept gnawing at me, the way he spoke about some creature that only needed your eyes to hunt you. That just by thinking about it, you were inviting it into your life. After about a week I figured the only place I’d get answers would be in the setting of my distant childhood memories. It was a few states away by now, it was a miracle I even remembered the address. 



My once rustic yet maintained home had ceased to be the latter. The gutters were falling off, vegetation had taken up half the walls, the entire place seemed to have been reclaimed by nature. Entering through the front door, I found myself greeted by a place I hadn’t seen in over 10 years, left just as it had been when my mom and I left. I could even still see some dishes in the drying rack, now caked with dust. The air in the house was old and stagnant, and when I took a deep breath through my nose I smelt nothing at all. It didn’t smell of fresh paint and sawdust as I recalled, instead simply a faded replica of my memory. I bet you’re wondering if I went outside to the field, and I did. I opened the back door, expecting to be greeted in the same way I had last time I went into the yard. Instead, the meadow was gone. Most of it was clumpy dirt, and what sparse grass was still in the ground lay flat and dead, no longer a yellow hue and beginning to rot. I heard no voices, felt no wind, instead all that was left behind was very similar to the house; a smaller, less vibrant version of what I could remember. Something about seeing such an integral part of my memories gone felt… odd. It was like if you noticed a portrait in your home gaining another figure, or if you saw that a statue had moved its position; seeing an immutable truth being inexplicably changed.



My bedroom was much the same, my comic books from when I was a young boy still scattered on the floor. It was my parents’ bedroom that I found the most strange. I hadn’t been in there often. In fact, I couldn’t recall a time that I had. Despite that, the layout felt strangely familiar. I could swear I’d been there before, I just didn’t know when. I went over to my dad’s side of the bed, opening the nightstand absentmindedly.When I did, I saw something inside; An envelope with my name on the front. Inside was a letter, the paper yellowed from age. When I opened it, a scrap of paper fell out. I didn’t bother to examine that until I read the contents of the letter. They were as follows:



James,



I don’t know when or if you’ll be getting this letter, but I figured by now you ought to know the truth, at least as I know it. Your mother and I bought this house before you were born, and truth be told I don’t know why. I hate the countryside, and neither your mother or I are from the area. Despite that, we’ve managed to call it home. 



You might be wondering why your mother acted so strangely when you were a boy, or why I would ever marry someone like her. The truth is, your mother used to be the most amazing woman I knew. She was witty, smart, and the best dancer I’d ever seen. Something in this place changed her, and I can only give partial answers as to why and how. A few months after we moved here, your mother began to hear whispers coming from the field in the backyard. I assumed she was just imagining it or trying to scare me, but it only got worse over time. She became more erratic and distant. Oftentimes at night I’d find her out of bed and standing in front of the meadow silently. I’d call out her name and she wouldn’t respond, I’d have to take her hand and drag her back to bed for her to leave. When I’d ask her about it the next morning, she wouldn’t know what I was talking about. 



It started happening during the day eventually as well. I’d find her in the kitchen or living room with her ear pressed up to the wall. One time I asked what she was doing and she only shushed me and said, “Can’t you hear it? The house is breathing. It’s just like you and me.” I decided to humor her and put my ear up to the wall too, only to hear nothing. I think the field was beginning to drive her mad.



The night it all changed was shortly after you were born. I woke up to hear you crying, turning to see that your mother was missing from bed again. I put you back to sleep and heard yelling coming from outside. I ran down to check the yard, only to find your mother screaming into the grass. The wind had picked up intensely, making her hair blow almost horizontal to the ground. I tried to stop her like I had before, but she smacked my hand away and started to run into the forest. All the while she kept screaming nonsense, things about the house and the woods. The only one I can remember clearly is what she said right before she disappeared into the forest, “It’s already inside.” She repeated it over and over until her voice faded away and left only the silence of the night. She didn’t come back for 3 days.



She came through the back door completely soaked, water trailing from her hair onto the kitchen floor in heavy drops. It hadn’t rained in days, and the nearest river was fifteen miles away. I remember the silence more than anything, just the sound of the water hitting the wood. I tried talking to her, asking her what happened. I got no response. I yelled at her to tell me what was going on and to stop all this, for your sake. She only stared blankly, like she was in a trance. She was never the same after that. She never joked, laughed, or danced. All she did was sit quietly or watch the tv. I don’t think she was even really watching it, she just wanted an excuse to not be bothered while she sat motionless.



Something in this place took part of your mother. I don’t know if it lives in the field, the woods, or somewhere else entirely. I don’t even know if there is a some”thing”, but whatever it is, it’s dangerous. It feeds off of the attention you give, taking parts of yourself with it. I thought it might have been over after it took part of your mother. I was even stupid enough to think that I could get it back somehow if I stayed. I should’ve left that night, put all of us in the car and never looked back, but I guess this place gets its roots into you one way or another.



I had almost forgotten about the whispering until you mentioned it that night, I suppose around that time the field got hungry again. For how I reacted I apologize, but you have to understand my concern. It ate away at your mother until there was barely any of her left, I didn’t want the same to happen to you. After I found you staring at the field like your mother, I tried to keep you away as much as I could. If you want to kill a tree, you burn the roots. 



I tried my best to shield you from what had happened, even if in the end I couldn’t completely. For that I am sorry. I’m only telling you this now because I don’t think it will matter anymore. Please do not come back to the farmhouse, do not go into the field and do not go into the forest. Don’t let this place embed itself in you like it did to me and your mother.



Love, Dad



When I finished the letter, I could feel my eyes welling up like they had at dinner when I was a small boy. If you’ve ever received life-shattering news, you might know the feeling. The feeling of your whole world being put into a new perspective, the light of your observation being brightened to reveal new truths. Only this was far more intense, more alien. So much of my childhood had been shrouded in mystery, and I’m sure my father meant for this letter to clear things up, but it only raised more questions. What happened to my mom? What was in the field? And, most importantly, where had my dad gone? The scrap of paper that fell out of the letter only confused me more.

 See, I have this strange habit. Whenever I’m writing the letter i, instead of making a dot I draw a small circle. I don’t know when it started, but I’ve done it all my life. I only say this because the note I found has this exact trace of my handwriting, only I didn’t remember writing it and certainly not putting it in an envelope:



“Find William in the forest.”



 William was my dad’s name. Again, I didn’t remember writing this, and I definitely don’t remember going into my parents room and putting it in the letter. I hadn’t even read this letter before, at least I don’t think I had. By this time the sun was beginning to set. I was in the same situation as my child self had been all those years ago; caught between two conflicting sets of instructions. I wasn’t sure whether to heed the warning of my father or to follow the command to search for him. I went out to the back porch, clutching the scrap of paper in my hand. Like my dad had done in my memories so many times, I scanned the tree line. The trees were a couple hundred feet away, but I still noticed something. The trees were blowing in the wind, only not in one unifying direction. It looked like they were all swaying in different directions, shifting slightly to one angle and then swaying the opposite way, like a rhythmic dance. 



Looking back at the trees, I felt that draw to approach like I had with the field so long ago. I don’t know if it was guilt or the field beginning to mess with me again, but in either case I decided to follow the latter instruction, slowly approaching the tree line. I had considered bringing my father’s pistol, an item I’d only ever seen him use once when a rabid coyote stumbled onto our property, but I got the feeling it wouldn’t be useful. I did take a flashlight I’d brought with me, although I didn’t think I’d need it considering how much daylight I had left. I walked through the now dead field, my shoes compressing dead dirt as I walked past it and into the forest. Once I reached the edge of the woods, I felt the wind die down. All the birds and insects stopped, and the trees ceased to sway. It was like the whole forest was holding its breath, waiting for me to come inside. I did, following an old dirt path that meandered through the woods. As I walked through the forest, I noticed it got dark a lot faster than the sun implied. I had to turn on the flashlight a lot sooner than expected, illuminated only by a small beam of light in front of me. The forest remained quiet, save for the sounds of twigs and branches moving and snapping. I got that uneasy, indescribable feeling of being watched, thousands of eyes peering at me. It felt as though they were all waiting for me to slow down just for a second, to slip up or let my guard down so they could pounce simultaneously. It took quite a bit of convincing myself to finally relax and dismiss the idea.



I stopped when I saw a large, rotted stump to my right. I sat on it to rest, shining my beam to look around. I could hear the snapping and moving of twigs, but wherever my flashlight landed everything stood completely motionless. I expected to at least see some swaying from a slight breeze, especially considering all the noise I was hearing, but nothing.



 I got up and kept walking for a while, until something far stranger than anything before happened. I came to a fork in the path, and heard something come from the left side.



“James.” It was someone calling my name. More specifically, it was my mother’s voice. I hadn’t heard it in many years, but it was just as I remembered. She was calling out in a soft tone I’d never heard her use before, or at least couldn’t recall. But, something about it was off, even absent the circumstances I’d heard it in. I heard her voice again, only louder and almost a falsetto,



“James.” I tried to trace the noise with my flashlight, but only settled on a tree a few feet to my left. That’s when I heard my name called again, angrier this time.



“James!” It was coming from the tree, as if instead of a plant my mother stood just a few feet away. Only, it didn’t feel like her. It wasn’t her tone, motherly and gracious. It was demanding, expectant, it did not want to give only to take. 



I had seen enough at this point and began to run back in the direction I came. I heard the tree call out again, even louder now. Other voices began to join it. I could hear my grandparents, my friends, my teachers, all shouting my name over and over from the forest. I got back to the stump, only to see that it was still on the right. I didn’t think I’d gotten turned around, but now I was panicking. My breathing was beginning to quicken, and I could see the branches of the trees start to bend towards me. They were reaching out, grasping for me as I ran again. The dirt beneath my feet was crumbling as the trees attempted to uproot themselves just to follow me. I came back to the same fork in the path, hyperventilating. I was ready to give up and charge in a random direction, but I saw something new out of the corner of my eye.



On the right side, an old man was casually strolling down the path. He was far enough away that his outline was very small in my vision and quickly disappeared. I couldn’t make out his face or much of anything else, but I felt the urge to follow him. I dashed down the right path, the trees, shrubs, and plants still calling my name. The wind became impossibly strong, the gust causing small debris to get into my eyes. It was as if the forest was breathing just as hard as me, exerting all of its strength to claim its prey. The shadows of the trees revealed by my flashlight bent towards me, every part of the woods clawing at me with the ire and hunger of a predator long forgotten. I ran through the forest, not stopping even when a branch cut my cheek. I’d catch glimpses of the man on the path ahead and go to him, running towards my hopeful salvation. Finally, I could see pale moonlight stream into the forest from the gaps of the treeline. The end was in sight, and the outline of the old house was right there. Once I dove past the treeline, it all ceased. The yelling stopped, the wind died down, and the birds began chirping again. The only evidence I had of my visit was the bleeding cut on my cheek. 



When I got back to the house, I read the letter over and over again and fell asleep in my parents’ bed clutching it. All the while, I could hear the house settling just as it always had; A shrill creak, followed by a heavy groan, almost like breathing. When I woke up to daylight streaming into the windows, it was gone. In its place was a small, handwritten note, “You will always be my son.” I felt my cheek with two of my fingers, only to feel nothing there. No blood rubbed off on them and I couldn’t feel the roughness of a cut. 



I thought a lot about what had happened the previous night, along with the night my mom and I left my dad behind never to be seen again. Just like my dad, my encounter left me with only half-answers. I think that night the field had wanted me, and my dad decided to give it him instead. Maybe that’s why I never thought about it again until now; it had been satisfied with him until it got hungry again. It called me back to feed on me like it had my mom, only it didn’t count on my father still being there to protect me. At least, that’s the version I like to tell myself.



There was never anything behind the voices whispering to me in the grass, no creature grasping at the ground or swaying with the wind. I was too focused on the mystery that I missed the danger right in front of me. The field was just the edge of the danger I’d been obsessing over, the mouth that drew its prey into the throat of that place. Most of my childhood, I’d lived on the tongue of a monster.



I don’t know if it was really my dad who saved me, or if it was something else entirely. Hell, it could’ve really just been an old man out for a night stroll that happened to save my life. But, I like to think it was him. After all, memories are as stratified as distant stars in the sky, you can connect them however you want.



I really shouldn’t be sharing this. Frankly, these roots are better off burnt to ash. But, I still can’t decipher what happened, even knowing what I know now. I thought that writing it all out might help, but I think I’ve just given that place another way to embed itself in me. Maybe I should let all of this go, like my dad said to. If you want to kill a tree, you burn the roots. Only, when you burn roots you kill whatever they’re entangled in too. In my case, that’s everything I know. I now realize that I only remember what the field wants me to remember, that’s why I could recall so little of my childhood except for those exact vivid moments it wanted me to. Even now, far from the woods, I sometimes hear the trees calling my name. I still see tall figures standing motionless at the forest’s edge, just watching, swaying with the breeze. Late at night, I get that memory of my father talking to me on the porch again, even though I know we never had one. The field is still hungry, and it wants its prey back.



The next time you’re in the woods, and despite being alone you feel as though you’re being endlessly watched, you just might be right. Whenever you get that feeling, that impending sense of dread that something right under your nose is waiting to strike, try to see the trees for the forest.
