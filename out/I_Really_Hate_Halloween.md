( Happy Early Halloween)


The night I truly disliked the most was Halloween. I couldn't stand seeing little kids running down the street in silly costumes.

I also found it frustrating how people would practically worship candy for an entire night when it could be purchased from the store any day of the year; it was nauseating.

While my neighbors were putting up fake cobwebs and hanging cute pumpkin string lights, I usually stayed inside my house.

I would sit in my living room watching TV or reading an engrossing book, pretending that the Halloween-themed world outside didn't exist.

As the world outside became chaotic with trick-or-treating and scaring themselves with fake decorations, I felt safe at home.

Suddenly, my doorbell rang, and I muttered under my breath. I had turned off my porch light—didn't those kids understand what that meant?

I tossed my book onto the couch, stood up, and marched to the front door, ready to tell those costumed children a piece of my mind.

When I opened the door, I was prepared to shout, but I found no one there, prompting another growl from me.

"Great, ding-dong ditching," I muttered.

I was about to slam the door, thinking it might scare off the little pranksters, when I noticed something.

On my welcome mat lay a letter in a sleek black envelope.

I looked around to ensure no one was lurking nearby, wondering if this was some Halloween prank.

I carefully picked up the letter and walked back inside, closing the door behind me.

In better light, I examined the mysterious item.

I could see the black envelope clearly, but it lacked a return address; it simply had my name written on it in bold white marker.

Despite my urge to tear it in half, curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to open it.

That's the frustrating aspect of being human: when your brain urges you to do something you don't want to, you often end up doing it anyway.

I ripped open the envelope and pulled out a heavy cardstock invitation, surprised by what it said.

"Dear Thomas Crawford, you have been cordially invited to an exclusive Halloween party at Blackwood Manor. This year, things will be very different, and the party will begin upon your arrival."

I read the letter again and noticed it lacked a date or time; it was just a random note sent to me.

Blackwood Manor was an old, abandoned estate on the outskirts of town.

Everyone in the neighborhood claimed it was cursed, haunted, or simply too old to bother with.

I never believed in such nonsense; I knew Blackwood Manor was just a dilapidated place I passed on my way to work, wondering when someone would finally tear it down.

Yet, a shiver—more one of annoyance than dread—ran down my spine, and I dropped the letter to the ground.

This had to be a prank, and I knew who was behind it: my foolish friend Mark.

He was aware of how much I loathed Halloween, and now he was pulling a prank to see how I would react.

I considered ignoring the letter altogether, but that little spark of curiosity in my brain urged me otherwise.

Besides, if this was Mark's Halloween prank, I could give him a piece of my mind.

Without another thought, I grabbed my keys, headed out to the driveway, and got into my car, setting off for Blackwood Manor.

The drive to the manor felt just as ominous as the letter, but fortunately, I had traveled this road many times before on my way to work, just never at night.

The trees appeared like skeletons clawing at my car, resembling monsters.

The road felt more uncomfortable than usual.

Was I going the wrong way, or was this just the Halloween spirit messing with my mind?

Soon, I arrived at my destination. Stepping out of the car, the massive silhouette of Blackwood Manor loomed against the night sky like something out of a horror movie.

The windows stared back at me like vacant eyes. I looked around and saw no other cars or lights.

Only a single flickering jack-o'-lantern sat on the porch, casting large shadows and making the place even creepier than it already was.

I realized Mark was going overboard with this prank, and I was determined to let him know when I confronted him and anyone else involved.

As I walked up the porch, I noticed a massive oak door slightly ajar.

Nervously, I pushed it open, and it groaned loudly on its ancient hinges. I stepped into the cavernous, dust-covered foyer.

The air felt thick and cold, filled with the scent of mold and forgotten things.

Moonlight streamed through a stained glass window above the grand staircase, painting the decaying floor in sickly colors that made me feel nauseous.

I looked around and still didn't see Mark or anyone else.

The prank was starting to get on my nerves; I envisioned slapping him across the face or punching him until his nose bled.

Suddenly, I noticed an antique writing desk in the center of the room, illuminated by a lamp that was already on for some reason.

Leaning against the lamp was another letter in a sleek black envelope.

I walked over to the desk and picked it up, noticing it was just like the letter from my house, with only my name written in white marker.

I tore open the envelope and pulled out the letter, unfolding it and noticing that the handwriting was different from the first one.

This time, the writing was sharp and elegant, but I could still comprehend its message.

"Welcome to Blackwood Manor, Thomas Crawford. The rules are simple: you must escape alive before midnight. Failure to do so means you will become part of the festivities... permanently. There are no safe zones, so your time starts now. Enjoy the ride."

Suddenly, I felt my blood run cold. 

I realized this wasn't Mark playing a silly Halloween prank; it was a random stranger trying to kill me.

At that moment, a deep, resonant gong echoed throughout the manor, making me jump. 

My heart raced in my chest.

I whipped around and I noticed an enormous grandfather clock nearby, its ornate hands pointing to ten o'clock.

Only two hours—I had two hours to escape. But what was I supposed to be escaping from?

My annoyance quickly turned into a chilling fear, and I realized I could try the easy way out.

I rushed to the front door and pulled on the doorknob, but it wouldn't budge.

Unlike when I arrived, it was now locked from the outside.

Then I remembered that, since Blackwood Manor was so old, I might be able to pop open a window and crawl through it.

I ran to the nearest window, which was covered in grime and cobwebs, but at that moment, I didn't care. 

I noticed screws sealing it shut, preventing me from opening it.

I cursed loudly, my voice sounding pathetically small in the vast silence of the manor.

Everything around me began to feel cold and painful because this wasn't a joke; this was real, and I was a victim trapped in it.

I decided to start my search for an escape and began walking, my footsteps echoing against the creaking floorboards, with every shadow twisting and stretching around me.

I ascended the grand staircase I had seen earlier, hoping the stairs wouldn't give way beneath me and send me tumbling into the basement.

Even the creaking sounds the manor made resembled creepy whispers or moans.

Upon reaching the second floor, I noticed that most of the rooms were simply old, decaying bedrooms, with an old ballroom in the center, its tattered curtains fluttering with an unseen draft.

As I climbed another staircase to the third floor, I found a dusty attic filled with moldy furniture, some pieces resembling slumped figures.

That was when I heard a faint thumping sound coming from somewhere in the room, and I froze, holding my breath until it suddenly stopped.

Then I heard heavy breathing that seemed to echo throughout the entire attic. 

My eyes darted around the dimly lit room until they landed on the source of the noise.

A hulking, tall figure stepped out from behind a stack of boxes, wearing a white expressionless mask and a dark coverall.

It was Michael Myers.

I felt my heart leap into my throat. This had to be a ridiculous Halloween costume, albeit a very realistic one, but the way he stood there, utterly still and silent, without saying anything, was chilling.

Then, without warning, he lunged towards me with a large hunting knife in his hand. 

I cried out in shock and fear and fell backward.

Somehow, I fell onto a couch in the attic. Looking up, I noticed Michael Myers standing over me, holding the knife above his head.

I curled into a ball, bracing myself for a hard, splintering stab to my chest, but it never came.

When I opened my eyes, I saw that Michael Myers was pulling on the knife, which had somehow gotten stuck inside the couch. Then, without another word, I slipped off the couch, and I bolted.

I ran down the stairs, my legs nearly giving out from under me, feeling scrapes and rustles, but I didn’t care as I descended the grand staircase—I knew that the second floor wouldn’t provide any safety.

I sprinted down the long hallway, searching for a back door, hoping these psychos had forgotten about it. 

I noticed the first room and burst through the door.

It wasn’t outside, but as I looked around, I realized it was the dining room. 

As I stepped in, I could see a long banquet table covered in more dust than décor.

Just when I thought I could take a break, I heard a raspy laugh coming from the table, and I gasped nervously.

"Welcome to your nightmare, Tommy Boy!" a voice exclaimed.

Sitting at the table was a man wearing a striped sweater, a fedora, and a peculiar glove with sharpened blades on it. 

This was Freddy Krueger. 

He was seated at the table with his feet propped up, and I couldn't believe this was happening. 

"What's wrong? Looks like you've seen a monster," he said, laughing. 

This was no joke; this was orchestrated terror. 

Suddenly, he stood up, and I yelped, stumbling away from the table as Freddy jumped up, his blades glinting in the faint moonlight. 

Then I had an idea. Despite the tablecloth being old, I picked it up and tossed it over Freddy like a blanket.

 I heard him cry out in rage as he thrashed around underneath the tablecloth. 

After that, I didn't stop to think. I turned around and ran out of the dining room, somehow ending up in the kitchen, rushing past a pile of rotting food and dirty dishes into another room. 

I bent down, breathing heavily, and noticed that this room smelled of decay and mold. I could hear various sounds coming from an open door: a loud cutting noise and a faint buzzing sound. 

Realizing I probably wouldn't escape this manor of nightmares, I decided to explore that room. 

When I stepped inside, I saw it was a place where people prepared meat to be cooked and made into dishes. 

I noticed two figures chopping and preparing meat. 

They didn't seem to notice me until suddenly they both looked up, making me jump. 

One figure was holding a machete and wearing a hockey mask; it was Jason Voorhees, who raised his blade and cut a hunk of meat off a piece he was working on at the counter. 

Then I heard the revving of a chainsaw. When I turned around, I saw the other killer, Leatherface, cutting up a large piece of meat that was attached to a chain. 

Immediately, both of them stopped what they were doing but didn’t drop their weapons. 

Without thinking, I rushed out of their strange meat-preparation room and slammed the door shut, leaning against it, gasping for breath. 

The door shuddered under a heavy impact, and I scrambled away. 

This wasn't just jump scares; this was a pursuit. 

These people, whoever they were, were playing for their sick entertainment. 

I ran back into the main hall, hoping I wouldn't encounter another horror movie killer. 

I considered kicking the front door down or throwing something at a window to break it. 

That's when I saw a small door by the staircase that I hadn't noticed before—perhaps a servant's entrance.

I rushed over to it but then hesitated; this probably led to the basement. 

What if I ran into Ghostface or even Chucky, that little evil doll? 

But maybe it was a secret escape. I opened it, no longer caring, and plunged into the darkness beyond.

The passage continued to descend into complete darkness, and my hands were feeling along the damp and rough wall.

The air was growing colder, and I could hear the sounds of weapons, laughter, and footsteps; those maniacs were after me, and I couldn't do anything when they caught up with me.

I felt like a helpless animal caught in a hunting trap. 

I was breathless and soaked in sweat, and my mind was racing, trying to find an escape from this terrible place.

Suddenly, I heard a familiar gong through the walls; it was the grandfather clock indicating it was half past eleven. 

I had thirty minutes to escape.

When I reached the end of the passage, I thought this was it, but the wall opened like a large stone door, and I stepped into what appeared to be a cellar.

This place was even colder than the manor. It had dirt floors and stone walls, and I noticed barrels and boxes covered in cobwebs.

In the very center, there was a faint beacon of hope—a rusty iron door, slightly ajar, with a sliver of moonlight spilling in. Freedom.

A surge of desperate hope coursed through my body. 

I didn't care if this led to a sewer or something else; I just wanted to go outside.

I started running; my legs burned as I pushed through the heavy iron door, which opened with a groan, revealing a small, overgrown courtyard.

I felt the fresh, blessed autumn air hitting my face and filling my lungs. 

I stumbled out, immediately fell to my knees, and began breathing heavily. I was safe.

I made it. 

I had actually escaped that hellhole.

Sitting there on my knees for a long time, shivering in the cold, I reflected on everything that had happened, but I also thought about how I was alive and how the moonlight shone brightly, silently witnessing my escape.

Suddenly, a slow clapping broke my happy silence.

I got up from the ground, my body begging for a break, and then I looked around the courtyard, which wasn't entirely outside.

The high walls of ivy-covered brick enclosed it, but I finally noticed a fancy archway leading somewhere else.

I approached the archway and walked through, expecting to see more of the overgrown courtyard.

But instead, I saw a perfectly manicured garden bathed in soft, warm light from lanterns hanging in the trees, and beyond that was a grandly lit banquet hall.

When I entered that area, I noticed the same table I had seen in the dining room; this one was perfectly polished and dust-free.

Then I saw about a dozen different people, all dressed in the fanciest tuxedos, evening gowns, and glittering jewelry.

The table was laden with every kind of food and drink one could imagine, all untouched, and I didn't know what was happening or if I was dreaming.

The people sitting at the table looked at me, and one by one, they removed their masks.

 Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Jason, Leatherface.

All the iconic villains who had terrorized me. Beneath the masks were familiar faces—stern, aristocratic, entirely human.

They regarded me with an odd mixture of approval and hunger. 

I didn't know how they had changed their clothes, but I didn't want to ask.

At the head of the table sat a beautiful older woman wearing an emerald gown; she took a sip from a wine glass.

She then looked up at me with a cruel, elegant smile and placed her wine glass on the table.

"Well, welcome, Thomas. Happy Halloween! I see you passed the test, and just in time too... midnight would have been inconvenient," she purred with a sickly sweet voice.

She gestured to an empty chair at the very end of the long table, a place setting laid out just for me. 

My eyes caught the name card: The Initiate.

"You see, young man, tonight we all celebrate your initiation. Our game, or escape, was merely a test. We've been looking for someone with your particular mixture of fear and tenacity—someone who truly understands the raw terror we crave," the woman explained.

My blood ran cold, but this time it was a permanent feeling in my bones because this was far worse than I could have imagined.

I wasn't escaping Blackwood Manor; I was becoming a permanent part of it—possibly forever.

"Now, Thomas, get ready because the real party starts now, and you, our dear Initiate, are going to be the best host we've ever had," the woman said.

She then picked up her wine glass, and the rest of her companions followed suit, their eyes gleaming red.

Now I really hated Halloween.
