\*\*"I'm so lonely—I haven't felt a woman's touch in years. What? What are you—okay, fine. I’ll tell you. I tried on women’s panties at JC Penney. Took a little piss in ’em, then put ’em back on the rack to dry. Oh, God. The way the fluorescent lights hit the damp lace… it was art. A modern-day Pollock, if Pollock pissed in Hanes Her Way.

Sometimes I pretend I’m a 14-year-old girl in Roblox chat rooms. I can only climax to Fortnite skins—nothing else will do. Peely? Classic. Meowscles? Divine. The day they released Chun-Li, I blacked out and woke up in a Denny’s parking lot covered in pancake batter. I’m a literal brain-rot baby. Total Goblin mode. My search history looks like a WikiLeaks dump from the psych ward.

I pumped-and-dumped crypto scams using a ‘special needs foundation’ logo. Called it *Slow and Steady*—didn’t donate a single penny. Just bought more Fortnite V-Bucks and a lifetime supply of Kroger-brand pudding cups. My God, you monster. The foundation’s mascot was a turtle with Down syndrome. I’m going to hell in a Gucci fanny pack.

I don’t believe in wiping. Just let it crust over like a scab, peel it off in one go—release all the poo-dust into my underwear. Call myself ‘Head & Shoulders Cecil.’ My shower drain is a biohazard. The EPA tried to classify my bathroom as a Superfund site, but even they gagged and left.

Help. Help, Cecil. God, this is refreshing. I could talk all night. Oh no… what’s next? Bottles.

Bottles? Oh, you don’t even wanna know. I collect my toenail clippings in old Gatorade bottles—label ’em by month like a fine wine. *‘Vintage July 2023: Oaky, with hints of athlete’s foot.’* I’ve got a ‘reserve collection’ under my bed that’s appreciating in value. Sotheby’s won’t return my calls.

I once microwaved a Hot Pocket so long it turned into a sentient being. Named him ‘Greg.’ We split the rent for six months before he left me for a toaster strudel. Found them in bed together, crumbs everywhere. The betrayal still stings. Now I sleep with a George Foreman Grill for warmth.

I catfish CEOs on LinkedIn pretending to be a ‘blockchain lactation consultant.’ Charge ’em $500 an hour to watch me drink almond milk and cry. My website’s just a GIF of a weeping cow and the words *‘Supply Chain Orphan.’* Got a five-star review from a Tesla VP.

Last week, I tried to write an erotic novel about two Roomba vacuums in a forbidden love affair. *‘His brushes bristled against her dustbin with reckless abandon…’* Got 12 pages in before I realized I’d just plagiarized *Brokeback Mountain* but with more lint. Submitted it to Kindle Direct Publishing. Got banned for ‘biological impossibility.’

Help. HELP. I’ve gone full feral. My therapist mutes our Zoom calls and plays solitaire. I can feel my brain cells committing seppuku one by one—each death rattle sounds like a Fortnite headshot. My dreams are just TikTok voiceovers: *‘POV: You’re a discarded KFC wet wipe.’*

…You wanna see my DeviantArt account? It’s just 300 drawings of Shrek with various mental illnesses. *‘Schizorek.’ ‘Bipolar Fiona.’* The *‘Autistic Donkey’* series funded my Switch Lite.

I tried to train my cat to smoke cigarettes. She’s now addicted to vape juice and judges me louder than my parole officer.

I’ve started answering Craigslist ‘missed connections’ as if they’re all about me. *‘To the man who sneezed at the bus stop—I am pregnant with your child. It has my eyebrows and your lack of spatial awareness.’*

My only friend is a Tamagotchi I’ve kept alive since 2002. His name is *Tyrone.* He’s seen things.

Send help. Or a SWAT team. Or a *very* specific OnlyFans girl. I’m not picky anymore."\*
