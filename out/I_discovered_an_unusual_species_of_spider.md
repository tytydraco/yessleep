I hate spiders. 

Always have always will. Trouble is, my 13 year old sister Amber loves spiders. Some afternoons, she’ll drag me towards the forest near our backyard to look for them and observe how “adorable” they are. 

Today, I’m up in my room listening to music as I'm filling out my Environmental homework, when the door to my room busts open. Amber stands there in the door frame, her long and curly black hair falling in messy strands down to her neck. Her face is contorted into one of her signature toothy grins. She shouts  “you gotta see what I just found in our backyard! Let’s go, bro!”

I groan, knowing exactly what kind of thing she found in the backyard. But I can’t say no to that  silly grin and the look of joy on her face. I sigh under my breath but close my MacBook and begrudgingly follow her into the backyard, as always. 

She leads me past the back patio with the grinning pumpkins, and past the green bean plants and flowers prominently displayed. We enter the forest; where the leaves on the trees are now an assortment of oranges yellows reds and browns as opposed to the usual green.

Suddenly, she freezes. “Stop,” she commands. I look down and see why. There, on the ground, is a set of a dozen eggs no bigger than a marble that I could take them all out with one stomp. They were a hideous maroon color and surrounded by webs. The looked like cotton balls from hell. "Aren't they so cool?" she asks as she cups one in her hand. I cringe slightly. "We've *got to* take this little guy home," she says.

Ever since her pet tarantula, Fred, died 2 weeks ago she's been searching for a new spider. I give a thumbs up. As opposed as I am to the idea of having a spider in the house, it would undeniably make her happier.  "As long as you keep it in that tank and out of my room, that's fine by me." She rolls her eyes and begins picking up leaves and twigs for the spider's new home. We walk back into the house and she grabs the square fish tank she held the last spider in and the two of us bring it up to her room. 

Two weeks later, Amber shakes me out of bed. "wha is itttt?" I ask groggily. She shouts "It's hatched!" I rub the sleep out of my eyes and walk towards Amber's room. More accurately, Amber drags me to her room. She points to the spider in the tank. It was so tiny I could barely make out its features. The spider had a putrid looking, dark green, hairy body. I couldn't see its eyes.  "Look at the lil guy" she says. She presses her face up closer towards the tank and the spider walks toward it. It presses its tiny body against the glass, two legs extended, as though it's trying to get out. "What should I name you pal? Hmmmm. How about Bruce?" she asks the spider. She grabs the can of fruit flies she bought from PetCo, opens the lid of "Bruce"'s tank and places two in there. They buzz around lazily in the tank. I watch in disgust as Bruce stands still before lunging at one that flew a little too close to the ground. 

"So it's a jumping spider! Cool! Did you know that there's tons of different species of jumping spiders?" she asks.

"No, never heard of them," I reply. 

"They're fierce predators. Their main advantage is in their eyes. They have four eyes, and can see better than any other type of spider. Once those eyes lock on to their target, they, crouch ever so slightly, and then … *bam!* They lunge at the prey. They poison them and slowly disintegrate them with their acid as they eat" she explains as Bruce devours the writhing insect. 

"Cool," I mumble. I leave the room slightly unsettled, and go back to my rudely interrupted slumber.  

As the days and weeks go by during September Bruce grows, and by the time October rolls around he's about the size you'd expect a spider to be. The hair is more prominent. It's not like the smooth hair of a dog, and more like a hedgehogs quills. The hair protrudes from it's body and around it's legs. The body is yellow. By now I can make out the four large eyes on the ugly thing. It's eyes look just like the irises on a humans eyes with a pupil at their center, but they have none of the white surrounding them. On the sides of it's head are two other, smaller, eyes. Pretty innocent looking for a vile predator. It has graduated from eating fruit flies, and Amber's begun to feed it roaches. "This is probably about as big as it's gonna get," Amber tells me one day. 

But it keeps on growing. It's the size of a marble. Then a ping-pong ball. Then a tennis ball.

Almost every week the amount of food Amber feeds it increases. It keeps on skittering along the glass, demanding more. Its tank is covered in well-crafted webs that now ensnare its food. 

Halfway through October, when I'm helping Amber with history homework, it's about as big as one of my fists. I can see all the dark green hairs coming off of its sharp tipped legs. 4 of its eight legs have small spikes extending out from them. In front of its face are two massive parts of its mouth that Amber calls "chelicerae" that it holds the roaches in. After Amber gave him his food, the silent hunter just stares blankly with those 4 eyes. Creepy. I wonder if that's the same look its prey saw as it lunged towards them. It's getting uncomfortable to stay in the same room as Bruce, even with him stuck in the tank. Amber doesn't seem fazed at all by Bruce's massive size (by spider standards). She turns to me and says "Look at how adorable those eyes are! He's so cute!" 

"I don't see it. He creeps me out" I tell her. 

Once we complete the history homework I leave and head to the living room when I hear the sound of shattered glass coming from Amber's room.

My imagination swims with all the possibilities as my body move on autopilot up the stairs. How'd it get out? How much damage can it do to Amber? Did it already poison her and she's just paralyzed and can't scream? 

I trip up the stairs, costing me precious seconds. I swing the door open to her room, and see the spider crawling across the desk, and notice the medium sized glass hole he must have created with his legs. To my relief, Amber looks fine. She's caught off-guard but she still reaches her hand out for the spider. 

"Amber, careful!" I shout. 

"Relax, he's not gonna hurt me." She turns back towards the spider. "Let's get you in your cage little guy."

I decide to trust her. The spider crawls across her fingers slowly. It enters her palm then stands still. Then, in a split second, he lunges towards Ambers arms, and bites down.

Amber screams in terror and pain. Tears are streaming down her face as I frantically search for something to get the spider off of her. Tweezers aren't enough for that thing. The area around where the spiders biting is turning black under her skin; the veins, more apparent than ever, look purple. Clock's ticking. Giving up on an efficient solution, I grab my phone on the dresser and whack the spider on the side. It slides off and thuds to the floor, before scurrying out of the room. 

I go towards my sister, who's lying on the ground clutching her arm and wailing in agony. I call 911 with trembling hands. I'm barely coherent as I explain the situation, but they seem to get the gist and say they'll send an ambulance over. 

I have no idea what to do. No medicine we have can help her. I hold her hand and attempt to console her. "It-it'll be alright sis. I-I got an ambulance on the way" I say weakly. 

She nods and her sobs die down slightly. 

"Come on, I'll help you get to the living room." I take her good arm and throw it over my shoulder and we head towards the living room.

When the ambulance comes they rush her out on a stretcher and put her into the ambulance as I sit down by her side. It's a long ride. I try to hold back my sobs all the way through. They give her some shots and medicine, but despite their best efforts, nothing seems to be working. 

When we get to the hospital she's turned a sickly shade of pale. Her hand is becoming colder. The hospital staff contact our parents, who were out at dinner for the night. In the hospital, she's placed on one of the beds in the emergency room. When my parents arrive, the staff tell us their verdict.

"Your sister Amber will survive, but her right arm is paralyzed, and will likely never function again. She'll need to stay at the hospital for at least 3 weeks to recover. By the way, what sort of snake bit her? Those bite wounds are huge."

After visiting hours, my parents take me back home. It's a very silent car ride. 

*Oh shit! The Spider!* Bruce was still somewhere in the house, scurrying around. I interrupt the silence and tell my parents about the spider. 

We hunt it down as we arrive home armed with fly swatters. There's thick webs all over the house. But no sign of the spider. After 11, I'm too exhausted from the whole night to continue, and I collapse on my bed. Sleep doesn't come easily.  Every little noise I hear makes me paranoid; my mind keeps mistaking each sound for the tiny clicking noises Bruce makes as he moves. Who knows where that damn thing is? It could grow more the longer we wait. But I fear of it finding us first. When those 4 eyes stare at me again, I'll be no safer than the cockroaches trapped in its net.
