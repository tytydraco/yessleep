Max was a normal boy living in the suburbs, but everything changed on a rainy night when his parents had to rush to the hospital to take care of his grandmother. Alone at home, Max had no idea of the horror he was about to face.

Hungry, Max decided to heat up the lasagna his mom had left for him. He preferred eating in his room since his parents weren’t home—normally, they wouldn’t allow it. Max microwaved the food, grabbed a soda, and headed upstairs.

While eating, he noticed someone outside his window, watching him. The figure wore a hood that completely concealed their body, and their face was impossible to make out. Max grabbed his phone to snap a picture, but by the time he was ready, the figure was gone. Shrugging it off, he finished eating and fell asleep.

The next day was a sunny Saturday. Max noticed a list of chores his mom had left on the fridge:

1) Mow the lawn.
2) Water the plants.
3) Do your homework.

After breakfast, Max started working on the chores. While mowing the lawn, he couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. "Maybe I’m just paranoid because of that hooded figure last night," he thought.

When he finished, Max went to the kitchen to make a sandwich. As he prepared it, he turned on the TV, which was already on the news channel.

"URGENT: More disappearances reported in the city. If you know anything, please call 888-666," said the local reporter.
"Oh my God, you have to believe me! I saw it! That thing wasn’t human!" exclaimed a supposed witness.

Max’s stomach churned. "Great. My parents leave, and this happens," he thought anxiously, recalling the figure from the night before.

Max decided to shower and then finish his schoolwork. By the time he was done, it was already dark, and he was starving. He decided to order a pizza.

Just as he was about to dial on his cellphone, the landline rang. Max hesitated but eventually answered.
“Hello?... Who’s there?”
Silence.
“I said… who’s there?”
No one responded. He decided to ignore it and placed his order instead.

"One large pepperoni pizza for ****** Street, house **, please."
"Got it. Your order will be ready in 30 minutes," replied the worker.

As Max waited by the door, the phone rang again. He answered it once more, but this time, a voice whispered from the other end:
"Look at me... I’m at the window."

Max turned around slowly and saw the most horrific and repulsive thing anyone could imagine.

A creature, a grotesque hybrid of human and pig, stared back at him through the glass. Its pink skin glistened, its pig-like ears twitching slightly. It had no eyelids—or maybe its wide, staring eyes simply made them impossible to see. Its eyeballs were yellow, and its pupils burned red. The glass fogged up with every raspy breath it exhaled.

Max ran upstairs, terrified, and locked himself in his room. He hid in the closet, tears streaming down his face as he dialed his parents. No answer. He realized his phone had no service. Curling up in a fetal position, he sobbed quietly until he heard a knock at the front door.

Still trembling, Max forced himself to go downstairs. He placed his shaking hand on the doorknob and opened it. The pizza had arrived.

The delivery car was parked outside, but it was empty. Blood was smeared across the driver’s seat.

Panic surged through Max, and he bolted back into the house. This time, he grabbed the landline to call the police.

Just as he dialed, a foul breath warmed the back of his neck. He froze. Slowly, he turned.

It was there.

The creature stood just inches away. Its stench—a mixture of metallic blood and rotting flesh—was overpowering.

Max ran to his room, the creature chasing after him. He barely managed to slam the door shut and secure it with a flimsy latch.

"Come on, kid," the creature growled in a deep, guttural voice. "I know you’re in there. Let me in… I promise it won’t hurt… much."

The creature started pounding on the door, each blow stronger than the last. Max hid in the closet, trying to control his breathing.

The door finally gave way with a deafening crash. Heavy breathing filled the room.

The closet door creaked as the creature’s deformed fingers brushed against the wood. Max held his breath, but his pounding heart echoed in his ears. Surely, it would hear him.

In the distance, the sound of police sirens grew louder. It was the only sound left. Heavy footsteps retreated, announcing the creature’s escape.

A neighbor, alarmed by the earlier screams, had called the police. Perhaps they’d heard the delivery driver’s final cries.

When the police arrived, there was no trace of the creature or the driver. It was classified as another disappearance in the area.

Of course, no one believed Max. They were ready to send him to a psychiatric ward, so he changed his story.
"It was a person… wearing a pig mask. They killed the pizza guy, and I hid inside. I’m sorry for lying. My mind played tricks on me."

The disappearances stopped after that night.

But Max was never the same. Nightmares haunted him. He kept asking himself the same question:
Was it real?
