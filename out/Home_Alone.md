It was a stormy, cold night. Nicolas was pretending preparing to go to bed. He lived in a house far from civilization, surrounded by miles of dense forest. His parents had gone to the movies, leaving him alone at home. At 14 years old, they figured it was time for him to learn how to handle things on his own—even during a storm. 



Nicolas wasn’t afraid of being alone; he considered himself mature for his age. But there was one thing he feared above all else: clowns. To him, clowns were deeply unsettling, a grotesque mix of exaggerated cheerfulness and something sinister lurking beneath the makeup. 



He was watching a horror movie in the living room, feeling that the storm outside added to the spooky atmosphere.Suddenly, the power went out, plunging the house into darkness. Startled, Nicolas froze for a moment, his heart pounding. But storms were common in the region and, so was the occurrence of the lights going out.  



Because of that, a flashliht was always kept in the living room. Reaching for the flashlight, beside the TV, he stumbled and bumped into the furniture before finally grabbing it.   



With the flashlight beam guiding his way, he made his way to the kitchen, where the house’s generator was located. Just as he reached for the switch, a noise came from outside. It wasn’t just the sound of rain or wind; it was something deliberate, something out of place. Nicolas hesitated but couldn’t resist his curiosity. Slowly, he approached the back door, which led to the yard. He unlocked it and opened it a crack, peering out into the storm. 



The scene outside was eerie. The silhouettes of trees swayed in the wind, and raindrops glistened as they fell. A sudden flash of lightning illuminated the forest for a split second, and that’s when Nicolas saw it: a figure standing among the trees. It wore colorful, tattered clothing, and in its hand, something metallic glinted in the brief flash of light—a knife. Nicolas’s stomach dropped. He couldn’t make out the face, but the next lightning flash revealed the unmistakable painted grin of a clown. 



The figure began to move, slowly at first, then with each flash of lightning, it was closer, closer. By the time Nicolas snapped out of his terrified trance, the clown was sprinting toward him. Nicolas slammed the door shut and locked it, his breathing ragged and shallow. He heard the clown pounding on the door, rattling it with inhuman strength. Then, silence.   



Nicolas’s mind raced. 



“Why it stop, wh- ? 



“Oh shit” 



“T- The front door  



“It still unlocked “ 



There was no time to secure it. Grabbing his phone, he bolted upstairs, taking two steps at a time. At the top, he risked a glance down—his breath hitched as a flash of lightning illuminated the living room. The clown’s shadow stretched ominously across the wall. 



Then came the crash. The front door slammed open, banging violently against the wall as the howling storm swept through the house. Rain lashed against the floor, the wind carrying an eerie chill. The intruder was already inside. 



Panicking, Nicolas darted into his bedroom and hid in the closet, crouching behind the hanging clothes. His breath was shallow, his pulse thundered in his ears. The house was deathly silent except for the faint creaks of floorboards as the intruder moved around. Then, the steps grew louder, heading up the stairs. Nicolas froze, peeking through the slats of the closet door as the clown entered his room. 



The clown’s grin was grotesque, smeared red paint giving it a savage, predatory look. It searched under the bed, behind furniture, its movements slow and deliberate. Nicolas held his breath, willing himself not to make a sound. After what felt like an eternity, the clown left the room. 



Shaking, Nicolas grabbed his phone out of his pocket and dialed 911. 



“911, what’s your emergency?” a calm voice answered. 



“H-Hello? There’s someone in my house,” Nicolas whispered. 



“Okay, stay calm. Can you tell me your name?” 



“It’s Nicolas,” he stammered. 



“Alright, Nicolas, help is on the way. And they will be there soon. Just stay on the line and keep yourself safe.” 



“It’s a clown,” Nicolas blurted. “He has a knife. I think he He’s downstairs. 



“A... clown?” 



A small silence followed 



“He has a knife. He’s downstairs, I think… Oh no, he’s coming back!” 



The operator’s voice remained steady. “Listen to me, Nicolas. Stay as quiet as you can. Help is almost the-.” 



The pounding footsteps grew louder. The closet door burst open, and the clown yanked Nicolas out by his hair. It flung him to the floor—but not before slashingit his face and back. The blade cut deep, but not enough to reach any vital part. Pain shot through Nicolas, leaving him momentarily stunned and struggling to move. 



Nicolas hit the ground hard, the breath knocked from his lungs. Before he could react, the clown was on top of him, its gloved fingers tightening around his throat. He thrashed, gasping for air, his vision blurring as sheer panic took hold. 



“I - it’s smilling. Its smilling at me. Its trying to kill me”  



Desperate, he kicked and clawed, his fingers scrambling for anything—then, with all his strength, he grabbed the clown by its collar, yanking its face inches from his own. Without hesitation, he drove his thumb deep into its eye. A guttural scream tore through the room as the clown recoiled, clutching its face in agony. 



Nicolas didn’t hesitate. He scrambled to his feet and sprinted down the stairs, bursting through the front door into the raging storm. 



 



Rain lashed at his face as he ran blindly into the forest, branches clawing at his skin. Behind him, he could hear heavy footsteps and the clown’s ragged breathing. Lightning flashed, and he caught a glimpse of the clown’s colorful suit, closer than ever. The knife glinted again, but the clown was stumbling, clearly struggling to see with its injured eye. 



Just as Nicolas thought he couldn’t run any farther, he heard the distant wail of sirens. Red and blue lights flickered through the trees, giving him a surge of hope. He sprinted toward them, ignoring the pain in his legs and the pounding in his chest. Breaking through the treeline, he stumbled onto the road, directly into the path of a police car. 



The vehicle screeched to a halt, and officers rushed to Nicolas’s side. The car’s headlights illuminated the scene, their bright beams catching the deep red stains soaking through the boy’s clothes. 



One of the officers scooped him up carefully, carrying him to the patrol car. Nicolas’s body felt heavy in their arms, weakened but alive. They placed him gently in the back seat, urgency in every movement. 



Just as they were about to drive away, a piercing scream shattered the storm’s howl. It was guttural, raw, and loud. The officers froze, their eyes locking for a moment that seemed to stretch into eternity for Nicolas.  



 “We will be back soon” one of them ordered as they ran into the woods around the house, guns drawn. 



“N-no, wait, please” 



It was too late, They were already far away from the car.  



Nicolas sat in the backseat, trembling and soaked. Minutes passed in agonizing silence until gunshots rang out, echoing through the forest. Then, nothing. The quiet was almost worse than the noise. Nicolas leaned forward, trying to see through the rain-streaked window. 



Out of the darkness, the clown emerged, dragging something behind it. As it stepped into the light, Nicolas’s blood ran cold. The clown was holding the severed heads of one of the officers, his faces frozen in terror. It turned its gaze to the car, locking eyes with Nicolas. 



Panic surging, Nicolas remembered his father’s driving lessons. He scrambled into the driver’s seat, started the engine, and floored the accelerator. The car hit the clown head-on, knocking it into the mud. Without looking back, Nicolas sped toward the city, gripping the wheel tightly, his small frame barely reaching the pedals.  



He drove, and drove, the rain blurring the windshield and the headlights barely cutting through the dense storm. His hands trembled on the wheel, his breaths shallow and uneven. And then, just like that, everything went black. 



Nicolas drifted between consciousness and oblivion, the distant murmur of voices mixing with the sharp wail of sirens. A dull, throbbing pain pulsed through his body, anchoring him to reality as he realized he was no longer behind the wheel. Firm, practiced hands moved with urgency, securing him to a stretcher. The world around him felt dreamlike—flashing lights, blurred faces, and hurried movements blending into a disorienting haze. It was as if he had escaped one nightmare only to wake in another. 



As paramedics carefully lifted him into the ambulance, a fragile sense of relief began to settle. It was over—finally over.  



As the ambulance doors started to close, however, his gaze wandered past the medics and into the stormy darkness beyond. There, at the edge of the tree line, illuminated by the flickering red and blue lights, stood a figure. The unmistakable red outfit clung to its form, its face obscured by shadow. In its hands, it held something.
