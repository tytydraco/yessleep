I haven’t slept in three nights. Every time I close my eyes, I hear the chittering again. This wet, awful clicking sound. The rattle of legs scraping across wood. And when I wake up, I smell her blood, still feel it on my hands.

I know how this sounds. Everyone thinks I'm just another camper out in the sticks claiming they saw something unnatural. But it's true. I hope you believe me. I hope you never make the same mistake as me. I hope...I hope you don't forget her.

Her name was Katie. She was my best friend and I’d known her since we were eleven. We both needed to get the hell out of Atlanta for a while, so we planned a weekend off-grid—no phones, no distractions, just a couple days out in the wild with a cooler of beer and a two-person tent.

You know, that trip everyone talks about taking but few people ever make the lunge for it? Well, we made the lunge. She was fresh out of a bad break-up. I was fresh out of a job. We had everything to lose and nothing to gain. So we went for it.

We picked a spot on a map near Chattahoochee National Forest but hiked further off any established trail. I don't know why. She was brave and adventurous and pretty. I've always had a hard time telling her know. Still, I’m talking hours deep into green nothing. We set up camp by a creek, cracked open a couple drinks, and listened to the frogs and cicadas take over the world.

That first night was perfect.

The second wasn’t.

It started with a sound outside of the tent. I thought it was rain at first, but it was too rhythmic. Tap-tap-tap. I sat up in the tent. Katie was still asleep, curled into her sleeping bag. Was it a raccoon? I unzipped the flap and poked my head out.

Nothing.

I went back to sleep. I shouldn’t have. Twenty-twenty, right? 

The next morning, everything was fine. I forgot about the sound completely and our day stretched out, totally normal. Around noon, we found a trail we hadn’t seen before. It was just a narrow little cut between the trees, half-overgrown and lined with old deer tracks. We followed it. About twenty minutes in, we found the cabin.

It looked abandoned. Hardly anything more than wooden slats peeled up, roof sagging, a rusted buck trap hanging from a hook on the porch. 

“Hello?” Katie called.

I wanted to turn back. I really did. But she pushed the door open and I followed her, because that's just what I did. Everyone has that friend, right? The one we would follow to the ends of the earth. The one we wish was more than a friend.

Inside, the air was wrong. Thick, like it was full of hair. Dust floated in lazy spirals. The walls were lined with old hunting trophies. A bear skull. Antlers with strips of dried velvet still hanging off. Empty glass jars. Something clattered in the back room.

"Someone's here," I hissed. "We should go."

“Probably an animal,” Katie said. She walked over to a counter, picked up a dusty mason jar. It had a strange almost purple liquid in it. "What do you think this is, detergent?"

"Katie." The sound came from the back again, and then there was a massive shadow. It stretched out into the hallway like it didn’t know how to keep itself small. I can’t describe it exactly. It had legs, too many of them, and a body like wet leather and something human-shaped where a head shouldn’t be.

It moved fast. It moved so damn fast.

It hit Katie first.

She didn’t even have time to scream. One second she was behind me, and the next, she was on the floor, her legs kicking, her throat wide open. Blood hit the walls, my hands, my pants. It was *everywhere*.

I bolted out the door, down the trail, through the trees. It followed me, the chittering constant and loud. I don’t know how long it chased me, only that when I got back to the creek, it was gone. I wondered if it was unable to cross the water, briefly, then collapsed and vomited until I saw stars.

I made it to the ranger station the next morning.

They said they searched. Said they found blood near my old campsite, but no body. No Katie. No monster,

They think I killed her. I can see it in their eyes. They’re just waiting for me to slip.

But I didn’t kill her.

The thing in the cabin did.

I just wanted someone else to know. And...hey. If you've ever seen something like that in the woods...just know you aren't alone. I believe you.
