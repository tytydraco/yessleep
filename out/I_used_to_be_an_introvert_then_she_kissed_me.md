It all started with—I’d say not jealousy, but competence. I was friends with this guy whose nicknames were "Life of the Party," "Party Animal," "Restless Chatter," among others. And not just him, he had a gang. All of them were part of a town-based band that was quite popular as well.

Once, with the same Party Animal, I went to a party. It was far more terrifying for me than a nightmare or witnessing a ghost itself. He'd just crash into anyone, talk like he knew them for years. While me—I was that quiet mannequin that was trying to avoid the truth of being around so many people. And then, yet again, a woman with a lot of mascara applied on her eyes and big fingernails, who had been observing me for a while, asked him, "Hey, who's that guy you brought with you? Try removing the duct tape off his lips, haha. Or should I?" And that was it. My heart pounded. I didn't intend to stand, but my feet stood on their own, and my embarrassed brain walked itself out.

Deep down I had this longing since childhood. I wanted to be like the outspoken, the celebrity-like attention that they would get everywhere they go. Perhaps people's questioning of my introversion played a big part in that. People would often ask me, "Why are you so quiet?" and it would just embarrass the shit out of me. I used to think that being quiet was abnormal and alien.

And then there's one more thing latched to quietness: shyness. Quiet people are mostly shy as fuck, and not just that—the feeling of getting rejected. The bloody fear of rejection. It hits hard and is like a big rock tied to your feet that wouldn't let you move ahead. These triad together destroy a person's social life. In short, they are curses of some sort. Although introverts do play a big part in the world, when it comes to being social, introverts are not anywhere close. They suck.

So these were a few feelings that were taking a toll on me. I had been finding ways—especially on YouTube—to become an extrovert by any possible means, or if there were some medications that may help. But none sounded promising. And it was frustrating. I left for the beach thereafter to find a tad bit of solace and hope.

That day, the beach wasn't crowded like how it used to be. The air was cold, and an emptiness filled the space. Only the distant sound of sea waves was audible.

I was relaxing on my chair, talking to myself, mumbling the words I had in mind. I knew no one was around, and I was like, "Huh, it's not gonna work," "There's no solution," and "I think I'll remain an introvert for life, huh." And then, with the new strong sea current hitting my feet, a thought came into my mind: What if there's a way of getting rid of introversion? I was lost in thoughts, trying to find any possible way by myself. I'm a nerd, so I thought something might come up. The warmth of the sun and tiredness slipped me into a short nap, and with it, a dream.

In the dream, I was sitting in a crowded train. I could see a woman who looked in her 30s, with deeply applied mascara on her eyes and black nail paint. And then she took her tongue out and I woke up. The dream ended right there.

I woke up to see an eerily similar woman walking on the beach. She was quite far away.

I reached home late that day and slept a little while later, thinking about the dream and the woman I saw at the beach. It was not a coincidence. Something wasn't right. I recalled seeing that woman earlier, but I couldn't remember when or where.

Then I got a call from my cousin's father, and my introverted brain started preparing what to say, how to talk, and how to cut the call early. It was a big burden after all. He lives some 140 miles from here in a small town. He informed me about my cousin who had met with an accident. The chances of survival were slim. "Maybe you should come and say your last goodbye to him," said the father. I anyway didn't want to go, but I said yes all of a sudden. And that's because I needed to cut the call and end the discussion, because my introverted brain couldn't continue the talk and couldn't even say "No," because for an introvert, saying "No" is like climbing Mount Everest—and that too, twice in a single day.

There was no better option than a train. Flights don't go there; there's no airport. Trains and cars are the only options available.

I left by 9 PM. The platform was kinda foggy. There was no one around. It was eerily quiet, reminding me of myself, my very persona, and what most people find irritating about me. The haze was those unspoken words that never came out.

Then the train arrived. The door opened, and I entered. I saw one more person entering in unison with me, who was quite far from me but boarded the same train. My compartment was empty as well—just me and my thoughts, yet again reminding me of the emptiness I carried.

Then I heard footsteps—those with heels knocking against the metallic floor of the train. And with each step, my introverted mind was getting readied. Someone was coming, and my introverted self was making sure I was behaving well, sitting orderly. If my hands were orderly placed—as if I was being constantly watched. If only I knew that no one cares. People don't give a fuck, and so shouldn't I. But no, my brain just couldn't.

The woman approached me. She was tall—perhaps her sandals added to the height, but still. Black mascara spread across her eyes and quite beyond, as if she had been crying. She just kept walking towards me and took her tongue out when she was some four meters apart. The next moment she forcibly kissed me. It was with an immense suction force that she made me open my mouth. Then she did something to my tongue with her tongue. I felt a sharp pain on my tongue and swallowed a lot of blood. It would be wiser to say a pool of blood.

Then I woke up—at the same beach. I was shocked beyond belief. I'd been dreaming all along. It was eerily real. I couldn't fathom what was going on.

But something felt... different.

The next moment, my phone rang. It was my cousin's father with the same news. I was shocked to the core, but I don’t know why—I felt really confident talking to him. I was even escalating the conversation, even though my tongue was aching a little. I continued talking and even made him laugh. Twice. Then eventually I said, "No, I won't be able to come. Sorry." Meanwhile, I said that, I felt like my brain didn't want to, but some kinda force within me made me say "No."

And that’s when I realized: she wasn’t real. That woman—she was never anyone I’d met. She was me. A creation of my own longing. My desperate craving for freedom, expression, noise—personified. She had been forming in my dreams for days, bit by bit—mascara and nails and all.

That kiss... it wasn’t a kiss. It was a transfer. A surgical, dream-born ritual. Her tongue had sliced mine open, gently yet firmly replacing it with hers. She gave me her voice. Her boldness. Her chaos. Her gift.

I hadn’t become her.
But I wasn't just me anymore either.
