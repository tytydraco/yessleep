Men, women, children, Extraterrestrials, Big Foot, or anything else that can read this, please take a seat I have some things I must confess. Living in the town of Hidden Peak, we are as you might say hidden. Now Halloween may come around once a year for you, but in my town every day is Halloween. We get our fair share of visitors flocking to our small town, they all just love Halloween. Yet every year there is a decent amount of those visitors who do not return home, how unfortunate...for them hahaha.

I had to add that last bit in, if you didn't know I was laughing you might take me too seriously, and that would be...oh hold on a moment. A mob has descended on my castle, I must deal with these pesky humans. You caught that last bit didn't you, if you haven't realized it by now it is me **COUNT DRACULA**. 

Okay okay, you caught me, how and why would an all-powerful vampire decide to get on the internet and write things, I should rephrase I am playing *Count Dracula*. The pesky humans are paying customers who attend our theme park. Yes, the town Hidden Peak is inside of a theme park, I like to think of it as a real town.

We are located in the far northern corner of *Massachusetts*, and although I am merely playing a role I find myself taking on the *Dracula* persona. I was forced to stay home a week after the incident had happened, but I am much smarter now. 

When someone dies at a theme park, it is immediately bad press. I would get hundreds of Dracula-obsessed fans begging for me to bite them and turn them, they didn't care if I was fake. My extremely good looks and natural charisma were all it took to make them fall for me. At first, I was just biting them letting my prosthetic teeth barely poke their skin, it was more of a hickey than a bite. Once I began doing this a lot of them would seek me out for pleasure, I would suck on at least 50-100 necks a day. Now this part I loved, having hot young women grovel at my feet, begging me to suck on their necks, mmm delicious.

It wasn't until I met my match that things began to change for the worse, well in my case it was for the best. After I had finished the routine hickey of one gorgeous, big-breasted patron (sorry for the vulgar language but it is important to describe her best ass..ets.) She begged me for more, and I began to suck a little harder yet this wasn't enough. After her begging and the grip on my control slowly loosening it happened. It was as if my body was taken over, I used my prosthetics to rip on her neck until I was able to rip it open and expose her jugular. I should have gained control and stopped there, but it was as if I couldn't. I ripped her jugular out with my teeth and let out an evil malicious laugh. It wasn't until the scene turned into chaos I remembered I was not alone. I was apprehended shortly after. I was only in there for 2 hours due to the theme park's lawyers and my perfect record, they were able to pay the judge off and get me put on house arrest. I was only on it for about a week when they were begging for me back. They were able to isolate the incident and pretend she had not died. They twisted the story and made it seem as if we were working together and were both just employees at the park.

When I returned the patrons were lined up at my castle begging me to rip out their jugulars, what a cruel twist of her neck... I mean her fate. ;) That previous character signifies the wink I did in real life. Hahahahaha. Now of course I would never do something like that again, well at least not at the park. Now I can't say what has become of the patrons who enter my lair. My latest victim's picture showed up on the news this morning, the headline said "Day 4 of the search for 23-year-old Misty Owens" hahaha keep on searching I'm sure you will find her excuse me some of her soon. Now my next victim is seeking my attention, hmm it seems she was asking about our dinner plans tonight. And of course, I replied

*"I would love to have you over for a ..bite.."*

hahaha
