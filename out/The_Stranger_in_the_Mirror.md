I’ve heard of haunted houses. I’ve read stories about cursed objects. But I never imagined the terror of a haunted reflection.

It started last month, when I moved into my new apartment. It was nothing fancy, just a cozy one-bedroom place with old wooden floors and a large, antique mirror in the hallway. The landlord said it was "part of the charm." I never thought much of it.

At first, the mirror was just that—an old mirror. But soon enough, strange things started happening. When I walked by, I'd catch a glimpse of something in the corner of my eye. Not me—someone else. A figure, standing just behind me, barely visible, but there. I told myself it was a trick of the light or that my mind was playing games with me after too many late-night horror movies.

But then… it got worse.

One night, as I brushed my teeth, I noticed my reflection acting strangely. My movements weren’t perfectly in sync, like a delayed video feed. My reflection would turn its head a split second too late or hold eye contact for a moment longer than I did. I even noticed it blinked when I hadn’t.

I was frozen with fear, toothbrush halfway to my mouth. My reflection’s eyes didn’t move with mine; they were staring directly at me, as if it was… studying me.

I stepped back, but it didn’t. It just stood there, grinning.

I backed away, trying to calm my racing heart, telling myself I was just overtired. But as I reached for the light switch to leave, I heard it. A faint, raspy voice, like a whisper coming from the mirror itself.

“Don’t turn around.”

I bolted out of the bathroom and slammed the door shut, my heart pounding in my chest. I didn’t sleep that night. I couldn’t. I couldn’t stop thinking about what it had said.

Don’t turn around.

The next morning, the reflection was back to normal. I convinced myself it was a nightmare, a hallucination born from stress. But every time I passed that mirror, I felt it—an unsettling presence, just out of reach.

A few days later, I decided to cover the mirror with a sheet. Out of sight, out of mind. That night, I slept a little better.

But when I woke up, the sheet was gone.

And the mirror was closer. The antique frame had moved several feet down the hallway, as if someone—or something—was dragging it toward my bedroom.

That’s when I started researching. I needed answers, an explanation. I scoured the internet, searching for stories about haunted mirrors. That’s when I found an old forum post, buried deep within a thread about urban legends. Someone mentioned a mirror that could trap your reflection, leaving you to be replaced by… something else.

I didn’t want to believe it, but it all lined up. The whispers, the out-of-sync reflection, the shifting mirror—it all made sense. Or maybe I was losing my mind.

But then, last night, it happened.

I woke up around 3 a.m. to the sound of tapping. It was coming from the hallway. My heart raced as I crept out of bed and peered into the darkness.

The mirror had moved again. It was now right outside my bedroom door.

And my reflection? It was waiting for me.

But this time, it wasn’t mimicking my movements. It wasn’t even me anymore. The figure inside the mirror was taller, its eyes black and hollow, its skin stretched too tightly over its bones.

And it was smiling.

I screamed, slammed the door shut, and ran. I’ve been hiding in my bathroom for hours now, typing this out on my phone. I can hear the tapping again, coming from the hallway.

It’s getting louder.

If anyone reads this, please—if you ever find an old mirror in a new place, get rid of it. Smash it, burn it, whatever it takes. 

Because if you don’t… 

It might take you next.
