This all began because of bad tacos. Jeff and I agreed to meet at the movie theater around seven. However, the whole notion of surviving a two-hour film was sounding less appealing by the mile. We’d made plans at 10AM when energy and enthusiasm were boundless resources. 300 emails and a couple of pointless meetings later, all I wanted to do was to drag myself to bed.  It was as if some stranger agreed to go without my consent, and I was now stuck attending. Leaving work at six, between traffic and parking, I had 30 minutes to chow-down on fast food as I drove and called it dinner. Luckily, the drive-thru at the Taco Shack in the strip mall adjacent to my work was completely empty. Perhaps that should’ve been a warning. I didn’t heed it and pulled into the narrow lines of the to-go lane and placed my usual order.

A voice murmured back at me through the black box of infinity that was the speaker above the menu’s blinding lights. The order was ready at the second window, and I shoveled the greasy meal down my gullet like a fly trap, Mountain Dew acted as carbonated acid to dissolve taco meat I digested. Thirty minutes later, the downtown lights greeted me, glimmering at twilight through my windshield.

The first thing I spotted as I got close to the theater were light poles decorated with sparkling red confetti sashes. Turning down 17th Street, a Christmas tree loomed over apartments packed together tighter than ribbon on a gift. A sign above the main drag read “Season’s Greetings”. A better message would’ve been “There’s No Parking, Asshole.”

I started for the *usually* less packed industrial park after three laps around the main strip. Sure enough, a cramped spot was waiting for me. I parked and then clicked the lock on my keys. My boxy little car acknowledged the command, chirping. I didn’t realize how dark the sky was until I stepped out into the cold. Working in an office has a funny way of blinding you to the rapid descent into the hell known as daylight savings. You start your day in the black bracing cold of dawn and end it in nearly lightless dusk. Worse than the weather was my surroundings.

Back in the 1890s, the industrial quarter was a hub for meat packing and horse trade. You could still smell the ancient wafting scent of dung and cow guts that acted as a fetid history lesson on the city’s past. There’d been talk for a long time about revitalizing this side of town, installing cute coffee shops and trendy lofts to mask the distinct stench of economic downturn. None ever took. Folks didn’t want to live and shop in the same buildings where calf's gave their last whimpers to the cattle bolt a century past. I assumed the renovation was indefinitely delayed, based on a gaggle of polyester tents huddled together in a homeless encampment across from my car.

I clicked the car lock again.

A tropical storm churned in my stomach half a block away from the movies. It started with an acidic belch, *as it always does*. Mixtures of day-old ground beef and stale corn shells shoved seismic eruptions of disgusting flavor into my mouth as I closed in on the pink and blue neon lights of the theater’s box office. I waited patiently to purchase tickets as cramps slid knives into my gastrointestinal system. I checked my watch as I waited behind an indecisive teenage couple waffling about where to sit. I was running behind, confirmed by Jeff’s frantic text a second later.

“Dude, where are you? They just played the ad with that guy who's had too much Botox.”

My small intestine lept in a wave of nausea and pain. Whatever spawn my poor dietary choices conceived was on its way to being delivered, full grown and healthy. I needed to reach a porcelain operating room. Thankfully, the two teenagers finally decided on their seats. Front row, in case you were wondering.

I stepped up to be greeted by a dead-eyed wage slave manning the register. His nametag read, “Carl” and that his favorite movie was Dazed and Confused. A dull marijuana glaze coating his eyes suggested irony in the choice.

“Welcome to Cineplex, where you’re part of the movies. What are you seeing?” The kid asked through a microphone resembling an auditory silly straw.

“One for the seven o’clock.”

“You know that’s already started, right?”

I didn’t respond and slid him my Amex.

Moments later, I stepped inside the air-conditioned movie palace, greeted by a rainbow collage of blockbusters from summers past, complete with the frozen grins of the actors who’d starred in them. There was a self-importance to the place that clashed with a dingy flickering Space Invaders pinball machine wedged beside the snack bar and a butter station covered in a fryer’s worth of grease. Any notion of taking in the scenery was washed away with another errant cramp. I felt as though I’d tracked this turd since its inception, the accompanying bloat and gas pains giving a rough roadmap of how close I was to shitting myself while George Clooney and Halle Berry smiled down on me from the mural above. I showed my ID to the pimply usher at the security stand and half-jogged to the nearest restroom.

Now, I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve taken a dump in public past elementary school. It’s a phobia that can be traced back to the third grade. During a trip to the restroom at lunch, a tactless sixth grader had bellowed to me from the next stall over:

“Yo! You taking a shit or what?”

My face turned red, and embarrassment kept me locked in the stall for the rest of the lunch hour. I wish I could say one small childhood embarrassment hadn’t determined years of decision-making. I can’t. Going number two in a stall at school, work, or at a restaurant was off-limits from then on. On a few occasions, I would brave a public toilet, usually due to unforeseen circumstances like that night at the theater, and exclusively only for number one. However, when I did, I always expected to open the stall door and be met by a line of patrons Making matters worse, going at CinePlex was only slightly preferable to going in the woods during a blizzard.

I’d noted the state of the bathrooms the last couple of times at the theater. I have a bladder the size of a walnut, and inevitably, if the movie runs longer than two hours, I have to take an intermission. It wasn’t so much the state of the bathrooms themselves. They were clean enough. No, it was the ever-changing mystery of who the fuck you might be sharing them with that drove fear into my heart.

During my last visit to the lobby restroom, I’d walked in to find a question mark of a man with ratty matted black hair yanking all the paper towels out from the holders. The pale geezer took each roll of paper and stretched it out across the bowls of the sinks. The entire effort resembled a papier-mâché nest of toiletry arts-and-crafts. After I clocked the man, I’d kept my eyes narrowed to the ground, fearing eye contact would disturb the stranger. So, for an eternity I went at the urinal, all the while feeling his eyes burning two beady red holes into my backside. After a customary shake and flush, I decided it was best to forgo washing my hands and left.

Encounters like this weren’t uncommon at the theater.

CinePlex was a hub for the homeless. People migrated to it from the ruins of the industrial block seeking shelter. It made sense, I guess. 20 bucks was enough to buy a ticket which would allow anyone to hop between theaters endlessly - so long as they weren’t obvious. And, the homeless of the megaplex liked no place better to squat in than the restroom. Customers did complain about the problem, but there was little management could do unless there were drugs or weapons involved. People weren’t watching movies like in the halcyon days of the blockbusters in the lobby’s mural. A customer was a customer. Management wasn’t picky.

So, despite all the circumstances and past trauma screaming at me to “just hold it”  as I eyed the lobby bathroom that night, the violent roars of my gut were more convincing. My phone buzzed as another text came through as I approached the lobby bathroom.

“Trailers are almost done. WTF? This movie's supposed to be scary. I don’t want to see it on my own!”

My thumbs tapped out that I was hitting the head and would be there soon. I pushed past a patron wearing a green military jacket leaving the men’s room, and stepped into the yellow-tiled space.

To my relief, the bathroom was empty. The white trout-mouthed urinals were unmanned, and the sinks were clear, save for some soap and water mixing in their basins.

*No nests of brown paper towels.*

It must’ve been between showings, or maybe Thursday nights were slow. I thanked whatever god presides over the comings-and-goings of lavatories and darted for the stalls diagonal from me on the chessboard floor.

There were three toilets in the theater bathroom, each with their doors closed. They were tall gray structures with cheap plywood dividing them. The cubicles were completed with workman-like steel doors which would’ve fit more in a submarine than a John. They were all the same size, rectangular coffins of crap-dom that suffocated the occupant in whatever smells they unleashed into the room. My eyes locked on the area in-between the stalls chintzy walls.  It was a void of airspace above and below where the walls ended. Those open chasms unnerved me. Thoughts of an arm sliding underneath and grabbing at my ankles while I sat helplessly on the throne came easy. I flushed the nightmare away and bolted for the middle stall. However, I paused as I reached for the handle.

A shadow emanated from underneath the glow of the ceiling’s fluorescents.

I peeked at the floor below the door. Two heavy black boots spaced neatly apart came into view. Embarrassment shot through me worse than my dinner. I tried to slink away, but another buzz from my phone revealed my proximity to the door.

A dull coughing rose up from the middle stall and those elephantine boots shifted, soles scraping against the ridges of the floor tiles. There was something hypnotic about the black work boot’s raven shine. They reminded me of watching Frankenstein on my parent’s old VHS player. The grainy black-and-white monster shambling toward a poor blind man in the film, his oversized boots swallowing any color that dared to penetrate their surfaces.

I stepped back and opted for the last stall, unable to follow the unspoken rule of always choosing the farthest away toilet when going amongst men. The chosen commode wasn’t in bad shape, although a thoughtless bastard missed his mark trying to avoid the seat with his stream. I unrolled a bundle of toilet paper and wiped off the leftover urine, ensuring to separate contact by at least three plies. Finally, I sat down, and the eternal struggle that’s dogged men and women since the beginning of time began. And, of course, nothing happened. My pain was so biting I’d mistakenly expected the visit to be quick. There was a standstill within me and the pain pulsed endlessly without movement. I simply sat there, waiting for nature to take its course, watching my neighbor’s shadow clip through the stall divide between us. Another fit of coughing echoed out as my neighbor’s wheezing climbed in peaks and valleys, the sound of lungs pushing gobs of tar and mucus.

I needed a way to evacuate from this linoleum hell. Oddly, an article sprang into my mind: A ten-minute read about bathroom “life hacks” that claimed keeping your spine at a 90-degree angle would clear any blockage. I gave it a try.

Another wad of saliva hacked up on the sister side of the barrier, extinguishing any optimism with a cacophony of phlegm. My eyes panned to the stall’s steel door and latched onto the bumpy metallic pattern stretched across it.

*Pain skipped through my bowels*.

I had to keep my eyes moving and not focus on my spastic rumblings. I turned to the toilet paper roll. The cardboard corpse of the last reel held court over its still full brother like a vulture. Weakness left my stomach in radical fluctuations as my gaze fell to the pattern of the floor… and a bleached white hand that was outstretched through the gap between the stalls.

I blinked and expected the limb to vanish.  It remained.

A long hand hovered in my stall. The hand was so pale that it seemed corpse-like. Its nails were a sickly yellow which inferred advanced stages of rot and fungus dwelling beneath the cuticles. Under the stranger’s flesh, there was the turning of muscular minuscule bones, like pincers fighting under a blanket. The movements caused the flesh to roll like dough in a baker’s hands.

Two hard-edged and cracked words reverberated out of the next door stall.

“Paper, please.” A voice croaked.

The words might as well have been an alien language for how little sense they made in the moment. I curled up on the throne, paralyzed as logic tried to find its footing in reality.

*“Paper. Please.”* the words repeated to me.

My petrified reflexes tore the entire wad of TP from my roll and depleted the cardboard holder in seconds. I dropped the mess of paper into the elongated palm. The ropey hand grasped them and retreated back under the partition, a turtle's head slinking into its shell.

I stood up to run from my stall when a wetness between my cheeks compelled me to pause. Apparently, my previous constipation problem had come to an abrupt end. Fear does more for the belly than proper posture. Although, it surely won’t be included in any life hack lists.

Every fiber of my being begged me to rush out of the restroom with my jeans wrapped around my ankles like a member of the world’s most unsanitary chain gang. Instead, I fumbled for the remaining toilet paper next to me. A lone roll was left, and it was almost gone, too. Mental math concluded there would be enough to cover my mess, but barely. I yanked off a few plies and started when the voice from the next door stall rattled again.

“Paper, please.”

The stretched ashy claw was back with its fingers fixed out to accept a toll. I grimly looked down at what little toilet paper I had. I tried to ignore the voice and began to wipe.

The hook of a hand never moved, and that crooked voice crowed over: “Paper. Please.”

There was a stiff sense of malice clinging to the word *please* this time.

“I, I-,” the words clogged my throat. “I don’t have any annnymore.”  I shouted back, my voice reverting to a frightened third grader.

The monkey’s paw between the stalls curled up, wilting back. I held my breath, praying another request wouldn’t come. I slid my pants up, but my pale plastic seat slammed down with a reverberation so loud, I’m sure viewers in the neighboring IMAX theater probably heard it.

The black boots in the other stall shifted, and the shadow of the thing inside rose. I could tell the guy was tall, as his shadow now overtook my own on the tile. The man in the stall groaned, and something putrid started to occur in his vocal chords. A feted wave of nauseating stink unfurled out the back of the man’s gullet. He let out a shrill shriek that sounded like the clicking and stridulation of an overgrown cicada.

The next door stall opened, and the long shadow of the man encroached on my door before there was a chance to flee. His two black boots cast a reaper’s outline across the dirty plastic toes of my sneakers. *He was waiting for me.*

A typhoon went off behind me as I accidentally disturbed the toilet’s red-eyed touchless sensor. A bit of leftover paper spat out of the maelstrom, drifting under the door. I reached for the stall’s latch, breath sputtering in measured beats of refined exhausts of fear. The man’s smell snuck its way under the walls worse than before. It should say something that in a room where people emptied their bowels that this *guy* smelled worse than brewing cauldrons of crap and piss. He had a noxious odor that turned the cramped space into a sepulcher of stink so foul I almost turned back to vomit into the toilet I’d completed my previous business relationship with. I plugged my nose and shook with the speed of a man in the grips of frostbite. I placed my fingers on the stall’s handle as the man shook the door. The thing outside chirped and parroted its insectile noises again.

Sense finally broke through my battle lines of dread. I leaned in closer to the canyon between the latch and the stall’s steel skeleton. I could parlay the weight of the door and my own strength to send the man outside flying. It would be enough time to rush out of the restroom shouting bloody murder. But, oddly, all I could make out through the small gap was a pane of red staring back. And then it blinked.

A violet pupil marked by sharp hexagonal corners was staring back at me. A shimmering conjunctiva octagon of malice. Even now, I can see that eye. Gazing at me with lust and begging to open the latch so it could greet me with the delights it held within itself. The devilish pupil adjusted, scanning the floor.

The gnarled figure let out another word: “Lie.”

The word floated through the air like a poisonous gas. A quick glance at my feet, and I realized what he meant.

There was a lone sliver of paper draped across the floor at the tip of the man’s boots

“Lie.” The decrepit voice repeated.

BANG!

Something with the weight of an anvil crashed against the door, contorting the metal into shapes it was never meant to take.

Claws dashed themselves against the entry, each successive punch whittling the rusting hinges further. I scrambled back, cowering atop the toilet.

“LIIIIIIIIIIIE.” The thing shrieked in a voice that rose in pitch with each second.

BANG! A screw flew out of the door hinge and whizzed past into the drywall.

That was all the motivation required for me to scramble to the floor and crawl under the partition between the next stall. The man shattered and slammed down my old stall door, which surely would’ve crushed me if I hadn’t left when I did.

I pulled myself along into the next-door cubicle. My hands didn’t find the hard porcelain of the tile, though. The floor of the neighboring stall was caked in sticky, sinewy clear liquid. The mucus clung to my hands, dripping and oozing down my forearm. The stall was coated in saliva.

I held back my disgust and threw my full weight against the stall’s door to secure it. I tried to dig my heels in for add leverage, but the substance on the floor stuck like gum to my shoe and claimed my sneaker.

The man-thing’s shadow darted back to my door, clawing again.

I shivered and screwed my eyes tight to try and imagine myself in another universe where I’d never seen Jeff’s texts. Where I was home in bed, safe. Where a nameless gesticulating abomination wasn’t about to turn me into a snack. However, as I waited for a final blow or attack, none came.

The silence the chaos left was louder than the booming of the nearby theaters. It only lasted a moment. A ghastly stretching noise rang out. A whining squeezebox of tension gasped out of whatever organs this creature breathed through. I felt this thing’s presence peeling from the shape of a man as elastic rubbery molecules reformed its shape. The latch was closed, but it was inching closer and closer under the door. The thing slunk into the booth, breaking bones and jittering as it adapted its form.

I waited for decades in darkness, keeping my eyes shut. But, I knew… I knew I had to look. I took a deep breath, opened my eyes, and witnessed the horror of what was before me.

A pale head with an untold tally of bug-like eyes glanced up at me from under the divider. The ichor of the horror's skull was constructed from a melting waxwork of flesh and fat. Its shape wilted and collapsed while his neck curved like a boa constrictor’s body.

The thing removed its flesh as if it were a Halloween costume. Its entire anatomy changed, but one thing remained the same, his red eyes. Those red mirror-ball peepers reflected my terror back at me a hundred times over. Each octagonal pupil fixed on me, hunting me.

A grin crept across the monster’s vaguely human features. Its smile was constructed of wooden planks that retched out from its unhinged jaw.

Its voice came again, made worse by its jangled caricature of a mouth.

“Paper. Please.”

The fly-like eyes watched with anticipation. The thing’s eyes bulged, and its putty neck extended further and coiled in a leathery gyre inches from my face.

“Paper. Please.” It asked again.

Drool slid down its clattering pincers in a long bead. The space grew hot, like the foul thing emitted rays of toxic vapor. The thing didn’t move to tear my flesh. No, it simply watched me and cocked its head like a dog waiting for dinner.

“I… I…”

It understood my confusion, I think. Like it’d spent time with humans, but never fully become one. The man-thing nodded to the empty rolls of toilet paper in the stall we now shared. In a nauseating second, it was revealed why the nameless thing gave off such putrid smells.

The creature’s face unwrapped like a present and birthed into a mantis’s beak, abandoning its camouflage. A pink pulsing tongue curled out of the darkness of its mouth and pitched forth an intestine’s worth of waded, dissolved, and acid processed paper. A buffet of discarded pieces of cloth, wrappers, and cardboard were regurgitated into a stack.

In a second, I understood what it was showing me... *Past meals.*

I wish what followed came from a place of bravery. In reality, it had more in common with those tests they give you with the little hammer at a physical. Just a reflex from the fear consuming me.

I bent down into the digestive muck that coagulated on my sneakers and stuck my hand under the last divider. I found a full roll, and I tried to peel it free, but my hand was just out of reach.

The man thing sniffed and spoke again. This time it dropped all attempts at human vocalization.

“PPPPPPPPAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPEEEEEEEERRRRRR. PLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAASSSSSSEEEEE.”

I groped blindly at the toilet roll holder in the last stall. I was able to jam my knuckles into a metal toilet paper holder, resulting in a fresh skin wax. Blood streaked down from my hand and smattered against the increasingly gore-stained bathroom tiles.

The creature bobbed its head. Countless eyes spotted my injury. Tweezers in the monstrosity’s mouth snapped at the blood. Its eyes pulsed with excitement.

It was made clear that this was a race. Get him another roll, or risk my new friend discovering he enjoyed the taste of blood more than Charmin. I shoved my fist against the back of the box to find a ledge inside the cardboard’s holder. I worked my digits together and gained leverage with each subtle movement, my shoulder feeling close to tearing clean off my bones. Eventually, my fingers snagged the paper and pulled the entire roll down in a fast motion.

I let the paper tumble out meters away from the behemoth in my stall. I shoved the wad of paper and presented it before the thing’s mouth.

The creature paused… then drifted toward its next meal. The thing’s slinky-lengthened beak snatched it like a mantis plucking off a mate’s head.

Little fingers on the inside of its proboscis maw added the rapidly disintegrating rolls to its growing cornucopia of sustenance. The only thing I can compare it to is when I would watch my pet hermit crab snatch-up crickets as a kid. Its pincers would pluck at the insects and slice them into bite-sized ribbons of exoskeleton.

The monsters little efforts balled-up the watery sloshing paper that slid out its gullet. I glanced at its face in time to catch its red eyes rolling white. A delight of nourishment poured forth from every crevice and notch in the thing’s scaly face.

Once it consumed its haul, the monster’s visage reformed itself into a jigsaw puzzle sculpted from marrow and muscle while its tongue receded. In a moment, the thing in the stall returned to its proper form: that of a pale old man dressed in a ratty coat and with black ratty hair. His outer skin slipped onto him like a well-worn coat, and then he smiled at me. And as it finished reforming, I realized… I knew the face staring at me.

*Pressing them like papier-mâché into the sinks and building what looked like a nest.*

It was the old man I’d seen during my last trip. He’d been here this whole time, gorging on whatever other trash he could gather. Like how a moth could blend into a tree, this thing could blend into a man and roam the halls of the theater, prowling for dinner.

The *thing* recoiled and slank out of the stall as its neck crushed back into form. The thing wearing the old man uttered a last word to me as it opened the stall door and exited into the bathroom.

“Full.”

I could only glimpse his goliath sized boots as he marched off into the lobby.

He was gone a second later, and I was alone in the muck and wreckage he’d left behind.

I waited and shook in the remains of the collapsed toilet until a dad and his kid marched in after probably seeing the latest Minions film playing in Theater Six. They stared at me in shock as I sat on the white floor, covered in saliva and blood.

It took an hour before I could bring myself to tell the theater management about the ordeal. They were about as helpful as you’d expect. I tried to spare as many details as I could to make the events in the restroom sound more believable. It was fruitless.

“So this guy was eating… the toiler paper? Is that correct?” A female manager said while scribbling down notes about the encounter.

She flipped back to her first page of documentation.

“Did you spot any drug paraphernalia on him?”

Cops did eventually check the restroom. A mess of slime and the bashed-in stall was the only evidence to support my story.

“What about cameras?” I said while police scanned the restroom. “Don’t you guy’s video tape this place?”

“Those are an insurance policy. You see how many people are coming to this place?” The woman said and pointed to the nothingness occupying the lobby.

Cops took my statement and told me they’d call. For all of my effort, the outcome was a police report, a refunded ticket, and a comped popcorn.

All I can recall after was reaching my car as I crossed past the homeless encampment again. People were still stirring, and I got quickly lost in the orange glow of a communal barrel drum fire.

Thoughts of the thing from the stall living amongst the homeless hit me. I imagined it out in the shadows, hiding in plain sight, praying on vagrants when it couldn’t find proper sustenance. It had considered chowing on me, after all. Maybe what I witnessed was its version of fine dining. Humans would do… but paper was preferred. I took a last look at the tattered men milling about the park and realized these folks were *home cooking*.

Voices cast back from the encampment. Laughter. *Coughing.*

I haven’t been back to the theater since that night. In my dreams, I still see that thing’s red dichoptic eyes, and that crooked craw yearning for dinner.

I’ll end with a word of advice. A moral, if such a thing could be parsed from my nightmare. The next time someone in the restroom calls for a roll of toilet paper roll, pass one along.

You never know who’s in the next stall.
