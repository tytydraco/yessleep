I bought Belial from a man on a council estate out east three years ago. She was cheap for her breed, her mother a purebred Borzoi and her father, according to the man "one of those pigs, y'know, one of those pig-dogs". A police dog he claimed had impregnated his lovely Borzoi when she slipped through the crack in his door while in heat. Belial sat with her mother without a sound; long nose and big paws and cute curly tufts around her ears that reminded me of little devil horns. 

I had never owned a dog before Belial, I am a linguist and mainly work with deaf children. I figured a smart breed like Belial couldn't be much different and so I decided to train her based on my own knowledge of language acquisition. When she was still a tiny puppy, I trained her like this:

"Belial, is this a ball?" I would then move a treat up and down in the air and Belial's head would follow, mimicking a nod "Yes! Good girl Belial". Then I'd hold up a roll of tape "Belial, is this a ball?" And would move a treat side to side

 _No_ 

"Good girl!"

Eventually Belial didn't need the treat. She'd slowly nod  _Yes_  and shake her head _No_ appropriately. I didn't teach her sign, I should have in hindsight, but I thought it would get confusing when meeting clients. 

When Belial was a few months old I could ask her more complex questions. I'd lay the ball and the tape next to each other on the floor "Belial, which one do I throw?" Belial would gently place her long snout on the ball "Good." Her curiosity grew as she did, following me around the house, pointing with her nose.

Belial's understanding of propositions fascinated me, I knew she was special. I believed she had a gift.

To be honest, she had begun to usettle me a little. She is a big girl, the silhouette of a German Shepherd but lankier, with a long snout and short, beige fur all over with elegant tufts of fluff around the back of her legs and ears. Her movements were always measured; graceful and deliberate, more like a horse than a dog. 

This already made her stand out, and most people at the park are not used to a dog answering a question with a head nod. I would try to avoid asking her questions in public, I could feel people stare in disbelief when I would ask "Belial are you hungry" and she would nod

 _Yes_ 

There was also her personality, or rather, her lack of one. Dogs have small muscles over their eyes that we bred into them to make expressions, puppy eyes, angry eyes, the full range. Not Belial. I took her to a vet. Maybe she had a facial palsy, something wrong with her nerves.
 
"She's just very calm, there is nothing wrong with her" I was told, unconvincingly.

Her silence perturbed me. She didn't bark. Not once. She didn't seem to want anything from me at all aside from her lessons. She would sit and stare at me, eyes locked, waiting. Frozen, until I pointed at something. 

I'd point at an apple 

"Belial is this a vegetable?" 

_No_ 

For hours and hours, pointing at different objects. 

Three months ago I emailed my local university about Belial's language abilities. Three professors agrees to meet us. I could tell they didn't take us seriously, until they did. I brought a bag of random objects with me. We met in a class room in the late evening. I laid my bag of objects out on the floor: an apple, ball, pen, lightbulb, paper fan, bell pepper, and a dog dental chew stick. The professors watched, amused.

"I am going to ask Belial what these items do, or the class of these items. For example, I might ask her which item is blue, and she will place her nose on the item" I explained. 

"Belial, what do I write with?" Belial placed her nose on the pen "Good."

"Belial, where does light come from?" Belial placed her nose on the lightbulb "Good." 

One of the professors laughs "brilliant!"

"Belial, what vegetable do humans eat?" This time, Belial did a command I didn't see often from her, she walked around in a slow, delibarate circle 

"She does that when she doesn't know the answer." But she knew.

"Belial! What vegetable do I eat?" I say in frustration. Belial shakes her head 

_No_ 

"It's okay, she is very impressive" one of the professors says, smiling politely. They didn't understand what had just happened.

I try one more time "Belial, where is the bell pepper?" Belial looks at me, and then looks at the three men, and down at the bell pepper, which she snaps between her jaws and swallows in two bites. She stares at me again

 _No_ 

she shakes her head,

 _No_ . 

On our walk home I was proud of my training and of Belial, she really was a clever girl. But I was also feeling a little... shaken. She trotted next to me, her body pressed closer than usual. Her eyes fixed up at mine. 

"Stop staring at me, Belial"

_Yes_ 

Her blank face and her near total obedience until this point had made her a sort of automaton in my mind, a complex doll or a robot. But this was clearly wrong. She was thinking and learning to an extent I couldn't understand and she was pushing back.

Over the next month Belial would push boundaries. She wanted to eat my food 

"Belial, eat your food" 

_No_

"What food do you want?" She would place her nose on my plate 

_Yes_ 

I live by myself, so I started making two meals. She would get up at night and walk around, I could hear her paws pat patting on the floor in my room. She'd climb up onto the end of my bed and stare at me "What do you want?" she would trot away into the darkness. In fact, she still does this. Something the vet noted about Belial is that she was born with a condition called tapedum agenesis, her eyes do not reflect in the dark; her night vision is no better than a humans.

One of the best things at the time about Belial was that she was house trained and could be left alone for hours, she was trustworthy. 

I had come home very late, between 2 and 4 am after work and then after work drinks and then after works drinks drunk talking. My bad. It is a mile or so from my house. Safe but poorly lit, dead headphones, dead phone. As a young women my heckles were already up, pin pricks down my back. Eyes darting into the darkest shadows for a trace of movement, my heart would race at an odd figure in an alleyway. Just a pile of rubbish bins stacked strangely. I avoid looking through the dark windows and light a cigarette. The footsteps behind me speed up and I sweat ice cold, a woman walks past me and smiles. Foxes scream, I jump out of my skin as a dead crow runs across the pavement only for it to be revealed as an empty black plastic bag caught in the wind.

My road is dark as night and quiet as sin, there are no pools of light from porches and the sun doesn't rise until 8. I fumble for my keys and relax into the safety of my front hallway. As usual, nobody greets me at the door. No paws patting on the ground. Dead silence. Curious. I turn the corner into my kitchen, it's pitch dark aside from the glow from the timer on the oven. And then my eyes adjust. There's someone in my kitchen. 

Six foot tall and lanky, her arms pulled up around her middle. Balancing precariously on her long hind legs, she is standing in the kitchen facing away from me, looking at the oven. 

"Belial? What are you doing?" Her figure so forced, breathing heavily and swaying and making little balancing movements. She tilts her head down and I see her face, she's grimacing, her lips pulled all the way back.

"Belial?"

I walk towards her and as I do, she slowly turns around and I see her in full. Belial is standing on her hind legs with her back straight, straining as hard as she can trying to straighten her arms and legs out, ears flopped down and her face pulled into a grimace, her lips sort of moving like she's trying to say something. She steps towards me, she's more balanced than I had expected. 

"Belial? Are you okay? " 

_Yes_ 

she nods slowly.

I was drunk and tired. Yes, Belial was acting very strangely. But she had never been aggressive and so I did the only thing that made sense. I went to bed. She walked with me, on all fours now, and stood at the end of my bed. She watched me as I fell asleep. 

Clickclickclickclickclick.

The sun rose in the grey sky through my window. 

Clickclickclickclickclick. 

The snapping clicks started again and I darted up, realising in a panic that the clicking was the ignition on my hob. I ran into the kitchen and there was Belial with her lanky paw on the hob. She was trying to light the stove. Click. Click. Click.

"You're going to kill us both Belial!" I shouted, lunging for the switch. She turns to me.

_Yes_ 

She slowly nods,  grimacing.

My heart dropped in my chest and I remember for the first time feeling totally helpless. I was scared of her. I searched up and emergency vet. That evening we got take out.

That night she stood over my bed, watching me sleep. 

Everything that I have described is what lead up to the event that happened one month ago that I will live to regret for the rest of my life.

The next morning I decided to call the emergency vet. Belial was sleeping, curled up on the sofa, like a normal dog. And I slipped out the front door. I called the vet, I told them something was seriously wrong with my dog.

When I looked over at the house, Belial was peeking through the window, watching me on the phone. I turned around, paranoid that she could read my lips. When I got back in she was standing in the doorway.

"Belial, let's go for a walk" 

_Yes_ 

And so we walked, side by side. People stared, horrified. Children pointed. People crossed the road to avoid us. Belial faced me the entire walk, grimacing.

_Why are they scared of me_ 

We made it to the vets. They were perplexed. They thought maybe she had a brain injury that was causing her to posture, perhaps she had damaged her front legs. They asked me if they could give her an anaesthetic for an MRI. 

I wait, and I wait and I wait. And then a vet walks in.

"I'm sorry, when we injected the anaesthetic it caused a hemorrhage in Belial's brain. She is still with us but she's had a stroke, we are keeping her in the ICU."

A week later I see her. In her sick cage. Belial, sat there whimpering, big puppy dog eyes. Dopey looking. 

"Belial, are you okay?"

Nothing. She looked at me with raised eyebrows and big sad eyes. Another week passed and she's ready to come home. She bounds out of the vet up to me, she barks, licks my face. She's discoordinated, walking around on all fours like a big dumb dog. On the train home she stares up at me.

"What a lovely girl, a big silly dog" a stranger cooes. 

I thought, you have no idea what Belial knows. _I_ have no idea what Belial knows. She still stares at me from the end of my bed. I pray she never remembers what I did to her.
