[Since last I wrote on the subject of the whisper field](https://reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g5kjje/the_whisper_field/) ... I was able to meet up with my professor. It was a strikingly cold, windy, and overcast day in Southern California, perfect mood for acquiring materials of a sensitive nature. Street cats roaming under oak trees and misting rain up in the hills. Of course, then my professor had on a Hawaiian shirt and pink glasses.

Perhaps it's best I don't reveal his name so I'll just call him Professor S. We sometimes get together for lunch to chat and recently discussed the issues with the OceanGate Titan sub that led to its catastrophic failure. No, that incident wasn't related to the whisper field. Just plain old greed and negligence. But it's a different matter with this diving expedition earlier in 2024. With OceanGate, a transcript entirely written by some random person online seemed far more legitimate than what was ultimately revealed to the public. 

Now I can't be completely certain that the following transcript is 100% genuine but Professor S checked it with several people he knows in the deep-sea exploration industry and it passes the smell test.

**Transcript of Radio Communication Between Topside Base and Submarine Fathom-6, Mariana Trench Expedition**

[July 14, 2024]
Mission: Deep Dive Exploration, Mariana Trench (10,994 meters)
Participants: Fathom-6 Submersible (Commander Riley and Engineer Samuels)
Topside Operations (Control Tech Alvarez)

[Some irrelevant convos and technical data omitted. Time stamps not included].

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Fathom-6, this is Topside. You're clear for descent. Confirm status check. And hey, don’t go pulling a James Cameron on us, okay? Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Ha! Roger that, Topside. We'll try not to bring back Titanic Two. Systems are green across the board. Depth gauge is calibrated, oxygen steady, Samuels is whining about the coffee already and asking when he can take a nap. He's so lazy. Over.

[Time passes before reply]

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Wow. Harsh. Maybe I’ll pass that on to the catering team. I’m sure they'll cry themselves to sleep. Anyway, telemetry looks good on our end. Keep an eye on the lateral thrusters. Last check showed them a little sluggish. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Yeah, we’ll keep an eye out. Thrusters are holding for now. Descending to 1,500 meters. Visibility is decent. Not much to see yet, just endless blue.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Endless blue, that’s sooo poetic. You been reading up on your Jacques Cousteau? Wait till we get to the black. It’s gonna feel like we’re diving into space. But wet. Over.

[25 minutes later]

[Alvarez (Topside)]
You're at 4,000 meters, Fathom-6. All systems nominal. How’s the view? Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Pretty spectacular, actually. We just passed a big old squid giving us the side-eye. Probably pissed we didn’t invite him for lunch. We’re at 4,100 now and dropping smoothly.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
And no icebergs. That’s a win. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Good to know! Would hate for you to miss the James Cameron Seal of Approval. You're past Titanic depth now. No sign of any luxury liners down there? Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Nah. But I’ll keep an eye out for a Game Boy some kid lost over the side of their cruise ship in the 90s. Probably would still work. Did Cameron leave any of his cameras behind on DCV 1? Might be a nice find.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Probably. That guy leaves cameras everywhere he goes. Cameron makes all this look easy. The guy’s probably sipping lattes at 10,900 meters deep, while we’re in here trying not to kill each other in a cramped tin can. Anyway, lateral thrusters are getting a bit slow, just like you said. I’m gonna re-calibrate them before we hit the next depth window. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Roger that. Thruster data’s coming through. Do what you need to. And hey, don’t pull an OceanGate down there. I like you guys intact. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Too soon, Alvarez. Too soon.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Yeah, can we not talk about sub implosions while we’re heading into the deepest hole on the planet? Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
My bad. We’ll stick to safe topics. Like my ex. Since we're talking about deep holes. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Trying too hard, Topside. But levity appreciated.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Descent speed nominal. Pressure is at the expected range. We’re at 5000 meters. Looks good so far. If we have a problem, we still have our floaty bois. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Floaty bois? Is that the official technical term? Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Oh, absolutely. It’s in the manual right after "don't panic."

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Alright, passing 6,500 meters. The ballast is steady. Thrusters online, no other issues. External temp is dropping faster than my enthusiasm for this brand of jokes. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Fine and fair enough. All systems still looking good topside. You’re entering the “hadal zone.” Named after Hades. Tell him I said hi. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Just waiting for a Cthulhu sighting at this point. Samuels, you see any tentacles on your end yet?

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Not yet, but I’ll let you know if something taps the window. Over. 

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Careful what you wish for. Let’s stay focused here. How’s the oxygen scrubbers? Pressure still good? Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
All systems normal. Scrubbers functioning. Pressure’s holding. But we did get a minor ping—wait, no, never mind. False alarm. Just the sonar being twitchy. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Copy that. Keep an eye on the readings. We’re showing some static on the comms from our end. Could be the pressure messing with the signal. You two hearing anything weird? Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Nah, clear on our side. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
How’s the pressure inside? No pops or cracks, right? Over.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Not unless you count my neck popping from having no room to stretch up or move around. Everything looks solid here.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
I still think we should’ve brought a movie to kill time. Maybe The Abyss. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
The Abyss? Really? Pretty sure that's the last thing you want to watch. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Hey, it's also a really sweet love story. Between a man and an alien in a jellyfish suit. 
Maybe we could've done a Titanic rewatch. That way, at least we’d be inspired not to crash.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
I could do without the movie marathon talk. Pressure’s spiking but within tolerances. Ballast’s holding. Can’t say the same about my anxiety. Over. 

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Copy. You’re almost at the bottom floor. Check your exterior cameras. Sonar’s reading some activity a couple of clicks ahead. Might be worth a look. Over. 

[Static on the comms for 30 seconds]

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Fathom-6, this is Topside. Do you copy? Over.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Yeah, we copy. Just a bit of interference. Cameras aren’t picking up much. Just the usual—wait. Something’s moving. Probably just a jelly or—hold on, that’s… weird...

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Weird how? Describe what you’re seeing. Remember to end messages. Over. 

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Right. Ummm...it's like… a shadow, but it’s not moving with the current. It’s staying still...

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Could be a sonar anomaly? Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Keep an eye on it but don’t get too close. What’s your depth now? Over.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
7000 meters. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Good, stay cautious. Could be debris or… I don’t know, we’ve seen all sorts of strange things down there. Descend to 8,000 meters. You’ll be in the Trench proper by then. Let us know if things start getting spookier. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Define spookier. We talking a spectral dance party showing up? Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
You’ll know it. Over.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Really not comforting, Topside. But will keep ears out. Over. 

[45 minutes later]

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Fathom-6, you’re at 9,500 meters. All systems green. You guys are doing great. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Thanks, Topside. Visibility’s near zero now. Feels like we’re diving through ink. Pressure’s heavy, creaks, but everything’s holding steady. No issues so far. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Creaks? Elaborate. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Like... I thought I heard you, Alvarez, but weirdly distant. Some kind of feedback maybe? Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Wasn’t me. Maybe it’s interference from the pressure or—wait, hang on. Over.

[Static again, this time lasting longer]

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Okay, Fathom-6, this is Topside. You cut out for a bit there. What’s going on? Over. 

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Just the sound of us creaking a little. Every time we dip lower, I feel like I’m in an old submarine movie....You hear that?---

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
...What?---

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
That… I dunno—sounded like static, or—

[Alvarez (Topside)]
You guys are cutting out a little, Fathom-6? I didn’t catch that last part. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Nah, just hearing things. Probably the sound of our nerves snapping. Or just Samuels' nerves. I'm cool as a sea cucumber.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Ha ha, very funny. No, I swear I heard something in the static just now. Thought it was you messing with the comms, Alvarez. Tell me you aren't playing with us or actually tell us, yes, you're just having some fun. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Not me. Comm systems are clear. You sure it wasn’t just interference? Happens sometimes at these depths. Over.

[10 minutes later]

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Fathom-6, you’ve hit 10,500 meters. Welcome to the bottom of the world. Any strange creatures or Cthulhu sightings? Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Nothing yet, though I keep waiting for something to tap on the window. Or for Samuels to crack and start screaming about giant crabs.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Hey, I like crabs. But there is something weird down here. There’s a… hum. I can’t explain it. It’s not mechanical, but it’s too consistent to be natural. Alvarez, are you picking up any weird frequencies? Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Negative. Everything’s reading fine on our end. No weird frequencies. You might just be hearing ambient ocean noise. It’s not like we’ve mapped everything down there. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Yeah, Samuels, quit being paranoid. Unless the hum is singing you a lullaby, I think we’re good.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Sure, make jokes. But it’s weird. I swear it’s getting louder, almost like—

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Hold up. I’m actually picking up something now. There’s a faint signal coming through. Did you guys try to transmit something extra? I’ve got some garbled audio coming in on a different band. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
No, we haven’t transmitted anything since the last check-in. What’s the audio saying? Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
I don’t know. It’s just static… and maybe voices? It’s too distorted. Hang on. Over.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Voices? Riley, I’m telling you, something’s off down here. It’s like… it’s like I can hear someone whispering. Thought it was you a minute ago, but—

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Not me, Samuels. You’re hearing things. The pressure’s probably messing with your head. We’re sitting in colon butt crack of the world, after all.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Fathom-6, I’m still picking up that audio. It’s definitely whispering, but I can’t make out the words. Can you guys confirm there’s nothing on your end? You’re not hearing this? Over.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
I am hearing something. It’s faint, but it sounds like… someone’s talking. Like right outside the hull.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Samuels, that’s not possible. We’re at 10,500 meters. You’re imagining things. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
I don’t know, Riley. I’m hearing it too now. And it’s not interference. Over. 

[3 minutes of silence on the comms]

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Alvarez, are you messing with us? I swear I just heard my own name. And it wasn’t lovingly whispered by Samuels. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Negative, Riley. No tricks. I wouldn’t be that cruel. But if you’re hearing something down there, I need you to stay calm and check your systems. It’s possible the acoustics are playing tricks at that depth. Over.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
I… I don’t think this is acoustics. I’m hearing something clearer now. It’s not just a hum. It’s voices. One of them… it sounded like my dad. But my dad’s been gone for 10 years. Fuck...

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Alvarez. We're not joking down here. For once. I’m serious. I heard my own voice. My name. It wasn’t an echo. It was… it was too clear, like someone whispered right into my ear. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Both of you, hold it together. There’s no way any of this is real. Stress and pressure can do a lot of things to your minds, especially at these depths. You’re hearing what you expect to hear. I've heard some weird things too but that's normal. Just take a deep breath and chill. Over.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
No, no, no. This is different. It’s not in my head anymore. It’s like it’s inside the sub. It's whispering things I haven’t told anyone. Stuff about my family. About things I’ve done… Alvarez, it’s inside! How could it be inside? Why is it inside?

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Jesus, Samuels, get a grip. Don’t lose it on me down here. I’m hearing things too. It's like… it knows stuff. Things I would never talk about to anyone. Not even my therapist. I don't wanna sound crazy, but there's something here...

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
It’s getting louder, Riley. I hear it. I hear so much. I hear all of it. It’s like it’s talking right into my head. It’s repeating stuff I thought I forgot. Oh god… Alvarez… it knows. It’s knows everything about me...

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Guys, stay with me. You both need to focus. I need you to prep for immediate but controlled ascent. Whatever you’re experiencing, we’re getting you out of there. Now. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Ballast’s not responding, Alvarez. I’m trying, but it’s like the whole system is locked. We’re stuck...

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Oh God, Riley. It’s inside me. I can hear it in me now. I can hear it repeating all the horrible things I think about it and I never tell anyone… every thought I’ve buried. It won’t stop! It won’t stop!

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Samuels, hold it together! We’re getting out. Alvarez, systems aren’t responding at all. I need a manual override. I don’t know what the hell’s happening, but it’s not just whispers anymore. The sub… the sub is vibrating. I can feel it. It’s like something’s touching the hull, trying to split it open like an egg...

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Fathom-6, calm down! I’m sending the override codes now. You’re going to be fine. Just hang on. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
No, you don’t get it, Alvarez. The voices… they’re talking about things that no one could know. I've hurt people. It was a long time ago but I've done some bad things. Things I’ve locked away. How the hell is this possible? It’s saying… it’s saying my wife’s name. How do you know her name?!

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Oh god. It’s screaming! It’s screaming in my head! Make it stop, make it stop! It knows everything! It’s pulling my thoughts out—It’s pulling them out! Riley, help me!

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Samuels, hold on! Alvarez, we need that override! It’s like the whole sub is alive down here! It’s crawling, like there’s something trying to get inside.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Override sent! You’re going to be fine, just focus on the systems. We’re pulling you out. Hang in there. Over.

[Static crackles, mixed with unintelligible whispers.]

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
IT’S INSIDE ME! I CAN’T— AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Samuels! SAMUELS! Jesus, Alvarez, he’s… I can’t… Oh god!

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Riley, respond! What’s happening? Do you copy? Fathom-6, do you copy?!

[Silence. Then whispers. Louder and clearer.]

[Whispers (unknown source)]
…know. Down here. Fear. All here. In the dark...

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Riley! Samuels! Pull up! Pull up now!

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
It’s too late. We’re not alone down here. I can’t—I can’t fight it. They know. They know. Oh god. Alvarez, I’m sorry.

[Whispers grow louder, overlapping.]

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
[Screaming] No! No! It’s in me! 

[The sound of a human skull banging against a submarine wall]

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Riley! SAMUELS! PULL UP! PULL UP NOW!

[All comms abruptly cut. Final transmission lost]

Aside from this discovery, I was able to use a YouTube video recovery app to find a three part series which has since recently been deleted soon after posting, still in the Google cache. Unfortunately, I don't have the original video files, just an AI transcription of the materials which I am proofing and correcting.

Excitingly, one of the survivors of the 1965 to 1967 British Geological Society Tesla Experiments has responded to my emails and is willing to conduct a sitdown interview since they live in the area.

I haven't been sleeping lately, but that isn't a new thing for me. The new thing is that I hear sounds outside the front door of where I live, usually past 1 AM. It could be the changing temperature or stealthy cats camping out on the patio furniture but every time I've checked there is nothing and no one there. The whispers are constant to the point that I'm starting to consider them just white noise. I play a lot of heavy music to deal with it, but it never quite seems to overcome them.

Would it be so bad to just stick my Phillips head screwdriver deep enough and feel some blessed silence? But what if they're still there, even after?
