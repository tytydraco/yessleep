Decided that my fair project is going to be about different types of mushrooms. Mushroom are Science right? To be honest, I don't know anything about them. I just know I've seen a bunch of different ones over in the woods by school. It'll be a pain to go looking by myself, so I convinced to come help. He told me he'll help me pick few if I take him to the cinema first. He wants to see this film about bugs. I'm a little old for it so I hope none of my mates see me, but I need to go into town anyway and pick up a mushroom book (or whatever they're called), so why not.

Mum's more into the fair than I am, I'd really not bothered. But the grief she'll give me outweighs the work it'll take. So as long as I look like I'm working hard and have something on the table it should be fine. Honestly the whole day sounds like a drag, but if I power through and get... I want to say 5 types will do? I'll have the rest of the week to myself to just chill.

Okay so that was weird.

Couldn't find the book, film was fine. Got to the woods around early sunset when the sky is lovely; all red and orange. I instantly regretted taking, he was all hyper from the film and snacks. He kept quoting the jokes we had just seen and was running between the trees with a "sword" (big stick). So instead of speeding up the legwork, I was randomly picking up stuff I didn't know the name of by myself while babysitting a kid on a sugar high. I got some white ones with circle tops and some gross layered ones sticking to the tree while looked for one's "like in Mario". For what was meant to be an easy phone-in, it was quickly becoming a right pain in my arse. I was contemplating whether a display on what bark does would work when I heard call for me from across the woods.

I must have really taken my eyes off him because he'd managed to get pretty far away. There was this little alcove hidden behind a bush you have to crawl under. Don't know what he was doing in there, I got tagged by a bunch of thistles and an errant thorny twig took my glasses off. Still, it didn't take me long to realise why he called for me.

God, how do I even explain this.

It was a little taller than I am. It was all mushy and lumpy, but also kind of like this thick froth. It's colour was somewhere between grey and purple, with masses of black clouds swimming through it.

I almost feel like the English language is letting me down here, it's really hard to get across just how... wrong this thing was. The texture was smooth and had this... bright sheen to it? You ever see old sci fi films where they'd shine a light under the cell to make special effects? Yeah, that. But the weirdest thing was how it just... hung there. It was moving upwards. It squirmed and it's mass shifted and pushed. It was definitely climbing up from the ground. But at the same time, it wasn't moving. At all. It was like I was staring at an optical allusion. A physical impossibility physically in front of me.

asked if it was a type of mushroom, he thought he had done a good job finding it. I told him I didn't think so as I leaned in for a closer looked. You couldn't tell at first, but at around an inch away you could make out hundred of these little black... hairs? They reminded me of when you get a splinter, but cast over it's entire form.

I don't know. I got this instinctual, gut feeling about it. It was wrong somehow. I kept having to tell to stay back, that it had germs. God knows if it did, but the thought of touching it put a knot in my stomach. That was when I noticed as I moved, the little hairs were moving with me. If I shift left, they went left. If I shift right, they went right. Whatever it is, it's alive. Some kind of alive.

I kept moving, watching as the little hairs tracked every move. Tattling on me to their tumorous owner. I reached the other side and that's when it's shape clicked. It was kind of cylindrical, and its mass branched off into smaller tunnels. It was like this thing was clinging to a tree. To a tree that was not there.

You ever get caught trespassing? I have once, and that general vibe was coming over me. I took and we went home with two pockets of mushrooms.

I looked at my diary this morning and remembered the thing. Which was odd. I mean, we only saw it yesterday but it feels like a really old memory. I asked if he remembers finding a weird thing in the woods yesterday. He paused for a while struggling but then said he did. Maybe the experience just took it out of both of us.

When she got back from work we told Mum about what we saw. She didn't quite seem to get it at first, I don't think I did a great job at describing it. She kept saying it was some kind of fungus or mould. It felt like  I kept managing to get her to understand how... strange this thing was. But then it was like her eyes reset, and she'd go back to saying it was just a strange vegetation. was no help either, he's at the age where anything she says it pure fact no matter what he's seen.

Asked her to borrow the camera to take a picture but she said we'll have to wait till the roll is finished before we get them developed. Screw it, told to just take 15 pictures of it. We're going back tomorrow.

Why'd we go back? *Why the fuck did we go back?*

It's my fault, I don't know when to just leave things alone. I wanted to prove it was real. I wanted her to listen but *she wouldn't.*

No it's my fault. It's my fault. It's my fault I brought. I thought he'd back me up.

and I went back to it. Scraped under the brush with the stickers and found it there waiting for us. I started taking pictures of every angle. I needed to show, to prove to her this thing wasn't right. I was taking pictures of the little hairs when I noticed something I hadn't before. This thing didn't smell of anything. Like, anything at all. I could still smell forest fine, but leaning in it was like I was pinching my nose shut. Not only that but even though it looked like it was moving and squirming, it didn't make any sound either. I got-

I was too focused on this that I

Oh God, I took my eyes off him. I wasn't watching him. I wasn't telling him to stay back. I heard say my name. I didn't even have a chance to reply. I barely had the chance to turn my head and see him get... taken. It was like he fell into it. Or maybe it was like he was sucked into it's folds. It was all so quick. I happened so quick. One second he was they, the next he was crumpled into it's pulsating sea.

I just froze. I don't know how long I stood there doing nothing. I did *nothing*. I tried to call out for him but the noise barely escaped my throat in a smothered whisper.

Then I ran. I just ran. I left him there. I was running as hard as I could, but it was like I was running in treacle. My brain was telling my legs to move but I was moving like I was in slow motion. I left him there. He sounded so worried when he said my name.

I got home and ran to Mum. I tried telling her what happened, that we needed the police or an ambulance or something. But she just stood there doing the washing up. She didn't even turn around. I said it again and still nothing. No reaction. I screamed at her to help and she finally looked at me. "Oh you're back." "Why are you so late? Been hanging out with your friends?" It was like my words were passing right through her. She was looking at me... but she wasn't looking at me.

I explained again. She smiled like I hate told a boring joke she wasn't paying attention to.

I kicked over a chair. I explained again. She smiled.

I pleaded with her. I got on my damn knees and begged her to go an help her other son.

She smiled.

"Who?"

I don't know what's happening. I don't know what is happening.

Today I tried to go back and find by myself. But somethings not right with me either. I walk to the woods. I crawl under the underbrush. Then I'm outside the woods. I know I crawl back out of the bush before reaching the other side. I know I calmly walk out of the woods and towards home. But I don't know *why*.

I've tried twenty *goddamn* times to get to that fucking alcove but I'm still here. And is still *there*.

I've got to calm down. I have to breath deeply. I called the police but they told me to have my Mum call to report any missing persons. I've tried so many times to talk to her. Until my throat is raw. She just smiles. Tells me that I know I'm an only child. That I've never mentioned the woods before.

I need to sleep. It feels wrong but I can't keep my eyes open any more. My body still feels stiff. Sluggish. I just need a couple of hours and I'll go back. I'm so, so sorry, I'll find you. I promise, I'll get you home. I just need to catch my breath.

***27th Nov '98***

Writing this in bed. My head feels weird. Not a headache, just kind of foggy. Mushy. Like a damp sponge. Keep falling asleep. Not dreaming.

I can't stop thinking about being out there. Somewhere. Is he hurt? In danger? Alone? Scared?

Mum says I'm just delirious and must have picked up a cold but I don't feel ill. More like... my batteries are low. I know I want to get out of bed but my body won't listen, it's a little scary. I keep crying and can barely wipe my face. ~~I hope~~ I need to feel better tomor

Over my cold, Mum says I can go back to school now. Shame, I probably could've made it to the weekend.

I think someone's trying to scare me. Found my old diary and the base of my bed - but it's got some weird entries in it?

Some kind of spooky story about some guy's brother. I think. One of my mate's must have used it. Probably thinks he's the next RL Stine.

Anyway, now I'm better I *do* need to decide on my project. The mushroom thing doesn't actually sound like a bad idea so I might just do that.

Will need a new disposable camera for the pics though, Mum's melted in the Sun somehow. Weird for the time of year. Maybe Global Warming? Or is it Climate Change? One of them. Honestly, who even knows what's going on out there.
