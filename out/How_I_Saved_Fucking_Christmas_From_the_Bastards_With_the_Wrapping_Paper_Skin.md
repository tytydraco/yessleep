Fuck Santa bullshit.  Embrace nature.  Repeat.  That was our idea of winter fun.  We believed in Christmas alright, believed it was nothing but a stupid, materialistic holiday that completely missed the point of spirituality.  It always pissed us both off whenever people used the holiday as nothing but a way to market toys and shit.  In order to get our minds off this cash grabbing garbage, my friend and I decided that it would be a wise idea to have some good old fashion fun in the ice caves of Svalbard.

The night was cold enough to make the air turn into nothing but crystals with each breath.  Above the white tipped and eerily still forest was a sky clothed in a dark brown hue from what I assumed was invisible moonlight illuminating the surroundings.  Perfect imprints of our boots were left in the snow, smooth and thick as mashed potatoes.  Our vehicles were not far off from the caves.  Scott’s obsidian black hair flew ever so slightly when a gentle breeze passed by.  He had a light mounted directly on his helmet and a pair of steampunk goggles for “aesthetic purposes.”  Since this whole thing was Scott’s idea in the first place, he was in charge of taking the lead down the caves and providing commentary that mostly involved really shitty jokes and things that would only make a stoner laugh.

A chill ran up my spine right when we stood in front of the biggest cave, large enough to wolf down the Empire State Building if it were tipped on its side.  We both beamed toothy grins at each other, rubbing our hands together in excitement.  Right on the lip, icicles hung down like the teeth from a monstrous beast, while the only passage in the center almost formed an esophagus.

Scott activated the light on his head and we paced forward.  I cocked my head down when I heard a small thud against my boots.  The surface below was nothing but carved ice with ancient runes, most likely Scandinavian.  I turned to Scott, who was still grinning eagerly.

“You know the drill, you dolt.  Let’s get a-movin’!” I said.

Scott raised an eyebrow, poking me in the chest.  

“Phil, you’re cold-hearted,” Scott snickered.  

I replied with a thumbs down and a sarcastic “booooooo!” 

“Tally-ho, you motherfucker!” he said.

I pulled out a can of fluorescent waterproof truck bedliner, shook it to ensure it works, and sprayed a slash across the entrance with my nose plugged.  “Let’s go spelunking.”

Scott gave me a nod.

\---

After spraying to mark our location God knows how many times, the cave passage started to close up to around the height of a semi-truck.  Our breaths continued to form miniature puffs against the cobalt blue ice.  Accompanying us were the sounds of water splattering on the floor and flowing through unseen chasms and the sounds of our spiked boots.  I marked another glowing slash against the leftmost wall.  When Scott shined a torch and pushed back the darkness, a fork in our path revealed itself.

A light, almost human moaning resonated through the caverns.  

My hair stood on end.  “Did you hear that?” I said.

We both put an ear to the walls.  The source of the vibrations appeared to originate to the left.  My friend rested his hands on his hips.  Claw marks were on the sides of the walls. 

“Sounds like wind is roaring through the caverns.” Scott assumed.

I pulled out an ice pick, pointing it to the right chamber.  “Or a sign of the cave walls weakening on the left.  We should go this way.”  

As we went down my suggested path, the floor unexpectedly lost its friction.

“Crap!” I yelled as my foot slipped.  I jabbed the pick into the frozen ground, going down the slick slope.  As quickly as the sudden slippery slope appeared, rough ground eventually returned, guiding me to an antechamber with blinding shadows in its maw.

“Phil? You alright, mate?”

I nodded.  “I guess my spikes were a little too caked with ice.”

As I dusted the frost off my pants and dug out the snow from the soles of my boots, my flashlight shined over a puddle with a deep black color.

A handprint.

My dad was a cop and had seen multiple dead bodies and gore before, so seeing blood wasn’t that much of a scare.  The apple didn’t fall far from the tree, I suppose.  

Scott on the other hand, not so much.  His excited demeanor started to vanish.  His light flickered and shook every which way, spotting more pools of hardened blood in dozens of bodies.  

“What the hell happened here?” Scott exclaimed, stepping back, hands to his chest in defense mode.

I put a gloved hand to my chin.  Why were all these bodies piled everywhere and where did they come from?

Then, the beam reflected off a shiny surface.

“Hey Scott, come here!” I whispered, pointing at an old sword hilt.  Scott gave me a smile, taking it in his hands.  It was a tarnished silver indicating years of unuse and covered in ornate strokes, making it look like something out of MMO game.  Runes down the leather handle matched the floor outside the cavern.  The blade was reduced to nothing but a dull, worthless knub.

“Maybe we could melt it down into raw metal and sell it?  It most likely wouldn’t be worth much at a pawn shop.”

“Do you think we should go down the-” as I spoke, the flashlight shone over several of the decayed carcasses.  

We both jumped back before leaning in to see if our eyes deceived us.

They were wearing knight armor.

Their armor was nothing but frayed metal sheets and their skin was a shimmering, gangrenous purple.  Upon getting a closer look, one of the knights had a bite taken right out of his chest.  Teeth marks gnawed at the stumps of his ribcage.  His intestines laid scattered across the icy floor, gastric acid and bile having discolored and dissolved the ice.

“What the hell?!” we both shouted.  I took off the fallen warrior’s helmet.  Long blonde hair unfurled out.  Pointy ears poked out from outside and his skin was paler than snow.

An elf.

In the distance, crackling and chewing of flesh could be heard.  Scott and I looked at each other.

“Look, sorry for bringing you out here.  I didn’t know we would be in this deep of shit!” My friend whispered.

“Don’t apologize now, we need to get out now!”  I said.  Following the glowing trail, we hurry back out the way we came.

Scott abruptly stopped to a halt and pushed me back, asking me to douse the light. He pointed at a silhouette.

I put my arms up when I found out what he was pointing at.  Right in the middle of our path was a figure devouring the corpse of a fallen knight.  All that could be seen of the apparition were the tentacles attached to a moist throat.  Each were covered in wrapping paper with an assortment of stripes, polka dots and stars.  One of the mouth tentacles snaked around the remaining arm of the deceased elf.  Tugging on it, the mass began to crack, crunch, and snap until it was torn from its socket leaving the bone exposed.  Its toothed esophagus opened up as it swallowed and crunched down on the plates and swallowed it whole.  Seconds later, it spat out the toothmarked gauntlets of the arm.  One of its hands came out into our sights, covered in soaked wrapping paper.  Below its paper skin were the thick tendons and bulging muscles that could barely be covered.  Its arm resembled that roid-raged gorilla.

And then, its fingers dug into the ice as if it were preparing to charge.

With a ravenous bellow, it pounded its chest.  We turned the opposite direction and bolted, screaming.  Its limbs battered against the frozen ground as it gave chase.

We both turned on our lights.

To distract the beast, I punctured a hole in one of the fluorescent cannisters and threw it at the ground.  It exploded into a cloud of arsenic green, making the headless goliath lurch back.  It clawed at the dense mist.  

Scott and I kept sprinting through the battlefield.  He tried searching for any possible weaponry for a second.  Like the hilt, every last sword was ground down to nothing but a hilt, as if the beast knew others would try and enter this cave.

“Forget about weaponry, Scott! Run for it!” I shouted.  

Then, the bodies stopped appearing.  For several meters, the floor was mostly clear.  The beast continued to pursue us.

Out of nowhere, our feet sunk in an unseen snow bank.  My legs seized up from the cold.  We dug at the floor, trying to free ourselves from the deep powder.  Every time I freed one leg from the drift, the other would get trapped.  I turned my head to the right.  Scott was now waist deep in the snow. I freed myself from the bank, turning my head back as the wrapping paper monster continued to rush forward, its tentacles flailing like spaghetti in a wind tunnel.  When I reached solid ground, I fished through my bag, pulling out a rope and tossing it to my trapped friend.

“Grab it!” I ordered.

Scott tugged on it and I tried to pull, but lost my footing on the ice once more.  I hastily dug out the residue from my spikes, looked around, and found a notch I could hold on to.  The beast drew closer, stomping and thrashing through the deep snow.  I pulled on the rope and my friend shimmied out a blink of an eye.  We kept sprinting for as long as we could, finally freed from the drift.

My blood froze when we reached a dead end with a small tube for our only escape.  I turned around, frantically motioning Scott to force himself inside.  All of the monster’s mouth tentacles reeled back like a fisherman about to cast a line and struck at the floor.  I shoved myself into the hole.  One of the tentacles snapped at my leg.  I winced and took out my ice pick, slicing it off.  The beast roared in pain and retreated.  When we were a few meters in the passage, the beast tried to reach for us with a beefy arm, but failed.  It pounded at the floor in fury, running off.  I marked an x in the slender tube and followed my friend as he squirmed out and stood up in a brand new cave that curved to a hard right.

“What the hell was that thing?” I said to Scott.

“I have no idea.  We need to get out now and find a different way out.”

\---

The sounds of the cave still remained the same.  All that could be heard for a while were drips of water generating from the icicles above.  I paused to mark another florescent X when a scratchy coughing sound echoed in the far end of the next chamber.  Right in between a three-way intersection laid another elf with short hair in braids.  Blood was smeared across the warrior’s chest like a crude fingerpainting from a child.  Its armor was gouged with claw marks and finger pits were left on the chestplate and sabatons.

My friend and I drew close to the knight.  Scott shone a light down each of the other intersections, hoping that the wrapping paper fuckers would not return.

“My God, what happened?  Are you alright?” We both said.

As it spoke, blood leaked out of its mouth.  “You don’t have any armor.  It’s not worth facing the beasts in these caves.”

Beasts?  That was just great.  One of them was a big enough threat already.  “I saw some deceased elves back there.  Why did you come here too?” Scott replied.

“We were sent here by Father Christmas…These beasts were once elves just like us, but they were lusting for power and tried to bring this world to ruin…” The warrior coughed up a knot of congealed blood and mucus.

“Father Christmas?  You mean Santa?”  I shook my head.  This had to be some kind of joke.

“They were cursed to remain in this cave forever.  Father Christmas’ curse is weakened each year on December 25th and must be restored.  Until dawn, the curse remains in a state of uselessness, allowing them to escape.  He comes down to restore it and sends us elves to slay the beasts before they can wreak havoc on this world.  But they have gotten smarter, reduced our weaponry to nothing but stumps, bred my comrades like pigs and fed them nothing but any wildlife that dared enter here.  And they have developed grudges.”

Scott looked at me, teeth clenched before his eyebrows furrowed and we nodded in agreement.  We may be Scrooges, but we were not assholes.  

“We can’t just leave your friends to die in here!  We can save them!”

“No don’t!” The elven warrior spat out another mass of crimson.  From the force of his coughing, his braids trembled, then stuck to the ice.  “You must leave.  I admire your courage, but I can’t let anyone else die in here.”

All of us seized up when we heard another eerie moan from the chambers.

“There has to be something we can do to help out!  Just tell us where they are and we can help set them free!  Besides, if you have been here since last Christmas, or even longer than that, then why does it look like you got armor recently?”

“I tried to fight them after being enslaved here for years, I got some armor left behind my fallen brothers and an intact weapon.  Those bastards must have forgotten to destroy it.”  The elven knight weakly raised a hand and pointed at the northern exit.  “If you still wish to find my brothers, just follow that direction for a while and you should find them.”

Scott and I both share a look when we could feel the ice shift beneath us.

“I’m still taking the lead.” My friend said, running off into the upcoming darkness.

I turn around and tried to assist the knight, who was still lying on the ground.

“Don’t try and save me.  I am going to die from my wounds anyway.  Just leave.”

\---

As we traveled deeper into the cave system, we both developed a shiver.  After seeing the constant color tones of white and blue, the patterns seemed to almost hypnotize us.  With every step, the moans of the beasts grew closer and closer.

We reach another intersection and I shut my eyes and hold my hand to my forehead.  A band of frost wound around my head and neck like a noose.

“Phil?”

“This cold is screwing with my brain.  Don’t worry about me.” I said.  I looked at my watch.  The time was 10:30 PM.  If the elf was right, then the curse that bound them to the cave system was going to be nullified soon.  I hoped that he was right about the reinforcements that would try to stop the beasts, too.  I crouched down to mark another X on the ground.

Suddenly, my friend’s hands shook at his flashlight.  “Phil!  Do you see that?” He hissed.

I follow the beam.  There wasn’t anything but the ravenous darkness and the monotone frost walls.

“You’re seeing things.  Come on, we need to keep going forward.”

“Wooooooooosh…” Venting air circulates through the chambers, sending chills down my spine like lightning down a rod.  Every step we make slowly cracks the ice below.

Then, the passage opened up again.  The ceiling rose several times its original height, and the walls were fraught with gaps.  The noises made us cover our ears in pain.  Bellows from the beasts boomed.

As we passed by one of the gaps, I saw one of the technicolor titans for a moment.  I gasped, frozen in place before Scott yanked me back.  He put a finger to his mouth.

Peeking out from the wall, he got a good look at the beasts.  He made a chopping motion across his neck.

The ground suddenly started to tremor as something began to approach.  I pushed myself against the wall.  Tendrils from the alert beast scraped against the top of the wall.  My fingernails dug into the frost as the beasts’ sniffing grew louder and louder.  I turned my eyes up and saw the toothy throat appear over the wall.  By my feet were a row of stones.  I took one of them and threw it as hard as I could into the darkness.  Sensing the new noise, the beast retreated curiously.  When the coast was clear, we passed by the other gaps, desperate to get away and reenter the enclosed hole.

\---

After traveling for what seemed like hours and through a monotonous pathway of just the same chamber over and over again, we stopped at a dead end.  Massive columns of ice shot from a pit of nothing but darkness below.  The only thing that separated my friend and I from the depths was a winding bridge of solid ice.  Right where the other side of the bridge stuck, was a giant wall of permafrost.  Beyond the wall were dozens of other chambers nearby that came from who knows where.

And right behind that wall: sounds of people pleading for help started to generate from the abyss.  This was the elves’ prison.

“Watch for any of those beasts.  Here.”  I handed him a rope from my backpack, set the heavy weight aside, and tied it around me.

Kneeling down, I clasped my hands around the cold, dead ground, slowly sliding across the icy passage.  Out of instinct, I peered down the abyss.  Droning from below enters my ears.  Wisps of the beasts slunk in and out like dragons around treasure, wary of any trespassers.

Like a sloth, I inched my way down the damp, frigid slide.

Crunch.  I shielded my head against the ice and halted for a moment.  When I loosened my grip, I inspected the ice for any stress.  Sighing in relief after finding none, I continued forward.

Checking the depths below, I spotted some of the creatures beginning to rise from the abyss.  I tucked my arms underneath, hoping that the wrapping paper beasts would not see me.

The banging came closer and I watch Scott hide in a fissure, still keeping the rope attached.

The panting from the beast grew louder.  Its fingers crunched down on the ice.  I clenched my jaw to prevent my teeth from chattering and alerting the beast.  Ten technicolor tentacles arose from the treacherous trench, analyzing my movements.  One of the tentacles dripped blood from a fresh kill, the residue dripping on the ice.  I balled my fists as this hideous appendage slunk inches away from my face.  

I glanced at my watch.  

The time was 11:00. Reinforcements wouldn’t come out until midnight.  Even if they came out now, there’s no way in hell they would reach us in time.

The barbs from its tentacles scratched against the ice in delight.  Right as it was about to touch the hairs on my nose, it gave a shudder, deciding I wasn’t worth going after.

“This isn’t going to work. I’m getting out of here.” I thought.  Scott gave me a shrug.

“What are you doing?” He mouthed. 

I make a slicing motion across my neck.  Putting my ear to the ice, I waited for the tremors to decrease.  Then, I scooted myself up the ice.  Right when I was about ten feet away from the platform, I got out of my crouch.

SNAP!

A massive split in the ice resonated through the chambers, making the color retreat to my boots.  Dozens of hands from the herculean beasts arose from the depths.

“Run.  NOW!” I shouted at Scott.  The combined weight of all the beasts made the bridge crumble to bits like a burnt marshmallow.  I bolted for the opening and made a jump for it.  My foot slipped against the rim of the cave, sending me into the abyss.  Scott pulled the line tight, leaving my legs dangling.  With a death grip, I held firm onto the rope as my friend yanked me out of the chasm.  He stepped back a bit.

When my head pointed down, the headless beasts began to climb up from the icy pit.

“Pull me up, you idiot!” I screamed.  And he did with a quick motion, pulling my legs away from the grasp of the closest beast in the nick of time.

“Go, go, go, go, go!” I motioned.

Pouring all the adrenaline in our legs, we rushed out of the cave, following the bedliner markings.  More beasts joined in the hunt from the hollowed open area.  Intersections from before passed by like bullets from a firing squad.  The ground shook with the force of the beasts’ pounding.

I turn around.  The technicolor titans flooded in swarms of two, then three, then four.  Before I could process my reaction, twenty more showed up.  Tentacles grasping at the air, they all started fighting over who would kill us.

I looked at my watch.  The time was 11:30.

“Dammit!” I shouted at my watch.  I pulled out the last remaining canister of paint and threw it behind me like a grenade.  My actions only enraged the monsters.

Then, the intersections began to decrease.  Simultaneously, their tentacles continued to launch at us.  One of the monsters tried to leap at us, slamming a hand down with the force of an anvil on a cartoon character.

CRASH!  Icicles from above rained down on the ground.  Some of them landed on the beasts.

CRAAAAAAAACK!  Pairs of colossal icicles came crashing down.  The beasts’ pursuit still remained unhindered.  Frozen shrapnel flew out from the beasts’ impact.  I held my hands over my head.

“Agh!” I exclaimed when some of the shards cut up my sleeve and arm.  Blood flew right off my arm and stuck to the fabric.

“We won’t be able to out run them!” Scott yelled.

Out of the distance, I saw the fallen soldier from before, now lying as a corpse.  We both darted past him, watching the beasts pound him into a mass of fluid.

We came back to the hole that we entered through.  We took our phones out of our bags and cram ourselves back into the hole.  The tentacles continued to thrash at us.  All of the monsters battered at the outer wall in a rage.  Some of the ceiling caved in.  My legs were pinned when a slab came down.  Grabbing an ice pick, Scott chipped away at the ice, allowing me to go free.  After going right through the passage, we ran past all of the dead bodies and watched the stampede make pancakes out of the deceased bastards.

Finally, the exit was in sight and we dove out of the cavern entrance and watched as the beasts just stood there, before pounding in fury and running away.

I gave Scott a frown.  “I feel bad for all those elves still trapped in the cave.  And what about those guys that will be forced to fight this continuous battle?”

“Agreed.  But I think I might have an idea.”  Scott ran off to his rusty old pick up.

"Idea?  We don’t have any useful weapons!” I declared.

“Not yet,” he floored the truck, snow kicking off from the tires and turning around.

“Where are you going Scott, you idiot?!” I yelled.

Before I knew it, he had vanished.  I turned my head to the beasts.  Whenever they pushed up against the barrier between the outside world and the caverns, hot pink sparks in the shape of Norwegian runes flew out.

I gave my watch a look.  11:40. I began to rub my hands.  My teeth chattered when the beasts returned, fighting against the magic wall that kept them inside.  The monsters knew that their chance of freedom would come soon.  As the monsters grew more impatient, they began to push harder and as more of the magic wore off, the less the wall could push them back.

11:50. A halo of emerald green surrounded me. Snowflakes fell faster and faster, glinting off the mysterious aura.

11:53. The magic runes chaining the bastards to the inside of the cave flickered.  It was only a matter of time before the barrier would cease to exist.

11:54.

11:55.

11:56. From the aura on the ground, fifty elven warriors spawned right out of the ground like zombies rising from graves.  Upon seeing the beasts, they readied their swords.  The elves stepped back when one of the monsters reached a hand out towards us.

11:57. Finally, Scott had arrived with dozens of AK-47’s and containers of clips of ammo.  I rushed over, scooting through the warriors and scooped up all of the weapons.

“Is the safety off for all of them?” I asked.

Scott gave me a thumbs up.  

11:58. I alerted the soldiers, teaching them how to fire a gun.  The knights threw away their swords and aimed the weapons at the entrance of the cave.

11:59. I got into position and pulled up some Christmas heavy metal music on my phone, setting it to full freaking blast.

12:00. The seal broke and we all fired at once.  Beasts dropped like flies as the bullets tore through their bodies like molten wire against butter.  One of the beasts escaped from the battle.  Scott and I wheeled around and finished the beast off.  The night was lit up by the countless sparks from our guns.

And just like that, they were all exterminated.  The elven warriors began to cheer now that their adversaries were finally defeated after so many years.

Not long after our fight, we managed to head back in, coming out with all the trapped warriors and slaves.  Father Christmas, in scarlet armor, suddenly appeared in a vortex of frost, thanking us for our sacrifice.  And yes, after all we did for him, he gave my friend and I free shit.  For me, a fresh gaming computer.

As I am posting this on my shiny new laptop, I just wanted to say that I found it ironic that the dudes that hated the materialistic aspects of Christmas ended up fucking saving it.  And you must be wondering, do I believe in Christmas now?  Two words: hell yeah!
