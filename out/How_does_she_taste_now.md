It all started when she began working there. She was average height, long silky red hair, slim build but with muscle and a gorgeous face. Even her personality was amazing. I've heard about her from some of the other people at Scott's office and everyone loves her. I was admiring her when Scott spoke up. 

"Ally this is Scarlett our new intern. Scarlett this is my wife Ally." 

I gave her a smile. "Nice to finally meet you!" 

"Likewise." She says as she flashes me a smile however, this wasn't a kind smile. It was more condescending. As if she thought she was better than me. 

There was a silence before my husband spoke up again. 

"Well thank you again honey for the lunch. I have a big project I need to get back to but I will see you at home." After a quick kiss on the cheek he was on his way. 

A couple of weeks go by and I notice a change in Scott. He was becoming cold and distant. It wasn't a big change at first mostly just small arguments but it quickly changed into coming home late and more sudden work trips. I tried to brush it off as his company were making some big moves and needed him to put some extra effort in but after a while he would hide his phone and turn it the other direction with every notification. I didn't want to believe he was possible cheating on me. From my perspective we had the perfect relationship. We communicated and told each other if the other one was fucking up. I tried to give him space and figure out the problem but I just..couldn't. 

After about a month I decided to surprise him at work with lunch. I had the day off and figured this would brighten up his day. On the elevator ride up I made light conversation with Scott's co-worker John. 

"Ally look um.. maybe-" 
*ding* the elevator doors opened interrupting his sentence. 

"Well this is me! I will see you on Saturday for the barbecue." 

I step out and look back as the doors were closing again. He looked disappointed but didn't say anything else. I headed down the hall to Scott's office. As I drew closer I noticed the blinds were shut. I assumed he just wanted privacy for whatever big thing he was working on now. I open the door and before I can say anything I see a shirtless Scott with his back turned to me kissing Scarlett's neck. I quickly and quietly shut the door. My face red with anger I storm back down towards the elevator. How could he do this to me? To us? What could I have possible done wrong to cause this? I'll make him regret this if it's the last thing I do. 

I pulled up to the house and threw myself on the bed. I pulled out my laptop and began searching her on every possible platform. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter you name it. It took me a few days but once I found her I looked for any street signs from her daily morning jog inspirational quote posts to get an idea for where she lived. I was able to make a 2 mile radius and made myself a map. I waited until the next time my husband let me know he would be coming home late to see if I could find his car. It didn't take long to find thankfully and now I can put my plan into motion. 

Scott would be at her house for two hours and then he would leave and come home. This particular night I rented a car, texted Scott that I would be going out with my girlfriends tonight and not to wait up for me. I parked down the street and waited for him to leave. Finally I watched Scott pull out of her driveway. I waited a while to ensure he wouldn't come back for something. I backed up into her drive way. She'll never know what's coming next. 

The next night I stood in the kitchen cooking Scott's favorite dinner. I heard the front door open and swing shut as he placed his bag on the couch. 

"Hey sweetie." 

A look of distraught covered his face. 

"The weirdest thing happened today." 

"Yeah? Do you want to talk about it?" 

"Scarlett never made it to work today." 

"Ok? She could be sick." 

"No. She never even called out. Someone from the office knows her and went to check on her. Everything in her house was untouched. Her car, phone, wallet and clothes all still there. Even her neighbors say they never saw her going for her daily morning jog." 

He looked down at his phone assumingely trying to see if maybe this was all just a joke and surely she would text him any minute. I pull a bowl from the cupboard and poured the stew into it. A sense of glee filled my entire body as I walked over to him.

"I'm sure she'll turn up soon." I said with a sympathetic look. "Please eat up." 

I sat in front of him watching as he devoured his meal. 

"This is great. It does taste different though. Did you use a new meat?" 

"Oh you've had her before."

He looks up at me with a puzzled yet concerned look on his face. "What do you mean babe?" 

A sinister smile stretches over my cheeks. 

"How does Scarlett taste now?"
