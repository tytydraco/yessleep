This is part 1 of a multipart series. This series is based on true events, the names and the timeline have been changed for anonymity. But the locations and some scenes are true to the events that actually happened...



I don’t dream often, but even when I do, I don’t ponder on my dreams. To me, they’re the brain's way of coping with the reality we live in, giving us condensed and digestible images or films to understand the stress we deal with daily. However, there are other times that after having a dream, something happens in the real world that, well to put it plainly, correlates directly with the dream had while in the world of slumber. Those are the dreams I pay attention to. 



They’re deeper than deja vu, more like a premonition of things to come. I’d be lying if I said this happened to me often, I’m not claiming to be some kind of psychic. But regarding the dream I just had, I remember seemingly important parts as clear as glass. But, just like any dream, there are segments that I can’t recall. It’s what I imagine someone who has just woken up from surgery feels. They’re aware they had surgery but don’t know the details.



The beginning of the dream is clear to me. I was standing, staring blankly at the end of an aisle of a store. It took me a moment to figure out where I was, but after looking down the narrow aisle and seeing that it was lined with toys, I realized I was in a toy store. My blank expression broke into a glee filled smile as I excitedly waltzed down the aisle. From what I gather from this first part of the dream, I’m no older than 7 or 8. My happy expression only intensified when I saw that I was in the train section. I remember loving Thomas The Tank Engine at around this age so I wasted no time exploring the aisle. 



I probably watched Thomas And The Magic Railroad to a level of exhaustion, and I used to wear a little train conductor outfit everywhere I went, even to bed sometimes. The feeling I had looking through the trains in the aisle is what I suspect an alcoholic feels entering a Liquor Store and browsing the bottles. After what felt like an eternity of getting lost amongst the wooden train engines, track sets and toy tunnels, I finally found something that made all the other toys on the aisle, in my kid mind, feel irrelevant. A rare Special Edition Golden Thomas. 



My focus was broken by a voice from the end of the aisle. “That’s pretty cool.” It caught me off guard and I jumped a little. I looked to my right and I saw a little girl, about my age. She was wearing a navy blue dress with a matching hairband holding back her curly dirty blonde hair and her eyes were soft and friendly. “Oh! Hi!” I said nearly in a shout, showcasing that she had scared me. She stifled a giggle at my outburst. I tried to recover and play it cool. “Oh, hi. I didn’t see you there.” I said in a pathetic attempt at coolheadedness. 



I knew it didn’t work when she giggled again. “My name is Wendy. The train. It's cool.” She said as she laughed. “What?” I said cluelessly. “Oh! Yeah, I’ve wanted it forever. I’ve only seen it in commercials. Even his face is gold. It’s cool because normal Thomas has a gray face.” I said, feeling a little nerdy. “Oh, My name is Chris.” I added quickly. She walked over and stood next to me, turning to face the wall of trains that I was looking at. Now that she was closer to me I could see just how pale her skin was, like she hadn’t seen the sun in years. 



“She’s my favorite.“ Wendy said, pointing to a train above the Golden Thomas. It was Lady, the new character from the Magic Railroad. “Yeah, yeah she’s pretty cool.” I said, thinking to myself that the Golden Thomas was way cooler. She replied with a strange response, or at least odd for a six year old, she said, “They just got these this morning when freight came in on the truck. (She sighed deeply) Just in time for the Holiday shopping season. 



The funny thing is I bet half the associates aren’t even aware they’re in yet. Worse yet I don’t even think they know it’s black friday tomorrow. Nobody, and I mean nobody, pays attention around here.”. I looked at her as though she had spoken to me in Latin. “Huh?” I said confused. I had never heard a kid my age speak like an adult before. But instead of trying to play it off, she just turned to me and said, “I know a really cool place we can go, where we can watch The Magic Railroad.” 

“Really?! Where?” I said excitedly. She giggled and took me by the hand. “Come on, I'll show you.” We both ran out of the aisle and out of the toy store. 



It was then that I realized that we were in a mall and the toy store was just one of many stores. We ran and skipped together down the huge main hallway of the mall with stores with their lights off on either side of us, like they were closed. Somehow it didn’t shock me that we were the only ones there. Like I knew that the mall was closed and I just didn’t care. We ran until we came to the end of the hall where there was a Regal Movie Theater. It was open and the lights were on unlike the other stores but their glow didn’t seem to illuminate that shadowy corner of the mall. 



The green, red and purple neon lights above the entrance to the theater reflected off of the mall’s tile flooring that I was walking on. Sure enough there was a poster advertising the Thomas movie upon entering the theater. I looked around a little, everything seemed so familiar. The dim lighting, the weird carpet with a squiggly pattern all over it, the concession area and the smell of popcorn. I ran over to the candy wrack and just looked over all the different snacks they had. Wendy was standing in my periphery seemingly looking at the snacks too. I spotted a pack of twizzlers and went to grab for it. Sammy suddenly whipped around quickly to face me, almost like she was on a swivel. Her speed shocked me and I was about to laugh it off when I looked up and saw her face. Her brown eyes were now milky, sunken and cold, their warmth having left them. 



The little remaining color in her face was now gone, leaving it nearly gray and her skin almost seemed like cracked porcelain. Her mouth was gaping open like some rabid animal. Without moving her open mouth, a sound came out of it, like a speaker. In fact now that I think about it, it did sound like an old recording with the background static and grainy audio. She said, “Stealing is bad! Don’t do it, or else! Or else—!” Then it ended like it had been cut off.



I think she could see the fear in my expression because the color in her face returned and her eyes became normal again. She apologized, looking down at her feet, as though she was embarrassed, covering her face with her hands. “I’m sorry.” she said softly, sounding as if she were about to cry. It took a couple seconds but my fear subsided and after a moment of awkward silence, I said timidly, “It-it’s okay.” For some reason I felt bad for her. 



She didn’t look back up at me and I could tell she was crying now. I didn’t really know what to do but I wanted her to know it was okay. So I went to put my hand on her shoulder. Suddenly, before I could touch her, her whole body twitched dramatically once. I could see her skin was deathly white again and even with her hair obscuring her face, between the gaps in her blonde locks, one milky gray eye pierced my soul. I just stood in utter petrification as she whispered, “You can never leave Neverland.” I was terrified, I didn’t know what to do so I began to slowly back away. 



Once I had stepped away I was able to see something standing far behind Wendy down the hallway leading to the individual theaters. It was a shadow not Wendy’s shadow, it was someone else’s. Suddenly, Wendy glided out of view silently and without moving a muscle. It was as though she had frozen into a statue and the floor beneath her had become ice. She glided away from me quickly and without losing momentum.  She dissolved into the dark corridor with that tall shadow. The last thing I saw of Wendy was her glaring eye before it too disappeared. I was in shock, my kid brain was trying to grasp what was happening but failing. 



But now I could see the shadow in its fullness. It was the silhouette of a tall skinny woman with thin stringy hair and wearing a tattered nightgown or maybe a dress. I could make out no other details except her eyes. They were open wide and wild, almost glowing white from reflecting the neon lights. She was staring at me, silently watching. At that I sprinted out of the theater. I was too scared to make a sound. I wanted to shout for my mother but I couldn’t bring myself to yell. What if that girl, or whatever she was, heard me? She’d find me again, glide towards me and then… oh God where was my mom?  



This is where my memory fails me a little. I don’t know what happened but somehow, after running around for a while, I arrived back in the toy store and at the train aisle. The girl, or anyone else for that matter, was nowhere to be found, I was alone. I stood still catching my breath for a moment when the allure of the Golden Thomas captured me again. I cautiously entered the aisle but once I could see the golden train on the shelf, all apprehension left me. 



“That girl was crazy.” I thought to myself. “I wasn’t going to steal anything. Why would I steal when I could just ask my mom.” I was a little worried that I couldn't find my mom but I was sure she was around there somewhere. I walked over and I reached out to grab the train. Immediately when my fingers grasped the toy’s box everything around me changed. It was as if I were in a movie and I had just been placed in a new scene. I was leaving the toy store again and entering back into the larger structure of the mall. I was holding someone’s hand and they were pulling me forward, but not enough for it to hurt. 



Assuming it to be my mom, I first looked to see if I had the Golden Thomas but there was nothing in my hands. I looked up to ask if my mom had it only to realize that whoever had my hand was not my mother. I only saw a figure dressed in white and black. At first I didn’t know how to react until I saw that this thing wasn’t taking me to a different store. It was, instead, leading me toward a rusted white door with the paint chipping off. 



I panicked and began to scream. “Mom, help! No! Mom, I don’t know who this is! Help!” But as I cried and struggled the figure only gripped me harder and walked faster. At that moment a sound came from the loudspeakers in the mall, “Or else! Or else—”. It was that girl, Sammy. It repeated like that two times, being cut off at the end. But the third time it finished.“Or else! Or else Captain Hook will get you, Peter. Run Peter !” I was being pulled so hard toward the rusted door now that I thought my arm would dislocate. But no matter how hard I fought back, the black and white figure dragged me closer. 



My heart felt like it would pound out of my chest and I continued to scream. “Stop! Please, Mom! Somebody help!” From beyond the rusted door I could hear a muffled sound. It became clearer as I was being dragged closer. Carnival music, it was out of tune carnival music, or at least something resembling that. The door swung open and the doorway led only to pitch darkness. From within the darkness I heard the music clearly, it was a haunting rendition of A Pirates Life For Me accompanied by what was either the sound of kids screaming in glee or screaming in terror, it was impossible to distinguish. All effort to escape was hopeless. The stranger, Captain Hook, pulled me in the darkness. The sound of the ghostly music and the children was instantly replaced by the sound of a phone ringing, it was my phone. It jolted me awake and I was freed from the grasp of the nightmare.



I immediately turned over to face my nightstand where my phone was. I grabbed it and was blinded by its brightness. My brain was still fuzzy from sleep so this felt like a flashbang. Through my tired squinted eyes I saw that it was an unknown number and I typically let those go to voicemail. Still as an adult I don’t like talking to strangers. Upset that this person had just interrupted my sleep, as horrifying as my nightmare was, I slammed my thumb down dramatically on the red icon. I placed it back on my nightstand and rolled over. I wasn’t tired anymore, that dream and then my phone was like an instant shot of espresso topped off with adrenaline. 



I laid there for a little just thinking and mulling over my thoughts, mulling over the dream. Through my blinds I could see that it was morning time so after I had a little more time in bed I decided to get up and start my day. No use in waiting for my alarm. After letting my dog out and getting ready for work I checked my phone and saw that I had indeed been left a voicemail. I told myself that I would listen to it after I got off from work. I put my phone in my pocket, said bye to my pup and left the house. 



All day at work I felt off, like there was a growing anxiety within me, in my core. I work at a warehouse and my job is to basically stack pallets of product, wrap the pallet in plastic and get it ready to ship out on a truck. It’s a job that requires some attentiveness. But all day I was spacing out having day dreams almost like I was in an anxious haze, yet I couldn't pinpoint the source of the anxiety. At lunch I sat in the cafeteria on site just staring at my ramen. I was hungry but I was too caught up in my own head to want to eat.



“You okay there Chris?” My head shot up to see my manager John sitting across the table from me. “You okay man? You don’t look too good.”

“Yeah, uh… yeah. I’m fine, I-I just didn’t sleep very well yest- last night, I mean. But I’m fine.” I said, nearly stuttering. I could tell that John knew something was up that I wasn’t telling him by the way he looked at me. “Look, I’m over staffed today, just not enough freight coming in.” John said. “You look like you could use a day, plus it’s Friday. Why don’t you take the rest of the day off.” I was hesitant to accept, I felt guilty leaving. But John didn’t really phrase it as a question, so I obliged. 



When I arrived home I was greeted by my dog Dianna, a Pitbull Labrador mut. While I usually reciprocate her greeting, I was in such a daze that I didn’t acknowledge her at all. She immediately could tell something was off about me. She even started acting shady towards me, keeping her distance and side eyeing me. I was exhausted and so I just went upstairs to bed. It was strange, as I went up my stairs, I couldn’t help but notice that the darker areas of my house were noticeably more dull. I collapsed onto my bed with my shoes still on and almost instantly fell into a dreamless sleep. I woke up the next day at 6 AM. I had slept for over 12 hours. 



After that my weekend went fine. Nothing really noteworthy happened to be honest. I mostly just sat around and I at some point wrote down my nightmare in my journal while I watched Friends. On Monday, three days after the incident at work, I was actually leaving work and sitting in my car about to drive out of the parking lot when I remembered the voicemail. I pulled it up on my phone and listened. “Hi, Chris. This is Detective Connor Davidson with the Richland Police Department. Do you remember me? I know it’s been… has it been 3 years already? Damn. Anyway, would you mind calling me back when you get this? I have an update. Thanks.”I was in a little shock. I hadn’t heard Connor’s voice in a long time. Not since I had lived in Richland Washington 3 years prior. Not since all those horrible things happened.



Sitting in my car my mind was reeling after hearing Connor’s voice. I was  fixated on the phrase, “I have an update.” Over and over again it repeated in my mind and a lump formed in my throat as I pressed the Return Call icon on my phone. The phone rang twice and then Connor answered. “Detective Davidson.” He said. For a second I didn’t say anything, unsure how to even introduce myself because my brain was so occupied. “Hello?” Connor broke the awkward silence. I finally spat something out.



“H-hi Connor, it's Chris. Jackson. You called me a couple days ago. With an update?”

Connor’s voice immediately became friendly and full of recognition.

“Oh, hey man. How’s it going? It’s been a long time.”

“I’m okay.” I said. Connor’s cordialness broke me out of my weird mindset. “It has been a long time. Last we talked it was Officer Davidson I believe. You must like the pay raise.”

“Oh yeah, it's great. I can actually afford my car payment and groceries.”

We both chuckled. 

“How do you like being a Detective?” I asked.

“It’s pretty great, to be honest. I basically get paid to write reports and eat donuts at the station.” He said, obviously joking. 

“I bet in a town like Richland, there’s not a whole lot of action.” I said with a laugh. 

There was silence on his end of the phone after I said that. It seemed I had reminded him of the reason he reached out to me in the first place.

“Have you been keeping up on the news here?” I no longer lived in Richland so I hadn’t.

“No? What happened?” I asked, but I had a feeling I knew what the news was, praying that I was wrong. Praying that it wasn’t happening again.

“We got him.” He said. “We caught James Reese.” I was once again in shock. I was speechless. I was wrong. My fear indeed did revolve around James, but that he had resurged and was killing again, not that he had been caught. 



Connor continued as I had nothing to say. “Late last Thursday, a police station in Baker City received an anonymous tip that he was hiding in an abandoned house. They pursued it and, well it turned out to be true. They took him into custody Friday morning.”

“Baker City? Like you mean Oregon?” I asked.

“Of all places.” Connor replied. “The state agreed to extradite him here, to Benton County, for prosecution.

I still didn't know what to say. I just blurted out the first thing that came to my mind.

“Why?” I said.

“Why?” Connor repeated as to say “what do you mean ‘why?’”

“Why are you telling me this, Connor? I don’t want to know this.”

Connor sighed sympathetically, almost regretfully.



“This case is moving fast. He’s going to appear in court sooner than later. And unfortunately you’re a key witness to what happened, Chris. It’s more likely than not that you're going to be called on to testify when he is brought before the judge. And seeing that I’ve been made lead investigator on the case, I thought I would give you a heads up before an attorney did it first.”



Now I understood. “Thanks.” I said dryly. We talked for a little longer, catching up and making pleasantries. After we hung up, I just sat in the silence of my car, contemplating and dreading the fact that I was going to have to dig up memories I had worked hard to bury. The skeletons in my closet had been stirred up.
