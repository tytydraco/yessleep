If you're reading this, it means the connection to the coordinate (3.1525° N, -20.2503° W) has been established, and this message may be your last hope to avoid what's about to come.

This is Emit. K4L-K1 from the coordinate (20°65'N, 65°20'W). We can only contact through coordinates because, from where I come from, the concept of time and space has been neutralized. I am looking for the Emit in your coordinate, as what I am about to tell you can only make complete sense to an Emit.

In your coordinates, a revolutionary new technology must be on the rise. In your coordinates, it's known as Neuralink. This is where it all went wrong in our coordinate too. And no, for the next few elapses, or at least the class, the Neuralink technology will not cause any major issues. However, what comes soon is what you need to be aware of.

If you're still unaware of what Neuralink does, here’s what I gathered about its current functionality in your coordinate:

Allows people with paralysis to control devices with their thoughts.

> May help improve memory and cognitive abilities.

> May help restore motor, sensory, and visual functions.

> May help treat neurological disorders.

> It's designed to record and trigger neural activity.

> It uses Bluetooth to communicate.

> It's powered by a battery that can be charged wirelessly. 


What started as, at best, a controversial technology turns into something completely different from its current stage.

In the coordinate (20°35'N, 35°16'E), Neuralink scientists achieve what you may consider impossible right now.

They unlock the functionality to transcend memories beyond Emit. It no longer runs on primitive technology like Bluetooth or even solar power—Starlink takes care of all that.

They started their tests with one goal in mind: How far can human thoughts and memories go? What else can our neurons do apart from controlling apps? Their first goal was to take a subject’s memories back to coordinate (3.1525° N, -20.2503° W). They were successful with smaller jumps, such as weeks. But sending memories to such a distant negative coordinate was their most ambitious program yet.

The only condition was that there must be a trigger point in the current coordinate. You see, memories need something to latch onto. Technically, it should have been impossible to get it running successfully. They never created a trigger in coordinate (3.1525° N, -20.2503° W).

So, what exactly is this trigger? Well, it could be a point of realization for anyone—any data that mentions the working of Neuralink in the positive distant coordinate.

We still don't know exactly how they got it working, but they did successfully send a memory to the negative distant coordinate.

That was a turning point in the history of Emit.

I apologize for mentioning Emit again and again without telling you what it is. It stands for:

Enhanced Memory Integration Technology (E.M.I.T.)

E.M.I.T. was the cutting-edge Neuralink system that enabled consciousness projection into the past. It could take your current consciousness to a very distant negative coordinate as long as you existed in that coordinate. It was initially designed for self-improvement, but things went wrong when the CEO and then-advisor to the POTUS, Elon Musk, tried to use it on himself to explore history in its unbiased form.

I am receiving some static interference and will be logged off soon. But I'll try to reconnect at a later coordinate, maybe.

For now, I can tell you this much:

Some call it a malfunction or maybe an orchestrated interference, but Musk ended up way back in one of the darkest coordinates of your known history at that point.

1940.
