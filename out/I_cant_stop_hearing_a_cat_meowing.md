I have always been a normal guy with a normal routine. My routine was simple, but it made me happy: wake up, have breakfast, go to my minimum-wage job, come back home, have dinner, and relax.

I didn't have any friends, but that didn't bother me. I've always been someone who valued my own company more. After all, in the end, it's just us who will be here until the end. I loved my routine, but, like a divine punishment, something decided to ruin everything I had built.

It all started one night when I was in the backyard smoking, enjoying my garden under the soft moonlight. Suddenly, I started hearing a cat meowing. Since my house is surrounded by a tall concrete wall, I went out to the street to see if the animal needed help, but I found nothing. However, the meowing continued. I attributed the sound to a cat that must have been walking on the roof, but the darkness of the night prevented me from confirming my theory. I gave up the investigation, put out my cigarette, and went back inside to sleep. After all, my routine couldn't stop.

However, the cat didn't stop; it continued meowing for eight straight hours. It was maddening. My biggest fear was that the neighbors would think I was torturing some cat. As the first rays of sunlight entered through my window, I got up with a grunt, caused by the stress of thinking about what awaited me that day. Ten hours of work without any sleep, but nothing that a liter of coffee couldn't solve.

The meowing ceased only when I left the house and started to move away. The first thing I thought was that it must be a neighbor's pet asking for food, a common thing for cats to do. After a torturous ten-hour shift, I came home defeated, only thinking about sleep. I didn't even want dinner; I could have a hearty breakfast the next day.

But the meowing returned. It seemed that this damned cat had waited for me to come home to start meowing again. I decided to ignore this hellish cat and go to sleep. To understand, I don't have light sleep; I can sleep with various sounds and lights if I'm really exhausted. However, this meowing... it had something that was simply maddening. No matter how much I tried, I just couldn't sleep.

Another day passed, and for the second consecutive night, I couldn't sleep because of the damned meowing. As the sunlight entered through the window, in desperation, I put on my clothes and ran to knock on my neighbors' doors. A sleepy-looking lady answered. She was a mother of three children who had just woken up to prepare things for them.

Desperately, I asked the lady if she could do something about the meowing cat, that I hadn't been able to sleep for two nights because of this constant meowing. She looked at me confused and said that she didn't have any pets, especially because they make a lot of noise and her children are light sleepers. The lady asked why I thought the sound was coming from her house if she didn't hear anything there.

I was perplexed and stopped to think. Why did I think the cat was from the lady's house? That's when I realized that the sound of the cat's meowing seemed to follow me around the house. I apologized to the lady and ran back home to check my theory, and indeed, it was true. This hellish cat was following me around the house.

After thinking a bit, I realized what might be happening: this hellish cat was in my attic. I called work, saying I was sick, and waited for the store to open while smoking a cigarette. I couldn't eat; I was too nervous and needed to solve this problem urgently. I waited and waited, and when the time came, I ran to the hardware store to buy a ladder and climb to the roof to catch this demon from hell.

I got home, positioned the ladder, and climbed up. Nothing, there was nothing there. But I could hear it, this damned meowing. “Inside the attic!” I thought, and I started removing all the tiles. I dismantled my entire roof and nothing. There was no cat. But the meowing continued, closer than it had ever been. Tired and defeated, I attributed all this to stress and lack of sleep.

I ordered a sleeping pill via delivery and went inside. I didn't even bother to put the tiles back; I just wanted to rest and stop hearing that cat. I went inside, ate, prepared my things for the next day, and got ready to sleep.

I took a sleeping pill, put on headphones to drown out the cat's sound, and lay down. It didn't work; it was the opposite, actually. It was as if the cat's meowing drowned out the music.

Stressed and tired, I threw the headphones across the room and lay down again. An hour passed and nothing, the pill didn't work, and I couldn't sleep. I took two more pills. Two more hours passed, and I still couldn't sleep because of this damned meowing. I took two more pills and still nothing.

Exhausted and desperate, I got up determined to find this damned cat and tape its mouth shut to stop it from meowing. Feeling powerless in this whole situation, I ran around the house shouting insults and curses at this damned cat. But that only made things worse.

The sound changed from a meowing to a more frightening noise, like a cat fighting another cat, getting louder and louder, driving me crazy. I grabbed a hammer and started making holes in the walls, trying to find and kill that wretched animal. I couldn't take it anymore, and the sound didn't diminish. I tried screaming to make it stop, but nothing worked. My ears hurt; I couldn't stand the noise anymore.

In desperation, I grabbed a pencil and pushed it deep into my ears. I did this to both ears. The pain was enormous, but finally, there was silence. The damned cat was gone.

The police entered my house half an hour later. A neighbor must have called them after hearing all the commotion, probably the lady I accused of having the cat. I don't blame her; she must have feared for her children.

They took me to the hospital. The recovery was difficult and painful, and they informed me that I would never regain my hearing.

It wasn't a problem, really. It was a relief. I don't know what I went through, whether it was something supernatural or the stress accumulated exploding in my head, but it was undoubtedly the worst moment of my life.

Now I'm learning sign language and how to read lips. It's very challenging, but I'm trying to improve. They told me that opening up about what happened would do me good, so I'm here to share my story with you.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I will try to answer all of you as best as I can.
