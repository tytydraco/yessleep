Hey.

It’s me again.

Sorry for the silence. I don’t know if anyone actually cares, but I don’t want to just disappear like the rest of the world without at least trying to leave something behind. I had every intention of posting sooner—updating you on the plan, the build, the small victories that felt like hope even when I knew better.

But things got.

Well.

I don’t even know how long it’s been. The sun rises, too bright. The nights fall, too empty.

But its been long enough that my body still aches in places I didn’t know could hurt. Long enough that the fear has rewired my instincts to listen.

Because we did it.

We built the bridge.

We made it to the water tower.

And we almost didn’t make it off.

I should’ve updated sooner. I should’ve written something, even just a sentence. But I couldn’t.

Not because of a lack of signal. Not because we ran out of power.

Because I didn’t know what to say.

I still don’t.

How do you describe the kind of fear that makes your body forget both flight and fight? How do you explain seeing something—really seeing it—and realizing you weren’t supposed to? That it wasn’t meant for your eyes, wasn’t meant for your mind, and yet there it is, filling the spaces of your brain that shouldn’t hold it?

How do I tell you what we saw?

How do I make you believe me?

I don’t know. But I’ll try.

You remember the Skyfall. The ground swallowing itself. The way the land isn’t just rising but pulling.

It’s why we needed the bridge. Hawthorn and I knew the tree that held his house wouldn’t last forever. The trunk was strong, thick, but the higher we built, the more unstable it became. The roots held—but the earth beneath them was not the same earth we had known. It shifted when we weren’t looking. 

We had to get higher.

The water tower was our best bet. Sturdy and tall. It was meant to hold weight, to survive tornado valley. If anything could last in this new world, it was that.

The bridge was supposed to be simple. Wood, steel beams, tension cables—stuff Hawthorn knew how to work with.

It should have worked.

But we weren’t the only ones trying to climb.

Hawthorn and I spent days reinforcing the platform, scavenging wood, metal, whatever we could fish up from the ghost town below without getting swallowed by the land still swelling beneath us. I won’t bore you with the details of every knot tied, every board nailed. Just know it was exhausting. Sun-up to sun-down labor. Our hands blistered. Our muscles burned. I thought I had known pain before when I gave birth two weeks ago, but there’s something new about working through it when the ground you stand on might not exist tomorrow.

Hawthorn worked like a man running out of time, which—fair. We both were. He barely spoke except to bark orders, his jaw set so tight I thought his teeth might snap. I didn’t push him. He had his way of coping, and I had mine.

We lashed beams together. Reinforced them with tension cables we salvaged from a collapsed power line. Every step forward was a small, desperate act of survival. And for a while, it felt like we were winning.

The bridge wasn’t sturdy. I won’t lie to you. It swayed, groaned, and if you looked down, you could see where the world had split open, where the remains of the old earth had turned into something that breathed and consumed.

We went across one at a time. Hawthorn first. I held my breath as he stepped onto the first plank, watching it bend, watching the ropes pull taut.

He moved carefully, and I forced myself to breathe. He was strong. Balanced. If anyone could make it, it was him.

Halfway across, he turned back, jerking his chin. “Your turn.”

I hesitated. My stomach twisted into a thousand little knots. The bridge looked so much thinner from this angle.

“I won’t let you fall,” Hawthorn said, voice even.

I believed him.

So I went.

The planks creaked under my weight. The ropes shuddered. The ground below looked farther away than it should’ve been, shifting like something trying to wake up.

I focused on moving. One step, then another. Almost there.

And then—it stirred.

At first, I told myself it was only the land shifting, another convulsion of a world sloughing off the last remnants of human hands. But then I saw them.

Hands.

Or what should have been hands.

They did not rise—they bloomed, peeling themselves from the broken earth. Too long, too white, the color of something kept hidden from light, preserved in the deep places where no warmth had ever reached. The fingers flexed experimentally, as if testing the very concept of motion, of reality itself. My breath hitched, my body instinctively recoiling, though I had not yet fully understood.

And then they came crawling out.

I do not—

I cannot—

There are no words in any human tongue that can fully encapsulate the sheer, stomach-turning error of their existence.

Have you ever looked upon a thing so utterly, profoundly wrong that your mind, in some primal act of self-preservation, tries to reject it outright? As if by refusing to comprehend, you might be spared the consequence of knowing? That was them. Not creatures, not beings—concepts made flesh, something that had never been intended to take shape in a world of rules and physics.

Their limbs were too long, their forms stretched and uncertain, as if the idea of a body had been approximated by something that had never seen one. Their torsos heaved like breath but without rhythm, without necessity, only the motion of something imitating life. And their faces.

God. Their faces.

Or the lack thereof.

No eyes, no mouths, no features at all—only smooth, taut skin, stretched where expressions should have been.

And they moved.

Not like us. Not like anything with bones or tendons or the natural limits of anatomy. They collapsed forward, then reassembled, shifting in ways that defied understanding, learning as they went. As if the very act of movement was foreign to them. As if they had spent eternity waiting, still and patient, and now—

Now they were figuring out how to exist.

How to reach.

How to take.

I sucked in a sharp breath. “Hawthorn.”

His head snapped up. His eyes locked onto mine, then flicked past me—down.

“Shit.”

They were pulling themselves up the support beams. Up toward the bridge.

And we ran.

There was no plan. No thought. Just run.

The bridge shook under our weight. Ropes snapped, planks cracked, the world snapped its grimy jaws beneath us. One of the things let out a sound—not a scream, not a growl. Something wet. Something that made my bones want to climb out of my skin and run ahead without me.

Hawthorn reached the tower first. He didn’t hesitate—just grabbed my arm and hauled me forward.

The moment my feet hit the metal platform, the bridge gave out.

It took us a long time to move. Even longer to think straight.

The water tower was stable. The metal was too smooth for anything to climb easily. The view stretched far—too far—across a world that no longer made sense.

I turned to Hawthorn, throat dry, my mind drawing a blank. “What now?”

He didn’t answer. Didn’t look at me.

His attention was on the hatch.

Because it was open.

And there was light inside.

Before I could even process it, something moved. An arc of a person’s shadow shifting.

“You should close that before something else gets in.”

A voice.

A human voice.

For the first time since the sky fell, we weren’t alone.

There were two of them.

Their names were Jud and Nelly.

Nelly was sharp-eyed, sharp-tongued, all angles and impatience. She had dark curls tucked into a bun, an oversized hoodie that might have been red once, and a knife bigger than my forearm. Her fingers twitched like she was always seconds from deciding we weren’t worth the risk.

Jud was her opposite—tall, broad, tired in a way that shaped his eye-bags purple. His locs were pulled back under a beanie, and he carried a gun I knew was empty. He never said it. Never admitted it. But I could feel it in the way he held it—a threat built from muscle memory and hope.

They’d been here since the first collapse. Since the land had swallowed itself. Since the sky had fallen apart.

They’d seen the things below.

And they’d seen worse.

“Close it,” Nelly said again, shifting on the ladder.

Hawthorn didn’t move.

“Close it.”

“And if we don’t?” His voice was even.

Nelly scoffed, jerking her chin toward the ruined bridge. “Then you wait for round two of whatever the hell that was, and I get to be the one who says ‘I told you so’ before we all die.”

Jud sighed, rubbing his temple. “We’re not looking for a fight.”

“Good,” I muttered, finally stepping forward. “Neither are we.”

That was enough for Hawthorn. He kicked the hatch shut with the back of his boot, sealing us in. The wind howled outside, rattling the tower’s frame. For a moment, no one moved.

Then Nelly grinned a flash of teeth.

“Well,” she said, twirling the knife between her fingers. “Guess we’re roomies now.”

We sat on crates and old storage bins, arranged in the kind of circle that only happens when people don’t trust each other yet. The inside of the tower was bigger than I expected—rusted pipes, dusty lanterns, makeshift cots made from stolen car seats.

Hawthorn leaned against the wall, his thick arms crossed. Nelly sat across from him, mirroring his stance, tapping the butt of her knife against the edge of her boot.

I focused on Jud. He seemed more willing to talk.

“How long have you been here?” I asked.

He exhaled through his nose. “Long enough to know you’re the first people we’ve seen.”

Hawthorn didn’t like that. I could tell by the way his jaw tensed.

“You sure?” he asked.

Nelly stopped spinning the knife. Her gaze flicked up. 

“You think we’re lying?”

“I think it’s hard to believe we’re the only ones left.”

Jud watched us, gaze heavy. “Believe what you want.”

The wind groaned against the tower’s walls, a sound like distant screaming.

I swallowed. “What else have you seen?”

Nelly grinned again, but this time, there was nothing sharp about it.

Just teeth.

“You don’t wanna know.”

Silence.

Then, of course, there’s Hawthorn—always ready to toss in his two cents, though at the end of the world, they’re worth less than nothing.

“Tell us anyway,” Hawthorn said.

Jud looked at Nelly. A silent conversation passed between them, something I wasn’t a part of. Then he sighed, shifting on his crate.

“The sky wasn’t supposed to fall,” he said finally. “And the things down there? They weren’t supposed to wake up.”

I felt my stomach twist. “So they were always there?”

Nelly let out a sharp, humorless laugh. “Where do you think the bodies go, sweetheart? The ones buried? You think the ground just lets them go?”

I stared at her. “That’s not possible.”

“Neither is the moon shattering, but here we are.”

Hawthorn shifted. I could feel his unease, the tension in his shoulders.

“Have you seen them up close?” he asked.

Jud nodded. 

“Yeah,” he said. “And I hope you never do.”

Nelly twirled the knife again.

Hawthorn’s eyes didn’t leave Jud. “Tell us.”

Jud exhaled, rubbing his face. “Why?”

“Because we need to know what we’re dealing with.”

Nelly scoffed. “Knowing doesn’t help. Just makes it worse.”

I leaned forward, elbows on my knees, my voice quieter. “Tell us anyway.”

Jud’s fingers tightened around his knee. “We heard them before we saw them,” he said finally. “Days before. Scraping. Dragging. Like—” He hesitated. “Like fingers against metal.”

A cold feeling crept up my spine.

“You were still in the tower?” I asked.

Jud nodded. “Didn’t think much of it at first. Wind makes weird sounds. Metal shifts. We figured it was just the land moving again.”

“And then?” Hawthorn pressed.

“And then we saw them.”

Nelly sighed, shoving the knife into her boot. “First one pulled itself out of the ground maybe fifty feet from the base of the tower.” Her voice was casual, but I could hear the edge beneath it. “We thought it was a person at first. Someone else who made it.”

Jud’s hands curled into fists. “Then it stood up.”

I could picture it too well. The stretched skin, the cracking of joints like they tested how to move, like they were learning how to exist. My stomach twisted.

“Did they come after you?” I asked.

Jud’s jaw tightened. He didn’t answer.

Nelly, however, grinned.

“We weren’t dumb enough to stick around and find out,” she said. “Climbed up, shut the hatch, stayed quiet. Watched from the gaps.”

Hawthorn narrowed his eyes. “What did they do?”

Nelly’s grin widened.

“They waited.”

The air in the room grew staler.

Jud exhaled, shaking his head. “Don’t make it sound like a game, Nelly.”

She shrugged. “It wasn’t. But it wasn’t a chase, either.” She tilted her head at us. “They don’t hunt like animals. They don’t move like us. You know that already.”

I did. I hated that I did.

Jud leaned forward, elbows on his knees. “They know we’re here.”

The wind outside groaned.

“But they don’t try to come up?” I asked.

Jud shook his head. “Not yet.”

Hawthorn frowned. “What are they waiting for?”

Jud held my gaze, eyes dark.

“I think they’re waiting for us to come down.”

Silence.

Nelly tapped her boot against the floor, staring up at the metal ceiling. “We ran out of food yesterday.”

I swallowed hard, my expression schooled. Hawthorn and I still had our rations, and we sure as hell didn’t say a peep.

“So we’ve got a choice,” Jud said. “We sit up here and starve, or we figure something out.”

“Figure what out?” I asked.

He exhaled.

“A way across.”

Hawthorn let out a dry laugh. “You wanna build another bridge?”

“No,” Jud said, shaking his head. “Bridges fall.”

He looked at me then, and his voice was steady.

“We need to make something stronger.”

Jud was right. Bridges fall.

We needed something stronger. Something that wouldn’t collapse beneath us, something that wouldn’t leave us stranded midair like a carcass strung up in a hunter’s trap.

Hawthorn crossed his arms, eyes narrowed. “Stronger how? We don’t exactly have steel beams lying around.”

“We don’t need steel.” Jud’s voice was even. “We need a path that moves with us.”

A path that moves. I frowned. “What does that mean?”

Nelly stretched, rolling her shoulders. “Means we stop thinkin’ like builders and start thinkin’ like survivors.”

Jud nodded. “We’re not gonna make a bridge. We’re gonna carry one.”

The idea hit all at once. I sat up straighter. “You’re talking about planks.”

“Exactly.” Jud tapped a finger against the metal floor. “We don’t build a fixed bridge that can fall. We use wooden planks, lay them across gaps as we go, pick them up behind us, and keep moving.”

Hawthorn’s eyes narrowed into thin slits. “That’s reckless as hell.”

“So is sitting here until we rot.” Nelly gestured to the empty supply crates. “The tower’s not gonna start growin’ food. If we don’t do something, we’re dead anyway.”

I ran a hand through my hair, mind racing. It could work. We’d have to move carefully—one plank at a time, one person crossing while the others secured the next step. It was slow, dangerous, but safer than any rope bridge. If something came after us, we could pull the planks away behind us, leaving nothing but open air.

“Alright,” I said. “Where do we get the wood?”

Nelly grinned. “Already thought of that.”

She stood, walked to the hatch, and pointed down.

“Water towers have support beams, don’t they?”

I felt my stomach drop. “You want to take apart the tower?”

“Not all of it,” Jud said quickly. “Just the parts we don’t need. It’s built to hold a massive tank of water, but the weight’s already drained out. We can repurpose some of the structure without compromising stability.”

Hawthorn muttered something under his breath, rubbing his temples.

“Look,” Nelly said, crouching in front of us. “We make a set of long, flat planks. We use them to get from rooftop to rooftop. We secure them with rope. We move as a unit. And we don’t stop until we find food, shelter, anything.”

I looked at Hawthorn.

He looked back at me.

He exhaled sharply. “This is stupid.”

“But does it work?” Jud asked.

Hawthorn didn’t answer for a long moment. Then, finally, he sighed.

“Yeah,” he muttered. “It works.”

We got to work.

Hawthorn and Nelly argued over which beams were actually “structurally unnecessary” while I sat with Jude at the edge of the platform, prying rusted nails out of a plank with stiff, aching hands. He worked next to me, quiet, the rhythm of our movements filling the dense air.

“You ever built anything before?” I asked after a while.

Jud huffed a small laugh. “Not unless you count IKEA furniture. Why?”

I shrugged, rolling my wrist to shake out the stiffness. “You’re good with your hands. You know how to move, how to handle tools. Doesn’t feel like you learned that from putting together bookshelves.”

For a moment, I thought he wasn’t going to answer. He pulled a nail from between his teeth, flicking it into the growing pile beside us.

“I used to work in a body shop.” His voice was even. “Engines, transmissions, sometimes full restorations. My dad had me under the hood by the time I was ten. Said I had a good ear for things that weren’t working right.”

That made sense. Jud had that kind of presence—that he could sense when something was about to give out. A human diagnostic tool.

I watched him for a moment before asking, “So… how’d you and Nelly end up here?”

He didn’t answer right away. Just exhaled, rolling a rusted nail between his fingers.

“We were on the road when it happened,” he said finally. “Had been for a while.”

“On the road?” I frowned. “Like… traveling?”

“Like running.”

That caught my attention. I straightened, watching his expression shift—tightening, sharpening, something shadowed curling at the edges.

“Running from what?”

Jud gave a slow, humorless smile. “Debt collectors, mostly.”

I blinked. “Seriously?”

“Dead serious.” He flipped the nail into the pile, stretching his fingers like the memory itself ached. “Nelly had a garage back in Texas. Good one, too. Honest work, solid reputation. But keeping a business running? That’s a whole different beast.”

I could already see where this was going. “She borrowed money.”

“Yeah.” He sighed. “From the kind of people who don’t send letters when you miss a payment.”

I winced. “Shit.”

“Yeah,” he repeated, dry. “By the time she realized she was in too deep, it was already over. We packed up and left before they could make an example out of her.”

The image of Nelly—both stubborn and sharp—fleeing from anything felt wrong. But even she had her limits. Even she had lines she wouldn’t cross.

“So you’ve been living on the road?”

“For almost a year.” Jud smirked faintly. “I think she hated it less than she let on. She liked working with her hands. Fixing things. Even if it was just a busted radiator marked free on the side of the highway.”

I found myself smiling despite everything. “Sounds about right.”

Jud chuckled. “Yeah. She was making it work. We were making it work. But then…” His voice trailed off.

I didn’t need him to finish.

Then the moon broke. Then the world opened up. Then everything fell apart.

Jud’s fingers tightened around the board. “We were just outside Des Moines when the first chunks started falling. Turned around, tried to head back, but the roads were already gone. The land was moving under us.”

He shook his head. “We climbed whatever we could. Got as high as possible. And when we saw the tower… we ran for it.”

I swallowed. “And you’ve been here ever since.”

“Yeah.” Jud exhaled, rubbing the back of his neck. “Waiting. Watching. Hoping we weren’t the only ones left.”

He looked at me then—really looked at me. “And then you showed up.”

The conversation quickly fizzled out and came to an end. 

Gathering what we needed, we’re now getting what little rest we can on the car seat cots, saving our strength for first light. 

Once we’re on the move again, I’ll update—if they don’t pull us under first.
