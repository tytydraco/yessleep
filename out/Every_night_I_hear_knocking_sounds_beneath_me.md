It all started a few weeks ago. I had already been living in the house for just over two years by then and had plenty of time to get used to every surface it had to offer. It might not be the most normal house one could find, but nothing strange had occurred until then. The layout could sometimes be a bit odd and it felt as if the rooms were placed haphazardly, but apart from that, it was generally a very spacious and pleasant house.

The reason I moved there was because my mother had recently passed away and I wanted to spend as much time with my father as I could before he also passed.

I was in bed and just about to close my eyes when I heard a dull but recurring noise coming from below me. I was confused since I lived alone. I concluded that I must have left something on by mistake. Perhaps the washing machine?

I reluctantly got out of bed and walked with tired steps down to the bathroom. But the closer I got, the clearer it became that the noise wasn't coming from there. It still seemed to come from below me. From the basement.

I must confess something to you; I'm not exactly the bravest person you'd meet. I really didn't want to go down there. I knew it was probably just an animal, but I still didn't want to risk getting infected by something. I decided to just ignore the noise and try to go back to sleep instead.

The next morning I had forgotten what happened and the noise was pretty much gone.

Unfortunately, it didn't stop there. Every night it was the same thing. The dull but regular noises filled my bedroom and I started to become more and more worried. Eventually one day I decided to walk down to the basement during the daytime to see exactly what was going on down there. It felt safer then somehow.

When I got down everything seemed just as it should be. Everything was in its place and I didn't see any animals anywhere. I was really confused. Something didn't feel right. The noises were only heard at night and I had no idea why. I told myself that they would surely stop soon.

I really wish that was how it turned out, but I was wrong. One night I had enough. I found a flashlight and headed down to the basement fully awake.

When I opened the basement door, the noises were still going strong. I listened for where the sounds might be coming from and it led me deeper into the basement.

I opened the door to a storage room and what awaited me on the other side I could never have imagined.

The storage room didn't look like I remembered it. There was a door and a window on the wall that I had never seen before. But that wasn't the worst part. On the other side of the glass... there stood a painted old man... His face was painted white and he waved me in.

I really wasn't prepared for this and something felt so wrong about him. What was a painted old man doing in my basement? He almost looked like a black-and-white TV character from bygone times. He must have been completely insane.

I felt my hairs stand on end and my heart thumped in my chest. I turned to leg it at that moment, but then the old man said something that immediately made me change my mind.

“I have someone you hold dear in here.”

I gasped. Then I noticed that the door further back in the room he was in opened and the one who opened it was... my father. But I swear it wasn't him. He looked completely lifeless as he stood next to the painted old man.

“Open the door with the key on the hook over there,” said the old man, pointing at the hook.

There was indeed a key. I was paralyzed. I barely dared to breathe.

I chose to trust my instincts and ran from there. Even if it was true that he was in there with him, it would be better if the police handled it. But it didn't add up... How could he have gotten there and why did the painted old man want me to open a door that had never existed before?

I tried with all my might to wake up, but this was no dream. I was immediately thrown back to reality when I heard the old man go back to banging on the door again. But this time the knocking was less controlled and more desperate. I swallowed and quickly hurried up the stairs. When I got up, I heard a scream... my father's scream. But it didn't sound genuine. Or maybe I just imagined it because I didn't want to believe it was true...

I locked the basement door and took out my mobile phone to dial 911.

I spent the rest of the night sitting quietly in the living room. It's indescribable how relieved I was when I heard police sirens.

I unlocked the basement door and two constables went down. After a while, they came back and told me they hadn't found anything.

“But, didn’t you see an old-fashioned indoor window in a storage room?” I asked puzzled.

“No, not that we know of,” said one of the constables.

I shook it off and realized I must have fallen asleep or something. I apologized for the inconvenience and didn’t want to pursue it further since the last thing I wanted was for them to think I was losing my mind.

Something about that experience felt so personal, but I couldn't remember ever falling asleep.

The worst part is that the banging noises still continue to this day. I'm thinking about moving, because to be honest, I can't take it anymore. My father actually passed away just recently and I miss him deeply… I hope I wasn't the cause.
