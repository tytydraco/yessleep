I'm writing this in real-time because I need someone to know what's happening. It's Halloween night, and something is very, very wrong.

An hour ago, around 8 PM, a man came to my door. Not a kid in a costume. A full-grown man in his forties, wearing jeans and a black t-shirt. He was holding a pillowcase.

"Trick or treat," he said.

I thought maybe he was joking, being ironic or whatever. I laughed nervously. "Aren't you a little old for this?"

He didn't smile. His eyes were watery and bloodshot, and they didn't blink. "Trick or treat," he repeated, expressionless, and something in his voice made my stomach twist.

I just wanted him gone, so I threw a candy bar in his pillowcase. He looked down at it, then back at me.

"You chose treat. That's good. Most people choose trick."

Then he walked away, disappearing into the dark between the streetlights.

I closed the door and locked it, hands shaking. Something about him felt *wrong*—not threatening exactly, but wrong in a way I can't explain.

Twenty minutes later, I found a polaroid on my doorstep. I don't know how it got there. I've been watching the door the whole time.

It's a photo of my house, taken from the street. Tonight. You can see my jack-o'-lanterns on the porch, still lit.

I'm looking at it right now and I don't understand how he took it, developed it, and left it on my porch in twenty minutes. Polaroids take time to develop. And I would have seen him through the window.

But that's not the worst part.



**UPDATE (8:47 PM)**: Another photo just appeared. I'm not opening the door anymore. I'm watching through the window and NO ONE is coming to my porch, but photos keep showing up.

This one is taken from my backyard. Through my kitchen window. I can see myself in it, sitting at my table, looking at the first photo.

That means he was in my yard while I was sitting here. That means he's circling my house.



**UPDATE (9:03 PM)**: Four more photos in the last fifteen minutes. I'm not going outside to get them anymore, but I can see them piling up on my doorstep through the window.

My hands won't stop shaking.

I called the police. They said they'd send someone when they could, but it's Halloween and they're swamped with calls.



**UPDATE (9:31 PM)**: The photos stopped coming. I thought maybe he left. I was starting to breathe again.

Then I saw it.

There's a photo pressed against my living room window from the outside. He's standing RIGHT THERE, holding it up for me to see.

It's a picture of me as a child. Maybe seven years old. I'm dressed as a pirate, opening my front door on Halloween night. And standing on the porch is a boy in a vampire costume, holding out a pillowcase.

I remember this. Oh god, I remember.

I was handing out candy with my mom. This kid came to the door—he was too old, maybe thirteen or fourteen. I was at that age where I thought being mean was funny.

When he held out his bag, I didn't give him candy. I said, "Trick," and slammed the door in his face.

My mom was furious, commanded me to apologize, but when she opened the door he was already walking away. He turned back and his face was so empty, so hollow.

"You chose trick," he said. "That's okay. I'm patient."

We moved away the next year. I forgot about it.

That was thirty-five years ago.

He's been waiting thirty-five years.



**UPDATE (9:58 PM)**: He's not at the window anymore. I don't know where he went.

The pile of photos on my porch has grown. There must be fifty of them now. I can see them from here, and they're all of me. Me as a teenager. Me in college. Me at my wedding. Me moving into this house.

He's been watching me my entire life.

I tried to leave through the back door but there are photos there too. Hundreds of them, covering my back porch, each one a moment from my life I don't remember being photographed.



**UPDATE (10:23 PM)**: I finally looked at one of the photos pressed against my window.

It's of me, right now, sitting on my couch, typing this post. It was taken from inside my house. From the hallway behind me.

I'm alone in this house. I checked every room. Every closet. Every space large enough for a person to hide.

But someone took this photo from inside my house.

I'm too scared to turn around right now.



**UPDATE (10:45 PM)**: I turned around. No one was there.

But there's a polaroid camera sitting on my hallway floor. It wasn't there before.

Next to it is a pillowcase.

An empty pillowcase.



**UPDATE (11:11 PM)**: I don't know how to explain this. I don't expect you to believe me.

I looked in the mirror a few minutes ago and my eyes looked different. Watery. Bloodshot.

And I can't stop thinking about the houses down the street. The ones with their porch lights still on. The ones still handing out candy.

I found myself walking toward my front door. I was holding the pillowcase. I don't remember picking it up.

There's a house three doors down. I can see a family inside through the window. They have a son, maybe seven years old. He's dressed as a pirate.

I'm so hungry.

Not for candy.

For the trick.



**FINAL UPDATE (11:47 PM)**: I understand now. The boy I slammed the door on thirty-five years ago—he's not haunting me.

He passed it to me. Like a disease. Its like a curse that finds a new host.

I watched as my legs walked myself to that house. I rang the doorbell. The little boy answered, his parents behind him, smiling.

"Trick or treat," I heard myself say.

He looked at me—no costume, just a grown man with a pillowcase—and he laughed. A mean little laugh.

"Trick," he said, and slammed the door in my face.

His parents scolded him. They opened the door to apologize.

But I was already walking away.

I turned back and looked at him with eyes I didn't recognize anymore.

"You chose trick," I said. "That's okay. I'm patient."

I'm in my car now, driving away from my house. I don't know where I'm going. Somewhere far.

But I know I'll be back in thirty-five years.

And I know whose door I'll knock on.

If a grown man ever comes to your door with a pillowcase, don’t laugh.

Just give him candy.
