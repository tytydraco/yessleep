It was 12:07 AM.  
The rain had finally stopped, but the air still felt damp and heavy, clinging to the walls like something that refused to leave. There was a strange smell in the room, not rot exactly, but the kind of cold, wet stillness that settles over places where something terrible once happened.

Mohit sat upright on his bed, staring at his phone lying face down on the table.  
The screen was dark.  
Too dark.

Then it rang.

trrr… trrr…

Mohit flinched.

Unknown Number.

He frowned and rejected the call, telling himself it was just another late night spam call. His heart was beating faster than it should have, but he ignored it.

The phone rang again.

This time, a name flashed on the screen.

AANCHAL.

Mohit’s hands started shaking.

“No… this isn’t possible,” he whispered.

Aanchal had been dead for three months.

He remembered that night too clearly. The storm. The empty road. Her seventeen missed calls lighting up his phone while it stayed on silent. He had been angry, tired, distracted. He told himself he would call her back in the morning.

There was no morning for her.

With trembling fingers, Mohit answered the call.

At first, there was nothing.  
Just breathing.

Slow.  
Cold.  
Too close.

It sounded like someone standing right beside the phone, breathing into it, but not quite human. As if the air itself was being dragged in and pushed out from somewhere deep underground.

Then a voice spoke.

“Mohit… you left me alone in the dark.”

His chest tightened. His mouth went dry.

“You’re dead,” he said, forcing the words out. “I saw your body. I went to your funeral.”

A soft laugh came from the other end.

“I didn’t die,” the voice replied.  
“I was never allowed to finish dying.”

The room light flickered once.

Then it went off.

The only light now came from the phone screen, casting long, warped shadows on the walls. The mirror across the room trembled slightly, as if someone had brushed past it.

Mohit turned around.

There was no one there.

“I’m standing behind you,” the voice said calmly.  
“You just can’t see me yet. Because you’re still alive.”

Something cold brushed against the back of Mohit’s neck. Not a hand. Not a touch. A breath.

He froze.

Suddenly, the phone vibrated violently in his hand. The screen changed on its own.

A video call had started.

Aanchal’s face appeared.

Her skin looked stretched, pale, wrong. Her eyes were completely black, no white visible at all. She stared straight into the camera, unblinking.

Her mouth began to open slowly.  
Too slowly.  
Too wide.

The corners of her jaw cracked as it stretched beyond what was human, until bone became visible.

“You didn’t hear me that night,” she said.  
“You didn’t hear me crying.”

From the corner of the room came a sound.

Chap.  
Chap.

Wet footsteps.

They were coming closer.

“You turned your phone to silent,” her voice continued, now echoing both from the phone and from inside the room.  
“So I screamed alone.”

Mohit tried to move.  
His legs would not respond.

“I kept calling,” she whispered.  
“While the rain filled my lungs.”

The mirror suddenly cleared.

Mohit’s reflection was gone.

In its place was Aanchal, smiling softly.

And behind her reflection stood Mohit himself, his eyes empty, his mouth open in a silent scream, already lifeless.

The next morning, the people in the building complained about a phone ringing all night. No one had slept.

When the door to Mohit’s room was finally forced open, a wave of cold air rushed out.

There was only one body inside.

Mohit lay on the bed, eyes wide open, frozen in terror. His fingers were clenched tightly around his phone, so stiff they had to be pried apart.

The screen was still on.

Outgoing Call  
Aanchal  
12:07 AM

The call timer was still running.

No one could explain how the battery hadn’t died.

As a police officer placed the phone on the table, it rang again.

Incoming Call  
AANCHAL

The officer answered it by mistake.

At first, there was only breathing.

Then a soft voice whispered,

“He finally listened.”

The call disconnected.

That night, at exactly 12:07 AM, every phone in the building rang once.

Only once.

And since then, Aanchal’s number no longer exists.

But sometimes, when someone leaves their phone on silent and ignores the calls of someone they love,  
their screen lights up in the dark.

With an outgoing call they don’t remember making.
