*Part 1 - Current*

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q378fv/welcome_to_2026_weve_already_done_this_thirtysix/)

I slowly opened my eyes, unwilling to face the day to come. The first rays of sunlight dared to shine through the window, gently lighting up my messy bedroom. If not for the implications of starting a new year yet again, it would have been a comforting sight, but with the knowledge of what was to come, I dreaded every minute of the year 2026.

A knock on the door caught my attention. It was something I had been expecting, but it still shook me awake. Olivia would be waiting outside, and though we had shared a good moment the day before that I had fooled myself into believing would change things, as I woke up to another morning, I immediately realized that it had all been for naught.

She kept hammering on the door, calling my name, demanding to be let in. She had never been good at respecting personal boundaries, but I had always found it endearing. But on a day like this, I wanted nothing more than to be left alone.

“Marcus, open the door!” she yelled, “I know you’re in there.”

I pulled my bathrobe out from under the bed, still not sure how long it had been lingering under there since the last time I wore it. Electing not to freshen up, I went to the front door, looking like a mess, hungover, if not slightly intoxicated still. I opened the door, and as I had known before she even said a single word, Olivia was waiting.

“What the hell, dude?” were the first words she spoke directly to me that year, “you bailed on me last night.”

She wasn’t looking too fresh herself, but better for wear than I was.

“I’m sorry, I went a bit too far last night. Drinks kept coming and I didn’t stop. I barely remember getting myself home last night,” I explained truthfully, knowing those were the words that would most quickly deescalate an upcoming argument—one I’d had with her over a dozen times already. Though it felt sightly manipulative, I didn’t feel like it would matter in the long run, not after what happened last night.

“Yeah, you were pretty drunk,” she responded, even letting a slight smile crack, caught off guard by my open response, “but you weren’t even there for the countdown.”

“I know,” I responded, “but I promise I’ll be there for the next one.”

“Yeah, in like a year.”

“Three-hundred-and-sixty-four days and fourteen hours, actually,” I responded, knowing the joke would change the mood.

She chuckled. “Anyway, I just wanted to check up on you to see if you survived the night. You left your phone at the party. I needed to know that you were still alive,” she said, adding on a final insult to avoid getting too emotional with me, “you look like shit.”

“Shut up, I look great,” I responded.

She laughed again, simultaneously rolling her eyes.

“Alright, whatever you say. I’ll leave you to hibernate till spring, looks like you’re going to need it. Just wanted to make sure you were okay.”

“I’ll be fine,” I lied, “thank you.”

She patted me on my shoulder and left. I returned to my bed, knowing better than to step outside on the first of January, fully aware that it would bring me nothing but misery if I attempted to start anything in the new year. My best course of action, as it always had been, was to remain inside, gather energy, and then get to work figuring out what the hell happened to the world at the turn of the year.

For the thirty-seventh time, I had woken up to the first of January 2026, aware that in less than six months, it would all start over again. But for everyone to understand the nightmare we’re about to suffer through, I need to explain what happened throughout last thirty-six iterations.

\*\*\*

I couldn’t explain why this course had been bestowed upon me, nor what I was supposed to do with it. The year 2026 had been running on repeat, ending on the seventeenth of May, before resetting to the first of January.

That didn’t mean I could do whatever I wanted without suffering the consequences, because the year would not just progress normally until it reset, instead each passing day would provide new horrors, tearing the world apart until nothing remained. What would be barely noticeable abnormalities at first, would quickly escalate to horrific amalgamations of broken world fragments.

\*\*\*

*The first iteration:*

I woke up the hammering on my front door. Shooting up from my drunken haze, I quickly pulled up a sweater from the floor alongside a pair of sweatpants that had been laying around for longer than I cared to admit.

Rushing downstairs, I failed to notice the partially dried puke-stain on the right shoulder. A faint memory of myself lying on the bathroom floor at the New Year’s Eve party returned, but it was too late to change. I could hear Olivia calling my name from outside, demanding to be let in.

“Marcus, open the door!” she yelled, “I know you’re in there.”

I opened the door to find Olivia with a pissed off, hungover expression her face.

“What the hell, dude?” were the first words she spoke directly to me that year, “you bailed on me last night.”

“I—I don’t— I—” I stuttered, not yet ready for human confrontation that early in the year.

“You really screwed up last night. Why did you drink that much?”

“I don’t know, I just—”

Unable to adequately respond, Olivia got increasingly agitated, a mixture of anger and trace alcohol lingering within her body.

“You should have been there,” she said, not elaborating any further.

“I’m sorry,” was all I could manage to get out.

“Yeah, well…” she trailed off, “you know what, it doesn’t matter. I just wanted to make sure you weren’t dead. I would have called, but you left your phone at the party.”

She handed me my cellphone. It had a cracked screen with crumbs and sticky spots covering it. I recalled that I had dropped it in a puddle of beer or wine at the party, forgetting that it had even left my hand the moment it fell.

“Olivia—” I began before she cut me off.

“Just get some rest. We’ll talk later when you’re don’t look so much like shit.”

With that final remark, she left. I felt bile rise with the sudden urge to puke. I barely made it to the bathroom before projectile vomiting into the bowl. All I felt was the stinging feeling of regret and shame for what had happened the night prior. Though I could only piece together fragments of memories, I knew that I had desired something other than getting absolutely wasted.

Feeling like a hopeless mess, I decided to spend the day in bed, recovering. In the morning, I planned to drive by and visit Olivia to properly apologize, hoping there was still something left between us to salvage.

The first of January quickly came and went, and as I awoke the following day, I still felt the sting of a hangover holding tightly onto my body. Nevertheless, I was fit enough to visit Olivia. I gave her a quick call, asking to come over, to which she responded with hesitant agreement.

Still not completely recovered, I still felt fit enough to drive a car. It would only be a ten-minute drive—one I could possibly achieve blind folded, having done it a thousand times before. I downed a half-emptied bottle of an open energy drink and went on my way.

Shortly after, I came up onto her street, ready to halt at a stop sign. A car followed behind me, halting as I came to a full stop. I sat there for less than a full second before the person behind me honked to get me moving. I waved it off as an impatient driver but quickly realized that the anticipated stop-sign no longer stood at the junction, and with clear roads, I could have easily kept going. Though I felt slightly embarrassed, there were more pressing matters to attend to.

Arriving at Olivias place, I noticed that small decorations and custom street signs had been removed, leaving the street just slightly empty. It was an odd contrast to the welcoming sight I had witnessed a thousand times before, but other than slightly putting me on edge, there didn’t seem to be more to it.

I knocked on Olivia’s front door. She opened but didn’t seem too amused by my presence.

“Hey,” I said, a half-assed greeting.

“Hey, Marcus,” she said with little enthusiasm in her voice, “what do you want.”

“I just wanted to properly apologize for what happened on New Year’s Eve.”

She avoided eye contact, giving a brief response.

“It’s fine. I just overreacted a bit. That’s all.”

“Still, I should have been there.”

“It’s not a big deal, really,” she insisted

“You sure, I just feel like—” I began before Olivia cut me off.

“Marcus, we’ve been friends for a long time. Let’s just leave it at that and keep going as normal.”

Her words stung, even though they shouldn’t have. We had been friends for years, but a part of me had wanted more, and I thought she did too. I thought that New Year’s Eve of 2025 might change the dynamic of our relationship. It was partially the reason why I’d had more to drink, to gather courage to kiss her as the clock struck midnight, but I’d taken it too far.

“Yeah…” I responded, too much of a coward to clarify.

“Look, I have a lot to do today. I don’t really have time for—”

“It’s fine,” I said, and we both left it at that.

Disappointed, I drove back home, again put off by the empty neighborhood. As long as I had known Oliva, I had frequently visited her home, and I knew her neighbors well enough to know that they took a lot of pride in their street’s appearance. Even though the Christmas decorations had long since vanished as was appropriate, their year-around decorations had also been taken down.

But the oddity of the missing decorations stung little compared to Olivia’s half rejection. Returning home, I could feel little but regret for my actions at the end of the previous year, feeling like I had screwed up the only opportunity I would ever have to express my true feelings.

\*\*\*

Olivia didn’t speak much to me for the next passing days. The holidays had ended, and work would begin once again. Between college classes, I had little time to work but I had managed to find a part time job flipping patties at a local restaurant called Quake’s Burgers. I returned on the fourth of January, trying to keep my mind off the potential love I had lost.

No sooner had I entered the restaurant than I realized that something was off. The Christmas decorations had all but vanished, which was to be expected, but the custom map of our town and the empty bottles of various Whiskies that lined the top shelf had been removed as well. I immediately brought this to the attention of the shop owner, who seemed oblivious to the fact until I directly pointed it out. He just jotted it down to the cleaning crew having accidentally removed the wrong decorations, and claimed he’d take care of it. But despite his promises the inexplicably missing decorations would fail to reappear in the coming weeks.

As the days passed, I would notice more and more minor changes to our local town. At first just decorations, flags, pictures, furniture, and road signs would go missing, but as the first two weeks of January passed, things would quickly escalate.

On Wednesday the Fifteenth of January, the house next to my apartment block vanished. It was an ancient construction serving as the home of an elderly lady who had spent her entire life within the same house. During that time a lot had changed, but even at the ripe old age of ninety she had refused to move to more modern quarters. Now, as if she and her home had never existed, the lot had been left empty, barren, dry ground covering its premise.

Having just exited to leave for work, I froze in place before the bizarre sight. For a moment I wondered whether or not I should call the authorities, but I wasn’t what emergency I should even cite them. The rest of the passing pedestrians seemed to ignore the sight, but most of them wouldn’t even have known that the building ever existed.

As a panicked last resort, I tried to alert my neighbors, but the ones who even bothered to open the door seemed to jot it down to construction work, as if they had erased a piece of history overnight.

Frustrated, but unable to do anything to change the situation, I accepted the empty lot as a new part of our neighborhood. The elderly lady who’d lived there never returned, so I couldn’t ask the house’s only resident what had actually happened. It was odd, but I didn’t have enough information to start asking the right questions.

And so, the week would continue, small buildings and shops would vanish from their streets. Few would think to question the occurrences, and since the inhabitants of the buildings weren’t there to explain themselves, there was little information for anyone to work with.

Then the end of January rolled around, and the strange occurrences could no longer be ignored, even by the local government. By the thirtieth of January, our town’s primary school ceased to exist without warning in the early morning hours before any students arrived. Those already at the school, cleaning personnel and teachers getting an early start, were all erased with the building, prompting a manhunt that ended when no trace of any of the missing persons could be found.

I was bound to set off for college around the same time, only to realize that half the teachers and professors had vanished off the face of the Earth. Like with the rest, it was as if they never existed. Classes were naturally cancelled, and I was left behind to keep working as the government initiated hopeless attempts at figuring out what exactly had gone awry.

As the disappearance escalated, Olivia reached out to me for one final time. We’d only kept in contact via messages since the beginning of the year, but as tensions around the country rose, she had called to ask how I was holding up. I had decided to give her some space until things between us calmed down, which was the reason why I hadn’t contacted her first. Still, I was ecstatic to hear her voice.

“I heard about your college,” she said.

“Yeah, it’s fucking insane, isn’t it?”

“What do you think is going on?” she asked.

“I wish I knew.”

“Do you think people are being kidnapped for, like, government experiments?”

“Wouldn’t explain the disappearing buildings and stuff,” I explained.

Though she was interested in the mystery, that wasn’t the reason she had called.

“What are you going to do now?” she asked.

“Stay here, work, wait for things to turn back to normal,” I responded, “what about you?”

She hesitated before responding, “I’m going back to Minnesota to stay with my parents until things blow over.”

“You’re leaving?” I asked, shocked by the announcement.

“Things might get worse before they get better. My parents worry,” she said.

“But, what about—” I began.

“College isn’t going to continue for a while. There’s nothing keeping me here.”

I wanted to argue but elected not to disagree.

“So, yeah. That’s what I’m doing.”

“I understand,” I finally responded.

An uncomfortable long silence hung in the air, neither of us speaking for what felt like an eternity. I wanted to tell her how scared I was, that I didn’t understand why the world was falling apart, but I held my tongue, worried to open up.

“Marcus,” Olivia began.

“Yeah?” I asked.

“I wish things had been different—between us, I mean.”

“Couldn’t they be?” I asked.

“I don’t know,” she said, “listen, my parents will be here any minute to pick me up. I don’t know when I’ll be back. Can we talk when things calm down?”

“Of course.”

“Take care of yourself.”

She ended the conversation there before things got too emotional, but it felt good to hear her voice one final time, especially in with the context of what was to come.

A week after Olivia’s departure back to Minnesota, in the beginning of February 2026, her hometown would be erased off the face of the Earth, taking every single person with it, including Olivia. What remained was no longer just a barren field, but a hole in the ground ending in an infinite void beneath it. Governments worldwide joined to understand the erasure of a town, but their initial efforts proved fruitless as parts of their task force would begin to vanish during the investigation.

As a result, in the middle of February, state borders were closed, quickly followed by country borders. Curfews were initiated, and most workers were put on hold until the circumstances improved, which they wouldn’t at least for the duration of February.

I lost my job at Quake’s Burgers and was locked inside my apartment most of the day, unable to leave but for the purpose of getting my daily rations. I tried to keep up to date with the research of the Minnesota Void, but with services shutting down bit by bit, even the internet started to become unreliable. I could get two hours of service at most per day, with enough data to contact what little family I had to let them make sure I was alright.

Day by day, more of the world started to disappear. The military enforced our curfew, resorting to bringing us our daily supplies in a futile effort at controlling as many factors as possible while a task force attempted to explain the anomalies. But their fruitless efforts halted as more of the world began to vanish, leaving behind what would come to be known as “Memory Voids,” due to an intensive sense of déjà vu triggered within those who neared the holes appearing in the Earth.

Things were dire, but as the month of March arrived, I realized that the deterioration of the world was just getting started, and with thirty-six iterations left to go, I’d experience terror beyond anything I’d [known before.](https://www.facebook.com/richard.saxon.author)
