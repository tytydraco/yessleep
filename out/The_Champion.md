It started as an innocent ritual, a quirky habit meant to pass the time. But habits, like shadows, can sometimes grow into something darker.

Max had always been a creature of routine. Every night after dinner, he would pour a handful of M&Ms into a small wooden bowl and begin his game. He called it "The Gauntlet." Two candies would face off between his thumb and forefinger, the weaker one cracking under the pressure. He’d savor the defeated, leaving the unbroken one to fight another round.

The last M&M standing was always crowned the champion. That champion would be meticulously wrapped in tissue paper, placed in a small box, and sent off to the M&M's headquarters with the same handwritten note:

"Use this M&M for breeding purposes."

At first, it was a joke. He never expected a response. But then, one day, he got one.

A plain white envelope appeared in his mailbox, unmarked except for his name scrawled in blocky, uneven letters. Inside was a single sheet of paper, the message typed in an unsettlingly formal tone:

"Thank you for your contribution. We have received your champion. We look forward to more entries in the future."

Max laughed it off, chalking it up to a bored employee humoring his eccentricity. Yet, as the weeks went by, something about the letter lingered in his mind. There was no signature, no contact information—just that chillingly vague acknowledgment.

The next time he bought M&Ms, he noticed something strange. The candies felt... different. Slightly heavier, the shells smoother. When he resumed his ritual, the first two M&Ms he squeezed didn’t crack. He applied more pressure, his fingers turning white with the effort. Still, neither broke.

Frustrated, he hurled them onto the table, where they rolled to a stop, side by side. As he stared, he swore he saw them twitch—just a tiny, imperceptible movement. He laughed nervously, convincing himself it was a trick of the light. But the unease stayed with him.

Over the next few nights, the M&Ms grew even stranger. They no longer broke under pressure. Instead, they seemed to push back, resisting his fingers. One night, as he held two between his thumb and forefinger, he felt a sharp pain—a tiny, piercing jab. He yelped, dropping the candies. Blood welled from a pinpoint cut on his finger.

Inspecting the fallen M&Ms, he saw nothing unusual at first. But when he leaned closer, he noticed faint, hairline cracks spidering across their surfaces. From within the cracks, something glimmered—a metallic sheen, like tiny, sharp teeth.

The final straw came when he received another envelope. This time, it wasn’t typed. The note was scrawled in an erratic, almost frantic hand:

"Stop. They’re learning."

Max stared at the note, his heart pounding. He tore open the pantry door, dumping the remaining M&Ms onto the counter. They lay there, motionless, innocuous in their bright candy shells. He grabbed a hammer from the garage and smashed one with all his might. The shell cracked, revealing not chocolate but a writhing, black mass that oozed and pulsed like a living thing.

Panicked, Max swept the candies into a bag and drove to the nearest dumpster, tossing them in. But even as he drove home, he couldn’t shake the feeling that he was being watched. That night, he dreamed of tiny, skittering shapes with hard shells and sharp teeth, crawling out of the dumpster and making their way back to him.

When he woke, his wooden bowl was back on the counter, filled to the brim with M&Ms.
