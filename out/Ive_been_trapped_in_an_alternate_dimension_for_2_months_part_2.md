# part 2

Hey, guess what? I survived another day to add to the first post. While I waited, I decided to loot the house next to the one I'm in currently, and I somehow lived. Guess my terrifying, monstrous creature neighbors were sleeping in? Anyway, I got a few useful things, lots of chips (this is like the real world, as in buildings are still here as well as whatever is in one, for example a TV would be here, just haven't found a good way to power one, I guess)

Any who, have part 2. ^(Hey, that rhymes!)

# -----

I turned on the cobblestone floor, feeling sleepy as my eyes opened from the light casting out of the hole in the cave entrance.

How long was I out? Pretty bad fucking dream, must've been a long one. I looked around my surroundings, expecting my bedroom and a bed under me..

Ugh. Not just a dream.

I, in my half-awake state, began to try to recall the past events. Remembering what happened without much effort, I opened my eyes wide, still shitting bricks from yesterday, or whatever creatures of disgusting forms call the light returning. I look around the cave. Oh yeah, I just remembered. **I'm pretty fucking scared of the dark.** With the fact I am wherever I am (no idea), and also a victim of claustrophobia, I'm pretty sure I'd actually shit out a brick within the span of my lifetime. 3 days, assuming.

(looks like I survived longer, huh.)

I backed up away from the cave's tunnel, until i feel the giant boulder covering most of the cave's what would be an entrance. I jumped forward when I felt the boulder against my shirt, until I realize how stupid I am being. I looked around after realizing my stupidity.

What the fuck is that?

Hm... YESSS

I see a backpack a small bit deeper into the tunnel. I only see the straps, since it's pretty god damn dark in here, but I know those are backpack straps. I waltzed over there, my back against the cave wall so I know nothing's behind me. When I got close enough, I grabbed it and sprinted back to the ray of light coming from the hole, and I crouched down. It was a medium-sized dark green camo backpack. Where... the fuck... did this come from? I'll get to that later.

It's body as shit. Dried blood splats across the front and back of it. Ignoring that, I find the zipper and unzip it. It takes a little yanking, but it comes through fairly easily. I decide not to waste any time and I dump it all out.

A large, black flashlight, a red IPhone (I'm using it to type this in the future, hooray!), beef jerky, a somewhat eaten bag of saltines, a little case of triple-A batteries, and a small shovel, one you can hold in one hand.

Fuck... yes. I'm a lucky son of a bitch sometimes.

I celebrate silently, looking for a button or something to turn the flashlight on. I see an in-dent on the side, and I click it. It turns on, illuminating the cave.

The cave further on, a meter or two from where I was sleeping into the cave, I watch the walls fade into a light pink and spots of white.

The cave was also a living thing. Of. Fucking. Course.

I almost scream as I see the rock walls mix and churn and transition into pink flesh and bone until it's completely morphed. moist, light pink tube entrances the size of a human every few feet, from top to bottom. In one of them, I spot someone's leg sticking out of the tube. I swallowed my own vomit, hearing the mushy sounds of the meaty, moving tubes of flesh and bone on the walls digesting its prey. Was this related to the backpack?

how did I miss all of this?

Guess I was way too tired to see this.

I slowly stepped away, looking at the boulder and slowly placing my feet and hands on ledges, climbing up the boulder and wall beside it with the backpack. Just as I escape, I hear an alien-like noise and then the hole where I just went out from filled with flesh and bone. and instantly, I feel a tube-like thing attach itself to my face. It tries to yank me inside as I scream and panic. At the end of the tube, maybe 3 feet away, I see a face... It's mine.

The face across me had it's eyes closed, but it looked bludgeoned and beaten relentlessly for an entire day, it's face looking swollen around the eyes and "lips". A wet sound began to emerge as I felt myself being sucked into the suction tube made of flesh. Thinking quickly and without seeing anything outside, I take off the backpack, opening it as the tube sucked me further in, reaching my chest.

The face across becomes closer and began to resemble me even more the closer I was to my end. It was now 2 feet away. Unintelligible voices rang from every directing as I used my other senses to open the backpack, scrambling through until I felt the small shovel. I grabbed it quickly and tossed the backpack, yelling profanities at the face that was morphing into mine. I stabbed the outside of the meaty body of flesh and bone. Whatever I did clearly had an effect on it. The eyes of the face across was a few inches away.

It's eyelids bursted wide open, revealing nothing behind them except a black, gooey brain and the skull. It opened its mouth, screaming like a maniac, as if It was in intense pain. It definitely wasn't a human scream though.

It spat me out, causing me to tumble down the boulder and gash my knees. I grabbed the backpack as I fell to the ground on my back.

My shirt had black goo across it and the creature retreated back into the cave. Not thinking about the giant gashes against my knees, I pant heavily, traumatized by what just happened. I limped away from the boulder, never wanting to return again. I tried to remember the way to the stairs, because I think I can get out of the forest. Nevermind, I have a better idea; go up the mountain.

You see, the cave, being a cave, led inside a mountain. the cave entrance was slightly angled (cuz it's a mountain) which is why the boulder could fit relatively well in front of it. so i get away from the boulder and then climb the mountain, avoiding anything relating to medium sized holes (reminded me too much of a cave). After a well-spent half-hour of climbing, i reach to top, towering over the forest.

I can see a large town a bit away through some light forestry.

since I slept for a really long time, I woke up at around 7:00 (checked the I-Phone when I got it.

I found an indent in the mountain, grabbing sticks and making a miniature hut just for the night, which took about, like, 3 hours.

Should I remain in the forest? or do I go to the town?

both options are dangerous, but the town most likely has more monsters. They are definitely not going to to as dangerous as the ones in the forest, so should I go quantity over quality or go stay in the forest, where there's probably less creatures, but DEFINITELY more powerful?

Oh yeah, I forgot how exhausted I am.

I'ma go curl up under the sticks and I'll try to see if I can figure out what to do in the morning, since up here is way safer since there's no trees, just flat mountain terrain.

I hope my mom misses me :)
