Let me explain. I live in a house with a long sliding glass door which we keep shut with a long woden stick. It's perfectly safe I always thought. I remember closing it and putting up the rod last night. I'm about 50/50 on if any of this was real. I swear to god it was so bizarre. 

I thought I woke up in the middle of the night to piss and I heard really loud knocking and pounding and it felt like it was coming from behind the wall, maybe on the other side of the house. It was like if a washing mashine had been overloaded with weighted blankets bouncing around. But it sounded close like it was inside the house? Boom boom boom. It would have been like 2:45 am. 

I went to go check it out because it sounded weird. At the time I wasn't really scared because I didn't know what was happening. I was turning a corner in the living room and the wooden stick wasn't holding the door shut anymore so something could have entered in hypothetically. That was weird. But anyway it was pitch black in the living room. Normally there are large windows that let a little bit of light in, even during the night. It's the street light coming in through the window. But I didn't see any street light at this time, it was as if there were boxes stacked up in front of the windows. Or something to cover the windows. Absolutely no light in there except for the reflection of the light in the kitchen which is where I was standing. 

And I saw a strange alien like head, it was gray and it had a beak as if it were some kind of ostrich. And it actually was an ostrich, at least the top half of it. It was wearing lipstick on its beak, and it had fishnet stockings on its feminine legs. And then between those legs was a feminine pussy. I think that the ostrich may have had sex with me in the hallway between the kitchen and living room. 
I felt its beak bite my ear lobe and I was rubbing the ostrich all over, or maybe the ostrich was rubbing me all over. 

When I turned on the lights, the ostrich disappeared and Norm Macdonald was in the room sitting in a chair next to a lamp. He dryly asked me if I had just done the deed with an ostrich. I said no because I was embarrassed. But then Norm said that he had been dead for over a year now, and then I felt sad because I remembered that it was true. You know the more I describe this the more it sounds like it never happened, but when I woke up I could see that Norm Macdonald had left a note on the chair that he was sitting in. It said "hey hope you had a good time with the ostrich alien thing" - Norm
