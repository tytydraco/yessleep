Caller One: "Yeah, I'm in the parking garage inside the Argent Apartment Building?"

Caller One: "Some absolute psychopath must've smashed up my car. I need like, the cops or something, for their report so I can get an insurance claim or whatever."

Dispatcher: "Police have been dispatched to your area, they shouldn't be long, can you describe in greater detail the condition of your car, and what car the police should be looking for?"

Caller One: "It's a black Nissan Armada, 2022 edition. Bought it like four days ago."

Caller One: "This is so messed up, I'm taking a closer look, and someone *definitely* took a bat to my car. I didn't even do shit to deserve this..."

Caller One: "Darren Haddox." *(caller correctly identifies himself)*

Dispatcher: "Do you know who the police should be looking for that did this to your car?"

Darren Haddox: "No clue, I was \[going\] (emphasized) to go out to a bar with some buddies, and I come down from my apartment building, and see this shit show of a car staring back at me!"

Dispatcher: "Are there any cameras in the area that police might be able to access?"

Darren Haddox: "Nah, the only one here has been broken for... a while. I think."

Darren Haddox: *(whispered)* "Looks like there's some homeless guy in the garage, I might go ask him if he saw anything."

Dispatcher: "Sir, it might be smarter to just wait by your car for police to arrive."

Darren Haddox: *(steps heard, voice echoey)* "Hey! Mate, you by chance see the person who fucked up my car?" (caller ignores advice from dispatcher)

Darren Haddox: *(brief pause, no one speaks)* "Aye. I'm talkin' to you. Don't ignore me, asshole."

Dispatcher: "Police are eight minutes out, Darren you should seriously just wait inside your car until responders arrive."

Darren Haddox: "Hell no! This guy clearly knows somethin', but won't speak up!"

Darren Haddox: "This guyâ€™s some psycho druggie, he just stood up and is staring right at me."

Unknown: *(heard in background)* "Druggie? Bold coming from you."

Dispatcher: "Darren, leave the man alone and walk back to your car. Police are now seven minutes out."

Darren Haddox: "You're right, I'm walking back to my car before I beat the shit out of this asshole." (shuffling heard in background, metal noise heard hitting the ground)

Unknown: (heard in background) "Hey, Darren."

Darren Haddox: "I told you to \[fuck off\] (yelled) asshole!"

Dispatcher: "Darren? Darren, are you there? Can you hear me?"

(Final metal noise is heard in background of the call)

**Call One - Disconnected - Ended at: 10:33 PM**

*Officers McKinley and Brown arrived at the scene at 10:41 PM, two minutes after they were supposed to arrive. Upon entering the scene, Darren Haddox was not found anywhere in the parking garage, as well as the described "homeless witness." Darren Haddox's car was found at the scene, smashed by a metal baseball bat. Pieces of a phone were found a few feet away from the car, but not enough to immediately conclude it was from the one used to make the call. Seeing there was no one to talk to about the vandalism, Officers McKinley, and Brown six minutes after arriving at the scene got another call about a nearby home burglary in progress and decided it would be better use of their time to respond there. They arrived at that scene at around 10:49 PM.*

A twenty-year-old college student placed a call approximately three minutes before McKinley and Brown arrived at the scene, calling to report a, "suspicious drunk man" outside their apartment rooms door. The apartment in question was the Argent Apartment Complex.

The transcript of that call is located below.
