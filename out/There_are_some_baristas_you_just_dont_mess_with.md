Fresh out of business school, I got a job working in corporate for a chain of coffee shops operating in the Northwest. I should have quit as soon as I realized that my boss, Tommy, was the owner’s nephew, but it was my first real corporate job, and I didn’t have any backup options.

“What’s your take on unions?” asked Tommy as I walked into his office for the first time.

“Great for workers, bad for business,” I said, quoting one of my professors.

“I knew I liked you,” said Tommy. “Coffee?”

“I actually don’t drink coffee,” I said, and Tommy raised his eyebrows.

“Anyway, let’s talk about your first assignment. As you know, your first year is all rotations. We’re gonna make sure you’re really out there in the jungle, you know? First assignment is down in Grants Pass. Real shitshow. We’ve lost two managers to suicide in the last year.”

“Jesus,” I said. “How are the workers taking it?”

“Are you kidding me? They’re ecstatic. Those guys were assholes, and believe me, it takes one to know one. But here’s the thing. The workers are all small-town people, super tight, and now they’re talking union. You seem like a nice guy. Same age as a lot of the baristas. Gentle touch. We want you to get in there and diffuse things. Subtly.”

“Can do,” I said, fighting the urge to sprint out of his office.

I walked into the Grants Pass location to find a single old man with a massive beard working the counter while a girl my age in full uniform sat at one of the tables highlighting passages in an anatomy book.

“What can I get you, Chief?” asked the old man, whose name tag read “Norman.”

“Tea,” I said.

Whistling some old John Denver song, the old man gestured to a wall of teabag options.

“Jasmine Green.”

“Great choice, my man,” said Norman. “Nectar of the Ming Emperors. There was a time when this little bag might cost you a day’s wages.” He dropped it in a cup and ran the hot water.

“Why isn’t she working?” I asked, nodding at the girl.

“Oh, you mean Laila over there? Slow day. She’s got a final coming up next week. Nursing school.”

I cleared my throat.

“Isn’t it corporate policy that you should be directing me to the honey and lemon?”

He wagged his finger at me and smiled.

“Now I get it. You’re the new boss man, right?” He fixed his eyes on me for a second, and suddenly all the kindness went out of them, like he’d turned out every light in the shop. “Hope it works out better for you than the last couple of fellas.” He looked me up and down. “So tell me this. Are you a man or are you a suit?”

“Both,” I said, but he shook his head.

“At some point, you’re one or the other.”

The next day, I summoned the full staff to arrive first thing in the morning and introduced myself. I spent the rest of the day watching them work, occasionally pulling them aside for one on one conversations. No one wanted to talk unions, about their coworkers, or what had happened with the old bosses.

I called up Tommy, who started by screaming at full volume into the phone.

“Of course, they’re not gonna flip on each other, dumbfuck. I told you that. Didn’t you ever read any of those examples in business school?”

“Case studies?”

“Shut the fuck up. Here’s what you do. Look over the records of *former* employees. Those are the ones that hate everyone. Offer them a gift card for a little dirt. And don’t call me again. I swear to god, if I have to come down there, the first person I fire will be you.”

I went through the list of former employees. Finally, I got to Denise. She agreed to a quick Facetime before I even mentioned the gift card.

Denise was thirty but looked forty-five thanks to a bad haircut and a pack-a-day addiction to Marlboros. I didn’t even have to *ask* before she started shoveling dirt like it was her job.

“That union shit? It’s all Laila. Not even sure why she cares. She’ll be gone as soon as she gets that fancy degree anyway. I assumed she didn’t get fired because she was fucking the old boss, but now he’s dead, and she’s still here. Uppity bitch hosts these parties all the time and invites everyone but me. Well, now I’m spilling her secrets. So what? She has it coming.”

I took notes furiously and added, “What about Norman? What’s his deal?”

“You ever hear of American Ultra? CIA shit? He tells everyone he was in the *other* program. The one they never declassified. Everyone walks on eggshells around him. Not me, though. All I see is a sad old man who couldn’t get a job at Starbucks and landed here instead.”

“Anything else?”

“Yeah. Fix the bathroom. It’s disgusting. Can I go now?”

A few days later it was raining hard, and I was working the register with Norman. Laila came in and didn’t even bother checking in before making a beeline for one of the tables. She plugged in a laptop and started tapping away.

“Unbelievable,” I muttered. “That’s it. She’s done.”

“Not so fast there, Chief,” said Norman. “She’s just doing her thing. Let her be.”

“It’s gross insubordination,” I said.

“We haven’t had a customer since 10 am,” said Norman. “I think we can handle things.”

“Maybe if anyone actually did some work around here, that might change,” I said. Then I picked up one of our signs and marched over to Laila. “You’re gonna get out there and twirl this sign,” I told her. “Get us some god-damned customers.”

She looked out at the pouring rain. The street was dark, with occasional headlights cutting through the gloom.

“You serious?” she asked.

I nodded. “Get up. Now.”

Laila snatched the sign out of my hands, threw on her coat, and headed outside. I turned to see Norman staring hard at me.

“I’m realizing you never learned to make steamed milk,” said Norman, his voice strangely soothing. “Isn’t that why you’re here? To learn the place inside and out.”

“Actually…” I started to say, but even as I spoke the words, I felt myself walking toward the machine.

“Main thing about the steamer is you gotta be careful not to get burned,” said Norman, starting the steam cycle. “This contraption is designed to get that milk boiling in twenty seconds flat. So you don’t. Want. To. Touch. The. Metal.”

As he said the words, I approached the machine. Unwillingly, my right hand reached up toward the metal.

“What’s happening?” I started to ask, and then I was screaming. The fingers of my right hand curled around the steamer’s metal cylinder. The skin blistered and peeled, but I only gripped the steamer harder.

Finally, Norman whispered, “Might want to ice that, chief.” I let go of the machine and ran over to the faucet, running the cold water over my hand.

“Sure looks wet out there,” said Norman gesturing to Laila outside in the rain. “Maybe we should call her back in.”

I nodded weakly.

“I’m going to need to take a few days off,” I told Tommy on the phone later that day, after I’d gotten back from the ER. “I burned my hand pretty bad.”

“You can’t work with a burned hand? Jesus, you’re worse than the baristas. Pop an Oxy and put on your big boy panties.”

“It was a job-related injury,” I started to explain. “Norman was trying to show me how to use the steamer, and–”

“Don’t you dare try to pull any lawyer shit,” said Tommy. “Sounds like *you* fucked up your hand. It’ll heal. This Norman guy is your problem. Got you injured on purpose. Fire his ass. Today.”

“I’m not sure I can,” I said, trying to ignore the throbbing in my hand.

“You really, really don’t want me to come down there,” said Tommy. “I fucking hate Grants Pass.”

That afternoon, I called Norman into my office.

“Have you been thinking about it?” Norman asked. “Whether you’re a man or a suit?”

“You’re fired,” I told him. “Effective immediately. Your last paycheck will be…”

Norman shook his head.

“You’re making a big mistake. I like it here.”

“It’s not up to you.”

He smiled.

“Let’s go outside, boss. It’s a beautiful day. We should get some sunshine.”

Unwillingly, I stood up and started walking for the door. Outside, the four-lane street was busy as people shuttled off to work.

“You ever play Frogger, boss? I must have spent a hundred bucks on that damn thing back in the 80s. Never got too good at it though.”

As he spoke, I took a step off the curb into the street. A car sped by, nearly running over my toes.

“Please,” I said. “Don’t do this.”

“A suit is replaceable,” said Norman. “A cog in the machine. One jumps off a bridge, another comes to backfill his spot. Another grabs a high-voltage fence? No biggie. A third one runs into traffic? Cost of doing business.”

I walked through the first lane of traffic, cars not even bothering to stop. I strolled casually, not even running as I spotted a semi bearing down on me. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t make my legs obey my own will.

“But a man can’t be replaced,” shouted Norman. “His friends and family mourn him every day. Maybe they set a place for him at the table on his birthday, even after he’s gone. A man is not a cog.”

I jumped forward into the next lane as the semi swerved slightly to avoid me.

“So what is it then?” asked Norman.

“I… I…” I stuttered. A motorcyclist almost clipped me at full speed.

“What is it?” shouted Norman again.

“I’m a man,” I said, the words lost in the traffic noise. I was almost in the fourth lane now. Another semi was coming in the opposite direction. “I’m a man,” I shouted. Suddenly I found myself sprinting forward. I leaped forward out of the way, the semi missing me by inches.

I looked back over my shoulder at Norman, who gave me a quick smile and a nod.

“Good choice, boss.”

I was still shaking later that day when I called Tommy to resign.

I didn’t know then that I’d go on to find a new job just a few days later, an entry-level job at a little software company, where a few years later I’d be voted “World’s Nicest Boss” at the company Christmas party.

I also didn’t know that I’d still wake up years later, and see a vision of Norman’s face in the dark, asking me that same old question, and I’d catch myself whispering, “I’m a man. I’m a man. I’m a man.”

All I knew then was that I was leaving.

“I knew you were a pussy the moment you walked into my office,” shouted Tommy over the phone. “You couldn’t even fire a 70-year-old man without pissing your pants.”

“I guess you’re gonna have to come down here and do it yourself,” I said. Then I hung up the phone.

I never saw Tommy [again](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/).
