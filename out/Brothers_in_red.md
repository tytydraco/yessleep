I’m shaking while typing this. I don’t care if this gets buried or deleted or mocked. I just need it out of my head.

If you’re reading this on Christmas Eve, stop. Please. Read it tomorrow.

I was a 911 dispatcher for seven years. I’ve heard people die. I’ve heard children scream. I’ve learned how fear sounds when it finally breaks someone.

None of that prepared me for them.

It started with a call at 3:12 a.m. on December 24th.

No caller ID. No location. Just breathing.

Deep. Wet. Excited.

I asked the standard questions. “911, what’s your emergency?”

A man answered. His voice was warm. Friendly. Smiling.

“He sees them,” the man said.

“Sir, who sees who?”

“The brothers.”

The line went dead.

Thirty seconds later, another call came in. Same blank ID. Same breathing.

This voice was different. Lower. Like gravel being chewed.

“He sees us,” it said.

I felt my stomach drop. “Who is this?”

Laughter. Sharp. Too close to the mic.

“Check the address on the first call,” the voice said. “We’re already there.”

I pulled up the system.

The address populated on its own.

My address.

Before I could react, both lines came back at once.

Two voices. Talking to each other. Not to me.

“You promised we’d be done after tonight,” said the warm one.

“And you promised they’d keep believing,” said the other. “Look at them now.”

I heard something in the background of the call.

My living room.

My grandfather clock.

My dog whining.

I screamed for my supervisor. No one responded. The floor was empty. Every desk abandoned, headsets still humming.

The warm voice sighed. “He’s listening. We should explain.”

The darker one chuckled. “He won’t like it.”

Then the calls merged.

One voice.

Two mouths.

“We were born screaming,” it said. “But they tore us apart.”

The room around me smelled like pine and rot.

“They dressed one of us in joy. Fed him milk and cookies. Let him crawl through homes and touch sleeping children.”

A wet sound. Like a tongue passing over lips.

“They buried the other under churches. Fed him sinners and secrets. Let him crawl through souls.”

My computer screens turned red.

Not error messages.

Just red.

“They made us symbols,” the voice continued. “But symbols rot when no one believes in what they mean.”

I heard footsteps behind me.

Heavy.

Dragging.

Bells rang somewhere close. Not festive. Rusted. Like they’d been underwater for centuries.

“They forgot the cost,” the voice whispered. “So once a year, we come back together.”

I felt breath on my neck. Cold and hot at the same time.

“We trade.”

Hands grabbed my shoulders.

One gentle. One crushing.

“Those who believe too much,” said the warm one, close to my ear.

“And those who don’t believe at all,” said the other, teeth brushing my skin.

I saw them reflected in my dark monitor.

Two men.

Same face.

Same beard.

One red bright as fresh meat.

One red dark as dried blood.

Between them… me.

I woke up on my living room floor at sunrise.

My dog was gone.

So was every mirror in the house.

The walls were scratched with symbols I don’t recognize, but my brain does.

There was a gift under my tree.

No tag.

Inside was a dispatcher headset.

Still warm.

Still breathing.

If you hear bells tonight and feel watched, don’t look outside.

Don’t look under the tree.

And whatever you do—

Don’t stop believing.

Because if you fall between them…

They both get to keep you.
