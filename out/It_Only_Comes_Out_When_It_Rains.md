I’ve debated posting this for years, but things have…changed recently. Something happened this week that I can’t ignore, and maybe someone here will believe me or help me make sense of it. I’ll keep details vague, but I’ll be as honest as I can.

It started when I was eight, right after the biggest storm our town had seen in a decade. The kind of rain that turns streets into rivers and pushes everything unwanted from the surface down into the drains.

I was playing outside. I wasn’t supposed to, but back then, I wasn’t scared of anything. I was bored, holding a small paper boat I’d folded that morning. My older brother had shown me how to make it, just like our dad used to do for him. And then, in an instant, a single gust of wind sent it spinning and dancing away from me, straight into the river of rainwater trickling along the curb.

I chased it for a while. But then, just as quickly as it had started, the storm’s waters pulled my boat down…somewhere I couldn’t follow.

I was just about to turn back when I saw it.

A flash of color in the drain, right where the boat disappeared. A flicker of something bright and wrong against the murky darkness.

“Hello?” I whispered, and immediately regretted it.

A face appeared. There’s no other way to describe it. Not a friendly face or even a face that made sense in the dim light. But there it was, unmistakably human and so out of place.

“I have your boat,” it said, with a grin that seemed to stretch a little too wide.

I didn’t know how to respond. It was like my mind had gone blank, and all I could think about was that boat and how stupid I’d feel if I went home without it. So I stayed there, frozen, as the face talked to me, its voice low and strange.

“Why don’t you reach down here and get it?” it asked.

Now, here’s the thing: I still don’t remember what happened next, not clearly. Maybe my memory has blocked it out, but the next thing I remember was being back home, completely drenched and empty-handed. My mom was yelling at me about being out in the storm, but all I could think about was that face in the drain.

In the years that followed, my friends and I would hear stories about kids disappearing, usually after a storm. The adults didn’t talk about it much, or if they did, they’d always blame “bad luck” or “the river.” But we knew better. We could feel it. The air got heavier, colder, whenever it rained, and sometimes we’d catch glimpses of things that shouldn’t be there—shadows in the puddles, lights flickering at odd hours, laughter that echoed through empty streets.

Years went by, and I moved away, like a lot of people did. I tried to forget about that strange face and the stories that kept surfacing each rainy season. Eventually, I convinced myself it was just my imagination.

But then I came back to town recently for a friend’s funeral. He was one of the few of us who’d stayed, and his death…well, it wasn’t pretty. They found him by the river, and from the way he looked, you’d think he’d seen something awful just before he died.

I met up with a few old friends that night, all of us sharing stories and reminiscing. But there was one thing none of us could talk about out loud—the fact that we all felt something pulling at us again. An itch at the back of our minds, a flicker of something familiar.

That night, on the way back to my motel, I saw it. Just for a second.

A flash of color in a storm drain, a shape half-hidden in the shadows. And then…the grin.

It remembered me.

I’m not going to stay here much longer. I’ll finish up my business and leave before it rains again. But I needed to tell someone, needed someone else to know, in case I don’t make it out this time.

Whatever it is…it only comes out when it rains.
