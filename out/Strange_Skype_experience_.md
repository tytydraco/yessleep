So this probably happened in 2012. Me and a few buddies would always play games together, we had a Skype group with maybe 8 people. So on one night me and my friend were playing Minecraft when we heard the sound of someone joining the Skype call. Expecting it was our other friend Cameron coming to Play with us we greeted him. But got no response back (this was normal, normally his headset wasn't plugged in or his mic was muted) we didn't think much of it, nor did we actually check to see who joined. But after about 5 minutes without a response I tabbed out of the game to check who ACTUALLY joined the call. To my surprise it was an account I didn't recognize. They had no profile picture, and they're name was something like "user47389" I tried greeting them again but got no response. At this point we didn't think anything of it. I mean we had 8 people in our group so we thought it was somebody's friend who got invited to the group. So we just left them be and went on playing for the night till we got off to go to bed. 

A few weeks had gone by and we completely forgot about this. Until one night me and my other 2 friends were playing Minecraft again. We heard someone join the call, this time I went to check who and sure enough it was "user47389" again. We tried greeting them but nothing. Being annoyed at this point I told them if they don't speak or type, I'm going to kick them from the call. But still nothing, so I went to kick them. But to my surprise it wouldn't let me, it was acting as if THEY were the host of the call. A bit weirded out I tried going to their profile to see who exactly this was. But when I tried it simply said "this user doesn't exist" thinking this was some weird glitch we all laughed it off and just ended the whole Skype call and started a new one. 

So about a month or two goes by and we all forget. Until sure enough I'd say around 2am me and my two buddies are playing a game when we hear someone join the call. We all kinda stopped talking and just waited. There was definitely tension in the air as we all assumed who had joined the call. I was the one who went to check and of course there's "user47389" at this point we were all a little spooked. We had asked everyone in our friend group if they knew who this was, but nobody did. I was a little spooked as I messed around with the dark web when I was younger, and was now worried some creep was screwing with me. Out of fear we completely deleted the Skype group and started a new one. We all made our best guesses as to what the hell this was all about. Even thinking this was some sort of Skype quality control to see the quality of peoples calls. But I'm sure we just made ourselves to believe that to ease our minds. 

But after deleting the group this never happened again. So was it some "Skype ghost" a creep screwing with a bunch of kids from the dark web, some creepy quality control or one of our friends pulling of a long and weird prank?
