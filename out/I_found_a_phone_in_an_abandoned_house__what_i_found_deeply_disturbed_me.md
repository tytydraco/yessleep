\*Hello everyone, yesterday me and my friends decided to indulge in our favourite "pass time", trespassing on private property! Usually, its hospitals or out of business Shopping Centres however this time we decided to spice things up and go inside a house we usually stayed out of since it gave of a filthy air that words can't describe. This house looked abysmal, windows boarded up, the wallpaper on the walls were halfway peeled off. Other than that, nothing was out of the ordinary, the usual stuff was there like graffiti, but something was off... something pungent, no dead bodies thankfully.

\*Our usual routine is to go in, look at the graffiti, make a few jokes about the shit that could have gone down for the building to end up like this, go home and forget about it until we get drunk and want to do it again. I don't know why but something compelled me to check out the attic, where I found this crappy phone that has to be at least 3 generations old. As you can assume the phone was out of juice, but I still took it home and bought a charger from a random gas station and here we are.

\*I opened the newly charged phone and just browsed it for a good 15 minutes before checking the notes app where I stumbled upon the only entry. "Intruders are in my house". My first reaction to reading that title is to close the phone and do something else until curiosity got the better of me as it was late at night and reading something like that might end up with me not being able to sleep soundly for a few days... I was right. Here is the "journal" and some research I did after.

*04:00 AM*

*I didn't know what to do, should I try to fight them of with some random knives from the kitchen? Should I go and try to leave out one of the windows. In hindsight the window seems like the best course of action to take in a situation like this however in the moment pride got the better of me, I grabbed my phone  and hurried into the attic, making sure to quietly close the door without making a sound.*

*I've heard the footsteps of 3 people in total, it makes me wonder... how long have they been planning this. This is my 3rd month of living in this house after moving in and it's not like I own anything valuable as the house already came furnished. I will call the police; I'll continue the journal once I'm finished.*

*04:30 AM*

*I tried to get into contact with the police, but I ended the call halfway through when the operator started asking me a bunch of stupid irrelevant questions like, " Whats your name? When did you move into the house?". I understand I'm making a great mistake by not getting the authorities involved however I don't believe those filthy pigs would help me anyways.*

*04:35 AM*

*You know what? F\*ck the police and everything they stand for, it's not my fault my home is being robbed and defiled, I'm sure that if I would call them again, they'd send up a first responder and arrest me not the 3 douchebags ransacking my home.*

*05:00 AM*

*I managed to catch a wink of sleep. The house is dead silent, however after my last entry I heard the second-floor toilet get flushed and the sink being used. What kind of intruder takes a turd in someone's toilet and washes their hands as well. Its almost like they are planning on squatting here for the night ... the bastards. I decided to be brave and slightly open the door to try hear any sort of noise on the second floor, and I got nothing, however I did manage to create one more piece of* [*evidence*](https://i.imgur.com/fsCjoVD.png)*that I was here, couped up in this attic without help or food or water or ANY BASIS FOR LONG TERM SURVIVAL!*

*05:13 AM*

*Again, all things are quiet here. I'm going to go downstairs. I will re-take my home. And I will DEFEND myself and my home under any circumstances. Honestly, I cannot wait, going down there once they are all sleeping and proving to those three that they have made a great mistake in picking this house to rob. Its just not fair. ITS NOT FAIR I HAVE BEEN PUT IN THIS SITUATION! But God dammit I will do everything I can do to stay alive.*

\*That's where the journal ended, it brought up more questions than it did answers for example why didn't he take his phone with him, why did he leave it in the attic. The initial read of the journal isn't disturbing in of itself, but the sentiment creeped up as I started to research the house and any situations documented that could help me uncover the pieces of the story that were lost.

All that came up was a news report and a missing person's report... A news report regarding a home intrusion. A home intrusion that has been happening for months. The report read as follows:

**-Joshua Smith male of 32 years of age, 6.2ft tall, weighing at 87kg has escaped Scovill facility for mental patients on the 2nd of February 2017. This individual is extremely dangerous, please refrain from approaching as he suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and is prone to fits of violence towards those around him when he begins feeling threatened.**

**-Joshua has been last seen squatting in a nearby house around Scovill , when authorities reached the house, it was already ransacked , cupboard doors broken of their hinges , television smashed , all of the works however no hint of Joshua or the family of three that lived there. It has been reported that the Brown family was on holiday during the beginning stages of investigation therefore they did not have the slightest idea someone could be squating in their home. I must reiterate , Joshua and the brown family have not been found.**

**-I plead for those in nearby neighbourhoods to keep one eye open to anyone strange loitering around and if you have any information regarding Joshuas whereabouts please contact us  at \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* As any information can be useful in such investigations.**

I can only imagine the gruesome things that must have happened that night. I want to believe that those three "intruders" are okay and I want to believe that Joshua was found and finally received the help he needs but still... that house. I can't put my finger on it. It was like death itself , the sheer concept of death filled the air with a unmatched viscosity. I'm afraid I have fallen down a rabbit hole in which I cannot get out of and my only option is to share my torment with the world.
