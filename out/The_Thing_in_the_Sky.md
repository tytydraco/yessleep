No one knew how our world was going to end. Some people thought it would be some kind of natural disaster or disease that would wipe us out. Others thought that it would be due to humans themselves.

Most of us didn’t worry about it, and said that it wouldn’t happen in our timeline. But of course, you can’t exactly be sure when you say these kinds of things, because you can never really know.

The apocalypse came to us, sooner than we expected. It started when the entire sky became covered in dense clouds, leaving the Earth in total darkness. It was darker than night. Without the sun, plants wouldn’t grow, and we would begin to freeze. It was terrifying to see how fast our world had turned upside down. But then, hope came to us, in the form of a voice echoing from the sky above, to everyone.

*“Be at peace, my children, for I bring you a chance of a new world. A better world. The world as you know it has come to an end, and as your god, I have come to save the ones who wish to join me in heaven above, united in eternal life.”*

Suddenly, thousands beams of light shot out from the dark and cloudy sky, shining onto the ground below. They glistened in heavenly light, and illuminated our dark world. The first person to step into the light  would be brought upwards in the beam, and into the sky above. I saw it happen, as I myself had been chosen. When a beam appeared in our backyard, my family insisted that I should be the one to go, as I had my whole life in front of me. I cried tears of sadness as I said goodbye to my family, but also cried tears of joy as I stepped into the beam, and began floating upwards. I was going to heaven.

I watched as the world below me become smaller the higher I ascended. Soon I couldn’t see the ground anymore, and I realized that I must have been nearing my final destination.
 
As I got closer to the dark clouds, a terrible smell burnt in my nostrils, one that made me feel like throwing up. I looked around for the source of the smell, but i was surrounded by nothing but air. I looked up to the clouds above me to check, but that’s when I noticed something… off. Now that I was up close, I could see that the clouds didn’t look like clouds. They looked lumpy, and… red. Once I was just a few feet away I could see that they weren’t clouds at all.

They were mounds of pulsating flesh, covering the entirety of the sky.

I screamed in terror and flailed my arms around, trying to go back, but it was too late. The light dragged me through the fleshy ceiling, which absorbed me into its mass. I kicked, punched, and screamed at the meat walls that surrounded me, but to no avail. Slowly, the flesh mold around my began to tighten, and I couldn’t move at all. I began to hyperventilate, gasping for air. But soon, I couldn’t do that either. I began to fuse with the flesh mold that surrounded me, to the point where my individual body was gone. I was left with only my mind.

I could still feel it all. The fear. The pain. The hunger. But not just from myself. From everything, everyone, residing in the mass. I could hear their thoughts, and they could hear mine. While the thing in the sky wasn’t God, it didn’t lie about everything. I had become united with it, for all eternity. I had become one, with the thing in the sky. I went with it as it journeyed to other planets in our galaxies, and spoke through it in unison to the inhabitants below, saying the same things that I was originally promised.

*“Be at peace, my children, for I bring you a chance of a new world. A better world. The world as you know it has come to an end, and as your god, I have come to save the ones who wish to join the heavens above, united in eternal life.”*

This wasn’t heaven, by any means. But over time, I came to accept my fate. It wasn’t like I could do anything about it, anyways. 

However, despite being one with the mass,  I don’t know everything. I still wonder about what happens after the beams of lights had finished taking people, about what happens to the ones left behind. I guess there is one thing that I can say for sure, with absolute certainty.

If this is what the thing in the sky considered heaven, I’d hate to see what it considered hell.
