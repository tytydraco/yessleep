So, I woke up this morning feeling ... weird. A bit off. Not your standard "I need coffee" kind of off, but the kind where every bone in your body whispers, "Somethings pretty messed up here." 

I rolled over, trying not to shatter into a million pieces because, apparently, that's a thing my body does now. And I noticed the ceiling wasn't my ceiling. 

As I creaked in my bed, suddenly strongly motivated to move quite quickly, I crowbarred my eyes fully open and encouraged them to focus. What I saw didn't really make any sense. My ceiling had somehow stretched way beyond the walls, curving upward into this kind of dark nothingness that screamed, "Dave. Mate. You're not supposed to see this."

There was silence. Not the peaceful kind. It was the kind that makes cocaine and booze fueled hollywood film directors feel the need to overuse an idea —the "too quiet" that signals the scary music is about to start and that you definitely shouldn't go down the basement stairs on your own. It pressed on my skull, which, by the way, now felt like it was made of old, crumbly chalk.

None of this was good. I really had to move. Quickly.

I swung my legs out of bed, and instead of meeting  the landlord-approved, paper thin beige carpet, my feet sank into something... soft. I glanced down to see ripples emanating from where I stood, like I'd just stepped into a puddle made of carpet water. And get this—the ripples reflected what appeared to be constellations. On top of everything else, I now had stars in my floor.

Before I could process my new astrophysics-defying flooring, I heard a whisper. At first, it was like an overly chatty friend defying the unwritten rules of the cinema  —a soft "hey" that you try to ignore because the film's pretty good and like, you can talk later...

But it grew more persistent, like your other friend who won't stop texting you memes at 3 AM.

"You asked the question," it said.

I froze. My heart—or whatever was impersonating it—pounded away somewhere that wasn't entirely inside my body. "I didn't ask anything," I managed to say, through the creaky bones of my jaw and a tongue that felt 43% numb.

"No, not here," the voice replied, dripping with the kind of condescension only a disembodied demon entity could muster. "But you will. And once you do, it'll be too late."

Fantastic. Cryptic warnings from disembodied voices. Just what I needed on a Wednesday.

The room snapped - that's only way I can think to describe what happened next. It was like it stretched through me. 

Next thing I know, I'm standing on the edge of a mountain that feels suspiciously American, despite me being a 42-year-old Scotsman who's never  visited an American hill. Don't ask me how I knew; maybe the mountain had a southern drawl.

Down below swirled a vortex of colors that my brain felt shouldn't exist. New hues, new dimensions—like someone threw a rainbow into a blender with a handful of LSD and hit "puree." It was beautiful in the way a tornado is beautiful when it's not aimed at your house. This, however, felt firmly aimed at my  rented semi-detached in Birmingham.

Then the whisper escalated into a full-on voice, wrapped in a low hum that vibrated somewhere deep inside my teeth. 

"Don't ask the question," it warned. "Or you'll see them."

As if on cue, the colors below shifted violently, and I caught movement in my peripheral vision. Silhouettes—massive, sky-filling shapes that defied logic and basic Euclidean geometry. They moved quickly but seemed to stay just out of clear sight, like I'd been unwillingly conscripted into the worst possible game of hide and seek.

At this point, all semblance of self-preservation went out the window. Every fiber of my being screamed not to look, but of course, I did. Because I'm an overweight, bald and Scottish idiot.

The silhouettes were... I can't even describe them properly. Imagine trying to explain a four-dimensional object using finger puppets. They were there and not there, real and unreal, like shadows cast by nothing onto nothing.

That's when it hit me: this wasn't a dream. Not a hallucination. I was stone-cold awake I was firmly and deeply me, and apparently trapped in a reality that had somehow hopped off the rails and cycled off into a dark field.

So here I am, a few hours later, typing this out into Evernote, nursing a bacon and brown sauce sandwich, wearing a thousand-yard stare that could rival any Vietnam war vets. My kitchen, thankfully, is its mundane self. No rippling floors, no demonic floating whispers—just me and the faint hum of the fridge that we've tastefully decorated with the worst fridge magnets we could find.

But I can't shake the feeling that I've been warned. That some question is warming up inside me, desperately trying to be asked. It's like needing to sneeze but infinitely worse.

How on earth am I supposed to avoid asking a question when I don't even know what it is? If I couldn't stop myself from looking at the eldritch silhouettes, what chance do I have here?

I'm not prone to existential crises before my second cup of tea. I'm just Dave—a guy who thought the pinnacle of weirdness was that one party in 2014 we don't talk about. But this... this is on another level.

So, I think I need help. Has anyone out there experienced anything remotely like this? Am I losing my mind? Did I accidentally eat some salem bread? Or is this happening other people too? Is reality peeling back layers it shouldn't?

I'm terrified to ask any more questions, but I need to know... am I alone?
