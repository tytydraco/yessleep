As I said in the title, I can't tell you who I am or what my job is, all I can really say is I'm sort of a men in black sort of person working for a group consisting of multiple world governments and world leaders. A group investigating the strange and abnormal. Talking doubt into witnesses and removing any evidence we find.

I'm going to have to be vague here. I get sent to places we've heard rumours of these things. Once we're there, we secretly search for evidence and witnesses. Remove anything hinting at the truth and talk seeds of doubt into those who saw.

For example, there was this one case. I got called about a group of boys all but one dead. This last one had a ripped off arm and claw marks all over.

I met him in a hospital, undercover as a police officer. Asked him what happened: Apparently him and his friends where in the woods, walking along the small trails into the forest. Honestly from the sounds of it the one they were on wasn't even a path, sounded more like an animal trail.

They walked down. Him in the very back. Everyone single file. The path was tight so they kept ducking and climbing over branches. Honestly don't get the appeal but apparently its scary and thrilling.

He explained how there was a strange branch coming up, it was thick coming out from behind a tree. it split into two before the branches just ended. That one was more spikey and covered in moss and leaves then the others and there was longer sharp spiked branches running along the inside of the two.

The part that caught his eye was a hole on the side. The friends in front was getting close to the breach, about their head hight, the top one stretched forward so they'd have to duck under. And with the bottom it almost hanged limply downwards. 

He told me "it felt off, like it was slightly out of place." And he couldn't take his eyes off the hole, a black hole with "like something reflective, water or something".

His friend reached it. Ducked their head under the branch. Then he saw the hole move… an eye. The branches snapped shut in an instant, crushing their head. Then with his friend still in his mouth it turned and looked straight at him, "some sort of monster!"

They erupted from the bushes, other creatures. One launched on his friend in front, knocking them both to the ground. He hit his head and blacked out.

He woke up to something tearing into his arm, crunching through the flesh and bones, ripping it off. He couldn't scream, his friends covering his face, pushing down on his throat. "I couldn't see, barely breathe, my arm felt numb, well what was left of it. I felt a claw or something digging into my leg. Rigid like wood, but it wasn't after me." He went on to tell me how he heard crunching and chewing, feeling something wet run down his face from his friend on top. Frozen in fear.

Then he felt his friend get pulled off him. He took a shallow breath and slowly looked about, he watched as his friends got dragged. Disappearing into the bushes. He barely got a glimpse of them.

After what he claimed to be hours he got up. On the ground, two of his friends, the ones left behind. Dead. "But that wasn't the worst part, my arm. Ripped apart, bites taken out of it, red everywhere.”

After that he ran home, running through bushes, the branches slashing him. With every cut he twitched, with every odd shape he could feel the fear grow. By the time he was back to civilization he was covered in cuts and passed out on a road.
 
After the talk, I told him there was no creatures. We couldn’t tell him what really happened but from talking to the local police, there was a gang they couldn't land any evidence on. Throw a little tampering around the scene and around the gang and a little bribery we placed the blame on them. convincing the doctors all his injuries that looked "odd" were from his manic running.

Somehow we even got the kid himself convinced he saw someone, the bites and eating would have been a little hard to explain but luckily for the mission the creatures took off with the bodies. Leaving just the boys testimony which can be so easily shaped based on a few leading questions and other manipulation.

I'm not proud of what I do. But I do it, I'm in too deep to quit.

Despite how evil these cover-ups feel I do help people. Here I stopped a hole gang and managed to get fencing and a new "natural reserve" to prevent further attacks.

All this just one of many stories. Some are way worse, some with fair higher deaths. some just like this one. To the point I can tell you this story and the higher ups won't even know which case I'm talking about. (We don't keep many specifics from cases)

I'm writing these because I can't keep doing this. I have to tell people. People have to know the truth about there world and what lives in it.
