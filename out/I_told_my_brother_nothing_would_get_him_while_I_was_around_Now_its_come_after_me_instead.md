A bit of background information to start - my little brother is on the autism spectrum. He was diagnosed at only two years old, and our mother has been amazing at meeting his complex needs.

Because of his autism, my brother has sensory overloads a lot, and frequently has outbursts he can’t control. What usually follows is thirty minutes of him screaming at the top of his lungs, before he’ll calm down and watch his tablet like nothing ever happened. Or at least, this used to be the case. For the last few weeks, these outbursts have become less and less frequent, and he’s developed noticeable bags under his eyes.

Within the first week, my mother had grown concerned enough to take him to a doctor. But aside from the aforementioned eye-bags, the doctor found nothing, and concluded that my brother was simply maturing quicker, and was growing out of these tantrums. This didn’t sit right with my mother. But she decided to let it be for now. 

However, my brother was getting worse by the day. The bags under his eyes were rapidly darkening, and when I would walk by his room during a late-night trip to the bathroom, I’d sometimes hear quiet whimpering, and sometimes even light scratching. In retrospect, I don’t know why I never checked on him. 

Last week, everything changed. I had been up late playing games online with friends, and I was heading downstairs to grab a drink before sleeping. But as I walked by my brother’s room, I could just barely make out an eerie melody being whistled from inside. The long, legato notes composed a melancholic, yet creepy tune, and it made me very, very uneasy. I quickly headed back into my room, and got into bed, replaying that melody over and over in my head all night. As you can expect, sleep never truly came.

The next day, my mother went shopping, and left me to look after my little brother. We were both sitting in the living room – I was watching a show on TV, and my brother was sitting and drawing at the coffee table. I got a bit peckish after a while, and turned down the TV to ask my brother if he was hungry. That’s when I noticed my brother was humming a familiar tune as he drew. The same eerie melody I’d heard from outside his door not 12 hours before. I felt the blood drain from my face, and I swear I could hear a faint whistling accompany my brother’s humming. But I regained my composure, and asked:

“Hey, bud, that’s a nice tune you’re humming. Where’d you hear it from?” My brother put his pencil down, and looked up at me, confused.

“I wasn’t humming any tune,” he replied. At this point, I was fairly creeped out, but I reaffirmed he was, and reluctantly began whistling the same tune I’d heard him humming. My brother turned white as a sheet; fear etched on his little face.

“No, no, no! Not that song!” he screamed. “That’s HIS tune.” I asked who “he” was, and my brother slowly slid the picture he’d been drawing across the table.

He had drawn a long, black silhouette on the paper. The bright yellow eyes had no pupils or iris to speak of, and his mouth was drawn in a simple O shape; almost as if he was whistling.

Immediately, I felt a chill down my spine. This time, I was almost positive that I could hear someone, or something, whistling that same eerie melody right behind me. But I pushed the feeling down as far as it would go, and enveloped my brother in a hug. I said the classic big brother stuff about monsters, that nothing would get him while I was around. Although internally, I wasn’t so sure.

The next morning, I woke up and went downstairs. While I made breakfast, my mother told me that my little brother had woken up in the night, screaming his head off. I felt the colour drain from my face as I recalled our conversation, but when I glanced into the living room, he seemed fine. My mother told me he’d had a nightmare. I alone know better.

Since that morning, my brother seems to be improving. The bags on his eyes are disappearing, and his energy is returning as the days pass. I’ve seen him playing out in the garden every afternoon, enjoying his summer, like every little kid should. And yes, the outbursts have returned, but most importantly, he’s back to normal.

Now this SHOULD be where the story ends. But here’s the thing…

I’ve been having sleeping problems.

I feel more sluggish and tired as the days pass, and I’m slowly but surely gaining dark bags under my eyes, just as my little brother did. My parents are concerned for me, as I barely have the energy to turn on my PC and play games. My friends message me constantly, asking if I’m okay, and every time they do, I always say I’m fine. That couldn’t be further from the truth.

Even now, as I type this, I can hear that eerie melody being whistled outside my door. I’ve woken up multiple times to a long, black silhouette with piercing yellow eyes, standing at the edge of my bed and staring at me, whistling that haunting tune.

I did tell my brother that nothing would get him while I was around, and I stand by it. What could a creature like this want with an autistic child? Besides, as creepy as this thing is, it’s just a shadow. And shadows can’t kill. I’m sure I’ll be fine…

…right?
