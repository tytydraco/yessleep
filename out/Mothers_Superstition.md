When Lukas and I were little, my mother always spoke of the family superstition- telling people that he and I were “connected.” She always said it like it was cute- almost like twin telepathy.

“When one gets hurt, the other always follows”, she’d say.

And for a while, it really did seem almost like some kind of twin magic.
Lukas would scrape his knee, and later that afternoon I’d trip running up the steps to the front door. 
If Lukas cut his finger in the kitchen, later I’d nick mine on the lid of an aluminum can. 
The injuries were never very serious, but it happened often enough that everyone started tallying the occurrences and the family’s superstition rang true- Every bruise has its twin. 

A lot of the injuries I can’t recall very well, but I do remember the one specifically where they stopped being so funny. 

When Lukas was six, he slipped on the playground and needed stitches after splitting his lip open. In the hospital waiting room, while our mom was filling out paperwork, I fell backwards off the waiting room chair and hit my head so hard I was knocked unconscious and needed stitches too. 

From that day forward the injuries started to grow in severity. When Lukas was 12, he went to the ER for severe stomach pain. The next day, I dislocated my shoulder while playing in the yard. Once I dented the side of my car while driving and a few days later Lukas blew a tire and swerved into a ditch. Nothing seemingly life-threatening, but still the injuries started to warrant more and more hospital visits. 

Twins ran in our family, so this wasn’t a new phenomenon, but the frequency and severity of our injuries proved rare. 

Except for one pair, two twin boys on our mother’s side. When the boys had just turned 18, one drowned. The other died in his sleep that night. Up until now, we’d never given it much thought beyond a freak coincidence.

Lukas always had a darker sense of humor about the family’s superstition.
He laughed almost like he knew something that I didn’t when I had  come home with a sprained wrist from basketball. When my injuries proved to be continuously worse than his, he’d remark that he must be the indestructible one between the two of us. 
One night, I sliced my knee open on the gravel driveway and he just laughed and said, “Don’t worry, I’ll get you back.”

That night, I watched him slam his hand in a drawer hard enough to tear open his knuckles and break a few fingers. Nothing happened for two days, until the curling iron got seemingly lodged around my hair, burning off the captured chunk and causing second degree burns on my neck in the process.

After that, Lukas started to get… strange.

He didn’t often sleepwalk, but it also wasn’t unusual for him, it’s something he’s done since we were small. But the summer before senior year, he started sleepwalking a lot more. He’d come into my room at night, half-asleep, his eyes open but looking glossed over.
He’d just stand there, in my doorway or at the edge of my bed, breathing heavily, staring, like he was waiting for something.

Our mom did recall one time, when we still shared a room, she’d seen Lukas standing next to my bed on the baby monitor, and heard him mumble something to me in a child-like fashion, something that sounded like “Does it hurt yet?”

At 18, we moved out of the house at the same time. Different cities, thousands of miles apart. I thought the distance would finally blur the timing of the injuries. 

It didn’t.

During my first year at university, Lukas would text me photos of any injuries he got. Any rational person would assume this to be a loving warning- to me it felt taunting.

By the start of my third year, I stopped replying to his messages. A few months before graduation, he called me late at night.

“I’ve been thinking,” he said. “Maybe we could test it. See how far it goes.”

I blocked his number. 

I hadn’t heard from him in about a year when my mother called me. She was crying. 
Lukas had been found dead in the middle of the road, barefoot and in his pajamas, covered in tiny, strange, and seemingly self-inflicted injuries.

The funeral was yesterday. When I got home, I tripped going up the stairs. I caught myself on the railing and nervously laughed it off, pulling myself up right. I got ready for bed in my childhood home, faced with all the evidence of where my brother had once existed.

After having gone to bed, sometime between 3 and 4AM, I woke up to a sound. 
Three soft knocks on my bedroom door. 

I thought maybe it was my mother- maybe she couldn’t sleep.
But when I opened the door, the hallway was empty, looking into the dark living room.

That’s when I saw the faint reflection in the dark TV screen just behind me. 

The figure looked like Lukas, except his head was tilted at an odd angle, eyes glossed over, and his mouth just slightly open like he was trying to say something.

I didn’t turn around, just staring into the reflection, unmoving.

When he finally spoke, his voice sounded strange.
It sounded like both of ours, layered over top one another, except one sounded like it was coming from farther away.

His distorted voice whispered to my ear “It’s your turn.”
