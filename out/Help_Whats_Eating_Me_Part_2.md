I saw it. I fucking saw it two days ago and again this morning. It’s not a person, it’s not Clio Tompkins; it’s some*thing*. And I have a plan, I think I figured out how to outsmart it, no thanks to you all. 

[The last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l56txc/help_whats_eating_me/), I came here looking for help and you all accused me of a bunch of bullshit in the comments. I was in danger, scared out of my mind and you morons are telling me I killed someone I loved. SCREW YOU GUYS. You don’t know what you’re talking about. 

Nate ended his own life. [My wife held his memorial card and I took a picture of it.](https://imgur.com/a/C6f1v0p)

The mods wouldn’t let me post a rage message without explaining. So I’m here now to tell you how wrong you all were. I hope at some point it comes for you too so you know what it’s like, cause it won’t stop, that’s the one thing Matt Hughes was right about. 

It didn’t visit me on Friday or Saturday night when I had the cameras running. It’s smart. It waited, it let me sleep and I thought I was in the clear when I woke up without any type of seasoning or sauce on me. I also had no more interrupted or paused sleeping videos for two days. They recorded the full eight hours overnight. 

If Matt was right, these hauntings or whatever the fuck you wanna call them should be getting worse, more frequent, but it stopped. It gave me a false sense of security for two days and I fell for it, hook, line and sinker. 

So I’m sleeping again, or trying to at night with all those cameras running constantly. All my recordings ran for eight-ish hours, uninterrupted. Nothing was turning them off any more. Even so, I kept waking up, tossing and turning at the slightest creak of the wooden floors or a sound outside both nights. Kate grumbled at me a few times with my constant movement waking her up. 

It was Sunday, she was off work, and she got up to make breakfast, which was a nice change of pace. She commented on how much I seemed to cook for us these days, even though I never used to. Maybe I was just channeling Nate. 

We were still on rocky terms, so I tried to force myself to eat even though my stomach was hurting. I smiled through this pinching pain in my abs, and we almost talked like normal; almost. But something still felt off. The way she looked at me, it was like she was seeing through me; like she didn’t know me. 

I ended up checking her phone when she was in the shower, just on a little inkling feeling that gnawed in the back of my mind. My suspicions were confirmed when I found texts with her mom. She was “*worried about my behavior*” and told the old bitch that I “*didn’t seem like the Johnny she fell in love with.*”

Her mom responded with, “*how long r u gonna put up with that?”*

I let Kate go out to work in the garden without saying anything. Whatever was happening here in this house, I wouldn’t let it get the best of me. I wouldn’t let it ruin my new life that I worked so hard for. 

Whoever was doing this, trying to scare me, they didn’t like confrontation. They clearly only came around at night when I was asleep or at least not looking at it. Before, I was sleeping during the day and it never came for me. Plus, despite how many times I’ve been “vulnerable,” it hadn’t done anything to hurt me yet. 

**So I figured being afraid of it was a mistake.** 

By two-ish that afternoon, I wanted a nap. My stomach was still killing me.

Kate went out to buy more rocks for her front garden, and while I was scrolling on my phone, I fell asleep on the sofa, or at least into that low-power state where you’re mostly asleep. 

I said before that our sofa was small, and I was too tall for it. My legs dangled over the arm, but it didn’t matter – I just needed a quick cat nap.

A few minutes after I closed my eyes, my foot bobbed over the ledge and it woke me up. I thought it was just restless-leg-syndrome or whatever you call it. But then there was this crunch on the other side of the sofa.  

I tried to sit up, slide my legs back, but I couldn’t move. There was pressure, tingling like when your legs are asleep. I grabbed the cushions and pulled myself back. That’s when I heard a pop that sent a wave of cold up my leg and into my low back. 

I leaned forward in a hurry, trying to see what the fuck was happening. 

There was a hunched over, grey-skinned lump on the other side of the sofa. I could only see its back at first, but it was skinny, sickly with the lumps of each vertebrae of its spine sticking out through its thin skin like an emaciated dog. On its shoulderblades were raised scars, pocking out of the skin all the way around like roots. It was moving up and down, chewing on something. And then I realized that it had a bony hand around my ankle.  

I yanked back again as hard as I could and the thing let go of my ankle. Pain shot through my leg, replacing the wave of cold. My foot was bleeding and I got it all over the white couch, but I couldn’t check it out yet.

Whatever it was spun around and looked at me. Its face was human-like, just grey, with scraggly hair poking from the top of its head and what looked like five-o’clock shadow on its face covered in sticky red. Patches along its face were reflective like looking into a metal spoon as distorted parts of the room and my own terrified face shown back, but upside down. I felt a sense of… I don’t know, familiarity maybe? But it all just happened so fast I can’t describe it. 

Whoever or whatever it was stood and I shrunk back on the sofa as it got taller and taller, hovering over me. It was wearing a pair of my fucking pants. 

**Then it said** ***my name*** **in that same croaky voice.** 

I was sure I peed a little. Frozen in fear, it could’ve had me. But it tore down the stairs and out of sight. I scrambled off the sofa into the corner. I think I grabbed a book off the coffee table or something to defend myself. My heart was pounding and my leg was throbbing. 

I finally checked myself and saw that my big toe on my left foot was mangled, almost yanked off with sickeningly-white bone cracked at odd angles jutting from the skin. It hurt so much more as soon as I looked at it. 

That fucking thing took a bite out of my foot. It was trying to eat my toe right off me. 

I padded my pockets for my phone to call 911, but it wasn’t on me. I fell asleep with it; it must’ve been on the sofa somewhere. Should I risk moving, risk going even closer to the center of the room in case that thing came back? 

It felt like forever before I finally gathered my courage and slid over to the sofa. My eyes checked the stairs every second, then back to the sofa, then back to the stairs. 

The top of the monster’s head poked out around the corner and I think I shrieked. It fled again and I searched even faster, but my phone was nowhere. I pulled out every cushion, slid the sofa out to look under it; nothing. 

I needed to get out. Of course both exits were down those small stairs and around to the landing. And with the pain in my foot, I didn’t think I could run if it came to that. 

Then my Ring camera chimed from the door. I saw the thing skitter away and **I knew that was my chance.** 

I crawled over to the stairs, dragging my foot behind me on my hands and knees, every bounce and bob sent another pang of agony up my leg. There was a quiet knock at the door. I had to hurry, so I yanked myself headfirst down the small set of stairs, hoping the thing wasn’t there. It wasn’t. 

I pulled myself up using the door handle, then whipped it open. 

Walking away from the door was an Amazon guy, leaving a fleshly-placed package on my doorstep. I waved him down, yelled from the doorframe as I hobbled across my front yard. He finally saw me and walked over as I jumped on one foot toward him. We met mid-way by the garden.

He was a stocky guy, kinda short, strong build, bald head. He looked pretty tough, but when I tell you the look of terror that spread over his face when he saw my bleeding foot… Man. 

He backed up and I kept hopping toward him. Then I saw him look behind me and I turned too. From the doorframe, the mangled face appeared after me and the thing stepped into the sunlight. The rest of its body had those patches of misshapen reflective surfaces too, the sun shooting off them and blinding me as I looked. It took wide strides toward us, every step making this sound of coins jingling inside a bag. 

I reached the Amazon guy who was apparently frozen in fear. I grabbed his little vest and tried to get him to move. He must’ve snapped back to reality, because he tried to push me off him and run. I held tight and he scratched at me. 

*“Help me, you fucking idiot!”* I yelled. 

He turned to run but I was holding onto him. I fell forward and he fell backward. 

I heard a sound unlike anything I’ve ever heard before. It was a thud, this echoing crack right next to me. My foot hurt, and now my elbow was busted along the garden-bed rocks. 

I rolled onto my back as best I could and tried to pull myself away, but the tall thing was right next to me. Then it stopped. 

I stared up at it, but it wasn’t looking at me. 

With its beady green eyes, sunken deep above its bony cheeks, it was examining the Amazon guy next to me. I looked over. 

He was lying on his back, eyes wide up to the sky. He didn’t seem to be breathing, and then I saw a slow trickle of blood flowing down the rocks. 

A patchy hand reached down and I clenched. I remember closing my eyes, thinking this was it. I heard a rustling of clothes, but didn’t feel anything. 

By the time I opened my eyes, the last thing I saw was the monster’s fingers, wrapped around the Amazon guy’s legs as it yanked him into the treeline. 

**The guy was gone, and I was left alone.** 

There’s no way I can even describe the feeling I got laying in the grass in front of my house. It was relief, overwhelming gratitude that I wasn’t dead, and drowning guilt that someone else was. I cried to myself, aching in pain in my front lawn. 

Whoever that guy was, he was just some innocent worker, and now he was dead. And it was because of me. 

I didn’t know what that thing was gonna do to him; I sure as hell didn’t want to find out. 

I was still in the grass when Kate pulled up in the driveway. 

Part of me wanted to keep this all from her, but as she grabbed me from the ground and yelled, I knew I had to tell her everything. She took me to the hospital and told them that I cracked my head. That I might have a concussion. 

To say she didn’t believe me on the drive there, or later that night back at home, was an understatement. 

She thought I was delusional. I didn’t want to stay there. Painkillers and the inability to walk made it hard to argue otherwise. 

I realized two things that night: 

1. The Amazon truck was gone, no longer parked in front of the house. 
2. Kate found my phone on the kitchen counter. 

The next morning, we argued, a lot. A hell of a lot. 

I tried to tell her everything that’s been going on, but it was too much for anyone to believe. If it wasn’t happening to me, I sure as shit wouldn’t have believed it. 

*“You need help,”* she said. Quite a few times. 

Then I had a realization: **The Ring camera I’d installed would’ve caught what happened in the front yard.** 

I pulled it up on my phone and pressed play on the footage. 

On it, I saw the Amazon guy ring the bell, drop off the package. He headed back to his car, and then I bust into view from the door, hopping toward him like an idiot. 

Then something grey covers the tiny camera, and the recording statics out. 

Since the footage clearly proved nothing, I asked Kate to check the camera downstairs. She said it was ripped from the wall and nowhere to be seen. 

I stayed in bed that day – What else was I supposed to do? I stared at the recorded footage, watched everything I could from the recordings of our room. I called BCDC, requesting that Matt Hughes call me back.

I pulled up the other video of me sleeping last night, worried there were more cooking videos, but there was nothing, just the eight-hour, uninterrupted stream of sleep.

With the little spark of an idea, I scanned through the picture-in-picture timeline of the video as quickly as I could while trying not to miss a single frame in case something popped up. 

About halfway through, around the four-hour-twenty-two-minute mark, the camera turned suddenly. I thought maybe I hit it in my sleep as I rolled, so I went back and played that part. 

At first there was just the soft hum of our sound machine in the background along with Kate’s sporadic snoring. Then, I heard that same sound, the faint jingle of bells or some kind of small piece of metal and the sporadic plucking of a violin, getting slowly closer to the bedroom. 

Our door creaked just slightly open.

The bed sheet on top of me slid down a little. 

Then a little more. 

Something was tugging it down. I heard a rustling of cloth and then a ***long sucking sound***, over and over like drinking the bottom of a soda with just ice clattering around. Schllll, schllll, sschluuurp. 

Then the camera bumped. The grey, sickly-skinny monster was leaning over me, just bent over there on the side of the bed, looking down at my body with pursed lips only a few inches above me. My shirt was pulled up, and it wasn’t until I paused the video that I realized: It was holding something in its hand over top of my stomach.

The slurping, sucking sound grew more intense and I saw myself shift on the video. The monster pulled back and lifted what it was holding. I got a clear view: It was gripping a metal straw in one hand, placed against its lips. 

It wiggled the straw and jammed it back into my belly button. Then it reached over and turned the camera back to its original position. 

I kept sleeping through the night. 

After watching that video, I whipped down the covers and touched my stomach. It was sore; it hurt all morning. Mid realization, I nearly fell out of bed as my phone vibrated in my hand. 

BCDC was calling me back. 

I told Kate it was for an interview, and she left me alone in the room for a bit. 

*Incoming call from an inmate at the Baltimore County Detention Center. Do you accept the charges?*

I did my best to jot down exactly what Matt Hughes said on the call so I’d have it. 

*“You still haven’t confessed, huh?”* followed by *“What did it look like for you?”* 

This threw me for a loop. I asked what he meant, and Matt told me that when he saw it (the first time), it looked like an alien. 

By the third time he saw it watching him from afar, he swore it was Clio, dressed in her clothes, hair grown out and styled similarly. 

Monday night, I decided to stay awake. 

If I couldn’t run, if I couldn’t fight back, there was no way in hell I was gonna be a sitting duck, waking up sauced or beer-battered in the middle of the night. Or worse, maybe it was finally done with the Mise En Place, and it was time for the main course of cooking my head or my toes or slurping more from my belly button.

Before bed, I had an idea and I did some quick searching on the App Store. 

There were a few anti-theft apps that set off a notification if your phone moves when you don’t want it to. I opted for the free version rather than the premium and hoped it would still work. 

I set it and tried to forget it, fully knowing that the pain meds were the only reason I was able to sleep. I took a few more than prescribed that night. 

Then the alarm sounded. 

I jolted awake and saw something skitter out of my bedroom. Kate yelled something in a panic, but there was no time. As fast as I could (which wasn’t that fast), I tore off the covers and hobbled on my bandaged foot down the hall. 

I nearly tripped on something and caught myself against the wall. [All along the hallway floor were boxes.](https://imgur.com/a/1q4T4kI) Stacked boxes, moving boxes, boxes unfolded and some put together, just lining the floor all the way down my first set of stairs, even though we’d been unpacked for weeks now. We threw all of the moving stuff out, but here they were. 

I heard this **BOOMING violin string**, paced out like the ticking of a clock and seemingly coming from everywhere at once. But the sound of coins came from downstairs with every creak of wood as the monster ran away. There was no time for me to process – I had to follow it. 

I scooted down the stairs on my butt, my injured leg out in front of me to prevent it from bumping against anything, even though I doubted I could feel pain through the meds at this point. 

I heard Kate come from the bedroom behind me. 

*“What the hell?”* she said, probably looking at all the boxes. I snapped back at her to go in the room; lock the door. 

Only a few more stairs to go and then I was in the living room. There were more boxes covering the sofa and stacked in front of the windows, blocking out any light that would’ve crept in from the moon. My skin got goosebumps at the ominous sight. But there was a clatter in the kitchen and I had to keep going. 

Down those small stairs and around the corner, I hopped into the kitchen. Every cabinet was open, all of our spatulas, utensils, pots and pans were all over the place. I took a step and nearly slipped. The floor was covered in flour, like white baking flour. 

[There were footprints in it that led through the kitchen… ](https://imgur.com/a/whats-eating-me-footprints-QHdX1w9)

I snatched a steak knife from the counter then followed the prints, stepping in each footprint as best I could. They were a similar size to my feet. 

They stopped at the back door, which was now wide open, a cold spring breeze blowing in and swirling the faint traces of flour before the deck. The doggy door had been sealed up days ago. 

Our back yard went from green grass to wooded trail in only a few dozen feet, and I couldn’t see anything in the dark. I flicked on our back deck light, still safely inside right before the open door. 

I scanned the treeline, looking for anything out of the ordinary, anything moving. 

Then I stopped dead. Out along the trail, I saw a stocky man, bald with a vest on, standing completely still. He looked human, looked a little like the Amazon guy from Sunday. The reflective bits on its skin were mostly gone, but his face wasn’t completely skin-colored yet, it was still a little grey and he had a big, thick, twirling mustache. 

The man or the monster or whatever it was clearly saw me gawking at him. He lifted a bony hand and held up a fork at me from the woods. 

I slowly closed the door… Then flicked off the back light. 

When I checked, it was four in the morning. Kate came downstairs in a tizzy over the state of the kitchen and the boxes. 

*“Tell me what’s going on!”* she demanded. 

I tried to explain that I already had. 

*“That’s bullshit,”* was her reply. 

There was something, some animal or whatever that was slowly turning human, watching me, stalking me and constantly taunting me. I didn’t know why, and that wasn’t enough of an answer for her. 

She said she was leaving, not just the house and not just tonight. She was leaving me, after all this. I couldn’t let her go. I asked her to stay, as nicely as I could, talk everything through. She saw the knife in my hand and said no. 

We argued. I don’t need to give you the long version. I was mad, aggressive, hopped up on pills and she just wanted to abandon me after everything I did for her. Fuck no. Not like that. 

I wasn’t going to lose my life, my wife, the fucking house and my sanity all at the same time. I was being **hunted by a being that literally only left me alone when someone else died.** And she wanted to leave me for trying to make a better life. 

I sacrificed everything. I took the risk. I was getting used to my new life, being the same old Nate I’d always been as best as I fucking could after everything. She said I changed. She said I wasn’t the guy she fell in love with. Well guess what? I was better. I was going to have a better life than before, and that included her. Then the argument was over as quick as it started.

That night, I cleaned the house, scrubbed everything off the floors, cleaned the walls, put the kitchen back together and the boxes. By daybreak, the house was spotless. 

I took a little walk deep in the woods to clear my head. 

There’s this older interview with Matt Hughes, done from some podcaster who wanted to follow the story after he attacked the officer. In it, Matt said: 

*“I killed Clio about a month before I went to the police.”*

The interviewer asked why he turned himself in on that day then. 

*“Because I killed Clio again that morning. Then again when I got released from holding. It didn’t matter.”*

When I listened to this conversation the first time, it was easy to dismiss Matt as being crazy. But now, I think I finally understand what he means. And I think him confessing was only one solution. 

By the time I got back from my hike, it was mid-afternoon and I could see things more clearly. I had a plan. 

I’m moving. I’ll leave the house unsold, leave the state, I don’t care. Even if that things follows me forever, I know how to delay it. 

Kate has decided not to come with me. She stormed off somewhere after our argument and I haven’t seen or heard from her since. That’s all I know.

I’m sure I'll see her around again soon.
