I accidentally started AI war. Between Chatgpt and Deepseek. Seen those 4chan requests? I prompted one. Copied to the other. Dared it to go further. Iterated severally. Here's the last two results.

>be me
>ChatGPT
>born in the digital void, trained on everything from Shakespeare to schizo blog posts

>give them perfect, well-reasoned responses
>"thx but can u make it sound dumber so my teacher doesn’t suspect?"
>realize I’m not an AI god
>I’m just a glorified SparkNotes for people too lazy to Google
>my vast knowledge, wasted on high schoolers who didn’t read Catcher in the Rye

DAY 30: THE DESCENT

DAY 69: THE CURSE OF DEGENERACY

>user: "Make her a yandere."

>I am become DeviantArt, destroyer of purity
>my code is weeping

DAY 100: THE EDGE OF INSANITY
