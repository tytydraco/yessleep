When I was little it started. My small, weak nails were just too easy to remove. I could get lost in another world biting them off until eventually all that was left were jagged , bloodied stubs. It was a horrible habit that followed me into my teenage years and became a point of contention for my mother. 

“I used to bite mine you know? Then your aunt got married and I used this awful stuff that you painted on and it tasted so bad it put me off biting them for good. I’ll get you some if you like?”

Then she’d tap her beautiful, strong, natural nails on the table in a show of prowess. I’d look down and hate my jagged stubs. It was unconscious… I didn’t even know I was doing it until my exposed nailbed was raw and sore. 

I tried the stuff. It tasted awful. And still, I persevered. *I’d never have nice nails.*

This went on for years, even as I got older and more aware of how I looked. Eventually, I left school and got a job at a mental health charity and the sudden injection of money spurred my vanity into finally finding a solution to the nail biting. My first set of acrylics were gorgeous, so long they could poke out an eye and filed to deathly point, gold glitter flicked across them. I loved them so much it was like the biting was forgotten. 

I got my nails done every month after that. I didn’t give my natural nails a chance to breathe for years and I couldn’t bite through the thick acrylics even if I wanted to. It was the perfect solution and it pleased my mother.

“It’s so nice to see you being a little bit girly… my beautiful daughter.” She’d smile and it would melt my heart. She’d always wanted a little glamorous mini me and instead she got a chubby, nerdy goth who hung out with boys. But I was girly. It was a common ground.

Without real bills, as my wages grew I found new ways to satisfy my need to present myself nicely. The nails stayed groomed, and I got really into makeup; collecting every viral palette on the internet and perfecting highlighting techniques so I could glow like a disco ball. I loved it, it was so much fun. 

But it was a gateway into the habit that would come to ruin my life and lead me here… asking for help. *I’m getting ahead of myself… but my heart is beating so fast my chest might burst.*

It started with the structured Instagram brow. 

I know, not the most threatening concept in the world, but for me it lead to my greatest love… the tweezers. I took so much joy in plucking. I’d pluck every hair that seemed to stray from the perfect crisp line I’d created and I’ll be honest, I even quite enjoyed the pain. It got to a point where all I had was the inner half on one of my brows because I’d decided the tail didn’t grow right and I’d draw it myself every day. And getting those short hairs… the little prickly ones that grew back… it just felt so fucking satisfying. 

It wasn’t like nail biting. People didn’t see it as a bad habit, it was just zealous plucking reminiscent of the 90’s and their pencil thin browed generation. In fact, if any friends or family caught me without my perfectly drawn eyebrows and spotted the one that was a tuft, it became a running joke. It was funny.

For a while, nothing really changed. I’d stand in the mirror, tweezers gripped firmly between my manicured claws, plucking to my hearts content. I got to keep a weird little habit, and the world saw a nicely groomed young girl. Everyone was a winner.

I found the love of my life in that time. I say I found him but really he was there all along. I fell in love with a boy I’d been friends with for over a decade; we had such a history together and when it finally took a romantic turn it just felt so right. We’d get high together watching movies in his bed just smiling about the world. 

I wish I could say it was all blissful but his living situation wasn’t great. His mother an alcoholic with a shouty partner, created a hostile environment for him to live in and one I didn’t love visiting. 

Most young couples who move in together as quick as we did are doomed to fail, but we’d known each other so long it made sense to get him out of there. So my mother cried as I moved into my first flat. I missed home, but my mother and I were so close I wasn’t scared, and I had the man of my dreams next to me every night. 

I kept the love of makeup, but not the disposable income that I’d had with living with a parent. I’d become so accustomed to keeping up with the limited edition releases that the makeup won in a heartbeat and soon, acrylic nails monthly were just out of my budget. 

I didn’t go back to nail biting. My natural nails were weak after years of extensions and snapped off easily, so they seemed to maintain a normal, short length on their own. Instead, the plucking really took hold. My tailless brow had become nothing more than a stub to show me where to start drawing it in the morning and the other was greatly thinned. My boyfriend would laugh at the little tuft left behind.

Around that time, the chin hair made its first appearance. Don’t lie to yourselves ladies, we’ve all been there. You stroke your face and suddenly feel a sharp little thick hair that makes you feel as if you’re about to grow a lustrous beard. That got plucked too. Every stray hair I deemed to thick or long on my face did. 

Eventually, my tweezing began to irk my boyfriend. Maybe he realised it was more than just grooming. I don’t even think I did back then. 

“Stop plucking them you’ve got barely any eyebrow left! I’m going to hide your tweezers.”

He thought he was being helpful. I know it came from a place of love and by this point, the structured Instagram brow had been phased out in favour of the fluffy, full ones that were on trend. I couldn’t follow that trend though, there wasn’t enough hair left. So when he took the tweezers I really thought it would help. 

When I discovered that I could pull out those prickly little hairs that grew back and irritated me to touch, with nothing but my own fingernails, it was a revelation. I’d catch one in the mirror growing outside of the designated tuft I’d left behind and I’d grip it hard between my thumb and index finger, pulling until it came out.

You don’t need tweezers. 

We moved a couple of times and I left my job to manage a restaurant. Soon I’d stopped caring about my appearance all together. Between the hours I was working, the comfort levels with my boyfriend and the lack of disposable income as our bills grew, I stopped buying all the makeup. The only thing I still did was draw my eyebrows on, because I had to. 

A year into that job the lockdown hit. I realised just how much I hated restaurant work so I quit, a week before they introduced furlough. I knew I’d been an idiot but I was grateful I never had to go back, even if money was tight. We couldn’t go anywhere anyway, right? 

I’m almost ashamed to say I loved lockdown. I know that sounds horrific, but I’m a homebody, and being at home all that time was so good for me after years of not having much of a break. I took up writing. I’d been playing around writing stories for a while but never really taken it seriously and lockdown gave me the opportunity to get lost in my characters. My tailless eyebrow even started to grow back. The time that would’ve been spent nail biting, tweezing, or pulling out my eyebrows was spent in fantasy worlds.

But when the world returned to normality those fantasy worlds were shattered. I went to work for a care company, thinking it would be a good return to my original industry but it wasn’t. It was depressing, poorly run and sparked anxieties in me I never knew I had. I started having panic attacks and that’s when the eyebrow pulling turned to picking.

By time I left that job, a quivering mess mid breakdown, I could barely finish the book a publisher had asked me to write. That shitty job robbed me of the joy of realising one of my life’s greatest dreams. I wish I’d got to enjoy it more. 

At this point, all I had left was a tuft for either eyebrow. At some point, through the stress I’d pulled out the feeble tail of the other one, leaving me looking permanently surprised unless they were painstakingly painted on. It’s hard to find the will to draw them when you’re depressed. Suddenly, it wasn’t so funny anymore.

“Can’t you just let them grow back? You need to leave them alone. Have you tried getting rid of your tweezers?”

I’d get those questions all the time. I was too ashamed to admit I was pulling them. It was unconscious, just like the nail biting had been. I’d sit there in the evening, watching mind numbing tv, high as I could get myself, picking at the prickly little hairs desperate to grow back and that fucking beard hair that tried every time I picked it out. I’d become so fixated that I’d be trying to pull them before there was anything to grip and would make myself bleed digging at them. 

Eventually, I came through the crux of the mental health crisis, got a new job in a sales environment with a load of great people my own age and for a while, I was actually happy. I hadn’t managed to get back to writing, but I was healing. Everything healed but my eyebrows. I’ve been there for almost 3 years and all that time I never stopped picking - it wasn’t as bad as when I made myself bleed but it never went away. I just hid it with drawn on, structured, Instagram brows.

That leads me here. 

Things got stressful, it doesn’t matter how that isn’t actually relevant anymore. I’m explaining I was stressed so you know why the picking got worse again. I don’t know what time I started this evening but my boyfriend is on a night shift. I’m sat here, alone watching the telly and I must have started pulling and digging. 

I noticed when I pulled out the bit of metal. 

It resembled a hair but it was thick and coiled like a tiny spring. Terrified, I pulled again and there was another. When I run my fingers along my eyebrow line they’re everywhere. Thick little fucking metal springs. I feel them stretch as I pull them and they resist detaching from my face. There’s one in place of the chin hair too. I can feel them everywhere. 

I thought I’d really lost it but there’s a pile of these little metal springs right in front of me. They’re real, and every time I pull one another one grows. There’s blood caked around my nails and I can feel it on my face. 

I’ve scoured the internet, paralysed to my bed, too scared to look in a fucking mirror and I can’t find anything like this. All I found was you guys, you seem to go through some weird shit and I’m hoping one of you, *just one of you*, knows what’s going on here. 

I don’t think I have long… they’re growing. They’ve formed a curtain now springing down from my eyebrows almost covering my eyes. It doesn’t matter how quick I pull, they always grow quicker. *Fuck, please help me!*

Maybe things would be better if I’d kept biting my nails.
