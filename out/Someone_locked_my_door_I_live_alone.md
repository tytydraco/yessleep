I cannot let this go and it is actually scaring me. 

I rent an apartment in a gated community. There is a security guard you have to check in with to get through the gate. You have to be called in by a resident who lives in the neighborhood. 

Today I left my apartment and I left the door purposefully unlocked, as my mom was dropping something off and she does not have a key to my apartment. I am 10000% positive I did not lock the door. I had a basket of clothes in my hands and could barely even close the door on my way out. 

I returned home before my mom made it over. When I went to open my door the handle turned but the bolt was locked. I tried to push harder and realized it was truly locked. Confused, I pulled my keys from the bottom of my purse, unlocked the deadbolt and entered my apartment. 

I have a large dog who is half Pitbull half Catahoula. Whoever tried to enter my house was definitely not successful because my dog would have been right there and not recognizing the person he would’ve gone crazy. So I’m assuming they shut the door and locked it and left. 

I texted my landlord and she said she is the only one with the key and doesn’t give it out. She didn’t have any appointments scheduled for my unit and I wasn’t provided a notice of anyone entering. Again, I am a young woman in my twenties and I live alone. I feel so grossed out not knowing who locked my door. I take my dog almost everywhere with me and the only reason I did not was because my hands were full and I didn’t want to walk back up to get him. Had I taken my dog, that person would’ve been free to go through my apartment. Also what if I didn’t have my keys? I would have been locked out and my dog locked in. 

The whole thing is weird and upsetting to me because I can’t wrap my brain around how this happened. I promise I am not crazy and I did not lock my bolt before I left. I purposefully left it unlocked. I ordered a camera. But I can’t figure out how or who locked my door. I don’t see it being a previous tenant because how would they get through the gate?! The gate has updated information on the new resident (me) and the previous resident would be removed from the list. I called the gatehouse and left a voicemail asking to be called back. I want to know if anyone was granted access to come in under my unit number. Or if management came in the neighborhood today. 

I am a little frightened. I feel safe because my dog sleeps across me. I have a hammer on my side table and my entire kitchen knife set in here as well. This makes no sense to me.
