[PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1510lq9/working_at_a_haunted_hotel_isnt_as_bad_as_people/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=1)

The Harry Potter books, despite the massive plotholes, horrible world building and other things That rage on too long for me to mention, were a big part of my life growing up, however not because of the magic school and the whole chosen one clich√©

I liked them because of the interactions with the ghosts, though limited to few interactions, I loved the idea of being able to communicate with those that came before us, and learn things about the past from those that experienced it first hand

Peeves was always my favorite, as when I was younger I was a jokester too, however I couldn't disappear at a whim, so getting caught one to many times distinguished that flame, but my love of Ghosts never really died out

Which is probably the biggest reason for why I work at a haunted Hotel


Now don't get me wrong, ghost aren't the only supernatural beings we get at the hotel, They just end up being the most common, turnsbout even in death, everyone needs a vacation 

For some like Miss Sylvia, who might I add is very happy that so many people were happy to hear how well she's been, are permanent residents at the hotel, for Miss Sylvia's case it's because not only did she somehow wake up with a small fortune in ghostly money but she is still, at least in appearance, a 16 year old Girl, so it didn't take me and my other coworkers much to convince The Owner to let her stay. Me and Miss Sylvia actually have movie nights every Friday night, it's very fun

Now unfortunately the point of this update isn't to talk about how wonderful Miss Sylvia is, no, today I'm here to tell you a story about our resistant poltergeist, Dave

Yes, he does go by Dave, however me and my coworkers call him Davey, due to him sharing a name with one of said coworkers

Now, I'm using Harry Potter to explain this, like I did with the money, but Davey is like Peeves in the Harry Potter books, who unfortunately never got a movie version, which is a shame but I digress

Davey mostly does silly little April fools jokes, nothing too harmful, just a whoopee cushion here, a flower that sprays water there, maybe even one of those little hand devices that give one a little shock, he saves that one for me and my other coworkers

We can never figure out where he gets the items, and The Owner has tried many times confiscating them, but Davey seems to have an unlimited amount, which, as one would expect, ends up with all the workers making up absurd theories about how he got them, the most popular being he's somehow able to get into The Owners office to get the items back, which is the most realistic one, yet the most absurd

No one has gone into The Owners office without his permission and exit unscathed

The first time I met Davey, I was just starting to understand what the job offer meant by haunted Hotel

I had initially thought it was a normal hotel with a ghost story around it, but when the owner had let me in I never expected to be met face to face with a pluage doctor mask

I believed that it was just a costume at first, and tried not to think of it too much, but as I made my way to The Owner's office and saw more and more supernatural entities, such as demons, Skeletons without the meat and spaghetti monster that is the human nervous system, and even a werewolf, I had slowly figured out what Haunted meant, and once being calm and collected I had turned into a mess or jitters and anxiety 

That's when I heard it, a voice I didn't think I would end up remembering 

"Hey there, Kiddo, you seem tense," the voice had spoke, causing me to turn around sheepishly with a smile

"Oh, do I? I'm trying not to be, I have a job interview," However my voice trailed off slightly as I had turned around to see a ghost standing in front of me

He was short, around 5'3 and that the body of The Penguin from DC comics, yet he seemed much to friendly to be the runner of a mob and one of gothems greatest criminals

"Ah so you're the new recruit everyones been buzzing about!" He exclaimed, a smile on his face, if it wasn't for his semi-translusent body, I bet the light from the ceiling would've sparkled off his teeth like you'd see in those old out of date ads, Or in Home alone with the gold tooth 

"Hopefully not enough for this to become a beehive instead of a hotel," I joked, hoping that bad dad jokes would help calm my nerves, and the ghost man in front of me let out a laugh, one you'd expect Santa to make while his stomach became jelly

"You're a hoot kid, I think you're gonna love working here," He said, holding his hand out, which I instinctively took to shake his hand, only to feel a small sharp ping in my hand, which caused the ghost to laugh some more before the door to the office opened

"Davey, I do hope you're not scaring away future employees again," a tall man had said, looking down at the ghost

"No sir, owner man, I think this one's a keeper," The ghost, Who's name I then learnt to be Davey, spoke, and I could feel him put his hands on my arms and give me a gentle affirming shake, like the ones dad's would give when they're child was nervous about hitting a baseball

"Well thank you for the feedback, Davey, but I now have to conduct an interview of my own," The owner had said, his hands now resting on my shoulder and gently guiding me into his office

I appeared to have Been the only person that applied for the job and got a go ahead to The Owner about bringing me on the team, and now here I am, a yeah and 2 months later, still working at the same job, still mistaking Davey for the Penguin every now and then, and always careful about whats in his hand

Now that shall be all for today, I do apologize for such a late update, unfortunately Life got in the way with school starting up once more and having to take less hours at the hotel, which, surprisingly, hasn't changed my pay, but I am not complaining

Hope everyone has a wonderful night, Miss Sylvia wishes everyone the best of dreams, filled with candy like SpongeBob dream in the sponge out of water movie

Goodnight everyone
