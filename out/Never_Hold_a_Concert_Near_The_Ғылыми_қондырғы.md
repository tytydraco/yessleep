There’s three knock-off Red Bulls coursing through my veins and I’m running on four hours of sleep. I try to meditate in the back of the taxi but the road to the warehouse is as jittery as my psyche. It’s been a long week, hell, with all the planning involved it’s been a long year. I am beyond exhausted and in desperate need of a vacation, but I content myself with the fact that everything that could have gone wrong has already gone wrong.

There are no more problems to solve.

‘There’s a problem,’ Batima says, the moment I step out of the taxi. She’s dyed her hair green overnight and rotated out her usual piercings but she’s still wearing her dark blue bomber jacket that’s too big for her.

‘Where’s the band?’ I ask. ‘Is Johnny making problems again?’

‘Johnny and the rest of the fellas are pre-gaming at the hotel,’ she says, paying more attention to the cigarette she’s rolling than to me. ‘They refuse to come for sound check unless the power is on.’

‘The power is out?!’

‘That’s the problem.’ A saber of surgical steel dangles from her lower lip as she licks her cigarette shut. ‘Lights were flickering in the morning. By the time the techies finished setting up the stage the whole building was without power.’

Batima lights her cigarette in the most casual way possible as my heart sinks deep into my stomach. The entire show has been cursed. Getting a permit to even put on the concert required enough bribes to make even the most creative accountant blush. There’s been two date-changes, three venue changes and now, on the day that I’ve worked so goddamn hard for, there’s no power.

‘We have to call someone,’ I say, once feeling returns to my face. ‘If there’s no power there’s no show. We’re opening up ourselves to massive liabilities. We have to call someone!’

‘I already did,’ Batima says, puffing on her smoke. She points over her shoulder to a chubby faced man pacing back and forth through a hands-free phone call. ‘Best electrician money can buy around here. There’s another problem though. Our expensive friend here needs access to the basement. The hatch to the basement is locked.’

‘Can’t we pry it open?’

‘Techies tried, no dice. One suggested dynamite, but that probably wouldn’t cover our safety deposit. We need the keys.’

‘And the keys are…?’ I sniff at the air. I assure myself I’m not having a stroke.

‘Not here. Owner isn’t picking up. Googled around, found his assistants number. Apparently, the boss man is overseas till the 23rd. No way to retrieve the keys until then.’ She takes another long puff. ‘Luckily, I managed to —’

‘Are you kidding me right now?’ I yell, the moment I recognize the smell. ‘Doors open in six hours and there’s no power in the building. I need you sober right now!’

‘Chill,’ she says, taking another puff. ‘It’s just a bit of hash. Keeps me focused.’

She offers me her joint. I don’t dignify the question with a response. Instead, I tell her that the music industry is an industry based on reputation and she’s not making a good name for herself at the moment.

‘Oh, I’m sure you’ll have plenty of nice things to say about me by tomorrow.’ Aside from the saber, there’s no malice in her smile. ‘Anywho,’ she says, ‘Found the owner’s brother. Gave him a call. Turns out he has a spare set of keys. Wasn’t happy to make the trip, but hey-look-over-there, here he comes!’

A silver Audi 80 bounces up the road and stops a couple paces from us. Batima slips the joint in my hand and goes over to speak to its driver. Without getting out of the car, the driver passes the keys over to Batima. He handles them between his thumb and pointer finger as if they were toxic. I don’t understand a word that they’re saying to each other, but it seems like the man is pleading with Batima. As desperate as his face seems she simply shrugs and smiles and waves goodbye.

‘What did he say?’ I ask, after she replaces the joint in my hand with the keychain.

‘That he doesn’t want the keys back. We can just leave them with his brother. Says that we shouldn’t be having any concerts over here because the basement of the warehouse used to be connected to the Ғылыми қондырғы.’

Even hearing the name is hard on the ears. I make no effort to pronounce it. ‘The what?’ I ask.

‘The Ғылыми қондырғы. Used to be an old secret research facility that’s apparently haunted and a source of horrible dark science. Kids story. That guy is too old to believe in that nonsense. So are we.’

There’s no place I’d rather be than back in Sydney. For a moment I disassociate and imagine what I’d be up to if I didn’t sign up to handle a rock show in the middle of nowhere. With the time difference, I’d be about to clock out. Maybe I’d be planning on heading out for drinks to see some obscure indie band that didn’t have an agent yet.

‘Hate to burst your bubble,’ my local contact says, stubbing out her joint, ‘but doors open in six hours and there’s no power in the building. Maybe we should get a move on.’ With a wave she summons the electrician and we head to the basement hatch. On the way we relieve the security guys of their flashlights.

The one I get barely works.

Dark red banners cover the broken windows of the warehouse and expensive multi-colored lights hang from the rusted walkway. Even though it’s a warm day outside, the innards of the warehouse carry a chill.

The basement is significantly colder.

The ladder is barely deep enough to reach the floor. We stand on packed earth and around us sit heaps of scrap metal and smashed up crates. From the small rays of light we have, the place looks completely abandoned. Musk and rot and dust fill the air as we walk.

I’m beyond uncomfortable, but the chubby cheeked electrician seems to be in great spirits. Him and Batima chat as we walk through the decrepit innards of the basement. I don’t understand the language that they speak, but the tone of the chat reminds me of every friendly plumber I’ve ever met. The electrician seems in good spirits but with one word Batima takes all the cheer from his voice:

Ғылыми қондырғы.

The moment Batima pronounces that discomforting sound the electrician stops so fast I end up bumping into him. He doesn’t apologize or move an inch. Finally, with his flashlight pointed square at Batima’s face he repeats the name in a whisper. She nods and smiles and laughs a little, but no sounds come from the man. He just keeps on walking.

‘Woof, looks like he believes in children’s stories as well,’ Batima says, as we walk through the dark basement. ‘Ah well, as long as he can fix the power it doesn’t matter.’

‘We need to make sure to lock the hatch when we’re done here,’ I say, passing my flashlight over the heaps of lawsuits disguised as scrap metal. ‘Someone could get seriously hurt here.’

The electrician’s steps are much less sure after Batima utters the unspeakable words, but he keeps moving. From the open hall of broken machines, we walk down into a set of tight hallways. With nothing deafening our footsteps, the echo bounces around the halls as if there were dozens of us.

The electrician grumbles something, all the cheeriness he once possessed has dissipated.

‘He says we’re close to the fusebox, or whatever it’s called in English,’ Batima translates.

‘Good,’ I say. My flashlight flickers between low power and death, but I don’t make much of it. In the darkness of the warehouse, I find my mind drifting back home. No matter how it all ends, I tell myself, I’ll be on a plane back in two days’ time.

The electrician suddenly stops once more. I bump into him again. He says something, but I don’t understand. I turn around to ask Batima for a translation but she’s nowhere to be found. I yell her name but all that comes back is an echo.

Batima’s absence makes the flashlight in the man’s hands tremble, but he keeps talking. He keeps saying that terrible name over and over again.

Something skitters in the darkness. I call out for Batima again, but the electrician shushes me. He lowers his flashlight. Things continue to scutter around in the darkness. The longer I look into the black of the basement, however, the more I notice a faint blue light. Seemingly, the electrician notices it too.

A pale blue light, shifting in the darkness like a levitating snake. It moves closer to us. Slowly and with shaking hands, the electrician lifts his flashlight.

*RREEEEE!!!*

A rat is the size of a cocker spaniel. The moment the flashlight illuminates it, the vermin rushes past us. It bumps into the electrician. He lets out a high-pitched yelp. The rat scurries down towards the hallways we came from, but the patter of its feet is replaced by its kin.

From beyond our small island of light, flickers of blue rise in the darkness.

The electrician is heavy set, but he isn’t in the midst of a sleep deprived caffeine crash. As we run through the hallways he outpaces me and I am left with my flickering flashlight.

Out in the darkness more pale blue tails emerge. As I sprint, I struggle not to step on any of the mangy beasts that run by my feet. I do not question what they are. I do not question where they came from — all I want is to be back on the surface safe and sound.

Past my mad panic, however, I smell something.

I smell hash.

From the corner of my eye, I see a concentration of blue light. At its center floats a burning ember. I see Batima. She stands with her hand-rolled cigarette surrounded by the incomprehensible vermin. For a moment my panic clears and I call out her name, yet before the second syllable of her name leaves my lips another wave of unmanageable terror washes over me.

One of the furry beasts rushes past my leg. A jolt of energy shoots through me. It feels like I’ve pressed my entire lower body against an electric fence. I fear for Batima’s safety, but I fear for my own safety so much more. I scream and run and, eventually, come crashing into the ladder on the island of light.

By the time I pull myself to the top rung, I start to feel faint. My muscles spasm without rhyme or reason and my mouth refuses to form words. The techies in the warehouse surround me with looks of curiosity and fear. Someone calls for a medic, but the rest of their words I do not understand.

I keep trying to mouth Batima’s name, to make someone aware that she is still trapped in that hellish place, but my lips turn completely numb.

Soon enough, however, my attempts to summon a rescue party become moot. Batima, ill-fitting bomber jacket and all, joins the crowd gathered around me. I manage to regain control of my tongue. I beg her to warn everyone about the giant electric rats and to call the police and an ambulance and the military. When my panicked rambling dies down, the eyes of the crowd shift over to Batima for a translation.

She speaks slowly and with a calmness that seems wholly inappropriate. With the final word of her translation, the crowd looks back to me and erupts in laughter.

‘What did you tell them?’ I cry.

‘I told them that there’s rats in the basement. And that they don’t have rats where you came from. They find it funny that you’re so scared of rats.’ She smiles at me as if we both didn’t just witness a nest of incomprehensible amalgamations in an old Soviet warehouse.

‘That’s not true! That’s not what I said! There’s—'

‘About five hours left until we open doors and the building has no power. Chill. One problem at a time. We don’t need the techies freaking out as well.’ She takes one last pull from her stubby smoke, wets her fingers, pinches it out and then chucks it in a nearby trashcan.

The medic that is brought also doesn’t speak English. With Batima’s translation I answer questions about my name, the date and where we are. Then he checks my pulse and blood pressure. I do not understand a word the medic says, but his tone is far from optimistic.

‘Apparently you should go to a hospital,’ Batima says after the diagnosis is delivered. ‘At risk of a heart attack, or something like that.’

‘I can’t just leave,’ I say. ‘There’s a concert.’

‘Yeah, I heard,’ she says, locking the basement hatch. ‘How about we get you some fresh air? You reckon you can climb up some stairs?’

‘Stairs?’ I ask.

‘The roof is about as private as this place is gonna get.’

There’s already a line of a couple dozen early birds in front of the warehouse. No outside alcohol is allowed at the event, but bottles are liberally moving through the queue to utter apathy from the hired security. Seeing the crowd slowly grow makes my chest ache worse than the climb up the stairs.

‘The electrician isn’t coming back,’ Batima says, shutting the door to the roof. ‘Called the guy while you were checked out. Offered double rate, triple rate — no dice. Guy ain’t coming back on account of the whole Ғылыми қондырғы thing.’

The name makes me clench my teeth. ‘What do we do?’ I ask, once feeling returns to my jaw.

‘Well, let’s tackle this one problem at a time.’ She places one boot on the edge of the roof and looks out into the distance like an Asian Captain Morgan. ‘We can probably get the opening band to play a set outside. Techies are basically done inside as much as I gather. Shouldn’t be too much of a hassle to throw together a stage. I’ll make some calls. Maybe we can scrounge up some generators for the amps.’

‘Johnny isn’t going to play a show on generators.’

‘Oh, I know that,’ Batima says, patting the belly of her jacket. ‘One problem at a time, remember? Getting the opener out gives us a bit of leeway.’

‘To do what? Call an exterminator?’

‘Don’t be heartless,’ she says. ‘Those things down there are harmless. Plus, killing them doesn’t solve our no electricity problem.’

‘Harmless?! One of them electrocuted me!’

‘Probably because you scared it. They’re harmless if they’re calm. Hash chills them out.’

‘Hash chills them out?!’

She nods. ‘Don’t freak out now,’ Batima says, grabbing the zip of her jacket.

She unzips it.

I freak out.

The giant rat creatures were discomforting enough in the darkness, but seeing one in broad daylight sends a sharp sting through my chest and makes my knees weak. The moment my eyes meet the beast, it furls its flat mouth to reveal a row of uneven yellow teeth. When Batima places the creature on the floor it backs up as far away from me as it can. I too, stumble to the edge of the roof.

‘You fed it hash?!’

‘I’m not the one who got electrocuted,’ she says. The rat creature wags its tail back and forth like an angry metronome. Foam gathers at the edge of its lips. I feel stands of my hair being pulled towards the sky. ‘Shhh,’ Batima hisses at the creature, throwing a thumb sized ball of wax at its paws. The strange animal grabs the waxy ball, raises to its hind legs and consumes its treat in two swift bites.

‘See? It works.’

The giant rat skitters over to Batima and takes rest at her feet. Even in its docile state, looking at the freak of nature makes me uncomfortable in my own skin. I take a seat on the edge of the roof.

‘Don’t jump,’ she says, smiling. ‘I think I know how to solve the power problem.’

‘How?’ I ask.

Batima scoops up the rat creature and zips up her bomber jacket once more. ‘Probably shouldn’t tell you,’ she says, after a moment of thought. ‘Liabilities and all.’

‘Are you going to do something illegal?’

Batima doesn’t respond. She just smiles. She just smiles and produces a rolled cigarette from her pocket and hands it to me. I refuse it, but she insists. Apparently, I look like I could use a bit of sedation.

As Batima goes downstairs she asks me if she has my approval for some additional spending. I again ask her if she’s planning on doing anything illegal and in response she just smiles and repeats her question once more.

I say okay. It’s not like I have a choice.

The crowd below grows with each minute. Near the front of the queue two young guys have a loud disagreement. Before a proper fight breaks out security manages to get them apart.

I try giving Johnny a call. Twice, he doesn’t pick up. The third attempt isn’t the charm. Johnny does pick up, but he refuses to even consider an outdoor show. He’s a rockstar, he says, and rockstars don’t run on generators. When he hangs up on me my migraine dies down somewhat, but the ache in my chest doesn’t.

The roof is about as comfortable as a mattress of sandpaper but looking up at the blue sky above gives me some semblance of calm. The noise of a gathering crowd below is impossible to ignore, but what’s only heard hurts the heart less than what is seen. I stare up at the sky and try to propel myself through time until all my problems are resolved. I convince myself I just want everything to be done with, yet as the sky grows redder in the sunset my chest feels tighter and tighter.

By the time I manage to pull myself up there’s a makeshift stage. Ever so faintly, I can hear opening band play. They’re good. Lots of heart. They’re good, but they don’t have an amp.

The crowd is huge. With the queue long collapsed the people flood past the entryway of the warehouse and into the trees beyond. They’re loud, yet seem to be in good spirits. Security seems to have everything under control but I fear what the sunset will bring.

For a moment I consider calling Batima to check on her progress, but my hands grow clammy the moment I fish out my phone. I consider calling an ambulance, but instead I lie back down on the concrete.

The sunset above is beautiful, but it doesn’t calm my heart. With the world around me descending into darkness I grab the spliff Batima left behind. I try to take a drag of some of her calmness and, for a while it works.

For a while I look up at the stars and feel a cosmic sense of tranquility. The crowd below sings a song in unison and though I don’t understand the words I feel closer to them. For a while the hash works, but one look into the warehouse sends me crashing back into a nervous breakdown.

The hall is in complete darkness. Only a trio of flashlights moves through the abyss. Like searchlights scanning for prisoners, the beams float around the warehouse. One of them passes by the hatch to the basement.

It’s unlocked.

I think about the rats. At first, I think about the possibility of someone getting zapped or bit by them and my bosses getting sued. At first, I think about those abnormal creatures as a potential legal problem, but quickly I become concerned with their mere existence. I become concerned with how these amalgamations of nature came to be and what horrid mind is responsible for them. I become concerned with the Ғылыми қондырғы and I grow faint.

The shock I was delivered in the bowels of the warehouse shoots through me once more and drives out my consciousness.

I awake to a rumbling beneath my palms.

For a moment, my imagination turns the gravel to fur. For a moment, I fear I am being carried away to the depths of the Ғылыми қондырғы by the monstrous electric rats. But then, I hear music.

Johnny sounds far from sober, but he’s in his element. The music is amped up so loud I can feel it in my bones. Down below, someone vomits in the glow of a street lamp. Through the windows of the warehouse, there’s a fantastic show.

Flashing lights, smoke machines and loud, loud, amps. The power is back and the crowd below seems to be having a blast. I still get dizzy when I climb to my feet, but the music frees me of all heartache. I go looking for Batima.

She stands on one of the rusty walkways overlooking the concert, tapping her fingers on the bar to the rhythm. When I see her, Batima flashes me a big thumbs up. I try to find out how she got the power on but the music is far too loud. It’s a cold night, but the warehouse is so packed it feels like we’re suspended above a hot spring.

Johnny goes in for an encore, but after the final official song of the show Batima motions up towards the roof. The air outside is colder, but considerably fresher. ‘I trust you’ll have plenty of nice things to say about me by tomorrow. I hear this industry is based on reputation.’

I assure her that she will get whatever reference letter she desires. I apologize for anything unpleasant I might have said to Batima over the past couple of months, thank her and beg her for an explanation.

How did she get the power on?

‘Used the zap-rats,’ she says, pointing towards the general direction of the basement hatch.

‘How?’

‘Am I meant to tell you? What if I did something illegal? Aren’t there like, liabilities and stuff?’

‘Did you do something illegal?’ I ask, my chest growing numb again.

She shrugs. ‘Bought a bunch of hash.’

‘You fed those things hash?’

‘Yeah,’ she says, taking out her phone. ‘They’re pretty friendly when they’re chilled out. Wanna see?’

I don’t hesitate asking to be shown the video. I do not, for a moment, consider whether I wish to see more of the incomprehensible. As I watch, my heart grows weary once more.

At first, all I see is familiar blue lights floating in the darkness — the tails of those beasts. The lights grow more numerous and start to flail. Whenever they touch, sparks light up the darkness. The creatures all gather together, their tails glowing brighter and wagging like horrid lit up metronomes.

An array of green and red lights light up in the darkness and then the whole basement is bathed in flickering fluorescence. I see the rat creatures clearly. Their mangy fur, their horrid teeth, their giant eyes — I see them for only a second before I am forced to look away.

‘Weird, huh?’ she asks, as my knees grow weak from the horror. ‘Guess the Ғылыми қондырғы is real after all.’

She hands me another hand-rolled cigarette and I don’t refuse [it](https://www.reddit.com/r/MJLPresents/comments/q2qjz1/%D2%93%D1%8B%D0%BB%D1%8B%D0%BC%D0%B8_%D2%9B%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%8B%D1%80%D2%93%D1%8B/).
