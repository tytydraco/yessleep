The following post is a full, unedited, transcription of my field diary, the only surviving documentation and evidence I have of what happened to the NMBU expedition team. The authorities dismissed my report, but the truth needs to be exposed. The truth about... ***The Tooth Fairies***...



Entry 1: 

17th of July 2025. NMBU Campus.

Subject: Field Expedition, Norwegian Reindeer.



This log serves as a formal introduction and record of my field research as part of my master's thesis on population dynamics. 

My name is Eleanor Vance, and I am a graduate exchange student from the University of Bristol, UK, taking part in a field expedition and population survey with the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. 

This expedition was sponsored and supplied by an undisclosed benefactor whose primary objective was conducting an in depth population survey of the wild reindeer subspecies, "*Rangifer Tarandus Fjelenis*", in the remote highlands of Hjølmo, Norway. My work is being conducted in tandem with five other NMBU students:

* Sven Bjornsson, our field leader specializing in survival studies.
* Astrid Harker, a seasoned field researcher with a minor in engineering and our primary technician. 
* Freja Harker, Astrid's sister, our folklorist and cultural liaison.
* Lars Kirk, our resident genetics expert. 
* Snorri Davids, our tenured professor tasked with acoustic data collection. 

We are currently departing from the NMBU campus on July 17th**,** 2025, at approximately 09:15am. The initial leg of the journey by vehicle is projected to conclude near an isolated, unnamed settlement by nightfall, where we will stop for a final resupply and respite. This will be followed by a multi-hour hike to the designated campsite in the *Hjølmo* region. All equipment, supplies, and personnel are accounted for and secured. 

We remain optimistic regarding the potential data yield in this pristine section of the Norwegian highlands.

  
  
Entry 2:

17th of July 2025. En Route to Village. 

Subject: Travel Log and Team Dynamics.



The drive is proving grueling. With the landscape transitioning from busy highways, managed forests and into genuinely wild, mountainous terrain. We've been forced to take old rural roads and are proceeding slowly into an old, single lane logging road. 

The team dynamics are, predictably, establishing themselves. The long hours cramped in the vehicle are proving... illuminating. 

Lars and Freja have been engaged in a sustained, if albeit low-level, skirmish regarding the effects of local superstitions on native animal populations and the serious effects on conservation efforts. Lars firmly believes that any consideration of "mythology" is a waste of empirical time, whereas Freja is steadfast that local knowledge often holds shreds of truth that can enlighten us as to the mysterious loss of several large herds that have been growing in number over the past decades.

"Perhaps there's a pattern here that we, as modern people, have not been able to witness over sustained time frames, that these legends might have" she states. 

I found Freja's perspective more academically sound, though Lars’ skepticism proves a necessary component to the scientific method. 

Sven and Astrid have kept to the logistical checklist, discussing sensor deployment and projected fuel consumption. Their practical focus provides a necessary counterbalance to the theoretical debates, though the efficiency of their cooperation does appear to extend slightly beyond the professional boundary.

Professor Davids has found himself content with consuming the majority of the travel snacks we and the team brought with us and has become a point of communal grievance. His volume, even when speaking, is excessive and has continued even as he sleeps. His snoring has raised concerns of procuring ear plugs at the nearest rest stop if we have any hopes at sleeping while out in the field. A necessary precaution given our close quarters of the tent we will reside in for the length of our stay. 

We are entering our last hours of driving as we approach the village. The air is noticeably colder as we gain altitude. The sharp scent of damp earth and pine proves a comfort. The remoteness of this location, which proved a point of concern for my peers, I think, proves precisely what we require for an undisturbed population study. 



Entry 3:

17th of July 2025. Village Mountain Settlement. 

Subject: Respite in Village.



We arrived in the village that evening with the help of an old rustic map given to us by the benefactor. However, as stated previously, the village was unnamed. As we arrived there stood an old, dilapidated sign outside the village that we made out to read: "Betale Tannfee"  to which Freja translated: "pay the tooth fee". The professor then replied in jest: 

"Perhaps we call it the *tooth fairy* village then, eh?" 

Which caused us all to return a strained chuckle given the grimness of the village’s outward appearance. 

The village was strikingly remote, nestled deep in a valley at the base of the mountains. It appeared devoid of any modern infrastructure, consisting solely of buildings constructed from eroded stone and half-rotted lumber. We did, however, notice a peculiar, small dentist's office near the village center, with a queue of grim-faced people leading to the cobblestone street.

Lars, ever the aggressive rationalist, immediately posited that the local water was likely heavily treated with fluoride. He then looked pointedly at my mouth, remarking that this, compounded with large quantities of tea, a noted British staple that also contains fluoride, could lead to pervasive tooth decay, especially in older rural communities.

I met his assumption with skepticism, finding his reasoning irrelevant given the village's obvious lack of any modern water treatment plant. Before I could retort however, Lars directed my attention away to a group of villagers behind me, all of varying ages, who were missing most, if not all of their teeth. Lars merely smirked, as if his crude theory had been instantly validated by this strange coincidence. Ultimately, we suppressed the eerie feeling and disregarded the odd correlation as we settled into an old barn prepared for our temporary rest.

Despite the logistical success of reaching our first waypoint, the mood remained distinctly unsettled throughout the evening. The silence here is unnerving and seemed only punctuated by the distant, rhythmic clang of something metallic from the direction of the dentist's office. Sven, in an apparent attempt to lighten the tension, spent the majority of the evening focused on Astrid, discussing the final calibration of the geo-locators, which did little to improve the already strained dynamic with Freja. Though the barn was warm, I think we all found sleep difficult, constantly aware of the unblinking remoteness of this valley.



Entry 4:

18th of July 2025. Village Barn.

Subject: Preparation for Departure.



We woke up early that morning in preparation for the long hike we had planned to the campsite. Sven reminded us that it would be through mountainous terrain and we should keep our bags light, save our necessary equipment and food rations, as the extra weight may prove a liability as we ascend in altitude. This later proved humbling advice. 

As we departed an old man from the village caught up with our group to present us with a necklace made of several animal teeth and assorted bones. He demanded we take it with us, shoving it into my chest assuring it was for good luck. Lars seemed distressed by this but Freja interjected that it would be rude to ignore the superstitions of the villagers that had been so hospitable to us thus far. We all gave the professor an anticipatory stare. The professor politely agreed and we all let out a collective sigh of relief as the man turned back to the village. 

Freja went on to say that there was a legend she knew where vikings had worn similar necklaces made of children's teeth for good luck when travelling. It was said that it would ward off evil spirits. A "tannfee" or a  "tooth fee" she called it, would act as a payment to the spirits and be on their way. This likely explained the sign we saw as we entered town. She continued that whatever had been causing the rapid tooth decay in the area might have been interpreted with local superstitions by the villagers, and that they paid us a great kindness by including us in their traditions.  

Davids stated he quite liked the macabre little necklace, but to avoid further disputes I should keep the necklace in my pocket. The brief exchange had soured the final moments of our respite. Lars' sudden, petulant fit had cast a palpable negativity over the group's morale, which was already in question after the strangeness of what we saw in the village. I could hear Lars' distant, agitated conversation with Sven ahead of me on the trail, while Freja seemed determined to ignore him, walking back to join Astrid. I secured the heavy, grim object in my pocket and focused my attention ahead, determined to regain a professional focus. The sun was setting, and the silence of the high trail brought no comfort to us as we continued to camp. 

The sunset was remarkably beautiful nevertheless.

  
  
Entry 5: 

18th of July 2025. Camp. 

Subject: Setting up Camp.



Along our hike we encountered a reindeer carcass beside the trail, indicating to us that reindeer were in fact in the area but of note however, the carcass' antlers had been gnawed on. Stranger still, the bones were displaced while the flesh remained. Lars surmised this had to be the work of wolves in the area. The wolves likely taking the bones for their calcium content after having their fill of meat. Notwithstanding, it was still a peculiar sight even by Lars’ rationale. 

After an arduous hike through extremely rough mountainous terrain, we arrived at the proposed campsite just before dusk. Our field leader Sven announced that we had just enough time to pitch our tents and prepare food. He determined that setting up any equipment or beginning data collection would be impossible, as the temperature at this altitude drops well below freezing, even during the summer months.

Our tent was a point of contention among the group for a time, causing a litany of arguments before Sven stepped in and set up the tent in a fraction of the time it even took Astrid and Lars collectively to read, and argue over, its instruction manual. 

Freja and Professor Davids went on to set up our dining situation for the night consisting of hot dogs and s'mores.

"An American camping classic!" Freja joked.

Unsurprisingly, Lars made us all aware of the fact that the professor had evidently eaten all the graham crackers on the car ride up to the village, leaving us with only the option to roast marshmallows between two pieces of chocolate. We all found Lars' frustration rather amusing admittedly.  

The relaxed atmosphere of the campfire did little to thaw the underlying tensions. While preparing the meal, Sven’s attention was almost entirely monopolized by Astrid, who clearly enjoyed his focused expertise and easy banter. Freja, meanwhile, gave the pair a strained glare. I found myself relegated to the periphery, a common position for an exchange student I’ve noticed. 

Lars, though he was the genesis of the night’s meager entertainment, was nonetheless a perpetual irritant. I noted how easily his focus shifted from scientific observation to petty grievance, a temperament that made him entirely unsuited for prolonged, close-quarters fieldwork.



Entry 6:

18th of July 2025. Camp.

Subject: Concerns of Merriment.



Tensions eventually started to ease as we sat around the fire. Lars had sequestered himself to the tent to entertain his "literary pursuits" which came to no surprise to anyone, but actually a relief. Sven wandered the outskirts of the camp  as he had suspicion to believe that wolverines may be roaming in the area. This fact startled Astrid, but was met with reassurance from Sven that so long as we didn't leave any food out while we slept that we shouldn't be disturbed. His patrol was merely a precaution.

I went on to tease Astrid about how brown bear were also local to the area, and were known predators to the reindeer that we were out here to survey. I joked how that might be the cause of the reindeer carcass we saw as we approached camp. This was met with dismay from Astrid and  collective amusement from the rest of the group. Davids then reached in the cooler behind him and pulled out one of many six packs of a Norwegian lager he had stowed away. The professor urged Astrid to take one to calm her nerves, to which she sheepishly agreed and took an amusing, strained sip through her teeth. 

Lars remained confined to the tent lamenting that bringing alcohol on a research trip was irresponsible, and could get the professor in legal trouble. Davids reminded him of his tenure at NMBU teasing: 

"Sounds like he needs two!" 

Which was met with a unanimous bout of laughter and a strained glare from Lars. Lars, thankfully, stayed inside the tent and continued with his reading, saving us from him souring the mood. 

Between the five of us we drank  almost the entirety of the lager while we told more stories around the campfire. Even Sven, after some initial reluctance, succumbed to peer pressure and joined us in social lubrication. Sven briefly returned to his security duties, but the alcohol had blurred his usual meticulousness.

Astrid, clearly affected by the alcohol, grew quiet and rested her head on her knees, while Freja, now animated and chatty, made a noticeable effort to engage Sven in a deep, rambling conversation, dominating his attention completely. After some more hours, we all, one-by-one, retreated to the tent for the night. Sven and Davids requested that they remain by the fire for a time to keep watch on the embers. Between the two of them they likely drank a pack, if not two, each, and likely wished to continue uninterrupted. 



Entry 7: 

***INCIDENT REPORT***

A horrible tragedy has happened in the night and I will do my best to recount it, but I, as well as the rest of the group, remain deeply shaken up by what we witnessed:

Sometime in the night, I was first roused by Professor Davids' snoring, a sound familiar to all of us, given that we were all wearing earplugs. Davids had evidently remained in his camping chair unaccompanied. 

I'd fallen back asleep, only to be roused again moments later by the startling thud of his chair hitting the ground. Initially I dismissed this as a drunken stumble and attempted to lull myself back to sleep.

The sound that followed however, was urgent: someone frantically attempting to tear open the tent. Shaken fully awake by this intrusion, 

I rose to my feet and unzipped the tent to investigate. What I saw next shook me to my core.

Illuminated only by a faint blue glow emanating from his mouth, Davids was clawing frantically at his own face. I snatched the torchlight, and when the beam hit his head, I saw the source of his agony was a rodent-like creature that had been lodged deep in his mouth. 

His pleas for help were muffled by the circumference of the animal filling his mouth and the blood filling his airways. I screamed, alerting the rest of the party and I reached for the animal's bloodied, hairless, leathery tail, bracing myself against Davids' chest, and attempted to pull the vermin free. 

The creature was held steadfast by backwards-facing spines that had dug deep into the roof of the professor's mouth behind his front teeth. Choked by the blood and viscera pooling around the creature and out of his mouth, Davids attempted to scream again, but all that escaped was a pained, gurgling murmur.

As the group looked on in horror, I continued trying to pry the vermin out from between the professor's jaws. Sven rose quickly to help, wielding a large bowie knife. He slipped the blade in between Davids' cheek and the creature's flank, attempting to wedge the beast out.

During the struggle, we could hear the creature gnawing at the professor's teeth. The sound of bone scraping on enamel beneath Davids' muffled screams began fading into gurgled pleas. The professor was actively gulping his own blood in a desperate, vain attempt to keep his lungs clear. The beast refused to be dislodged from the professor's mouth and sunk its spines deeper. 

Davids had thankfully lost consciousness thereafter as we had no other choice than to begin wrenching at the professor’s jaw to open it wider, dislocating it entirely with a sickening, fleshy, crunch. Sven, realizing immediate extraction was the only option, began cutting away at the professor's cheek tissue. As blood poured from his head, the sickening truth was revealed. The beast had removed all of his back teeth, including his molars, leaving the jaw bone exposed by gnarled gums.

Sven finally grabbed the creature by the tail and held it aloft. Its cheeks were stuffed full, and it squirmed violently, tearing itself free of his grasp. The vermin quickly scrambled up Sven's arm toward his face, lunging for his mouth. As it chewed frantically at his front teeth with a spine-chilling scraping sound, Sven, writhing in agony, thrust his knife between the creature's gnashing incisors. 

This brief distraction allowed Astrid to grab a pillowcase and quickly enshroud the beast. Lars then tipped the cooler, scattering its contents across the floor of the tent, and urged Sven to throw the creature inside.

Sven cast the wretched thing into the cooler and slammed the lid shut. We stared in astonished silence, trying to comprehend the nature of this abominable thing. We stood arguing for a time, lamenting the loss of our professor, before Sven took command.

Sven's voice cut through the panicked noise, suddenly possessing an authority none of us had heard before. He demanded that, in spite of the horrifying tragedy, we needed to remain calm and regain a level head. He reassured us that separating us from the gruesome sight of the professor’s mangled body was the best immediate course of action to prevent further psychological collapse.

His word was firm: we would not move, we would not flee. We would rest, and in the morning, we would assess the captive specimen and decide how to continue the mission. His resolution, though terrifyingly misplaced, brought the immediate chaos to an abrupt, necessary halt.

He dragged the professor's body to the edge of camp and wrapped him in the tent's rain cover. Sven's decree was absolute: in spite of what happened, we needed to rest for the night and plan our next move with a level head. Debates erupted, but we ultimately acquiesced, returning to our cots to face the difficult lull back to sleep, preparing to face the full gravity of this tragedy when the sun rose.

  
  
Entry 8: 

19th of July 2025. Camp.

Subject: Post Incident.



Professor Davids has been declared deceased. 

The immediate cause of death is attributed to *Acute Hemorrhagic Shock* secondary to *severe oral and facial soft tissue trauma*. Contributing factors include *systemic stress, asphyxia risk from fluid aspiration*, and *complete skeletal tissue ablation within the oral cavity*.

Trauma to the oral and maxillary region is severe. Evidence suggests *targeted removal of teeth* rather than simple predation. 

Hypothesis: Target fixation suggests necessity for mineral acquisition (calcium/phosphate)

Sven recommended taking the professor’s body away from camp to avoid predators, while Astrid argued that we needed to immediately contact authorities and head back to the village. 

Sven reminded us that it was at least a six hours hike back to the village through mountainous terrain which could prove nearly impossible with a body in tow. Furthermore stating that we had no signal in which to communicate with any local rescue teams anyway. 

After lengthy discussion it was agreed that Sven and Freja would drag the professor's body approximately a kilometer from camp for burial.

Sven and Freja were gone for an unusual amount of time however. Stating that they had piled rocks on top of the professor’s gravesite dedicating a large, mock tomb stone with "Professor Snorri Davids" carved upon its face to honor him and mark a spot for officials to find later. Their demeanor was uncharacteristically positive. 

Discussions quickly erupted if the expedition should continue in absence of our professor. Astrid, distraught, lamented that a man's life was taken and that it was of the utmost importance to report this as quickly as possible. Lars, in contrast, made an argument that the creature that killed the professor last night was likely an undiscovered species of biofluorescent burrowing rodent unknown to science. Leaving now would throw away any chance we had studying the creature in its natural habitat. 

This was met with a collective disdain that was completely un-entertained by Astrid. She argued that we could pack the creature with us. This caused Lars to remind her that while we had a specimen, that without studying the creature in the field, we would lose out on any potential ecological or behavioral data that only this location provided. Further stating that if we left the area that we may never find this exact spot again, much less another specimen.

Lars continued this debate by arguing that describing a previously unknown species to science, especially one as unique as this, was far more important that the original purpose of the expedition. Lars pointed out the fact that we were already equipped for such an endeavor and that leaving now would simply: 

"be a waste of our tuition". 

While Astrid and Lars argued, Sven declared that such a divisive decision should only be made by a vote. Sven then grabbed a nearby empty beer can, cutting its top off with his knife and asked us to each write our vote on a slip of paper and place it in the can. Hesitant at first we eventually acquiesced and anxiously placed our votes.  He then counted the votes and promptly made a decision. 

The anonymous votes revealed three in favor of staying, and two in favor of leaving. With the decision finally made, the question finally arose as to where we should start with researching our new discovery.

Lars suggested we begin with describing the creature in the morning and begin a vivisection in the field the following night. We silently agreed and after a prolonged silence we returned to the tent at dusk to prepare for what tomorrow would hold. 

Morale is severely compromised.
