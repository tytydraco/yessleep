Hey guys, for context I am from India and we guys have arrange marriage here. There are two types of marriages in India- 1. Love marriage: You love a girl/boy and you both are in a relationship, now you both decide to get married to your own accord. 2. Arrange marriage: Your parents decide who you are going to marry and you meet a complete stranger just a few months before your already decided marriage, obviously you have some say in who that stranger would be and you do meet them a few times before getting engaged but you both don't have a relationship history. I am 28 years old and my parents forced me to get married, so I told them, they can arrange it for me. I am big into hip hop, so when the third beautiful girl that the matchmaker showed my mom turned out to be a DJ, I said yes almost immediately. She played in the local club and sometimes went on tour. I really liked that and decided to meet her. We hit it off almost immediately. She told me how she loves Eminem, and that guy really inspired me to get into rap music and eventually into hip hop, so I was really happy. We dated for a few months and were already engaged, so finally we got married. We had been living happily, she used to listen to all sorts of rap music that I played, but really enjoyed Eminem. I didn't think much about it but one day she said she wants to play the songs in the car, I was really happy to let her do it, getting the set of a professional hip hop DJ... hell yeah. But she played Eminem for the first 20 minutes, then it was Jack Harlow, then it was Iggy azalea, then YNG martyr, pretty soon I noticed a pattern. And then the most disturbing, she played Lil Dicky!! WTF! 

I am not racist and I listened to all of these guys regularly but I didn't have a fucking one hour set on just white rappers. She seemed racist to me. But then I just ignored it as we had reached our destination and on the way back I played a mixed hip hop playlist, it had Indian, Pakistani, Black and White rappers but she only got excited at the white rappers. 

  
I was weirded out but the craziest thing she ever did, was about to happen. Recently, the beef between Drake and Kendrick was going on and I asked her who she thought was the best. She said... "I don't know I mean Drake is pretty cool. I haven't heard Kendrick a lot but I really liked song Alright. All I know is Eminem is the GOAT.... Lil Dicky is the GOAT." I was shocked, scared and bewildered. I have left my house and I am trying to get a divorce as soon as possible. I hope this weird time passes. I don't want this going on around me. I haven't been able to sleep for the past 2 days. This is crazy. I need help.
