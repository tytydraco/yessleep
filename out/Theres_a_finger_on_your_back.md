I readjusted my headset for the umpteenth time before speaking calmly to my teammates.

"Ok guys, now we know what's next. We've seen it before. Same tactics, ok? I draw fire while you both flank."

"Roger that," came the first voice.

"Affirmative," another answered

Suddenly, I felt a sharp poke in my back, and my whole body froze. I dared not move. The hairs on my neck rose like the hackles on an attack dog as gunfire erupted through the headset. 

"What the hell are you doing??? Draw their fire, for fuck's sake! They've got us pinned down!!!" Voices cried through the ether.But I couldn't answer. I literally couldn't move my body, let alone my lips. I felt paralyzed from the neck down. A bead of sweat slowly snaked its way down from my scalp towards the drop-off point of my chin.And then, whoever was behind me began to speak softly, simultaneously making circles with the same protuberance first poked into me.

"There's a finger in your back, which finger... waaassssssss THAT?"I felt a sudden relief at the voice as the deep sharp poke returned sharply on the last word, straight into my shoulder blade.

"AMY!" I said angrily. "You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were with Mum. I'm playing a live game here, for God's sake!"

"HEY, DICKHEAD, STOP PLAYING DOLLY WITH YOUR SISTER AND JOIN THIS FIGHT. WE'RE LOSING HERE!" my friend barked through my headphones.She giggled behind me as she started to move her finger again. I hoped she hadn't heard the swearing.

"Sorry, guys. I'm in with you now, but going on mute to save you hearing my sister cry from the Chinese burn she's gonna get," I responded. Laughter came through the headphones, drowning out the gunfire as I clicked the mute button and turned to scold the youngest of the family.

"No peeking," she said, stopping me. 

"You know the rules."I laughed out loud and decided to play along. 

"Ok, OK. Start again."Again, I felt her finger trace a random shape.

"There's a finger in your back... which... finger... was... that!"

"Uuummmm, that was definitely your little middle finger."

"Wrooooooong," she giggled. "It was my little pinky.

Well, I definitely felt a middle finger coming through the screen from my friends, I thought.

"Ahh damn, you've got me. Good game, Ames. Now I gotta finish this game, ok?" I asked.

"One more game, pleeasssee?"

"I can't... I really need to beat this boss."

Even though I had headphones on, I could hear her starting to cry behind me. God damn it. Why do I have to choose between my friends and my little sister? She's so annoying... always barging into my room to play. Yes, I know it's sweet and all, but there's an age gap of 15 years between us, and Mum refuses to put a lock on my door.

"Ok Amy... Amy... don't cry... one more game, ok?"

"Yaaaayyyyy!"I always fall for that fake crying, every bloody time. Although I can't complain really; I did the exact same when I was her [age.So](http://age.So) I played on with the game both on the screen and on my back.

"There's a finger on your back... which... finger... was that?"

"Ooooh tricky one. Um, ummm, um, I think that was your thumb?"

"Wrong again. It was my pinky finger again."I feigned laughter. 

"Damn it. You're really good at this game. You win then. We'll have a rematch when I've finished with my mates."

"One more game?"

"No, we can't, Amy. Sorry. Maybe ask Mum. I thought you two were out anyway. When did you get back?"

"Come on, one more game, pleeasssee. Pretty pretty please?"

"I can't. Go play with Mum."

The crying began.

"MUM! Can you get Amy, please? I'm trying to play a game!"

No answer. Crying got louder.

"Muuuuum!"

For fuck's sake. We were so close to winning this game. I'm not just going to give up now and let the boys down.

"Ok, OK. Stop crying. One more game. That's it. Where's Mum? How come you're not at your recital? You weren't meant to be back for another hour or so."

"Yaaaayyyy. OK, gawweee. One more.""There's a finger on your back.. Which.. Finger... Was..."

My mobile started to ring.

"That..." she poked me right in the middle of the back, hard.

"Owww, Amy... No need for that."

The phone beside me kept ringing, and I quickly turned away from the monitor to see the display... 'Mum calling'.That was weird.

"Did Mum go back out, Amy?"

"Which... finger... was... that?"

"Stop it now, Amy. Why is Mum ringing? Is she downstairs? Muuuum?"

"Which finger...""Jesus, Amy, stop!" The phone kept ringing. The game kept playing. The childish mantra kept singing. 

And ringing. 

And playing. 

And singing.

I finally threw the controller at the wall and picked up my phone, shrugging the finger in my back away.

"What, Mum? What? I'm bloody playing a game, and Amy is here pissing around and ruining it. Where the hell are you??"

"Gary... son... it's... there's been an accident..." she said barely audible between the crying

My heart skipped a beat. 

"Oh shit, Mum. Are you OK?"

"Yes, injured but OK. But your sister... she... wait... what do you mean she's with you?"

"She's behind me now." I turned, and my heart sank. No one was there.

"Gary... Gary?"

"Sorry, Mum, she is... she was... we were... wait, this can't be happening. She's been here for 10 minutes. Is this a bloody joke?"

"Gareth, do you think I'd joke about this? Wait... did you say 10 minutes?"

"Yeah, why?"

"The crash... it was about 10 minutes ago. I've only just been able to ring you."

A chill ran down my spine. 

"Mum, what's happened? Where's Amy?"

"She... there was nothing... they couldn't get to her... the fire engulfed the whole car." Her voice cracked between sobs

"What? No! NO!!! She was here... she is here!"

The phone dropped from my hand as I went searching through the house, calling my sister's name, but to no response. The silence was deafening.

After that the days seemed to blur together. The hospital. The family meetings. The funeral. The crushing grief.

Weeks later, I learned they’d found a piece of Amy just metres away from the wreckage. Her little finger.

That night, as I sat in the dark of my room, staring at the blank screen of my gaming monitor, a familiar sensation crept up my spine and I felt a small, circular motion on my back.

“There’s a finger on your back,” a faint voice whispered. “Which finger... is... that?”

I didn’t turn around. I didn’t need to guess. I knew which finger it was. The same finger that had been poking me all along. The only piece of my sister that remained. As tears streamed down my face, I whispered, 

“Your pinky, Amy. It’s your pinky.

”Behind me, a soft giggle echoed in the empty room. “Yaaaay, You finally got it right, big brother. Your turn!!!!!”
