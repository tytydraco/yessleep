I always wanted to be a mom when I was younger. 

I’d be at the store looking for detergent or some other thing and the racks of baby clothes would catch my eye. I couldn’t help but smile at the swaddlers, the incredibly tiny socks. So perfect. I couldn’t wait to have my own baby some day.

Of course, I already had one baby. Baby Freckles, my Australian shepherd. 

Freckles had been with me since the graduate school days, when I had been lonely and needed a break from all the screen time. She was truly the best. We took long, quiet walks together, played ball in the yard, and snuggled in front of the tv. I couldn’t imagine life without her.

Still, I wanted to be a mother someday, and when my boyfriend Rob eventually proposed I knew that moment was coming. 

Truthfully, I was a little scared to be a mom.

I didn’t grow up with any siblings, so my experience with babies was limited to holding my cousin’s newest child at Christmas or listening sympathetically to my friend’s tales of motherhood over drinks. 

Rob couldn’t wait to be a father though, so we didn’t wait long to start trying. He convinced me it would be great. Our lives would feel complete. Stupidly, I agreed. He had me convinced. When I found out I was pregnant several months later, we were ecstatic. 

We were young. I was naive.

The lack of experience is probably what deluded me into believing what we experienced was totally normal for so long. It wasn’t, though.

Benjamin arrived one snowy afternoon after a long and tortuous delivery. I was completely drained, and couldn’t believe how I’d been gaslighted (by friends, family, and doctors) into believing birth would be a smooth sailing, spiritual experience. Still, I was thrilled to finally hold my baby boy. Rob and I were proud parents.

The initial glow faded quickly. Benjamin was not a happy baby. 

He cried constantly. The ceaseless screaming drove me nuts. I was in a perpetual state of exhaustion. Rob tried to put on a brave face, but his smiles grew weaker every day. When Benjamin started vomiting nearly everything we fed him, I could really see Rob cracking.

The doctors did their best to let us know that colic was very, very common, and totally normal. We soldiered on, sleepless and frazzled, through that first year. Freckles was just as bewildered as we were, and would bark or whine at the high pitched wails.

Needless to say, our happy home was happy no longer. My relationship with Rob became strained. Our world revolved around baby Benjamin, and doing anything we could to keep him happy, destroying our own happiness in the process.

I began to resent the amount of time Benjamin stole from me. I missed the long quiet walks with Freckles, where I could calmly gather my thoughts. I felt guilty for not loving every moment with my son. I knew my feelings were wrong, but I could see that Rob was feeling them too. He avoided my gaze at home and began spending long hours away from the house. More and more of the household responsibilities fell on me, and I was increasingly isolated.

Benjamin was a fussy baby, and he became an even wilder toddler. 

His cries became rage- fueled screams as he entered the “terrible twos.” Everything induced a tantrum, from carrots instead of peas to not wearing his favorite shoes. My own mother just laughed at my despair.

“You were like that yourself!” she would chuckle, as she waltzed out the door, leaving me to triage with my displeased toddler.

Rob became even more useless and tapped out as Benjamin grew into a young child. He barely talked to me anymore. I knew he was seeing someone else, and I didn’t even have the energy to fight him about it. 

When Benjamin started to truly become violent, around the age of five, I tried to ignore it. I really did. But I couldn’t ignore it for long. 

I knew something wasn’t right. He was a bright boy, clearly, but constantly unhappy. Anything sent him into a rage. I did my best to control it and contain it. I could see the other parents on the playground giving me the side eye, like “can’t you just control your child?” I knew it was awful. I was struggling on my own. 

By then, of course, Rob was long gone.

I tried to sign him up for cub scouts, thinking that being around other kids his own age would be helpful. He only lasted a few weeks before he was kicked out for pushing another boy out of a treehouse.

I tried to play it off as though it had been an accident- surely it had?- but a few other nasty incidents flashed in the back of my mind.

Benjamin throwing blocks at my head when I played with Freckles instead of him.

Benjamin kicking another boy on the playground when he wouldn’t share.

Benjamin biting me when I tried to buckle his seat belt.

Benjamin’s goldfish, which had innocently “jumped out of its bowl” and died on the table.

Every moment of my life became a waking hell. If I hadn’t resented him before this, I definitely did now. I looked sadly at Freckles. She was getting old. Deep down I wished it had just stayed the two of us, and I hated myself for that thought.

I knew he was getting worse. Maybe by ignoring it I emboldened him, because it wasn’t long after that I woke up one morning to Freckles foaming at the mouth.

I rushed Freckles to the emergency vet but it was too late. She died not long after. Poison, likely from a household cleaner.

I spent a long moment in the car just sobbing. I was crushed. She had truly been such a good dog. I felt like the last bright spot in my life had just gone out.

That night at dinner I was so sickened by grief that I could barely eat. All I could think of was sweet Freckles. How perfect she’d been, how much fun she was, and how much she loved being with me, even after Benjamin was born.

How sad and deflated her fluffy corpse had looked on the examining table.

“Mommy?”

I looked across the table at Benjamin, who was getting his spaghetti all over him.

“Yes?”

“It’s just us two now.” He smiled at me with his sauce- ringed mouth.

“Yes. It’s just the two of us.” I smiled weakly. I had never regretted becoming a mother more than at that moment.

I want to believe it was an accident. That Freckles ate the bathroom cleaner on her own. That it wasn’t sprinkled into her food by a jealous kid.

But I can’t ignore that sick feeling in the pit of my stomach.  

I think I know what really happened to [Freckles](https://www.reddit.com/r/SunshineScarystories/comments/x88quz/story_index/).
