“829, you copy?” The voice crackled through the speakers on the console in front of me, pulling me back from the drowsy lethargy that I’d been enjoying for the last hour. I reluctantly sat up in my chair and dropped my feet from where they’d been resting atop the workstation to the dirty metallic floor with a hollow thud. It’d been a long night; I hadn’t slept very well, and when my alarm woke me this morning, I felt as if I hadn’t slept at all.

That damned wind. It seemed like it never stopped, but last night had been exceptionally noisome after night fell, howling and whistling across the exterior of the station, like it was searching for a way in. If I used my imagination just a little, it almost sounded like a hundred fingernails scratching at the hatch.

I tried not to use my imagination too much.

It wasn’t much better this morning. It sounded like a hell of a blow out there, but that was to be expected this time of year, I suppose.

“Abyssal 829, this is Central – respond. *Crawford, pick up if you’re there*,” the voice hailed again, this time with the distinct coloring of urgency. It was slightly distorted, sounding strangely artificial mixed in with all that static.

I took a sip of my lukewarm coffee with a grimace and switched on the microphone.

“Yeah, this is Crawford. That you, Wilks?” I asked, as if it could have been anyone else out here in this frozen wasteland.

When Wilks replied, I heard the unmistakable tinge of relief in his tone. “Jesus, Mike, I’ve been hailing you for ten minutes. Where the hell have you been?”

*Ten minutes? I hadn’t heard a thing*. Maybe I’d dozed off after all, I thought, resolving to lay off the whiskey for a while.

“Yeah, sorry, Jack – I was in the head,” I lied. “What’s up?”

“515 went offline this morning at around 05:40,” he said. “Last transmission was at their oh-two-hundred scheduled check-in. Nothing since then. They’ve missed two check-ins since then.”

Now I sat up straight in my chair, the last vestiges of sleepiness dissolving in an instant. I punched a few keys on the console, bringing up my OpStat displays. “*Offline?* Are you sure? Storm’s pretty bad out here on the south rim; I’m getting a lot of distortion from your end. Maybe there’s just too much interference.”

Jack Wilks paused a moment before speaking again. “Corporate radioed me a little while ago. Their telemetry for 515 was reading some low-level seismic activity for forty-three minutes before all feeds went dead. Last status update from the station officer was, and I quote, ‘confused and agitated’.”

“Geller? She’s as strait-laced as they come,” I said with a frown. “I’ve never heard anybody describe her as confused *or* agitated.”

“I know,” Wilks said. “That’s what worries me. Especially with what happened last month.”

He didn’t need to elaborate; the memory of what happened to Abyssal 524 was still fresh in all our minds.

“That was an anomaly,” I said, echoing the official corporate findings. “Geological surveys were rushed and incomplete when 524 was deployed.” I tried to sound as resolute as I could, but Jack knew me better than that. It was more for my benefit than his.

“I know,” he relented, though I knew he didn’t believe it any more than I did. “But still, it makes me uneasy. Geller’s tough – as tough as they come. Hell, she’s been on station for what, sixteen months, all by herself?”

“Something like that, yeah,” I replied. My fingers danced across the keyboard, navigating the status screens until I found the one I was looking for – a listing of all the rim monitoring stations. My eyes scanned the list of amber text as I paged through the screens. I stopped when I found it – Abyssal 515. It stood out on the page like a beacon. Unlike the other station listings on the screen, the status metrics for 515 were empty, just dashes where the abbreviations and numeric values should have been.

“*Shit,*” I said under my breath, my mind already sifting through possible explanations that *weren’t* worst-case.

I didn’t come up with too many of them.

“So, what’s the plan?” I asked, though I had a sick feeling in my gut that I already knew what it was.

“We need to check it out and see if Geller’s okay,” he said carefully. “It might just be a communication disruption, like you said, but we need to make sure.”

I knew where this was heading, and I was already shaking my head. “No way, Jack. Uh-uh. There’s no way I’m going out there in this weather. One good gust will blow the mule right over the edge and I’m not getting paid enough for that. Rescue operations are not part of my contracted responsibilities.”

“Mike, listen – it’s not about the company or the monitoring station. If Geller’s hurt, we can’t just leave her out there. She could need help.”

“So, send someone else,” I argued. “Hell, send a response team or check it out yourself – I don’t care. I’m a monitoring tech, not a rescue operator.”

Wilks paused a moment before he spoke again. “The nearest response team has already been mobilized, but they’re hours away. I’m even farther, you know that. Mike, I can’t compel you to go check it out, but if Geller’s hurt or in need of help, you might be the only chance she has. What if it was you out there?”

I pushed myself away from the console and stood, running a hand through my scruffy hair and pacing anxiously, thoughts spinning. Wilks had fallen silent – he knew that there was nothing else he could say to convince me, but he also knew he’d already set the hook. If something *had* happened to the monitoring station, it was likely already too late for Geller. But if she *was* still there, she would need help, and soon. If nothing else, she would need an evac, and 829 – *my* shack – was the nearest option. I wondered how long a person could last outside in this weather, especially if they didn’t have shelter.

I heard Wilks’ words again in my head and I wondered what it would feel like if it were me.

Alone, in the dark. Huddling in the cold and the wind.

Listening to those sounds all around me. Maybe seeing dim shadows in the blinding mist.

 Just waiting for someone – *anyone* – to come for me.

*Damn it.*

“You’re an asshole, Jack,” I said finally.

“I know, Mike. I’m sorry,” was all he said.

“I’ll contact you when I have something to report.”

“Thanks, Mike. I’ll be standing by. Central out.”

\*

Fifteen minutes later, I was bundled in my foul weather gear – heavy coat and pants striped with reflective material, with thick gloves and boots. A pair of weather-worn goggles hung around my neck as I buckled myself into the enclosed cabin of my mule. The thing looked like one of those industrial snow cats, with rusted caterpillar tracks and a rotating emergency beacon on the roof. The yellow paint was faded and chipped, and the windscreen was scratched and in desperate need of replacement. Only one of the wipers still remained, and it barely worked well enough to leave grimy streaks across the glass.

I could hear the raging wind thrashing against the exterior of the heavy steel roll-up door, but it sounded subdued, removed from where I sat. The garage was large enough to accommodate two mules parked abreast, with room to spare, but it felt claustrophobic inside the cab.

“*What the hell are you doing, Mike*?” I asked myself for probably the hundredth time as I pressed the ignition switch. The powerful engine lurched to life with an angry roar, reverberating against the cold steel of the walls. The vibrations shook the gear shifter with a rattle as I worked my way across the illuminated control panel, turning on the various systems. Interior heat, air filters, comms, exterior lighting, navigation – I activated each of the subsystems in turn, verifying their statuses on the main display. When I was satisfied that all was working as expected, I took a deep breath and keyed in the command to raise the heavy roll-up door.

A red strobe near the door began to flash, joined by a muted warning alarm, and then the door lurched into motion, rising from the concrete floor with a squeal of protest. The gray light of day washed in as it rose, and I felt the raging of the wind as it swirled into the garage area, buffeting the mule as it came.

I lifted the headset from its hook and placed it over my ears, adjusting the boom mic in front of my mouth.

“Central, this is Abyssal 829 for radio check, how copy?” I said.

Wilks replied immediately. “829, this is Central. Read you five-by-five.”

“I’m heading out now, Jack. I’ll stay in contact and I’ll advise as soon as I have anything.”

And with that, I engaged the gear lever and throttled up, easing the mule forward, out of the shelter of the station and into the fury of the storm.

The monitoring stations were all connected by a paved roadway marked with bright yellow strobe lights to guide our way. The low, dense cloud cover overhead and the chaotic winds did their best to make it damned near impossible to see more than twenty feet, and that was only because of the efforts of the high-intensity exterior lights of the mule.

Within a minute, I glanced over my shoulder to find that my station had been swallowed up by the dim light and charcoal-colored dust. The muted white exterior lights were only just barely visible and fading quickly as I went.

All around me on either side of the road, the terrain was rocky and uneven – foreign, almost alien. Though it was barely past noon, the daylight was so subdued that it might as well have been late dusk. I pushed along, watching the rock formations pass by on either side. They seemed closer, somehow, as if the road had narrowed, dragging the terrain with it as it collapsed inward.

How long had it been since I’d been out here? A month, at least. Probably closer to two. That had been late summer, though, and the storms hadn’t really started yet.

On my right, what seemed like an endless hellscape of jagged rocky outcroppings and uneven, upturned ground stretched out beyond sight.

But it was to my left that I kept my eyes strained and focused. *It* was there; close but still hidden by the dust and the wind. That made it all the more unsettling, I thought – not being able to see it, but knowing it was there.

I straightened my course, having unconsciously drifted to the right side of the roadway, as if my hands were trying to keep me as far away as possible.

The wind rocked the mule on its tracks and strained at the doors, trying to pry them open to get inside. At one point, I thought I felt the steel treads scrape and slide across the gritty pavement as the heavy vehicle fought against a sudden gust, but that was probably just my imagination.

As unnerving as it was being away from the station in the storm, my rational mind knew there wasn’t really any chance of being blown over. The winds were strong, to be sure, and I wouldn’t want to be walking around outside, but the mule was twelve thousand pounds – six tons of anchor – with a massively overpowered engine driving the tracks. Outside was hell, but I was safe enough in here.

From the storm, at least.

I had traveled a mile, perhaps two, when I reached a spot where a sheer vertical wall of rockface rose a hundred feet in the air to the right of the roadway. It served as a windbreak, providing a temporary respite from the worst of the gale.

It also allowed the first view of the rim, only fifty feet away. I throttled back, bringing the mule to a halt in the shelter of the cliffside, and my eyes swept out over the vast empty space we knew simply as *the pit*.

It was twenty miles across, a ragged circular shaft punched into the solid rock of the ground. The walls of the pit were brutal and abrupt, as if the thing had been formed by some unimaginably massive bore.

We had no idea how deep it was, or if it even had a bottom, despite how insane that may sound. Nothing sent down into those depths ever returned. Manned vehicles, remote drones, even tethered cameras and sensors – they all just vanished without a trace, without warning. Even radar pulses and laser measuring devices were left blind by that immense black void.

No idea how it had come to be, or why. There was so much we didn’t know about it.

All we knew for sure was that thirty-seven years ago, in the middle of an active winter storm season, the lonely weather outpost that had been operating out here in this wasteland had gone silent. No alerts, no distress calls.

Nothing.

A month later, when the weather subsided enough to allow teams to investigate what had happened, all they found was the pit, a stygian maw larger than anyone could have imagined.

A doorway to hell, maybe.

Monitoring stations were built around its rim, to observe and document anything they could. Still, we knew little more about it now than we did all those years ago.

And everything we did know was bad.

I tore my eyes away from the swirling clouds of dust and mist that seemed ever-present as they rolled over the edges of the rim, hiding whatever lay below.

With a quiet curse, I put the mule back in gear and continued my travel. I was close to 515 now – not more than a few hundred yards, I estimated. The navigation screen jumped and changed, sometimes showing me right on top of the station, and at other times miles away yet. It might have been disconcerting if not for the fact that this was yet another of the occasional anomalies that surrounded the pit – the effect it had on radio and electromagnetic signals.

That’s one of the reasons I hadn’t been too concerned about radio communication loss with 515 initially. It wasn’t uncommon and typically remedied itself within an hour or two.

Telemetry loss was something different, though.

Telemetry from each of the monitoring stations was transmitted in real time via fiber optic cables carefully buried beside the roadway in a massive ring around the pit. They weren’t as easily disrupted by whatever was going on in there. If the company had lost the telemetry stream, that implied something bad had happened.

I pushed the thoughts from my head as I drove the mule along, focusing on the roadway ahead and already feeling the beginnings of a tension headache working at the back of my skull.

Soon, I came to the offshoot of pavement that veered left of the roadway and served as the approach to Abyssal 515. I released the breath I hadn’t realized I’d been holding as the mule pushed stubbornly through the dust and damp mist. The wind had dropped significantly for the moment, and the air was almost still now.

That happened sometimes during these storms – the calm could last a minute or even an hour before the winds returned suddenly and without warning. God help the person caught in the open when that happened.

I was so focused on trying to pierce the veil of grimy fog that I almost didn’t notice that the paved drive ahead of me suddenly dropped away into the gaping abyss of the pit. I slammed both feet on the brake and the heavy vehicle rocked to a sudden halt, throwing me against the safety harness painfully.

I could almost imagine the ground beneath the mule’s treads beginning to give way.

“*Shit shit shit*,” I cursed, throwing the gearbox into reverse and carefully backing away from the edge. I’d come within feet of driving right over the rim and into whatever terrible oblivion lay below. Even with their grip on the controls, my hands were shaking as adrenalin flooded my senses and narrowed my vision.

When I’d backed away to a safe distance, I set the brake and took the mule out of gear, willing my hammering heartrate to slow and hoarse breathing to calm. I felt lightheaded, but that soon passed.

I repositioned the microphone in front of my lips. “Central, this is Abyssal 829. How copy?”

Nothing but static answered my hail. The suffocating feeling of remoteness and solitude crowded my thoughts, and I pushed them away as best I could.

I tried hailing Jack again with no better luck. The damned storm was blocking me. Isolating me from everything else.

I knew I needed to investigate further. I’d come this far, after all. I couldn’t leave without at least confirming my fears.

I waited a few seconds for the feeling of panic to subside, and I was able to unbuckle my harness. I removed the radio headset and positioned the goggles over my eyes to protect them from the scouring effect of the windblown dust and grit. We’d learned from those who came here before us; we knew it could blind a man in seconds.

Raising the filtered gaiter to cover the rest of my face, I unlatched and pushed the door of the mule open, stepping out onto the exposed steel tracks and then carefully climbing down to the rock-strewn ground.

The air out here was frigid – colder than it should have been, but my gear protected me. Even so, the icy air found even the most miniscule of gaps in my clothing and penetrated to my bare skin beneath, drawing from me a shudder and raising gooseflesh across my body.

I hated it out here.

Arming myself with a high-intensity torch from the cab of the mule, I carefully made my way across the paved drive, keeping the brilliant white beam scanning the gray and black terrain ahead of me.

Strange sounds surrounded the pit – it was one of the things I found the most unsettling about being out here. Deep and almost ethereal, like the whale-song of some displaced and cosmic leviathan, it rolled through the air, vibrating the ground beneath my boots. It wasn’t loud enough to be uncomfortable, but there was no denying the psychological effect it had on a person out here all alone.

Most deployments out here were only two-month stints; that’s about what the average person could handle before they started having…*issues*. Some others, like me, were able to stay longer. I’d been here for eight months so far and wasn’t planning to rotate out for another thirty-eight days.

Macy Geller was different, though. With four years in the marines and more than sixteen months on-station here, she was a goddamned legend. I had no idea how she’d persisted for so long, but I knew one thing for sure – Macy Geller was going to retire a very young and very rich woman.

At least, that was my sincere hope.

I made my way cautiously along the edge of the rim, making sure to keep as safe a distance as my search would allow. The rock that abutted the edge hadn’t crumbled away or eroded – the terminus was smooth and knife-sharp where it dropped away.

Pushing on a bit farther, I came upon what I had been dreading since I arrived – the steel and concrete foundation of the monitoring station itself. Of the building, there was no sign – it was simply gone, replaced by that menacing and unending nothingness that it had bordered. The foundation was twisted and torn, as if it had been riven by some great claw. Bundles of sheared wires hung exposed and swaying over the edge, and the fine white hair of fiber optic cables lay snaked out from their junction box nearby.

“*Holy shit*,” I muttered, staggering back a few steps from the devastation. What had happened to 515? What could have done this?

I was finished here. I needed to get back to the mule and back to my station. I needed to report what I’d found. Maybe I’d even request an early extraction. I’d done my time – let them find someone else to keep watch over this fucking hole.

As I turned, my boot found an unseen rut that cut across the rocky ground and I nearly fell before catching myself. I realized that I was looking at the distinct tracks made by another mule, leading away from where the station had stood.

Maybe she’d managed to get away, after all…

“*Macy! Macy Geller!*” I shouted as loud as I could, swinging my flashlight beam across the whole area. Once again, the lack of visibility was frustrating, making my search a nearly impossible task. She couldn’t have gone far, especially in the direction the tracks led. There was nothing but broken and rocky terrain that way, with boulders the size of houses crowding the landscape.

“*Geller! It’s Mike Crawford from 829! If you can hear me, call out!*” I shouted, my voice sounding pitifully small out here.

When I found Geller’s mule, it emerged from the mist like a wounded animal, its nose driven disastrously into the sheer edge of a rocky shelf twenty feet high. Even from here, I could tell it probably wouldn’t ever move again from where it now rested.

I rushed to the cab, painfully aware that the wind was starting to pick back up again. I was just thankful that it was giving me some uncharacteristic warning instead of simply springing up and blowing me over the rim and into the pit.

The blunt nose of the mule had taken the worst of the impact, and even though it hadn’t been moving with any great speed when it found the rockface, twelve thousand pounds of steel in motion wasn’t inclined to stop on a dime.

I twisted the handle and pulled on the hatch, but the twisted and bent frame held it fast. I could see a form inside, in the driver’s seat, but the glass had been frosted over by the windblown grit and was nearly opaque, so I couldn’t make out any details. I didn’t miss the lack of movement, though.

Still, there was a chance now.

With renewed urgency, I rushed around to the rear of the mule, to where I knew the equipment storage was. Inside the weather-beaten compartment, I found the wrecking bar I was looking for – a heavy pry-bar with a pointed tip on one end and a thick flattened wedge on the other.

I came back around to the hatch and slammed the wedge into the gap between the door and the frame. The bar found purchase and I heaved against it with all my weight.

The metal groaned and fought, but then the door released with a screech and burst open so abruptly that I nearly fell on my ass.

I dropped the heavy bar to the ground with a ringing clatter and scrambled up onto the steel tracks of the mule, leaning into the cab. The nightmare I found there caused me to lurch backward, almost off the edge of the tracks.

Geller, the woman I’d known mostly through radio contact and whom I’d only met face-to-face on a few occasions, was still harnessed into her seat. Her heavy jacket had been thrown on in a hurry and wasn’t even zipped. Her goggles still sat securely over her eyes, but everything beyond that was a mess.

It took me longer than it should have to process exactly what I was seeing, and when I did, I still couldn’t make sense of it.

Drying, sticky blood covered everything in a tacky coating. Her mouth hung open in a silent scream that spoke of the terror that must have filled her final moments. Her skin was gray and splotchy, with what looked like open sores all over, weeping thick fluid and giving her the obscene appearance that the flesh was melting away from her skull.

I looked away from her face and saw her hands still wrapped around the controls, even in death. For a moment I wondered why they hadn’t released their grip. When I looked closer, I saw that they weren’t really *clutching* the hard plastic at all, but had somehow become adhered to it, sinking obscenely into the surface and… melding with it.

The veins of her exposed skin stood out in stark contrast, snaking just below the surface like black tendrils, spiderwebbing beneath her thin gray flesh. I forced myself to reach for her goggles and found them fused to her face. Looking through the scratched lenses instead, I found myself staring at two milky-white orbs, wide and filled with horror, but thankfully still and lifeless.

I’m not sure what I would have done if they’d blinked just then.

A sudden howl of wind rose as it wound through the rock and over the rim of the pit behind me. That was enough to draw my attention and spur me to motion.

I had to leave, and *now*. I couldn’t be caught outside my mule when the storm returned in earnest, or I might be blown right over the edge – just another soul lost to the darkness.

I’m still not sure why the storm had paused its fury long enough for me to complete my search; perhaps it *wanted* me to find Geller, to show me what it had done to her.

Maybe it wanted to show me what it was going to do to me.

I raced back to the safety of my mule, the engine still idling as I’d left it. Hurriedly securing myself in the cab, I turned it around and rushed back to my station, pushing the throttles farther than I should have. The aging engine protested and the black roadway passed beneath me in a blur as I returned to the only haven I knew – Abyssal 829.

Miraculously, fifteen minutes later, the dim exterior lights of my station appeared before me, emerging from the wind-driven detritus of grimy and damp grit like a lighthouse of old. I slowed as it came fully into view and keyed the exterior door of the garage as soon as I was close enough.

The hellish storm had returned with all its fury now, and I could even see the muted flashes of distant lightning from somewhere over the pit.

That was new.

As soon as I had the mule inside and the door closed securely behind it, I quickly shut it down and leapt from the cab, rushing into the station and to my control room. I shed off the heavy jacket, letting it fall to the floor as I reached for the communication controls. I had to let Jack know what I’d seen – what had happened to Geller.

He’d know what to do; that was his job, after all. This was all above my pay grade.

But then my hand froze, hovering over the console as my eyes settled on the OpStat screen I’d been looking at before I left.

The list of monitoring stations was still waiting patiently for my return, but something was wrong. I felt my mouth go dry as I saw their telemetry feeds begin to go offline, one by one, blinking out like candles being snuffed.

Outside, the wind howled, and I heard that haunting moan sweep over the station, louder than ever before – maybe closer – and now sounding less like the ethereal whale song I’d always equated it to.

Now it sounded more menacing. Threatening.

Hungry.
