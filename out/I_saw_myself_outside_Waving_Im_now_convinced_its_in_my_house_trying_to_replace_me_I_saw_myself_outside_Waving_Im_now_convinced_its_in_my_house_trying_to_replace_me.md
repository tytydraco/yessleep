I saw myself outside Waving, I'm now convinced it's in my house trying to replace me. 

I saw myself outside Waving, I'm now convinced it's in my house trying to replace me.

I was in my room, with my headphones on playing "Physco killer" I fell on my bed just to get my Report book. I saw my brother Alfo Sitting on the couch Laughing on the TV, I got up, took my headphones off and I went down.

"What'ca watchin' ?" I said
"Oh nothing, just some horror stories that don't make sense" 

I sat on the couch, it switched and I saw a girl narrating. Then I read the words:
"My dopplerganger" I continued to watch as my brother was just about to pee, I checked the time it was 9:00pm. 

"I was outside, when I saw my self. And I looked at her, copying my every move. I just said "WHERES THE CAMERA?" yet she was like a speaker mirror. She just said it at the same time as me, I just freaked out and called 911" The girl on the TV said

"Hello 911, What's your emergency?"

"There's someone copying me outside, and it's still copying me."

"Ma'am are you sure? There's someone who's calling at the same time right now who's telling the EXACT same as u with your OWN voice."

"Yes! I'm super sure!"She said

I was thinking, this is so dumb I don't even understand this!

"Alfo this is so dum-"

I checked the time and it said 2:00Am
WHAT?! It's been 5 hours already?
I saw My brother in his bed 

"Hey you should sleep now, mom might wake up."
Alfo said

"Yea I'm about to."

I tucked in my blanket and I stared at the window, I saw a person waving. I was thinking it was my friend or my order. But I didn't order anything nor my friends because their probably asleep. I was just thinking of a rational thing to think so I would panic. Yet it layed on the floor. Just. Like. Me.
I just slept. And I was Gonna pee, I checked the time. It was 3:33am I looked at the window and it wasn't their anymore. PHEW! I got to the bathroom and the lights TURNED OFF every light on the house. My mom and dad woke up 

"Did someone turn off our lights?"

I heard footsteps, and that's when I heard: Myself

"Dad, Mom I think someone was outside earlier!"

I heard my own voice echoing through the hallway. My parents rushed into the living room, their faces pale with confusion and fear.

"What's going on?" my dad asked, looking at me, then the shadow at the end of the hallway.

"Who are you?" my mom shouted.

The figure stepped forward, revealing an exact replica of me. It smiled eerily, mirroring my every movement. 

I got out of the bathroom and said "That's not me!" I screamed.

The doppelganger tilted its head, mimicking my expression of terror. It took another step closer, and the lights flickered, casting strange shadows on the walls.

My dad grabbed a baseball bat from the closet and pointed it at the doppelganger. "Stay back!" he warned.

The doppelganger laughedâ€”a sound that was a twisted version of my own laughter. It raised its hand, and the lights went out completely. 

We were plunged into darkness. I could hear my mom's panicked breathing, my dad's muttered curses, and the soft, mocking laughter of the doppelganger. 

I fumbled for my phone and turned on the flashlight. The beam cut through the darkness, landing on the empty spot where the doppelganger had stood.

"It's gone," I whispered, but the relief was short-lived.

A cold hand grabbed my shoulder from behind. I spun around, dropping my phone. The flashlight's beam danced crazily around the room, illuminating brief glimpses of my parents' terrified faces and the empty hallway.

"It's still here," I gasped.

"Run!" my dad shouted, pushing us towards the front door.

We stumbled out into the night, the cold air hitting us like a slap. The neighborhood was eerily silent, the only sound our ragged breaths and pounding footsteps.

As we reached the end of the driveway, I glanced back at the house. The doppelganger stood in the doorway, watching us with that same eerie smile. 

"We need to call the police," my mom said, fumbling with her phone.

But before she could dial, the streetlights flickered and went out. 

The last thing I saw before we were plunged into darkness again was the doppelganger stepping out of the house, its eyes glowing in the night.
