**Entry 1:** 

Believe me when I say that you would need to see it to believe it. 

Even looking at it right now, I’m unable to gauge its true scope. They’re telling us that the base might be around five by five miles wide and that the summit measures three miles high. Right now it sits about half that height above the water. It doesn’t move. It just floats perfectly still. 

A Canadian cargo ship had been the first ones to report it. *It just appeared,* they’d said. One second the skies had been clear and then all of a sudden it was there. Quite literally in the blink of an eye. No warning, nothing at all to preface its arrival.

Contrary to the orders he’d been given, the captain of the ship decided to steer towards it, to “check it out.” He was never heard from again and the ship was never found. According to the ship’s last recorded communications with the US Coast Guard, the crew had reported seeing people in the water beneath the pyramid as they got closer to it. When asked to elaborate on what they meant, they all seemed confused by the question. 

“Those aren’t people. They can’t be,” somebody could be heard saying in the background.

“Captain, those aren’t people. They’re standing right on top of the water.” 

Shortly after, all hell broke loose. There was a lot of yelling, most of which quickly devolved into a cacophony of screams and shouts. Before communications had ceased as a whole, they were able to pick up on a few indistinct noises before a horrible screeching overpowered everything else. 

And then silence. 

I’m sure they’re leaving out a few details, but that’s the extent of the information they’ve divulged to us so far. 

Right now, I’m sitting on one of the many boats they have set up in a perimeter around the thing, about one and a half miles out. 

Now, I don't want to go too deep into who I am or what I’m doing here. The most I'll say about it is that certain government agents had called my team out here for “security reasons.” Obviously I’m not supposed to be airing this shit out and usually I’d be warier of the consequences. But I’ve also never seen anything like this. Not even close. I don’t know. If shit goes south and they start trying to sweep things under the rug, I feel like the people have a right to know about what happened. 

We’ve been here for hours now, and the only instruction we’ve received so far is to stay put, to “report any irregularities.” Whatever that means. At least it gives me some time to take this all down. I’m sure that Ansel, our team’s commander, knows what I’m doing but even he hasn’t tried to stop me. I reckon that the rest of us are on the same page as well. 

It’s oddly silent out here. No wind, even. If you closed your eyes, it’d be difficult to imagine that something like this would be floating so close to you. To pass the time, we’ve been trying to get a better look at the thing through our binoculars. 

From what we can make out, it doesn’t appear to be a uniformly smooth shape, more like numerous steadily shrinking square slabs layered on top of each other. It’s impossible to tell what it might be made out of, but the thing is pure black, like a triangular void floating in the air. 

To be honest, the most unsettling part about it is the dark patch of water beneath. There’s been a lot of times where I’d thought I’d seen movement at the edge, but it might just be my eyes fucking around. Still. It’s not like we have no reason to believe that something might be there. 

**Entry 2:** 

A few hours have passed and in a few more the sun will have set. I’m not going to lie and say that it doesn’t concern me. It’s eerie enough looking up at the thing in broad daylight. I can’t imagine how it’s gonna be once it starts blending into the night. 

They aren’t telling us anything either. The giant ship that the higher-ups arrived on just sits there and we can’t even begin to guess what the fuck they’re doing or thinking. People are starting to get antsy. Hours and hours of sitting on a boat, staring up at this hellish thing. Not so good for the mind. 

But I suppose there have been a few developments. 

A team on another boat had reported seeing something scaling down the pyramid’s west face.

Brax, their commander, had said that he couldn’t tell how big it was or even what it vaguely resembled. Just that it was “leaping down the levels.” 

The sighting was corroborated by a few other boats, but nobody was able to get a good look at it. After a while Brax said that it jumped down into the water and ever since then we’ve all been a little bit on edge. 

On the less interesting side, a new boat has arrived and parked itself right next to ours. This wouldn’t be so strange on its own, but we’ve called the higher-ups and asked them what its doing here and the only thing they’ll tell us is to pretend like it doesn’t even exist, that it’s just here to “observe.” It’s unmarked, completely chrome gray, doesn’t match any model of any boat I’ve seen the government use before, and we haven’t seen anybody come out onto the deck. 

Whatever. At this point I suppose I should’ve learned to stop questioning these things.

**Entry 3:**

Night has come and to be honest, the darkness is more comforting than I thought it would be, though a lot of that can be boiled down to the fact that I can no longer see the thing. Of course, if I were to try hard enough, then I’d be able to. The moonlight just barely manages to reveal the structure's edges, a reminder that it's still there.

Right now, I’m on the night watch with Abdou. The rest of us are supposed to be sleeping, but I doubt that they’re able to. I sure couldn’t. Most likely they’re just lying still with their eyes closed, trying to think about anything else besides whatever the fuck is going on right now.

Even though we can't see the pyramid, the tension has hardly been mitigated. Every sound, no matter how slight ends being a jolt to our system, and how could it not?

I think our shift ends soon, but I don’t see what difference it would make. Sleep won’t come. Even if I tried, I wouldn’t be able to. Abdou hasn’t said a word to me, which is perturbing because he’s usually irritating as fuck. I can hear him breathing and even from a cursory listen, I can tell that he’s nervous. 

He’s never nervous.

**Entry 4:**

Abdou finally spoke up. 

“You hear that?” he whispered.

I told him that I didn’t, but that I’d listen for it. And then seconds later I did. 

Splashing. Quiet and clearly far away but it was unmistakable. Under more ordinary circumstances, we wouldn’t have given it a second thought. Splashing in the ocean for God’s sake. How strange. 

But here we both went silent, unsure of how to proceed. Would this be considered code red, something worth raising hell over? Surely not, right? 

But with everything else considered, it may as well have been. 

I grabbed my rifle, switched on the flashlight and scanned the water for movement. Abdou hesitated for a moment before doing the same. 

More splashing, impossible to tell from where. But it was closer now. After a while it stopped, and we both held our breaths. 

“Fuck,” I could hear Abdou muttering. “Fuck this, fuck this.” 

I began to walk the perimeter of the boat, trying to make sure that nothing had snuck up on us. I didn’t see anything on my first three rounds, but my heart nearly stopped on the fourth. At first it looked like one of those white theater masks, the ones with expressions on them. 

This one was frowning. I moved towards it slowly, keeping the light steady on it. For a while it just floated there, and I began to think that maybe it really was just a lost prop drifting out in the ocean. 

But then it smiled at me. 

I stepped back instinctively and when I went to go look at it again, it was gone. Then the boat swayed, as if something large had just grazed the bottom. 

Immediately everybody rose up out of their fake slumbers. There was a lot of scrambling around, a lot of yelling, people asking me what the hell had just happened. I looked at Abdou and his face was ghost white. He just shook his head, and I was at a similar loss for words.

Of course, I didn’t know how the hell to explain what I’d just seen, and I didn’t try. I simply told them that I hadn't seen anything, that it must’ve been a shark or something. Later that night Abdou would confirm to me that he’d seen the same thing only a few minutes after our shift had started.

But he'd told me that it wasn’t frowning. It never smiled either. According to him, the expression had been hateful. Malice in its purest form.

Suddenly his behavior that night made a lot more sense.

I’m not sure what to make of all this, but I can tell you that the last thing I want to do is deal with any of it. Our shift’s over now. My eyes are burning, my lids feel like lead. I really doubt that I’ll get any sleep but I’m gonna have to try.

Hopefully nothing happens until morning.

**Entry 5:**

Groggy as hell right now. I think I must’ve gotten maybe thirty, forty minutes of sleep, which is a lot more than I would’ve thought. They woke all of us about an hour ago. Remember the cargo ship that went missing? Well we found it.

Shortly after sunrise it came out from beneath the pyramid, cruising at a snail’s pace towards us. But communication lines are still severed, and even stranger, the thing looks decrepit, as if it had been sitting in a junkyard, rotting away for decades.

From what I’m hearing, the higher-ups have started losing their shit and they’re considering sending one of the teams out there to board the ship and investigate.

For the love of God, I just hope it isn’t ours.
