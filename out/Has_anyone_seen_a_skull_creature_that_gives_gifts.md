I know this is a weird way to ask but I'm writing this hoping I'll find others like me. I don't know how to explain what I am. Maybe I was chosen for something, maybe I was cursed, or maybe just maybe it was a gift like it said. Who knows, all I know is I need help and this is the one place my story will be believed.

Let me start from the beginning. So when I was a young boy of 5 to 6 years of age. I woke up in the middle of the night when I heard crying in my room. I was a brave kid so I didn't think much of it when I saw a boy crying in the corner. I got up from my bed and walked over to the boy. The room was hot and I was sweating a lot. When I got to the boy I noticed he was in a robe curled up in a corner.

"Um, are you okay?" I said as I touched his shoulder.

Suddenly the boy's cry changed to a long drawn out sigh. What I thought was that the boy started to  stand taller than I could imagine. Maybe 8 feet in height if I had to guess. When it turned all I saw was a skull with two eyes.

**Red. Piercing. Eyes.**

I felt nothing but fear. I screamed for my father but there was no answer. Just a twisted smile as a boney finger placed on its skull teeth.

"You're not supposed to be here." it said in a voice far from human. Far from anything that can be understood but for some reason I could. "You need to leave now."

it pointed a long boney finger towards me. Fire shot through my windows and the heat in the room grew tenfold. I ran towards my bed then suddenly I tripped over a toy in my room and slammed down on my knee. Pain shot up through my body. When I was able to stand it was already standing over me. I jumped onto my bed, pulled the cover over me and began to cry.

"You must leave this place for it is not your time." The two eyed skull of fire said. "I will give you a gift. a gift like no other of my kind has given. You will have my knowledge of everything that can not be understood by normal human minds. Now go and be one of the first of your kind.."

Suddenly I felt its finger touch my head. it burned and I screamed in pain for what seemed like hours. After it stopped I threw the cover off ready to run. Although when Ilooked around it was day. My room was the same as it was when I went to bed that night.

Iremember thinking ‘Was this a dream?’ My dad yelled for breakfast so I got up. When I began to stand, pain shot through my body. I looked for a source and saw blood dripping from my knee. ‘It wasn't a dream.’

I'm now 20 and a lot has happened since. None of which I think is connected to the skull creature. All I know is I was choden, cursed, or gifted with a mind that needs help. If you have seen a skull with one or more eyes please contact us. By us I mean a friend I found who has told me a story similar to mine before I ever mentioned the skull her’s had 1 eye and another friend had 3 eyes. We need each other for what is coming.
