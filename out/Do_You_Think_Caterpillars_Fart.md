"What the hell kind of question is that?" I say.

"I don't know man I just think of shit sometimes." Mitchell shrugs. "Hey let's test it out." He grins.

"What? What do you mean test it out? How would we test that out?"

"Get a bunch of caterpillars and feed em bean burritos or something then put them under a microscope. See if they fart."

"Are you serious?"

"C'mon man you're no fun! Who knows, we could win a nobel prize or some shit. You think any scientist has ever tested this before?"

"Yeah i really doubt it."

"Exactly, we'd be the first. I'm sure no one else has ever thought of this."

"Yes I am sure of that. Whatever, if it'll make you happy."

"Alright, let's go find some caterpillars."

"Where? it's winter."

"Oh yeah. Pet store?"

"Nah i don't think so. Better order them online."

"Yeah true, we can get different types of caterpillars. Maybe some fart, some don't."

I stare blankly. 

"You're paying for this?"

"Okay fine, one type of caterpillar."

We peruse the internet for a little bit, settling on the cheapest ones. I pay for it of course because Mitchell is broke as always. He never has any money because he always gets stupid ideas like this.

"Okay, it says they arrive saturday."

"Sweet, now we need to figure out what kind of burrito to give them."

"Taco bell." I say, only because it's the cheapest option.

"Ah dude you're right, that's definitely the gassiest option. Wait, do you have a microscope?"

"I had one when i was a kid, let me see if it still works."

After arriving at my house, we dig through my closet, eventually finding the worn out box.

"Oh cool, it plugs into the computer?"

"Yep." I say, stepping back into the car.

At his house, Mitchell messes around for a bit looking at his fingerprints.

"Dude, we could totally use this to rob a bank."

"What? No, you only get one stupid idea at a time."

"Okay fine, later." He grins.

Two days later, the caterpillars arrive and we set out for taco bell.

"We're gonna get some burritos for us too, right?"

"Fine."

After we chow down, we start to set up the experiment. I can't believe i'm even doing this. He's my best friend, so I should learn to listen to his ideas, but I really don't know where he comes up with this shit.

We unwrap a burrito and cut it in half, placing it inside the fish tank. Then we dump the caterpillars inside.

"Now what?"

"Now we wait."

"Do you really think they'll eat the burrito? Don't they only eat leaves?"

"We'll just have to find out. I'm sure they'll get hungry enough."

We sit and wait for this silly experiment to begin.

"Sooo, are we just gonna stare at these caterpillars all day or what?"

"Let's let them eat overnight and check on em in the morning. I'm sure it will take them awhile to finish a whole burrito."

"I'm sure."

So we do just that. I head home with plans to return tomorrow after work.

The next day, I'm off early so I head back to Mitchell's place. He greets me excitedly at the door.

"Have you checked on them yet?"

"Oh no, i was waiting for you."

"Alright."

"Let's get the microscope ready."

Mitchell excitedly lifts the sheet from the tank. A puzzled look hits his face.

Peering inside the tank, there's no sign of the burrito and all the caterpillars are now butterflies. Huge deformed butterflies, bigger than i've ever seen before. Something is off about them too, their wings are falling far too fast. Like a huge horsefly. A loud collective buzz comes from inside the tank.

The container rattles with the sound of hundreds of tiny wings and legs.

"What the..."

A crack forms in the glass.

"Hey, wait!"

Suddenly a swarm of horrific butterflies fills the room. I jump in fright as one grabs hold of mitchell's cheek, ripping flesh from his face.

"Run!"

We dart out of the room and slam the door shut. The sound of hundreds of predatory insects flapping against the door is heard.

"Get in the car!" I yell.

Blood drips from Mitchell's face as we book it for the car. Stepping inside the vehicle, I hear a loud crash. looking up, I see the second story window has broken open. Mitchell's room. Hundreds of these horrid winged creatures fly out of the opening.

My heart races as I slam on the gas, peeling out of his driveway. The insects follow. I can hardly see due to the swarm building up. I quickly turn the windshield wipers on full blast, attempting to flick them away. Insect juice coats my windshield as I drive erratically. I get on the highway and go as fast as I can, shaking off the remainder of the creatures. 

Heading to the hospital I decide perhaps this will be the last time I listen to one of Mitchell's ideas. Especially when I look down at my hand and see something has burrowed under my skin.
