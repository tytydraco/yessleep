Part 1:

I have always been drawn to places I shouldn’t go.

Especially when I was younger—the moment something felt out of reach, my curiosity would demand to know more. 

I moved to the Pacific Northwest when I was about twelve years old, and that errant desire only grew stronger. The thick woods stretched on endlessly in every direction, and it didn’t take me long to figure out that they harbored their own secrets. If you spent enough time out there, you were bound to find one of them. Concrete boxes swallowed by moss or fences that guarded nothing at all.

Most of these were unmarked and forgotten. To the locals, they were simply a fact of life. But not to me.

Kids loved to theorize about the purposes of these places. In doing so, they would invariably concoct some creepy paranormal experience to go along with it. And of course, all of these stories were too vague to trace or fact-check, and none of them ever happened to who was actually telling the story. 

Regardless, one theory always stuck out to me: **Abandoned military sites.** 

This wasn’t some far-off theory either. The region is no stranger to the various Cold War-era machinations of the U.S. government. 

I actually lived on one of the still-in-use military bases. This granted me some insight into what these places used to be. Usually, the theories were correct.

Most were created shortly before, during, or after World War II. As the war machine rapidly shifted focus in the early days of the Cold War, the less important sites were simply left to rot. The more expansive structures—the coastal batteries, bunkers, and missile complexes—were sold off to the highest bidder. 

Then I discovered the Nike Program.

Project Nike was a U.S. military program that rose out of the ashes of World War II. Trepidations about another war, one far more destructive than the last, led to the U.S. government lining the pockets of defense contractors, seeking new and innovative weapons of warfare. High-altitude bombers and long-range nuclear-capable missiles necessitated the invention of anti-aircraft weaponry capable of countering them.

The more I read about them, the more obsessed I became. 

By 1958, the Nike Hercules missile was developed by Bell Laboratories, designed to destroy entire Soviet bomber formations with a tactical nuclear explosion. 

265 Nike sites were created all across the United States, mainly to defend large population centers and military installations.

There were eighteen in my state. Five were within driving distance of me. 

I became particularly enthralled by these. I was always crazy about history, but my unquenchable, youthful curiosity was kindled by these places that were tantalizingly close, yet mysterious and bygone. 

But most of them were privately owned, or flooded—too dangerous to explore. I spent hours scouring online, learning everything I could about each and every one. But I never got to go to one. 

By the time I got to high school, I had kinda forgotten about the whole thing. Just like everyone else, I was more concerned with sports, girls, and trying to be liked than I was with obscure Cold War public history. 

In the fall of my sophomore year, I joined the cross-country team. For practice one day, we were sent on this long run up and around the lake on the far side of town. If you followed the trail, you’d end up back on the main road that led to the school in about five or six miles. 

It was supposed to take about an hour or so, but we were also a bunch of bored teenage boys. So, naturally, we got sidetracked. 

As the older and more serious runners left us behind, we had already decided we weren’t running that far today. Instead, a small group of us slowed to a walk. With the lake to our right and a steep, overgrown bluff to our left, my friend turned and stopped us.

“Hey, you guys wanna see something cool?”

There was a tone in his voice, like he had been waiting this whole time to say that. I was in. The others followed.

We scrambled up a steep dirt path that departed into the bushes off the side of the main trail. We quickly gained altitude, but it seemed like the trail just kept going up. Laughing and joking, we occasionally lost our footing and slid back a few feet before continuing up the slope with more care. 

During this ascent, I came to an abrupt realization. 

Despite living here for a few years, I had never explored much of the town before. Unlike most of my friends, I had no idea where anything actually was. My childish sense of direction rested solely on the main roads that the bus took me every day. 

I was trying to think of what we could be going to see, and my mind wandered further than my body. 

A thought crossed my mind—one I hadn’t had in years: the abandoned military posts.

*The Nike Sites. There were a handful nearby, right?*

It lingered. 

*Could I actually get to see one of these?* 

Before I could finish that thought, we crested the top of the hill and entered a rocky, uneven clearing, about fifty or so feet in either direction. The place was covered in dead grass and pine needles, and the misty October air felt colder than it had down by the lake. Despite its overgrown surroundings, the glade was devoid of any taller vegetation, save for a large rock that rested on top of a short cliff face. 

*I guess not.* I resigned that thought as quickly as it entered my head. 

We clambered up onto the rocks and grabbed our seats. The soft, ethereal atmosphere of the cool afternoon elevated the already beautiful overlook. The peak of the hill granted you sight over the tree tops, the lake, and the little town on the other side. It was breathtaking. 

The lack of tree cover allowed the wind to tear into us. I turned my head into my shoulder to duck out of the icy breeze, but something caught my eye when I did. 

Concrete. 

I jumped down off the rock and walked over to the faded slab—an elongated rectangle of old cement. On one side, leading down into a lower section of the clearing were about eight or nine cracked concrete stairs. 

On them were a few weathered, white footprints. 

It was the foundation of an old building. 

Besides a rusted metal pole sticking out of the rock near the structure, there was nothing else “man-made” that I could see. No wood, nails, or sheet metal. 

*Why was there an old foundation all the way up here? Where did the rest of the building go?*

After looking around for a moment, all I found were a couple of old beer cans and glass bottles. Before I could continue any further, my friends seemed to have decided it was time to head back. 

One of them called me over, “We should probably get going before coach realizes we aren’t back.”

“Yeah,” I replied as I jogged over. “Hey, do you know what that old building is from?” 

“Not really,” he surmised. “It’s been there as long as I can remember. Maybe it was a lookout tower or something? I don't know.” He trailed off before walking ahead of me to fit down the narrow trail. 

I stopped for a second and looked back at the clearing, taking a mental picture of everything. 

*Lookout tower.* 

Suddenly, my attention was caught again. Just beyond the clearing, obscured in the trees, was something yellow. A small metal sign with big black box writing. It took me a second to recognize what it was, but it looked like one of those old caution signs. 

I was locked—fixated on that speck of color in the sea of green and brown. My skin tingled with static—every hair on my arms stood on end. 

“Hey, Preston, let's go!” The yell from down the slope snapped me out of my trance. 

I jogged down after my friends. 

...

I never went back. In fact, I had barely given that place any thought since that cold afternoon.

But this past spring, it all came rushing back.

I’m now a history student at a local university. My public history class focused on all things abandoned. Old roads, faded signs, derelict buildings, and concrete ruins.

By the end of the semester, we were tasked with discovering the story behind a local “historical site”.

As soon as the assignment was announced, something shifted in me. 

*The Nike sites.* 

Now I had a reason to go back to them. A reason that mattered.

I didn’t want to just read about history anymore. I wanted to stand in it.

And this time, I had the tools and the knowledge to dig deeper. Maps, archives, declassified reports, and site coordinates. All of it.

It wasn’t just for a grade. This was the kind of thing I imagined myself doing when I daydreamed about being a real historian—researching something nobody else cared about, uncovering it, and bringing it back into the light.

So, I made up my mind. I was going to find one and tell its story. 

God, I wish I hadn’t. 

...

I wasn’t stupid. I knew the risks that something like this involved. 

Most, if not all, of these sites are now privately owned and restricted to outsiders. That’s not even considering the fact that they were built in the 50s; they were falling apart, lined with asbestos, chipping lead paint, and god knows what else. 

So I prepared myself. I spent hours scouring urban exploring guides and figured out exactly what I needed to protect myself, and then some. 

I bought a respirator (the kind they use for painting), work gloves, a headlamp, some glow sticks, a pair of bolt cutters, and a backup flashlight. I scavenged a hat, some thick work pants, a waterproof softshell jacket, and some boots from my dad's old military gear. I also packed a first aid kit and a few other essentials. It’s a bit overkill, I know, but I’m not exactly a seasoned explorer, and considering I was doing this alone, I wanted to be prepared for anything. 

I also couldn’t just throw this on and go to the first place I could find. I figured that not all of them would be accessible, and I definitely didn’t wanna deal with the cops or some disgruntled landowner with a rifle. 

In the following weeks, I discovered that a few of these places were actually on Google Maps, but as you can imagine, those were not the most ideal for what I had in mind. No, I needed something off the beaten path, something that wasn’t public knowledge.

The forums and documents I found all came up with the same results. Privately owned, flooded, buried, and forgotten. 

*If I still couldn’t step foot inside one, what was even the point?*

The end of the semester was growing closer and closer, and I was still empty-handed. 

That’s when it came back to me. That day on the hill by the lake. The strange foundation, the staircase to nowhere, and the yellow sign hidden in the trees.

That could be it. Even at the time, I thought there was more up there. 

But I hadn’t been there in years. I didn’t even remember exactly where it was. Still, it was my best option if I wanted to find something truly unique. I had made up my mind. 

It wasn’t until Friday that I found time to make it out to the lake. 

I parked my car near the boat launch, grabbed my bag, and started down the trail. 

I moved slowly, carefully scanning the edge for any sign of narrow trails that led up into the woods. I walked all the way to the far end, maybe a mile and a half, and doubled back. About halfway back, I finally saw something.

About thirty yards up the hill, nestled between two tall pine trees, were a few red beer cans. Behind the litter was a jagged rock face, half hidden behind a curtain of tree branches. 

After a few minutes of clambering up a steep game trail, I reached a flatter part of the terrain and paused to catch my breath.

I looked around—taken aback. 

*This was it.*

It wasn’t exactly as I remembered. My young imagination had inflated everything. The cliff wasn’t nearly as tall, the clearing wasn’t as big, but the important details were still there. 

One landmark in particular had overtaken my memory of the place, and staring at it again in person felt dreamlike. For some reason, those stairs had stood out in my mind more than the view or the people ever had. 

I can’t even remember exactly who was with me when I first saw them, but for some reason, I always remembered the stairs. 

I walked over and stood at the top. *Nine steps.* Faded, white footprints. Leading to nowhere.

I hadn’t felt anything off-putting until then. It was kind of fun being on a quest to rediscover something I had built up in my memory for so long. But that feeling was gone in an instant. 

The moment I stood at the top and looked down at the grass below, I was overcome with the most profound sense of dread I had ever experienced. 

My heart caught in my throat. 

I staggered back off the concrete and frantically looked around. A heavy knot formed in my stomach. The serene nature around me seemingly dropped its facade. It felt like the trees were shrouding something, and the world itself was pressing in on me. 

But as quickly as I looked around, the fleeting panic faded. My paranoia refused to settle, but when I realized there truly was nothing there, I relaxed a little.

*Just your imagination…getting worked up over nothing.*

I avoided the steps entirely after that. Even looking at them made my stomach turn.

I followed a small dirt path away from the large rock, the same way I remembered approaching as a kid. The forest was much less dense up here, and it felt completely different from the thick greenery toward the base. The ground was almost entirely covered in dried pine needles and rocky outcroppings.

It didn’t just look different up here. It felt different. The energy in the air felt slightly charged, like the buildup before a lightning storm, but the sky remained soft and blue. The air felt alive—aware. 

I was lost in this trance for a moment, staring off into the trees. Finally, I snapped out of it. 

I didn’t come up here to reminisce in the woods. I was here to find that sign. 

I spun around and saw the faded yellow peering out from behind a branch about 100 feet away. Exactly like I had remembered it. Like it had been waiting. 

I made my way over to the shoddy marker and knelt down in front of it. The paint flaked and chipped, but the words were still clear:

“CAUTION. THIS AREA PATROLLED BY SENTRY DOGS.”

*Was it attached to a tree?* *No, there was no bark.* 

A slender wooden post reached up into the sky a few feet over my head before a sharp crack indicated its fate. I glanced behind it but saw nothing. 

*A telephone pole? Where’s the top?* 

I leaned back and looked around. 

Behind me, there were no signs of any other poles, fences, or anything, for that matter. 

The other way proved more promising. Maybe 150 feet away, I saw exactly what I was looking for. Another stripped log stood out amongst the pines. 

So I followed them.
