It was a rainy Friday evening, and I found myself at my favorite coffee shop, trying to escape the dreariness of the world outside. The warm light and the smell of coffee wrapped around me like a blanket. I was engrossed in my book when the door swung open, and a chill swept through the place.

In walked a man who looked completely out of place. He wore a long, tattered trench coat, his hair wild and unkempt. His eyes seemed to hold a darkness that made my skin crawl. He caught my gaze and smiled—a wide, unsettling grin that sent a shiver down my spine. It was like he knew something I didn’t.

After ordering a drink, he took the seat next to mine. I tried to ignore him and focus on my book, but I could feel his eyes on me. Finally, he leaned in close, his voice barely above a whisper. “You know, this café is a hotspot for time travelers.”

I chuckled nervously, thinking he was just a quirky guy. “Time travelers? Seriously?”

He didn’t laugh. Instead, he nodded gravely, scanning the room. “You just have to know how to spot them. Like her.” He gestured toward a woman in the corner, dressed in a flapper-style dress that looked straight out of the 1920s. She was tapping her foot, lost in a rhythm that didn’t belong in this time.

I glanced over, a sense of unease creeping in. “What about you?” I asked, trying to keep my tone light. “You from the future?”

He leaned even closer, his breath cold against my ear. “Let’s just say I’ve seen things that would make you question everything. But I’m here for a reason.” He looked at his watch—an ancient, ticking piece that seemed to echo in the silence of the café. “I have to warn you. I don’t have much time left.”

My heart raced. “Warn me about what?”

“People don’t realize how precious time is until it’s too late. There are forces at work here, unseen and powerful.” He straightened up, eyes darting to the door. “You need to be careful.”

Suddenly, he stood up, adjusting his coat like he was preparing for a storm. “Remember: every moment counts.” He shot me a final, haunting smile and stepped out into the rain.

I sat there, frozen. Was he serious? Was he really a time traveler, or just a madman? I could feel the weight of his words settling in my chest. I looked at the woman in the corner, and she caught my eye, her expression blank and eerie.

The next morning, I woke up to a world that felt different. My phone buzzed with notifications—everyone I knew was talking about the mysterious disappearances happening in the city. People had vanished without a trace, leaving behind only confusion and fear.

And that’s when it hit me. What if he was right? What if time really was slipping away, and I was next? Now, every time I sip coffee at that café, I look over my shoulder, half-expecting to see him again, warning me to cherish every second before it’s too late.
