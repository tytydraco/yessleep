 The address led me across town, away from the neighborhood I was familiar with and out to another commercially zoned area. Municipal buildings, Utility depots, and offices with names so generic they faded from memory the moment you drove by. 

 It was late in the morning, around nine-thirty. The sun was up now, bright golden rays without a cloud in the sky. The kind of day I used to enjoy, back when good weather meant a good day to be out for a walk. 

I was overdressed, and I knew it the moment I stepped out of the car.

 Button-up shirt. Tie loosened, but still there. A pair of old leather dress boots I only wore when I wanted to look a bit more put together. The hard leather soles tapped louder than I liked against the pavement, announcing my presence. Coat on with the collar popped up. Hat set just right. 

My suit of Armor. Only now missing my shield.

 The main building itself didn’t stand out. Two stories. Beige painted metal siding exterior. Narrow windows that reflected the sky rather than offer a view inside. It sat on a modest lot with parking spaces up front, a few smaller matching structures and a route to the back of the buildings. There were at least three cameras I could spot from this vantage. A small sign near the door read Regional Environmental Services, a kind of name I should be familiar with but never had any contact with through the department. 

 The area was dressed up just like the radio station. Some construction fencing, orange cones and a metal storage trailer. Enough detail to say "Renovations, keep out" but not clutter the property. 

 I stood there in the sunlight, hands in my pockets, eyes narrowed under the brim of my hat. The whole lot seemed quiet, as intended. I half expected a tumbleweed to roll by. 

 A short series of metallic pings echoed from around the side caught my ears. 

 As I walked around the corner an electricians van came into view, the side door rolled open with a man kneeling close to the wall working on what appeared to be an electrical panel. He noticed my steps but didn't turn from his work as I tapped my way slowly up to him. 

 He wore overalls. Tools stuffed into the pockets. His hands were busy with pliers and some wiring connected to the wall through grey conduit. He certainly looked the part of an electrician. 

He spoke with an Irish accent, "Ah, Mister Wolfe, is it?" 

I didn't bother asking how he knew my name. 

"Yeah?" 

"They told me to keep an eye out for you. Head on inside the front door. They're expectin ya." 

 I walked back to the front. A narrow door with blinds behind the glass stood before me. I paused before going in. It almost felt like I was walking in to a job interview. 

 The lobby inside was boring. Neutral color palette for the walls and carpet floors. It smelled like cheap dollar store air freshener. A reception desk sat empty in the center, a hallway on the left, a door on the right. 

 Through the hall emerged the man from the bar who left me his card, jacket off and sleeves rolled up. 

"I see you made it," He said stopping several feet from me, "I wasn't sure you would come." He sized me up, "Nice noir vibe." 

 I noticed new details now that I had missed previously. He was built well, strong jaw. Professional posture. Dog tags hung around his neck. Ex-military maybe? 

"I have questions." I stated, "You seem to have the answers I need." 

He cracked a sly smile "Perhaps I do. Come with me." 

 I followed just behind him. Somehow my boots sounded too loud here as well, as if the carpet was fresh from the factory and barely tread on. 

 He led me to a room at the middle of the hallway on the left. Inside, sunlight poured through the two tall windows on the back wall casting a warm glow. The room was clean and tidy. A white fridge sat against the corner next to a short run of kitchen style cabinets. A long table with chairs in the middle. Obviously a break room. 

 A man stood at the counter in front of a coffee pot, pouring into a mug. Mid-fifties, maybe. Gray at the temples. Salt and pepper beard. Charcoal suit that framed him well. His posture was straight but not stiff, like someone who was trying to conserve energy. 

He turned to face me as we walked in, setting the pot back in place. 

“Detective Wolfe,” he said, extending a hand. “Thank you for coming.” 

I glanced down at the gesture, then met his eyes and nodded. 

He withdrew his hand. “Fair enough.” 

He grabbed his coffee and we sat. 

 I chose a chair that put my back to the windows. The sunlight bounced off the opposite wall, brightening up the space. It was almost peaceful. Almost. 

 The man kept one hand on the mug and gestured with the other while resting his forearm on the edge of the table. 

“I’m Director Mason. This is my Operations Manager, Mr. Ward. Thank you for accepting the invitation.” 

No first names. Figures. 

“I’ll get straight to the point,” he continued. 

“You have questions. A lot of them. And you’ve earned some answers.” 

I leaned back, crossing my arms. “Earned how?” 

“You followed a path no one else could see,” he said calmly. “You kept going despite the evidence, or lack of it. And when things went wrong, you didn’t freeze." 

"You survived." 

The word felt heavier than it should have. 

 I glanced briefly at Ward standing just behind mason, his shoulders rested and his hands clasped together behind his back. He said nothing. Just watched. 

“You knew about the radio station,” I said. “You knew before we did.” 

Mason inclined his head. “Yes, one of our listening posts. We detected it the same moment you did.” 

“And you let us walk into it.” 

“We monitored it,” he corrected. 

“Intervention too early can destabilize situations like that.” 

“Situations?” I repeated flatly. 

“Yes.” 

I leaned forward, dropping the brim of my hat slightly. “My partner is missing.” 

He didn’t flinch. “I know.” 

Mason chose his next words carefully. “You both encountered an event we were unable to reverse in time.” 

Unable. Or unwilling? I thought to myself. 

I swallowed. My throat felt tight, but my voice stayed steady. “You’re saying he’s dead?” 

“I’m afraid so." Mason replied. 

“What about the others?” I asked. “The hikers. The hunters. Ethan.” 

At the name, Mason’s eyes flicked to Ward for half a second. Then back to me. 

“Most are casualties,” he said. “Some are variables. Like yourself.” 

 No comforting lies. No reassurances. So far, it all felt like honesty. Or at least he believed what he was saying. 

Finally, he spoke again. “The world functions because most people never see where it doesn’t. Where the rules stop working.” 

I frowned. “You’re going to have to do better than that.” 

He nodded, accepting the challenge. “There are places,” he said, “Where physical laws behave inconsistently. Sound. Matter. Time. These locations appear, fluctuate, and sometimes degrade on their own.” 

“And sometimes,” I said, “they don’t.” 

“Correct.” 

 I thought of the tunnel. The silence. The way the sound had simply, stopped. 

“You call them, what?” I asked. 

“Disturbances. Anomalies." He replied. “We catalog the conditions. Record their locations. We mitigate the outcomes.” 

“Mitigate?”

A brief pause. 

“We contain them. Stabilize the disturbance. Neutralize the threats.” 

I let out a breath through my nose. “You’re telling me my city has holes in it, and you guys are plugging the holes?” 

“I’m telling you,” he said evenly, “that reality isn’t as uniform as we pretend it is. In some places it has cracks. We find and repair those cracks.” 

 The sunlight shifted as a cloud passed overhead, dimming the room just slightly. I leaned back into the chair slowly. For a moment I just sat there, contemplating what he had told me. The air conditioning vent hummed overhead of us. 

“Why tell me any of this?” I asked finally. 

Mason met my gaze without hesitation. “Because you’re going to keep looking, whether we help you or not.” 

“Is that a threat?” 

“A recognition.” 

Ward spoke up for the first time. “You already stepped through the door, Derrick. We’re just offering you an opportunity. A chance to find the end of the trail with us.” 

 I looked between them. Two men. Calm. Certain. Dangerous in the quietest way possible. 

“And if I say no?” I asked. 

Mason smiled then. A short, tired smile. “Then you go back to being a very observant man with no authority, no protection, and a habit of walking into places that don't leave witnesses.” 

He let that sit, silence between us for a moment. 

"I am sorry about your partner." He said, at last with a softer tone. 

He leaned in closer "You have a particularly valuable set of skills and a sharp eye, detective. We’d prefer to give you context. Resources, and a chance to do some good for the people you care about.” 

 I stared at the table, at the untouched coffee, at the way the sunlight made everything look deceptively normal. 

“Let’s say I listen,” I said. “What does that make me?” 

Mason’s answer was immediate. “An investigator,” He said. “Just operating on a different scale.” 

I exhaled slowly. 

 Outside, somewhere beyond the windows, the city went on with its morning. People walking dogs. Traffic lights cycling. Life behaving. 

 But right here at this moment, the truth waited with bated breath. I had lost my career, lost my partner, lost all of my momentum. What else did I have to lose? 

"Okay," I finally said 

Mason nodded. "Okay." 

He stood slowly, coffee in hand, finally taking a sip and exhaling. "When you're ready, come to the end of the hall." He gestured to the coffee pot "Help yourself, if you like." 

 The two men exited the room, leaving me alone with my thoughts. If I had any at all. Anomalies? Reality not behaving? What on earth had I gotten myself into. 

 I made my way down the hall and opened the door. I don't know what I expected but it certainly wasn't what I found. The room extended the height of the full building and the rest of its length. Steel beams supported the shell of the structure. LED light fixtures hung from the ceiling.  

 The room was filled with crates, equipment chests both opened and sealed. Some of the equipment was large pieces I couldn't identify. Folding tables set up as desks with laptops. In the far back of the room sat a few enclosed trailers adjacent to the wall. Personnel walked here and there or sat busy with their tasks. 

 In the very center of the room was a wall of flat-screen TV's, six of them in a grid. Each one displayed various lines of information, open file windows, and the same program I saw at the radio station. Standing before them now was Mr. Ward, speaking into a headset, half addressing the room and whoever else might be on the other end. 

 I stared at it all, sticking out like a sore thumb in the middle of the scene. No one hurried me along. No one stared. That almost made it worse. I was used to grabbing some attention when I entered a room, but here, the work just kept going. Whatever this place was, it didn’t revolve around me. 

 I felt less like a knight in play and more like a pawn that still hadn't crossed the board. 

“Don’t worry,” Spoke the Irish voice behind me. “Everyone looks like they walked into the wrong building their first time.” 

He stood beside me wiping his hands on a rag. 

“Workshop’s a mess,” he added. “But that means things are working.” 

He reached a somewhat clean hand over to me. "Name's Declan Rourke. Engineer" 

I shook his hand, but before I could respond, a woman's voice cut in from my right. 

“You must be Wolfe.” 

I turned. 

 She was leaning against one of the folding tables, arms crossed. Mid thirties. Athletic build. Dark blazer over a fitted shirt, no tie, no visible weapon, though I had no doubt she was carrying. Her posture was relaxed, but her eyes were sharp, appraising without being obvious. 

“Samantha Hale,” she said, pushing off the table and offering her hand. “Former FBI, Current problem-solver.” 

Her grip was firm. Not a dominance thing, just confidence. 

“Detective,” I said out of habit. 

She smiled slightly. “Used to be.” 

 Behind her, obscured slightly by one of the laptops, a younger man sat studying whatever was on its screen. He didn’t look up right away. 

“Resonance drift is off by half a percent,” he muttered, more to himself than anyone else. “That’s not noise, That’s...” 

He stopped mid-thought, finally noticing me. “Oh. Hello.” 

 He pushed his chair back and stood, stretching like he’d been there a while. Early twenties. Hoodie under a tactical vest. Messy hair, tired eyes, but alert. Maybe one too many energy drinks. 

“Noah,” He said, nodding once. “I'm the eyes in the sky and gear on the ground.” He said pointing up to the screens. 

 I glanced at the wall of monitors again. Same interface. Same pulsing quadrants. Same quiet sense that something was always being watched. 

“That program,” I said. “Did You build it?” 

Noah grimaced. “No, some overpaid nerds in an IT office are responsible for that. I just get it to work when we need it." 

A laugh came from behind us in the room. “Don’t let him undersell himself. This guy is brilliant with software.” 

 A man approached having come from near the trailers, carrying a box that made noise like it was full of bolts. He set it down, dusted off his hands, and looked at me with open curiosity. He seemed to be mid to early thirties. About my height. Lean. Practical. The kind of guy who looked comfortable anywhere. 

“Chris Owens,” he said. “Field support. Logistics. And bad ideas consultant.” 

I raised an eyebrow. 

He grinned. “I’m the one who gets sent across the frying pan to pull you out of the fire.” 

 There was something familiar there. Not the face, but the way he studied me and the space itself. Like it was a puzzle begging to be solved. 

Samantha followed my gaze to the trailers and stacked equipment. “You’ll notice we don’t sit around waiting for alarms,” she said. “Gear stays packed. Data stays live. If something happens, we move. Whether it's day to day ops, or if we need to pack up the whole site, Its ready to go.” 

“And if nothing happens?” I asked.

 

“Then we wait, and we watch. Get to work as the reports come.” 

Declan snorted from behind us. “Comforting, isn’t it?”

 

 I took another slow look around the room. The crates. The equipment. The people moving with purpose but without panic. This wasn’t a think tank. It wasn’t a strike team either. It was something in between. I adjusted the brim of my hat, suddenly feeling like I was the one out of place. 

“So,” I said. “How have I never noticed you before? I've been a detective here for years and never had so much as a whisper of 'secret ops'." 

Samantha smiled, then spoke first "That means our covers are working. Also, we've only recently been operating in this sector. We were further south until about four months ago."  

Noah shrugged. “People see what they want to see. Old warehouses. Maintenance crews. Utility vehicles coming and going.” 

Chris added, “And if someone looks too close, there’s paperwork. Permits. Inspections. The whole boring paper trail.” 

Samantha finished the thought.

“We don’t hide,” she said. “We blend in.” 

I exhaled slowly. This wasn’t a one-off operation. This was infrastructure. A carefully planned effort. 

“And me?” I asked. “Where do I fit in?” 

Samantha smiled again, but this time there was something heavier behind it. "Each team has investigative assignments along with our usual tasks." 

She paused for a second. 

“You ask the right questions.” she said.

“You look deeper when the answers don’t add up. Those instincts will help you here.” 

 Ward had quietly approached us. He stepped in beside me like he’d been there the whole time. Same face from the bar. Same calm, unreadable expression. No disguise, unless you counted being forgettable as one. 

“Welcome to the ANCR,” he said simply. “Anomalous National Containment Response. Or just 'Anchor' as it sounds." 

He paused then added "When the storm comes and rocks the world, we are the anchor that holds fast." 

 After the mission statement rolled out, I realized then that I wasn’t standing in the middle of a workplace. I was standing at the edge of a war I hadn’t known existed. 

“You’ll be attached to Hale’s team, Alpha team.” he continued, nodding toward Samantha. “They’re short one member. You will make their fourth. We all wear multiple hats, but with your skills, primarily situational awareness and investigative support will be your role, for now.” 

 No one reacted. Not a glance. Not a flinch. That told me more than any file ever could. 

I didn’t hesitate. “So, where do I get started?” 

Ward nodded once, like that was the only acceptable response. 

“Owens, let's get our detective some new gear. Hale, I have a new round of disturbances for your team to evaluate for containment. Night shift's report came back with new locations in the Northern quadrant.” He handed her a tablet mid-sentence. 

"I knew it." Noah said 

Chris was already moving. 

“Come on, Wolfe,” he said over his shoulder. “Let’s get you something that bites back.” 

 We stepped out through a side bay door and into the yard behind the building. The sun was high now, bright enough to hurt if you weren’t used to looking at it. A few service vehicles were parked around, utility vans, pickup trucks, a few SUVs. Only a huge forklift really stood out. Part of the construction cover I guessed,  but still useful. 

 Then there was the trailer. One of two that sat parallel to each other. 

 It was a large white box. Long, double axel. Scuffed like it had lived a hard life. A bland landscaping logo was slapped on the side, green leaf, block lettering, and a phone number no one would ever answer. 

Chris slapped the side of it affectionately. “Mobile armory,” he said. “Or lawn care. Depends who’s asking.” 

 He unlocked it and pulled the door open. The inside didn’t match the outside. 

 There was indeed a stand-up mower along with a string trimmer and edger in the back, but the rest was very much an armory. Rifle racks. Foam-lined cases. Weapon lockers secured to the wall. Drawers of optics, lights, suppressors, tools I didn’t have names for. Vests and uniform gear. Everything was clean, organized, and designed for fast hands under pressure. 

“Department issue stays with the department,” Chris said. “ANCR issue stays with you.” 

I glanced down at my empty holster instinctively. 

“No badge?” I asked 

He grinned and opened a long, flat drawer from the cabinet wall. "Any shield you need." 

 There was an array of different badges from nearly every law enforcement service including mine. Local PD, sheriff, game warden, FBI, CIA. 

 I picked up the one from my local department and rubbed my thumb over the silver metal. Nostalgia gripped at my heart. 

Chris noticed the glint in my eye. 

"You know.. out there a badge can get you where others can't, but not always where you need to be. Here, you can be whatever you need to be to go wherever you need to." He said. 

 I held the badge affectionately in my palm for a moment. For ten years It used to be my shield against crime and criminals, my key of authority to get into rooms and situations that needed me. Now it felt like it had no weight. I gently placed it back in the drawer. 

"Here, let's get you a proper firearm, detective." 

He pulled one from a case and handed it to me. 

 A new revolver. It was heavier than my old one. Slightly longer barrel. Straighter lines. Boxier frame with a shined metal finish. A simple modern aesthetic. 

 The cylinder locked with a solid, reassuring click. Mounted on top was a squared compact red-dot sight, low profile. Under the barrel, a small weapon light mounted cleanly onto the barrel flush with the trigger guard. Complete with a comfortable wooden handle of warm chestnut. 

I brought it up instinctively, sighting downrange. 

“It's comfortable. Feels right.” I said. 

Chris smiled. “Good.” 

 He retrieved another piece of gear from a smaller case and held it up for me. “You’ll also get a comm unit,” he added. “Connected to our network. The channels work just like a radio.” 

 I paused, taking the device then asked the question that had been sitting on my chest since Mr. Ward spoke. 

“The last guy,” I said. “What happened to him?” 

Chris didn’t look at me right away. He busied himself locking the case back up. 

“He was a good man, good investigator,” he said finally. “Picked up on the details and lead us to the right clues.” 

I waited. 

“He just followed them a little too close to the wrong place.” 

 That was all he said. It was very vague, as if he knew more to the story but just wasn't his place to tell it. 

 I holstered the revolver, the weight settling against my side in a way that felt familiar and reassuring. As we stepped back out into the sunlight, the trailer door clanged shut behind us, the landscaping logo once again guarding the arsenal. 

 Chris stood beside me, eyes scanning the area, then me. 

“Welcome to the team." 

 I looked back toward the building, at the quiet activity, the screens, the people preparing for things no one else sees, no one knew existed. 

I thought of Paul. 

Of Ethan. 

“Yeah,” I said. “Feels like I'm finally on the right trail.”

 It was then that I noticed Noah and Samantha loading some gear crates into the back of a green pickup truck with a camper top over the bed. 4x4 stamped next to a worn Forestry Services logo. 

 Samantha stepped over to us, now wearing a light green jacket, her dark hair brushed back under a ball cap. Easily readable as a park ranger or forestry officer at first glance. 

"We're loaded up and ready to go." She said, then turned her gaze to me. "Hope you brought your bug spray. We're heading to some familiar territory, for you." 

 A slight unease settled on me. Not that I wasn't familiar with any of the forested areas surrounding all sides of my city, but now after being inserted into their operations and everything I've experienced in the last days, a trip in the woods felt like unknown territory now. 

Chris tapped my shoulder as he walked by, "You can ride shotgun." 

 We climbed in, Samantha in the drivers seat, and we pulled out of the lot headed Northwest. She didn't say, but I had a hunch we were headed for the foothills of the mountains. It was confirmed once we made the right turns and passed the signage taking us that way. 

 It had been a point of interest before for me, back when I was working the trails and cases out in the parks for the department. Now I felt like the new kid on the block, the rookie ready to be tossed into the deep end of some new adventure into the unknown. 

 This time however, I felt like I had a sense of direction, not just lost at dead ends. This time I had fresh eyes and a different perspective that hopefully will render the forest's secrets from the quiet pines at the edge of my little world.
