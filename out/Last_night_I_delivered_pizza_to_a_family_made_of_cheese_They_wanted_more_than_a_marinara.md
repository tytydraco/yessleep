I delivered pizza for most of my twenties, and I was ready to move onto more fruitful pastures for a long time. I just never imagined the deciding factor would be the horror that I’d witness at the Graham residence.
  

  
Their house stands at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac, enveloped by the shade of surrounding oak trees. In hindsight, there was something unnerving about that place — that entire street. The silence. But I didn’t think about it at the time.
  

  
“Hello?” I shouted.
  

  
I’d been knocking on the front door for a solid three or four minutes with no response. And then I heard a squelching noise. At first, the sickening sound churned my gut, but that feeling quickly morphed into fear as rubbery footsteps approached the door. I didn’t know why, but my instincts were shrieking at me to run.
  

  
Suddenly, I faintly distinguished the shape of a large person through the door’s frosted window. And then the latch clicked. The blackened shape didn’t budge.
  

  
“Did you order a marinara?” I fearfully yelled, voice breaking.
  

  
The bulging head of the obscenely enormous figure swung up and down. I took that as confirmation, but the family member didn’t open the door. They baffled me by turning and disappearing into the house.
  

  
Now, I know this was stupid, but I wrapped my shaking fingers around the handle and tentatively eased the door open. The figure unlocked the latch before walking away, so I assumed they were inviting me inside.
  

  
“Hello?” I shouted again from the gloomy, unlit lobby. “I’ve got a marina for Mr Graham. I need payment…”
  

  
A squishing sound from the dining room interrupted me. I twisted my head to the left and gulped, shuffling towards the room with timid footsteps. I kept thinking about the customer who once complained to my manager that I didn’t give him time to collect the pizza, even though I’d been knocking for seven minutes. I didn’t want to get scolded again, no matter how unsettling the situation seemed.
  

  
“I just need somebody to pay,” I quivered, standing in the dining room.
  

  
Streetlights partly illuminated the room through tall windows, and it was absolutely filthy. Flies hovered above precarious stacks of plates on the dining table. Scraps of indistinguishable food festered within a mound of numerous ancient feasts. There were plenty of pizza crusts, but some of the food remnants were harder to identify.
  

  
A light flicked to life in the kitchen, and the sudden sound of running water surprisingly settled my erratic heartbeat. It seemed ordinary. The tap added normalcy to the house of horrors.
  

  
“Mr Graham,” I said, striding confidently from the dining room to the kitchen. “You need to pay for the pizza before I leave.”
  

  
I entered the kitchen and rounded the corner to face the source of running water. And that was when I finally saw one of the Graham family members in the flesh. I screamed because I wasn’t seeing flesh at all — the young child’s form was composed of what appeared to be Brie, judging by his melting complexion.
  

  
He instantly turned off the tap and began to twist his head, cheesy appendages oozing onto the tiled kitchen floor. Shivering uncontrollably, I looked down and noticed that there were cheese trails everywhere. But that didn’t horrify me as much as the face I saw when I looked up again.
  

  
The boy’s facial features were almost non-existent. His eyes were yellow spheres that lacked pupils, and his mouth was a lipless pit that gaped to reveal a void in the heart of his Brie body. The popping noises he uttered, upon seeing me, were the most terrifying things I’ve ever heard. A bubbling broth. It sounded as if he were melting in an oven.
  

  
I couldn’t speak. I dropped the pizza onto the tiles and frightfully backed out of the kitchen. The boy glanced down at the cardboard box, then he glanced up at me. There was the briefest moment of calmness before he shrieked like an over-boiled pot, flailing towards me with cheesy, outstretched arms.
  

  
I screamed and fled into the dining room, eyeing the doorway to the lobby. Only twenty yards to the front door. That was all I could think. When I reached the entryway, however, a shadow slid in front of the door’s frosted window.
  

  
The father.
  

  
His frothing screech was cacophonous, and his form was humongous in comparison to his son. He started to slump towards me, slapping his Brie feet against the cheese-covered carpet. Terrified beyond measure, I snapped my head to the doorway which led into the living room, and I beelined towards it.
  

  
The father marched maliciously towards me, and I eyed the grand windows overlooking the driveway. It was the easiest exit route. As I scooped a heavy ornament from the coffee table, a rocking chair in the corner of the lounge caught my attention.
  

  
I expected to see a cheese-formed mother staring back at me, but the dim streetlight revealed something far more harrowing — a skeleton. Drunk from a cocktail of terror and adrenaline, I tossed the ornament at the lounge window, and a resounding smash shattered one of the panes into hundreds of pieces. At that moment, the father slithered through one lounge doorway, and his son slithered through the other.
  

  
Screaming, I barrelled towards the shattered window and clambered through it. I could taste freedom, but my trouser leg got caught on a protruding shard, and I cried at the blazing pain of glass gashing my skin. Still, seeing those two Brie abominations lurching through the darkness, I realised there were horrors worse than my injury. I tore my leg free, removing a hefty chunk of flesh with it, and screeched as I hobbled across the driveway.
  

  
I leapt into my car and headed home. Fuck my shift. I resigned immediately. The worst part was cleaning my shoes afterwards. The cheese wouldn’t come off. I don’t know what I brought back with me, but I burnt my clothes before I could figure that out.
  

  
I know I escaped, but I don’t feel safe. I’ve spent all day checking my body in the mirror. I’m terrified that I might find a lump of Brie in place of my skin.
