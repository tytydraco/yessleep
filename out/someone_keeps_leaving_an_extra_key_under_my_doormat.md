Someone is leaving a key under my doormat. Every single time I get rid of it, it comes right back, as though nothing happened. I’ve tried everything to dispose of it. Throwing it in the lake by my house, tossing it in a neighbor’s trash can, or even hiding it in my car. The next day, without fail, it’s always back, right under the front mat, just like it was before.

At first, I thought it was just some corny prank, maybe different keys each time. But after I took a photo of one key and threw it away, I found a new one the very next day that was exactly the same as the one in the picture. It was the same key. The same shape, the same worn edges, everything. It felt like a twisted game, one I didn’t want to play anymore.

I don’t know who’s doing this, and I don’t know why they’re doing it. But I can’t let it go. The unease gnaws at me, and I’m starting to feel like I’m losing control of the situation. I had no choice but to make an attempt to leave it alone for a while. The anxiety was slowly wearing me thin, and I didn’t want it to interfere with my work or my daily routine. So, I tried to focus on my job and let the paranoia simmer in the background. But it just started creeping in again, little by little. I found myself checking the locks before I left in the mornings, and, more unsettling, checking under the mat every time I got home. I couldn’t shake the thought that someone, somewhere, was watching me—waiting for something.

The first night alone after I put the issue out of my mind was, at first, typical. I scrolled through social media, made some dinner, checked my work emails, and let the dogs out for a while. But as I lay in bed later that night, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. Something was off, and I couldn’t put my finger on it. My house didn’t feel like my own anymore. It was like an invisible presence had settled in, something I couldn’t explain. I thought about it for a while and realized that if they’re leaving keys under my doormat right next to my home key, then they know exactly how to get in my house. They’ve been inside, and they know it.

Now, I couldn’t even bring myself to retrieve the key from outside. I locked my bedroom door, huddled under the covers, and tried to sleep, hoping I could just shut the thought out of my mind for a little while.

The dogs were perched at the edge of the bed, staring out the window into the rain. Their eyes were wide, unblinking, and alert, as if they knew something I didn’t. The silence in the room grew heavy, the kind of silence that presses in from all sides. I sat there, motionless, in complete silence for what felt like an eternity—twenty minutes, maybe more—just caught in my own thoughts, before I finally turned off the lights and tried to drift off into sleep.

12 AM. I wake up to the soft sound of my dog whimpering beside me. I turn over to look at him, but he’s still asleep, lying perfectly still.

2 AM. I wake again, this time to the rhythmic sound of rain hitting the window. I drift back to sleep.

4 AM. A soft scraping sound—faint, almost imperceptible—drifts up the stairs. It’s a chair being moved across the kitchen floor.

I’m not alone anymore.
