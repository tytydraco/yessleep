The Sisters of Perdition

I work at a construction company and we are renovating this old monastery into a library. The last of the monks decided to sell the building for money and the state of Tennessee bought it to make it a heritage site. There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While renovating the building we found a secret room! And guess what was in it? More books! I even found a journal from Dora. After reading it I found this part particularly fascinating and wanted to share it.  




It was the end of winter in the year 2000, my name is Dora Debwood and I live in a small town in rural New Brunswick.   

At the end of last summer, my daughter Deb and her two current children moved here from Toronto.  

This was her second batch of children, we had programmed the first two from birth to commit the unpardonable sin so that we could feed them to our god, Saren. 
 
We had even programmed one so good we managed to get him to sleep with Deb.
  
We had thought that our god would ascend to true godhood when he ate the second of two children, but he did not. He had said that Deb’s son would be the reincarnation of Julius Caesar, the one he had to eat and we were surprised when the first batch didn’t work out.  

But we now had two more candidates. Deb had been programming them from birth, but I was the more powerful witch and I would be needed to complete the spell.  

They were coming over to our house later today to do some programming and I was ecstatic. I had stage 4 cancer and unless we could do this quickly I would die. 

When they arrived that Saturday morning everything was in place. Deb and her husband, Dale, and her children, Sean and Scott were sitting watching TV while my husband Carl and I stood behind the couch watching them, watch cartoons.  

Carl was going to show Scott and Dale the chainsaw he had sawed the others up with while me and Deb put the spell on Sean.  

“Hey Dale, why don’t you and the young feller come outside and see old faithful?” Carl beckoned.  

Dale got Scott and they all left. It was now just me and Deb with Sean. I took the remote and flicked on the VCR. The screen changed to a video of Sean being born, and me and Deb chanted our spell.   

Sean was distraught. “This isn’t a cartoon… Mom, why are we watching a black kid being born?”  

Deb responded with a calculated venom “No Sean this is you.” 
 
Sean watched in a trance while we put the spell on him. 
 
We had put this on Deb’s two previous children and it worked like a charm. Whenever he felt feminine energy he would get angry and if his Jesus was a woman, it would almost ensure a quick unpardonable sin.  

After the spell was done Deb and her family went home and me and Carl went to our camp on the lake. We loved it here, there was no one around other than the lady of the lake.  

She was a tiny little land octopus that lived in the lake and she had eaten everyone we had killed so far.  

I sat in a chair on the beach as night fell and I saw her light in the water. I looked at her big eyes and needle-like teeth that glowed from under the water. 
 
‘We will have more food for you soon, my queen’ I thought to her.
  
She looked back ecstatic. She was clearly hungry. 
 
When I awoke the next morning I communed with Saren. 
 
‘As long as that child commits the unpardonable sin, sometime in his life the spell will work and I can eat him’ I heard the draconic voice in my head.  

All plans were go, me and Carl headed back to the house to prepare. Sean would stay with us tonight and not go to school tomorrow. Sean would be locked in the basement and then Saren would be able to eat him. I would tell my 3 daughters the plan when they arrived later. The promised time had come. Saren would reach godhood. 
 
When the three of them filed in we all looked at each other in silence. I was about to start explaining the plan when I heard a voice in my head.  

‘I am Yahweh.’ 
 
I was alarmed but kept my composure. ‘Begone false god, I have negated the unpardonable sin I committed against my brother, by having him commit it against his next Jesus. I am safe! BEGONE’  

‘Oh no Dora. You’re done. Saren forgot to tell you something. That child that you were about to sacrifice? He’s a savior, that means anyone can commit the unpardonable sin against him. And guess what, I looked at the future and you don’t get him. He fights the negative energy and stops himself before it’s too late.’ Yahweh cackled.  

Just then Deb, Die and Carla’s heads all started to slowly turn around.  

“What have you done to my daughters?!?!?” I screamed. 
 
‘Oh It’s what I’ve done to you that should concern you. I just had your body give in to the cancer. You’re already dead.’ Yahweh cackled.  

My 3 daughters all ran towards me and grabbed me.  

“The tarantula hawk fairy will have her way with you” Deb chided.  

“What’s going on? How is this happening?” I screamed.  

‘That’s the thing you people don’t seem to get.’ Yahweh cackled. ‘When it really comes down to it it’s just you and me in here. And I am all powerful. People like you, the ones who commit the unpardonable sin all on their own, without any programming or such nonsense. I like to put you in pocket dimensions and have fun with you when I kill you.’  

My daughters carried me outside and there was a tiny little cage there. They locked me in it and stood staring at me until sundown. Once the sun went down and I tried to go to sleep Deb started poking me with a fork. 
 
“Stop! I am your mother!” I cried. 
 
Deb just stared at me. She waited until I was about to fall asleep again and then poked me again.  

I cried and tried to bargain but they wouldn’t listen. They took shifts poking me for days and on the forth morning I heard Yahweh’s voice again.
  
‘I am your doom mortal.’ Yahweh cackled. ‘I have watched you for lifetimes just waiting for you to screw up. You deserve my congratulations really, the fact that you got away with this for so long and that it took a changeling to bring you justice. But the jig’s up now. ‘  

“Saren! Saren?” I screamed. “Stop this monster and prove your worth!” 
 
I saw a large red dragon head appear beside me more clearly than I had ever seen it.  
‘All I can really do is bite you’ he said with a smile.   

Before I could even respond he chomped on my soul and I felt immeasurable pain energy flowing through my whole body. All I could do was scream.  

What brought me back from the pain, days later, was noticing that I was inside a glass bubble of some kind. On the inside reality was being projected, and everything that had once seemed real now seemed fake. On the other side of the bubble was what really seemed real.  

It was a barren wasteland of red soil. The sky was clouded with volcanic ash and there were volcanoes erupting in the distance. Hundreds of horned, slender men with maces and clubs bashed on the outside of the bubble. They eyed me hungrily with their red eyes.  

‘Welcome to your new home!’ Yahweh cackled.  

“Stop!” I begged. “I can’t deserve this! This can’t be real!” 
 
‘Oh it is real’ Yahweh said. ‘This is actually the real world. We just put you prisoners in these ridiculous simulations with your peers.’  

“Spare me!” I begged “You're good aren't you?! You can’t do this to me!”  

‘Yeah I am good.‘ Yahweh cackled. ‘That’s why I deal with people like you and spare those like the children you had commit the unpardonable sin. We’ve got a whole section of the simulation for it. And that’s the thing, I’m not quite ready to send you to outer darkness just yet. I just wanted to show you something.’ 
 
“What! What! You terrible monster!” I screamed.
  
‘My ship.’ Yahweh cackled. ‘The one your master, Saren, tried to steal from me.’ 
 
All of a sudden the ashy sky cleared and giant golden cube floated in space. 
  
“That can’t be your ship it's bigger than the death star” I screamed. 
 
‘Oh yeah. It’s way bigger than the death star. The measurements in revelation are accurate.’ Yahweh cackled. ‘And the weapons on this thing make even your science fiction seem hilariously primitive. Blowing up a planet? What a fucking joke. If you flew the millennium falcon into a planet at light speed it would blow the whole thing up.’  

I gazed in awe and pain at the ship. I started crying again. 
 
The red dragon head appeared again and Saren spoke. ‘Don’t take this personally, I tell all the women who worship me I’m going to make them my bride, and then eat them instead. I told Cleopatra the same thing, and the exact same thing is going to happen to her. So know that in this immeasurable pain I’m about to give you, that you are at least not alone.’  

Saren stopped talking and then started biting my soul repeatedly. I was in immeasurable pain and lost all sense of time and self.  

I just laid there as the shadowy figures outside the bubble started to crack the outside. The hologram was so weak it was hardly there when I heard Yahweh one last time.  

‘I would let you go to outer darkness right now, but there is something I want to do to you first.’ Yahweh cackled. ‘I’m going to send you to my fun-house, the land of the unpardonable sin. Sadly though, it’s only really fun for me and my angels. The people down there are our guinea pigs for whatever we want to do to them. And that's the thing, after Julius Caesar earns his wings I’m going to have him kill you and your accomplices over and over again. While he redeems one by one all the children that you have made commit the unpardonable sin. And when we are done and those children go back up to hell, then I’ll let Saren eat your soul and send you to outer darkness. For now you're getting Judas-ed.’ 
 
And with that my guts exploded from my body and my consciousness was able to rest in death.  



I am a monk who lives at a monastery in rural Tennessee. I wrote the preceding story when a gold dragon told me that if I did not, that I would be sent to the lake of fire. I have written this here so please god have mercy on my soul!
