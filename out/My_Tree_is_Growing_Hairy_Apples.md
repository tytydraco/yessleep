It started about a month ago. My apple tree, which for years had not grown anything, finally started to show little blooms. As soon as I noticed them, I was ecstatic—finally, after all this waiting, this tree was going to give me something back. After some time, the tiny apples started to appear. Very normal at first. I was even more thrilled and began checking them more frequently.

Then they started to change.

Small black dots began appearing all over them. I assumed it was some kind of disease or bug infestation at first, but they kept growing. Day after day, the apples got bigger. The black dots slowly turned into black strands, which got longer and longer until they began to fully cover the apples—until they were unrecognizable as anything more than clumps of fur.

“What in the hell is going on? What are these? Are they even apples?” I tossed it around in my head as I observed the tree. The leaves, bark, and overall shape all indicated that this was a normal apple tree. Everything did—except the damn apples.

Curiosity finally got the best of me after days of contemplation, and I decided I was going to pick one just to see what would happen. I walked up to the tree and reached out, rubbing my hand over one—my first time actually touching one—and by all accounts, I was touching hair. It felt human in nature and was oddly soft, similar to hair that had just been washed. I grasped the apple and pulled. It plucked off the tree as you would expect one to. I looked it over, and the feel of it in my hand made it clear that, under the hair, there was the classic shape of an apple.

“This is the oddest fucking thing,” I thought to myself as I made my way back to the house.

Once I got in, I set it on the counter. That’s when I noticed a detail that hadn’t been apparent when I first picked it. From the stem where it had been attached to the tree, a small dot of what looked exactly like blood had begun to form.

I wiped the top of the stem with my finger, rubbing the liquid between my pointer finger and thumb, examining it.

It definitely looked like blood—but it couldn’t have been, right?

I left it there. I wanted to see how it was going to age because something was very off about them. I also didn’t want to tell anyone about them yet because I didn’t want every fucker in this town rolling up and messing with it while I was still trying to figure out what was going on myself. So I waited.

Days passed with no change to the apple. It showed no signs of decay or aging. It looked exactly like it did the day I picked it. The others outside were getting bigger. The hair growth had halted, but the apples themselves were growing unusually large. I decided to cut open the one I had inside the house. I wanted to see what I was working with—inside and out.

I placed the apple down on a cutting board and took out a blade. I wasn’t sure where to approach this, so I started by trying to part the hair in the center. It looked like an apple underneath all of it.

“Fuck it,” I said as I slammed the blade down into the apple.

A wet squelch escaped the fruit as a cascade of blood-red fluid poured from the wound, coating my hand and the counter. I looked down in horror at the mass of bloody, matted hair and flesh that lay before me. A grotesque system of veins and muscle filled the monstrosity.

At this point, I was sure—whatever this was, I didn’t like it. But I also wasn’t sure what to do about it.

I threw out the apple, and after a couple of days, it began to emit a smell of pure rot. I moved it even further away—to the edge of the property. It was identical in every sense to a decaying body, only on a much smaller scale.

The apples on the tree had reached what I assumed was their max size. They also started developing odd spots. Each one had a very large soft spot forming in the center. They felt like they quivered when I passed my finger over them. I assumed they were starting to rot, so I just kept waiting to see what would happen, contemplating whether I should cut the tree down when all this was over.

I almost shit myself the next time I went out to check on them. I was looking at the tree when I noticed all the soft spots on the apples quivering rapidly on their own. Then the tree started to shake violently before each apple’s soft spot tore itself open, revealing dozens of dark, bloodshot eyes staring straight down at me as bloody tears ran down the locks of hair beneath them.

This fucking thing was alive—and now it sees me.

I decided it was time to burn the tree. It was the only way I felt I could comfortably deal with it. I didn’t know if it was dangerous, what its intentions were—fuck, I didn’t even know what it was. But it had to go.

I went to my garage and got my gas can and a lighter, then made my way to the base of the tree. It looked down at me through its dozens of furry eye sockets with what I can only describe as a look of hatred. It knew what I was planning—and as far as I could tell, it was not happy. But it also seemed like there was nothing it could do about it. After all, if it wanted to stop me, why hadn’t it?

I began to douse it in gasoline, it watching me unblinkingly at every move I made, not even reacting to the gas splashing in its “eyes.” After I felt it was properly soaked, I sparked my lighter. It followed the flame closely as I tipped it to the edge of the gasoline.

In an instant, it was engulfed in flames.

It began to violently shake, and then—as if the flames were burning away its woody prison and freeing its joints—it started to wail and swing its branches like arms. Then, in a final bloodcurdling scream, it slammed its branches to the ground, lifting itself upward and ripping its roots loose from the dirt. It scurried on them like some kind of land octopus.

I turned and ran, the monstrosity I had created not far behind me, screaming through the sizzling flames engulfing every inch of it. I ran to my truck and tried to start it, fumbling with the keys. The monster slammed into the side of the truck and sent it flying into the garage. It clawed its way forward, trying to grab at the door. I crawled out the passenger side and noticed the flames from the still-burning tree were now engulfing my garage ceiling.

I ran through the door into my house. It fought its way toward me, struggling to push its tall, tree-like body through the garage. As I made it out the back door, I looked back to see it wedged in the doorway. It was stuck—and it was still burning. My house was now burning too.

I ran into the yard and watched the flames rise. I didn’t call the fire department. I was too afraid. If I didn’t let it all burn down, it would somehow survive—and after the hate it now held for me, I couldn’t risk that.

There was nothing left by that evening. The house, the tree—everything was gone. I watched it all burn just to be sure. I went to a neighbor’s house and called 911. They showed up and did their whole routine. My neighbor offered to let me stay there for a while, if I needed.

I decided not to tell anyone what had really happened.

Better for me to just forget it all, right?

And that’s what I’m planning to do.

I went back this morning to get a few things from an outdoor shed that wasn’t damaged in the fire. It’s been a few weeks, and I’ve found a more steady living situation. But I felt my blood run cold as I turned the curve and my property came into view.

There, on the edge of the property where I had thrown out the apple I had cut in half, stood a full-sized tree—hanging full with large, hairy apples.

All of them staring at me with a deep, burning hatred through bloodshot eyes.
