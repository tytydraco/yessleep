As a theater major in college, it took me a while to land a solid job, but eventually, I found a position as a stage manager at an old theater in the heart of the historic district. This theater had been around since before television was even invented, and its marble floors and soaring, intricately designed ceilings made it a stunning, almost otherworldly place to work.

I drove up to the Gagel Theater early on my first training day, the excitement of starting a new job mixing with the familiar anxiety of the unknown. The road was empty at that hour, and I found myself driving through the misty streets, the headlights casting long, eerie shadows along the pavement. I stopped at a gas station on the way to grab a stale cup of coffee and a protein bar—nothing fancy, just something to wake me up.

The rain from the night before hung heavy in the air, and the asphalt glistened with puddles beneath a gray sky. I parked behind the theater, its gothic facade barely visible through the morning fog. The weight of the building settled on me as I stepped out, its mysterious presence heightened by the chill in the air. I shrugged it off, grabbed my bag, and walked toward the entrance, my footsteps echoing in the empty lot.

Inside, the warmth was a welcome relief from the dampness outside. The air smelled of old velvet, dust, and a faint metallic scent, like remnants of past performances. The lobby was grand, with ornate molding and polished marble floors gleaming under chandeliers. An abandoned ticket booth and tarnished concession stand hinted at the theater’s forgotten past, frozen in time.

I paused to take it all in, the silence broken only by my footsteps, the sound of sharp shoes clicking on stone grew louder. "Mr. Allen?" a voice called from around the corner.

I turned, and there he was—a man so impeccably dressed he could’ve stepped out of a fashion magazine. His bald head gleamed under the dim lights, and a black-dyed goatee framed his angular face. He wore a tailored suit so expensive it made my second-hand clothes feel like a joke. His name tag, gold-plated and pristine, read William Kersey - Gagel Theater Manager.

"Yes, sir," I replied, stepping forward and extending my right hand for a handshake, trying to match his professional air.

But Kersey didn’t acknowledge my hand. Instead, he walked directly up to me with the kind of confidence that only comes from someone who has been in charge for a long time. His eyes were sharp, calculating, as if he had already sized me up the moment I walked through the door. Without missing a beat, he spoke in a low, smooth voice, his words deliberate.
“Welcome to Gagel Theater,” Kersey said, his eyes briefly scanning the lobby behind me as though he were assessing something unseen. 
I pulled my hand back awkwardly, feeling his detachment. It wasn’t rude, just off-putting—he wasn’t here to make me comfortable, but to assert control.

With a theatrical sweep of his hand, he motioned to the theater. “Let me show you around. Your supervisor and the Director will be here soon.” His tone, polite but authoritative, made it clear this was more of a formality than an invitation.

I followed, trying to shake off the unease creeping up my spine. A tough boss didn’t bother me, but something about Kersey’s behavior made me feel like he was always in charge.

He led me through the building’s halls, pointing out offices, bathrooms, and the break room. His words were mechanical, like he’d given this same tour a hundred times. He paused by a display, turning to face me with a grin. “Every employee should appreciate the history and legacy of where they work, don’t you agree?”

I forced a smile. “Yes, sir.”

He abruptly gestured toward a wall display—a shrine to the theater’s history. Behind glass were framed photos of past actors, some unrecognizable, others glamorous, each with plaques detailing their contributions. “This theater has been running since 1905,” Kersey said, sweeping his hand toward the images. “Hundreds of performances, thousands of audiences.”

I nodded, feeling a strange unease as I studied the old photos. They were more than tribute—they felt almost reverential. Kersey motioned toward the oldest photo. “We’ve made many improvements over the years.” The comparison between the humble beginnings of the theater and its modern grandeur was stark, but something about the display made the history seem distant and unsettling.

I glanced at Kersey, who stood with perfect posture, smiling at the photos with an intensity that felt off. I shook off the discomfort, reminding myself I was here to work, not to unravel the theater’s mysteries.

Just then, Kersey’s smile twitched as he glanced behind me. “Mr. Allen, this is your supervisor, Troy.”

I turned to meet Troy, a man in his mid-twenties with curly hair tied back and dressed all in black. He greeted me with a firm handshake and a friendly smile. “Nice to meet you, Denis,” he said, his tone warm. His eyes flicked to Kersey, who stood by the display, still observing us. “Are you done with the history lesson? We open in two weeks.”

Kersey sighed, as if Troy had interrupted something important. “Of course,” he said coolly, then gave me a tight smile. “Welcome to Gagel,” he added before walking away with his usual air of authority.

Troy’s expression softened once Kersey was out of earshot. “Sorry I was late to save you from his speech. He loves to hear himself talk.” He gave a conspiratorial grin, but it wasn’t unkind, just casual.

I chuckled nervously. “It wasn’t that bad,” I said, trying to sound casual. “He wasn’t too bad.”

Troy gave a half-smile, clearly not buying it, but he didn’t press the point. “Well, he can be a bit much. But, I’ll save you from more of that. Come on,” he said, gesturing toward the theater's inner sanctum. “Follow me. You haven’t seen the stage yet, have you?”

I shook my head. The tour so far had mostly been the administrative side of things, and the closest I’d gotten to the theater was standing in the hallway outside the main stage entrance. “No, I haven’t had a chance to see it yet,” I replied, trying to mask my curiosity. I was more than eager to get a closer look at where I’d be spending most of my time.

Troy led the way, his pace quick but relaxed, and I fell in step beside him as we passed through the corridors. The deeper we went into the theater, the quieter it became, as if the building itself was holding its breath. The heavy air of history seemed to thicken the farther we went, like the walls were absorbing the weight of decades of performances, both celebrated and forgotten.

He gave me a sideways glance as we reached a large, creaking door that led to the backstage area. “Don’t let Kersey scare you off,” Troy said with a half-smile. “He can be a little intense, but he means well. Just… a little obsessed with this place.”

“I can tell,” I said, letting a light laugh slip out.

Troy nodded, then pushed the door open, the scent of dust and old wood immediately filling the air. “Alright, this is where the real work happens,” he said, stepping aside to let me enter. I peered into the dimly lit space, where the edges of the stage seemed to emerge from the shadows like an old, forgotten memory.

The backstage was just as I’d imagined—dark, cramped, and filled with the remnants of countless performances. Ropes and pulleys hung from the ceiling, and old props were strewn about haphazardly, as if left in a rush. The faint smell of paint and aging fabric filled the air. My eyes were drawn to the towering set pieces that loomed in the dim light, their outlines shifting in the gloom.

Troy took a few steps into the space, gesturing to the various areas. “This is where you’ll spend most of your time,” he said. “The crew’s all up here—setting lights, adjusting props, making sure everything’s in place before the curtain goes up.” He glanced over his shoulder with a small smirk. “It’s not glamorous, but it’s where all the magic happens.”

I couldn’t help but be excited. This was the kind of place I’d dreamed about—messy, chaotic, yet full of life in its own way. It wasn’t the clean, polished front of the theater where the audience would sit. This was the heart of the production, where things were built and broken, where the real work took place.

I walked to the center of the stage, the darkness swallowing me whole. The theater was empty, and its vastness seemed to stretch forever, the air thick with the smell of old wood and dust. I could almost hear the whispers of the past, the faint echoes of performances long gone, lingering in the silence. It was a place where dreams had lived and died, where lives had been changed, and now, it was mine to explore. The thrill of it all—the possibilities of being part of something so much bigger than myself—made my heart race. This was going to be the start of an exciting chapter in my life.

Troy slapped me on the shoulder, breaking my thoughts. “The cast is rehearsing for Chicago during Tech week. They’re off-script, running through everything. You won’t be alone—we’ve got another stagehand to help you,” he said easily.

I nodded, distracted by the vastness of the space. Troy started walking away, heading toward the light console. “It’ll be easier to show you everything with the lights on,” he called back.

Alone on the stage, I felt the weight of the empty theater. The silence was almost suffocating. I remembered hearing that, from the stage, you can’t see the audience because of the bright lights. In this massive theater, Troy had already disappeared from view, and the darkness seemed to swallow me.

I walked over to the velvet curtains, and when I touched them, I felt a strange hum, like they were alive. The fabric was warm—unnaturally so. I shook it off as just the air conditioning, but unease lingered.
Suddenly, the lights blazed on, nearly blinding me. “Damn it,” Troy’s voice echoed. “Sorry, should’ve warned you.”

I laughed it off, stepping back from the curtains. Troy came up the stage with surprising agility. “Let me get you a script Denis.” Troy said, his grin playful.

I nodded. “Yes, sir.”

“Don’t call me that,” Troy said with a smirk. “But first, let me show you the ropes.”

As we moved toward the back of the stage, I couldn’t resist asking, “Hey, Troy, what’s up with the curtains? They were... humming.”

He paused, looking at them with a strange tension in his face. “I’ve wondered that myself, but never cared to check. It’s just one of those things.” His expression darkened. “My old supervisor once told me something,” he said, lowering his voice. “Never open the curtains after a performance. Don’t touch them after they fall.”

I thought he was joking. “Like no one’s allowed backstage after a show?”

“No,” he replied, serious now. “It’s... different. Sounds crazy, I know, but he was clear—never touch the curtains once they fall after the cast bows.”
The air grew heavier, colder. I tried to brush it off. “Just a superstition, right? Like saying Macbeth?”

Troy gave a tight smile. “Probably. But still, don’t open them after the show. Promise?”

I nodded, trying to laugh it off. “I won’t, don’t worry.”

He gestured to the notes on the wall. “Alright, let’s get to work.”

Those first weeks with Chicago were exciting—learning the ropes, working behind the scenes, the thrill of being part of something bigger. But now, I wish I’d listened more closely to Troy’s warnings.

It was opening night for Chicago, and I was a nervous wreck. The adrenaline was buzzing in my veins, my hands slightly trembling as I gripped my clipboard. I was dressed in all black, the uniform of the stage crew, and my earpiece was snug in place, the faint hum of static filling my ear. The cast was in full swing—rehearsing lines, running through their dance routines, and sipping on warm tea to soothe their throats before the big show. The energy backstage was palpable, a mixture of excitement and nervous anticipation that seemed to vibrate through every corner of the theater.

Troy wasn’t around tonight. He trusted me to handle the production solo, which, while comforting, only added to the pressure. It felt like the entire show rested on my shoulders, but there was pride in that too. He trusted me, and I was doing well. That thought gave me a boost—maybe I was finally proving myself in this intimidating world of theater.

But before I could enjoy the moment, the intercom blared. “Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Chicago!” The voice was unmistakable—William Kersey.

His presence always set my nerves on edge. There was something about the forced friendliness in his voice, the arrogance he exuded like he owned everything, especially the Gagel Theater. I could almost see him out there, strutting across the stage in his expensive suit, relishing the attention. It made me want to roll my eyes, but I couldn’t afford distractions—it was opening night.

I peeked out from the wings, my heart racing as I scanned the packed house. It was a sight I’d dreamed of but never fully expected. The audience, dressed in everything from formal attire to casual clothes, was eager for the show to begin. The air was thick with excitement and nerves—an exhilarating chaos that made me feel like I was part of something important.

Then my attention shifted to a man sitting in the front row. He stood out—a large glass of brandy in hand, his posture slumped, and a glazed look in his eyes. He seemed too relaxed, like he’d already indulged too much before the show even started. His presence was unsettling, the kind of drunken calm that felt out of place.

The bright lights stung my eyes, and Kersey’s voice echoed through the theater again, repeating his rehearsed speech about the history of the Gagel Theater. I gripped the velvet curtain, trying to steady myself amidst the growing unease.

As soon as my fingers touched the curtain, a wave of disgust hit me. It wasn’t the soft texture I expected—it was slick, wet, and slimy, like squeezing a soaked washcloth. My heart raced as I pulled my hand away, but the liquid clung to my palm, stretching out in sticky strands. The fabric wasn’t just damp; it was soaked, glistening unnaturally, almost alive. The familiar hum of the theater felt heavier now, vibrating through the walls, like the curtains were breathing.

Confusion twisted into dread as I stared at my hand, covered in a slick, spit-like residue. A rancid, rotten smell filled the air, making me gag. What had happened to the curtains? They had been fine this morning. Had someone spilled something on them? I needed to tell Kersey, but something about this felt off—like the curtains were waiting for something.

Kersey’s voice snapped me out of my thoughts, announcing the start of the show with his usual flair. The audience cheered, but the sound was distant, muffled. I wiped my hand on my pants, the sticky residue still there, clinging to me as I stepped back. I glanced at the curtain again, but all I could see was that strange, unnatural sheen. The theater felt... wrong.

As the show began, everything went flawlessly—each note from the orchestra, each line delivered perfectly. The audience was captivated, their applause growing louder with every act. The energy was intoxicating, but underneath it, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the theater itself was holding its breath.
Backstage, I was busy coordinating quick costume changes and shifting set pieces, feeling like a vital part of a well-oiled machine. Everything flowed seamlessly, the crew working in perfect rhythm, and the energy of the show buzzed through the building. It was exhilarating to be part of something bigger than myself.

As the final act ended, the music swelled, and the cast took their bows. The audience stood, applauding, and the excitement in the room was electric. I hovered over the button to lower the curtain, one simple motion to end the night. But as I stood there, a strange unease washed over me.

The cheers sounded muffled, distant, like I was hearing them through water. My mind flashed to earlier—the damp, oily sensation on the curtains, the hum they emitted, and Troy’s warning: " Never open the curtains after a performance. Don’t touch them after they fall." I had brushed it off, but now, that warning echoed in my mind, and the feeling that something was wrong settled deep in my bones.
The applause continued, but I hesitated, hand poised over the button. The hum of the curtain seemed to vibrate through the walls, sending a chill through me. I swallowed hard, struggling to push aside the growing sense of dread. Something about this moment felt off.

Finally, I clicked the button, and the curtain began its slow descent, moving as if reluctant to end the evening. As I moved backstage to join the cast, I caught sight of a drunken man stumbling toward the stage. His unsteady steps and flushed face made it clear he’d had too much to drink.

“Wait, sir!” I called, stepping forward. “You can’t come up here.”

But he ignored me, climbing onto the stage as the audience murmured in confusion. With the curtain halfway down and tension rising, all eyes shifted between the man and the retreating performers.

“Jerry, get back here!” I heard a woman shout from the front row. She was reaching toward him, her voice strained, but it seemed to have no effect. He barely seemed to hear her, too drunk to comprehend her words. 

He mumbled incoherently, and then I heard the words that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up:
“Show must go on. Show must go on.”

His voice was hoarse, like a chant, something mechanical in the repetition.

“Sir,” I said, my voice firmer now as I stepped forward, stepping under the descending curtain. My hand reached out, palm open, as I tried to keep the drunken man away from the set. “We can’t have you on stage like this.”

But just as I was about to reach him, a hand shot out of nowhere, grabbing my shoulder with brutal force. I was yanked back, my feet sliding on the stage as I spun to face the person who had stopped me. It was William Kersey. His eyes were fixed on the man now stumbling further onto the stage, and his gaze was... wrong. 

There was a sadness there, something cold and distant, like he was watching a final act unfold.
“What are you doing?” I exclaimed, trying to shake off his grip. I pulled myself away from him, but his eyes never left the drunken man, who was now mumbling louder, as if in a trance.

“Show must go on…” he slurred again, his voice growing louder and more frenzied, though his body seemed to be losing control.

And then, without warning, the man tripped, collapsing onto the stage with a violent thud. His body hit the aged wood with a sickening crack, and the audience gasped. I winced at the sound, horrified by his fall. He lay there motionless, sprawled on the floor.

I was about to rush forward, to drag the man off the stage myself and call the police, but before I could take another step, William’s hand shot out again, this time grabbing mine.

“Mr. Allen,” he said, his voice low and urgent, yet strangely calm. “It’s no use now. Don’t open that curtain. Please. You don’t deserve it.”

I stared at him, confused. What was he saying? My hand trembled as I looked back over at the fallen man, still lying there, tangled in the folds of the curtain that had finally reached the stage floor. The red velvet had covered him entirely, swallowing his body in its luxurious fabric. 

William’s grip on my hand tightened. His eyes didn’t leave the curtain, but there was something dark in his expression now, something unreadable. “Please, Mr. Allen,” he murmured. “Do not open the curtain. There are things behind it you don’t want to see.”

I swallowed hard, my chest tightening. Something inside me screamed to open the curtain, to see what was really going on. But a deeper instinct held me back. What had Kersey seen? What had he witnessed? The fear in his eyes, the way he spoke... It was like he already knew what would happen if I did.

The atmosphere was thick with confusion, yet the chaos of the audience seemed to dissipate in an instant. I stood there, my mind racing, as I watched them trickle out of the theater. The same audience that had been shouting for the drunken man to get down from the stage—now quietly filing out, just like they were leaving any other performance after the final curtain call.

I noticed the woman who had screamed for Jerry to return to his seat. She was walking calmly toward the exit, completely alone, as if nothing out of the ordinary had just happened. She didn’t even glance back toward the stage.

It was then I noticed William Kersey. He was walking briskly toward the lobby, heading to speak to the audience as if nothing had happened. His back was turned to me, his shoulders stiff with a purpose. A sense of urgency hung in his every step. His departure left me alone backstage, the weight of the silence pressing down on me like a physical force. The air felt thick, suffocating.

I was left standing there, unsure of what had just transpired. The curtain... the man... had I imagined the whole thing? My fingers reached out and touched the curtain again. This time, the fabric was dry—completely dry, as dry as the first time I had brushed against it. No strange slime, no warmth. It was almost... normal. Almost. Yet, beneath the surface, I could still feel it—the hum, the subtle vibration that pulsed through the fabric like something alive.

I waited for the drunken man to emerge, expecting him to crawl out from beneath the velvet folds. Perhaps he had passed out under there. Maybe he was unconscious, but surely, he wasn’t dead. But there was no movement. No sound. The curtain lay still, like an impenetrable wall of red.

I moved about the backstage area, cleaning up the remnants of the night, but I couldn’t keep my eyes off the stage. I kept looking toward the center, where the man had fallen, half-expecting to see some sign of life. A hand. A foot. A twitch. But there was nothing. Just the silent, ominous weight of the stage pressing in on me.
When I reached the front console to switch off the lights, the weight of the night’s bizarre events pressed down on me. Each fragment of the evening replayed in my mind like a haunting loop I couldn’t escape. Had the curtain… crushed him? Was Jerry—was he dead beneath that heavy velvet? Or had I imagined it all, a trick of the mind, some fevered hallucination brought on by exhaustion? I tried to push the thoughts away, tried to anchor myself in logic, to dismiss the gnawing sense of dread coiling tighter in my chest. But no matter how hard I tried, the unease stayed with me, clawing at my ribs, cold fingers tightening around my heart.

And then, like a cruel answer to my spiraling questions, the curtain moved.

It wasn’t slow or tentative, like the controlled descent it had made earlier in the night. No. This was something else. Something darker. The velvet began to lift—not slowly, not carefully, but fast—too fast for something so heavy. It wasn’t just parting; it was unfurling, unraveling, as if some unseen force on the other side was pulling it apart. It rose with the predatory grace of a monstrous creature stretching awake from a long slumber. The dark fabric rolled back, revealing the stage behind it—a gaping maw framed by the harsh glare of the stage lights, their cold glow flashing like teeth, sharp and hungry.

Behind the curtain, the stage was empty. But the air—God, the air—was thick with something wrong. I squinted into the darkness, seeing nothing but the clutter of props and the forgotten ropes hanging lifeless from the rafters. The brick wall loomed at the back of the stage, silent and indifferent. Yet, there was something else, something wrong in the air, a faint sound that shouldn’t have been there. It was a scream. No, not a single scream, but a chorus—distant, muffled, as though they were coming from far beneath the stage or maybe the very bowels of the building itself.

At first, I thought it was just the building settling, the old pipes groaning, maybe the sound of traffic echoing off the distant streets. But no. As the curtain continued its unsettling rise, the screams grew clearer—more defined. Like the last, desperate cries of something or someone long lost. I froze, unable to tear my gaze away from the widening space, my breath thick in my throat, my heart slamming against my chest.

The man—Jerry—was gone.

I scanned the stage, my eyes darting frantically across the bare boards, the orchestra pit yawning dark below. There was no sign of him. Not a trace. Not a drop of blood. Not a shred of his clothes, no hint of him left behind. It was as if he’d never been there at all. The empty stage stood silent, its hollow emptiness pressing in on me from all sides. The curtain, now still, hung in the air like a watchful eye, its fabric undisturbed. I was alone, but the lingering echo of those screams… they stayed with me, clawing at the edges of my sanity.

And then, in the silence, the curtain shuddered—just a tiny movement.
As though it knew I was still watching.
A wave of panic slammed into me, raw and unrelenting, like a fist to the chest. My heart raced, my breath shallow and frantic. Every instinct screamed at me to run, to get away, but my body betrayed me, frozen in place, locked in some kind of nightmare. I turned abruptly, my fingers numb and shaking as they scrambled to find the switch.

The lights died, plunging the theater into a suffocating darkness, but it didn’t matter. The building wasn’t quiet. The silence that surrounded me now felt wrong. Heavy. Like something—no, someone—was lurking in the shadows, waiting for me to slip, waiting for the moment when I’d lose control. The air itself was thick, charged, as though the very walls of the theater were closing in on me. The curtains—those cursed, wretched curtains—loomed in the blackness like a sentient thing, watching, waiting.

My legs felt like lead, each step an effort, as if some invisible force was dragging me back, pulling me deeper into whatever nightmare this place had become. Still, I forced myself to move, to leave the stage behind. 
Finally, the door loomed ahead, the faint light from the street spilling through the cracks beneath it. I swung it open, nearly stumbling into the cool embrace of the night air. The shift from suffocating darkness to the chill of the outside world was jarring, but it didn’t comfort me. 

I turned my face to the sky, trying to fill my lungs with the freshness of the night, hoping the cold would clear my head, shake off the weight that clung to me like a shadow. But it didn’t help. It only made the world feel more distorted, more off. The night seemed to stretch on, unbroken, endless. The sound of distant traffic was muted, as though the world had pressed its palms to its ears, trying to drown out whatever was stirring just beyond the reach of my senses.

I swallowed, trying to regain control of my racing thoughts, but the feeling of eyes on my back—of something just out of reach, just beyond my perception—didn’t fade. Instead, it grew, spreading like a dark stain across the edges of my mind. Something was waiting. Something had been waiting for far too long.
But when I stepped onto the sidewalk, I froze.

The woman—the woman who had been sitting with Jerry—was standing near the street, staring off into the distance. There was no sign of Jerry. No one else was with her. She was alone.

I approached her, my voice hesitant as I asked, “Hello, ma’am. Was that man Jerry with you?”

She turned to look at me, her eyes distant, as if she didn’t quite understand what I was saying. “What are you talking about?” she asked, her tone confused. “I don’t know anybody named Jerry.”

My breath caught in my throat. I felt a cold shiver run down my spine. She couldn’t have forgotten him—could she? She had been shouting his name only an hour before. I watched her for a moment longer, trying to read the blank expression on her face, but there was no recognition, no flicker of memory.

Was she pretending? Had the whole audience been pretending? Had they somehow all forgotten Jerry’s presence on stage, his drunken stumble, the fall, and the strange silence that followed?

And then I felt it. The heavy weight of the stage is still clinging to my thoughts. The curtains. The way they had seemed almost alive, as if they were waiting for something. The vibrations. The hum. The heat. All of it flooding back to me in a moment of sheer panic.

The voice of William Kersey echoed in my mind, chilling me to the bone: “You don’t deserve it.”

What did he mean by that? 
I turned, desperate to escape the unsettling feeling creeping up my spine, but the question lingered, gnawing at me. I had no answers. All I had were the strange words Kersey had spoken, the eerie emptiness of the stage, and the haunting memory of the curtain opening on its own, revealing nothing.

Months passed before I would ever truly understand what he meant. And now I wish to God I heeded his words.
