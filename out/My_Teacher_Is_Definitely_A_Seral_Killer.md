[PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i1axs9/i_think_my_teacher_might_be_a_seral_killer/)

So, a lot has happened. I'm writing this inside an empty hotel room, a loaded gun next to me. The room reeks of mold and old people. I can hear a siren in the distance as the rain taps on the window ever so gently. Hopefully they get here before it breaks in. Assuming they are even coming of course. I can hear it lumbering around the hallway outside. It murmurs to itself, slams against the walls in frustration. It's only a matter of time until it finds me. You're probably wondering 

"What the hell is it Abi Mae, I thought this was a story about a crazy guy; why is there suddenly a creature?"

 Well because that's life, sometimes a creature shows up. 

But I am getting ahead of myself, I tend to do that when I ponder how long I have left to live. When we last left off, I was following Jorge The Keeper to his car. It was a beatdown old Lincoln Cadillac, beige as my grandma's favorite pair of pants. Jorge lumbered over to the passenger side, presenting it like it was some grand prize. I crept inside the metal deathtrap, hands in my fuzzy jacket. I was holding onto my taser and phone like my life depended on it, and for once that was not hyperbole. Jorge then lumbered to the driver's side and sauntered in. I felt the vehicle dip in his direction as he sat down, the car making an audible thud. The caddy made a sputtering groan as it came to life, the headlights spooked some giggly couple who hurried along like cockroaches. 

The drive over to the hotel was quick and quiet. Neither of us trusted each other, and I was trapped in thought over what possible help Dr. Fine thought I could give him. I remembered his words, his mention of using parts of his victims. Well victim, as far as I knew had had only killed poor Jessica. He had tried to strangle me as well, so I suppose that made him a killer and a half. Not a full-on seral killer. I'm rambling about the semantics here; I apologize for that.

 Soon enough, the decayed and frayed motel came into view. Jorge pulled into an alley next to it and I saw a busted side door. It was torn at the hinges, horribly rusted and dented. Like someone had bashed it in. The hairs on my arms stood up as I gripped my taser tighter. Jorge sighed and turned to me, weariness blasted all over his face. 

"We are here. I will lead you to the doc's study." He held a grim tone over my head. 

"He has a study now. How fancy." I spat, not even hiding my contempt. Jorge hesitated on getting out of the car, then slammed the side door shit, fully facing me. 

"Look I don't condone what the doc has done here. That poor girl, makes me sick to my stomach." Jorge lamented. 

"Then turn him in Jorge, you and I together." I urged. 

"I can't. Not yet anyway. You need to see what he made, why it was all worth it." He sounded like he was trying to convince himself more than anything.

 "Lead the way then."

The inside of the motel was just as grimy and decrepit as I remembered it. Granted it had only been a few hours but it felt like days. The dim bulbs above buzzed like a dying bee wilting away. The carpeted halls reeked of bleach; I held up my nose at the stench. We walked past a hotel door and I noticed specks of dried blood on the ground. I shuddered at the recent tussle, the bruises on my neck starting to itch. Jorge noticed my discomfort and winced.

"I am sorry miss. About what happened and that uh, redhead remark." He coughed and looked away, leading me further into the hotel. 

"It's totally fine." I lied, ice dripping with every syllable.  The motel was bigger than it looked, lots of identical hallways all interlocked going off into separate corridors. It was like Daedalus himself had been the architect for this place. Fitting I suppose, for the monster that had been Dr. Fine, and the creature that lurked its halls now. We came upon a steel door at the end of the first-floor hallway. Jorge fumbled with a pair of rusty keys as he opened the door reveling rickety stairs leading up. I followed him up those musty stairs, the scent of dust and old libraries filing my nostrils. It reminded me of home, my ma would keep stacks of old books in the basement. I would spend hours reading them when I was a kid, just hiding down there till I sent myself into a sneezing fit from all the dust. As you can guess, I had a fun childhood and was well liked. 

The upstairs was as maze-like as the down, only a lot more furnished and filled with wat I assumed were family belongings.  There were some photos hanging, even a few paintings. They showed a happy family, a mom a dad, they told the story of a happy young boy who was overjoyed with his life and had a bright future ahead of him. Looking back, I think this picturesque facade was for my benefit. A big hint to that was Jorge looking at a photo of a teenage Fine holding his mom and dad tight. He had a wide jester's grin on him, the strained faces of his mom and dad told a more intriguing story. Jorge paused and took a long look at that photo and scoffed to himself before leading me on in silence.

 In some distant room, music crawled out to meet us. It was a tragic violinic tune that made me think of a certain monster movie. You've probably some idea of what went down at this point, and I know how it sounds. It sounds outlandish, but I suppose in the end that was Dr. Fine. We came to the music room to see Fine with his back to us in a steel chair. The room was covered wall to wall in plastic sheets, stained with red and brown fluids. In front of Dr. Fine was a covered body and a lantern. The single flame in it flickered at the sight of us.

 Fine turned at our presences, an honest to god black eye patch wrapped around his head. He looked like he had aged a lifetime in just a few hours.  He held up his own phone, which was playing a YouTube video, blasting that melancholic tune forth.

 "Children of the night, what sweet music they make huh." He said in a cringeworthy tone. I winced at the cringe and almost brought out my taser at the sight of him. My heart fluttered in small panic and my neck throbbed. 

"Give me one good reason why I shouldn't turn you in." I demanded of him. 

"You'd be depraving the world of its greatest achievement; conquering death itself." He beamed proudly, as Jorge deflated next to me. My eyes widened in mock Suprise.

"My god sir, please tell me more." I said with faux enthusiasm.

 "I shall elaborate my dear." He unfortunately cried, misreading all my signals. Before I could protest, he went into his spiel. I won't bore you with his long-winded speech and exposition so I'll just list the cliff notes. Grew up rich and smart, "Played" with small animals, parents died in a car crash and left him their motel chain. He of course ran it into the ground and wasted it all on weird experiments and failed books. 

". . . And THAT is when I realized, I was most happy when my loving parents were around." he finished, tears swelling in his eyes. 

"So, what's that have to do with you being an English teacher." I asked, half afraid I had already tuned out the answer.

 "That was my cover my dear, I looked for dull-witted beauties I could harvest and pushed away the more like-minded types like me. Like you." He pointed towards me.

"I am nothing like you." I scoffed.

 "Oh? Tell me, did you even like Jessica."

"I mean she was ok. Laughed too much, thought she was so full of herself because she was popular, and her writing was so basic and-"

"-felt like she was copy and pasting the Wikipedia article on Victoria's secret?" Fine finished my sentence for me and the color drained from my face. A smug smirk crossed his face, and I thought about evening out his other eye.

 "I think you see my point Abi Mae. If it helps, I didn't want to kill them, Jessica or the rest." He lamented. "The thought to try and reanimate my folks came early on, and I had Jorge dig their graves up. Their bodies had rotted away to almost nothing, the muck and worms had seen to that. I barley saved what was left of their brains."

"Yhea that all really doesn't justify murder." I said rolling my eyes. "I was actually afraid of coming here, but you're sounding like a wannabe Batman villain." I complained. Fine's face turned red with anger. He turned to the covered body and the ground and unveiled it in one swift motion. I gasped and cupped my hands to my mouth in spite myself. 

The thing on the ground was pale and naked. It was stitched together from various people of both sexes. It was on its side, the severed face of Jessica staring back at me with red eyes. The scalp was a patchwork of styles and color, some braided black, some flowing blonde. It had four breasts of varying sizes, one missing an areola all together. Its left arm was twice the size of the right, and had mangled fingers fused into a single claw. The back of the creature was where it got interesting.

 The other side was more masculine, a man's head I did not know was stitched to the back of the women.  It was half bald and it looked like horsehair and folic ripped right from the source had been glued and stapled onto the face like a bizzaro beard.  Both arms were double joined and the same size, they looked like they could flop around and cause some serious damage. 

It was then I realized the wretched thing only had one set of legs. Two torsos fused at the pelvis, seared flash stained the incisions and cuts it had taken to create such a thing. Fine stood over his patchwork horror like a giddy schoolboy, a look of triumph plastered all over his face.

"They're beautiful aren't they."  He decried. He looked to me and Jorge for approval. Jorge looked like he wanted to dry heave and could barely contain my retching.

 "Strange things going on around here." Jorge The Keeper muttered at last. Fine waved his hand dismissively of him. I could barely take my eyes of Jessica's false eyes. Even now they were still pleading for help.

 "How many." I asked at last, my eyes not leaving the thing's gaze.

"Enough." Replied Fine Smugly. A fire built up inside me and I finally met Fine's condescending look. I tore the taser from my pocket and with a roar I rushed at him. Within a second a sharp *SMACK* rang out and my check stung instantly as he backhanded me. I flew to the ground in a heap, wincing from the pain. Jorge ran over to try and help me up but I pushed him away, glaring at Fine. 

"Tame that temper Abi Mae. I still need you after all. You are to bear witness as I bring life to this, my crowning achievement." He exclaimed to no one in particular. I stood up and looked at the man loon. Jorge chirped up from behind me.

"Do you think it'll really work doc, that they'll remember." He seemed so desperate to believe in this lunacy. 

"Of course, you dullard. I'm the one doing it." The crazed bastard pridefully said. I'll give him this, he did a damn fine job of hiding this side of him before now. I could barely remember that handsome young man who I had a forbidden crush on. It made me sick to even think about, but I silently backed away as Fine brought out a car battery and jumper cables. I bumped into Jorge who grasped my shoulders and held me in place.

"Please miss, just watch. It has to work, it has to. He was always cruel, but his parents kept him in check. Once they're back he'll be himself again." He pleaded to his delusion. I wanted to struggle against the old keeper's grip but out of the two of them I was weirdly feeling bad for him. Against my better judgement I watched as Fine tested the car battery, sparks flying as he clipped the cable prongs together. Satisfied, he went to work on the mangled corpse. He had screwed two metal pikes into the base of its necks, one for each head and connected them. He jumped back and gasped as the surge started to overwhelm him. His hands curled and balled as the jolt ran through him. 

He stepped back and looked on as the body started to convulse with electricity. It twitched and dance to the tune of tesla coils. To my Suprise, the monster started to arise. I heard bones crack and skin crackle and pop as smoke started to emit from the metal pikes. The monster blinked, its crimson eyes popping out of its skull. It opened its two mouths and started to cry out. It was an animalistic cry that harkened back to the days man first roamed the earth. It outstretched its deformed arms towards me and Jorge, and we stepped back in fright at the unbelievable sight. Its eyes started to bulge as the stitched together skin started to pulsate. The sound of sizzling bacon rang out from the creature, and the crisp scent of burned rubber wafted towards us. The eyes started to disintegrate, literally melt into a soupy mess. The goop straked down the stolen face of Jessica, not unlike massacre that had caked her demise.

 Fine looked pleased at first, then he noticed he was cooking his monster alive. He ran over to the car battery, violently kicking it to severe the connection. The thing collapsed to its knees in a horrid wail, knocking over the lantern. It rolled to one side of the wall, breaking instantly. The only light now was coming from the hall, the creature swayed and clawed at the air as it cried out in agony. Finally, it stopped, as Fine had started to bash the battery with the steel chair like a demented wrestler. It shorted out with a blue flame and one final kick. 

The smell lingered but the sound of frying rotten flesh lessened. It was replaced by the wheezing of the thing's labored breaths. Its newly born lungs already filled with pain and anger. It made a moaning sound as it waved its deformed hands in front of its face, struggling to see. Fine knelt down in front of the creature, in awe of it. He reached out and touched its face. The thing flinched at his touch and whimpered like a newborn cattle. "No no, its ok. It's me mama. It's Dex. And Papa, are you in there as well?" He said softly, reaching his other hand around to grope the man face. It moaned softly at his touch, a mournful cry. The creature seemed to study its surroundings, as best it could anyway with melted eyeballs. It raised its main pair of arms up around fine and slowly started to embrace him. Fine let out a cry of joy as he leaned in to hug the creature back. Jorge sniffled next to me, and I just stood there, amazed. The creature's embrace grew tighter, as Fine stated to grunt. 

He struggled but the amalgamation held him close. I could hear bones start to break as Lenny held the rabbit. Fine struggled, a pained expression on his face. He could not escape the vice like grip his long-armed friend had. The thing being emitted a low growl as it reared its head around, the pale mimic scrunching its face as it opened is maw. The teeth were all crocked and raw, some sharped to a fine point. Where had find gotten a jaw like that, I found myself wondering. 

I would not have the chance to ask him that however. The beast sunk its teeth into the side of Fine's face and bit into it. Fine shrieked in pain and terror as it dug around the side of his head. It released its bite, revealing a mouthful of blood. It seemed to look him in the eye than. Both heads spoke as one, raspy voices clawing to get out.

"We hurt." It simply stated as it began crushing Fine's spine. It was a quick motion, one moment he was screaming, the next choked gasps as Fine Was bent in two. The top side of his body flopped backwards, his dead eyes looking at me and Jorge in Suprise. It released Fine, and he dropped to the ground like a sack of potatoes. The thing stood up now, an impressive 6 and a half feet. It waddled at first like a newborn but quickly found its footing.  It turned towards us, shambling, muttering crazed nonsense under its heavy wheezing. It swatted the air in front of it, stepping over the discarded body of Dr. Fine. Jorge stepped forward, revealing his gun. He glanced towards me and told me to run for it. 

Well, he didn't have to tell me twice. I bolted out of the room as shots rang out and the creature screamed "We hurt" once more. I was halfway down the hall when I heard a loud crash, and turned back to see Jorge slam into a wall. The gun sputtered away from him, and landed a few feet away from me. The creature peeked Jessica's face around the corner and started lumbering down the hall, its cries echoing against the ancient hotel walls. I quickly grabbed the gun and scattered. I didn't know where I was going, probably in circles. Each decayed hall looked exactly the same to me, and I could hear Fine's creation around every corner.

 Finally, I just picked a room and shut it as quietly as possible. I stood against the door and studied the room. It had one window, one bed and a dresser. The bed was unkempt and had filthy brown sheets, the dresser smelled of mildew. I sprang to it, collapsing it onto the ground. With all my might I barricaded the door, the only route to and from and collapsed next to the dirty bed. My whole body was shaking from fright and exhaustion, and I could barely contain it. 

I just couldn't believe it, I mean you only see these kinds of things in old bad movies. But it had happened. That is where I find myself, still trapped in this room. In hindsight, I should have traced my steps and found the stairs that way. But you try and think straight when some manmade horror beyond your comprehension starts lurching towards you. I called the cops, don't think they believed me. I called my roommate, but Barb didn't pick up. She's so flakey sometimes. I have the gun with me, and I can hear it coming close to the door. If this is the final post I make, just know I went down fighting.
