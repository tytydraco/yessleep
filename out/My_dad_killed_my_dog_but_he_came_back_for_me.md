I’ve never told anyone this. Not my parents, not my wife, not my kids. Hell, I almost didn’t write it here, because even typing it out makes me feel like I’m tempting fate. But I’m getting older, and this memory has been eating away at me since I was eight years old. If I don’t tell it now, I probably never will.

This happened in 2002, during summer after third grade.

We lived in one of those cookie-cutter neighborhoods, the kind where every house looks the same except for whatever junk people decided leave in their yard. My parents worked long hours. Dad at the mill, Mom at a dentist’s office as a receptionist. so I spent a lot of time by myself on summer vacations. I was kind of a lonely kid, but I didn’t really feel it because I had my dog, Duke.

Duke was just some mutt. Not in a bad way. Just if you asked me what breed he was I couldn’t tell you. He had brown curly fur, floppy ears, and eyes that always looked sad. He wasn’t special, but he was mine. He’d sleep at the foot of my bed every night and follow me everywhere during the day. If you’ve ever had a dog as a kid, you know what I mean. He wasn’t “a pet.” He was part of the family and my best friend.

And then my dad killed him.

Not on purpose. I want to be clear about that. He came home one night tired as hell, pulled into the driveway, and Duke was lying there for some reason. I saw the wheel roll over him. I saw his body jerk and crumple. I still hear that sound sometimes in my head. That snap that I could only imagine was his spine. That little yelp.

My dad jumped out of the truck and grabbed him, but it didn’t matter. Duke was gone. Just like that.

We buried him that night in the backyard, under the plum tree. My dad dug the hole himself. We put Duke in a cardboard box and laid him to rest. I cried until I couldn’t breathe. I think Dad cried too, but he did it alone in the garage. Guess he didn’t want me to see, but I heard him.

After that, the house felt empty. I moped around all day. Didn’t want to play my PlayStation, didn’t want to ride my bike, didn’t want to eat. My whole summer was shot before it even started.

And then, a few days later, it happened. Duke came back.

Both my parents left for work one morning, leaving me home alone. Back then, no one cared about leaving a third grader by himself at home for few hours. Different times, I guess. Plus I was a pretty mature kid for my age. I poured myself a bowl of coco puffs and parked in front of the TV.

At some point, I went to the kitchen for a refill. That’s when I saw him.

Through the sliding glass door, sitting in the middle of the yard, was Duke.

I dropped the bowl. Milk went everywhere.

He looked exactly the same as he always had. Ears floppy, tongue hanging out, tail wagging when he saw me. Like nothing had ever happened. Like he hadn’t been buried in a box three days ago.

I said his name. “Duke?”

He wagged harder.

For a second, my brain told me it was all just a mistake. That he hadn’t really died, that somehow we’d screwed up, that miracles were real. I was so excited that I even reached for the sliding door.

But then I froze.

His eyes. They weren’t right. They were too dark, too shiny, like wet marbles. And when he moved his head, it was weird, like a twitch.

Something deep inside me screamed: Don’t open the door.

Duke stood up. His body moved stiff, jerky, like one of those old wind-up toys. He padded closer until his nose touched the glass. His mouth opened, but no sound came out.

For the rest of the day, he sat there. Watching. Not barking, not whining. Just watching.

When my parents got home, he’d hear the car pull up and wander off.

This went on for days.

Every morning after they left for work, he’d come back. Sometimes he’d sit in the grass. Sometimes he’d stand pressed against the glass door. Sometimes he’d tilt his head like he was trying to understand why I wouldn’t come outside or let him in.

I didn’t tell anyone. How could I? I didn’t want my parents to think I was crazy. I knew dogs couldn’t just come back from the dead.

And the longer it went on, the worse he got. His fur started looking dirty. Patchy. His tail wagged less. His mouth hung open too wide, like it could split his face in half. Looking back at it now, it’s like he was decomposing.

On the fifth day, something in me snapped.

I couldn’t stand it anymore, the watching, the silence, the feeling that I was losing my mind. I told myself I was going to prove it wasn’t real. That I was just imagining things.

So I waited until Duke wandered off that evening like he always did when he heard my parents’ car. I grabbed a flashlight from the kitchen, crept out the back door, and walked to the plum tree where we’d buried him.

The grass was still flattened from when Dad dug the hole. The dirt looked a little looser than it should have, but maybe that was just in my head. My hands were shaking so bad I nearly dropped the flashlight.

I found Dad’s shovel leaning against the shed. And then, like a total idiot kid, I started digging.

The dirt gave way fast, like freshly dug dirt does. My chest was tight, my ears ringing, but I couldn’t stop. I had to know.

When I hit cardboard box, my stomach turned. I clawed at the dirt until I could pull it up into the open.

It was empty.

No bones. No fur. Nothing.

The box didn’t even look like anything had ever been in it. But I saw my dad put Duke in there. I watch him carry the box to the hole. Watched as he covered it with the dirt. 

I dropped the flashlight. I think I screamed, but I’m not sure. The next thing I remember, I was back inside, shaking under my blanket with the TV on full volume to drown out the pounding of my heart.

I never told anyone what I did, but it’s something that still haunts me till this day.

But Duke stopped coming after that night. I never saw him again.

Sometimes I wonder if digging up that box is what made him stop. Like maybe I called his bluff, or maybe he didn’t want me to know for sure.

Other times I wonder if it wasn’t Duke at all. If it was something else that needed a body, and it took his.

And if that’s true, then I don’t know where it went when it was done with him.
