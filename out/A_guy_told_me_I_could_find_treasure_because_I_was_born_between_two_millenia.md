Some things you'll find easy to believe.  Warm February weather?  Me catching cold?  Sure.  The orange threads?  Why not?  Black that hurts your eyes?  Steam rolling off Lexy?

Those, I don't know.

It starts after Christmas, a bunch of us in the Square Diner having coffee and cheesecake.  You wouldn't think the Square would be a zoomer hangout; it's a redneck joint that opens extra-early in fall so hunters can eat breakfast and fill their coffee mugs before hitting the deer woods.

But we always go there instead of driving ten minutes across Grace Mountain to fast-food row in Argenta.  The coffee's cheap; the cheesecake's not but tastes good; Aldo never hustles us out, not until it gets to be closing time.  And our talks take twists nobody'd think of at McDonald's.

Like this night three or four days after Christmas, everything in Drunken Tree closed but the diner, we got onto the subject of generations, arguing, was Kevin Gen Y or a zoomer.  Jacy said, "You're born in '96, that makes you Y."

Lexy said, "All this generation shit is--well, it doesn't mean shit unless there's some *difference* between generations.  Like there's an assload of boomers because everyone had kids after World War II.  And none of them understand computers."

"My grandmother writes software, asshole," Kevin said.

"But what's different between X and Y and Z?  We're all poor because of boomers.  We're all internet-addicted."

"I heard if you can't remember the twentieth century, you're Z," Kevin said.  "I sure don't.  First thing I remember outside my own family is 9/11, my mom watching TV and crying all day."

Paul said, "I was born in '97, I remember Y2K.  My gramma came to our house 'cause she thought her computer was gonna blow up.  Meemaw made Dad shut his computer off."

"You weren't even three and you remember that?"  Jacy scoffed.  She turned to me.  "What about you, Nita?"

"I was born in 2000, so for sure I'm Z.  I was born exactly between the centuries."

"Say what?"

"You know how some people say 2000 isn't really part of the new millenium, that it really started in 2001?"

"Well, it did," Lexy said.  "There's no year zero.  Unless you want the first century to have 99 years, then centuries gotta end in hundreds, like 1900, 2000."

"Yeah, that's the math," I agreed.  "But see, there's the scientific explanation, and the, the popular one.  So people say the twentieth century ended with 1999, but scientists say the twenty-first starts with 2001.  So 2000 isn't really either one--or else it's both."

I shrugged.  "My granddad says 2000 was, like, a reset year, a grace year *between* the centuries.  And I was born right at the center of it."

"How so?" Jacy asked.

Kevin was quicker.  "What, so you were born right at noon on the middle day of the year?"

"Midnight," I said.  "Leap year, remember, 366 days.  Near as I can tell, I was born exactly between July first and second.  Halfway between the centuries, Papa Eddie says."

"Right at twelve."

"Nope."  I grinned--caught him again.  "At *real* midnight, halfway between sunset and sunrise.  With daylight saving time, it comes out about one-thirteen in the morning.  The sun doesn't follow our clocks, you know."

"Yeah, well," Kevin shot back, "the sun didn't make our calendars, either.  All the numbers are just made up, the years and the clocks both."

"Look at Chinese New Year," Lexy pointed out, "all over the calendar."

"Even in Europe the new year used to be in the middle of March," Jacy said.  She always had these weird historical facts.

At McDonald's or Subway, we would have stopped there.  But in the Square Diner, the conversation had another twist waiting.

"It's funny, what your granddad says about 2000 being between the milleniums," Lexy said.

"Millenia," Paul corrected.

"Who cares?  Anyway, *my* pappaw used to say he'd be rich if he could find someone born between years.  Something he heard in Vietnam."

"What calendar do they use in Vietnam?" Paul asked.

"Like I know?  Anyway, he spent time in a village over there, talking to the old folks.  They had this story about how you can, like, reach between days and pull out treasure."

"Yeah?" Jacy scoffed.  "How rich were they?"

"They didn't have the *right person,* dumbass.  Like I said, you gotta have someone born between years.  Like right exactly at midnight on New Year's Eve."

"Only not exactly at twelve," Paul said, "but halfway between sunset and sunrise."

"Yeah, whatever.  So before he can get the whole tale he goes back to his unit, and maybe a week later Viet Cong burn the whole village."  Jacy hissed; Lexy shrugged.  "He thinks that's the end, then while he's being shipped home he meets some Irish guy in Guam or someplace.  Turns out there's an Irish myth about the same thing."

Jacy said, "And the Irish guy drowns in the Pacific before he gets the story."

Lexy glared at her.  "No, the Irish guy told him the whole thing.  And he told me.  Find the magic person, you can get rich."

"You think Nita's magic?"

"Why not?  If between years is good, between centuries ought to be a hundred times better."

As the magic person in question, I was feeling a strange mix of fear, greed, and suspicion.  Could I really get rich just from when I was born?  "What's the catch?" I asked.

"Huh?"

"Where's the monkey-paw part?  Are there monsters by the treasure?  Is it, what, radioactive?  Do you have to cut me open to get it?  What?"

Paul said, "Well, plutonium's worth like 5K a gram, but it's radioactive."

"And trying to sell it would prob'ly get you arrested," Kevin added.

"Cut you open?" Jacy cried.  "That's horrible."

"Hey," I answered, "Ireland was a goddam bloody place even before the Protestants and Catholics came in."

"No catch!" Lexy said, interrupting.  "It's just really tricky to do."  He looked slantwise at me.  "You were really born right at halfway of 2000?"

"That's what's on my birth certificate.  I wasn't watching the clock myself, far as I recall."

That's where that conversation ended.  Aldo interrupted to ask if anyone wanted a last refill before he closed; when he'd finished topping everyone up we went off on a different subject.
****
New Year's Eve it came up again.  This time it was just Kevin and Lexy and me, at my house because we all celebrate sober and everyone else (my parents too--yes, I'm 23 and living with them) was at parties with booze.

Kevin brought it up, not Lexy.  "You never said," he began, "how do you reach between days?  Do you have to do it on New Year's Eve or something, like when your magic person is born?"

"No, you can do it any night, between any two days.  But it's gotta be warm, because you gotta do it outside."

It sure wasn't warm that night, and it actually snowed four times over the two weeks after New Year's.  It got into the 60s the second Thursday of January, but it snowed again the very next day.  My dad made his usual "If you don't like Arkansas weather, wait an hour," joke; my mom said, "Shakespeare probably said that about London"; and Lexy messaged me, **Missed our chance this time. Want to try next time its warm? You me and kevin**

I didn't pretend I didn't know what he meant.  I'd sort of hoped he'd forget about it, but I'd thought about it nearly every day.  **Sure.** I sent back.  **But if I see monsters or knives imma nope tf out of there.**

The last full week of January it warmed into the 60s.  What usually happens in winter warm spells happened:  We got a bunch of rain, then heavy fog.  My folks' house went from skin-cracking dry to sticky damp, and I caught cold.  But the rain stopped after two days, and Lexy messaged me, **How about Thursday night**

We met Tuesday at the diner to make plans, me sniffling into napkins all through pie and coffee.

I'm not giving all the details.  Even if I wanted to I can't--Lexy never told me all of them.  But it wasn't some weird Bloody Mary ritual, with chanting and stuff; it was more something Lexy and Kevin *built.*

None of us could wear metal, not even a tiny piece.  No jeans with zippers or rivets, no shoes with eyelets, no snaps.  Drawstring sweats, knit beanies, sports bra for me.  Turns out the strap rivets on my Crocs were plastic, so those were okay.  Phones, keys, that stuff had to stay at least ten or twelve feet away.

"What about in your body?" Lexy asked me.  "You ever had a broken arm or anything, like with a pin in it?"  So I had to google whether my IUD had any metal; I have the hormone kind, so he thought it would be okay.  He was bright red when he said it.

Kevin wasn't so shy.  "Ugh, microplastics all up in you."

"What about fillings?  Teeth?" I asked.  That stopped him, because all three of us had metal fillings.

"I guess we'll just have to try it.  Metal isn't *dangerous*; it just might keep things from working."

And we had to rehearse, because the one thing that *absolutely* had to go right was something I could only try once, right on the dot of midnight.  Kevin and Lexy made a square of cotton thread.  It had to be hung off the ground; it had to be a certain size, the distance between the tips of my elbows if I touched fingertips in front of me--about three feet square.  (They made other stuff, but for me the thread square was the important part.)

I had to jump through it without breaking any threads, like leaping out a window.

It sounded easy at first.  The square was wider than most doors, and I'm not fat.  Lexy'd used bright orange thread for visibility.  But keeping my head down while I tucked my feet up was tricky.  I wanted to dive through, but Lexy said I had to cannonball--my head and feet had to go through at the same time, I don't know why.  I broke four of those thread windows before I got the hang of it.

My parents have a big back yard with lots of trees, perfect to Lexy.  He found a spot out of sight of the house where he could string up a square between trees, threads from all four corners.  He took nearly an hour Wednesday afternoon, adjusting the anchoring threads, because the window had to be as square as he could make it.

Then he had to do it again on Thursday, because heavy dew Wednesday night pulled it out of shape.  But that evening we were ready.

Lexy and Kevin were, anyway.  I was getting scared again.  I still craved a treasure; even if somehow we couldn't sell it, even if we had to give it to a museum, who doesn't want to discover hidden treasure?  Maybe we'd be famous.

But Lexy said we were opening a hole between days, whatever that meant.

And I was going to be the first one through.

I was afraid of what lay between.  I was afraid of monsters.  I was afraid of not having my phone--no metal allowed.  And I was blowing my nose every five minutes and wanted to go to bed, not stand under trees in the dark and damp, even if it was fifty degrees instead of fifteen like last week.

Lexy'd used a website to calculate sunset and sunrise, with the GPS coordinates for my folks' back yard, then figured true midnight at 23 minutes and some seconds after clock midnight.  At 12:23:00 I was crouched and waiting to jump, dressed in sports bra, panties, sweats and knee socks.  No Crocs; we'd cleared the ground so I could land without bruising my foot on a rock.  Dim light around me, from neighbors' houses, from the guys' phones where they stood ten feet back watching the time.

Lexy started counting down, something else we'd rehearsed.  "...And three and two and one and *go!*"  I jumped--and at that exact moment I sneezed, hard.

I must have kicked out or something, just as I went through the thread window.  I snagged a thread, snapped the window.  I didn't hear it, didn't even feel it, but I fell to my knees and knew I'd blown it.  I heard Lexy swearing.

"Did you see that?" Kevin said.  "That flash?"

I hadn't seen anything, even against this dim light.  But Lexy had seen it, too.  They'd stood behind me while I jumped; maybe the flash had faced toward them, away from me.

I apologized over and over, swearing I didn't know I was going to sneeze.  Lexy didn't answer, sulky but holding his temper.  But when Kevin said we could try again Friday or Saturday, he said, "Saturday night.  I'm at a game tomorrow."

"I'll get it right Saturday," I said.  "I swear I will."
****
And I did.  This time Lexy strung two windows, a few feet apart.  He said if I missed one I could try again; maybe the time didn't have to be that exact.  "It's not like Irish peasants could tell time to the second," Kevin pointed out.

"Yeah, but they could use trial and error.  And how many Irish peasants found treasure, anyway?"  While we were rehearsing, Lexy had wondered whether going between days was what started the story of leprechauns and rainbows and pots of gold.

I was still afraid, but I was more scared of messing up again.  Before I got in place I made Kevin shine his phone flashlight in my eyes, so I'd sneeze if I needed to.  Then Lexy started counting down, and on "Go!" I jumped.

I knew when I landed I'd done it perfectly.

And just like that, my heart was pounding and I felt dizzy.  I thought I'd been scared before.  Now I learned better.  What I'd felt before was like worrying about an English test.  This--this was getting home and seeing ambulances at the curb.

*I'd opened a hole between days.*

I'd heard Lexy say, "Holy shit!" as I landed.  So the loud gasp I'd heard was Kevin.  Now I heard Kevin breathing fast behind me.  Lexy hadn't made another sound.

I was too terrified to turn around and see.  "You--see that?" Lexy said finally.

"Yeah," Kevin choked.

Now I was more afraid of not seeing.  I turned around.  The thread window hung between me and the guys, still rippling a little from the wind of my jump.  It looked just the same.  Both of them stared like a flamethrower was pointing through it.

I looked at them, I looked at it.  I walked around to their side.

And I had to cover my mouth with both hands to keep from screaming.  From this side, the side I'd jumped into, the window was glowing.

Except it was dark.  Black.  A brilliant, glowing black.

I know that makes no sense.  But that's what filled the space between the threads, side to side and bottom to top, a sheet of dazzling bright black.  Like someone had caught a lightning bolt in a sheet of obsidian.  It was darker than the shadowy bushes behind it, but I still almost had to squint to look at it.

It couldn't be real.

Kevin turned his phone flashlight on again, turned it that way.  The orange thread shone in the darkness.  But I couldn't see where the light fell on the square in between.  The thread was rippling from this side too, but I couldn't see ripples in the black.

I don't understand why, but scared as I was I was the first one to reach toward the window.  I stopped my hand a couple of inches from it.  The back of my hand glowed from Kevin's light; my palm facing the window stayed dark.  My hand didn't cast a shadow.

The longer I stared, the blacker it looked.  The brighter it looked.

So I touched it.

It felt firm.  I pressed; it gave a little, like an unopened bottle of Coke.  Not particularly warm or cold, not slippery.

I pressed harder, leaning to look sideways across the window.  I could feel it give, feel my fingers denting it, but I couldn't see a dent; it was all uniform bright black.  Leaning far enough to the side, my fingertips disappeared into the dent.

Now Lexy came up; I stepped back.  He pressed it like I had.  "What the fuck?"  He slammed his fist against it, gave a grunt of pain.  I expected the window to boom like a drum, but there was just a little slapping noise.  He shoved with both hands.  "It's supposed to be a door!"  

"It's a window," I said, not really thinking.

"Whatever!  What good's a window you can't go through?"  He punched it again, a third time; tucked his fist into his armpit and hissed.  *"Shit!"*

Kevin picked up a pebble from the little pile we'd cleared from my landing spot, tossed it at the window.  I thought it would bounce--but it disappeared.  Lexy and I gaped.  Kevin poked the black with a stick; the stick bent, the tip snapped off.  He tossed the stick underhand, endwise; it slid through the glowing sheet without slowing down.  Nothing fell behind the window.  "You gotta jump," he said.  "You can't be touching the ground."

Lexy stared at that three-foot square, two feet off the ground, and for all I was scared blind I had to laugh.  He'd made me practice over and over, but he'd never tried jumping through it himself.

But there a few feet away was the spare window he'd made.  He looked at it.  "Shit, no time like now."  He backed up, tugged his sweatshirt down straight and snug, took a couple of steps, and launched himself headfirst through the window.  I was amazed to see him do a nearly perfect dive roll, parkour style, on the other side:  land on hands, roll over back, come up on feet.  He hadn't even brushed any of the threads.

"What about cannonballs?" I said.  "You wouldn't let me dive through.  And your phone?"

"That was all to open it.  I just have to go through."  He pushed Kevin aside, backed up, and ran at the brilliant black square.  He leaned forward, thrust out his arms, and jumped just before his hands reached it.

I thought he'd bounce back.  He didn't.  He disappeared, hands arms head body legs feet *gone.*

Kevin looked at the black window, at me, at the window.  "Now what do we do?"

I thought Lexy would jump back through.  I thought he'd toss jewels or gold statues or something back through.

I thought he'd come back.  But he didn't.

Kevin tried phoning Lexy; he got rolled to voice mail immediately.  I texted him; nothing came back.  We couldn't shout, not with my parents asleep in the house and neighbors not far away, but we talked to the window from right beside it.  Kevin pressed his ear to it; he couldn't hear anything.  He knocked *Shave and a haircut* on it, but we didn't even hear his knuckle hitting, much less any answer.

We sat in my folks' back yard and waited.  It had been in the 60s Friday afternoon, but now it got cold fast.  We talked a little bit, but it all came back to, "When's he gonna come back?"

I kept waiting for Kevin to say, "I should go after him."  Maybe Kevin was waiting for me to say it.  Neither one of us did.  It might have been heroic for Kevin to jump after him--but it might have been really stupid, too.  What if there wasn't any ground on the other side?  What if there was a dragon?

The longer I sat and the colder I got, the stupider I felt.  And I was angry with Lexy and Kevin, too.  Both these guys were older than me--why hadn't one of them said, "This is a bad idea"?  It was like those internet memes, *Why women live longer than men.*

It was close to 1:30, getting cold as hell, and I was wondering if I could stand waiting here all night, when the window went out.  Neither one of us saw it happen.  I glanced up, and that dazzling black was gone.  Just pale thread, dark bushes, shadows beneath trees.

It had hung there about an hour and ten minutes after I jumped through, about an hour after Lexy jumped through.  Now I realized neither one of us had tried taking a picture of it.  What would my phone have seen, pointed at that glowing black square?

"I'm going in the house," I said.  "He's dead, or he's lost, or something."

Kevin didn't say anything.  He followed me back to the house, walked around to the driveway, drove away.  It was lucky they'd come in his car, or I'd have to explain why Lexy's car was in our driveway Saturday morning.  But Lexy always got people to drive him places.

I spent nearly all day Saturday--a week ago, the last Saturday of January--in bed, telling Mom my cold was worse again.  I guess I cried a little.  I hadn't really liked Lexy, not the way I liked Jacy or Kevin.  Lexy was too selfish, too spiteful.  But he could be funny, and my other friends liked him around.  I hadn't wanted something to happen to him.

I'm not going to describe this week, all the messages and posts asking, where's Lexy, has anyone seen Lexy, did Lexy tell anybody where he was going, all that.  I couldn't call in sick forever, so I went to work Monday like normal, though I still had a cough and runny nose.  Kevin told people he and Lexy had hung out at my house Friday night, then he'd taken Lexy home and and hadn't seen him since.  I told people we played Exploding Kittens, sat in the yard for a while, then the guys left.

So nobody knew where Lexy was, but nobody called the police, either.  A 26-year-old single guy who doesn't get along with his parents, doesn't have a girlfriend, doesn't show up for work--who's going to stir up shit about him?
****
But February 1st was even warmer, up in the 70s, and Kevin came over to my house.  "Are those threads still there?"

"I'on't know."

"Let's look."  Back in the trees, the first window, the one I'd opened, was sagging; a bird or something had broken one of the threads.  But the spare window still looked square.

"I can't stand wondering," Kevin said.  "You think you can jump through again?"

"Don't want to."

"But I've got an idea, a way how I won't get stuck over there.  And I'll leave my phone, in case that's what messed Lexy up.  I can do it right this time--but not unless you open a window again."

"Find somebody else born between years.  There's gotta be somebody else."

"Yeah, maybe six or eight people in the whole state.  Even if it doesn't have to be the exact second, even if it just has to be the right minute, you know how many minutes there are in a year?"

"Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred," I said automatically.  Mom loves to watch *Rent* and cry over Angel.

"Which means about one person in half a million is born in that minute between December and January.  There aren't half a million in the nearest ten counties.  There're barely three million in the whole *state.*  Tag, Nita, you're It."

I argued a while longer, but there really wasn't anybody else.  At last I gave in.  "But if you get lost, too, I'm not going after you."

It didn't happen that night, though.  A family emergency came up--details don't matter to this story--and I had to go to Harrison with my parents.  Kevin must have texted me twenty times, frantic something would happen to the threads that night or Friday.  I had to mute him to get through the day.

I was back Friday afternoon; Friday midnight we were under the trees.  It had hit the 70s again, and the humidity had shot up; now the cooling air was heavy and damp, thick in my lungs and sinuses.  He couldn't find the website that let Lexy calculate midnight to the second, but he had the minute, at least.  It had barely changed, to 12:24.

He did all the things, and I did my jump, and there was the bright black again.

He'd brought a little folding step stool, the kind my mom uses to reach high cabinets.  He'd practiced jumping off it, *backward,* feet first.  His plan was to jump backward through the window; as soon as his feet went through I'd grab his hands.  Standing on the ground, *my* hands wouldn't go through.  As long as he could keep his grip, he could pull himself back by me.

He'd look around, come back, tell me what he saw.  Maybe Lexy was alive over there but couldn't find the window, and Kevin could lead him back through.  Or maybe Kevin could find treasure, pass it back to me.

I thought, maybe he'd get halfway through, fall on the edge of the window, cut himself in half.  But I didn't say that.  What would my parents do if I ran and told them half of Kevin was lying in their yard?

He set the step stool by the broken thread window to let me practice grabbing his hands as he jumped.  They felt clammy in the damp air.  He said even if I only caught one it would work.  And it would be on him, not me, to make sure he didn't lose his grip.  All I had to do was catch his hand and keep my feet on the ground.

So we did it.  He put his phone with mine, moved the stool, climbed up with his back to the window, then kicked himself off.  I saw his feet disappear, grabbed at his hands, caught just one of them.  His hand closed hard around my right wrist.  His body disappeared, his head, his loose arm and hand.

I expected my hand to slam into the black window.  I hoped it wouldn't hurt.

But I'd stood too far back.  As he disappeared, his grip on my wrist yanked me off my feet.  For a fraction of a second I was off the ground--and he pulled my hand through the window.  I landed falling, trying to get breath to scream because now the window's edge would cut *me* in half.

But I threw out my left hand, and with my feet back on the ground it thumped into the window and stopped me, the black as solid as before.  My right hand felt a weird sort of burning, itching sensation like I'd buried it in hot beach sand.  I braced my left hand against the black and shoved as hard as I could, and my right hand pulled back out, Kevin's hand still gripping it.

A few seconds later his head came through, and he started wheezing and coughing.  "What's wrong?" I cried.

"No-- <cough!>  No--air.  <cough!>"  He had blood on his lips, coughed blood onto my hand.  "Pull!  I <cough!> got him!"  I pulled, and he pulled, and Lexy's body came through the window.  Steam rolled off it in clouds.  I jerked back from it, afraid of being burned.  I knew he was dead.

This morning--Saturday--the skin of my right hand and half my forearm was deep red, like a really fresh bruise.  That's just what it was, I figured out.  Kevin managed to explain a bit before he passed out; I worked out the rest myself.  He said there was ground, a little light--everything looked like the glowing black--but there was no heat at all.

Over there, without air pressure, blood pressure had ruptured vessels in my skin.  It was like a big suck mark, a hickey over my entire hand.  It doesn't really hurt; it's a little tender when I type.

But Kevin was entirely in vacuum for a while; he got that red skin over his whole body.  His eyeballs didn't explode, none of that movie junk--but they're really bloodshot.  Worse, he's got ruptures all through his lungs.  He's in intensive care, on pure oxygen.  They say even if he doesn't get pneumonia from the blood and fluid in his lungs, he could still die from the damage, or be left crippled.

It took me longer to figure out why he didn't freeze.  See, space isn't really freezing cold, not like *Guardians of the Galaxy* when people's faces crystallize if they don't have a space suit.  When there's no air at all, instead of super cold you're kind of *insulated*.

In those few seconds, Kevin's upper body suffered from vacuum but not cold.  But the ground sucked heat from his sock feet--they'd frozen almost instantly.  Frostbite had killed flesh on the bottoms of his feet all the way to the bone; his wool socks had crumbled.  Holding Lexy's jacket--the nylon didn't get brittle--his hand had frozen too; if he survived, he'd lose the ends of his fingers.

When I pulled Kevin back, he was able to move, able to hold Lexy's jacket collar.  Kevin was able to step through, stand up unsteadily, pull Lexy after him.  He lifted Lexy with one hand, holding him clear of the window threads.

Lexy's stiff body was bent, partly doubled up, like he'd fallen on his side.  Kevin pulled him out of the black, put his feet on the ground, then Kevin's frozen feet and a new coughing fit doubled *him* over.  He lost his grip on Lexy.

The body fell toward me, steaming; I thought I'd be knocked flat, scalded.  But it seemed almost weightless as it struck my shoulder and spun away, falling on its face, then onto its side.  My shoulder felt burned.

I heard cracking sounds as it hit the ground.  I saw that Lexy's nose had shattered, the fingers of his left hand had snapped off.  He rolled sideways into a tree trunk, and his entire right arm broke off.  I did scream now, but it was breathless and weak.

Kevin had been there for a few seconds; the ground had frozen his feet.  But Lexy had been over there for a week, seven solid days of lying on ground without a bit of heat.  His flesh had frozen, then vacuum had pulled water from it, like freezer-burned steak you find forgotten behind the microwave lasagna.  His corpse only weighed thirty or forty pounds, most of the water gone.

When Kevin pulled him through, he steamed in the humid air--fog condensing around his frozen corpse.  I'd felt burning cold, not heat, on my shoulder.  He hadn't busted into a billion tiny chunks when he fell over, maybe because he was so dried out, but he was brittle enough his nose and hand had shattered and his arm had snapped off.  He turned white with frost as I watched.  Each broken finger gleamed white on dead leaves.

Kevin couldn't walk, and I couldn't carry him; I ran back to the house to wake up my dad, calling 911 on the way.  Before Dad got there, Kevin came to and dragged himself away from the window and Lexy's frosted body; my parents don't know about them yet.  Neither do the police.  I'm going to have to explain how in one week Lexy got freeze-dried and broken into pieces.

So I've spent all day typing this.  Maybe they'll believe me; probably they won't.  But how else will they explain what's caught in what's left of Lexy's left hand?  He had three.  Two fell on the ground when his fingers broke apart; I've got them here by my keyboard.  The third is still caught under his shriveled-up thumb, but I believe it's exactly the same as these.

They're coins, big around as an Oreo cookie, nearly as thick.  One side has three tall narrow trees, poplars, I think, growing on a hilltop.  The other side has a stone tower with battlements, two spears crossed above it.  I've googled the designs and can't find anything like them.

The designs are still sharp; the coins look nearly new.  For Lexy to grab three right by the black window, in what the internet says must have been less than a minute before he went unconscious, I'm guessing there were probably a metric assload of them lying around over there.  From the weight, from the color, from how they ring, from how there's no tarnish or corrosion, I'd say they're gold.
