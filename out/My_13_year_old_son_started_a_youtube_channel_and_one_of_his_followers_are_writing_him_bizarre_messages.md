[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kuqaxa/my_13_year_old_son_started_a_youtube_channel_and/)

It all started a couple of months ago when my son Jason turned 13 and begged my permission to start a YouTube channel. I know what you’re thinking. What harm could it do? Lots of other kids are doing it. Well, maybe I’m just old-fashioned and full of nostalgia for a time when kids didn’t spend obscene amounts of time nurturing their online presence to an audience of god knows who. If I had just followed my instinct, maybe none of this would have happened.

‘’Dad, you said I would be old enough to be on social media when I turned 13!’’

His big pleading eyes, those eyes he would always send my way when he really wanted something. In truth, I had promised him, when he was younger. Just to shut him up. I guess my hope was that he would grow out of it and find other hobbies or interests. No dice, unfortunately. Then there was the fact that he was getting bullied, and didn’t really have many things that gave him joy. I just wanted him to be happy, to have something he could be passionate about. What dad wouldn’t want that for their child? So I agreed.

He set up a channel where he would stream games, talk about trends, unpack things and just do silly bits here and there. Basic and innocent stuff really. In the beginning, I was worried. Would he be hurt if he didn’t get all the attention and subscribers he hoped for?

But needn’t have worried about that part. He quickly gained an audience. Not bank-breaking numbers or anything, but he reached about a thousand subscribers over the following 2 months. I saw how his eyes lit up when he talked about the content he was making and how many new subscribers he had gained this and that week. I was happy for him. Truly. Things hadn’t been easy since my wife, Jason’s biological mother, died when Jason was 9. I still hear the roaring screams of metal colliding, wheels screeching, and I still see what was left of her broken, twisted puddle of a face from time to time. Mercifully, Jase hadn’t been in the car that fateful night.

That was the one mercy.

The kid needed a break—we both did—and seeing him happy made me happy. Which made it even more disturbing, more heart-wrenching, when one of his followers started leaving increasingly bizarre comments on his videos.

I monitored his channel, of course. Both because I was proud of his progress and because I needed to be sure he was safe. The internet isn't kind, and anonymity makes monsters of men.

The user in question went by the name **Bonnies\_revenge**—either an unspeakably cruel coincidence or something far more calculated. Bonnie was Jason’s mother’s name.

At first, Jason didn’t seem to notice. And the comments, while eerie, weren’t overtly threatening—just strange, unsettling poetry scrawled beneath his videos like digital graffiti.

“Play the game, stay the same, never change.”

“Sitting in a dark cold place, wearing no face, waiting for grace.”

I thought maybe they were lyrics—cryptic, maybe edgy, but not dangerous. Until I read another:

“There’s no escape from cyberspace, this final resting place, humanity undone, waiting for you in carwreck.”

My stomach churned. Something felt deeply wrong.

I considered disabling the comments entirely, but when I brought it up, Jason’s expression fell. His eyes hollowed with a familiar emptiness I hadn’t seen in months.

“There are so many other comments, Dad. Nice ones. Don’t let some weirdo ruin it.”

He was right. Most of the messages were kind. Encouraging. And Jason brushed off the weird ones. Called it nothing—*just some weirdo.*

I convinced myself it was probably a bot. Or maybe a troll with bad taste in poetry. Something mindless. Harmless.

That was my biggest mistake.

For a while, it seemed the user had lost interest. Their bizarre little rhymes vanished. Jason returned to his usual self—or so I thought.

Then I noticed the change.

He withdrew. Grew quiet. The spark I’d seen reignite was starting to dim.

When I finally asked what was wrong, he didn’t meet my eyes.

“The weirdo is back, Dad,” he whispered. “And they’re talking about Mom.”

I checked the comments again. And there they were—new messages, more explicit, more personal. More horrifying.

“Jason, it’s mommy. Can you find my face? It’s gone, honey. Mommy needs her face.”

“I think my face might be somewhere on the asphalt around Becker Street. Will you go check, Jase?”

“Jasey, honey, it’s cold… won’t you come warm mommy with your strong arms?”

I stared, heart racing, at the screen.

This wasn’t random. This was targeted. Personal. It had to be someone who knew us.

My mind raced. One of the kids from school? One of those little monsters that used to torment him?

Fueled by rage and desperation, I called every parent I could reach. Demanded answers. Accused. Begged. Most were shocked I’d even suggest their precious angels could be involved. Some were offended. None were helpful.

I got nowhere.

Frustrated, I clicked on **Bonnies\_revenge’s** profile.

No bio. No links. Just two short video clips—thumbnails shrouded in grainy shadow. Something about them felt *wrong*, like the air before a lightning strike.

My hand hovered over the first.

Click.

The video opened to near-blackness. Barely audible at first, a low, wet static crackled like something breathing through water. Gradually, the scene materialized—trees swaying like corpses hung from invisible nooses, their limbs creaking in the wind. The camera was handheld, but steady—too steady—gliding unnaturally across cracked asphalt slicked with rain.

Then the sound came.

Not from the camera, but from *within* the video—deep, glottal whispers, almost mechanical, repeating something over and over. I leaned closer, straining to understand.

"Come see me. Come see me. Come see me..."

The camera tilted up slightly. I felt the blood drain from my face.

Becker Street.

The same corner where my wife had died.

But that’s impossible. No one else had been there that night. No one could’ve filmed this.

The lens crept closer to the ground, closing in on something just out of frame. Red. Shapeless. Organic. Bits of torn fabric clung to it like wet paper. The video froze just as something slick, pulpy, and disturbingly human began to come into focus.

The screen pulsed.

I shut it off.

But something gnawed at me. Some grotesque magnetism.

I clicked the second clip.

At first, there was nothing but black.

Then a sharp, metallic whine screamed through the speakers—like brakes locking just before impact. It faded into gurgling, wet breathing. The camera jolted on, and I saw...

Her face.

Or what was left of it.

Pressed flat like a mask, stitched with shadow and road grit, bits of bone visible through shredded skin. One eye was missing. The other dangled by a thread of sinew, twitching gently—no, *watching*.

Watching *me*.

A trickle of dark fluid oozed from her nose. Her lips peeled apart with a sickening, sticky sound.

Then the mouth moved.

A whisper rasped through the speakers—dry, brittle, childlike:

“Jason…?”

Then louder, cracked and unnatural:

"Give mommy a kiss?"

As the voice distorted, it split into several—some sounding like an adults mocking imitation of a child, others like distant echoes of my wife’s laughter. The screen warped, pulsing like a heartbeat, the face pressing closer, closer...

Then both eyes—hollow, ruined—snapped to focus directly at the lens.

No.

Not *at* the lens.

At me.

I recoiled and slammed the laptop shut. My breath came in short, ragged gasps. Cold sweat soaked my shirt. My pulse hammered in my ears.

What I had seen defied logic. It couldn’t be real.

And yet—

I knew it was.

After the panic subsided, I thought really hard about how to proceed.

That second video—her face—couldn’t have been real. It *shouldn’t* have been. But something deep inside me knew it wasn’t just a prank. Not just some troll with a grotesque imagination. The movements were too... *intentional*. Too *knowing*.

I couldn’t sleep that night. I stayed up replaying everything—every comment, every flicker of Jason’s fading joy. Then I did something I hadn’t done in years.

I opened Bonnie’s old laptop.

It had sat in the attic since the accident, gathering dust and forgotten time. Something compelled me. Maybe it was desperation, maybe a sliver of madness. I powered it on. The login screen greeted me like a ghost smiling through the years. I guessed the password—Jason’s birthdate.

It worked.

The desktop loaded slowly, glitching slightly, like the machine hadn’t quite forgiven being abandoned. I scrolled through her folders. Photos, spreadsheets from her job, bookmarks. All ordinary. All familiar.

Until I found a folder I didn’t recognize.

It was named *mirrorbone*.

Inside were audio files. Dozens of them. None labeled. Just time stamps. I clicked the most recent one—dated two days before her death.

It was a distorted recording. Static-laced. Bonnie’s voice was faint, but unmistakable.

"...Jason was sleep-talking again. But it wasn’t his voice."

A pause. Breathing.

"He said things… things about a place with no doors, no sky. A cold place, under wires and lights that hum."

Another crackle. Then a whisper—*not Bonnie’s*—cut through.

“You’re not supposed to be here.”

I yanked the headphones off. My pulse thundered.

What the hell had she been recording?

More importantly—*why*?

I returned to Jason’s channel. The comments were gone. All of them. Even the nice ones. As if someone had wiped the slate clean. But his subscriber count had jumped—drastically. Tens of thousands now. The number ticked upward in real time, like a living thing feeding off the screen.

I opened his most recent video. The thumbnail showed Jason smiling, holding up some new fancy energy drink for a goofy review.

But when I clicked play…

The video began with Jason, silent. Staring at the camera. Expressionless. His skin looked pale. Wrong. And the audio was warped—low hums, backwards murmurs, like the soundtrack of a nightmare. I swear I heard my wife singing, somewhere between the muffled audio.

Then, a voice—distorted—overlaid his silence.

“Keep growing your subscribers. Make mommy proud.’’

I scrubbed forward. The screen glitched. The background behind him *shifted*—just for a frame or two. From his bedroom… to something else.

A dark hallway.

A glint of metal.

A shape hanging from the ceiling.

The video ended abruptly.

The comments were turned off.

I checked the upload time.

It had gone live while we were sleeping.

Jason swore he hadn’t posted it.

“I didn’t film that,” he said, voice trembling. “I swear. I didn’t.”

That night, I heard whispering from his room.

Not him.

A woman’s voice.

It was singing.

Something slow and wet, syllables dragging like a body across gravel.

I opened his door.

He was sitting upright in bed, eyes closed. As if he was sleeping. Yet he was…

Smiling.

From the shadows near his desk, the screen of his tablet flickered on by itself.

The wallpaper had changed.

It was her face.

What was left of it.

Chanting in an impossible language.

I felt the only choice was to have him shut down his channel. I wrestled with the choice for days.

Every night, I hovered over the laptop, eyes flicking between the latest comments from **Bonnies\_revenge** and Jason’s hopeful, eager face. Part of me screamed to shut it all down—to pull the plug on the channel, to protect my boy from the growing darkness that seeped through those comments. From whatever wanted to hurt him. The twisted messages were poisoning him. His laughter was less frequent; his eyes dulled with every “weirdo” poem or chilling line about his mother.

But Jason... Jason begged me not to.

“Dad, it’s my thing. It’s the one good thing I have. Please don’t take it away.”

I saw the fear lurking behind his plea—the fragile hope that still clung to those subscriber milestones, the fleeting moments when he felt like himself again. I wanted to shield him from harm, but I couldn’t rob him of his last light.

So, I let the channel stay alive, promising myself I would protect him in other ways. But that promise was hollow.

One night, after the channel’s comment section was flooded with another round of **Bonnies\_revenge’s** sick rhymes, I suggested again that we shut down the channel—for good this time.

Jason’s face fell, his smile breaking like a fragile vase shattering on cold tile. “Please, Dad, I need this. Just a little longer.”

I swallowed the knot tightening in my throat and nodded, my heart breaking.

But the nightmare didn’t stop.

The next morning, Jason came to me, voice trembling.

“They found me on Instagram,” he whispered. “Same username… same creepy stuff.”

And then on TikTok.

And Snapchat.

No matter where he posted, no matter how often we deleted accounts or changed usernames, **Bonnies\_revenge** followed.

Like a shadow with endless reach.

Like a storm that never passed.

The messages shifted, adapting to each platform’s style—but always the same chilling undertone. Personal. Knowing. Cruel.

I realized then the truth I didn’t want to face:

This wasn’t just about a YouTube channel.

This wasn’t just some anonymous troll.

This was a relentless, personal hunt.

And the monster wasn’t going away.
