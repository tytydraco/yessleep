[\[Part 28\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1ieabf5/the_call_of_the_breach_part_28/)

“Okay, move on through.” One of our gate guards waved at the small family of five miserable civilians his squad had just finished searching, and they shuffled through the checkpoint towards our processing teams.

From the guard tower over the gate, I watched as the long line of disgruntled people inched along, faces bleak, heads hung low in exhaustion. Acrid smoke remained in the air from last night’s fires, and the amount of people who waited outside the university gates to be admitted for aid, shelter, or medical attention was staggering. Each had to be checked for weapons in case Josh broke his word about the fragile ceasefire we had with him, and it was an extensive process. Women and girls had to be searched by female guards, children couldn’t be searched without their guardians present, and many wounded or old people needed assistance to stand long enough for our soldiers to do their work. Troublemakers who tried to cut the line or push through the cordon had to be dealt with, often with brutal effectiveness, and exterior patrols from our forces roamed the line to be sure none of the civilians hurt each other while waiting their turn. After being up all night, running across the city to put out fires, rescue wounded people, and secure strategic buildings from Josh’s retreating bandits, our men were falling asleep on their feet. Oddly enough, the one advantage we had came in the form of our guests: Colonel Riken and his ELSAR assault troops.

They had worked overtime to help us secure the city walls, sweep the neighborhoods, and deal with a few small groups of bandits that seemed intent on disobeying the ceasefire. With their advanced heavy vehicles, the ELSAR men had been able to shove rubble right off the road, clear lanes for ambulances, and even plunged into fiery buildings to haul civilians out with nothing to protect them but gas masks. A few had been wounded in turn, but they kept going, encouraging our men, sharing water and rations, even giving our younger leaders tips on how to handle difficult situations. It was thanks to them our refugee processing center was working at all, and at the colonel’s request, ELSAR had flown in several more helicopter loads of emergency supplies to care for the victims of the night’s massacre. Much of the university green had been converted to an aid camp, with army tents set up to house the homeless, and a soup kitchen opened in the cafeteria. Sandra and her researchers tended to the injured, which continued to flow in by the dozens, while the rest of us slogged through more search-and-rescue efforts within the ruined northern district.

Still adorned in his battle attire of slate-gray armored plate carrier, rifle, and a ballistic helmet hooked onto his belt, Colonel Riken strode to the railing beside me and rested a gloved hand on it with an idle gaze over the city. “Seems the tide is slowing.”

Fighting a wave of sleep-deprived dizziness, I leaned on the railing with both forearms, the early morning sun not enough to cut through the icy breeze. “There’s probably at least a hundred more out there who can’t get to us, either trapped in rubble, or too scared to come out. Over sixty houses burnt to the ground last night, and there’s no power anywhere in the northern district. They’re going to freeze to death if we don’t find them in time.”

He eyed me for a moment, and something like a thin smile crossed Colonel Riken’s face. “I didn’t expect an insurgent to be so concerned with the fate of provincials.”

*I didn’t expect to be working alongside ELSAR to keep the peace.*

“They’re civilians.” I rubbed at my eyes, and smelled the dried blood that stained my hands from countless hours of dragging wounded to our trucks. “Chris says we have to earn the support of everyone if we want to lead. Up until last night, I thought we were doing a good job.”

Riken let out a weary sigh and tugged at the shoulder strap on his plate carrier, showing a momentary lapse in his stoic veneer. “Welcome to my world, Captain. It’s not so easy, being the one who has to keep order instead of sowing chaos. Still, I’m not surprised that things turned out the way they did.”

I narrowed my eyes at him, too tired to be concerned about how prickly my words sounded. “Because we’re a bunch of murderous terrorists, is that it?”

To my surprise, he made a low chuckle, as if amused by my vitriol. “No. I’ve just been playing this game for a long time. Iraq, Afghanistan, it’s always the same story; the ‘freedom fighters’ win, and immediately start doing all the things they accused the former regime of doing. Reprisal killings, secret death squads, disarming political enemies, it’s standard procedure at this stage.”

In my head, I saw again the bodies on the street, heard the terrified screams, smelled the oily stench of burning houses as the marauders rampaged through the town. My throat tightened at the memory of Lucille turning her back on me to run away with Josh, and the colonel’s words rang true even if they were infuriating. How could our former enemy make more sense than some in our own camp?

*Are we really no different than all those war-torn places we used to watch on the news?*

“Chris doesn’t want to govern like that.” Folding my arms against the chill, I turned around to press the small of my back against the rail, and thus avoided having to look at the pitiful tide of humanity outside the college’s walls. “He’s a good man, and if we can just get the fighting to stop, he could make a lot of reforms. This isn’t how we wanted things to go.”

He watched me for a moment in silence, and Colonel Riken picked at a small loose string on his black tactical gloves. “You keep talking about Commander Dekker, but I know that he wasn’t the one who brokered that ceasefire last night. I also know congratulations are in order, in regard to you and him. He seems to let you have a lot of free reign.”

Unsure whether to be pleased or insulted, I found myself blushing instead, the only warmth my face could come up with in the frigid gusts that raked across Black Oak’s smoldering skyline. “Chris is my commander, first and foremost. Our personal relationship doesn’t mean I don’t respect that. He trusts me, that’s all.”

Picking up on my last sentence, Riken cocked his close-shaven head to once side. “That’s exactly my point. He trusts you enough that he let your peace offer to the terrorists stand. Some leaders wouldn’t be willing to do that, which means you *do* have a significant amount of influence over him, whether you want to admit it or not. So, tell me . . . what do you want?”

Taken aback by his question, I blinked at him, heart skipping an uncertain beat. “Sorry?”

“I’ve kept my ear to the ground, Captain.” He stared hard into my eyes, with a fearsome ease that made me think of a lion relaxing in the shade of a tree, calm, but dangerous all the same. “Learned a lot about you. It’s not every girl who climbs the ladder from a nobody outsider to the fiancé of an insurgent commander in just a few months. Thanks to your recent promotion to Head Ranger, you have enough guns at your command to eliminate anyone else who could oppose you, and you are the only member of your coalition with ties to both New Wilderness and Ark River. I’d wager if you wanted, you could talk Dekker into anything, to include passing or not passing certain laws that would give him more centralized power over the region, and thus indirectly to you as well. If I was giving an intel brief, I would classify you as a ‘person of interest’, particularly if I was looking for a coup leader, so I ask again; what is it that *you* want for this place?”

I fumbled for words, stunned. With all the whirlwind of our march to Black Oak, I’d never thought of my own potential, but now that he said it, I realized it made sense. Sean was still bedridden, Chris trusted me implicitly, and many of the combat forces of our coalition were either in my faction, or distant kin to me due to my genetic mutation. If I wanted control of the tiny nation we were carving out for ourselves, all it would take was a few loyal snipers and enough lies in the Assembly to blame Josh’s bandits for it. I could eliminate the factions, centralize the votes in myself, and rule all of Barron County from a cozy room in Black Oak. No one could challenge me, and with the nuclear launch panel in my hands, I would be the undisputed leader for years to come. Power unlike anything I’d ever had before could be a few days away, right at my fingertips.

*I could make sure all the reforms Chris talked about would pass. I could avoid all the council drama, handle things myself, to be sure it gets done right this time. I could force Josh to surrender, make Koranti give up his ambitions on the border, and the people would worship the peace I gave them.*

Like a bolt of lightning, the alluring visions of grandeur were shattered by new thoughts; memories of gunshots in the old mechanical building in New Wilderness during the coup, hungry rioters in Ark River chanting as they threw stones at our Rangers, or the smell of burning human flesh as corpses roasted while Josh’s terror cells launched their second revolution. My rosy fantasies of myself took on a sickly pallor, showing a cold and corrupt Hannah, aloof and uncaring, cruel and ruthless while she ground the people under her heel. I saw streets filled with blood as protesters were mowed down by soldiers, saw prison camps filled with new waves of dissidents, heard loudspeakers blare over the city as my guards confiscated weapons at checkpoints on every corner. With absolute, unchecked power, I would be no better than Koranti, Carter, O’Brian, or any of the rest. It wasn’t a dream; it was a nightmare, one that made my guts churn with a cascade of nausea.

*Chris wouldn’t stand for it. Sooner or later, he would stand up to me the same as he did to Jamie. I would have to . . . oh God, I would have to . . .*

“Power always corrupts.” Fighting the urge to vomit at the mental image of Chris standing in front of a firing squad, I screwed my eyes shut and recited the words he had said to me so many times when dreaming of a better society in our room. “No one is immune. The people should have a choice in how they are governed, and those they elect should respect that choice. That’s what Chris believes, and it’s what I believe.”

One of Colonel Riken’s graying eyebrows rose on his forehead. “Clearly not everyone in your alliance is in agreement.”

“Josh is a monster.” I glowered at my boots, hateful of the shame I felt over last night’s events, a black stain on our coalition’s reputation that would never wash out. “Even if he was right about the collaborators, what he did was unacceptable. We can’t rule through fear, and we won’t; anyone who wants to try can burn in hell.”

He studied me for a moment, and to my surprise, a flicker of something like approval traveled through the colonel’s weathered face. “Congratulations.”

“For what?” Puzzled at his warmer demeanor, I glanced down at my collar, where Chris’s engagement ring hung from a small chain, to keep my hands clear for working.

Colonel Riken propped his elbow against the railing and threw me a pointed look. “Living longer. First rule of counterinsurgency; find out who the leaders are and eliminate the most radical. That way, the moderates are more likely to come to power, and the situation is less volatile in the long run.”

A slight chill ran down my spine, one the early winter winds couldn’t take credit for, at the realization that he’d been sizing me up the entire time, ready to arrange my death if I had shown an iota of political aggression. “So, that’s why you’re here?”

Squinting at the horizon, Colonel Riken made a modest half nod, his face pensive. “Among other reasons.”

Intrigued and unnerved, I mimicked his pose to look out over the snow-strewn rubble of what had once been a modern town. “Such as?”

His light blue eyes flicked my way, and the colonel leaned closer with a secretive tone. “Let’s just say corporate doesn’t see eye-to-eye with those of us who actually wear the uniform. I volunteered for this mission because I wanted to be sure the right thing got done for once, and I knew I couldn’t trust the suits to actually follow through. They’ve proven to be more of a hindrance as far as mission effectiveness goes, and I’m not the only one who feels that way.”

*Ah, so the dissension in the ranks isn’t limited to the enlisted men.*

I eyed the rank on his uniform collar, eagles with their wings outstretched sewn in black stitching to compliment the slate-colored cloth. “So, that makes you a ‘person of interest’ as well then?”

With a series of patient tugs, Colonel Riken pulled off his gloves to stuff them into his pistol belt, and I caught the gleam of a plain silver ring on his left hand, one I hadn’t noticed before. It had never occurred to me that he might be married, that this mysterious officer of our enemy could have a life outside of ELSAR, but judging from the faded skin beneath it, he’d worn the band for quite a long time. Perhaps he too missed his home, wanted to go back there, and yearned to put Barron County far behind him. Perhaps he had children who awaited his return, or even grandchildren, who had little to no idea of what their familial patriarch did for a living. At any rate, it gave the colonel a more human edge in my mind, and some of my earlier distrust began to fade.

*He might not be that much older than Dad, just grayer, as if all the stress of command has aged him faster than others. Does he have a daughter my age, or a son? Does his wife know where he is right now, or does she think he’s somewhere overseas?*

In spite of my obvious stare he didn’t look at me, instead choosing to watch his men tending to their duties alongside our troops in the courtyard below, Colonel Riken’s fingers interlaced in front of him. “It all depends how this beacon mission goes. ELSAR used to mean something, something more than what it is now, and I want to see us return to that purpose. I’ve lost too many good men on wild goose chases for corporate lackies that don’t understand the realities on the ground. If we can shut this thing down, then it’s time to fry bigger fish . . . and I don’t expect I’ll need many suits to do it.”

We both stood in silence for a while, and I pondered what Colonel Riken had said. ELSAR appeared to have fissures in its leadership as well, albeit dangerous ones that I didn’t fully understand. It seemed the mercenaries were tiring of Koranti’s leadership, but could it all be a ruse? What if Riken was simply trying to get my guard down, to find out who the real power-players were, and thus know who to target for a second offensive on the city? With Josh firmly cast into the irredeemable path of his banditry, we couldn’t afford more problems for our fledgling government, but could we afford to miss a potential ally? Even if I had shunned the idea of seizing power for myself, did I dare to trust the man who had incinerated Collingswood with a barrage of missiles? It made me wish that Jamie was still here to give me advice, and at her face floating up in the back of my head, I felt my heart twinge.

“You should get some rest.” Colonel Riken nodded toward the main campus behind us. “I can take over from here. And Brun? I’d rather we keep this conversation between ourselves, for the time being.”

Throwing him an understanding nod, I climbed down the tower catwalk, my mind a fuzzy mixture of speculation an exhaustion. Once more, I found myself caught in the middle of a cyclone of political intrigue, one I hadn’t bargained on when I first stepped out of Matt’s Honda all those nights ago. On one hand, I had the chance to help Chris shape a new future for everyone, a future with order, peace, and justice. On the other hand, if we failed, or if we succumbed to the same temptations that had felled others in our fragile coalition, we could plunge Barron County into a second iteration of violence that would doom us all. The weight of our tiny world rested on our shoulders . . . and I had climbed high enough that I shared the burden as much as my soon-to-be husband.

Making my way back to the university buildings, I climbed the stairs of the dorms to our room and stumbled through the door. It was warm, enough to make my drowsiness even worse, and I shoved the door shut with one relieved kick of my heel.

A soft snore caught my ear, and I rubbed my eyes to look at the room.

Chris lay slumped over the desk, and it took me a moment to realize he had fallen asleep on top of his map, still in uniform, pencil in one hand. His rifle sat propped against the desk nearby, and it was clear he’d been working right up until unconsciousness took him, boots on his feet, war belt around his narrow waist. I’d seen him do a check on some of our troops no more than an hour ago, so I knew he hadn’t been this way for long.

Watching his peaceful face half-buried in between his arms, I felt a smile work itself across my lips, gooey warmth sparking to life in my heart.

*If only we could just run off somewhere and spend the rest of our lives hiding from the world.*

I shucked my boots and equipment to cross the room and gently kissed his forehead. “You’re going to miss lunch at this rate, Commander.”

Chris stirred, blinked at me, and winced as he sat upright to rub his neck. “Tell me I wasn’t asleep.”

Kneeling, I unlaced his boots one by one and tugged them off his feet. “Do you usually snore when you’re awake?”

“Very funny.” He didn’t resist as I tossed his boots aside, but Chris glanced back at his mess of papers and maps, with a morose look on his haggard face. “How are things at the gate?”

“Riken’s got the situation under control.” I decided not to mention our conversation, more out of a desire to shut my frazzled mind off than a wish to honor the colonel’s request. “I thought maybe I’d shower and try to snag a few hours. Since you’re here, let’s make it an even four.”

He shook his head and Chris rubbed at his face with one calloused hand. “I have so much work to do . . .”

Rising, I leaned on his shoulders with both hands and met his lips with mine. Even half-dead on my feet, it was like an electric shock to my blood, sending pleasant tingles down my spine, and granted me a temporary reprieve from the horrid memories of the previous night. Maybe I was being selfish, maybe I was doing this more for myself than him, but at this point, I didn’t want to stop. I needed something, *anything*, and Chris was a surefire way to make me feel alive.

As our lips parted, I gave him a playful peck on the tip of his nose. “It can wait. Four hours, and you can go right back to it. Please?”

He seemed to sense the need in my voice, and Chris brough his arms up to pull me into his lap, the two of us holding each other in silence. I nestled my head into his shoulder, shut my eyes, and tried to not see corpses, fire, or rubble as I did so.

“I need a shower.” Chris grunted softly in my ear. “You too. It’ll help you sleep.”

Curled up in his arms, I yawned, ready to stay this way forever. “You wanna carry me?”

I’d meant it in jest, but something in Chris’s face changed, and before I could say another word, I found myself lifted into the air.

With a startled yelp, I laced both arms around his neck and eyed the floor below me. “I didn’t mean—”

“Be careful what you wish for, *pragtige*.” He made an ornery wink, as if invigorated by my challenge, and carried me to the bathroom where he set me back down on the cool tile floor.

We stood there for another long moment, holding each other in mute acknowledgment of the thing we didn’t want to talk about, of the smoke that still rose outside our single bedroom window across the city, of the dozens of graves that were being dug in the local cemeteries this very second. If I had been shocked by last night, I could tell it hurt Chris to his core, tormented by the rigid code of honor and justice he’d always maintained as long as I’d known him. I knew it was part of the reason he would have remained at that desk, driving himself to the point of collapse, in a bid to somehow make up for the horrific crimes committed by a former brother of his coalition.

“Ladies first.” He tried a rakish smile, but I could see the weariness in his sky-blue irises and noted how he swayed on his heels.

“Nope.” Determined to put him first for once, I shook my head, and reached to tug at his uniform jacket, undoing each button one in a way that made my groggy brain find new energy. “You’re faster than me in there. I’ll just use up all the hot water.”

I got him down to his T-shirt before my own trepidation got the better of me, and I paused, feeling a new sheet of flame course through my cheeks.

*It’s just a shirt; it would be no different if you were at the pool together.*

His eyes met mine, and Chris, slid both hands over my shoulders with a light touch that made happy goosebumps appear on my skin. “You keep that up and I’ll drag you in with me.”

“Who says you’d have to?” I stepped past him so he couldn’t see the redness that burned hot across my ears and face but still grinned to myself. Teasing him was a nice distraction, and I craved the way he ate me up with his hungry gaze. It made the stress of Colonel Riken’s words lessen somewhat, though I couldn’t quite shake them completely.

Sucking in a shuddery breath, I strode to one end of the small bathroom where a little stool lay under the towel rack and plunked down on it with my back to him. I heard the rustle of cloth as he finished the process on his own, and then the rush of water as the shower came on. The fact that he hadn’t insisted on me leaving was testament to both Chris’s exhaustion and the creeping level of daring that we toyed with like delicious fire in the little spare time we had together. While I would have savored the closeness of being mere feet from his naked form, even if I couldn’t see him, my thoughts continued to gnaw at me with annoying persistence.

*A fifth of our resistance fighters left this morning, which means Josh has enough manpower to make things really difficult for us. He won’t stick his head out while ELSAR is giving us aid, but what happens when they leave? He already has it out for Chris, and if there was ever any good will between us, it’s gone now.*

“You okay?”

Time had moved on without me, and I looked up to see him already finished, a white towel wrapped around his waist, droplets of water flecked across his muscled shoulders. Chris’s hair lay ruffled across his head in uncombed maple-syrup-colored waves, and in the soft glow of the bathroom light every contour of his bare torso seemed all the sharper. A part of me hoped I would never get used to that sight, taut muscle stretched tight under satin skin, and the fuzzy warmth in my core began to heat to blast-furnace levels.

“I’m fine.” Peeling my socks off, I slipped past him, and began to undress once Chris took up my seat with his back to me.

“You know, there are more creative ways of making you talk, Miss Brun.” Still facing the opposite wall, he cocked his head to one side to accentuate his point, and I rolled my eyes with a pleased smile.

“I’m not scared of you, Mr. Dekker.” Dropping the last of my clothing, I looked at the ripples of tendon and sinew in his back, the bathroom air cool on my skin. It hit me that I’d spoken the truth in more ways than I’d intended; I wasn’t frightened of him anymore, not like this. He’d likely seen me naked before, on the operating table in New Wilderness after my stabbing, but this was different. I was conscious, I was healthy, and now I stood perhaps four feet from him. All it would take was a simple turn of his head, and Chris would see me. Had it been a month or to prior, I would have been petrified, embarrassed, a nervous self-conscious wreck, but now I lingered for a purposeful few seconds longer, daring fate or chance to push us over the edge.

Ever the committed gentleman, Chris didn’t turn to look, but I could tell from how he sat at a slight angle that he knew, and I caught a slight red tinge in the tips of his ears.

*I love you too.*

Basking in the satisfaction of knowing, I stepped through the glass door of the shower and turned the hot water on.

“There is something I needed to talk to you about.” Chris said from the other side of the frosted-glass wall, as I worked to scrub my hair under the torrent of steamy water.

“If it’s about last night, I’d honestly rather not.” I gritted my teeth against the memory of Lucille’s hardened expression, the pain threatening to resurface with a vengeance.

He sighed, and I heard him shift on the stool. “It’s not, technically. It’s about us. Our wedding.”

I froze under the showerhead, and bit my lip, nervousness returning. Had I done something to upset him? “Okay. Shoot.”

Chris was silent for several seconds. “I think we should get married tomorrow.”

My head whipped around so fast I got a face full of gold-streaked brown hair, the tangled strands like octopus tentacles clinging to my face. Emotions clustered in my sleep-deprived brain with similar chaos, and I had to force words out of my mouth with sheer willpower. “Are . . . are you serious?”

His tone oozed with tension, as though Chris had known this wouldn’t be an easy conversation, and perhaps already regretted bringing it up. “I know it’s unfair, and given everything, it seems like bad timing, but I think we need to. We’re out of time, Hannah. We’re going into the Breach tomorrow night, and I don’t want to risk losing you before you’re truly mine.”

Bracing myself against the cold plastic wall of the shower, I stared down at my bare toes and tried to decide what to think or feel. Truth be told, I didn’t want my wedding to be tomorrow, simply because I wanted to be happy when that day came, and I wasn’t happy now. Yes, being with Chris made me feel better, but the wounds of Lucille’s betrayal were still fresh, and being in front of a lot of people had always made me anxious. I would have preferred a small, simple ceremony with a handful of friends, nothing fancy or extravagant, and certainly nothing that our political future rode on.

*Come on Hannah don’t be so selfish. He wouldn’t have said it if he hadn’t put a lot of thought into the matter. Chris needs your support, not your silence.*

In an effort to speed up my shower, I lathered soap all over myself and did my best to be diplomatic. “I get what you mean. I just think it might be taken the wrong way, what with last night and all. The public might see it as an insult if we celebrate so close to the tragedy.”

The stool creaked, and Chris’s voice echoed closer now, as he paced back and forth on the tilework. “That’s actually part of it. I spoke with Adam, and some of the other faction leaders. They seem to think we should make the wedding public . . . and pair it with a community food program to improve our public image. I told them I wanted to talk it over with you first.”

His shadow stopped just on the other side of the glass divider, and I could see him hang his head, Chris doing his best to explain the situation to me in delicate terms.

“Look, I know you’d hate it, the pomp and circumstance bit, the crowds.” Chris scratched at his wet hair and sighed. “But the fact is, if we’re going to be the face of the coalition, we need to win the people over. Free food is good, but the populace needs more than that; they need hope. Us getting married shows them that we’re confident the future is going to be worth fighting for. I won’t make you do it, you know that. I just think it might be a necessary move for us to smooth things over after the massacre.”

Swallowing an anxious lump in my throat, I started to rinse off, running my fingers through my hair. “So, we don’t really have a choice, right?”

His shadow turned to look at me, the glass obscuring my naked form enough that I knew he couldn’t see details, but enough that Chris would have met my eye had I been outside with him. “Your happiness means more to me than anything, Hannah. It’s our wedding, and to be honest, I don’t want to use it as a political tool either, but like you said, we’re not in a good position to argue. Still, if you say no then it’s no, politics be damned.”

I watched his shoulders sag with the heavy implications of our predicament, and standing there, under the hot water, I found my apprehension replaced with a pang of sympathy. He was caught in this the same as me, and yet Chris didn’t have the ability to distance himself from it like I could by hiding behind him. He was the Commander, possibly the future president, and that meant the buck stopped with him. If the nation had a need, he had to fill it, even if that meant sacrificing his own personal designs to do so. As Head Ranger, I only had to care for our home faction and combat troops; he had to watch over everyone, coalition and civilian alike.

*And he’d throw it all away for me, without asking twice.*

Resisting the urge to reach out and pull him in, I pressed one hand to the shower door, and on the other side, his hand rose to do the same, the two of us kept apart by a mere eighth inch of steamy glass.

“My place is with you.” I looked at his hazy outline from under the waterfall of the faucet, knowing Chris could hear the adoration in my voice. “No matter what. Even if the whole world is watching . . . I want to marry you tomorrow.”

He stepped closer to the partition, and I could just make out his appreciative smile on the other side. “I love you, *pragtige*.”

Shutting the water off, I slid the shower door open enough to poke my head around the edge and caught his lips with mine.

*Maybe it’s not such a bad idea after all. Eve was right, this waiting thing is getting old. Besides, he could use some ‘stress relief’ as much as I.*

Chris pressed a towel into my hands, and I took it with a coy flourish, noting how his jaw clenched like my fiancé had to exercise supreme restraint not to pounce on me. “And I you. Sure you don’t want to hop in? Water’s still hot.”

“If I do, we’ll never make it to the alter.” He rasped, as if he too was nearing the ends of patience in his traditional boundaries. “My *ouma* would skin me alive if I did something like that. Honestly, she’d probably thrash me good if she knew we were . . .”

With the soft cotton towel wrapped around me, I stepped out, and Chris seemed to lose his train of thought.

Even after all my flirting, his ravenous, worshipful gaze brought a shy wave of crimson to my cheeks and sent my brain into a glorious tailspin.

*I will never get enough of that look.*

Chris enclosed me in his arms, the feeling of his skin on mine like the most intoxicating liquor in the world, and I rested my forehead on his chest. The smell of his clean skin, the snug balminess of the bathroom as the steam hung in the air, made me want to forget everything for the rest of the day and stay buried under the covers with him. Chris’s fingertips trailed up and down the exposed portion of my back, stopping where the towel began to return to my neck in gentle strokes. I let my palms smooth over his torso in appreciative exploration, but found they were most attracted to the space over his heart, where I could just make out the flutter of his pulse beneath the layers of muscle.

“Have you heard from Jamie recently?” He broke the silence to whisper into my ear, and ran a hand over my damp hair in a way that would have made me shiver with delight if it weren’t for the subject at hand.

“Not since a day or two ago.” I bored into the flesh of his collarbone with my eyes, trying not to picture Jamie’s forlorn countenance as the gates of Ark River shut her out. “She’s alive, so that’s something. I asked her to come here.”

Chris angled his head to give me a curious look. “And?”

With a depressed grimace, I tightened my arms around him, wishing I could rip the guilt out of my chest. “She said no.”

I didn’t need to see his expression to know it registered disappointment. “She always was too stubborn for her own good.”

Tears brimmed in my eyes, and I sniffled them back as best I could. “I miss her. I’m worried she’s going to do something to herself out there. I can’t lose Jamie . . . aside from you, she’s all I’ve got.”

Chris’s handsome face drew into a serious, but contemplative impasse, and he seemed deep in thought.

At last, he tucked a finger under my chin to raise my eyes to his and kissed me. “Don’t worry about it, alright? We’ll figure something out. Now, to bed with you.”

Again, he scooped me up in spite of my squawks of weak protest and carried me back into our room. We dressed the same as we’d undressed, though I caught a few glimpses of him in the reflection on a nearby water glass and almost died with the fire it produced in my core. Chris must have done something similar, as his face took on that adorable shade of red when we finally turned around, and his hands shook a little as if from excitement.

*You’re lucky I’m so tired, otherwise you’d be in danger, Mr. Dekker.*

Crawling in between the fluffy white sheets, I set a four-hour alarm on my battered scrap-made alarm clock, and Chris ran a brush through my hair to help it dry faster.
