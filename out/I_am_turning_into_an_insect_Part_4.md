I molted recently, It was the most painful since I first got into this mess, I could feel my bones loosening, my carapace fading, and my flesh warping as I changed.

Eventually, I crawled out of the mess of flesh and blood, I had gone from 25% to 100, It was finished, I was a monster now.

Yet still, my mind remains, and I feel shame for how hideous I look now.

I am 2x my normal size, My phone had broken when I tried to pick it up with my new strength.

For quite a while, I was in despair now that I had no connection to the outside world.

...That was, until a new guard arrived.

His name was Buddy, well, that was what his nametag said, and he acted so much kinder than the other workers.

He didn't laugh at my misfortune or hit me, In fact, during the night of my molting, He reached through the bars and patted my head, saying it was going to be ok, that the pain was temporary.

When I gave him the broken pieces of my phone, to throw out, He took it, and gave me something in return, A tablet.

Buddy is the main person guarding my cell, and it helps preserve my sanity.

Instead of yelling at me or staying silent, he talks to me and makes me feel like I'm still a person, even if my molt removed my ability to talk back.

This was great, not only could I continue to communicate with you guys, but I am in less fear of breaking it due to purely how sturdy this thing is.

...Like, zoo wee mama, It's like a stone slab!

And thanks to the new universal charging ports my country uses, I can use my old charger for this one, So things have been pretty good for the past few days.

Anyways, something changed today, I was taken to a new cell, Buddy was nowhere to be found.

Over 10 guards escorted me, I looked like I was in a dark ages dungeon, covered in chains, as I was dragged by leash into a communal cell.

It was a large cell, padded like my old one, but 10x bigger, with a group of completely turned hybrids populating it.

They were all insects, but nobody else was a predator, notably enough, unlike me.

According to the chattering of the guards, after they unchained me and quickly locked the industrial reinforced metal door, This was called the... "breeding cell".

Oh my.

My parents had given me that talk, and I knew what it was, but I had been alone for long enough, my libido was effectively dead.

It wasn't like I was ace, I just had no energy left to seek "It" out, and it's not like it would be the same, after all, I was an abomination now, Nobody would want to love me....

The queen bee specimen was hitting on me.

I shall not speak of what we had done or will do, as it is none of your concern or business, what I will say is that she respected my orders as an alpha male, and let me leave after a while.

I call myself an alpha because I was the largest male, hell, I was one of the only males in this room.

A cockroach-man clicked his mandibles at me, He wanted my tablet, my most prized object.

I don't know if this had something to do with the "Alpha male" thing I was high on since I hadn't been the strongest person in the room once in my entire life.

Or maybe it was because of my transformation, but I immediately launched into battle with the ant.

I bit his arm and tore into the flesh, breaking carapace, but he sprayed me with a noxious gas.

I coughed and spun, releasing him, but I refused to lose because of some hissing roach's fart cloud.

I charged him, and knocked the roach to the floor.

Without mercy, I clawed and tore at the filthy man's flesh, even biting at his exposed flesh a few times.

As I pummeled the creature mercilessly, I expected my new mate to be angered or scared by my presentation.

But instead, she only seemed impressed, maybe even enamored by my horomone-fueld display of aggression.

this was turning into something out of hunger games.... If I ever read the whole book in the first place.

After a while, I sighed and pulled myself off of the mangled bug.

"Don't worry, Sweets."

Stella said, She had told me her name during one of her advances.

"He'll get up in a bit, cockroaches don't die easily."

I slowly turned around and saw that the man was already twitching back to life, even though I swore I had disemboweled him.

"...Not like they would care even if he did die, as long as it isn't a pregnant female, they don't do anything if we die, they just throw the corpse in a grinder and feed them to us."

And if you are wondering why she was talking, she wasn't, I'm just translating it for you, because most creatures don't understand my kin's language.

...And right now, I'm sounding like something out of warrior cats, I know, I suck with social skills, I lived by myself with nobody but a middle aged caretaker my parents hired for more than 4 years.

Regardless, my desire to escape has not evaporated at all now that I have a romantic partner and a better cell.

In fact, now that I have someone who relies on me, my yearning for freedom only grows.

I am strong enough to bend metal, But they have guns, and they have the power to destroy my life even more, even if not ruin it if I fail.

And no matter how many times I take my anger out on some weak fellow insect, I can't chase away the feeling that I'll never live happily and peacefully again.

The feeling that, by signing that stupid fucking contract, I also signed away my right to live free.

Even now that I am a big, strong, fast bug-monster, with intellegence and saipence surpassing my peers, I still panic when the guards shout, I still listen carefully for their footsteps, and only relax when they are gone.

I'm not like the other horror monsters, I'm not fearless, In fact, I have every right to feel fear right now.

So, what should I do? A big storm is forcasted for the next week, and they will need to resort to diesel generators in order to keep basic utilities on, what should I do?
