Living on a secluded farm had always made me feel safe. But one night, my sense of security was shattered. My wife and I had decided to install motion sensor porch lights to add an extra layer of protection during late nights. It was a smart decision, or so we thought.

One fateful night, we went to bed later than usual, around 12:21 AM. Our bedroom was situated above the porch, with a large window facing the front yard. As I began to doze off, the motion sensor light suddenly went off. I didn't think much of it and went back to sleep.

Hours passed, and I woke up at 4:43 AM. I noticed that the porch light was still on. At first, I wasn't too concerned, as the sensor was highly sensitive and could be triggered by something as tiny as a fly. But something felt off this time. My wife was also awake and whispered to me, "It's been on for three hours." My heart raced as I felt a sense of extreme dread fill me.

I slowly made my way to the window and peered out. I saw a figure standing outside, facing away from the house. How could someone be here? We lived far from any civilization. The figure was too still to be human, and as I focused my gaze, I noticed something that sent shivers down my spine - the figure had no face.

I was paralyzed with fear, unable to take my eyes off the faceless figure. I couldn’t move, It was facing the other way, yet I felt its eye peering into me, It felt like an eternity before my wife told me to call 911. As I turned to do so, the motion sensor turned off.

I didn't know whether to panic or feel relieved, but the faceless figure was gone. It was only then that I realized I had left the front door unlocked. I was paralyzed once again, I tried to move but I couldn’t, my children slept in the room across ours. The thought of an intruder wandering through my home, especially one with no face, filled me with a sense of dread I had never experienced before.

Days passed, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something was still watching me. I became increasingly paranoid, unable to leave the house or sleep without the lights on. I scoured the internet for any information that could help me understand what had happened that night. And that's when I found it - a local legend about a faceless man who would haunt anyone who dared to enter his territory.

I couldn't believe it - had I unknowingly trespassed on his land? Had I brought this upon myself? I knew I had to act fast, but it was already too late. The faceless man had already claimed me as his next victim, and there was nothing I could do to stop him. I was trapped, alone with my thoughts, and the faceless man waiting just outside my door.
