You’ve never experienced loneliness until you’ve been to the middle of nowhere. How do you get to the middle of nowhere? It’s surprising, but even here in America, where there is a Walgreens on every corner and a new building being built willy-nilly, there are places where humans travel the least, where the land is truly isolated and where nature grows unbound and free. These areas can be the many deserts of the west, the forests up north, the swamps down south, and the many mountain ranges that cut through the nation like a blade. There’s one more plot of middle-of-nowhere, America that many of you have passed through while on your journeys that you don’t pay much mind to—farmlands.   
Either north or south, east or west, you can find these massive plots of lands along the highways, these amber waves of grain. Some are grain, others corn, some full of livestock that stink up the highways forcing you to shield your nose from the stench. The farmlands stretch for miles upon miles, and when one property ends the next begins, stretching to another property and so on. You can see it all from the highways you drive on because most of the time the land is flat, the only figures on these flatlands are the produce they grow, the massive irrigation sprinklers on wheels, and, in some cases, a farmhouse and barn.   
That’s where you would find me.   
Nebraska is nothing but flat farmlands for the most part if you’re heading out east. I found myself on one of these farms at the request of my folks. They had called me to watch over their house and their farm for a couple of days as they went southbound to visit my grandparents. I had grown up in that house, worked that farm, stared at the expanse of nothingness, at nowhere, and left it all behind gladly when I was old enough to drive and sustain myself, moving to the city. I was hesitant to answer their call, but they were my parents after all—I have a sweet spot for them even though they were tough on me growing up. Reluctantly, I told them I’d watch their house and from my comfy Texas living I drove back home to middle-of-nowhere, Nebraska.   
The weather was phenomenal as I drove all the way down through Oklahoma, through Kansas, and taking a few highways through finally into Nebraska. There was not so much as a puff of a cloud in the sky, and the temperature, after I got out of muggy Texas, was a cool 70—my type of weather. As the land flattened around me and the sky stretched as far as my eyes allowed, with no clouds in sight or even the hint of a whiff of moisture, I still listened to the weather reports on the radio and checked my phone on the weather status whenever I stopped. It was routine for me as the weather had always been a concern for us farmers. The weather was a cruel mistress if she wanted to be, bringing you fortune with a healthy dose of rain or ruin with floods that washed away the crops; droughts posed serious threats as it dried the water from even our wells; lightning could get picky and strike our field and cause a fire—a fear observed only by my mother. I had come to respect the weather no matter where I was, city or flat farmland.   
There would be a storm coming through the homestead, the reports saying everything from a sprinkle to an average normal rainstorm. Since I hardly ever trusted the news anymore, I went with my gut and prepared for the worst. My car would suffer some hail I anticipated. I would have to prepare the house for the storm just in case.   
I reached my parents’ home in a couple of days, and my mother doted on me once she saw the lack of sleep on my expression, bless her heart. After a hug, she scolded me for skipping sleep along the road, even smacking me on the arm—if only she knew the many sleepless nights I’ve had and how disheveled I looked then. My father came to see me, and he shook my hand—we were formal that way, not really knowing how to show compassionate emotion for each other. We were men; we don’t share emotions.   
They welcomed me inside and I felt like I had never left. My feet went into autopilot as soon as I crossed the threshold, guiding me into the familiar smells, the sights, the sensation of being home. Everything was right where it had been when I left with not so much as a shift in position. I felt as if I could walk this house blindfolded; I came close when a blackout occurred at night, and I only had my hands to guide me to the candles in the living room.    
I sat in the living room, in a very familiar chair, and chatted with my parents for a while. My father sat in his dusty old recliner that probably was older than him—his throne, and my mother sat in an old rocking chair, flower designs on the cushions. We talked about how things have been, what was growing on the farm, what the new thing in politics was—my dad was a staunch Republican, which always made me uncomfortable, but to each their own, right? Then the topic shifted to the lack of communication between us.   
“Seems like you just forgot about us,” my father said, deadpan in his delivery.   
“I’m trying to make it on my own, Dad,” I replied. “I can’t do that while I’m out here.”  
“What’s wrong with ‘out here’?” he sneered.   
“There’s nothing out here.”  
“There’s us,” my father said. “There’s your mother, this house, this land that has been in our family for generations, that we fought and won against the government for. That’s something.”  
“Dad, I don’t want to fight,” I said, rubbing the bridge between my eyes. That was the other reason I dreaded coming down. My father, for his lack of emotion, got emotional when it came to the farm. “I just want to settle in and get some sleep.”  
That was the last conversation we had as my father rose from his throne and headed upstairs to retrieve their luggage. At my mother’s request, I followed him and helped him with three suitcases. The things were heavy, so much so that it would’ve hurt my father’s back. We took the suitcases to their Ford truck, dropped them in the backseat, and that was that. I exchanged farewells with my parents, hugging them, and wishing them a safe journey. Our almost fight was still there in the air, and it remained as I watched them drive off, the truck slowly becoming nothing more than a red speck on the canvas of golden fields.   
Long after they had driven off, I remained there on the porch just staring at the empty nothing of nowhere. My mind became foggy with thoughts, and I sighed. I stood behind what I said, and I felt justified when I said that there was nothing here. How could I have a fulfilling life out here in nowhere? How am I supposed to meet likeminded people and get lost in discussions with them? How am I supposed to meet a girl? Nothing like that can be achieved here in nowhere.   
But my dad done it, hadn’t he? He achieved all of it. Yes, he was in the middle of nowhere, but he was fulfilled. He knew other farmers, and he helped them and received help in return. He found my mom, and the two, even after 40 years of marriage, were still madly in love with each other. He had done all of that.   
What have I achieved in my time away?  
I live in a shabby apartment with two unemployed stoners. I have debts that I will never pay off in my lifetime or even in my afterlife. The few dates I’ve been on with women have ended horribly. I’ve grown to dislike people and their constant mood swings between rude and idiotically rude. I hate my job. All my hobbies seem like chores.   
As I pondered my life choices, I wondered if maybe I had made a mistake in leaving. This thought permeated my mind as I returned to the house and settled into the living room. I had sunk into my chair and let out a sigh, exhausted from the drive and my thoughts. I left for greener pastures only to be met with a grey wasteland of mediocrity.  
I wondered what it could have been if I had stayed with my folks on the farm. I know how to work the field, drive a tracker, and operate the irrigation systems. I would have work—hard work but work nonetheless, and my dad would be the boss, not that that would mean anything considering he would be harder on me than any boss. There would be a drive to meet people, but it would be a community of farmers, closeknit and helpful. Mom was a churchgoing lady, and maybe she could’ve introduced me to a nice church girl. These possibilities filled my head as my eyes slowly shut and I succumbed to sleep.   
My folks would be gone for some time, so I made myself at home, returning to the mold of my younger years. I found myself doing the things I was tasked to do when I was little, minding the yard, digging up weeds, watering the plants and trees and such, then household chores that my mother couldn’t get to, whatever the chore was. As if by instinct, I looked over the house the same way I did in my teenage years, following my father’s instructions about loose nails and peeling paint; there was no need for any of it at the moment since he kept up with the house. Then I walked down to the barn, red and vibrant as the day it was built, and when I left, I slid open the large door, and went to maintain the farming equipment. Again, my father kept up with the tractors, the plows, the tools meticulously, each part shining as if he bought it and installed it that day. How he managed to find the energy to maintain and sustain this equipment, the house, and the large land currently growing rows of corn was beyond me.   
I really was just babysitting their house while they were away. After a couple of days with nothing to do but watch their TV and listen to some old radio shows, a guilty pleasure of mine. I got by watching further by mindlessly watching YouTube on my phone or listening to some self-help podcast, but that only took so much time in the day. I was bored.   
On the third day, I decided to revisit some old areas of the house I had deliberately avoided. My room was upstairs, at the end of the hallway. Climbing up those steps proved to be onerous, each step turning my legs to jelly. When I reached the top, the hallway stretched unfathomably before me, twisting and turning in my vision. I had not been in that room since I left, and I left everything behind; all I took with me when I departed from this place was the clothes on my back and the car I drove away in. I imagined an empty room, all my stuff rotting away in some landfill, the casualties of my father’s rage or grief or whatever. However, as I turned the knob and entered, bracing myself, I discovered that my room had not been touched. Much like everything in the house, not a thing had moved, not even a dust particle.   
My bed with the same sheets on it—my mother still washed them. It smelled of fresh detergent. The stack of sports magazines was still piled in the corner, but it looked bigger; I went to it and found that the top one was a current issue. My mother still paid for the subscription—God bless her. The trophies—participation awards more like it—on my bookshelves were free of dust and the fake gold coloring shined as the sun hit them. It was like I never left, and my body felt a sensation of serenity within there.  
As I sat at the end of my bed, looking over everything, lost in a nostalgia trip, I found one last addition that wasn’t made by my hand. On the wall in front of me there was my high school diploma, framed and in full display. I was never homeschooled. Both my folks wanted me to get an education, and they drove hours to the nearest district for my education, and I graduated with impressive numbers. I never did thank them for that.   
The nostalgia wore off as I thought more and more about my parents and all that they did for me. Sure, they were strict, my dad was a hard-ass, but I don’t hold it against them considering I used all that to propel myself into society to the best of my ability. I’m an average human being, and that’s all because of them. And how did I repay them for it? I left, that’s what. I thought I could make it big and become a city boy, making those big bucks, wearing the fancy suits, getting all the women I want.   
The truth couldn’t be more different.   
I was homesick.   
I left my room, closing the door gently behind me, walked down the hallway and down the stairs back into the living room. The family portrait stared down at me, our happy faces reminding me of what I left behind. I remember that day, remember how it was tradition every year to take a picture of the family. The current one above the fireplace was the last year I lived in this house. It couldn’t be a family portrait without all of us there. When my parents get back, I could spare a couple more days from work to make it up to my mom and update the family portrait.   
I looked out the window and I saw that the sun was beginning to dip, bathing the sky in an orangish red haze. There were clouds forming on the horizon as well. They were also red in color from the setting sun. This was probably the storm the weather reports were warning about, and it could arrive by tomorrow, I think.   
“It’s a problem for tomorrow,” I said.   
If only I had known what the storm would bring…  
When I woke the next day, the storm clouds were beginning to come in. You would suspect the sky to be masked in either grey or, if you’re really unlucky, black clouds. This I thought as well, but I was met with something far more bizarre and, frankly, unsettling. The clouds remained the same hue of red from when I saw them yesterday evening. Puzzled, I went outside to investigate, staring up at the red above me, a million questions racing through my mind. I sniffed the air—rain has that specific smell we’re all familiar with. I smelled nothing but a faint whiff of copper, and something else…  
When I heard the first few drops of rain coming down and hitting the wood of the porch, I hurried back inside. Call it intuition or gut feeling, but I knew I needed to stay inside for this particular storm.   
I saw the rain coming, heard it tap, tap, tapping on the roof and on the walls. Before I figured it would be just any other rainstorm, my eye caught something strange with the water droplets. The rain wasn’t that regular clear water as nature intended, providing the land with sustenance. It was something far more gruesome.   
The rain was red. Pure red. My mouth hung open dumbly as the rain came in hard, pounding the roof in endless pours. Puddles of red formed on the ground. I suspected the white paint of the house was as red as the clouds. The smell of copper became stronger now, stinging my nose hairs and making me wretch. Then the grizzly thought came to my mind as I remembered the many times that I would suck up the blood from a fresh wound on my body.   
This rain wasn’t just colored red. The rain was blood.   
I wanted to vomit at the thought. The sky was bleeding! How is that even possible!? My mind went to some dark places, and what does a man do when all reason in his world diminishes? I turned to the roof, looking past it, to the heavens, and I prayed that this wasn’t some end times revelation thing. I don’t remember anything about the sky bleeding, but then again, I don’t read the good book that much. Most of all, I prayed for it to end as quickly as it came.   
He answered with a loud thud.  
Something slammed on the roof of the house. I jumped at the sound, yelping like the scared little kid I had become. I heard the thing that slammed itself on the roof roll off and fall to the ground in gruesome splat! I was frozen in fear to investigate.   
Then came another slam. Then another. Then another.   
This was no hail, not in this storm of red. I cowered in the corner of the living room, far away from the windows. The objects assaulting the house increased, and I could only imagine what was falling out there.   
Something hit the chimney with such force I could feel it in the foundations of the house. The bricks that formed the stalk broke and tumbled down the roof. The coppery smell of the blood-rain wafted in through the broken chimney, invading what I thought was a safe place. My misfortune continued as the somethings that pounded at the roof and the area around me came down the chimney like fricking Santa Claus! It looked like his bag at first, but my curiosity forced me to look at it closer, seeing the object was more flesh than fabric. Pink, covered in blue veins, hairless, the thing had four legs, a tail, and a snout.   
Oh fuck! It was a dog!  
As soon as I discovered this, the hairless dog that fell from the sky and crashed through the chimney twitched then finally moved, its body twitching with erratic animation. Pained screeching and gurgled barking came from its lipless snout. It had no eyes, just empty sockets; it thrashed and crashed into everything in the living room, destroying all in its path, and I screamed as I avoided it. After a minute or two of the dog thrashing about, it dropped to the floor, twitching, crying its last cry before it went still. I watched in horror as its body then broke down, dissolving as if acid had been poured onto it. First the flesh melted away, then the bones, then the organs, all of it forming a red puddle on the floor.   
Dumbfounded and stunned, I just stared at the puddle for what felt like forever. I let out a scream so loud that it echoed through the house. I had to know if there was more. I went to the window and looked at a field of carnage that had once been my family’s farmland. The land was covered in a layer of pink, hairless, writhing figures all gnashing and crashing about. Some were dogs, some looked like cats; it was literally raining cats and dogs. I would’ve laughed if it wasn’t so gruesome. They all mimicked the dog that died in my living room; they spazzed around for a while before falling to the ground and melting away, adding their blood to the rain flooding on the ground.   
All I could do was watch the scene unfold, unable to avert my eyes. We are a grizzly race, human beings. We are drawn to the macabre, to the deathly, to danger, no matter the situation. I knew what I was watching was wrong, a crime against the natural order, but I couldn’t look away. I was terrified of the hairless, sightless animals falling from the sky, crying in pain, stumbling on their broken legs and bodies, then dying, and I didn’t even blink at the sight.   
My stomach churned finally, and I finally looked away and released the contents of my stomach. It splattered on the ground, staining my mother’s favorite carpet. Even now I thought about how angry she would be to see her living room in such disarray. There were more pressing issues at the moment, however.   
A crash came from the kitchen, glass shattering. A groan came, and a deathly chill ran up my spine. That was no animal cry. It sounded human. Several crashing sounds came soon after, the dropping of pots and pans, silverware falling to the floor in havoc fashion, and plates and dishes breaking. All the while those pained and wailing groans grew in intensity. Reluctantly, fear shaking my very core, I inched my way to the kitchen, dreading what I would find. The thing, however, found me as it came charging out of the kitchen.   
I screamed at the sight of what looked like a man that had his skin peeled off, much like the dogs and cats outside. His muscles were exposed, his nerves clung desperately to the meat, and bits of glass were imbedded in his body, blood pouring out like waterfalls from the cuts. He had no eyes as well, and he moved like a man in the thralls of a bad drug high. He thrashed his arms, reaching, punching, grabbing for anything.   
The skinned man heard my scream and matched it with intensity, his mouth a gaping hole of agony. He lunged at me, and his hands found their place at my neck. The grip was so strong and tight that I immediately gasping for air, and I struggled against it, trying desperately to peel away the bloody wet fingers. Air was quickly depleting from my lungs, and they burned with every gasp. My vision, filled with the nightmare image of the skinned man, was beginning to blur. He was killing me.   
I didn’t want to die on my parents’ floor. I didn’t want my body to be left to the whims of this nightmare.   
With a determination to live, I fought back. I threw my body against the bloody thing, and we both rolled around on the ground until I broke free from its choking grip. I took a lungful of air greedily. However, I had no time to recover as the thing, screaming and wailing and scrambling, grabbed me again and threw me to the ground, crawling on top of me. It screamed bloody murder as it flailed his arms around me, landing a few punched on the side of my head, pain erupting in the form of stars in my vision. Death would be certain yet again if I did nothing.   
An angry roar came out of my mouth as I punched back. My fists struck the slippery surface of exposed muscle. It screamed in pain with every punch—it must’ve been in so much pain to begin with, having no skin and falling from the sky. I finally managed to push the screaming creature off and I quickly stumbled to my feet just in time to witness the man’s  body in the dissolving phase of its…life cycle…? Ungodly screams echoed throughout the house as his body was nothing more than a bloody puddle on the floor.   
That death cry would haunt me for the rest of my life.   
As our struggle concluded, I heard more painful wailing coming from all around the house, screams that mixed with the shouts and snarls from the skinned dogs and cats. I saw from the window more skinned men falling from the sky, descending like bastardized angels. Their bodies were broken from their falls, limbs dislocated in odd angles, and their spines bent beyond repair. They wandered blindly, painfully across the red landscape, lashing and attacking all in their way; the dogs and cats attacked back, biting, scratching, clawing, and all the skinless beings became one on the ground, muddied by the blood rain.   
I heard their hands tapping and hitting the side of the house. It was then that one came in front of the window and stared its empty gaze at me, staring almost into my frightened soul. It knew something was beyond the glass—me—and screamed, and I returned the scream. It punched right through the window, its hand shredded by the glass, and began to climb through, never minding the shards of glass cutting into its chest and abdomen.   
I retreated from the skinned man in a mad panic, backing away unknowingly to the kitchen. As soon as I crossed the archway to the kitchen, I was met with another skinless atrocity, and another, and more until the kitchen was swarming with them. They all screamed and tumbled over each other in search of anything to alleviate their pain.   
Before they could attack me, I dashed through the orgy of slimy, bloody bodies to the door that led to the basement. Once I cleared the path, I shut the door hard, and all the skinless men with their gaping voids for mouths came and tried to barge through the door. I locked the door just in time before I tripped down the steps, my body rag dolling all the way down, my head hitting the cement floor. Stars erupted in my vision, and I was stunned for a minute. It was the rapid tap and fists hitting at the door that brought me back. The basement was baren with only a few storage boxes containing holiday decorations and old clothing. I took the boxes and pushed them to a darkened corner, creating a fort where I hid behind thinking that those Christmas wreaths and mom’s old bras would shield me from the creatures desperately trying to beat the door down.   
For the most part, I had found safety in my corner; the basement door held against the skinless men’s attacks; their shortened life expectancy was probably to thank for that. I knew they expired not only because their hitting and scratching ceased by the minute but by the blood dripping from underneath the door and spilling down the steps like a continuous waterfall. There was so much of it, and the smell saturated the musky aura of the basement until it was all I could breathe in; it was so strong that it churned my stomach, and I puked my guts out again on the floor.   
There was no escape. I couldn’t even escape from reality to a make-believe world where I was far away from here. The noise from above—the screams of these damned souls—penetrated the thick cement walls and found home within my ears. It was a chorus of agony so painful that even Hell would beg for mercy. Their cries broke me, and I started to weep. I crouched and held my knees to my chest, crying with such force that by the end I was struggling to breathe.   
The chaos lasted for four more hours. When it ended—the crying, the fighting—I left the safety of my box fort and cautiously climbed the stairs, my shoes staining beneath the blood that painted the stairs. I unlocked the door and peeked through the crack. When I saw no skinned man or animal, I pushed the door open, and the sight broke me.   
My parents’ house, the house I grew up in, was destroyed. It was beyond repair. The walls had holes and scratches in them; objects that my parents treasured were lost; and blood coated every crack. I made my way from the kitchen to the living room, my heart breaking knowing that I had been away for so long and now I would never see it again. In the pool of blood, I saw the family portrait. It was stained red and dripped and nearly tore itself in half, but despite all that our faces were still visible if just barely. I dropped it back into the pool—there was no saving it.   
The outside was worse even though the sky was as blue and beautiful as any other summer day. Rainfall—normal rainfall—could destroy the landscape, that was certain. Crops could get washed away along with the roads, creating potholes that could last throughout the year. Now apply what I just said but with blood rain—the differences were stark. The yard surrounding the house was flooded with bloody puddles and the muddy remains of the fighting between the men and animals. The house was red from roof to foundation. The only thing that seemed untouched was the barn, which was red to begin with.   
I was in a state of shock and delirium and my mind refused to take in the sight before me. Our minds have a way of protecting us from the cruelness of reality, creating narratives that acted similar to what happened but different in every way; my mind provided me with some respite with it turning itself off completely. I shuffled slowly to the steps, and I sat down on them, my ass cold from the blood but I didn’t care. I became a zombie complete with a thousand-yard stare. I sat there in silent shock for hours.   
I didn’t come to until a parade of cars came rolling up the driveway. They were military vehicles, trucks and jeeps, and some were black SUVs. I suspected government, and I was proven correct when men—their skin still attached thankfully—from the SUVs dressed in black suits emerged and came for me, grabbing me by the arms and forcing me into the cars. As they manhandled me into their backseat, I saw the military men emerging from their vehicles, all dressed in hazmat suits.   
The next few hours were a blur. I was driven to some base—military no doubt. I was escorted to a room where two government agents sat me down and told me what happened. My shock hadn’t worn off yet, so most of what they told me I didn’t process. What I did hear was that what I saw didn’t happen at all; there was a chemical in the clouds that made the rain red, and the damage done to the house was excessive hailing. How I wish that was the truth. Regardless of what I knew to be true, I didn’t fight them; I wouldn’t go to anyone with the story of men falling from the sky and clouds that bled—who would believe me anyways? They were satisfied with my cooperation and were quite accommodating in helping me sweep all this under the rug.   
As expected, I didn’t return to the house. I was sent back to Texas, and I didn’t look back. I didn’t even bother telling my parents what happened.   
As far as I’m aware, when my parents entered Nebraska, they were approached by the government and offered to buy the land from them. My father refused their offer, giving them the same talking points he would give any potential buyer. In the end, however, the land was sold because the next thing I knew my parents were moving to Florida—that check better be retiring money. I could only imagine what the government was doing on my family’s property now. I still feel bad for them because I knew they wouldn’t have gone to the house and retrieve any mementos or anything; they would have to make new memories in Florida, hard to do considering their age where all they had were memories.   
I’m a shit son for not keeping up with them.   
As for me, I am even now more isolated than ever. The red rain had broken me beyond repair much like my childhood home. I can’t keep a relationship; I have developed a stutter in voice; I can’t look at people, or their pets for that matter, without imagining them without their skin; and when there’s a chance of rain, I suffer a panic attack out in public and I become unbearably inconsolable. I have become just like the skinned men, lashing out and wailing in pain. The pills don’t help either.   
Since then, I have moved and now occupy the states where rain barely makes a drop. Las Vegas suits me perfectly—I blend in with all the crazies. Even though the desert atmosphere is dry, and the sun shines intensely above, I always look to the mountains, to the clouds that sometimes form beyond them, and I can’t tell if they’re white, black, grey, or red.
