TW: schizophrenia, mentions of self harm, pills, suicide & death. 
           
                   THIS STORY IS FAKE!! 
I was diagnosed with severe schizophrenia not to long ago. it has gotten worse since i was diagnosed with it, everything is making me go insane.

I went back to the doctors office to get a refill on the pills my doctor gave me to make my schizophrenia calm down a little, i do this at least once a month. it doesn’t make it go away but it dies down for a while so i can get through the whole day without ripping my hair out.

I made it to my doctors office but everything seemed different, i tried to ignore it though because i thought it was my schizophrenia getting the best of me. 

I walked inside the doctors office but everything and everyone seemed off, the normal assistants weren’t there, everything just seemed so quiet and gloomy, like i said i tried to ignore it and i checked in.

around 30-45 minutes later, the nurse comes out, i glanced at her and she looked off too, she looked like she had been working there for days without rest. she looked dirty, tired, and dead. she called my name and apologized for the wait, but in a low, quiet, and sad voice.

i followed her to the room and she checked me up, and told me that another doctor will come in just to do a checkup on me and to hopefully prescribe my pills. the nurse left and a doctor i have never seen before came in about 10-15 minutes later, he looked just about the same like the woman, dirty, sad, dead, and his eyes were a bloodshot red and his pupils were huge.

he asked me how i was doing and how i was feeling. i told him what i needed (the prescription) he told me he wasn’t able to provide me with the medicine anymore because it can be addictive. i asked him what i should do and he looked up at my with his huge red eyes and told me that theres nothing i can do about it and to leave. 

i was so confused. but i started arguing with him telling him to please just give me the medicine so i wont try to kill myself and he started attacking me. he grabbed me by my shirt and pulled me up against the wall. And at that moment i knew something was wrong with that doctor, (not because i was being chocked by him but because i looked at him and noticed he was decaying) YES. DECAYING. i was able to get out of his chokehold he had me in and i rushed home, got food,snacks, and water i locked myself in my basement and i haven’t came out since, its been a week and I’m running out of food. the voices and hallucinations have gotten worse. apparently, I’m being reported as missing. i’m scared and i don’t know what to do. i am writing this because i don’t know how much longer i have left but i will be sure to update you guys.





 update: i dont know how long its been but everything is gone, the voices, the dark figures i would see in the corners of the room, but.. with good news always comes bad news, i ended up running out of food and water, i see my veins through my skin, my eyes itch, i cant walk, speak, or even think straight for that matter. everything hurts, i hope they find me soon.
