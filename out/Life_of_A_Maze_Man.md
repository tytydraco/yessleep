“Skies oddly white today, ain’t it Jim?” That was the last thing one of my groupies that day said to me before he got cut in half. Couldn’t tell you what did it, ain’t nobody see nothing. There was no sound. No warning whatsoever. While his top half fell to the cold concrete ground pretty quickly, his legs remained upright. They stood resolute, spoutin’ blood everywhere like a broken faucet. The worst part about the whole thing is, my name ain’t even Jim. 

	

This… this is a regular occurrence. It’s like a marker, telling us that that spot is a dead end, gotta find another way around. It really ain’t shocking anymore. Got a list of last words. Could make a book outta em’. A book of last words, that only I ever got to hear, have to have heard. 

	

I guess it really ain’t the image that is what's shocking anymore. Everyday is a gorefest, dozens of lives lost in one day, in all sorts of strange and terrible ways. What's shocking is those last words. Last words wasted on me, a guy who doesn’t care for the guy next to me, or wasted on a guy just the same as me. I’m just a man doing my job, just like everyone else. Though, if it weren’t me, or some other chump, who would those last words go to? All of us ain’t got no family. Guess we got friends, in the sense coworkers are friends with one another. Nobody real close to give those last words to is what I’m tryna say here.

	

And it’s when we’ve lost a dozen, a dozen last words wasted, when we turn home. 



“Can’t afford to lose more today.” We get radioed, then whoever is carrying the red string marks that dead end by tying a blue painted rock to the tip, drops it right there, and then we just follow the red back home.



Sometimes though, we get lucky. You see, there aren’t *really* any dead ends in this maze. It's just a bunch of long parallel halls, with spaces in the walls every couple miles to connect the halls. Well I guess that is a maze, but not in the traditional sense, you know? When you hit a dead end, rather than there just being a wall there, it really just means that the rest of that hall is death. Meaning if you keep walking forward, the big man at base ain’t gonna have nobody to call home, ain’t gonna be nobody to respond to that call home.

  
Sometimes it really is just as simple as a clean cut. Sometimes something dark, something the eye can’t see, mauls you like a bear. Sometimes, people just disappear in the blink of an eye. One moment they’re there, next they ain’t. 



So anyway, when we’re lucky, that means we just get to walk in a straight line all day. Tiring as hell, the monotony of it, but less tiring than having one more last word to carry around in my back pocket. 



“Times up for today.” We get radioed, then the leader for the day ties a yellow rock to the end of the string, marking the day's stopping point, and we go home. Not really sure how they chose all the colors. But it doesn’t matter too much, as long as you know what means what. 



Sometimes, on the way back though, we do lose one more. Some idiot forgets he's gotta stay in the group, follow the red line, and walks down the wrong way. Walks down into a dead end. I guess that's another time we are lucky, I am lucky. Because when somebody strays away like that, whether it’s cause they are tired, or they just stupid, ain’t nobody got to, and I don’t got to hear any more last words that day. 



You see, most of the time when someone wanders off in the wrong direction on the way home, we kinda just leave it. Nobody really calls their name or tries to chase them down, we usually don’t even notice. We had a moment like that a few months back. It was this newbie who just got signed onto the job. But for this kid, I couldn’t just leave it. I woulda felt terrible if I did. 



He was eighteen, fresh outta highschool, tryna make some money to send to his baby mama back home. He was far from the brightest, as a matter of fact I think he had something wrong with him, to put it lightly. Nice kid. Kept talkin’ bout his kids first birthday coming up. Kept talkin’ bout how much he loved his baby mama. Sounded like baby mama didn’t care for him though, no matter how hard he tried.



I kind of felt that. Related to that kid a little. Sure I didn’t have no kid, but that unconditional love he felt, that battle to keep a romance fated to die alive. I had a love like that once, and it made me nostalgic, felt like I was seeing a younger me. Only difference was, while I mean heck I ain’t the brightest either, I sure as hell wasn’t a stupid as that kid. 



Either way, it was all endearing. His stupidity, his talks of romance and life, he kept talking ‘bout some “when I get home” stuff, as if we were deployed in Afghanistan. Heck, he even kept a little picture of his baby mama and his baby in his pocket. I think he really charmed not just me, but everyone else in our group at the time too.



So, when we made a turn, and then when he took one more, I sure as hell took notice. And everyone else did too.  A couple of the guys called out his name, me included, but he didn’t listen. As a matter of fact, he believed he was going the right way. 



“It’s this way guys!” He called back to us. 



You see this maze, as stated before, ain’t really a maze. There ain’t too many twists and turns to take. Your goal is always north, and the exit is always south. Impossible to mix up. If you turn at any point, you take the opposite turn once more to get back on track, back to going north or back to going south. And if that's too hard, you got the red line and a group of sixteen or so dudes to follow. Well, by the end of the day it's maybe down to ‘bout half that.



Everyone still calls it a maze, despite it being more *maze-adjacent* than a full on maze, so maybe that got his simple mind all mixed up. Overthinking things is the worst thing you can do in here. You get the idea in your head that it's supposed to be some grandiose maze, you’re gonna make things more complicated than they need to be.



So I chased him down, not sure how or why I got picked to be the one, but nobody really wanted this kid to die so there was no fuss about me havin’ to be the one. This dead end was pretty far back down this specific hall. Turnin’ round, I had lost sight of the group beneath the horizon. And worse, the sun was setting. 



Dude was cookin’ it, really took me a minute to get behind him. I kept trying to call out to him, to tell him he was going the wrong way, but he kept brushing me off. And eventually when I got really close, and when his stupidity was no longer endearing, I frustratedly began to try to explain to him what was going on. 



“Kid, this sure as fuck is going towards a dead end.” I told him. 



“No man, you guys got it wrong. We came back down through this hall earlier when mapping things, so we gotta go back up it to get back to the entrance!” He excitedly explained, as if he was some directional savant. 



I grabbed him by the collar and whipped him around to face me.



“There's only two ways to go here. North and south. Dead ends are always north, always. It's impossible to run into one going south, unless you ain’t following the red string, but just like how dead ends are always north, you are also always followin’ the red string!”



“But we are following the red string!” He told me and pointed to the ground. There was no red string. We were way into a dead end. 



“Oh fuck!” I turned and began to pull him, “we passed the blue marker!” 



But it was too late. There was a balloon-like pop behind me, and a flurry of guts and gore smacked me hard on the back. I turned around to see myself only holding a scrap of his baby blue office shirt. 



He had inflated in a split second, and exploded. Everything that was once that kid, was scattered across the cold concrete floor and walls. If I knew my anatomy well, I’m sure as hell I coulda identified every one of his bones and organs that was now scattered across the maze. Only ones that I wouldn’t be able to pick out, woulda been the ones I couldn’t see stuck to my back.



I guess I was wrong a little earlier. Occasionally, some deaths still shock me. I decided to keep his little polaroid of his wife and kid. I don’t know why. When we got back to base, I remember I stared at it for a good long while, while I picked the last of his guts out of my hair. 



He was an exception out of all of us. Someone who had something before coming here, had people to give some proper last words to. But I got his last words. His oh so confident last words. It was sad, but at least his baby mama was gonna get a pretty big payday there soon.



Back at base, life’s normal… almost. Big men upstairs done everything they can to keep things similar to life outside the zone. We got little mock up streets with bars and restaurants, little stores where we can go grocery shopping, and little parks where we can feed the birds. We got internet, all the connections we want to the outside world, the only thing is, we can't tell nobody about the inside world. Nothing can be said bout’ the maze, life on base, even the people we live day to day with. Maybe that's why we can’t grow close, because we can barely think of each other as friends, we ain’t allowed to. 



The worst part of it all is the monitoring. All the cameras, the ones you can’t see and the ones you can. Makes you feel like a fish in a fish bowl. At least the fish is too stupid to think about anything other than being a fish. It doesn’t care about being watched. It’ll take a shit in front of ya, no second thoughts. While I, I’m even worried they gotta have a camera attached to the bidet I sit on. Why the hell would they need to be looking at my butthole while I shit? Who knows, but when you’re being watched during every aspect of your life, even the dumbest thoughts come to mind. Anything could be a camera, anything could be listening.



A couple of nights ago I went out with a few of the guys from the last group I went on an expedition with. We went to the best bar in town, the only bar in town, a place called Lar’s Ladies and Lagers. It's like a western style booby bar. You got busty chicks dancing on the bars and tables, darts and pool in an adjacent room, it's a good time. Although, the chicks ain’t hot at all. They’re more like the crackheads you’d find selling their bodies on the streets, so they can buy more crack. Super skinny, faces basically melting off their skulls from all the drugs, and their important parts all fake, and not even nicely faked. It’s sad to look at when you're sober, guess that's why they are working in a place where nobody sober.



Anyway, we went there to do the usual business, get wasted, hit on some of the strippers, and hope to take one home for the night. Maybe play some pool or darts if the picking up chicks turned more into putting down chicks. Not like we were being mean to them, just tryna say we ain’t know how the hell to talk to girls. You ever get turned down by a girl you pay to love you? Shit hurts man.



That day was one of those days, no luck with the ladies. They were more focused on some new blood that had come in. Pretty handsome fellas I’ll say, I don’t blame 'em for chasing something like that. Chiseled faces, toned muscles, tall, very nice on the eyes. Probably had it good downstairs too.



We were playing pool when some guy at the next table started freaking out. He already looked all geeked out when he first came in; but once he had enough drinks in him, rather than calming down, he exploded.



“I FOUND HIM!” He started screaming. His buddies tried to calm him down but they just couldn’t. Dude fell to the ground in a fetal position and kept screaming it over and over again. The whole bar came to a stand still as we all watched it go down. It was normal for newbies to freak out after seeing someone die for the first time, but this guy was here years before most of us. As a matter of fact, I think every maze man on base at this point isn’t anyone who was here six or seven years ago, only him. He was the longest surviving maze man on base as far as we all knew. 



Eventually the suits came in, looking all serious, dressed in outfits you’d see agents in cliche spy movies wear. When these guys came around, we all knew we weren’t seeing that guy again. 



They grabbed this dude by the ankles and wrists and lifted him off the ground. It was humiliating even to look at. The rest of his group just got ushered out behind the two carrying the nutcase. Would we be seeing the rest of those guys again, too? Probably not. They all were going the same way that the other guy did, so it was likely they were going out like the other guy did too.



Things eventually got started again in the bar, people quickly forgot about the scene, the ladies got back to hittin’ on the new bloods, and we got back to playing pool. That was when Joshua, a short yet lanky little Mexican guy, snuck up to my ear. 



“Did you hear what they was talking about before?” He asked me.



“No I didn’t, do I wanna know?” I said.



“Apparently, that guy on the ground kept trying to tell his groupies that he had found out what we is looking for in the maze.” He looked around and then leaned in closer. “He says, we is looking for God, and he found him.”



“That’s some bullshit, Joshua!” I scoffed, “and you know that too!”



“My name is Jose.” He corrected me, “and of course I know that’s not true. But you know what that means for us? We gotta close off that entire hall now.”



On occasion, it would take a while for a dead end to kill you. Meaning, it wouldn’t be until the next day that we would know that that spot, that hall, was a dead end. Best case scenario it’d be same day, like what happened then. Worst case scenario, it’d be a week, then who knows how many maze men would be kicking the bucket. 



Dead ends like that create a hassle not only for us maze men, but the big men running the whole show too. It slows the whole thing down, because now we gotta find where the dead end starts. If we were to just keep working with a whole hallway cut out of the picture, it could possibly make the end goal impossible. 



So, which group of us is getting assigned to scan that hall? That's when everyone sits on the edge of their seat. Ain’t nobody wanna work on the mystery dead ends. You see, when someone gets cut in half: bam, right there is your dead end. When someone gets mauled: bam, right there is your dead end. When someone disappears, that one's a little harder, but still it’s fairly easy to place the dead end. The mind ones, it’s almost impossible to know, unless you are intentionally looking for the dead end.



That means more maze men gone, meaning those left may have higher chances of getting picked, meaning more work for us. And for the big men upstairs, it means resources wasted: people, time, string, cute little painted rocks. It’s a lose lose situation.



So we drank and played pool until the morning sun rose. Returned home, then sat and waited for our little assignment slips to come in. All of us anxiously hoping we ain’t assigned to go find that dead end. Normally it takes a moment to get the next slip, as the guys update the maze map digitally. So, it took about two or three days for it to come in. There are only two things you can get:



1. YOU ARE WORKING TODAY.



Or,



1. YOU ARE OFF TODAY.



And guess what the hell I got. I got the first option. Suppose I’ll write again when my work is all done, that is, if I don’t hit the dead end.
