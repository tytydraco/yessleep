Hello, first I am really sorry for my awful English.

Year: 2013
A little background. I am a female, I have 3 older siblings(male)(2female) and one younger brother, I have a mother and a father, that makes us a family of 7, safe to say that our financial situation was not the best so we had to move's House's a lot. Especially when I and my younger brother came into the picture, but we all got showered with love and support from my parent the same. my parent also made sure that we are all healthy and educated us to be rational thinkers when something unexplained or weird happpen, so
So when we moved to this house, it was not that big but not that small, the rant was kinda cheap, it was also close to a school building which made car ride cheaper, so it was just perfect... That if we're just talking about "keeping a roof above our heads", you see, the house was old, like really old to the point that some sinks doesn't work. The kitchen and one bathroom are the only location that the water can reach. (there was at least three bathrooms in the house) some rooms have wall molds, some doors were hard to open so you needed to push to get to a room, I think you get the picture. Now my parent hated the house but they had no choice, it was either this or my sickly grandparents "house"
So we moved in the house, I had to share my room with one of my older sister while my younger brother shared with our other older sister.
(my mom doesn't want me and my brother to play when it's time to sleep so she had to spread us, also if you are wondering why my little brother didn't get a room with my older brother, it's because... Boys fight a LOT if they are different ages lol).
Anyway we stayed in that house for 5 years before we decided to leave the house because... Will, let's begin.

Year: 2015
Month: may 23 day of the week: Tuesday 
my birthday was week ago, I just turned 13.
It was like any other day, school is kinda annoying but hey video games, we played till it was midnight, my mom came and told us it's time for bedtime. I brush my teeth and put my pajamas, my dad wish me and my older sister goodnight and leave.
Time pass, I close my eyes and go to Dreamland... But then I woke up to a sound of a door opening. I don't really give a thought of it, because when you live with a lot of siblings you get used to hear doors opening and footsteps in the middle of the night, because it's probably someone who has to go to the bathroom or need to drink water, so I didn't even bothered to open my eyes, and try to go back to my dream. Time pass again... now a few seconds pass and my mind is drifting away...

Then, I get pulled to the bottom of my bad.

I screamed and tried to hold the headboard, but it's to far, I try to struggle to get myself up but that "thing" isn't letting me go, I kicked my blanket off to see but I can't see anything in the dark room. I can only feel a cold grab around my left foot. I will never forget how cold and hopeless it felt, I thought that I was going to die scared and hopelessly trying to save myself from "something" I can't even see. Just then the door opened and with that comes a bit of light.
I also feel "it" let go of me.
I can hear my dad's voice, but I just felt drained and shocked that I didn't even look at him, and with a little light that hit some places in the room, The only thing that was in my view was the closet...

I saw the closet door, slowly closing by itself.

Now I wanted to scream or tell my dad to look at the closet, but this feeling of fatigued made me only cry,(apparently I have cried really quietly to my dad), when my dad got closer, I can see him talking to me, he asked why I'm not in the upper part of the bed and why I throw my blanket away. Then I heard my sister voice asking what happened to me she got up and put the light on, I can hear footsteps and then... I blacked out. The next thing I remember was waking up to my mom saying something to my dad and telling my other siblings to go back to sleep. I try to calmly catch their attention to tell them that I am fine now, but then I couldn't speak, I thought it was just because I was tired...
Then I noticed that I couldn't also breathe.
It felt like I forgot.

Luckily my older brother noticed me doing weird movements and when he looked at my face he became horrified, he told my dad to look at me, eventually my mom notice too and started to call the police while my dad tries to figure out way to make sure they don't lose me.(this what my mom said to me, I only remember what happened to me). I don't know what happened afterwards if the ambulance come or not, but I can tell you that the next morning I woken up and this time I felt (tired) but better. My mom was sleeping next to me and when she felt my movement she looked at me first worried but then said: oh thank god it's over"
My dad that day took me to the hospital to get me checked, and apparently I had developed sleep apnoea, I don't really know much, but oh boy was those days that I had it was the worst of my life, at least I didn't have to go to school but I still remember my dad and doctor telling me that I can't play too hard, or do anything like running around. I also remember even how I can't start the day or go to sleep without those small oxygen tank, or how many days I had to visit the doctor.
It was awful. Agonizing and tedious days of my life.

Month: August 9 day of the week: Wednesday 
my younger brother (who turned 13) also got the same disease (?) Like me. I remember when I woke up, my older sister screaming to my mom, thankfully my dad took my bro to the hospital, but this is that never happened to any of my family, it only happened to me and my younger brother.
I had to ask my brother if he remembers what happened when he came back, at first he didn't want to tell me but I said he can talk so he did...

My lil bro: I was drifting to sleep, but then I thought that I heard the door (opening), but the sound was so close to me, so I looked to my right side to the closet... (It) was there"
He continued by saying he blackouts after.

We only stayed for one year at that house.
I remember how in the last few days that we stayed, the house really needed to a lot of fixing, my dad tried to fix some however the owner didn't even left a finger. For some reason he told my dad to "give up" and "if you have problems, just move out".

I am just happy that we moved out because of that event I can't now sleep without one light on, and also I became so uneasy with closet being open.(my brother shares this too)
My condition become better and so is my brother.
Thanks for reading all of my experience,I didn't know that it's going to be this long, so sorry about that, just stay safe out there.
