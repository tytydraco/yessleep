I grew up a 90s kid. When I was in fourth grade, we packed up and moved to a new town because my step-dad started a job at the local prison. That’s where I first met Sarah. She was a year younger, but she'd skipped ahead, so we ended up in the same class. Sarah lived right next door, and it didn't take long before she’d invite me over, her small voice calling from the porch, asking if I wanted to come play with toys.

Sarah was a bit of a dork, I have to admit. With her glasses, braces, and nose constantly buried in a book, she fit the part. But she was warm, always ready with a smile, and more welcoming than anyone I’d met. She might have been a nerd, but she was my nerd. It didn’t take long for her to become my best friend. We walked to and from school side by side, and spent almost every spare moment together.

Years went by, and Sarah and I grew inseparable, two peas in a pod. Then came a day in eighth grade when I walked her home after school, like always. She asked if I wanted to come in, and I said yes. Her mother, Jane, met us at the door with a warm smile and a fresh batch of chocolate chip cookies. The smell filled the house, and the taste was perfect, sweet and comforting. Jane had a kind, gentle beauty, always beaming when she saw me. I thanked her and headed home after we finished the cookies. I didn’t know then that it would be the last time I’d see her alive.

The next morning, I went to Sarah's house and knocked on the door. No one answered. It felt strange, out of place. Worry nudged at me, so I made my way around to the back and found the spare key Sarah had once shown me, hidden in a fake rock by the flowerbed. I let myself in and stepped inside, calling out her name. That’s when I saw Jane, suspended in the middle of the room, a rope around her neck. I froze, eyes wide, breath caught in my chest. The sight was so raw, so unlike anything I’d ever known, and a scream escaped me. Moments later, Sarah came rushing in. The stoic look on her face told me she already knew. Soon, the house was filled with police, voices low and steady as they took Jane's body away.

After that day, Sarah changed almost overnight. The cheerful, book-loving girl I’d known vanished, replaced by someone entirely different. She swapped her bright, quirky clothes for dark, somber outfits; even her makeup turned dark, with black eyeliner tracing heavy lines around her eyes. It was as if a shadow had settled over her spirit. She grew quieter, more distant, and thinner, too—her chubby cheeks slimming down until her cheekbones stood out sharp and defined. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t notice. To my teenage mind, there was something striking, almost alluring, about this new version of Sarah, even if I couldn’t shake the feeling that the light in her had dimmed.

As a teenager, Sarah's arms bore the marks of her grief—thin, angry lines that she carved into her skin after her mom’s death. It became her way of coping, a way to quiet the pain she carried inside. I did everything I could to help her find another way, to keep her from hurting herself. I bought her rubber bands to wear on her wrists so she could snap them when the urge came. For a time, it seemed to help, a small barrier between her and the darkness she battled.

Freshman year of high school, Sarah and I started dating. It was her idea—she asked me out one afternoon. Part of me worried about what that might mean for our friendship, but after everything she'd been through, especially losing her mom, saying no just wasn’t an option. She assured me that we would be friends until the end. We took our time, moving at a pace so slow it felt like molasses. We shared moments and grew close, but intimacy came much later. It wasn’t until she turned 18 that we crossed that line, and that’s when life threw us another curve: Sarah found out she was pregnant.

We got an apartment together. I was excited when Sarah told me she was pregnant. Every day, I’d rest my hand on her growing belly and talk to our little one, imagining the future we’d have. But life had other plans. The first miscarriage hit us hard, but it didn’t end there. Over the next year and a half, we endured a heartbreaking string of five miscarriages. Each one chipped away at our hope, leaving cracks in places we didn't know could break. Desperate for answers, I went with her to the doctor to see if there was something wrong. But after all the tests and questions, the doctors reassured us: Sarah was healthy and perfectly capable of carrying a child.

I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off, a nagging sense that Sarah wasn’t telling me the whole story. I’m ashamed to admit it now, but the doubt got the best of me. I bought a small GPS tracking device and, one day while helping with groceries, I hid it in the trunk of her car. A few weeks later, her sixth “miscarriage” happened. But the tracker showed her car had been parked at a Planned Parenthood clinic. The truth hit like a punch to the chest: Sarah hadn’t been losing our babies to fate—she’d been choosing not to keep them all along.

A little more snooping, digging through old bills and receipts, and the truth became undeniable. Everything lined up—doctor’s visits, payments to clinics. The pieces of the puzzle clicked together, and I couldn’t escape the reality that Sarah had been getting abortions all along. Each miscarriage wasn’t what she’d told me it was. The weight of it all settled on me, heavy and suffocating.

I laid out the evidence on the table and waited for Sarah to get home from her job at the supermarket. When she walked in, I didn’t waste any time—I asked, "What is this?" Her face crumpled, and for the first time in all the years I’d known her, I saw her cry. She hadn’t cried when her mother passed, not during 9/11, or through any of the other moments that should’ve broken her. But now, she just broke down, tears pouring out without end. For over an hour, she cried, refusing to say anything, unable to answer any of my questions. I watched her fall apart, and for a moment, I felt guilty—like I had done something wrong by confronting her. She made me feel like the bad guy for just wanting the truth.

That night, Sarah left without saying a word, and didn’t come home until the next day. When she did, it was like a switch had flipped. Gone was the dark, emo look she’d been wearing for so long. Instead, she was dressed in bright, colorful clothes—her nerdy style fully returned. She was wearing glasses again, no longer bothered with her contact lenses, and there was no trace of black in her outfit. Her whole demeanor had shifted too; she was bubbly, cheerful, almost as if nothing had happened. I was in complete shock, unable to wrap my head around this sudden transformation. It felt like the girl I’d known was back—only she was different somehow, and I couldn’t figure out how.

She came over to me and wrapped her arms around me in a hug. Instinctively, I hugged her back, but then I felt a sharp pain in my gut. I gasped as I realized she had been concealing a knife, and now it was buried in my belly. She whispered in my ear, her voice unnervingly calm, "I saw the way you looked at my mother. She can't have you. You're mine, until the end. I made sure of that a long time ago."

The knife twisted, sending a wave of agony through me, but my mind was stuck in complete shock. She kept talking, her words cold and deliberate, "Did you really think I would let our little ones take your full attention away from me? You’re mine, until the end. And this is the end."

I shoved her away from me, and in the process, she stumbled backward and hit her head on the coffee table. Dizzy and light-headed from the blood pouring from my gut, I staggered to my feet, clutching my stomach, and stumbled out the door. My vision blurred, but I managed to get to my car and dial 911. The police arrived, but by the time they got there, Sarah was already gone, vanished without a trace.

They rushed me to the hospital, and somehow, I survived. That was the last time I ever saw her in person. I moved states, changed my name, tried to escape the memories of that night. But no matter where I go, I still get anonymous letters in the mail—on my birthday, on our anniversary. The words are always the same: "Friends until the end." Each one a haunting reminder that Sarah might not be done with me yet.
