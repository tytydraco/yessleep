I don’t really remember what the last thing I said to my son was.

That’s the part that keeps me up the most. I replay everything I do remember — every look, every phrase, every second of that morning — trying to figure out what the last words were. Maybe it was something stupid like “We’ll be here when you wake up.” Maybe it was just “Love you, buddy,” out of habit, without really feeling it. Or maybe I didn’t say anything at all.

God. I really don’t know.

He was seven. Appendectomy. The kind of thing that’s not supposed to go wrong. We’d caught it early. The surgeon said it was routine.

My wife cried all morning. I just sat there like an idiot — nodding at the nurse, shaking the surgeon’s hand, acting like someone who had their shit together.

I’d taken the day off work. I even brought my laptop. That’s the part that haunts me the most. That I thought I might get emails done while my son was under anesthesia.

It happened fast.

The nurse came into the waiting room, pale and quiet. She asked if we could step into the “consultation room.” And suddenly the air was gone. I remember how my wife’s nails dug into my hand. I didn’t flinch.

They said he didn’t wake up.

Flatline. Unexpected complication. A blood clot, they think.

Time of death: 4:31 PM.



I don’t remember walking back to the car. I remember seeing a vending machine and wondering if I should eat something, and immediately wanting to puke.

I remember my wife sobbing and saying, “It’s not real. It’s not real. It’s not real.”

I remember the receptionist giving me a look that I still don’t know how to describe — like she knew and couldn’t say anything.

And then, I remember my phone ringing.

It was 4:42 PM.

Unknown number. Hospital area code.

I answered, numb.

And I heard my son’s voice.

“Daddy?”

It was quiet. Frantic. Like he’d been crying.

“It’s cold. I can’t find anyone.”

It wasn’t a recording. It wasn’t some other kid. It was him. I know my son’s voice. I know the little tremble he gets when he’s scared.

“There’s no lights here. I don’t know where the nurse went.”



“They told me not to talk too long.”

“Who?” I asked.

“The people in the walls.”

Click.

The sound of a payphone receiver slamming down.

The line went dead.



That night, I didn’t answer the next call.

I was in the laundry room, folding his clothes. I’d washed them automatically — like muscle memory. His favorite Spider-Man shirt. That hoodie he wore to the hospital.

The phone rang in the other room. I didn’t move.

Just sat there, holding a sock the size of my hand.

Later, I found a voicemail.

No number. No transcript.

Just one message. One minute long.

It was him.

“I think I messed up. I don’t know if I’m supposed to be here.”



“It’s like… a hospital, but it isn’t. There’s a hallway that never ends.”



“There’s a man in the mirror. He only smiles when I cry.”



“You’re coming to get me, right?”

Every day after that, 4:42 PM. Same number. Same voice.

And every day, it got worse.

“Daddy, I saw me. Another me. He had my face. But he was smiling too much. He told me you’re not gonna come.”



“He says you didn’t even say goodbye.”



The next morning, I smashed the phone.

Then I sat at the table, listening to the silence, pretending it was over.

And then the house phone rang.

We haven’t had a landline in years.

Caller ID said:

E. MARSHALL - 4:42 PM

I answered.

“Daddy… I don’t know how to get back. There’s doors, but they go wrong.”



“I saw you today. But you didn’t see me.”



“The smiling one said you weren’t supposed to keep me. He said I was his.”

Click.



That night, I got a text.

Just a photo.

Blurry, dim, hospital flooring — cheap linoleum under bad fluorescent light.

A payphone stood in the center. Not mounted. Just… standing.

The receiver was off the hook.

A smiley face had been drawn in blood on the keypad.

Caption:

“Soon.”

Then another call came.

This time… from my number.

I answered.

The voice was Ethan’s. But wrong.

“I’m not myself anymore.”



“I don’t know where my hands are. Or my face.”



“But I still remember what your voice feels like.”



“It’s like warm light, under a door. I crawl toward it every time I hear it.



And I think if I get there… I won’t be alone anymore.”



I stayed up that night in Ethan’s room.

At 4:42 AM, the baby monitor clicked on.

No static. Just breathing.

Then:

“He’s not cold anymore.”



“He’s just empty.”



“Thank you for leaving him.”



A new voicemail came later. No number.

Just:

“Come say goodbye.”



I didn’t mean to go looking for him.

But after that last message, the house changed.

At 4:42 AM, I walked past the upstairs closet.

The door was open.

It used to be his hiding place.

After he died, we never touched it.

That night, the coats inside were swaying.

The heater was off.

The air was cold.

I stepped close.

The back of the closet was wrong.

It had pushed open.

Like something had peeled the drywall into a hallway.

It didn’t feel like a space.

It felt like a waiting room for something else.

From inside, I heard his voice.

Not Ethan. Not exactly.

Just… what’s left.

“I’m not me anymore.”



“But I remember what it felt like to be your son.”

I stood there a long time.

Then I said:

“I love you Ethan… Goodbye.”

And for the first time, I meant it.



The coats stopped moving.

I shut the door.

Gently.

Like tucking him in.

It’s been three days.

No calls. No monitor.

Just silence.

But last night, when I passed Ethan’s room, the door was cracked open.

Just a few inches.



I think I said goodbye.

But I don’t think it did.
