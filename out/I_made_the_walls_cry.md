Every day, for five years I've been thinking about the events that happend on 13th of April 2018. I was 15 around that time. 

I was raised in a family that always had stories to tell when I didn't behave and had very strict rules. They were trying to scare me in order to make me listen to them. 

At that time was teenage time to me, so I heard a lot of stories, but not any as the last one. 

I remember I had snuck out to attend a party. Parties weren't really my thing, but friends can be very persuasive. 

When my parents found out, they told me what happened to be the last story I got to hear from them: 

"The walls are crying, this house we live in its just like us, it has feelings. Now trust us, you don't want to make the house angry. 

When you leave this house, you have to do it properly. Sneeking out its just like leaving without saying good bye, its rude. 

Your grandma has made the house angry once and now, look at her, she is a plant sitting in that armchair. 

When you make it angry it consumes you, it doesn't kill you, that would be to good for you comparable with what's actually happening. 

By consuming you, it takes all your good memories and replaces them with fearfull momemts witch you live over and iver again. 

So, don't ever again disrespect the house. It may already be late." 

This was told me 4 days before disaster struck. Of cource I didn't belive anything. Who would? 

In those 4 days my parents were very panicked and got mad at me for the smallest mistakes. Now I find their actiones justifiable. 

Then finally, the time came. The clock hit midnight. The courtains were violently moving, like a powerfull wind was coming in. The lights were turning on and off and dust was rising in the air. All while storm noises were beeing heard. Water was dripping of the walls, they were crying. 

I woke up because of the noise, my parents were horrified. The terror could be seen in their eyes as they were just sitting still. 

Everything seemed to be moving so fast bat at the same time not moving at all. I could fell my head starting to hurt while I was hearing a constant whistle in my ears. 

I went for the door, it was opening, but imediatly closed making a loud sound. I tryed braking the windows, my arms felt soft, I didn't have any strenght in them. 

Soon I noticed that objects had starded disappearing and me and my parents had lost weight, becoming more and more skinny. 

The house was a stomach. That was eating everything inside it. No, it was a whole organism, the walls crying, having feelings and now the consuming. 

I starded shouting "Stop it!" and "I'm sorry for leaving without good bye.". 

Nothing was working and I realised I was going to be eaten alive by the place that kept me and my family safe. It was ironic. 

I just went on the coutch and sat there with tears in my eyes thinking of every good moment I had had. When suddenly... 

It was all gone. Can't remember those memories I had lost to this day. Fortunetly not all of them were lost. 

I always have been afraid of dark. So here was I, an empty dark place. 

I started hearing wispers. I don't think you are scared of the dark itself, but actually of not beeing alone in the dark. The wispers were unclear, I couldn't understand anything they said. 

The time spent in there felt like eternity. It felt like death, cold air sorrounding me. That was hell, eternity spent in darkness, you and your voices in your head, but bad voices in your head. 

Until, "Just flick the switch.", I told myself. 

I opend my eyes. I was on tge floor of the house. Everything inside was gone, even my mom and dad. Everything had been eaten, I was all that was left. Good bye, I said this time.
