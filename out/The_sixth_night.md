So, I’m not going to sugarcoat this, if I’m writing this message, it’s because I know that a lot of you like paranormal stuff and, you would be more informed about occult and everything related to that. I’ve always been a Cartesian, with my head on my shoulders. I’ve never believed in paranormal, and for every strange situation, I’ve always had an explanation. But not this time. If I’m asking you, people from this community, it’s because I need your help, and I don’t know who I should talk to about it.

I’m working at a police station and I’m in charge of an investigation. It’s confidential, so I can’t give you my identity or any other details, so, let’s say my name is Martin. The case is about a dad who killed his wife and three years old son to kill himself afterwards.

In those cases, there is nothing much we can do, we search through the house and examinate everything and try to find a reason to this. So, that’s what we did and we found something, the Holy Grail, something that would help us to pursue the investigation, a journal. I had a lot of hope when I started reading it, but I must admit now, I’m scared about what I found, I don’t really know what to do, and that’s why I need you. You’ll find, below, extracts of the journal that I’m allowed to share and linked to the case.

I’m not used to writing this early in this journal, but I woke up in distress, I don’t know why. I always sleep well, my wife can witness it. But tonight, I can’t go back to sleep, something is wrong, I can feel it.

**Saturday, August 12th, 2023 - 9 : 45 AM**

Marie just called me, it’s awful. She said that Freddy killed himself last night. I don’t understand, he’s my twin brother, we have been seeing each other every day for thirty years now. It’s out of character, it’s not possible. Marie was devastated during the call. We’ll need to stick for each other in order to survive that…

She also told me that my brother left me a strange package before killing himself, that’s odd. I really don’t understand, I don’t have time for this, I need to get ready, Annie and Charly are waiting for me.

**Saturday, August 12th, 2023 - 10 : 30 PM**

What a never ending day, I’m exhausted. We came back home like an hour ago. We spent the day comforting Marie and organizing everything for my brother’s funeral. Some police officers interrogated us, but honestly, we didn’t know what to say, we had no idea why he’d done that. We are concerned, the funeral will take place on Wednesday, it’s going to be a hard moment for us, but we’ll help each other, as a family.

Before leaving, Marie talked about the package again. I completely forgot about that. She led me to the attic, and she gave me a painting hidden under white sheets, and a letter. I wanted to look under the sheets, but Marie stopped me. Apparently, Freddy makes her swear to never look under it. This day was growing more peculiar.

The first thing I did when I came home, was to look at the painting. It represents a very strange creature, half-human, half-goat. It was sitting on a chair, it has hairy paws and hoofs, the chest and arms were human, same for the face, except for the fact that there were two horns on top of it. The strangest thing is that the creature had closed eyes.

I’m running out of energy to think for tonight, I’m exhausted, I’m going to bed.

**Sunday, August 13th, 2023 - 5 : 15 PM**

I haven’t slept that much last night, I had a lot of nightmares. This morning, when I woke up, all my thoughts were about my brother, I got really sad. I sneaked out the bedroom to not awake Annie and I met Charly who was already eating breakfast. I sat and ate with him in silence.

When I went to the loo, I passed by my office and saw my brother’s painting. I had forgotten about it, to be honest. With everything that happened last night, I wasn’t thinking about it. So, I went to my office and noticed that something was wrong. The painting was different. Today, the creature's eyes were open. This look seemed to be familiar to me, I can’t explain why, it’s like we already knew each other.

Oh God, I got goosebumps just by writing this…

I’ve just decided to put back the sheets, I’ll get rid of the painting eventually.

**Monday, August 14th, 2023 - 9 : 00 AM**

I haven’t slept last night again, it was impossible.

When I went downstairs to drink some water, I got stopped by some noises coming from the office. Oh God, I can’t believe I’m writing this, but I swear, I heard hoofs walking around the house. I was dreaming, there is no other possibilities.

I got brave enough and went to the office to take off the sheets of the painting. The creature was still there, with its familiar look. It looks like it could see through me. And then nothing, complete void.

I woke up an hour later, still in the office, it must have been a dream. The half-human, half-goat creature was looking on the opposite side of the room.

**Monday, August 14th, 2023 - 5 : 00 PM**

Earlier today, I remembered that my brother left me a letter with the painting ? How I could forget that ?

In his letter, he explained where he got the painting and why he bought it. My brother is a connoisseur of mysterious objects, so when he learned the existence of a cursed painting to be sold at auction, he did everything to get it. According to the seller, this very old painting brings luck and fortune to anyone who owns it for at least six nights. So, to get all of that, you have to live with it for six nights. My brother never really believed it, but couldn’t resist adding it to his collection.

In his letter, he talks about the reason of his suicide. I was in shock, he preferred to end his life rather than spending one more night with the painting. I don’t understand, he could have just thrown it away, destroyed it or burnt it. Instead of that, he sent it to me to spare Marie and he was counting on me to find a solution.

I don’t know what to think about it, my brother must have lost his mind in his last moments, I’m wondering if I should talk to Marie or the police about it.

**Tuesday, August 15th, 2023 - 5 : 30 AM**

I can’t sleep again, I consistently perceive sounds, but this time, all over the house. I also feel like I’m being watched. Not only that, but I’ve talked to Annie about that and she didn’t hear anything, she must think I’m losing my mind. It must be a hallucination due to the lack of sleeping. My brother’s death is affecting me more than I thought it would.

I’m also thinking about that painting, I will get rid of it, I haven't slept for three days now.

**Tuesday, August 15th, 2023 - 9 : 00 PM**

I’m feeling so much better. This afternoon, I have bought sleeping tablets and I’ve burnt the painting in the backyard. I will sleep so much better tonight.

**Wednesday, August 16th, 2023 - 3 : 30 AM**

Oh God, something just happened, and I don’t know if it’s a good thing to write it down. If somebody reads this, they will think I’m mental. But I have to write, I have to put on paper just to see how crazy that was.

I was finally asleep, but I felt like I was being watched, it woke me up. My eyes were wide open and I saw the human-goat at the end of my bed with a knife in its hand. It was saying on repeat, “ Kill them ”. My loud screams were enough to wake Annie up. Then, the human-goat disappeared.  I thought I had a nightmare, so I went downstairs and I saw it. The painting was in my living-room, how is this possible ? I have burnt the shit out of this painting. I went upstairs to ask Annie about that. She confirmed that I went into the backyard, but that I stood still for half an hour, and that I insisted on hanging the painting on the living-room wall.

I'm starting to wonder if that was a bad joke from Annie. Why is she doing this ? After everything that happened.

I need to get my shit back together, the funeral is planned for tomorrow.

**Wednesday, August 16th, 2023 - 9 : 00 PM**

Today was long, the funeral was unbearable. I felt like it was there all the time, it’s getting closer and closer. But, what got me mad was my wife, she was faking tears, so she got all the attention. She didn’t know my brother like I did and she had the nerve to do that in front of my entire family. I had to control my anger during the ceremonies.

I’m going to bed right now, I hope I will be able to finally sleep.

**Thursday, August 17th, 2023 - 10 : 50 PM**

I have talked a lot to the human-goat last night, I think it understands me like no one did.

After everything that happened, I believe in the power of the painting. Tonight is the sixth night. Once it passes, all my problems won’t be there any more and I’ll live a happy life.

So, that was the last entry. The next night, he killed his entire family, including himself. Like I’ve mentioned earlier, I don’t believe in that sort of thing but, since I couldn't sleep last night, I went back to the police station earlier than I usually do and went to look at the investigation pieces, more specifically, the painting.

The human-goat had its eyes open.

I need your help.
