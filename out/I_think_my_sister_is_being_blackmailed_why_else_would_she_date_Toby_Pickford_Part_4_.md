--

In the weeks which followed after my return from the hospital my Toby-possessed family did their best, for a short while, to pick up the slack around the house. 

They cooked, they cleaned, and they continued to play their parts outside the house to perfection. 

Their improved behaviour lasted for about a month before they started going back to their old habits of sticking to their rooms and eating junk food. 

I couldn't pick up the slack like I had done before. Not just because of my broken arm, but because I was in no fit state to look after myself, let alone them. 

I had developed chronic insomnia. 

After trying so hard to keep things together myself I, like the rest of my possessed family, just kind of gave up trying. The difference between me and them however was that I stopped leaving the house altogether, whilst they continued their perfect charade as usual. 

They had considered threatening me to make me act right, but quickly found that I just didn't have it in me to be afraid of them like before. 

Nine months passed. My insomnia didn't get any better. Most days I spent with Toby. Although I hadn't been there when the conversation happened, I was sure Toby-Leigh, Toby-Mum, and Toby-Dad had pressured him into keeping constant watch over me. 

In a somewhat ironic twist I had become, in their minds at least, a suicide risk. 

They were giving me too much credit. I had stopped feeling any emotion except for a constant apathetic numbness which, at times, threatened to give way to gut-wrenching dread. 

I lost a lot of weight, dropping from sixty kilograms down to a mere fifty-five kg. Eating any food at all seemed like a gigantic chore. Swallowing even a mouthful of water was like trying not to choke on a throatful of thick maple syrup. 

The only thing which brought me any semblance of joy at all was drawing. For about an hour a day I was able to muster the concentration and effort to draw whatever came to mind. Over the nine months I filled multiple sketch books and notepads with doodles of manga drawings; nothing particularly coherent, just sketches of characters and some landscapes. 

Toby bought me more pens and pencils and paper when I needed it. Most of the time however he just sat in the room with me and watched whatever it was I was doing, whether that was me staring at the TV at whatever show or movie he put on, or him playing a video game; most of the time when I watched I was so lost in my own thoughts all I saw was the lights changing in front of me and the changes in sound. My sleep deprived mind didn't have the bandwidth to concentrate on any of it for more than a few minutes here or there. 

The dirty dishes in the kitchen mounted until a thick, nasty odor stank throughout the entire house. Cups of tea and coffee and cans of soft drinks were left all over the house. 

Over the nine months my possessed family, as well as Toby and myself, watched on as the grime and filth took over close to every inch of the house. 

The curtains were drawn to keep the neighbors from looking in at the mess. The windows were closed, which trapped the horrid stench and the countless flies buzzing around. 

The upstairs toilet was clogged sometime in the fourth month, and no effort was made to fix it. After several more uses of the toilet were made by the others, the bathroom door was simply shut, leaving the contents of the toilet to marinate. 

The sheer horrendous living conditions my Toby-possessed family had descended to was something which I hoped might make them decide to give up control of my family's bodies. 

The incident with whatever the *thing* was – I had decided at some point that it was a demon, and thought of it as such – had confirmed at least one thing for me. It was possible to give up control of a body. The demon had wanted me to astral project out of my own body, so it was reasonable to assume that Toby, the ones controlling my sister, mother, and father, might also be able to willingly give up their bodies too. 

The question was whether or not there even was my family's minds, their souls, somewhere still in their bodies. Or had Toby, in the act of possessing them, somehow over-written, removed, or erased their souls from their bodies for good?

My biggest consolation was that the Toby's possessing my family weren't able to go from body to body, the way someone might change their t-shirt. They had told me before that they were trapped in their bodies, and only had the power to imprint a new copy of their minds onto other people. For that reason I wasn't afraid they might possess anyone else as a means to avoid living in such a disgusting environment at home. 

The only effort any of them made at home was when they prepared to leave the house to continue their charade. I wondered why they still maintained the charade, and guessed it was their way of taking a break from the reality of being their true Toby-selves at home; getting the same satisfaction of pretending to be my family member's as if they were in a pleasant dream; on some level keeping up the charade must have been exhausting for them.  

One night Toby came upstairs and sat in my bedroom with me. I was sitting on the floor drawing the mote of a heavily fortified castle. 

"Here you go," Toby said, setting down a takeaway cheeseburger and a small bag of salted fries. 

I looked at the food having no appetite for it at all.Toby started eating his own burger. 

"I was thinking we could go out for a walk tonight," said Toby jovially after he swallowed a mouthful of burger, "What do you think?" 

I just stared at him. 

Toby patted the carpet. 

"Darn," he said, "Where's the-" 

"-you forgot these," said Toby-Dad from my bedroom door. 

He stepped over a box containing the moldy remains of a takeaway curry in order to hand over two cans of cola. 

Toby took them and Toby-Dad lingered for a moment. He just stood and watched me drawing the same way Toby liked to watch me. I just kept drawing and at some point over the next ten minutes Toby-Dad left the room without me noticing. 

Toby slurped from his can of cola after chowing down his burger. 

"So," he said, "You want to go for that walk?" 

Again, I just stared at Toby. A part of me was in disbelief with how he was behaving. At some point he seemed to have stopped trying to act guilty about the whole situation. If anything, he seemed pleased how things had turned out. He had only resisted spending every waking hour in my company out of a sense of guilt, but nine months in, he stopped pretending.

He was finally happy. 

"Oh Mike," he said, "Eat something." 

I hadn't eaten in at least twenty-four hours and, if anything, I still felt too full to eat. My lips however were parched so I took my can of cola and took a tentative sip. Swallowing the fizzing sweet liquid was tough. It took me about thirty minutes to manage a handful of gulps. 

I woke up sometime later. 

I quickly found there was something tight against my mouth. It took concentrated effort from me not to gag on the wad of whatever dry fabric was there.

My eyes struggled to open. Slowly, I took in the confines of my Dad's car. I was in the middle backseat. The car was still in the garage. 

Toby was next to me to my left. His eyes were wide and frantic and he, like me, had his mouth gagged and his hands and feet bound with lengths of rope.

Toby-Leigh was sitting unbound, ungagged, to my right. Her face was tinged with gold from the car's dome light.

Toby-Mum was sitting in the passenger seat, also not bound or gagged, and was looking at the three of us in the backseat as if proud of us. 

The car engine was running. Toby-Dad closed the door which led into the house and got into the driver's seat of the car. 

"Okay!" he said, with a strange jovialness, "Everybody ready?" 

Toby squirmed with every ounce of his strength beside me. I just stared back at my Toby-possessed family whilst also trying to continue breathing through my nostrils. 

Toby-Dad turned the keys in the ignition, revving up the car. The emission from the car, trapped in the garage with nowhere to go, started to thicken in the air. 

"Toby you can keep fighting if you want but nothing is going to change," said Toby-Dad. 

It was as if Toby couldn't hear them at all, he continued to try and break free of the rope binding his hands and feet with every fiber of his being. I could see however how utterly useless these attempts of his were. 

My mind felt drowsy, no doubt from whatever they had slipped into my cola before. 

"Wait," said Toby-Leigh, as if remembering something very important. 

Toby-Mum veered round again and I saw Toby-Dad looking at us from the front mirror. 

"You're not having second thoughts?" said Toby-Dad. 

"No," said Toby-Leigh, "I just think we should let Mike say goodbye to his family. Don't you think that would be the kind thing to do?" 

Toby-Mum and Toby-Dad considered this. By this point the stink coming from the house was becoming strongly mingled with the fumes quickly filling the garage. 

Toby-Dad killed the engine. 

"You're right," he said, "It's the least we can do." 

As if breaking character Toby-Leigh, Toby-Mum, and Toby-Dad all changed suddenly. Their gazes looked about the confines of the car until they found me. 

"Mike!" said Toby-Leigh, but she sounded so much like the real Leigh. 

I felt her arms wrap around me as she held me close. She started to sob. Her whole body was trembling. 

"I'm so sorry," she said over and over again, "There's nothing we could do." 

I looked at Leigh and saw my sister looking back at me, her face shiny-slick from building sweat and the fresh tears streaming down her face. My heart ached, having almost forgotten what it was like to be close to my real sister. 

I felt Mum's hand at my knee. Mum was crying too. 

"You've been so brave," she said, "We've been here the whole time. We'll be with you again when this is over. Okay?" 

I found myself nodding profusely, tears running down my cheeks too. 

"I'm proud of you, son," said Dad in a shaky voice. His hand rested on my other knee. He sniffled, fighting the onset of tears. 

"It'll be like going to sleep," said Leigh into my ear encouragingly, "Then we'll be together again." 

I nodded, not caring it was all a lie. 

And then all at once the performance stopped and Toby-Leigh, Toby-Mum, and Toby-Dad snapped back into the driver's seat of their bodies. They sniffled and wiped away the tears that were on their faces, tears which none felt belonged to them. 

Toby-Dad started the car engine again. And again thick car exhaust began to fill the garage. 

Toby-Leigh, Toby-Mum, and Toby-Dad sat back in their seats, ready and prepared to die. 

Toby had worn himself out trying to get free of the ropes binding him. Instead he looked at me with wide unblinking eyes. 

The fumes in the car steadily built and, bit by bit, what oxygen was left in the garage was steadily used up by the car's running engine. 

Relief took hold of me. One way or another at least this was all going to be finally over.

\*

I woke up in my bedroom. 

Toby-Leigh's face swam hazily into view as my eyes struggled to focus on her face. 

She was crying. 

"Mike?" she said, "Are you okay?" 

"Yes," I said, my voice weak and hoarse. 

Toby-Leigh looked incredibly relieved. She didn't bother to wipe the tears from her eyes. 

"Mike," she said, smiling, "It's me, it's Leigh." 

My stomach tied up in knots. 

*No,* I thought, *It can't be true. It's too good to be true. I don't believe it.* 

"Mike," she said again, "We're back. We're all back. Are you…still you?" she said. 

Toby-Leigh, or maybe, somehow, just the real Leigh, looked me over with a hint of suspicion. 

"I'm…still me," I said, weakly. 

My sister dove onto me, wrapping me up in her arms and sobbing. 

*Maybe I died,* I thought, *Maybe this is some kind of heaven and the nightmare is over?* 

"Mum! Dad!" Leigh cried out, and quickly Mum and Dad came thundering up the stairs. 

"Mike! Mike!" they both exclaimed, sobbing and taking hold of me. 

It had quickly become one big family hug. 

But I couldn't let myself feel the relief of having my family back. I still had too my questions. 

"Where's Toby?" I said. 

It took a few moments for my family to ease off me. Their moods darkened. 

"He's gone," said Mum. 

"Where?" I said. 

"We don't know," said Mum, "We came back to ourselves. Regained control of our bodies. We've been able to see and hear everything that has happened this whole time. We're back." 

I noticed then what looked like deep scratch marks at Mum's neck. 

"We took the ropes off him," said Dad, "But he tried to hurt us. He'd lost his mind. We couldn't calm him down." 

*So where is he?* I thought. 

"He ran off," said Dad, "And if you ask me; good riddance." 

I sat up a little, my whole body ached. Every breath of mine was a hard wheeze. 

"But he might come back," I said, "He might try and take you all over again." 

"I don't think so," said Dad. 

Mum and Leigh nodded, agreeing with Dad. 

"His face looked…*wrong,"* said Dad, "I don't think it was Toby who was in control of his body when he left." 

*The demon,* I thought. 

"So he's out there, somewhere?" I said. 

Dad nodded. 

"What if he comes back?" I said. 

"Then we'll have to handle it if he does," said Dad, "But we can't call the police right now. Not with the house in the state it's in, not with you like you are. We need to put things right first." 

Dad ran his hand through my hair. 

"It's going to be alright, son," he said, "You rest up. We're going to get everything back to the way it was. Promise." 

Mum kissed me on my cheek. "We're so proud of you," she said. 

Her words echoed what I had heard before in the car, when Toby had given me back my family for a few moments. 

As much as I wanted to believe my family was back, I simply couldn't allow myself to accept they were for a long time. 

In the days that followed Mum, Dad, and Leigh made it their mission to clean up the house. This was no easy task, but they set to it diligently. 

They didn't go off to hang out with friends or go to work like the Tobies had done when keeping up their charade. Instead they made excuses for their absences and devoted all their time to undoing the damage the Tobies had done. 

My insomnia and difficulty eating didn't go away overnight. 

A month later I still found it difficult to sleep, but managed to get several hours in a night rather than none at all. 

Mum took it upon herself to make sure I ate properly, feeding me a range of supplements on top of her usual home cooked meals. 

We kept a wary watch out for Toby's return, but he had seemed to vanish after he had been set free. The thought of a demon-possessed Toby prowling the world kept me up at night, and had me always on guard no matter what I was doing at home. His family had asked us if we knew about his disappearance, even suspected we had something to do with it. It helped that none of my family knew where he was, making it that much easier to plead our innocence when a police investigation was underway. 

Although the whereabouts of Toby remained a mystery, everything else returned to normal. It was surprisingly easy for my family to slip back into their old routines, because Toby, to his credit, had done well to maintain their social lives out of the house. 

Leigh and Mum had complained a good deal about all the weight they had put on, but it wasn't anything a steady diet couldn't fix. 

The whole ordeal however had left me damaged. I couldn't help but remain suspicious of my family even six months after they had returned to their bodies. 

The house was back to normal, their behavior was consistently normal too, but still the lingering question of *what if* Toby was still inside them somewhere plagued my mind. 

I asked them a thousand questions to get to the bottom of what happened the night the Tobies had planned their group suicide in the car. 

Had my theory been right? Had they somehow given up possession of my family's bodies somewhere within the midst of dying? 

*The demon,* I thought, again, the one that had wanted my body. Had it played a part, somehow, in ridding us of Toby? Had the demon, in the act of claiming its most coveted prize - a human vessel - inadvertently done some good? 

There was no clear answer. 

When I was finally able to get a good night's sleep on a regular basis I would have the same nightmare of a horrible, rotting face. In my nightmare I would think of this face as *the demon*. 

During the nightmare the demon would chase Toby, me, and the rest of my family through a funhouse mirror maze. Each time I lost sight of my family, instead seeing reflections of myself everywhere I went. Sometimes the dream ended with the rotting face of the demon finding Toby, smothering him like a mask as he thrashed and screamed. Other times I found myself lost in the maze, with only my reflections for company, desperately seeking a way out but never finding it - not until I finally woke up. 

But maybe that's all it was? Just a nightmare? That was all that was left of Toby's influence in my life? 

I often found myself gazing into the bathroom mirror wondering if, maybe, I was no longer me. What if the demon had taken me over somehow? Would I know it? My family, according to what they told me, were painfully aware of everything Toby had done when he was in control of them. 

I still felt in control of myself. 

After a while I had to admit to myself that everything was okay. Things really had returned to normal. The nightmare was over. 

I would still need to keep a vigilant watch for Toby Pickford, wherever he might be (Dad had bought a state of the art security system for the house as an extra precaution.) 

I don't know if this will be my final entry. I hope the nightmare is well and truly over. 

I was going to wrap things up here but there was something I thought worth mentioning. Something I wish I hadn't seen.

In my paranoia I decided to look for any potential clues that Toby might still be hidden somewhere inside each member of my family. 

What if he had decided to commit a different kind of suicide? What if he decided to diminish himself in their bodies, going so deep inside my family as if to pretend to be no longer there? Would I be able to tell if my family was truly back? I doubted Toby was still in control because the house was no longer a disgusting mess, and in every aspect my family had returned to normal. 

One afternoon, when Leigh, Mum, and Dad were out of the house, I decided to go snooping around their rooms. 

I checked Leigh's room first. 

To my relief, and after a very invasive search, I didn't find anything amiss. 

That is, until I checked under Leigh's mattress. 

What I found was something that should have been innocuous. 

It was a notebook and several pens. Within the notebook was a wealth of amazing doodles. All of them in a manga style. My style to be exact. 

*It doesn't mean anything,* I thought to myself, *don't jump to conclusions.* 

I took a photo of the drawings with my phone and put everything back as I found it. Then I searched Mum and Dad's room. After a long search I found what I really hoped I wasn't able to find. 

Two notebooks, filled with manga drawings, hidden away in the back of their closet. All in the same style as my skill level of drawing. All the same style as the drawings in Leigh's notebook. 

I took more pictures, saving them to my phone, giving myself time to go over and compare them. 

I don't want to jump to conclusions, but I really, really hope my suspicion is wrong. 

I don't know if this will be my last entry. 

Maybe I should just let things be.
