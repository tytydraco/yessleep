The first time I met Emily was a cool spring afternoon. I was walking alone through the park, still adjusting to the new town, when I saw her. She was standing on the bridge overlooking the creek, tossing pebbles into the water one at a time. Her hair was messy, tied back with a fraying green ribbon, and her sneakers were caked with mud.

“Why do you think the trees whisper?” she asked without looking at me.

I paused, unsure if she was even talking to me. “Uh, the wind?”

She shook her head, tossing another pebble. “Nah. I think it’s ghosts.” She finally turned to face me, her eyes bright and curious. “You believe in ghosts?”

“I don’t know,” I said. “Do you?”

She shrugged. “Maybe. There’s something about this place, though. Feels like something’s watching, doesn’t it?”

I looked around, but all I saw were the trees and the path stretching into the distance. “Not really.”

She smiled, a crooked little grin that made it feel like I’d already lost whatever game we were playing. “Guess you’re not paying attention.”

That was Emily. Always saying things that made me feel like I was a step behind her. I didn’t mind, though.

It didn’t take long for us to become friends. We started meeting at the park after school, walking the same trail every time. Emily was like no one I’d ever met—bold, funny, always teetering on the edge of something wild. She talked about ghosts and curses and other ridiculous things like they were real, but she also had this way of making the world seem brighter, less heavy.

And the park… the park was strange.

The trees hung low over the path, their branches tangled together like they were keeping secrets. The air was always cooler there, even in the summer. And the leaves—those deep red, almost black leaves—lined the trail no matter the season.

“Why are they so dark?” I asked her once.

She bent down to pick one up, twirling it between her fingers. “Because they’re dead,” she said, dropping it. “But they don’t know it yet.”

I laughed, but the way she said it made the hair on my arms stand up.

By fall, I knew I loved her.

It wasn’t just the way she smiled, or how she could make anything—even math class—fun. It was how she made me feel less invisible, like I mattered. I wanted to tell her, but I never quite found the courage.

The last time I saw her, we were walking the trail as usual. She was quieter than normal, her hands stuffed into her jacket pockets.

“You ever think about running away?” she asked suddenly.

“Running away from what?”

She kicked at a pile of leaves, scattering them across the path. “I don’t know. Just… everything. School, parents, all of it.”

“Where would you go?”

“Anywhere.” She stopped and looked at me, her eyes serious. “Would you come with me?”

I wanted to say yes. I wanted to tell her I’d go anywhere she wanted, but the words got caught in my throat.

She smiled, soft and sad, and said, “Just kidding,” before walking ahead.

Later, I realized she wasn’t kidding. Not really.

Her parents fought all the time—loud, bitter arguments that echoed through the walls of their house. She’d told me, in bits and pieces, how she felt like she was always the one trying to fix things, like she was responsible for their happiness. She’d never said it outright, but I think she wanted to escape more than she let on. That was why she was always at the park, why she never stayed home for long.

That night, I dreamed about the park. The leaves were everywhere, swirling around me, pulling me deeper into the woods. The air was thick, and the trees seemed to lean closer, their branches reaching for me.

I woke up in a cold sweat, my chest tight.

The blue nighttime sky was visible through the crack in my curtains, a deep, dark expanse that seemed to stretch forever. The shadows in my room were too thick, and my mind was still stuck in the dream. I needed something real, something that would ground me back in the waking world.

I stood up, stumbling towards the window, the dream still heavy on me. My hands gripped the curtain, pulling it aside, and for a moment, the chill of the night air touched my skin. Outside, the street was covered in those same crimson leaves. They were everywhere. All the way down the road, piled up like a blanket.

I froze. My heart started to pound.

I went to school the next morning like nothing was wrong. Emily wasn’t in homeroom, but that wasn’t unusual; she skipped sometimes when she felt like it. I figured I’d see her at lunch, and when I didn’t, I told myself she was just avoiding me. Maybe I’d said something wrong the day before.

It wasn’t until I got home that I found out she was missing.

My mom was on the phone with Emily’s mom, her voice low and urgent. “She never came home,” she said, her eyes darting to me. “The police are looking, but…”

The rest of her sentence was drowned out by the roaring in my ears.

The days after Emily disappeared were a blur.

The park was swarming with cops, their voices crackling over radios as they searched the woods. The school was quiet, heavy with whispers and rumors.

“Do you think she ran away?”
“Maybe she had a boyfriend no one knew about.”
“What if someone, like, took her?”

I hated them all for talking about her like that, like she was just another story to pass the time.

My parents didn’t know what to do with me. They tried to talk to me, to ask how I was feeling, but I didn’t have the words to explain it. The world felt gray, dull, like someone had turned the volume all the way down.

And the leaves…

They were everywhere. On the path to school, in the gutters, even on my shoes. I couldn’t escape them, no matter where I went.

I started skipping school, wandering the park for hours, hoping I’d find something the cops had missed. I knew it was stupid, but I couldn’t sit at home and do nothing.

One afternoon, I saw it—a trail of leaves, stretching deeper into the woods than I’d ever gone before. They weren’t scattered like usual; they were lined up, leading somewhere.

I followed them.

The deeper I went, the quieter the world became. The only sound was the crunch of leaves under my feet, and even that felt muted.

Finally, I saw it—a small, crumbling cabin hidden among the trees. The door was ajar, and the leaves spilled inside like they were beckoning me.

My hands were shaking as I stepped inside.

The smell hit me first—rotting leaves and something worse, something sharp and metallic.

And then I saw her.

She was lying in the corner, her body pale and still. Her hair was tangled with leaves, and her eyes… they were open, staring at nothing.

My breath hitched, and for a moment, I thought I was dreaming. Maybe this was all a mistake. But there she was—Emily—just like I remembered her, but wrong. So wrong. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t speak. My chest felt like it was caving in.

I didn’t know how long I sat there, just staring at her, but eventually I heard voices in the distance. The sound of footsteps, of people calling her name.

The police found me in the cabin, staring at Emily’s body. I don’t know how long I was there. I couldn’t tell them anything, not the way I wanted to. My words felt like they were all tangled up, and nothing made sense.

They said they found the man a few days later. He was a drifter, living on the outskirts of town for years, using the park as a hideout. They said he’d been watching Emily for months, but I didn’t care about his story. What mattered was that he had ruined everything.

When they found him, they said his hands were dirty, covered in soil and leaves. His backpack was full of them, crammed in tight as if he had been collecting them for a long time.

I didn’t know what to think.

They said he was crazy. A loner. But none of it mattered.

Emily was gone.

I don’t know how to explain it, but Emily’s death changed something in me. There was a deep, gnawing emptiness, like a part of me had been ripped out and left behind in the woods.

The leaves kept falling, every autumn. They’d cover the paths, cover the trail, and I would look at them, frozen, for minutes on end. But they weren’t just leaves anymore. They were a reminder. They were a mark.

The cops found the man. They called him insane. But none of it mattered.

Emily was gone, and the leaves were still there, falling quietly, as if they’d always been.
