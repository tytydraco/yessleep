When you shoot up heroin, you lay on your side, never your back. This way, if you vomit in your sleep, you won't choke.

My mother graduated rehab when I was five. She gained custody of me a year later. My dad didn't fight her in court, and I was glad. I didn't hate my father. He wasn't abusive or anything like that, we just never really got along the way most sons and fathers do. It seemed like he was always somewhere else. His life was a simple routine. Go to work, come home, cook dinner for us, then take his plate and bottle of budweiser to his room and to watch TV.

My mom, despite her addiction, was different. I was the center of her world, and she always made sure I knew. So when my dad told me I'd be moving back in with her, I was thrilled.

We had a small, two bedroom apartment in New Jersey. The routine was different there. Each morning, my mom would wake me up and make breakfast. She'd drive me to school on her way to work, which was a nice change as I no longer had to take the bus. 

A couple months after she got me back, she bought a rabbit. Apparently, she'd seen a bunch of videos of bunnies and started to obsess over it. Looking back, it makes sense. When an addict quits heroin, it becomes much harder for the brain to produce serotonin naturally. Having something cute to take care of filled that gap. At least for a little while. 

She named the rabbit Virgil.

My mom was glued to that rabbit. She never kept him in a cage unless she was at work. Whenever we took road trips, we'd take him with. Whenever we'd eat dinner, she'd leave a plate of lettuce under the table so we could all eat together. For all intents and purposes, he was a member of our family.

She stayed clean for another year. Then she met Mark.

Mark was a waiter at the restaurant my mom worked at. He seemed alright at first. He never gave me a reason to dislike him, but he never really gave me a reason to like him either. He mostly ignored me whenever he came over, just hung out with my mom and watched TV. It wasn't long before he moved in with us. 

Mark would fall asleep a lot, often in the middle of conversations. Sometimes he'd nod out while standing up. It was weird, but I was 6 so I didn't think too much about it. At least until my mom started doing it too. 

The routine changed again. Soon, I was getting up alone in the mornings and taking the bus, like before. Mom would forget to feed Virgil a lot, so I became his sole caretaker, leaving him a plate of lettuce in the mornings before school and a plate at night. Sometimes I'd find burnt spoons in her room. Sometimes there'd be something blue in it. It was a pretty blue, like the blue markings on the backs of those poisonous frogs they find in the rainforest. Like the blue face of an asphyxiated body. 

She'd didn't talk a lot in those last couple months. The silence was strange for a house that used to be full of her laughter. It was stranger when she did talk.

She'd say my name sometimes, but she'd be looking in the other direction, staring into space. “Jonah,” she'd say. “You made it. I missed you so much.” 

“Virgil's going down,” I remember her saying once. She was standing in the kitchen, stirring an empty pot she'd forgotten to put water in. “Down, down, down. All the way to Ninevah.” She smiled and turned to me, her eyes barely open. “We're gonna meet him there. Just you and me kid. You and me against the world.”

After a couple months of this, Mark suddenly disappeared. Apparently, the cash my mom pulled out for rent at the end of the month disappeared too. My mom lost her shit.

My mom walked through the kitchen and everything in her path was broken to pieces. Glasses and plates were shattered against the wall, pots thrown to the floor. She only stopped when I started to cry.

In an instant the rage was gone and she was swooping her arms around me and holding me. Sweat and tears poured down her face as I sobbed into her shoulder. We stayed like that for a while, her saying “sorry” after “sorry” and me saying “it's okay” and her saying “it's not okay, I'm sorry” again.

"We're gonna be alright,” she said as Virgil hopped around the broken shards of glass in the kitchen. “You and me against the world, kid.”

She cleaned up the mess and we went back to the routine. 

---

A week later I woke up to her standing in the doorway of my bedroom. All the lights were out in the house, aside from my night light- a little globe with a lens that projected an array of constellations onto the wall. I don't know how long she had been standing there, or how long she'd been talking, but I remember the way she looked, her eyes drifting into space.

“Then you should go,” she said as Orion's Belt drifted across her face, stained blue by the light. His arrow pointed to the right wall of the room. “Go, love.”

“Mom?” I said.

Her eyes drifted down to me, and she smiled.

“It always ends right here,” she said. “Then it starts all over again. All over again. It's a skipping record.” Her eyes watered. “I'm so happy it ends here…here….with you.”
 
She took a seat on the end of my bed.

“It starts with you and it ends with you.”

She was silent for a while, staring at me and smiling. Eventually, she wiped her tears and stood up, leaning down to kiss my forehead.

“Goodnight love, I'll see you when you get up.”
 
---

The next morning, I found her there in her bed, her face blue, a trickle of vomit leaking from her mouth in the early light. The needle was still in her arm. She'd fallen asleep on her back.

---

I moved back in with my dad after the funeral. The long trip north was silent. It was always silent with my dad but it was heavier now. Looking back, I think he just didn't know what to even say.

In the time since I'd last seen him, he'd moved up to Maine to be closer to his family. It was snowing when we passed Bangor, the temperature somewhere in the negatives. The snow blew across the road in this wispy, spiritual way, like sand across a desert. The dead trees and barren farmland appeared like an alien landscape in the dark, lit by the harsh, sterile, white lights of the highway. Even with the heat in my dad's beat up old truck on at full blast, we could still see our breath in the air.

We finally arrived at the house sometime after 12 AM. My father's home was a small ossuary, barely standing over the snow blanketed oasis that stretched outward in every direction. He had no neighbors, with the exception of an even smaller house that sat across the street.

We got inside and my dad laid out the ground rules.

“Firstly, the thermostat doesn't change,” he said. “The gas for the heater comes once a month and I can barely afford that as is. Secondly, no grease can go down the drain. None. If you make soup, dump the broth outside. Otherwise, the pipes will freeze and burst.” He scratched the back of his neck. “And…uh…Thirdly…no parties, alright?”
     
Six year old me nodded in agreement, holding Virgil to my chest.
     
"Alright. Good talk. Bed's in there,” he said, pointing to my new bedroom. “Love you kid, goodnight.”

Virgil went missing a week later, while I was at school. I asked my dad where he went. He replied “Whose Virgil?”

I left food out for him around the house and out on the back porch in hopes he would show. I did this for about a week. At some point, I stopped thinking about him as much. Eventually I forgot him entirely.

I met Billie when I was fifteen. 

I didn't have a lot of friends in school. Other than a few kids I hung out with at lunch, the only real friend I had was Lee.

His full name was Ulysses. Kids used to make fun of how unusual his name was. A few teachers would crack an occasional joke about it too, more in good fun than outright mocking him. He never really minded it, but his parents hated it. 

His name had come from a species of butterfly. His mother had told me the story enough times that I could probably tell it for her. The night before Lee was born, she'd dreamt a large, fluorescent butterfly with blue and black wings had landed on her hand. The moment it touched her skin she awoke to contractions.

It wouldn't be a stretch to say Lee had helicopter parents. His father was a pastor at the local Pentecostal church and his mother was a substitute teacher, and as such he wasn't allowed to do a lot of things when he was a kid. He couldn't play games that weren't rated E10+, even after middle school. Pokémon was off the table as they considered it satanic. He’d never celebrated Halloween. He didn't get a phone until he was 14 and his parents had installed one of those phone tracking apps on it so they knew where he was at all times. 
     
Suffice to say, when his mother, who'd been substituting for the neighboring class, overheard his new English teacher say gesundheit after reading his name during rolecall, she didn't take it well.

We were on the bus that day. Lee's mother had told him she was pulling him out of public school. Neither of us lived within walking distance and neither of us could drive, so we knew we weren't going to be seeing each other too much anymore. Of course neither of us said this out loud. Instead we pitched ideas for band names.
     
“What about Institution Solution?” I suggested.

“What does that mean?” Lee replied.

I shrugged.

“I don't know, thought it sounded cool.”

“Yeah,” he agreed. “But what if we make it really big and someone asks us what it means? Then it's like one of those tattoos of Japanese letters people get where they think it says some stupid shit like ‘Dragon’ or ‘Warrior’ but it actually just says ‘Penis.’”

I laughed. 
    
“Well, do you have something better?”
     
“Penis Dragon Warrior?” he replied
     
“That could work,” I chuckled. I thought about it for a minute. “What about Nineveh?”
     
“What?” Lee replied.

“Nineveh?”

Lee had a weird look on his face.

“Why would we call it Nineveh?”

“Well,” I began, trying to think of a reason besides my mother. It had been nine years and one month to the day. “I mean it's three syllables, easy to remember.”

“Is it cause your name is Jonah?"

“Maybe.”

My house appeared from the abyss of snow outside the window. My home always reminded me of a corpse, bleak and colorless, like an animal that starved to death in the winter.

I gathered my things together as the bus slowed to a stop. The girl across the aisle from me did the same. 

“I'll see you, Lee,” I said as I stood up. Lee nodded. He had a distant look in his eyes.

The other girl and I stepped off the bus. As she crossed the street to her house, I opened my mailbox and pulled out the letters and bills that had collected since my father left for work last Monday. Working as a cross-country truck driver meant he was rarely home.

“Hey,” a voice called from behind me. I turned and saw the girl across the street, standing on her porch. “You smoke pot?”

“Yeah,” I replied.

I'd never smoked pot in my life.

“Wanna smoke a joint?” She asked.

I would later learn her real name was Alice, named after her mother. However, much to her mother's chagrin, she went by Billie instead (a shortened version of her middle name). She'd moved into the house across the street about a year ago. I'd seen her around a lot, walking the halls at school and of course on the bus and at our stop. She was usually on her own, aside from the occasional pot dealer or goth kid. In the summer, sometimes I’d see her practice skateboard tricks in her driveway. Despite all the time we'd spent near each other we'd never talked, other than the one morning she said “Bless you,” after I sneezed while waiting for the bus.  

In the winter, everything is silent. Silent enough that you can probably hear someone cough a mile away. Silent enough that I could hear every time Billie and her mother or step-dad would break into screaming matches. A lot of times she'd show up to school with unexplained bruises. Other kids talked about her sometimes. They'd say her mother was addicted to meth, that her real dad was in jail. She skipped school a lot and she'd gotten suspended three times since she started there, once for getting in a fight with a girl who insulted her friend, once for getting caught with cigarettes, and once for telling Mrs. Haley to go fuck herself after she kept calling her Alice. 

But as we sat in her bedroom, she said nothing of any of this. She said nothing at all. Instead, she just concentrated on rolling her joint in front of her dresser. 

I looked around her room, reading the band posters on her walls. Nirvana, Slipknot, Fugazi, Bauhaus, Radiohead.

“Holy shit, you like Tram?” I said, a bit too excitedly.

“Yeah,” she replied, running her hand through her short, bleached hair. “They're not bad.”

“I swear you're the first person I've met that's even heard of them.”

She kept working on the joint in silence, and I worried I'd already been too much.

"I like their song ‘Nothing Left to Say,’” she added after a while. She finished the joint and lit it. Taking a couple puffs before turning her chair to face me and passing it.

I looked at the joint for a moment, pinched between my thumb and pointer. The smell was strong and kind of gross. Something about the way I was holding it or the way I was looking at it must have tipped her off because she stopped me before I tried to smoke it.

“You know you don't have to if you don't want to,” she said.

“Yeah, I know.”

“No, seriously,” she insisted. “Don't be a hero. I'd feel bad if you freaked out.”

“I won't freak out,” I said as confidently as I could. “It smells good.”

I took a puff and held it a moment, before breaking into a hacking fit. Billie giggled, and carefully grabbed the joint from my hand before I could drop it.

“Be honest,” she said once I could breathe again. “You never smoked before, did you?”

I shook my head.

“Then that's all you're getting. I don't want you to green out,” she replied as she took a hit. I didn't fight her on it…
    
---

“Hey,” Billie said.

I glanced up to her from the floor. 

“Yeah?” I replied.

“The floor is real fascinating, isn't it?”

“What do you mean?”

“Dude,” she laughed. “You've been staring at the floor for like five minutes!”

“I was staring at the floor?”

Billie cackled and I started laughing too. My whole body felt as though I'd been wrapped in a warm blanket. My eyes were heavy and my tongue was dry. My skin was buzzing…

---

“...Ninevah?”

“What?” I replied.

“Why'd you want to call your band Ninevah?”

“How did you know about my band?”

“Dude…the bus…I sit right next to you.”

“Oh yeah,” I replied.

“So is it really just because your name's Jonah?”

I shrugged…

---

…Nothing Left to Say, by Tram, was playing through Billie's Bluetooth speaker. I was laying on the floor on my side. At some point I'd crammed myself somewhat into the crevice between the bed and the nightstand. Billie was laying on the floor across the room, on her back, staring at the ceiling. 

“I never appreciated how fucking good this song is,” I said.

“Yeah?”

“Yeah man.” I rubbed my eyes. “What even is music?” I asked after a while.

“Oh God.”

“No, seriously. Like it's just sounds…but they're ordered by like…equal increments of time. And like…only certain sounds work together in certain intervals…and it all somehow means something? I mean how do we even know how to keep rhythm? How can we measure time like instinctually?”

“What the fuck are you on about, man?” Billie laughed.

“I don't know. Like isn't time relative? Or a cube or something?”

“A cube?”

“Yeah, I think some scientist said it's a cube.”

“Okay?”

“But if it's a cube, and not like a line, then why do we see it as a line? And how do we measure that and like use it to make music? Like did we make it all up?”

“Make up what?”

“Did we make up time?” I asked.

“Sure,” she laughed. “Yeah, we made up time.”

“Weird man,” I said. I grew silent for a while. “It always ends right here,” I said. Then I started to cry. 

At the time, I didn't understand why. I never cried easily- in fact I couldn't remember the last time I had- but there I was in my neighbors bedroom, sobbing like a baby. 

"Yo man, you okay?” Billie asked, sitting up. My face grew red and I tried to stop the tears and wipe them off, but I couldn't.

Billie scooted across the room and sat next to me.

“You want to talk about it?” she asked quietly. I shook my head. “Okay. Well I'm still here.”

“I'm sorry,” I said. 

“Don't be,” she replied…

---

“...So then my dad gets out of rehab, right?” Billie continued. We were sitting next to each other now, our backs against the wall. “I think ‘Fuck yeah! Mom doesn't want me anyway. I can go live with dad!’ Then I find out he met someone there, some bitch named Theresa. Once they both got out, they moved in together, got married. Now they have some shitty cul-de-sac house in Massachusetts so he can play step-dad to her kids.” She turned to look at me. I never noticed that her eyes were grey. “I have two step-brothers and a sister, never met any of them. Can't even remember their names. He sends me pictures sometimes but I just throw them out.”

“You've never gone to his house?” I asked.

“I never got invited.”

“What an asshole,” I said.

Billie shook her head.

“I don't know,” she replied. “I still miss him. They say that addicts can't be around things that remind them of the drug, and I wasn't an easy kid. I acted out a lot. Maybe he just-”

Billie trailed off.

“That's not your fault. Fuck him,” I said.

“Yeah,” she agreed. “Fuck him.”

“My dad would probably forget I existed if I didn't live with him. He acts as if he doesn't know he's my dad or something. It's like he's just this roommate I only see once every two weeks.”

“That sucks,” Billie replied. “What's your mom like?”

“She was nice. Funny too. Really funny,” I answered. “She died when I was six. Overdose.”

“Shit,” Billie said quietly. “Well, aren't we a pair.”
     
I chuckled. 

The moment was interrupted by the jingle of keys and the sound of the front door opening.

“Dammit,” she muttered. “She's not supposed to be home til eight.” 

“Is she gonna be mad I'm here?”

“No, you're fine,” she muttered. “I'll deal with it.”

A moment later, the bedroom door swung open and her mother's face appeared, wide eyed and angry. She was still dressed in her work clothes, her black and grey hair tied back under her McDonald's cap. She glared at Billie, glanced over to me, then back to Billie.

“Who the fuck is this?” she demanded, gesturing to me. 

“My friend,” Billie replied.

“I'm Jonah,” I said awkwardly. Mrs. Wright ignored me. 

“It smells like pot in here,” she said. “You stealing my shit again?”

“I got it from Darryl,” Billie replied. “And I never stole your pot. Your boyfriend probably took it.”

“Watch your tone when you're talking to me,” her mother warned, pointing a finger at her. “And my husband didn't take shit.”

“Okay.”

“Excuse me?”

“I said okay.”

“That's not what I heard.”

“Well, that's what I said.”

Her mother's lip curled into a sneer. 

“You know I'm getting real tired of this Alice. The lying. The fucking attitude. My shit disappearing.”

“I didn't steal your fucking pot!” Billie screamed. “Your shit disappears because your high all the time and your husband is a fucking crackhead!”

“Don't you raise your voice at me, bitch! I'm your mother!” she shouted back. 

“Get the fuck out of my room!”

“If I knew that this was where my life would end up…”

“Get the fuck out of my room!

“...I would have never had you!”

“Get the fuck out of my room!”

“Why couldn't you have been a son?”

“Get out!” 

Her mother slammed the door and stormed down the hall. Billie was silent for a long time.

“I'm sorry,” she said at last. “You should probably leave.”

“Are you gonna be okay?”

“Yeah. I'll be alright.”

---

I found Virgil when I was sixteen.

I was hotboxing my room that night, laying in my room and listening to music. My dad had just left earlier in the day and wouldn't be back for two weeks so I figured it was the perfect time to smoke a joint. I still remember the song I was listening to. Since I Was Six, by The Brian Jonestown Massacre.

“And someday you'll see me
How I always saw us
And someday we'll find it
There in Nineveh"

I read the poem I'd written for Billie again, thinking I was some kind of lyrical genius. I don't think I ever planned on actually reading it to her, but some part of me had to write it down, and I figured if every band name had to have some kind of meaning, I could just turn it into a song. Of course, I still had to buy a guitar. 
     
Billie and I had gotten close in that last year since we met. We were hanging out almost everyday, smoking pot and talking shit about kids at school. Even on days we didn't hang out, we'd stay up late talking on the phone, sometimes falling asleep on the line. We had a collaborative playlist and any time we found a new song we like, we'd add it. I liked her taste in music. It seemed like every song she added became one of my favorites. 

It's weird falling in love with your best friend. When it came to Billie, I was stuck between two opposite and equally true beliefs: either she felt the same way about me that I felt about her, or there was no world she even thought of me as an option. That feeling is called cognitive dissonance. I'd just learned the phrase in Psychology I. I think I pitched it as a band name once. I folded up the piece of paper and left it on the nightstand. 

A rustling came from the closet.

I glanced over and nearly shit a brick as I laid my eyes upon it. It was a little white rabbit, sitting on his haunches and sniffing the air, his nose twitching.

It had been ten years since Virgil disappeared, and in that time I had somehow forgotten I'd ever even had a rabbit. It took me a moment to recognize him, and when I did I was far more confused than I had already been. 

“Virgil?”

The rabbit twitched his head to the sound of my voice, then hopped back into the closet, disappearing behind the corner of the wall. I climbed out of bed, swiftly dropped the joint in the ashtray I'd grabbed from my dad's room, and walked over to the closet, ducking down and crawling underneath the coats and shirts hanging from the rack. It was too dark to see him, so I felt around with my hand, hoping to find the soft fur of Virgil's back. I found nothing, other than the carpet. What was strange, was that I should've felt the left hand wall of the closet.

I crawled deeper, dipping behind the wall Virgil had hidden behind. I'd gone three feet, then four, then five. I knew it was impossible. I knew where my closet ended. Yet I kept going, feeling the bottom of my clothes brush across my back. Six feet. Seven feet. Eight feet. The deeper I crawled, the less I questioned what was happening. Nine feet. Ten feet. The clothes no longer smelled like my laundry detergent. Now they smelled old, like moth balls. Eleven feet. Twelve feet. I could see light now, dim at first, then brighter. Thirteen feet. Fourteen feet. Fifteen. Sixteen. Seventeen. 

I crawled out of the closet. I was in a new room now. It looked to be a living room, with a couch and a coffee table. The walls here were all white, with no windows. The light I'd seen had come from a lamp on an end table. I should have been afraid, or at the very least confused, but all I could think about was how nice the light looked, warm like a sunset, washing over the walls and furniture and casting long shadows across the shag carpet. Virgil was waiting for me there, sitting in the middle of the floor. 

I couldn't name the way I felt in that moment. It was like being six, and waking up in the back of my mom's car late at night to see my house out the window. It was like coming home. 

---

I never told my father about the closet. I knew he wouldn't believe it, and I didn't want him to know anyway. It was my secret, a place to go when the outside world was too much. I didn't even tell Billie. It felt irresponsible somehow.

There were other rooms beyond the living room. The first room had three doors. One lead to a kitchen, another to a bedroom with a queen sized mattress. The third lead to a hallway.

The hallway had four rooms of its own. One, of course, was the living room. Then, on the opposite wall was a door leading to a small library, complete with bookshelves on each wall and a desk in the middle. This second house even had a bathroom at the right end of the hallway. 

The last room was the strangest. 

It was completely empty, other than a large, circular table in the center, and a bright red door on the opposite wall. I'd tried to open it a few times, but it was locked. 

The last room always gave me a weird feeling when I'd walk in there. My hair would raise from my neck. Despite the fact that (like every other room) there were no windows, I always felt like I was being watched. 

It wasn't long before I was spending every day after school there. It was easier. I never thought about the problems in my life, my dad, my mom's death. It was my little paradise. Anytime I had a bad day at school or I started to think about things too much, I could just crawl back into the closet and Virgil would be waiting for me.

Time was different there too. The first night, I spent an hour there. When I finally came back, my joint was still burning in the ashtray, with half of it left to smoke. Sometimes I'd spend what felt like an entire day there, only to come out and realize it'd been no more than half an hour. I think I slept there a few nights. 

Despite the way time moved differently there, I still found myself missing things in the outside world. I missed a lot of calls, mostly from Lee. I missed the bus a few mornings after going inside to say bye to Virgil, only to get distracted with a book found in the library before, or a new smell I hadn't noticed.

No, I didn't tell Billie. Not for a month at least. Not until the night she slept over. 

I was laying in bed when the screaming started. This was nothing new. It seemed like they were fighting every night now. Eventually, there came the crash of glass shattering and everything went silent.

I texted Billie and asked if she was okay. She read it but never replied.

I had trouble sleeping after that. I thought about going inside, but I wanted to be there in case something happened and Billie needed help. I'd almost managed to fall asleep after an hour or so, but I was snapped awake by a knock at the front door. 

When I opened it, Billie was standing there. Her face was streaked with tears. Her arm was stained green and brown. As soon as she saw me she grabbed hold of me and sobbed into my shoulder.

I’d never seen her cry before. It caught me off guard. Despite everything in her life, she'd always seemed invincible somehow. 

“She ripped them up,” she managed to say between choked breaths. “All of them.”

“What?”

“My pictures. The ones my dad sent.”

I remembered when she'd said she'd thrown them out. I wondered why she had to lie about something like that.

“I'm sorry,” I replied, unsure of what to say. 

“I don't want to be here anymore,” she sobbed. “I want it to end.”

I knew I shouldn't have told her. I knew it was irresponsible, but I didn't know what else to do. I thought it would make her feel better, at least for a night. At that point, it all felt out of my hands.

“We don't have to be here,” I replied. She looked up from my shoulder.

“What?”

“There's another place.”
 
And before I knew it, I was showing her the closet, leading her down that narrow, dark corridor between the real world and that other, impossible place.
