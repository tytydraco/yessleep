I was bored to death.

A week earlier, I was caught in a car accident. I broke both of my legs, and according to the doctors who treated me, it would take about three months before I could walk again.

Great.

My friend Kyle visited me, and I told him how bored I was. It felt like I was trapped in my room, unable to go outside without help. I tried everything people suggested to keep boredom at bay: binge-watching Netflix, reading books, playing video games. Everything.

"Well," Kyle began, as if he was about to suggest something, "I can suggest you do something you’ve never done before. Something you wouldn’t normally see. It’ll keep your boredom away for at least a month."

That sounded good. But we all know, something good always comes with a "but." So I asked him directly, "But...?"

"It’s not safe."

"Hey! I got into an accident. I broke both of my legs," I said, pointing at my legs while sitting in my wheelchair. "Don’t talk to me about ‘safe’ right now," I complained.

A moment later, Kyle suggested I browse through the dark web—places where things weren’t available on the surface. Something dark, weird, illegal. You name it. Kyle was a tech guy, so he knew how to access the dark web safely. He taught me exactly how to do it and warned me not to stray from his instructions.

"Sure," I said.

So I spent the next few days sitting at my PC, in my wheelchair, browsing the dark web. I shouldn’t have been surprised when I stumbled across an internet TV website, similar to YouTube. The difference was that the content on this site was all illegal. It included things like child pornography or people eating other people. Yeah, like food ASMR videos, except this was about eating actual human flesh. Or maybe fake ones, staged to look like human flesh. Either way, watching them eat their so-called human flesh disgusted me so much that I almost threw up within the first few seconds!

Oh, and snuff films. For those unfamiliar with the term, a snuff film is a purported genre of movies where a person is actually murdered or commits suicide.

There were a few false snuff films circulated in cinema history. These were marketed as real but weren’t. However, the channel I found on the dark web, called Murder TV, claimed that the murders broadcasted were real. But having seen several false snuff films before, I knew how realistic they could look, thanks to amazing special effects.

So yeah, I enjoyed watching the channel, convinced it was just a false snuff. A channel broadcasting so-called live murders on the internet. The murders in each video looked disturbingly realistic for amateur filmmakers. I had to admit, they were creative. Each new "victim" was killed in a different way, designed to keep things fresh.

As a fan of horror and slasher movies, the site and the channel successfully kept me entertained for several days. Impressive, really.

But one night, when I logged back in, the channel horrified me.

I felt choked. I got goosebumps. I had the urge to run and escape, but with my legs broken, I couldn’t.

Murder TV had a unique upload pattern. They released two new videos weekly: one video of a "live murder" and another, uploaded a few hours later.

The second video was only 15 seconds long and contained a static image. The image, according to the description, was a photograph of the person they would murder, live, in their next video, the following week.

That night, when I opened the 15-second video, I saw the face of their next victim.

My face.
