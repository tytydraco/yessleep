It happened in the 2000s, on a casual winter day when I was in high school in Istanbul. Now, living in the US, I barely remember how to speak Turkish.

One day after school, I was walking home when I saw my usual DVD seller setting up his stand. He hadn’t been there in months after getting caught selling pirated movies. Back then, before torrent or widespread internet access, street stands like his were how you got new movies or video games. Punishments weren’t harsh: a fine, a few weeks off, and he’d be back. I walked over to him; we talked a little, and I started browsing.

“What is this?” I asked, picking up a DVD. “İbne Kovboylar?”

He laughed. “Brother, that one isn’t even out here yet. Two cowboys on a mountain, a love story. It’ll win Oscars.”

I shook my head. I wasn’t interested in a love story between two men. “Do you have the new Rakiy or Terminatör?” I used to call Sylvester Stallone *Rakiy* (Rocky) and Arnold Schwarzenegger *Terminatör* (The Terminator) because I struggled to pronounce their names. He didn’t have either, but he handed me another DVD.

“Just like *İbne Kovboylar*, this movie was only released in America,” he said. “It didn’t even come to Europe yet. It’ll probably be released here in a few months. I watched it last night. It’s just like a Steven Seagal movie.”

He showed me the DVD: Geliyorum, ve Cehennemde Benimle Birlikte Geliyor! (*I’m Coming, and Hell’s Coming with Me!*). On the cover, there was a Native American man and a blonde woman. This was the first and last time I ever saw them. I couldn’t remember their names or their characters’ names. At the time, I found it interesting, so I bought it and went home.

I changed my clothes, sat down at my desk, and turned on my old computer. My family was lower middle class. We were doing okay, but money was tight. We couldn’t afford the internet, so watching movies or playing video games was my way of killing time. Sometimes I went outside to play, but generally I chose to stay home. I thought about playing CM (Championship Manager), but I got curious about the movie and decided to watch it instead.

The movie itself was forgettable — a B-grade action flick. But just before the credits, there was a bright red flash that lasted only a second. I replayed it. In that instant, I saw something else: a man covered in blood, his body lying on a road, or maybe a sidewalk. I assumed it was an editing mistake.

The next day was the same as usual. I woke up, had breakfast, and went to school. On my way home, I saw the DVD seller again. I waved at him. When he waved back, a car ran him over. He died instantly. People gathered around the body and called the police. The police questioned me as well, since I was a witness.

When I got home, I rewatched the movie’s final scene. I was sure what I had seen was the DVD seller’s death. But this time, it showed something different. Now there was a dog with a bloody mouth and a yellow figure in the background.

At first, I didn’t understand. Later, it became clear. My parents came home from work, and we were having dinner. My father always watched TRT news during dinner. The news showed the DVD seller’s death.

“It’s unfortunate what happened to him,” my dad said. “You’re lucky that car didn’t hit you too.”

“Thanks, Dad. That’s very helpful,” I said, trying to focus on my food.

“Street dogs take another child’s life,” the reporter said. I shifted my attention to the TV.

“In Istanbul, Kadıköy, a street dog attacked a group of children playing outside. Unfortunately, the dog killed one child…” They censored the body, but a yellow dress was visible. “The dog was shot by police when it tried to attack them.”

Somehow, the DVD had shown me this scene — but why?

“Poor kid,” my mother said. “He was our old neighbor’s son. Do you remember, honey? I used to babysit him sometimes.”

“Yeah. I remember now,” my father replied.

Maybe the DVD was showing me people I was somehow connected to. After dinner, I checked it again. This time it showed a girl — a girl from my class. She was bleeding on the ground, her face staring directly at me.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. *Is there something I can do?* I asked myself. I didn’t know how, but I felt like I had to try.

The next morning, we were having breakfast. My father was reading the newspaper. I was still thinking — but then I realized it wouldn’t be necessary.

“Dad, can I see the newspaper?”

“Here, take it.”

On the front page, it was there. Her photo, next to her mother. The article said her parents were going through a divorce. Her father had come to the house to talk, to reconcile. He failed — and went mad, killing both her mother and her before killing himself.

Years passed like that. I became obsessed with the DVD. I tried to find out who made the movie, or whether the actors were involved in some kind of dark magic. I had a friend with internet access, and I asked to use it. There was nothing — no information about the actors, no production company, nothing at all.

I watched the DVD every day. I tried to help people I recognized. Once, it showed me a tiny creature. I didn’t understand what it was. Later that day, my wife told me she had a miscarriage.

My obsession ended in my early thirties. The DVD showed me my father, clutching his chest. My family has chronic heart problems — My parents were cousins, both suffering from the same condition.

I thought I was ready. I had become a doctor. Even if the DVD hadn’t shown me that scene, I knew the day would come. Saving lives gave me some satisfaction after years of uselessness. If I had never found that DVD, I don’t think I would have become a doctor.

So I was ready. If the DVD showed that scene, it meant he had little time left. I took the day off. If I had to quit my job to stay with my father, I would have.

After dinner, I felt dizzy and started vomiting. Before I collapsed I saw my father clutching his chest. I tried to stand up. I woke up in the hospital. We had eaten mushrooms that night; they were poisonous. Luckily, my wife hated mushrooms and hadn’t eaten any. She called the ambulance.

My mother and I survived. My father didn’t.

That day, I understood there was nothing I could do. I couldn’t defeat destiny. As a doctor, I’ve saved many lives. Sometimes it felt like I defeated death — but destiny can’t be beaten. If someone is meant to die that day, they will.

After my father’s death, my obsession died too. I destroyed the DVD. Now I live in the US, trying to leave all of it behind.
