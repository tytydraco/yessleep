They think I am the nightmare.

They think I am the reason the hallway temperature drops twenty degrees at 3:00 AM. They think I am the one who knocks the family photos off the mantle, shattering the glass. They think the smell of ozone and wet copper that lingers in the guest bedroom is my scent.

They are wrong.

I am not the nightmare. I am the shield.

I died in this house forty years ago. It wasn't a murder. It wasn't a tragedy. It was a slip, a fall, a broken neck on the bottom step of the oak staircase. A quick, sharp exit. I stayed because I was confused. I lingered because I was lonely.

But I remained because of It.

The Thing that lives in the crawlspace isn't a ghost. It isn't a spirit. It is older than the foundation. It is a wet, heavy, breathing mold that wears the shadows like a coat. It feeds on warmth. It drinks breath.

And for forty years, I have been the only thing standing between It and the living.

The new family moved in on a rainy Tuesday. Holt, Braylin, and their six-year-old daughter, Alli.

I watched them from the landing. They were laughing. Holt was carrying boxes, groaning theatrically about his back. Braylin was wiping mud off the hardwood floors… my floors. Alli was spinning in circles, her blonde hair flying, delighted by the echo in the empty foyer.

"It’s perfect," Braylin said, hugging Holt. "It has good bones."

I shivered. Being dead means you don't have skin to prickle, but you have a frequency. And my frequency dropped low.

It has bad bones, I tried to whisper.

My voice was just a draft. A cold puff of air that rustled Braylin’s hair.

She frowned, rubbing her arms. "Did you leave a window open? It's freezing in here."

"Old house, babe," Holt said, kissing her forehead. "Drafts are part of the charm."

They weren't drafts. It was the Thing waking up.

I felt It stir below the floorboards. I felt the vibration in the joists. A low, wet thrumming sound, like a heart beating in mud. Thump-squelch... Thump-squelch.

It smelled the fresh heat. It smelled the child.

That night, the war began.

They put Alli in the room at the end of the hall. The room directly above the access panel to the crawlspace.

I hovered in the corner, near the ceiling. I made myself small. I made myself cold.

At 2:00 AM, the house settled. The rain tapped against the glass—tap, tap, tap—masking the other sound.

Scritch.

It came from the vent in the floor.

I swooped down. I am not strong. I cannot lift furniture. I cannot scream. But I can condense. I can pull the moisture from the air and freeze it.

I focused my will on the vent. I wrapped myself around the metal grate.

The air in the room plummeted. Frost bloomed on the windowpane.

Below the grate, something hissed. It was a dry, insectile sound. Click-click-chitter.

The Thing pushed. I pushed back. I used my own cold deadness as a barrier, a plug of ice in the spiritual plumbing.

Alli stirred in her bed. She sat up, clutching her teddy bear.

"Mommy?" she whispered. Her breath plumed in the air, a white cloud.

She looked at the vent. She didn't see the black, oily tendril trying to push through the metal slats. She didn't see the yellow, pus-filled eye peering up from the dark.

She saw me.

Or, she saw the shimmer of me. The distortion in the air. The grey mist of my effort.

She screamed.

Holt burst into the room ten seconds later, flipping the light switch.

The Thing in the vent retreated instantly, sliding back down into the dark with a wet slurp. The room warmed up by a fraction.

"Alli! What is it?"

"There's a lady!" Alli sobbed, pointing at the corner where I was hovering, exhausted and fading. "A white lady made of smoke! She made the room cold!"

Holt looked around. He walked through me. It felt like walking through a spiderweb. He shivered violently

"Jesus, it is freezing in here," he muttered. He checked the window. Locked. He checked the vent. He put his hand on the metal grate.

"It's ice cold," he said to Braylin, who was now standing in the doorway. "Something’s wrong with the furnace."

"She was right there," Alli cried. "She was looking at me.

"It was just a nightmare, sweetie," Braylin soothed, picking her up. "Just a bad dream."

They took Alli into their bed that night.

Good. They were safe. But they blamed me.

For three weeks, I fought. Every time the Thing tried to creep out of the plumbing in the bathroom, I slammed the toilet lid. Bang!

Holt would yell, "What the hell is wrong with this house?"

Every time the Thing tried to manifest in the mirror, turning the reflection into a rot-filled grotesque, I cracked the glass. Snap!

"Seven years bad luck," Braylin wept, sweeping up the shards. "Holt, I don't like this. I feel like... I feel like we're not alone."

"It's just an old house, Braylin. Pipes bang. Glass breaks. Wood settles."

"It's not the wood," she whispered. "It's the cold. It follows me."

I am following you, I screamed silently. I am guarding your back!

But they couldn't hear me, and they couldn’t hear the monster.  The monster was quiet. It was a predator. It moved with the silence of black mold spreading behind wallpaper. I was the noise. I was the clutter. I was the clumsy, desperate interference.

The breaking point came on a Tuesday.

I was weak. The Thing was getting stronger. It was feeding on the tension in the house; on the fear I was inadvertently causing.

Alli was playing in the living room. The Thing was in the fireplace. I saw the soot shift. I saw a hand, a long, grey, multi-jointed limb made of ash and bone, reach out from the flue. It was reaching for Alli’s hair.

I didn't have the energy to freeze it. I didn't have the strength to slam the glass doors. I did the only thing I could. I threw the vase. I concentrated every ounce of my will into a single, kinetic shove. The heavy ceramic vase on the mantle flew off.

It didn't hit the monster. It hit the floor, inches from Alli’s head.

CRASH.

Alli screamed. The ash-hand retracted instantly.

Braylin ran in from the kitchen. She saw the shattered vase. She saw her terrified daughter.

"That's it," Braylin said, her voice trembling with a rage that terrified me. "I am not doing this anymore. Holt! Get the number."

"What number?"

"The medium. The one your sister told us about. Get him here. Tonight."

The medium arrived at sunset. His name was Mr. Morgrave. He wore a suit that was too tight and smelled of cheap cologne and sage. He carried a leather bag.

I retreated to the chandelier. I watched him walk through the house. He wasn't a fake. That was the worst part. He was real. He had the Sight.

He walked into the living room. He stopped. He looked directly up at the chandelier. Directly at me.

"I see her," he announced.

Braylin gasped. "Is she... evil?"

Morgrave narrowed his eyes. "She is... holding on. She is bound to the property. She is the source of the disturbances. The cold spots. The broken glass. The noises."

"Can you get rid of her?" Holt asked. "She almost hurt our daughter."

"No!" I shouted. My voice was a high-pitched frequency that made the dog bark, but the humans heard nothing. "I saved her! Look at the fireplace! Look at the vents!"

Morgrave ignored the dog. He opened his bag. He took out salt. He took out iron nails. He took out a bundle of dried sage.

"I can cleanse the house," he said confidently. "I will break her anchor. I will force her to cross over."

"Do it," Holt said

Morgrave began the ritual. He moved room to room, salting the windows, chanting in a language that burned my essence like acid.

Sanctificetur hoc domum...

I fled to the kitchen. He followed.

I fled to the basement door. He followed.

"You cannot hide," Morgrave intoned. "Go to the light. Leave this family in peace."

You fool! I tried to manifest. I tried to form a hand, a face, anything to show him. I am not the problem! Look down! Look at the cracks! But he was too focused on his victory.

 He cornered me in the nursery. He lit the sage. The smoke rose, thick and choking. To me, it smelled of bleach. It dissolved my form. It ate away at my memories. I felt myself untethering. The gravity of the house was letting me go.

"No," I whispered. "Please. They are defenseless."

Morgrave thrust a crucifix into the air. "By the power of the light, I banish you!"

A wave of force hit me. It was like a wind made of white fire. I was ripped from the ceiling. I was torn from the walls. I was pushed out.

I drifted through the roof, up into the cold night air. The house began to glow below me, a warm, golden shell, sealed tight against the spiritual world.

I was gone. I was free. I was crossing over. And as I rose, fading into the starlight, I looked down one last time. I saw the medium, Mr. Morgrave, packing his bag in the living room. Holt was shaking his hand. Braylin was crying tears of relief.

"It feels lighter already," Braylin said. "The air... it's warmer."

"She is gone," Morgrave said, pocketing his check. "You have your home back."

They laughed. They hugged. They locked the front door.

And then, I saw it.

Because I was outside, I could see the whole house. I could see the foundation.

The Thing in the crawlspace wasn't gone. The salt didn't hurt it. The sage didn't touch it. It wasn't a spirit. It was a fungus. It was a biology of the dark.

It felt the absence of the cold. It felt the shield vanish.

It moved. It didn't creep this time. It surged.

I watched as a black, oily stain began to spread up the exterior siding. It seeped through the weep holes in the brick. It poured into the vents.

In the living room, the fire in the hearth suddenly turned a sickly, electric blue.

Holt stopped laughing. He looked at the fireplace.

"Did you... put something in the fire?" he asked.

Braylin shook her head. "No."

The sound started. Not a scratch. Not a click.

Brummmm-Hoooooo.

A deep, resonant groan, like a foghorn, coming from the chimney.

The ash in the firebox swirled. It rose up, forming a shape. A tall, spindly figure made of grey soot and blue embers. It stepped out onto the rug.

Mr. Morgrave dropped his bag. His mouth opened, but no sound came out.

The Ash-Man tilted its head. It had no eyes. Just swirling blue voids.

THE... COLD... IS... GONE, it whispered. The voice was the sound of a house collapsing.

It pointed a long, grey finger at Alli, who was standing at the top of the stairs

THE... MEAT... IS... WARM.

I screamed from the sky, a useless, fading wail that dissipated in the wind. "I tried!" I cried. "I tried to tell you!"

Down in the house, the lights flickered and died. The blue fire from the hearth flared up, casting long, twisted shadows against the walls. I saw Holt grab a poker. I saw Braylin grab her child.

And I saw the Thing in the fireplace open its mouth, a mouth that was just a hole into the basement, and inhale.

The last thing I saw before the white light took me was the front door. It didn't open, but the wood began to rot. Instantly. The paint peeled. The oak turned to black mush. The house wasn't being haunted anymore. It was being digested.

And there was no one left to hold back the frost.
