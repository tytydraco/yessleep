They are coming for me and rightly so; you see I did something bad but my way to cover it up was worse. I didn’t get off on it and I didn’t do it to hurt her. I did it to save us, I stared at my sister eating her meal, she didn’t care she just wanted to eat, and for once in her life she was happy. 

It started on the way home after a long day, the music blared and I was dancing, I hit a patch of ice and spun out. My car made contact with something and I heard a thud, I was going too fast, I must of hit an animal I naively thought. I got out to checked the damage a few dents littered the bonnet but It wasn’t an animal, it was a woman, her bike was under my car. She had no pulse. She was dead, my life crashed before my eyes. I would lose Martha, and my license, life was going well and she was clearly dead so I did what I had too, I deserved the good life, I didn’t know what to do so I put her in the boot and flung her bike in a ditch. I drove home waiting for her to wake up but she didn’t. I got home and just went to bed. I got up that morning and looked at my car. I needed to get her out the boot and get rid of her. I always told myself that if I made a mistake I would call the police and admit it, the movies with the person avoiding the police always annoyed me. 

I was thankful to live in this house, an old hotel my parents bought in the 70s after they settled with the hospital, they left it to me with the condition that I care for my sister Martha. Martha was born with a lot of disabilities, she needed full care, Martha was my responsibility. The medical malpractice settlement set us up for life. I drove into the back and dragged the woman into the basement, the old hotel had a huge freezer and kitchen. As I stated at the dead woman I felt myself break a little. I was doing this for Martha. I cut her into manageable pieces, and stored her at the back of the freezer. I washed the blood away and moved some boxes to the spot that had stained. My sister avoided the freezer, but I couldn’t leave our guest there for long, What if someone visits, what if Martha’s home help arrives for her weekly visit and decides to snoop. 

 That night I didn’t sleep, I could feel the body in the freezer, like an itch that wouldn’t stop. I needed to get rid of her so I decided to utilise it. I learnt to skin and de-bone. I made batches of weird meat and froze it. It looked normal. Martha would eat anything, and if I cut it up small enough maybe she wouldn’t notice. Once it looked like meat I almost forgot what it really was. 

She annoyed me that day, another outing cancelled because she had a melt down. We should of been eating brunch but I was eating toast listening to her shout. so I decided to feed her some of the mystery meat, I put it in some gravy and made a stew, I made it edible and presentable, her face lit up when she seen the big portion. I watched as ate it all I felt sick but a big smile remained on her face, she finished it slowly and  walked back to the lounge laughing. She didn’t have a clue. I hate to admit it but Martha enjoyed it, for the first time she savoured every bite, it made Martha happy and a happy Martha was an easy Martha. That’s when I started to drive at night, catching people alone and making Martha her special meals .. As the missing piled up I knew it was coming to an end, if you are reading this, please don’t blame Martha, she was hungry and I needed her to be happy, she seemed to get sick without it so I advertised for home help with good rates, that’s how I picked the next one, the pay was attractive and who would suspect two sisters? They didn’t suffer, I didn’t want to hurt them but I made a promise. I would always look after Martha.
