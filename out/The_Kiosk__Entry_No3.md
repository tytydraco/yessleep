I haven't updated y'all in a few days. I had some shit happen at home. Natalia got really chummy with the redhead... Miss Six... Kristi, Kristiana? Whatever her name is.

I am thinking about telling my sis about her, that she's weird. But from what I can tell the two get along just fine. And I don't sense any – what do you call it – “malice” from her.

Not yet, at least.

Oh  yeah and the fact that I am her boyfriend now, I think that was a joke.

I mean, like, I asked her about it that morning when I got back home from work, and she just giggled. What that means in woman-speak, God knows. All I know is that I don’t know.

But she did seem a lot more up-beat than usual…

She *did* have the will and energy to cook something extra for me and dad. She usually does it hesitantly, under the pretense that dad and I will *“Burn down the kitchen making a sandwich”*. She had no complaints over the last two days… Mom does defend dad that he makes great soup. The army teaches you that, I guess.

In regards to Natalia… could be a boy. Maybe she is hinting at it, maybe not. Maybe she is lesbian? Or maybe I am a part of some clandestine plot between the bloodsucker and my sister…

What if *my sister* is a bloodsucker?

 …

Naaah, can’t imagine her being a Twilight character. And as for Miss Six? Kristina, Kristiana – whatever – she might as well be some older student that has very specific beverage tastes.

Did I mention she dresses like a formal goth? Is “formal goth” a thing?

I am going on a tangent again. I’ll just get to the entries.

Clocked in an hour ago, the usual rabble showed up. The local drunks got their usual dose of happy juice (vodka). One of the older ones bragged how his friend brought him home-made rakija as a gift…

Winston will probably come around in an hour. He usually does to see what’s up. And if there is any damage to the Kiosk… Restocking is not as common –  transdimensional hallway be blessed.

I probably should tell him that I broke the rule of going out of the kiosk… I mean it was an emergency – my sister could’ve been endangered. I should also ask him more about the “bloodsuckers”. Because I am *maybe* in a relationship with one.

I just realized, the kiosk seems… Bigger? Or maybe it is smaller? I might be imagining things.

On another note the radio is still playing, surprisingly something different for once. It is still unplugged and it should’ve ran out of power by now. Maybe it is a nuclear powered radio?

Naah, I would’ve started going bald by now. Radiation sickness too.

Well… My colleague is balding, though he is a bit older. He’s been around here for longer. Though he works day shifts.

I still haven’t asked for his name. Fuck.

 

**NOTE: ASK FOR BALDING INSOMNIACS NAME!!!**

 

**NOTE TWO: GORAN YOU IDIOT DON’T FORGET TO TELL WINSTON**

 

PS – The last song was a bit… off.

Well I almost got fired.

I asked Winston about the bloodsuckers… Or the *“teeth toting fucks”* as he so elegantly called them now. He said he doesn’t know much and doesn’t give a shit. As long as they are out, and I am in, all is good.

I wanted to ask about the numbered bottles but he got distracted by the new off-brand vodka in the hallway I mentioned. He tried it, he said it is pretty damn good.

Then I mentioned that I got out of the kiosk for a few minutes and I almost got a face full of glass and off-brand transdimensional vodka.

He told me that I had “one fucking job” and that I am an idiot.

I mean I got multiple jobs here? I serve customers and don’t go out of the kiosk?

That’s *two* jobs, if I am counting right.

Anyway, he told me not to do it again, lest the kiosk *“does the thing”* again.

What the *“thing”* is, who knows?

The kiosk is prone to doing a lot of things. Such as spawning random portals and attracting very interesting customers. Not to mention the little people.

Those tiny fucks seemed to have gotten bigger in numbers ever since the hallway manifested… Thankfully, they are colonizing the hallway, not the kiosk. But they still come around just to fuck with me.

\###

Winston also told me that to not let *anyone* into the kiosk. That includes my baby sister. Well, I can kind of guess why… Actually it is quite obvious. It smells of alcohol and mildew and knowing my sister, she’d probably gag from the stench.

I am surprised that she didn’t throw up from the smell of vomit and shit outside, but she’s got a strong stomach I guess. Still, she does not like alcohol.

Of course there’s the hallway too, that would probably weird her out. But I doubt she’d call the fucking government or something. Maybe the government is already involved in this…

I’d be surprised that they would simply lose the paperwork, knowing my country’s effective bureaucracy.

Ah, a customer. I’ll be back.

A few customers, an old face too… Well, that is not a good way of putting it. He – or *she* doesn’t really have a face. Just smooth skin. How does it breathe? I asked myself all of question before, but I am simply starting to give up now.  

It doesn’t speak as well, so… I just kinda know what it wants, like the moment I see that flat and featureless slab of skin I automatically know the brand of brandy it wants… And it wanted the off-brand vodka actually, this time. The one from the hallway.

It was like it knew… No eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue. Yet I felt like it could see into me and through me.

I call it “Faceless” – though *yes* it does look like the Slenderman, a bit. But not freakishly tall or anything, slightly taller than me maybe – and I am average. And of course the top hat, it finishes the look of some kind eldritch gentleman.

Well, it pays well, even tips me. Which is a rarity. So yeah, I don’t mind. Very formally dressed, smells of lavender and I can only smell a whiff of stale milk.

That could very well be from the environment. Nice top hat too, very clean, very clean.

The rest were the usual, local drunks, one bloodsucker I know of. Mister number two, and his usual scowling face and baggy eyes.

Well, I had nothing to do, so I started messing around with the radio again.

I think the little fucks decided to tamper with the shelves again, I swear some of the brandy and vodka has been moved… Candy bars also missing.

Anyway, I sat at the entrance of the hallway, tried to pick some new frequency. To see if that “All About Vodka FM” or “Smirnoff’s Delight FM” is actually a thing.

 After a bit of tampering – something like 15 minutes. I realized I have to inside.

Reluctantly I did, I went inside a bit deeper than I usually do. But I took care that had my eyes on the entrance at all times. I didn’t want some kind Inception or House of Leaves type fuckery turning this into the “Chronicles from the Kiosk Backrooms” or some shit.

I managed to get some kind of frequency, nothing major, mostly garbled noise. But I did hear some voices, I was able to make out some words. It sounded like a commercial. Surprisingly in English… Bear in mind – the radio station that it is stuck to is in my native language.

So maybe this shit is somewhere in America or England… Who knows. Maybe in a place where the sun never set on the British Empire and we all speak English, or something. Who knows!

At least it wasn’t any creepy shit like telling me my name or something.

As per usual the roosters kept banging and my radio kept singing… I have to take back my last sentence. The radio did start saying a name I know… Just not mine, which is even more worrying. *Natalia* – my sister.

I think I should do something about that…

Oh, and yeah. Right when it was midnight, Miss Six showed up. With her usual rhythmic banging on the window. And that tiny glint of one of her green eyes through the old news papers.

At least I know that I am not in a surprise… But I felt a lot more awkward than usual.

Because I reaaally didn’t want to skip the social contact this time. I had to get more info.

So I got up and opened the window up.

“Evening – Kristi, is it?” I said. Trying to be more… *social.*

"Well Gory darlin’ – you’re right. Kristiana!”

*Why is she using the nickname my mother gave me.*

She wanted the usual with an additional pack of cigarettes – I call that *the number six with extra dip*.

I gathered the balls to ask her a question.

“How did you meet my sister?” I asked, straight forward. To the point.

“Hun I sure hope you’re as forward with invitations as you’re with questions. Well…” She began. – “I met your sister at the university. She had struggled with her English, so I told her that I can tutor her. I am almost at native level myself!” – A decent explanation. But I had other questions…

“Ah, I see… Can I ask you something *personal*, if you don’t mind?” I asked.

“Oh, how private are talking? Diet private or bedroom private?” – She responded in her usual flirty tone.

“Did you hear the banging on the top of the kiosk when you arrived with my sister…” – I *am curious about the diet of sixes she is surviving off of.*

She squinted her eyes at me – “Banging? No, I didn’t. And I came right after your sis, she forgot some things at my place. But I knew she’d come here first. She did tell me she’ll give you a surprise visit once. Also…” – She paused – *I think she is avoiding the question. Noted.*

“Did you like what I gave you?” She asked…

“What you-“ I remembered the plastic bag… Which I haven’t touched in days.

“Oh, yeah…” – I was weighing my options, honesty? Or lies? What was in that bag? A gift? A warning? Someone’s head? Blackmail? Did she print out my search history?

“You didn’t open it.” – She answered for me.

I nodded – “Yeah… Sorry, been a bit busy.”

“I understand. Don’t worry, it won’t spoil or anything. But I think you’ll appreciate it.” She said in a more neutral tone… She seemed genuine.

“Is it the… Bottle” I asked.

She leaned in when I said that. That took me a bit by surprise, the scent of lavender perfume whiffed into my nose as she did that.

“We all have our secrets Goran, and I’d like to keep mine like that – a secret. Maybe I’ll tell you some day. Maybe not. But hun, I have to go. Take care.” She turned around, but stopped a few steps away.

“Take care of Natalia too, she’s a good and smart girl. You are blessed to have such a sibling, believe me. I am sorry that I brought her to my place, I simply wanted to talk to her some more in private. It was a risk. Alas, she’ll be safe – with a brother like you.”

She turned back around and walked off.

That last part sounded like she added it… Sounds weird, but it was like a *aha that too* kind of moment.

I just hope Natalia didn’t spill too much beans about me…

Fuck I forgot to ask her about the boyfriend part. Shit. I guess it’s nothing, she didn’t seem all too… I dunno.

I am curious about that bag though…

I think there is something in the toilet.

I am not sure what, but I swear to God that I heard some shuffling inside. And I know the walls are thinner right where the toilet is supposed to be.

It could be a fucking rooster. Which is not good news. Thankfully, the door is made out of metal and it hasn’t been banged into yet. So that is a good sign.

Maybe it’s those little fucks again, somehow colonizing the damn shitter now. I don’t care honestly I ain’t going into that hell. They can have all of it for all I care – not even God himself could cleanse that place.

Winston told me *nothing* except for us employees and himself can go inside the kiosk. That is a strict rule. I don’t know if something that *forces* itself inside counts, but I’ll see.

For context, the door to the toilet is right next to the hallway.

And yes, I turned one nook into an improvised toilet inside there.

Yes, I held in my shit and used bottles to piss up until recently. The hallway was truly a blessing… I just hope Winston doesn’t find my compost collection.

5^(th) May, 3:33

Speak of the devil, I went to take a piss and my shit was gone. Literally.

Did those little fucks get a taste for… God I don’t wanna imagine that. Well they did probably originate from the dump, but still. Vodka and shit? Fucking hell.

Or it could be the hallway fuckery for all I know. I guess that I should be careful not to drop anything in their. Thankfully the smell is gone too, I was afraid that Winston would catch on. But it was replaced by… Stale milk.

 am really getting sick of that smell.

Aaand I just heard a bang.

The toilet door.

Great, amazing. Fucking magnificent.

No shift can end peacefully in the last week I see.

When I stopped the last entry I went to check the toilet door, and I was promptly startled enough to drop on my ass by the goddamn hulk punch that left a *worryingly* large dent in the door.

For the second time this week, my heart started pounding out of its chest. I didn’t feel safe, not at all.

I thought “Well, I am royally screwed”.

Go out? Get fucked by roosters, and God knows what else – the kiosk becomes a new black hole that sucks in what is left of this country. Or remain inside, and get murdered by a rooster.

I don’t even know how the things *looks* like, let alone what it can do… But I can get an idea from the fucking dent on the door.

Then I realized, well… The hallway. Nothing else remained. The hallway.

So, when the other dent was made and when I saw the door start to break off the hinges. I grabbed a flashlight and ran for it.

I heard the sound of the door being launched in the distance. I didn’t dare look back. I just turned into an “alley” of sorts, filled with you know what. Vodka, candybars, brandy, cigarettes… I could survive in here from the looks of it if I must… I’d be an alcoholic, fat and probably have lung cancer.

But that is certainly better than being ripped apart by whatever that thing is.

It had been a minute. And I didn’t hear anything. Just my chest beating and my breaths. I was, I’d say… 100 meters in? Maybe less. Still close enough to hear something. I think.

But nothing.

I felt dizzy, disoriented.

I got up and started walking.

I then realized that the main hallway, the main highway if you will – is gone.

I didn’t feel scared. Moreso confused.

Have you ever felt like time flew by? Or like it stood still?

I felt both. Which was strange.

I felt like I just entered inside. And at the same time like it had been forever ago.

I just walked. I heard nothing but my footsteps.

I smelled mildew and vodka and tobacco and that distinct smell of plastic wrapping.

I felt nothing. Like all the will I had was consumed by something.

Then – I smelled lavender. Like a perfume. It was familiar.

So I followed it.

And after some time, it just appeared. The door. The entrance.

And the moment I stepped through it was like I got out of water. Sound returned, I heard the radio. I heard a loud bang from the door, like someone closed it all of a sudden.

And I smelled a hint of lavender. Stronger than ever inside…

The door of the toilet was on the opposite side of where it should be.

The shelves were a mess. All the vodka and alcohol was gone – with some of it being spilled onto the floor, with glass.

But I was alive. At least that.

Then I noticed something – on the ground.

A piece of sticky paper, a small note.

It had messy handwriting, but I could make it.

*“Give her”*

I feel like I definitely should do something.

I might quit.
