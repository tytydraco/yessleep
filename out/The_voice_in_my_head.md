I don’t exactly remember when I first started hearing that voice in my head. I thought everyone had them too. Like a little imp living inside one’s head, thriving on one mischievous idea after another.


“Let’s not study today and head out to play!” He often seemed innocent or harmless enough though it started taking a more nefarious turn at times. “Just ignore Mum and Dad. What do they know anyway?”


Some called it a battle between good and evil in my head. An angel and a demon trying to convince me to their cause. Except that it was only one side speaking all the time. Was I supposed to be the angel?


I never thought I needed help till I was in my late teens. “Bash his face in! He insulted you, you’re going to be pussy about this?” Thankfully my friends managed to drag me off him in time.


Frankly, I don’t think the counsellors or the psychiatrist ever really understood what was going on. How could they? To them, I was a just another rebellious teenager with anger management issues. How was I to explain that there were times the voice grew so loud in my own head it seemed to bump me out of the cockpit and take over? He knew everything about me, my weaknesses and my insecurities and he knew what made me tick.


I think I finally manage to get a handle on things after getting into meditation and the like, focusing on emptying my mind. Thankfully it did help, or yours truly would have been writing this from inside a psychiatric ward while on - a long term stay. 


The voice did return with a vengeance while I was in college. Staying in a dorm room by myself with raging hormones didn’t help a single bit. “Ah she seems passed out. You know you want it! Who would know anyway?” “Oh please, just tell her she was all over you in the morning!”


You know, it was a miracle I even graduated with honours with all the pills and drugs I took to keep him at bay in my head. The meditation and focused thoughts could only keep him quiet for so long.


He seemed to have mellowed down once I started work. Perhaps he decided to give poor old me a break for once. I don’t think I could have even functioned with him around in full force and even hold a job. Yet he was never gone, always lurking in the background and never hesitating to remind me he was there. “Oh just a push! Everyone will think he fell on his own onto the tracks.”


Things were beginning to look up. I had a girlfriend. I no longer had thoughts about ending it all, myself along with this monster inside my head. My memory is a little hazy but there were days when he uttered no more than a sentence or two.


One fine morning, I woke up after what was a long week at work. The sun seemed exceptionally brighter than usual and somehow, my head never felt as peaceful as it did today. Something was different but I couldn’t quite put a finger to it.


As I got to make my morning coffee, I could see a figure in the corner of my eye moving towards the door. Its familiar voice was as clear as it ever was.


“Goodbye Andrew.” Startled, I turned and there it was, a spitting image of me staring right back with a smirk on its face as he turned the door handle.


“I have no use for you anymore.”
