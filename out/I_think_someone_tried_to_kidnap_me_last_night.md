I wasn’t going to post this. I told myself that putting it into words would make it real, and if I didn’t do that, if I kept it vague, fuzzy, half-forgotten, maybe I could convince myself it was nothing more than a scare.

But then something else happened tonight, so I’m writing this while I still can.

Last night started normally, too normally. I worked late, the kind of shift where time blurs and you don’t notice how exhausted you are until you finally step outside. It was a little after 11 p.m., cold enough that the air stung my lungs. The streets were quiet, but not empty, just quiet enough to make you aware of every sound your own body makes, quiet enough that I could hear my own heart beating.

My walk home takes about twelve minutes. I know every crack in the pavement, every flickering streetlight. I like routines, they make you feel invisible.

Halfway through the walk, I cut through a small car park behind a row of flats. I’ve done it hundreds of times, that’s why the van didn’t register immediately.

White, no markings, parked awkwardly near the wall, angled slightly wrong, like it had been left in a hurry. I remember noticing that detail because it bothered me. I remember thinking, someone doesn’t care about parking tickets.

I had already walked past it when the door slid open, it was so quiet I didn’t hear it, just felt that sudden wrongness, like the world had shifted a fraction to the left, I turned around slowly.

A man stood there, half in shadow, one hand on the inside of the door, hood pulled low. I couldn’t see his eyes clearly, but I knew he was looking directly at me.

He smiled, not friendly, not threatening. Familiar, like he’d seen me before.

“Hey,” he said, voice relaxed. “You dropped something.”

I looked down, there was nothing, when I looked back up, he had stepped closer. I hadn’t heard his feet move. “I didn’t drop anything,” I said, my voice sounding too loud in my own ears.

His smile twitched, like he was amused by my answer.“You sure?” he asked. “Happens all the time.” The van door slid open wider, that’s when I saw the second man.

He was sitting inside, low and still, like he’d been waiting in that exact position for a long time. His hands rested on his knees, fingers flexing slowly, rhythmically. He wasn’t smiling, he wasn’t frowning, he was watching me the way you watch traffic before crossing the road.

Judging distance, timing. The first man took another step toward me, something inside me snapped into place then. No thoughts, no logic, just one overwhelming certainty. If he touches you, you’re not coming back.

I ran, I didn’t scream, I didn’t look back. My legs moved so fast they burned, my breath coming out in short, ugly gasps. I heard footsteps behind me, heavy, purposeful, and for a split second I was sure a hand was going to grab my coat.

I cut into the narrow alley between buildings, nearly slipping on wet concrete. My shoulder slammed into a wall, I kept going, I didn’t stop until I burst out onto the main road, where the streetlights were brighter and a car passed close enough that I could feel the rush of air, the footsteps stopped.

I stood there shaking, pretending to scroll through my phone so I wouldn’t look like prey. When I finally dared to glance back down the alley, it was empty, no van, no men.

I walked home the long way, sticking to lit streets, keys threaded between my fingers. Every shadow looked wrong, every engine sound made my stomach drop.

When I got inside, I locked the door, then I checked the windows, then I sat on the kitchen floor and waited for my heart to slow down.

I didn’t call the police, I kept telling myself there wasn’t enough to report, that I’d imagined the second man, that maybe it was a failed robbery, or some kind of sick joke.

I slept maybe two hours, this morning, I tried to act normal. Showered, drank coffee I couldn’t taste, laughed at something on my phone a second too late.

That’s when I went outside and saw the note, it was tucked neatly under my windscreen wiper. Folded once, no envelope.

Inside, written in careful, tidy handwriting; wrong place, next time. My car wasn’t parked near the car park, it was parked directly outside my building.

I stood there for a long time, reading it again and again, until a neighbour walked past and asked if I was okay. I smiled and said yes, I wasn’t.

All day, I felt watched, every white van made my chest tighten, I checked my mirrors constantly, I changed my route home. Tonight, I made sure someone was on the phone with me the entire walk back, nothing happened, I started to relax. Then, about twenty minutes ago, my phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number. No text, just a photo.

It’s grainy, taken at night. The angle is slightly off, like the person holding the phone was trying not to be noticed.

It’s the back of my head, I can tell exactly when it was taken, because I’m wearing the same jacket I wore last night. And if you zoom in, if you really look, you can see the reflection in the glass of a parked car in front of me, a white van, parked across the street.

I just looked out my window, there’s a van outside now, and its engine is running.
