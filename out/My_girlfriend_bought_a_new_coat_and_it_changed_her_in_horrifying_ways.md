She was so pleased with herself. And you know that feeling. You’ve worn an outfit that turned you into someone else. Someone prettier. Someone funnier. Someone better.

But Alissa’s coat didn’t simply turn her into a new person. It turned her inside *out*.

Like a doe-eyed dog, my girlfriend bounded into the kitchen with a fresh shopping haul to present. I smiled and started to nod my head in approval before I’d even seen what my girlfriend bought. It was a practised response. But this day would be different in many horrible ways. Alissa didn’t dive into the plastic shopping bag. She surprised me by letting it drop to the kitchen tiles, as if it had been burdening her. As if she’d been itching to dispose of it for hours. Itching to *finally* clutch her greatest find in both hands. The only thing she wanted to show me.

That wretched, oppressive, navy trench coat.

It wasn’t in a horrid condition. On the contrary, the double-breasted raincoat had clearly been thoroughly washed, given the faded remnants of a maroon stain around the right cuff. Still, that didn’t conceal its age. I noted the threadbare bottom, marking numerous years of wear and tear. Numerous years of scraping against floors and filth. Yet, despite all of that, the coat looked clean. Refurbished.

“*Look* at it!” Alissa cried hysterically, dribble collecting in the right-hand nook of her lips.

It was endearing at first. The glee in her near-teary eyes. The slight lump in her throat whenever she talked about the coat. Looked at the coat. *Wore* the coat.

“Very nice,” I said. “What else did you get?”

“Who *cares*?” My girlfriend asked, laughing as she slipped into the long coat. “It feels incredible.”

“How much was it?” I asked, grinning as she twirled jubilantly, letting the lower half of her coat flow outwards.

“Ten pounds!” Alissa answered, hiccuping as she started to hyperventilate. “It should have been one-hundred pounds, Derrick. *One-hundred!*”

“Wow. You sure do find some gems from charity stores,” I said. “Did you get it from Oxfam?”

She nodded eagerly. “They had a mountain of things in there. Apparently, some locals abandoned their home and begged the shop to take everything they owned.”

“That’s odd,” I said.

Alissa shrugged. “One man’s rubbish is another woman’s treasure. The shop assistant was shocked, actually.”

“Shocked?” I asked.

My girlfriend nodded. “I found this at the top of one of the boxes by the door. The woman said she hadn’t got around to unpacking everything, but she didn’t remember that coat even being there.”

“Mysterious,” I chortled.

These strange drips of trivia would mean nothing until later.

It was a little after noon on a relatively pleasant day, yet Alissa insisted on wearing the coat whilst we relaxed in the garden. Even with the sun beating down. I dismissed this, but it seemed a little strange that she chose to wear the coat during *dinner* too. And I finally said something when my girlfriend decided to continue wearing the coat whilst we watched Bake Off on the sofa.

“I know summer has nearly come to an end, but it’s not cold at all in here,” I said. “The heating’s on. Take the coat off, Alissa.”

She didn’t reply immediately. I thought she hadn’t heard me. Thought my well-layered partner had been hypnotised by the screen. Thought she’d noticed the rather appetising cherry pie being keenly surveyed by Paul Hollywood’s hypercritical gaze. Upon looking at Alissa, however, I realised her eyes were glazed. She wasn’t watching the programme at all. She was shivering with delight as she ran hands up and down the fabric of her coat.

I was about to repeat myself when she sharply spoke with a croaky, tearful giggle.

“*I would sooner take off my skin.”*

My stomach twisted. Not from my girlfriend’s alarming turn of phrase, which I would’ve viewed as a bizarre joke if the evening’s horror had ended there. No. My stomach twisted in synchronicity with the cotton coat’s twill pattern. It was not a trick of the light. The fabric was warping. *Spiralling* as the sleeves tightened against my girlfriend’s skin. As the lapels of the coat started to slice into her neck.

“Honey…” I fearfully began. “Are you…”

I lost my train of thought. Alissa had lost hers when she first donned the coat. Neither of us understood what was happening.

The colour of her neck, at first, appeared to be the result of cut-off circulation. But as the fabric only continued to tighten its grip, I realised that a red, twill pattern was forming across my girlfriend’s flesh. Stretching up her chin and along her cheeks. It was as if she were becoming one with the coat.

I screamed and reached towards her, but Alissa spun rapidly. Robotically. Her vice-like grip halted my wrist before I managed to touch the coat.

“*Don’t*,” She warned in a whisper hardly her own. “You’ll crease it.”

Then my girlfriend turned off the television and rose from the sofa with arms stretching upwards. The fabric seemed to have stopped tightening, thankfully, and it groaned woefully as Alissa flexed her arms. She, on the other hand, seemed peaceful. Blissfully aware of what was happening to her. Though her red complexion had faded, the pendulum seemed to be swinging in the other direction. She was starting to grow *pale*. Her skin appeared dry and cracked.

“Water…” She begged me, before surprisingly *removing* the coat from her frail body.

I didn’t question it. I was simply relieved to see Alissa finally take off the unnatural thing. She carried the coat and herself up to bed. Meanwhile, I tried *desperately* to convince myself that I’d hallucinated everything else.

*The coat didn’t tighten of its own accord,* I thought. *That would have been madness.*

When I summoned the courage to enter our bedroom, a few minutes later, I was relieved to find that the trench coat had been draped over an armchair in the corner. Alissa was lying on her side of the bed, looking rather unwell, yet somehow more *herself*. She smiled warmly as I handed over the glass of water and started dressing down for bed.

“Thank you,” My girlfriend huskily said, taking a large swig. “I’m sorry about before, Derrick. I don’t know what came over me.”

I smiled, having chosen to forget the unnerving thing I’d seen. “It’s fine. I know you get fixated on new things. It was just far too hot to be wearing that coat today. You know that, don’t you?”

Alissa gulped down the water, then nodded weakly. “You’re right. I did feel a bit *peaky*. I’m so thirsty… I’ll probably be filling this up throughout the night.”

“I’m not surprised,” I said. “You might have heatstroke.”

She rolled her eyes. “I’m fine now. I just needed a drink. A *big* drink.”

I laughed, kissed Alissa on the cheek, then turned off the bedside lamp.

“Night,” She whispered.

“Night, you maniac,” I said.

It was the faint scratch of cotton against suede that woke me. Hardly a rustle, but loud enough to alert my sleeping mind. I turned to look at Alissa. She was sound asleep. Dead to the world, as my dad would say. But my girlfriend was, typically, a light sleeper. And I frowned, squinting at her in the moonlit room. She still looked incredibly pale. Alissa’s skin was usually so clear. So well-moisturised. On this night, however, it was peeling away. Her lips were full of deep fissures. It looked as if my girlfriend had been stranded on a desert island without sustenance.

Then came that scratching once more.

I sat up, and my eyes shot ahead, settling on something I’d been avoiding since waking up. The suede armchair. The trench coat sitting upon it. And as I eyed Alissa’s favourite piece of clothing, which had sleeves draping across the armrests, I became increasingly convinced that I was staring not at a mere coat, but a *man*.

Pareidolia is a common phenomenon. In the dark, we’ve all seen inanimate things that look like people. We’re pattern-seeking beings. But this wasn’t that. I know what I saw. I saw a man.

It sounded a third time. Just as I was about to dismiss everything and lie back down, there came another rustle. Only this time, I was looking *directly* at the source of the sound. Looking directly at the coat as it shuffled in the seat, almost imperceptibly.

Mouth gaping to release a silent screech, I spun around to check that I hadn’t lost my mind. Alissa was definitely lying beside me. She wasn’t sitting in the armchair.

But I knew I hadn’t imagined things. I knew I’d seen the coat move in the moonlight pouring through slightly-parted curtains. I knew there was a blackened shape wearing the awful piece of attire, which trailed down to the carpet. And when I returned my gaze to the armchair, preparing to be met with the oh-so-ordinary sight of a static coat, I was met with a terror beyond human understanding.

There stood a lightless, gangly figure at the end of the bed, wearing the long, navy trench coat and eyeing me with something that was not a face. Was not anything but blackness.

I yelled until my lungs deflated, whilst fumbling with the bedside lamp and almost knocking it over. In response to the racket, Alissa *finally* woke from her deep slumber, but it was too late. As if cowering under the harsh, revealing glow of the lamp, the coat tumbled to the carpet, and the dark figure was gone.

Alissa didn’t believe me, even when I pointed at the damp trail leading across the carpet from the armchair to the coat at the end of our bed. I told her I didn’t move the piece of clothing. Didn’t leave that foul-smelling trail of water.

I know that it was all real. The proof is there on her skin. The telltale twill pattern on her neck and cheeks. My girlfriend continues to absent-mindedly dismiss it as a *unique* rash, but she isn’t herself. She seems to have forgotten whatever she briefly realised for long enough to remove the coat.

And she’s started wearing it again. I tried to throw the damn thing out, but it *always* finds its way back into our home. Back onto Alissa’s body.

It’s draining her. *Drinking* from her. I realise that now. It is draining the water from her body and claiming it for itself. It wants to become stronger. That’s what I feel. The man was crooked and unbalanced on that first night. But with every passing day, he grows in strength. And the wet carpet trail is growing. Spreading throughout the house as something wanders our halls every night. I want to leave, but I have to save Alissa. No matter how much she drinks, she continues to weaken. That man is sapping her strength. Her soul.

I don’t want to know what happens to us when the creature has had its [fill](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
