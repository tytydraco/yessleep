It was a dark and stormy night. I had been driving home from work, and was now about an hour away from my house. I had made it the last few miles, but was now in the throes of a full-blown panic attack. My breaths came in short gasps and my heart was pounding so hard, it felt like it was trying to escape my chest. I pulled to the side of the road, scattering gravel, and tried to calm myself. I closed my eyes and took several deep breaths before starting the car. I crept along the road, my headlights barely piercing the darkness. I came to a fork in the road and hesitated, not sure which way to go. I decided to take the left fork, hoping it would lead me back to civilization.

The road curved and dipped, winding its way through thick woods. The trees reached out with gnarled fingers, clutching at the car as if trying to drag it into the darkness. My nerves were stretched to their limit, and I was on the verge of screaming when I saw lights ahead. I pulled into a small gas station and breathed a sigh of relief. The attendant came out of the office and asked if I needed help. I shook my head and said I just needed to fill up. The attendant went back inside and I got out of the car. I stretched my cramped muscles and looked around.

The gas station was old and run-down. The windows were boarded up, and the door to the office was propped open with a cinder block. I shivered, despite the heat, and hurried back to my car. I pumped the gas as quickly as I could and then got back in the car. I was about to pull away when I saw a figure standing in the woods, watching me. The figure was tall and thin, with long arms that hung down nearly to its knees. It had no face, only two large, black eyes that seemed to bore into my soul. My car stalled and I let out a scream. The figure began to lurch towards me, its arms outstretched. I fumbled with the keys, my hands shaking so badly I could barely hold them. I finally managed to start the car and peeled out of the parking lot, not looking back until I was on the highway.

I drove all night, not stopping until I reached my home. I ran into my house and locked the door, trembling with fear. I had no idea what that thing was, but I knew it was coming for me. It was only a matter of time before it found me again.

Next morning, I had forgoten what had happened the night before and went on with my day as normal. until something knocked on my door...

I opened it to see the faceless figure, waiting for me.

"dude, where is kenny?" it asked in a raspy voice.

I screamed and slammed the door shut, my heart pounding in my chest like a drum. I knew the thing was going to kill me, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.

A horrifying voice whispered from the other side of the door,"dude, where is kenny?"

I didn't know who Kenny was, but I knew better than to ask the faceless figure.

It was coming for me, and there was nowhere to hide,  it knew my every move.

The only thing I could do was run.

I ran as fast as I could, but it was always one step behind me.

"dude, where is kenny?"

It repeated over and over again, until it finally caught up to me.

And then everything went black.

The moment I woke up, I knew something was wrong.

I was in a dark room, and I couldn't move.

I tried to scream, but no sound would come out.

 Suddenly, the lights came on, and I saw the faceless figure standing in front of me.

"dude, where is kenny?"

It asked again, its voice grating like nails on a chalkboard.

And I didn't know if I was going to die, but that med it worse.

It knew my every fear, and it was going to use them against me.

"dude, where is kenny?"

It asked again and again, until I finally broke. I screamed.   
 "WHO IS KENNY??"

And then it laughed, a cold, cruel laugh that sent chills down my spine. "dude, you are."
