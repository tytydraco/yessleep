[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i0ll4a/i_have_been_in_this_corn_maze_for_so_long_part_1/)

We rested as much as we could at the rest stop. We had been traveling non-stop for roughly two days by that point. 

We were too rattled to truly sleep though, so after a relatively short time, we exhaustedly rallied together and continued our journey. 

“We have a target now.” I spoke as we gathered at the narrow path back into the gently waving golden rows. 

“The farmhouse.” Aubrey agreed.

“Do we even want to go where they told us to go?” Brad questioned. 

“What other choice do we have? It’s just endless corn everywhere else?” I shrugged. 

Our exhausted group reentered the maze. 

Just like last time, things escalated almost immediately.

We began to see red splatters all over the corn casting the maze in a more gruesome light. The plants themselves became more ragged. Just after the first fork, we saw dripping red ribbons draped over the path. 

Darius reached out to touch one. 

“Those aren’t prop guts.” He observed.

That wasn’t a surprise to us anymore.

The path became darker and grimmer. Flaps of skin and totems of bone decorated the walls of the maze. It took me a while to realize that it was literally becoming darker. The sun was setting.

Did time move after each rest? 

Exhaustion, pain, and hopelessness weighed heavy on us. Darius’ ankle wasn’t broken, but it still clearly hurt. None of us had truly slept for days, however strange and ephemeral those days may have been, and we had been surviving on sparse water and granola bars. 

Progress slowed to a crawl. None of us were sure if it mattered though. Did our physical speed through an impossible space affect our real progress? We were too afraid to find out not to do our best, but our best was no longer very much at all. 

Once again, minutes turned into hours with the maze only throwing minor strangeness at us. 

It was only a matter of time though. 

We heard a rustling in the corn, a sound that was louder and lasting longer than usual coming from both sides of us. We could see figures moving among the rows, but there was nothing we could do about it. 

Eventually, they came onto the path. Four scarecrows, each holding sickles, emerged around thirty feet back. They soundlessly marched towards us. 

“Move.” I entreated the others.

We tried to hustle. All of us were far too exhausted to actually run and the idea of fighting would be absurd by that point, but the scarecrows were only slowly walking themselves. Even still, we put little distance between us and our pursuers, and it was only a matter of time until someone collapsed from exhaustion. We blindly pushed past a turn. 

“Hey.” Brad stopped and halted us after turning back. 

Our pursuers had never made the turn. We were alone again. 

We sat down, too exhausted to keep pushing. 

“So, what brought you guys here out here?” I spoke up after taking a few moments to catch my breath. I figured that it was going to take a bit before we got moving again. 

“Just looking for something cool to do on Halloween.” Brad shrugged. 

“Maybe impress some girls.” Darius added. 

“So you guys came together?” I had guessed but never confirmed that fact. 

“Sort of.” Brad shrugged. “We aren’t close, we both go to Michigan State, saw the flier at the same time, and just decided to go for it.” 

“Michigan? Are you visiting family or something?” My heart stopped. It shouldn’t have been surprising by then, but yet another fact was terribly wrong. 

“What do you mean? It’s just an hour out.” Both of them looked confused. 

“Yeah.” I chuckled. “It was just an hour out from me too… in Virginia.” 

“What the fuck…” Darius shook his head in frustration.

“Where are you from?” Brad questioned Aubrey. 

“Socal.” She muttered. “This was halfway to Orange County.” 

“So this place—where we are—isn’t even real.” Brad was almost shouting, his voice tinged with anger. 

“I’m guessing everyone’s drive took a bit longer than your phone predicted?” I thought back to the only slightly odd part of the mostly normal drive. 

They all nodded after some thought. 

On the way here, we left our world and arrived somewhere else. 

“Do you think we can get out of here?” Aubrey asked.

“I don’t know.” I admitted. 

“How could we know?” Brian scoffed. “We don’t know where we are, when we are, or how this is happening even.” 

“We know other people are in here, and we know those flyers, and all the people who saw them really exist. If people outside know, and have a chance of finding us, there’s hope.” I reaffirmed. “Until then, we just need to survive, and see if this will let us out.” 

Obviously I wasn’t sure about anything I was saying. It didn’t matter though. We needed something to cling to in order to keep moving forward. 

Eventually, we resumed our endless march. The sun continued to set at the strange pace this place allowed, eventually immersing the path in darkness. Once it was fully night time though, what looked to be torch or bonfire flames began to appear in the distance of the cornfield, casting eerie flickering orange light across our path at intervals. 

The next time we crossed and safely avoided a trap, Brad wordlessly acted by unburying the stake and chain that held the trap in place and dragging the whole unit along. We looked at him strangely, but no one spoke of it, I think all of us feared that to do so would draw it to the attention of the maze.

We dragged our bodies through countless miserable hours until we next heard rustling in the corn. Brad eyed it cautiously while trying not to betray his intentions. He carefully matched the pace of the sound, drawing ever so slightly closer to the wall of the maze with each step.

Then, he swung the chain of the trap, hurling the dangerous apparatus into the field. We all heard a thud and the loud snap of it shutting on something. Darius wasted no time on helping Brad to draw back the chain, dragging in whatever it had caught. It looked like Brad’s plan had worked as a hempen bundle came into view with the trap snapped shut over its head. 

Brad opened the trap while Darius pulled at the costume. Within moments they had one of our opponents disassembled. 

“What in the ever-loving fuck?” Brad looked furiously at his prize. 

The costume was emptied out across the ground. It was full of straw. There was no body, no blood. Only straw.

“Nothing here is real.” Darius shook his head in disgust. “It’s all some sick game.” 

“Yeah.” Brad nodded. “Yeah, it is all fake. Come on, help me here.” Brad started working on the trap. Darius and I moved to help him out as he proceeded to disconnect the chain from the main body of the trap. 

“You planning to fight them?” I asked. 

“Well, Scarecrow’s got no brains. Shouldn’t be that hard.” He tried to make light of the situation. 

I didn’t think Wizard of Oz logic was going to save us, but I also had little reason to argue against his choice. I had no ideas of my own. 

As we continued our journey, the corn became ever bloodier and the grim decorations more gruesome and frequent. The darkness started to feel like a mercy, sparing us having to look at the worst of it. At the same time, it was unnerving having so little ability to see what lurked in the corn around us. 

“Did you see that?” Aubrey nervously pointed into the field. 

All three of us shook our heads no. 

“Something is creeping around in the corn.” She insisted, her weary face more fearful than normal. 

“We’ll keep an eye out.” I offered. 

And we did. The strange part was that we heard nothing, whereas the earlier scarecrow encounters had clearly purposefully made the sinister sound of rustling in the corn. As much as I was willing to believe anything in that place, I wondered if Aubrey had just seen the dancing shadows cast by the firelight in the field. 

My uncertainty only continued as I began to see flashes of something. Unnatural shadows seemed to block the light, moving across the field in odd ways. Still, I couldn’t see anything concrete, or hear anything at all. 

This nervous search continued for what must have been over an hour until eventually we looked behind us and it was just there, in the middle of the path. 

The creature seemed to be what would happen if you imagined what a predator adapted uniquely to a cornfield might be. It was a ridiculous and unnatural monster. Its body was only around six inches wide, slim enough to walk the rows, but over nine feet long. It walked on all fours, its enormous gangly limbs pushing the creature’s trunk just up to the height of the corn. As for what it looked like, it was roughly humanoid in shape, just freakishly stretched out and crawling on all fours, and with skin the yellowed colour of corn husk. Finally, the long, almost horse-like head had an enormous and grossly distended jaw. 

“Run!” 

This thing managed to push our adrenaline levels in a way that the scarecrows had not. We all battered down the path driven by primal fear. The creature could have overtaken us in seconds based on appearances. However, it became clear that it was more used to slinking stealthily among the rows than using its massive limbs to actually pursue prey. So that wretched loping monster closed with us only slowly. 

We all rushed for the first turn, hopeful that it would disappear as mysteriously as our first pursuers, but we had no such luck. That terribly long body twisted around the corner like a twig being stretched to its limit and continued the chase unfazed. 

The abomination was terrifyingly close to us when another flock of ravens came shrieking out of the corn. We batted our way through feathered obsidian bodies in our panicked bid to keep our distance from the silent creature of the corn. 

We were the only ones to emerge from the flock. None of us could pretend to be shocked. 

It was entirely apparent that the maze was still toying with us. We couldn’t even raise the energy to talk about it that time. We just continued to shuffle down the rows. By that point every bit as dead inside and out as the viscera decorating the corn. 

We marched until we collapsed, and then we slept right in the maze. Any sense of time had been lost days—weeks?—ago. We were too afraid to start our phones for even a moment for fear of running down what spark of power might remain if we should need it. 

We rose under the never-ending night and trod the equally endless rows again. The viscera became thicker to the point that no unstained corn remained. Curiously, the fires in the field grew more frequent too, so that our eternal march actually became brighter, if under a flickering and uncertain light. 

It was those flickering shadows that first foretold the coming of another gang of scarecrows. Tall figures blocked the light that had been flickering onto the path for half a minute before three canvas-clad figures emerged. 

“Oh no. So scary.” Brad spoke in a sarcastic monotone without stopping walking forward. “We have to run from the spooky sickle-wielding scarecrows.”

The distance between them closed quickly. The rest of us held a few feet farther back. The centermost scarecrow dramatically lifted its sickle. Brad needed no such drama. He just punched the scarecrow in the face with his chain-wrapped hand. 

Its canvas head tumbled off, nothing more than a straw-filled bag lying on the ground. The scarecrow on the left dropped its threatening pose and instead waggled the finger of its left hand in a comical “naughty, naughty” gesture. 

Darius and I were ready to rush them if they tried to overwhelm Brad.

“Oh. Is that against the rules? Sorry, I guess you’ll have to kick us out.” He smirked at the two remaining opponents. 

Brad raised his fist to strike the next one, only to be abruptly and brutally interrupted. 

The predator that stalked us from the rows earlier lunged out from the corn, snatching Brad in one grossly stretched arm and disappearing into the corn as instantly as it appeared. The two remaining scarecrows followed. 

“What the fuck?!” Darius started to run into the field, but I grabbed him. 

“Trying to chase them in there won’t help anything.” I said.

“Well then what do we do?! They’re killing us now!” He demanded to know, his features twisted with rage.

“If you want to fight, then at least wait until they’re on the path again, and prepare to fight that thing. My plan though? Not provoking them and reaching that damn house. They aren’t even really people.” I picked up the fallen straw-filled mask to demonstrate. “I don’t think we can fight them.”

“We aren’t in a real time. We aren’t in a real place. We’re being killed off by monsters.” Aubrey spoke up again. “Why are we even trying to stay alive?” She moaned. 

“Because I don’t want to die.” I admitted. 

There was nothing more to be said. Although, Darius did grab the fallen scarecrow’s sickle. We trudged back into the flickering darkness, now three of us. 

Our never-ending march was even gloomier than before. The group was fractured and each of us kept to ourselves. We incessantly glanced around the field in paranoia. The dangers of the maze felt more real, more immediate than they ever had. 

Enormous shadows began to flit across the field in front of us at seemingly random intervals. Sometimes, a fire in the field would go out, as if swallowed by an unseen terror.

Worse than the fear though was the hunger and thirst. We had been traveling what had undoubtedly been weeks by that point on painstakingly rationed sips of a single bottle of water and one granola bar. We had long ago started trying to alleviate the hunger by gnawing on loose kernels of corn. It wouldn’t be long until we simply could not push any farther. 

We found ourselves stuck on a very long straight path. It seemed to go on forever until finally widening out. Just as it became three times as wide as the paths ordinarily were we saw something ahead. 

Another string of entrails dangled across the path. From this one hung a truly grotesque ornament: four human heads. 

The heads of the other four who entered the maze with us. 

We stopped and stared for a moment. Was it real? Did it matter? 

“Still trying to scare us?” Darius shouted into the fields. “Fuck this.” 

Darius reached up and cut down the strand holding the heads with the sickle he had kept earlier. 

I thought that would be the end of it, but he then grabbed a clump of corn plants and hacked them down with the blade. 

“I’m not scared! I make my own path!” He continued to carve his way into the field. 

“What are you doing?” I questioned.

“Making my own way out of here.” His tone was one of determination. 

Darius pushed forward into the corner, hacking a new path into the field. He made it only a foot deeper in before a cluster of arms grabbed him. 

“Get the hell off!” He began wrestling and slashing at the canvas arms. 

I did reach out to help him, even knowing it was pointless. It was impossible to tell apart how many of the creatures of the field were reaching through and clutching him, every time an arm was pulled off another replaced it. In only moments, Darius was dragged into the corn.

“No!” I screamed at the rustling gaps of broken corn, the only sign that remained that Darius had ever been there. 

I stared in horror, for how long I don’t know. It was just two of us left in this nightmare. 

Just as when Brad was taken, there was nothing more to do than crawl onward. Aubrey had fallen completely silent by this point. I suppose I had to. My throat was parched to the point of agony, and what would I say anyway? By that point, it truly was just cowardice keeping me walking the maze. I couldn’t pretend to have any hope of seeing the world outside that cornfield again. 

It was no surprise to me when, days later, after the last droplets of our water were long gone and our bodies barely able to shuffle, Aubrey simply stopped walking. 

“I’m tired.” She hoarsely spoke for the first time in days. “I think I’m done with this maze. I’m going to cut to the road.” 

For a moment, I thought about arguing. But why? There was no better way out of there. 

“Good luck.” I rasped.

“Thanks.” 

She walked into the corn, dazed, but more steady on her feet than she had been in days. I heard faint rustling, and nothing more. 

After lying down and passing between feverish delusions and sleep, I crawled forward down the path. 

Towering monsters and cackling scarecrows danced in the light of the flickering fires, yet nothing touched me. 

“Three rules.” I muttered to myself. 

“Don’t touch the performers.” I remembered Brad striking the scarecrow.

“Don’t damage the props.” Darius broke the jump scare prop before his foot was caught in the trap, then tore apart the maze.

“Don’t leave the path.” Aubrey wandered into the corn, although the rule violation was moot by then.

I no longer feared the horrors that taunted me, only the endlessness of the nightmare world itself.

I won’t even try to guess for how long I stumbled unthinking and unseeing down the paths. Only that my eventual awakening came when I tripped over something. 

I laid down and tried to actually see what was in the darkness for the first time in a very long time. 

It was another table, with another bottle of water, and another granola bar.

I drank the contents of the bottle in a single gulp, not caring to ration it. I wouldn’t live through another cycle of this anyway. I ate half of the bar but felt too ill to finish the rest. Then, I passed out again. 

I woke up, still in the darkness of course. It took me some time to adjust enough to take in what was around me. At first, it just looked like a black void. Eventually, though, I managed to distinguish the shapes in the darkness. 

It was the farmhouse. I had left the corn maze.
