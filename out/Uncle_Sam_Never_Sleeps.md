The boy fourteen, and soon to be forever marked sat quietly as the road carried him forward. It was a road paved in comfort, the kind granted by birth, but one that would soon betray him. A road that had already broken many souls and left them scattered along its unseen edges.Through the glass, automobiles drifted past in flashes of steel and light, while tall oak trees stretched high into the skyline. His pupils wandered aimlessly, trying to follow the blur of shifting scenery, never settling, as though searching for something they would never find.His mind circled back to his parents, their lessons, their warmth, their world. That was the only truth he knew. Beyond them lay a mystery, a silence he had never dared to question. And yet the road pulled him deeper, toward a house he had never seen, toward an uncle he had never known.The oaks kept streaming past, their shadows dragging behind until the sun itself sank into the horizon. The forest grew thin and wiry, animals peering out from its darkened edge, their eyes glowing faint against the oncoming night.

The boy’s eyelids grew heavy. Slow. Reluctant. His body slackened as the dark closed in, and finally, in silence, his eyes shut for a few fragile seconds.Then the boy’s parents took a sharp turn. The road narrowed, thinning into a single, lonely path: no lanes, no passing, no choice but forward. It felt as if it existed only for them, leading them where it wanted, not where they chose.

And then headlights. A tow truck burst into view, barreling straight toward them. It moved with urgency, a beast on wheels, and when it struck, it was like jaws snapping shut. Metal shrieked. Their car’s teeth and jaw caved inward with the crash.

The boy’s eyes shot open. Adrenaline surged like fire through his veins.

Beside him, his father gripped the wheel, his face drenched in sweat. His foot slammed the pedal, shoving the car into reverse, tires screeching against the asphalt. His voice cracked out, raw and desperate, filling the car with terror.

“Oh shit oh shit NO! PLEASE NO, PLEASE, NO!”

The mother and son were frozen, their breaths coming in sharp, shallow gasps. There were no words, only the heavy weight of fear and sorrow pressing down on them.

The tow truck slammed again and again into the car, each impact jarring their bodies and rattling their bones. Slowly, inevitably, the vehicle teetered on the edge of a steep cliff. The world outside the windows became a dark, yawning abyss, swallowing everything whole.The boy felt the darkness press in from all sides. His mind emptied; there were no thoughts, only the waiting. Waiting for something to happen, or perhaps waiting for nothing to happen ever again. Time stretched, infinite and hollow, as the night held them suspended between terror and oblivion.

The boy awoke to a blinding light, searing against his reddish pupils. He lifted a trembling hand to shield his eyes and tilted his head carefully, every movement slow, deliberate. His neck protested, stiff and sore, as he shifted his heavy skull to the left.

Before him stretched a wall too white, almost plastic in its brightness, sterile and alien.

“He’s awake!” someone shouted, their voice sharp and urgent, echoing off the cold walls.

A nurse and two doctors stared at the boy, unsure what to say. He drew in deep, shuddering breaths, each one rattling through his chest, while the staff tried to steady themselves.

“Where are my parents?” His voice was gravelly, strained, almost breaking into a shout. He pressed a fist to his mouth, coughing harshly, the sound wet and wrenching, before he turned back to them.

“Where the fuck are my parents?!” he shouted again, the gravel of his voice compressed deep into his lungs. His palms pressed into the hospital bed, lifting his torso as his heavy skull bobbed with the effort.

“Excuse me where THE FUCK are my parents?!”

“Sir, calm down,” the nurse said, her voice trembling. The doctor and the second nurse took a cautious step back, uncertain how to contain the boy’s rising panic.

The boy drew in huge, shuddering gasps of air, trying to swallow, trying to steady himself, trying in vain to grasp the truth of what had happened.

“Just take a seat,” the doctor said gently.

Slowly, mechanically, the boy sank into the small chair tucked into the corner of the hospital bed.

“Your parents… tragically… passed away. A reckless driver,” the doctor continued, his words cautious yet firm.

The boy’s eyes seemed to dissolve, pupils heavy and wet, though not a single tear fell. Inside, a storm raged flooding, twisting, pounding against the walls of his skull. He stared down at the pale blue tiles beneath him, frozen in a silence so thick it felt eternal.

“What happened to the reckless driver? Where is he?” The boy’s voice, though low, carried the weight of stone, unwavering.

“The police are searching for him. They will find him,” the doctor replied.

The boy drew a deep, trembling breath, his chest rising and falling like waves.

“Who will… um… who will look after me?”

“Your uncle is waiting in the lobby,” the doctor said.

The nurse guided the boy down the sterile hallways to the lobby. He still wore his hospital gown, the fabric hanging loosely around him, a pale ghost among the pale tiles. The hospital itself felt drained of life walls and floors coated in a muted, lifeless white, the light harsh and unfeeling.

Silence clung to every corner, heavy and suffocating, as if the building itself remembered the broken, the lost, and the dead who had passed through its halls. It was a somber, invisible weight pressing down on the boy’s shoulders, a quiet song of despair and emptiness that seemed to follow him with every step.

Then he saw him.

Uncle Sam’s posture was rigid, his spine unnaturally straight, his body radiating a silent authority. One foot tapped lightly, almost impatiently, against the pale hospital tiles.The nurse guided the boy toward him, then stepped back, leaving the two alone in the cavernous lobby. Uncle Sam towered above the small crowd, nearly seven feet tall. He was broad and imposing, but not overweight his frame was all hard lines and controlled strength. A buttoned black coat hung over black sweatpants, and his scalp was shaved clean, a black mustache sharp against his pale skin.Silence stretched between them like a taut wire. Then, without a word, Uncle Sam turned and gestured for the boy to follow. His footsteps fell heavy against the tiles, each one echoing like a drumbeat.

They emerged into the hospital parking lot. The asphalt gleamed darkly in the rain, slick and reflective under the dim lights, each blackened puddle shimmering like shattered glass. The lot was empty, vast, and silent an eerie stage for the encounter to come.

Uncle Sam leaned against the red truck, his massive frame pressing into the weathered metal. The truck was caked in dirt and grime, the interior layered with rust and the lingering scent of neglect. With a deliberate motion, he reached into his pocket, produced a cigarette, and placed it between his lips.The flame of his lighter flared, cupped in his large hand, casting a brief, flickering glow that pierced the black fog of the parking lot. The small spark danced in the darkness, reflecting off the wet asphalt like a dying star.

“Get in the front, kid,” Uncle Sam said, his voice low, calm, but carrying an unmistakable edge.

Rain tore down from the sky, pounding against Uncle Sam’s windshield like the tears of some colossal, unseen infant, its sorrowful gaze fixed on the dark abyss below. The wipers swept back and forth in relentless rhythm, slicing through the sheets of water while the yellow glow of the truck’s headlights pierced the gloom.Uncle Sam’s eyes were sharp, predatory, scanning the blackened world beyond the glass. His large hands gripped the battered steering wheel with practiced control, and his spine hunched slightly, leaning forward as if the darkness itself demanded his vigilance.

The boy could not sleep. His wide, unblinking eyes traced the motion outside the skeletal, elongated spruce trees rushing past in streaks of shadow. For a moment, the forest seemed alive, its long, skinny trunks staring with empty, unseeing pupils as the red truck carved its way through the storm.

Hours passed. Deep into the night, neither of them slept. The paved road had long since disappeared, replaced by a narrow, winding dirt path that led through a forest so dense it seemed untouched by man. No houses, no lights, no signs of civilization appeared for what felt like endless hours.

Finally, Uncle Sam brought the red, rusted truck to a halt beside his cabin. The engine sputtered and died, leaving only the soft rustle of the wind through the trees and the distant drip of rain from the leaves.Uncle Sam flicked the last remnants of his cigarette into the damp grass. His heavy boot crushed it underfoot, leaving nothing behind but a scattering of ash and a quiet sense of finality.

The boy claimed the smallest bedroom in the cabin, leaving Uncle Sam to occupy the spaces below. Dawn crept over the horizon, the orange sun spilling its light through the narrow window and casting long, sharp shadows across the boy’s unrested face. He had not slept; the weight of the previous night pressed heavy on his eyelids.Swinging his legs over the edge of the bed, he let his feet touch the worn wooden floor, then turned toward the closet. Shirts and pants hung neatly from their hangers, each article of clothing staring back at him like silent witnesses. He examined them closely every piece a men’s small, fitting him perfectly, yet carrying the unmistakable scent of a life lived elsewhere, a life he was now forced to step into.

Now dressed, the boy carefully made his way downstairs, each step pressing into the spruce wood planks that groaned under the weight of his bare feet. The living room was stark, almost oppressive: a worn sofa, a lone window, and a large Confederate flag mounted firmly on the wooden wall. Its presence sent a sour, sinking feeling curling into the pit of his [stomach.No](http://stomach.no/) technology cluttered the room; the space felt frozen in another era. The square windows scattered across the walls offered fractured glimpses of the outside world, letting in slivers of pale morning light. The boy hesitated before settling onto the sofa, his gaze inevitably drawn back to the flag.

Through one of the windows, he caught sight of Uncle Sam. Shirtless and glistening with sweat, the man’s muscles flexed rhythmically as he lifted weights. The early sun caught the droplets on his skin, turning them into small, burning embers of orange light. The boy felt a subtle shiver crawl up his spine, equal parts awe, fear, and unease.

Later, they sat at the table eating cereal in near silence. Uncle Sam’s crunches were loud and deliberate, each turn of the spoon a sharp punctuation in the quiet room. The boy’s bites were delicate, tentative almost fragile his movements careful as if the act of eating itself demanded precision.

“What do you think of the place?” Uncle Sam asked, his voice calm but carrying a weight that made the boy shift slightly in his seat.

“It’s… alright,” the boy muttered. “Do you have a TV or a computer or something?”

“Hell no.”

“Why not?”

Uncle Sam’s eyes scanned him carefully. “Anything stick out to you?”

The boy’s gaze fell to his empty bowl for a long moment before he lifted his head, meeting Uncle Sam’s stare. His eyes were wide and round, nearly protruding, held tightly by heavy eyelids that could barely contain them. The intensity of his gaze seemed to anchor him to the chair.

“Your flag,” the boy said finally, voice low.

“Got a problem with that?” Uncle Sam snapped, his tone sharp.

“Yeah. I do.”

Uncle Sam shifted a soggy clump of cereal with his spoon, bringing it to his mouth slowly, deliberately, all while keeping his eyes locked onto the boy’s. The silence stretched, taut as a wire, each bite a quiet challenge in the space between them.

THUD!

The boy collapsed onto the spruce floorboards, a burning red bruise blossoming across his cheek. Uncle Sam rose to his full height, towering like a predator in the small room, his muscular frame almost brushing the ceiling.

“I’m gonna make a fucking man out of you, boy,” he growled, voice low and threatening.

Stars erupted in the boy’s vision, and a high-pitched ringing stabbed at the hollows of his ears, sharp enough to feel like it was drilling into his skull. Pain radiated through his head as he pushed himself upright, hands clawing at his hair, pulling it back as if to staunch the invisible flood of red-hot agony in his brain.The door upstairs slammed shut with a deafening finality, echoing through the room, but the boy barely registered it. His mind was a storm, nails raking across the wrinkles of his thoughts, scratching, digging, tearing, leaving his terror raw and unrelenting. Every heartbeat was a hammer; every breath a jagged blade cutting through his chest.

The boy sank onto the edge of his bed, pressing his forehead against the cool glass of the window. Outside, the sun bled slowly into the horizon, dragging long shadows across the world as it sank lower and lower. Tears carved swift, glistening trails down his face, streaks of sorrow that seemed to burn as they fell. His heart hammered violently, each beat thudding into his stomach, twisting with grief and anger. It ached for the parents he had lost, a hollow, unfillable ache that clawed at every corner of him. He longed desperately for something, anyone, to fill the void that now defined his world.

Hours passed, though time felt suspended, stretched thin like a taut wire over the empty room. His tears slowly dried, leaving his skin slick and tight, like cracked earth beneath a merciless sun. Outside, the dying light of the day seeped into the clouds, painting them in distant, unreachable colors, a quiet reminder of a world moving on without him.

Thump… thump… A piercing, aching creak ran through the floorboards. The boy’s head jerked toward the sound, and there, beneath his door, he saw the polished leather boots of Uncle Sam.

The door swung open with a deliberate force. Sam stepped inside, a rifle dangling loosely at his heel, his eyes locking onto the boy’s with a predator’s focus. The boy felt his heart surge and hammer against his ribs, each beat a frantic plea to flee but there was nowhere to run.
