2 years ago I lost my eyes. I lost my wife. I lost my son. I lost my life. 2 years ago an 'entity'  took everything from me seeing as it took my eyes I'm currently using voice commands to write this even if I don't need to it helps me feel as normal as I can ever since that day.

2 years ago I was at work just like normal everything was looking up as of usual I got promoted, our son turned 10, and my wife beat covid after 2 long months we bought a new and better house and managed to get out son into the top school in the country but as I got home my wife as in the bed waiting for me but she was, how do I say this "different"  it was her body but it wasn't her I could ***hear it***.

I have always had good ears but I wish i dint because after 'it' realized it dint have me fooled it warped everything it appeared to be the same but everything sounded off it looked at me with an impossibly neutral stare it only spoke 4 words "your debt is due" these words I my ears bleed even thought to the ordinary person it was impossibly quiet to me it was like blasting a flashbang next to my ear.

&#x200B;

then it broke the shell it was using or instead it broke the *person it was using,* the sheer magnitude of it was impressive even if it took my life I cannot deny it was beyond beauty the word beauty couldn't begin to describe the entity after this display of power, magnificence, dominance? who knows but it sent me back to my world whatever that world it had us in sounded different but to be back to familiar sounds was nice.

but now my eyes bled tears of gold it never stops and I have given up on the prospect of ever seeing again the upside is my hearing has been enhanced but as I am now it made matter it was more of a curse seeing as I could see but not by normal means it is a form of echolocation but its horror I can hear every air molecule rubbing against its counterpart.

I could hear my distant family in India snoring I could hear my brother in England eating won't could hear my sister breathing in the Philippines but another upside i was 'enlightened' after i saw the being I saw every possible outcome  if i had seen everything I'm sure I would go insane but the knowledge of every outcome ever is helpful  but i can see every outcome everywhere and at any time i can never get a clear grasp of that being I I hear it when   try to locate it or use my knowledge to see the outcome of it Isomehow manages to hide from my ears and steal my knowledge of its outcome.

&#x200B;

but every second of every day of every month of every year i kept trying to get my revenge  but it made sense seeing as I only probably only had a fraction of its knowledge since even if it felt like hours no days i was staring at it it was but a mear  fraction of a second but   managed to become similar but,

&#x200B;

it hurt greatly IIevery timeIIIhad to shed my human form no shed my physical form with this advancement i became omnipresent I managed to travel through time with ease it was terrifying to me now how easily i could distort reality  but in the end, I managed to track it and erase it with a difficult fight I erased it from existence it did not exist in any reality nor any timeline but in this battle to heal i had to take back my inferior physical form but in the endI i decided to stay in my inferior form.

&#x200B;

as i completed my goal I no longer need the monstrous power my non-physical form granted III III,Iof I gave up most of my 'godly' abilities seeing as I did not want or need them now I lay in a cabin in the woods I dare not say were due to fear of humanity marching up to my small cabin for power or answers to humanities questions but I'm telling this to you just to vent seeing as these newly renewed emotions are refreshing.

my child and wife are now dead seeing as they were erased before due to the entity not needing them anymore  but I brought their memory and existence back in honor of them but oh how bad I wanted to bring them back to live in my hut with me and to taste my wife breakfast again but I will honor their 'death'
