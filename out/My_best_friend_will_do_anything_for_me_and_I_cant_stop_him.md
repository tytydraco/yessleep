I’ll never forget the day I met Alix.

It’s not every day you meet someone who’ll change the entire course of your life right down to the cellular level… but I’m getting ahead of myself. I don’t need to rush the story.

These days, I quite literally have all the time in the world.

When Alix and I met, it was my first day at a new school in a new neighborhood: my family had moved in just before the semester started, and I, a scrawny first-grader with no confidence, was completely adrift in a strange place where everyone in my class seemed bigger than me. No bullies had targeted me yet, but that was only because I was so low on the food chain that they hadn't even noticed me, and the same went for everyone else in class: they were too busy chatting about the big truck crash that had happened just outside school that morning.

I must’ve looked like I was about to start crying, because the teacher, Mrs Fuller, came to my rescue.

“Alix? Alix Smythe? Could you be a lamb and look after Daniel?” she asked distractedly. “My hands are a little full right now and I need someone who can be a friend to our new student. Take good care of him, won’t you?

Alix was a head taller than everyone in the class, with eyes so dark they seemed almost black, an eerily permanent smile, and an overall look I can only describe as "androgynous." A few of the snottier kids in class had picked on him for it, even cheekily asking about his pronouns, but Alix had only smiled, listening politely as the smartass remarks sailed past him without stirring so much as a ripple.

But then he heard Mrs Fuller’s orders, and suddenly Alix seemed to come alive for the first time in the entire day. Snapping to attention, Alix threw an arm over my shoulder and said, “Glad to meet you, Daniel! I’m Alix.”

From then on, Alix was always there to help me.

If I needed help with my bag and textbooks between classrooms, Alix would carry them for me. If there was something in a lesson I’d missed, Alix wrote everything down. If I got bored between lessons, Alix would clown around, coaxing laughter with his mimicries of teachers and kids. If I was ever scared to brave the packed cafeteria, Alix would clear the way for me, somehow parting the crowds like Moses. If the first-day fears got too much for me, Alix offered his shoulder for me to cry on and always gave the best hugs. And when the bullies finally took notice, Alix was there to shield me.

But at the end of my first day, as Alix and I hurtled out through the school gates, I saw that alongside the usual army of parents there to pick up their kids, there were three men in nondescript grey suits and green ties standing on the edge of the parking lot.

All three stood out like sore thumbs, but they didn’t stick around to answer questions: as soon as they saw Alix, one of the men marched up, grabbed him by the shoulder, whispered a few words in his ear, and escorted him away before any of the other parents could react.

By the time the shock wore off, the other kids were already whispering that we’d never see Alix ever again.

And yet, when I went to bed that evening, Alix was waiting for me in my bedroom, leaning casually against the wall, none the worse for wear and still smiling, black eyes glittering like onyx.

“How did you get here?” I asked. “Who were those men who grabbed you? How did you get away from them?”

But Alix only shrugged. “I was told to look after you, and here I am,” he said, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.

“But don’t you have a home to go to? Don’t you have a mom and dad who’ll be missing you?”

Alix shook his head. “They’re all in the ground,” he said. “Besides, I was told to look after you. I belong with you.”

Had I been a little older, that would probably have been a red flag, but at the time, it simply didn’t click that there was anything weird about what Alix had said. Instead, I blurted, “But I can’t just keep you here! What if Mom asks questions?”

“She won’t know I’m here. I’ll hide here with you until it’s time for school.”

“Well… what if those guys in suits come after you again?”

Alix just smiled. “They won’t find me.”

And then, without warning, he *changed*: his entire body shifted and flattened against the wall behind him, skin turning pale and sprouting huge fissures to blend in with the cracked plaster, until his face simply vanished into the cheap brickwork. In a matter of seconds, he was perfectly disguised as just another section of the wall.

Then, with another ripple of moment, he was a chair leaning against the wall. Then over the next few seconds of changing, he was every student and teacher he'd met that day.

Then they were me.

“I can there for you without anyone knowing about it,” said Alix, as he slowly returned to normal. “I can be whatever you need me to be.”

They smiled again, wider than ever, until it seemed to spread across every inch of his face.

If only I’d noticed that the smile didn’t reach his eyes.

If only I’d noticed how *pained* that smile looked.

Of course, I asked questions about my new friend, but Alix rarely had the answers.

When I asked how old he was, he'd just say “old.”

When I asked where his parents were, all he'd say was “in the ground.”

When I asked where he was from, he'd only say, “Number 13.”

He couldn’t tell me anything about what he really was, how he could shapeshift, who the men in suits were, and why it was so important to look after me. As far as I could tell, he didn’t know and didn’t care.

And eventually, I didn’t either. And once I realized how good my life could be with a shapeshifting best friend, I just accepted it.

In other words, I learned to ignore the red flags.

So, Alix followed me to school next day, disguised as my backpack, and through the day, he kept me safe and contented in one disguise or another.

Meanwhile, the bullies spent the day tripping over things, slipping in puddles, accidentally stabbing themselves with pencils, and sometimes even finding worms in their sandwiches.

And when I went home to a house that was always cold, my parents were always out late, and the fridge was always empty, Alix was there to make things better. He stole food for me, became a blanket to keep me warm, and if I was really miserable, he could shapeshift into my mother and act as if she actually cared.

While I slept, he sat in the dark on the other side of the room, watching. If Mom or Dad were around, Alix took the form of any one of my toys, perfectly disguised just in case they decided to pay a rare visit.

At all other times, Alix was Alix, sitting in a chair across from my bed, black eyes fixed on me, his mouth frozen in a smile, teeth gleaming in the moonlight.

He never slept. He only watched, waiting to fulfil another need.

And so, my life with Alix went on.

Every day, whether he was disguised as a bird in the sky, a stray dog, a substitute teacher, or even the desk in front of me, he made sure I was happy and safe, and every day, he made sure that anyone who tried to hurt me suffered.

Sad thing was, I didn’t realize how extreme things could get until Richie Payne stole my lunch money and turned up in a wheelchair the next day, too afraid to even look me in the eye.

Naturally, I asked why Alix had decided it was a good idea to shatter Riche’s kneecaps over a grand total of five dollars, but Alix would not be moved.

“He hurt you,” he said. “I hurt him back. Now he knows better.”

“But you can’t just go around hurting people like that,” I protested.

“Why not? It’s the only way they’ll be better.”

Alix smiled that same mirthless, tortured-looking smile.

“Richie’s *better* now,” he said. “He’ll never hurt you again. He’s out of your way.”

And nothing I said could dissuade him, not even when I tried to end our friendship. My screamed temper-tantrum was ignored, as were my tears, my threats of somehow finding the men in the suits and making sure Alix was taken away for good this time, and even my order to leave and never come back.

Sure, Alix was devoted to me, would give his life to protect me if that was what it took, but he wasn't my servant or my slave, and he didn’t take orders from me.

*H*e set the rules, and the first and foremost one was that when it came to keeping me safe and happy, nothing was forbidden.

Whenever he met a kid who singled me out for abuse, he did everything he could to make the luckless bully pay, in whatever form was suited to the job. And as the years went on, the same went for everyone who mistreated me in any way... or looked like they *might* mistreat me.

Librarians who told me to be quiet were plagued with phantom screams all day. Doctors who asked me to wait were forced to see me first by mystery assailants that they could never identify to the police. Gym teachers who’d been hard on me suddenly found their cars stolen. Rivals in competitions were unexpectedly sabotaged – from the sprinter who tripped up just a couple of feet from the finish line to the guitarist who had to drop out after having his hands broken in a “mugging” gone wrong. And as I began making my way through high school, girls I liked found themselves suffering plagues of bad luck until they agreed to my request for a date.

Nothing I told Alix could make him change tactics. He just didn’t understand why hurting people who didn’t like me was wrong. So, eventually, I stopped trying to convince him. Sure, I was guilty, maybe even a little scared, but the benefits were just too good to give up on.

So, little by little, I accepted his way of doing things.

I even enjoyed it.

Strange as it seems, I liked Alix. He was my best friend, after all… though truth be told, he was my *only* friend. Maybe it was inevitable, since my parents were barely around long enough to cook dinner, most of the other kids were too scared of me to be real friends, and by the time I got around to graduating from high school, most girls tended to avoid me as well, especially after what happened to the last girlfriend who’d gotten on Alix’s bad side.

So, Alix became the perfect friend for every occasion, and I do mean *every* occasion.

It still makes me laugh to know that nobody was able to identify the girl I took to my senior prom; considering how many women Alix chose to sample and mimic to get that form just right, he was very proud of himself... though if that day taught me anything, it's that things like gender and sex don't mean much to a shapeshifter. The only reason why I still call Alix "he" and "him" is out of habit.

Years went by. I got a part-time job for a little experience and money, made it through college, moved to a different state, entered the corporate world, claimed a plum starting job in a very prestigious company, and began climbing the career ladder.

 Meanwhile, Alix stole and laundered the money needed to pay my debts, got me the “materials” needed for my essays, sabotaged better-qualified rivals for jobs, took out contenders for promotion who might outdo me, and made sure I knew who best to impress on the road to success.

Sometimes, he even gave me a nice car to impress my boss with – or rather, he *became* a nice car to impress my boss with. Nobody noticed the pitch-black headlights or the teeth behind the grille.

As the fight for promotion grew fiercer, some of my more prominent rivals at work simply disappeared entirely, usually after suffering nervous breakdowns: one, Jason Beagle, managed to get himself fired and underwent a very rapid descent into alcoholism to the point of public nudity before he finally vanished.

To this day, I have no idea if Alix engineered their breakdowns or simply impersonated them and acted out the breakdowns, and I don’t know how many of those rivals were buried in shallow graves or flung into the ocean to put the finishing touches on Alix’s sabotage.

And of course, when I asked, all Alix would say was that the missing rivals were “better now,” and smile that same tormented-looking smile.

But after a severed finger with Jason Beagle’s signet ring washed up on a beach less than half an hour’s walk from my new apartment, I knew for a fact that Alix was now a murderer.

And I didn’t care.

Had it happened any earlier, I might have panicked, called the police, or maybe even tried to seek out the men in suits. Perhaps, had I been wise enough, I might have even feared that my faithful friend might one day turn on me in a fit of jealousy.

But after so many years of benefiting from Alix’s talent for subterfuge and violence, a few deaths to catapult me to the top of the pyramid were acceptable losses.

Murder was just my friend’s way of doing what was best for me, and after so many years of having the best things in life because of Alix, who was I to say no to him? With my shapeshifting best friend steering my life, there was nowhere to go but up…

Or so I thought.

In hindsight, I’d always secretly worried that something might transpire outside Alix’s control, that one day my decades-long lucky streak would finally run out, and sure enough, it happened at the tender age of thirty-five.

It started with a stubborn cough that refused to leave, a wild clenching spasm in my chest that left me doubled over for minutes on end, wheezing for breath. Then the terrible moments where I seemed to have no breath at all, where it took all my strength to force air into my lungs. Then, finally, the telltale spots of blood on my lips when I coughed.

Alix naturally got me the very best medical care, even if it meant travelling hundreds of miles away from me to threaten world-famous oncologists into taking charge of my case. But in the end, it didn’t matter how much money he stole for the treatments, nor did it matter who Alix bribed and bullied into reviewing my condition. The diagnosis remained the same.

Lung cancer, stage 4.

I was given a life expectancy of less than a year, maybe a little more with chemo. The doctors unlucky enough to meet him told Alix to help me set my affairs in order, perhaps believing that he was my spouse or lover.

Well, Alix loved me, that much was true. He loved me with an intensity and devotion that would terrify any rational mind unlucky enough to observe his excesses. And as I was to learn in the following days, that was what had been intended from the very beginning.

And that was why, when doctors recommended sending me away to a highly exclusive private clinic, Alix reacted very badly.

Going to this particular clinic would have meant being kept in strict isolation for drastic therapies that could damage my immune system, and even though Alix would have easily followed, the thought of him potentially harming me even by accident was too much for him to bear.

So, while I was signing the transfer papers, Alix added a little something extra to my IV bag. Before I had time to figure out what was going on, I was already passing out.

I awoke to find myself in unfamiliar surroundings.

The luxury apartment that I had bought with Alix’s laundered cash was gone, replaced by a vast sprawling complex of rough concrete halls, magnetically sealed doors, still-functioning generators, a mile of laboratories, and enough filing cabinets to fill the Library of Congress.

As I eventually discovered, Alix had taken me to an abandoned military research base somewhere under the deserts of Nevada. The facility had obviously been abandoned in the wake of huge battle, for the place was littered with spent casings, cratered from grenades, scorched from flame throwers, and littered with decades-old corpses.

Also, most of the doors had been welded shut from the outside, all except the one that Alix had torn open to get me down here.

But it wasn’t until I found the trio of skeletons dressed in those distinctive grey suits and green ties that I finally realized exactly where we were.

This was Alix’s home.

Research Station Number 13.

According to the various papers and video footage left around the complex, the scientists here had been experimenting on a shapeshifting creature they’d found sleeping deep underground, one of an entire species of polymorphs that hadn’t seen the light of day since the end of the Permian Period.

They'd been lucky enough to find these creatures during a period of dormancy, and though they'd only been able to claim one specimen out of untold thousands before safety issues had forced them to close their dig site, that was all they needed.

The project researchers had found a way to permanently trigger the areas of the polymorph brain relating to infatuation, conditioning the shapeshifter into a loving bodyguard to one individual at a time. By nature, it would be capable of blending in anywhere, serving as body double to anyone, killing anyone who threatened its master, and thanks to the conditioning, its absolute loyalty would be guaranteed to whoever it had been ordered to protect… except in those moments where the conditioning slipped just enough for the horror to show in the bodyguard’s smile.

And to make their ownership official, the scientists had given the new bodyguard a name.

The Brass had grand plans on making Alix a gift for the President… but unfortunately, the truck that was carrying him crashed before it could be delivered to Washington and programmed. With his handlers dead in the crash and no idea what else to do, Alix had blended in: he made his way to the school across the road, forged a few records, adjusted his default form to match the local demographics, and enrolled himself in a class while he waited to be retrieved.

And then Mrs Fuller had ordered Alix to look after me, unwittingly programming him to serve as my bodyguard from then on.

When the grey-suited handlers had arrived to return Alix to the base for reprogramming, my new bodyguard had complied… right up until his keepers let it slip that Alix wouldn’t be allowed to see me again.

That was when Alix had started killing: he'd killed the three handlers, the security guards assisting them, the marines sent in as reinforcements, the scientists who could reprogram him, and finally, the base commander, along with anyone trying to activate the self-destruct sequence. He'd even dismantled the bomb behind the self-destruct. He hadn’t stopped killing until everyone else had evacuated and Alix had the entire base to himself.

And then he'd returned to my side.

For nearly three decades, Alix had been my friend: he'd protected me, fed me, entertained me, comforted me, served my ambitions...

…and now, with the threat of losing me forever on the horizon, he'd brought me to his home to guarantee my survival on a *permanent* basis.

As soon as I figured that out, I tried to flee for the exit that Alix had unlocked, but he caught me halfway there. Before I could stop him, he'd reached out with a tendril and burrowed into my spine, pouring a liquid piece of himself into my flesh, transfusing me with his cells, altering me from the inside out.

The pain was incredible, like drowning in molten lead, my entire body contorting in pain as my skin bubbled and hissed, my bones softening and warping beneath my liquescent flesh, until even my skull seemed to implode, before I finally lost consciousness.

When I awoke, I was lying on a bed in the deserted lab, Alix smiling down at me.

"You're *better* now," he purred.

Sure enough, the cancer was gone. The terrible shortness of breath, the endless coughing, the bloody spittle, and the clawing pain in my lungs, all had been washed away by my best friend’s transfusion.

Unfortunately, that wasn't the only thing I'd lost.

I wasn’t a true shapeshifter, and probably won't be for decades, but I could tell at once that I wasn’t human anymore, and anyone who cared to look would see it in my lightless black eyes, grey-tinted skin, and long, swirling, tendril-like fingers.

Alix had cured my cancer, but he'd also made certain I’d have no choice but to stay with him forever… and given that he and the rest of his family have been alive for more than two hundred and fifty million years, that could very well be the case.

It’s been more than twenty years since that day, and I haven’t aged for any of it.

Alix regularly sneaks off to the surface to steal food and luxuries to make my stay down here more bearable, including the computer that I’m typing this confession on and the Wi-Fi connection I’m using to send it out into the world.

I’m not a prisoner. There’s nothing stopping me from leaving, except for the fact that I’d be hunted down by government agents and dissected in another laboratory. Perhaps one day, I’ll have changed enough to shapeshift and play at being human again… but I doubt I’ll ever be willing to leave.

In truth, I stay because I know it’s what I deserve.

Of all the years Alix had served me, I’d protested his atrocities for maybe *one*. I’d left a trail of corpses and broken people on my path to success. I’d given up on love, accepting dates with victims of coercion and a brainwashed slave. I’d let Alix help me cheat my way through school, through college, and all the way up the career ladder.

And I'd loved him for it.

I’d been a monster all along. Alix had just made it official, even given me an underground lair of my very own to lurk in for all eternity, complete with a fellow monster grinning at me in the darkness.

But that’s not why I’m writing this.

I’m writing this because I know that the project staff didn’t leave this base empty-handed: during Alix's rampage, someone was faxing all the documentation off-site. *Someone* out there still knows where the rest of those ancient polymorphs sleep and how to control them… and though it’s too late for me, I’m hoping that one of you can somehow stop another Alix from being created.

I don’t want them destroyed, if they even can be.

I just want them left alone, before some idiot tries to tame another one with even worse results.

After all, Alix’s worst atrocities were committed because he loved me.

Can you imagine what would have happened if he *hated* me?
