I hope this message gets out. I can’t make any phone calls and my text won't go through. I just keep getting a text failed or call failed message. I seem to have an internet connection though. It doesn’t make any sense, but it’s there. I’m in a cave somewhere between Tennessee and North Carolina. At least I think that’s where I am. To be honest I’m certain anymore. I know we found the cave system on the eastern border of Tennessee, but we have been down here on the move for so long that I have no idea where we’re at now.  
  
  You see, I was recruited by the U.S.G.S. The United States Geological Survey. Sounds like pretty boring stuff, right? That’s what I thought when they offered me the position. Turns out I was wrong, I might even be dead wrong. They recruited me for a special task force to lead a security detail. Honestly, I couldn’t understand why USGS scientists would need a security detail. It should have been a big red flag, but I was too focused on the large payout I was offered for this position. That amount of money should’ve been an even bigger red flag.  
  
  Now I’m lost in an unknown cave system and there's something down here with me. I don’t know where I am, I don’t know what it is. And I’m not even sure what I’m going to do. I’ll tell you what I do know. If I get out of this, I quit. No amount of money is worth what I’m going through, what I’ve seen. I’ll also tell you this, the government has been hiding this for Three years. Now I don’t know about you, but I don’t like being lied to. Especially when it put my life, and the lives of my men in danger. We may have volunteered to take certain risks, but this isn’t one of them.  
  
  It all started when I got a phone call offering a job. I was told that it was a one-year contract, and it paid two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. They informed me that a team of USGS scientists along with a couple of zoologists were tracking underground movement. They were sure it was an animal long believed to be extinct. They were having trouble with some hippie protesters and wanted a security team present to discourage the protesters from escalating the situation. I thought this was a lot of money just to show an armed presence, but I was seeing dollars and not a whole lot of sense.  
  
  It seemed like a simple enough operation, so I took the job. Who am I to stop Uncle Sam from giving me back some of my hard-earned tax dollars? Of course, they would just tax it again, but I would be taking home a good amount of cash. I put together a team. They requested that I assemble three more men and that they would each be compensated two hundred thousand dollars. I told them that for that kind of money, it wouldn’t be a problem. It wasn’t. Guys were jumping at the chance to make that kind of dough for something this easy.  
  
  We met up at the airport and boarded a plane for Georgia. Once there we headed to the address, they had given me and reported for our assignment. We were introduced to the team. Dr. Santiago and Dr. Carmichael were from the USGS. Dr. Mattis and DR. Asher were the zoologists They had called in. Once introductions were made, we were briefed that the team would be tracking an animal, as it was believed it would be hiding underground the geologist would be able to guide them.  
  
Again, things didn’t seem to add up, but a job was a job I thought. We started the next day in the northwest corner of Georgia and eventually made our way into Tennessee. At this point, we were mostly traveling through the forest. The USGS team had various gadgets including underground imaging and tracking equipment. They were relying on this equipment to guide the way. This was when we felt the first tremor. It came on like a small earthquake.  
  
  The small tremor seemed to excite the USGS guys, it sounded like this was the sign they were looking for. It struck me as odd, but I just figured an earthquake in Tennessee would interest someone from the Geological Service. They started moving further north and the further north we got the harder the quakes were. I started wondering what the hell they were chasing. When I tried asking, they just gave me an annoyed look and the same bullshit story. Tracking an animal that’s supposed to be extinct my ass.  
  
  Whatever it was I wasn’t extremely worried about it. I just didn’t like being lied to, especially by people who weren’t any good at it. If I only knew how wrong I was. Oh, I was being lied to, it just wasn’t about what I thought it was. Although I said I wasn’t extremely worried, I’d be lying if said I wasn’t nervous. When you’re put in an unknown situation without the facts you should be nervous. The time for being scared wasn’t far away though.  
  
  We made it a little over two miles when the largest quake yet hit us hard. It knocked us right off our feet. There was a loud groan and an even louder snap like lightning had just struck us. We scrambled for cover staying low. When I looked back, I saw one of the scientists disappear into the ground. That’s when I noticed the huge fissure that had opened. I yelled for the other scientist to move, but it didn’t do any good. He just stood there staring at the six-foot wide thirty-foot crack in the ground.  
  
  I attempted to run back to pull the scientist to safety, but it backfired. The ground jolted us off our feet. When the scientist fell into the fissure, he took me with him like a man drowning takes you under. We fell into the darkness crashing to the floor below. I heard a moan beneath me and realized I had landed on top of him. I rolled off Dr. Santiago and quickly retrieved my flashlight. Illuminating the tunnel, which we now found ourselves in, I saw that Dr. Mattis had broken his neck.  
  
  He lay there with his feet bent over backward. His heels were on either side of his head which was cocked at an impossible angle. Dr. Santiago rose slowly only to discover that he could no longer apply weight to his right ankle. Dr. Carmichael and Dr. Asher were peering down at us from above along with my team. When they asked if everyone was ok, I advised them of the situation. The mood went momentarily somber. The mourning of their colleague didn’t last long.  
  
   One of the zoologists, Dr. Asher I think it was, suddenly spoke up with an excited energy that didn’t seem to fit the current situation. After Informing everyone that the new readings were incredible and there were reports of an explosion on a construction site in a nearby town. He continued stating that we were extremely close to our objective. I would later learn that the explosion was blamed on Hammons Drilling and Blasting, a company the BBB originally claimed to have never heard of. Next thing you know they come back saying they’ve had all these complaints about Hammon.  
  
  Funny how that works. You go from never hearing of a company to stating that you’ve had a long list of complaints about them, And the ladder just happens to fit the narrative. When I Asked for an extraction, it was denied. The USGS Team just wanted to proceed as if nothing had happened. Then we were offered one hundred thousand dollars a piece to continue the expedition. Two of my guys refused, leaving myself and John Mackland. How easily money can blind you.  
  
  A helicopter came in and Two of my guys boarded it with Dr. Mattis’s dead body. The injured Dr. Santiago joined them. I remember thinking that I should have done the same. Turns out I was lucky I didn’t, the helicopter went down seven minutes later. No one survived. Things sure went to shit fast. With two doctors, myself, and John we proceeded down the tunnel following the USGS detection equipment. I’m not sure how it worked but it looked like a custom-built piece of equipment.  
  
  We eventually came to a room-sized chamber and Dr. Asher informed us he would set up here. He set up some equipment and then brought out something wrapped in burlap. That something turned out to be three broken pieces of stone with strange carvings on them. He arranged the pieces on the floor in the middle of the room until they fit together like a puzzle.  
  
  I could see a blip on one of his hand-held monitors heading toward our location. When Dr. Asher pulled out a scroll and started chanting, I thought I had somehow slipped into a bad horror film. John asked me What the hell was going on and I honestly didn’t have an answer. Apparently, something else did though, because we began hearing a low guttural growling noise approaching from one of the tunnels. John and I instinctively drew our weapons.  
  
  I Told Dr. Asher to keep quiet, but he went right on chanting. He even began to chant louder. At this point, my heart began to feel with dread. Dr. Carmichael Approached the tunnel And I saw something move so quickly it was a blur. Dr. Carmichael’s head came rolling back towards us. We immediately began firing. There was a blur as something rushed past me picking up John and slamming him first into the ceiling and then onto the floor. I quickly reloaded.  
  
  The thing went for Dr. Asher next. Dr. Asher just kept on chanting until this thing's mouth clamped down around the back of his neck. At this point I had emptied two magazines into this creature, the room was splattered with blood, and I had no one left to protect. I ran. I picked a tunnel and ran like my life depended on it, because it did. I slammed into the tunnel walls several times not stopping to engage my flashlight.  
  
  I reached another fissure after running for what seemed like an hour. Realizing there wasn’t enough time to climb out. I ducked down behind the rubble that fell in when the fissure had opened. I've been hiding here for nearly three hours, and I can still hear the beast sniffing around and occasionally growling. I don’t know exactly where I’m at, but I’m near a fissure somewhere in Eastern Tennessee or Western North Carolina.  
  
  If anyone gets this stay away from openings in the ground around these states, and please send help. Hopefully, I can Hold out that long. It sounds like the creature is getting closer.
