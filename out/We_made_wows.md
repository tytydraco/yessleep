Title: We Made Vows

I’ve never been married. Not legally. Not in a church, not at city hall, not even in some drunken Vegas chapel. I checked. And I mean really checked.

I tore through every drawer and box in my attic, flipped through every folder in my Google Drive. I searched my social media, my email, my insurance, the digital graveyards where our lives leave traces. There’s no record. No wedding. No photos. No certificate. No wife.

But then again, when i told my boss that i needed a few days off for personal stuff last month, he agreed...and asked if shes ok.

When I saw my doctor to refill my anxiety meds, she asked how my wife was doing. Said she looked pale the last time she came in with me.

But I don’t bring anyone to appointments. I live alone. I am sure of it.

This all started to feel strangely off, as if there was this hole in my life, and something, or someone was quietly filling it behind my back. Not violently. Not even with malice. Just... occupying space I didn’t give away. Like a cup that always ends up half full, even though you’re sure you poured it out.

The first time I mentioned her out loud was a reflex. I was in line at the pharmacy and muttered, mostly to myself, "My wife would lose her head if it wasn’t screwed on." The guy behind the counter smiled. Said, "She was in here last week picking up your prescription."

I blinked. "She was?"

"Yeah. We joked about the name mismatch. You go by your middle name, right?"

I do. I always have. Since I was a kid. But I’d never told him that. Never needed to.

I smiled, paid, and left. I told myself it was a mistake. A mix-up. Maybe someone else’s wife had picked up meds, and he’d confused the names. It happens. I wanted it to be that.

Until I got home and noticed the mug in the sink.

I never drink from green mugs. I don’t even own one, or I didn’t think I did. This one was pale green with a chipped handle. Not mine. And it was warm.

I havent slept that night. My brain was a mush and my mind was all over the place, thoughts refusing to remain encased in its space. I got up and walked around, talking to myself just chill a bit, to snap out of this state, along that trying to calm my paranoia and checking the obvius...one toothbrush, one pair of slipers.

That night I couldn’t sleep. My thoughts were heavy and slippery, like trying to hold water in cupped hands. I got out of bed and walked the house in the dark, whispering nonsense to myself just to break the silence. I turned on the kitchen light, opened every cupboard. Nothing unusual. No second toothbrush. No slippers beside the door.

But there were changes. Subtle ones. The laundry folded a little too neatly. The fridge organized differently than I remembered. Nothing dramatic just off.

I started recording myself while I slept.

The first three nights, there was nothing. I was turning in bed,  ocasional cough, snore but then something weird. On the fourth night, in the dead of night, I heard the scrape of a chair moving across the tile. Breathing, soft and slow, near the mic. Then a whisper: "I love you."

I don’t talk in my sleep. And I didn’t get out of bed that night.

I tried to rationalize it. Maybe I got up and forgot. Maybe I was dreaming. Maybe it was something outside. The house creaks all the time.

But the next morning, my neighbor waved and said, "Tell your wife I found that recipe she wanted. Left it in your mailbox."

I got thrown off imediately, she didn’t say it like a joke. It was a stated fact.

I opened the mailbox. There was a folded piece of paper. My neighbor’s handwriting. It said: "Hope she likes it! .--Karen."

But it wasn’t a recipe for food. It was a crochet pattern. For a baby’s bonnet.

I don’t have a baby. I’ve never wanted one. I’ve ended relationships over that. But for the rest of that day, I kept glimpses in my peripheral vision.  Just a small onesie folded on a couch....and a name I couldn’t say resting just behind my tongue.

Something was wrong.

It was thiat night that  had a dream. We were in a kitchen, sun shining through the windows. She was crying and I was holding her hands.

“You promised,” she said. “You made vows.”

I don’t know what I did wrong, but the guilt was destroying me. I woke up like i was grabing for air. The hallway light was on and I didn’t remember leaving it that way.

At this point i did what always was my safe harbour. I called Darren, my oldest friend. We’ve known each other since we were kids. If anyone could talk sense into me, it was him.

We met for coffee. I told him everything. The mug, the voice, the pharmacy, the pattern. I expected him to laugh, to tease me for spiraling.

He didn’t.

He looked tired. He stirred his coffee for too long before saying, "You always do this."

"Do what?"

"Forget. Pull away. You two were a mess for a while, but then… it was like something clicked. You were happy. Completely different. And then every once in a while, you’d get like this again. Like you woke up in a life you didn’t remember building."

"You remember her?"

He nodded. "She came to your mom’s funeral. And that trip to the lakehouse, remember that? You fought the whole way there. Then suddenly you were inseparable. You said you’d figured it out."

"What’s her name, Darren?"

He stared at me like I’d grown a second head. "You’re not serious."

"Tell me. Please."

He hesitated. Looked away and said: "Stop messing, you need to stop and snap out of it.", and this is when i felt like a slap was coming with that. It never came, but his frustration was real.

That night, I set up cameras. Motion-activated, six total - covering every room, every door, every angle.

At 3:08 a.m., every single one recorded movement.

And every single file was corrupted.

Except one.

The camera facing the basement stairs.

It showed me. Or someone who looked like me. Standing halfway down the stairs. Smiling.

Saying, “We made vows.”

I dont remember when i got up, But in the morning I  found a shoebox on the dresser. And inside were photograps.

Polaroids. Dozens of them.

All of her.

Her eyes were always a little off. Lighting too dim. Face sometimes blurred. But she was real. In my arms. In our kitchen. At a park I don’t remember visiting.

One photo showed her holding a newborn.

The baby’s face was smeared. Not like a bad shot, like the photo rejected its existence.

The final image was of me. Sitting at my desk. Typing.

And behind me, in the blurry background was her.

I’m tired of pretending she isn’t there. Tired of pretending this is something I can explain away. The truth is, I see her now. I feel her. I recognize the slope of her shoulders when she walks past the hallway. The scent that lingers in the bedroom, faint like lavender and smoke. I even remember the way she laughed.

And the more I let myself accept it, the more it makes sense.

Nothing seems wrong with my life. There is no missing time. No mysterious bruises. No flickering lights or messages in blood. Just… her. Missing from my mind and perfectly present in everyone else’s.

This isn’t random. This didn’t just happen. She did this. Whatever it is, she made it this way.

It feels like she made me forget. As if she let me drift far enough that when I came back, I’d be scared, unsure, vulnerable. And then she gave me just enough, just one memory, one whisper, one image to reel me back in.

And I came back. I always come back.

I look at her sitting at the table like she’s always been there, but then something hapeneded. A suden surge of clarity hit and sudenly....

I believe her.

I don’t understand any of this. It doesen't seem like it's posible to just forget, But I know I did. And I think I’ve done it before.

She smiles when our eyes meet. Not cruelly. Not smugly. Just... like she’s relieved.

"Welcome home," she says with the sweetest voice.

And I don’t argue.

Because maybe I did make vows.

And maybe she’s just holding me to them.
