Let’s cut to the chase: I’ve been having some weird dreams. Dreams which I’m not so sure *are* dreams. Well, they’re nightmares really, but that doesn’t roll off the tongue as well, does it?



Anyway, they began about a week ago now on the first night after I cashed in a heap of unused vacation days and a chunk of savings to take two weeks off in the Muskokas. 



For those unaware, the Muskokas are a series of lakes (Lake Muskoka, Lake Rosseau, and Lake Joseph being the can’t-miss ones) in Northern Ontario, Canada. Rich folks *love* to summer there- and winter, and fall, and spring too. They’re there basically whenever they want, really. It’s not lost on me that the richest people seem to work the least, but this is no time for some half-baked Marxist tirade from an *accountant* of all people. 



So, why was I there? Simple. ‘Cause *they* were there. Seemed a fair chance for networking. I know, I know, but business is business. Even vacation is business.



Within hours of arriving at the cottage I rented, I ‘happened’ to run into a client of mine.



“Well, I’ll be! What are the odds?”



I dunno sir, I’d say somewhere around 100% when you factor in that I knew you’d be here at this exact place at this exact time, and- of course- carry the 1. 



It only took a few moments of idle jabbering for him to invite me to that day’s regatta. All according to plan. 



For those unaware- I may have to say this a lot- a regatta is an event rich old people put on to ‘race boats’, but it’s really an excuse to eat barbecue (which I love) and commiserate (which I hate) by a nice-looking body of water. No tennis shoes, no polo shirt, no service, you could say.



I know it probably sounds like I’m way off track, simply ranting about irrelevant nonsense. I promise, though… This is important. I’m not exactly sure *how* important it is, or *why* it’s important, but… it’s important.



Of course, I ‘happily’ accepted the invitation if one is willing to stretch the meaning of ‘happily’ to its furthest conceivable limit, and I accompanied my client down to the bay where the event was about to begin. 



It was time to be as phony as possible. Big smiles! 



When the sun finally began to set and people started heading home, I couldn’t be more relieved. I was six beers deep, which I *needed*- or, at least, I told myself I did- to push through that plaid and khaki nightmare. I *hate* social interaction, and I foolishly thought I had gamed the system when I chose a career that I had *thought* was just doing math alone in a room all day. Oh, how wrong I was…



I couldn’t be more ready to crash down in bed once I got back. I didn’t even bother taking my clothes off; I simply kicked off my shoes and flopped onto the mattress, rolling over to stare drunkenly at the varnished wooden roof of the cabin. In seconds, the polished sea of wooden boards dulled in my vision, swirling away, splintering into towering spires of bark.



I was in the woods. 



How I’d gotten there? Who knows.



Why I was there? Who knows.



I could hardly think. My brain felt as though it were smothered in a weighted blanket. Honestly, though… I was more relieved than concerned at this, I was frankly sick of being conscious at the moment.



The forest was quiet. Dare I say *too* quiet? No birds, no crickets, and what I struggle to even call a breeze. 



Suddenly, I found my foot rising from the pine-needle carpet. 



Step. Step. Step.



I was walking. Where? I didn’t know.



Step. Step. Step.



Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a deer to my left. Whitetail-  a hefty stag at that, with antlers more like gnarled branches than antlers. 



Step. Step. Step.



Together we marched. 



Step. Step. Step.



To my right, another deer. A doe. Frail and meek.



Step. Step. Step.



Soon enough, a herd of rabbits- or hares- hopped along.



Step. Step. Step. Hop. Hop. Hop.



By the time we reached our destination, our ‘little’ party had grown some hundred strong, parading silently amongst the trees. Doubtful we knew where we were going, but we knew when we got there.



After what felt like hours, we reached a clearing in the woods. As we stepped past the tree-lined perimeter, we all stopped dead in our tracks, as though frozen solid- feet, hooves, talons, paws, and the like all still in the dewy grass.



Across the clearing, though dark, I could make out the dull glimmer of eyes staring back at me. Hundreds, if not thousands of glassy globes fixed right on me, or us, rather. I didn’t yet know whose- or what’s- eyes they were.



Seconds later, a man emerged from the almost-inky blackness. He was rugged in his features but timid in his movements, clearly a cautious man. He glanced at me as he approached us, and I couldn’t help but notice a pistol holstered on his belt.



Slowly, he walked to a doe at the end of the line and reached down towards his hip. If I wasn’t so foggy-minded, I probably would’ve thought he was going for the gun and made a run for it, but I didn’t. I stood there. Dead still.



He didn’t pull out the gun either, though. Instead, he fished a small, practically key-chain-sized flashlight out of the pocket of his bulky pants, clicking it on as he shone it into one of the deer’s eyes. He squinted, leaning in close, as though he was looking for something, staring firmly into the deer’s eye, before, seeming satisfied, his shoulders relaxed ever-so-slightly, and he moved away the light.



He went like this down the line. He’d shine his light in the eyes, look *very* closely for… something, and then when he was satisfied he’d simply move on to the next one in line. 

Eventually, that was me.



He seemed slightly more cautious with me than he had been with the others. Maybe it was just that although there were at least a hundred beings in this clearing, we were the only two humans.



But, procedure was procedure. Up went the light, and he shone it right in my eyes. As he leaned closer, his eyes mere inches from my own, I could see a small smile beginning to spread across his lips. He was satisfied.



He clicked off the light, and my brain dimmed with the bulb. My vision went black, and there I was. Back in bed. It was morning.



My head was KILLING me. Alcohol will do that to you, though, so I figured I was just hung over. I also figured some Advil would do me some good, so I mapped out the route to the nearest pharmacy, hopped in my car, and hit the road.



It was there at the pharmacy that things really got strange- if they weren’t already. As I wandered through the aisles under the lights’ fluorescent glow, I rounded the corner from ‘cold and flu’ towards ‘home health’ to see a figure standing behind the pharmacist’s counter. He was a sizable man in a white coat adorned with an embossed pin that read ‘MY NAME IS: Emile. I AM A: Pharmacist’.



It was him.



We met eyes. Or, we met eyes *again*. Or, we met eyes for the first time. I don’t know for sure. I just knew it was *him*. The man. The man with the flashlight.



He must have noticed the look I was giving him, so I didn’t even have to bother with the cliche ‘Have we met somewhere?’ before he grinned warmly and blurted out “Regatta?”



“What?”“You know, yesterday? Let me guess, you had a few too many?” 



“Oh. Right. Did we meet?”



“No, no,” He chuckled, “I don’t really *mingle*, I’m only there for the free food.”I couldn’t help but smile back a bit. A man after my own heart.



“I can see you’re… having a rough morning though,” He continued, before pointing a finger. “Aisle six. Herbal remedies. Don’t ask me why the ibuprofen is there, I don’t stock the shelves.”



“Thanks… Emile,” I replied cordially and staggered off for the medicine.



Just like that, we parted ways. 



Unfortunately, the advil didn’t help. My mind was now afflicted by that which I know of no medicine to cure- at least, that I could get my hands on- a sort of odd, existential feeling that I wouldn’t necessarily call dread, but I wouldn’t call it pleasant either. 



As a numbers man, I often deal in probabilities. So, I couldn’t help but wonder about the probability of that encounter. However, I couldn’t even *begin* to calculate that probability because I was unsure what had even happened to me. Was it a dream? Probably, but then why did I have the strongest, cloying feeling that it wasn’t? Was it real? Probably not, but then why did I have the oddest feeling that it was? How could I possibly figure out how likely something was if I didn’t even know what that *something* was? My head only hurt worse.



Again… I don’t know. My head *still* throbs thinking about it all, so I’ll get on with it, if for no one’s sake but my own. 



I had another dream that night.



I was back in the woods. Then I was back in the clearing. 



This time, though, I didn’t stop. 



Step. Step. Step. 



Those eyes in the distance grew larger and more defined. Dull and defeated, they followed me. 



Step. Step. Step.



I saw them. Cages. Hundreds of cages. Deer, rabbits, hawks… even a rather malnourished-looking brown bear. Their skin writhed. They brayed and barked and cried at the threshold of audibility. Flesh erupted with throbbing white growths from bare patches of missing fur and feathers, and a stag, antlers tangled in the wire of its prison, nearly covered, seemed to give me a look of quiet pleading with its eyes barely visible, almost swallowed up by the wriggling matte mass.



I did not stop.



Step. Step. Step.



There it was. 



A staircase. 



In the dead center of the clearing, a sod staircase descended into the flaky earth, visibly propped up by moldy wooden beams. 



Where it went? I didn’t know.



Soon, though… I would find out.



Step. Step. Step.



I was swallowed by the abyss. But there, at the end of the damp dirt tunnel, stood Emile in a small, dug-out room, barely illuminated by the light of a few electric lanterns. 



As I entered, he gave me a friendly smile, as if to say, ‘Ah, you finally made it!’



Behind Emile was a mass. Huge, blobbish, and pale white, it seethed endlessly. 



Before Emile was a desk or some kind of makeshift altar. If so, it was a shoddy one at that; it was one of those cheap plastic folding tables, battered and scratched. 



Upon the table lay a deer.



It was like the others. Its body was nearly engulfed in these growths, and it laid almost completely still, save for the occasional breath, as its engorged stomach rose and fell weakly, rasping softly.



His smile refusing to waver, Emile reached below the table and drew an axe. He raised it above his head and swiftly brought it down with a loud ‘THUNK!’

Right into the deer’s neck.



It had initially seemed like he had decapitated the poor thing, but as he dug his gloved fingers into the wound and pulled with all of his might, only then did the head come off as he ripped it away.



Except the head didn’t come ‘off’, it merely came off of the body. It was still ‘attached’- to the growths, that is. Veiny, blood-soaked tendrils extended from the center of the stag’s neck all the way to the base of the head where it had been severed, feet away across the floor. 



The pulsating strands draped across the tabletop and drooped to the floor like glistening vines, and as my gaze traveled along them, that pale highway, I found the deer was, unbelievably, still alive. 



Well, maybe not… Who knows at this point? It was still breathing, at least… Its body lay splayed out on Emile’s table, its head laying yards away on the cold dirt, and it was still breathing. Its mouth opened and closed, its chest rose and fell… God… It was breathing.



Emile’s expression as he glared down at the poor beast with me was… as disgusting as it feels to say this, almost motherly. It was the kind of warm, tilted-head smile a mother gives her child when they’re unknowingly doing some dumb, cutesy kid thing like innocently asking if a hamburger counts as fruit with genuine curiosity.



He reached down slowly, gripped the tendrils in his hands, steadied his feet, and yanked. With a nauseating ‘squelch’ sound, he tore out the soggy growths, cradling the dripping bundle of thrashing whatever-the-hell in his arms. 



There was way more in there than I thought.



Almost giddily, Emile approached me, and, without thinking, I held out my arms. 



Emile gladly plopped the squirming bundle in my arms. It was cold and spongey. Wet, too… 



As if on instinct, I walked around Emile, facing the huge writhing white mass that engulfed the far wall. As Emile looked on with what seemed to be almost pride, I knelt. Slowly, I massaged the putrid bundle into the titanic mass. 



It engorged, swallowing the bundle, assimilating it, growing, feeding? It was… overwhelming.



It was gone. It had been taken in. Swallowed up. It was a part of the whole.



My vision blurred. 



Pale white everywhere.



It was towering above me.



And I woke up.
