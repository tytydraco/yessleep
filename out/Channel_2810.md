I'm not sure how to ask this, even I'm not sure how this even happened.

I was watching T.V this morning. The weather was messing with the signal. However, there were a few channels weren't messed with. The channels were ION, QVC, and a new channel, called: 28-10 D0K1. 

 I didn't think about what the channel was. I didn't even know what the channel's contents were. But at the time, I could either choose to get out of bed, and go watch Loud House. Or I could suck it up and watch whatever was going to come on.

  I chose to lay down, and enjoy the show. 

The show that came on was an anime, it didn't look like anything I had ever seen, but I spent many months watching anime with my little sister. Begrudgingly, of course, since I was happier playing Fallout 76 or Minecraft on my PS4 than watching Demon Slayer or My Hero Academia. But that is besides the point. The anime in question looked to be something from the early 80s. But there was something familiar about the characters. 

 There were four main characters, and upon hearing their names mentioned. The thing I thought was familiar hit me like a ton of bricks. The girls' names were references to a video game. *Doki Doki Literature Club.* And upon looking at the characters, they were dead ringers for their video game counterparts.

 The show itself wasn't anything to write home about. The anime followed the main cast of characters getting into humorous situations. At least it was like that for the first 20 minutes. Then the rest of the show derailed from that point.

 I got up to get myself something to eat, and maybe to go and talk to my mom. And when I returned to my room to grab some writing supplies when I noticed that there was an awful scene, All but one of the characters were dead. They sat in desks, their eyes looking lifeless. Except for the one who looked like the main villian of *Doki Doki Literature Club:* Monika.

 She looked at the screen with a blank stare. Her eyes were a bright shade of green. As soon as I began cleaning, she began talking.

 "So.. you found us? Didn't you, What is the old saying? Curiosity killed the cat?" She said before the screen glitched for a second. 

"You act like you're so brave. Watching your little horror films, and you go into hysterics after watching a fucking mod?" Monika said in a mocking voice.

 "What are you? This can't be real?" 

 I heard her laughing. 

"You do realize that you're living in your own nightmare. I'm in control now.. so sit back and enjoy the show." Monika said as she snapped her fingers, and then shit went down the fucking drain.

 The screen showed scenes I can't explain without sounding like a madman. Women dressed up as Yuri, the bookish purple haired girl, cutting themselves with ritualistic knives, Men killing their daughters who were dressed up like Natsuki. The short pink haired girl who was rumored to be abused by her father. Girls dressed up as Sayori hanging themselves. I saw those boys who commited suicide after playing the game. They weren't driven to suicide by mental issues. They were broken.  "This can all end... if you join the club." The voice of Monika mused. "Or I can take my time and break you like the little toy you are."

   I grabbed the remote, and I shut the T.V off, and I sat there quietly. Registering what had happened, Was this some sort of sick joke? Or something else? This happened today, and when I went to check the T.V earlier, the channel was gone. 

 I'm not sure what the hell was up with that show. But I don't intend to dig around. I still love the game with the same burning passion that I had since I was a kid. But that, was Something I can't explain.  Can anybody explain what the hell I saw, or at least, give me an idea of what the message of that broadcast could be?

I haven't told my family about what happened. Because if they heard me say I saw that. They wouldn't believe me..I'm sorry about the lack of details. But a part of me, doesn't believe that I saw it. A part of me says that this is all just a daydream. But at the end of the day, the truth, is often times stranger than fiction.
