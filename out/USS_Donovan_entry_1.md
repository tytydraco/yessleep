I want to preface this by saying that legally, the USS Donovan and the Darwin Voyages do not exist. Nor have they ever existed in US military records or any American history. What I am about to tell you is the truth of why sailors do many things, and of why I will never return to the sea so long as I live.

My name is Francis, who I am, where I come from, that’s not important. What is important is this. I served as a Navy Hull technician for nearly 8 years. I was discharged at the rank of Chief petty officer, and served as manager and supervisor of H-T’s aboard the USS Donovan. I saw everything that happened there, even that which others would never believe. But that, is for later. Right now all you must know is that the USS Donovan was not a normal destroyer. The USS Donovan was  almost a punishment of sorts, an assignment so terrible anyone sent there was sure to come back worse off. It was old, real old, constructed roughly during the end of ww2. It was a miracle that thing floated at all, let alone allowed a manned crew to treat it like a proper navy vessel.

The halls of the ship were fighting a losing battle to rust and wear as was the rest of the ship. The only place that wasn’t in a losing battle with the sea was Captain sodark’s quarters. Sodark was a real tool, some trumped up Captain who got his way up there with daddies money. He was a weaselly little man with a short mustache and constantly greased hair. He looked as if a rat from below deck had put on a cheap Halloween costume of a person and called it a day. And he was just as mean as a rat. he would have you chipping rust off the bow for coughing during a meal, Let alone any actual infractions. Overall, it wasn’t the ship that was the punishment, It was Sodark.. that was what we all thought in our first weeks. Truth is, there’s far worse things than Captain Sodark on the USS Darwin. And I’m going to tell you all I know. 

Good news is, I was able to dig up some old notebooks I kept from the time, I was always studious when it came to notes, so I’ll have full confidence in what I tell you. Many people think all that lives in the sea are fish, sharks, dolphins and whales. That, isn’t nearly true. There’s a whole host of things we sailors don’t speak of. Things that make a normal land faring man crawl… 

This next part will be some excerpts I wrote, logs if you would about the biologically impossible or supernatural we were witness to in our time.

Banana fish:

Don’t be confused by the name, these aren’t the tropical fish with yellow stripes you might know of.. have you ever heard the old rule about never bringing bananas onto a boat, something about spoiling fruit and sinking ships, bad luck and all that. Well that wasn’t entirely a farce to keep others out of the banana trade. 

A banana fish is much like a silver fish, it lives inside the bananas grown near Cape Horn Argentina, and is often picked up by accident due to the ignorance or malice of the seller. They are about 5-7 inches long, with slimed down and curved yellow bodies and pincers and inch long they have 4 beady little eyes on their head with antennae on the back. They stand on legs nearly half an inch tall, with six legs.They can burrow through almost anything including the hulls of rusted ships or wooden boats. In days of old they would crawl into the other food stocks at night, eating them from the inside and causing them to rot before sneaking back into the walls or the ship or the bananas, which were always left intact.

On rare occasion a sailor might pick up enough banana fish to cause what’s called a banana swarm. Clouds of banana fish burrowing and chewing through the boat, causing it to sink, and nothing but bananas to rise to the surface, an omen thought to be cause by the bananas themselves.

Banana fish aren’t too hard to deal with, an even quelled sailor always brings a hammer to produce checks, and the banana fish aren’t venomous at all, just a nuisance. And a simple one at that. Many sailors save the hassle and just don’t sell or travel with bananas at all, especially not anymore in the times of modern commercial seafaring.

I once had a nasty encounter with banana fish. We had picked up a crate off one of the navy suppliers at port, food they said. When we opened it, it turned out to be a whole container of produce, mostly bananas, but some rotten apples, melons, citrus, and tropical fruits lay just atop the piles of bananas by the time we had loaded the containers contents into one of our ‘pantries’ as we liked to call them, some of them men had talked about seeing parts of the piles wriggle or move, we all chalked it up to the drunken bosuns-mate and his crewmen. Another late night binge back before regulations were enforced as much, not as if they ever were with an environment like ours. 

But anyways back to the story, I had been put on first watch and as such, I was dozing off right next to the pantry door, having a great dream about a lady, when all of a sudden, I awoke, to find myself covered in roosting banana fish, who were using me for warmth I suppose, needless to say, old Beckett went in there with a fire extinguisher and a hammer, and didn’t come out till every single one of those bugs was stomped or drowned in foam. I still remember how they wriggled on me, inspecting me with their tweezer like antenna as if I was another succulent piece of fruit. There hasn’t been a night since when I haven’t carried a hammer with me to bed.

Sirens:

When one thinks of sirens one would most often imagine a beautiful woman with a fishes lower half, singing a song that lured sailors to their doom with an enchanting song. In this case, dispel that notion immediately, it’s not true at all. I don’t entirely know what sirens are, nor what they are officially classified as, we refer to them as sirens simply because there is no better term. 

Sirens are tall humanoids with full bodies of scales and fins, their hands and feet are webbed and carry claws. thick enough to leave scratches in metal, and cut men to ribbons. They stand anywhere from 6-8 feet tall, and where one would assume a humanoid head lay, is instead that of an angler fish, large teeth, bulbous eyes and a lure. They walk upright when on land or deck but have a habit of crawling through vents and contorting themselves to crawl on all fours while they hunt.

The reason we call them Sirens is because of the way they hunt. They can mimic voices very well, anything they have ever heard they can recollect, so they’re especially dangerous if they’ve been successful hunting. Most sirens hunt solo, with younger sirens, usually only 5 feet tall, tagging along with their parents as they learn. Sirens inhabit all waters of the ocean but are well known in the pacific, Antarctic, and Indian oceans.

The cold weather and hot weather sirens look different. Cold weather sirens are white in color with bulbous eyes and a bright lure, while hot weather sirens are multicolored and have dimmed lures and smaller eyes. Cold weathers are always the worst. They are aggressive as all hell and consider the Antarctic theirs to keep.

I’ve had more than a few friends lured into a sirens grip and either torn apart or dragged into the sea kicking and screaming. But I’ll always remember petty officer Johnson. Johnson was an old head, he’d been around the Donovan for nearly 10 years and to us was practically a god. He taught me the ropes, and was the first of the crew to catalog the things we saw. One night Johnson was walking back to his bunk I presume, I only know because he had met up with me at the mess hall before hand, and was wasted. By the time the screams began I wasn’t far behind him. When I ran into the hall I saw Johnson first, limp and lifeless, and then the siren, huge, with Johnson’s head in its mouth. It looked over at me, as I had caught it mid kill.. the thing let out a yell I knew to be Johnson’s and chased after me. Ducking through hallways I saw a few other dead crewmen, their bodies desecrated and their head all bitten off and chewed up. The siren was hunting us for sport that night.

I ducked into the first place I could, the fabrication shop. Ducking between poles and projects I dipped beneath a metal bench, holding my breath as the siren entered. It stalked along the walkway, eventually getting to my table, its webbed feet stopped, and I heard the thud of Johnson getting dropped beside me. Almost relieved I looked down at Johnson, his face was mauled and unrecognizable, his eyes stared forward within the bite marred face he now had.. blood pooled around him as the creature walked forward. I had to think to something, anything, so I did. The band saw. A piece of equipment built before safety was a common thought, terrifying to use at any point. Perfect for me.

As the creature walked along I snuck to the controls, turning it on before ducking away, the machine roared to life and the blade began spinning. The siren ran to it, looking it over in a curious way. That saw was the last thing it saw, as I got behind it with a large piece of metal, and bashed the thing into the saw. It screamed and screamed, getting pulled down by the saw as it cut him straight down the middle. By the time I turned the damned thing off the siren 
was cut from stomach to lure in half, kneeling against it lifelessly. I spat on the bastard for what it did, and returned to my bunk. That morning we held a service for Johnson and all the other shipmates who had been killed by the thing.. however, their bodies were never found.

The shipmates:

People like to talk about the ghosts they’ve seen aboard older ships, men in dungarees and peaked caps walking along and asking for a smoke or where the med bay was, only to disappear into the darkness of some hallway or discredit shadow filled corner. They always tell the same stories. And we on the Donovan had our own. The shipmates were said to be men who fell to the other threats aboard the Donovan, caught between life and death begging for release.. currently we have no way to release them from this.. so they are a constant annoyance to us.

Shipmates like to pop up when you least expect it, they’ll make off with your razor, or hang on the top bunk and watch you from the corner with a smile. The few who have seemed more interested in their matters besides trickery have talked about horrid things beyond the realm in which you and I reside “it’s eternity in there, we suffer with the things below deck!” “We have seen things beyond you sailor, turn back!” “Abandon all hope ye who enter here.” That last one stuck with me, mainly because the man who said it was one I knew in life. And I was assured he had never read Dante’s inferno.

I’m sorry to say my memory is a little foggy now, I will be around to update this place with more of my adventures, but in the meantime, don’t listen to the voices, stamp out any thin yellow, and pray. One thing I have begun to notice is that those who met with the ghosts of men past often were always.. hanging by the time we found them the night after. I still do not understand why, or how, seeeing as we’re were below deck.. and out of the way of any rope.
