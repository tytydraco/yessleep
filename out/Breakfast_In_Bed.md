The sun shines cheery-bright into my kitchen as I make my sweetheart a birthday treat: breakfast in bed! From whipping cream by hand to shaping blueberry pancakes into little hearts, I put all of my love into every stir. My heart sings along with the chorus of songbirds cheep-cheeping away at my windowsill, the delicious savory and sweet aromas wafting through my little farmhouse, the satisfaction of a meal well cooked.

The piece de resistance is the bacon. His favorite! 

I’d procured and cured a chunk of belly in my cellar for weeks so I could turn it into thick slices. It was a lot of work, but I just kept thinking of my sweetheart; his joy as I bring him a beautiful tray of crispy bacon and pancakes stacked high and his amazement when he learns I made it from scratch! 

Just as I pull his bacon from the pan, I hear him begin to stir. No doubt the delicious smell finally wafted its way upstairs! I try not to rush as I stack blueberry pancakes, drizzling them carefully with hand-tapped maple syrup and my from-scratch vanilla whipped cream. I serve the tower of sweetness with a glass of hand-squeezed orange juice and, of course, a heaping plate of his crispy bacon! 

I smooth out my skirts and dutifully bring the feast up to my waiting sweetheart. 

My heart flutters as I unlock his door, undo the bolts and at last open his door. There he is, pretty as a picture, shackled to his cozy four-poster bed. He’s shy as ever, turning his cute little face away from me and trying to hide behind his bound arms.

“Happy birthday, sweetheart!” I sing out, “You’ve been oh so good, and I just had to show you how happy you make me!”

I step over his catheter tube and his bedpan to bring him the food. He looks from the tray of goodies to me with a bit of confusion, so I help him eat- making cute little airplane sounds to get him to open up his mouth. He eats surprisingly well for someone who lost their tongue recently, and looks so grateful for the scrumptious meal- especially his bacon!

I want to wait until he’s done, but I can’t keep it to myself anymore. I blurt out: 

“Do you like your bacon?”

He gives a soft little gurgle, brow scrunched, mouth full.

“Well, guess what? I made it myself!”

I giggle, patting the newly-flat top of his soft, bandaged tummy. His eyes go wide in utter amazement. He’s so shocked I did all that for him that he gasps and starts to choke on his bacon!

Even with him spitting up half-chewed chunks of his own bacon, coughing and moaning, he’s just as beautiful as the day I first saw him.

“I love you, my big strong man.” I sigh dreamily, wiping the spew from his sweating chest. “I’ll make sure to cook you an even better breakfast next year!”
