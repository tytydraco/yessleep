Unfortunately, since my last post, I still have been unable to find any reliable information regarding my great-grandfather’s first supernatural encounter. I’ve seen one paper theorizing that the constant chemical warfare could have led to mutations in the local rat populations, but that theory seems rather far fetched, and isn’t fully consistent with the creatures my great-grandfather described. In any event, I’ve given up on researching the matter for now, and have instead focused on transcribing the rest of the journal.

What follows is the second supernatural experience recorded by my great-grandfather. As with before, names and other details have been altered to protect my identity.

\- - -

It was a bit over a year since my encounter with those rodent-like creatures before anything I would label as supernatural occurred again. I’m not entirely sure of the exact month, but I’m certain it was the winter of 1917. In any event, things had been continuing essentially the same, with constant deaths, very little ground gained, and the never ending din of distant artillery to serve as a lullaby.

During this time, I befriended another soldier by the name of Gordon Lindsay. Lindsay was a fairly jovial fellow, always quick with a joke to lighten the mood, which could be in turn infuriating or endearing depending upon the particulars of any given situation. I recall a particular incident in which another infantryman happened to have been shot in a rather, shall we say, sensitive area. The poor fellow was laid up in bed whereupon Lindsay walked up to him and cheerfully announced “Keep your chin up mate, at least you’ve got an excuse for its length now”. I’ve never seen someone so previously immobile get up that quickly before. Gordon had a black eye for a week or two after that.

It was almost surprising to learn that Lindsay was fairly well educated, given his constant joking and manner of speech. He spoke both French and German, and had been working on a degree of some sort before he was drafted. He only seemed to sober up from his pleasant, happy-go-lucky attitude whenever he heard someone on the other side of no man’s land cry out in pain or fear.

“To you lot”, I remember him saying once, “it’s just all a bunch of gibberish innit? Just sounds, disregarded as easily as the gobbling of a turkey about to be slaughtered for a Christmas dinner. But I hear what they’re saying, don’t I? Hear ‘em cry out for their mum, or talk about how much it hurts. I sometimes wish I never bloody studied German, it would make killin’ ‘em so much easier.”

I didn’t much know how to respond to that statement, so I just offered him a cigarette, which he gladly took.

The whole nasty business began one night when the Germans tried to surprise our trench with a nighttime raid. Lucky for us, one of the lads on watch managed to spot them, so we were able to repel most of them before we were in bayonet range. A few of them, however, managed to get down into the trench and caused a bit of chaos.

Initially I was barely conscious, having been woken up from a fitful sleep by shouts to take up arms. However, a shot whizzing by your head works wonders to clear the fog from one’s mind. Firing a rifle accurately in such close quarters is no easy feat, but I managed to get a shot off at one of our attackers, striking him in the leg. The poor blighter went down screaming bloody murder, and I was glad that I couldn’t understand German. I imagine the things he must have been saying about me are not suitable for repetition.

Looking around, I spotted Lindsay taking aim with his rifle at one of the Germans, completely unaware that right behind him was a man with a rather nasty looking knife. I yelled out to him to turn around, and, to his credit, he did, immediately firing a shot into his would-be attacker’s gut.   
 

The fighting was over, all of the trench raiders had either been killed, had surrendered, or were otherwise incapacitated. I jogged over to Lindsay, asking him if he was alright. As I reached him, I saw that he was staring at the man with the knife. Following his gaze, I looked down at the fallen soldier, realizing that he wasn’t quite dead.

As I watched, the man made direct eye contact with Lindsay, and cut his own palm with his knife. Blood poured out of the wound, but the man didn’t even flinch. He just kept staring right into Lindsay’s eyes, boring into his very soul. Finally, he broke the silence, murmuring out the words “Der Hund wird Sie in sieben Tagen holen”.

After uttering those words, his face went blank, and his eyes clouded over. The man was dead.

“What did he say?” I asked Lindsay, who was still staring directly at the corpse. He didn’t respond. Grabbing his arm, I repeated my question. “Dammit Lindsay, what did he say?”

Shaking his head, Lindsay managed to mutter “He said ‘The Hound will take you in seven days’”. He looked away from the corpse and over to me, giving a desperate half smile. “Bit of an odd one that, innit Philips? Must have- must have been trying to give me a bit of a scare, do you think?”

I nodded, seeing how much this was affecting him. There was this look of real, primal fear on his face. Now of course, I’d seen Lindsay kill people before. He didn’t like it, only someone who was a bit sick in the head could, but I’d never seen him this afraid before.

“Must be some sort of obscure German insult, or maybe he was just starting to lose his head, could be anything really Lindsay, I wouldn’t pay it too much mind” I said, trying to reassure him.

He shook his head and chuckled weakly. “He didn’t lose his head, you halfwit, you and I both know I shot him quite squarely in the chest.”

Laughing, I clapped Lindsay on the shoulder and pulled him off to join the others and figure out our next move. He seemed to be mostly back to his old self for the moment, but whenever he wasn’t talking or cracking jokes I could see this distance in his eyes, like he was still hearing the words that German soldier said to him.

For the next three days, things went largely back to normal, though I could sometimes see Lindsay staring off into space, with an odd look on his face. It sometimes seemed like he was listening to some sound that I couldn’t hear. I assumed he was just in a bit of a funk, combat can do that to a fellow.

It wasn’t until the fourth day that anything actually strange happened. I was having a supper of tinned fish when suddenly Lindsay grabbed me by the arm and pulled me off to one side. I wasn’t particularly upset by this, as the meal was somewhat far from gourmet, but I was rather confused.

“Lindsay, what’s going on old chap, what’s gotten you in such a bother?” I asked, standing my ground and keeping us both in place.

“Listen, Philips, I have to show you something, but,” he looked around, seeming to check if anyone was around to listen, “you have to promise me not to tell anyone. Alright?”  
 

I stared at Lindsay, getting a better look at the expression on his face. He was terrified, and completely serious. I nodded, and he led me to a relatively quiet area of the trench, crouched down, and pointed at the muddy ground.

I followed where his finger pointed and stared for a moment, before I processed what I was looking at. Pressed into the muck were a series of pawprints, each one at least a foot in length, pressing down a good five centimeters or so into the earth. Lindsay and I followed the trail of pawprints until they stopped at one of the trench walls. Peering carefully over the side, we saw the trail continue into the distant treeline.

“What manner of beast could leave prints like that?” I muttered to myself, staring into the distant forest.

Lindsay began to laugh hysterically. “Well this is just bloody brilliant innit? On the one hand you can see the prints too, so I’ve not gone totally barmy, on the other hand there’s a damn hellhound out to get me!”

He began to double over with the intensity of his laughter, whooping and hollering in some sort of mania. I slapped him once or twice to try and pull him together, but it didn’t work, he just kept laughing and laughing. Eventually it grew to be too much for me, and I left him to his madness, storming off to find a dry spot to try and get some sleep. All night long, I could hear him cackling to himself, even over the endless percussion of distant explosions. When I did finally get comfortable enough to get a bit of rest, I dreamt I was being pursued through the trenches by an unseen, enormous hound.

The day after his laughing fit, Lindsay had become very quiet and kept mostly to himself. Everybody had heard him have his breakdown, and most of the lads steered clear of him, worried that he had gotten a bit funny in the head. I suppose I can’t properly blame them, but it still felt bad seeing the poor chap all on his own. I tried to talk to him from time to time, but he just wouldn’t respond, all he would do is stare off into space.

At night, sometimes I would hear distant baying. I prayed that they were only wolves.

It was seven days after the German soldier made his pronouncement when Lindsay finally spoke again. It was late at night, both of us were on watch, sharing a cigarette together in silence. Even if he wouldn’t talk, Lindsay still had enough awareness to smoke.

The artillery seemed to be a bit louder than usual that night, and every so often there would be an explosion out in no man’s land that illuminated the darkness with a fiery explosion. I wasn’t sure what the Germans were doing, but it made me nervous. I kept wondering if the next shell might strike us, that I wouldn’t even have a chance to realize I was going to die before my life ended in a loud bang and a puff of smoke.

Lindsay was staring off into no man’s land when suddenly, very calmly, he pointed out into the distance and spoke a single word.

“Look.”

I looked out where he indicated, straining my eyes in the pitch black of the night. “I don’t see anything” I started to say, when suddenly an artillery shell burst, throwing light upon the scarred landscape.

I saw it.

Standing there, amongst the ruin and madness of mechanized warfare, I gazed upon the Hound. It was as big as a tank and black as smoke, with two burning red eyes gazing hungrily towards us. The thing had to be at least three meters high at the shoulder, but I can’t say for sure. Ivory fangs jutted from its slavering maw, foam dripping from its lips. I felt like a mouse staring into the face of an owl, or a fox gazing down the barrel of a hunter’s gun.

The flash of the explosion lasted only an instant before all was darkness yet again, but even in the blackness I could still see those terrible red eyes, staring towards our trench with an evil, unearthly hunger. I practically fell backwards in terror, all sense of discipline and duty overcome by the sheer horror invoked by that monstrous, infernal Hound.

“Don’t be frightened, Philips. It’s not you it wants,” murmured Lindsay, still gazing out at the Hound. Without another word, he began to climb over the edge of the trench, walking out into no man’s land. He showed no fear, no trepidation. The look on his face was almost one of relief as he vanished into the dark.

I scrambled over to the edge of the trench, not daring to follow him. I called out his name, begged him to come back, but he didn’t even respond. Another explosion, and I saw the silhouette of my friend mere meters away from the Hound, getting down on his knees before it. Its mouth was open now, its slavering maw filled to the brim with daggerlike fangs.

“Lindsay!” I screamed, tears flowing down my face. The brief light from the explosion was swallowed up by the night. I waited for another explosion, each second feeling like hours. Finally, another detonation lit up no man’s land, but there was nothing there. There was no more hound, no more Lindsay, not so much as a corpse or a pile of shredded clothes. In the far, far distance, I could hear a low, savage howl.

Officially, Private Gordon Lindsay deserted the British army. They never found a body, and there was no record of his death, so that would be the natural assumption. But I know the truth. Even now, nearly half a century later, I cannot abide the baying of hounds.

Unlike my great-grandfather’s first encounter, “black dogs” and “hellhounds” are well attested in folklore, with quite a number of sightings all throughout Europe. There are even a few alleged encounters along the Western Front. I looked into official records regarding Private Lindsay’s disappearance, and was able to confirm that he was reported to have deserted the British Army in 1917. Beyond that, the rest is impossible to verify.

When I have time, I shall transcribe and post the final entry of my great-grandfather’s journal.
