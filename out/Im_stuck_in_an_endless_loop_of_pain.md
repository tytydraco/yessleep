When I first moved to Hollow Creek, I was trying to escape the chaos of my past life. My name is Mark, and I had been a journalist, a profession that chewed up my sanity and spat out fragments. The city had consumed me with its ceaseless noise, deadlines, and relentless pressure. Hollow Creek, with its quaint charm and seemingly serene landscape, seemed like the perfect antidote—a place to find peace and start anew.

At first, the town was as picturesque as a painting. The locals greeted me warmly, albeit with an unsettling mixture of friendliness and wariness. The quiet streets, bordered by charming houses and well-kept gardens, promised a life of tranquility. I imagined weekends spent fishing by the lake, hiking in the dense woods, and evenings of solitary relaxation. It seemed idyllic, a far cry from the relentless pace of urban life.

But soon, the veneer of serenity began to crack. I started noticing peculiarities that seemed too unnerving to ignore. It began with small, unsettling signs—strange symbols etched into the bark of trees, cryptic runes that appeared almost overnight. These marks were not merely graffiti; they were complex, disturbing designs that seemed to pulse with a dark energy. I tried to dismiss them as the work of local pranksters, but an undercurrent of dread began to coil in my gut.

The townspeople were friendly but often exchanged furtive glances and whispered conversations that ended abruptly when I approached. The air was thick with secrecy, a palpable tension that made my skin crawl. I was increasingly disturbed by the sensation that I was being watched, scrutinized by unseen eyes.

One evening, I attended a local festival. The decorations were unsettling—dead flowers arranged in bizarre, macabre patterns, and masks with twisted, grotesque features hanging from every surface. The festival’s cheer felt forced, a façade of normalcy masking something more sinister. As night fell, I heard it—a low, rhythmic chanting that cut through the calm of the evening. It was hypnotic yet horrifying, a sound that made the hairs on my neck stand on end.

“What the fuck is that?” I whispered to myself, my voice trembling. Driven by a mixture of curiosity and dread, I followed the chanting into the forest, the beam of my flashlight jittery and unsteady in the oppressive darkness.

The chanting led me to a clearing that was a grotesque tableau of horror. A group of people, cloaked in dark, tattered robes, stood in a circle around a stone altar. Their chanting was a guttural, throbbing murmur that seemed to resonate with a dark force. The altar was smeared with fresh blood, and the remains of a mutilated lamb were spread across it, its entrails dangling grotesquely. The ground was slick with blood and torn flesh, creating a horrifying tapestry of carnage.

My stomach lurched violently. I felt a surge of panic and tried to retreat, but my legs felt like lead. The cultists’ heads snapped toward me with a synchronized motion, their eyes glowing with a predatory intensity. Their chanting grew louder, more frenzied, a deafening roar that seemed to shake the very earth. Their bloodshot eyes locked onto mine, and their movements became aggressive, almost predatory. I turned and fled, the forest a nightmarish blur of shifting shadows and snarling shapes as branches clawed at my face and limbs.

I could hear them behind me, their footsteps pounding the earth with a relentless rhythm, their chanting morphing into a high-pitched, discordant shriek. The forest seemed to close in on me, the trees bending and twisting as if eager to witness my demise. I tripped over a root, crashing into the underbrush. Pain exploded through my body as I scrambled to my feet, only to be met by the oncoming terror of their pursuit.

The pounding continued as I reached my house, slamming the door behind me, my breath ragged and shallow. The force of their assault on the walls was immediate, a relentless barrage of sound. Their chants had become a cacophony of rage and hatred that seemed to vibrate through the very walls of my home. I threw every piece of furniture I could find against the door and armed myself with a kitchen knife, its blade glinting dully in the dim light. The house groaned and creaked with every impact, every whisper of wind outside feeling like an omen of the impending doom.

The pounding intensified, merging into a deafening roar. I sat huddled in the corner of my living room, the knife trembling in my grip. Hours passed in a haze of fear and adrenaline. Eventually, the noise stopped, replaced by an eerie, oppressive silence that was almost worse. I sat in the darkness, every creak and gust of wind outside making me flinch. Exhaustion eventually overwhelmed me, and I fell into a fitful sleep, plagued by nightmares of robed figures and blood-soaked altars.

When I awoke, the morning sun cast a false sense of normalcy over the house. The night’s terror felt like a distant, horrific dream. The town was as it had been, the residents going about their daily routines with unnerving ease. The clearing was pristine, untouched by the previous night’s horrors. I tried to convince myself it had all been a vivid hallucination, but a nagging fear lingered.

As I began to clean up the mess, I noticed something disturbing—an elaborate, grotesque symbol had appeared on the front of my house. It was a sickening, abstract design, etched into the wood of the doorframe. The symbol was a twisted amalgamation of shapes and lines, a visual representation of horror. It seemed to pulse with a malignant energy, an unspoken threat. I tried to dismiss it, but the fear it evoked was palpable.

The horrifying cycle continued. Each night, as darkness fell and the chanting began anew, I ventured into the forest, finding scenes more grotesque than the last. The blood on the altar was fresher, the mutilations more severe. The cultists’ aggression escalated with each encounter. They began using crude weapons, their blows leaving deep, gaping cuts and searing burns on my flesh. The sacrifices grew increasingly depraved, with the altar adorned with grotesque, dismembered body parts. The stench of death and decay was overwhelming, a miasma that clung to me long after I escaped.

One night, they caught me again. The robed figures were now smeared with blood, their faces hidden in shadowy hoods. They dragged me to the altar, the ground slick with gore, and the stench of rot overwhelming. The cultists’ chanting was a frenzied roar, mingled with the agonized screams of their sacrifices. Their eyes blazed with a malevolent fire, and their movements were wild and frenzied. They began to beat me, their blows savage and unrelenting. I fought back desperately, but their strength was overwhelming. I managed to escape once more, but my body was a grotesque mosaic of cuts, bruises, and broken bones.

Each return to my house revealed a new, more elaborate symbol etched into its surfaces. The symbols became increasingly disturbing, reflecting the escalating violence and depravity of the cult’s rituals. They seemed to pulse with a malevolent life of their own, a visual manifestation of my suffering. The marks spread across my house, each symbol more intricate and horrifying than the last, creating an unsettling tapestry of torment.

Despite the growing brutality and the eerie symbols, I felt compelled to continue my nightly ventures. I was driven by a desperate need to understand and escape, but every time I thought I had found a way out, the cycle would reset. I would find myself back in my house, facing another night of terror.

As I write this, my house is covered in symbols that seem to writhe and pulse with an unearthly energy. The townspeople’s eyes now hold a knowing, sinister glint, a mix of pity and malevolence that deepens my paranoia. Each night, the cycle of horror and bloodshed continues, and I am trapped in an unending loop of terror. The town’s façade of normalcy is a cruel illusion, hiding a malevolent force that I can never escape.

I am haunted by the fear that has become my constant companion, a relentless presence that taints every waking moment and every dream. Hollow Creek, with its deceptive tranquility, has become my personal hell—a place where reality and nightmare intertwine, and escape is a distant, cruel illusion. The darkness of the town has seeped into my very soul, leaving me a prisoner of my own mind and the unrelenting horror of the night.

I don't know what's happening. I’m stuck in this endless cycle of pain and terror, unable to discern whether I am going mad or if this is actually happening. Someone, please, send help. I don't know how much longer I can endure this relentless nightmare.
