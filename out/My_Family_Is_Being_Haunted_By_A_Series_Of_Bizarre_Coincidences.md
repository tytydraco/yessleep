I can’t speak for all the stories on here, but this one is real. It happened to me when I was fifteen and has stuck with me ever since. As a kid, I had a few brief supernatural experiences that I always passed off as paranoia or hallucinations. Sometimes I would see things out of the corner of my eye or feel something brush against the back of my shoulder, but it never fully convinced me of anything paranormal.

After my parents divorced, my dad moved into a small apartment complex, and my mom moved in with her new boyfriend and his children. We all got along well enough, but as we grew older, we drifted apart.

Before I continue, I need to provide some context. My mom was in the army before I was born, and luckily she survived with no serious injuries. Since then, she has continued supporting the military through donations and events. It was a huge part of her life, and I think some of her dedication came from wanting to honor her father.

Her father, my grandpa Charles, enlisted in the army when my mom was seventeen and died in war. I never met him, and I don’t know much about him, but I doubt that matters for this story.

About three years after the move, I was entering my freshman year of high school and in a really bad place mentally. The homework was overwhelming, and family fights had left me tense and drained.

One Friday night, I was staying up late, watching movies and eating junk food. It was just before 2 AM when I got thirsty. I got up and walked to the fridge without turning on the lights since I knew the layout of the house so well.

I filled my red plastic cup at the water dispenser when I heard a faint, terrible screech from the darkness to my left, where the living room was. It was subtle but disturbing, like the sound your couch makes when its wooden frame scrapes the floor. I turned my head but told myself it was nothing. I have three dogs, so it could have been one of them.

Still, I felt a chill. I decided to leave before my cup was even full. I took a few steps when I heard a raspy, human cough. My heart dropped. We didn’t live in the safest area, and the thought of an intruder terrified me.

I turned around instinctively and froze. Standing in the living room was a man with a prickly beard, tired eyes, and his mouth slightly open. He didn’t look ghostly or supernatural. He looked real. And then it hit me. That man was my dead uncle. He had died in a hiking accident earlier that year. I felt chills crawling over my entire body. I didn’t scream, but I was terrified.

After that, everything gets a little hazy. I remember walking back to my room quickly and locking the door. I tried to watch more movies, but I stayed awake all night, shaken.

I told very few people what I saw, and they all suggested it was just lighting tricks or my imagination. I forgot about the incident until a few weeks ago, when I went to a diner with my mom. I’m in my early twenties now.

We were eating and chatting when a man walked past us. He had a camo jacket with a “Veteran” badge pinned to his shirt. My mom said “thank you for your service,” and he smiled and nodded as he passed. She turned to me with tears in her eyes and said he was her father. She didn’t say he looked like him. She said it was him. She was overwhelmed, and we left the diner quietly.

At home, she tried to find a photo of her father, but there were none clear enough to show me. I can’t say if it was a coincidence, but it felt eerie.

Then, just this morning, something happened that cemented my unease. I was making breakfast when I heard it again, a faint but chilling screech right behind me. I turned around and saw nothing.

Some may say it’s just a strange coincidence. I wish I could believe that. But I have a feeling it’s something more, something I can’t explain.
