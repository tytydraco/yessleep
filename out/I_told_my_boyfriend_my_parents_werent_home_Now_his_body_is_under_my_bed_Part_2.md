I could always turn off my nightmares.  Most people dream with a less active prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that helps them make logical decisions and control their impulses.  That’s why a building in a dream can feel like your school, your house, and the beach at the same time, or why you might actually act on that intrusive thought that forced itself into your mind.  The part of the brain that makes sure reality is working right is taking a nap of its own, though it can start to wake up.

Whenever it did for me, I could tell how messed up whatever scenario my own mind was throwing at me was.  Usually, this involved a swarm of wasps crawling over my body or getting lost in the woods and knowing something was about to jump out from behind a tree.  My therapist keeps telling me there is probably some deeper meaning to that, but he doesn't know I haven't dreamt about things that normal in a long time.  Whenever a nightmare reached that point, I balled my fists, tensed my body, and felt the falling sensation of my on-demand hypnic jerk bring me back to the waking world.

I repeated this action.  Then again.  Then again.  Then again.  Over and over for what must have been hours.

It didn’t work.

When my brain finally accepted that I wasn’t going to get out of this nightmare, I tried to turn over to see my clock.  My only sources of light were its faint blinking, what little light shined under my doorframe, and the occasional lightning flash in the distance.  I perched myself onto my elbow to turn when a heavy, slithering force pushed against my back through the mattress.  Fear froze me in place while I waited for what came next.

“This is it,” I thought.  “I’m gonna die.”

A red 2:45 blinked on the clockface.   I didn’t know if it was actually that time or if it had just been that long since the power came back on.  Not that any of that mattered anymore.  As far as my loved ones knew, my time of death would be unknown.

Something tugged against my bed sheets.  The movement of the bed caused me to fall onto my back, my hands gripping the fitted sheet, while the blankets slowly slid over me.  If I had been wrapped up tighter, whatever the thing beneath me was may have pulled me in like a fish caught in a net.  My blankets were pulled off the side to my right, facing my window.  They were pulled down the same way Logan had been.

The movement stopped when something tugged against my left thigh.  Part of the sheet must have rolled up and stuck beneath me when I laid back down.  The thing pulled again, each time a bit harder.  I tried to raise up my left side to let the fabric go, but the added pressure on my right must have disturbed it more.  The siren shriek came once again from below me.  My body clenched and I stared at the ceiling while my ears started to ring.  I thanked God at least this time it was quieter.

There was some more movement under me.  The weight that was pressed up to my back slowly shifted until I couldn’t feel it anymore.  Through the dissipating ringing and the sound of rain, I heard something heavy drag closer to the bloody right side of my bed.  I turned my head slightly in its direction.

Up from the floor, rising out of the darkness, was a hand.  My heart wanted to sing thinking that Logan was lifting himself back up, still alive after what was nothing but a nasty fall.  That hope turned to fear when it got closer.

There was barely enough light to make out its silhouette at first.  It definitely had what looked like five fingers, but they weren’t oriented right.  On a human hand, the thumbs sit lower to the side, the placement showing if the hand is the right or the left.  This hand was perfectly symmetrical.

It started moving towards me, the thumbs or pinkies or whatever they were spreading out like the legs of a tarantula.  The arm beneath moved up past what should have been its elbow, but there was no joint, just a continuous mass that hovered and curved like a serpent coiling through water.  Drops of warm, foul liquid fell from the fingertips as it moved directly over me.

The hand lowered over my stomach and I sucked in as much as I could to avoid being touched.  It brushed against the sheets over me and closed its grip, the sharp nail of the middle finger slowly scraping against my stomach.  A scream grew in my throat, barely stifled by my fear of what would happen if I made a sound.  My skin burned like the tip of a white-hot needle was being dragged against me while a thin line of blood grew across my abdomen, but it didn’t seem to notice or care.  It slowly started to pull away at my sheets and I managed to raise my side up just enough to let them free.

A bolt of lightning illuminated the thing.  Ashen scales ran the whole length, showing through streaks and spatters of scarlet.  Crimson completely covered the hand, the dark color of the beast stained red in Logan’s blood.

The light didn’t last long before the pop of thunder sounded from outside.  At the sound, the thing writhed and quickly snatched the remainder of my blankets down to the floor, leaving nothing on the bed except me, my pillows, and a light red trail where the blood had seeped through.  The thin streak of my own growing across my stomach fell to my side and joined with Logan's on that stained trail.  I felt that demon stir beneath me until the roll in the air finally stopped.

That night was the longest of my life.  Our phones were still down in the basement, and, even if I could get a hold of them, Mom and Dad were still hours away.  Clover would occasionally claw at the door and whimper.  She must have been hungry and needed to go.  I felt the same way, but there was no way I could reach her.  She was over on the shore and I was stuck in a raft with no paddle.  Whatever was in the water could drag me down to the depths if I put so much as a hand over the edge.  The thing would occasionally adjust itself when she whimpered, but thank God it never surfaced.

“You can come up here whenever you want,” I thought.  “Why don’t you just get it over with all ready?”

The only response it gave was a loud snap followed by slow, wet smacks.  I sobbed silently while Logan’s body was dragged around beneath me.  The smell alone was enough to make my wounded stomach wretch and the cracking hit me harder than a bolt of lightning ever could.  I almost would have preferred hearing the sounds of a struggle.  At least then I would know he was alive and fighting, but the beast just continued its meal, only occasionally stopping when the sky roared again.

The sun was up before it was finished.  Storm clouds still filled the sky and the rain wasn’t letting up, but at least I could finally see.  My floor by my window was soaked in a combination of rainwater and other fluids I’d hope to never see again.  It moved around beneath me, the corners of my sheets occasionally getting knocked out just enough for me to see.  With its meal finished, it must have been making its bed out of mine.

I tried moving a bit.  It didn’t seem to react as strongly when I put pressure down, but the low start of its wail stopped me from trying anything.  Nothing was stopping it from tearing me apart too.  If this thing was some kind of animal, maybe it was just keeping me there as its next prey once it was finished digesting its last meal.

“I’m so sorry I told you to come here, Logan.  At least you’re not hurting now.  You don't deserve this.”  I tried to comfort myself with thoughts of Logan entering the pearly gates, Jesus wiping his last agonized tears away.  I still believe that’s where he was, where he is. I have to.  It's what he deserved.

The storm was growing worse.  Lightning cracked again, much closer now, and the monster kicked something out from under the bed.  It smacked underneath my window and splashed in the vile puddle.  An arm, elbow down with strips of flesh missing and a splintering radius and ulna exposed, laid on my floor.  Five fingers, thumb to the side.  That right hand had caressed my skin a few hours ago, but there it was now, a chunk of leftover scraps.

That was my fault.  That was what I deserved.

Dad always told our congregation that the good news of the Gospel, a redundant phrasing I would point out to his annoyance, was that God did all the hard work for us.  The only part we played in our own salvation was the sin that made it necessary.  He talked about how the Lord was patient with our mistakes, didn't treat us like we deserved with our sin, and always gave second chances.

But then, there was Ananias and Sapphira.  

Dad said God never changed, but there was one time in the New Testament, barring the bowls of wrath and judgment in Revelation, when ‘Old Testament God’ showed up.  

“Be careful and sincere with your promises,” he told us during a service a few years ago, putting on his signature preacher voice.  “Give a simple yes or no.  Sam promised to not leave Frodo, and he meant it.  Hopefully none of you will have to carry your friend up a volcano, but you never know.”

He chuckled a bit at his own joke with a few pity laughs from the audience.  I just shook my head, but Logan told me later he thought it was “both a hilarious and heartwarming reference.”  I can't imagine how many times he’d have made me rewatch those movies by now if he were still here, but I wish I had a number.  I would have counted every one.

“Remember Ananaias and Sapphira,” Dad said, now in a lower, serious tone, “a husband and wife who told the disciples they would willingly sell a field and give all the money to help the church.  They sold the field, gave the money, and do you know what happened?”

There were some hushed whispers in the pews.  I just shook my head.

“Dead.  Bodies dropped straight to the floor.”

The crowd went silent at the mention of death.  Dad let it linger in the air before continuing.

“The same way He destroyed the world in the flood.  The same way He rained fire on Sodom and Gomorrah.  The same way He struck down those who touched the Ark of the Covenant and entered the Holy of Holies, no face melting needed.  The ‘Old Testament God' who never changes.”

Visions of fire and water and blinding light filled my imagination.  Pain filling the world, even by the piercing of wrists and feet and sides.  The kind of death for the selfish, for the lustful, for the proud, and for the liars.

A checklist I now believe describes me to a perfect T.

“But what did these two do, these Christians offered salvation by the blood of Christ?” he asked, and I wanted an answer.  “They lied to the Holy Spirit and kept some money for themselves.  Now, don’t twist my words or the Word of God.  It was never about the money, and I don't care what you put in the offering plate.  They could have said they’d just give half, or a quarter, or just a coin, or even absolutely nothing and everything would have been just fine.  Instead, they lied and said they would give everything, even swearing they did when Peter asked.  They got one chance to admit it, but neither did.”

He sighed, looked at me, and then back to the room. 

“We all get second chances,” he told us, “but that doesn’t mean we always get one more.  You’ve gotta make every decision count, because they all do.  One day, God’s gonna give us one last shot at life, and we won’t even know it.”

Thunder boomed again and I felt the beast flail.  I didn't and still don't know exactly what it was.  Part of me wants to believe it was some mutated animal or I was having a psychotic break, but I don’t think it was anything as earthly as that.  Maybe it really was a demon in hiding because the lightning splitting the sky sure looked like ‘Old Testament God’ was right outside my window.

When there was finally a lull in the storm, it reached out its impossibly long appendage and tried to grab Logan's arm.  It moved slowly, like little me trying to reach into the cookie jar without Mom noticing.  Lightning struck again and it recoiled back without its prize, and I thanked God that at least it wouldn't get to have all of him.

“I’m sorry,” I prayed.  “Please, just take Logan home.  He’s with you, Father.  I know he is, but please just make it stop.”

It wasn’t fair.  It was my fault.  All of it.  Logan should’ve been miles away from there, pretending to lose at mini-golf just to see his stupid girlfriend smile, not be torn to pieces on her floor.  He told me he’d pick me up that morning, but I was the one who told him to come over.  He just kissed me, but I pulled him in for more.  He could’ve stayed downstairs, but I was the one who wanted to come up here.  He could have kept the window shut, but he knew how much I loved the rain.  He did everything for me, but it was me that got him killed.

“Please, just kill me too.”

I thought I got my request when the siren sound started again.  The thing beneath me churned.  It was awake.  This had to be it.  One second I’ll be here, and the next I won’t be.  I’d never get to tell Mom and Dad how sorry I was for lying to them.  I’d never get to tell Logan’s parents how I’d gotten their son killed.  With what I’d done, I’d probably never even get to tell Logan how sorry I was for everything.

It took me a moment to realize where the sound was coming from.  The blaring noise I heard wasn’t coming from under the bed, not yet, but from outside.  Rain turned to hail that beat the house, shards of ice flying through my window and pelting my bare skin.  Trees of bolts arched everywhere, giving light to a sickly green sky that got darker by the moment.

I could see the funnel cloud meet the Earth at the edge of our field.  The demon beneath me screamed its challenge to the sirens in the sky.  One way or another, I knew my punishment would be death.
