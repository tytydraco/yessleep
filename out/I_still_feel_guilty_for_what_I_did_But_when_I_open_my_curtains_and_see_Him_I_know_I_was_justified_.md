When I was a little girl, I used to hate going out into the country. And, well, I grew up in a small town in Iowa, so when I say “country,” I mean the real country, you know - the dirt roads, the endless fields of feed corn, I mean you could drive for miles and never see another soul. 

That’s the part that scared me. Sometimes when I was in the truck with my dad, I’d close my eyes when we passed over a hill, ‘cause I was convinced that there’d be nothing on the other side, and we’d just be forgotten, our existence never thought of again. 

I think it was my first year of high school when my mindset changed. I grew up religious, as pretty much every kid in the rural midwest does. We were Southern Baptist Christians, which is pretty much the same thing as regular Baptist Christians, except there’s more singing and worshiping, all that. Instead of a choir and little three-fold pamphlets with lyrics on them, my church had a big screen TV with words to new-age songs that updated in real time while our pastor in skinny jeans strummed along with an acoustic guitar. I don’t think it was the old folks’ cup of tea, but they nodded along to the beat, sometimes even clapping their hands. Most of ‘em probably knew Pastor Ben since he was a baby, so there was a nostalgia factor there, I think. 

I know the whole gimmick worked on us younger kids, we were really into the new “grass-roots Christianity” vibe, I mean, I stayed with the church up until my senior year, so something had to be working, I don’t know. It’s been a couple years now since I’ve stepped away from it all, but I digress.

Dad had gotten busy with paperwork, and needed someone to run fencing wire out to his contractors. He and a couple of guys built cattle fencing, you know? But business wasn’t going great, so he started to have me help. I was free labor, and maybe it was good driving practice for me. Somewhere along the way I began to fall in love with the empty countryside I used to dread. I started actively volunteering to go rather than just doing so out of obligation to him. 

I still was scared of breaking down somewhere and being forgotten of course, but there was sort of a freedom that came with “falling in between the cracks.” The farther out I went, the less “watched” I felt, like I could unfold my prayer-hands for a second and breathe. It wasn’t that I was tired of the church, no. High school me would have been horrified to be accused of that. I just always felt an immense amount of guilt, I think. It was worse when I was in town. Hyper-aware of my actions and if they were God-serving. I always had to remember to dress modestly, keep my thoughts pure. 

I prayed for forgiveness every night, for the sins I had committed that day, like eating the bigger piece of pie, or not finishing all my chores, rushing through my homework, just real mundane stuff like that. Do you know how crazy it is to be constantly worrying about every minute detail of your life? I don't think that was the intended purpose of the sermons, to get you to worry about every little thing, I mean. 

I couldn't help it though. We always talked about such polarities like heaven and hell, and with me in my teen years, living out in the fields, there was nothing really else of substance. So my life was tied to those monoliths in a way. I mean of course it was! When everyone else around you believes this and your social standing and friendships and worth as a woman of God is tied to how good you are and how modest and humble and selfless you can be, of course it would be!

 …Sorry.

We talked about “God’s Plan” often. Like at the memorial service for my mom, Pastor Steve said that it was all in God’s Plan. That he had “called on her,” or something like that. It was a long time ago, before high school. Now, as an adult, I imagine “God’s Plan” is an easy blanket excuse for everything that happens in life. Sort of a failsafe for when a big tragedy happens, that way no one can say “oh where was God?” “It's in his plan!” But at the same time, it works as a saying for blessings too, like the birth of a baby, or a wedding. “It’s God's plan!” Sort of genius, honestly. 

In Sunday school, after my mom had passed, I had asked the terribly hard question of “what happens if you don't follow His plan?” It was one of those moments you distinctly remember from childhood for some reason. Ironically, I think the only reason I retained this one for so long isn’t ‘cause of the gravity of the question and the severity of the answer, but because there was a spider crawling across the floor when I asked. I watched it maneuver over the carpet as Mrs. Beas lost her words for a moment.

She eventually found a rubber band, and, after some hesitation, explained to me that God’s Plan is flexible, but, if you go too far from his agenda, the band will snap back, keeping you within the circle. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is - that's why I started to love the country. Because, even with all my guilt and worrying over how to be a good Christian, the further out I drove, the less I felt gripped by the looming hands of heaven and hell. I was skirting the edge of the rubberband. Testing the waters, in a sense. It wasn't a sin realized enough to cause my guilt to spike when I returned home, I think it was more of a subconscious thing I was doing. Kinda like the idea that if you don't really think about something before you do it, it takes away a bit of the responsibility. 

I don't know, maybe that's just a “me” thing. I wasn't really thinking at all when I took a wrong turn onto an unlabeled street, one of the ones that didn't show up on Google Maps. It wasn't an anomaly or anything, back then I don't think Google was nearly as detailed as it is now, and with us being out in the middle of nowhere, I kinda understood how the satellites could miss a thing or two. 

It was weird though, ‘cause it wasn't just that the street didn't show up on Maps, my ping was in the middle of a blue dot. A lake. Again, not anything to be alarmed over, right? We were out in the country and satellites can be wrong, it's hard to triangulate someone's exact location, or however all that works. 

But I mean, the more I looked around at the landscape, the more I could see that maybe I really was in the middle of a lake. A dried out lake, with a non-existent road running through it. I had already slowed the truck down to a crawl, aware of my missed turn, but I didn't really wanna go back just yet. 

It was early spring, and we had a pretty mild winter the months before, so it's not like the lakebed was muddy or anything. The ground was cracked in little uneven hexagons and squares. I made a note to be careful not to twist my ankle in the wider ones as I got out of the truck. 

The severity of my missed turn really became apparent when I saw that the tire tracks over the fractured ground stopped under the vehicle. There really wasn't a road, I was forging my own. I know it was a stupid mistake, and yeah it's like, how did I even get here? But it was so strange.

Trees circled the bed, all gnarly and old. They all had new spring buds on them, but I mean, you could tell it was still early spring ‘cause the undergrowth was still brown and dry. Black branches divided the sky, like veins kinda. And it was really quiet, save for the “caw” of some crows. 

I know this is weird to say, because I’d lived hand-in-hand with the outdoors all my life, like, I'm really familiar with the seasons and how they change, but I'd never been somewhere quite so… isolated. 

Not in like, the “absence of people,” kind of way, I was used to that. But more like, the “absence of life.” Like God had forgotten about this place, forgot to add animals and a sense of like, reality, maybe.

I felt myself at the very edge of the rubber band, not yet stretching it, but enough to touch the wall without sin. Weird, how you make unspoken rules in your own life. I think it starts when you're at church, and they tell you not to do a list of things, “sins.” And then, after following the invisible tally sheet in your head, I feel like you start making more. More rules, more guilt. But here, out in the middle of nowhere, the lake without water, the “Willow Slough,” I started calling it, I felt nothing. A hole in the blanket of shame every church-goer carries. It was my salvation.

At the end of my junior year, Pastor Ben proposed to me. He said that “God had brought us together.” My dad was supportive of the union, even though it was a bit of a shock. We’d been dating for only a few months. He was single and I was, well I was pretty. And I mean I’d see him every Sunday, preaching to the youth group about “purity” and the “household structure.” I remember he put this little infographic up on the television screen, it was clipart of an umbrella, but with three, progressively smaller umbrellas beneath each preceding one, all attached to the same handle. The biggest, topmost umbrella was labeled “God.” The one beneath that, labeled “Husband,” followed by “Wife,” and then lastly, the little “u-shaped” handle was labeled “Children.” He went over the hierarchy of the image, how God is supposed to watch over the household, and the husband listens to, and implements his will onto the family, which were the wife and kids. Ben had meant my eyes when he said “wife,” and I smiled and turned away. I was so smitten with him then, when I was younger. The whole church knew we were gonna get together, and we dated for a few months, before he popped the question, like I said. 

We never “slept” with each other or anything like that. There’s a joke I’m aware of - now that I’m out of the church - where Christians all get married quickly so they can have sex without sinning. Maybe that was Ben’s motive, I don’t even know at this point. But anyways, we rarely kissed either, it was only like a quick peck on the cheek after dinner and a movie. Sometimes he’d sing to me, play me his guitar. He was sweet, and I felt a sense of superiority over the other girls in youth group, ‘cause I was dating Pastor Ben. That was like - big brownie points in the church. 

I remember the Sunday after he proposed, he played the song he had written for me in front of the entire congregation. Everyone swooned, husbands held their wives, rocking back and forth while kids ran between the aisles of chairs. I was awestruck by him, you know. But in that moment, with all the noise and chatter, I could only think back to my lake bed, Willow Slough.

I’d started going there a lot after I’d first discovered it. Dad didn’t mind when I got back from a delivery a little later than normal. Sometimes I’d drive the work truck right out into the middle of the bed, crawl out and sit on the hood, and just let all my guilt pour out of me. It was like the lack of water in the crater begged to be filled. Whether by physical means, or mental. God, I had a lot of the “mental” category back then. Ben and his skinny jeans were wrapped around my cranium like a tourniquet. It was like I was living my entire life under a spotlight. The church all had their eyes on me, the perfect fiancee of our small town Jesus. And even when I was alone, in my room, I knew God was watching too. I never closed my curtains in that bedroom, for fear of being rude. But sometimes I’d swear I’d wake up to see Him staring at me. A deadly indifference in his eyes, a silence worth a thousand words. I desperately wanted to be told I was doing a good job, that I was pure, virtuous, that all my efforts to live a life like Jesus were fruitful.

The silence I found at Willow Slough, however, was different. Instead of God’s restless gaze upon me, I could only hear the sound of my own breathing, the gentle whisper of the leaves as a gust of wind circled into the sky. God couldn’t see me here, or at least, he wasn’t watching. An unrendered space or a gap in the cameras, the profoundly simple nature of the trees, long, black hands reaching out to me. Begging me to let go, to fade away into this hole in reality. 

I mentioned I’m in college now, right? Out of Iowa, thank God. And well, I needed an extra few credits for this semester, and decided to take an online course. It doesn’t really have anything to do with my major, and frankly, I thought it’d be easy, something I could do late at night and just really skirt the borders, dance on the deadline. I like to do that. Anyways - the class turned out to be more than I was expecting, but it’s been real interesting. The other day we talked about our tendency towards self-destruction, just, you know, like as a species. No other animal on earth would actively work to hinder their own growth, but we do. It’s like sentience is a curse. We’ve got all this potential and all these possibilities, but some of them end in failure. We get caught, we forget our lines, we’re not strong enough or not smart enough, or we’re killed by just pure dumb luck. And because we’re such a developed species, because we can contemplate all the heavens and hells of our minds, we’ve decided, as a collective, to not even try at all. Because if you don’t try, you can’t fail. If you simply sit and vegetate and barely ever move, the risks of disappointment are near none. 

It’s kinda like how a rabbit freezes up when they think they’re in danger. The antithesis of fight or flight. If you don’t run, there’s never the fear of being caught. And if you don’t fight, you don’t have to worry about missing your shot or getting hit by a killing blow. Simply standing and, well, fading away is the far safer option. You can simply let the adrenaline just run out of you in that cold rush while you sit, instead of your heart pounding so heart it bursts out of your ribcage as you run. But I mean, rabbits freeze for survival. Like I said, we’re the only species that just… gives up. We freeze ‘cause to survive is to try, and that’s scary.

I mean, think - the turn of your head away from danger while running, only to look back and see that the threat is right behind you. I think we, the collective, think it’s better to stare it right in the face, and lay down, and die. Because then we maintain some form of control, we aren’t taken by surprise when we look back and see the gained ground. We can stare death in the face and watch the slow crawl as it comes to steal us away, informed of its every move. Sometimes, we even close the gap. Killing our attachment to reality before it can kill us. Hence, why we self-destruct. A lack of control, the fear of failure. 

That’s probably why my mom took her life. I didn’t figure out the true cause of her death ‘til - well - I’ll get to that. I had come to the realization on my own, rather than dad telling me or anything. We don’t talk much anymore, me and my dad. I imagine now that my trips to Willow Slough were the first few steps into the spiral my mom had gone down. Fading away from reality, desperately giving up before facing a far more terrifying fate. Don’t get me wrong! I talk as if I resent her, I don’t! Well, maybe a little, but I also understand why she did what she did. I mean, I think I probably made it obvious how much my class has affected me, it’s really got me thinking. We self-destruct to escape reality, to retain control. And I think the vague antagonist of “reality” is to blame. However that may manifest itself. 

Like I said, the early stages of my spiraling were spent at Willow Slough, but soon enough, I wasn’t alone in my trips there. One day, I had pulled into the lake bed with the work truck. There were little flashes of sunlight bouncing off the visor, reflected from the diamond on my finger. It felt silly, now, as I saw a group of high schoolers in my spot on the lake bed. Out-of-towners, I’d never seen them before.

They were doing normal high school things, a beer in their hands, and a joint in the other. They’d pulled folding chairs up, positioned in between the cracks in the long-dry mud. A cooler brandished a Bluetooth speaker, and they were chuckling, throwing rocks, and I was, well, engaged. Sometimes I mourn what could have been of my childhood, and I thank God for the moment I started to live. 

They all looked at me as I pulled the vehicle up, at first, their eyes were full of that “oh shit, we’ve been caught,” kinda look. I think the work truck has that vibe. But when I hopped out, a real country girl, their expressions changed to interest, and confusion. 

I was too polite back then to tell them that the Willow Slough was my spot. In fact, I don’t really know what my plan was after I turned off the truck and jumped out. When they greeted me with a “hey,” I just replied, “whatcha smoking?” God, I thought I was the Christian police. I didn’t intend to take a hit from the joint when they handed it to me, in fact, I considered dropping it down into one of the cracks in the dust. But that act of angelic stupidity would extend God’s influence to my safe haven. I’d still be Pastor Ben’s fiancee, even here. I swear a ghostly apparition of Nan from church could appear, placing my arms straight down by my thighs, fingers pointed, to ensure my shorts weren’t too short. I took the hit.

When I coughed, for about a few minutes, it seemed, I thought back to Sunday school. Mrs. Beas had turned off the lights in our classroom, put red gift bag paper over the windows, and brought in a space heater, cranked up to maximum. She put some God-forsaken CD in the stereo, playing moans and wails of the damned. 

“This is only a sliver of what Hell is like.” She had said.

“If you pray, and remain pure for God, you will gain salvation.”

Then all of us kids sat on the carpet and prayed in that hot-as-hell room. She came around to each of us one by one, asking us to recite a bible verse or two from last week’s lesson. If we remembered it correctly, her husband came into the room, dressed as a knock-off angel, and pulled us into the hallway outside. One-by-one. Salvation. 

After I had stopped coughing, I handed the joint back to one of the high-schoolers. I’d held it a bit too long and the cinders burnt the tips of my fingers. They laughed at me but not in a patronizing way. A girl stood up from a folding chair and offered me her seat. I took it. We talked about school, and life, and I tried a beer for the first time, the taste bitter against my virgin tongue. One of the boys asked if I was seeing anyone, and I said no, twisting my engagement ring around my finger.

I felt a buzz growing in my head, probably a mix of the booze, the weed, and the litany of terrible sins I’d just committed. But we were in the deadzone, God didn’t patrol this area. His angels could not fly here, and yet I still felt the heat of hell on my back, the sun. The space heater Mrs. Beas had dragged into the room. And I turned to look at it, telling myself I’d never allow my eyes to leave the danger, lest I’d lose control. And this, this was my first taste of it.

I hate the methods that push us to such extremes, that cause us to eat away at our own flesh and give up. We’d be able to live freely if we had control in the first place, if failure had no foothold in our lives. But we’re all trapped, really. Chain-link fences of fear, or barbed-wire that wraps around our throats until we suffocate and die, like one of the cows my dad works so hard to keep in line. I felt my enclosure stretching, now. The rubber band, finally lengthening out to live up to its name. I knew God would snap me back eventually, after I’d smoked my weed and drank my beer, flirted with boys that weren’t Pastor Ben. And my eyes were never removed from the danger, no. But this time, hell was on the outside of my cage, and my hunter was on the inside with me, saying “come to me, child.” And Jesus bore his fangs.

I think I was so scared of being forgotten as a little girl, because I wasn’t aware of the nuances of life. I had everything to live for, and no expectations set for me. But months after I’d meant these high schoolers in my little spot of the lake, a senior in my own school now, I begged to fade away. To simply transcend my cell like my mom did when she killed herself. I didn’t want to die, but I wanted my control back, my autonomy. I kissed my out-of-town boy in the back of my dad’s work truck sometimes. He was my age, and held me like Dionysus does wine, instead of how a politician holds a bible when the cameras are rolling. I had ripped a bong for the first time, weeks before this. And once, me and my new high school friends had set up our chairs around my battery-powered DVD player, and watched Legally Blonde as I had never seen it before.

The screen was small but my heart felt huge. I had to stuff it back down into my ribcage when I’d return home, hiding my awful hedonism from my family. Pastor Ben’s modest kiss on the cheek felt like a mosquito bite after dinner. The wedding would be soon, after I graduated. I couldn’t help but giggle when he’d play me that same damn song he wrote, and instead I was thinking about my out-of-towner’s tongue. 

My immense guilt was often pierced by the crows’ feet forming on my twenty-something fiance’s face. And the rubber band pulled ever farther from my captor. I knew the snap was coming, like the release of a crossbow string, or the leather on the catapult that killed Goliath.

It’s strange, though. I was self-destructing, yes, that’s not even an argument. But I did it in the name of control! I wanted to touch rock bottom simply to say I did it! To rebel against my prison guards, to break free of the barbed wire that held us cows, waiting for slaughter. It was my Christian duty, yes, to lay down and die, give my life willingly to Him. But I didn’t care. 

I lost my virginity in May, a few days before graduation. My high school friends asked if I’d want to have a party down at Willow Slough, and I whole-heartedly agreed, without thinking too much. If I don’t mull it over, I’m not fully responsible - that’s what I thought, then. We lit fireworks off of the lakebed. It was amazing, to watch them soar from the lowest point of land into the sky. I remember we accidentally lit some brush on fire, and my high school sweetheart dumped his beer over it to put it out. We were in a drought, then. I knew he was sober when we made love. I don’t - wanna go into too much detail, but, I was living. His friends had all gone home, and it was just me and him, in the dark. I lost my wedding ring, then. It fell between the cracks in the dusty mud. I didn’t notice it was gone until I’d gotten home. 

Dad usually didn’t mind when I’d get home after dark. He always thought I was out with Pastor Ben. But when I got home that night, Ben and him were sittin’ in the living room, talking over a lamp, sandwich plates stacked on the end table. They turned to me, worry in their eyes. Asking if I had gotten cold feet about the wedding, if the devil was tempting me. I told ‘em no, that I had just gone for a stop at the church, and I needed to pray. Ben said he was just at the church, and didn’t see me. 

The red curtains we had hung up looked mighty similar to Mrs. Beas’ giftwrap. Ben took my hands then, and held them, saying that I’d make a good wife. Until he saw the ring, or lack thereof. Now it was Ben’s turn to pray. My dad pulled me into a room, whispering harshly that I’d have no prospects if I didn’t marry Ben, that I was throwing away a good family, a good community, and that the devil had taken my purity. We needed to find it, we needed to ask God to watch over us.

I shut the curtains in my bedroom that night. My dad searched the work truck for the ring, and found a condom wrapper instead. The rubber band snapped back.

—

We had moved the wedding up a few days, to coincide with my graduation party. The guests viewed it as a pleasant surprise, I mean, the same crowd was gonna attend both, and just thought that Ben and I were young and eager. The night before, Ben and I had kneeled on the steps in front of the aisle, it was dark, the church abandoned on a Friday. A large cross was mounted behind the pulpit. Ben prayed to God in a soft, rushed voice, his hand on my shoulder. It wasn’t a reassuring touch, but a firm one, almost pressing me down into the carpet, fingers digging into my shoulder blade. I thought of the umbrella. 

“I’ll see you tomorrow.” He had said afterwards, leaving me alone in the dark chapel. No mosquito bite, no coy glance, just a cold politeness to his words. I had fallen back into God’s Plan just as I was supposed to, no matter how far I strayed, I was still a slave to the Lord. Prey under the predator’s gaze. I cried, in the church then. Alone, every ounce of worth I once held as a woman stripped away from me. 

It had been raining the past few days, hard. All the farmers talked about how grateful they were, that their crops would love it, an end to the drought, finally. We had the wedding at the church, of course. In our small town it was either that or a backyard wedding, and well, my husband-to-be was a pastor, so, you know.

The sky was dark as I put on my wedding dress in my old Sunday school room. The dress was my mom’s. There was chatter everywhere in the building, people celebrating, munching from the grazing board of tomatoes and cucumbers. I’d forgotten something in the truck outside. I could see where my dad had parked it from the window. I wasn’t allowed to drive the truck anymore for obvious reasons. At some point in my decision making process I had taken the dress off and put my normal clothes back on. I wanted to crawl out the window, and so I did. I know it sounds crazy, but there was a weird buzz in my head, like I used to feel, you know, with my out-of-town friends. 

That’s why I started the truck when I got inside. I don’t think I meant to, but if you don’t think about something before you do it… Well, you know the rest. I just took off. A couple people saw me drive out, it was kind of funny, they’d wave and say hi, and then the recognition took hold in their expression, and they’d turn to look at me. Did the bride just leave? I did, I really did.

I knew where I was going, of course. The windshield wipers squealed as they ripped across the glass. They hadn’t been used to this volume of rain in a while. It was later in the day, like six or seven. And the clouds made it even darker. I didn’t think to turn the headlights on. 

A right, a left, and a right again. Two more lefts, and I was at my slough. The crackle of thunder didn’t subside when the rain did. It was still dark out. I almost submerged the engine as I tried to follow the road I had forged. A lake rippled and curled where my bed had once been. Filled and quenched by the excess of rain. To think, I had once stood at the rock bottom of the lake bed, and now it roared softly, a transient body of water completely unknown to me. 

The lake alone decided where the shore would end. I was fortunate enough to screech to a halt before driving into the depths, without my headlights maybe it was just instinct alone. Did I mention I was crying the whole way here? I don’t really remember at what point the tears started, but when I stopped, my face felt sticky, the taste of salt on my lips.

My Slough was loud, now. Frogs croaked and screamed wildly, the overlap in their vocalizations filling every hole of silence. The bugs sang their mad tune, and the trees’ branches, now covered in leaves, all clattered together. The last few drops of rain washed my tears away as I got out of the car, and walked right up to the new shoreline. I let the ripple of water wet my sneakers, moistening my socks with a cold flash.

Any memory I held of my out-of-towners was now drowned and sunk by the lake. The road I had once forged, washed away completely. Any modicum of creativity or autonomy I held had been completely violated, and I…

Well…

There was a man in the lake. Standing. I couldn't make out any features or anything, He was far enough away that everything about Him kinda faded to one color. The water rose to about His waistline, rippling around Him. His arms were submerged at His sides, beneath the waves. I stood and watched Him for a while, as the rain slowly stopped falling, but the sky remained dark. 

I wanted to call out to Him, to ask who He was. But it felt silly, like calling out to an animal, knowing your voice will either scare it away or agitate it. We stood there, unmoving, for a long while. The sweat dripping down my back was the only thing that brought me back to reality, to question how much time had passed. 

It occurred to me then, how deep the lakebed actually was. Memories flashed of me with my high schooler, or me, laying on the hood of the truck, staring up at the sky. The man wasn't swimming, or treading water. He just stood there, staring at me. Or maybe His back was to me, I couldn't tell. But I do remember distinctly that the walls of the long forgotten shore rose up about ten, fifteen feet from the center of the lake.

It was a slight slope, sure. But that's where He was standing, in the center. Unmoving, just standing. A felt the dreaded rush of adrenaline hit me then. A cold shock of realization that I was not safe. The gap in the cameras had been filled. 

I didn't want to take my eyes off Him. I was so scared that I'd look away, only to turn around and witness something horrible. It occurred to me then that my mother was dead. Like - okay that sounds stupid. I knew she was dead, she’d been gone ever since I was little. But like, I understood what happened. My dad’s half stories of “she had cancer” or “she was a recluse.” All felt patronizing, then. She had killed herself. She was fine, physically, up until my dad found her. I was older then, and I knew what a cancer patient looked like, and it was like I'd finally solved a mystery I didn't even know I was solving. 

He got taller as I mulled this over. I didn't let my eyes off of Him, and He rose, freakishly so. Taller than any man I’d ever seen before. It made sense how He was standing so still earlier. He wasn't swimming in the lake, no. He had fixed Himself on rock bottom. 

I didn't want to freeze, to self-destruct like my mother did. Everything in my body told me to move, to get back to the truck, to do something. But I could only stare as all of the croaks of the frogs and the buzzing of bugs came together into one, perfect harmony. One perfect sound that emanated from His mouth. 

EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

I hated the circumstances that put me in this position, that made me choose between giving up and risking it all. What supreme sadist of torment and blood would ever give us a choice like this? I wanted to live. I was terrified of trying but I wanted to live. My entire life up until this point was just me begging for a shred of control. Like a leper at Jesus’ feet, asking for food. 

I turned, I tore my sight away from Him, and ran back to the truck in a mad frenzy. My foot squelched in the mud as my hands were on the door handle. I felt like a kid running up the basement stairs after turning the light off. 

When I opened the door, the sound stopped, and all the hair on my neck stood on end. You know that feeling when something is inches away from you, and you can feel it instinctually? Like your brain just knows somehow? 

I slammed the door, locking it, and started the car. I was scared to look at Him again, for fear that He may be gone, but no. He had leaned forward an impossible length, so that His face was only a few yards away from the hood, head upturned a little to stare into the windshield.

I turned the headlights on, I didn't think about it, I just did it. And what I saw then, right before throwing the truck into reverse, I mean… I broke the rubber band. 

He was a man, sure. And I don't like to think on it too hard, nowadays it makes my head hurt. But with the soft light that made its way up to His face, I, well, really all I could see was His eyes. And only because of the reflection. It, was more of a reflection than it should have been. I thought of a fish, eyes extending down to the cheeks, long and grotesque, but set off to the sides. There was a solid space in between them, where His nose probably was. They were each as big as my fists, maybe. He blinked, one eye first, and then the other. 

The truck squealed as I pulled it out of there, it was honestly a miracle it didn't get stuck in the mud. I whipped a U-turn, tires ripping through the water as we spun around. The noise started again, but this time, the voices had been handed back to the frogs, and I saw Him stand, through my rearview mirror. It occurred to me that He was only kneeling before. He stood, one, massive leg surfacing from the water, and pushing off the lakebed to make room for the other. He was taller than the trees, taller than the sky. When both legs straightened out and ceased their bending, they brought Him straight up to the clouds. 

Those Dali elephants. That's all I could think of as I left the Slough forever. I don't remember how or when I got home, but when I had service again, my phone blew up with texts and calls from Ben and Dad. I went up to my room, curtains closed, and packed my bags. The rest of the week was a blur to me. I’d called off the wedding and broke up with Ben. My Dad protested, but I went to live with my aunt and uncle in Chicago. Such severe actions of survival once terrified me. But I'd decided to live out of spite for my captors. 

I'm in college now, it's been a few years since all that. Sometimes I see Him watching through my window. I live on the fourth floor, and keep my curtains closed most of the time. My fear of fading away came back, but I feel closer to my child-self than ever. I still resent the circumstances that put people in such conundrums. We shouldn't have to choose between death and failure. But my fear of the former is stronger than the latter, and the beginning of my life had already been taken away from me. I will not surrender the rest of it.
