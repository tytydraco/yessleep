My friends are all calling me paranoid because of my whole situation. 

I mean..I can hardly blame them. Like if a person in your friend group randomly came up to you and started rambling on about mysterious letters you'd think they would be crazy too. 

Hell I probably am going crazy. 

But maybe that's just what “they” want. 

In order to explain everything I'd have to talk about the letters even if I don't want to. I just want a solution because this has to end. 

It all started with the first letter that arrived in a letter;

N 

I was so confused when I got it from my mail slot. It was just a piece of white sheet paper with a red N on it. What was even weird was the little note that was on a different piece of paper. 

“Keep all of the letters they say a message for you” 

I know what you are thinking. “But Matt, why did you keep it instead of throwing it away?”.

Because to me this seemed like the start of a puzzle. Ever since I was a kid I would always immediately point out Waldo or find out who did the crime in whatever Hardy Boys or Detective Brown book that was currently in the library. 

In my mind I felt it as a personal challenge.

Someone that knows that I like puzzles specifically did this. It all made sense. No random person would intentionally send something to me like this unless they were a freak that wanted to mess with me. 

Also my birthday was on the Friday of this week. 

I just thought it would lead me away or catch up for a surprise birthday party.  

“Ok..I'll play along for now” *I secretly mumble though it almost made me feel a little badass like a detective. Even though that's the thrill isn't it. 

I put it in my pocket and just went through my day like normal. 

At night I put the letter paper on my night desk which is where I usually problem solve. I immediately thought there might be another letter in the mail the next day. You could say that I slept peacefully that night almost smiling. 

The next day around the same time I checked the mail again. 

I was correct. 

Another envelope was in it but this time there wasn't another which had me confused but there was a message. 

“Seems that you are back. 

How does it feel now that you are being challenged like this? 

Exciting, right? 

PROBABLY HAVE A FEW IDEAS ON WHAT THIS IS FOR. 

BUT IN ORDER TO HAVE YOUR PRESENT YOUR BIRTHDAY MESSAGE NEEDS TO BE COMPMETED. 

THE NEXT LETTER YOU NEED IS AT RACHEL'S BAKERY. YOU KNOW THE PLACE. SIT ON ONE OF THE TABLES BY THE WINDOW. 

I'M SURE YOU CAN FIND IT. 

GOOD LUCK AND EARLY BIRTHDAY. 

When I told you I had an adrenaline rush my heart was PUMPING. I swear I even felt giddy at that moment. 

So obviously I went by the diner and sat at a table by the window. I was feeling under It in the ridges thinking maybe the letter was hidden there. I ordered food first. I wouldn't want to be seen as weird by the locals before I found out.

When I came up empty I was immediately frustrated. 

There was no letter. 

Why even send me here? What was even the point of that clue? 

While I was in my mad spell I was suddenly jolted by someone gently touching my shoulder. I looked up was surprised to see Erica. She used to be an old classmate when I was in school. One of those popular girl types but wasn't a mean one. 

“Matt is that you? Oh my god its been a while how have you been?!” 

Safe too say that i caught up with her. She seemed to be doing good now for her mid 20's. Said she had became a nurse and was dating a police officer named Jeffrey. 

After eating and catching up we gave each other a small hug before promising to keep in touch more.

I left the restaurant shortly after. 

I was confused. Where was the letter why didn't I find it?

That night I was scrolling through the t.v when a news report stopped me. 

NURSE DIES IN A HIT AND RUN NEAR OCEANWOOD HOSPITAL

The report detaild how Erica was just leaving the hospital since her shift was over and it was night. They show camera footage of the accident. 

You can see Erica's figure walking across the parking lot too her car. You can see her almost holding herself as it was almost certainly cold that night. Suddenly a small black car roars in hitting her full throttle before the news anchor stopped the footage. 

I was shocked. The nice girl that bumped into me at the diner suddenly dead? Just didn't make since. 

I went too bed and safe to say I didn't sleep well. 

Next morning I was still devastated as I did my usual routine. 

When I got to my mailbox and got out the usual magazines and occasional bills I saw it. A different letter. My hands started shaking as I opened it. My mouth slowly hanged open as I read the message. 

SO YOU FOUND THE SECOND LETTER! 

THAT'S RIGHT MATTY IT WAS E! GET IT? AS IN E FOR ERICA…. 

HOW WAS IT CATCHING UP WITH AN OLD FRIEND? 

SHE NEVER ONCE CROSSED YOUR MIND AFTER YOU GRADUATED DID SHE? OF COURSE SHE DIDNT. 

WE ALL DON'T REMEMBER OUR CHILDHOOD FRIENDS AFTER ALL. 

SO NOW YOU GOT TWO PIECES OF THE PUZZLE! 

N AND E!!! 

NEXT CLUE IS TOMORROW! 

HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN! 

My hands were shaking as soon as I read the letter. 

They did this..they killed Erica…she was the second letter? Wait…what does that mean for the third? Did they forget? What kind of game is this… 

As i walked back to my apartment almost shaking I stopped as soon as I looked at my door. 

Taped over my door was another letter. 

V

So now the letters are N E and now V.

On the paper was a little note that was on a pink slip. 

Since you are probably grieving right now I thought I'd just let you have this one easy. Maybe the next one too or I'll probably also just make it more difficult…WHO KNOWS! 

I sat in my apartment on my night desk confused looking at the two papered letters. This can't be one of my friends. I thought. It wouldn't go to this extreme if they were… 

I thought above going to the police. 

But then I thought that they would probably think I was crazy telling them I was tied up in that hit and run. Eirca..poor Erica.. 

That was the second night I had trouble sleeping again.

On the third day I decided to try something. What if I just didn't go to the mail that day.

Which was difficult because I'm one to always stick with routines but I somehow pulled through. I tried to have a normal day and even took a nap for the missed hours of sleep. 

What helped me sleep that night was listening to a noise app that a friend recommended to me a while back. 

Yesterday I felt happy since that Sunday. 

So I did it again. 

I felt actually well rested since this whole thing started. 

So yesterday I went to my mailbox.

I took a deep breath.

Hoping that I wouldn't find what I know would be there. 

Unfortunately I was wrong as I pulled out two letters this time. And they both sounded crazier than the last one.

Here was the first one;

MORNING MATTY! 

I HOPE YOU'RE READY TO PLAY OUR LITTLE GAME AGAIN. 

I'M SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ERICA BUT I NEEDED YOU TO HAVE MORE MOTIVATION TO PLAY YOU SEE! 

SO THIS ONE SHOULD BE REALLY EASY! 

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO TO THIS STREET AND YOU'LL SEE A BOY AND GIRL WITH A LEMONADE STAND!  THE BOY SHOULD HAVE AN EAGLE'S CAP ON HIS HEAD! I REPEAT ON HIS HEAD!! 

THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU A HINT TO THE 4TH LETTER! 

My heart was literally racing. Why did this person want me to meet up with a young boy that barely has any connection to me? Being rational I decided to look up the address that came attached with a note to see what had happened.

I was mortified. 

Apparently after the boy and his sister were closing up their lemonade stand a random stranger in a black car pulled up and went to take the cap from the boy. The report said that the boy was beaten a couple of times before the mysterious person drove away with the hat. 

I was sickened so much I almost puked. But I know I had to read the next message. 

MATTYTYYY 

IT SEEMED THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN CHECKING YOUR MAIL? 

THAT'S OK! 

MAYBE YOU JUST THOUGHT THAT YOU CAN JUST NOT BE INVOLVED IN THIS LITTLE GAME THAT WE ARE HAVING? 

WELL THAT CAN'T DO! 

SO HERE'S THE THING I'LL GIVE YOU THIS NICE SECOND HINT AND YOU'LL WAKE UP TO A BIG SURPRISE TOMORROW! 

CALL IT A BIRTHDAY PRESENT FROM ME! 

ALSO THE NEW LETTER WAS R BY THE WAY! 

Whoever this person is was most definitely psychotic. Should've known that at the beginning. But I'm in too deep now. 

I was scared that night but I finally went to sleep almost late. 

Now that leads to what happened today. 

To tell you what I woke up to was the most disturbing thing I ever saw would be an understatement. 

Soon as my alarm went off I woke up to something wet dripping on my face. I went to wipe it off, smearing it over me as I went to turn the desk lamp beside me on. 

My heart stopped. 

What I had on my hand was blood. And some of it seemed to be fresh. I felt another drop come down on me. 

As I went to look up the pure horror that was on my face. 

IT WAS FINGERS!!!!

All In different shapes and sizes. Some that look young and old. Some were actually decomposing. All strung out to form a single word; 

FORGET 

This is why I'm here because I don't seem to know what to do. 

I'm actually scared for my life. 

I don't think the little boy that used to solve mysteries with Scooby Doo can figure this out. 

I need answers. So please help me. Ib
