The Thing That Stole My Father's Face seems happy this week. 

It steals a lot, and the things it has decided to take are bizarre. I've started keeping a list. So far, in addition to my father's face, the thing has stolen:

The concept of a beach vacation.
Heavy Metal magazines.
Various sports team baseball caps.
Vintage comic books.
Encounters with an old friend at the grocery store.
Bartender tips.
A jar of Jiff peanut butter.
A pocket bible.
Button down Spiderman shirts.
The show Supernatural.
A song sung especially for me as a child.

At first, I tried to talk to The Thing That Stole My Father's Face. But it can only mimic superficial things about my father. If you press it, push it, try to get a REAL conversation out of it (demanding to know what its done to your father for example) it just shuts down. After staring at you blankly for a few moments, it will open it's mouth and pop out Something Dad Says. 

Kind of like how Woody from Toy Story has a few catchphrases when you pull his cord. Classic, familiar phrases, but there is no real substance to it. 

I won't lie, it is terrifying.

I seem to be the only one who has clocked that something is wrong. I have very very carefully brought up my concerns to my closest family, knowing I must sound insane. My uncle gently recommended I see a therapist. 

Everyone else thinks my father is alive and well. But only I know the truth-he is dead. And something sinister is walking the earth living his life, wearing his face.

I've tried to live my own life as if this isn't happening. I stopped talking to The Thing and blocked it's number--it wants to talk to me apparently. I had to block it on socials too because it was liking my posts and updating my Dad's youtube channel with 3 minute movie reviews. The notifications make me nauseous.

It's been 6 months, and I'm still waiting for something to happen. I have nightmares about it. In them, I see something horrible crawl from my father's mouth. This is the moment, the transformation. I feel sick. I scream at him, I accuse my father. He must have let The Thing in, wanted it somehow--he is responsible! In the dream I am certain of this and the weight of the truth is unbearable. My father willingly gave himself up. There is only my father's expressionless face as I beg for him to say something, to explain why he did it. And then I wake up. 

But nothing in my waking life has happened. Nothing sinister I can point to to prove to everyone that The Thing isn't to be trusted, that it's not my dad. 

Now we're in a weird limbo, me and The Thing. I don't know what to do. For now I keep my distance, and that doesn't seem to bother it. 

I wonder what its goal is. What it may do to my family. What it may do to the world.

Any advice is appreciated. 

I'll keep you posted.
