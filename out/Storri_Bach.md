Alright so I don’t know how to start this but I saw something and I don’t understand it yet so I want to ask all of you what you thought of this thing. My grandpa is Danish/German, his mom and dad were immigrants from Europe. I won’t bore you all with the details but the important part is that he used to tell my sister and I these wild stories about monsters and elves and gnomes. I have to wonder if he hopped on that train in the 70’s where he experimented with some stuff but there was always one story he told us that he swore to never anger and that was, the Storri Bach.

For now we’ll call my sister, Fet, and if I reference a Jens just assume it’s your lovely author. One day my sister and I asked our grandpa why the Storri Bach always scared him so much. This was the story he told us or about as close as I can remember since I can’t ask him anymore. Last he told us this story was the day before he was brutally murdered and his killer was never found, everyone thought it was just some stupid burglar and grandpa happened to be awake at the wrong moment but I know who or rather what it was.

A long time ago, the old gods were fading from the minds of the people but they still held some sway over the Danes and Germans. There were echoes of their power but the folk decided to begin following the new desert god and his teachings, though they always showed reverence to the elves and gnomes of old. One spirit which haunted the mighty woods of our people was known only as the Storri Bach, the name coming from both German and danish because it attacked both people somehow. The Storri Bach always kept close to the mighty stream nearby, Farfar, my sister and I’s nickname for our grandpa, always told us that Storri Bach lived near the stream in a hut because it was the protector of the stream. I always thought it was some kind of deity of sorts from the way Farfar talked about it but forgotten I guess. The Storri Bach would hunt anyone and everyone who dared come too close to the stream but it would play with its prey many times.

The Storri Bach was said to manipulate time in some way, at first he could make people relive an entire year of life while other times he simply made them grow so old either sickness took them in an instant or their bones couldn’t hold them anymore. Farfar, my grandpa told us that’s why his parents left Europe, to escape that demon or that’s what he called it. He always told us stories like this when Fet and I were kids but as I got older the more I wanted to know the truth of things or I guess the truth of the old stories. Once I finished college, I got a degree in history and more specifically I focused much of my studies on mythology. I even spent a summer in Denmark learning about old Scandinavian stories, though this was probably when everything went wrong.

I went back to the village my great grandparents were from and sure enough, it was gone. No one lived there anymore like I don’t know if everyone just left or died after the Second World War or what but all the buildings were empty and falling apart. Though I will say that I found an interesting discovery the further I ventured, some homes had this shrine and each one was either the same or varying degrees of the same kind of altar to a being I’d never seen before. It was a very tall person but it looked like its hands were almost bigger than it, like the hands rested at the things hips but the claws extended down to its feet. The face was scribbled out on every single one and all but one had a single word or name I guess, Storri Bach. I went out to the forest that was near the village and at first I’d find the stream no problem but then an hour passed and I realized I was walking in a circle. Another hour passed and I noticed I had passed the same rock five times because I left a single mark on it every time I passed it. Finally another hour passed and I finally found the stream but no hut, thought it was a cruel joke but glad the fabled Storri Bach wasn’t real so I refilled my water bottle in the stream since it had to come from some mountain or something.

Once I returned home from my trip I had tossed my bag with my water bottle inside it into the attic of my home, nothing much happened after that for awhile. I met someone and I even had kids who were about eight or nine when the day I finally understood what I had done finally happened. One night my kids wanted me to tell them a story, one I’d never told them before, my son wanted to hear a horror story and my daughter wanted to hear anything but. I told them the story of the Storri Bach, I may have changed it a little to scare them a bit but I didn’t see the harm. I was so wrong.

One night my kids kept talking about the attic, they kept crying saying they saw something up there past the door. So our attic has a doorway at the very back as my original plan was to make some kind of space up there for myself but never finished though there is a door and walls. The kids said that there was some kind of tall man up there in that little room and I thought they were imagining it but they said it’s fingers were so long that it touched my son from the door way to the other end of the attic. I went up there a little while ago to find out what creep or homeless guy decided to stow away in my home but I was so filled with dread after what happened I’ve been sitting in my office trying to figure out what to do so maybe you all can help.

I will do my best to recollect what I saw and what happened from when I entered the attic to when I left but there may be some things I missed. So after my kids ran into my office I told my wife I’d go check it out, also told my kids to stay in their room till I came back down. Once I got to the attic door, I pulled the cord to bring the ladder down but as I did I heard a sharp squeal like nails on a chalkboard. Oddly and only for a brief moment I thought I saw a single black spot on one corner of the doorway looking down at me but I blinked and it was gone. I slowly climbed up the ladder and poked my head around, first all I saw was darkness but in the eery silence and the cloak of darkness I felt this strange feeling come over me, like I was entering into another world or rather someone else’s world. Once I pulled myself up and pulled on the cord for the light, there was a brief second I saw a shadow from underneath the doorway then it was gone like someone had taken a step away from the door. I yelled out into the attic towards the door, “Hey! Get the fuck out of my attic!”

In response, I heard a deep and low groan as if whatever it is was dying slowly and painfully then a loud thud hit the door on the other side. I yelled down to my wife who was standing at the bottom of the ladder, “Honey! Get my shotgun!”

A few minutes later she handed it to me, a solid 12 gauge I’ve thankfully never used before this moment. I took careful steps towards the door as another loud thud resounded through the attic which made me jump slightly, the closer I walked felt as if the air was becoming colder. Something wasn’t right and I knew it once I got to the door, I went to turn the knob but whatever it was opened it first. All I saw was a ridiculously tall thing throw the door open, slamming into me and sending me to the ground; I quickly lifted my shotgun only to come face to face with it. 

The eyes were just two sunken holes with almost dehydrated looking skin, in the process of decomposing but its mouth had no lips or teeth just gums that bled profusely as that squeal was louder than ever. I could see its feet as I had to crane my neck upwards to stare at its face but then it moved its long arm around the door then I realized that was just its finger. It snaked around the door as four more fingers followed behind, I shouted in pure terror, “What? What the fuck are you!?”

Its deformed hand now in view looked mangled at best, like it got caught in a machine. “Bring me food!” I don’t know where I heard it, I just know it said that as the fingers were inches away from my face. Finally I fired a shot into its chest which made it look down, tap the ground three times, then the hole slowly closed as the shells seemed to move backwards and finally fall to the ground. I just stammered and stared till its holes stared at me, “Bring. Me. FOOD!!” Finally it screamed the words as I scrambled and crawled away, I fell head first onto the floor below but was able to shoot back up fast enough to slam the attic door shut. I told my wife to take the kids and go to my mother’s house until I figured out what that thing was and why it was here. What in the fuck was that? Please. Anyone help me, I am begging you. I’m not sure yet but I think it’s the same thing our Farfar told us about. The Storri Bach
