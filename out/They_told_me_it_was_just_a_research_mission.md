*\[Footsteps in sand, soldiers talking in background\]*

The operation went successfully. We're now trekking back through the desert to our rendezvous point. Sarge estimates we'll be there within a day, depending on the weather.

I still don't understand why Elias made me tag along. I'm not in Ops or Strategy, and there's nothing out here to research.

*\[Tent flap rustling, footsteps\]*

"Sarge? Sarge, wake up."

"What is it, Stevens?"

"There's something out there. A little girl. She's watching us."

"Stevens, I swear to God, if you've woken me up because you couldn't shoo away a child, you're going to be on watch all night."

**SCREEEEEEEEEE**

*\[Multiple voices, gear rustling\]*

"Yo Stevens, why's your momma out in the desert doing mating calls?"

*\[Laughter echoes across the squad\]*

"Fuck off, Kees. That ain't funny. There's something out there."

"Oh, calm down. Even if it's a rabid animal, who cares? Just put a bullet in it and let us go back to sleep."

"Kees, since you think of yourself as a comedian, you can join Stevens on watch."

"Fucksake."

"What was that, Kees?"

"Nothing, Sarge. Happy to take the night watch."

*\[Running footsteps, heavy breathing\]*

"SARGE! SARGE! Kees is dead!"

"What do you mean, dead?"

*\[Running footsteps\]*

"Jesus, what is that?"

"Is that a skull?"

"Shit, that's his gun."

"Militants. Everyone pack up, we're moving out."

"SARGE, SARGE SHE'S THERE! LOOK!"

"Stevens, calm down. Where?"

"By that ridge! It's her!"

"AIM!"

"Sarge, it's just a"

"I SAID AIM!"

*\[Multiple weapons cocking\]*

"Get on your knees!"

"*I saw what you did to the others*."

"What?"

"What's she doing?"

"She's... she's drawing something with her shoe."

"*If even a single one of you crosses this line, I swear I will kill you all.*"

"Get on your knees, final warning or we will shoot!"

"Sarge, please let me just go grab her. It's a kid."

"Fine. Grab her."

*\[Footsteps moving away\]*

*"AAARRGH!"*

*\[Wet sizzling sound\]*

"Holy shit, Stevens just.... melted What the fuck?"

*\[Gunshots\]*

"She's not there! Sarge, fuck thisI'm not sitting here like a duck."

"Martins, stay put"

"AAAAARGH!"

*\[Another sizzling sound\]*

"LAUNCH THE SURVEILLANCE DRONES."

*\[Bags unzipping, equipment rustling\]*

"Launching drones."

*\[High-pitched whirring\]*

"what the-"

*\[Two explosions\]*

"The drones just crashed into something!"

"That makes no sense. There's nothing there."

"Sarge, the line goes all the way around the camp."

"DEFENSIVE POSITIONS. DO NOT CROSS THE LINE.”

After an hour of testing different materials, nothing passes the line. Metal melts. Sand simply slides down as if there's an invisible wall. Paper turns to ash. Flesh burns.

"I thought you boys in Research were meant to be clever."

"Sarge, I don't think you understand. None of the materials we've tested pass the barrier. Not even light."

"We can dig."

"Tried that. The shovels melt as soon as they cross the barrier, so we don't know how far down it goes. The other issue is that because sand can't pass through, we'd be burying ourselves."

*\[Whispering\]*

Jamie is counting the rations and calculated that we have approximately five days of food if we ration the rations. Water, we probably have around three days.

Humans die from dehydration after three days, but with this heat, I don't think we'll make it past two.

***14:45 - Phileonis Desert***

"HEY, GIRL! WHERE ARE YOU?"

"Jamie, shut up. Sit down."

"WHAT DO YOU WANT?"

"Hello."

*\[Shuffling\]*

"Fuck, what the fuck? How'd she just appear? How'd she cross the line?"

"GRAB HER!"

"NO, JAMIE!"

*\[Sizzling\]*

"FUCK! WHAT THE FUCK, SHE DISAPPEARED!"

"JAMIE!"

"He's dead, George. She tricked him into going headfirst through the line."

"She said she said if we crossed, she'd kill us. But she's hunting. Fuck, fuck, I don't want to die."

"Get a grip, George."

***17:30 - Phileonis Desert***

*\[Shouting, scuffling\]*

"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN THE WATER'S GONE?"

"Sarge, I-I was just doing inventory and"

"We had three days! Jamie said three days!"

"That's what I'm trying to tell you. Half the containers are empty!"

"Which one of you fucks has been stealing water?"

*\[Silence\]*

"I SAID WHO'S BEEN"

"It was me."

"Rodriguez?"

"I... I didn't want to die of thirst, Sarge. I'm sorry. I just"

*\[Sound of pistol being drawn\]*

"Rodriguez, put the gun down."

"I don't want to die like Stevens. I don't want to melt. I don't"

"RODRIGUEZ, DON'T"

*\[Gunshot\]*

*\[Body hitting sand\]*

"He... he just..."

\[Whispering\]

"James, you awake?"

"Yeah, George. Can't sleep."

"Where's Mitchell?"

"What do you mean?"

"Mitchell. He was on watch with Harris."

"HARRIS! Where's Mitchell?"

"I... I don't know. He was just here. He was right fucking here!"

*\[Footsteps, multiple voices calling out\]*

"Mitchell! MITCHELL!"

*\[Silence\]*

*\[Retching sounds\]*

"What the fuck... what the fuck is that?"

"Don't look at it, Harris."

"Is that... are those buckets?"

"That's blood. And... Jesus, that's meat. That's fucking human"

*\[Vomiting\]*

"Where did these come from? They weren't here last night."

"She put them here. She's fucking with us."

"Why would she"

"Because we're going to run out of water today. And she knows it."

# Entry #25

***19:00 - Phileonis Desert***

*\[Argument in background\]*

"I'm not drinking that shit!"

"Then you'll die, Harris."

"You're insane, Sarge. You're fucking insane!"

"It's been two days. We missed the rendezvous. They'll wait maybe one more day, then they're gone."

*\[Gagging\]*

*\[Heavy breathing\]*

\*"\*Harris? Harris, wake up."

"Oh god. Oh god, look at him."

"He's... he's completely dried out. Like a mummy."

"He didn't drink any. She knew. She fucking knew he wouldn't drink, and she... she took all his water."

"Every drop. His eyes are just... dust."

*\[Scuffling, grunting\]*

"Back the fuck up, George!"

"Collins, let the Sarge go!"

"NO! I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE!"

"Collins, you're not thinking straight"

"GIRL! LITTLE GIRL! I KNOW YOU'RE LISTENING!"

*\[Knife being drawn\]*

"I'LL CUT HIS THROAT! LET ME OUT, I'LL KILL HIM FOR YOU!"

*\[Footsteps in sand\]*

"Hello."

"Jesus, she just"

"Let me go. Let me go and you can have him. He's the one you want, right? The one who gave the orders?"

*\[Unintelligible whispering from the girl\]*

"Collins, don't listen to her!"

"IS THAT A YES? AM I FREE TO GO?"

"Yes."

*\[Blade cutting flesh, gurgling\]*

"SARGE!"

*\[Running footsteps\]*

"I'M FREE! I'M"

*\[High-pitched screaming, crackling sound\]*

*\[Silence\]*

"He's gone. Just... vapor."

"She lied."

"No, George. She said he was free. Free to die."

***22:00 - Phileonis Desert***

*\[Quiet conversation\]*

"George, what was the operation exactly? I mean, what did we actually blow up?"

"Command said it was a militant weapons depot."

"You were in the building. What did you see?"

"I... I didn't go in. Sarge and Stevens planted the charges."

"But you must have seen something."

"There were these... containment units. Medical equipment. I thought it was a field hospital."

"A hospital? We blew up a hospital?"

"No, no... it was different. The equipment was... advanced. Too advanced for militants."

"Research facility?"

"Maybe. I don't know. I don't fucking know, James."

"What the, you’re floating! you’re fucking floating!"

"HELP ME! JAMES, HELP ME!"

"I can't reach you! You're too high!"

"IT HURTS! OH GOD, IT HURTS!"

*\[Cracking sounds\]*

"George, what's happening?"

"I'M SORRY! I LIED!"

"About what? George, about what?"

"THE FACILITY! IT WASN'T - AAAHHH!"

*\[Bones breaking\]*

"IT WAS CHILDREN! THEY WERE EXPERIMENTING ON CHILDREN!"

"What?"

"ENHANCED SOLDIERS! They were trying to AGGGHHHH! They were making super soldiers out of kids!"

*\[Wet tearing sounds\]*

"When we blew it up... when we blew it up, they were all inside! All the kids were"

*\[Crushing sound\]*

"My bones! She's pulling my bones through my"

"Let him go! PLEASE!"

"I KNEW! I SAW THEM! Little bodies in tanks! I SAW THEM AND I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING!"

George is... there's not much left. Just pulp. And blood. So much blood.

"Hello, James."

*\[Shuffling backward\]*

"You're here. Finally here."

"Are you ready?"

"I didn't know. I wasn't involved in the operation. I was just research. This isn't fair."

"But you watched. You all watched while we burned."

"I didn't"

"You recorded. You documented. You observed. Just like they did to us."

"Please, I have a wife"

"We had families too."

*\[Static building\]*

"what are you"

*\[Heavy interference\]*

"The line is broken. You're free now, James. Free to run."
