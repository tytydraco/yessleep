I woke up six days after fleeing my home in the middle of the night. When I did, I scrubbed at my face with my hand only to discover bandages tightly wrapped around my wrist and hand. The memory of what had happened that night only came back to me once I looked at my bandaged hand and saw the gap where my lost finger should have been. I screamed and leaped to my feet, and moments later, Adam and his cousin entered the room with panic written all over their faces. They calmed once they saw me, but my fear only continued to build.

Once they had explained what had happened once I’d passed out — Adam’s cousin had been the one to wrap up my hand — I calmed down a little. But there was something bothering me. I only realised what it was once I also realised that I hadn’t seen *it* once since I had woken up.

“Where’s the grimoire?” I asked hurriedly.

“The what?” Adam’s cousin, Lara, asked.

“The book! Where is it?” I asked again, staring at Adam.

“I don’t know,” Adam said, shrugging as he shrank away from my intense gaze.

“Did you take it?” I asked Lara as I began to breath heavily. My feeling that all the horrible things that had happened to me since my father’s death had been caused by the grimoire hadn’t lessened during my brief comatose state, and had, in fact, only strengthened while I was asleep. As I considered being apart from the grimoire for any significant amount of time, a raging fury and fear overcome me and I shouted, “Where did you put it?”

“I think it’s on the dining table, I don’t know,” Lara said quickly.

She quickly stepped away from me as I all but ran past her and into the dining room. My body felt sluggish and slow, and my limbs moved with a difficulty that made me stumble and stagger my way through Lara’s house. The fatigue was so heavy in my body that I slumped against the wall a few times before I leaned on the doorframe of the dining room and looked inside. Placed atop the dining room’s centre table was the grimoire, so black that its leather cover seemed to eat the light despite how its silver gilding glittered and gleamed. I launched myself toward it and laid my hand on its front cover, feeling the thrill of its magic streak through my like a lightning strike of ecstatic power. I slumped against the table and barely held myself up, all my strength — which had already been diminished by losing three days to the trance I’d gone into upon first reading the book, as well as my week-long nap — depleted.

“What the hell is wrong with you?” Adam screamed at me from the doorway. I only realised that he was standing right behind me when I straightened and turned toward his voice. He stared at me and flexed his hands as his anger overtook every bit of him. “Yelling at the woman who’s been housing you and feeding you while you’re knocked out cold? Are you insane?”

I sagged as I realised that I had been unconscious for so long. I was starving, and tired, the kind of tired I’d been when waking up from my three-day trance. I stiffened again when I realised that my most recent nap had been twice as long. No wonder my limbs felt like wet cardboard. There was something in Adam’s voice, or maybe in his face, that enraged me in equal measure, though. In hindsight, I had no reason to be mad at him, but at the time, he might as well have mocked my fear and respect for the grimoire, the only thing I had left of my father’s legacy.

“I don’t care about any of that,” I said quietly. Some part of me still knew that provoking Lara, at least, would *not* be in my best interest. “What did you tell her? Did you let her know what she had in her home?” I brought the grimoire up to my chest and held it close with both arms. “Did you do anything at all to make sure those shadows didn’t follow us here?”

Adam looked like he didn’t understand a word of what I’d said. “Of course I didn’t! How could I? I don’t know your freaky voodoo magic, man!”

“It’s not voodoo, idiot,” I hissed.

I went to push past him to perhaps leave Lara’s house, but Adam latched onto my wrist and held up my bandaged hand between our faces as he bit off every word, as if each one pained him. “Then what the hell *did* you do? Explain it to me properly.”

My silence lasted longer than I had meant it to. “I don’t owe you anything if you’re going to be like this,” I spat.

“That’s such bullshit!” Adam roared, and tightened his grip on my aching wrist. “This insanity took our home! You asked me if I know what we brought here. If Lara’s in danger, if those *things* are going to come back, tell me now.”

“Get off me,” I thrashed to free myself from his grip, but the weakness of my body prevented me from ripping my arm free. “Let me go!”

“Not until you explain everything,” Adam said. “I had to say that we came home that night to our house on fire and came here to stay for a few days until the firefighters say it’s safe to go home. There *is* no home, dude! I even had to convince her not to take you to a hospital for your messed up hand. You have to help me out here and explain what the hell is happening to us. To you. And what might happen to Lara if we stay here!”

My hand closed into a trembling fist as he held my wrist with his iron grip. The power of the grimoire flooded my body and mind, and I knew that I had its magic at my fingertips, literally. I could have done anything to make Adam let me go. I could have done it. Could I have? Could I have used magic to possibly harm my best friend just so that I could avoid the conversation that needed to happen? I didn’t know, but I didn’t want to find out, so I forced myself to relax and that was when Adam released me from his vice-like grip on my wrist. I leaned onto the table behind me and watched with careful eyes as Adam backed up to poke his head into the hall.

“We’re fine,” he said quietly.

Lara crept into the room and stared at me with a hard, disapproving gaze when she did, positioning herself at the head of the large table as Adam sat down opposite me. I sat down slowly, and kept at least a finger on the grimoire as I did. Once we were all seated, a silence fell in the dining room, silence so thick that it felt difficult to even breathe, much less speak. But I did.

Haltingly, reluctantly, I told them everything. From my father’s death to the ravens, to the storm and the church, to the trance and the shadows and the magic; everything. I didn’t have the strength to lie.

Lara didn’t take it very well, and Adam wasn’t much better. At least Adam had seen some of it with his own eyes, and knew some of what had happened with the ravens, but that experience didn’t help him when I recited the story of the Hanged Man and the One-Eyed Sage, and he was equally as disturbed and disbelieving as his cousins by the time I was done.

“Am I seriously supposed to believe all that?” Lara asked, despite her pale face and wide eyes. I figure that no matter who relayed it in what language, the Hanged Man’s always invoked the feeling of truth, as it had when I had read it. When I assured her that every word I’d uttered was true, Lara laughed shakily at me and demanded that I prove it.

I looked around at that and found a candle that was unlit, it was early in the morning. As I’d never taken my hand off the grimoire for even a second while telling my story, it was easy to call on its magic. I donated a bit of my body heat, just enough to light the candle, and threw in a wave of my bandaged hand for show, to prove it was me who caused the white flame that engulfed the candle’s wick at the exact same time. Lara stared at the now lit candle in shock and horror and awe with her jaw dropped, and Adam stared too, as the candle’s new flame turned yellow as my magically transferred body heat stopped sustaining it and it began to burn the wick.

After that, the conversation was much easier.

“What are you guys going to do?” Lara asked, still unable to keep her mouth closed. Her eyes kept darting over to the candle giving off a faint light that was drowned out by the morning sun streaming through the window.

“I have no idea,” I said simply, which set Adam off again.

“Well, we have to do *something*, don’t we?” he said and with a high, fake laugh. “We’ve got no house or clothes or anything!”

“I could use some of my dad’s money to get clothes and replace our phones,” I said. I almost cringed when I realised that I no longer had a cell phone, but stopped when I realised that the only person I had left who could’ve called me was in the room with me. That, and work, but I wasn’t going to work any time soon. “The rest can wait.”

“Amazing,” Adam sighed, and then his eyes narrowed. “How much money did you get from your dad?”

“Enough,” I said slowly. I didn’t particularly feel like getting into the details of that at the time, so I brushed it off.

“Perfect,” Lara said heavily. When Adam and I looked at her curiously, she shrugged. “As much as I loved having you two stay in my house and eat my food and make me nurse you back to health without explaining a thing or compensating me whatsoever, I’d like my peace and quiet back.”

Adam apologised and thanked her quickly, and so did I. “This is all my fault,” I said as soon as I realised it. “My dad never told me this would happen. He had to know. Why didn’t he tell me?”

“I’m sure he didn’t mean for all this terrible crap to happen to you,” Adam said. “Just bad luck.”

I mumbled something that I don’t remember, something like, “Sure, whatever,” and left the room to shower before Adam and I had to leave Lara’s house to check out the remains of our apartment before doing anything else. I took a small backpack from Lara’s place to keep the grimoire in so that it could remain on my person, and neither Lara nor Adam uttered a single word of complaint.

The building that had once contained our apartment had, after the fire, gained a blackened, hollowed out cube where our home had once been. Ours had been a top-floor apartment, so we hadn’t doomed any upstairs neighbours to die of smoke inhalation in their sleep, but the damage was still immense and the apartment hadn’t been saved. It was all gone. The place Adam and I had called home for years was nothing but ash. We stood on the street looking up at our burnt out apartment and staying clear of the firefighters that were cleaning the place out, likely so that the owner of the building could rebuild the apartment. We left shortly after checking out the damage. We couldn’t stand to look at it any more than we’d had to.

We bought cheap, pre-paid phones first, just so we could communicate with the outside world if we needed to. I had the invasive feeling that I would need to. After that, we called our landlord and reported our survival, and asked whether or not our lease was still valid if our apartment no longer existed. We made up a story of thieves in the night accidentally starting a fire in their attempt to cover their own tracks after robbing us. After an argument about how outlandish that story was, we eventually came to an agreement — we could stay in a vacant apartment one floor down while our original one was rebuilt. We’d have to furnish it ourselves, though. With that done, we started walking back to our building from the store where we’d bought the temporary bricks that would have to pass as cell phones until we could spend more time on buying real replacements.

It was around that time that I started feeling an itch between my shoulder blades, the hair on the back of my neck stand on end, and the grimoire pounding in time with my heartbeat against my back in the pack I’d stuffed it in. It felt like I was being watched, and the grimoire responded to that. I looked around the street we were on suddenly, quickly scanning my surroundings with sharp eyes narrowed by panic, but saw nothing. Adam tapped me on the shoulder when he saw that I’d stopped walking. I explained to him my vague sense of something being wrong, and his eyes narrowed too.

“More shadows?” he asked.

“I don’t know,” I said quietly. The idea that speaking any louder than a whisper would provoke whatever I knew was watching me was impossible to ignore, and I didn’t doubt it for a second. “But there’s something.” It was around noon, so any more of those shadows would have stuck out to our eyes instantly in such bright light. There was nothing, though. Nothing that we could see. That was worse, almost, knowing there was *something* but not knowing *what*.

I flinched violently as I felt a hand close around the back of my neck. Even after spinning around to see what had touched me, I saw nothing, though that invisible sensation left my skin as I turned. Adam looked at me like I was crazy for a moment, but then followed my line of sight and stared hard at the empty space that I was sure *something* occupied. The grimoire was beating against my ribs so hard that I realised what that must be. Without skin-to-book contact, the grimoire only really behaved this way when something magical was actively happening nearby. Having used and read the book must have given me some sort of sense for magic through the grimoire. I slung the backpack around to my front and unzipped it to grasp the grimoire with my hand. That sense of *something’s* presence only magnified when I touched the grimoire and its powers filled me.

It was as if the air was thick and heavy in the space I sensed was filled by some invisible thing that had grabbed my neck. I could almost see the warping of air where some strange magic concealed whatever was there. I blinked heavily and lost track of that warping concealment when a low whisper filled my ears, sounding as though it had come from right behind my head. “Found you.”

My first and only instinct was to run. Adam must have been a lot more tense than he’d appeared to be, because he took off right after me. We sprinted down the street for no visible reason, and we didn’t even talk to each other, let alone passersby that stared at two grown men who looked like they’d seen a ghost running through the city in the middle of the day. We ran all the way back to our apartment building without stopping or even slowing for a moment. The whole time, the grimoire beat against my chest so hard that I thought Adam and the random people we passed on the street must have heard it too, but none of them ever said anything about it.

Halfway to our building, an immense shadow was cast along the street as the sky went dark. As we ran, I looked up and almost tripped over my feet as I realised that once again, a titanic flock of ravens was after me. After us, I remembered as Adam cried out in shock and fear. They writhed and surged as a collective up in the sky as they passed in front of the sun and cast a fluttering shadow onto the city below them. That cloud of imminent death chased after us as we fled our doom. I don’t remember exactly how long we ran, but it was a short enough distance to our building that the ravens hadn’t caught up to us by the time we hurried inside and closed the doors behind us, causing a few of the ravens to break their necks against the glass.

Our new apartment was barren, as we’d expected. When we got inside, Adam knelt on the floorboards as he tried to catch his breath, but I collapsed onto my back as I huffed and puffed. Adam hadn’t been the one to pass out for what was essentially nine days in a row, so he recovered first. Adam locked the front door and went around checking the windows like I had done weeks before after my first encounter with the ravens. Once we were enclosed in the living room, we finally relaxed, and I explained what I’d felt and heard that had made me run.

“Damn it all!” Adam spat as he breathed heavily. “When do we ever get a break?”

I climbed to my feet and shook my head. “I don’t know. Feels like I’ve been running for weeks non-stop.”

“What is with all the raven stuff?” Adam asked.

“I have no idea,” I said. More than a note of bitterness bled through there.

“I thought you were the magic guy now. You don’t know?” Adam asked roughly.

I stared at him. “I never said I knew everything.”

Adam paused, seemed to hesitate, and then seemed to brace himself. “If that book has told you so much, does it have an answer for all this? A solution for this insanity?”

“I don’t know,” I said. Pouting was not a thing I did often as a twenty-seven-year-old man, but I was feeling just as petty about the lack of answers as Adam was, so I did. “If I knew, I’d tell you.”

Adam scoffed. “Sure.”

It took me a moment to pick up on his tone, and I glared at him when I did. “What do you want me to do? I’m just as lost as you are!”

“That’s not true and you know it!” Adam yelled in an explosive fury. “You can defend yourself against this shit just fine. I’m helpless. I can’t do a thing to save myself. I don’t have what you have.” He stared at the grimoire as he spoke, and didn’t blink a single time.

“So … what? You want some magic, too, huh? I didn’t think you were the jealous type,” I said. Once again, I know that my reaction was extreme and wrong in hindsight, but at the time, a paranoia clouded my mind, and convinced me that I was being attacked, and that there was only one way to save myself.

“Jealous.” Adam said it flatly, as if he couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “Are you serious? I’m not jealous of you, man, I just want to be able to protect myself when these insane things keep happening! Because we both know this isn’t going to end right here and now.”

“No,” I mumbled. In my heart, I knew that my possession of the book was why these things were happening to us. Meeting Adam’s eyes in that moment told me that he knew it, too. “But it’s dangerous. You can’t just play around with it.”

Adam flexed his hands, clenching them into fists and relaxing them over and over, in clear agitation. “I’m not playing. This is about being safe! Are you so obsessed that you can’t even let me take a look at the book so I can protect myself?”

“I’m not obsessed!” I snapped. “This was my father’s grimoire. I inherited it, it’s mine. You remember the story, right? *Amid the ashes, the widow vowed to keep the Hanged Man's holy text, and protect those who would be wronged should its powers fall into the hands of another man with raven eyes.* The grimoire must have been passed from person to person to protect it from being used to hurt people.” I grinned as I put it together at last, realised why the grimoire must have fallen into my father’s possession, and now mine. “It’s my responsibility to keep it safe.”

Adam stared at me with narrow, disapproving eyes. “So you’re a hero now, is that it? Your fixation is actually for the greater good!” He laughed, and it was a nasty sound that put me on edge, made me want to lash out with my words, or something a little stronger than just words. “I don’t buy it. You really can’t stomach letting that book out of your reach for even a second, can you? Even if it means I can’t defend myself when another monster comes to kill us because your dad decided to drop dead.”

My patience was shattered by his comment about my father. I walked over to him and punched him across the jaw. There were no thoughts in my mind at that moment, just hate and rage that it pained me to contain any longer, so I hit him. Now, I regret escalating, because that was the straw that broke the camel’s back, but at the time, it felt good. There was shame there even then, but the satisfaction of unleashing the fury and agitation that had been building in me since learning of my father’s death was too great for me to recognise that undercurrent of guilt hiding underneath.

We threw a few punches back and forth as we shouted and tried to wrestle each other to the floor, or perhaps to pin each other against the wall, anything to gain an advantage over the other. As I shouted in an animal rage and tasted blood in my mouth after a particularly painful blow from Adam, I realised that I did have an advantage. The grimoire was what had caused this fight, but I hadn’t yet considered using it on him. As I stared at him and wondered, my hands closed around the grimoire over the backpack that was still slung around my front. Adam looked down at it and his in his eyes flashed recognition. We both started scrambling at the backpack to get the grimoire in our hands before the other could get the chance. I tried to kick Adam away from me, but he held onto the backpack’s straps and kept himself close to me.

Adam punched my bandaged hand, which made me yelp from the throbbing pain that shot up my arm and take my hand off the grimoire. My other hand snaked into the backpack at the same time as Adam grasped the grimoire with both hands and tried to pull it away from me. The grimoire’s heartbeat was twice as immense as before, pounding in time with both our heartbeats. I could tell that Adam could hear and feel it, as his eyes widened and his whole body shivered as his arms erupted with visible goosebumps. Within me, a deranged feeling overtook my mind, unhinged aggression, or perhaps insane paranoia, that convinced me that something very bad would happen if Adam was allowed to read or make use of the grimoire’s dark powers.

“It’s mine!” I screamed as the powers of the grimoire filled me like a inflating a balloon; it felt like life itself suffusing me, and it drove me to act on the impulse that came to me at that precise moment — to ensure that Adam did not take the book from me by any means necessary.

Cold spread from the core of my body out toward my limbs as I unconsciously donated a portion of my body heat to a spell I hadn’t intentionally tried to perform. Even so, one of Adam’s hands exploded into white fire that consumed his flesh from the tips of his fingers up to his wrist. He shrieked in pain and ripped himself away from me as he staggered back and tried to pat the flames out as they quickly turned yellowish, and then orange with streaks of pure red as it ate away at his hand, which quickly reddened and then blackened as it burned. I stumbled away from Adam and kept the grimoire held close to my chest with my arms wrapped around the backpack and my bandaged hand pressed against the cover as if it could slip out of my grasp.

We looked at each other then, my eyes meeting his, and in his gaze was hate and betrayal. The worst part was that without that adrenaline and paranoia pushing me to think crazy things, I knew that he was right to have that hate for What in the world had I done? I had no idea why I’d let things go so far, or maybe I did and just didn’t want to face it at that time, but either way, I couldn’t comprehend my own actions. It was like I’d been possessed. That would be a good excuse, if I had really been possessed. Unfortunately, everything I’d done had been my choice, even if those choices had been warped and influenced by my anxiety and confusion. I wish I wasn’t responsible for hurting Adam. My hands left the grimoire as I let it drop back into the backpack hanging at my front.

Adam’s hand burned until it was a shrivelled, black stump of ruined, dry flesh that kept spitting out red embers and black smoke long after the fire died for lack of fuel. Whatever I had done had kept the fire contained to the area below his wrist. All his fingers were gone, and so was most of the rest of his hand; only a bleeding, smoking chunk of skin and muscle and bone remained. He might’ve been able to save the hand if he’d had access to water, but as he stood with his back against the wall, which might’ve been the only thing keeping him on his feet, he glared at me with rage and fear written on his face in equal parts. I was between him and he kitchen sink, the closest source of water, and he didn’t move any closer to me than he had to. I was also between him and the door. I’d accidentally cornered him.

“I’m sorry,” I said quietly, though he just kept staring at me silently. “I didn’t mean to.”

“I don’t care anymore.” He clenched his remaining fist and cradled his bleeding, charred stump to his chest. Adam’s voice was hoarse from screaming and shook with emotion. “You’re on your own. Don’t get me involved in your stupid dad’s bullshit again. We’re done.”

He only moved once I took a few steps back and cleared the path between him and the exit. Adam didn’t spare me another glance as he left. Adam Tyrell, my best friend since college, the one person in the world that I’d had left after my father’s death, was gone. I was truly alone then, left to my own devices in an empty apartment for two to survive against the arcane forces that seemed set on hunting me until I died alone, just like my dad. I cried.

I didn’t know how much time passed between Adam’s departure and the voice returning to whisper, “I found you again,” but I leaped to my feet instantly once I heard that quiet, sly voice fill the empty apartment.

“Who’s there?” My weak voice barely projected, and shook when it did. “I’m not in the mood for this!”

“Not in the mood?” Once again, a hand closed around the back of my neck, but this time it didn’t release me when I flinched. A power unlike any I had ever experienced overcame my body then, and I was pushed down to the floor on my hands and knees as a pressure overwhelmed me from behind. A long shadow was cast on the floor, and I saw the shape of a large man, which complimented the voice, low and rough. “Too bad. You’ve escaped me thrice now, and I won’t let you get away again.”

I struggled against the stranger’s grip, but it wasn’t his hand on my neck that was keeping me down, it was an invisible wave of force that was bearing down on my back that forced me down. I couldn’t overcome that through brute strength, even if I was to have any strength. As I struggled, I twisted my head around to get a look at my attacker, and my blood ran cold when I saw him. The strange was dressed all in black, his cloak and gloves and boots and underclothes all the exact same shade. He wore a mask that formed a beak that covered his face so that not a bit of skin showed through. He exactly resembled the shadows that had attacked Adam and I and forced us from our home, except he was corporeal, a man rather than a spectre.

“You’re clueless, aren’t you?” the masked man said, contempt bleeding into his voice as he stared at me through those dark, reflective glass panels in his mask. “The way you tricked my ravens and killed my shades, I thought you knew what you were doing. But you’re just lucky. Just like Magnus was lucky.” My jaw dropped when the stranger named my father. “He didn’t teach you a thing, did he? He must’ve thought it would hide you if you didn’t know.” The masked man laughed cruelly as his grip on my neck tightened painfully. “Just invoking the Hanged Man’s powers puts you on every practitioner’s radar within a hundred miles, idiot. Especially the way you’re using it, all power and no finesse!”

I took my throbbing, bandaged hand off the ground under me and subsequently fell on my face, but I had expected that. I slid my hand into the open backpack and touched the grimoire, which was trapped beneath me as I’d fallen on my stomach. As soon as that power flooded my body and mind, I lashed out with it. I sacrificed as much of my body heat as I could without risking death and felt the heat explode above me as the beak-masked stranger was engulfed in that arcane fire. The force that kept me down vanished in an instant as the stranger’s gruff voice screamed out in agony, and I scrambled across the floor and up to my feet as I turned to watch him burn. The black-clad man staggered for a moment as he flailed beneath the flames, but the white fire winked out almost instantly when he clenched one fist hard.

When he relaxed his fist and used that same hand to pull his raven-like mask off his face, I saw that blood dripped from the middle finger, and the red liquid made visible a sharp point in the palm of his glove. I suddenly felt stupid for sacrificing whole fingers for powerful magic when I realised I could have been giving up smaller amounts of blood this whole time. The stranger’s face was pale and long, and his black hair was stuck to his face by sweat; he shone with it as smoke curled away from his cloak after he extinguished the flames. He choked and spat out soot, his dark eyes fixing on me as he exposed his face.

“Exactly what I mean,” the stranger said hoarsely. He pointed at me with the same hand he’d pricked in order to perform his magic. “You’re a child who’s just learned to walk, and you’re trying to run a marathon. Idiot!” I wanted to ask why he even cared, but shock had taken my words from me. “It’s a mockery of the Art. But that doesn’t matter now. I’ve got you cornered, so I can make up for my failure with Magnus. If only he’d had the grimoire on him when I found him.”

Hearing that about my father drove me into a rage. I couldn’t donate any more body heat without going into hypothermic shock, so I scrambled to figure out something that I could sacrifice for power. The movement was wholly unnecessary, but I punched the air with my free hand, the uninjured one, and gladly gave up that hand’s index finger to empower the spell I wanted. I had no idea how the sickly pale stranger had done any magic without touching the grimoire or an equivalent, but I copied his earlier spell and create pure force that erupted through the air between us. My spell slammed him into the wall so fast and hard that his body made a crater in the drywall as he collapsed to his knees. Blood dripped onto the floorboards in front of me as my newly maimed hand trembled from the pain, though I didn’t feel much of it in my mind.

“You only prove my point further,” the man said as he clenched his hand and blood seeped out of his gloved fingers.

As if the pain from my hand was not enough, sharp, stabbing, twisting sensations came from my leg as the stranger’s bloody, gloved hand rotated swiftly and blood sprayed from the quick, sudden gesture. It was as if the air itself hardened and then swirled around my knee, causing the flesh and bone to twist with it, snapping bone and ripping cartilage as it bent far past its limits. My vision filled with tears as my ruined knee gave out and my weight fell onto it, sending further shocks of pain up my leg and spine. My shrieks of pain were eerily similar to Adam’s earlier cries. I fell forward onto my face and dropped the grimoire as the pain in both my hands and my leg finally overwhelmed the rage and fear keeping me focused.

The grimoire hit the wood floorboards and bounced as it fell open to a random page and slid to a stop between me and the unmasked stranger. I couldn’t stop myself from shaking as I cried, which only made my hands and leg hurt worse. The man stared at the book as he climbed to his feet with pain showing on his face. “You waste the powers you could have had if your cowardly father had taught you the truth. That might have saved you this fate.” He limped over and gathered up the book in his hands. He stuffed the grimoire under his arm and shook out his bloody hand. “Finally,” he sighed as the grimoire’s power must have flooded him, though I could no longer sense that power.

“Thank you,” he said as his severe face wore a satisfied smile. “I do apologise for your father. He put up much more of a fight, so I had to be rougher with him than I usually prefer. Technically, killing you isn’t necessary now that I’ve bested you and claimed the grimoire the proper way. I understand that you’ve recently come into money. I would’ve pitied burdening a poorer man than you with the medical bills.”

With that, the shadowy raven-masked man disappeared with a clench of his bloodstained fist in an instant. He was simply there one moment and gone the next. I was left to suffer on the floor, bleeding from both hands where my old injury had been aggravated and I’d created a new one, and from my leg where some of the bones in my knee had punctured through my skin being twisted and torn by my attacker’s spell. I laid there for a long time, crying and wailing, until my new neighbours — who I hadn’t previously gotten the pleasure of meeting — found me and called an ambulance.

That was almost a month ago now. I spent the few days after that in the hospital, where they operated on my leg and treated my hands. During my stay there, at the same time every day, a raven flew up and landed on the windowsill outside my room. It didn’t try to get in, it didn’t do anything; it just watched me. I always ignored it. I got out of the hospital shortly after the surgeries and have been staying at home ever since then, bedridden by my broken leg and disabled by my mangled hands. I have a live-in carer taking care of me while I recover. Dad’s money is good for that, at least. It'll run out quicker than I ever planned after I had to pay for my hospital stay, though.

I sometimes wonder who the raven man had really been. Where he’d come from and where he’d gone, and what he was doing with the grimoire. I don’t really care about the grimoire anymore, ever since it took everything from me, or pushed me to do it myself. It’s just something to occupy my mind while I’m stuck in place. The painkillers make it hard to form very many coherent thoughts, but over the last few weeks, I’ve written this account of my ruination. It’s all I can really do now that I’ve lost everything and everyone I ever cared about.

Is there a moral to this story? Maybe. Don’t mess with powers you don’t understand, I suppose. Don’t be an ass and push your loved ones away, perhaps. I’m so sorry, Adam. I know you’ll never forgive me, and it’s not what I deserve. This pain I feel is a torture of my own making. I’ve been thinking a lot about the Hanged Man’s tale. My eyes look dark whenever I can catch my own reflection nowadays. There’s a bleakness that’s overcome me, a darkness in my gaze that scares me. I don’t know how to live with this. Maybe the moral of the Hanged Man’s tale is the only story moral that matters. Hanging myself sounds difficult with ruined hands and a disabled leg. I might be able to throw myself out the second-story window and pray that the fall’s long enough, though.

I wonder if everything I’ve been through means the afterlife is real too. I think I might like to find out soon. Maybe not, but I think I’ll keep it in mind for now.

Regardless, please heed my warning. If you ever hear or read the Hanged Man’s tale, forget you ever knew the words. I certainly wish that I could.
