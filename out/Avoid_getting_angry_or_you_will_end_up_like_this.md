It all began on the first day of my final year of high school. My friends and I were hanging out in one of the hallways near the auditorium. Daniel and I were chatting with Abraham, who was telling us how his parents had left town, leaving him with the apartment all to himself. Carla, the girl in our group, had joined us midway through the conversation.  
  
As usual, they called us all to the auditorium for the official welcome. The air buzzed with laughter and whispers—typical teenage noise in an enclosed space. No one really paid attention. These opening speeches were always boring: the principal droning on about rules, values, grades, and making the most of the year.  
  
And this year wasn’t any different. He stepped onto the stage with his professional smile, his voice calm and rehearsed. He began with the same opening we’d heard every year:  
  
“Welcome to this new school year. We’re excited to see you all again.”  
  
Some students continued chatting, others stared at their phones. Even I was distracted, my gaze lost on the ceiling, wondering how much longer this would take.  
  
Eventually, the principal reached the predictable ending of his speech:  
  
“We hope this school year will be filled with learning and success for each of you,” he said with a practiced enthusiasm, his expression almost fatherly.  
  
Then he paused, taking a long breath. His tone shifted.  
  
“Before we finish, there’s something important we need to address.”  
  
The phrase caught some of our attention. Though a few students continued to ignore him, the noise gradually died down.  
  
“Some of you may have heard rumors, but we want to make sure everyone is informed.”  
  
A heavier silence settled over the room. There were still whispers here and there, but his words were starting to sink in. He continued:  
  
“In recent days, there have been reports of people who, when angered, develop… a certain condition.”  
  
He stopped, scanning the auditorium as if to ensure he had everyone’s attention. “Please, we urge you to control your emotions. Don’t let anger take over. It can be more dangerous than you think.”  
  
Tension crept into the room.  
  
“If you encounter someone who is extremely angry,” he added, “it might be best to keep your distance.”  
  
Some students chuckled nervously, trying to defuse the unease. Others exchanged uneasy glances, suddenly more aware of the emotions in the room.  
  
I didn’t know what to think. It was a strange warning, even absurd, but something in the way he said it left me with a bad feeling.  
  
Judging by the others, most probably thought it was just a dramatic caution against teenage temper tantrums. Maybe it was a vague reference to the fights that had happened in past years, or even something like road rage—a common issue recently.  
  
When we left the auditorium, most people acted as though nothing had happened. Some even joked about it, like my friend Alan, who had arrived late that day and was now doing a goofy impression of the principal: “Control your emotions, or you’ll turn into the Hulk.”  
  
We laughed, but deep down, I felt this wasn’t something to joke about.  
  
The day started off normal. Classes resumed without any issues, teachers went over the usual syllabi, and everyone carried on with their day. But as the morning progressed, things began to feel… off.  
  
During lunch, a girl started yelling at another over something trivial. They were in the cafeteria line, and it seemed like they’d been arguing earlier. Suddenly, the first girl collapsed, clutching her head as if something inside her had snapped. A few students rushed to help and eventually carried her to the nurse’s office.  
  
Daniel, ever the joker, nudged Carla. “Good thing you only hang out with us,” he said with a wry grin.  
  
“That sounded a little sexist,” Carla shot back with a playful glare.  
  
We all laughed, except for Alan, who was probably outside playing basketball. He hated cafeteria food and always said he’d rather eat after working out.  
  
The incident with the girl caught everyone’s attention at the time, but by the end of lunch, most had moved on, assuming it was just a fainting spell—maybe caused by low blood sugar or stress.  
  
Our next class was History, held in a second-floor classroom. As usual, we took seats in the back row. True to his word, Alan pulled out some cookies and started eating them mid-class, which of course caught the teacher’s attention.  
  
“I don’t understand how you can eat during class when you’ve already had time for that,” the teacher scolded, visibly annoyed. What followed was a short rant about respect for rules and the supposed lack of discipline in our generation. “Please, put your food away and refrain from eating in my class,” he finished sternly.  
  
The lesson continued, but it was clear the teacher was still irritated. His face was flushed, his anger bubbling just beneath the surface. He seemed to have forgotten the principal’s advice about controlling emotions.  
  
When class ended, a sudden scream shattered the quiet. It came from one of the hallways, followed by the unmistakable sound of shattering glass.  
  
We rushed out to see what had happened. A window was broken, leaving a large hole that opened to the outside. A crowd of students gathered, their expressions a mix of confusion and fear. The air felt thick, and on many faces, I noticed something unsettling: barely-contained rage, ready to erupt.  
  
Carla and Abraham looked just as uneasy as I felt. Their eyes darted around, searching for answers in the faces around them, but only finding fear. Alan, however, seemed calm despite the chaos.  
  
Daniel tried to play it cool, crossing his arms as if staying composed could make everything go away. But I noticed his hands trembling slightly.  
  
A chill ran down my spine. I wanted to look away, but I couldn’t. My mind raced, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. What was happening to everyone? Was this what the principal had warned us about?  
  
“Guys, do you think we should…?” Abraham began, his voice unsteady.  
  
“Yes, definitely,” Carla answered before he could finish.  
  
“But where can we go?” I asked, bewildered.  
  
“I can drive you all home; I just need to get my car from the parking lot,” Daniel suggested.  
  
We agreed that it was the best idea. We weren’t the only ones leaving—others were also heading for the exits. On our way to the lot, I noticed more and more people—students and teachers alike—with those same tense, angry expressions. It was disturbing.  
  
When we reached Daniel’s car, we hurried inside, but the engine wouldn’t start. Daniel tried several times, growing more frustrated with each attempt, until he finally slammed his fists on the steering wheel.  
  
“Damn it!” he growled.  
  
“Maybe printers aren’t the only things that can smell fear,” Alan joked, trying to lighten the mood.  
  
“What do we do now?” Carla asked, her voice trembling.  
  
“We can go to my apartment,” Abraham offered. “At least until we figure out what’s going on.”  
  
“Where is it?” Carla asked.  
  
“Two blocks from here,” Abraham replied. “Just follow me.”  
  
We all agreed, except for Alan, who decided to walk home.  
  
“Are you sure?” Daniel asked.  
  
“Yeah, don’t worry. I’ll be fine,” Alan said confidently.  
  
We got out of Daniel’s car and said goodbye to Alan. As we left the school, we saw emergency vehicles arriving—an ambulance with its lights flashing, followed by a nondescript black van. Something about that van sent a shiver down my spine.  
  
“What the hell is going on?” Daniel muttered, more nervous than before.  
  
When we reached Abraham's building, we climbed the stairs to his apartment. He locked the door behind us and offered us something to drink. We had barely settled in when the power went out.  
  
“This is just perfect!” Abraham exclaimed, clearly irritated.  
  
Daniel and Carla tried to call their families, but the signal inside the apartment was weak. I suggested they send texts or try social media instead.  
  
“I’ll be right back,” Abraham said suddenly, stepping into the hallway.  
  
While he was gone, I searched online for answers. None of the news sites provided anything useful, so I turned to Twitter. There, I found a thread posted that very morning discussing rumors of people who, after getting angry, displayed not only psychological symptoms but also physical ones over time.  
  
The thread explained that for about a month, cases had been reported of individuals who, after a bout of rage, developed a strange psychological disorder. The initial symptoms were disturbing: abrupt changes in behavior ranging from anxiety and depression to alarming memory loss and impaired cognitive functions.  
  
However, what truly captured attention were the physical effects. According to the thread, affected individuals experienced progressive loss of coordination, involuntary movements, and even visible changes in appearance. It all began with a slight reddish coloration of the skin, usually on the face, which could spread until it covered the entire body. Then, the hue would darken, turning into a grayish or purplish shade, as though the skin were marked by countless bruises.  
  
Perhaps that explained why that student had fallen—or gone through—the window, and why so many people around seemed stuck in a perpetual expression of anger, unable to relax after a fit of rage. However, the case of the girl who had collapsed in the cafeteria remained a mystery; the thread made no mention of sudden fainting.  
  
What was most unsettling were the warnings. According to the post, it wasn’t clear how much time passed between a rage episode and the onset of symptoms. Some cases reported hours or even days, but there were also accounts of people showing the first signs just minutes later. It was also unknown whether the condition was contagious, although the thread advised staying away from anyone who had experienced an outburst, even if they weren’t yet showing visible signs.  
  
The most important advice was perhaps the hardest to follow: avoid getting angry at all costs. "Sooner or later, we all get angry, even over trivial things," I thought as I reread that line. But now, it seemed that giving in to such a basic impulse might be far more dangerous than we’d ever imagined.  
  
Intrigued, I decided to explore the profile of the account that had posted the thread. The nickname was a combination of letters and numbers: D13s1r43. Something about that name made me uneasy, though I couldn’t pinpoint why. What truly surprised me was discovering that the account had been created just two months ago and already had over 2,000 followers.  
  
"How is that possible?" I wondered, though the answer seemed obvious: the thread had garnered several thousand likes in just a few hours. However, the thread was locked; no comments could be made on it. Was it to prevent questioning or to avoid unnecessary outbursts in the comments? After all, many tweets were prone to heated discussions.  
  
I couldn’t take my eyes off the screen. Every word pulled me further into a vortex of paranoia.  
  
So engrossed was I in my search for answers that I didn’t realize Abraham was still missing, and the power was still out.  
  
"Maybe I should go down and check on him," Daniel suggested, breaking the tense silence.  
  
"It’s better if we don’t open the door," Carla quickly countered. "He shouldn’t be long..."  
  
A dull thud cut off her sentence. It came from the door.  
  
The handle slowly turned, and the door opened just enough for Abraham to enter. He stood frozen in the doorway, as if unsure of what to do next. The dim light in the room barely revealed his silhouette, but as he stepped forward, the faint glow from the hallway illuminated his face.  
  
It was covered in dark spots. It wasn’t dirt or sweat; it was as if his skin was turning black. And his expression… it showed no anger, fear, or pain. Just a blankness that was more disturbing than any scream.  
  
My heart started pounding, thumping in my chest like it was trying to warn me of imminent danger. I looked at my friends, searching for a reaction, some sign that they saw it too, that it wasn’t just my overactive imagination. But no one said a word. Daniel leaned forward slightly; Carla stepped back a pace. We were all frozen.  
  
At that moment, I knew. I had to leave. It wasn’t just fear; it was something more visceral, something primal that activated my most basic instincts: Run while you can. But even so, I struggled to stay composed.  
  
"Abraham, are you okay?" I asked, trying to sound calm, though my voice came out barely a whisper.  
  
He took another step inside, his feet dragging as though weighed down by a heavy burden. Then he lifted his head, his movements slow and mechanical.  
  
"Yeah… I just need to..." he mumbled, before abruptly stopping.  
  
He moved a little farther and then suddenly dropped to his knees. We all flinched at the sound of his body hitting the floor. Abraham tilted his head forward and began to vomit.  
  
Daniel reacted almost immediately, grabbing his arm and struggling to lead him to the bathroom. Carla, on the other hand, remained rooted to the spot. Her look of disgust was evident, but it wasn’t just that. Her phobia of vomit and anything grotesque kept her immobilized. She stepped back a few paces, raising a hand as if it could shield her.  
  
"We need to get help!" Daniel shouted from the bathroom, his voice laden with panic.  
  
"I would call emergency services, but there’s no signal!" Carla snapped back, trembling as she checked her phone.  
  
I said nothing, frozen in place. I glanced toward the open apartment door, to the staircase leading downstairs, and made a decision.  
  
"I’ll get help," I murmured, almost to myself, as if saying it aloud would steel my resolve.  
  
I left the apartment without looking back, descending the stairs so quickly I felt I might trip at any moment. The echo of my footsteps sounded like a countdown, each step amplifying my fear. When I reached the street, the scene offered no solace. It was eerily quiet, more so than usual, as though the world were holding its breath.  
  
I paused for a moment to survey my surroundings, but my thoughts raced faster than my eyes. The image of Abraham vomiting wouldn’t leave my mind, and the words from the Twitter thread buzzed in my head like a terrifying mantra: “It’s unclear if it can be contagious.”  
  
At that moment, I remembered Daniel’s outburst of anger in the parking lot, and the words from the thread hammered into my mind again. I felt a little guilty for Carla, who was still with them. If all this were true, sooner or later, she could end up screwed too.  
  
I wondered if I might already be screwed myself.  
  
I bit my lip, trying to decide what to do. My family was several miles away, and I didn’t know if they were aware of what was happening, but either way, I wanted to be with them. Although for a moment, I gave up on the idea of seeing them; maybe I was already screwed, and if this was contagious, I could unknowingly pass it on to them.  
  
Finally, I decided to walk home. Maybe, along the way, I’d find help for my friends or, at the very least, some answers.  
  
“I should’ve just gone my own way, like Alan did,” I muttered to myself, regretting my recent decisions. “No. I should’ve refused Daniel’s offer and left as soon as I could,” I concluded, but then I thought about the teacher and all the guys and girls we passed in the hallway. Maybe I am screwed already.  
  
As I walked, the streets seemed to unravel into a strange and unsettling scene. There were no cars, no adults; just a few students wandering nearby. I recognized some faces, classmates, but there was something profoundly wrong with them.  
  
Their expressions were unnatural: clenched jaws, bloodshot eyes, thick veins pulsing in their temples. It was as if anger wasn’t a temporary state but a disease that had taken over, distorting them more with each passing second. They weren’t just angry people; they were something else, as though rage had taken control, reducing them to grotesque caricatures of themselves.   
  
Yet, for some reason, they didn’t seem intent on attacking me. I was afraid that it might happen, and that I’d have to run for my life or even fight them. Clearly, nothing had been reported about that. At least, it hadn’t been mentioned in that thread. Although, of course, it could be something else that perhaps hadn’t been documented yet.  
  
I quickened my pace until I realized I was running, ignoring their vacant stares that seemed to pierce my back. Farther ahead, I spotted a glimmer of hope: an ambulance parked in the middle of the street. But the scene was far from reassuring. The paramedics, dressed in biohazard suits that made them look like astronauts, were loading an isolation capsule into the ambulance.  
  
"Wait! I need help!" I shouted, running toward them.  
  
Two paramedics got out from the back of the ambulance but paid me no attention. They walked past me as if I were invisible, heading toward a nearby wall with what looked like a large rolled-up poster. My frustration grew.  
  
"Please, it’s urgent! My friends are in danger!" I insisted, but it was useless.  
  
As they unrolled the poster and taped it to the wall, I caught a glimpse of what it depicted. The image froze me in place: a man with an exaggerated expression of fury, his face grotesquely distorted, as though the anger had swollen his features beyond recognition. His skin was a bizarre shade of orange, a visual warning of something monstrous.  
  
Beneath the image, in bold black letters, the message was as clear as it was chilling:  
  
"AVOID GETTING ANGRY OR YOU WILL END UP LIKE THIS"
