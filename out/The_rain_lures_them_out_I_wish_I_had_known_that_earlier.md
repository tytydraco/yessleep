One time I was trying to sleep without a tent. That’s when I learned that when it rains, you better hide.

This happened only two weeks ago, while I was hiking in the woods and trying survival type camping. 

I had already built myself a tiny shelter and a campfire next to it. My meal was just done cooking and I got on a plate. 

My meal was a one pot cheesy mushroom pasta. It smelled so nice. 

I was sitting at my shelter and eating when it started to rain, not much though. There was this fresh smell of rain, I loved it. For now at least. 

When I had finished my meal, I saw some movement and heard little steps. 

I thought they were frogs at first, then I heard their croaks echoing in the forest. That made me feel really cozy for a moment.

Suddenly there came this small frog-like creature from behind a tree but it stood on both feet, its skin glistened in the moonlight. Then another one appeared and after that I could see maybe twenty of those creatures.

They ran around and croaked like frogs too. It seemed like they talked to each other. They were wandering around presumably looking for something to eat.

They ignored me for the most part but one tried to sneak his way to my plate. That plate had a little bit of leftovers from my meal. 

That small creature thought I didn’t see him. It approached from behind me. 

Just as it was in reach, I grabbed it. 

It was slimy as hell. As soon as my hand came in contact with it, my hand started to burn. It wasn’t that bad at first but the pain grew every second. 

Then that creature bit me. It had really sharp teeth, it felt like they went right through my hand. 

I dropped the creature and it ran off. 

My hand burning and bleeding from the bite, I had to think of something. 

Watching these creatures I noticed one of them accidentally stepped on the coals in the campfire. After that they started avoiding the campfire. The fire wasn’t on but it was still warm and the coals were hot. 

When I noticed that, I got an idea. I had crafted a torch earlier, just in case. I lit the torch and kept it close.

Then I waved it around and shouted like a mad man. The creatures scattered around and vanished. They seemed to be terrified of fire. 

After a while the rain stopped and I fell asleep. 

The next morning I woke up to the sunlight hitting my face. I felt weird, was last night a dream? That morning there were no birds singing and the forest was unusually quiet. 

I made a fire to cook breakfast on and then went to collect some berries and mushrooms.

While searching for the mushrooms and berries, I saw one of those weird creatures on the ground. 

It was all dried up and I assumed it had died. I examined the creature carefully. 

I poked it a couple of times, no burning sensation this time. That was really intriguing. I grabbed the creature and examined its teeth.

Those teeth looked really sharp and were about 4 cm long. There were only 5 teeth though. I touched the teeth and felt it slice my finger. I started bleeding at that point.

The air felt fresh, the wind's small but steady breeze was just enough to cool me down a bit. 

The forest was pretty quiet, except for a few cracking branches and some birds in the distance. I thought that this night would become one of the most memorable and enjoyable nights in my life. 

“Lighting strikes” 

Suddenly a really rough storm began and it started raining really hard. I got spooked and dropped that little thing.

Suddenly the dried creature twitched and it got up and started running around.

That startled me, how could it still live. I had just grabbed it and I presumed it was dead. 

Anyway, that little creature got curious about me. It started approaching. 

I had prepared for that and got my knife out. It came close, too close. That’s when I hit it. 

The knife sliced that tiny creature in half and it flew to the bushes. It felt weirdly soft, rubbery and a thick slime was left on the edge of my blade.

Before I could even process that, two of those creatures came out from that bush. 

They multiply if sliced. This was something really bizarre, it felt a bit magical but terrifying at the same time. That got me thinking about, how could I even survive if they multiply every time you try to slice them?
