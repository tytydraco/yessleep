Memories work in interesting ways. Some from a decade past are clear and vivid and last week could be a fog. There are periods  time erased, however the past has shallow graves. It only takes a few words to bring everything back to the surface.

For me, it was my mother’s voice at the kitchen table.

“Do you remember your imaginary friend?” she asked, stirring her coffee, thinking back to what she thought was childhood whimsy.

And just like that, the name crawled out from the dark.

Mister Stranger.

It didn’t feel like a memory. It felt like waking up mid-conversation with something you’d forgotten you were listening to. Most people recall flashes from early childhood an emotion, a birthday, a toy. I remember him. And I think he remembers me.

He came during the year I was homeschooled. Lonely doesn’t even cover it. I had no friends, no playmates. My parents were good people, just… busy. I lived in silence, days swallowed by the buzz of a box fan and the creak of a two-story house.

Until he came.

It started with a tapping.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I was six. I remember it was past midnight. I crept to the window, heart thudding in my chest like a rabbit in a trap. I pulled back the curtain expecting wind or a branch or nothing.

But there were no trees near my window.

Only the long black beyond the glass, the moon hanging heavy above the distant woods.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

Closer now. From the other side of the glass.

Then, a voice. Calm. Deep. Velvet-soft and serpentine.

“May I come in?”

I should have screamed. But I was lonely, and children will trust anything that speaks softly enough.

I cracked the window.

The night breathed in. I could smell moss and something burnt. I listened. But the voice was gone. So I shut it and backed into bed, heart still thumping.

The window creaked shut on its own.

That night, as I buried myself beneath the blanket, I felt breath on my neck.

“Don’t worry,” he whispered, right behind me. “I’ve got you.”

And I believed him.

Mister Stranger became everything to me. I never saw him then, but I felt him—hovering just behind the veil of sight, like looking at a star that vanishes when stared at. We’d talk. We’d play. He would tell me strange stories about roots that strangle and moons that bleed. I’d laugh, because I thought he was being silly. I was a child.

He taught me games.

We’d draw together. Symbols. Circles. Spirals that made my hand cramp as it spun over and over like it wasn’t mine.

“What is it?” I asked, giggling.

“Home,” he replied.

We covered the walls with the drawings. Pages and pages—odd marks and runes that made no sense to me, but made him hum with approval.

“They’re for your protection,” he said. “From the ones beneath.”

I didn’t ask what that meant.

I just kept drawing.

My parents found the pages.

They tore them down, threw them out with the garbage. Called them nonsense. Called me disturbed.

That night, Mister Stranger didn’t speak.

He had left me. 

And then the dreams came.

They were not dreams. They were burials.

Each night I was dragged—screaming—into the black soil. Hands with too many knuckles clawed at my limbs. I was pulled beneath the roots, into a place that pulsed like a dying heart. I’d wake screaming, soaked in piss and sweat, throat raw and lungs empty.

My parents let me sleep with them after the second night. It didn’t help.

Because even there they could save me in my dream. 

The last night of it all happened when they finally put me back in my room.

Mom tucked me in.

“Why did my friend leave?” I asked her, barely above a whisper.

“I don’t know, baby,” she said, brushing my hair back. “But you’ve got me.”

But her warmth wasn’t the same.

Her love didn’t reach as deep.

I lay in silence.

Then—

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I bolted to the window, heart pounding with joy and terror.

I flung it open.

“Welcome home!” 

They words echoed into the void as the night overtook me.

The forest was alive.

I don’t know how I got there. I remember the window, then darkness, then trees so many trees. Their branches twisted like antlers, blotting out the moon.

My legs bled. My feet were raw. My pajamas shredded by thorns and bramble.

I screamed for help.

No one answered.

Then came the footsteps.

At first, just one set. Then more. Dozens. Hundreds. All around me. Pattering through the underbrush like bare feet on wet tile.

I could hear in unison the gnarled growl of dozens of empty stomachs. 

They weren’t just chasing me.

They were herding me.

I ran. My breath ripped my throat. My lungs burned. I didn’t know where I was going—I just needed out.

I ran as the sharp claws of the forest reached and pulled at my clothing. 

The harsh bramble and thorns cut into my legs and feet. 

I ran, the skittering followed but I never saw my pursuers. 

The air grew colder. The ground steeper. My tears blurred the world.

I broke through the trees and fell—rolling down a hill, branches snapping against my back.

Then-thud.

I hit pavement.

A road.

I tried to scream for help, but only a rasp came out.

Then, in the distance, headlights.

Blinding. Barreling toward me.

I tried to rise. My ankle screamed in protest.

The light roared.

And just before it hit me—

I saw him.

Tall. Wrong. Strings for limbs. A body like a silhouette carved out of darkness. And a face, no face. Just a reflection. A mirror, twisting my own terrified face back at me.

Then nothing.

I woke in my bed.

Covered in mud. Burrs stuck to my skin. My legs bloodied and scratched. Pajamas torn. My feet looked flayed, like I’d been dragging them through glass.

But the room?

Pristine.

No mud. No trail. No open window.

Just me.

Shaking. Breathing. Remembering.

My parents panicked, they couldn’t explain my wounds, and the mess. Especially with the house showing no signs of it. They didn’t believe my story that I just appeared in the woods or especially that Mister Stranger saved me. But there was no explanation.

It was after that day he was gone, or he didn’t show himself to me. The days went by, I started public school, life moved on.

I had nearly forgotten of all of it until that simple question. 

But lately…

The tapping’s back.

Not at the window.

Inside my head.

Soft. Reassuring. Almost like it’s humming.

I keep telling myself I’m fine. That I just haven’t been sleeping well. That nothing is waiting in the dark.

But just now, after writing all this down, I went to splash some water on my face.

I looked up at the mirror.

And in the reflection of my pupil just a glint, just for a second I saw him.

Long limbs. Faceless. Twisting ever so slightly, like a shadow caught mid-dance.

And I don’t know what’s worse…

That he’s back…

Or that he’s always been there.

Watching. Waiting. Smiling with a mouth I’ll never see.

But somehow…

I think everything’s going to be okay.

He’s got me.
