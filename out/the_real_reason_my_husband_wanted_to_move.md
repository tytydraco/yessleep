i was at home watching the news finishing a mcdouble when my husband told me he wanted to move. it was extremely sudden, we had been living in this house for no problems for years, the only problem we ever had was long ago in our relationship when he was sleeptalking about shadows in the house, i brushed it off as weird dreams but now i regret it, i have been packing my things for the last few days, it's been hard and i don't want to move but i also love my husband and i want to understand, the first hints i got of why started the night my husband decided he wanted to move, he started sleeptalking again, at first nothing much, my name slipping out between nonsense, but at midnight i was woken up by him sleeptalking about the shadows again. i thought it was his dreams again but why would he even be dreaming about shadows? it was unsettling and confusing but nothing more.

he started taking pictures of our rooms in the morning, he said it was to keep the memories alive, odd but ok, my husband has always been a bit of a weirdo, i would hear photos snapping while i was packing all that day, we had packed our most important belongings into our truck's trunk, but then the day before we were set to leave someone broke into our house, not much was left for him to steal except after he escaped our house my husband realized the camera he had recorded everything with was gone, not just the pictures of our house but all of our memories, our wedding video, our birthdays, everything.

"it's gone" my husband said as he looked all over for it, i was sad because we had lost our memories and other things of money value, we decided to stay longer, but while i was window shopping on ebay for fun to distract myself i saw the camera he used, i instantly bought it and told my husband, it arrived a few days later and me and my husband sat down to watch our old memories. ill never forget what i saw.

the videos started normal, happy memories of me and my husband when we were dating but something seemed off about my proposal video, it was at the top of a mountain near our house, we were looking at our home from above when i proposed, he said yes and i was super excited, but in the faint tiny view of my house i saw a shadowy figure through the window, that was only the first time the shadow appeared, it appeared in the background of most images and videos getting closer every time.

then on what was supposed to be our wedding video at the end the shadow grabbed the camera, the video cut off briefly but came back a few seconds later, the camera was pointed at me and my husband's bed, the clock read 3:03 am, this became a pattern, in all the videos at some time between 2:30 am and 3:15 am something would watch us sleep sometimes whispering words from a language neither of us could identify. we had reached the last picture, we didn't take this one, it was a picture of my husband with the words "tonight" written down, this was so confusing, but not illegal so i couldn't call the cops, i couldn't sleep last night, i ended up taking a sleeping pill instead, i woke up to a scream, i looked next to me, my husband was gone. the shadow was dragging his body away, now i am having dreams about the shadows coming ckose to me in the darkness, i checked the camera again and it had 1 more video that i hadn't seen before.

it was a man tied to a chair with a sack on his head, the shadow walked into frame and removed the bag, i finally saw who it was, it was my husband. it tortured him until he passed out then BANG, a shot to my husband's chest, then another bang, this time it wasn't coming from the recording, it was coming from inside my house
