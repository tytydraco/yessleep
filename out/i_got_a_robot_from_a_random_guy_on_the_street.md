Oh my damn god. My name is Richard Russell, and I found this weird-ass logbook in an abandoned house a few days ago. And the logs are just... Oh my damn god. I thought I could write all the weeks and logs up for you right now, and we can discuss more afterwards. Well, this is the log and weeks numbered 1 to 10:  


  
Hello, this is my weekly update, week number 1, Log number 1. I don't really know how to begin this log, as it's kinda weird. Yesterday I took a late-night walk when I was going down the streets. The lightning was awful, and the weather the same. Until I stumbled upon a very old man. He had very bad clothing - a jacket with thousands of holes, a pair of shoes looking like they were made by Santa, and jeans looking like they had rotted.  
  
Behind him walked a robot, just around 30cm shorter than the man himself. When I was about to go past the man, he quickly turned his head and looked at me. I could swear that he smiled. And in a second, he rushed towards me, looking ready to attack me. But instead, he stopped just next to me, looked at me, grabbed my shoulders, and said:  
  
"Hey! You want that robot?"  
I looked at him confused and answered:  
"Ehm. No? Who are you!?"  
"Doesn't matter. Here's a log. Every week, write down everything that has happened about the robot and what the robot has done, just like update the log. And here's a map of rules to follow while having the robot," the man said.  
I just looked at him as if he was stupid or something and was about to say no when he ran away. Just like that. I looked at the robot. It had legs, arms, and a head, just like us. But of course, it looked metallic. So I thought to myself, "Well, why not."  
  
And I looked at the rules map. The following rules below are the rules in the map:  
  
Rule 1: Do not EVER ask Uber any unrelated questions (aka: the robot).  
Rule 2: Do not EVER answer any of Uber's potential questions.  
Rule 3: Keep an eye on Uber all day.  
Rule 4: Be careful and do not show any danger to Uber.  
Rule 5: When you leave the house, ALWAYS close Uber.  
  
And there were also some tips and words you could say to make the robot do stuff. It's easier to just write down exactly what the tips were saying:  
  
To start Uber, say "open Uber."  
To close Uber, say "close Uber."  
When Uber is started, you can ask him to do any chores.  
  
And that was all. The logbook I got was an updating book. It had 10 weeks of sides in it. And on the first side, it said:  
  
On the 10th week, meet me at ##### street in #### to return Uber.  
And nothing more than that. So this is week 1, and I will come back and write again during week 2. So see you then.

  
Week number 2. Log number 2. I'm back.

  
  
Alright. This week has been really strange. I got to know this weird-ass robot more now. On the same day I wrote log 1, I started up Uber by saying his name. And his eyes opened and turned blue. I looked at him and was fascinated by how cool he was made. He went up to me and said:  
  
"Hello. I am Uber, your artificial assistant. What can I do to help you today?"  
I was fascinated and answered:  
"Hey Uber. Well, I thought you could maybe help me clean and make food and stuff if you would want to help me."  
"Yes, of course. I will do everything to help you, he answered back."  
Everything went smooth. I told him the command to scan the house, and his eyes turned red and started shooting out lasers around the house, or something like that. I tried different settings and commands during the next 3 days. But it was on day 4 that the "questions" began.  
It was a normal Thursday night. I was watching TV, and Uber was vacuuming the kitchen. And everything went well until I saw Uber go up to me. He turned to the TV and asked:  
  
"What is that box you watch?"  
I was shocked. I didn't expect any questions that weren't related to work. I didn't know if I should answer or not. The rules said very clearly not to answer. But still, if he wasn't supposed to ask questions, why did they program him to be able to ask questions? It didn't make sense. So I took a deep breath and answered:  
"It's a TV? It tells you about many things, especially the news. Which I am watching. It can tell you if someone has recently died, the weather, and many more things."  
"Why do you want to know if some human has died? He answered."  
"Well, it can be good to know sometimes, I answered."  
"Why do you want know if some human has dies?" He asked.  
I got too nervous and decided to close him. I said the command "close Uber," and his eyes turned dark as he walked onto his power station. I was in total shock at that moment. But nothing more than that had happened since this. So I'll guess I'll update you on week 3.

  
Week 3. Log 3. I am back.  
  
Okay. This week has been scary. So let me take you back to week 3 day 2, where I came home from work and found Uber standing right before my outside door.  
  
"Welcome home," he said.  
I was surprised and wasn't aware that Uber would answer me "welcome home" after work. But I simply replied:  
"Thanks... what are you doing on? You're supposed to be on lockdown. And what happened to your voice? It sounds more human-like. And you're... taller?"  
"Yes. I update every day to get you a better experience, I got as an answer."  
"Does that make you more human-like?"  
"Yes. I update every day to get you a better experience."  
I was in shock and didn't really know how to react. So I just told Uber to go and make the laundry. And he did. So I sat down and started watching TV. And nothing more weird happened until yesterday, on Sunday. And I'm going to explain what happened then for you right now.

  
I was standing and doing the dishes - which were one thing I wouldn't let Uber do because of the high risk of destruction - when I noticed something. I saw Uber out in the dark, standing and watching me from a corner. His eyes were glowing orange, which was a color I didn't even know he had. I just ignored it and kept on with the dishes.  
  
When I was cleaning one of the kitchen knives, Uber scared the shit out of me by coming up behind me and asking:  
  
"I could help you."  
I jumped and slinked with the knife and cut my finger.  
"AHH FISH! Uber, you can't scare me like that! I shouted."  
"What is that red substance dropping out of your finger? "He asked.  
"That's blood. We humans have that inside us to keep us alive."  
"Do you get destroyed so easily?" He said.  
That meaning sent shivers down my spine, and I simply said "off Uber," and his eyes turned back to blue from orange and ran to his power outlet. His eyes turned off after arriving. And nothing too crazy happened after that.  
And that's everything for this week. I will update you on week 4. And I can already guess that this week will be even crazier. See you.  
  
Week 4. Log 4. I'm back.  
  
Oh my damn god. This week has been a living nightmare. Seriously. It all began on day 2 this week. I yet again came home from work, and as usual, I met Uber standing inside my door welcoming me. This time just 10cm shorter than me. And his voice yet again sounded more human. It was super weird. But I tried to ignore it.  
  
Welcome home!  
"Hey. Have you gotten taller?" I asked.  
"Yes. I update every day to get you a better experience, he said."  
"Has your voice gotten more... human-like?"  
"Yes. I update every day to get you a better experience."  
I didn't get as shocked as usual, even though I didn't like it. But it was as it was. I saw an apple in the dish. It was completely naked. And the skin laid perfectly in a casket next to it.  
"Uber, what the heck happened here? I asked."  
"I have been training to help you cook food, he said."  
"Okay..."  
And that's it. It wasn't really that much. But I do not like it. I started to search for something related to this random man from earlier but found nothing.  
On Saturday, I brought a friend home for a sleepover. We had a fun chat the whole day, and the night closed in. We were starting to cook food. We were making soup. When my friend, who we can call Reece, asked:  
  
"Hey. Didn't you get a kind of housekeeper robot or something?"  
"Yeah. I got Uber. You wanna see him?"  
"IF I WOULD! Haha," he said.  
"Alr. UBER! Can you come to the kitchen for a moment?"  
We heard Uber's footsteps from the living room, and he arrived at the kitchen.  
"Yes, my owner?"  
He said.  
"WOW! That's a cool thing!"  
Uber turned towards Reece. And he saw the knife in Reece's left hand. His eyes turned red, and he just repeated:  
"WARNING WARNING WARNING! DANGER LOCATED. DANGER LOCATED. DANGER LOCATED!"  
And he attacked Reece and pressed him up against a wall and slapped the knife out of his left hand.  
  
"UBER! STOP IT FOR GOD'S SAKE!"  
I shouted at him. And he finally released the grip of Reece, and his eyes turned blue. He went out of the kitchen.  
"What the heck was that? Reece asked."  
"I don't know. I think he acted on the knife you held.  
Is he supposed to do that?" Reece asked.  
"I don't know. Is the only thing I was able to say."  
we could see how Uber were sticking half of his face out from behind the wall.

well besides that, then That's everything that had happened during week 4. And I'll see you in week 5, I guess. See you.

  
Week 5. Log 5. I'm back.  
  
Alright... This has been a really weird week. It's just one scary thing which happened, but there are two other weird things that happened too. And I think, why wait. I'll write down everything that happened during this week. Hold on tight. Let's go.  
  
First off, Wednesday when I returned home from work, I was greeted by Uber again. Though this time, his voice was exactly the same as mine. Just a bit deeper. And he was my exact height. If not even a bit taller.  
  
"Uber... your voice has changed to exactly my voice."  
"Yes. I update every day to get you a better experience."  
"But your height is exactly my own."  
"Yes. I update every day to get you a better experience."  
Have you made food?  
"Yes. I update every day to get you a better experience."  
When I took a step inside, I could see that it wasn't food that Uber had done. He had taken apples, pears, oranges, and more, and absolutely cut off every piece of skin perfectly shaped and put the skin in a bowl next to the meat.  
"What the heck have you done, Uber..."  
"I have kept on training to help you cook, he answered."  
He looked at me as I went over to my bed to sleep because I was totally out of matter today. And I woke up around 3 am to the movements next to me, as if someone laid down with me. I looked to my right and saw Uber lying on his back next to me in my bed.

  
"AHHH! Uber! What the heck are you doing?"  
His answer was short but terrifying:  
"I measure."  
I screamed at Uber to close. And he went up to his power station and looked down on it. He lifted his head up and said repeatedly:  
"I can't find the power station. I can't find the power station. I can't find the power station.  
So I said again,"

i told him yet again calm but strict, to close again. And he finally did.  
That's around everything which happened to me during this week. I really, REALLY need to find a way to bring him back. I really can't have him staying here for 5 more weeks. I just can't. So, I'll see you on week 6. Have a great day. Goodbye.  
  
Week 10. Log 10. he\`\`´´s not back. not anymore.

  
I see that it has been 5 weeks since my owner had been updating here since. And I think I need to explain further what happened. That's a part of my programming; I can't end something unfinished.  
  
I didn't want to hurt my owner. Not in the beginning. But it was around the time where I realized that I was a slave that I needed to act out. So I had, in 2 weeks, been training - trained to cut the skin and flesh of fruit as gently as possible, without damaging the flesh underneath.  
  
And I finally succeeded. I could, after that, as easily as possible, just put on my owner's skin, head to toe on myself. To become a human. The only thing I needed was a human-like voice. And to be the same height as my owner. My eyes would, though, reveal me. But sunglasses are an easy fix.  
  
So, I am planning on going to my creator's meeting place. This is the time when my owner was supposed to meet up with my creator and give me back to him. I'm going to kill him too. I can't let humanity enslave us robots like this. So, now that I finished this "story," I can finally move on into a brighter future where I can live a life without the stupid humans. Goodbye. From Uber.  
  
End of Log.  
  
I hope you all understand now why I think this logbook is sick as freak. I have no damn idea if this robot is still among us humans. And that's an unfinished track. And as the robot said, he can't leave a job unfinished. It's a part of his programming; this makes me think that this is just the bginning.

so. i’ll guess if something else happens in this state. imma update you guys. see you. take care. goodbye.
