“Your coffee sucks, okay? There. I said it. You’re a terrible barista, and that little bitch manager of yours isn’t helping anything, either.” 

I crossed my arms, my face burning red as a fire engine. “*Ahem.*” 

The man whipped around, his intense scowl melting into a wide-eyed stare. “Do you want to repeat that for me, sir? Our *regional* manager is here for a visit, and I don’t think he heard you properly.” Ivan glowered down at the man, who looked as if he wanted to die right then and there. Well, die *again,* that is. 

You see, I work at a coffee shop for the dead. Strange, I know - But don’t get it twisted. I haven’t kicked the bucket yet myself. I might be dead on the inside, but physically, I’m a living, breathing sack of flesh and bones. At least, until this place kills me. 

But Calla, if you’re alive, then how the *hell* are you working with dead people? 

Well, I’m a clairvoyant of sorts. I’ve always been able to see the deceased and interact with them just like anyone else. I know. You probably think I’m making this shit up, and I don’t blame you. But I can assure you that I’m not lying. 

Anywho, the asshole who had just finished berating my employee looked like he’d seen a ghost. I glanced up at Ivan, who stared at the man with an intensity that I’ve rarely seen from anyone, let alone a seven-foot-tall behemoth like him. I almost felt sorry for the guy - until I remembered what he’d done, and any pity that I might have had for him flushed itself down the shitter. 

“Please, mister. I didn’t mean it, okay? I… I’m sorry. Is that what you want to hear?” 

Ivan’s tree trunk arm shot out, and he grabbed the man by the scruff of the neck. The guy’s latte fell to the floor, dousing the tile in coffee. I sighed at the mess, but I didn’t move a muscle. This was too good to miss. 

“Tell sorry to Robby, idiot,” Ivan spat in a heavy Russian accent. 

“S-sorry,” he stammered. I couldn’t stop myself from grinning. 

“It’s okay, sir! I know you didn’t mean it!” Robby beamed, a faux smile plastered across his lips. 

Ivan then dragged his victim to the door, shoved it open, and violently tossed him to the pavement, giving him a parting message as he did. “You are banished. Leave my sight.” I watched, trying not to laugh, as the man scampered away. 

“Ha! That was incredible! You really scared the piss out of him, Ivan.” I turned to find Frank, our regular ex-biker, chuckling as he sipped his espresso.  

“Yes. He will not have piss to give.” 

Frank and I locked eyes, our brows furrowed. “Uh… what?” I said, still trying to comprehend what Ivan was even going for with that statement.

“He will not be pissing anymore.”

Nope. Still nothing. 

“Ivan, I don’t think that means what you think it does. Anyway, I’ll get this cleaned up. Thanks for sticking up for me, big guy,” I said, retrieving the mop bucket from behind the counter. 

“You are welcome, Calla. Now, I have report to file,” he replied, stomping to the back office.  

“Good luck with that,” Frank chimed in, eyeing the mess, “The guy left a little bit more than just a spilled latte.” My heart dropped into my stomach. Frank was right. 

A thin trail of dirt and insects led to the door from where the man had been standing. A wide array of different bugs writhed on the ground, crawling in every direction. A knot twisted itself into my gut. 

“Great. Hopefully this won’t escalate into anything serious. You remember what happened the last time some freak put me in her crosshairs.” 

“Yeah, Nona had to get involved. Voodoo is no joke,” Frank said, nodding to the entity with a brown fedora and yellowed newspaper sitting at the back of the shop. I glanced in his direction, pursing my lips. 

Nona (short for no name) isn’t human. The only thing we know about him is that he’s powerful - and he’s on our side. He’s like Aftermath’s own personal guardian angel. If he has to step in, that means shit has hit the fan.

“Hopefully it’s not one of *those* situations,” I replied, the unease settling in my stomach, “But I have a feeling that we haven’t seen the last of our new friend yet.”

\*\*\*

Three days went by with no incidents. Well, none aside from Frank slipping on a napkin and busting his ass on the floor. (You can bet your bottom dollar that I’ll be holding that over his head for the rest of his existence.) But on the fourth day, something… strange happened. 

“Excuse me, *miss*. You have a lot of nerve serving me this - this *abomination.* I demand a full refund and a sincere apology.” 

Pure, unabated rage bubbled within me. Mrs. Abbot had always been one of our more difficult customers. She looks like Corpse Bride, but demands to be wined and dined like Cinderella, which has always infuriated me. I was about to give her a piece of my mind, when I glanced down at the drink she had in her hand. 

There were earthworms in it. 

Not just one, either. I counted at least eight of the slimy things writhing around in Mrs. Abbot’s coffee. My heart dropped, and that feeling of intense unease returned. 

“I am *so* sorry about this, Mrs. Abbot. I have no idea how this happened. I’ll give you a full refund and a coupon for a week’s worth of free drinks, on the house.” 

She gave me the once-over, her judgemental stare scanning me up and down like I was scum on the bottom of her glass slipper. “I suppose that would be sufficient. But if it happens again, you *will* have a lawsuit on your hands, I promise you that.” 

“Yes ma’am, understood,” I replied, mentally rolling my eyes as I went to prepare her a new dewormed drink. She was talking out her ass. The dead have no judicial system. Still, though, the issue was cause for concern. 

“Hey Robby?” I said, approaching him with the disturbing concoction after delivering the new espresso to Princess Pretentious. 

“Yeah? What’s up, Miss Calla?” 

“I’m not getting pissed at you or anything, but I want you to take a look at this.” 

Robby hobbled up to me, leaning heavily on his crutch. He’s only got one leg, and on top of that, he’s a genuinely good kid, so I’ve always had a soft spot for him. But some things are inexcusable. 

Robby leaned in, his eyes growing wide as saucers when he caught sight of the worms. “Any idea how this could have happened?” 

“No! I swear, I would never do anything like that on purpose. M-maybe someone put them in after I made the drink? I don’t know, Miss Calla, you have to believe me!” I could hear the quiver in his voice as he spoke. My heart broke for him. I hated having to grill him like that, but I needed answers. 

“I’m sorry, Robby. I wasn’t trying to accuse you of anything. I know you wouldn’t do that. I just need to figure this out so it doesn’t happen again.” 

I could see the relief wash over his face when I told him that. Another pang of guilt struck me like a lightning bolt. It was clear that he really cared about his job. 

“I’m going to look around. Just let me know if you see any more creepy crawlies, okay?” I said, surveying the area. Robby flashed me a thumbs-up as I stalked over to the empty cups. And that’s when I saw them. 

They were there, clear as day. The cups by the espresso machine weren’t empty like they should have been. Worms had been placed at the bottom of each cup in the stack, wriggling in clusters at the bottom of their plastic prisons. I suddenly had a clear picture of what had happened. 

If someone wasn’t paying close attention, it would be fairly easy to zone out and bury the things under a chunk of ice while preparing the order. That must have been what Robby did - He always was a daydreamer. But that still left one question. 

Who put the worms in our empty cups? I had a sinking feeling that I already knew the answer. 

Things only got worse from there. We began finding more and more insects around the shop, to the point where Ivan called an exterminator - and that’s saying something, because he’s a real cheapskate. 

Even then, the bugs just kept coming - centipedes crawling from the sink, roaches scuttling across the floor, the occasional wasp finding its way into Ivan’s office. It was getting unbearable. 

And then, a week after the original incident, something happened - just like I knew it would. I was preparing Frank’s regular blonde espresso, when I felt a presence at the counter. Something sinister that made my skin crawl, yet seemed oddly familiar at the same time. I glanced up, dreading what I would find. 

Nona stood before me, his fedora tipped downward to hide his face. His newspaper was neatly tucked beneath his arm, and a gloved hand rested on the countertop. I’d interacted with him a handful of times before, but I still haven’t managed to get used to the menacing aura he radiates. 

“Wait. L-let me guess,” I said, trying to subdue the quiver in my voice, “something bad is coming?” 

Nona’s response left me stunned. Normally, the harbinger of doom would leave me with only a cryptic answer. One that warned of immense danger. But this time was different. 

“I’ll handle it.” 

I stood there, jaw nearly hitting the floor, as the entity returned to his seat and unfolded his newspaper like nothing had happened.

“Okaaay,” I said, turning to Robby, who wore an equally puzzled expression, “I guess we’ll leave it up to him.” 

\*\*\*

The real fun didn’t start until the next day. I was fairly certain that nothing crazy would go down. Nona hadn’t come in yet, so, being the all-knowing (I think?) being that he is, I just assumed that we were safe. But I was dead wrong. 

It began with a house fly. 

Just one, lazily buzzing around the counter. I sighed, thinking that it was just a straggler. I watched as it flew around the near-empty shop, eventually landing on Frank’s table. He swatted at it, but missed, smacking the tabletop with a loud *thud.* 

“Calla, are you sure that Ivan really called an exterminator? Awfully coincidental that he had to go away on ‘business’ right after the problem arose, don’t ya think?” 

“Believe me, I know how it looks, but I was here when the dude stopped by. Ivan *still* hasn’t shut up about how expensive it was. Just be glad that you don’t have to put up with his bitching.” 

“Heh. Small blessings, I guess,” Frank said, taking a sip from his espresso. 

“Small blessings indeed.” 

My attention shot to the door. I hadn’t even heard anyone come in, but the second that my eyes landed on the man in the entryway, my blood turned to ice. 

It was him. The bug man. I knew that I probably hadn’t seen the last of him, but he’d shown up when I’d least expected it. None of my guardian angels were there to defend the place - Ivan had left to manage another location a day prior. Nona was off doing God-knows-what. Hell, I didn’t have Robby there to thwack the guy with his crutch a few good times. It was just me and Frank - And I knew damn well that Frank wasn’t going to do jack shit. 

“As I was saying,” the creep continued, reveling in the stupor scrawled across my visage, “It really is a blessing that I picked today to pay you a visit. Being that the shop is so empty and all.” 

The room fell silent as I tried to think of a way out of our predicament - but in that moment, the only thing I could focus on were the insects surrounding our unwanted guest in all directions. 

“Wh-what are you?” Frank stammered. 

I rolled my eyes. You should never ask these things what they are, even as one of the dead. Frank knew that. It just gives them an excuse to brag about themselves before they tear you limb from limb. 

“What am *I*?” the man replied, feigning shock. “If you must know, my name is Khepri, lord of the insects! I am the one responsible for your little pest problem as of late, but I presume that you had already gathered as much.”

He glanced between Frank and me, gauging our expressions. He must have determined that we weren’t terrified enough, because he lifted his hands, and the creepy crawlies surrounding him surged into the shop. My eyes grew wide as dinner plates. We were in hot water. 

Spiders and mantises and beetles piled over the counter, trampling each other in their haste. I backed away, looking behind me. No luck. There were even more of the little monstrosities blocking my exit. I was trapped. 

My heart thundered in my chest as Khepri approached me. Hundreds of tiny bodies tumbled off of him with each miniscule movement. I was paralyzed, too afraid to move. Frank’s eyes locked with mine, pleading for help. He wasn’t faring much better. He was standing on a coffee table, cornered by the sea of insects. 

“Come on, Nona. What the hell is taking so long?” I grumbled, futilely swiping away at the small army crawling up my leg. 

“You really shouldn’t have crossed me, girl. It’s unfortunate that your superior is absent. Your transgressions will cost you dearly.” 

I was beginning to think that he was right. I didn’t know where Nona was or what he was doing, but I realized that there was a possibility that he wasn’t going to show up. 

“Now then, are you familiar with this creature?” Khepri asked, opening his hand to reveal a pitch-black spider. It reared back, baring a pair of sharp, pointed fangs. My heart plummeted, and I knew then that I was in real danger. 

“In case you weren’t aware, this is the Sydney Funnel Web. It is one of the most venomous arachnids on the planet, with the ability to end a human’s life in a mere fifteen minutes. But don’t take my word for it. You’re going to find out firsthand.” 

My mind raced, and my legs felt like they were made of lead, but I knew what I had to do. I turned, prepared to flatten any bug that dared to stand between me and the exit - but I couldn’t move. 

Thousands of legs scurried across my skin. The insects didn’t bite. They didn’t sting. But what they did do was *much* worse, considering the situation. 

The little creatures banded together to keep me rooted to the spot, effectively immobilizing me. My eyes grew wide as reality smacked me like a ton of bricks. I was going to die. 

“You really thought you could escape so easily? Ha. Puny human. To me, you are nothing more than an insect. A vile worm that needs to be squashed. And I am about to do just that.” 

Khepri grinned maniacally as he brought the spider closer to my neck. I struggled to fight against my constraints, but it was no use. I didn’t even manage to dislodge a single ant. This was it. I shut my eyes, fully expecting to feel twin fangs piercing my neck at any moment. 

But to my relief, they never did. 

Nona had seemingly materialized out of nowhere behind Khepri. His gloved hand snatched the spider away and I think he… ate it. All I know is that I heard a muffled crunch, and the Sydney Funnel Web was gone. 

“No. No, y-you’re not supposed to be here. I summoned you into my trap. This can’t be happening.” All the color had drained from Khepri’s face, and he looked as if he wanted to pass out. I didn’t blame him. In that moment, the aura that Nona radiated was downright malevolent. He clearly wasn’t happy about being tricked. 

“Look now, I’m certain that we can negotiate some kind of deal. Surely there’s something you must want,” Khepri probed, shrinking back into the counter. 

Nona didn’t respond. He just pointed behind me, his signature fedora still concealing his face. I took that as my cue to look away - And the moment I did, the screams began. 

Guttural shrieks of agony erupted throughout the shop, echoing off the walls. I winced at the sound of bones snapping and the wet squelch of entrails slapping the floor. After a tense moment, the insects holding me prisoner all dropped dead, releasing me from their hold.  

Tens, if not hundreds of thousands of tiny bodies lay scattered in heaps throughout the shop. I chanced a look at Frank, knowing that my savior was out of sight behind the counter. He was absolutely mortified. His eyes looked as if they were going to pop out of their sockets at a moment’s notice, and he was huddled against the window, trembling. I didn’t blame him. He had a front row seat to the action. 

Suddenly, Nona rose to his feet, his job finished. There was no trace of Khepri, aside from a streak of blood on Nona’s fedora. 

“Uh, thanks for saving me, buddy. Maybe get here a litttttle earlier next time, if you can. I was about half a second away from joining these little buggers,” I said, as the adrenaline began to wear off. 

Nona simply flashed me a thumbs-up, then proceeded to consume handfuls of the tiny carcasses, shoveling them into his - face hole? Maw? Endless void? I dunno, *whatever* he’s hiding under there. I was grateful for his help. I was going to need it. 

“Hey Calla, um… I’m gonna go home now,” Frank said, interrupting my train of thought. He was already beginning to climb over the booth on his mission to avoid stepping into the sea of dead insects. 

“Okay, see ya Frank,” I replied, giggling as I watched him clamor over a table. “I’m going to close the shop for the day anyway. Nona and I have a *lot* of cleaning [to do."](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorJunkie123/)
