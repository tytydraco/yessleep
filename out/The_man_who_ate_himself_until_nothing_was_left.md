I started by chewing my nails at work. Pretty normal for someone to do when they get nervous. Throughout the day, I continuously kept chewing. I chewed so much that by the end of the day there was nothing left. I didn't think much of it at the time, but a few hours later I needed to drive home. My hands were pierced with pain. I arrived  home okay after pushing through the pain. I only live about five minutes from work.

It was about a day later when I started to gnaw on my fingers. If you thought biting my nails was bad, try your fingers.
One by one, finger by finger gone. I couldn't drive and my phone became useless. I still tried to call in sick for work but was having a hard time pressing the buttons to call my boss. By this point I knew there was no way I was growing my nails back. I think the rule when you lose a finger is you have about twenty-four hours before blood circulation cuts off. Not much I could do, my fingers were long gone.

The stubs I had left that somewhat looked like hands were pathetic. But at least I still had them, until I started eating them too. It took a while of tearing through my hands. Kind of wore me out if we're being honest. After a couple of hours of chewing and swallowing, I finally got through them. I was completely full and my belly was extremely bloated. At this point I just went to sleep.

Oh lord sleep, I couldn't sleep. The constant aching mixed with the grumbling of my stomach was unbearable. I felt like I was going to vomit. Tossing and turning all night, it was hell!

The next day, my arms. I chewed and chewed, I was quite relieved it wasn't as hard as chewing my hands though it was still challenging. I was hungry when I woke up and obviously I haven't gone grocery shopping in a couple of days. I was quite self conscious about just what people would think walking down the supermarket aisle. “Look mommy, that guy has no nails, fingers, or hands”. I tried gloves to cover my stumps but that didn't work. Without fingers the gloves just looked silly. 

Back to the arms again, they weren't as hard as I thought they would be. Sure I just chewed through two fucking hands but the arms were a cake walk, still I feel like I'm slowly dying everyday and it really fucks with your mood.

I realized if I chew through both of my arms I will kind of just wiggle around like a little caterpillar. I kept one arm operational. At this point, I just wanted to fucking die. No point in living when you're missing both your hands and one arm.

I started chewing my toenails next, felt like I was back at square one, god I miss my hands. More of the same followed. Chew through the nail, next day toes, finally foot. There really wasn't anything to be happy or look forward to anymore. I'd been fired, lost my car, all of my goods spoiled. Life itself was just one big fucking mess at this point.

The toes were just like the fingers, it was nice to be reminded of something even if it has to do with eating yourself. I had absolutely nothing to look forward to except my eventual demise.

Feet were just like the hands, nothing much. I was getting pretty close and was excited for my death. Just a few more days and I will cease to exist.

I was really exhausted but started on the legs, I was gnawing on my legs when I heard a ring on the doorbell. I had my door locked so no one could see inside, so I quickly put on gloves and shoes to hide my horrible disfigurement.

I opened the door with a slight creek, I was really nervous. I didn’t want anyone to see what I had done to myself. I figured I could pass off the missing arm as a missing limb but what about everything else.

I asked “Who are you?”. He said he was a member of some church down the road saving people from eternal damnation. Just what I needed, just as I was waiting for the slow release of death, some missionary had to step in and save me.

“No thank you sir” I said, but he insisted I take a pamphlet he was holding so I did, and he left. I felt like this was some sort of fucked up sign from god telling me to seek help, but at this point I was beyond saving. 

I went to sleep that night really thinking about my situation, not that it mattered much because by morning I was back to doing the same shit, eating myself. By that afternoon I had completely finished an entire leg, I was working fast! I never thought I would make it this far but another day passed and I had finished both the legs.

It was getting pretty hard to balance at this point. I was wobbling around a little, balancing on one arm. It was hard not to fall over. I figured that one day I would have to eat the arm but I was so scared I just kept nibbling on the stump where my hand used to be.

Eventually after a few months of building up the courage, I finally started biting big chunks out of my arm. One by one I would eat chunks of my arm.

When I was done eating the last of my arm I sort of just toppled over. I lay there thinking about all of my decisions for about three days until the bugs, the worms, and the rats came in to feast.

Now my body has a ton of holes, rats chewing, worms burrowing in my eye sockets, maybe ants every once in a while crawling on every part of my body, I look like a rotten apple.

I live in a constant state of limbo, suffering every day. I am always in constant pain. I always thought that I would somehow die when this is over, but like hell or purgatory I somehow managed to stay alive and keep feeling the pain. I’m starting to think that missionary was right.
