At my next appointment with the obstetrician she told me that my bloodwork came back with trace amounts of oxcarbazepine, an anti-seizure medication known to make birth control pills less effective. She scolded me for not listing it among the medications I was taking, even though I'd never knowingly taken it.

On the drive home, I thought of the architect's preoccupation with family. Of all the times that he'd asked Nick and me about having kids.

Maybe, I thought, what he'd done had less to do with voyeurism than it did with getting me pregnant.

Clearly he'd had access to the house since the moment we moved in. He could've slipped the medication into anything in the fridge. From the cameras in the old house he would've known my cycle. The lingerie on the counter was his way of forcing the issue when the timing was right.

This would've also accounted for why he vanished, why he couldn't be found. His work with us was done. A thought came to mind: the architect as some fucked-up Johnny Appleseed, planting families everywhere he went.

I shared my theory with Nick. He agreed it was plausible. Even likely.

Now, this scenario was super creepy, but somehow less so than various alternatives. Per this explanation, the architect had serious issues but his intentions weren't destructive or malicious.

Anyway, this is what I told myself as things gradually began to feel normal again, or close to it. At night our new exterior cameras would catch the occasional critter poking around. Sometimes a snake would slither past, which I wasn't too crazy about, though none were as large as that first one I'd seen. Nothing else, though -- nothing to concern us. There was still the feeling of some nearby presence that came over me from time to time, especially in quiet moments. Given what had happened I figured that feeling would never quite go away.

And the house itself, at least on the surface, belied this lurking anxiety. Sometimes I'd be walking through it when I was struck by a particular composition of lines and angles and empty spaces, of the way the light played within it, and I'd stop for a moment of appreciation.

Passing through the living room one evening I thought I caught Nick in a similar moment. He was staring across the room, looking intently into the corner. I wasn't even sure he'd noticed me until he spoke. "It isn't right," he said.

"What?"

"That."

He nodded toward the abstract sculpture I'd found at the secondhand shop. Already it had changed locations a number of times before returning to the corner where I'd originally placed it. Every time we put it somewhere, Nick said it didn't look right.

"I don't know," I said. "I think it looks fine."

In truth, though, I knew what he meant. The sculpture should've worked in the space. Like the house, it was modern, and like the house its aesthetic appealed to me, taken on its own. But something about it, no matter where it was, rung a discordant note.

"Maybe it was better in the other corner," he said.

"I can put it in my office for now. Until we figure out the right spot for it."

"Thanks. I know it shouldn't bother me."

I chalked it up to Nick wanting the place to look nice for company. We were about to have guests for the first and last time.

Since moving east, we'd established a little group of friends, mostly through Anton, Nick's old college buddy who lived near the rental house. I'd met him and his wife a few times over the years, at weddings and when they'd been out west on vacation. Now, after a year's worth of dinner parties and barbecues and nights on the town, we'd come to know and become friends with the other couples in their circle.

It was a fun group of folks with a tendency to drink and laugh until late at night. I'd become closest with a woman named Cassie. Usually easygoing, she had a no-nonsense side that I'm sure came in handy at work -- she was a corporate attorney of some kind -- and which I admired.

The new house was a bit of a hike for everyone, a good ninety minute drive, so when we extended an invitation to dinner we included an invitation to stay the night. Cassie and her husband took us up on the offer. Two other couples said they'd play it by ear. That was fine. This wasn't the sort of group that would expect pampering, should they decide to stay.

Including us, there'd be six couples at dinner. We scheduled it on the early side, for those who'd have to drive back. Nick and I hadn't told everyone about the pregnancy, yet, though I'd told Cassie and Nick had told Anton. But everybody knew about what had happened with the architect, minus some of the details. It was a big topic of conversation, once everyone arrived. After, that is, they were able to get in the house.

Soon after the appointed time, I got a call from Cassie. Three of the couples had carpooled in a pair of cars, and were standing outside, in the driveway.

"What, why?" I asked. "Come on in."

"Yeah, well..." she said, just as I threw open the front door.

On the doormat was my long, fat acquaintance from that first morning on the deck -- or another snake just like it. Lazily looped into an ampersand and showing no sign of going anywhere. I shut the door before it could decide to slither inside, and asked Nick to deal with it. He shooed it away with a broom, off into the brush, down the hill.

"Our doorman," Nick explained as everyone filtered in laughing.

The other couples soon arrived and drinks were poured, though not for me. We showed everyone around the house, and they ooh'ed and ahh'ed along the way as we'd secretly hoped they would. Maybe even overdoing it a little. "It's like a magazine," they kept saying. I noticed during the tour that several people inadvertently clipped their hips and shoulders on corners and doorknobs. So it wasn't just me.

As dinner parties always do, this one settled in the kitchen -- around the island as Nick and I put the finishing touches on dinner. The mood was slightly off. It was one of those moods where everybody seems to be putting in effort to be in a really good mood. This crowd didn't usually have to try so hard. Drinks flowed, though no more freely, it seemed, than usual; certainly not so freely as to explain what ended up happening.

I started to notice it soon after we all sat down around the dining table. A kind of slipping of my senses. Minor warping of sounds and swimminess of vision. A slight heaviness in my limbs. It felt a little like tripping on mushrooms. I looked around the table and somehow knew that it wasn't just me, that other people were experiencing the same thing. It had to do with the way that people were laughing, maybe -- slightly too manic and sustained -- or their unblinking, dilated eyes.

I hadn't had a drop to drink. And Nick and I had thrown away all the food away after finding the cameras, just to be safe -- there was no way anything was tainted. I kept waiting for someone to mention what was happening but no one did, and soon I couldn't concentrate enough on anything to wonder what was happening. The rest of that night comes back only in flashes.

I remember people on the deck, screaming into the woods.

I remember sitting beside Cassie at the otherwise abandoned dinner table, the dirty dishes stretched out in front of us, watching Nick shamble across the living room, Cassie saying, "Look, look, that's what I mean. Look at how he's moving."

I remember the music being very loud and people dancing.

And I remember, impossibly, walking past one of the open bedroom doors and seeing two of our friends -- a man and a woman who were not married to one another -- rutting like animals.

I say "impossibly" because this wasn't a wife-swapping sort of group. Sure, there was some harmless flirting, the way there often is when couples are friends and a things get loose, but that was it. Hell, even the screaming and dancing were uncharacteristic.

Fortunately when I regained full consciousness I was in my own bed. It was morning and Nick was beside me, still sleeping. I was in my underwear and shirt from last night. My jeans were beside the bed so I pulled them on and went to check on our guests.

Everyone was gone. The air mattresses we'd set up in the other bedrooms/offices had clearly been slept on, as had the couch and living room floor. There were sheets and blankets and pillows strewn everywhere.

I checked the microwave clock: a little past ten. Late but not crazy late.

It was all very strange. These were the sort of considerate friends who usually helped with dishes after dinner, who volunteered to help with big household projects, who insisted on picking up the tab. But looking around it seemed like everyone had crashed, woken up, and left in haste.

I roused Nick. "Hey," I said, when he mumbled that he was awake. "You OK?"

"Yeah. Oof. I think."

"Do you remember what happened last night?"

He didn't. Too much to drink, he said. Though he had to admit he didn't feel as hungover as he would've thought, considering his memory, at a certain point, went blank. And he conceded that it had been a long, long time since he'd had so much to drink that he blacked out. "Guess I'm getting old," he said.

"Thirty-three is not old."

I texted everybody to make sure they got home OK, and got thumbs up emojis and cursory affirmative responses and words of thanks for dinner. Then I followed up with Cassie. I knew -- we all did -- that she'd never once blacked out from drinking. She liked to claim she was impervious to it. I asked if she remembered last night.

"Bits and pieces," she texted back. "Still making sense of things. Feeling strange."

I tried to keep the thread going but after assuring me that she'd be fine she stopped replying.

\###

Nick and I resumed our routine. I don't know if it was some lingering trace of that unsettling night, but I found in the following days that when I was working I'd lose track of time. That is, I'd be heads down on some task or another when I'd zone out completely and when I snapped back I'd find to my surprise that time had passed and I'd continued working throughout. The quality of my work didn't seem to be suffering for it.

I mentioned this to Nick and he admitted that something similar was happening to him. "But it's like you said. The work I'm doing seems fine. So in a way it's like fast-forwarding through the drudgery."

"Yeah. Great. Sort of alarming, don't you think?"

"Well, it's a little weird."

"Weird like what happened when everybody came for dinner."

"Oh, I don't think it's related. It's two different things. Too much to drink, and work fatigue."

I pointed out for the thousandth time that I hadn't had anything to drink the night everyone came, but Nick seemed dismissive. I didn't get it. Not just his reasoning but why he was acting that way. He was never dismissive like that.

One evening, I was watching him prepare dinner. We rotated nights, meal prep and dishes. Tonight was my night on dishes, so while Nick got dinner together I was sitting in the living room, reading. From my spot on the couch, I could see him moving around the airy, elegant kitchen, grabbing things out of drawers or from the pantry, going between the sink and the stovetop. I was watching him and thinking about how he hadn't been acting like himself and I'm not sure if it was something in this line of thought that made me finally see it.

A quick memory of the dinner party. Cassie and I alone at the dinner table, watching Nick walk across the room. Cassie's words: "Look at how he's moving."

The same way he was moving now, with certain movements that were smooth and slow, others that were quick and vigorous, fitful, discordant movements governed by some unusual physics.

Moving, that is, just like the architect.

"What?" Nick asked me later that night as he got ready for bed.

I'd been staring at him, I guess. I couldn't help it. I'd been observing him all night, trying to convince myself I wasn't seeing what I was clearly seeing.

"Nothing," I said.

Except it wasn't nothing. Unless I was going crazy.

Needing outside validation, I texted Cassie, asked if she wanted to meet for coffee.

"Glad you asked," she texted back. "Been thinking of you, meaning to call."

We met at a coffee shop in her neck of the woods, near the rental house. Returning to the neighborhood, I was surprised to find I'd missed it. I guess a year of living there had forged more of an attachment than I'd known. Either that or I was just thirsty for civilization.

Cassie wasn't much for small-talk; it was one of the reasons I liked her. So we got right to it.

"That night was fucked," she said.

I didn't disagree. Like me, she remembered things in flashes. Her husband, like Nick -- and like everyone else who'd been there, apparently -- didn't remember anything after a certain point.

Cassie's memories were different from mine, of course. For instance, she seemed to remember someone going around opening all the doors and windows, someone else on the deck, holding a snake in their hands. I told her about the couple I saw having sex; she was surprised. "But I guess not that surprised. Not as surprised as I should be."

"Do you think we should tell them?"

Cassie gave me a look that said for god's sake no. Which was honestly what I'd kind of figured.

I asked her if she remembered sitting at the table with me. Commenting on the way Nick was moving.

"Not that moment specifically. But I do remember noticing it, when we got there. Something about the way he walked, like he had weird, broken stilts. Or the way he was with his arms and hands."

"Spasmodic."

"Yeah. That's a good way to put it," she said. "But it wasn't just Nick that seemed off. I had a bad feeling from the minute we got there. I'm sure the snake on the doorstep didn't help, but I don't think that was it. There was this... strangeness. You didn't notice?"

Maybe I had. I'm not sure why I was hesitant to admit it. "I thought maybe because we hadn't seen everybody in a while."

She shook her head. "That wasn't it. Other people felt it too. I kind of had to press the issue to get anybody to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about the visit at all, probably embarrassed for getting so blasted. But that's another thing. I don't think it was just a matter of drunkenness. I never, never get blackout drunk."

"I know."

Cassie reached across the table and took my hand. "Look, Lena," she said. "It's a beautiful house. I know you guys put a lot into it. But there's something wrong. And that whole thing with the architect. I don't what's happening, but I'm worried about you."

I thanked her and told her I was OK. And, while I appreciated her concern, there was something about the depth of it that struck me in the moment as unwarranted. Even though I'd been the one who reached out to her, in need of support. Now here she was providing it and I found myself shying away.

Before I drove back, she insisted on making a date for another coffee. "For my own peace of mind," she said.

I couldn't pretend that there was no basis for what Cassie had said. About what she'd called the strangeness. Even aside from our friends' visit and the way that Nick was acting, there persisted the feeling that would come over me from time to time, of something lurking. Sometimes when it did I found myself unconsciously holding my belly, though it hadn't yet begun to bulge.

One day I was standing in front of my bedroom closet when the feeling came, and I closed my eyes, forcing myself to focus on it, to let it in as deeply as possible, to better sense it.

It seemed to come from all sides, as if inward, from the walls. Opening my eyes, I walked around the room to see if the feeling grew stronger or weaker or otherwise changed. As I did, and neared the bedroom door, I thought I felt a slightly new sensation, not just a lurking but an unseen moving, something active. Moving toward the feeling, I went out the door and into the hall, then into Nick's office -- the future nursery -- before the feeling passed.

Aha, I thought, looking down to see my hands on my belly. It shouldn't have surprised me that there was some correlation between the phenomenon and my pregnancy. My doctor had told me to prepare for a maelstrom of new feelings as the biological and emotional reality of motherhood grew near, and had given me the number of someone to talk to about these feelings, should the need arise.

With an explanation for this occasional phenomenon, it stopped bothering me as much.

I'd put on a few pounds with the pregnancy. This being the case, you'd think I'd be bumping into things even more frequently than before, but in fact the opposite was true. I was getting ready for bed one night when it occurred to me that I hadn't bumped into anything all day. And, as I thought about it, not the day before, either, or the day before that. I'd at least adjusted to the house in that sense.

Things with Nick, too, seemed to improve. His dismissiveness about what had happened during our friends' visit remained a sore spot, but like all sore spots it was only a problem if pressed upon. As long as I didn't bring it up, things with us were fine, the way they usually were. His way of moving, too, seemed to normalize. I watched him when he didn't know I was watching and started to doubt the similarity I'd seen to the architect.

Lulled by this period of relative normalcy, I was unprepared for what happened next.

\###

I woke up and Nick wasn't in bed. This in itself wasn't unusual; sometimes he got up earlier than I did and vice versa. I went into the bathroom and splashed water on my face, then headed for the kitchen. On my way, I didn't smell coffee. Now this was unusual. By unstated agreement, whoever got up first always made a full pot. When I got to the kitchen, the coffeepot was empty, still clean.

"Nick?" I called.

I checked his office -- nothing. My office too. The hall bath, everywhere. I figured maybe he went to run an errand but his keys were still in the bowl along with mine on the table by the door. OK then, maybe he went on a walk; it looked like a nice, late September morning. That must've been it. Even though he usually left a note.

Except I went around and checked and all the bolts were engaged. The ones we'd installed after the scare with the cameras. The ones that could only be engaged from the inside.

So then where was Nick?

Nonsensically, I checked the closets and under the bed. Starting to panic, I grabbed my phone and paced the living room. My thumb hesitated over the touchscreen. Who to call? 911? And what was the nature of my emergency? I didn't know. Did it really matter? It was an emergency, wasn't it?

I'd just thumbed the 9 when there came a knock at the front door.

It startled me, and for one irrational moment I thought oh no, it's the architect. Then logic kicked it and I opened the door to see Nick on the stoop.

He was shivering in the morning chill, wearing what he always slept in, gym shorts and a t-shirt. He was barefoot.

"Nick, what the hell?" I said, hugging him. "Where were you?"

He stood there blinking. "I- I don't know. I woke up, I was just down the hill."

I corralled him into the house and poured him coffee.

He had no memory of how he got outside but contended he must've been sleepwalking, even though he'd never sleepwalked in all the time I'd known him. I told him that wasn't possible -- that all the doors were bolted. He and I went around together and verified that all the windows were locked.

"I don't know," he said. "It must've been the front door. It must not have been bolted when you opened it."

Except it had been. I was certain of it. Wasn't I?

I didn't argue. The evidence was against me. And anyway he didn't seem much worse for wear after he warmed up a bit. Even his chill wasn't too serious. "Guess I wasn't out there too long," he said.

"Nothing hurts?"

He stretched his neck, his arms, his legs, doing a kind of inventory. "A little stiff, but fine."

He went to take a hot shower. I should've been relieved, I guess. He was fine. Perhaps to convince myself that this was really true, I went to check on him in the shower.

"Oh my god," I said when I saw him.

He turned around to face me. "What?"

"Your back."

Directly in the center of his back was a pattern a few inches wide: It looked like a sun the way a kid would draw it, with swoopy rays ending in points -- seven of them. Around the sun, between the rays, were seven circles. This pattern pink upon Nick's skin, like a chemical burn.

He stepped out of the shower to look in the mirror. "Wow. We must've been even drunker than I thought."

"Who? What?"

"Well, it must be from when everybody came over, right?"

"You would've noticed it."

"I don't think so. Even knowing it's there, I can barely twist myself around to get a look at it."

"I would've noticed it."

"Are you sure?"

Was I? Surely I'd seen Nick's bare back in the two weeks or so since everyone visited. I tried to remember if I'd been in the bathroom while he was showering, or the closet while he was changing. Or if he'd walked around without a shirt at any point. Or if I'd seen him from the back during or after sex. These weren't the sorts of details you usually make a point of remembering with a timestamp. "It doesn't hurt?" I asked.

He said he didn't feel it, and seemed more focused on how, while sleeping outside, he was lucky he hadn't been bitten by a snake, given how many we'd been seeing.

That prompted me to do something I'd been meaning to do. I called a pest control company and had someone come out to make sure that the house was snake proof, sealed up nice and tight. The guy who did the inspection told us we were in the clear, that there was no way in. Of course, no way in meant no way out -- or should've. But somehow Nick had found one.

My next coffee date with Cassie came around, and I was eager to talk to her about this new mystery. She was already there and waved me down. When I sat down I looked across the table to see that she was staring at me with horror.

"What? What's the matter?" My hands instinctively going to my stomach.

"You're not messing with me? Doing it on purpose?"

"Doing what?"

"The way you walked over here, Lena. You're moving the way Nick was moving."

I could see she really believed it. And I suddenly felt like I was going insane. I broke down crying. Cassie came around to the chair beside me and gathered me in her arms. People were staring at us. I didn't care.

Here I'd thought Nick's way of moving had normalized. What must've happened, though, was that mine had begun to mirror his, to the point that I began to think it was normal.

I told Cassie everything. About what had happened with Nick waking outside. About the pattern on his back.

She had me sketch it on a napkin, which she tucked into her purse. "If you don't mind, I'd like to show this to someone," she said.

"Who?"

"My mom." She hesitated a moment before continuing: "My mom's very- I'm not sure how to put it so it doesn't sound weird. But she's very dialed in to energies and spirits and that sort of thing. If this symbol has any kind of occult significance, she'd know about it."

"At this point, I'll take whatever help I can get."

It hadn't even occurred to me that the symbol might mean something. Back home, I tried to track it down online but it was hard to know how to begin filtering through thousands of occult symbols.

Preoccupied by these efforts, I found it difficult to focus on work. It didn't help that I continued to lose track of time, zoning out for hours at a stretch whenever I sat down at my desk. Only whereas previously the work I was doing while in an unaware state seemed to be fine, this gradually ceased to be the case. I would be working on the design library for the blocks in one of the game's new building suites, for instance, zone out, and when I snapped back to reality I'd see that I'd substituted a whole new color palette, or gave the rounding of the blocks' edges a shading treatment that was all wrong.

I knew that Nick had been experiencing similar lapses of time and asked if he too had noticed a change in the work he was doing. "Yeah, I have," he said. "It's way better."

"Really? Because the stuff I'm doing seems to be totally unusable. It would never get approved for production."

"Maybe, maybe not. But it might amount to something in the long run. Here, look."

And he showed me some of the work he'd been doing by pushing code to his personal sandbox. A stripped-down version of the game's standard building interface appeared onscreen, with building tools in a tray along the side and a blank building grid in the middle of the game-space.

"I've been modifying some of the existing tools," he said, "so that you can begin building with new combinations of standard blocks. It lets you build better and faster." He began dragging block formations onto the building grid. The formations looked like panels of various sizes.

Suddenly I understood.

I ran back to my office and grabbed my laptop, took it to him.

"What am I looking at?" he said as I scrolled through the work I'd been doing while zoned out.

"Look at these color palettes and design treatments," I said. "Now imagine them applied to these block formations you've enabled."

He looked at me blankly.

I wanted to shake him. I said, "It's the fucking house. The prefab panels."

I don't know what I expected his reaction to be. Some version of what I was feeling: a sense of revulsion, of creeping dread. Because we'd been doing this work unwittingly, as if bidden by something.

Instead, though, he looked at my screen, then at his screen, then back at my screen, then back at his. He nodded slowly. "You're right," he said. Then he turned to look at me and to my horror he was smiling widely, his face fixed in an expression of sincere joy. "It is the house."
