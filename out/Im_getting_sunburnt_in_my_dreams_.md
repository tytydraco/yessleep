 

Hello,  Reddit. I'm not one for forums much, or for how to write to one, for that matter. My husband is sending me here to the experts in this sort of phenomenon. After one too many rough nights, I had a lot of suppressed memories come bubbling up to the surface of my worries, some I forgot and one's I can't.

Way back in the day a little after my seventh birthday. My parents never wanted my brother and I to be glued to the tv set on a cooling summer's evening. It was a nice night out because the air didn't reek of cow waste and almonds, for once. When it's all you're surrounded by you'd think you would go noseblind to it. It only takes one breeze to remind you of it's presence.

My Dad's the kind of guy who would never skip out on the opportunity to man the grill on a warm night with a cold beer in hand. I loved standing close and watching him work. The heat radiating off of the coals would warm my face while a gentle wind's hand would give its cooling touch. I miss nights like this a lot. I used to like to stare down into the glowing red coals. Seeing all of the light and colors emanate out of them, I would quickly look up to the sky to let the coal's lingering impression on my retinas make the stars dance.

A few seconds later my vision would fade back to normal. My eyes were now focused directly above me. A handful of stars were all glowing so much brighter than the others. I rubbed my eyes, but they were still there shining high. I peppered my dad with questions. I was an annoying kid.

"*Sometimes they just do that champ. Stars are big burnin' balls of fire, and it looks like god's got the gas cranked up on high tonight."* He belched out, not taking his eyes off his chicken legs.

Being seven I took his word as gospel and left it at that. The rest of the night was normal. Dinner, clean up family time, prayer, and then off to bed. My mom always handled the tucking us in bed duties. Dad had to wake up extra early to get started out on the ranch. I always rolled over after my mom shut my door, I liked to watch the the drooping willow branches outside my window move with the wind. It blocked a little more than two-thirds of what I could see out of the window so I had to learn to like it, whether I wanted to or not.

Every window screen in the house was now equipped with extra tough window screens that only dimmed the view from the outside a little. There are a lot of stray cats on the property, who are for the most part harmless. Sometimes though they used to rip right through the screens and piss and trash around the house. Not wanting to harm even god's 'peskiest of critters, Mom and Dad opted to install the extra thick and strong screens.

From my bed, I could see out my little clearing of window to the distant sky. I could still see them. Six stars in the paired and bright shining loud enough that all other stars in the sky were muted in their grace. They made me nervous. Remembering my dad's wisdom I pulled up my covers and rolled over to fall into sleep.

I've never been a very vivid dreamer. Sometimes I could remember a short flash of something or if I was very blessed that night I'd get a whole second or two I could recall for about half the day. Some of my worst nightmares never made it in my mind past lunchtime.

I drifted off to sleep pretty quickly, always do. Flashes of dreams started sinking in the closer to sleep I fell. My breathing slowed and my body kept falling further. I fell from the deep black of sleep into the brightest white  I had ever seen. It was cold and clinical. I knew I was in a horrid place. I couldn't move. I couldn't blink. I could see his silhouettes around me. The dentist and his brothers. I could only look straight above me into the glowing indifferent ball of light. it scorched its name into the back of my eyes. I wanted to look away, I wanted to cry, a helpless little part of me knew I was going to go blind. I could feel his awful rubbery gloved finger probe along my gums.

I woke up like I did on any normal morning. With my Dad knocking on my door to start getting up, and with my automatic request for just a few more minutes. I didn't get them. Once my brain kicked on the panic thoughts came flooding into my tired head.

*"OH CRAP I'M GONNA BE BLIND. I"M GONNA HAVE TO GET A DOG AND A CANE. LORD JESUS PLEASE DON'T TAKE MY SIGHT"*

When I opened my now tear-filling eyes I could see the dark of my room. The faint whispers of dawnlight were beginning to peak in through the window. to say I was relieved was an understatement. I was spared. For a all of forty seconds. I tossed my covers aside and got out of bed.The moment my feet greeted the rug I felt yucky and wrong. I was zapped with such a vengeful wave of nausea that I thought my organs were to explode out of my mouth.

I burst out of my room straight for the toilet. If the bathroom wasn't directly across the hall from my door I would have painted the floorboards with the mostly digested remnants of last night's barbecue. After puking out half my body weight and flushing a couple of times I didn't feel much better, only emptier. I went to rinse my mouth, instead of brushing. A choice that only led me back to that chair faster than I would realize.

*"Mill!? Millie hun' are you okay?"* Mom was racing up the stairs, half the world must have heard me vomit.

*"I don't feel so gr--"* Was as far as I got.

I locked eyes with the crimson child in the mirror across me. My hand was still hanging on the mirror's handle. My arm was bright red and I could feel the warmth radiating from it. I felt like a lizard that passed out under the heat lamp. My face was a dry, peeling mask of dead skin. I could see tiny pieces flake from my trembling cracked lips. A scream rose from my throat faster than the vomit. My mom's confused scream quickly tagged along with it.

*"Millie, what on earth did you do. .?"*

*"Momma it hurts. I don't I don't I don't-"* I was as scared and lost as she was.

She scooped me up and ran down the stairs. I got slathered in aloe vera and tossed in the truck with a sleeve of saltines to nibble on, on the drive out to our doctor. My shirt burned all over my sore body, The slightly too tight seat belts made it hurt and itch with every bump on the road. My mom started looking as pukey as I felt. We made the drive in half the time.

I don't know what exactly she told the Doctor, or much of how she responded. Only that this much damage couldn't have happened overnight or it's a severe allergic reaction. She gave us two things, a prescription for some medicated lotion, and a skeptical look while telling us to call back if it ever happens again. The burns healed and time kept passing, we mostly forgot and moved on.

A good few years had come and passed since my first bright dream. We still lived on the same piece of property together, well for the most part. My Brother, six years my senior. had just moved out into his first place after a lot of looking and whole heck of a lot of saving. I helped him load the last of his junk into the back of now **his** truck.

*"You think you're gonna miss this place much?"* I asked him, just trying to start some silence ending chitchat.

*"Am I gonna miss what? The house? you mean fuckin' home?  You know it. You can't not miss where you grow up."*  It was the early 00s and his vocabulary was as of the time as his fashion sense.

*"It's gonna suck trying to feed myself, but you know what ain't gonna suck? No more pushing jersey shit on my d*ays off. *No more hearing your sleep farts through the wall, and finally. Finally not being frosted with frigging cat hair on all my clothes.*

*"Heh, that'll be something I bet. You know I think I'm miss this baby more than I'll miss you, if I do even. I always hoped I'd get to learn how to drive in her."* I heaved the tailgate while I talked trying not to let show how much I was actually going to miss having my big brother around.

*"Hell Mill, never say never yet. Maybe next year I'll Swing by and we can start leaning you something. Hop in real quick, I wanna give you something."*

*"On it."* I said already reaching for the passenger side handle.

I got excited. Dale rarely gifted me anything, but when he did it was always something awesome. Last time it was a super cool lighter that looked like a stack of dice, time before that It was two little illegalish fireworks he's says he got from his 'friend' in Nevada. I used one with some friends to turn a jack o'lantern to atoms. I'm holding onto the second for something special.

*"In my here hoodie pocket I have something for you that is very special to me. Now I was a teen myself once. I did some dumb and I did some fun things. This beauties a little bit of both I was a little older than you but close enough when I got this tizzight piece.* He pulled a gross little yellow stained ziplock baggie from out of his pocket.

He had stars in his eyes, I had a little disappointed curiosity in mine.

*"What is it, I don't think I want to touch that."*

*"Lemme give you a quick whiff first you'll love it."* He spread the bag's flaps open and the whole cab filled with a thick horrible stink. He pointed the baggie at my face and I saw what it held.

I pinched my nose tight to look closer. Inside was a smaller even more disgusting baggie that contained a small black silicone smoking pipe. At one point it looked like a black owl with big yellow eyes. Now It looks like a partially melted Halloween reject covered in burns and rosin from smokes long passed. It was revolting and I was thrilled.

*"Gosh Dale, I don't what to say. Thank you though. Hey this ain't going to make me as dumb as you, is it?"*

*"Hell, prolly will. Stay in school bud, go to college."* He took a huge deep breath in and dropped his hand on my head.

*"If you squeal to mom or dad, or they find out in any way that I gave this to you. You are capital D Done-Zo. Comprende?"* He winked and tossled my hair a little too rough.

*"I copy dude."* I sealed the baggies and stashed it away in my jacket.

We went inside to have one of our last dinner's as the whole family unit for a little while. In my room I could still smell the bag a little so I flipped the fan in my window around to try and air out the room a little before the smell could latch onto anything in my room. I switched out the bags and made the genius decision to take it to school with me the next day. We didn't have a lot of money at the time and getting a teenage girl a nokia wasn't real high on the expense list.

Communication had to be in person. I was paranoid about getting caught to boot. During passing period I pulled my best friend into a stall with me to show her and we formulated a plan for later that night. Sneaking out at nine pm on a Thursday wouldn't be too difficult. My parents went to bed early and were some of the hardest sleepers on god's green earth. Her Father never really noticed when she was coming and going. He worked a lot.

Serena drove out to the ranch with her own small smelly baggie. She managed to sweet talk it off a senior at school who was constantly bugging her to hang out with him. It got old fast. I waited for her on the porch steps, A cat I had taken to calling Mercy saddled up to me for a few pets. She was pregnant and wanted a little comfort and warmth I gave the little bald spot on her side a good pet to warm it up. I was happy to oblige. She  pulled up twenty or so minutes later, we went straight to my room.

Just below my window overhanging the back porch was an old, but sturdy metal awning. I had been sitting on it for years as my little quiet spot. I had made a cut along the bottom and side of the screen for a way in and out. I had to replace the duct tape after every couple of times, but it held up well enough. Except for a time or two that Mercy or another furry vagrant got through and sprayed all over like everything I own.

We grabbed the comforter off of the bed to wrap around us. Took down the fan and climbed out the window. We sat there, only a little nervous but super excited. The air felt electric that night. She offered a smell from her baggie and I was a little hesitant, but not enough to say no. It did smell better. Still like the business end of an angry skunk, but better than where we were about to put it.

We got started with the little knowledge we had. A few snacks, a comfy blanket and a gorgeous starry sky above. I went first. I followed the instructions she gave me. With my lucky roller lighter inhand I brought it to my face.

Load, LIght, and Inhale.

Imemdiatly I was convulsing in a a coughing fit so violent I began drooling. I dropped the pipe and the ember burned a small through my shirt and burned my stomach a tiny bit. My throat scratched and burning, the coughing finally petered and I got my breath. Serena couldn't stop laughing. Guess I looked really funny to her. When my brain finally got oxygen again I realized I was laughing too. I picked up everything real slow and passed it over.

I felt numb and my head was spinny. I leaned back a little further to look up at the shimmering night sky. My eyes locked on the moon. She was a beautiful crescent, but not shining as bright as she usually was. It made me hungry for some reason. I was starving and reached down for the goldfish. I looked back up to the moon, she didn't look right and it bothered me. I scanned the sky for less than a second before my eyes locked on two gloriously bright stars. They were like the northstars older brother in how loud and aggressive they shone. They were polluting the sky and dimming her light. It made me nervous.

I grew so cold. It felt like they were seeing me. My heart started beating faster again as four more stars began to grow in brightness behind them. My stomach churned and I felt sick.

I was swiftly yanked out my internalized panic by my friend's aggressive and dry coughing spasm. Her watering eyes cause me to feel a little sorry for her and I patted her back a little too hard, causing the comforter to fall of our shoulders. We locked reddening eyes and could only giggle. I convinced my self I was just seeing things from the pot and forgot about it.

I don't remember what time we went back inside, or when Serena left. I do remember putting the fan back and being so hungry and tired. I wanted to go downstairs for more snacks but my sleepiness and laziness were both louder than the groaning in my stomach. I flopped onto bed and waited for the loving arms of sleep to whisk me off. Quiet, and so damn comfortable I laid there and felt it felt it drifting in. The world faded into black and fell into dreams.

I was walking down a sidewalk. The neighborhood was too dark tell if I recognized it. Not a single house had their lights on. Not even the street lights were on. I couldn't see a  little ways ahead one end of the street curved upwards bringing the houses with it. the other end stretched in the black of night. scared and alone I started walking towards the curve. I didn't getting very far. The hairs on the back of neck stood high when I started picking up a soft buzzing in my ears. It grew in volume for a short moment before the streetlamp above my head flashed to life.

For second I could make out all the houses around. They were all MY house. I couldn't protect my eyes. They locked onto the oppressive white ball that bathed my whole body and the darkness around in it's umbra. My eye's were now entered into a staring contest with this brilliant glow that I didn't plan on winning. I wanted to look away, but I don't think my body could. The world around me vanished and I felt weghtless, like I was being pulled from the surface of dreams below me. The light starting gaining more illumination than it already contained. It was slowly getting closer, not brighter. I was being lifted towards the ball of light.

Then it blinked at me.

My ears were hurt by a yowl of pain and hurt so great that I thought judgement day had come riding in on the throats of every animal on the land. The world went black and I shot out of bed a less than a second after. My face was greeted by the semi plush carpet, my legs hand't gotten the notice to wake up quite just yet. In a sweaty panicked scan I surveyed the room. It was quiet. Surely the whole house had heard what I had. I thought, but the only sounds I could hear were my own labored breath and the whirring of the fan.

The fan wasn't in it's spot but I could still hear it from the window. My wide open window. The screen was in shredded ribbons. I stuck my head and was caught off guard with a putrid wind blown directly up my nostrils. The fan was hanging horizontally blowing straight up . the chord was pulled taught and keeping the fan perpendicular to the wall.  I grabbed the handle and plugged it. To this day I still wish I hadn't jesus christ.

I dropped. No i Tossed the fan aside, as a scream starting rise up my throat, the bile came up faster though and choked out the shriek before it could escape. Underneath was Mercy. Oh god. The patch of missing fur was the only way I could tell. Her face was gone, and half of her intestines were laying out like wet mostly deflated balloons.

*"Where'd.? what happened to the kittens..?"* The the thought didn't last long.

The noise from the fan finally died out, and was replaced by the soft, wet gurgling that was leaking out a red froth from the Perfectly triangular hole that used to be her face.

I'm still ashamed that I threw up onto her. I didn't go back to sleep. I Buried her out back in a shoe box and rocked myself in bed until sunrise. My mom knocked on my door not long after to wake up. I didn't change my clothes much. I walked out in an itchy tired haze. I got in the car and waited for mom. Trying to convince myself that I just had a long fucked up nightmare. The dirt under my fingernails, and burn in my muscles told me otherwise.

*"You already baby?, Don't wanna forget  noth-"* She cut herself off, pinching her nose and shutting her eyes before she even sat in the car.

*"Oh my god I probably stink from last night. I am so screwed."*  I thought quick, a new type of fear coming in.

*"MIll you got inside and change right now. You reek of catpiss! Lord, it's makin' my eyes sting."* She said turning her head to look at me.

*"Catpee?"*  I thought. I didn't smell anything but I had an out.

*"I think mercy got in my room again"* I said weakly. Trying to suppress the image in my head.

I unbuckled, but my mom through the car in reverse and started gunning down the drive path. Her eyes were wide and she had her shirt pulled up around her nose.

*"What're you doing I was gonna change?"*

*"We are going to the doctor Millie. Did you not see your G.D. face?*  She was real aggressive with her concern.

*"Im okay, I'm just tired! Nothing is wrong."* I felt okay, maybe a little queasy and stressed, but okay.

*"You're not tired you're beet red. It happened again Mill.* She turned the rear view at me and tried not to gag.

My eyes met and I saw peeling, pinking, and puffy skin. The longer I stared, the more I could feel it itch. I didn't want to scratch and cause a rainfall of dead skin. Mom threw up in her shirt a little. After a truckload of tests and an ointment prescription later, they sent us home with less answers and a lot less money than we had going in. Mom stayed sick for a long time after that.

A week later we got a call back. I now know that I didn't have an allergic reaction, I'm more prone to skin cancer and need to wear extra spf sunscreen outside. Everyday, and that I had concentrated levels of thc in my system. I thanked god that mom didn't pick up the phone. I went upstairs to slather up in menthol and corticosteroid goodness. It tingled and stank but the relief was worth the fumes. I had blisters almost everywhere, they stung and leaked for a week. One made it's home on my collarbone that was the size of a pea, and just as round.

The sack was full and stretched tight. I know you're not supposed to pop them, but this fella was bugging me enough when just shirt brushed it. I was left with no choice. Safety pin in hand I leaned into the mirror and gently pinched it in place. This gave me a soft shudder of hurt. It felt hot and greasy on my fingertips. I brought the pin up to it, and started having second thoughts. I was hesitant, the pin was electrified in my fingers. They tingled and couldn't go the final millimeter, even though I knew I was putting force into it.

I could feel my heart pounding in the blister. I was struck through with a lightning bolt of white-hot pain the instant pin touched sack. I yelped and couldn't move. A chorus of pain held my body paralyzed. The pain was a deep hot needle I could feel straight through to my back. The tip of the pin didn't puncture skin. It started pulsating in my fingers. Faster than my heartbeat. I managed to brace myself against the counter. It throbbed a sharp new hell when I caught my weight.

My ears were ringing as the veins on my temples threatened o rupture. I couldn't move, Every breath was a grunting stab. My eyes locked on it in the mirror. It was nearly double in size as it burst open with disgusting damp pop. I shouted and started getting dizzy. It oozed clear runny fluid down my chest. It glistened in the bathroom lights as it dripped onto the counter.

It Stopped weeping, and for a beautiful moment, it didn't hurt. Maybe that was just shock setting in. A staggeringly new pulse of pain and confusion struck me. There was a tiny hole in its center. My eyes fixed on it. An uneasy droplet of blood shot from it before a small shiny silver ball birthed itself out. It tinked into the sink and down the drain. I passed out when my dad started pounding on the door.

Years passed and a lot in life changed. I was now in my third year of college. For veterinary science and medicine, go figure. I was doing a couple of semesters out of state. My brother had talked me into taking the opportunity. As homesick as I was I had made friends and even started dating.I'm thankful I wasn't far from home, and alone. The trees were leafless at the end of November, right before the cold started gaining legs and  I was blessed with a week free from classes for the holiday. 

This road trip was an important one. My mom had been battling a lengthy stretch of leukemia, and after many rounds of chemo she was in well enough health to celebrate her very favorite holiday, Thanksgiving. My brother moved back home when Mom got really sick. Dale would care for her when he knew Dad needed a rest, even though he would never admit it. He never left her side and made life for her as comfortable as the lord would allow him to. 

I was nervous about this trip for another reason. It would be the first time any of my family gets to meet my girlfriend at the time Dani. They had already heard everything about her well before we began to date, but meeting people in person can always be different y'know? We met studying at the same starbucks. She thought my headphones were cute, and I liked her laptop stickers. We started studying next to each other and became friends. To best friends, to girlfriend and girlfriend. Things were going really well. 

Three quarters through our trip we stopped at a gas station in Nevada to take a leak and fuel up We were only a little behind but still making good time. While looking around the sparse rows of junk food and soda I saw the turnstile of name keychains. I started flipping through the D section like a mad woman while Dani was in the restroom. After too many Davids, and  Daren's and even a couple Dales, I found it. 

"DANIELLE"

She always disliked her full name and we had that in common. It was one of the first things we bonded over. I was willing to waste a couple bucks on some light teasing. I walked out after paying to start filling the car. Keychain in hand, A bag of fritos, two redbulls in the other, and seventy-five on pump six. I finished filling the tank up, but Dani was still inside. The last drive through must have really hit her hard. She usually doesn't take this long. Even after a greaseball lunch. 

A few minutes pass and I saw her walk out of the gas station clasping her hands together with the biggest goofiest grin I ever saw on her face. THe closer she got to the car the more I could hear her giggle. The way her muffled chuckles whistled through her chipped front tooth was one of my favorite sounds. 

"*I found you a little something inside."*  She let out composing herself a touch. 

Before I could say 

"I got somethin' for you too cutie" 

She cleared her throat and unwove her fingers from each other to reveal an adorable Little green man keychain, well it would have been adorable. If it weren't for the big ugly letters ground into it's surface. 

"MILDRED" 

"*For my liittle ol' lady. Cause I think* yo*u're outta this world!"*  She giggled out and kissed me on the forehead.

My jaw hung half open in a grin, I was definitely surprised but in a warm happy way. I reached in my pocket and pulled her surprise. 

"*I'm glad we're on the same page Danielle."*  I snickered presenting the keychain I got for her like I just snagged a huge fish. 

 "*Oh you are such a bitch. I love you."*  She said playfully punching my arm. 

*"I love you too asshole*"  We kissed and started out on the last leg of our road trip

We crossed state lines after several traffic jams had slowed us down considerably. There was still ten hours left in our drive and both of us were falling too tired to keep going. After a couple of swerves on the rumble strips and a few more exits we chose to pool our remaining cash and get a room for the night. We would still make it tomorrow and a day early. We just need a little rest to get there. We got lucky and found ourselves at the 

‘Cozy Corner Comfort Lodge’

We were exhausted and it was cheap. It was perfect.  Dani checked us in and I opted to stay outside and get some blood back into my legs. The cricket song, accompanied by the cool late night breeze made it real difficult to keep my eyes open. Even in the midst of stretching. The starry sky above was a nauseating beauty. It made the hairs on my neck stand high, but I still liked stare out. It was like the ocean to me. Big deep and frightening.  



*"So the guy behind the counter is one hundred percent on something, he is big tweaking in there. I scored us a room though."  She had said with the barest hint of concern on her tongue.* 

Half awake I kinda just stared and nodded in response. We found our room and shambled into the stale smelling but clean enough looking room. I tripped trying to get my shoes off and Dani helped me into one of the two queen-sized beds. It was over for me the moment my head touched pillow. I hardly felt her climb in behind me as I began falling off the cliff into sleep. 

I was cold and walking through sparse woods alone. I could hear the noises of animals crunching through the flora around me. My breath was visible but the condensation never dissipated and left a trail behind me. I was being guided by the shining light of two full moons above me. Where I was being led was a secret only they knew. I walked barefoot through my numb feet trodding through muddy leaf covered ground, but my feet always came away from the surface clean. 

There was a break in the trees and my foot came touched down on warm dusty asphalt. It hurt the bottom of my feet but was nicer compared to sharp cold wet mud. I found myself on a long stretch of highway, with trees lining both sides. My legs began walking on their own now, down the road towards the two voyeuristic moons ahead. They walked for hours and I never grew any closer. The forest on either side of me never changed. Like I was walking on rough painful treadmil. Except I was no longer walking. My legs were stiff and dangled above the yellow lines below. I was still moving forward. 

I felt the hairs on my neck raise as fear struck my every sense. Further down the road I saw a pair of headlights coming fast towards. I tried to scream and thrash but I couldn't move a single part of my body. I was trapped paralyzed like a deer. The headlights. weren't speeding towards me. I was drifting to them. They grew warmer the closer I got. Suddenly I felt the same heat beaming down from behind me. I couldn't turn back I knew it was another pair of lights. I could see two shadows on the asphalt eminate from my body as I was lit up from behind. 

I tried to scream. I tried to cry. I couldn't even move my eyes. The light grew warmer and warmer as I got closer. Two more pairs of lights flicked on to life from between the trees. They kept pace with my floating form. Ther light cut through the trees, never breaking from my body. The intense searing white was quickly becoming all I could see. I slammed my eyes shut as best I could but It did little help. I could turn my head the closer I got and felt my heart ruptured when next to me I saw Dani. Drifting towards the same fate I was. There was tears streaming down her paralyzed face. 

Everything went black like the flip of a light switch. I woke up hard and I woke up fast. LIke I was dropped into bed from the ceiling. I arose feeling nauseous and shitty. I tried to rub the sleep from my eyes and felt my face, tight and hot. This time I instantly knew what I was feeling. I sprinted to the bathroom mirror. I saw my red face and shoulders, shiny and peeling. It hurt. I could see the beds behind me in the mirror. Dani wasn't in either of them.

My confusion pivoted to panic. She wasn’t in the room. She wasn’t in the fucking room. I searched and scrambled outside. I threw up. I cried.  She wouldn’t just leave me. She wouldn’t. The car was still parked outside. Her keys and wallet were still in the locked room. Even her shoes were still there She was gone. 

I threw up and cried throughout the entire questioning process with the police. The officers who took my statements were getting sick and nauseous as the hours went on. Some of them were gagging.  They questioned all two of the employees that worked the motel that night. Neither of them was taken serious. I don't know what they said. I only heard that all the electronics went out at the same moment and that one of them was passed out at the time.

She was filed as missing and they brushed their hands off the situation. I guess they have a lot of missing persons reports this time of year, and are 

*"Going to do everything within our power to find your friend."*

They pinned her picture onto a giant board that hung on the wall. She was surrounded by hundreds, of other missing men, women and children. My vision zoomed out, and her face became a drop in an ocean of faces. All of them had vanished without a trace. Never to be seen again.

My Dad drove down the last few hours we had to make to escort me home. Dale stayed home with Mom and the family. The drive back in Dad's truck was long and silent. I didn't have any words only sadness and worry. My Dad did his best to comfort me. We made it back to the ranch a day late.
