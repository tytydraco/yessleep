I’ve always loved the outdoors. There’s something about the stillness out here, the way the water mirrors the sky, how the mangroves twist like ancient guardians over the narrow channels. Out here, away from the noise and rush of civilization, you can feel the world breathe. Every cast of my line, every dip of my paddle – it’s my way of syncing up with that rhythm. Been that way since I was a kid.

Back then, I didn’t care much for the regulations. Couldn’t stand hearing about invasive species and quotas. Didn’t see the harm. Hell, the more the merrier, right? All those exotic fish and reptiles turning up out of nowhere – they made things more interesting. I remember the first time I hooked a snakehead, how it thrashed like the devil himself was on the other end of the line. I laughed that day, felt a rush like nothing else. They said those things were dangerous, that they didn’t belong. But out here, everything felt like it belonged. At least, that’s what I thought.

I’ve changed my mind about all that. Funny how an experience can do that to you. These days, when I hear talk about regulations and culls, I just nod. I get it now. I’ve seen what happens when things that don’t belong out here take root. I’ve seen what they can turn into.

I used to think the Everglades were timeless, unchanging. But they’re not. Not anymore.

Not since that day.

I’ll tell you about it, but you gotta promise me something first: if you’re ever out there, in the backwaters where the sun struggles to reach, and the mangroves close in tight... If you hear something rumbling just beneath the surface, something big, too big... Don’t go looking. Don’t be curious. Just paddle away. slowly.

Because some things out here... they ain’t natural. Not anymore.

Keith and I had been planning the trip for weeks. We checked the weather religiously, crossed days off our calendars, and even bailed on poker night just to make sure nothing would screw it up. It was supposed to be perfect – and it was. Not a cloud in the sky, sun warm enough to feel like a blessing but not enough to cook us alive. We had the kayaks strapped tight in the back of my pickup, rods and tackle boxes piled up beside them, and a cooler full of beer nestled under some old towels to keep them cold.

We were halfway down that long stretch of highway cutting through the Glades, radio crackling out some old country tune, when Keith turned to me with that stupid grin of his. “You heard about those herpes monkeys?”

I almost spat out my coffee. “What the hell are you talking about?”

He leaned back, putting his feet up on the dashboard like he owned the damn truck. “They got these monkeys running loose down here. Real nasty suckers. Some tourist attraction brought ‘em in years back, but they busted out. Now they’re all over, carrying herpes or some crap.”

I gave him a sideways glance, trying to figure out if he was pulling my leg. But he looked dead serious, his sunburned nose wrinkling up as he laughed.

“You’re full of it,” I muttered, but he just shook his head.

“Nah, man. Swear to God. Look it up. They’ll bite your face off and give you herpes. Can you imagine? Explaining that to your old lady?” He puffed out his chest, putting on his best tough-guy voice, “Well, honey, it wasn’t no barmaid, it was a monkey. Honest!”

I laughed, the truck swerving a little as I wiped a tear from my eye. “You’re an idiot.”

But then Keith leaned in, his voice dropping. “Alright, serious question. Would you rather get bit by one of those herpes monkeys or a gator?”

I took a moment to consider. “Gator. No contest.”

He looked at me like I was nuts. “You’d rather get your leg chomped off than catch monkey herpes?”

“A gator’s just doing what it does. Ain’t personal. But a herpes monkey? That’s just... wrong.”

We both busted up laughing, the kind of deep belly laughs that hurt your ribs and leave you gasping for air. Keith slapped the dashboard, and for a second, everything felt perfect. Just two buddies, the open road, and the promise of a good day out in nature’s bosom.

We had no idea what was waiting for us out there.

If we did, we would’ve turned that truck around and never looked back.

Keith kept the questions coming as the miles passed, each one more ridiculous than the last. “Alright, last one,” he said, wiping tears from his eyes. “Would you rather have a Burmese python slither up your shorts or one of those monkeys bite you on the—”

“Jesus, Keith!” I shouted, barely able to keep the truck straight through my laughter. “You got some sick ideas, man. Remind me why I hang out with you?”

“Because no one else puts up with your ugly mug,” he shot back, grinning ear to ear.

We turned off the highway and followed a dirt road through the sawgrass and cypress trees, the world getting quieter, wilder, with each mile. Finally, we pulled up to our spot—a spring that fed into the Everglades, hidden enough to keep the tourists away but not so remote that it took a miracle to get to.

It was gorgeous. Sunlight filtered through the twisted arms of mangroves, dappling the water with patches of gold. The water itself was impossibly clear, a sheet of glass reflecting the endless blue sky. Tiny fish darted in the shallows, shimmering like flecks of silver, and somewhere above, a heron cut lazy circles against the sun. There was a stillness to the place, an ancient peace that made you feel like you’d stumbled into a slice of untouched paradise.

We unloaded the kayaks, the hulls scraping softly against the sandy bank as we slid them into the water. I took a deep breath, letting the smell of salt and earth and wildness fill my lungs. It was good to be out here. Away from everything.

Keith gave his kayak a shove and hopped in, the water barely rippling as he settled into his seat. He turned back to me, a wicked grin spreading across his face. “You know, all this talk about rising water levels... If climate change was real, this place would be underwater, right?” He waggled his eyebrows, trying to get a rise out of me.

I rolled my eyes, shoving off and letting my kayak glide next to his. “Don’t be one of those guys.” “It already gets hot as hell out here in the summer. If it gets one degree hotter, I’m kicking your ass,”.  
He leaned away, cackling, his laughter echoing off the trees.

We started paddling out, the water so clear I could see the dark, winding roots of the mangroves below, twisting like knotted fingers. Dragonflies danced above the surface, their wings flashing in the sunlight. A soft breeze rustled through the leaves, carrying with it the distant call of an osprey.

We were heading deeper in, following the winding waterways where the sun barely touched and the mangroves grew thick and close. Out here, the world felt endless, wild, untouched by time.

We spent the next few hours just drifting, casting our lines and letting the world fall away. Out here, time didn’t mean much. The sun moved slow, and the water carried us wherever it pleased. Every now and then, the silence was broken by the splash of a fish or the call of some unseen bird echoing through the mangroves.

I’d reeled in a couple of fat catfish, the stubborn suckers putting up a decent fight before giving in. Keith, though, was on fire. He was whooping and hollering, his kayak rocking as he wrestled with something big. When he finally pulled it up, I couldn’t believe my eyes.

A young arapaima, its scales shimmering a deep red and gold in the sunlight.

“Would you look at that!” Keith crowed, holding the thing up like it was a trophy. “You ever seen one out here before?”

I shook my head, too stunned to say much. “No way. Not out here.”

He grinned, teeth flashing. “Guess they’re spreading faster than we thought. Damn good fight, too. You jealous?”

I rolled my eyes. “Of course you’d catch the freak fish. Probably rigged your bait with gold dust or something.”

“Or maybe,” he shot back, “I’m just better than you.”

We went back and forth like that for a while, our kayaks bobbing in the gentle current, laughter mixing with the soft rustle of the leaves. Keith kept the arapaima dangling off the side of his kayak, its gills flaring slowly as it recovered from the fight. He said he wanted to get a picture before he let it go.

That was when I saw it.

A dark shape, long and thick, gliding through the water about thirty yards out. Its head broke the surface, two eyes like polished stones staring right at us. Big gator, at least twelve feet, moving lazy and slow. It watched us for a moment, then sank back down, a trail of ripples the only sign it was ever there.

I grinned, turning to Keith. “Hey, hotshot. Why don’t you wiggle your fingers and see if it’ll come over? We can give it that ugly fish of yours as a present.”

Keith’s face lit up with that wild, reckless gleam I knew too well. “You serious?”

“Hell yeah. What, you scared?”

He flipped me off, then leaned over the side, waving his fingers just above the surface, calling out in a high-pitched, mocking voice, “Here, gator gator gator...”

We both busted up laughing, the sound carrying over the water. The gator didn’t take the bait, though. Just kept on drifting, moving slow and steady, vanishing around a bend in the mangroves.

Keith sat back, wiping a tear from his eye. “See? Even the gators know you’re full of crap.”

I shook my head, chuckling. “Or they just don’t like herpes.”

Keith snorted, giving me the finger again before finally unhooking the arapaima and holding it up, the fish glinting in the sun. “Think it’ll come back if I throw this?”

I shrugged. “Only one way to find out.”

He hesitated, his eyes lingering on the bend where the gator had disappeared. For a second, I thought he’d chicken out. But then his jaw tightened, and with a grunt, he hurled the fish through the air. It hit the water with a splash, its body flailing for a moment before it tried to swim off. But it didn’t get far.

The water surged, a powerful wave rolling toward the struggling fish. Then, with a burst of speed that didn’t seem natural for something so big, the gator lunged. Its jaws snapped shut around the arapaima, the sound like a gunshot echoing across the water.

“Holy hell!” Keith shouted, nearly tipping his kayak as he jerked back in surprise.

I couldn’t help but laugh, my heart pounding in my chest. “You wanted to see it up close, didn’t you?”

The gator barely made a ripple as it glided away, the fish thrashing once more before going limp in its jaws. It was huge, every bit of twelve feet, maybe more, its body sleek and powerful, armored scales glistening in the sunlight. It moved with purpose, a cold intelligence behind those ancient eyes.

Keith let out a low whistle. “Damn. Look at that thing. It’s a dinosaur, man. A freakin’ dinosaur.”

“Yeah,” I agreed, watching as it disappeared around the bend, leaving only a trail of bubbles behind. “Makes you wonder what else is out here.”

Just as the big gator started to come back into view on the other side of the bend, the water trembled. At first, it was just a ripple, barely noticeable, like the surface was shivering. But then it grew, spreading out in wide circles, and a deep, resonant sound echoed through the mangroves.

It was low, so low I felt it more than heard it—a rumble that vibrated in my chest, rolling through the water and air like distant thunder. It reminded me of the mating calls I’d heard from bull gators before, that deep bellow they use to stake out territory and call to mates. But this... this was different. It was louder, deeper, almost... hollow.

The gator froze, its massive body going rigid. Its head snapped in the direction of the sound, eyes narrowing, muscles coiling tight. For a moment, it just floated there, perfectly still, its nostrils flaring as if tasting the air. Then, without warning, it whipped around, its tail churning the water as it took off in the opposite direction, faster than I’d ever seen a gator move.

Keith and I watched, slack-jawed, as the creature’s armored back disappeared around a bend, the water still rippling from its panicked escape.

Keith was the first to speak. “Did... did that thing just get scared?”

I swallowed hard, my mouth suddenly dry. “I think so.”

He looked at me, eyes wide. “What the hell spooks a twelve-foot gator?”

I didn’t have an answer. My gaze drifted back to the spot where the ripples were fading, to the dense wall of mangroves and the dark water that flowed between them. Everything had gone deathly quiet. No birds, no insects, not even the whisper of wind through the leaves. Just... silence.

Keith tried to laugh, but it came out shaky. “Maybe it was another gator. A bigger one, right?”

I wanted to believe that. Wanted to believe that there was a logical explanation. But the way that gator had bolted, the sheer panic in its movements... it was like it’d seen a ghost.

“Yeah,” I said, more to convince myself than him. “Must’ve been a bigger one. Or maybe it’s mating season and he didn’t want to fight.”

Keith nodded, but his eyes didn’t leave the water. “Yeah... yeah, that makes sense.” He let out a breath, his shoulders relaxing just a little. “Probably just a big bull. I mean, we’ve seen some monsters out here before, right?”

“Right.” I forced a grin. “Big ugly bastards. Mean as hell, too.”

Keith chuckled, the sound too loud, too forced. “Yeah. Maybe if we’re lucky, we’ll catch a glimpse of it. Get a real story to tell.”

I didn’t say anything to that. I just tightened my grip on my paddle and started moving, my eyes flicking to the shadows beneath the trees, to the dark water that was far too still.

I told myself it was just another gator, just another day in the Glades.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something had changed.

And whatever else was lurking in these waters... it was big enough to scare off a monster.

After a while, the tension eased, the strange ripple and the fleeing gator becoming just another weird story to laugh about later. We drifted along with the slow current, letting the sun soak into our skin, the gentle rocking of the kayaks almost lulling me to sleep.

Keith cracked open a cold one, the can hissing as the carbonation escaped. He took a long gulp, letting out a satisfied “Ahh,” before handing me one from the cooler. “Figure we earned it after all that excitement,” he said with a grin.

“Damn right,” I agreed, popping the tab and taking a swig. The beer was ice-cold, the perfect antidote to the humid heat. We floated there for a while, just sipping our drinks and soaking in the stillness, the world around us buzzing with the lazy hum of cicadas.

Keith leaned back, one arm behind his head, the other holding his can loosely. “Man, I needed this. Between work and the kids, I’ve been feelin’ like I’m running on empty.”

I glanced over, watching as he stared up at the sky, a distant look in his eyes. “That bad, huh?”

He shrugged. “Nah, not bad. Just... busy. Alyssa’s got that cheer competition coming up, so she’s all over the place. And you know Mason’s playing football now. Seems like every other night there’s practice or a game or somethin’.” He shook his head, smiling. “Kid’s a bruiser. Tougher than I ever was.”

I chuckled. “That ain’t hard.”

“Bite me,” he shot back, laughing as he took another sip. “Nah, but really... they’re good kids. Just keeps me on my toes. Becky’s been stressed, too. Thinks we’re spoiling ‘em. But hell, they’re only young once, right?”

“Right,” I agreed, letting my kayak drift closer to his. “Better to spoil ‘em while they’re little. World’ll toughen ‘em up soon enough.”

Keith nodded, his face softening. “Yeah... I just hope I’m doin’ it right. Feels like I’m fakin’ it half the time.”

“Ain’t we all?” I said, surprising even myself with the honesty. “Hell, I look at my brother, raising three kids on his own, and I got no clue how he does it. Makes me feel like I’m barely keepin’ my own life together, and I don’t even got kids.”

Keith looked over at me, his eyes searching. “You ever think about it? Havin’ kids?”

I took a long drink, letting the cold beer wash down the knot in my throat. “Yeah... sometimes. But I dunno. Can’t even hold down a relationship long enough to get to that point. Besides... ain’t no rush.”

Keith smirked, raising his can. “Yeah, well, don’t wait too long, old man. Clock’s tickin’.”

I flipped him off, and we both laughed, the sound echoing across the water. For a little while, everything felt normal. Just two buddies, floating through the Glades, trading jabs and talking about life.

We let the sun drift overhead, the sky turning that deep shade of blue that only comes in the height of afternoon. I closed my eyes, letting the warmth soak into me, the beer buzzing pleasantly in my veins.

I could’ve stayed like that forever, just drifting, floating, letting the world pass by.

A sharp, chattering noise snapped me out of my haze. I sat up, blinking as I tried to pinpoint the source. Keith was already looking, his head tilted back, a grin spreading across his face.

“Holy crap,” he said, pointing to a low-hanging branch over the water. “Would you look at that?”

I followed his finger and saw them—monkeys, at least half a dozen, hopping around in the branches, their long tails curling and uncurling as they chattered and played. I’d heard about the herpes monkeys that escaped out here, but I’d never actually seen them before.

“No way!” I said, already reaching for my phone. “You believe this? They’re real!”

Keith was grinning like a kid on Christmas. “Told ya, man! Thought they were just an urban legend, huh?” He swiped his phone open, aiming the camera up at the tree. “This is wild. Wait till I show the kids—they’ll flip.”

The monkeys were fascinating to watch, their little faces expressive, almost human. A couple of the smaller ones were wrestling on a branch, tumbling over each other, while a bigger one sat at the edge, calmly picking at something stuck in its fur.

Keith nudged me, his eyes gleaming with mischief. “Hey, I dare you to get up there and give one a smooch.”

I snorted, shaking my head. “Oh, hell no. I don’t need no monkey herpes. Besides, you’re the one always talkin’ about gettin’ close to nature. Pucker up, big boy.”

He laughed, “Yeah, right. Like Becky’d ever let me back in the house after that.”

I was still laughing, my phone held up to get a video, when the water exploded.

I didn’t see it coming. One second, the macaques were swinging and playing, the next, there was a massive shape hurtling out of the water, its body arching in an impossible leap, propelled by a tail as thick around as a telephone pole.

It was huge, bigger than any gator I’d ever seen. No, not a gator—a crocodile. Its mouth gaped open, rows of jagged teeth glinting like broken glass as it launched itself at the branch.

The whole family of monkeys barely had time to scream before they were swallowed up, the branch cracking with a sickening snap as the croc’s jaws closed around it. Leaves and fur exploded into the air, and then the monster fell back, crashing into the water with a roar that sent a tidal wave rolling right toward us.

“Shit!” I shouted, but there was no time to react. The wave hit, flipping my kayak and tossing me into the water like a ragdoll. Cold, murky darkness swallowed me, my limbs flailing as I struggled to figure out which way was up.

I burst through the surface, gasping for air, my heart thundering in my chest. My kayak was upside down, the cooler bobbing nearby, cans of beer spilling out and floating away. I whipped my head around, searching.

“Keith!”

He wasn’t in his kayak. It was empty, drifting in slow circles. Then I saw him, splashing wildly, his eyes wide with panic.

“Keith!” I started paddling toward him, but the water was churning, swirling from the massive splash. “Hold on, man!”

Keith was flailing, his arms slapping the surface, his mouth gulping for air as he sank, then bobbed back up, his face twisted with terror. “It’s in the water!” he screamed, his voice breaking. “Oh God, it’s in the water!”

I felt a cold shiver run down my spine, my eyes darting around us, searching for any sign of movement beneath the surface. But the water was dark, murky, rippling and swirling with the aftershocks of that thing’s massive tail.

“What... what the hell was that?” I stammered, my voice shaking.

Keith was hyperventilating, his arms flailing as he tried to keep himself afloat. “It just... it just took ‘em,” he gasped. “The whole damn branch... it just... it just took ‘em!”

I paddled closer, grabbing his arm to steady him. “Calm down, man! We gotta get out of the water!” I turned, scanning for the shore, my heart hammering so hard it felt like it would burst. “We gotta—”

The water rippled, a long, dark shape sliding just beneath the surface, circling. My breath caught in my throat.

Keith saw it too. His eyes went wide, his body going rigid. “Oh God... oh God...”

Somehow, by sheer adrenaline or blind luck, I managed to get Keith and I on his kayak. He was shaking so hard that the whole thing wobbled beneath him, but he clung to the sides, his knuckles white, his breathing ragged and shallow. I stayed close, one hand on his shoulder, the other gripping my paddle so tight my fingers ached.

Neither of us said anything as we started moving, our strokes slow and clumsy at first. I kept glancing over my shoulder, half-expecting to see that monster charging after us, jaws wide, teeth gleaming. But the water was calm now, the only ripples coming from our paddle.

We navigated through the winding channels, the mangroves crowding in close, their twisted roots reaching out like skeletal fingers. The air was heavy and humid, the buzz of insects echoing off the still water. My skin prickled, every shadow looking like a snout, every ripple like a tail.

Keith finally broke the silence, his voice low and shaky. “What... what the hell was that?”

I didn’t have an answer. I could still see it in my mind, that massive body launching out of the water, the sickening snap of the branch, the monkeys vanishing in its jaws. “I... I don’t know, man. It was a croc... but not one I’ve ever seen before.”

Keith nodded, his eyes fixed on the water. “Wasn’t no American croc. Face was all wrong... longer, broader. And that color...” He shuddered, his shoulders curling in. “Too dark. Almost black.”

I swallowed, my throat dry. He was right. American crocs are lighter, almost olive or tan. But this thing... it was a shadow, a living nightmare. “And the size...”

Keith let out a bitter laugh. “Yeah. Ain’t no croc in Florida gets that big. Hell, I don’t think there’s one anywhere that big.”

I thought about that, the way it had moved, how easily it had launched itself out of the water. “You don’t think... I dunno... maybe it was some kind of mutant? Some invasive species nobody’s seen before?”

Keith looked at me, his face pale, eyes sunken. “I don’t care what it was. I just don’t want to see it again.”

We paddled in silence for a while after that, our strokes slow and deliberate, every splash sounding too loud. The mangroves grew thicker, the light dimming as the branches overhead tangled together, forming a canopy that shut out the sun.

I glanced at Keith, his shoulders hunched, his eyes flicking nervously from shadow to shadow. He looked like hell, his face pale and drawn, his arms trembling. I could still see the fear in his eyes, the raw, primal terror that I felt echoing in my own chest.

Then, out of nowhere, he let out a shaky laugh. It sounded strange, hollow, almost hysterical. “Hey... would you rather see a skunk ape... or that thing again?”

It was so unexpected, so absurd, that I couldn’t help but laugh, too. The sound burst out of me, sharp and ugly, my body shaking with it. “Man, I’d take ten skunk apes over that thing.”

Keith grinned, his lips twitching as he tried to hold it together. “Yeah... yeah, me too.” He shook his head, his eyes still wide and wild. “Hell, I’d even let one give me a hug if it meant never seein’ that croc again.”

I laughed again, the sound bordering on madness. “You know they’d probably smell worse than you, right?”

“Impossible,” he shot back, a flicker of his old self returning. “I’m all cologne and manliness.”

I snorted, shaking my head. “More like beer and B.O.”

Keith opened his mouth to ask another one of his stupid *would you rather* questions, the kind that was meant to break the tension, to get us to laugh, to forget. But I wasn’t listening. Not really.

I was too busy watching the water behind us, my eyes scanning the dark surface, the way it moved unnaturally, like something huge was lurking beneath. My heart thudded, slow and heavy in my chest. I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck standing up, but I couldn’t place why.

Keith didn’t notice. He was too busy grinning like a maniac, his eyes flicking between me and the water. “Alright, alright—would you rather be stuck in a cage with a pissed-off bobcat or—”

And then I saw it.

A flash of yellow, glowing in the murky water. Bright, almost unnatural, like a beacon in the dark.

I froze. My pulse shot through the roof, my breath catching in my throat. I didn’t want to believe it. But there it was, cutting through the water, its massive body lurking just beneath the surface.

Keith kept talking, oblivious. His eyes were still focused on me, but he was leaning back now, feet propped up on his kayak, laughing to himself about the bobcat.

But the sound of his voice, the air around us, everything went dead silent. I could hear the blood rushing in my ears. I felt my heartbeat in my throat.

The eye.

That goddamn yellow eye. It lined up perfectly with Keith, glowing like a warning, like something that was waiting to strike.

And before I could shout—before I could even *think*—it happened.

The water exploded with a deafening crash. The huge shape lunged out of the depths, its enormous jaws snapping shut around Keith with a sickening, final *crack*.

I saw his body jerk back, his hands still gripping the sides of the kayak, but it was too late. The crocodile's massive mouth enveloped him in one swift motion, and Keith was gone. Just like that.

The splash was so powerful it knocked me back, the force throwing me off balance, my kayak tipping dangerously. But I didn’t care about that. I didn’t care about anything but what had just happened.

My mouth was open, but no sound came out. I was frozen, my body numb as I watched the water churn where Keith had been seconds before.

I don’t even think Keith had time to scream. One second he was there, laughing, the next he was swallowed whole by that creature.

It didn’t make sense. I didn’t *want* it to make sense.

I spun in my kayak, heart hammering in my chest, but there was no sign of Keith. No struggling. No bubbles. Just the ripples spreading out from where he’d been taken, and the faintest hint of a shadow moving beneath the water.

I could barely breathe.

I wanted to scream, to shout, to paddle in the direction where he’d been pulled under, but my body wouldn’t respond. My arms were shaking too hard to move, my mind too tangled in disbelief.

But then, the most horrifying thing of all happened.

That yellow eye appeared again, rising from the depths, so close I could’ve touched it. It glared at me, cold and empty, the size of a basketball, glinting with an eerie intelligence. It moved slowly, methodically, like it knew exactly what it was doing.

I didn’t know how to react. My limbs felt like lead, but my body screamed at me to paddle, to get the hell out of there. The water rippled around the creature, its massive head slowly rising out of the depths, as if savoring the moment.

And then, without warning, it sank back into the water, disappearing into the murky dark below.

I didn’t wait to see if it would come back. I didn’t care. I didn’t know what to do anymore.

I just started paddling.

As hard and as fast as I could.

I don’t know how I made it back to shore. My arms felt like they were going to fall off, my head was spinning, and my heart was still beating like it was trying to escape my chest. The whole time, I kept looking over my shoulder, half-expecting to see that yellow eye gliding just beneath the surface, following me, waiting for the right moment. But the water stayed still, calm as a grave, and I didn’t dare slow down.

When I hit the shore, I scrambled out of the kayak and onto solid ground. My legs felt like jelly, but I pushed myself forward, my feet slipping in the muck as I dragged the kayak up onto the bank. I didn’t even stop to catch my breath. I just kept moving.

I finally got to my truck, started the engine, and tore out of there like a maniac. I didn’t stop for anything. Didn’t even check to see if I’d left anything behind. I was just thinking of one thing—getting the hell away from that place.

I don’t know how I managed to drive home. I was shaking, the adrenaline still running through me in waves. I could barely keep my eyes on the road, but somehow, I made it. I don’t even remember how I got out of the truck and into the house.

I called the police as soon as I was inside. Told them everything I could, everything I saw. The crocodile, how it took Keith, how big it was, how it didn’t belong there. They didn’t know what to say at first, but I kept pushing, kept telling them how dangerous it was, how it wasn’t just some lost gator—it was something worse.

They said they’d send someone to investigate, but I knew it was already too late. That thing was still out there.

I don’t know what it was for sure. But I suspect it was an Australian saltwater crocodile. One of those monsters that’s been turning up in places it shouldn’t be, like the Nile crocs people have dumped in the Everglades. Somebody must’ve thought they could make a quick buck or just get rid of a dangerous pet, and now look where we are. Look where *Keith* is.

The thing is, sometimes there’s a damn good reason why environmental laws are in place. I didn’t get it before—thought they were just about being overcautious, or trying to ruin the fun for people who actually care about nature. But now I see it. We’re messing with something we don’t understand, and the consequences are real.

I hope to God whoever thought they could release that croc into the Everglades gets what’s coming to them. They deserve it. No one should have to pay that kind of price for somebody else’s recklessness.

As for me? I’m done. No more kayaking out there. No more thinking the Everglades is just another fun trip. I’ve seen what’s out there now. And I know some things are better left alone.

Keith’s gone. And I don’t think I’ll ever stop hearing the sound of those monkeys screaming.

And that eye. That *damn* eye.

I’ll never forget it.
