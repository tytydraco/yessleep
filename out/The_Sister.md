Okay I’m going to be honest I’m scared very very scared that's why I’m writing this. And I know there is going to be that one person who is like you should go to the police. Well first off, shut up second of all I have my older brother who is a police officer and we are currently investigating the situation but I feel like something bad might happen so I figured that I should let someone else know what has happened to me. So here we go.   
It started this last fall. It was a cold day and the air was chilling me to my bones. I never gave the fall much thought it was always just another season to me. But this year I felt myself checking behind my back every twenty minutes. Maybe it was because of her. When I arrived at my college the building loomed overhead. I sighed before walking in. The warm air from the heater blasted me in my face. I brushed past the kids blocking the walkway, giving me angry glances. I paid them no mind. I was used to people glaring at me.   
I walked over to the biology wing of the community college walking into the room and a girl caught my eye. She had two long scars that started from her lips up to her earlobes. Her bright green eyes stared ahead as she looked at the equations on the board. Her white hair shining underneath the overhead fluorescent lights. I avoided her and sat down in my seat. I pulled open my text book and started to work on my homework before the bell rang for class to start.   
“Hey Mark” said a voice.   
I turned around to see Sarah, her glasses were perched on her nose, her blue eyes looking down on me.   
“Oh hey Sarah” I replied. She took a seat next to me. And opened her own text book.   
“Are you excited for the project?” she asked.   
“I mean I guess I am,” I replied.   
“Well I’m hoping we get to pick partners,” she said. I hummed in response, turning my face away from her.   
“How is Seania and Brianna doing?” I asked to break the silence.   
“They are doing good though they didn't notice my hair cut this morning” she said.   
It was then when I recognized her hair she had indeed cut it. Her usual shoulder length brown hair was now a pixie cut.   
“I’m going to be honest” I started “I didn't even notice it”  
She groaned “you all are blind”  
I laughed in response, paying no mind to the white haired girl in the corner boring her eyes into my back.   
   It was about thirty minutes later when the last bit of the students arrived into the classroom and the lesson started.   
“Alright as many of you may know today we are going to start working on a project” said Mr. Brown “but due to some issues I have decided to assign partners instead of letting you pick them” the entire class groaned. I turned to Sarah who was giving me a somewhat pleading look.   
“On that note let's get to it”   
Mr. Brown assigned each of us and I perked up when I heard my name “Mark Keith and Shelia White” finished Mr. Brown.   
I felt my blood run cold as I looked over at the younge white haired female in the corner.   
No no no I thought. This can't be happening this has to be a dream suddenly Sarah's voice bright me out of my daze.  
“Well good luck with the freak” she said before grabbing her backpack and moving to go sit with her partner.   
I gulped before grabbing my backpack and went over to the white haired female. She paid me no attention as I sat down. Instead she kept looking through her text book. Before finally speaking up.   
“Stop being so stiff you out of anyone should know better than to trust rumors” she said suddenly.   
I turned my head away from her and instead brought out my text book flipping through it. Though out of the corner of my eyes I could see her roll her eyes.   
“Look I don’t bite so stop acting like I’m going to kill you” she said.   
I looked over at her. “Your entire family are psycho and you expect for me not to be on edge” I said.   
“Correction my younger sister is. My parents are into business and other things but they're not murders” she said.   
“Sure whatever” I mumbled.   
“You're just like the rest of them, you're a sheep” she said.   
I slammed my hands on the counter “I’m not a sheep!” I yelled.   
Shelia raised an eyebrow “are you sure about that? '' she said.   
It was then when I noticed everyone in the class was looking at me I gulped before sitting back down.   
“Good boy” said the female before flipping through her book to a page. “Let's do anatomy on an aardvark” she said.   
I nodded my head in agreement, not bothering to pay her any attention after that.   
Okay we are going to pause right here because I feel like I need to give a little context to why nobody likes this girl. You see there was an incident quite a few years back where her younger sister killed several people and hung their heads on hooks in a barn in the backyard of the house.   
The young girl was sent to a mental asylum and Shelia’s parents left, only giving her a check for rent and stuff every month. The incident with her sister happened when Shelia was sixteen. She is twenty two at the time of writing or at least I think I don't really know anymore. After that she changed, she became distant, her hair turned white and then she started to wear a mask.   
It was only when it fell off her face one very windy day in highschool when we all realized that she had been carving a smile into her face. No one ever talked to her really after that. Even I never wanted to talk to her after that, why would she never tell her best friend that she was struggling? Anyway enough of my rambling I’m not here to give you all my entire life story.  
I walked out of the classroom with a scowl on my face.   
“Mark wait up!” called out a voice.   
I turned to see Sarah. I sighed.   
“I don’t want to hear it,” I said.   
“Hear what I was just going to ask you how it went with the freak?” she asked.   
“You know I may be scared of her. But even I know better than to call her a freak” I said turning to Sarah.   
Sarah scowled at me “taking her side now huh?” she asked.   
“No I’m just saying you have no idea what she is capable of Sarah I would suggest being careful what you say” I said.   
Of course Sarah would not listen to me and the next thing I knew I was breaking up a fight between the two of them in the cafeteria. The two of them were dragged off into the principal's office.   
“Geez thankfully that bitch is now gone” said Brianna.   
I rolled my eyes.   
“Yeah she was super annoying” said Sienna.   
“You guys need to stop, there is no point in this,” I said.   
“Taking her side now Mark” said Brianna.   
“No I just dont think there is a point to this anymore sure I don't like her but I don't go around calling her a freak. Stop trying to make her life a living hell”   
Brianna rolled her eyes.   
“Sure\~ totally not like she deserves it. She carved a smile into her face, Mark! What type of person does that” said Sienna.     
I rolled my eyes before walking away. It may be lunch but it was the end of my school day anyway.   
I walked home looking through my contacts.   
Lets pray that I still have her number in my phone I thought.   
I felt myself smile when I found it. I clicked on messages and an array of messages popped up arranging from happy ones to ones where I remembered her calling me in the middle of the night crying due to her sister. I dropped her a quick message for a meet up because she very likely got suspended.   
I immediately got a response back with an address. I continued my walk home but the familiar feeling of being watched suddenly crept up my spine. And then suddenly there was a piercing feeling in my head as the sound of static filled my head. I turned my head, my heart beating out of my chest, my breathing quickened at the edge of a forest standing by an abandoned playpark was a tall figure. It wore a tuxedo and had paper white skin. The most noticeable thing was the lack of a face. I felt the fear crawl up my spine as it seemingly stared at me before turning and walking away.   
I stood frozen before running as fast as I could back to my house which at this point was not too far. But by the time I got home my lungs burned and my head had a splitting headache.   
There is no way that was real I thought.   
I scrambled through my draws for a bottle of pills. I recognized the labels of my schizophrenia medication and I swallowed the meds quickly before taking some ibuprofen.   
I could have sworn I took them earlier I thought. I looked down at the pill pack and realized that I hadn't. As I sat down by my bed stand catching my breath I felt my phone ding. I looked down to see a text message from Shelia telling me she was out of the school and if they could meet up at her house to figure out the rest of the project. I sent her a quick message before gathering my bearings and heading out the door. I opened it quickly before walking down the street. The feeling of being watched is still there.  
I think this is where we take another break. You see I have schizophrenia and I have had it since I was young. It developed when I was fifteen. It was also the vision type. Anyway,      
Her house is large, it was the same house her sister killed those kids and it was the same house where the incident occurred. I would say that it is cursed but it is really not. Though if I was the homeowner I would never tell anyone what occurred in that house. Anyway when I arrived she opened the door and her signature frown still on her face. I stepped into the house.   
“You already know where everything is. I'm not going to bother showing you around” she said.   
I nodded my head as she led the way to the library of her house. I walked in a large room with many books lining the shelf. I watched as she pulled down a few books.   
“So since you act like a third grader I brought down a few books that talk about aardvarks for their reading level.   
I rolled my eyes before grabbing a book and sat down reading it writing down any interesting information I found. Before long it was about seven o'clock at night I yawned.   
“He Shelia I’m going to get going” I said. I looked over at her, her head resting on a pillow softly snoring.   
I quickly grabbed a blanket and threw it over her. Making sure she was comfortable I then quickly left her house and went home.  
I don't know what happened but our relationship improved after that night. I noticed her smile more and be more talkative with me even after our project was done. We continued to hang out and before long I stopped talking to Sarah. With my lead Shelia seemed to form a little bit of a friend group of her own.  Little did I know that actually being her friend again would be the worst decision that I have ever made.   
Sarah disappeared one day. We had an argument a few days prior about Shelia and then she stormed off and I brushed it off. But it was weird for her to be gone for days straight. As I pondered this thought I looked out of the window and saw it again the figure my blood running cold. I felt my heart beat faster threatening to break out of my chest. I turned my head quickly but the figure would not let me. There was a sudden noise of static. I felt myself grip my head and I screamed suddenly I heard a voice call out my name.   
“Mark Mark” said the voice. I brought my head up to the voice and the static stopped. I then turned to look out the window and the man was no longer there. I turned my head to the voice Shelia sat with her eyes filled with worry.   
“Are you okay?” she asked.   
“There was a man out there” I stammered out   
“Silly Mark, there was no one out there,” she said.   
I felt my blood run cold and I buried my head in my hands. I shook my head as I felt my heart beat faster and my breathing. Something was very off about what was going on. I stared at the female before grabbing my stuff and moving spots. Brushing off her widening smile.   
A few days later I felt really bad and decided to walk over to Shelia’s house. I knocked on the door. There was nothing. I brushed it off and opened the door. The lights were off as I walked about calling out the young female's name but that was when I noticed it the back door was open just like the night that Shelia’s sister was found. I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. Before I walked out to the back of the yard. There was a light coming from the red barn.   
I walked over to a crack and peaked in suddenly though my blood ran cold and my heart began to quicken.   
Brianna, Seanna and Sarah were all strapped to chairs. Brianna’s normally blond hair was now a dark dirty yellow, her finger nails now gone. Sienna was left unscathed for the most part. And Sarah oh Sarah her eyes were gone and each and every one of her nails were missing she also looked like she had hot wax poured on her.   
But then there was another girl. She was at least six seven her white hair was pulled back in a ponytail and her skin was paper white. She wore a long white tuxedo jacket with horizontal stripes on the sleeves. The sleeves covered her hands she had on a black undershirt and black tie; she also had pencil skirts and black tights. But her most striking feature was her smile. The scar on her face stretched from her lips to her ears. It was Shelia.   
I felt the tears run down my face but I couldn't take my eyes away from her. I felt like I was in a sort of trance.   
“We are going to play a little game with you too,” she said suddenly.   
Sarah began to shake her head no   
“No, why not?” asked Shelia.   
Sarah whimpered.   
“I asked you a question” said Shelia as she stabbed a knife through Brianna's leg the girl screamed.   
Sarah shook her head no “please stop” she whimpered.   
Shelia laughed, her eyes widening. “No” said Shelia before stopping almost like she was thinking something.   
“Aww but I don't want to. I was having fun” she suddenly said “well you three our fun is now over my brother said I had to stop now” she said. “But he did say we could play one final game. Though I’m going to keep Sarah, she is too easy.”   
“What is that supposed to mean you fucking bitch!” screamed Brianna.   
Shelia turned her head quickly, staring down the female before grabbing her throat.   
“Oh Brianna you naive little bitch you should be glad I don't just kill you here right now after all you do deserve it more than most.”   
“I dare you to do it than Shelia”   
Suddenly her smile widened as I watched her arms grow longer, her fingers growing into long claws. Her facial features are disappearing. I held back my own screams when she suddenly grabbed Brianna from the chair, the rope cutting into her wrists and ankles as Shelia  tossed her to the other side of the room. She got up to run but found that she couldn't. Suddenly there was a ripping sound as a mouth formed on Shelia’s face. Her teeth long and jagged, the smile that terrifying smile reached up to her ears. She let out a low laugh as white tendrils erupted from her back. They seemed to be covered in some sort of fur with little spikes at the end of each one she started screeching like some sort of animal.   
She picked Brianna up and slammed her on the ground, the female screamed in pain. She was then picked up again and then slammed harder on the ground like she was some sort of doll. I quickly turned away and covered my ears with tears running down my face as Brianna screamed. And when they finally stopped I turned back to the scene quickly regretting it entrails were strewn everywhere Shelia stood in the middle back to what seemed normal she then licked the blood off her hand.    
“Now you two do you guys have anything else to say?”   
Sienna quickly shook her head no  
“Good\~ no Seanna what you are going to do is you're going to try and find these pages” said Shelia holding up eight pages.   
“I will be in the forest trying to hunt you if you manage to follow the rules and get all pages you will get to leave and if you dont you will be my next meal understood”  
“What are your rules?” asked Seanna  
“You know the paper game?” Shelia asked.   
I felt my breath hitch as Shelia circled the chairs. The blond nodded her head.   
“Well it is the same thing just don’t look into the trees” said Shelia with a smirk.    
I didn’t hear the blonds' response after that. I quickly ran out of there before I would see any more carnage. But before I got back to the house I heard it again, the static filling my head. I turned my head to see the figure staring at me.    
What does it want with me? Why does it keep doing this to me? I cried out into my head tears running down my face but instead of curling up I ran as fast as I could go.  
It was a few days later when they found Sienna and Sarah’s body’s they were found torn up and Shelia was missing. I felt dread rise up and tears run down my face. I stopped turning up to school after that day. The feeling of being watched has never left me. She has never left me. Sometimes she tries and tempts me with her body by dressing in a playboy bunny costume. And other days I will see her just watching me. I have a feeling it is going to end soon.   
Update   
That was where he died. Right under a tree next to her house.  We never gave it much thought Mark was always a little crazy and then he comes to the police station with this elaborate story of this girl killing people and how nuts she was. Kinda wished I would have listened to him sooner. There have been sightings of a man with a trench coat and gray skin and black soulless eyes with a weird black substance coming out of them. And for whatever reason he also has wings?   
 For some reason I know it is Mark. but whenever people go near him there is a substance that is often flung at them dissolving their skin. I'm an example but I somehow survived maybe it is because I am his brother I would never know. Sometimes the body’s are found with Raven feathers embedded into them.  
 Though I will never know what really happened the night of his disappearance and what had happened to him I know he had a feeling of being watched for months. Sometimes out of the corner of my eyes I see a figure of a girl dressed in a playboy bunny costume or a tuxedo like she is tempting me to follow her I have a feeling it is going to end soon
