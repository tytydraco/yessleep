*Title self-explanatory. Me and a couple buddies were out on a hike in the woods and came across a car that was a mile and a half from any roads. We smelled it first, followed the smell to the car, then popped the trunk to find the poor guy inside. Obviously, we called the cops, and as we waited for them to arrive, I tried to record what was written on the inside of the trunk. It felt like it was the right thing to do. That being said, anybody know what to make of this?*

The furthest back I can remember is still not far enough. Sometimes, if I strain myself, reach deep past my skull and into the folds of my brain to tug on a few things, I can remember the sound of the trunk falling closed. A sudden thump that cut off the world and everything in it. A sound that I imagine was not unlike what one would hear after being hit in the back of the head with something hefty.

Before that though, there’s nothing much I can really recall.

I don’t remember why exactly I was dumped in the trunk. Although, I’m fairly certain I did not choose to do this to myself purely because, *for the love of God*, who would? I have no idea what kind of night I was having oh so long ago before I wound up in the trunk. I don’t remember if I’d spent it at the bar, or at the club, or my house, or my nan’s, or the goddamn grocery store. I *don’t* remember.

I have no clue where the car was when I was thrown into its trunk either, and for that matter, I don’t even know what make or model the car was. It could’ve been a Lexus, a Prius, a Mustang, a Charger, a Mazda. It could’ve been black or blue or white or red or fucking electric pimp green for all I know, but what I do know for certain is that it *was* a car. I know because from the inside out, I can tell it had to have been something small, something cruel; something like a sedan, or a Corvette, or something else with a trunk barely the size of a small man.

There was a time when I did remember all those things: those crucial, crucial days of infancy before I began to cross over. I had a phone back then, and back then I was an idiot. Instead of rationing my fragile time with it to extend its life as far as I could into the countless millennia that would come to pass, I drained the last of the battery alternating between calls with loved ones and the police. Neither of whom ever found me, and neither of whom I can even really remember now. But none of that is important anyway because things like names and faces and the makes and models of cars all belong to the old world, and I started scratching to write about the new.

In short, the transition over to what I have come to believe as the afterlife was a difficult one, and I believe it will be difficult for the vast majority of people as well. Really, I believe it will be worse than difficult. It will be unbearable. I have no idea what I would’ve done if I went into the trunk a claustrophobe, a religious man, a maniac, or God forbid a *sane* man. If I were any of those things I likely would’ve never wandered my way back to a steady thought. The crossover is a slow, painful, agonizing journey, but a journey that I unfortunately suspect is mandatory for anybody who chooses to be buried. So, if any of what follows disturbs, upsets, or bothers you in anyway, and you also happen to be expecting to die soon, I highly suggest making arrangements with your local crematorium as soon as you can. That, and do a little research on the Egyptians. They were onto something.

The culture believed, (or somehow foresaw, perhaps), that it would be necessary to bury their dead with an assortment of objects to carry over with them to the other side. They figured that wherever they were headed, that they might as well be prepared for what was to come. It was common practice to bury with themselves, among other things, a full assortment of tools, farming equipment, all types of food, bowls, various utensils, both decorative and non-decorative urns, currency, and of course what they’re most known for burying themselves with: a metric fuck ton of jewelry.

You can do without the jewelry. You can do without most of the things I mentioned, really. I only mention the Egyptians at all because yes, they were right in concept, but not necessarily in practice. Their intention was right on the money, but their execution fell short. They buried these things with themselves to prepare for the destination, for the life they believed they would go on to live after crossing over, when really, they should’ve been packing things to kill time during the journey. Because sure, the food and the tools and *the money* of course would be great to have once you actually arrive in the afterlife, but what in the hell are you going to use to pass the time, the *unfathomable* amount of time, getting there? Dice? A deck of cards? This was the question I wish I knew to ask myself when first taking inventory of the trunk.

Over the course of my first few hours in the trunk, in my would-be-tomb, my shag sarcophagus, I quickly became aquatinted with the items I would unknowingly spend the rest of eternity with. My burial goods. There was of course my phone, a half full plastic water bottle, a glob of gum stuck in the carpet, a subpar nude magazine, an empty handgun, a thumbtack, and forty dollars split between five fives, a tenner, four ones, and a handful of change. I took stock of these things using quick and efficient bursts from my phone’s light in between my frantic calls for help, flashing it around the trunk like a coked-out paparazzi photographer fiending for an angle.

By morning when my flashlight snuffed itself out along with the life of my phone, I was plunged into the dark. It wasn’t until the sun rose to noon the following day that I realized I could see again. In the center of the top of the trunk was a small hole about the size of a couple pinpricks, nothing big enough to see out of, but just large enough to let enough light in the trunk to see with. It shown like a spotlight down onto the black carpeting, and just barely illuminated my array of burial goods as they hid away in their respective corners of the trunk. Before long, I curled around that light like a curtain, and just like that, I had my stage.

And so, I began to play.

The water bottle went first. I hooked it into the light and guzzled its contents after resisting thirst for a whole thirty minutes. Objectively, it was a stupid decision to make from a survival standpoint, but seeing as how things turned out, it wouldn’t have really mattered how long I stretched the water. Eventually, after a certain point, I found that I could only get so thirsty; I could only get so hungry. My needs would inevitably plateau.

Next up on stage was the phone. Now that it was dead and had no other immediate use than it being a blunt object, I tried in vain to bash both at the lock on the trunk and at the spotlight hole. Both attempts were overwhelmingly unsuccessful.

The thumbtack was more of the same. I tried puncturing holes in the metal where I could, and for about five minutes I was actually making some good progress with it, but then the plastic bit snapped off and I was left with only a microscopic sharpened rod. I couldn’t for the life of me manage to puncture anything with that.

The money, of course, was fitting, but useless. Hopefully the afterlife takes cash. I have yet to find a place that even recognizes the concept of money at all, let alone the concept of a singular “place.” Everything blends together here into a dark-bright slurry, more or less. Not much room for a seven eleven, but then again, too much room for a seven eleven.

The handgun being empty was something I actually found to be extremely funny after a couple years. For the longest time I resisted the urge to touch the thing. I didn’t even look at it until roughly three days had passed. I was on my last legs and the hunger and the thirst had begun to really gnaw at me, and I was so afraid of the weapon because had it not been empty, had it been loaded, I could have “escaped.” It wasn’t a way out of the trunk, sure, but it was in fact a way *out*. Either way, I’m getting ahead of myself again. It's hard, not to.

I’ll get to the gun.

Naturally, after acknowledging the handgun’s presence, I took a break to read the nude magazine. I read it cover to cover just to pass the time, scanning it back and forth under the pinhole’s light a little like a human copy machine. Try as I might though, it was impossible to see entire images at once, and so I had to rely on my memory to make up the cover in its entirety. Reading that magazine, reconstructing the images from their fragments in my memory was one of my first exercises in abusing my imagination, and it would not be the last. Regardless, after I finished the magazine, I was left a little unsatisfied. Then came the tears and the first rumbles of maddening laughter.

When the pinhole darkened, marking the end of my first full day in the trunk, I knew already that my time was running thin. The human body could only sustain itself for so long, and “so long” happened to be right around the corner. Three days is about the maximum a man can go without water. That meant I had about two days to live give or take how much time the half empty water bottle bought me. Two days to get out. Two days to save myself. Two days that I spent more or less the same as the first.

What else was I to do?

I’d already exhausted all my limited resources, and no amount of kicking nor screaming was going to get me out of the trunk. I’d tried and failed at all that. Multiple times. The simple fact of the matter was I did not have the tools to get out. Before I knew it the second day came and went, and then I was on my third. It was at that point, the point at which the pinhole began to fade for the third time, that I knew I needed to confront the gun, figuring that at that point, I was as close to dead as one could be anyway. It wasn’t a temptation any more, it was an option. *Three* options, actually.

The handgun provided me with one of three outcomes.

One, it was loaded and I could use however many bullets I had to break the lock on the trunk. Two, it was loaded and I could choose to use the gun to find another less desirable but more convenient way out. Or three, the gun was not loaded, and all the dwelling I’d been doing was completely and utterly pointless.

As you know already, it wound up being the third.

So, as the pinhole darkened at the end of my third day in the trunk, I curled up and prepared mentally for my body to begin consuming itself, for my organs to start shutting down, and for finally my consciousness to slowly begin to dissolve away along with my brain. Oh, how easy that would have been, to go slowly. Slowly but *quickly* in the grand scheme of things.

I settled to wait for death to come, half expecting the reaper to come knock, knock, knocking on the metal. *Maybe he’d be the one to let me out*, I thought. *With a jingle of keys and the pop of a trunk, he’d lead me to a pinhole light at the end of a tunnel.*

And so, I waited. And I waited. And I waited. I waited a day, and then a week, two weeks, a month. Remember: these are all estimates, but after roughly three months had passed in the trunk, I noticed that not only was I still conscious, but the pinhole had also refused to relight.

It never returned, not after it faded at the end of the third day. After all the time that had passed, not the light nor my death seemed to come for me. The sun refused to rise, and I refused to rest. I could still feel my arms, my legs, that knot in my back that had begun to grow roots into the carpet. Despite it all though, despite the hunger, and the thirst, and the time, I was still me. It wasn’t until my first year in the trunk had passed that I figured I was immortal, that I couldn’t die, or that more than likely I was *already* dead. Dead, or experiencing some *form* of death, anyway. An in-between.

This was when I feel I made my first shaking steps forward in the long crossover to the afterlife. This was when I truly began to settle in for the long ride. And this was when my mind first began to wander away from me.

The main issue I faced after all the panic and the fear and the existential, (or really, *post*\-existential dread), was how to fill the time. I was in a dark, dark place with nothing to do, nowhere to go, and no one to talk to for years upon years. It was no wonder that I eventually lost my mind.

Ironically though, it was only *after* losing my mind, after I sat and stewed for a while in the nebulous state of existence I found myself in, that I reacquainted myself with my burial goods. My few-things. Slowly, I began to see them in new ways, and my interest in them reignited. Without the light, and more importantly without the constraint of time, they all took on new forms. Take the gum for example. The gum was my first lesson in the pursuit of experience.

Eating it was a tremendous mistake; I know that now.

I know now that I would’ve probably gotten more use out of it, more time, more *experience*, if I’d used it as a sort of stress ball, squeezing it between my fingers, mashing it out for ages on and off, but unfortunately, I’d been starving for over a year at that point. I was a hungry, hungry man and I did as hungry men do. I ripped the gum from the carpet and started to chew, slowly masticating it into oblivion. It lasted five years. The muscle memory though, the repetitive, routine motion of chewing, of knocking my teeth together, lasted six.

In hindsight had I resisted the urge to eat, had I used the gum instead as a plaything like dough or clay or some other vessel for stress release, it would’ve lasted much, much longer. I learned from my mistake though, and moved on to the coins.

I used them as I should’ve used the gum. Although it was extremely tempting to chew on the coins too, to feel their coppery sting on my tongue, their tinny bite on the crowns of my teeth, I resisted the urge. Instead, I played it smart and I rubbed them. I pinched two of them between my index finger and my thumb, and I rubbed. Sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly, I ground the coins together, listening to them scream against one another. They lasted much longer than the gum, but in due time they too disappeared. It was then that I realized that everything I touched would eventually degrade, evaporate in my hands in due time. My fingers like a stream eroding away riverbed stones; it wasn’t a matter of if they would degrade—it was a matter of when. And that meant I couldn’t just rely on physical sensation alone. I needed to learn to see again.

After the coins, the gun entertained me for a good many years simply because it was something I could use to practice my new-sight. Without light, I couldn’t actually see the thing, but with enough time, touch, and disassembly, I could picture it in its entirety in my hands. I saw all of it at once, straight through every angle, every edge, every crisply machined cut, inside and out, innards and skin. I learned a lot from that gun. Mainly though, I learned how to see without light, and I took that skill and moved on to the magazine. (The nude magazine, I should clarify, not the magazine for the handgun. I’d already explored that magazine extensively.)

The magazine was both my greatest challenge and greatest experience. It took a few decades of careful touch and thorough inspection to learn to read in the dark, to differentiate the ink from the page, and all the colors from one another. Once I *had* learned however, and once I’d read the magazine a couple thousand times, it opened up a world of possibilities. It was how I met the first of a long line of visitors.

There was a woman about halfway through the magazine that I managed to help guide out of her prison of two dimensions. Even now I do not know why she was the first I was able to make real. Maybe I had an affinity for her, maybe it was by random chance, or maybe she was just plain easy to read, but regardless of the why, one day she decided to make herself known. One day, she leapt from the print, my imagination drawing on the dark. She stepped defiantly out into the pitch and off of the page, splattering into reality like paint onto a fresh canvas.

She was a supermodel from Texas named Montana, and I was fascinated with her voice. Partly because sound was one of my least exercised senses, but mostly because her voice went over like the radio: like whiskey strained through fine gravel. It was scratchy and I itched. Initially though, I had only taken to listening to her in hopes of getting lucky (though I have no idea how that would’ve worked because she was only about a foot tall), but the longer she talked the more enthralled I became with her. She chose that name: Montana. She wasn’t born with it as I’d initially assumed. Apparently, she chose it because firstly, it was a conversation starter, and secondly, Montana was a classic for strippers, which happened to be her previous profession before she got into modeling.

“If it ain’t broke,” she said, and I couldn’t agree more.

It was only after we got past introductions that it finally registered to me how odd the whole situation was. Not the trunk, not my undeath, but the fact that I was talking to a twelve-inch-tall supermodel named Montana, and that even though I’d blinded myself long ago with the pin, I could still see her silhouette glowing in perfect technicolor.

I blinded myself both out of boredom and the pursuit of reading better. It was too dark to see anyway, and I was already going off of touch alone to read the magazine. I felt that if I cut down on the vestigial, then my leftover mental faculties could be better used elsewhere. The neurons I’d used to see would instead be used to feel. Given enough time, I’m sure I could’ve brought Montana to life regardless of the loss of my eyes, but I was an impatient man. Which was again, ironically, a terrible quality to have in my predicament.

In hindsight though, even if I had kept my eyes, I’m not entirely certain they would’ve worked anymore. It’d been so long after all, that even if the trunk magically popped open somewhere along the way and I spilled back out into the world, (much like Montana did into mine), I doubted my eyes would’ve even registered the change. Either the overload of sensation would’ve spurred an aneurism and reduced me to a gaping idiot, or my mind would’ve simply refused to accept the information altogether. Either way, I’d come to terms with the reality that the trunk was all I had. That there *was no* going back. There’s that, and the fact that I was already dead. So no, I didn’t need my eyes.

I spent a lifetime with Montana. She was a friend. I greatly appreciated her company. Over the years she told me about her old life, and slowly we built a new one for her in the trunk. I’d flip back and forth through the magazine, tell her what was on the page, and anytime she heard something she liked, she’d drag it out of the print and into the trunk with us. Eventually we’d furnished the entire trunk with the sofas and the chairs and the beds, and whatever else the other models on the other pages were lying on. We put up walls and laid out a floor. We even managed to bring back the light with decorative lamps and windows to let in the sun. Not *the* sun, but a sun nonetheless.

For the longest time we were both content with our existence. She’d lounge around on her sofa’s, and we’d talk the time away. Sometimes too, more often than not, we would spend the time silently. Her going about her motions, and me lying curled around my mental diorama like the world largest and most deformed cat. My favorite time was always the morning. Every morning Montana would ask me how I was and I’d tell her, “I’m well today.” Always today, never tomorrow, and certainly never yesterday because of course there were no days anymore. There was only the now, and even then, after a millennium I’m not entirely convinced a “now” exists within the confines of the trunk either.

One particular day though, Montana asked for a front door. After a little bit of waffling, I asked her why she’d want something as ridiculous as that, and she told me, “Because I want to go out.” Then I asked her if she was going to come back and she said, “Yes.”

I didn’t believe her. I knew she was lying because I’d reasoned that she wasn’t real. And if she wasn’t real, that meant she had to have been coming from me. And if she was coming from me, that meant her thoughts were my thoughts. And if her thoughts were my thoughts, that meant I could read them. And so, I read them and knew she was lying. Either way, I didn’t blame her for wanting to go. We’d shared a life in that trunk together, and all things do have to come to an end, so, I installed the door. She packed her things to go, but before she left, we decided to share one last dance.

The room fell away along with the door, all except for a record player which started to spin a tune. She moved to the corner, and began to waltz along to the song while I tossed her my bills. I wasn’t being perverted; I was just trying to help her, to send her on her way with some money to spend wherever she wound up. Change for the ferryman, that kind of thing. Regardless, I have no idea where the bills went. Either they were swallowed up by the dark itself, or they slipped quietly between where the angles met in the corner, one of the two.

On her way out, I decided to ask her a question. I thought that maybe by talking to myself in this extremely roundabout way that I could uncover some of the memories I’d lost from my time before the trunk. I asked her, “Who am I, really?”

She thought long and hard about the question, then answered, “Not a good man, but not a bad one either.”

Only half satisfied with the answer, I asked her, “Ok, and who are *you*, really?”

“Why, I’m you.”

“Yes, I know that. I was hoping you’d be a little more specific.”

She cocked her head. “Well actually, I misspoke. I *was* you.”

I knew what she meant. She was trying to suggest that she was one of my past lives. I appreciated the attempt to legitimize our life together, to insist that she was in fact different than me even if we were the same, but I didn’t buy it. I didn’t buy that I was tapping into my soul’s ancestral memory, because then that would mean I was not only once a stripper named Montana but also probably an Egyptian Pharoh considering how much I talked about them. Two problems with that: I hate the pyramids, and I would not willingly name myself Montana.

In the end I simply smiled and told her, “To each their own, then.” And with that, finally, Montana took a bow and stepped between the cracks in the corner of the trunk. And just like that, she was gone and I was alone again.

I did try, briefly (for about a couple hundred years), to bring others from the magazine to life. I ripped them sometimes willingly, sometimes forcefully from the pages of the magazine, and over time they built a small world. They started the same as Montana did, drawing from the contents of the magazine, extracting materials from the various backdrops like furniture and trees and brick and mortar. They started with a simple room, then that room became a house, then a neighborhood, then a suburb, then an entire city.

Before long, it was a well-oiled utopia. Since their only frame of reference for construction were carefully designed interior sets, thoughtfully framed shots of skylines, and meticulously scouted natural locations, the whole of the world felt so very designed. It was beautiful, really. An architect’s wet dream. A city of supermodels shaded by a lumpy malnourished mountain range, picturesque in the most literal sense of the world.

I destroyed it.

Even after everything they built, it didn’t evoke the same feelings I had experienced with Montana, so one day I blinked and the city was gone. It was then that I gave up on the magazine entirely to instead turn inward. Having expended my burial goods completely, and exhausted all experience I from them, I entered a long hibernation.

It was a sleepless dream.

I curled up in utero and let time crash over me in breaking waves. It was relentless, but like an age-old stone on an age-old shore I learned to ignore the insistence, the incessance of time. With time my skeleton solidified. With time my body calcified. I spent countless ages completely motionless in both mind and body. A pebble adrift in the void, I was convinced that this would be the remainder my fate because it did make sense. We enter this life ripped from the dark, and after we’re done, we return to it. To the void we come and go. Because what is this trunk really, but a womb to curl up in and wait?

There was a time, however, sometime not too long ago, a time anywhere between fifty and five hundred thousand years ago, where I felt a shift. Something had changed. And so, for the first time in oh so long, I unfurled myself from my ball and felt my toes prod an inch further into the dark.

The trunk, it seemed, had gotten bigger.

At first, I thought it was absurd. I figured that it’d been so long, so very very long, that I’d just forgotten the dimensions of the trunk, but deep down, I knew that wasn’t true. I knew, because my dimensions were all I had left. They were my only reminder of my existence because they were the aspect of myself that the trunk reminded me of the most. Every shift, every twitch, every stretch-in-vain would remind me of the fact that I was a tall man stuck in a trunk the size of a small man.

My suspicions were confirmed when the next day I unfurled myself once more, and found that I could stretch *another* inch into the dark, the next day three, the next four, until finally for the first time in God knows how long, I was able to lie flat on my back, and it was divine.

The process continued on like that until eventually I could stand, I could walk around, I could jog from end to end of the trunk, but with time that jog became longer and longer. The trunk was running away from me. Its walls disappeared into the void, faster than I could possibly hope to chase them, further than I could possibly hope to catch them. Even the carpet, the ground beneath my feet began to feel less tangible by the moment, fizzling out beneath the soles of my feet into nonexistence.

The trunk itself was abandoning me, and with it, it devoured my body. At some point, after drifting in the ether for long enough, I recognized I wasn’t one singular thing anymore. My mind had long since expanded past its physical boundaries, long since oozed from the folds of my brain to fill the trunk. My being like water from a sponge leaking out onto an empty countertop, I left myself somewhere along the way to rot in a shag carpet grave.

All at once I could feel every inch of the trunk. Every nook. Every cranny. I was the trunk and the trunk was me, and so I began to scratch my words like constellations into the walls, tattoos into my skin. My final message before opening my door, before squeezing through my pinhole: "Burn, burn, burn, do not go slowly."

 Because God help you if you settle on that casket.
