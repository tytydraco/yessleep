Hello, I was told to write about my recent experiences on here by a friend. I told him what happens when I drive in the dead of night to my work education place and he says it would interest you people.

For a bit of background, I work in electric and gas grid management - it's a relatively new job for me and while I have my state certified electronic engineering title, I have no idea about natural gas grids yet. So in order to take over on-call duties for the gas grid, I have to go to a "gas school" that's about 160km (about 100 miles for our american friends) away from my home and was thus provided with a hotel room on the compound. For 14 weeks spread over one year, I get to come to this beautiful, forsaken, nothing village in the middle of nowhere, deep in Eastern Germany.

And to round this background out, for those who don't know what I mean when I say Eastern Germany, let me give you a quick rundown on my personal story with Eastern Germany, before I tell you the weird things that are happening when I drive there. 

Up until the year 1989, with demolition of the wall lasting until 1991, Germany was parted into East and West. The West being democratic, the East being under a communistic leadership of the Sovjet Union. That is a gross oversimplification of history but I'm not here to lecture. Inside Eastern Germany, dissidents and queer folk were often snitched on, to the Staatssicherheits ("Stasi"), and quietly spirited away to never be seen again. Again, a gross oversimplification as many more things happened, but for me personally, or rather my extended family, this was their fate. 

My grandfathers side of the family tried to flee, we called it Voting With Their Feet, and grandpa made it over the border into West Germany, where I was born in 1988, but the rest were caught. After Unification and a few decades passed, my grandpa took his time to look his family up. The documents lasted until their departure near Poland, towards a Gulag somewhere near Tallin. They were never mentioned again.

In Eastern Germany, you could never be sure who would snitch to the Stasi, you had to keep quiet, you had to always be careful of the ever watchful eyes of the Communist Party. My grandpa didn't talk about it much, he never talked about his family, I pierced all of this together from copies of relevant documents after his death, his notes, and my grandma who didn't feel it was "proper" to discuss the various neighbors, co-workers, and family members mentioned in the document as possible, likely, and factual sources of information about my families attempt to vote with their feet.

Back to my work education program.

For the past year I have driven this route, passing from West to East over the border, my work thinks, or rather expects, that I drive there on monday, spend the week, and drive back fridays. My time sheet and driving cost comp will attest to those times. What I really do is decide every day if I want to see my cats and sleep in my own bed or not. So quite often, I drove back in the middle of the week, sometimes 2-3 times a week if the school let out early.

Sometimes though, I am still quite awake at night, and I decide to drive back in the dead of night, get there at 3am, put myself in the hotel bed and wake up for school. And these drives, ranging in between 10pm and 5am, are the cause for this post. 

I have or rather had a few very odd occurances and some are frankly too fantastical not to come from sleep deprivation and have made me pull over, take a short 15 minute nap, before deciding to drive on. I'll just touch on the most explainable though, for the sake of my own sanity:

About 120km into the drive, I come across a brown sign that says "It was at this point that Germany was seperated until 1989" or something to that effect. It always spooks me a little, I'm not superstitious, though my experiences so far on my 4th of 14 drives may convince me otherwise, but there is a definite feeling of seperation between what used to be two countries. The road doesn't help, seemingly switching from asphalt to whatever there was before asphalt, bumpy, uneven, the road markings seem to vanish. It's fine in the day time when you can see the road, but at night and with my bad eyes, it's quite a terrifying switch.

When you look to the left and right after passing the sign, you can't see anything at night, just a large, empty stretch. As if the fields and villages in the distance are parted by big line. I always hurry at this part, taking the curves at frankly stupid speeds and it always makes me brake way too hard when I enter the first village, the village sign usually hitting me out of nowhere. Something about civilization, the old gaunty yellow street lighting and the old fashioned houses with lights on calms me down immensely.

The story I want to share happens after the third village that I have to pass, it's an empty stretch of road connecting to the next village, it's straight as an arrow before suddenly curving, then straight as an arrow again, repeat ad infinitum. I always forget to count how many curves have to pass before I reach the second to last village to my destination, but it always feels like a different amount, which obviously can't be true.

It's on this stretch of the road where a bunch of large windmills stand, silently rotating their giant blades and churning out sustainable energy for the region. Dozens, if not hundreds of them in a seemingly random pattern, dictated by whoever let the company place them on their land. They honestly make me happy, which shouldn't be since they dirty my electric grid, are a pain to maintain, quite expensive and all in all terrible. But so is every other power station so, swings and roundabouts I suppose.

The windmills follow me for quite a while, I get quite close to a couple of them on my drive.   
At night, they scare me.

At night, there is no solace in the man made gigantic structures, they are hidden in a darkness that is untainted by the light of man. No villages, no street lights, the moonlight is far too weak to illuminate them so far away from the street. You would think it's the few strays that are close to the road, their large blades suddenly hitting moonlight or my headlamps, that would scare me. They are not. It's the ones that are far away that make me press the accelerator.

There is a red light on top of the windmills, safety precautions for aviation, the blink on around once every second, and I wish to god they were in unison, but they are not. But every few minutes - they sync up and I'm hit by a powerful, disgusting wave of nausea. 

Big, red eyes suddenly look at me, the small, far away lights seem to flood my car, as if giant red eyes look at me with scorn, hate, curiousity, suspicion. I drive, faster, taking the bends at reckless speeds, once I'm perpendicular to the most filled row of red dots they align one last time and blare into my brain but I know I'm out, half a km further and the lights are not aligned anymore, not in sync, and behind me.

I drove back that same day, but while the sun was out. The quiet turning of the blades churn wind into energy, I want to burn them all down. 

Don't really know where I am going with this, or why I am writing it down, it's very hard to describe the feelings of the giants eyes on me, in me, maybe I just need to write it down. I know deep in my brain that it's just lights, they are just on a timer, the timer and the light have tolerances, sometimes they sync up, I know all this but without fail, at that turn, on the mile marker that puts me in the row - I am scared.
