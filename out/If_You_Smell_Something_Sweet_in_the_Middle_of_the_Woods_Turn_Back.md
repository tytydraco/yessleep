There’s a legend that if you’re walking in the woods late at night and you smell something sweet, don’t acknowledge it. Do not acknowledge any sudden sweet smell and do not interact with any stranger you meet, regardless of what they say or do.  If you do, you’ll be kidnapped by the *orang bunian*, a creature similar to the fae in the West. They lure you into the world of the *bunian* and once in, you will never be able to leave unless they allow you to and by then, you’ll be a shell of your former self…

My brother and I used to be naughty children. We never liked listening to our elders, and the same could be said about our friends. We ignored warnings and advice, running around the *kampung* disturbing the other residents, who would curse at us and threaten a beating, though mostly half-jokingly. A few times we were caught by an uncle who was in a terrible mood and we’d get flogged, but it still didn’t deter us from doing the same thing again the next day.

One day, while going down one of our usual paths, we found a new path on the side of the road, into a plot of rubber trees. This was a road we had taken multiple times before, so finding a new path all of a sudden excited us. The dirt path looked slightly used, and since we knew the owner of the plot of land and he was usually friendly with us, we decided to try exploring the area. Who knows, maybe we would find *harta Qarun* and become rich enough to leave the *kampung*, we joked with each other. One friend however, a skinny twig of a boy, decided he wanted none of it. Perhaps he had felt something strange about the place, or perhaps because it was almost *maghrib* time, but he decided to wait nearby while we went in. After a barrage of insults, calling him a coward, a wuss, and other unpleasant things, the four of us, including my brother and I, decided to go in, at least for a bit before heading back from *maghrib*.

The first thing we noticed was that as we went deeper, the usual smell of rubber was becoming weaker. Having helped with harvesting rubber a few times, we had naturally grown used to the awful smell, so it was natural for us not to be too disgusted by it, but here, it almost seemed like it was being neutralized by something sweet. After what felt like just 10 minutes of walking, the smell of rubber seemed to have completely vanished, despite our surrounding still being composed of healthy rubber trees. Instead, a sweet rosy smell had taken its place. “Do you guys smell this too?” “Yeah, it’s…weird. There’s no smell of rubber here.” “Maybe *Tok Bah* did something to his trees? I heard he’s super rich.” Being young and dumb as we were, we did not think that there was anything wrong. We had ignored all the stories our parents and grandparents had told us so far, so the strange, sweet smell did not unnerve us and instead, just made us curious on what *Tok Bah*, the owner of this plot of land may have done to his rubber trees to make them smell better. So we continued walking, checking a tree every once in a while to see if maybe the smell was from there.

A few minutes later, my brother suddenly stopped. “There seems to be some people there. Maybe that’s where the sweet smell is coming from?” Looking to where my brother had pointed towards, we saw that there was a stream nearby, and on the opposite side were a few strangely dressed people eating. “Did *Tok Bah have a family*? I thought he lived alone?” One of my friends asked. “Maybe they’re relatives? We might as well go say hi.” Answered my brother. As we approached the stream, the smell got stronger, confirming to us that it was coming from the picnic opposite of the stream. “Assalamualaikum.” Shouted my brother to the group of people on the opposite side. “Waalaikumussalam. Come on over and join us. No need to be shy.” Replied one of them who was facing directly towards us. She looked about as old as my sister who was in her 20s, with fair skin. Her face was pale and smooth, and her voice was soft and alluring. Yet, I could not really make out anything else from her face. There was something rather unnerving about it. Meanwhile, the rest of their group continued to eat as if we did not exist. “Maybe we should go back. It’s almost maghrib.” I whispered to my brother and our friends. “Come and eat Luqman, we even have *pekasam* and *sup daging*.” The fair lady continued calling to my brother, sweetly. “Wait, we didn’t introduce ourselves did we?” “They probably know us from mom or *Tok*. You guys go back if you want.” And with that, my older brother started crossing the stream. “Wait!” I cried out, trying to stop him. Suddenly, the *maghrib azan* rang just as my brother crossed the stream and then…nothing. My brother and the group on the other side vanished and so did the sweet rosy smell, replaced by rubber trees.

I don’t remember what happened after that or how we got back out. Hadi, the friend that stayed out from the woods told us we ran out of the woods suddenly, looking terrified and drenched in sweat. We didn’t stop even when he called out to us, only stopping when the *kampung ustaz* stopped us and we told him what had happened. For 30 days the whole *kampung* searched for my brother, going deep into *Tok Bah’s kebun* but found nothing. The path we went through also mysteriously disappeared, with no trace of it ever being there and *Tok Bah* swore there was no stream anywhere in his *kebun*. Did we imagine the trail or had we been tricked by the *bunian*? I guess I'll never know.
