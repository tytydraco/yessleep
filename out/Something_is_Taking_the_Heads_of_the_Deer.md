**Entry 1:**

Something odd has been happening to the deer. Someone or some individuals have been taking their heads. You would think they’re only taking prize bucks to mount on their walls, not even caring about harvesting the meat. But the thing is, they’re not just killing large bucks, they’re killing younger males, and even doe. I don’t entirely know the reason or motivations for this, but it’s been off putting. I’m beginning to think this isn’t the work of any normal animal but maybe of some sick and twisted person.

First let me rewind to when this began.

I live a quiet life in the northern Great Lakes region; I love this place more than anywhere else on Earth. I live fairly secluded in my cozy cabin in the middle of the woods; the only way to get to it is on a one-track dirt trail about a mile in length, also about a mile away from my nearest neighbor. I work for my state’s government in a regional office about a 45-minute commute from my home – I know, this gets especially rough during the winter.

It’s now November here, which means it’s hunting season, and hunting coincides with mating season for deer. You’ll find bucks roaming around looking for a mate, this makes them especially susceptible to becoming roadkill, I’ve hit and killed many a deer in my time living in the woods, it’s inescapable sometimes and there’s nothing you can do when you’re charging 60 miles an hour and a buck appears out of nowhere from a dense thicket. There are usually at least five dead deer I pass by on my way to and from work each day.

It began about 3 weeks ago; I was just beginning my drive home from work (I mainly drive through 2 lane country roads surrounded by dense forest) and I noticed a deer carcass on the side of the road, not an unusual occurrence at all with living in the deep north woods. The striking thing about it however, was that its head was severed and missing. Now this isn’t entirely unheard of; people hitting a nice sized buck and taking the head as a trophy mount. It caught me off guard for a moment before resuming whatever I was listening to on my way home.

2 or 3 days later, I can’t entirely remember, I noticed another deer carcass with its head missing again. This day it was closer to my house; I found it a bit odd to see yet another headless deer but shrugged it off as there being many large bucks in the area. Over the next week I noticed more and more deer carcasses, each with its head severed, nearing closer to where I live. Each time, the day after seeing the corpse the headless deer it is gone only for me to spot a new deer corpse anywhere from a few hundred feet to several miles ahead. Before anyone asks, I know that it is not the same deer just getting dragged down the road by someone or some animal, the deer range in size and color. Because I only passed the carcasses, I never thoroughly examined them, so I’ve just assumed that they’ve all been bucks. I’m not so sure anymore.

Because I work for the state government, I speak with a lot of other from various other departments and organizations. Yesterday, I got to talking with a manager in the Department of Natural Resources, his name is Greg, and I began asking him about what I’ve been seeing for the past week.

“The amount of car collisions with deer has been especially bad this year. We’ve seen a sharp decline in hunters over the years, and with no major natural predators for the deer, they’ve been becoming a problem.” Greg explained to me.

“Have you heard many reports of any drivers taking the heads of these bucks as trophies to mount?” I asked

“It happens every once in a while, usually someone not from around here calls them in super concerned about a mutilated deer by the side of road. But so far this season, at least in our region, we’ve got maybe a small handful, nothing noteworthy though.”

“I’ve seen a different deer carcass with its head missing almost everyday for the past week. Each time it’s a little ahead of the last one.” I began saying breathlessly.

“Hmmm I haven’t heard anything about it. Maybe when you see the next one make a call to the department’s help line and we can keep track of it.”

“Thanks a lot, I’ll be sure to do that, it’s been weirding me out.”

My drive home last night began as uneventful as usual, the only unusual aspect was I spotted not a single living deer even by the tree line. It’s rare not to see a living deer walking around by the road at this time of the year. About 30 minutes into my ride home, I had just passed by a car oncoming, I turned my brights off so as not to blind the other driver and they did the same. After the driver passed I had just turned my brights back on just in time to see a large buck in the middle of the road. I slammed on the breaks, skidding my truck to a stop only a few feet in front of the buck. The deer just stood there just staring at me with its big round black eyes, no sign of any fear or urgency. Observing the deer, I noticed it had a jagged scar running along its hindquarters. After a few moments of stillness, I finally honked my horn, startling it into action. It darted across the next lane and into the vast darkness of the woods.

This thoroughly had me on edge with my adrenaline pumping. Luckily though, the rest of my drive was uneventful. There wasn’t even a deer carcass to greet me on the side of the road. In all honesty I didn’t dwell on that fact too much as I was busy focusing on not hitting a living deer since my scare just a few minutes previously.

Pulling into my driveway, about 20 feet passed the tree line, my approaching headlights illuminated a pair of glowing eyes. Like anyone normal person upon seeing the glow of eyes in the woods at night I was briefly startled. But upon further approach near my house, my headlights illuminated the head of a buck peering up at me from the underbrush. It was a nice 8 point buck; if I was much of a hunter, I would’ve pulled my rifle out of my truck and shot it but I don’t have much of an interest in killing and harvesting animals.

Something about it was a bit odd though.

Although I could only see the buck from the neck onward, it appeared a lot shorter than the size of a usual 8-point buck. Maybe it was just a short deer or was bending its knees. I don’t know, I’m not a wildlife biologist.

The deer didn’t move a muscle; it just continued to stare at me. I just assumed it chose fright instead of flight. *This dumbass is gonna get himself killed if he does this in front of a hunter,* I thought to myself as I briskly walked into my house.

 

**Entry 2:**

Fast forward to this morning; I was leaving my house at about 6:30 am in the pitch dark and walking the 20 feet to my car. I suddenly kicked something soft, because I was in a hurry I was walking somewhat fast. This led me to trip over whatever I kicked, falling face first into the ground next to it. Scrambling onto my knees to grab my phone I shone my flashlight on what I tripped over.

It was a deer. Its head missing. Despite the freezing weather, I immediately broke out into a dreadful sweat, my hands became clammy as I shined my flashlight on that awful sight in front of me.

As I shone my flashlight from its stump where the head used to be to the back of the body, I noticed something familiar. It had the exact same scar as the deer I almost hit on the road last night. The one that was totally alive and moving when I saw it nearly 30 miles away from my house.

Bringing my flashlight back to the stump where a head once had been on a living deer, I noticed that the wound was not consistent with blade marks. The wound looked as if the flesh had been torn and the brain stem had been snapped off the spine which was protruding out of its neck.

Suddenly I heard a twig snap off in the tree line.

I didn’t even bother turning around and seeing the cause of that noise. I just made a mad dash back to my house.

Once safely back in my house I took a moment to catch my breath and gather my wits before I built up enough courage to turn on my outside lights to illuminate my yard. When I finally looked into my yard the deer was gone.

“What?” I gasped audibly, trying to make sense of everything.

There was no way my mind played a trick on me seeing that deer in my yard. I came in contact with it and clearly felt that it was the soft torso of an animal.

W*as that the same deer?* I asked myself. The scar looked like the exact one I noticed last night on the deer I nearly hit. Regardless, I’ve come to the conclusion that someone or something is targeting me, killing deer, removing their heads, and placing the carcasses where they know I will see them. And now they know where I live. For all I know they could have been watching me since they placed the deer in my yard. They may still be watching my house as I sit on my kitchen floor typing this with all the lights off.

I’ve decided I’m going to go outside and see if I can find anything. I know this may be a stupid idea, but the sun is peaking out, and I will bring one of my guns with me.

I will update you guys again as soon as I can, and if I don’t, well I guess you can figure something happened to me. No one will hear me scream if something goes wrong, but I can’t sit idly by while someone or *something* stalks me in my home.

 

 

**Entry 3:**          

I think I am losing my mind. It’s now midday, I haven’t gone to work, I’ve just been pacing around my house and periodically looking out my windows for any sign of movement.

Flash back to this morning to the whole deer in my yard fiasco. After finally mustering up enough courage to exit my front door, I cautiously stepped into the unknown. I had my handgun I keep in a drawer and a big flashlight with me although it was continuing to get brighter outside by the minute. As I scanned my yard and the surrounding woods there was nothing in my yard or around it. The deer carcass had been removed or taken, *how could this happen?* I thought to myself.

I slowly made my way to the fateful spot where I tripped over the deer. On approaching it, I could easily see where the deer had lain; the patchy native grass had a clear spot where the grass had been pushed into the damp, cold soil. And as you may guess, it was about the size of the deer.

What’s leaving me scratching my head as I pace around my house and taking breaks to type this out; is the fact that there are no sets of tracks besides mine from when I walked into the deer and subsequently toppled over it. No tracks coming from the woods in any direction. There is no indication of anything walking up to place the deer there or to take it away. I have a bit of an eye for tracking as I grew up in the great north woods, every season me, my dad, and my grandfather would be out deer hunting. They imparted a thing or two about tracking various game to me; I got pretty good at it too. Mainly because I was forced to go out with them, I never particularly enjoyed the process of hunting or the act of killing an animal. I’m more of a hike through nature and read at a scenic spot type of guy.

*Could something have flown to place the deer in my yard only to retrieve it later?*

Or

*Maybe someone is fucking with me and used a drone to place and retrieve that deer from my yard.* But I didn’t hear anything when the deer was taken back.

I sound like some crazy conspiracy theorist that thinks he’s being gang stalked by the government. I just don’t know what to think. The most logical explanation is that I’m just hallucinating or perceiving my reality wrong. It’s a plausible explanation.

I think I’m going to go spend the weekend at my parents who now live in a city about an hour south of me.

I’m going to get going but I’ll update you all if anything else happens. I’m hoping this is just a localized phenomenon and that whatever it is notices I’m gone and bothers someone else.
