The girl was seventeen years old when they found her, laid out like a broken offering on the edge of the swamp. Her name was Abigail "Abby" Thorne, daughter of a single mother, last seen leaving her part-time job at Waylon’s Gas & Grocery two nights before.

The way she was found—stripped to the bone in some places, untouched in others, hands placed neatly over her chest like she had been posed—made it clear this was something different. Not just a murder. A message.

I arrived in St. Mercier, Louisiana, on a gray October morning, driving down a two-lane road flanked by bald cypress trees, the kind that loom like twisted sentinels over the waterlogged earth. The town sat near the edge of the Atchafalaya Basin, where the land felt more like forgotten swamp than civilization. I passed abandoned sugar mills, their rusted skeletons still standing against the sky, and trailer homes with Virgin Mary statues out front, half-sunk into the ground from years of flooding.

St. Mercier wasn’t much. A gas station, a church, a handful of businesses clinging to the edges of Main Street, and beyond that—a sprawl of farmland and dense, unnavigable marshes. The kind of place where people didn’t talk to strangers and the law was more of a suggestion than a rule.

Sheriff Earl Duvall, a man in his sixties with the kind of face carved by cigarettes and bad sleep, met me at the town's only diner. He pushed a black-and-white crime scene photo across the table—Abby Thorne, arms crossed over her bare chest, her eyes gone.

"The crows?" I asked.

He shook his head. "No crows touched her. No gators either. We found her like that." He tapped the photo. "The eyes weren’t taken by animals, Detective. They were scooped out. And whoever did it, they left her that way on purpose."

I had seen plenty of dead bodies in my time, but something about this one felt different.

“Locals say she broke the rules,” Duvall muttered, stirring his coffee absently.

I frowned. “Rules?”

He exhaled heavily, leaning back in his chair. “Every town’s got superstitions. This one just takes ‘em a little more seriously.”

Before I could press him, the waitress—a gaunt woman with deep-set eyes who looked like she hadn't smiled in a decade—came by to refill our coffee. She didn’t look at me as she poured, but her hand trembled slightly.

“You’re investigating the girl, ain’t you?” she muttered, voice barely above a whisper.

I nodded.

She hesitated, then leaned in slightly.

“You should go back to Baton Rouge, detective. This town don’t like it when outsiders start asking questions.”

I glanced at Duvall, but the sheriff was suddenly real interested in his plate of eggs.

Something was wrong here.

The girl was dead. The town had rules. And whatever they were, I had the sinking feeling that Abby Thorne had broken one.

The road leading to Abigail Thorne’s crime scene was barely a road at all—just a stretch of packed dirt and gravel, winding through dense cypress trees, the branches so thick overhead they swallowed most of the daylight. Spanish moss hung like tattered curtains, swaying lazily in the humid breeze. The air smelled of wet earth and something else—something sour.



Sheriff Duvall drove in silence, his hands gripping the wheel like he was bracing for something. I watched the trees pass by, but I wasn’t just looking at them. I was feeling them.

Something about this place was off.

The deeper we drove, the heavier the air felt. The silence wasn’t just quiet—it was waiting.

We finally stopped near an overgrown clearing, just a few yards away from the edge of an abandoned sugarcane field. A single stretch of yellow crime scene tape fluttered uselessly in the breeze.

“She was found here?” I asked.

Duvall nodded but didn’t move to get out.

I stepped out of the car first. The heat was thick, suffocating, and the smell of stagnant water clung to my skin. The grass was flattened, the soil still dark where the girl’s body had been found.

No footprints. No drag marks.

Just like someone had placed her there.

Duvall climbed out, clearing his throat. “Something I oughta tell you, Detective,” he muttered.

I looked up.

“Folks in this town… they got ways of thinking. Ways that ain’t always modern.”

I studied his face. “Meaning?”

He exhaled, then reached into his pocket, pulling out a small, folded piece of paper. It was old, stained in places, like it had been passed through too many hands.

I took it. Unfolded it.



Inside were rules :

**The Laws of St. Mercier (To Be Followed Without Question) :**

1. **If you find a door in the woods, do not open it. No one builds doors without walls.**
2. **Never bring back anything taken from the water. Some things are meant to stay drowned.**
3. **If you hear your name whispered from the cane fields, do not answer. It is not calling you—it is remembering you.**
4. **On the first Sunday of every month, every house must leave an offering on the porch before midnight. It does not matter if you believe. It matters that it believes.**
5. **There is a house at the end of Red Creek Road. No one lives there. No one ever has. If a candle burns in the window, do not look at it. If the door is open, do not go inside.**
6. **If you wake up to the sound of someone moving in your home, do not search for them. They have already seen you.**
7. **The missing do not return. If you see them again, they are not yours anymore.**



A cold sensation crept over my skin.

I looked up at Duvall, half-expecting a smirk. Some kind of joke. But he just stood there, staring at me like he was waiting for me to understand.

“What does this have to do with Abby?” I asked.

He nodded toward the edge of the clearing.

Beyond the tall grass, past the trees, the sugarcane field stretched out like an ocean of green. I followed his gaze until I saw it—something small, half-hidden in the dirt.

I walked closer, crouched down.

It was a door.

Old. Wooden. Covered in faded carvings.

And half-buried in the ground.

A door without walls.

I turned back to Duvall. “Did she open it?”

His face was pale, his jaw tight. He didn’t answer.



But I already knew.

Abigail Thorne opened the door.

And something came through.

I took photos of the door, brushing away dirt to get a better look at the carvings. They weren’t just random scratches—they were symbols. Strange, looping marks that almost looked like letters, but not in any language I knew. The wood was warped, swollen with time, and there was no handle.

It didn’t belong here.

I turned back to Sheriff Duvall, who stood stiffly near the car, watching me like he didn’t want to get any closer.

“This was here before Abby died?” I asked.

Duvall hesitated, then gave a slight nod. “Far as I know.”

“You didn’t think to mention it before?”

Another pause. Then, quietly—“I didn’t want to.”

I didn’t push him. Not yet.

Instead, I took one last look at the door before we left.

The thought stayed with me as we drove back toward town, the road weaving through miles of flat, open land, past rotting barns and crumbling houses, places long abandoned but still standing like silent watchers.

I needed to know more about Abigail Thorne.

Waylon’s Gas & Grocery - Last Place She Was Seen Alive

Waylon’s sat at the edge of town, a small, dusty gas station with a general store attached, the kind of place where the shelves carried equal parts beer, motor oil, and hunting knives. The windows were clouded with age, the walls lined with old yellowing posters for church raffles and missing dogs.

Inside, a thin, red-eyed girl at the register barely looked up when I walked in. Name tag: Katie.

I set my badge on the counter. “You were friends with Abby?”

She swallowed. “I worked with her.”

I nodded. “She came through here the night she disappeared?”

Katie fidgeted, glancing toward the back of the store. Like she was checking to see if we were alone.

I leaned in. “Listen, I’m not from here. I don’t care what stories people tell. I care about who killed your friend.”

She hesitated, then leaned forward, voice barely a whisper.

“She was scared.”

A chill ran through me.



“Scared of what?”



Katie’s fingers trembled as she traced an invisible shape on the counter.



“A week before she died,” she said, “Abby started saying she found something out near the cane fields. Said it wasn’t right. She kept asking people about it, but no one would answer her.”



I could already guess what it was.



“The door.”



Katie flinched at the word. “She wanted to know what was behind it.”



I stared at her, waiting.



She swallowed hard. “Then she started talking about opening it.”



Something heavy settled in my gut.



“What happened next?”



Katie’s gaze darted toward the door, like she was afraid someone would walk in. “Three nights before she went missing, she told me she… she had a dream.”



I frowned. “What kind of dream?”



Katie licked her lips. Her voice dropped to barely a whisper.



“She saw something coming out of it.”



I felt a sharp prickle of unease at the back of my neck.



“And then?”



Katie’s breath was shaky. “She said when she woke up… there was dirt in her bed. Under her fingernails. In her mouth. Like she had already been there.”



She had opened it.



Whether she meant to or not.



I turned back toward the door. I needed to get out there again. Needed to see for myself.



Because whatever Abby had found…



It wasn’t done yet. 



The drive back to the crime scene felt different this time.



Before, I had looked at it like a detective—examining evidence, measuring possibilities. Now, I was looking at it like Abby must have.



Like something was waiting there.



I parked at the edge of the clearing, stepping out into the heavy, humid air. The trees swayed lazily in the breeze, the smell of damp soil and stagnant water thick in my lungs. The cane fields loomed just beyond the clearing, their green stalks rustling like something breathing.



Duvall wasn’t with me this time.



I preferred it that way.



I walked to the spot where Abby’s body had been found. The ground was still disturbed from where forensics had worked, but something else caught my attention.



Footprints.



Not hers. Bare. Large. Deep.



Someone had been here after the crime scene was processed.



Or something.



I crouched, running my fingers through the indentations. They were spaced too far apart. Too long. Like whoever—or whatever—had walked here wasn’t moving like a person.



A noise clicked in the trees behind me.



I stood up fast, heart hammering.



The forest was still.



But the air had changed.



Something was wrong.

I turned slowly, scanning the trees. The door was still there, half-buried in the ground, its carvings seeming darker now, deeper. A thin layer of dust had settled over it, except for one part—the center.

Where it had been touched.

I stepped toward it cautiously, my boots crunching over dry leaves. The closer I got, the heavier the air became. It wasn’t just the humidity—it was pressure.

Like the whole damn forest was holding its breath.

I crouched beside the door, reaching out. My fingers brushed the carvings—deep grooves, too precise for age to have worn them away. And then I saw something else.

Something small, wedged in the dirt near the edge of the door.

A fingernail.

I swallowed hard. It was chipped, torn at the edge, the tip stained dark. Dried blood.

Abby’s?

No.

The blood was fresh.

A crackle in the trees behind me.

I spun, hand reaching for my gun. The cane fields stretched out before me, silent and swaying. But something had moved.

The sugarcane stalks on the edge were bent outward.



Like something had walked through.



And then I heard it.



A sound I didn’t want to believe.



A slow exhale. Wet. Ragged.



Something was in the field. Watching.



My grip on my gun tightened. I took a slow step back toward my car, keeping my eyes locked on the broken stalks.



A shadow shifted.



Tall. Thin. Not quite right.



And then, just as I took another step—



The cane moved.



Something stepped back into the field.



I stood there, heart hammering in my chest, my body screaming at me to move. But I didn’t. I just listened as the rustling faded.



And then the forest was still again.



Like nothing had ever been there.



But I knew better.



Something had stepped through.



And it hadn’t gone back.



I didn’t go straight back to the station.



Instead, I drove through town, past the empty streets and shuttered businesses, past the sagging porches where old men sat in silence, staring at nothing. The kind of town where people lived close together but still felt alone.



Waylon’s Gas & Grocery was open, but I didn’t stop. Katie had told me everything she could.



I needed someone who wasn’t afraid to lie to me.



So I went to the church.



St. Mercier Parish, a crumbling brick building with peeling white paint and stained-glass windows that had darkened with age, sat just beyond the center of town. The cemetery beside it stretched toward the bayou, half-flooded, tombstones leaning as if sinking into the marsh.



Father Etienne Rousseau had been the town’s priest for nearly forty years. A man who had watched generations come and go, burying more people than he baptized.



When I found him, he was sitting on a wooden bench beneath the massive oak tree behind the church, rolling a cigarette with steady, wrinkled hands.



He didn’t look at me as I approached. “Afternoon, Detective.”



I sat beside him. “You heard what happened to Abigail Thorne.”



A slow nod. “Tragedy.”



I studied his face. “You don’t seem surprised.”



Another pause. Then, in a voice dry as dust—“I am too old for surprises.”



I pulled the folded piece of paper from my pocket, the one with the town’s rules, and smoothed it out between us on the bench. His eyes flickered toward it, just once, before he looked away.



“Someone gave me this,” I said. “Abby broke one, didn’t she?”



Rousseau took a slow drag of his cigarette. “It does not matter what she did,” he said simply. “Only what was done to her.”



“What does the door lead to?” I asked.



Rousseau sighed, tapping ash onto the ground. “It does not lead anywhere,” he murmured. “It lets something out.”



I exhaled sharply. “What did she let out?”



The old priest turned to me then, and there was something deep and tired in his gaze.



“She did not let it out,” he said. “She just reminded it that it was here.”



A heavy silence settled between us.



Finally, I folded the paper again, slipping it back into my pocket.



“Who put the door there?” I asked.



Father Rousseau didn’t answer right away. Instead, he gestured toward the flooded graveyard beside the church.



“You see the water creeping up?” he asked. “Every year, it rises a little more. Bury the dead deep as you want—eventually, the swamp pulls them back.”



I frowned. “What does that have to do with anything?”



His eyes darkened.



“The door was put there to cover something up. But the ground shifts, the years pass, and things that were buried don’t always stay that way.”



The hair on the back of my neck stood up.



I stood, adjusting my belt, ready to leave, but before I could step away, Rousseau grabbed my wrist.



His grip was thin, but strong.



“Do not look for it at night,” he whispered. “If you hear it moving, you didn’t hear anything. If you feel it watching you, you are wrong.”



His fingers tightened.



“And if you wake up with dirt in your mouth—leave St. Mercier.”



I pulled away, heart pounding.



I left without another word.



The sun was starting to set, and as I got into my car, I realized something.



For the first time since I arrived in St. Mercier…



I did not want to be here after dark.



I didn’t go back to the station.

I didn’t go back to the crime scene.



I drove to the motel on the outskirts of town, the kind of place that smelled like mildew and bad decisions, where the neon “VACANCY” sign flickered weakly in the humid night.



Room 6A. It wasn’t much. A bed, a chipped wooden desk, and a bathroom with a mirror that had seen too many faces. I bolted the door behind me, tossed my keys on the table, and collapsed onto the mattress.



The day weighed on me like a second skin.



The crime scene. The footprints. The door in the woods.



Father Rousseau’s warning.



“If you wake up with dirt in your mouth—leave St. Mercier.”



I ran a hand over my face. I needed a drink. I needed to think.



Instead, I stared at the ceiling, listening to the motel hum with its own strange life. The buzzing of the overhead light. The distant chirp of cicadas outside. The hollow quiet of a town that didn’t want me here.



Somewhere around 2 AM, I must have dozed off.



I woke up with the taste of dirt on my tongue.



My eyes snapped open.



For a long second, I just lay there, heartbeat hammering in my ears. The motel room was dark, but something felt wrong.



My mouth was dry. Gritty.



I sat up slowly, swallowing hard. The taste was unmistakable.



Soil.



I reached up, touching my lips, then ran my fingers over my tongue. I spat onto my palm.



Dark flecks of earth.



The motel was locked. No windows open. No way I could have brought it in.



I swung my legs over the side of the bed, every muscle tense. The old wooden floor was cold under my feet. I scanned the room, pulse pounding.



Everything looked the same. The chair, the desk, the crumpled sheets.



Then I saw it.



Something was wrong with the door.



I stood slowly, moving toward it, hands clenched into fists. The doorknob was still bolted, but…



The wood was marked.



A black handprint, smeared across the center of the door.



Not a full hand. Just four long fingers.



Like someone had pressed against the wood from the outside.



But that wasn’t what made my breath catch in my throat.



The fingers were too long.



I took a slow step back, heart hammering. The air in the motel room felt thick, too still.



Something had been here.



Something had touched my door.



And as I stood there, staring at the mark, another realization crept over me, curling like a cold hand around my throat.



The dirt in my mouth.



The last thing Abby Thorne told her friend before she died.



“I woke up with dirt in my bed. Under my fingernails. In my mouth.”



She had opened the door.



And now it knew me, too.



By the time the sun rose, I had already packed my bag.



I hadn’t slept.



I sat on the edge of the motel bed, watching the light creep through the thin curtains, painting the room in muted gold. The black handprint was still on the door. The dirt in my mouth still clung to my teeth.



I needed answers.



So I drove.



Sheriff Duvall’s office was a small, sun-bleached building at the center of town, just a few doors down from a barber shop that had long since given up on customers and a post office that only opened three days a week.



I pushed through the door.



Duvall looked up from his desk, his eyes tired, bloodshot.



“You look like hell, Detective.”



I tossed a photo of my motel door onto his desk—the black handprint clear as day.



His face didn’t change.



“I want to know who did this.”



He leaned back in his chair, rubbing his jaw. “Who says it was done by someone?”



I exhaled sharply. “You trying to tell me it just appeared on its own?”



Duvall said nothing.



I sat down, voice low. “This isn’t just a murder, is it?”



He shifted, like he was fighting himself. Then, finally—“You think this is the first time something like this happened?”



My fingers curled into fists. “How many?”



Duvall’s jaw tightened. “More than I care to count.”



I leaned in. “Abby didn’t just break the rules, Sheriff. She uncovered something. Something you all know is real.”



His eyes darkened. “And what exactly do you think you’re gonna do with that information?”



I didn’t have an answer.



Because the truth was, I didn’t know what the hell I was chasing anymore.



I stood up. “I’m going back to the door.”



Duvall’s face hardened. “No, you’re not.”



Something cold passed between us.



Then I heard it.



A car pulling up outside. Then another.



I turned. Through the window, I saw two trucks parked in front of the station. Three men climbed out—locals.



They weren’t here for small talk.



I looked back at Duvall. He sighed, rubbing his temples.



“This ain’t personal, Detective,” he muttered. “But you don’t belong here.”



I knew that look.



I had seen it in other places, in other cases. The look of a man who wasn’t in charge of his own town anymore.



I glanced back at the men outside. They weren’t holding weapons, but they didn’t need to. This was a warning.



A final one.



I grabbed my badge off his desk and walked to the door.



As I passed Duvall, he spoke one last time.



“Go home.”



I stepped outside.



The men didn’t move, but their eyes followed me. Unblinking. Unfriendly.



I got in my car, turned the key.



And I drove.



Not out of town.



Not to the motel.



Back to the woods.



Back to the door.



Because whatever they were trying to hide…



I needed to see it for myself.



The drive back to the woods felt unending.



The road was the same—narrow, cracked, framed by sagging trees heavy with moss—but the air had changed, like it was pressing against the car, pushing me back.



I didn’t turn around.



The town had made their threat clear. They wanted me gone.

But I had to see.

I pulled off onto the dirt path, killing my headlights as I rolled to a stop. The forest stretched out before me, dark and endless. The cane fields rustled in the breeze, whispering against themselves.

The sun had almost set.

And I had made the mistake of coming alone.

I grabbed my flashlight and stepped out, boots sinking into the soft, damp earth. Every step toward the clearing felt like pushing against a current, like the very ground was trying to drag me back.

I reached the tree line.

The door was still there.

Half-buried in the dirt, its carvings darker now in the fading light. The ground around it was disturbed.

Not just from me.

Something had been here again.

A thin trail of footprints, leading from the door back into the cane fields. Deep. Uneven. Like someone had crawled their way out.

The back of my neck prickled. I turned slowly, scanning the stalks. The light from my flashlight caught nothing but the endless rows of green.

But I wasn’t alone.

I could feel it.

I swallowed hard and crouched by the door, running my fingers over the carvings. The wood was warm. Like it had been touched recently.

Or opened.

A noise clicked behind me.

I stood up fast, turning toward the field.

The stalks shifted.

Not the wind. Not an animal. Something tall. Moving.

I lifted the flashlight. “Who’s there?”

The wind picked up. The cane groaned.

Then I saw it.

Not a person.

Not an animal.

Something wrong.



It stood just beyond the first row of cane, tall and thin, its arms too long, its head tilted slightly—like it was listening.

I couldn’t see its face.

Or maybe it didn’t have one.

My breath hitched. My body screamed at me to run, to move—but I couldn’t.

Because it was already moving toward me.

Like it knew I wouldn’t leave.

Like it had been waiting for me.

My legs unlocked. I stumbled backward, nearly tripping over the door. The thing stopped.

Then it did something worse.

It lowered itself.

Not like a person crouching. More like a puppet whose strings had been cut. Its limbs bent wrong, folding in on themselves.

And then—it reached out.

Its fingers—too many fingers—dragged through the dirt toward the door.

A sharp crack sounded in the distance. A gunshot.

The thing jerked upright.

Another shot. This time closer.

I turned, heart hammering—Duvall was standing at the tree line, shotgun raised.

“Move, goddammit!” he shouted.

I didn’t hesitate. I ran.

The thing in the cane didn’t follow.

It just stood there, watching.

Watching like it knew something I didn’t.

And as I ran back toward my car, the last thing I saw was its hand still resting on the door.

Like it was waiting for someone else to open it.

I left St. Mercier the next morning.

Duvall never said a word about what he saw. Neither did I. We just sat in his truck as the sun rose, drinking bad coffee and listening to the swamp breathe.

It was understood—I wasn’t staying.

They let me leave.



I drove past the abandoned sugar mills, past the houses sinking into the mud, past the town that had decided long ago that some things were better left buried.

But that night, at a cheap motel an hour outside Baton Rouge, I woke up with dirt in my mouth.

I sat up fast, heart hammering, spitting into my hands. Dark flecks of soil. Under my fingernails. In my teeth.

The sheets were clean. The floor untouched. But I knew.

I knew it hadn’t let me go.

For a long time, I just sat there, breathing.

Then I checked the door.

Locked. Bolted.

But that wasn’t what made me stop.

On the wood, just below the handle—

A black handprint.

The same mark from my motel door in St. Mercier.

Only this time, there was something different.

A smudge near the fingertips. Like whoever—or whatever—had left it had pressed harder.

Like it was getting closer.



I stood there, my body cold despite the thick Louisiana heat, staring at the mark.

And I realized something.

I never saw Abby’s body up close. I saw photos, reports, witness statements.

But not her.

Not what was left.

I thought about what Father Rousseau said.

“The missing do not return. If you see them again, they are not yours anymore.”

Abigail Thorne had been found in the clearing.

But had it really been her?

Or had something else crawled through that door wearing her name?



I swallowed hard.

Outside, the motel parking lot was quiet.

But I didn’t open the door.

Because I had the terrible, sinking feeling that if I did…

Something would be waiting for me.

Something that had been watching since I left.

Something that wasn’t finished yet.

And this time—

It might not let me go.
