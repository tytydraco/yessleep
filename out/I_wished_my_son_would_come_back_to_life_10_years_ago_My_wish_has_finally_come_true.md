My name is Christopher, and I had a son called Lucas. Here’s something I have to share right now. I don’t think I have a lot of time left.

He was just like any other kid, sweet, vibrant and full of energy. He was basically the heart and soul of the family. He loved playing hide and seek. “Daddy, can we please play hide and seek in the garden?” he often asked. Also, he absolutely LOVED to be the seeker. “Where are you, papa?” he usually said, giggling. Everything was perfect.

That did not last long.

When Lucas was 8, he was somehow diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. The cause was (and still is) unknown. Grief was already drowning me when my wife died in a car crash. The pain was unbearable. Since then, I have lost touch with friends and family. I abandoned the house that my family used to live in, and I moved into a dingy, tiny apartment. I isolated myself and refused to let anyone visit me. I prayed every single day that my wife and my son would come back to life, even though I wasn’t a religious person. I wasn’t myself.

Until one day, I felt an intense desire to visit the place I used to call home. The place where Lucas should have grown up and become a successful man. I had decided to follow my senses and loaded my backpack with some essentials. When I arrived, I was rather surprised not to see the house in ruins. As I was getting nearer, I felt weird, as if I wasn’t supposed to be there. As if something was going to go horribly wrong. A feeling of unease was starting to grow in me.

Memories of my family were all coming back when I looked around the house. Lucas’ bedroom. Me and my wife’s bedroom. The dining room. The living room. It felt so nostalgic, and I actually wanted to stay there forever. It was so fucking nice to be back. Suddenly, I heard a low rumble. It kind of sounded like an animal growling. What happened next was completely unexpected. The house fucking COLLAPSED out of the blue. Before I passed out, I saw something supernatural. Everything turned into rubble, except for a particular room. A room that I had never seen before. And a small child was standing in it, his back facing me.

I was unconscious until a few hours ago, 10:46pm. I woke up in my dingy apartment, except something was off. Like, really off. The furniture isn’t exactly the same, there is an HP laptop on my desk, and a clock that indicates the time. I had never purchased a laptop before. Besides, it is completely pitch black outside. That isn’t normal as I lived in the city center. Also, I feel like this isn’t actually my apartment. I checked my location on the laptop, and it showed that I am actually indeed in my apartment. However, I am unconvinced. I tried to go to sleep, and I dreamt of something that’s REALLY FUCKING DISTURBING. It was my son, Lucas, except his features were completely distorted. His beautiful eyes were gone. Long streaks of blood were flowing from his empty eye sockets, and he was wearing this… smile. A really creepy smile. Beyond creepy. A smile that can GENUINELY SCAR YOU FOR LIFE. His mouth seemed to have been CUT OPEN, so it was wider than it should be.

I jerked awake, breathing hard. That was the worst nightmare I have ever experienced. But was it really a nightmare? As I am typing this, I hear something. Something Lucas used to say. Something that completely creeped me out. “Daddy, can we please play hide and seek?” I am currently panicking, wondering what to do next as a small voice in my head advises me against opening the door, even though IJ am dreadfully curisous. Somthing ha s gne horribly wrong.  tHe thing outside’s mos t likely not lucas, i dOn’t know what it is. Ithink I jsut heard it come in.

**It’S behind me.**
