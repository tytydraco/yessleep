"Hypnagogic hallucinations, also sometimes referred to as waking dreams, are a type of hallucination that occurs as a person is drifting off to sleep. In general, hallucinations involve seeing, hearing, feeling, or smelling something that is not actually present."

Funny how I feel claustrophobic at times, even in a house that is too big for just the three of us: my husband, my cat, and I. The nocturnal events of the past week are not helping. I'm grateful for the coffee shop around the corner that I can escape to when that uncomfortable feeling rises, snaking along my spine to whisper in my ear, "get out. Get. Out. Get out!"

That's where I am, now. In my favorite seat in the corner against the wall, by the window. I can see the entirety of the cafe as well as the sidewalk along the entrance. That's why it's my favorite. I'm the type of person who likes to know what's going on.  I like to understand. And right now, I don't.

This is why I never wanted a too-big house. How can I know what's going on in an upstairs bedroom if I'm in the basement folding laundry? You know? And you hear all those stories about squatters living in attics, crawlspaces or even in walls. Those are exactly the kinds of things I try not to think about when I hear an unidentified tapping or scratching against the bones of a house that holds me like my ribs hold my lungs, without a care for the breath inside. 

It's just the cat, I tell myself. Or, it's just the house settling. I wonder, when will it be settled? It's had a hundred years to get comfortable.

Anyway. The basement. We've been sleeping there since August while I renovate the upstairs bedrooms. There are a couple bedrooms on the ground floor, as well, but we use those as offices. So, we sleep on a mattress on the floor in the basement. I'm a slow renovator, it turns out. 

Our basement is about half finished. At the bottom of the stairs to the left are our washing machine and dryer, a couple of work tables and the guts of the plumbing and hvac systems. To the left, there's a room where we keep our dusty collection of home gym equipment. Then, a long, dark, creepy hallway, with a couple of large but equally dark and creepy closets, that leads from the gym to the fully finished area we're using as our makeshift bedroom. It must've been finished in the 70's judging by the wood paneling and orange shag carpet that I can't wait to rip up. 

In August, it was nice. Dark and cool, even on the hottest nights. But now, with December drawing close, Ryan is starting to grumble about the cold. I don't mind it, but I don't particularly care for lying down there by myself while I wait for my husband to peel himself off the couch and abandon the warmth of the living room for the night. It's hard for me to get to sleep without the familiar weight of him denting the mattress next to me. 

I was lying there waiting for him a couple nights ago when it happened for the first time. I was actually about to fall asleep when I felt what could only be the cat scampering across the mattress. "Damnit, Rue," I sighed as I heard her claws tear into the carpet as she attempted to run out her bedtime zoomies. This is why we always lock Rue out at night. She is very, very nocturnal. I was so tired I could barely keep my eyes open and the last thing I felt like doing was getting up to chase a hyper ass cat around the room. So, I was relieved to hear the basement door open and the thud of Ryan's boots on the stairs. 

Great. It could be his problem, then.

The second my lips parted to call out his name, I heard the scrape of his shoes stop in the middle of the hallway. "Whoa!" He shouted, startled. "Babe! What the hell!" 

"It's just Rue," I called out. 

The lights came on then, revealing my husband standing tall and broad against the dark mouth of the hallway. He was scowling at me. I blinked up at him sleepily and his sweet, brown eyes softened. "Rue?" He asked, confused.

"Yeah," I yawned, propping myself on my elbow to peer around the room, looking for the creature. "She just jumped on the bed." I sat up to get a better look around. Still no sign of the little shit. "I must've left the door open, hm?"

"No," he said, frowning and scratching at his beard. "You didn't," he poked a tile of the drop ceiling, "but that doesn't mean she's not in here."

"You don't really think... she came in through the ceiling?" I shuddered. The thought of something creeping around in the ceiling - even if that something is my beloved pet - was not a pleasant one. 

"Could be," Ryan shrugged. 

"No! She can't be crawling around in the ceiling! Theres all kinds of wires and stuff in there! She could get hurt!" I exclaimed, suddenly far too awake for my liking. "Rue!" I called out, "here kitty, kitty!"

Ryan rolled his eyes, but joined me in the effort of calling the mischievous animal's name. 

"Sssh," Ryan said after a few minutes of this. "Listen."

A faint meow emanated from what sounded like the other side of the basement. I followed Ryan as he walked toward it. 

"Rue?" I called again as we both stood in silence at the bottom of the stairs. Rue answered with a plaintive meow from the other side of the door at the top of the stairs. 

"Well, she's out now," Ryan said and wrapped an arm around my waist as he guided me back down the hallway. 

I yawned again. "Guess we'll figure it out tomorrow," i said as I slid under the covers.

"You sure you weren't having one of your weird dream things?" Ryan asked as he settled in next to me.

I rolled my eyes in the dark. "They're not dreams. They're called hypnogogic hallucinations," I said, for at least the thousandth time. "And no, I don't. I felt her jump on the bed. And I've never had tactile hallucinations. Ever. Don't know why I'd start now."

"You and your big words," the man yawned as he pulled me close. 

"I thought you saw her, too," I said, playfully pushing him away before snuggling into his chest. 

"Nope."

"In the hallway?"

"Hard to see shit in that hallway." Good point.

"But you were like, 'Whoa! Babe! What the hell!'" I said, doing my best to imitate his gravelly voice.

"Oh, yeah," he said. "This'll sound weird but... I swear to god for a second I thought I saw a you-size shadow at end of the hallway. Thought you were sleep walking again."

"Well, that's... that's creepy as fuck."

"Yeah. Guess I imagined it."

"Must have. Rue was definitely in here though."

"And you're absolutely sure you weren't having one of your... whatever they're called? Weird sleep things only you have?"

"No! You literally just asked me that.  And they're actually super common so shut up."

"I did shut up, you're hallucinating."

"I can't stand you," I said as I wrapped my arms around him and squeezed myself even closer to the comforting warmth of him.

"I know."

...

The next day I explored the entire first floor looking for entry points that might allow Rue to slip into the basement ceiling. I couldn't find anything. 

I was beginning to think I really had either dreamed or hallucinated the whole thing, until it happened again last night. This time, Ryan was snoring softly next to me when I woke up needing to pee. Too tired to move right away, I lay there listening to the soothing sound of my husband's breathing. That's when I heard the very distinct sound of the basement door opening. It has a hinge in desperate need of some WD-40, so I always hear when it opens. With Ryan lying next to me, it was not a sound I wanted to hear. I strained to hear anything else over my own rapid pulse pounding in my ears. 

The subsequent silence was reassuring. I was beginning to convince myself I had just imagined it when I heard what sounded like Rue's claws against the concrete floor of the hallway. 

"Rue?" I whispered. "Here, kitty kitty."

The silence stretched on long enough that I thought perhaps I had imagined that, too. I nearly pissed myself when the cat jumped up on the bed right next to my head. "Damnit, Rue!" I hissed as I reached out to scratch her ears in the dark. Ryan stirred next to us but didn't  wake.  

"Did you learn to open doors?" I whispered to the purring cat.

Just then I thought, horribly, of a person - an intruder - opening the basement door, allowing Rue to slip inside. 

"Ryan," I said softly, sitting up and shaking his shoulder gently in an attempt to wake him without startling him. There was a break in the rhythm of his snoring but he didn't wake. 

I was about to whisper his name again when a loud crack shattered the silence like glass. The basement door had slammed shut. "Ryan!" I shouted, although he had already shot up into a sitting position. 

"What's going on?" he demanded.

"The door! Somebody's in here!" I shouted,my voice shrill to my own ears, tight and tremulous as a wire on the verge of snapping. Ryan was already out of the bed and down the hallway.

"Wait!" I cried, jumping out of bed only to stumble and nearly fall in a tangle of blankets. 

"Stay there!" I heard him call out over the hollow thud of his footsteps on the stairs. 

Fear ballooned in my chest like a silent scream as tears pricked at my eyes. I floundered in the dark, groping for the lightswitch in a blind panic. I didn't want to stay here. What if the intruder was still in here? A thousand errant thoughts flew threw my head like birds fleeing from gunshot. Even with the light on and the room proven to be intruderless. I couldn't bring myself to walk into the inky blackness of the hallway. 

So, I hugged myself and paced back and forth in front of that yawning darkness, flinching each time I heard a door open and close in the house above me as Ryan searched the upstairs. It felt like hours had passed before I heard the basement door open again. 

"It's me," Ryan calked out as he thundered down the stairs. When he finally materialized out of the hallway, I threw my arms around the solid broadness of him. He stroked my hair.

"Are you okay?" He asked, his breath warm in my hair as he held me. 

I could only shake my head. The rest of me was shaking, too, I realized. Ryan seemed to realize as well. He rubbed my back and shushed me. "Everythings okay," he said. "Nobody's here. I checked the whole place."

"But you heard it!" I pulled away from him to look up at his face. His lips were pressed into a thin line. 

"Heard what?" He asked. 

"You heard the door slam," I said, my shoulders sagging as he shook his head. "You didn't?"

"I heard you yelling my name," he said.

"But, I heard it," I insisted as he took my hands in his and squeezed them gently while shaking his head. "And then... then Rue was here... and then..."

"It's okay, babe," he said. "You hear things sometimes. I know that's scary, but it's better than someone actually breaking in, right?"

"But..." I started to protest but his eyes were telling me that would be pointless. So, I hugged him just to hide my face against his chest. "I'm sorry," I murmured, feeling like a child who's had a nightmare and woke the whole house for nothing. 

"Ssshh. Don't be sorry. We can go upstairs and watch something funny if you want to."

"No, you have work in the morning."

"Rue was definitely in here, though." I murmured as I let him lead me back to bed. 

...

This morning Ryan asked me if I was okay about a hundred times before he left for work. I assured him that I'm fine, but I guess he knows me better than that.  

"Are you sure?" He asked as he pulled away after our goodbye hug. The way his eyes searched my face made me feel like a specimen smashed between slides, dessicated under the hot light of a microscope. I dropped my gaze before answering.

"Just worried about Rue, I guess," I murmured the half-truth. "Don't want her getting stuck in a wall or electrocuted or something."

Ryan nodded, considering this.  "Rue's pretty smart," he said, although I don't think he meant smart enough to open doors. "I think she'll be okay, but tell you what... I'll pick up a camera on the way home and we can set it up before we go to bed, okay?" 

"That's a good idea," I nodded as I pulled him into another quick hug before he headed out the door. 

Even in the light of day, I can't stop thinking about the events of the night. I'll almost convince myself that I really was dreaming (or perhaps hallucinating), then nearly jump out of my skin when a floorboard creaks under my weight. 

It's easier here, in the bright cafe surrounded by the cheerful murmur of patrons, to truly confront the memory. I know I heard that door open. Maybe it didn't latch all the way when Ryan came downstairs and Rue was able to push it open. But that still doesn't explain how it slammed shut. I know I heard that, too.

Guess we'll just have to see what the camera picks up.
