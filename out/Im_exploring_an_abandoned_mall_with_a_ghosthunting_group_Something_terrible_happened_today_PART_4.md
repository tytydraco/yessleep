[Twenty two days.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/160akeo/im_exploring_an_abandoned_mall_with_a/) We were doing relatively well. We were collecting a bunch of food from abandoned Targets and even a few meat markets, although the latter's pretty risky.

**SAM:** Oh, there's a meat market in here.

**CAM:** No way in hell I'm going in there.

**DAN:** I believe Cameron's right. I wouldn't go there if I were you.

**AVERY:** I'm sure it can't be that bad.

**SOPHIA:** I've played enough horror games to know that THAT is not a good place to be. Not like this place is either, but you get the point.

**CAM:** Yeah, man. That shit looks like an unloaded area in a PS2 game. Hell no.

He was right. It *did* look like an unloaded area.

The entrance looked like a .JPEG of a door that was copy-pasted onto a smooth wall. It looked sketchy as hell, but we were desperate.

**JACK:** Be paranoid all ya want, but we need quality food. I haven't eaten anythin' decent in days.

**SOPHIA:** Why do you even need this bougie stuff anyway? We're fine with just eating ramen for now. I feel like we're gonna be a-

**JACK:** Frankly, I'm sick of it, Sophie. Feels like I'm gonna vomit if I eat another bowl of it.

**DAN:** I get what you mean, Jack. I wanna say "Feels like I'm in the receipt pit all over again, am I right? Hahaha!" but I have this little thing called self-preservation and it really doesn't want me to go on a suicide mission for raw steak, you get me?

**JACK:** Yeah, I got it. I'm still cravin' a steak though. We have a buncha A1 sauce too.

We recieved a text message.

"*Do it, it's worth it. ;)*"

**CAM:** Not a good sign. Don't think we wanna trust this guy anymore, dudes.

**HAILEY:** You know what? Fuck it.

Hailey took a few steps forward and tried to open the door.

She stuck her hand out and it clipped through the door, just like Sam did through a cracked tile.

**SAM:** You sure about this, Hailey?

**HAILEY:** We can't get out of here anyway, so who gives a shit?

**SAM:** I guess you're right.

Jack, Hailey, Sam, Avery and I decided to head into the meat market together.

The inside of the market looked like an ordinary meat market, but something was clearly off.

Everything looked oddly... flat and unnaturally smooth.

Even the gaps between the floor tiles were fake.I felt like I was in a plastic dollhouse.

**SAM:** ...You know what? I changed my mind. I'm just gonna... go for a minute, if that's not an issue with anyo-

The floor suddenly split in half, a gigantic, growing gap appearing between the two halves.A red glow filled the whole room.

I heard Dan mumbling to himself through the wall.

"*I forgot about the butcher. I forgot about the butcher. I forgot about the butcher.*"

**ME:** Dan's saying something about a butcher.

**JACK:** A what!?

**ME:** A butcher!

**SAM:** That can't be good.

A thick drop of saliva dripped down from the ceiling.

**???????:** Ahh.... Fresh meat...

**JACK:** What in the living hell is that!?

Jack pointed upwards.

There was a young-looking man wearing a butcher's uniform crawling on the ceiling, facing directly towards us. He had several arms and legs, almost like a spider. His joints were twisted at impossible angles. They looked broken beyond repair. He was grinning, salivating in anticipation for his next meal. He was ecstatic.

**HAILEY:** Wh-What do you want, you... uh... asshole... spider... monster... thing?

Hailey was clearly as horrified as everyone else was.

**BUTCHER:** I have not eaten.... in decades... I shall... gnaw... on your... rotting bones...
He took deep breaths after every couple of words.  His voice was raspy and deep.
 I could feel myself unwillingly hyperventilating.

A platform emerged from the pit.

It was identical to the floor in the mall, except every other tile was missing in a chessboard pattern.

The meat that was on front display started moving.It reassembled itself into a gigantic pile of red raw flesh and it began slowly moving towards us.

Human guts, hearts, kidneys and livers were bulging out of the mass, skinless faces silently screaming in agony plastered all across an amalgamation of red raw meat.

**BUTCHER:** Run, run, run! Hahahahaha.....

The Butcher was gone.

There were hundreds of thousands of tiles ahead of us.

Before we knew it, Jack darted forward as inhuman speeds  as fountains of crimson, gushing blood had begun pouring out through the floor gaps.  We fled in Jack's path as fast as we could.

Wet, echoey footsteps resonated throughout the bleeding, suffering meat market.

Right as we got next to the entrance, Avery slipped and fell, falling through a fountain of gore.

Blood began filling her lungs, splashing all over her face.

Luckily, she held onto a solid tile and Sam pulled her up. She said she felt "very cold" on the other side.

Jack tackled the door full-force and it swung open this time.We violently fell onto the floor, carried by a tidal-like wave of deep scarlet gore.

Eventually, it stopped oozing, much like an open wound.

The door slammed shut right afterwards, sealing away the creature inside.

We were all heavily panting. Running for 15 minutes straight is extremely exhausting, after all.

**AVERY:** I... I appreciate that.

**SAM:** It's... it's fine really. Not a big deal.

Sam smiled, his face covered in red.

**HAILEY:** Sorry to interrupt you two, but what in the flying *fuck* was that?! Who's the Butcher?! Dan, you have to know something about this!

**DAN:** He's a psychopath, that's all I know. Got turned into whatever he is now, started killing people and putting them in this living meat pile. God, I hope Ruby's not in there...

**JACK:** I've seen worse.

**HAILEY:** Jack, I know you're my "boss" and whatever but, no. Straight up, no. No you haven't.

**JACK:** Fair 'nough. That was... somethin' else.

**ME:** There was... so much blood...

I wanted to throw up, but I held it in.

**AVERY:** We should-

Avery coughed out, you guessed it, congealed blood.

**AVERY:** We should just stick to the Targets, honestly. That was genuinely scarring.

**SOPHIA:** This should be a lesson; don't enter any sketchy retail stores in this place. They might be like this one or like even like the...

**CAM:** The Toys'R'Us, yeah. Basically, if shit looks creepy, don't interact with it. You'll prolly just... die or something, I dunno.

**DAN:** Let's just... move on from that, shall we?

We decided to set up shelter further away, next to one of the Targets.

We received another text message from Tom.

"*RULE 17:  Fire doesn't emit smoke in the mall. Feel free to make a cozy campfire ;)*"

**SOPHIA:** Yeah, I agree with Cam, honestly. I don't think we wanna trust Tom anymore.

**AVERY:** Why shouldn't we? He's quite literally saved our lives for the past... twenty two days? Christ.

**DAN:** If he can type, that means he's mostly sane. And if he's sane, then we can trust him.

**HAILEY:** I'm honestly so tired of decision making. I just wanna relax for a minute. The sheer amount of paranormal things that I've directly seen face-to-face is so overwhelming.

**JACK:** Yeah, this isn't anything like our regular ghosthuntin' missions.

**SOPHIA:** Maybe I'm just being paranoid. I just felt like a winky face in a text message wasn't exactly a good thing.

**HAILEY:** Honestly, I could not care less. I just wanna have a break from... everything that's happened.

**SOPHIA:** Yeah, that- that'd be nice.

We were all silent for a moment. It felt peaceful, for once.

We decided to set up a campfire, as Tom had suggested.

And he was right; the fire didn't emit smoke, but it did eminate an unusual amount of light.

**ME:** How did it come to this? All this ghost-hunting nonsense?

**SAM:** Well, I wasn't really interested in the paranormal until I joined the SAP. I was looking for a job and I saw this advert about ghost-hunting. It sounded ridiculous, but then I saw the pay; it was fifty dollars an hour. I-I didn't even care. I had to call Hailey right away.

**ME:** How did you and Hailey meet in the first place?

**SAM:** We were roommates in uni. We weren't really close, but I just... I didn't know who else to call. She was looking for a job as well, at the time.

**ME:** What about you, Cam? Sophie?

**SOPHIA:** So, I really liked horror movies ever since I was a kid. I saw The Exorcist when I was about ten years old. It absolutely terrified me, but for some reason I felt satisfied after watching it all the way through, and that's basically how I became a horror fan. Then, after about eight years, I started this YouTube channel all about, y'know, horror. I wanted to hire a cameraman and that's how I met Cameron. We became best friends afterwards.

**ME:** What about... uh... the Old Crew, I guess?

**DAN:** *That's* what you're calling us now?

**ME:** I mean, you were in here before us for a few years.

**DAN:** Yeah, but the Old Crew? I know I'm about fifty, but you really... didn't have to do that. I still look twenty-five! I've just been in the Pit for a while.

**ME:** Yeah, but it sounds kinda cool, doesn't it?

**DAN:** I suppose so. In any case, I don't think Jack's gonna reveal anything anytime soon. He's got a few more secrets of his own that he hasn't exactly revealed yet.

**ME:** How did you join the SAP?

**DAN:** Well, Jack and I were classmates, and that's about it. He invited us to this ghost-hunting business, told us he'd pay well, told us we'd have fun. Nothing too complicated

.**ME:** Cool, cool.

**DAN:** Sometimes, things in life just aren't as complex as you think.

**HAILEY:**  Horror discussion aside, I'm absolutely starving right now. If *somebody* hadn't eaten all of our supplies, I think we would've been *JUST* fine!

Hailey's passive-aggressiveness was going through the roof.

She reached her hand into a duffle bag, and took out an unopened packet of ramen.

**????????:** Excuse me, may I have that?

A man wearing beige shorts and a T-shirt approached Hailey, slightly bending over as he stared at her.

**HAILEY:** What? Who the hell...? No, of course not, I was about to-

**????????:** You have something that I need. May I have that?

His smile was warm, but his eyes were glassy and expressionless.

**SAM:** Hailey!

Sam looked panicked, his breaths quick and sharp.

**SAM:** Hailey, please just give it the ramen and it'll go away. J-Just listen to me, okay?!

**HAILEY:** Wha- "it"?!

**SAM:** That's not a person, Hailey! That's a Customer!

**HAILEY:** What kind of a monster name is that?! Dan, you should've told me about this! Come on, how do I-

**DAN:** You think I remember *anything about these things?!* I was in a pocket dimension for 20 years, for Christ's sake!

**CUSTOMER:** You have something. I. Need. Something. I. Have. You.

Its words sounded spliced, inhuman. There was something terribly wrong with it, I just couldn't quite figure it out.

The Customer grabbed Hailey, holding onto her ramen packet with inhuman force, breaking her fingers with a sickening crunch.

**HAILEY:** *Get the fuck away from me!*

She said, tears in her eyes, her leather jacket still covered in blood.

Hailey ripped the ramen packet in half, spilling the contents out onto the tiled floor.

And then, she was gone.

She just dissapeared without a trace.

It looked like she was just... removed out of existence. Like some higher power intervened and made her vanish.

Hailey's stuff was gone too. Any trace of her simply just didn't exist.

Sam was devestated, so he tried recalling any past experiences they've had together.He couldn't even remember her face anymore.

We set up a memorial for Hailey with whatever we had. Packets of ramen, a leather jacket, plastic flowers, everything; anything we remembered about her.

We could try exploring even further into the mall, but it just feels so empty now. We've lost a member today, and something tells me that this loss won't be the only one.
