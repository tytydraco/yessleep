I was seven when this incident happened to me, along with my two sisters i went to a new waterpark opened in town, I was fascinated with waterparks and enjoyed it, my sisters both went in to the lazy river and i went to a water slide (A lazy river is a water ride found in water parks, hotels, resorts, and recreation centers, which usually consists of a shallow pool that flows similarly to a river. There is generally a slow current, usually just enough to allow guests to gently ride along lying on rafts.)

Then i saw an old women maybe in her 50,s she was in a yellow swimsuit and had long black hair she was in the lazy river jumping around like a maniac and was disturbing others

so my sisters decided to prank the old lady, my elder sister pulled the ladies leg from beneath and she started shouting her wig came off and all the people started laughing on her she left the ride in anger

ON asking that why my sisters did that they told me that while they were in the restroom this woman started sniffing my smaller sisters hair and when my elder sister tried to stop her she angrily argued till my smaller sister started crying and the old woman left, upon hearing this i was creeped out

Later me and my sisters (i was the middle child) decided to use a water slide which was like 10m

ME AND MY SISTERS WERE THE LAST ONES ON THE SLIDE, The instructor told us to not stop in between the slide and we went off but then my elder sister who was siting at last me in between and my smaller sister in front she told us to stop to enjoy the view., we stopped midway and looked and the glorious view but then comes the horror my sister stood up and was recording on her phone and we heard the instructor shouting 'MAM YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO RIDE THE SLIDE IS CLOSED" 

The lady was the same one (50 yr old) and she pushed the instructor who fell on hard concrete and we could hear his screams of agony and pain, from behind she came as fast as she could knocking my elder sister from the slide and pushed me and my little sister to the end she pulled my sisters hair and scratched me but then the guards arrived and she ran off , MY ELDER SISTERS KNEE WAS COMPLETLY BROKEN AND SHE WAS IN BED FOR 4 MONTHS FOR FULL RECOVERY

the old lady was finally caught in the control room with my sisters hair in her mouth which choked her to death

Till this day i have never visited a water park and never will and the scratch she put on my back still remains as a scar, telling others that i live to tell the tale, the instructor unfortunately D!ed due to brain concussions 

Till this day the horror remains and i am sure i would never let my children go to water parks 

My sister recently d!ed because of an car accident due to the failure of breaks which is somewhat strange considering that i was also in the car but she was the one who died same like last time she took the fall for us both siblings

RIP Athena I MISS YOU
