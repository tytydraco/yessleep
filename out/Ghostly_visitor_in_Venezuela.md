I served a religious mission abroad in Venezuela. This particular experience happened when I was about 20 years old. While I wouldn't consider myself, then or now, an overtly religious or spiritual person (largely I think I did this mission from societal/family pressures and expectations), our ghostly visitor that spanned over the course of 3 nights continues to leave me shook.

This all went down in the coastal town of Carupano, Venezuela. 4 of us, all male and of the same approximate age, lived in the same apartment which happened to be directly above a bakery. It was so long ago but I believe it was likely [this one](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2917A2NXERbxSVSd6), this is the only detail of this story that is fuzzy to me as I only stayed in that town/apartment for about 2 weeks.

The apartment had a small dining/receiving which was all open to the kitchen area when walking in and then a single hallway to the right. On the first left was the only bathroom, the second door on the left was a bedroom with 2 single twin mattresses and one tiny small window at the top of the room between them. There was no working fan or AC unit and it was hot as hell at night. And so the 4 of us all slept in the largest room which was directly across the hall from this one. There were two actual beds, one, right next to the door and the other lining the adjacent wall and then myself and another missionary simply laid our mattresses on the tan, large format tile floor.

One morning when myself and my assigned companion (we also go out in pairs, yes Mormons) were out walking the street he sheepishly asked me if he could share something with me. I told him sure of course, but he shied a bit away from it. After a bit of encouragement on my part he shared that when he had awoken during the night he looked over and saw that there was a spirit that looked like a man sleeping next to me. Interestingly, I told him, that during the night I had a "dream" that a man, who was wearing what appeared to be an Asian conical hat and carrying a backpack, had tapped on the bars of our apartment door. Weary from his travels he asked if he could rest and stay with us for a while. I obliged and let him in.

This other missionary asked me if we should share any of this with the other two, dismissing this as a weird coincidence and not really caring to believe that any of this had any merit of being anything real I simply waved it off and told him not to worry about it and it's not worth sharing. It's important to know that as missionaries we are rarely separated and I know that for the remainder of the day and evening he had absolutely no contact with the others.

After getting ready to retire for the evening I had gone to the shared bedroom, laid my mattress down and was preparing to drift off to sleep. 3 of us had already retired to bed, the 4th (unaware of our previous conversation) was out in the bathroom brushing his teeth. As I lay there I began to hear voices. The number of which and their loudness quickly began to increase until it sounded like I was standing in the middle of a large and very loud crowd. I started to roll back and forth believing that I might be losing my sanity. I couldn't take it anymore and was ready to scream out and ask for help. It was at this moment that the missionary who was out brushing his teeth burst through the door quickly, slamming it shut behind him. Eyes wide with fright he hurriedly said in his native Spanish, "There's something out there! Something is in our apartment."

None of the group dared leave the bedroom, we shared our story from earlier with the other two missionaries. One of them said a prayer, the rest of the night passed without incident.

On the morning after the 3rd night, the 4th missionary, who had not experienced anything personally shared with us that during the night he saw him leave the apartment (he and myself are Americans, the other two Venezuelans).   
  
We pressed him for more details. He said that he saw him stand up from where I was sleeping on the floor, he watched him reach for the doorknob and opened the door. He quietly walked out shutting the door behind him. His bed was right next to where the door opened, none of us had left the bedroom that night, I don't believe he was mistaken in what he saw.

I then shared that during this same night I had another "dream" that our visitor had been standing above me where i was sleeping, while fussing with his conical hat he thanked me for allowing him to stay and rest but that he needed to continue moving on. I also watched him leave the room in the manner described by the other missionary.

I haven't actively attended church in over 5 years. I don't concern myself with ghosts or many spiritual things but this experience continues to leave me pondering.
