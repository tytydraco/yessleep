The obnoxious sound of Jack’s alarm clock jolted him awake. Slow and sluggish in an attempt to roll himself out of bed, he noticed from his bedroom window that it was raining. A sense of subtle joy overtook him, for he loved the rain.

He couldn’t come to a conclusion for the love of rain, but he felt it on days like this. Jack made his way downstairs to grab a cup of coffee and see his parents, who had left for their week’s vacation to Sicily, Italy. “Oh, yeah,” he thought to himself, forgetting they left around 5 a.m. for their 8 a.m. flight this morning. Jack didn’t work and had no obligations in the home for the most part. 

He was a good and respectful kid, though he had no sort of inclination to work. Entertainment and indulging in hedonistic pleasures was almost a daily routine for him since graduating high school. The priorities he would have after leaving his parents’ home—finding his passions and the question of what career path he would venture into—were too daunting to answer. He was way too comfortable. Mind you, that was the fault of his parents.

Jack was in the kitchen grabbing the coffee his parents made earlier in the morning. He proceeded and started making toast, poured himself a heaping bowl of Apple Jacks, and made his way into his room to play some games on his Xbox. The type of games he enjoyed were first-person shooters like Call of Duty, along with a few cups of coffee just to get himself awake. Jack aspired to be a skilled gaming personality since streaming was now so prevalent. The success of many YouTube creators and gamers Jack grew up watching motivated that vision he had for himself. The rain began to pour down harder, with echoes of thunder nearby. In the midst of his gaming, Jack noticed he felt a sense of comfort. 

Besides the coziness he felt on days like this, the rain also gave him a sense of relief from his complacency, knowing others were inside as well due to the stormy weather. “Most people are probably having some sort of leisure time as well,” he thought.

As Jack continued playing his games and eating what was left of his cereal, he was interrupted by a few knocks at the front door. He ignored it at first, not wanting to answer to some salesman or neighbor, so he continue with his leisurely morning in peace. He knew it was wrong, but his laziness overtook him frequently. He heard more knocks again, just as the first. Out of annoyance, he removed his headset and tossed it onto his bed, got up from his chair, and made his way downstairs to answer the door. It was a FedEx driver with a package who requested a signature of approval. It was for his father, whose name was Richard Campbell. Jack made a lousy attempt at his signature on the driver’s tablet; the man thanked him, nodded, and was off.

Jack peered to the right over at his friend Stephen’s house to see if he was home, since he hadn’t texted him to play games yet. There were no cars in his driveway nor on the street in front of his home. Jack acknowledged he must be at his community college classes today. He decided not to text him until evening to join him to play Call of Duty. Outside was murky, and it was still raining considerably hard. Jack closed the door and went back inside.

After setting the box down, he saw his car keys on the counter, reminding him he should grab a snack for later, knowing he would want something while gaming with Stephen. He pondered where to go as he quickly threw on shoes and a coat, left, and walked to his old 1999 Honda Civic parked in the driveway. The rain settled a bit, but was still more than a light drizzle. Jack lived in the suburbs of Huntington Beach, California, in a safe neighborhood, home to many middle-class families and a select few of the wealthy. His parents did quite well for themselves, so you could say Jack’s family lived modestly. Jack started driving to his local 7-Eleven a few minutes away, where he went roughly every other day. He knew the clerk since childhood, but the man strangely never said a word; as he recollected the thought, he smiled at the realization.

He approached the driveway entrance, and it was packed even in the rain, yet it was close to lunchtime, so he parked several spots from the store that were available. Mildly annoyed, he got out to walk inside and noticed a peculiar man—not homeless-looking, but rummaging through the trash, clearly looking for something. He was roughly six feet tall, wore a large jacket, denim pants, and a strange hat that was almost fitting for the outfit. Jack walked up and hesitated, seeing the man was partially blocking the door. He tried circumnavigating his way around him to go inside without notice. Then the man peered right, noticing Jack, and said,
“Sir, sir, have you seen a knife anywhere? You know, one that flips out and it’s about this big,” gesturing oddly with his hands.
“No, I haven’t. I just got here,” Jack replied, confused.

The man replied back, “Oh…” and proceeded to look. Jack opened the door, and before closing it, the man said a bit louder, “You sure?” He had a pocket knife in his hand, as he’d described a second ago, and said, “It was in my coat pocket on my right side the whole time.”

“I never checked it!” he yelled out, followed by some uncanny laughs, hardly breaking eye contact with Jack.

“Glad you found it,” Jack said nervously. He closed the door quickly, considering telling the clerk to call the police. The clerk was in the corner near the back door, texting—unaware of anything that had just happened at the front with the man. Jack looked back at the man; he was walking off, so Jack decided to get his things quickly, check out, and go home. In a haste, and while taking constant glances at the front entrance and glass windows for the man, Jack grabbed a bag of BBQ Ruffles chips, a Hundred Grand chocolate bar, and an original Red Bull in the span of ten seconds. He went to pay and considered telling the clerk about the man and the interaction, but didn’t, due to being in a hurry to leave. He bought his things and said, “Have a good one.”

The clerk didn’t say anything except for a nod of acknowledgement. Jack noticed the man was not to be seen as he walked out from the store, but as he walked a few steps he spotted him sitting in a black Jeep Cherokee a few spots from him. He walked speedily to his car to leave, and suddenly the man, a few paces away, noticed him again, calling out, “Hey, kid!”
“Thanks for the help anyway. Who knows what I would’ve done tonight. I don’t have much money. I’m pretty forgetful, wouldn’t you say?” he added, now looking at Jack with that strange look as before, except this time almost grinning and not breaking eye contact again.

Jack didn’t respond; he just needed to get into the car. He didn’t know what that was and didn’t care to find out by entertaining that conversation. He started to pull out, trying his best to avoid looking at the man still parked. He left and, while driving, felt an acute sense of paranoia that the man might be following him, not knowing what to expect at this point. As he started driving, the rain began to pick up again, setting the mood for something unsettling like this—coincidentally. He persisted, peering into his rearview window the entire way back home. Jack was having a hard time shaking the image of the man’s grin and creepy interaction they had.

What felt like an eternity, Jack was finally arrived back to the house. Getting out of the car, he made his way to the front door, then immediately stopped and felt the need to put his car in the garage. He just didn’t want to be noticed, even though he felt his precautions of being seen were a bit dramatic. He got back in the car and pulled into the garage.
“I’m an idiot,” he thought, going through scenarios in his head and concluding it could’ve just been a strange man looking for his knife who was too talkative. “I don’t know, man—the way he looked at me was almost menacing, but regardless, that was sketchy,” he thought, almost finding room for humor in the situation. 

He felt relieved to be home at least and clicked the button to close the garage. Just as the garage was closing, he saw a black car drive by and made a momentary flash of eye contact with a man driving, wearing a hat, who gazed inside at him as the garage door was creeping down about a quarter of the way. The garage made its way shut.

Jack couldn’t tell with certainty if it was the man from earlier, but seeing a black car and the man inside appearing to wear a hat made his stomach sink and his body tense up with fear. His heartbeat raced for a brief moment at the eerie thought of the man passing by. Consequently, his mind started to piece together a bunch of reasons not to be worried. Thinking the man from earlier knew where he lived became the only thing he could think about. “What if he pulled back around and he’s in front of the house looking for me?” he thought. He frantically locked the garage door and took his bag of snacks up to his room, where he sat for a while, listening to the rain and looking out his bedroom window for anybody that could be at the house. There was nobody to be seen except for a few passing cars and the empty neighborhood.

Jack didn’t want to scare his parents by telling them what happened while they were so far away in Italy, so he texted Stephen and explained the situation. Thirty minutes went by with no response. Hours went by, and Jack never left his window in fear of the man coming. He decided to get back on his games without his headset in order to hear anything going on outside that would raise any alarm in him. Stephen finally texted back just as Jack hopped into his first match of a different game called Fortnite. He felt partially relieved looking at Stephen’s text saying, “That’s creepy, man. I don’t think he’s out to get you though haha. Wanna hop on some games in a while?” “I’ll be home in a couple of hours.”

Jack knew Stephen couldn’t have known the severity of the situation, having not experienced it. “How could he not be creeped out and paranoid if he were in my shoes right now?” he thought. He would, Jack concluded, and the same worries came back and began to persist. A couple worried hours later he hopped on the games with Stephen around 7 p.m. Stephen had a long day of school and had gone out to dinner with some girl he recently met. As they were both playing Fortnite, Stephen asked, “Anything else happen since we talked?”

“Not really,” Jack replied. “I just keep thinking about it, but honestly I think I was tripping myself out thinking about it too much, if you know what I mean.”
“Yeah, I’m glad you answered my call and the guy didn’t get you,” Stephen replied jokingly.
Jack laughed and said, “No, for real—you should’ve seen me. I ran up to my room looking out the window for hours, thinking the dude was after me or something. Call me a lunatic or whatever, but in the moment I was ready to fight this guy if he pulled up to the house.”
“No, you wouldn’t,” Stephen said, laughing. “You’d be under your bed texting 911, let’s be real.”

“Nahhhh,” Jack said sarcastically, knowing he was probably right. They both laughed.
They continued playing for hours until Stephen had to go finish homework he was doing last second for his morning history class. They hung up the phone, and Jack was now alone but was left more at ease—either from Stephen’s jokes and downplaying the situation, poking fun at Jack’s overreaction, or just having another person to talk to to alleviate the end of Jack’s seemingly chaotic day.

There wasn’t much else to do. He had already talked to his parents that night and caught up on how things were going. He went to bed shortly after playing a few more games. The rain was settled but kept coming about in intermittent spurts. Something woke him—he heard a thud or a crack in the house he couldn’t make out, being mostly asleep. It wasn’t unusual for that to happen, he thought, and brushed it off. He then heard the sound of a car out front, and it was a neighbor pulling in across the street. Even after Jack’s relief, he still felt on edge and on high alert. The couple of sounds seemed to revive some anxiety that had vanished earlier. Lying in his bed, he looked out again, then one more time a few moments later out of paranoia and a last attempt of reassurance he could sleep soundly.

Another snap, the same as before, was heard in the house, only further. He nervously got up to investigate. In extreme hesitation, he poked his head looking towards the dim hallway. Jack gained some confidence and scoured the upstairs while turning the lights on. He looked out the windows of his parents’ room at the backyard, then peered out over the railing down to the downstairs hallway. I guess the house is just creaking and I’m being a little girl about it? Jack thought. In frustration, he turned the lights off, shut his bedroom door, locked it, and went to bed.

The midnight rain began to pick up and into the night persisted as a soothing white noise, with Jack’s window being cracked. His frustrations before bed allowed him to put his worries behind him and sleep like the man of a household does—comfortably, but with one eye open, as they say. During Jack’s sleep, the sound of a slow-moving vehicle could be heard pulling up just across the street.

The sound of the car being put into park was enough to wake him again. Jack took a second to peer out his window, being as tired as he was and now annoyed. He looked out and saw it was a black Jeep Cherokee parked on the other side of his house. His heart raced and he looked away from the window. Is it the guy? he asked himself with the utmost fear now settling in him. He went to look, but nobody got out. The windows were dark and he couldn’t make anything out from where he was. He laid back in bed, terrified of the thought that he knew the person saw him look. If it was the man, then I assume he saw me trying to see if it was him. What is this!? he thought to himself angrily and fearfully.

A car door then opened and shut, and Jack couldn’t bear himself to look outside. Footsteps a moment later made their way toward the house in an offbeat rhythm and veered off to the left and stopped. Jack boldly made a peek out the window and couldn’t see anybody. What? What!? he said to himself quietly in immense confusion. Is he sneaking up on me? Jack wanted to confirm the front door was locked but couldn’t in fear of leaving his room. He needed to hear what was going on.

“Where did the man go?” Jack said, trembling. He could barely move a muscle, too nervous to even take a step away from where he was. He didn’t want to make the faintest sound.
The faintest sound of the front door opening slowly could be heard downstairs. Jack nearly fainted, his heart was beating out of his chest, realizing the door was unlocked the entire day. He stayed put in his room silently, with his whole body tingling with panic.

There was no sound to be heard. Jack tried to open his window slowly while in a haze, listening attentively to the sounds and footsteps of the person below. Jack quietly got the window fully open, and he waited there. The silence was ominous—it was unbearable. The man could suddenly be heard running up the stairs and immediately at the top tried forcing the door open but couldn’t. Jack, still on the verge of screaming and fainting, noticed the man stopped. He heard him shuffle back a few paces away from the door.

Jack, on the verge of collapse, listened, then—Snap! Jack yelled. The man’s foot blasted through the door, making a huge opening, and the man got down on a knee to reach his left arm through the hole and up to unlock the latch on the other side of the door. He fiddled with the lock and slammed the door open. Jack instinctively drew himself to the window, climbed out to the edge, and without much hesitation leaped from the second-story window to the grass. He rolled on his shoulder hard enough to feel injured on getting up, but he still had the ability to run.

The man’s loud footsteps could be heard running down the wooden stairs in pursuit of Jack, who made a run for it as fast as he could. He made his way sprinting down the harrowing street of his neighborhood and could see the man in the distance wildly running after him. Jack almost started crying and yelled out, “Help!” loudly a couple of times as he tried keeping a steady gap between him and the man.

There wasn’t much use—the fact was nobody was awake to be immediate help. Jack kept his pace and he began to lose the man behind him, making his way around the corner to his local park. The man followed around the corner, but Jack was already most of the way through the park, entering the other side of the neighborhood.

Exhausted from running, Jack made it a few blocks down and hid behind some shrubs bordering the front of a neighbor’s house. I’ll lay here and watch for a while, he said, covered in sweat. His stomach on the dirt, arms and shoulders on the ground, he watched from behind the shrub, hidden. Jack sat there lying a few minutes until finally, the man—who he could see now was the one from before: six feet tall, the same jacket and denim pants along with a strange hat. The man was looking around aimlessly in search for Jack, now looking frustrated. Nearing closer in Jack’s direction, he could hear the man muttering words and swearing to find him.
“That fucki— that fucking kid, I’ll find him and kill him.”

His delirious state of mind and words just spoken startled Jack immensely. He couldn’t believe that was the same man from yesterday. He couldn’t believe he actually had vile intentions the entire time. It was all a sick trick, he thought to himself, thinking back to yesterday, trembling again. He watched as the man continued on, so Jack reached for his phone. It was at home on his bed.

“Damnit!” he whispered. “It makes sense—I did leave suddenly, but at a time like this?”
Jack allowed for a few more minutes to pass with the idea in mind to make his way back home, hoping he could build up the courage to. A few moments passed—it was time. He slowly crept upward about halfway, making a few glances of confirmation and started walking toward the street. He wanted to run, but if the man was near he thought he’d run into him unexpectedly or draw attention to the sound of himself if he wasn’t walking cautiously. The streetlights gave an incandescent and eerie feel as he made his way along. It stopped raining but a light sprinkle could be felt as Jack proceeded home.

He passed through the park to his side of the neighborhood. Not once had a car passed, and at an instant, a cat made its way across the street, startling Jack. He continued walking and his steps grew at a faster pace as he was approaching his house. He ran up, locked the front door with haste, and quickly got upstairs. He grabbed his phone from his bed and walked downstairs. He was peering out the living room windows, keeping watch for the man, as he called 911.

He saw something outside—he couldn’t make it out, it was hard to tell in the dark of night. The operator answered. “Hello, this is 911, what is your emergency?”
Jack gave a quick summary of what happened at 7-Eleven with the mysterious man. He quickly summarized the initial interaction, the man passing moments later in his car, seeing his house, and the later visiting him that evening and how he snuck up into the house, to his room and chased him out and down the street. The operator listened attentively, taking notes and asking further questions.
“Can you give me a description of what this man looks like?”
Jack turned away from the window, giving the reply.

The man was staring at Jack from behind the corner wall of the kitchen who’d been waiting for him to enter the house. He was smiling insanely with his pocket knife in hand.
“Ahhhhhhh!” Jack screamed and cried, dropping his phone. He picked up a two-foot candlestick stand nearest to him at the window.

The man took a step forward, making himself fully visible, and ran at Jack with a sinister and crooked look. Jack swung as he neared, hitting his side. The man tried grabbing Jack’s shirt, but Jack barely slipped away running toward the dining table. The man followed, laughing, running around, swinging his knife towards Jack, slashing his arm from across the table. The table gave a few feet of distant between them. The man got on the table and stepped over toward Jack in another attempt to grab him, but Jack kicked him off and missed a swing with the candle stand.

Jack ran for the stairs, with the man just behind him. The man to grabbed him by the shirt ready to stab him as they neared the top of the stairs. Jack spun around quickly, in a full 180 degrees, and swung with all his might, and the candle stand struck the man badly on the side of the head. The man immediately dropped to the top steps of the stairs, bleeding, and tumbled down to the bottom of the stairs. He lay there unconscious.

Jack started sobbing profusely. This went on for a moment. He then couldn’t endure another second of being at the top of the stairs looking down at the man. He didn’t know for sure if he was dead or not. Jack ran down the stairs, wiping his tears, and grabbed the knife off the floor that the man dropped after being hit, and called 911 again. He made the call from the sidewalk, looking into his house with the front door open.

He was traumatized and couldn’t bear being in the vicinity of the man who was likely dead. The cops couldn’t believe it. Jack’s parents and his friends later couldn’t believe what happened that night. Most of all, Jack couldn’t believe it. He was sitting there partially in delirium and a haze as the authorities made their way inside to investigate the scene. Jack stayed outside with a few cops who comforted him and asked a series of questions. The man was declared dead due to that mighty blow to the head with the candle stand. 

Jack was thinking how such a seemingly perfect day turned into a nightmare. He thought how just going to a 7 Eleven wouldn’t be the same anymore or even being at home. His prior worries of the man were justified with the events that happened that evening. This moment never left Jack, but the trauma got better with time, and he went on to venture into those things we mentioned in the beginning of the story.
The one thing he learned from this day was to never leave your front door unlocked.

The End.
