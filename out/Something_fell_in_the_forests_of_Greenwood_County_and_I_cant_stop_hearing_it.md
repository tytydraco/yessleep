I (31F) am a ranger at Greenwood State Park, I’ve worked there for almost a decade. These woods are my home. Earlier tonight I was on shift for the fire watch. We post up in these tall lookout towers across the park and keep radio contact with other rangers. It’s not exciting, usually just keeping track of active campsites and looking out for any delinquency. Tonight has been a complete mess though. 

 

Don’t mock me, but I wasn’t necessarily being professional tonight. Me and another ranger were just holding a conversation over the radio. Usually people come to this line of work to get away from people. Honestly, we just talked about junk; shows we like, dates we went on, gossip on campers. It’s a waste of resources but trust me when I say you need some stimulation to help out here.  

 

You can look out over the horizon and watch as the sun gets swallowed by the tree line, releasing darkness over the forest. You get it, at night even the place you consider home can change. I guess I’m trying to say it helps to have someone to talk to. Besides, Ed is nice. 

 

Regardless, I should’ve been paying more attention. Him and I were in the middle of conversation. I talked about how I met up with a guy the other night, he asked how it went; I said, “not great.” 

 

“Do you even talk to anyone outside of work- do you even know how?” He asked, equal parts joking and critical.  

   
“Shut up,“ I said bluntly, “He came to fish, I checked his license and asked me out. I went to be nice. But honestly, he’s just a bit of an asshole. I think he left beer cans lying around.” 

 

I waited for Ed’s predictably sassy response, but I was met instead by a few seconds of static over the radio. At first it was just loud, gargled static, but soon the sound equalized to this faint, droning humming sound. The sound grew in presence, emitting louder through the speakers, then seemingly louder than that. 

 

It was more than annoying—it was grating. It was the kind of buzz that makes you grind your teeth, the kind of ear-piercing sound that felt like it punctured through your eardrum.  I grabbed the radio and checked everything; it should’ve been working fine, but despite my efforts it was howling like something was screaming from within. The noise grew so loud that it was no longer coming from the radio, but from outside the tower.  

 

 I looked out towards where it was coming from, and I froze. 

 

In that moment, something—a meteor—pierced through the air and landed in the forest below. I wasn’t sure what I had seen at first, but as the screech silenced itself with a thud, my mind made sense of it. And as the meteor fell to the earth, my radio fell silent too.  

 

I radioed Ed, asking if he had seen it too. He had. 

 

We talked back and forth for a minute, trying to find the crash site. Our map is laid out in a grid, I think it landed just a couple miles north of my location, and he confirmed. Ed estimated it landed 5 miles east of his location, giving me a more exact landing zone. Problem being that spot was within half a mile of an active campsite. 

 

I cursed under my breath before telling Ed that I was going to head down to investigate and that I’d be switching to short-range radio. Ed insisted on going instead, but I was closer. I told him he needed to stay on lookout, and to be ready to call rescue services in case of any incidents. 

 

I should’ve listened to my gut when I looked down the descending stairwell from the tower. The light from my post bled into the night below me, and still it wasn’t enough. I couldn’t see the forest floor until I clicked on my flashlight and left the safe glow of my watch tower. 

 

I was armed with a standard issue revolver. I know this type of thing is supposed to make you feel safer, but it doesn’t; it just reminds you that you may need it. The Northwest United States is famous for a lot of things; the peacefulness of its fauna is not one of those things. The thought of bears or wolves stalking you festers in the back of your mind in the same way that you’re afraid of the bogeyman. You want to believe nothing is there, but in the same way you’re scared of something in your closet; you can’t be sure what lays in waiting in the dark. 

 

The woods at night are something that I’m still learning to be comfortable with. There are always a few constants though. You can expect some light rustling, small animals scurrying away from you, or the sounds of birds and bugs standing out into the night. People forget, but in the wild, animals know exactly when they do and don’t want to be heard. 

 

And tonight, I heard nothing. 

 

No birds, no crickets, any rustling in the leaves was from the wind. All I could hear was the clicking of the revolver as I held my hand over it. I kept a brisk pace, not wanting to stay long. As I got closer though, the faintest sound occupied the air. It was a droning sound, a low, constant vibration, but quiet enough to just feel like it was creeping into my skull.  

 

I only made it halfway to the site before being stopped though. 

 

There was a call, like a doe’s… but not quite. I’m not stupid; teenage campers always love to talk about “skin walkers” in these woods to try and scare each other. Park rangers like us are all numb to it though, but in that moment, I felt the air escape my lungs as I stared towards the direction I heard it. 

 

I heard it again and tried to make more sense of it. It was coming from a deer, it had to, but it sounded in pain. We’ve had to deal with a lot of deer that’ve had accidents on the road, and that noise was right where my mind went to. It always sickened me, the way the poor animal calls out, begging for something to make the pain stop, helpless to save itself. But it didn’t make sense- we were miles away from any main road. 

 

I pushed my panic deeper down and approached the agonized being. At the edge of my light’s reach, I saw it. I was right; it was a deer. It was collapsed on the ground, wailing out and writhing. My first guess was that it had just been attacked by something, but as I got closer, there were no clear signs of attack. 

 

There wasn’t any blood on or around the animal. I looked at the neck of it though and was startled. I was already expecting a visceral scene. Any predator would’ve gone for the throat, tearing at the major arteries, but there were no signs of external damage. But there was something very wrong. 

 

The neck of the poor thing was swollen, so much so that it couldn’t turn its head, barely being able to lift it to even breathe. Its jaw had been dislocated, forcing it to open to an unnatural degree. Every breath was strained and forced, choking on itself, every muscle twitching as if it were screaming for oxygen. It was a fighter; I could tell from the terrified look in its eyes—it was scared.  

 

The body spasmed out, the once aggressive kicking turned to paralyzing twitching in its legs, but still it was still wheezing. It called out again… but this was different. It was less pained, less panicked, and more… harmonized. It no longer sounded like a cry of pain. It just sounded wrong. The pitch was way too low, there was little variation, almost soothing. It stayed like that- still trembling, as if fighting to get out of its own skin. 

 

But regardless, its lungs filled, and it let out that same monotone call. 

 

I didn’t like what I was looking at. It made me sick. It looked the same as someone overdosing, the way they lose control of their body, eyes wide as if looking for some way out of the comatose state. It’s something I’d never wanted to see again, and there I was watching every single second of this thing losing control. I was so disgusted that I didn’t even realize the call it was making... it was starting to sound like the same hum I heard from within the tower.  

 

I had every right to put it down, if anything it was my duty. It was suffering. But I couldn’t; I was frozen in place. Looking into the desperate eyes of this animal terrified me. The longer I stood there, the more I felt a headache coming on; it sickened me. I just wanted to get away from it, so that’s what I did. As I left the call of that thing reminded me of my cowardice, growing fainter with every step but never fully going away. It felt like the noise just stayed in my ear and refused to leave me, nor did the headache.  

 

After about another mile I finally approached the campsite. I expected to find a family or a group of friends. I didn’t know what to expect, maybe they were disheveled by the crash, maybe they hadn’t even noticed it at all. But there was nothing. I called out, stated that I was a park ranger, and that there was some ‘weird activity’ in the area. (What the hell would you call it?) But I never got a response. There was a fire lit, tents pitched, and even some beer cans out with lawn chairs. 

 

There were people here. Where the fuck were they? 

 

I hesitated for a second. Walking onto the site felt like walking into a crime scene—like a moment frozen in history. Despite that, I put one foot forward. 

 

“Hellooo?” I called out, my flashlight darted across every dark corner, hand over my holster. I approach the fire; its crackling being the only noise radiating in the silent woods. There was still something cooking in a pot; baked beans. They looked fresh, only being a little bit burnt. I was barely holding it together; I was terrified. 

 

It’s not obvious, but I’ve gone through it. Anyone that knows me and they’ll say I’m a tough bitch, but this mixed with the growing tension in my head was beginning to make me lose my cool. I called out my identification louder, and surprisingly, I got a response. From within one of the tents I heard a groan. 

 

It was a person, probably hurt. 

 

I hustled to the tent and lifted the flap—my stomach dropped. Have you ever seen someone choking? It’s the primal realization that you’re losing a resource needed to survive, and every animalistic instinct is working to get it back to you. 

 

The camper had ripped his jacket and undershirt open around his collar. His face had gone red and began turning purple. His eyes were red and strained, locking in on me with pure anxiety. His teeth clenched then opened, trying to take deep breaths, but no air came through. I started to step forward to help. His hands were clutched around his neck, almost looking like he was scratching at it. But then I looked; his neck was grossly swollen like the deer’s. I stood terrified, I had no idea what to do. But then, with all his might he was able to barely mutter, 

 

“Help…” 

 

Ignoring my own reasoning, I knelt down to the man and immediately started to tend to him. 

 

“It’s okay, I’ve got you!” I said, I sounded confident, almost confident enough to convince myself I knew what to do. I held his arms down so that I could better inspect his throat. It wasn’t just swollen… it was pulsing, as if something below his skin was warping and shifting, leaving him as a bystander. I stared in disbelief, my guise of competence dropped. 

 

I grab my radio off my hip, “Fire watch Ed, copy!” 

 

“I’m here. How’s it look- “ 

 

“Call emergency services to the D4 campsite NOW! There’s a man who’s asphyxiating, requiring immediate medical ai-“ 

 

I was cut off. I heard something. It wasn’t the man; it wasn’t the fire… it was a hum. It was low, guttural, monotone and artificial, yet it came from something alive. I shifted my weight, trying to listen closer. 

 

“Amanda, can you repeat? I’m getting some interference, over.” 

 

I clutch my radio and raise it up to my lips and whisper. 

 

“Get rescue services here NOW. There’s something here.” 

 

The man across from me in the tent is still gasping for air—desperate, but silent. He had to wait. I creep closer to the tent’s entrance and peek outside, carefully moving the tarp to peek through the fabric. 

 

It wasn’t a bear; I knew it wasn’t. You’d hear a bear, the way it breathes, the weight of its body moving; this wasn’t that. It was just… a melancholic hum droning, constant and resonant. My heart dropped—it was worse than a bear. 

 

On the other side of the fire I saw its outline, long and tan against the glow of the warm light; it was a mountain lion. Bears were deadly in a direct sense. They overpower every animal in every way, but these are different. Big cats are menacing; they plan, they stalk, they think. Bears will kill you. Big cats know the best way to kill you. I fell back on my ass, catching myself, making sure to cover my mouth before I could make a noise. 

 

It didn’t make sense though; it was making a noise—that hum—it should not be able to make that. I tried to make sense of it, but my head was pounding, I could barely focus as it was. I grab my revolver out of the holster. I cock the hammer back and look out again. It wasn’t moving... it just stood there. It appeared planted in one spot, but it was spasming; its limbs and back were trembling as if its nervous system were on fire. Despite that, it stood straight. But I couldn’t see its head well past the fire. I didn’t have a clean shot. It just stood there, letting out that horrible, gross droning noise. 

 

The headache was getting worse; I felt a migraine coming on that made it hard to keep my eyes open. The stress was getting to me. Regardless though, I kept my eyes locked on the beast, waiting for a clean shot. Suddenly, the man called out behind me. 

 

I whipped my head around, and the strain was gone from his eyes; they looked empty. Despite that, his lungs filled with air, and out his mouth came another groan, off and strained, but at the same pitch as the big cat. 

 

I whipped back around to look at the cat. It wasn’t by the fire. 

 

I shifted my glance to the right, and I saw it there, standing no more than 5 feet from the tent. It was shambling, sloppily putting one foot in front of the other. But it wasn’t right. 

 

I don’t know what I saw, but it’s head… 

 

It looked like the skull of the animal was snapped backwards at the base of the neck, its top jaw just facing out. The lower jaw was just barely hanging on like a useless ligament. The vocal cords and throat muscles of the beast had swollen and distorted, pushing grotesquely against the skin near where the head should be. In the throat cavity I could see the exposed larynx; it was jittering with the horrible humming that bellowed through the air. It’s like this animal was taken and turned into a vessel, an instrument to play that horrible resonance. 

 

I was horrified—my head splitting to the point I felt my vision begin to blur. I didn’t know what to do. Was it even alive? Would my gun even do anything? I tried to hold it up, but the pain in my skull kept me from being able to hold it straight. I stumbled back towards the man who was still attempting to call out and I grabbed him. It’s like he was ratting me out. After getting behind him, I covered his mouth with my hand and tried to squeeze my arm around his throat. I know it seemed counterproductive, but I had to silence him. 

 

The tent was still open though; the tarp just draped over the entrance. It was taking every fiber of my being to hold myself together. The man’s body started convulsing as I held him, but I kept him quiet, holding back tears as the malformed cat approached the tent. I could see its shadow approaching, backlit from the fire. Its paw pushed against the loose tarp; its claws fully extended, as if its entire body was contracted and flexed. The hum was earsplitting now; I felt it in my head. It was in me, bouncing against the walls of my skull. I couldn’t think, if anything, I felt myself falling apart. I couldn’t focus; I felt on the verge of passing out. 

 

But then, it stopped. 

 

The beast recoiled away from the tent and scurried off. As the sound of helicopter blades appearing overhead. I leaned back, sobbing as the wave of relief washed over me—my arms still tense around the man’s body. 

 

 

We evacuated with the helicopter. They had the man on a stretcher to try to stabilize his condition while we rode to the nearest hospital. He doesn’t look great. He was seizing for the entire ride. The EMT’s asked about anyone else, but I had no idea what’s happened to the rest of his party. 

 

Once we got to the hospital, the doctors inspected him, and they were more confused than I was. His vitals were far from normal. His heart was beating, he was breathing—but he was brain-dead. It made no sense; he just kept letting out that same fucking humming. 

 

I was bombarded with a rigorous series of questions as to what happened, like I have any clue what just happened. And honestly, I feel like shit. My migraine has eased but only slightly and the sound of that fucking hum is still wrecking my head; it won’t go away. 

 

Stay away from the woods; it’s not safe there. And please, for the love of God, stay away from anything that sounds like what I described. There is something VERY WRONG out there. Please, if anyone has any idea what’s going on, I need to know. I feel my mind slipping. I need to know it’s going to be okay. 

 

I’m so scared.
