It was a cold, moonless night when Emily arrived at her grandmother’s old house. The property had been abandoned for years, standing at the edge of a small, forgotten village. As a child, she had visited often, but it was only now, after her grandmother’s death, that she returned to claim what was left of the family estate.

The house stood tall and foreboding, wrapped in creeping ivy. Its windows were dark, like hollow eyes watching her. The villagers had warned her about the place. They whispered of strange happenings, unexplained noises, and a lingering darkness. But Emily, ever the skeptic, dismissed their superstitions as nothing more than old folklore.

Inside, the air was thick with dust and silence. Her footsteps echoed through the vast, empty halls, disturbing the stillness. The house felt alive, as though it had been waiting for her return. As she explored each room, memories flooded back—her grandmother's voice, soft and comforting, the smell of baked bread, and the warmth of the fireplace. But there was something else, something she had forgotten.

By the time the sun had fully set, the house seemed to take on a life of its own. The old wooden floors creaked under her weight, and the walls groaned with the wind. Yet, there was no wind.

Emily decided to spend the night. She had driven too far to leave now, and besides, she wasn’t afraid of an old, empty house. She settled into her grandmother’s bedroom, the only room that still felt somewhat familiar. As she drifted into a restless sleep, she heard it—a faint whisper, like a voice calling her name.

"Emily…"

Her eyes snapped open. She lay still, straining to hear. The whisper came again, this time clearer.

"Emily… come…"

Her heart raced. Was it a dream? She tried to ignore it, telling herself it was just her imagination playing tricks on her. But the whisper grew louder, persistent, beckoning her. Unable to resist, she got up and followed the sound.

It led her down the hallway, to a door at the end. She had forgotten about this room, one her grandmother had always kept locked. But now, the door stood ajar. The whisper came from inside.

With trembling hands, she pushed the door open. The room was dark, save for the faint glow of moonlight seeping through the curtains. In the center stood an old, full-length mirror. As she stepped closer, the whisper stopped.

For a moment, she saw nothing unusual in the mirror—just her reflection staring back at her. But then, something shifted. Her reflection smiled, though she had not. A chill ran down her spine. Slowly, the reflection raised its hand, pressing it against the glass.

Emily stepped back in horror. The reflection began to speak, its voice the same whisper that had called her.

"You left us… but we never left you."

Panic surged through her. She turned to run, but the door slammed shut with a deafening thud. Trapped, she spun back to the mirror, where her reflection now stared at her with dark, hollow eyes.

"You belong to us now," it whispered, its voice dripping with malice.

The last thing Emily saw before everything went black was her reflection stepping out of the mirror, a twisted smile on its face, as the room filled with the sound of sinister, echoing whispers.

When the villagers found the house the next morning, Emily was gone. All that remained was a dusty old mirror, reflecting nothing but darkness.
