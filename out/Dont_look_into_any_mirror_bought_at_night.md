It was my uncle’s housekeeper that informed me he’d gone missing, being that I was the only relative to have kept in contact with him over the years. The others, it seemed, had been consumed by their own busy lives or else were too disturbed by my uncle's eccentricities to visit.

Over time Silas had developed an obsession with collecting objects of spiritual and paranormal interest, amassing such a number of them that he had become something of a hoarder.

I’d been the one to employ his housekeeper, Clare, ignoring my uncle’s grumbling protests; nearing his late seventies he was in need both of help cleaning his home and of company, the benefits of which he came grudgingly to enjoy.

He even offered Clare a room in the upper floors of the house which due to his worsening arthritis he seldom used, and so I was satisfied that if anything were to happen there would at least be an able-bodied person at hand to help him.

What I did not expect was to learn from a panicked phone call that my uncle had vanished from the house sometime the previous day and could not be found.

I went over at once, thinking it unlikely that he’d gotten far on his bad hip, and certainly not without being noticed; my uncle always dressed in an eccentric fashion, leading him to become something of an icon referred to by the locals as ‘the Wizard of Goad Street’.

Upon my arrival at the house I found Clare looking red-eyed and agitated, which was unusual for a woman I’d always found to be reassuringly bland.

“I don’t have a clue where he went,” she said. “I didn’t hear any of the doors opening, but I’ve looked for him all over and I can’t see him anywhere. I don’t know what he’s thinking. He’s been acting so strange this past week.”

“Stranger than usual?” I asked, glancing around the living room.

There were new additions to my uncle’s trove including a Victorian lamp and what I took to be a large mirror hung up and covered by a fringe shawl. Peering in its direction I felt an odd pull towards it, the urge to tug down that sheathe of fabric in order to look into the glass beneath. 

Choosing to ignore it, I said, “What do you mean by strange anyway, Clare?”

She turned up her hands in a helpless motion.

“He went out in the middle of the night last Thursday, to start with. I asked him where he was going, and he said it was some kind of antiques emporium that wouldn’t open at any other time. Only after dark, he said— well, there are places like that now. Night cafés, book shops. They’re opening all over town, now. So I said I’d drive him there and parked up outside, waiting for him to come out.”

Clare’s eyes shifted to the mirror, and I realised that it was she that had hidden it. That she could barely stand to have it in the room. 

I wondered why. Unlike the absent relations Clare had never been remotely superstitious and had only shaken her head at my uncle’s insistence that the alleged histories of his treasures were a reality. 

“I didn’t like the look of the place,” said Clare. “It was in a run-down area, and the windows were filthy. But the shop was open and Silas went in. He was gone for about half an hour, and I started wondering if I should go in after him. Then he came out with a package under his arm wrapped up in paper, and when I got out of the car to help him he wouldn’t let me touch it.”

Clare pulled her cardigan tighter around herself, seeming chilled despite the August heat.

“Silas insisted on hanging the mirror himself and spent a good hour just standing there looking at it. I couldn’t work out what he was doing, but it gave me the creeps. In the end I told him to come away from it, and he stared at me as though he’d forgotten I was even there.

I asked him what he was doing, and he said he’d been told by one of the salespeople at the shop that the mirror would change him. How exactly I don’t know, but I think he was hoping it would help him with his walking. He’s getting on now; old people have a lot to worry about.”

“So it’s a magic mirror, then,” I said, half-laughing. “Christ. He really is getting worse, isn’t he?”

Clare’s mouth didn’t even twitch.

“I couldn’t even look at the mirror, myself,” she said. “Not straight on, anyway. Once your uncle went up to bed I hid it away and put the receipt in the drawer. I kept thinking I should just take it back. Every day I’d catch Silas pulling that shawl up to look in the glass— well, it can’t have been doing him any good, standing around for so long like that.

I noticed him getting stiff, limping about with a sort of hunch. Even his face— it was going all lopsided. I was getting concerned about his health. I was going to call the doctor, but then Silas went missing, so I came to you instead.”

I cleared a box of miscellaneous junk off a nearby chair and offered it to Clare, noting how pale she’d turned over the course of the conversation. She took it gratefully.

“You say you’ve looked all over the house for him,” I said. “Both floors.”

“I have.”

“What about the neighbours? They have security cameras; maybe he was picked up in some of the footage.”

“Oh, I’ve already been round and asked. Nothing. I’ve spoken to the police, but they weren’t taking it too seriously. I can’t explain it. It’s like he’s just disappeared, but obviously he can’t have done, can he? I know that.”

Hearing the distress in Clare’s voice I found a box of tissues on the table and passed it over to her.

“It’s alright,” I said. “He’ll turn up. I might try and visit the antique shop, see if I can speak to the owner or whoever works there and see what exactly they told my uncle about the mirror. If there’s some ritual they’ve told him to do then maybe he’s gone out to perform it and gotten lost. Wouldn’t be the first time he’s wandered off like this.”

Clare dabbed pitifully at her face with the sodden tissue.

“I know. It’s just I have this awful feeling. I wish I could just throw that thing away.”

This directed at the mirror, which, unable to restrain my curiosity, I crossed the room to examine for myself.

It wasn’t very large, the frame of a black gilt, the glass murky, not with dirt but with the effect of a window looking out into a dark fog.

There again was that unpleasant sense of needing to be close to it almost against my will, and before I knew it I was staring into the mirror at my reflection, which had been so warped by the glass that my left eye seemed to have been pulled down my face by an invisible hand.

Then Clare was tugging at my shoulder and attempting to shield the mirror with the old shawl once again.

“Don’t look at it,” she said, and couldn’t say why, only stared at me, her eyes pleading, defeated.

She wouldn’t leave my side until I’d left the room, ushered into the study in which the receipts for Silas’ collection had been kept for many years. It was the only room he’d insisted on having any particular organisation, stating the importance of holding onto every record of purchase in case ‘something was wrong’, or ‘went wrong’, the necessity of the distinction passing me by.

I found the receipt for the mirror in a drawer marked ‘E’. Elsken’s Emporium had apparently sold the item to my uncle for three figures, which I considered shockingly overpriced. There was a phone number on the receipt—which, when tried, wasn’t functional—and an address pointing to the outskirts of a nearby village.

A thorough internet search found no report of the shop’s existence in the area, nor was there any record of the business itself having been registered.

There was nothing to be done except visit the emporium myself during opening hours and hope that Silas turned up in the meantime.

I drove into the village that evening, finding the shop at the end of a street populated mainly by shuttered windows, a barber’s shop and a nail bar closed for the evening at the far end. Other than that there was very little nearby but rows of terraced houses and a strip of dreary countryside bisected by the road.

Approaching the emporium—which was as dingy and unwelcoming as Clare had described—I saw that it, too, was closed, only the nearby streetlight illuminating the windows.

The furniture within was in boxes or covered with dust sheets, clearly intended to be packed up and taken away, but there were still several mirrors left up on the walls, all with the same unpleasant quality as that which my uncle had taken home with him.

There was clearly nobody inside the shop, and likely hadn’t been for several days. 

A voice piped up from behind me, confirming my suspicions. 

“They’ve been shut since last week. Not even been there that long and it seems like they’ve given up already.”

A middle-aged woman stood with a baby on her hip at her front doorstep, watching me with interest.

“So they’re shutting down?” I said. “It’s weird that they even set up here to start with. Not as if they’ve made it easy for them to be found.”

The woman nodded eagerly.

“Exactly what I said. Probably a front for something— money laundering, maybe. They had a fair few customers, mind you, and they all looked the type to be interested in all that esoteric stuff. I had a look in there myself, but it wasn’t for me. The staff were a bit odd, as well. Very over keen. Seemed desperate to be rid of everything.”

I looked into the shop again, furrowing my brow. ‘Esoteric’, the woman had said, but I began to notice symbols and wicked little faces on the spines of books and carved into the woodwork of chairs, and knew that what the clients sought was magic.

Though I myself didn’t believe in it I saw clearly where my uncle’s recent behaviour had sprung from.

“Did you ever see the owner at all?” I asked. “I’ve been wanting to talk to him, but it’s like he doesn’t exist.”

At this the woman took on the same look I’d seen on Clare’s face, and the baby began to fuss, picking up on the change in her mood.

“Me and my daughter both saw him,” said the woman. “The owner. Early Friday morning while it was still dark— we were up with the baby, having a cup of tea, when my daughter said, ‘who’s that?’ And pointed out of the window over there.”

At this the woman gestured to the street, her finger tracing up and down as though following the movements of an unseen figure.

“There was a man heading up to the door, only he wasn’t walking, more going along on his hands with his legs dragging behind him— I thought, well, maybe he’s been in an accident or something. I was going to help him get into the shop— I saw he had the keys in his pocket and realised he must be locking up.

My daughter stopped me from going out. ‘There’s something wrong with him’, she said. ‘Something doesn’t feel right.’

So we stood and watched him, and I could see what she meant by it. It’s like his body wasn’t properly human, and he was just trying to pass it off that way. Like putting an animal in a costume.

His arms were turned round wrong, his legs twisted into each other and held up off the ground like the back end of a beetle. And the way he moved— it was like it hurt, but he was quick. Must have been used to it.

When he got to the door I couldn’t think how he’d get the key in the lock, but he just reared up against the wall, twitching about. Then he must have realised we were watching because suddenly he turned to look round over his shoulder, and his face—”

The woman made a twisting gesture with her hand I couldn’t distinguish and shrugged her shoulders.

“I can’t describe it,” she said. “My daughter couldn’t either when we were talking about it afterwards. It was just— horrible. I was glad I’d not gone out in the end. I just have a feeling something would have happened. I don’t know what.”

She shifted the baby to the other hip, jiggling it up and down to soothe it.

"I'd leave all this," she said to me. "Don't go looking for that man. Just leave him alone. Don't buy any of his stuff, either. Like I said, I have no idea what he was up to, but I wouldn't want to be involved."

I sighed, realising I'd arrived at another dead end. 

"I'll keep that in mind," I said. "Doesn't look like the shop will reopen again, anyway."

I made a move to return to my car, only the woman stopped me, her expression softer, maternal.

"I hope you don't mind me asking, love,” she said, “but have you recently had a stroke?"

I burst out laughing, too surprised to be immediately insulted. True, I wasn't the most good-looking man, but I certainly wasn’t ugly enough to have ever anticipated receiving that type of remark.

"I wasn't trying to be rude," said the woman hastily, clearly embarrassed. "It's just my husband had one a few years ago, and I just thought— never mind. Sorry if I've caused offence."

She scurried back into the house, but I saw her again at the front window, watching me as I drove away, her face almost touching the glass.

Upon returning to my uncle’s home I went to the mirror again and lingered before it for some time, lost in thought.

The mysteries I’d failed to solve had nipped at me endlessly since leaving the village, yet all thoughts left me then but the mirror and the strange, warped quality of the glass, which had apparently called people like my uncle to pay great amounts in order to possess it.

I only stepped away from the mirror upon hearing Clare enter the room, throwing the shawl back down with the clumsy velocity of a child caught in some misdeed.

“Adrian,” said Clare, and at once I was alert to a hysteria in her, held at bay by considerable restraint. “I think I’ve heard your uncle somewhere in the house.”

Relief came to me in such a rush that I felt almost ill.

“Well, thank god for that,” I said. “Where is he?”

“In one of the studies, I think. He must have been hiding on purpose for me not to have seen him, but I don’t know. I’ve not dared open the door.”

“What?” I said. “Why not?”

Clare’s eyes flicked across my face, then away again, unable to settle. 

“Just come with me,” she said, her tone odd. “If he’s hurt I’ll need help to lift him.”

I followed, thinking that my uncle’s mind had gone, or that his joints had given way at last. Clare showed me into the study, lit only by a desk lamp that cast a greenish light across the room.

I saw the objects littering the ornate desk in the right-hand corner had been knocked on their sides or off the surface entirely by the force of something crawling rapidly beneath.

That something was still there; I could smell a body unwashed, dirty clothes, and another scent I couldn’t identify but that I felt I knew.

“Uncle?” I said, bending down slightly. “Are you there? It’s Adrian.”

I heard the shuffling of fabric dragged against floorboards, the mumbling of what I took to be my name. Then a head protruded from the shadows under the desk, and as I stooped down level with it I saw my uncle as he now was.

I thought of the woman I’d met in the street, the bizarre wrenching gesture of her hand in the air. That was how my uncle appeared, his jaws having been wrenched to an upright angle, yellow teeth cutting through the thin epidermis of his cheek, his limbs suffering an inexplicable torsion and near impossible to use. 

His eyes had been crushed in the pinched pricks of his sockets, blinding him completely; there was nothing in that inner gloom but fluid and the remnants of what strands had held the organs in.

I would have thought Silas to have been struck by a car had I not known he’d never left the house, that this change had come about from within.

“It’s that mirror,” said Clare at a near scream. “He stared at it for so long that it did this to him.”

“It can’t have been the mirror,” I said faintly. “I looked at it as well and nothing’s happened to me.”

But then I saw that Clare had frightened tears in her averted eyes, and an urgency to see myself took over me.

At a run I went to look at the mirror over the bathroom sink, my fingers scratching about for the light.

Then I saw my face and turned away, appalled, holding the wreck of it in my hands.

Every feature had been reshaped, deformed as though a fish hook had been caught in each and yanked in the direction of the rod. 

I realised, then, that the woman in the street had tried to help me, and why the crooked man that she had seen had left the shop abandoned, fleeing the customers that would come after him, wanting his work undone.

Finding bandages in the bathroom cupboard I bound my face with them, unable to bear the sight of it or the thought that I might be seen by others.

I sent Clare on leave to her sister’s for the week and locked myself into my uncle’s house to search his many books on the occult for some way to undo the curse that had stricken us. 

Online sources I disregarded entirely, being that I suspected the majority would have been written by aspiring authors or fantasists convinced of their inexistent magical prowess. 

I cared for Silas as well as I could in this time, but I accepted that if I was unable to help him within the next few days he was likely to die, food unable to pass down the buckled cartilage of his throat.

From the slow process of working through my uncle’s library I gained a vague understanding of the rules of the mirror's curse.

That the emporium insisted on operating through such unusual hours implied that it must be sold in person and by night for its effects on the item’s previous owner to be reversed— yet whether the curse had, in fact, been lifted from the store owner or not I did not know, and had no way of finding out.

That was, no way without selling the glass myself under the same circumstances, but being that my uncle was its official owner I was uncertain if trading it on his behalf would much improve our circumstances.

Silas was in no fit state to attempt the sale himself; though he seemed responsive to all I said to him he was in too much pain to clearly speak or move more than a few laboured feet.

Realising how few options were left to me I created an online store listing for the mirror using a passably similar stock photograph, offering it at a mid-range price and for collection only.

It was some days before a buyer latched on and made the purchase, yet before two hours had passed an attack of guilt took over me and I hastily refunded the order.

It occurred to me that my conscience would be lighter if I ensured the sale of the mirror was to someone worthy of disfigurement rather than an innocent stranger. However, being that I'd aided many so-called 'bad people' in my work as a lawyer I couldn't bring myself to justify the act.

In hindsight perhaps I should have thrown my scruples to the wind and been done with it all, but by then my mind had wandered to other possibilities surrounding the mirror and its purpose.

The storeowner had gone through overly complex measures to part with it, ones that would take far more time and effort than would readily be available to a desperate man.

The greater likelihood was that each of the items I'd seen through the greasy window of the emporium had contained the same evil, and had been sold for evil's sake. What other reason would the man have to torment others into his own image than bitterness, after all?

In writing I’m no closer to knowing which of my theories was correct, or if there was another yet that I had not thought of.

In the days counting down to my uncle’s end the impossibility of our situation lay over me, and when one night I stood up, raw-eyed with lack of sleep from my research, I decided that the mirror had to go. Whatever bad luck came of its disposal could not be any worse than what I’d suffered, I thought.

Besides, there were several articles that suggested the breaking and disposing of cursed glass was the safest course of action, and I chose to take their word for it. I was only to throw salt over my shoulder, spin three times counter clockwise, or dash the ruined shards into running water afterwards to avoid the seven-year ill-tidings. 

There were more rules to this barely tapped into world of magic than I ever cared to learn.

I didn't warn my uncle as to what I was about to do, thinking that it would only distress him, being that he couldn't prevent me even if he disagreed with my plan.

Entering the living room I picked up one of the chairs stacked around the cluttered table and gingerly approached the covered glass, feeling as I now always did a black pressure emanating from it.

I left the shawl where it was, thinking—perhaps irrationally—that if the mirror saw me it would try, in some way, to prevent me from attacking it. So as I raised the chair above my head I did not see the thing break, only heard the crash as my weapon collided with it and the ringing of all its little dead pieces along the floor.

As they did so a scream tore across the house, and for an awful moment I was convinced that it was the glass. Only when I noted the direction of that cry did I realise who it was and ran for the study, stopping just short at the sight of blood weeping along the floor.

I had no choice but to step through it as I opened the study door, realising at once the scale of my mistake.

Silas’ body had turned over and over itself in rings of bulging flesh, reminding me of a series of images I’d once come across of a factory worker caught and twisted to death in the axis of a machine. 

My uncle’s organs had been thrust out through the mouth by force, and as one last twitch shuddered through him I understood that he had lived to the end of it; the curse had allowed him that, I saw, a spiteful burst of strength. 

Only as my shock lost its grip on me did I feel the blood on my own face leaking through the bandages, felt as I raised my shaking hands to touch them how my features had changed.

I was too afraid to take the coverings off and look at myself, and still am.

In fact, I do not know if I can ever bear to look at myself again.
