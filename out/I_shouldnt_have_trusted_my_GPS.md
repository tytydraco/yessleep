It was a warm summer night in the back county of South Carolina. I recently moved from the North so I wasn’t familiar with how to get around yet. I had just had dinner with my grandparents and cousins, and was in the middle of my 45 minute drive back to my apartment. I always keep my phone on a holder while driving, and only touch it when i’m skipping through music. 

It started with my GPS malfunctioning, ending my map & destination, and then suddenly going back to normal. I didn’t think anything of it due to some spots having crappy cell service. I continued to drive down the road, bouncing my head to 2000s throwbacks, and occasionally sipping my Red Bull. I have a habit of unconsciously checking the time when I go to check how fast I’m driving. That’s when I noticed my clock was an hour behind. I immediately tapped my phone, which showed the time. Two hours behind. I instantly grew confused. I thought I had left just after 6pm, and it was now nearly 8pm. Suddenly, my GPS froze, and I desperately tried to fix the jam..all while driving down a dark road, the only light came from my headlights. Then, my GPS turned back on. 

The GPS popped back on, and began re-routing me. I thought nothing of it, since I had no idea where I was. I continued to drive, following the directions until I eventually reached a dark, dirt road, surrounded by trees. My stomach started to churn, and I grew extremely uneasy and fear struck my body. I frantically looked around for some way to make a u-turn out, when my car slowed to a stop. In the middle of the dirt road. Then, my car completely turned off, keys still in the ignition, bluetooth disconnected, phone silent. The feeling in my stomach grew stronger. Every bone in my body was telling me:

“Get out. Now.” 

I frantically looked around, trying to pinpoint where I could go, what I could do, how I could defend myself if needed. My car slowly started to fill with a foul, vomit inducing stench, like flesh that was rotting from the inside out. I gagged, and nearly threw up. The nerves, the stench, and the fear all building up as bile in my throat. I wanted to leave. 

Then, I heard it. Moaning. Loud, guttural moaning that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I quickly looked around, and at this point, I was preparing for the worst. The moaning continued until it sounded like it was right beside my car. 

As soon as I turned my head, I was staring at a dark, terrifying sillouhette. The moonlight made it difficult to see at first, until I noticed the shape. A deer. I had seen many deer in my life, but none of them had this shape. From what I could see, its neck was longer…thicker..Its back was slightly sunken in. I saw its antlers which extended straight up. What happened next made me sick. 

As if the deer wasn’t terrifying enough, it slowly stood up. All of its animal-like features were gone, aside from the head. I whimpered and at this point, I could feel my seat dampening, and my jeans soaking. I had urinated myself. The entity stood up, and walked past the front of my car, like any other human before it faded into the darkness of the forest. As soon as I could no longer see it, my car turned back on, and the music continued, bumping Britney Spears through my Bass. The feeling of dread and sickness began to pass, and running on pure adrenaline, I ripped my gear into reverse, drove off the road, hitting some bushes and sped towards back towards the entrance. I was panting. My hands were shaking, and my pants were soaked, but I didn’t care. The second I pulled out onto the main road, my GPS went back to its original route, and resumed the drive. 37 minutes. I was 37 minutes away from home. I continued driving, and I quickly dialed my Boyfriend’s number, not caring about my ‘no hands’ rule. My boyfriend answered. 

“Hey, you on your way home?” 

I immediately began pouring out everything that happened. The car shutting off, the figure, the smell, everything. 

My boyfriend ended up staying on the call with me until I got home, and when I returned to our apartment, he ended up checking my engine, my oil, my tires, everything, trying to find an explanation. 

I knew he was worried beyond belief, and the fact that I peed myself only heightened his concern. My car was dinged up with some minor scratches, but everything seemed alright, and functioning. 

Later that night, after I had showered, changed into my favorite pajama set and watched our favorite Twitch streamer, I pulled out my phone, and began the GPS to my Nana & Papa’s house. I probably spent an hour trying to find the dirt road I was on. The road where everything happened. But there was nothing. I even went into street view and tapped along my entire route.

No dirt road. No location that even remotely resembled the road I had driven down.
