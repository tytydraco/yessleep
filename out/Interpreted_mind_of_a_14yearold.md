Is this real or fake? I don’t know I’m just someone trying to compile their thoughts in the one journal that might be able to be ascertained or read by the normal man whatever that means and punctuation no. Just words if you want to try to understand any of this, we should probably start at the beginning day one.

The hospital or smaller the hospital room is fixated on the emergence of life fixated upon the room that it started it’s life in no one knows if the baby will die that day or live long and beautiful life. All they know is that it started there in the room and in the hospital in the country in the world in the solar system in the galaxy in the galaxy cluster, and the universe itself, and what’s beyond the universe only God knows or is there a God house with the universe create such beautiful life if there wasn’t one, how could stability come from chaos if there was nothing to stabilize it How did the human mind learn to create itself? How did the cells remember to make the mind? How did the DNA know it should be


After that, the family gets the kid if it survives and goes home  many people terrorize. How rare is it to get to this point to be of living breathing child but no matter the odds you’re maybe not fully cognizant, but what signifies that I would say it’s still pretty impressive. On average you have around a 1% chance of dying in a car crash every time you go somewhere, thank how much that adds up and that’s only driving think of all the ways that you could’ve, and should’ve died but it’s only been a day now it’s night time you go to bed with your family 

Day two waking up how cold you are just a little baby you screamed so loud and so shrill your parents never thought it would be possible for such a little beautiful thing to make such a horrific noise but it’s cause you were hungry. You haven’t eaten in a while so your mom breaths feeds you. And you’re happy you have a mother and father and everything’s good what is good just that feeling that you get every once a while what is a feeling What are emotions what is being conscious a couple hours pass and you go to the bathroom you can’t walk so you just go no cares in the world you don’t know what the world is or maybe do how should I know 

Day three you were sleeping you had a long day yesterday, even though the events seem so short and far between it’s still felt like eternity, eternity is it never ending? Is there always eternity even when we’re not looking at it or do we have to know that it’s forever for it to be real if there was no cognizant beings in this world to know what am I saying? What am I thinking I don’t know who am I what am I the child? There’s so many loud noises outside or inside loud noises one’s high pitched in one is low pitched. The low pitched one stays low. It’s not loud it’s sad the high-pitched one fires at it constantly like it’s mad mad at something or does it just hate the other why is this happening? I don’t know I don’t care. I just want to sleep.
