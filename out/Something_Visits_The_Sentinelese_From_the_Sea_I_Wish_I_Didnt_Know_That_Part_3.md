“How will you ensure that we’re protected?”



“What do you mean?”



“People will find us if they see our faces…if you tell or show them where we live…”



“Oh we’ll blur your faces and change your voice and use mock names for your village…”



Setu looked at me with a certain suspicion, and I already knew how he was feeling. We were driving back from the pond, and he had been awfully quiet. And I knew why he didn’t believe me…it was because I hadn’t considered this. The documentary was a huge lie for me, a ruse to get him and his parents to tell the story I was grievously itching to know, but now that he had brought up this point and now that I knew I had to send this footage to Carl, I had to come up with something. 



“Tell you what, after your father and mother’s interview is done, I’ll show you the final footage that I’ll be sending back to my team? When you’re satisfied that your identity is totally hidden, that is when we hit send…”



Setu smiled, so did Bala and for a moment, I felt I wasn’t betraying them. Going back to drop Setu was easy, but leaving his home, however, was extremely difficult. Even though I had initially hated Mr. Sastry, I now saw him in a different light, and maybe he saw I was looking at him differently, too, because when Mrs. Sastry and Setu wouldn’t let us stay in a hotel, he never stopped them. That’s the thing about here, people are hospitable to a point where you are forced to make some sacrifices.



 After having spent the entire evening on the hot and humid coast of the local pond, I was itching to drown myself in liquor in my hotel room, but they just wouldn’t let me go, and I had to unfortunately spend the night at the mercy of a ceiling fan. Dinner wasn’t bad, though, especially after Setu had told his parents how I planned to keep their identity hidden. That night, though, I decided to call Carl, and I swear the Earth slightly trembled beneath my feet when I heard his voice. I chalked it up to me being tired back then, but now I know better.



“Hey fuckface, how are things?”



“You tell me slut, something tells me your journey to spirituality is still light years away…”



“Yeah about that, I know the investors and…your dad are itching to make some money and I might have an idea…”



“I should’ve known it was business…it’s never, hey buddy what’s up? Wanna play some COD? Maybe get hammered in discord while watching a B grade movie?”



“I only have my Macbook asshole and you know that cuz you took the Lenovo away…”



“Fine go ahead, shoot me the pitch Mr. Director…”



And then it happened. It was like the floodgates to my mind’s reservoir opened, and I spilled everything out. I told Carl everything, how I had been researching the island, how I had studied its history, how we could get exclusive footage, photos and early recordings by paying someone in the government and how if, Setu’s origin as I suspect turned out to be true, we’d have a gold standard documentary on our hands. 



But I don’t remember the words I said, it was as though I was a kid telling my dad about the new Batman action figure I wanted for Christmas after having eyed it in the local store window for the past few months. My mind was completely blank once I was done spilling out my secrets. 



“You know I knew there was something up with you after we left that remote island in Andaman…”



“You did?”



“Yeah lol it was like you met a chic, and you were all glossy eyed when the guy from the boat said that the North Sentinel island was only 20 miles away while I was having one of the worst days of that trip.”



“No you weren't…were you?”





“Yes dude! We left early because I had forgotten my sunscreen, the local mosquito population had practically feasted on me and I had to take a shit on the beach because of the food that day. Don’t you remember they forced me to carry my shit back to the main island so I could properly dispose of it?”



“Yeah Yeah I do..”



I didn’t…



“Anyways it won’t take much to convince the others if you can make this happen. I’ll figure out how to publish this. I might just form a sister company in some country where India can’t prosecute us to keep our hands clean but that’s if we get approved. I wish dad didn’t have oversight on our projects. Hey by the way, this guy Setu…you’re 100% sure he’s the real deal?”







Damn it, the water from my reservoir had swept away Setu’s name….and so I was forced to tell Carl about how concerned the family was for their privacy and that we will need to blur their faces and their voices in the entire thing. 

“Won’t work…”



“What do you mean it won’t work? You see this kind of thing every day.”



“Yeah for criminals dude! People will just think it's all fake and never believe us if we do that! We won’t get past our pitch to the investors if that happens….”



I couldn’t speak for what seemed like a lifetime to me. Another hurdle, how was I going to do this if people didn’t work with me? Carl was supposed to be my friend for god’s sake. 



“Setu shows his face, his family doesn’t, their location and village remains hidden but you don’t get any blurs or hidden locations after once we’re on our way to the island…”



“I can work with that but how are you going to convince the guy to go with you…”



“I’m working on that.”



“Alright dude, send me the footage tomorrow and I’ll get you an answer in the next 48 hours…”



“Cool”



“Goodbye pisshead…oh by the way, Cynthia told Rose you called her…”



“Wait wha–”



He cut the call early, that asshole knew how to get under my skin. I decided not to dwell on it too much, it was already past 11 and tomorrow was going to be a big day, and if I was to catch and film the sunrise, I needed to wake up at 5.



The next day was uneventful, we left Setu’s house while he was still sleeping. His parents were awake, and we had tea together before we left. I had planned to film the sunrise and eventually rest at the hotel I had booked. I could tell they were nervous about being filmed and I had yet to talk to Setu about the privacy thing but I was sure he wouldn’t back down, not after the money I’d offered to pay him…50,000 rupees is a big amount, at least I hope and I could get him more if he asked. But while driving, the car's rattling amidst my silence with Bala strained my eardrums until my thoughts became so loud that I couldn’t take it anymore. I blurted out…



“You haven’t talked much?”



“I’m your guide …I’m just doing my job…”



“C’mon out with it…”



“With what?”



“Whatever has gotten you acting like this?”





“So you do think there’s a reason for me to be this quiet? Well Mr. Big Documentary maker from the US of A why don’t you figure it out?”





“So that’s it, you don’t approve?”



“I don’t think you need my approval…”



I removed my shades and slammed the dashboard like a child, and Bala finally stopped the car and looked me in the eye. 



“What’s your end goal Phillip? Where is this leading us? What do you truly want…”



“I want to make a documentary that shocks and awes the world and makes us rich..”



He kept staring into my eyes as though trying to judge my soul after that response. He didn’t let up, and neither did I…I liked Bala, but not enough to reveal my final plan to him. I hadn’t even told Carl why I wanted to truly go to the island, and I wasn’t about to tell him either. After a long minute or two, he finally sighed…



“Fine…but I care about this innocent family and we’re not putting them in danger.”



I nodded, and then silence took over once again. This conversation had cost us the sunrise, but I didn’t care, I just needed a good nap, and I buried my face in pillows as soon as we reached our hotel. I never bothered to check up on Bala. 



When I woke up, it was already noon, we were late for the interview, and I had around 10 missed calls from Bala. I quickly called him and, realizing that he was already waiting in the car for me, I rushed out with my gear without bathing or brushing my teeth.When I reached the car, I realized that  loyalties had shifted. Bala couldn’t have cared less that I was late, but he called me multiple times because he had been contacted by Mr. Sastry, who seemed furious over the phone. 



When we reached Setu’s home, he demanded that I talk with him in private outside the house. He wasn’t a man of too many words and got straight to business. He was appalled by the offer I’d made to Setu and was frankly disappointed in his son for having accepted it. It turns out that 50,000 rupees is a few months' wage, and for this story, Mr. Sastry wanted an amount that would allow his son to retire.



“That’s too much, Mr. Sastry. I am a small-time filmmaker.”



“I know the exchange rates and I’ve talked to people educated in these matters and I know you’re ripping my son off. You want to make this film? You will agree to the amount I’ve demanded…”



“Give me some time to think about it.”





Mr. Sastry walked back into the house without another word, and I began calculating things. I won’t bore you with the numbers, but Mr. Sastry had demanded 80,00,000 rupees, which is roughly $100,000. This was a huge number. I had only $40,000 in my bank account, but I always knew I’d have to pay up if I wanted this, and I wanted this so bad. So I decided that this was an amount I could pay once Carl had convinced the team. 



We’d have the money if that happened, and moreover, the idea of holding sway over Setu and his family once I handed over the money enticed me. It would make convincing them to let me take him to the island easier. Mr. Sastry came out after a good 30 minutes, and by then I had made my decision. I was simply waiting to finish my cigarette, and when he came out, I offered him one as well. 



“I will agree to that amount but I have one condition?”



He gave me a cold stare and didn’t say a word, and I knew that was my turn to make demands…



“I don’t know where this story will take us but there's a good chance that I might find more survivors like him …so Setu will have to take part in the documentary until I have pieced everything together…”



He didn’t say a word after that, handed the unlit cigarette back to me, and went back inside. At that moment, my heart skipped a beat. Had I been too brash with my offer? Had I revealed my hand? I contemplated every possibility as I finished smoking and headed back inside. 



“They’ve been arguing….” Bala said



“About?”



And he simply shrugged his shoulders. I frantically motioned him to snoop in on their conversation, and he reluctantly tiptoed towards the window near the front door. Minutes later, he returned and told me they were arguing whether they should accept the offer. Mr. Sastry wants to take the money, but Mrs. Sastry fears for her son’s safety. Bala then looked at me and said



“80,00,000 rupees!! Can I be in the documentary?”



I chuckled, “Sure…but even if you aren’t, trust me, I have a bonus planned for you for helping me with everything. Just let me get my people onboard with this plan.”



After what seemed like hours but had already been minutes, Mr. Sastry walked out and nodded, and I knew we were back in business. I set up the cameras next and filmed their interviews. Naturally, both parents were quite reserved with what they divulged about Setu’s rescue and recovery, and so I won’t include the entire transcript, only the points relevant to our story. 



After the rescue, Setu wasn’t treated at a hospital but by someone Mr. Sastry knew closely to prevent the authorities from knowing about him, because just like me, he too suspected that Setu was from the North Sentinel Island. They used to live in the district of Muttukadu back then. It was a relatively remote area, so keeping him away from prying eyes and authorities was relatively easy, but this made Setu’s recovery extremely hard. 



Medicines were difficult to come by, and complicated medical procedures were kind of impossible in the confines of the home. Long story short, it took 30 days for Setu to show some signs of recovery, and during those 30 days, a huge chunk of flesh was taken out of the wound on his back to prevent the infection from spreading further. 



Mr. Sastry also revealed that back in the day, the area around the island wasn’t as heavily patrolled as it is today. It made it easier to fish closer to it, and though illegal, it usually assured much better catches, which is why his boat was in the area that day. I didn’t include such confessions in the footage, and knowing that they could come clean to me without compromising their lives made them feel better.



This is why, maybe when Mr. Sastry had taken a tea break, Mrs. Sastry had told me that she was sure that the wound on Setu’s back had been caused by some sort of a blade or maybe even an Aruval. This was the gist of the relevant information they gave about Setu’s rescue, but there was something that Mrs. Sastry said in the interview that her husband forced her to cut off after she had gone on for long enough, and this is the transcript for that…



“He wasn’t a bad kid but he had his problems. Learning Tamil was difficult for him even though he was young and he hated having to learn English. If what he (points to her husband) suspected was true, then we both understood that he was likely learning a second and third language. Then there was his fear of the sea which we thought was natural after what had happened to him but later after a year we learned that he only feared storms on the sea. And after some time, he and I figured out that Setu feared only a particular kind of storm.



These were storms that would never reach the shore but always caused the government to issue warnings about a potential hurricane during high tides, usually at nights. He had a sixth sense for storms like this because he would intuitively know that there was a storm on the horizon before it happened. He was known to skip school or even run out of it just to hide in his room until the storm passed. That was a difficult time.”



This is when Mr. Sastry had put his hand on Mrs. Sastry’s hand, and it was clear that this was a signal to stop, but I pressed her on and so she continued. I now feel that she too wanted to share Setu’s struggles with the world as a way of boasting all that he had overcome…



“We never knew about sleepwalking but when Setu started experiencing random bouts of it at the age of 10 we had to learn about it from our doctor rather quickly.”



“Anything strange about his sleepwalking sessions?”



She hesitated and then said, “At first we thought they were random. When it happened for the first time, I had woken up in the night to use the washroom only to find Setu was gone. Naturally, I panicked. I woke him up, woke up the neighbors, and we all began searching for him in and around the house. When we couldn’t find him, I feared that my child had been taken or worse kidnapped but while weeping on the footsteps of my old house I saw him walking back as though nothing had happened.



He walked past me like a ghost, never even acknowledged me or any of the people that had gathered in the house. He had to grab and shake Setu and that is when he woke up, began screaming and passed out. We took him to the doctor instantly and that is when he told us that this was sleepwalking and waking Setu up was a very bad idea. We expected this to happen the next day because the doctor had suggested so. But it didn’t and so we alternatively slept next to Setu with a cloth string tied to his and our wrists to ensure that we woke up the next time he sleepwalked. 



The second time it happened, he was sleeping by his side. Like the doctor had instructed, he tried to get Setu to sleep on the bed again and again, but Setu kept going towards the front door as though he was on a mission.”



This is when Mr. Sastry interrupted her and took over. I suspect he didn’t want her to be too detailed about the event…



“I decided I would follow him, see where he leads me and so I walked by his side with the string still attached…it was no safety net but it eased my heart nonetheless. I walked with him out of the village, saw him navigate routes that I knew my 10 year old son didn’t know about until we finally arrived at the beach. He then simply stared out at the sea and so did I. We were there for five to 10 minutes and I tried to walk him back to the house after that but he wouldn’t budge. 



I had no choice but to stand there with him until he walked back like he did the night before and so I waited until the sound of thunder echoed through the sky after a huge bolt of lightning. This happened a second time and then Setu eventually walked back and so did I. I told my wife about what happened and from then on we were always prepared for his bouts of sleepwalking.”



I knew there was more to this, I knew Mr. Sastry was hiding something, but it seemed Mrs. Sastry was content with his version of the tale, so I decided to press him about it off camera. After lunch, I caught him on a smoke break outside, and naturally pressed him about Setu’s sleepwalking. Here’s roughly how that conversation went…



“So…how long did the sleepwalking last?”





“Until he was 13…”



“Was there something strange? Did you notice anything else? Was there…” but before I could say more, he held his hand up and I had to use the only card I had on my side…



“Mr. Sastry I am a small guy and I’ve agreed to pay you a huge amount and If I’m to make some money off of this frankly hobbyist project I’d really appreciate it if you were honest with me …or at least a little less defensive…”



I honestly don’t know where this genuine cry for help came from within me, but I was happy it did regardless, because what Mr. Sastry told me back then sent me spiraling down a rabbit hole that still plagues my mind to this day as I type these words…



“Fine…I know you won’t believe me because neither does she but there was a pattern to his sleepwalking bouts that scared me. I still haven’t told her about the pattern entirely and Setu knows nothing about it.”



“But she knows some?”



He nodded and said, “She knows about the lightning strikes?” 



“What about them?” 



“They always increased by one with each sleepwalking episode until they reached the count of 3…”



“But there’s more?”



“Yes, because I remember the storm the night I rescued Setu. I remember the smell of metal in the air, I remember the lightning strikes that day and these…these always seemed similar to those ones…too similar in fact. I began to see the pattern at first, then I began noticing the smell of metal in the air too. But that wasn’t what reminded me of the night I found Setu on the sea….it was the smell coming from his wound that night that made me remember that storm?”



“Wait…you smelt it every time it happened?”



With sunken eyes of a defeated father Mr. Sastry nodded “I couldn’t forget that smell, it was pungent…it's what made most of the crew back away from him, it's what reminded me of him every time I went to my cabin in the boat because it had lingered in there for a long time. I had tried everything, washing the bed, washing the floor, even the walls but the smell lingered. It was like death lingering, the smell of rotten eggs, and sundried fish all mixed into one. “



“But it eventually went away?”



“When his flesh was cut out of him to finally heal the wound on his back, yes…”



Wait, was he telling me that the smell in his cabin was related to Setu’s wound until it healed? I didn’t question him about it though, I needed him to carry on and thankfully he did…



“I quickly learned that the smell would creep up on me each time before a lightning strike every time during the sleepwalking episodes. My wife never mentioned any smell and  so I never told her about it but I always knew…”



“Did you ever smell it after Setu turned 13?”



Mr. Sastry did not respond. I knew if I pushed him more about it, he would walk away, so I decided to ask another question….



“Was there more to the pattern?”



“Amavasya…or new moon to you foreign people….and always the months of October, November and December…”



“Every year?”



“Every year…”



I could hear the blood rushing through my ears as the conversation came to an end. This was too much. Was there something more to Setu that meets the eye? Either way, the treasure I had been hunting for was now within my grasp, and something inside me, something in my gut, told me I was right. I got my journal and began scribbling like a madman until I was sure I had written down every part of the conversation I had just had. And then? I began reading it over and over again.



Bala was surprised when I told him that we won’t be returning right now and that I needed to meet Setu before heading back to the hotel room. And by the time Setu returned from work in the evening, I knew what I needed to ask him. We decided to head out for some tea at the local joint so that I was away from his parents, and once I had eased him into the conversation after some small talk, I asked …



“So you sleep walked? Did you know that?”



“Yeah, appa told me about it a few years ago when I was going to live on my own in the city for a bit for a new job. He was scared it might happen again..”



“Did it?”



“Naa and I’m pretty sure it was just repressed trauma from the accident resurfacing during childhood.”



“That makes sense. Heard about the new check your dad negotiated for you? You should make him your manager, in my opinion.”



“Yeah yeah…jokes aside thanks for all the money, it means a lot to me. Feels like I am finally paying them back for having taken in and raising a child that was destined to die….they practically gave me a life that was never intended for me…”



“Why do you say that?”



“I…..”



Setu paused for a long time after this. I knew he was struggling with an idea that was a core part of his thinking, but he wanted to say it the right way ….



“I…when I think about my biological parents, I paint scenarios where they were loving and caring, where a freak accident separated me from them, but whatever scenario I paint where they seem innocent my heart never believes it. There’s this feeling of abandonment… it's why I believe that Amma and Appa bestowed me with a life that my heart feels my biological parents never intended for me…”



This was heavy stuff and the conversation had taken an unexpected turn. I wanted to veer it in a different direction and so I decided to quickly change the subject with the delicacy of a waddling penguin.



“So um, I know you told me you don’t remember much, but have you had any dreams? Recurring ones or ones that you believe are of your life before the accident?”



“Why do you ask?”



“Just something most sleepwalking patients suffer from…it’s like a side effect”



“Yeah…there’s a symbol….a symbol that I keep seeing in my dreams every now and then”



“Wait, Really? Can I see it?” 



“Didn’t you see it during my interview? It’s what I was drawing in the mud while I was fiddling with the stick…”



I shook my head with an apologetic look. Setu placed his hand on my shoulder as a gesture of forgiveness, but I was less sorry to him and more sorry to myself. How could I have missed such a thing? Setu got a pen out of his pocket and drew the symbol on the newspaper on our table. At first, they looked like nothing but squiggles, but when I looked closely, I saw that there was definitely a pattern in them. It was like a crude rendition of a bird, maybe a turkey or a peacock?



It could also be interpreted as a hat with a turkey head sprouting out of it. The body was quite stout, like a 5-year-old’s interpretation of a hill on the horizon, the neck was half of an S with claws at the end of it instead of a head. The tail, or what you would call a tail, was a triangle, and it had been split into 12 pieces, three triangles at the top and the others subsequently quadrilaterals. 



It had two legs, one of which was shorter than the other, and the big one could also be seen as an upside-down flag. The only part of the image that made sense was the circle on the outside of this image, it was definitely a snake…



Setu then headed to catch up with a couple of his friends on another table and this is when Bala leaned in and whispered…



“You didn’t tell him that you won’t be blurring his face anymore…”



“I’ll get to it, I promise!”



“When?!”



“Before I mail the footage I promise!!”



This stopped him from pestering me and I quickly pulled out my phone and began snapping pics of the symbol.



—



I’ll end this part here, sorry about the delay. My recovery is forcing me to take a step back from typing each night. I’ll also include the pic of Setu’s rendition of the symbol in the next part. It’s on my phone’s backup somewhere, I promise I’ll find it soon. And I know you’ll judge me harshly for my actions and know that I don’t mind that… I do that too.
