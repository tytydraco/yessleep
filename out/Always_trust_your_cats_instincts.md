Cats are weird. That's a fact I think we can all agree on. 

That's the first thing I thought when I found my cat Ugly Betty, aka U.B, standing really still in my bedroom. I watched him from my door a few seconds, he was breathing, as his long fur moving up and down indicated. A minute passed and he still didn't move an inch, remaining at the same position, looking at the corner of the room, I glanced at it, nothing. I thought it was maybe an insect, maybe he was on hunting mode, the would explain why he was still as a statue. Yet another minute went by and he still didn't move, I called his name, he did not even move his ears. At this point, I got worried.

Going into my room, I walked to him. There and then, I don't know what it was, my instinct ? More like a spider sens, but I felt it, the imminent danger, the need not to move. Halfway through my step I stopped, becoming as motionless as my beloved pet. A few seconds later, I heard it, an eerie sound, the sound of someone whistling in the corner.

It was simple, musical, something that I may have appreciated under different circumstances, but at this point, my body went into survival mode, my breath grew quieter and quieter, I knew without a doubt that if I was noticed I would be done for.

I heard my boyfriend going up the stairs calling my name. I tried, I tried, and I tried, yelling his name in my head, telling him to stop, maybe with the power of love he would hear it. As he grew nearer, I prayed that he would see U.B and I and feel the same thing as we did.

And yet, from the corner of my eye, I saw him enter the room, noticing us, laughing thinking we were playing, walking towards us, passing the point where U.B stopped.

And then the whistling stopped.

"Finally...food." 

Everything went far too fast, I could not even describe to you what happened. I heard him cry, yell, beg, his bones crushing, the blood splashing, all of it under the span of five minutes.

I wanted to move, to help him, yet I did not control my own body anymore, it was protecting itself, the mind being disconnected from everything. 

I felt it, walking near me, whistling a happier tune now, his breath smelling of sulfur, of death, of everything bad. 

"You're smart.. I can't see you. Lucky you, the meal was great this time." 

My knees gave out, U.B started licking himself. 

I looked around, there was no blood, no bones, no boyfriend, no nothing, as the police would tell me later, maybe he ran away, they'd keep an eye out for him, I needed more sleep, I was seeing things, maybe I should see a therapist. They dismissed my experience as a bad trip.

Nobody believed me, I started thinking that maybe I imagined things, that what happened two weeks ago was nothing but a bad dream.

Until tonight. 

Under my cover, reading stories on my phone, U.B jumped under my cover, looking at me from under it with insistence, and I immediately understood, I covered us both from head to toe, tucking every corner of the cover so that not even air could come from outside. Soon enough I felt the same feeling, however this time, I could move, breathe, talk even (even though I do no want to try). 

I am writing this to you guys, because I am terrified, I do no know what to do, I have been hiding under the covers for two hours now. And five minutes ago I felt the bed dip by my side. He talked to me again through is chuckles. 

"I can be really patient when the meal is worth it."
