I  met her during my first time at a club. It was quite the strange  experience. I’d never been out dancing before, had never even gotten  drunk and didn’t know the first thing about drugs.

You see, I grew up in an extremely religious household; church every Sunday, praying before every meal, all of it.

I  didn’t mind these things so much. What I did mind was her constant talk  about sins, temptation, the devil and going to hell. I heard it pretty  much every day, and at least once a week, she’d promised me I’d be going  to hell for... something. I absolutely hated it and it was what drove  me to become interested in paganism, and in witches.

It was only natural that when I finally moved on to college, I’d major in religious studies with a focus on paganism.

College  was a revelation for me. For the first time, I got away from home, away  from mom’s obsession with Christ, and I could figure out who I really  was and wanted to be. But also, to try out a few things I’d never dared  before.

I  loved the college lifestyle. My fellow students were all so different  from the people I grew up around. Alcohol, drugs, and alternative  lifestyles were big amongst them. Yet as much as I pride myself about  trying new things and going wild, I didn’t. While I hated mom’s talk  about sin, I was, deep inside, a mousy little thing, shy and reclusive,  reluctant to try anything new.

It  was my friend Emily who eventually convinced me to tag along when she  went to one of her favorite clubs. It was a back alley scene club; the  type frequented by the weirder and more alternative parts of the  population.

It would be an understatement to say I felt like I didn’t belong there.

After  we’d entered, Emily was quick to order us each a beer and, before she  promptly vanished to ‘mingle,’ as she called it, and I was left to my  own devices.

For the next hour, I  just stood at the edge of the dance floor, half-heartedly drinking my  beer and watching people. The air was heavy with the smell of sweat and  alcohol and the loud booming music reverberated painfully inside my  head.

After a while, I noticed a  guy eying me. He gave me a drunken smile before he awkwardly danced in  front of me. I sighed. He’d probably noticed my bored, dejected look,  and was hoping for an ‘easy’ win.

I rolled my eyes and tried my best to ignore his advances, hoping he’d give up soon enough.

When  that didn’t work, I fled to a different floor. For some reason,  however, he kept following me. Regardless of where I went, he soon found  me and lingered nearby.

It was Melinda who saved me.

I’d  just settled down on a couch in one of the club’s quieter areas, the  smoking area, as I should soon find out. After only a minute, the same  creepy guys stumbled in as well.

Before he could approach me, however, a woman set down next to me.

She  was absolutely gorgeous. For a second, all my memories of and the  feelings I’d had for a girl during high school,  resurfaced, and my  heart skipped a beat. Yet I could tell right away that this woman was so  much more than she could’ve ever been.

Her  outfit was simplistic, almost too much so, nothing but a tank top and  shorts, but it fit her perfectly. She had cropped blond hair with a few  darker strands mixed into it. Her most stunning feature, however, were  her eyes. They were bright green, and seemed to focus on me and me  alone, almost as if she was staring into me.

“You new here? Haven’t seen you around?” she half-whispered at me, giving me a coy little smile.

Instead  of answering, I just stared at her. When I realized what I was doing, I  quickly looked away, took a big sip of beer, and then focused on the  creepy guy again. He was sitting on a couch nearby, pretending to mind  his own business, but I noticed his short, side-way glances.

The woman next to me turned in his direction as well.

“Just ignore him. He’ll give up soon enough.”

Just as she said this, the guy suddenly got off and walked away.

“See? It’s just that easy. I’m Melinda, by the way.”

“Oh, my name is, I mean, I’m Claire. Nice to meet you,” I brought out, stumbling over my words.

Melinda  giggled. Then she reached into her purse, brought out a pack of  cigarettes, lit one and leaned back. After two pulls, she held the  cigarette out for me.

I wasn’t a smoker, had never even touched a cigarette, but still took it, almost unconsciously. I started coughing right away.

Laughing, Melinda took it back.

For  the next minute, I just sat there, next to her, entranced by her, and  watched as she exhaled cloud after cloud of bluish-grey smoke.

Once she’d finished her cigarette, she got up, but handed me another one.

“Just so you don’t forget me. See you later, little Claire.”

With that, she went on her way back to wherever she’d come from.

I was left sitting there, cigarette in hand, staring after her.

For long minutes, I tried to make sense of the encounter and the many conflicting feelings inside of me.

Eventually, a clearly drunk Emily found me again.

“I didn’t know you smoked, Claire,” she said.

“I don’t. Oh, this? Yeah, no it’s... never mind,” I said, shaking my head before I carefully put the cigarette into my purse.

We  were at the club for another hour. While Emily was dancing and having  fun, my eyes wandered around, looking for Melinda. Yet she seemed to  have vanished.

For the next few  days, I couldn’t get her out of my head. I don’t know what it was, but  there was something special about Melinda. The way she carried herself,  her confidence, but also other, smaller things I’d noticed about her.  Around her wrist, she’d worn a small, pearly armband, and I’d also  noticed the purple healing stone fastened to her necklace. It made me  wonder if she might be interested in the same things I was.

I was back at the club a week later. This time, on my own.

For long minutes, I walked from floor to floor, desperately trying to find her, but there was no hint of her.

Frustrated,  I went back to the smoking area and found myself an empty seat. There I  sat, brooding, and eventually pulled out the cigarette Melinda had  handed me a week ago. As my thoughts drifted away, I absentmindedly  rolled it between my fingers, playing with it.

“Need a light?”

In  surprise, I dropped the cigarette. When I turned around, I saw Melinda.  Somehow, without even noticing, she’d found me and sat down right next  to me.

“So, you’re smoking now?”

“No. Well, I guess?” I said, giving her a little shrug.

Then  I picked up the cigarette and held it out for her to light. Of course, I  coughed again, but somehow, with each pull, and with Melinda next to  me, it seemed to get easier.

That night, we started talking, and that night I got to know her.

As  I’d thought, Melinda shared many of my interests. Yet the way she went  about them was much more intense. She was much more intense.

While  I read books on pagan rituals, collected healing stones, and made my  own witchy jewelry and accessories, she’d gone much deeper.

She  talked about rituals, too, but the ones she herself had performed.  She’d go on about real magic, real witches, different planes and places,  places, she said, where magic originated from.

Talking  to her was nothing short of enthralling, almost intoxicating.  Eventually, as night turned to early morning, we exchanged phone  numbers, and, a moment later, Melinda was gone again.

We  ended up texting all throughout the week. Melinda told me more about  the things she’d done, recommended me books, but also shared a few niche  blogs on astral projection I might be interested in.

Yet  there was one thing she was steadfast about. If I truly wanted to  learn, to become enlightened, as she put it, I’d have to do the real  thing.

When I asked her if she was  talking about some sort of ritual, all I got was a little emoticon.  Then, a few seconds later, she added a simple ‘You’ll find out on  Saturday. Same place, same time?’

That’s  just how she was, always a tad bit mysterious, but I’d have to lie if I  didn’t like it. Before I knew it, I’d already sent her a yes.

When  Saturday evening arrived, I headed for the club right away. This time, I  didn’t waste any time looking for her, but headed straight for the  smoking area.

Melinda was already  there, waiting for me. She sat on a couch in the back, staring at me  with her bright, green eyes and bidding me to join her.

“So, the real deal? What is it? You want us to do some sort of weird dance ritual?” I asked, laughing a little.

“Oh no, little Claire, it’s something much, much better.”

With  that, her hand vanished inside her purse, and then, careful to hide it  from the other people in the smoking area, produced a small Ziploc bag  containing a strangely growing powder.

For a moment, I just stared at it, not understanding. When my brain functioned again, I realized what she was holding.

“Wait. No way, Melinda, that stuff... I can’t.”

“There’s a first for everything,” Melinda said in a sing-song voice, giving me another one of her seductive smiles.

For the first time, her smile didn’t work on me.

“No, really. This,” I said, holding up the cigarette I was smoking, “sure, but not that.”

I  grew angry, furious even. Was this the reason she’d talked to me? Was  all this a ploy to get me hooked on some sort of weird designer drug?

In my anger, I was about to get up, but felt Melinda’s hand close around my wrist.

“Oh, but don’t you want to learn more? This stuff here, this Oneiria, is the way to go, the way to learn, little Claire.”

I  was still angry with her, but then I thought about mom, about my life  until now. Wasn’t Melinda right? Wasn’t I here to experience new things,  to learn and to get enlightened? The smallest of smiles came over my  face. Yes, I was, and I was here to sin, to do all the things my mom had  warned me about, and told me I’d go to hell for.

When Melinda saw that small smile, she pulled me in close and kissed me.

The  moment our lips made contact, all the apprehension and all my doubts  evaporated. I was obsessed with this woman. When our lips parted, I gave  her a nod and said I was ready to try, if only this once.

The moment I took Oneiria, as she’d called it, the world changed.

All  the colors around me intensified, as if the world’s saturation had been  turned up a few notches. The same was true for my feelings. For the  first time, I could truly feel the world around me, could feel every  part of my body, and, of course, I could feel Melinda.

Almost in a trance, I let her take my hand and lead me to the dance floor.

My  eyes wandered around; the world seemed so, so different. Everything  around me was moving faster, then slower again. Motions and people  became blurs, washing into each other.

Then  I focused on Melinda again. She was in front of me, her arms around me.  I could feel the warmth of her emotions radiate from her and wash over  me in heavy waves. It felt like I was a part of her and her a part of  me.

At one point, we made out right there, on the dance floor. It was the most intense thing I’d ever felt in my entire life.

The  longer I danced with Melinda, our hands grasping each other, our lips  touching, the more the world changed. I saw things I’d never seen  before. People were glowing brightly, their energy wafting through the  air, intermingling and mixing into a kaleidoscope of living colors.

And then, for whatever reason, my eyes wandered upwards.

The club’s ceiling was gone. Twirling stars, and mad, sparkling galaxies unlike anything I’d ever seen before replaced it.

It was nothing short of magical, and as I moved my hand through the air, the stars above responded to my every motion.

Then  my trance-like fascination was interrupted by a moment of clarity. I  instantly cringed back from the surreal sight above me, averted my eyes,  and tried to feel from the dance floor.

Yet  I was held in place. When I stared at Melinda, she, too, had changed.  By now, she was nothing but bright light and pure, intense feeling. I  felt her holding me in place, surrounding me, engulfing me.

“This is what you were looking for all along, little Claire, this is it,” her sing-song voice reverberated inside my mind.

A second later, I drifted off.

When I awoke, I was in bed. For a moment, I shivered when I remembered what had happened.

Suddenly, I realized I was naked, grew confused when I realized I wasn’t in my dorm room.

Then Melinda entered the room, similarly naked.

“Melinda?” I brought out. “What happened? What did we...?”

Her answer was nothing but a smile, but one that told me more than enough.

Once I’d calmed down, I spoke again.

“What was that last night?”

“Oneiria,”  Melinda answered, matter-of-factly. “It allows you to see. Not only  what’s out there, but also what you desire, the magic you always dreamed  of.”

After that night, it didn’t  take long for me to get hooked. I’d told myself repeatedly to not give  into it, that I’d just do it once more. Yet Oneiria had this strange  fascination to it.

It differed  from any other drug I’d heard about. You weren’t just getting high, it  allowed you to visit certain different places. Every time the two of us  indulged in Oneiria, I saw the same mad, sparkling galaxies, but also a  world in which magic was real.

Eventually,  I learned I wasn’t the only person Melinda had introduced Oneiria to.  When I first heard this, I felt betrayed, and a pang of jealousy shot  through my entire body. I almost left, never to talk to her again. Yet  Melinda assured me I was special. I was the one, the only one she loved.  All those others, they were friends, acquaintances, people of mutual  interest. I was different.

What  can I say? I believed her. And so, a few days later, I joined her during  her next meeting with her little witches’ circle, who all indulged in  Oneiria.

Every time I did it,  however, the drug’s effect became stronger. It was barely noticeable,  but noticeable nonetheless. The visions I saw intensified, and each  time, I caught more glimpses of this other world. It was a place where  not only magic was real, but witches, paganism, and magical creatures as  well.

It was a place, I  eventually learned, where even I had power, actual power, and could  command the magic I so longed for. No longer was I mousy little Claire,  but what I’d always wanted to be: a witch, an actual witch.

Yet  as much as I loved the place, and as much as I loved Melinda, something  about it felt wrong. That place, it felt too different and too far  away, too detached.

At the same  time, however, whenever I was there, I felt this pull, a pull from  somewhere beyond that pulled me in just a tad bit closer.

Eventually,  I realized, deep inside, I didn’t really want this. I didn’t want to  get any closer. What I wanted was to feel magic, to command it, sure,  but not in some otherworldly, drug-infused dreamscape. I’d wanted to do  it here, to bring just a bit of magic into my boring secluded life. If I  couldn’t even do that, then all of this was meaningless, might as well  not have been real.

No, as much as  I was pulled in, as much as I wanted more of it, I didn’t want to leave  the real world behind, at least not just yet.

About a week ago, things took a turn for the worse.

Once  again, our little circle met up, and once again, we readied ourselves  for another round of Oneiria-infused scrying. That night, however, we,  or rather they, went further than ever before.

While  they all indulged in Oneiria, I sat there, holding the tiny Ziploc bag  in hand, merely staring at it. I could feel the pull, watched as my  fingers unconsciously opened the bag, my brain getting ready to indulge  again. Then, I struggled against it. At first it was nothing but a  half-hearted attempt, an afterthought, but soon it rose in power. As I  did, I felt Melinda’s eyes on me, and somehow, this was enough to break  free. The Ziploc bag dropped from my hand and I leaned back, thinking  I’d finally broken free.

Yet  as I sank back into my seat, I saw the ceiling above me opening up,  vanishing, before the mad, sparkling galaxies replaced it. Then, we were  all pulled in closer, towards the world of magic we’d visited so many  times before.

But  I hadn’t taken the drug. So how was this possible? How was I able to  see what I’d thought of as nothing but Oneiria-infused hallucinations,  tricks of the mind? Did it mean that all of it, all the visions, all the  things I’d seen were… real?

Anxious,  in confused terror, I turned toward Melinda, only to see she’d changed.  What had once been a woman with cropped blond hair and bright green  eyes was now a glimmering witch made of nothing but stars, a twisted  space nebula.

She seemed to  extend, to spread out, growing bigger, wider, an all-encompassing shroud  of stars, fire and magic that washed over us.

But  then, once she’d filled out the entire room, she opened up, and for the  first time, I could see it clearly: the twisted, magical wonderland.

It  was right there, right in front of me, so close, I could almost touch  it. I saw energy wafting through the air like colorful clouds, saw  magical creatures and fantastical beings.

Yet  the place was all wrong. Its physics made no sense. It was upside down,  but was not; it was circular but spread out and even. I saw mountains  growing from the skies, mad galaxies that seemed far away but right  there. Behind it all, I saw beings as massive as stars, unfathomable  things reaching out, ever reaching out, further and further.

Instantly,  I drew back, averted my eyes, and started screaming in sheer and utter  terror. These screams were drowned out by those of the other members of  the group. Theirs, however, were screams of joy. Soon, a cacophony of  barely human jubilation echoed through the room, through the entire  building, as they all threw themselves into the dreamscape ahead.

For a moment, I could see them running into one another, becoming one being before they were torn apart again.

Still  screaming, I scrambled away and retreated to the farthest corner of the  room. There I sat, shivering and shaking, my eyes closed and my hands  pressed over my ears.

I stayed like this for what felt like an eternity.

Finally, I felt a hand touching my face. I jerked up, cringed away, but saw it was Melinda.

“It’s okay now, little Claire. It’s over.”

“W-what the hell was that?”

“I guess it wasn’t for you. Maybe not yet, maybe never.”

“What?”

“I showed it to you, little Claire, a place where you can be yourself, where you’ll find what you’ve been looking for.

“But that place... I don’t want it. Not like that.”

When I said this, Melinda’s eyes turned sad and a moment later, she got up.

“That’s it then,” she eventually said, her voice as sad as her eyes.

“Wait, what do you mean?”

“I was only here to help, little Claire, to show, not to force.”

“No, but I love you. I love us, and I want to-“

“Do you really? Or were you just looking for someone to enlighten you, to show you just how much more there’s out there?”

“No! I mean... I don’t know. I don’t freaking know, all right?!”

At  that moment, Melinda came closer. Once more, she put her lips on mine. I  savored that kiss more than any other we’d shared before.

When  our lips parted, I could see the same mad, sparkling galaxies in her  eyes and could feel her body surrounding me. It felt as if she was more  magic than a real person.

My eyes grew wide, and I went forward to touch, to indulge in her, but Melinda stopped me.

“See? You didn’t want me, didn’t want Melinda, but those feelings, the magic of that other place.”

“But... it’s gone now, isn’t it?”

“You can find it again, the Oneiria, the magic, all of it.”

“What about you?”

“Me? What do you think I am?”

“You are...”

As much as I tried, I couldn’t answer her question.

“Nothing but a dream,” Melinda whispered into my ear.

A moment later, she was gone, leaving me alone in the empty room.

It’s  been days since then. Even now, I can’t make sense of what happened.  Neither can I make sense of who, or what, Melinda truly was.

Yet  at night, I often dream of that place, a place where magic is real.  It’s a place where I am truly a witch. Sometimes, out of the corner of  my eye, I catch a glimpse of her, of a woman with cropped blond hair,  and bright green eyes who’s boding me forward to join her.

Whenever  I awake from those dreams, I’m filled with the utmost fear, but a fear  that’s different from that of any other nightmares.

For as much as I oppose it, as much as I don’t want to go, I long for it with every fiber of my being.

I  know that eventually, I will go back to those back alley scene clubs,  those frequented by the weirder, more alternative parts of the  population.

And one day, regardless if I want to or not, I know I will indulge in it again, [indulge in Oneiria.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=UpdateMeBot&subject=Subscribe&message=SubscribeMe!%20%2Fr%2Fnosleep%20%2Fu%2FRehnWriter)
