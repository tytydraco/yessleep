The Australian alpine region, a beautiful part of Australia, which is in both the New South Wales and Victoria states. It's home to the highest mountain in the country, Mount Kosciuszko. As beautiful as this region is, nobody ever ventures there after dark. I learned the hard way as to why.

I was driving in my car, with a friend, who I will call Kate. We were driving through there, near Mount Beauty, Victoria. We had our lights on, and it was an eerie sight, just driving through the mountains, with a pitch black forest on both side. It was awfully quiet. It was actually terrifying, so I put on my Spotify playlist to make it less creepy. We were singing along to 90's classic songs.

Surely this cant be ruined, right? Wrong.

Just as we were singing along to songs from Radiohead, it was cut short by a blood curdling scream. It sounded like a woman in pain. Kate and I immediately pulled over to the side of the road, so we could see if someone was in danger. When we got out of the car, we heard this woman scream "HELP". Immediately, something felt off, I said to Kate "lets get out of here, something isn't sitting right with me at all". Kate was adamant that we find the woman and help her. We ventured into the forest, and we went pretty far. We thought we had found the woman, as we were just able to make out someone on the ground, sitting.

I looked a bit closer. I realized, this thing was NOT human. I watched as whatever this godforsaken beast was, turned around to look at us. It let out a blood curdling scream, and immediately got up and got on all fours, and started racing towards us. I had ran and hid, but unfortunately, Kate wasn't so lucky. The creature had pounced on her and ate her. I lay down, pretending to be dead, while I heard Kate's last scream, as she was being devoured by whatever this was.

I tried not to throw up as I heard the creature chomping down on her body. I could smell this creature from where I was laying down, pretending to be dead. It smelled strong, putrid, rotten. Like rotting flesh, with a little bit of sewage water. I'm not sure where this creature had been before, but it was bad news. I heard the creature searching for me in the bushes. Luckily, it did not. Once the creature had gone back into the woods, I quietly got up and made a swift sprint for the car. I made it back into my car, and immediately sped out of there. I had went to a motel in Mount Beauty, so I could stay somewhere for the rest of the night. I could not sleep at all. I kept wondering if that was a skinwalker, a bunyip, a yowie, a wendigo, or some other cryptid I have no idea about. I absolutely REFUSED to drive at night from that point on.

Now, I have moved into an apartment in Melbourne, right in the heart of the city. I am going through therapy, and am seeking all forms of therapy, and psychology.

The only thing that I can rest assured about, is that I am safe in the heart of the city, far, **far** away, from the alpine region.

Let this be a reminder, that if you are in Australia and choose to visit the alpine region, please do not be there in any way or form after dark, or you risk being some creature's next meal.
