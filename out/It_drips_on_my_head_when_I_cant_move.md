It starts with the smell. Not a smell of rot, or blood, or anything you’d expect. It’s the smell of ozone, like the air after a lightning strike, mixed with the damp, mineral scent of a deep cave. That’s how I know I’m slipping into the prison. That’s how I know the gallery is open.

My name is Layla. For three years, I’ve been a student of the ceiling. I know every crack in the plaster above my bed, every subtle shift of shadow from the distant streetlamp outside my window. I’ve traced constellations in the imperfections, named them: The cleft, the stain, the fissure. Astronomy of the inert. It’s my only defense when the paralysis sets in.

It’s textbook, they said. Stress. A glitch in the REM cycle. Your brain wakes up before your body. The sensation of a presence? A common hallucination. The crushing weight on your chest? Your own dormant diaphragm. It’s all in your mind, Layla. So comforting. So utterly, catastrophically wrong.

The process is a familiar betrayal. First, the ozone cave smell, seeping into the room like a gas. Then, the low hum, a frequency that seems to vibrate in my teeth rather than my ears. My body becomes a tomb, a beautiful, intricate statue of flesh and bone I can no longer command. I am a mind in a marble casing. And then… the understanding that I am not alone in the gallery.

It stands just outside my field of vision, always in the periphery, a clot of deeper darkness in the already dark room. I can’t turn my head to see it. The gallery’s rules are strict. I can only stare at my ceiling constellations and feel it approach. The temperature drops. Not a chill, but an absence of warmth, as if it’s drawing the energy from the air itself. And I would hear the breathing. Not mine. This was a wet, rhythmic sound, a slow inhalation that ended in a faint, bubbling gurgle. It was the sound of something with inefficient lungs, something that wasn’t built for this air.

Then comes the wetness.

A single, cold drop. It lands on my temple, just at the hairline, and slides with agonizing slowness down into my hair. Another. And another. A slow, cold leak from a reality above mine. It’s viscous. It doesn’t evaporate. When I finally burst free from the stone of my body, gasping, my heart a trapped bird slamming against my ribs, my hair is always damp in that one spot. Cold, sticky, smelling of ozone and cave.

I scrambled to the bathroom. In the harsh light, my face was pale, my eyes wild. And there, on my skin, gleaming, were two tacky, amber flecked droplets. They smelled of decay and metal. 

I told my therapist about the wet hair. A sympathetic smile. “Post episode perspiration, Layla. It can feel localized, strange. The brain is a tricky place.” But brains don’t leave residue. Brains don’t leave a smell that lingers on your pillow until you wash the case.

The horror wasn’t just the paralysis, or the presence. It was the mundane, puzzling evidence of it. The dampness. It was a proof my rational mind couldn’t logic away. I started sleeping with a towel on the pillow. I’d wake up, and the towel would be dry, but my hair, underneath, would be wet. As if the wetness passed through solid matter. As if it was meant for me, specifically.

The fear curdled into a desperate, furious curiosity. I was being studied in my own private gallery, drip fed terror. I needed to see the artist.

I bought a small, infrared security camera. I positioned it on my bookshelf, pointed directly at the bed. A digital eye to witness what my mortal ones could not. I set it to record on motion detection. That night, as the ozone smell began to bleed into the room, I felt a new emotion alongside the dread: a grim sense of vindication. Tonight, I would have answers. Or I would finally have proof of my own insanity. Either was preferable to the not knowing.

The episode was the same. The hum, the stone, the crushing isolation, the drops: cold, deliberate, marking me. The presence felt… heavier. Closer. There was a new sound, a soft, fibrous creak, like old leather being stretched. I could feel the cold seep through my t-shirt. I lay there, a frozen banquet, weeping inside as the thing above me feasted with its eyes.Then it was over. I swam up from the cement of sleep, drenched in sweat and that other, colder dampness. I didn’t even move to turn on the light. I just reached for my laptop, connected to the camera, and pulled up the night’s file.

The video was there. Three hours of stillness, then a burst of activity at 3:17 AM. My sleeping form, a pale mound under the blankets. The timestamp ticked forward in the eerie green and black of night vision.

At 3:18, something entered the frame from the top.

It didn’t walk. It unfolded. It was all wrong angles and impossible, elongated segments, like a puppet made of shadows and broken furniture, controlled by a careless child. It was tall, so tall its upper body was lost in the darkness above the camera’s view. But the lower part… it had too many joints, bending in directions that spoke of a biology not of this earth. It moved with a stuttering, stop motion grace.

Then it leaned down.

The camera caught its face. Or the terrible approximation of one.

It was long and narrow, a grotesque, stretched teardrop of a head. Its skin was the color and texture of a dried mushroom, puckered and matte. It had no eyes that I could see, just smooth, shallow depressions. But its mouth… a lipless, horizontal slit that ran halfway down the length of its face. And it was slack, slightly open. It moved to the bedside, its gait a series of jerky, insectile adjustments. It leaned over me, its form blocking the light. And then, from the darkness of that slit, a long, black, rope like tongue slithered out. It wasn’t a tongue for tasting. It was a conduit. At its tip, a bead of that thick, iridescent fluid gathered and fell. Drip. 

Right onto my temple.

I watched, frozen, as my paralyzed self lay motionless. The creature didn’t move. It simply… loomed. And drooled. The string of saliva was constant, a glistening thread in the infrared connecting its jaw to my hair. For ten minutes, it just stood there, leaking onto me.

Then, the fibrous creak I’d heard. On the screen, the horizontal slit of its mouth twitched. The lower part of its jaw, a separate bone from the rest of its skull, detached slightly. It dropped a fraction of an inch, widening the opening of its maw. It wasn’t a dramatic movement. It was subtle. Deliberate. Like it was testing its own hinges.

Then it straightened, folding back up into the darkness above the frame, leaving only the timestamp and my sleeping, soiled body.

I vomited. I vomited until I was hollow. The proof was not liberating. It was a death sentence. This was no hallucination. It was a thing. A real, physical thing that came into my room, stood over me, and… fed? Watched? Prepared?

The metaphor wasn’t lost on me. Isn’t that what chronic fear is? A slow drip of dread that soaks into the fabric of who you are? A presence that feeds on your helplessness, widening its maw a little more each night, waiting until your spirit is soft enough to swallow whole? My monster was just a literalization of the paralysis itself, the creeping, consuming helplessness.

But metaphors don’t leave sticky residue. Metaphors don’t appear on infrared cameras.

I was a ghost in the daytime, hollowed out by the nightly terror. I stopped sleeping, drinking coffee until my hands shook, but it didn’t matter. I became a strategist of insomnia. I avoided the bed, the gallery, for two nights. On the third, exhaustion dragged me down like stones in a pocket. The smell greeted me before I even lost consciousness. Ozone. Cave. Home, it seemed to say. The paralysis came again, a forced consciousness, a front row seat to my own consumption.

This time was different. The paralysis was heavier, the hum deeper, resonating in my bones. The drops came faster, not a drip but a trickle, as if it was excited I’d returned. And the creak… it was louder. Longer. I could feel the air displace above me, could sense the widening of that awful, unhinging jaw. It was closer. It was hungrier. It could fit me now.

It paused there, for an eternity, that abyss yawning over me. I stared up into it. And in that moment, past the terror, I felt something else…a profound, cosmic understanding. This wasn’t a random monster. It was an eater of stillness. A consumer of trapped souls. My paralysis wasn’t a cage keeping me from escaping it; it was the sauce that made me palatable. My fear was the seasoning. It didn’t eat me. It closed its jaw, slowly, the bones crunching back into their mockery of a face, and retreated.

I broke free with a scream already tearing from my throat. The wetness wasn’t just in my hair; it was on my cheek, my neck. I fled the room, spent the night shivering in my bathtub.

Last night, I tried the camera again. A final document. A last will and testament of my sanity.

The video showed the now familiar unfolding, the hovering. But this time, it didn’t just stand. It lowered its entire upper body, bringing its face inches from mine. The slack mouth, that dripping slit, filled the screen. And as I watched, paralyzed on tape, the lower jaw unhinged with a sickening, sustained crackle. It dropped down, down, revealing a gullet of impenetrable blackness. The mouth was now a yawning chasm, wide enough to fit over my entire head. It held that position, a living, breathing mouth hole, poised over my face. The drool wasn’t a drip now; it was a rivulet, pouring over my forehead and hair.

It stayed like that for the entire episode. Not feeding. Not yet. Just… measuring. Practicing.

The episode ended. On screen, I gasped and stirred. And the creature… it didn’t jerk away. It didn’t flee. It slowly, so slowly, closed its jaw. The hinge lifted with that same leathery creak. Then it turned its smooth, eyeless face.

It turned toward the camera.

It tilted its head, as if noticing the little red eye for the first time. As if it knew I’d been watching. As if it knew I knew.

It didn’t unfold away. It simply…faded, dissolving into the shadows not as something leaving, but as something retreating into a layer of reality just behind my own.

I’m writing this now at 4 PM, sitting in a sunbeam. The world is bright and normal. But I can still smell the cave. The damp spot in my hair from last night never quite dried. It’s cold, and it smells like my future. I am not safe. The light means nothing. It’s in my house. It’s in the negative space behind my eyelids. I can feel it waiting in the walls, in the quiet hum of appliances, in the very air I breathe.

I know what it wants. It’s done tasting. It’s done practicing.

Tonight, when the paralysis pins me, and the shadow unfolds, and the dripping starts… it won’t stop at dripping. The jaw will unhinge, wider than ever before, and it will keep going. And I will lie there, my silent screams the final garnish, as it finally consumes the feast it has been patiently preparing.

And yet another part of me knows, it’s not waiting for the paralysis anymore. That was just the training wheels. It was using the paralysis as a conduit, a door. Now the door is wedged open. It knows I see it. The rules have changed.

Sleep always wins. Eventually, the body betrays the mind. Eventually, I will go back to the gallery. And when I do, I don’t think I’ll be paralyzed. I think I’ll be awake. I think I’ll be able to move. I’ll be able to scream.

And I think its jaw is now wide enough to fit.
