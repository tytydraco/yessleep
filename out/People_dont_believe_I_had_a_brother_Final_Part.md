"Are you sure you’re up for this?”

I glanced over at Dr. Smalls as we made our way up to the visitation room.  She’d come back the afternoon before to confirm what Gertie had told her, and I’d assured her that I really had decided to meet with my parents so long as I could do it before I left the facility and there were some guarantees for my safety.  One of which being that she’d put one of the hospital’s armed security guards right outside the room during our visit.  She’d looked at me thoughtfully for a moment and then agreed.

The following morning she was looking less sure of herself, and I could tell she was genuinely concerned as she asked me if I still wanted to go through with it.  Smiling at her, I gave a nod. 

“Yeah, I’ve given it a lot of thought, and I think it’s something I have to do.  Even if the chance is small, I can’t think of another way out of this other than to confront it head on.”

She returned my smile.  “I understand.  And I think it’s a courageous thing.  I don’t…well, I don’t believe everything you’ve told me.  I think you understand why.  But I do believe that your parents  may have abused you, and if I can help provide a safe space for you to talk to them and get into a better head space, I’m happy to do so.”

“I really appreciate it.  And they aren’t in there, right?  I get to go in first and get settled?”

She nodded.  “Yes, they’re being held in the front waiting room until you’re ready.”  Turning a last corner, she gestured to a door.  “And here we are.”  

There was a large man wearing a black uniform standing next to the door, and at our approach, he gave a smiling nod.  “Good to see you, doctor.”

“Good to see you, Russ.  This is Stephen.  I’m going to get him comfortable and then they can send his parents back.”  She paused and then added.  “Russ, promise to take care of Stephen, okay?  His parents…well, he’s got concerns with them, so stay sharp when they’re here.”

He glanced at me and back at her, his expression growing more serious.  “Yes, ma’am.”  Looking back at me, he gave a sharp nod.  “Don’t worry.  I’ve got you covered.”

I met his gaze and returned the nod.  “Thank you.  I believe you.”

Going into the room, I was surprised by how similar it was to the interview rooms deeper within the hospital. The same walls, same table and two chairs, but slid over more to the side to accommodate a small sofa as well.  Seeing everything in its place, I smiled to Dr. Smalls with a confidence I didn’t feel.  My stomach was already twisted in knots, and the idea of what was coming only made it worse.

“Okay, I think I’m ready.”

“Okay.  I’ll get them sent back.  Let me know if you need me.”

As soon as she shut the door, I went to the far chair and slid it against the wall farthest from the door.  Then I began taking off my shirt.

**** 

Seeing them walk in was surreal.  They looked like my parents, the people I’d loved and trusted more than anybody, and seeing them come into the room all warm smiles and laughter, I felt a moment of disorientation.  Had all the rest really happened?  Didn’t it have to be a nightmare or some figment of my imagination?  Didn’t me being crazy make the most…

The last time I saw Mark’s face flashed before my eyes.

No.  I knew what they were.  It all happened, just like I remembered.  Tears stinging my eyes, I returned their smile, but kept my distance when Mom offered me a hug.  I could see a hardness growing beneath their smiles, but they were careful.  Dad frowned slightly as he gave a confused laugh.

"Why’s your shirt off, sport?”

I glanced at where I’d hung it on the wall.  “I’m hot.  I’m nervous and that makes me hot.  Hope it won’t bother you.”

The thing that looked like my father shook his head.  “No, not at all.  Just wondering.  How come you’re…”  He glanced down at Dr. Smalls who was watching all of this from the doorway.  “Are you going to be staying or can we have some time alone with our son?”

She looked to me and I stared into her eyes pleadingly.  Please just say yes.  Just yes and nothing more.  Don’t tell them anything else, just leave them alone with me with no one watching.

Frowning slightly, she shook her head.  “No, he’s going to be released today anyway.  You feel free to to visit in private.  If you need anything…um, just knock on the door.”

The mother thing thanked her and pulled the door closed behind her.  When she turned back, they both began smiling at me—more genuine, terrible smiles that didn’t look like my parents at all.  It was the father thing that spoke again first.  

“So what changed your mind?”

I shrugged.  “I just…I figured it out.”  I waved my hand at them, trying not to shake.  “I mean, not what the fuck you are or what you did to our parents, but I know you…erased Mark somehow.  And that you won’t stop coming for me.  You may wait a bit because you’re patient and smart, but you’d keep coming, wouldn’t you?  Even if I like ran away and hid?”

Mom snickered.  “You can’t hide from us, boy.  We can smell you from across the world.  We are connected, you see.  And yes, we would have gotten you eventually, even if you had run.”  She made a strange clucking sound deep in her throat.  “This way is much better.  You will still suffer, but your choice makes it all more meaningful.”

Dad was still studying me.  His face was stony but I could see excitement dancing in his eyes.  “So you’re just giving in?  Accepting it?”

I nodded.  I had to do this next part just right or I’d tip them off.  “I am.  I don’t see how I can escape it, and I don’t want to live afraid anymore.  I can…I get out this afternoon and um, I can follow you back home then if you want.”

Dad started to chuckle, a thin line of drool trailing out of the corner of his mouth.  “No need for that.”  He reached down and started unbuckling his belt.  “We can take care of it right here.  When we’re done, they won’t even remember you were ever here.”

Mom was already sliding out of her dress, and within a matter of moments they were both naked.  Their skin was already growing waxy and strange, and I shuddered as they began to change.  My father’s head grew wider and longer as the bottom half unfurled into flared mandibles of black gums and rows of grey teeth.  The thing that looked like Mom was growing wispy webs across her greasy skin, and I could already see the toothy void in her middle growing as they both began to approach me with small, almost secretive smiles.

“Come on, son.  Let’s get this done. Get this over.”  That was him.

And almost in tandem, her softer voice, “You don’t have to be afraid anymore.  Just a few bites, a bit of suffering, and you won’t be anything.  Time for it to end.”

They were moving past the table now, one on each side so I couldn’t get to the door.  I was trapped between them, pale and shambling monstrosities so horrible that my mind could barely work when I looked at them.  It was too much, it was all too much, and I was frozen to the spot.

The father thing chuckled as the mother thing reached out to me.  “Take my hand.  Join your brother, join us, again.”

A surge of anger flared through me as I thought of Mark again.

“You’re both going to fucking die.”

Gritting my teeth, I stood up from the chair and slammed my hand into the wall where my shirt hung.  Beneath it, the panic button clicked in audibly and a shrill siren began to wail.  The monsters looked around confusedly, wincing at the noise, even as the door flung open and Russ stepped into view.

“What…what the fu…”

His eyes were everywhere, and I had to scream to get his attention over the siren’s noise and the Hell he was seeing.  “They’re fucking monsters!  Shoot them or they’ll kill us!”  They were already turning toward him, and I saw him reaching for his gun as I dove between them and began crawling under the table.

Gunshots rang out, echoing in the small space and mixing with horrible squeals of pain and rage from above and behind me as I scrabbled out the other side of the table’s legs and made it to the door.  Russ noted me passing by and started to step back.  I think he was going to close the door on them, instinctively knowing he needed to escape even after shooting them repeatedly.  One more step and I think he could have shut the door.  

Then my mother grabbed him and yanked him back in.  

Both of the creatures were bleeding from several wounds and were clearly hurt and weak, but they weren’t dead, and they were still strong enough to start tearing Russ apart and eating him while he screamed like a caught rabbit.  This wasn’t going to work, they would just finish him and then get me and anyone else that got in their way.  Heart and head pounding, I noticed Russ’ black pistol on the ground a few feet from one of my mother’s spasming legs.  But I couldn’t go back in there.  I just…

Out of the corner of my eye I saw Dr. Smalls coming around the corner in a panic.  I met her eyes and shook my head.  “Don’t.  Don’t come down this way.  Please.”  Then I forced myself forward, closing the door behind me as I bent down to pick up the gun.

Both of the horrors were half-dazed with the pain and pleasure of eating, but the father thing still looked up with a mouthful of Russ’s thigh as I put the gun to its head and pulled the trigger twice.   I half-expected it to not work, but whether it was the location I hit or something else, his head crumpled wetly before the mass of him slumped over.  The mother thing began to scream then, but I didn’t give her time to run or attack.  Praying there were bullets left, I emptied another three rounds into her head and neck before I heard the hard repeated click of me pulling the trigger on an empty gun.

I collapsed to the floor even as the second monster fell, sobbing and screaming so softly that it seemed to be coming from someone else far away.  I may have kept going like that for some time, if not for the shock of everything changing around me.

Within a matter of moments, like waking up from a bad dream, I saw reality shift and fold and shuffle away the nightmare scene around me.  The monsters were gone, as were their clothes, the blood, and even Russ’ remains.  Everything looked untouched again other than my shirt on the wall, the chair out of place, and a few somethings scattered across the floor.  

I bent over and picked one of them up.  Shell casings from Russ’ gun.  

I grabbed up the rest of them, and after putting on my shirt and sliding the chair back into place, I stepped outside.  Down the hall a little, Dr. Smalls was sitting in a chair holding her head.  I walked up to her and she jumped a little before offering a weary smile.

“Stephen…what’re you doing up here?  You don’t leave until this afternoon…right?”  I could see she was muddled, and I felt a pang of worry.

“You okay, doctor?”

Standing up slowly, she nodded.  “I just had a sudden headache, a migraine really, but it seems to be fading now.”  She blinked and shook her head.  “But let me get you back to your room.  I’ll see about getting your paperwork signed and you can head out as soon as the timer runs out this afternoon.”  She gave a small laugh.  “But don’t try to sneak out early or I’ll have to send R…um…I’ll have to send Ellis or someone after you.”  She winced again slightly.  “Sorry, I’m just a bit out of sorts at the moment.  Anyway…I hope you’re feeling better about your…”  When she looked at me this time, her eyes were almost pleading.

Sucking in a breath, I nodded and forced a smile.  “Depression.  Yeah, you helped me a lot.”

“Good. Just remember that the things that try to bring us down are just passing storms. If we can hold on, a lot of times they fade away. “

I glanced back down the hall towards the interview room.  “Sometimes they take a lot before they do.”  I let out a long breath as I turned back to her.  “But yeah.  I’m still [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Verastahl/) "
