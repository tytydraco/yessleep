How I got myself into this mess.

Trapped. 

It's a word I’m sure you've read a million times. And a concept that's lost so much of it's impact people do it for fun. Personally,  escape rooms wouldn’t be my jam, but plenty of people love them. 

I've experienced a lot of fear in the past year or so, but there’s something primal about being trapped. If something is coming for you, at least you can fight or run. But having someone control you to the extent of not having to kill you... is its own kind of torture. 

I've spent the last few hours trying to have a conversation with Page, but I’m not making much headway. I understand she isn't the enemy, but that's about it. I put that idea on the backburner, and try to think of another way out of this situation. 

The room reeks, the bed is a biohazard, and I'm not seeing anything other than a half-full chamber pot to use when the time comes. I wonder how long Herman plans on keeping me here. 

"There has to be a better way to do this, Herman. Come on man, are you telling me there’s no scenario where we both get what we want?

I've done a lot of things to make it this far. You see who I hang out with, how is there no room for negotiation?", I plead, having no clue if Herman is listening. 

A long period of silence, broken by a harsh electric buzzing that takes the rhythm out of my racing heart. I find the source of the sound, an old, yellowing intercom. 

"Now that I’ve got your attention. 

There are probably a lot of ways I could go about doing things. But, you know who I am, right? What I do? 

If not, when you get a minute, use that phone I let you keep to look up my name. 

Seldom do I get a chance to mix business and pleasure, but, here we are. 

If it makes you feel any better, it's not all just the fact I want to see you hurt. I have to wrap all of this up nicely, make sure there is no trace of you by the time Demi and your friends have to leave.", Herman's voice is distorted and warped by the barely functioning intercom. 

I'm scared, but I try and latch onto a tiny spark of rage. I think of how Mike or Leo would handle the situation. 

"If all you're offering is tortured death, seems like you're in a weak spot for negotiation. 

You'd be surprized at what our group can forgive and forget. But if you're not willing to haggle, how does this grab you?

I open up my own throat before you get to do Jack-shit. I'm running under the assumption you can tell if I'm lying somehow. 

Am I?", I say. I'm serious, and more than a little proud at the fact that I managed to say this without faltering. 

Another long silence. 

"Doesn't work for me, friend. 

You can try doing that all you want. Might even succeed if you're tougher than you look. 

But know this. You're not the only interesting tidbit Demi brought down here. In fact, as far as things go, you're my second choice. 

That bitch you travel with, she's with child. A werewolf alone would bring me in a lot more than yourself. But a pregnant one? Makes what I’m doing with you nearly an act of charity. 

So, you try and off yourself with a splinter or piece of broken glass all you want. Might be worth watching. But if you do, you need to understand all you're doing is putting your bad luck on her. ", Herman counters.

Trapped. 

In a more metaphorical sense, of course, but trapped none the less. 

I don't reply to Herman, I have nothing to say. He's right, there's no way I'm putting Sveta on the chopping block. At least not for nothing more than telling Herman to go fuck himself. 

What I find myself thinking next sickens me a bit. I  wonder how much easier this would be if I was just a doll. 

It's the most messed up thought I've had of my own accord. Doesn't mean it goes away though. 

What follows is a song by dysmorphia feat. self hatred. I question who I am, what I am , what I want, and each decision I've made to get here. 

Sure, at some point I spent a few decades as a person. Probably more than I spent as a sentient toy. But it doesn't feel like that. And the admission, if only to myself harms the last surviving shred of my sanity. 

Herman lets me stew. I picture him sitting somewhere in this living hotel, watching me through a low resolution CRT monitor, laughing his ass off. 

I scream, I cry, I rant. All are equally effective at helping my situation. 

I sit on a splintery, stained wooden floor, staring forward, energy spent. 

There's a knocking at the door. 

Whether good sense or simple disassociation, I ignore it.

After a minute or so, the knocking happens again. My breathing starts to quicken, wondering what’s on the other side of the door. 

"Don't be rude, you have a guest.", Herman says through the intercom. 

I force myself to stand, with every step toward the door, my body screams at me not to open it. 

Sweat beads on my face, my hand shakes as I grasp the tarnished brass handle. 

I fling the door open, expecting the worst. 

The person in front of me is thin. A little under six feet, with pale brown hair and psoriasis ridden skin. He wears faded jeans, and a plain grey t-shirt. He scratches at himself, walking into the room. As he passes, I catch a whiff, of a foul, musky odor. 

Unlike me, he has no problem sitting on the filth ridden bed. He sizes me up, a look of shame on his face. 

The door to the room slams shut. 

"Your friend may be the last werewolf, but there are plenty of branches of that particular family tree. 

Stunted, sad things, nothing like the purebreds but they have their uses. 

Nelson here, is one of those unfortunate individuals. Nelson also owes me a lot of money. 

Around here, for people like him, there is a very fine line between debt and servitude. 

I've made him a deal. He brings me a big enough piece of you, his debt is forgiven. 

Stop him if you can.", Herman explains. 

"I don't know how. I'd be more than willing to jump through any hoop you want, just to find the Bishop. The problem is, I have no memory.", I plead. 

"Yeah, can't say the situation is ideal, but you play the hand you're dealt. That goes for both of us, I guess.", Herman replies. 

"Nelson, don't do this. I can tell you don't want to. You think Herman is going to honor his end of the deal?", I ask. 

Nelson sighs. 

"I came here thinking I could make some quick money for my family. I've been gone for 2 years. 

They're back home, wondering where I am, doing god knows what to survive. I need to get back to them, man.", Nelson replies simply.

I try to stay calm, think of what I can say to Nelson to change his mind. I feel a tiny spark of something in him but what to do with it? I have no idea. 

One corner of Nelson's mouth begins to twitch. The look in his yellowed, bloodshot eyes goes from mournful to glazed over. 

The smell coming off of him starts to get worse, in a few seconds I’m gagging. 

Watching Sveta transform was like watching some natural marvel. A volcano, or geyser. You know it's dangerous, but in a way, it's beautiful too. 

Nelson though, was more like watching a natural disaster. 

He doesn't shed one form for another, his body begins to twist and spasm, limbs deforming in fits and starts. He screams in pain, the sound changing in pitch and tone at random. He hits the floor, thrashing wildly as his skull starts to bulge and deform. 

I've pressed myself up against one damp, mold ridden corner of the room, mind too panicked to do anything other than stay conscious. 

Nelson shatters a chair as boils and wiry black fur start to form on his skin. He soils himself, though whether it's from pain, or the effects of his transformation, I don't know. 

His body is still warping as I see a cruel sentience come to his eyes. His jaw snaps, drool pours from a malformed mouth as he stands in front of me. 

He's an asymmetrical abomination. About six and a half feet of canine features haphazardly made of human flesh. He's naked, one vestigial leg growing from his back twitching uselessly. 

There's pain and rage in those eyes. And now, I can feel not just a spark, but an inferno of supernatural energy. 

I try and concentrate, find that thing inside of me that could get me out of this situation. But the more I try the harder it is to understand. It's the mental equivalent of trying to hold a greased marble. 

Nelson doesn't stalk toward me, his deformed body doesn't lend itself to grace. But his loping stride inspires fear none the less. 

I give up on trying to have my 'use the force' moment. What I can feel is little more than nonsense to me. 

I beg. Not with any intent beyond sparing myself the pain and trauma I know is coming.

People talk about being hopeless as if it's the worst thing on earth. It's a road I’ve been down, and I’m not trying to say it's an easy trip. 

But having a tiny bit of hope, out of reach, and functionally non-existent? That's a circle of hell. 

Nelson's face is split, two malformed snouts, with an awkwardly hinged jaw. There’s power in the tumorous, deformed muscles driving it, but it's haphazard nature doesn't make for clean cuts. 

I throw my arm up instinctively, trying to protect myself. 

The first bite tears through skin and fat, just below my elbow. The pain takes a second to hit, giving me too much time to see the inner workings of my own limb. 

I'm screaming now, scrambling backward to space that isn't there. Doing nothing more than driving splinters into my hands and back. 

An eight fingered, lumpen hand pins me to the floor. Another, still nearly human roughly grabs my damaged arm. 

Nelson's next bite digs in. Muscle gives way, and a mismatched set of human and canine teeth find purchase in bone. 

My racing heart makes the wound spray blood. Pain makes me vomit, fear keeps me cowering. 

For a moment the world is black. 

I come to with Nelson whipping his head back and forth, I’m slammed against the rotting furniture. There's a cracking of bone, and a bolt of pain so bad I feel it in my teeth. 

Then, blessed darkness.

I struggle to claw back to consciousness, I see the mangled stump of my limb and give up the fight. 

"Wakey, wakey. 

There you go. Just needed to put 5 bucks worth in the tank.", Herman says. 

I'm in a chair, covered in blood and god knows what else. An ancient looking needle in one arm, hooked up to a hanging bag of blood. The other ends in a heavily stitched, chewed looking lump of flesh. 

I'm drugged up, I find myself thankful and bitter about it at the same time. 

"Did that go as planned?", I ask. 

"Honestly? My money was on you figuring things out. Literally. I did not want to clear Nelson's tab. 

But, live and learn. And hey, I got one hell of a consolation prize.",  Herman replies, waving the remains of my own severed arm at me. 

"You sick bastard.", I curse. 

"Now you're getting it. 

Whatever you think I have in store for you, it's nothing compared to what I'm really cooking up. 

I'm not just a sick bastard, I am , the, sick bastard. Just the things people know about me will be talked about for centuries. 

Now, I'm going to give you a couple hours, then we try something new. For your sake, I hope you do a little better this time.", Herman states, waving the arm once again as he gets up to leave. 

I don't know if it was his smug grin, his morbid taunting, or the cumulative effect of a year of being shit on by every type of creature on earth and beyond. But, I snap.

I'm on Herman as he gets up to leave, one end of the tubing connected to my good arm detaches from the bag, adding more blood to this already fetid room. 

Having been the type to work at a prison ( I assume successfully) I'm not a small guy. One armed or not, I’m a couple weight classes above Herman. 

For once, shock is on my side. As the looping roundhouse blow is thrown, Herman is confused. 

I fully expect him to shrug off the blow, or grab my wrist mid flight. But Herman isn't Demi. He may be old, wise and cruel, but he's also built like a 'Before' picture in a gym ad. 

He's thrown to the ground by the force of the blow, two teeth skitter across the rotten wood. My heart skips a beat, the open door demanding I run. 

But I'm not stupid. 

A one legged man in an ass kicking contest is at a disadvantage. But I even up that statistic for amputees everywhere. 

I don't kill him, or mutilate him. I've seen far too much of that lately, but I don't stop beating the man until I'm sure he's not chasing anyone. 

My first step out of the bedroom door feels like heaven. 

I don't get a second. 

A massive hand wraps itself around my neck, I’m lifted from the floor as if I was still a doll. 

Slowly, the thing holding me turns me to face it. 

I hear Herman stand. He coughs, a few more teeth hit the floor. 

"Didn't think you had that in you. 

I see you've met 752.

You know what he is? The absolute limit of what can be done with the human body. Everywhere an extra muscle, bone or nerve can be slapped on, he has it. 

Around here, there are so many different allegiances and interactions between void touched things, sometimes you just need a good old-fashioned person. 

Of course, they don't last very long. The human body isn't mean to be worked on like a sports car, but can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.", Herman says, hobbling over, a wicked sneer on his face. 

752 is huge, layers upon layers of muscle have deformed him into a hulking wall of flesh. I can see inflamed spots where bone has been added and is now nearly poking through his leather-like skin. 

Even if I knew what I was doing, there isn't so much as a mote of any kind of paranormal energy coming from 752. 

The worst part is that Herman doesn't even feel the need to get revenge. He doesn't taunt , or have his creature rip off my other arm. Just tells it, " Put him down, he understands now.".

Sadly, I do.

I walk back into the room, knowing I'm beyond outmatched. The door locks, and I'm left with my thoughts and the putrid odor of spoiled blood. 

I'm not breaking any new ground by saying this, but there is peace in accepting death. After about an hour of my mind trying to run through every possible plan to get out of here, I realize it's not going to happen. 

Am I happy? Hell no, but I finally get it. I understand the situation I'm in. 

I'm still afraid, I know things aren't going to end quietly. But my mind begins to slow down. The caged animal of panic finally being domesticated. 

I think of my friends, our journey, and my place in it. If I’m not going to be able to see things through to the end, I find some solace in the fact that they will. 

And it's in that moment of understanding. That shedding of the anxiety of the future, I feel it. More than that I understand it. That thing inside of me. 

It's a revelation, and a light in the darkness all at the same time. 

It isn't a weapon, hell it isn't even a tool. It's not Leo's compulsion, or Demi's trinkets. It's more like a sense. 

No matter how hard someone might want to, you really can't see things from someone else's point of view. You can understand, you can empathize, but you'll never truly see things exactly like they do. 

I can. 

Since I've been here I’ve been in a constant state of panic and fear. Going from one horrific scenario to the next. Doing nothing but fighting for every minute of life. 

Of course, this isn't a situation in which what I have does well. I'm not a warrior, I'm a diplomat. Leo may do his best work in the thick of battle, but I need calm. 

And as I find that calm, in my inevitable fate, ironically, I may be able to change it. 

I feel what it's like to be Page. I see as she sees, I feel as she feels. I can't control her, but I can understand what it's like to be something made from violence and the void. I feel every room, every floorboard. 

"Page, how well does Herman know his way around?", I don't say this, but think it. 

"Not very well. He prides himself on me be being some kind of chaotic maze that even he doesn't know. He mainly stays in the medical suite.", Page replies. 

Compared to the disjointed, meandering conversation I was trying to have earlier, she's clear as day. 

"I know how much control he has over you. I'm not asking you to help, but I think I can get out of here.", I state. 

Unlike Herman, I know every inch of this place. I could walk through it blindfolded and drunk.

"I know if I fail you're going to still be stuck with Herman, I don't expect you to put yourself in danger. 

But if you could stay as neutral as possible for as long as you can, it'd be a godsend.", I think. 

"All I am to him is an curiosity. Something mysterious to scare others.", is Page's reply. 

I sit, I feel, I understand. 

Herman is arguing with someone in his medical suite. Something about his torture isn't going to plan. He isn't watching me. 

752 is outside the door, and two more like him are between myself and Herman. 

The lock to the door is solid, but of a design popular before electricity. I've never picked a lock before, but I don't need to, it's a part of page. I understand it as much as I do my own (remaining) limbs. 

I slowly pull the IV from my arm. Low quality metal tugs at my skin and vein. But with a final pull, and a spurt of blood I was worried wouldn't stop, it's out. 

I kneel by the lock, heart starting to pound, making the connection to page stutter and weaken. 

I brace myself, knowing that once I open the door, my fate has been sealed. I'll either live or die by my own wits. 

I slide the needle into the pinhole on my side of the door. I push the tumblers and test the handle. 

It turns. 

I walk out the door, turning to face 752. There's confusion in his tiny, almost hamster-like eyes. 

I need to get him mad, I don't think he has much going on upstairs, but him simply warning Herman would end my plan before it begins.

"Did you ask Herman to make your upper half look like a swollen ballsack or was that accidental?", I begin. 

Somehow those dark, lifeless eyes convey a sense of rage. 

"What do you think you're going to do? Your legs are shaped like Vienna sausages. Catch me if you can you pile of spare fucking parts.", I taunt. 

Once he starts to move, I'm on the run, trusting in my intimate knowledge of how Page is made to keep me safe. 

Instantly I realise my comment about his speed is dead wrong. Stubby or not, he's running at easily twice my pace.

It doesn't matter though. This has to work. 

The floor shakes as 752 gives chase. I'm watching the doors, feeling what's behind them. 

I slow down just enough to turn an out of place chrome knob on a cheap plywood door. I know about the hidden door inside the room. And how it's too small for 752 to fit through. 

I jump before my eyes adjust to the jarring darkness, I also know about the pit in the middle buried a mile into the poisoned earth of this place. 

I'm high, probably in mild shock, and low on blood. I may know every inch of this place, but my body has it's limits. 

I falter, my left foot struggling to find purchase on a thin corner of remaining floorboard. I try and throw my arms out for balance, but the recent non-requested modifications further disrupt my balance. 

For a brief moment I feel my right foot start to slip. A quarter second of heart stopping weightlessness before I grab a rotten wall-stud and steady myself. 

That fear, breaks the connection to Page. 

Scared, lightheaded and running on something that can only be described as a plan in the loosest sense of the term, I'm still doing better than 752. 

It charges into the room, impossible speed actually carrying it a few feet before it realizes something's wrong. 

It twists itself awkwardly, long arms digging into the remnants of floor next to me. 

It's too big to pull itself up, but the rotten wood and plaster is starting to crumble. It thrashes it's body, determined to make me share it's fate.

Fingernails crack, then split as I grip the mold encrusted beam. 

In a burst of plaster and damp wood, 752 falls. My heart pounds as I steady myself  barely enough floor left for purchase. 

I let my heart slow, I need to have that connection to Page. This place isn't constructed according to any rules of architecture or nature. 

But like a cheap radio, I find myself slowly tuning back in. 

I open the cleverly hidden door, making my way into a small staff kitchen. I take a moment, grabbing a large cleaver. I don't plan on trying to go toe to toe with anything, but better safe than sorry. 

The other two like 752 are waiting in the hallway beyond. There's no path in the lunatic floorplan that can get me to Herman without taking me past them. 

With two of them, I’m not going to be able to pull the same trick. They may not be bright, but I’m not dealing with robots. I'm going to have to get rid of both of them at the same time. 

What I wouldn't give for my friends to be here. But it's just me.

Before I open the door, I find myself thinking of how, maybe, just me is what this situation needed. I don't know if I believe it, but it's a comforting thought. 

This time I don't taunt, I need every inch of space between me and these abominations as I can get. Unfortunately, as I sprint toward a staircase with a rusted metal door, they are on me almost instantly. 

The things are fast, but clumsy. I jump from one set of stairs to the next, vaulting over the rail. Stitches pop from the exertion, but it's the only way I can stay ahead. 

The doors I enter would seem random to anyone else. But with every panicked step, I’m going deeper into Page, farther away from little things like logic and the rules of nature. 

With every floor, with every mismatched stairwell, things around me make a little less sense. By the time I figure I’ve gone deep enough, I’m in a dimly lit collection of random doors, windows, and furniture. 

I can hear the two creatures behind me, my connection to page is dim. I breathe, I think of what’s on the line. Of what Herman could do to everyone else if I fail.

The door I entered begins to open, I see a malformed hand grab the frame. I find a moment of peace, and open a triangular doorway on the ground, just in time to hear enraged bellows behind me. 

I'm outside the medical suite, I lean against a wall, letting my panic vent. It strikes me as a bit cruel to leave the creatures there, but a lot is on the line.  

"For the love of Christ, why are we haggling, when you're an hour late? It's not that I’m arguing, it's that I only have so much money on hand.", Herman screams into a 90's style cordless phone. 

I've done all the being calm I can do. This thing inside of me is taxing in it's own way. Bottling up fear, and anger is only letting the emotions stew and fortify. 

Herman could have any number of nasty surprizes waiting for me. I can't feel a thing from Page at the moment. But I've came so far. 

I bring the cleaver down with an audible thump into a wooden table. Herman, startled, drops his phone. 

"724, 796!", he screams. 

"They are stuck so far in the bowels of this place, they're never getting out.", I reply. 

Herman grins smugly.

"You think they're the only security I have?", He taunts. 

"Right now? I'm positive. 

Whatever is in that drawer you keep looking at might as well be on Mars. I'll be kicking your teeth down your throat before you get to it. 

But, let's not get to that point, okay? Sit.", I say. 

I can see Herman trying to figure out a way out of this situation, but he begrudgingly complies. 

"Can you actually get us to the Bishop?", I ask, bluntly. 

"Yes, of course, already done really. His stay was brief, but he didn't make many friends. 

I could have you and your friends no less than a days travel behind him. Not to mention all of the information I've found.", Herman pleads. 

"I'm going to hold you to that. 

You've shown me my place in things. And in a sense, that makes you lucky. See, I've been trying to be like my friends, and they would be nailing you to a wall right now. 

But, that's not where I do my best work. 

Here's my offer. You get us on the road to the Bishop, with as much aid as you can muster. I tell my friends I got hurt looking around places I shouldn't, and you got hurt saving me.", I offer. 

"That sounds more than...but I’m not hurt?", Herman replies, confused. 

I look to the cleaver, dull edge buried in the table. 

"You don't have much supernatural in you, but I don't need that to get you. 

If I let you out of this without evening the score a little, you're going to see me as weak. And sooner or later, I'm going to have to deal with you again. 

I want to remind you to listen to reason. 

Pick an ear. And don't think I'm letting you grab a scalpel.", I say, my tone grim, and final. 

And that's where I'll leave everyone this week. Hot on the Bishop's trail, and with the finish line in sight. 

Thank you everyone that has stayed with me this far. 

Listen to each other. 

Punch.
