Today I remembered when I was abducted by aliens awhile ago; like maybe, 12 years ago. I remembered this when I was working out. I am a firm believer working out is like time travel for anything that is on or in your mind, the harder you work out, the quicker you get to completing ideas and things upon the subconscious and other levels of the brain. 

So anyway the abduction goes as follows, a quick note though. I had always kinda thought about the night this happened, but was a ignorant democrat of a teenager kinda deal, you know what I’m sayin? You know what I’m sayin. And so I was in bed a sophomore or freshman in, you know, high school at my age. I was like 16, but I was in my bed upstairs asleep and I was what felt like a flash crash, a grenade that flashes an enemy. How could it be a flash crash right, because everyone in my family would wake from that? So a soft flash crash apparently was thrown in my room with a gas because I felt light headed and woke up, but could not move whilst I was asleep. Just because this is reminiscent of a sleep paralysis demon, does not mean I saw one on my chest, this time; two years later I was visited by a paralysis demon, but that is a story for later in this body of text. 

Back to being in my room. I was laying on my right and looking out my window apparently. Because when I was asleep; it is very possible something entered and was behind me or to the left of my bed if you are laying down on your back and looking up, the left side being the left of the bed, near a closet. I was pushed off my bed as I was daising  from the dizziness from the alien weapon from the entity now definitely in my room. After I was pushed off my bed, I didn’t black out, but I don’t remember anything except waking up on my bed and remembering that as the last thing, it being as real as the dinner I ate the previous meal.

I was moved to another school and state later that year or two years later. At this new house I was visited whilst asleep in the basement, huge basement. I couldn't move and a shadow of a person, a completely dark shadow of this person about five inches away from my face was just staring at me. Anyway I was visited with sleep paralysis two years after this incident too. I moved back to the other state again and into a dorm room for the local state college. I roomed with this big, great person. Let's call him Adam, I guess, not real the real name of my dude; so anyway I was asleep after some college classes in the dorm, and low and behold I couldn’t move. It was the afternoon I had woken up in a sleep paralysis stupor. I wanted to move my legs but couldn’t, I don’t think I could open my eyes, but that is not important because this part was funny. I was able to mumble, like a mumble rapper, when I used all my might in this sleep paralysis. My friend Adam who was chillin on his bed (whilst I was hangin out on the ground for a nappie nap) he hears me go, “(incoherent) (louder incoherence) (Yelling) “Help, help!” 

He told me when he heard that, and I remember this episode, he was just kinda like, “u wut m8?” You know: he was like, “...What..? What is happening?” 

I was just laying there yellin for like two minutes until all my limbs unlocked and moved again. In conclusion, I had always remembered my three sleep paralysis episodes happening over like six years, but in the first one, where I was on my bed and pushed off; that is wild, that is exotic. I was never pushed or moved or felt something move me, or felt stunned from alien weaponry, during the other ones. The second one where I saw a shadow was wild, and I will draw a picture. The third one where I was immobile in front of my new roommate friend in college because I was exhausted from class, was a funny one. So, back to the point, I had never been pushed off a bed before during sleep paralysis and therefore am pretty sure I was straight up abducted by that one mate. Oddly enough the military is playing with hologram UFO’s connected to F16 so that in 2025 the month of Jan and the day of the sixth, at night across the US there will be an alien weaponry invasion. Again it is just exotic weapons that work in reality so it is an F16 connecting to a holographic projector. Thousands of these will be flown over the US at night, and other continents. The night will cover the F16 and the hologram of the UFO will be visible. The F16 will be connected to distracting lazer pointers but also machine guns and thermite bombs. This will be to make the election stand still. 

The last sleep paralysis was probably also PTSD from being followed and introduced to an entity those six consecutive years. What should I do next time it visits? I am just kidding, I don’t have sleep paralysis anymore.
