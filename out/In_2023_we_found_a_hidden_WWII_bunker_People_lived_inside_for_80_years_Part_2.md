[Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1yi85/in_2023_we_found_a_wwii_fortress_in_a_german/) \- **Part II (FINAL)**

Enzo Flores arrived with Anselm Becker close to six in the morning. The snowfall showed no sign of easing, and neither did the temper of the lead workman. I heard him long before I saw him. He began to roar over the wind, and I unzipped the tent to see two men walking under the spotlight.  
  
“WHERE IS HE?” Enzo shouted at me.  
  
“I’ll show you,” I meekly responded, stepping out of the tent.  
  
We hurried in silence up the slope, following the bloody trail along the rock-face. It had mostly been covered by fresh snow.  
  
I moved quickly, afraid of Enzo catching up to me and giving me a proper scolding. But I eventually stopped in front of the torn entrance to the ventilation shaft. I hadn’t told Mr Flores of the horrifying revelations I found in the diary.  
  
There’s nobody other than Amir down there, I fearfully and unconvincingly told my rapid heartbeat.  
  
“What were you thinking?” The lead labourer screamed over the gusty weather.  
  
“I asked him not to follow me,” I croakily replied.  
  
“How would that be better?” Enzo asked. “You would have been the one stuck down there. And he wouldn’t even know.”  
  
“It’s done now,” Anselm softly said, attempting to diffuse the tension.  
  
“Not until we’ve found him,” Enzo huffed, charging into the entrance.  
  
I followed our disgruntled leader into the metal tunnel, and his timid worker joined me. After a minute or two of scurrying along the winding passageway, we arrived at the hole above the bedroom.  
  
“He’s in there,” I sighed as Enzo shone his torch’s light into the hole. “We’re back, Amir!”  
  
There was no response.  
  
Enzo jumped through the opening in the vent and landed on the bedroom floor with feline nimbleness. Anselm and I widened our eyes in shock.  
  
“He’s not down here,” Enzo growled. “Is this the wrong room, Miss Craven?”  
  
“What?” I asked, peering into the hole. “No, that’s… There’s the bed that broke when… This is the room, Mr Flores.”  
  
My heartbeat quickened again. Words from the journal sounded in my brain, overlapping in a jarring cacophony. I thought of the underground society in ruins. Thought of Fritz Vogel. I wondered what had happened to him and the others after the final legible entry in 1996.  
  
That was nearly thirty years ago, I reminded myself. They’re all dead now.  
  
“Well, he’s gone,” Enzo angrily pointed out. “Did he fancy a stroll? Eh?”  
  
“I… I don’t know…” I whispered.  
  
“The door’s open,” Our leader said. “Was it open when you were in here?”  
  
“I don’t remember,” I said. “Maybe… No… No, it wasn’t.”  
  
“Right. So, he’s in this place. Somewhere. Do you have any idea of the dangers that might lurk down here?” Enzo barked.  
  
I stammered. “I’ll p-pay you more for–”  
  
“– Pay me more?” The man brayed hysterically. “Are you joking? There is no amount of money that covers this. This bunker is nearly a century old. It’s falling apart at the seams. Exploring it will kill us. Is that what my life is worth to you, Miss Craven? A few extra pounds?”  
  
“You need to breathe, Enzo,” Anselm said. “We’re coming down, and–”  
  
“– Well, of course you’re coming down!” The Spaniard spat. “How do you expect me to live with Amir’s death on my conscience? We have to find him.”  
  
Enzo lifted his broad arms and motioned with his hands.  
  
“Jump,” He bluntly ordered.  
  
“I think you and I should do this alone,” Anselm stated.  
  
“No. She’s coming,” Enzo hissed.  
  
I didn’t argue. I slid my legs over the edge and fell into Enzo’s grip. He roughly handled my waist, as if meaning to hurt me. And then he delicately helped Anselm Becker down. Moving my flash-light around, nothing in the deserted bedroom looked different — other than the open door. There were no signs left by Amir. None that I noticed, anyway.  
  
“Lead the way, Miss Craven,” Enzo said, nodding at the door.  
  
I gulped, terrified by the fact that the torch’s light seemed to do nothing to permeate the thick sea of blackness beyond the open doorway. And when I left the safe confines of the bedroom, I found myself standing in a forgotten hallway lined with an endless sea of doors. I looked back at the bedroom door. Room 421. I committed that to my memory.  
  
“How do we find him?” I asked.  
  
“I have no idea, Miss Craven,” Enzo sighed. “I’m a labourer. Not a search-and-rescue specialist. I was expecting to find a man with a twisted ankle in that room. A simple in-and-out job.”  
  
“Perhaps we should head down the mountain,” Anselm said. “Find some proper help.”  
  
Before Enzo or I acknowledged Anselm’s wise comment, a distant sound of pain filled the corridor — either groaning metal or a groaning voice.  
  
“Miss Craven… You said you saw something…” Enzo whispered. “What exactly did you see?”  
  
I gulped, shaking my head in terror. “No, I… No, no… It isn’t… I don’t…”  
  
A reverberating scream tunnelled down the hallway, pinging off the walls. It sent a ripple of shivers down my spine.  
  
It was Amir.  
  
“We’re not turning around now,” Enzo said, lifting the torch. “It came from this direction.”  
  
“You’re not serious…” Anselm said. “I didn’t sign up for this. You told me we were lifting a guy out of a hole, but this is insane. What did I just hear?”  
  
“Amir,” I whimpered.  
  
“No,” Anselm said, shaking his head. “Before that… You know what I mean.”  
  
I did. But I didn’t want to think about what had made that awful moaning noise.  
  
“I want to know what destroyed the ventilation shaft,” Enzo said. “Nothing’s coming to mind, Miss Craven. And your face is growing paler by the second. I’ll ask one more time. What did you see?”  
  
“I wasn’t afraid of what I saw…” I whispered, pulling the diary out of my pocket. “I was afraid of what I read.”  
  
Enzo eyed me frightfully, as if reading the secrets of the journal in my petrified gaze.  
  
“I don’t want to know, do I?” He whispered knowingly. “I want to find Mr Langton and leave this place.”  
  
Anselm uttered a sound of protest, but Enzo had already begun to walk down the hallway — leading us towards the source of the groaning.  
  
“Holy…” Enzo gasped, stopping suddenly.  
  
I didn’t have to ask. My eyes were drawn to the spot on the floor that he was illuminating.  
  
A threadbare soldier’s uniform was lying in a mound of dust. The final resting place of some poor, decayed soul. And as we continued along the corridor, we saw others. Through open doorways, we saw uniforms on beds. The victims of the White Death.  
  
Or something worse. I thought of Fritz’s final entry. The revelation that Doctor Klein had cured the new generation of Tollerberg. But it had cost their humanity. Without treatment, a person’s mind joined with the disease. Plagued all thoughts. From the final pages of Fritz’s journal, that much was clear.  
  
“Kantine…” Enzo said, reading a sign. “I assume that means ‘canteen’?”  
  
I nodded, and our leader led us down the corridor that the sign was pointing towards. I felt unsettled about leaving the main hallway. I only hoped we would be able to find our way back to the room of Fritz Vogel. Room 421.  
  
“Lord above, save us,” Enzo cried, illuminating the deserted canteen.  
  
It was filled with long tables, and several uniforms of decayed soldiers lay on the benches. Citizens, I should say. In the end, there were no soldiers. Only the malformed children of Nazis and prisoners.  
  
“There are fresh footprints in the dust,” Enzo said, pointing at the floor. “He’s not here, but he’s close.”  
  
Anselm noted the exit at the far side of the canteen. “That way.”  
  
We headed out of the canteen, and I quaked as we passed dozens of empty uniforms. Only, I knew that the clothes weren’t empty. The ashy remains of dead bunker-dwellers sat within the mounds of clothes left behind. But my greatest fear lay beyond the dining area. The canteen exited onto another hallway, and Enzo pointed at a long-faded board on the wall.  
  
“Waffenkammer,” He said. “The arrow points left. What does that word mean, Miss Craven?”  
  
I choked tearfully. “Armoury…”  
  
“Well, the dust trail leads that way, so–”  
  
“– No,” I interrupted, shaking my head. “We have to leave this place.”  
  
“What?” Enzo frowned. “This is your fault, Miss Craven. We’re not leaving Mr Langton behind.”  
  
“I know,” I said, shaking. “But that’s why I don’t want anyone else to…”  
  
“What?” Flores pressed. “Spit it out, Craven. I know you’re keeping something from me.”  
  
Another unearthly wail sounded from the end of the corridor. There were no doors along the hallway. Only one at the end. The entrance to the west wing.  
  
The Armoury. A prison for the souls cursed with the White Death.  
  
Enzo and Anselm began walking down the corridor, and my knocking knees slowed my pace as I unwillingly followed them. The two men had no idea what lay in wait. They only wanted the whole ordeal to end.  
  
It would. Soon enough.  
  
When we reached the door labelled ‘Waffenkammer’, we realised it wasn’t much of a door at all. It had been torn in half, with planks of festering wood lying on the floor. A pit of darkness lay beyond the half-demolished door, and it swung open with a tender push.  
  
We entered a narrow walkway lined with metal cages. Each barred section housed abandoned boxes of ammunition, and ancient rifles were attached to the walls. There were worn mattresses and more crumpled uniforms on the floors of the cages. This had been the first ward of the quarantine zone. The German ward.  
  
There came another sound. Quieter, this time. The pitiful cry of a pained dog. Breathy crying. Laboured crying.  
“Something’s in here…” Anselm wailed, his voice bouncing off the walls of the confined corridor.  
  
His utterance deadened the crying, and the hallway plunged into silence.  
  
A shadow danced along the wall — a shape just beyond the glow of Enzo’s light. There was a moment of stillness. No movement or sound. The false calmness at the eye of a storm. And then a moan sounded from the ceiling, followed by a thump — something had landed between us and the door. We turned to face whatever had trapped us in the armoury.  
  
Darkness charged forwards.  
  
A colossal being darted towards us — a humanoid of such enormity that it could not fit comfortably between the cages of ammunition. Its flesh puckered and creased as it squished its horrible, portly form through the narrow corridor. It was an abomination that should never have walked the surface of Earth. Fritz's final entry did not do the hellish thing justice. Its infected skin oozed darkened sludge and puss, and its eyes were bulbous, grey, unseeing spheres.  
  
But it sensed us.  
  
The creature swiped at my screeching face, tearing into my flesh, and I braced for what I hoped would be a swift death. However, Enzo Flores stepped between the beast and me. And he was in the creature’s grasp before I’d even blinked.  
  
The dreadful demon, distended beyond natural limits, was somehow holding itself together with rotting, diseased, stretch-marked flesh.  
  
“RUN!” Enzo yelled, grappling with the thing that used to be human.  
  
Anselm and I continued to run down the hallway, seeing no way out other than pressing forwards. We heard the sounds of squelching and screaming. Shredding flesh. Crunching bones. Anselm lit the way with his torch, and we saw a door fifty yards ahead — just as the ominous sounds ceased. And the frightened labourer shoulder-barged the door with all of his might. It burst open, and we scurried inside.  
  
A mighty shriek was unleashed behind us. The battle cry of something neither living nor dead.  
  
“SHUT IT!” Anselm screamed.  
  
I hurriedly slammed the door and fiddled with the rusty lock until it clicked. And then I turned around to find myself facing the ward that matched the description Fritz Vogel had given. A second line of cages, much like those in the first section of the armoury, except the German ward had makeshift rooms. The shabby quarters in the second hallway clearly belonged to the prisoners.  
  
“What exactly is written in that book?” Anselm suddenly asked.  
  
I shook my head. “Enzo was right. You don’t want to know.”  
  
Anselm nodded, and we walked along another hallway of ammunition cages that had been transformed into homes for the sick. Bland, grey clothes — bearing the prisoners’ numbers — lay in piles within the cages. The bodies of soldiers and their children. Kept imprisoned decades after the end of the war. A terrifying thought in itself. A thought only interrupted by a terrible wheezing noise.  
  
“Do you hear that?” Anselm asked weakly. “It sounds like–”  
  
“– Breathing,” I moaned in horror.  
  
I expected to see another ghoul lurking in the shadows at the end of the corridor, but I realised the sound was coming from my side. And then I cast my torch’s light into one of the cages — a room with warped metal bars.  
  
Within the room, two uniformed prisoners were drenched in blood and dirt. The numbers were concealed by years of filth. And their clothes were ripping at the seams, thanks to their bulging forms. But most dreadfully, they were glued together. Their flesh had joined, like two rotten mounds of clay mushed into one awful entity.  
  
The two mouths of the entity opened in unison, revealing black, toothless chasms.  
  
“Warm,” They said together. “Eat warmth…”  
  
Horrified, I recalled the deranged scribbles of Fritz Vogel. He had said similar things.  
  
“No…” Anselm yelped, lighting a patch of floor beside the conjoined prisoners.  
  
I recognised the crumpled heap. Two crumpled heaps.  
  
Amir.  
  
His body had been torn at the waist, and his intestines tied the two separated halves together. I wailed, mind disintegrating as I eyeballed my friend’s undignified corpse. I didn’t want to imagine the horror and pain he had endured in his final moments of life. And as I noted the chunks of flesh missing from his body, along with the fresh blood on the lips of the conjoined prisoners, I understood the full, twisted truth.  
  
Eat warmth.  
  
A booming thud interrupted my thoughts.  
  
“The door…” Anselm whispered. “That thing is about to break through it!”  
  
I was lost in a daze, but the labourer grabbed my shoulders and twisted me to face him.  
  
“Danica,” He said. “I’ll get you out of here. When it passes your cage, run.”  
  
I didn’t respond. Tears painted my petrified face. But the man shoved my detached body into the open cage on the opposite side of the hallway. He switched my torch off and placed a finger to his lips. The creature barrelled into the ward of the prisoners.  
  
I was barely cognisant of Anselm running down the hallway, moving towards the end of the room, but I realised what he was doing.  
  
“HEY!” He screamed at the creature, waving his torch.  
  
It was over in seconds.  
  
The bulbous being, almost supernatural in essence, fired down the walkway, unaware of me. And it lunged towards the screaming labourer at the far end of the armoury. I slipped out of the cage, subconsciously fleeing the scene. Some primitive urge controlled my physical form. But I consciously twisted my head, foolishly locking eyes with the horrible sight at the end of the room. The creature tore Anselm to pieces in seconds. The worker didn’t have time to utter a sound or make a move. But that isn’t why my mouth gaped in horror.  
  
The creature’s bare back, coloured black and green from disease, bore six swollen, circular wounds.  
  
It’s not him, I told myself, stifling a scream.  
  
I ran. Ran faster than my legs should have been able to carry me. And I expected the once-person to catch me before I made it to the canteen, let alone the bedroom. But it didn’t pursue me. And when I finally fazed back into reality, I was standing in Room 421, gazing up at the hole in the vent.  
  
I barely remember how I got there. I know I waded through the muck of Enzo’s half-devoured corpse, but that memory is a disjointed nightmare. There are blank spots in my mind. A protection mechanism, perhaps.  
  
After heaving the remaining bunk bed under the hole and crossing my fingers, I hauled my body onto it. It did not collapse under my weight, and I managed to pull myself into the ventilation shaft. Sobbing, reduced to a broken being, I stumbled through the winding tunnel and entered a world dimly lit by the dawning sun. A red hue streaked the sky, and the blizzard had quietened. Flecks of snow fell gently, and the breeze blew quietly. The mountain felt unnaturally still. Unaware of the horror that lay below its surface.  
  
I ran down the slope, eventually falling into the main road of the town below. I was a sobbing, unintelligible heap. Shivering on a snowy street, I was found by a local hotel receptionist — disturbed by the sound of wailing in a town that was ordinary so peaceful.  
  
I told everyone everything. I didn’t care how crazy I sounded. They would see for themselves when they entered Tollerberg. To an extent, they did. After breaching the bunker door and exploring the facility, they found so much of what I described. The uniforms of fallen soldiers. The destroyed vent. The blood.  
  
Even the remnants of my team.  
  
But no sign of the monsters. They had fled. The psychiatrist still tells me that ‘they never existed’. After all, what remained of my team members had been found in a pile of rubble at the far end of the armoury.  
  
A collapsed ceiling killed them. That remains the official verdict. But I know better. I know what I saw. I have the diary of the Vogels. Most tellingly, I have the scar on my face. A scar that still hasn’t healed. It worsens by the day. My blue pupils have been fading to grey. And there is a voice in my head that I don’t recognise. One that hungers for something I don’t understand.
