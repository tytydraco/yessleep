I Found My Journal 


Sometimes, memories play tricks on you. They can be vivid, replaying like a film reel when you close your eyes, each frame sharp and unforgiving. Other times, they’re fleeting, slipping away into the ether, never to return unless some unexpected spark reignites the long-cold ashes. My father died when I was seven. We were on our way to my grandmother’s house for Thanksgiving dinner, the scent of pumpkin pie still lingering in the car from the bakery stop. Breaking Benjamin’s “Diary of Jane” was playing on the radio, its bassline vibrating through the seats. Then, everything unraveled. A drunk driver swerved into our lane. I don’t remember much after that—just the blinding flash of headlights and the sound of twisting metal. I’m grateful my memory failed me; what little I recall is already too much.


The accident changed everything. I became a shadow of myself—silent at school, withdrawn at home. Words felt useless, so I stopped speaking altogether, retreating into a world of solitude. My mother, though grieving, did her best to hold us both together. She smiled when she needed to, pretended everything was fine, but her eyes always betrayed her. I see it now, but back then, all I saw was someone to blame. I lashed out at her in ways I wish I could take back, shouting accusations I barely understood. Somewhere in my mind, it felt easier to pin my father’s death on her than to face the emptiness it left behind.


Eventually, my mother took me to a therapist. The sessions were quiet at first—I couldn’t bring myself to speak—but the therapist was patient. She diagnosed me with PTSD and depression, explaining it in terms a child could understand: “Your brain is scared all the time, even when it doesn’t need to be.” She suggested I find a way to express myself, to give my sadness and anger somewhere to go. One afternoon, she handed me a large black notebook with my name embossed on the cover in gold letters. “Try writing down your thoughts,” she said gently. “It doesn’t have to be perfect. Just write.”


So, I did. Every night, I poured my heart onto those pages, filling them with my pain, my questions, my quiet rage. By the time I finished, the journal felt like a part of me—raw and heavy. But when the last page was filled, I couldn’t bear to look at it again. I placed it on a shelf and left it there, buried beneath years of dust and avoidance. Until today.


It started with an innocuous conversation—just my mother reminiscing about my childhood. “You loved summer camp,” she said suddenly, her voice warm with nostalgia. I blinked, confused. “I never went to summer camp,” I replied. But she insisted, with surprising conviction, that I had gone every summer for four years after the accident. I wanted to laugh it off; after all, her dementia had been worsening. But there was something in her voice, an unshakable certainty, that unsettled me.


Still, I shrugged it off—until that nagging feeling wouldn’t let me rest. Something didn’t sit right. That night, I climbed into the attic, unearthed the dusty box where I’d stashed my old journal, and opened it for the first time in years. As I flipped through the pages, my breath caught in my throat.


It turns out, I was the one mis-remembering.

Camp Willowcreek


When my mom dropped me off at Camp Willowcreek, I forced a smile and tried to look excited. Inside, though, my stomach churned with unease. It wasn’t the camp itself that bothered me. On the surface, it was the perfect postcard setting: the lake shimmered under the afternoon sun, its surface so still it looked like glass. The cabins, tucked into neat clusters, had a rustic charm, their weathered wood exuding a sense of history.


But the woods surrounding the camp—those felt wrong. The trees were ancient, their gnarled branches reaching out like crooked fingers, their dense canopy creating an almost oppressive shadow that swallowed the edges of the camp in perpetual twilight. Brambles and thorny bushes wove themselves between the trunks, forming a natural wall that seemed more like a warning than a barrier. On one side, the lake stretched endlessly toward the horizon, deceptively serene. On the other side? Miles upon miles of wilderness, dark and untouched. Only two paths led in and out: the gravel road my mom had driven down and a narrow, winding trail that circled the lake.


It didn’t feel like a camp. It felt like a trap.


The first day passed in a blur of forced smiles and awkward introductions. I wandered the campgrounds, avoiding eye contact, wondering how I’d survive the weeks ahead without knowing a single soul. That’s when I met Christy and Jonathan.


Christy was magnetic from the start—her laugh bright and unfiltered, her energy infectious. She seemed to have no fear of anything. While the rest of us cautiously climbed trees during the afternoon activity, she scrambled up with ease, her movements quick and fluid, like a chipmunk on Adderall.


Jonathan was her opposite in every way. He was quieter, preferring to linger on the sidelines, observing more than participating. But when he spoke, it was worth listening to. He had a knack for storytelling, spinning wild tales that always started with, “My brother says...” His stories were ridiculous, often bordering on the absurd, but he delivered them with such conviction it was hard not to get sucked in. He had this way of making you question if maybe, just maybe, there was some truth buried in his words.


Jonathan was a couple of years older than Christy and me, but the age difference didn’t seem to matter. Within hours, we’d fallen into an easy rhythm, drawn together by our shared awkwardness. I didn’t have any friends at the camp, and it didn’t seem like they did either, but by the end of the day, it felt like the three of us had been a team forever.


That night, the bonfire roared, its flames licking at the night sky, casting a warm glow that only deepened the darkness beyond the clearing. The air was thick and humid, yet a strange wind whispered through the trees, rustling the leaves in a way that made the forest seem alive. Shadows danced against the treeline, stretching and twisting with the firelight, forming shapes that looked unnervingly like monsters creeping just out of reach.


Most of the kids were carefree, laughing as they roasted marshmallows, their faces smeared with sticky sweetness. They darted around the fire in wild, uneven circles, their energy crackling almost as brightly as the flames. The three of us sat just beyond the chaos, close enough to feel the heat of the fire and hear their laughter but far enough to avoid the frantic whirl of activity. From our spot, we traded laughter and jokes at their careless antics.


Then Jonathan broke the spell.


“Have you guys heard about the Whispering Cabin?” he asked, his voice barely above a murmur, as though afraid the words might summon something.


“No,” I said, glancing at Christy. Her head tilted in curiosity, her mischievous grin catching the firelight.


Jonathan leaned in, his eyes glinting with that storyteller’s spark. “It’s an old, abandoned cabin deep in the woods,” he began. “The counselors don’t talk about it, but my brother says a man named Mr. Beans used to live there. He said he went crazy—started whispering to himself all the time—and one day, he just… disappeared. Some people think he’s still out there.”


Christy snorted, though the laughter in her voice was tinged with unease. “That’s so dumb,” she said, shaking her head.


“Why’s he called Mr. Beans?” I asked, though my voice faltered. I tried to sound skeptical, but my voice was underlined with a tone of fear.


Jonathan shrugged, his expression serious. “No one knows. Maybe he liked beans. Or maybe it’s just a name they gave him. But they say if you get too close to the cabin, you can hear him whispering—like he’s talking to someone, or something.”


The words sent a chill through me, prickling my skin despite the heat of the fire. “You’re making that up,” I said, hoping to dismiss the growing tension.


Jonathan’s grin widened, sly and teasing. “Maybe. But we could go check it out. See for ourselves.”


Christy’s eyes lit up, her grin widening. “Let’s do it!” she said, her excitement unmistakable.


I hesitated, the weight of unease settling in my chest. The idea of sneaking into the woods felt like tempting fate. But the last thing I wanted was to seem like a coward. “Fine,” I said at last, trying to mask my reluctance. “But if we get caught, don’t think I won’t snitch on you both.”


Christy laughed, giving me a playful shove. Jonathan’s grin only deepened, and the three of us sat back, watching the fire burn brighter, as if mocking the dark unknown waiting for us in the woods.


That night, after we were sure the counselors and other kids had fallen asleep, we slipped out quietly, flashlights in hand and an old, tattered map Jonathan had "borrowed" from the camp office. The moonlight barely pierced the thick canopy of trees as we made our way onto the forgotten trail. We followed the map as best as we could, our feet crunching softly on the damp ground. The woods were darker than I’d imagined, the trees so close together that they swallowed the moonlight, leaving us shrouded in shadow. With each step, the air grew heavier, thicker, as if the forest itself were closing in around us. The deeper we went, the quieter it became—each cicada's song, each cricket’s call fading slowly, one by one, until the only sound was the steady rhythm of our footsteps. Every crack of a branch underfoot, every rustle of leaves, made my heart race, but Christy and Jonathan pressed on, so I did too.


It felt like we’d been walking forever, the path winding in strange directions, when we finally saw it: a small, crumbling cabin, almost hidden in the thick woods. Its outline barely broke the silhouette of the trees, and the dim light of our flashlights flickered weakly on the dilapidated structure. All the windows and the lone front door were boarded up, and the roof sagged as though it might collapse at any moment.


"That’s gotta it," Jonathan whispered, his voice almost drowned out by the distant howls of the wind.


"Looks like it’s about to fall apart," Christy said, her voice quieter than usual, an edge of unease creeping into her tone.


“I think we should go back. What if the counselors notice we’re gone?” I asked, my voice tight with apprehension. But Jonathan and Christy were already moving toward the cabin, the excitement of discovery overriding my warnings. They ignored me and continued closer, their shadows stretching long behind them.


As we crept nearer, I felt the air change—it grew colder, the temperature dropping unnaturally. There was a faint, rancid smell in the air, like rotten meat mixed with something metallic, a scent so putrid it nearly made me gag.


"Do you hear that?" Christy asked suddenly, her voice barely audible.


At first, I thought she was talking about the wind, but then I heard it too—a faint whispering, so soft it was almost imperceptible, like a voice carried in the breeze. It seemed to be coming from the cabin, just beyond the reach of the light.


"Maybe it’s just the wind," I said, my voice trembling, though I didn’t believe it for a second.


"Let’s find out," Christy said, already stepping toward the door, her footsteps quiet but determined.


"Wait!" I hissed, but it was too late. She was already halfway up the porch stairs. Jonathan was close behind, and despite every instinct screaming at me to turn back, I had no choice but to follow.


As we reached the door, the whispering suddenly stopped, plunging us into a suffocating silence. The door was boarded up, but beneath the rotting wood, I could see strange symbols carved deep into the grain of the door, jagged and raw, as though something—or someone—had tried to claw its way out.


"This is so weird," Christy said, shining her flashlight on the symbols, her voice tinged with a mix of curiosity and dread. "What are these?"


"Let’s just go," I said quickly, my stomach twisting in knots, the sudden sense of danger sinking in deep.


Jonathan crouched down, running his fingers over one of the symbols, his flashlight casting a faint glow on his face, making his features look eerily distorted. “They look old... like ancient old,” he murmured, his voice distant.


Christy knocked on the door. “Hello, Mr. Beans? You home?” she said with forced cheer, her voice echoing unnaturally loud, as if the cabin itself were amplifying her words.


“Stop that!” I hissed, yanking her back by the arm, but just as she moved, there was a creak from inside the cabin, slow and deliberate, like something was shifting across the old, rotting wood.


The three of us froze, our breath catching in our throats. Jonathan’s flashlight wavered, the beam jittering as he tried to steady it. “Did you hear that?” he whispered, his voice barely audible.


“It was probably just a raccoon or something,” Christy said, though there was no conviction in her voice. She didn’t believe it, and neither did I.


Jonathan was the first to move. “I’m going around back,” he said, his tone firm, despite the unease hanging in the air.


“Are you crazy?” I grabbed at his sleeve, but he shrugged me off. “What if someone’s in there? A hiker or—”


“Or Mr. Beans?” Christy teased, though her voice had lost its usual spark of humor.


Jonathan didn’t answer. He simply edged around the side of the cabin, his flashlight beam cutting through the darkness. Christy and I hesitated, the forest feeling like it was closing in on us, the trees whispering secrets we couldn’t understand. When Jonathan disappeared from view, we had no choice but to follow.


Behind the cabin was a small window, one of the only ones not fully boarded up. Jonathan was already there, standing on his tiptoes, his breath fogging the glass as he peered inside. His flashlight hung loosely from his hand, casting wild, useless flickers on the ground.


“Do you see anything?” Christy whispered, her voice a sharp contrast to the silence surrounding us.


Jonathan didn’t answer at first. His gaze never left the window, his face pale in the dim light. Finally, he stepped back, his eyes wide. “There’s something in there,” he said, his voice barely a whisper.


“What do you mean, something?” I asked, dread pooling in my stomach, my throat tightening.


“It’s—” he stopped, shaking his head. “I don’t know. It’s just... standing there.”


Christy shoved past him, her eyes wide with curiosity and fear. She pressed her face to the window, her gasp sharp and sudden, sending a cold rush of panic through me. “Oh my God,” she whispered. “It’s a person. Just standing in the middle of the room, not moving.”


I didn’t want to look. Every instinct screamed at me to turn away, to run, but my feet moved on their own. I stepped forward, pressing my face to the glass, my heart hammering in my chest.


Inside the cabin, bathed in the pale moonlight that filtered through the cracks, stood a figure. It was impossibly tall and unnaturally thin, its head tilted to one side like a broken doll. Its skin—or what I thought was skin—was pale and cracked, as though it had been left to bake in the sun for too long. But the worst part? Its eyes—wide, black, and hollow—stared straight at me, the emptiness within them almost consuming.


“Run,” it whispered.


The word sliced through the air like a blade. I stumbled back, nearly tripping over my own feet. “We need to go,” I choked out. “Now!”


Christy and Jonathan didn’t argue. The three of us bolted, sprinting back through the woods, the flashlight beams bouncing wildly. I could barely see where I was going, branches whipping against my face, but I didn’t care. All I knew was that I had to get away.


Behind us, the whispering started again, louder this time, chasing us through the trees. It wasn’t just one voice; it was many, overlapping and echoing, saying things I couldn’t understand. My lungs burned, my legs ached, but I didn’t stop until the campfire came into view.


We collapsed near the dying embers, gasping for air. None of us spoke for a long time, the only sound was the crackle of the fire. When I finally caught my breath, I turned to Christy. “Did you hear it?” I asked.


She nodded, her face pale. “It said...run.”


Jonathan stared at the ground, his hands trembling. “I don’t think we were supposed to find that cabin.”


I didn't sleep that night. I just laid in my bed, holding my flashlight until the morning sun filled the cabin with its comforting glow.
