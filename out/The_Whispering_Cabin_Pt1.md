I Found My Journal 

Sometimes memories can play tricks on you. Sometimes they are vivid and when you close your eyes you play out every detail in your mind. Sometimes they are fleeting, leaving your mind never to return until a spark reignites the long snuffed ashes. My father died when I was 7. We were driving to my grandmother's house for Thanksgiving dinner and a drunk driver swerved into our lane. I don't remember much besides Breaking Benjamin’s “Diary of Jane” being interrupted by a bright light and a loud crash. At this point in my life, I'm happy my memory failed me.

After the accident I became very depressed, becoming a mute during school and a hermit at home. My mother was a wreck but she mostly kept it together when I was around. She always put my feelings above her own, putting on a strong facade to hide her real feelings. I regret the way I treated her. I would lash out, blaming her for my fathers death. She eventually decided I needed to talk to a therapist. 

The therapist diagnosed me with PTSD and depression. She suggested I needed a way to express my sadness and anger in a controlled way. One day when I showed up to her office, she handed me a large black notebook with my name embossed into the cover. She told me I should start journaling my day and so I did. I journaled every night until the pages were full. When I finished it I just put it away and never looked at it again. Until today.

Today I was speaking to my mother about my childhood when she mentioned summer camp. I told her I had never been to summer camp, but she argued I had gone every summer for 4 years after my father died. Im 25 now and my mother now has dementia so when this interaction happened, I laughed it off. I assumed she was just mis-remembering, but something didn't sit right with me. She was very adamant about it so I decided to finally pull out my old journal. It turns out, I was the one mis-remembering.

Camp Willowcreek

When my mom dropped me off at Camp Willowcreek, I tried to act excited, but deep down, I was terrified. It wasn’t the camp itself. It was beautiful. The lake glittered under the sun, and the cabins looked cozy enough, but something about the woods surrounding the camp felt wrong. The cabins were nestled in a dense forest. Each tree chained together with bramble and bush, creating a makeshift barrier. On one side was the lake, on the other was hundreds of miles of wilderness. Only two paths seemed to exit the camp, the road in and a path that led around the lake. 

On my first day, I met Christy and Jonathan. I had no friends there and it seemed neither did they. Christy was fearless, she could scale a tree faster than a chipmunk on Adderall. Jonathan was the opposite. He was quiet, but when he spoke it was usually with some strange story. His stories were usually ridiculous, tall tales he heard from his brother. Jonathan was a couple years older than Christy and I, but we clicked right away. 

That night we had a bonfire. The air was warm and the trees whistled with a wind that couldnt be felt. The fire cast shadows against the treeline giving the illusion of monsters creeping through the forest. Most of the kids were roasting marshmallows and running carelessly around the fire. The three of us sat on the sidelines, laughing at how dumb everyone was being. That’s when Jonathan brought it up.

"Have you guys heard about the Whispering Cabin?" he asked, his voice low like he didn’t want anyone else to hear.

"No," I said, glancing at Christy. She shook her head, but her eyes lit up with curiosity.

Jonathan leaned in closer. "It’s an old, abandoned cabin deep in the woods. The counselors don’t talk about it, but some of the older kids say a man named Mr. Beans used to live there. They say he went crazy, started whispering to himself all the time, and one day…he just disappeared. Some people think he’s still out there."

"That’s so dumb," Christy said through a chuckle.

"Why is he called Mr. Beans?" I asked, trying to sound braver than I felt.

Jonathan shrugged. "No one knows. Maybe he liked beans, or maybe it’s just a nickname. But they say if you go near the cabin, you can hear him whispering."

A shiver ran down my spine despite the warm air. "You’re making that up."

Jonathan grinned. "Maybe. But we could go check it out, see for ourselves."

Christy’s face lit up. "Let’s do it!"

I hesitated. The idea of sneaking into the woods felt wrong, but I didn’t want to look like a chicken. "Fine," I said. "But if we get caught, don't think i won't snitch on you."

The next night, we snuck out with flashlights and an old map Jonathan had "borrowed" from the camp office. We headed out onto the old trail, following the map as closely as we could.  The woods were darker than I expected, the trees so thick that they blocked out most of the moonlight. The further we went the quieter it got, each cicada and cricket dying out one by one with every step we made. Eventually the only sound that remained was our own footsteps. Every crack of a branch or rustle of leaves nearly made me jump, but Christy and Jonathan pressed on, so I did too.

It felt like we’d been walking forever when we finally saw it: a small, crumbling cabin barely visible through the trees. The windows and doors were boarded up and the roof seemed to be caving in.

"That’s it," Jonathan whispered.

"Looks like it’s going to fall apart," Christy said, but her voice was quieter than usual.

“I think we should go back. What if the counselors noticed we are gone?” I asked. They ignored me and started walking closer to the old dilapidated cabin. 

As we crept closer, I felt the air change. It was colder here, and there was a strange smell, like rotten meat mixed with something metallic.

"Do you hear that?" Christy asked, stopping in her tracks.

At first, I thought she meant the wind, but then I heard it too — a faint whispering, so soft I couldn’t make out the words. It seemed to be coming from the cabin.

"Maybe it’s just the wind," I said, my voice shaking.

"Let’s find out," Christy said, already moving toward the door.

"Wait!" I hissed, but she was already up the stairs of the porch with her ear against the door. Jonathan followed her, and I had no choice but to go after them.

As we got to the door the whispering suddenly stopped. The door was boarded up but underneath you could see weird symbols scratched deep into the grain as if something was trying to get in.
 
"This is so weird," Christy said, shining her flashlight on the strange runes. "What are these symbols?"

"Let’s just go," I said, my stomach twisting in knots.

Jonathan knelt, brushing his fingers over one of the symbols carved into the door. “They look old...like ancient old,” he muttered. His face was lit by the faint beam of his flashlight, shadows distorting his features into something almost unrecognizable.

Christy knocked on the door. “Hello, Mr. Beans? You home?” she joked, her voice dripping with false bravado. The sound echoed unnaturally, louder than it should have been, as if the cabin itself amplified it.

“Stop that!” I hissed, pulling her back by the arm. But the second she moved, something inside the cabin creaked, a slow, deliberate sound like someone stepping across old wood.

The three of us froze, staring at the door. Jonathan’s flashlight wavered, the light bouncing erratically against the wood. “Did you hear that?” he whispered.

“No, it’s just the wind,” Christy said, but her voice faltered. She didn’t believe herself, and neither did I.

Jonathan was the first to move. “I’m going around back,” he announced.

“Are you crazy?” I grabbed at his sleeve, but he shrugged me off. “What if someone’s in there? A hiker or—”

“Or Mr. Beans?” Christy teased, though the humor in her voice was gone.

Jonathan ignored us, edging around the cabin’s side, his flashlight beam cutting through the darkness. Christy and I hesitated, but when he disappeared from view, we had no choice but to follow. The woods felt alive around us now, the trees whispering faintly as though sharing secrets.

Behind the cabin was a small window, one of the only ones not fully boarded up. Jonathan was already there, standing on his tiptoes to peer inside. His flashlight dangled from his hand, the beam swinging uselessly at the ground.

“Do you see anything?” Christy whispered, stepping up beside him.

Jonathan didn’t answer at first. He just kept staring, his breath fogging the glass. Finally, he stepped back, his face pale. “There’s something in there,” he said.

“What do you mean, something?” I asked, dread pooling in my stomach.

“It’s—” he stopped, shaking his head. “I don’t know. It’s just...standing there.”

Christy shoved past him, pressing her own face to the window. Her gasp sent a jolt of panic through me. “Oh my God,” she whispered. “It’s a person. Just standing in the middle of the room, not moving.”

I didn’t want to look, but my feet betrayed me, carrying me forward. I peered through the glass, my heart thundering in my chest.

Inside the cabin, bathed in the faint glow of moonlight filtering through the cracks, was a figure. It was tall and impossibly thin, its head tilted to one side like a broken doll. Its skin—or what I thought was skin—was pale and cracked, as though it had been left out in the sun too long. But the worst part was its eyes: wide and black, like twin voids, staring straight at me.

“Run,” it whispered.

I stumbled back, nearly tripping over my own feet. “We need to go,” I choked out. “Now!”

Christy and Jonathan didn’t argue. The three of us bolted, sprinting back through the woods, the flashlight beams bouncing wildly. I could barely see where I was going, branches whipping against my face, but I didn’t care. All I knew was that I had to get away.

Behind us, the whispering started again, louder this time, chasing us through the trees. It wasn’t just one voice; it was many, overlapping and echoing, saying things I couldn’t understand. My lungs burned, my legs ached, but I didn’t stop until the campfire came into view.

We collapsed near the dying embers, gasping for air. None of us spoke for a long time, the only sound was the crackle of the fire. When I finally caught my breath, I turned to Christy. “Did you hear it?” I asked.

She nodded, her face pale. “It said...run.”

Jonathan stared at the ground, his hands trembling. “I don’t think we were supposed to find that cabin.”

I didn't sleep that night. I just laid in my bed, holding my flashlight until the morning sun filled the cabin with its comforting glow.
