A few days ago I was helping my girlfriend's dad working on his car and got sunburnt, so I passed out quickly that night. Next morning, I wake up at exactly 3 am with a full bladder. I guessed that my bladder woke me up like it had done in the past. My mom is in the next room snoring audibly. Usually, my mother doesn't stop snoring unless she turns on her side.

Feeling like I'm not going to fall asleep again unless I head to the bathroom, I turn on my phones flashlight and I get out of bed. As I attempt to yawn I hear my sister call out my brother's name at my door, wich was impossible since she was fast asleep down the hall,  and my mother without moving stops snoring as my brother's name was uttered.

I stand on alert listening for any noise whatsoever but couldn't hear anything... after a minute, I walked into the hallway and noticed the living room was pitch black even with my flashlight on. Nothing in the house is moving or making a noise... I walk while looking over my shoulder towards the bathroom since I'm spooked by what I heard.

After doing my business, I head back to my room and attempt to sleep again until I hear something being bumped off near my brother's feet. Hastily turning on my flashlight, I expect to see my cat since she usually sleeps at me or my brother's feet, but I saw no evidence of her being in the room at all.

Being too awake, I grabbed my laptop to watch YouTube and calm down when my brother started laughing as if something was tickling him. Of course, it was unsettling in the darkness, so I flashed my light on him seeing nothing, but as soon as the light hit him, he stopped laughing entirely.

Took a look around to see if there is anything out of the ordinary and finished starting up my laptop when my wifi dipped, which never really happens and after a few seconds my phone turned off and on again and the wifi was back to normal. However, I could not shake off the uneasy feeling of being watched and there being an ominous presence in the room.

As soon as it was 4 am the birds outside started chirping again and the feeling dissipated. I can't help but wonder what called my brother's name... I don't think I want to know...The next evening, I was sick, dizzy and had no explanation why. I went to bed early thinking that I'm just exhausted.

I had the weirdest dream of a shadowy figure performing some ritual and my hands turned a full 360 degrees and my palms slammed my hips and ribs. Now I don't dream often but when I do I realise its a dream quickly and usually wake up right after. But this didn't feel like a dream at all...

Woke up at midnight feeling very uneasy, my body felt empty, something was watching me from my door and everything felt wider than it should. My bed felt like a  fabric ocean and my blanket like sea foam. My nose runnig a little I grab the toilet roll on my bedside table and unroll about six squares only to tear one off. Way too tired to care I just wipe my nose and try to sleep again.

However my bladder had second thoughts. I was hesitant due to the feeling of being watched and like there is air between my flesh and skin. After a minute of thinking about it I just went to the bathroom. As I got out of bed everything felt normal again and nothing was watching me...

After doing my business I went back to bed and as soon as my blanket covered me the feeling of being watched and air under my skin came back. Being way too exhausted to care I just tried to fall asleep again. 

A few moments later I feel pressure on my chest and my face being pressed to the side with force. Only able to open my left eye I turned my head to the right to see what ever is on me but my head was forced back to the left. Unable to move anything but my head I make 2 more unsuccessful attempts to see what's happening.

Feeling out of breath and having pain in my chest. I turn my head one last time, turned my head so hard I hurt my neck but now I could see what is seated on my chest, however as soon as I was facing it, it disappeared...

The pressure on my chest vanished and I could open my right eye. I turned on my side still feeling like I was being watched and I looked at my door. I swear I could see the outline of a woman furiously glaring at me...

In a blink she was gone and I started getting a burning feeling in my chest. Looking at my clock I noticed it was 2 am already so I decided to get some sleep in before work. Woke up at 6 with a horrible taste in my mouth, my chest feeling like its on fire and the shape of a woman indented in my fabric...
