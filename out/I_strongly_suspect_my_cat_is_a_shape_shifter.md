We've had him since he was around 5 weeks old
Before that, he lived in the animal shelter that we adopted him from, and before that I'm guessing that he lived on the street with his family (he was infested with fleas and just finishing up treatment when we adopted him). We adopted him (Winky) along with another kitten (Stinky) around the same age on the same day. He was always very food aggressive from day 1. One weird thing about him is, I bathed the other kitten once and his fur was all wet, so of course Stinky looked a bit different. When Winky saw Stinky, he immediately became hostile and aggressive, like he wanted to fight him. Stinky is the sweetest ever, and he had approached Winky like he always does, but Winky didn't seem to recognize him at all. That's weird, but here are the reasons why we think Winky is a shape shifter:

1. He began lying down like a human (body elongated) and sitting perched on the edge of the couch (arm bent and resting on the couch arm, the rest of his body curled up) soon after we adopted him, like he is trying to imitate human behaviors. 
2. The other night, I heard loud noises like the house was falling apart. I heard what I thought were pieces falling off the ceiling, and footsteps creaking the floor in the hallway and on the stairs. I heard it a couple of times and thought it was my cousin, but my cousin was in the kitchen the entire time. I heard meowing. Winky rarely meows, and when he does it is very faint and weak. The meows that I heard were very clear. My cousin also heard the meows clear as day from where he was in the kitchen. I saw Stinky around, but couldn't find Winky anywhere. We looked all over the house, and outside (thinking he had somehow gotten out) we could not find him anywhere. Finally, I thought to open one of the bathroom doors on the second level of the house, and Winky ran out. He had been in the bathroom the entire time. That bathroom is nowhere near the kitchen, so how did my cousin hear him clearly? Stinky was NOT meowing, it definitely wasn't him. Winky somehow was making it sound like the house was falling apart etc while he was stuck in the bathroom, to alert us of his plight. 
3. He seems smarter than a regular cat. 
4. When they were younger, one time Winky was at the window inside while watching Stinky exploring outside (Winky hates going outside, except for at night when he likes to hunt lizards). Stinky was going in an erea where he wasn't supposed and could possibly have gotten lost if he had continued. I remember Winky looking directly at me as I was sitting outside, and meowing and then looking in Stinkys direction. This made me look in Stinkys direction too and notice what he was up to. Winky definitely communicated with me that day.

If Winky is indeed a shapeshifter, what should I do? How do I confirm if he is or isn't one?
