Things only became worse for the both of us; we’re in a hellish tunnel, Brock nearly died at the spot, and now a new terror crashed in without a word. A terror that made my soul scream like never before.

***Entity #532***

***Title: God’s fear Ai Zheng***

***Classified: God***

***Origin: Realm #4(Outside of the AlphaVerse)***

***Species: Reptilian humanoid***

***Weight: 721 Kg***

***Height: 532 cm***

***Unique system: Abominable strength, Regeneration class B, Fear, Godly Acid, Warcry***

As the title said, Ai Zheng is a force to be feared. The compendium doesn’t have many pages for this one, other than it makes Gods go nuts and hysterical, and that it consumes them for a purpose that is impossible to say nor written in human language. Though if only Entity #7123 was honoured to write the compendium instead of the man behind this whole facility. She holds her own compendium, which could contain even more knowledge of every monster in existence; both heaven, hell, The Alphaverse, The multiverse, etc.  

Ai Zheng towers over Brock with a burly melting man with white beard and thunderous eyes, shooting thunder as he flails in panic and pain. Its 6 sharp eyes stared daggers at Brock. Its long bulky tail whipped the skulls off the wall. What caught my attention was the acid seeping out of its pit of fangs, slowly melting the God, whose electric eyes have died.

Ai Zheng turned its eyes on me just as the God stopped wriggling in pain. It delightfully gobbled him up, having enjoyed the golden blood and meat. I take a step back while maintaining eye contact. I can’t leave Brock with this monster, and many times I remind myself that I need him. But how in the hell am I supposed to kill something that doesn’t belong in this world. Or the omniverse. Or even the Alpha verse, which I have no idea as to what that is… I can survive through cuts? Retaliate with a heavier strike? And what?

Brock groans as he struggles to lift himself back up. Ai Zheng snapped its head and snatched him with monstrous speed. It holds him up above its face with both hands gripping around his weakened body. I’m petrified at that moment, but seeing him about to get eaten by this eldritch abomination triggered some sense in the rabbit hole of my subconscious. My heart aches the longer I remain immobile to watch.

As Ai Zheng slowly opens its jaws to chomp down Brock, I lunged into the air like never. He was almost about a millisecond away from getting his upper body bit off if I hadn’t stomped my boots against Ai Zheng’s scaley head. I only made it lean backwards, but thankfully it released him from its grip. My heart was struck by lightning when he crashed to the floor full of puddles of acid. I wanted to get off and get him out of it, but Ai Zheng slung me off its head. I crashed through the wall of skulls into the tunnels. My body landed and rolled across the ground. I felt my body crack and tear as I lay down on the floor, coughing out water.

My eyes rolled down, watching my mutilated body painfully snapping back to good shape. Every snap of my limbs makes me yelp in pain. While in a self-healing process, I managed to get back on my feet, though still feeling like I’ve been hit by a metal bat for a hundred times over. I tried to run back to Brock, but my legs aren’t fully recovered to take more steps.

Before I could react, I instinctively jumped away before a hulking shape shot an inch away from my direction. After a caving crash into the slopes, debris and bricks were floating around in slow motion.

Before I could think of something, Ai Zheng tramps out of the hole, monstrously snapped its head to me and started to attack once again. I didn’t have any weapons but the debris or a piece of brick. What am I supposed to do with that?! Throw?

I instantly ducked just as Ai Zheng made a violet arc an inch above my head with its talons. I jumped back at the second slash, but my legs were sliced off into pieces. My back painfully hit against the ceiling. Just as I fell down, Ai Zheng wasted no time in launching its head to make a blow. I countered it with my own, only to create a bright blast upon the collision. Unfortunate enough, my arm starts to violently crack with a golden glow.

My body was about to shoot upwards, but its tail caught me in an instant and slings me along the tunnel. As I flew, out of the blue, it appeared above, sticking its claws and feet to the ceiling. Under a millisecond, it shot downward with its claws raised menacingly behind. It bashed its head against me to the ground, destroying my entire ribcage as I belched something heavy out of my lungs.

Ai Zheng stamped to the ground, lift its head up before it chomped the sides of my torso with its venomous fangs. Venom starts to engulf my body. The pain is far beyond anything I could ever feel or experience, no words from the human language could ever hope to fathom. Even if I were to tell you what it’s like, you couldn’t imagine the suffering I’m in. I felt the life seeping out of my body as I try to force its teeth out of my torso. My decaying muscles barely made an opening as seconds of my breath leaves me.

Will I be able to survive this and get eaten alive? What will it be like in that demonic cosmic horror of a stomach? I don’t want to know but what’s the point of resisting if I’m about to get swallowed without a choice. Suddenly, the old and ancient memories flashed once again in my eyes under a second. Memories of Iris standing up for me, always there to be my protecter whenever I’m weak. Times when I couldn’t help myself, she always finds me and made sure I don’t cry. But there were times she needed me the most. I tried to do anything to be her shield, yet I’m always the person being shewed away. Looking back, I couldn’t help but clench my heart, reminding me how pathetic I was. The fact that I can’t put up a fight for her makes me furiously clench my teeth.

The heavy weight in my muscles instantly departed. I managed to control my arms just fine. But it’s more than just fine! Because I’m not dying here! Not without seeing Iris again! I want to return Brock the favour! If death stands in my way. I’ll have the scum of my boot be the last thing it’ll ever eat!

I take no thought as I spread apart its teeth from my torso, forcing it to release. I turned and stamp my feet at its gums. Pushing apart its mouth with satiating strength, with one hand I grabbed one of its violet teeth and teared it off. I managed to make it wail in pain, a mixture of deer and whale. I jumped and dropped to the ground on my feet. I checked my whole body to discover the acid has destroyed most of my grey blazer and my torso, exposing something that make me pause for a second. Ai Zheng batted its tail against my abdomen, sending me crashing back to the arena.

I dig the tooth to the ground, avoiding the same mistake as before. Suddenly the tooth in my hand started to mutate into an ancient weapon beyond time and space. The base of its structure started to crumble, unveiling the glorious steel never seen by man, God, nor elder before time.

 ***Claymore/Blind Satiating Bravery***

 Knowing time is not my friend, I clenched the hilt with both my hands while twisting around. As expected, Ai Zheng appeared before me with its radiating claw ready to cut me down. I immediately take a stance I’ve never done before and collided my claymore against its talons. I managed to slice them right off its fingers. It hooked again with its other arm. I tried to counter it, but the weight of my blade was pulling me back, which costs my upper torso to be smacked off the ground. This time though, pain seems to be more of a pushover than being the real pain of getting hit by a truck. It just felt odd.  

Before my body could add another destruction to the arena, its tail instantly wrapped my leg, slams me to the stone grounds and pitched me off to wreck the stairs. Blood trickled down my eyes, yet I don’t flinch. As I stand up, I noticed the claymore became a bit lighter than it usually was.

Ai Zheng stomped its feet, then howled into the sky. Suddenly, the hue of the atmosphere turned to a violent purple. My body instantly grows stiff, as well as pictures of horrific imaginations digging into my consciousness.

Out of instinct, I lift the massive blade over my head, blocking Ai Zheng’s instant smashing blow. It opened the gate of its mouth, exposing the tunnel that led to somewhere way worse than your typical hell. It chomped my upper body whole, its tunnel of teeth coating me with that radioactive venom. The sound of ringing whistled into my ears as I struggle to move my claymore around. At this point I thought I’m going to melt here without a way out, only to bathe in acid.

Suddenly, I remembered something. The idea hit me with a stone brick to the back of my skull. I knew what I needed to do, and it sucks a lot worse.

Without a second thought nor a long-time consideration, I slammed my palms against the upper and lower mouth, teeth piercing through my hands. With my muscles being free once again, I started to push with the motivation streaming through my blood. As the sharp pain continues to burn me both externally and internally, the opening enlarges as the violet light bursts though. Wild imaginations of horrific cosmic horrors beyond comprehension retreated in fear. I lift my boots and stamped them to the razors.

While pushing against the weight of its jaw, Ai Zheng swings its head around on a rampage. With the space being big enough, I sink my weapon under its skull. All I can hear is the ringing of battle cries, chopping off the wails of their enemies as I repeatedly mutilate its brain. The wailings and cries play all over in my brain that the corners of my lips begin to stretch wide.

I grow curious as I stare into the monochromatic tunnel of its throat. I was going to climb into it but its hand pulled me out. It threw me into the air above. With full control of my body and gravity, I managed to land my feet and hands against the ceiling. Glaring down at the rodent, its entire torso begins to glow a radiant black whilst it planted its talons to its head as if tearing itself apart.

I take my chance to leap down to a dive with my claymore whistling battle cries of the brave. With just a single swipe of my blade, the world falls into empty silence. I crashed to the ground, creating waves of cracks in all directions. I rise from the rubble and stared at the callous monster, immobile with its head slowly sliding off its shoulders.

And with that, seeing it turn into stone in unwanted defeat, I exhaled the stressing stiffness from my muscles. My blade sparked into sparks of light, disintegrating into nothing. I paid no mind to that as I trudged back to Brock who is struggling to push himself up. His body has only been briefly recovered, yet the acid had taken a toll on his Jeans. He reached his hand to me, smoke floating from his knuckles. I take his hand and pulled him up. As expected, his weight is compared to that of lifting 3 watermelons (Though I’ve never lifted anything that heavy ever in my life). “Phil! What… What has happened?!”

“Don’t worry about it. I took care of it. What’s important is that you’ve recovered, right?” His face dropped when he saw the decaying corpse, melting into dust. “You… You have done this?”

I raise a brow confusingly. “Well, yeah. I…” My mouth trailed into silence as I stare back at the mound of dust, my mind finally reeled back into reality. I didn’t realize until now that I’m able to kill something that no human could ever have hoped to outrun and kill. Many questions have flooded my thoughts into confusion, considering the fact that I’ve managed to survive this long. That thing from way back had implanted some strange instinct into my brain. But it didn’t feel like I got it from force, rather felt like I have recovered something deep within my... I don’t really know where to begin with. Not to mention that I have suddenly recovered some lost memories that are linked to the purpose of that Claymore. The moments when I tried to be brave yet failed to retaliate.

“This beast cannot be slain by Gods nor any mortal being. Yet you have committed the impossible. Something must have transpired within you.”

“Yeah, I guess I did change… A lot…” Everything became awkwardly silent as I take in the moment. To be honest, my life has been so strange and confusing that I’m not sure if I really know who I am. Lost memories have been reclaimed to my brain, yet I still feel that there’s more of them I have lost. And the fact the priest knew my name, it felt personal as if I knew that man from the very start, even though I don’t have the memory to clue in why. But there is one thing I’m certain about: It’s that He has something to do with Iris.

Despite my victory, I don’t feel the sense of accomplishment nor confidence. In fact, I’m sceptic about my strength matching Brock or Samson or whoever else. If I went all out on someone like them, then I’ll be dead in one shot before I could react, or maybe even worse than just death.

“So, does that mean I can…”

“No… To that ‘man’… People like ‘him’… They are mere ants, burrowing under the surface of man.”

“So, what does that mean for me then?”

“I do not know. I have yet heard of any other humans whom have this much strength other than the ancient immovable race. And your wears… They are undamaged!” Taking an inspection on myself, I found my coat and limbs have looked bizarrely undamaged without a scratch. I toyed around my uniform just for the sake of proving that I’m not hallucinating. I feel the smooth comfortable fabric with my fingers, giving me the sense of relief. Something bright sparked my attention. The corpse of Ai Zheng is nowhere to be seen, other than a shining rectangular object lay waiting for us to take.
