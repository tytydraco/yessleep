It all started a week ago, me and Vicky were sitting in our usual spot. It was a small island, surrounded by a lake, deep enough into the forest, so no one else knew about it. It was mostly rocks, but there were some trees too. The small cave was just big enough to fit both of us, fifteen-year-old girls, in it. We have never stayed there for the night before, but this time Vicky had a huge fight with her parents, so we decided to sleep here. Yes, I was kind of creeped out at first, but nothing could go wrong. Right? I mean, we both knew the woods like the back of our hands, we grew up in it after all.   
  
I guess that Vicky noticed that I wasn’t so sure about it, even after I agreed. She looked at me guilty a few times, but then I was the one, filled with guilt. I knew that if I asked her for something like that, for me, she would do it with no doubt.   
We ate all the snacks that were in her backpack, then prepared the cave for us. I put on my jacket and snuggled up next to her, not only because I was freezing but also because it was the only way I felt safe. My jacket was touching her skin, which didn't seem affected by the cold at all. We were sitting at the entrance of the cave, looking forward into the darkness. I was trying to make out something in the night, but all I could see was the gravel I had buried my feet in.   
  
With every passing second the feeling in my stomach was getting worse. The screaming owl seemed to dig into my ears, the sound imprinted in my mind. That was all I could hear, its cries, getting louder every second. It was like it was coming from everywhere, going right to us.   
  
I was unable to move, my body was freezing. I felt the cold drop of sweat dripping down my forehead. I guess I was overreacting, I knew how dark the nights get around here. But it was not that. I wasn’t fearing the shadows, nor the sounds, but what my imagination was creating. The image was so clear in my mind, that I almost saw it. The tall creature with two legs and arms, just like a person, its whole body, covered with white feathers. Its head was big, with even bigger black eyes on it, the beak took up half its face. The human-owl creature was standing on the other side of the lake, staring at me.   
  
I shuddered and shook my head to rid myself of these thoughts. God, how much I hated my imagination sometimes. I looked at Vicky, only to see her asleep. I didn’t know how she was doing it, always so calm, even after events like the one with her parents.   
As I continued to sit there, my unease grew. The piercing screams of the owl seemed to intensify, echoing through the night. It was as if the sound was beckoning me, drawing me towards it. I couldn't ignore the overwhelming feeling that something was wrong.  
  
The image of the human-owl creature standing across the lake lingered in my mind, but I desperately tried to dismiss it as a figment of my imagination.  
  
With Vicky still sound asleep, I decided to venture outside the cave to investigate. I stepped cautiously onto the rocky terrain, my heart pounding with each step. The sound of the owl's cries echoed through the night, guiding me deeper into the darkness.  
  
A sudden gust of wind blew through the trees, rustling the leaves and causing a chill to run down my spine. As I reached the edge of the lake, the moonlight revealed a peculiar sight. The water's surface rippled with an unnatural energy as if something lurked beneath. Fear coursed through my veins, but curiosity pushed me forward. I couldn't ignore the sense of urgency drawing me closer to the lake's edge.  
  
In a moment of impulsive decision, I reached out and dipped my hand into the water. An icy chill spread through my fingertips, but what I felt beneath the surface was not what I expected. It was a thin layer of feathers, soft and delicate, like those of an owl.   
  
A cold realization washed over me, and my gaze snapped back toward the cave. Vicky was still sleeping, untouched by the strange events unfolding. I rushed back, my mind racing with questions. Was Vicky involved in this?   
  
I shook her awake, panic etched across my face. Vicky's eyes fluttered open, and she smiled at me, seemingly unaware of the chaos surrounding us. "What's wrong?" she asked, her voice filled with innocence.  
I hesitated, unsure of what to believe. "Vicky, do you know anything about the owl... or the feathers in the lake?"  
Her smile faltered for a moment, and she glanced away. "I... I didn't think you would find out."  
"What are you hiding?" I pressed, my voice trembling.  
  
Vicky's gaze met mine, her eyes filled with a mix of guilt and sadness. "This place... the island, the lake, it's not what it seems. It's a gateway, a portal to another realm."  
  
Confusion gripped me as I struggled to comprehend her words. "Another realm? What do you mean?"  
  
Vicky took a deep breath, her voice barely above a whisper. "I made a terrible mistake. I dabbled in forbidden rituals to summon a creature, an owl-like entity that could grant wishes. But the creature is not what it appeared to be. It demanded a sacrifice in return for its power, and now it seeks to claim me."  
My heart raced as the gravity of the situation sank in. "What does it want from us?"  
"It wants me," Vicky replied, her voice laced with resignation. "But I won't let it take me”, Vicky whispered, her voice filled with determination. "I have a plan to appease the creature, to offer it a different sacrifice."  
  
My mind raced, trying to comprehend Vicky's words. The weight of the situation bore down on me, and I knew that our lives hung in the balance. "What sacrifice?" I asked cautiously, fear and suspicion creeping into my voice.  
  
Vicky's eyes met mine, her gaze filled with a mix of guilt and desperation. "It wants someone who shares a deep connection with me, someone close. Someone like... you."  
  
My heart froze at her words. The realization hit me like a bolt of lightning. Vicky was willing to sacrifice me to save herself. The betrayal cut deep, tearing at the fabric of our friendship. How could she consider such an unthinkable act?  
  
"No, Vicky," I protested, my voice trembling. "We can find another way. We can find a way to banish this creature together, without sacrificing anyone."  
Vicky's face contorted with anguish, tears welling up in her eyes. "I'm sorry," she whispered, her voice barely audible. "I can't let it take me. It's the only way to break free from its grasp."  
  
I stumbled backward, my mind a whirlwind of conflicting emotions. Fear, anger, and sadness collided within me. The trust I had placed in Vicky shattered instantly, leaving a deep sense of betrayal.  
  
As Vicky approached, an eerie calmness settled over her. She reached out, her hand trembling, and I realized that she had made up her mind. She believed that sacrificing me would be the only way to save herself.  
  
At that moment, instinct kicked in. Survival surged through my veins, and I turned to flee from the cave. But Vicky, desperate to fulfill the creature's demands, lunged forward, grabbing hold of my arm with an iron grip.  
"No, you can't escape," she hissed, her eyes filled with a haunting emptiness. "You're the sacrifice it craves."  
  
I fought against her grasp, my heart pounding with a mixture of fear and adrenaline. I managed to break free with every ounce of strength, stumbling backward. Vicky's face contorted with anger and frustration as she realized her plan was failing.  
As I backed away, my mind raced for a way to escape this nightmare. The cries of the owl grew louder, resonating through the dark forest, urging the creature closer. In a desperate bid for survival, I turned and started wading through the lake. Then I sprinted towards the trees, pushing through the undergrowth with all my might.  
Behind me, Vicky's voice echoed through the night, filled with a chilling determination. "You can't run forever. They will find you!"  
  
I didn't look back. Fear propelled me forward, deep into the heart of the forest. The branches clawed at my skin, the ground uneven beneath my feet. But I refused to stop, refusing to become a sacrificial offering to the creature that lurked within the darkness.  
  
It’s been a week. I haven’t left my house since then. But I feel them getting closer with every passing night.
