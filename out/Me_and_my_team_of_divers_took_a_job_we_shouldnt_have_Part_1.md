No one was supposed to ever hear the facts of what I'm about to tell you but before I get ahead of myself, let's get the fact that this was supposed to be a simple, quick and very well paid job, out of the way. We were tasked to retrieve a lost deep sea drone for a research institute that had more money than sense. They said it had slipped off the grid in “a region of ecological interest.”

Me and my crew had gained a reputation for being very good at what we do so we were a little shocked to be offered such a easy job for so much money but we chalked it up to they have the money to throw around and would rather hire people they know can get the job done. So that was the first red flag we ignored. The second came before we set out, the institute had us sign non-disclosure agreements so airtight they felt more like shackles than contracts. I’m not allowed to tell you the name of the company or the real names of anyone who went down there with me. I'm really not allowed to tell you all any of this but it's not something I can continue my life knowing while the rest of the world walks around completely unaware of what exactly is going on, on this planet.

So, let me be crystal clear, everything you’re about to read happened, only the names have been changed.

I'll start with the arrival to the Island the institute sent us to, to get started. 

The sun was sinking into the ocean when our boat nosed into the harbor. The place wasn’t much, wooden dock, a weather bleached shack that might have been a customs office once and a scatter of homes built from a patchwork of wood, tin, and drifted wreckage.

Palm trees leaned like old men toward the water. Beyond them, the jungle loomed dark, thick, and strangely quiet.

A few people were there to greet us, though “greet” might be the wrong word. They just stood watching as we tied off. Men with broad shoulders and sun-scoured faces, women with hair braided tight and eyes that never left the horizon. They all looked disappointed to see us to say the least.

A massive man with skin like oiled teakwood and a frayed fishing shirt finally stepped forward. He had the kind of face you’d expect to see carved into a figurehead, stern and weathered, not to mention the tribal tattoos.

“You the divers?” he asked.

“That’s us,” I said, hopping onto the dock and offering a hand.

He ignored my hand. “Name’s Kanoa.” He looked us over for what seemed like too long before finally saying “What you want to find, won't be what you'll truly find.”

Julian gave a small laugh. “That’s cryptic.”

Kanoa didn’t laugh back. He just turned and walked.

We followed him to a low building near the water, a sort of canteen where the smell of fried fish clung to the air. A single bulb swung over mismatched tables. There were only three other people inside. Two older women stringing shells and a boy no older than ten staring openly at us.

Kanoa waved us to a table. “You’ll sleep upstairs tonight. Eat first.”

The boy piped up. “You’re going to the reef, aren’t you?”

Mara smiled at him. “Yeah. We’re looking for a lost research drone.”

The older of the two women hissed softly in her own language.

“Lani” Kanoa said sharply. The woman muttered something and went back to her shells.

Thomas leaned forward, elbows on the table. “You all seem… less than thrilled about this dive.”

The boy spoke again before Kanoa could. “Because they’ll hear you.”

Julian raised an eyebrow. “Who will?”

Kanoa’s hand came down on the boy’s shoulder, not hard, but firm. “Enough.” He turned back to us. “You go to the reef, you go quick. You see shadows, you don’t follow. If you hear…” He paused, and something in his expression faltered. “...music, you put your hands over your ears and you swim away.”

Me and my crew chuckled but nobody else did.

One of the women, Ehuna, finally looked up from her shell-stringing. Her voice was like paper tearing.

“They will look like your mother, your lover, your friend. They will move like the water, and they will be beautiful. That is when you should be most afraid.”

“Alright,” Julian said, glancing at me with a grin. “Definitely encouraging.”

The woman he called Lani crossed herself—or something close to it—and muttered, “When they smile, it is already too late.”

Mara tried to break the tension. “I think I liked it better when people just told shark stories.”

Kanoa leaned closer, eyes locked on mine. “Sharks you can see coming.”

We ate after that—fried fish, rice and a flat bread that tasted faintly of coconut. Every so often, I’d catch one of the locals glancing toward the door, as though expecting someone or something for that matter to walk in.

When we finally stood to leave, Kanoa handed me a small vial. Inside was clumps of salt.

“For the mouth,” he said.

“What?”

“If the song gets inside your head, bite the salt. Hard. It might keep you long enough to swim away.”

“Might?”

He didn’t answer, just nodded.

That night, the four of us laid on thin mattresses in the room above the canteen, the sound of the tide slapping the shore below. I should have been asleep, but I couldn’t shake the ominous feeling I had inside me from the words and reactions of the locals. 

Somewhere out beyond the reef, the water made a sound I’d never heard before. Not quite a wave, not quite wind.

Almost like… a voice.

I told myself it was all in my head and I drifted off to sleep not long after.
