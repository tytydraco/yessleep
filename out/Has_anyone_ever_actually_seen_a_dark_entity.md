It had to have been around 15, maybe 17 years ago. I don’t remember the exact date — just that it was late, and I was laying in bed like I always did, scrolling through thoughts and slowly drifting off.

At some point, I must’ve fallen asleep. But what woke me up didn’t feel normal.

I can’t tell you exactly what it was. I don’t know if it was energy, instinct, or something else entirely — but something pulled me out of sleep. I remember waking up and just feeling… off. Like the air around me had shifted.

I kept my eyes closed at first. It wasn’t fear, more like confusion. I figured maybe I was just uncomfortable, so I shifted in bed and turned to face the wall, hoping I’d fall right back to sleep.

That’s when I felt it.

The moment I turned over, the energy in the room got heavier. Not loud. Not dramatic. Just thick. The air felt like it was pressing in on me, almost buzzing — not physically, but in my chest, in my mind. Like something was right there, just beyond what I could explain.

That’s when I opened my eyes.

What I saw is something I’ll never forget. No matter how much time passes, no matter how many times I try to convince myself it didn’t happen — I remember every detail.

There was something in front of me. A face. Close enough that our noses were almost touching.

It wasn’t a blur. It wasn’t shadowy. I saw every part of it clearly. Its face had this faint, unnatural glow — just enough to outline every sharp feature. Its eyes didn’t blink. Its skin looked too smooth, too still, almost like it wasn’t real. But it was the smile that I remember most — this slow, deliberate grin that felt… wrong. Like it was mocking me. Enjoying the moment.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t scream. I just stared back, frozen, stuck in some space between disbelief and silence.

It didn’t speak. It didn’t move. It just watched me.

I don’t know how long it lasted. Maybe a second. Maybe longer. But I remember blinking, and when I did… it was gone. Just like that. The pressure in the room lifted, and everything felt normal again.

I laid there, staring at the wall, trying to breathe. I wanted to believe it was a dream. That maybe I was half asleep, or that my mind was just playing tricks on me. But deep down, I knew it wasn’t a dream. I was awake. I was present. And whatever that thing was… it was real.

The strange part? I wasn’t terrified. Not the way you’d expect. I was shocked, yeah. But not scared.

I think part of me just believed it couldn’t hurt me. I’ve always believed in God, and in that moment, I leaned on that. I didn’t pray out loud or anything like that — I just knew that whatever it was, it didn’t have control over me.

And maybe that’s why it left.

I’ve never seen it again. Not in the way I did that night. But even now, after all these years, I still think about that moment. How real it felt. How quiet. How close.

Sometimes I wonder if it was waiting to see how I’d react. Or maybe it just wanted to be seen.

Either way… I saw it.
