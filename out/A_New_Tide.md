2013 May 1st:

As the RCMP had their investigation to deal with another familiar evil act was discovered in the Chatham-Kent municipality in Southern Ontario. OPP officer Jimmie Timeland was out on patrol at approximately 12:45am early May 1st, Jimmie was tired this particular night, no sleep and abusing confiscated drugs was his life and that life was empty and filled with the deep seeded thoughts of committing horrendous crimes against others and himself. Around 2:00am during routine officer Timeland came across an alleyway where screams of a woman's pleas were the only sound for blocks, the cries of help caused Timeland to immediately jump into action. As the officer left his squad car he immediately called for back-up and reached for his standard issue pistol, running down the alley suddenly the area was dark, silent and a hair raising chill went down the officers body. The officer then realized no feedback came through after requesting back-up, as the officer continued down the now dark hell that was this alleyway a feeling of unsettling fear took ahold of Timeland mind, paranoia, delusional and familiar feeling of withdrawal...

Officer Jimmie Timeland never came back from that patrol and only the remnant of the officer was the abandoned cop car outside the alley, a new case and search party was formed by OPP to find the now missing officer. When going down the alley what was discovered was not what law enforcement expected. A deceased woman around the age of twenty-one was discovered, this woman was sexually assaulted with a bloody broom found beside the victim's body, along with this the woman seemed to have multiple stab wounds, and was missing her left arm. 

A few days later on the 3rd of May a local news station picked up on the murder as it involves a missing officer and a dead civilian in such a gruesome manner, the autopsy reported on showed that the arm was removed and surgically patched up long before the assault and before death. On May 4th 2013 This news report caught the attention from British Columbian RCMP Lieutenant Rodney Cliff, Cliff contacted OPP officials about the hiker couple case and the relation of the crimes due to the fact of surgery conducted before the deed of murder and the woman they found a day prior.

Timeland was never found to this date and became a permanent missing persons report cold case file, if anyone has any information please contact Crimestoppers or local OPP officials.

1885 March 5th:

A revolutionary time of mining was well underway in British Columbia and new projects were setting up all the time, the Blake family mining facility along the Shuswap had been a driving force in the industry with amassed wealth and recognition within the business. An event took place on March 5th involving a mine shaft collapse, this was a main line and the company was dependent on this factor to their operations. Blake family official Robert Blake decided not to consider life in the situation and ordered an immediate dynamite clearing method that trapped and killed over fifty-six low waged miners. This ultimately ended the facilities operations as the explosions were not enough to fix the issue at hand and the Blake family moved on further north like nothing even happened.

By 1889 the Blake family had established everything they had before, new connections and respected once again. When an investigation was conducted in the early 1900s on what exactly happened back in 1885 the crews found several piles of degraded human bones, they say this released a curse as once uncovered the entire Blake family was systematically killed off by mysterious ways and unsolved murdered. Unfortunately the Blake's were working with several other companies and families at the time and the youngest Edgan Blake survived an encounter with what he described as a shadow cashing him into a Forrest where he was hung but survived long enough to be found and lived a whole life till he died tragically in 1931, the cause of death was death by Edgan jumping off a highrise in Toronto Ontario and commiting a sudden suicide.

Edgan's apartment contained a note stating the following:

"In the end the sway of darkness overtakes me, we should have never decided money over life, my father was nothing but shame to me. I leave this life knowing he was right, he guided and took revenge, I should have died when he hung me all those years ago. My children will never be safe again, we collaborated with bad people, we were not a good family and he should have finished me, I now know I must go and leave this plane of existence.. Stay safe my love, I'm sorry but he was right."
