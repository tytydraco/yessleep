I AM DELETING THE APP. I LIKE YOU. IF YOU LIKE ME, MEET ME AT THIS ADRESS AT 10 PM ON FRIDAY

That is how it started. 

Well, I suppose it started a little bit earlier. I have been trying to get back into dating after breaking things off with my girlfriend a few months ago. 

I had matched with this girl on a dating app- Des. Her picture was stunning- a gorgeous slim blonde that was, admittedly, just my type. 

Me: Hi

Des: ; )

Me: I like your picture

Des: Thank you. I picked it myself. I dont know her name though ; )

Me: LOL! Well, you clearly have good taste ; )

Des: Yes. What do you do?

Me: I am a doctor. What about you?

Des: I am a demon. I cause pain and spread fear. 

Me: LOL

We kept texting intermittently for the next day or so. The conversation was honestly a bit lackluster, but she was cute enought that I was willing to keep it going despite not really being all that engaged. 

After three days she wrote to let me know she was deleting the app, but would like to meet up. She sent a location and a time. 

I was a little freaked out. I half- believed I would get there only to find a gang of burly men with sharp implements. Still... she was \*very\* cute. Call me desperate, but I eventually decided to go to the supplied location.  

It turned out to be a lookout point, accessible by car but quite remote. A lone bench stood by the footpath some hundred feet away from the parking lot. The trees rustled in the autumn wind, and the lights of the city twinkled in the distance. There was no sign of Des, at least not at first. 

"I did not think you would actually come"

Her voice was smooth, almost cooing, yet I sensed a sinister undertone that sent a chill down my spine. It reminded me of a cat purring as it corners an injured mouse. 

"But I am glad you did, yes" she continued. 

I still could not see her, concealed as she was by shadows. I saw only a vague humanoid outline that could easily have been missed if not for the movement. There was something... off about her silhouette, something vaguely unsettling. 

"I enjoyed texting with you a great deal. Still, digital communication can never quite equal the real thing can it? Of hearing each others voices, of seeing each others faces..."

Her voice was almost wistful, yet I could not shake the feeling that there was something almost mocking lurking just beneath the surface. 

"Er..." I began nervously "Well, it is nice to finally meet you. You certainly picked an interesting spot!"

She giggled slightly

"Everything I do is interesting, yes"

She paused for a second before continuing

 "Are you interesting?"

I laughed slightly at her brusque question. 

"Well, I certainly like to think so."

There was a pause, as if she was pondering my words. She seemed to have come slightly closer. It looked as if she was wearing some weird coat, but I still could not make out any specific features.

"Why?"

Her voice was throaty, almost excited. I had not not imagined it before, she was moving slowly but surely towards me. I shivered as I realised what her gait reminded me of- a stalking predator. 

"Well, I came here did I not? Even though you could easily be a serial killer"

I had intended it as a joke, but she did not laugh. Silence filled the air for a almost a minute. Something about the pregnant pause unnerved me. I could feel my heart beating rapidly in my chest, my body going into fight- or- flight mode. 

I almost flinched when she finally broke the silence.

"If you were a serial killer, how would you kill your victims?"

I was slightly puzzled at the odd line of questioning but opted to humor her. 

"Well, I\`d... er... guess I would kill someone every Halloween. I guess I\`d assault someone going home from a party and... er... stab them..."

She suddenly moved perhaps a feet closer. I felt a rush of wind, presumably from the rustlings of her oversized coat. From the outline it appeared to have truly ridiculous shoulderpads. She was only ten feet or so away from me now. 

"Thats... mundane, yes? I like the Halloween angle, but I need... \*more\* from a man, yes!"

I thought I was imagining things at first, but I could have sworn I saw two dots emanating a faint greenish glow, as if a pair of glowing unblinking green eyes were fixed on me. My mouth was as dry as parchment.

"....well, I would not just stab them really. I\`d use syringe containing succinylcholine to paralyze them. Then, I\`d swiftly removed their hypophyseal gland using a transsphenoidal approach. I\`d collect the hypophyseal glands of my victims. And I\`d leave a little riddle for the police..."

I saw the two green dots fall dark for a second as she blinked. I was at this point beyond terrified and hoping that keeping her amused would prevent things from escalating. I wasnt sure what I thought she was going to do, but I was disinclined to find out. She tilted her head. She had a weird hairstyle, making it look almost as if she had horns.  

"Now that \*is\* more interesting, yes. A transsphenoidal approach would be..."

"Removing the gland through the nose. Its in the brain, but can be handily accessed through the nostrils if you know what you\`re doing" 

"Ah, yes- and you \*do\* know what you\`re doing, yes. You are a doctor. And everyone would be able to tell that you have... particular skills. Not a common thug, no. Something special. A \*terror\*"

Her voice was a low purr. I could almost hear her licking her lips.

"This... succinylcholine... would it prevent your victims from feeling pain? From feeling fear?"

My eyes stung as beads of sweat streamed into them from my perspiring forehead.

"No- it just relaxes the muscles. They would be unable to move, but conscious and fully capable of feeling pain..."

The sound she made was almost... indecent. She clearly enjoyed the disturbing thought. 

"Yesss! Yes! That \*is\* interesting"

She paused for a moment before raising a hand.

"You will need to come up with good riddles. They must be works of art, yes? Fitting pigments for your canvas..."

She unfolded her wings. I had thought them exaggerated shoulderpads, but as they unfurled it was obvious she was endowed with a pair of batlike wings. The glowing green eyes seemed to spark with excitement. Something I suspect was a tail coiled behind her. 

"It is Halloween soon. I will see you then, my \*interesting\* man. Second date, yes? I wish to admire your work. Impress me, yes? Earn my affections, yes? "

I almost fell backwards as she took flight, my muscles just barely resisting the air pressure. 

When she was gone I went back to my car. As soon as I entered it I started shaking and crying uncontrollably. I started driving until I was back in the city. I am parked outside of the bus station now, comforted by the taxis and drivers parked nearby. I dont want to be alone right now. I am sitting in my car as I write this. 

I dont know what to do. Des is not human. 

Does she expect me to... \*do\* something? And what if I dont?
