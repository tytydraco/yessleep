I’ve come here to empty my chest. The weight is encumbering and the questions are too much. As one man I struggle with this on my psychi, and it makes me wonder how the town has done it for so many years. A day further without letting this cascade of information out, and I might do something I’ll regret later. Slowly I’ll let my tale unfold, bit by painful bit. I know reddit might not be the place to go, but it isn’t about who reads it or knows anymore. I’ll sleep better at night knowing that what I’ve survived is huanting somebody else too. Not physically, but I need someone’s mind to be ill like mine. That might sound evil, yet I still hope you’ll give me a chance and hear me out. But enough of that, it isn’t what you’re here for. You read the tag line, and I’m sure you’re more than interested in my suffering rather than my not so happily ever after. 

Anyone who has ever grown up in the south, especially a smaller forested town, knows the woods can make alot of noise. It isn’t as silent and peaceful as those feel good movies like to have you think. Things go bump in the night, and branches claw at each other outside. Theres so little light pollution you would be lucky to see a foot and a half in front of you by moonlight. The nocturnal birds hoot during the restful dark, and preppy song like tweets are heard all day. I wouldnt call myself a city dweller or enjoyer by any means, in fact I detest their stale air. Still, I’m sure theres comfort in knowing whats outside your door. 

Living in the woods, theres no telling. 

My mother was a kind woman, a hard working one. As much as I talk about the south like a true “southern”, at the end of the day I’ve never laid hands on a farmtool, let alone set foot on an actual farm asides from visiting. This was all thanks to her hard work, and the money my so called father paid monthly. 

My hardworking single mother, my “darling” sister, and me, the only man which I use loosely. We’re the only ones living in our small house.  We may have lived in a low income area, but my mother would be damned before the house looked it. Although this story starts when I was real young, she had already found a way to put me to work. I was on button pressing duty, and I found it a high honour. The dishwasher is loaded? Click. You filled up the washing machine? No problem, Henry was here to save the day. Click! Wet clothes stuffed into the dryer? Clicked, set, and dry.  My job was so simple, yet I fulfilled it with much enthusiasm. My older sister on the other hand, I can’t give her the same praise.

There was a huge gap in age between us. I was barely starting second grade, in fact I was due for it soon, and she was a sophomore in highschool going on a junior this upcoming year.  You could say there was a bit of what I like to call, generational disconnect. Not that we were born in compleely different times, or even century. The differences mainly laid in our interests, and friend groups.  She was busy calling people on her concrete block of a phone, and I was busy seeing how long I could build a hotwheels track. Your answer by the way was ten feet, pretty good for a 8 year old in my opinion.

 I would struggle to sleep because of her bitter, hormone riddled self. If she felt I was a little to carefree lately, she’d utterly ruin it. All she had to do was bring up the noises from the woods. 

“Nu-uh, mama says that its the cougars and coyotes.” I tremble and the tiny blanket I was holding was clutched in a new, less ginger grasp. My knuckles turning white from my grip. Here Sadie was, tormenting me, like normal.

“Thats just what they tell stupid little boys like you. In reality if you really knew what was out there, you’d never sleep again.” She waves her hands in front of my face. My over active imagination turning her press ons into claws, and her curly hair into a terrifiying beasts mane. I squeak and pull the blanket up tighter, covering the bottom half of my face. “Be honest, do you think a cougar can scream that loud? Do you think the animal would sound so….desperate?” Her tone held a teasing michevous edge, designed to scare me further. Whispering desperate, and making me hang onto her airy words. She wasn’t truly asking, she was stating it like a hard fact.

I turn my head away and squirm, pulling the blanket over my head entirely. “Mama showed me a video of a cougar screaming, you aren’t going to fool me.” My lip quivers and I recollect myself, putting on a childs mockery of a poker face. Pulling the blanket down and off my head. I gather all my courage just to fray one of her nerves. “You’re just mad because I heard you talking to Jessica, I bet she got that date with Dereck and you didn’t” I stick my tongue out at her, but my bravado fades quickly when I see the corners of her lips twitch downward. The second I see her eyes darken, I run. Abandoning my safety blanket on the couch. 

“Get back here you little shit, and say that again.” She shouts, stomping after me. She doesn’t even have the decency to run. She merely takes huge strides, using her long legs as an advantage against my little bitty developing nubs, still I was nimble. Sadly, like a bad slasher flim I trip on the dining table in the kitchen, getting knocked down by the corner of one of its four legs. I try to army crawl away, or at least imitating so. She grabs me by the scruff of my collar, and easily holds me up. My struggle was futile. “How about you worry about yourself first. It likes those with imagination. And if you’re imagining Dereck with Jessica, the creature would obliviously want a creative soul like you. “ She spits the words like venom into my ear and surprisingly setting me down. Snarling her nose up at me,  as I turn around to look up at her. 

“I don’t believe in monsters anymore, I’m a big boy!” I shout back at her, trying to channel my fear into anger. I found it extremely difficult, being a big scaredy cat afterall. “And get over him already. If he didn’t want you in middle school, he doesn’t want you now. How about you date someone useful and not go for the first guy with a guitar. I bet you were the kind of kid to froth over Troy in highschool musical. Unlike you, I’m maturing.” I toss my head to the side sassyily, crossing my arms over my chest, and tapping my foot. A weak imitation of mom. 

I was waiting for a retort, or even a not so well worded insult, but I get neither. “Whatever you wanna say, mama’s boy. If you get eaten at night, or you think theres a monster in your closest, you’re waking up mom and not me. Got it.” She waves me off and wanders back to her room. Pulling out a nonreusable ziplock baggy mother had given her to keep her nokia in. Not that the sucker would suffer if it was to be tossed lazily into her drawer. “And don’t you think for a second I’m walking you to the basement like normal. If you’re such a big boy, go finish up the laundry yourself.” She shouts, laying back against her bed. Her tone condescending. Not even sparing me a glance through her open door. 

“B-but I’m not tall enough to put the clothes in-” before I can finish she cuts me off.

“You have a stepping stool.” She says bluntly, watching my reaction now closely. “What, scared of its proximity to the woods? Is it the little window that gazes directly in the forest’s void? Is it the cougars? Or…the lurking beast? Of course not right, cause you’re a big boy afterall.” She smirks and adverts her attention back to her nokia, covered in an array of stickers. Already dailing somebody up. Most likely Jessica, her friend and somehow enemy. 

I always hated when she got like this, but now I miss it.

I shift nervously, just watching my sister for a bit. Shuffling from side to side obnoxiously, hoping to call her bluff by lingering. Hoping that if I overstayed my welcome, she’d make the trip with me anyway. It was the quickest way I was going to leave. I clear my throat and watch her head snap in my direction with an “ugh” before getting up and slamming the door in my face. My short hair managing to sway from the harsh breeze of her force. 

“Fine, doody head.” and with this, I stomp off. Opening the door to the basement, and descending halfway down bravely. Though once I reach third from the bottom step I pause. Staring at the dark abyss in front of me, a single window being the only source of light. A surprising amount of light is shooting a bolt into the basement, despite the setting sun.  Even the bulb that illuminated the stairs wasn’t enough to eat away at the hungry dark. I didn’t like the view of the woods, the only good thing coming out of it was moms soon to be ended shift.

I feel all the hairs rise on the back of my neck, the floorboards almost trembling beneath me. Though in all honesty, it could’ve been my knees. A unerving sound can be heard outside. Rustlings leaves, paired with snapping branches, and what sounded like a gurgle. Like somebody was trying to talk while a loogie was caught in their throat. It wasn’t like any animal Ive ever heard. It didn’t yip like a yote, it didn’t screech like a cougar. It sounded like a malformed combination of the two. An unholy combination between two preddators that shouldn’t exist. Every snapping twig reverbrating like something heavy was stepping across them. Even at such a young age, I knew it sounded too big to be a cougar.

I gulp and press further, taking a singular step down. The hairs now rising on my arms. Eyes going wide when the board underneath my foot creaks. I hear the rustling outside stop. An eerie silence befalls the room.  Even if whatever it was didn’t discover me from the noise, I wouldn’t take the chance. Darting up the stairs faster than I ever have before. The air felt thick, and each pasing second where I lingered next to the basement made it worse. At the time I chalked it up to my fear, but I realize years later what I was feeling was danger. The thick film is something that cannot be forgotten, something that demands caution. A singular but powerful dose of peril, 

I dashed upstairs immedaitely to my sisters door, pounding it with my tiny fists. Not even bothering to check if its locked, already assuming it is. I start to cry out of pure distress, the feeling refusing to leave my body’s system. I want company. I NEED company. I need to not be alone. I need my sister…no even worse I felt the urge to revert to old nicknames, wanting my sissy. “Please, sissy, please…” I give into the urge, hoping that embrassing myself in such would prove its urgency. “Im scared- I’m so scared-”

The door bursts open. My sister dropping down to my height, placing tentative hands onto my shoulders. Spinning me around a few times, and looking me up and down. Seemingly checking for any injuries or something out of place. The only noticeable injury, was to my mind. Snot bubbling down my nose, and big round tears falling from my eyes. Finally she sighs. “Do not scare me like that! If anything happened to you mom would never forgive me, and neither would I. You got that!?” She stares intensely into my eyes. Showing rare vulnerability, even if it comes out aggressive. Her behavior bitchy, but soothing nonetheless. I slowly but surely nod, sniffling. “Now, whats wrong?” she relents and asks, releasing her grip on my shoulders. The skin she had grabbed at pulsing, in my state of fear I didn’t realize her grasp was near bruising. 

“T-the monster…its real. Its real. I’m so sorry,” I hiccup and rub my puffy eyes. Not noticing the terrified look on her face, one that matched mine. She looked past the point of crying, like she was so scared she couldn’t. It only lasts for a second but I catch it. Though it does me little good because I’m unable to decipher why. I don’t question it. I instead pay much more attention to her softening features, and the sympathy in her eyes. “I didn’t say you were a liar but I kinda said it by saying you were wrong.” I say between heaving breaths.

“Oh Henry…” She shakes her head, and ruffles my hair. “I was just playing with you silly.” If I was smarter, I would’ve noticed her tone was devoid of humor. I stare at her dumbfounded. 

“No, It was outside the basement, in the woods, I heard it-” 

“No you didn’t, Henry. No. You. Did. Not.” she shudders and comes back to a stand. Her tone firm like a mother scolding her child, but really she was my sister. She brushed her hair out of her eyes, tucking her black and blonde raccoon tail behind her ear. It surprisingly looks uniform among her dark strands of hair. “Mama didn’t lie to you. It’s just the cougars, and the coyotes. Sometimes they’ll bark and scream at the same time yknow.” 

I knit my brows, because I didn’t tell her what it sounded like. Still, she was my older sister and she knew better than me 70% of the time. Plus, you only had to know the local wildlife to make an educated guess. Once again, like the typically good child I was, I simpy agree. Nodding my head up and down solemenly. Deciding I’ll believe her unless proven otherwise. “Whatever you say” I pause, letting the moment linger for a second too long. “…hey sissy?” my tone gets low and mumbled. She lets out a little hum, letting me know she heard me and urging me to continue. “Can I get a hug?” I ask, tone just as soft. Tears slowing as I gaslight myself in believing her. 

“Of course. ‘Mere little Hen.” I hated that nickname too, still I was happy to hear it. Degrading or not, it was the sound of childhood. A moment of solace. I raise my arms up and sigh content when she leans down into my hold. Giving me a good old bear hug. “Just ignore the sounds in the woods. Don’t let my little fables get you down, cause that is all they are. Fables. We are supersitious, but don’t let it go past that. Don’t tests myths, dont push the limits, but don’t give them power. Always remember that, little Hen.” her accent gets to a playful thickness. Faked and unnatural, especially since she typically avoided her twang on purpose. She was either telling the truth or lying for my comfort, and I prayed it was the former. Still I smile up at her as she pulls out of the hug to turn back into her room. Leaving the door open behind her. A level of security I assume she leaves for me.

Even with all this comfort, the second she isn’t in my direct vicinity the gnawing doubts come back. I stand just a foot away from her doorway, feeling the need for my blanket. There was too many plot holes, too many possibilities. My young mind runs rampant, but it doesn’t touch the real horrors outside. It wasn’t a cougar. It wasn’t coyote. It wasn’t one hell of a coincidence either. There was nothing natural about it…or at least by a human’s definition. 

*What is in the woods?*
