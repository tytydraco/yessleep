"Why are you so scared of ferries Kim?"

I heard her, but continued staring at the water beneath the gangway. I sighed, I didn't want to deal with another conversation about this.

"I'm not afraid of ferries, I'm just not overly fond of the sea. If we were just taking a ferry across a lake or something I'm sure it would be fine."

Janet laughed, "Like hell you'd be fine, the last time we took a water taxi in Seattle you looked like you were going to vomit"

I gave up on my staring contest with the ocean and turned to face her. "That was different bec-"

"Whatever - just don't ruin this for me by demanding I stay in the cabin with you okay? I didn't even know you could book a cabin without a window."

I shrugged, "Fine".

If Janet wanted to stand on the deck and risk falling overboard if there were rough seas then I figured it would be her funeral not mine. It was going to be a two and a half hour trip, and I planned to spend it somewhere safe with zero risk of falling overboard, a window breaking, or any other dangerous nonsense.

Once we boarded, I had to wait for a steward to take me to my cabin. I nearly fainted as I felt the shudder of the ship moving, and saw the coastline receding slowly. Janet stood with me and held my hand as I fought back my terror. I had booked the cabin not just for my benefit, but also because I wanted her to be able to enjoy the trip without worrying about me panicing. Finally a man in a uniform arrived, and Janet and I said our goodbyes. We went to the elevator, and I was relieved as the doors shut the ocean away from my view.

The man smiled at me as the elevator went down. "Let's see, says here you're - oh, 113. We don't have many cabin bookings on such a short voyage - let alone interior ones."

"Well, I just get sea sick," I lied, "and figured it would save everyone effort if I was away from any windows."

He stared at me for a moment then just smiled and nodded. The doors opened out onto a rather cramped hallway. I could see why so few people booked cabins.

We walked down what seemed like a few mazelike hallways until finally he stopped at a room with no label, and opened the door for me. The cabin was quite spartan - two berths, a tiny desk with a water bottle on it, and a small closet with what had to be the smallest toilet ever invented. It didn't look particularly clean, and there was a faint smell of mildew, which I wasn't wild about, but it didn't have a window. I sat on the bottom berth and sighed with some relief.

The man cleared his throat, "If everything is in order, I'll leave you to it, I just wanted to let you know it's okay to take a nap if you'd like - I'll come get you at the conclusion of the voyage, okay?"

I nodded and smiled at him, "Thanks so much, you've been so kind."

He winked at me "My pleasure."

With that, I was finally left alone. I drained the water bottle, laid down, and began to read my book. I didn't realize how tired I was though, and after only a few pages, I was fast asleep.

When I woke up, I checked my phone, and realized it twenty minutes after when we should have arrived. I went to open my cabin door only to find it had been locked. I breathed deeply, trying to avoid panicing, and tried again. Nothing. I took my cellphone out, hoping to call Janet, only to find not only was their no cell signal, but no wi-fi either. I paced, banged on the door, screamed, but no one came to help me. Had I just been forgotten?

I took a few minutes to breath and focus. I looked at the door more closely, and realized the hinges were on the inside. Shaking my head at not noticing sooner, I dug into my bag, praying that I had kept my multitool inside. I felt a rush of adrenaline when I located it, and I started working on the rust covered hinges.

After a few minutes I finally managed to pry off enough rust that I could pry the pins loose. When the last one gave, I heard the door make a metallic lurching noise as it came loose. It took all my strength, but I managed to slowly walk the door back and get it leaning against the berths. I felt so much relief, and started to walk towards the hallway, only to notice something on the door.

A note.

I wanted to get the hell out of there to tell the crew that I was still here and not to leave, but something in the back of my mind made me go back and grab it. I paused to read it, and my blood went cold.

The note was short - it had my name, age, and said "Subject 113".

I heard footsteps down the hallway. I went outside, and ran away from the footsteps as quickly as I could. After a minute or two, I heard shouting, followed by more footsteps. I kept running, and eventually found a staircase, and took it up what felt like ten decks, to eventually find myself back in the atrium area I had last seen Janet in. The ship was already mostly empty, but a few people were still disembarking. I got in the middle of a group, and got off.

Obviously, Janet and I went to the police. It turned out the man who had taken me to my 'cabin' was not part of the crew at all. The crew told me there was no "Cabin 113" and that all their cabins were on a deck much higher up than where I had been.

The police told me they think it was just some weird guy pranking me, but one of the women officers confided in me that the city has had a bunch of disappearances of women who took the ferry. I'm worried the ferry company and the city are covering this up - without saying where this is, let's just say it is a very heavily trafficked ferry that tourists use.

Janet and I have decided to cut our trip short - in addition to all of this, I'm also just feeling sick the last few days. She keeps telling me that I was very lucky - that they were likely trying to kidnap me - but given that they called me "Subject" I wonder if it wasn't something even worse waiting for me at the end of the voyage.

I used to be afraid of the ocean, but now I know that the people around us are far more [terrifying](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByAbraxas/).
