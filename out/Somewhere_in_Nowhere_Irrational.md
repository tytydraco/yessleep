[I’m](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h1douv/somewhere_in_nowhere_pigman/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) sure y’all want me to get to the action, and I will. But first, I have to explain something. I have an irrational fear of teleportation. And before you ask, no, I don’t piss myself when I watch science fiction movies. It goes deeper than that. 

I’m afraid of spontaneous displacement. It’s one of those phobias that you’re 99.99% sure will never happen, but it still stays tucked in the back of your brain. I’m afraid I’ll go to sleep, close my eyes, or even blink and end up somewhere I’m not supposed to be, like in the middle of a dark forest at three in the morning. Or all alone on the top of Mount Everest. Or maybe even an abandoned research bunker in Alaska, plagued by the evils of the SpongeBob SquarePants pilot episode. 

You can run from a monster, and you can hide from a killer. You can get out of the water or wake up from a nightmare. But what do you do when everything around you is suddenly wrong? What do you do when one minute you’re cozy in your bed after a hard day’s work, and the next you’re standing, very awake, in the middle of a circle of mannequins in a decommissioned military base?

All this to tell you that the Rot didn’t exactly have it right where it wanted me, but it could put me right where it wanted me. So it did. 

I only broke eye contact with it long enough to blink. My eyes opened, and my worst nightmare was realized. I was somewhere else— and nowhere good.

The darkness out in the desolate stretches of woods and farmland is something you never really get used to. It’s like burnt pitch: deep black and thick enough to drown in. When you’re out lost in it, it’s the kind of thing that makes you pray for the sun to rise at three in the morning. 

I was standing on an empty, unfamiliar dirt road. It ran far past what I could see in both directions, and there wasn’t so much as a tire track. I’d walked through the dark a thousand times before back on the farm, and I like to consider myself a brave person, but like I said... this was different.

The fear was so potent that I could feel it pulsing in my chest. My mouth was dry as a bone, and my legs were locked in place. No direction was a good one— there was no escape. The sky through the trees was black and moonless, and the forest around me was dead silent, without even so much as a single chirp of a cricket.

I closed my eyes tight and tried to slow my breathing. A light rain began to fall, somehow only making me feel more gross. It rolled down my skin in swollen droplets, along with beads of sweat and maybe a tear or two. Despite the rain, the air was stale, like the inside of a flooded crypt. 

I’d just brought myself away from the precipice of a cardiac event and panic attack super combo when the quiet night wasn’t so quiet anymore. 

The sound was faint at first. But the uneven hoofbeats moving closer dropped my stomach like an astronaut roller coaster. They approached me slowly until they didn’t. My legs finally unfroze as I turned and saw the Rot galloping toward me with its diseased gait. Small pebbles and gravel stabbed into my bare feet, but I didn’t care. This road had to lead somewhere, and wherever it was, maybe I could lose this asshole. 

I ran and ran, but was only met with more woods and more road. I wasn’t getting anywhere, and the Rot had gained on me. I could feel its sickly huffs of breath against my back as the rain began to strengthen. 

Then, a voice. It sounded dry and dead, like it had traveled across a graveyard to my ear. 

*Yooooouuuu are a foooooool*

It caught me off guard, enough that I missed a pothole and went careening into the mud. If the ground loves me so much, why doesn’t it just marry me already? 

I flipped over onto my back as the Rot approached, its jaw hanging like it would fall any second. Black bile ran out of the hole in its skull where its nose would’ve been. Its one good eye traded the milk of blindness for the bloodshot of anger. 

Flies buzzed around my head and tried to find a home in my nose, and I dug them out along with globs of red mud. It didn’t save me from the smell though, thicker than glue poured straight into my sinuses. Like a cornered animal, I bared my teeth in rage. *The absolute nerve of this guy!* *Nose holes are sacred!*

“And you smell like Oscar the Grouch’s jockstrap! Taste my foot, you fuckmuffin!”

I delivered a hard kick to the bottom of its jaw, which sailed high and off into the thick brush beside the road with a satisfying *crack*. 

“Pop fly, motherfucker!”

As I sprung to my feet, it charged at me, screaming with half a mouth as its pale, fat tongue thrashed against its neck. Sharp pain radiated up from my ankle as I sprinted away; a creature of decay had no business with a jawbone that tough. 

At some point during my run, I blinked, and was somewhere else again. I couldn’t tell if I’d done something wrong at some point or was just doomed to the necessary function of my face circles.

I was jerked to a stop by knee-deep water, almost falling face-first. If I had known where I would’ve ended up next, I’d have taken the dirt road again five times over. My feet sunk into the black silt of a midnight bayou, and the air filled with sound, almost like someone had pressed play on a remote. The cacophony of wildlife didn’t make me feel any better, though. The loudest noise was the territorial bellow of alligators. I’d lived near a bayou all my life, but this place felt vastly unfamiliar. 

Mother Nature is perfectly capable of creating her own dangers without the aid of supernatural entities who want to see the flesh fester off your bones. I rocketed straight past being frozen in fear and went immediately to fight or flight. I started in the direction of what I could only hope was land, muttering “please, please, please” under my breath. Not like the hungry mouth of a reptile would listen to anything I had to say. 

I only made it a few steps before the ground dropped from under me, bringing the water level to chest height. I saw spots as panic settled in. I know that most people say that’s the worst thing to do in a situation like this, but it was my quickly-shortening life, and I was going to panic as much as I pleased. 

Suddenly, the sounds around me all died, leaving only the voice again. 

*Youuuu doooouuubt my poooooower*

In the distance, I heard approaching splashes. Some black behemoth was steadily making its way toward me through the dark waters. Acting quickly, I sucked in a deep breath and sunk to just below my eyes. *When in Rome, I guess.*

The beast’s steps sounded entirely different beneath the water as it drew closer. Muffled mini-explosions echoed through the swamp to my waterlogged ears. When it reached me, all went truly silent. 

It stood high above the cypress trees, with a head the size of a school bus. It turned its snout down to stare at me, its one good eye glowing white-hot, like a scorching desert sun. The mangled jawbone sat low on its neck, as if it had put it back on like an ill-fitting necklace.  

*Yoooooouuuu challenge me to my faaaaaace, little wooooorm of maaaaaaaan*

It stayed there, staring at me, hooves as big as transfer truck tires unmoving in the muck. My lungs burned for air as my vision blurred. Hadn’t anyone ever told it to pick on someone its own size? 

The need for air and the will to survive eventually outweighed my fear, and I surfaced with a gasp, just far enough to suck in much-needed air. Instead of snapping me up like I’d expected, the Rot only laughed and stomped further into the bayou and, eventually, out of sight. 

Silence fell again, but not for long. It was quickly replaced by the bubbling uprush of water as innumerable corpses rose from the depths. Fowl… fish… lizards and snakes… beavers and squirrels... deer... a black bear or two… even people. Everything that had lived in or around it had been reduced to macabre pool floaties, riddled with decomposition. 

The water churned just in front of me as something large and scaled appeared as the final rotten guest to this swampy pool party. It was the largest alligator I’d ever seen, faded from green to ashen gray. It was caked in algae and other hitchhiking plants, with open wounds crusted in yellow and red. Bile rose in my throat as I noticed how distended its belly had become. Rigor mortis makes balloons out of us all. 

I tried to take a step back, but I felt the water somehow dropping down even further in the direction I’d come from. A massive cottonmouth slid out of the gator’s empty eye socket. As it slithered down its grimy snout, I noticed the single eye, glowing like tiny Wormwood in the snake’s face. Its mouth cracked open, and instead of fangs, all I saw was blackness.

*I will haaaaave whaaaaaat I waaaaaant*

I was sick of these party tricks. I picked the bastard up by the neck and flung it as far into the distance as possible. As if punishing me, I felt razor teeth sink into my leg below the water. I screamed and shut my eyes tight in agony. When I opened them again, I was somewhere else.

I stood on my feet for all of about two seconds before crumpling to the dusty floor of the house I’d been put in. Blood gurgled out of the absolute mess that was once my leg. I could make out the outline of serrated teeth along the edge of the wound. As I stumbled toward the wall, I almost laughed when I remembered my dad had sworn he’d seen a bull shark in Hoghollow Bayou the day before I was born. 

The only light was from a dim lantern on the wall, left on during the night to make trips to the bathroom easier. Something tall and rusted leaned against the other wall, and I hobbled over. It was a calf hammer, coming up to my shoulder with an abnormally large hammerhead. I rested my arm on it and shifted my weight, using it like a crutch. Surprisingly, it held. 

I knew that *thing* lurked in the darkness, just beyond my field of vision. I knew that by going downstairs, I was probably doing exactly what it wanted. But I was past the point of logic. My mind was playing only the Greatest Hits: “Leave,” “Get out now,” “Run,” and not much else. So I crutched over to the creaky landing and began to make my way down. 

I only made it about halfway before my injured foot came down wrong and sent me tumbling to the bottom of the stairs. I landed feet first with a sharp CRACK that put my mangled ankle out of commission for good. Bone peeked through the bloody skin, and I just lay there for a second as the popcorn ceiling spun around me. 

Not far out of my field of vision, I could hear the impatient stamp of a hoof, like my torture tour guide was telling me to hurry up! Well, whatever it had planned for me next, it could wait two-cotton-picking fucking seconds. I stayed there until I mostly didn’t feel like I was going to puke up my lungs, then I took the hammer and struggled to my foot. 

I was standing in a kitchen that looked suspiciously similar to mine. That wasn’t really what caught my attention, though. 

Laying more off the table than on, testing the strength it was clearly lacking, was an enormous horse. It didn’t take long to recognize Hephaestus. He looked a bit younger, back when he still could’ve gotten a job for Budweiser. Three figures sat around him at the table, lips and teeth stained with blood. They were *eating* him. Large chunks of flesh were torn from his hide, leaking dark red all over the floor. 

“Hephaestus,” I said weakly, “what have they done to you?!”

His head hung off the side closest to me, and as if in response to my question, he lifted it and blinked his eyes up at me. He was **still alive**. 

Half-digested apple pie joined the congealing blood all over the floor. The figures at the table, nothing but festering corpses now, looked up at me as if I was the rude one here for puking while they chowed down on one of my only friends.

“Join us, Portia,” croaked the woman. My skin crawled, both at the tone of her voice and the use of my old name. 

“I’d rather sit on the Devil’s lap on a Sunday morning!”

The largest corpse grinned at me, complete with the rattling grind of dry, dead teeth. 

“You look starved, little hen. Always looking starved. Come put some meat on your bones.”

I took a step back, and it felt like the entire room got so much smaller. All I could do was hope there was a door behind me as I inched away and that this didn’t become that one joke about three zombies, a queer, and a half-eaten horse all stuffed inside a closet. 

The third figure opened his mouth to speak, but god, I couldn’t. I just couldn’t. I pressed my hands over my ears for all the good it would do, and screamed louder than I ever had. 

Then I turned and ran, throwing myself into the door to the outside. I don’t know how I was moving on my destroyed leg, but adrenaline really is one hell of a chemical. The outside was nothing but cornfield, shrouded by low-hanging forest. Seeing corn in the middle of deep woods was an eerie sight. It didn’t belong there. I didn’t belong here. 

I fled in no particular direction, searching desperately for an opening that just wasn’t there. The further I went, the more rotten the crops became. By the time I came to a break in the rows, my surroundings were little more than dried-out, weevil-infested husks. 

I walked into the middle of the round clearing, wheezing loudly as my lungs tried to catch up with all the running for my life I had been doing lately. Strange patterns were scratched into the hard-packed earth beneath my feet, and if this was a genuine crop circle, I would’ve happily taken an abduction over this nightmare. Probing included. 

*Yoooooouuuur paaaaathetic rebelliooooon does noooooot phase meeeee* 

Like a shitty sequel that nobody asked for, the Rot crawled out of the corn. It moved low to the ground like a centipede, its joints making a horrible symphony of snaps and pops. Broken hooves cracked against dry dirt as it raced toward me. I felt something solid in my hands where it wasn’t before.

*Youuuuu and your little friiiiiiieeend are piiiiiiigs to the coooooosmic slaaaaaughter*

*Your bloooooood will fester in forgoooootten cracks until noooooothing is left of yoooooouuuu, noooooot even a memooooooory*

I took a step back, but I wasn’t running away. Maybe that was the smart thing to do, but anger gets along much better with stupid. My fingers felt over the butt of my gun, a trusted ally. The Rot must’ve sensed my next move because it charged at me much faster than it had been, lashing out like a cobra. I leaped into the air, narrowly avoiding the attack, but came down too soon. I felt the crunch of brittle spine under my feet as the Rot let out a bellow of agony. I almost felt a little bad, except for the fact that I actually didn’t at all.

“You wanna talk about pigs?! Welcome to the pen, asshole! Get chewed on!”

I whirled around and brought the gunstock down squarely on top of the bastard’s skull, making a sound like a frozen watermelon being thrown off a roof. I didn’t stop, though. I kept raising it and bringing it down until I saw the pale whites and grays of a brain long since used.  One more time for good measure, and I closed my eyes with the force of it. As the butt of my gun shattered, I was standing in my own cornfield. 

My leg was sore but not broken or mangled like I’d expected. I looked down at the gun in my hand. I had hoped the stock would be in pieces, and I would feel this overwhelming sense of peace and victory. But no, it was intact, save for a crack down the middle where splotches of black growth were beginning to invade. Even after I’d bashed its brains in, it was still out there, and it wanted me to know it. 

“NEWPORT!”

Dawson and I locked eyes, and in the few seconds it took to blink the dust out of them, he had already made it over and yanked me off my feet. He held me bridal style and ran back into the house, slamming the door behind him and shoving a chair in front of it. 

“Are you okay?! What the hell was that?! You were just gone, and then you were all the way over in the cornfield! I was so worried! Are you hurt?! Where is the ..… what happened to ……. are we going to…..”

His voice was slowly replaced by a constant, high-pitched drone, flooding through my ears and blocking out all other sound. The shock must’ve been extended-release, because I spent the rest of that night in a haze. At some point, Dawson pressed a cuboid shape into my hand. It was a half-melted Rice Krispie treat, and I assumed it had spent most of the day in his crowded pockets. 

When my memories solidified, I was standing by the kitchen door. It was wide open, the cold knob firm in my grip. Dawson was sitting at the table, eyes bloodshot with a look of deep concern plastered on his tired face. 

A storm had rolled in, and mixed with the howling of the wind and the heaviness of the downpour, I could hear that same dry voice as it crooned Dawson’s name. It was taunting me.

“You need to go.”

Dawson looked up at me. 

“No.”

In the distance, odd shadows twisted just beyond the porch light’s reach. Every so often, it would flicker, and the shadows would dare to climb up the stairs, retreating when it returned. The dawn was on its way; there was faint light in the East, but it wasn’t coming fast enough.

“I want you to leave, Dawson. Go home to your parents.”

I hated how my voice shook like it was just another branch in the rain. The taste of iron filled my mouth as I chewed on the edge of my tongue.

“I’m not going anywhere, Newport. I won’t leave you alone here, not with that thing still out there.”

I like to consider myself a strong person. By design, farmers can’t be anything but. Beyond that, I’ve seen things that would drive most people mad. I’ve watched the ones I love slowly fade away and simply kept on going. But the hold I had on the shitty string that kept me together was fraying. My nerves were fracturing at the hands of the poster child for mad cow disease. I’d tried in earnest to end that thing, and now it was laughing at me out in the night. 

I picked up the shotgun off the floor and leveled it at Dawson. He stood up, but unlike any sensible person, there was no alarm or fear in his face. My hands were shaking like crazy, but my fingers were steady on the stock and barrel of the gun, nowhere near the trigger. 

“Wanna talk about why you’re pointing Alice at me right now?”

“Did you…. Did you give my gun a name?!”

Dawson cocked his head and got that dumb smile from the first time I’d aimed a gun at him.

“Yeah, I dunno, I thought it suited her. Also, Newport Jr . would’ve gotten me drawn and quartered.”

An ugly noise between a laugh and a sob came out of me.

“Stop distracting me! You need to get out of here! I’m not asking!”

The sky roared above us, loud enough to shake the walls. Dawson’s tone was annoyingly even. Somewhere deep down, I wanted him to yell at me. I craved an all-out screaming match, and I hated myself for it. The evil presence infecting my land was having more of an effect on me than I could fathom. 

“Newport, I’m not just going to abandon you when you’re in danger.”

It called out his name again as lightning arced across the sky. The stock of my shotgun began to crumble in my hands, breaking apart like soaked woodchips. 

“Don’t you hear that?! You’re in fucking danger too! It’s not playing games anymore! It… it knows that I care about you more than I care about myself!”

We were both silent for a few moments, staring at each other. I’d never seen a look of surprise that strong on Dawson’s face before. I couldn’t believe what I’d said, but it was true. There was no taking it back. 

“You… you *can* leave. I can’t leave— not again. You have a wonderful family and so much potential and I just… Yeah, I don’t want to die, and the animals need me, but let’s face it, in the grand scheme of things, it wouldn’t be some massive loss.”

Even with the barrel still trained on him, Dawson walked over and put a hand on my shoulder. The gun poked into his chest, but he didn’t seem to care.

“Just go. I’ll survive, and besides. Everyone leaves me eventually.”

I lowered the gun, nearly dropping it. Dawson’s other hand rested on my opposite shoulder, and then suddenly, I was being pulled into a hug. I could tell his mom had passed down her anaconda grip to him. I’m ashamed to say that I dead-fished the hug just a little. 

“Fine. I’ll go, but I’m not *leaving.* I’ll be here the second you need me. I want us alive, but if I had to be dead, I’d want to be dead with you. Losing is better with company.”

He pulled away but left his hands on my shoulders.

“If you die, I’m gonna kill you.”

I laughed, and it sounded worse than a cat barking. Dawson took my hand in his and pressed our thumbs together. 

“And for the record, the world would suck without you in it.”

I held his hand in mine for a second longer before shaking him off. I tried to sound firm and serious, but it just came out soft. 

“Stop lying to me and just get in your big red truck and go the hell home.”

Before he had time to say something smartass in response, I herded him out the door, Alice in tow. But she wasn’t an empty threat anymore; she was an admittedly ineffective defense against what was out there in the darkness. 

I walked back to the porch and lingered there, watching him wind up the road and making sure he didn’t pull any tricks. Out in the darkness, I could hear another dry laugh. 

“If you hurt him, I’ll make sure that there isn’t even scorched earth left of you.”

Thunder growled above me as the wind whipped through the ponderosas. It was a challenge. It was a real gag that it could goad me all I wanted, but the minute I got an attitude back, I was taken on a safari through the nine circles of Hell. 

I said nothing. I’d made my point.

As I watched Dawson finally turn off my driveway, that’s when I saw it. Underneath my feet, the porch steps were covered with mold. Things got a little foggy after that. My mind was filled with a singular purpose: to get rid of it.
