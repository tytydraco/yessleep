Jimmy had to go.

It wasn’t just for me, it was for the whole neighborhood. 

He was a horrible man and a terrible neighbor and if I had to listen to poor Charlene scream one more night I was going to make the whole town pay for it. I don’t care if he was a cop. He was also an asshole, and a bigot, and ten IQ points short of passing exam. And now he’s dead. 

And until three days ago, that wasn’t a problem for me. You see, I have the best sister in the world. 

Her name is Darla, and she’d do literally anything for me. Same I’d do for her. She’s the kind of sister I could call at three a.m. on a Wednesday night to pick me up from a college party gone bad. The kind of sister who would spend hours helping me untangle my hair after I let it dry in a braid. The sort of sister who would help me move across two states and back when I broke up with my first-ever-fiance. 

Darla always knew just what to do. 

The gun was still 'smoking' when I called her. She picked up the phone on the first ring, just like she always did. 

“I shot Jimmy.” I was shaken, but not sorry, “Monster forced his way in here looking for Charlene.” She wasn’t there, not that she wasn’t welcome. It was just that she knew her husband as well as the rest of us. 

“On my way.” She hung up- but not before I heard the note of pride in her voice. Darla always had my back. If I’d told somebody the sky was orange Darla would be behind me with a ten point presentation illustrating how right I was.

I put my cellphone down on the counter and stared at the mess I’d created. It was seeping into the kitchen while I tried to decide if trying to clean it would just make it worse. Probably, I decided. Darla would know what to do. So I waited. Not too long, she was there in less than ten minutes, but every one of those minutes felt like its own lifetime- each of them saturated in the smell of blood. 

And other things. 

She didn’t knock. She came in the back door with a plastic storage tote. 

“I’ll handle Jimmy. Go out back and hose yourself off.” She smiled. I knew then that everything would be okay. I didn’t regret what I’d done, not one bit, but I also didn’t want to go to jail for something that never should have been my problem. 

I did what I was told. I took the hose with me into the deepest part of my garden and methodically, inch by inch, washed the viscera off of my skin. My clothes had to go, so I used the garden shears on them once I was satisfied the blood wouldn’t transfer. I walked back into the house naked, carrying the strips of my clothes in my arms. 

“Good!” Darla looked up at me from over a small stack of tools and hardware, “You’re so smart. Just leave those over here and go get warm. I’m almost done.” 

The combination of adrenaline and a cold shower had left me exhausted- and I knew I could trust her. I could trust Darla with anything. So I took my naked butt upstairs and changed into my comfiest pajamas while she took care of the hard part. 

-But I never did fall asleep. I laid in bed and listened to her move throughout the house all night, well into the wee hours. I don’t know what she was doing. I told myself it was better not to ask. Not to know. If somehow we were found out the less we knew the less we’d have to lie about. 

The sun was peeking through the blinds when I came downstairs the next morning. Darla was standing in my living room looking triumphant. Hands on her hips, hair tied back, expression as radiant as any artist basking in the euphoria of their latest masterpiece.

“Done.” She pronounced. 

I hugged her and told her that I had the best sister in the world. Because I did. No one was ever as good at anything as Darla was at hiding that body. I felt so much better knowing it was done that I even walked her outside and stood there in the driveway while she backed away and drove off.

Nothing could have prepared me to see Jimmy’s front door open and watch a total stranger come out of Jimmy’s house. Wearing Jimmy’s clothes and everything. I’d never seen that man before in my life, but watched in speechless shock as he strode down the driveway and got into his truck- which he always parked at the curb. He drove away while I sprinted across the lawn and pounded on his front door, waiting for Charlene to answer. She never did. 

I fumbled out my cellphone and tried to call her, but the call refused to connect. We’re sorry, but the number you have dialed-

I tried to call her workplace, but no one answered there either. I pulled open my facebook page and tried to send her a message there, but to my horror her page was gone. And not just hers. Everyone’s page was gone. Everyone I knew was gone. 

It was a glitch, I thought. It had to be. I ran over to my other neighbor’s homes, peering in windows one by one, only to find they were all full of stranger’s photographs. Mailboxes full of stranger’s names. Some of them didn’t even have their doors locked. I hopped in my car and drove to the supermarket and no one I knew was there, either.

A whole town. My whole town, in which I’d lived all my life. In which I thought I knew every single living soul. All of them gone. Replaced by people I didn’t know.

Finally, sobbing and hyperventilating, I called my sister.

“Hey babe!” She answered, sing-song and chipper. I tried to explain what was happening, between broken sobs and fractured breaths.

“Hey, hey, hey- it’s okay. I told you I’d take care of it, didn’t I?” Her voice soothed me, I calmed down a little bit, waiting for her to explain. Of course she’d explain. Of course she had an explanation. My big sister knows everything.

“I need you to go back to bed and lay down for a while, okay? You’re about to realize some stuff and it’s best you’re not standing when you do.” I didn’t understand, but I did what she asked because I had no idea what else to do. 

I went home, still clutching my phone, and laid down in bed while she talked.

“I pulled some strings and made it all go away. Everything. Anything connected to Jimmy at all.” She laughed while I curled into the fetal position, achingly aware of what she was implying. Not everything. *Everyone.* 

Anyone who would have known he was missing. That had ever known him at all.

No one even knows he’s gone.
