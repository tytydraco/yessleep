The freakish, obscene thing that masquerades as "*The Nostalgia Critic*" has been popular for almost two decades. It seems like yesterday when I first stumbled across one of his videos. It was one of the early ones; the wall was still the right color and the camerawork just slightly above amateur porn. It was a review of some ancient video game movie-"*Street Fighter*."

It was full of random clips all cut together; off-color memes intersected in with the shrillest yell I had ever heard a man produce.

It was the funniest thing I had ever seen in my entire life.

Granted, I was about eight years old at the time. That's not to discount the "man" either-over the years he's evolved, grown his content with the times instead of against it. But in that first video, this odd suit wearing guy with a news cap and a hastily trimmed goatee; he was my idol.

As time grew and my YouTube tastes changed, Doug fell off my radar in favor of bug-eyed streamers and brain rotting lets plays. But he always held a . . . nostalgic place in my heart. I stayed sub to him and watched the occasional review that piqued my interest.

One of my favorites from the newer videos was "*Son Of The Mask*." He does this bizarre *Lord Of The Rings* sketch halfway through the review; I think it's some sort of metaphor saying Jamie Kennedy is the embodiment of evil.

Then again maybe I'm reading too much into it. 

A lot of the new stuff is like that, sketch comedy often lampooning the movie he's reviewing. A lot of it is hit or miss-but I can't dog the "guy" for branching out and trying something new. 

But I'm getting off topic now.

A few nights ago, a new video popped up in my feed. It was around 8pm, a couple hours off from his usual upload schedule. The title of the video simply read: *Found Footage.*

This hyped me up to no end-he almost never did horror content outside of October. I queued up the video on my obnoxiously large Fire TV and relaxed in my lazy boy to watch it in style. The thumbnail for this video was Doug super imposed against a backdrop of characters from various found footage films.

The characters were lazily photoshopped behind Doug-who was looking directly at the audience with his patented scowl. The whole thing was just low effort really. Not that his thumbnails were anything to write home about to begin with; but this whole thing seemed phoned in right off the bat.

The view count was almost non-existent as well. You could count it on one hand actually. I chalked that off to a glitch and clicked the video. 

It started with the Iconic Nostalgia Critic guitar riff; a metal version of "The Show Must Go On." Usually, the cast flies by as clips from past reviews play, but this time it was just Doug. He was dancing and frolicking in the green screened credits; constantly making soy faces and exaggerated screams.

Then the title screen popped up as the theme died down. The title screen is pretty amusing. The Critic puts his best tough guy face on and stands menacingly against a black backdrop with a glock in his hand as it then slowly dissolves to a cartoony logo.

This dissolves as well- he loves that effect- and we cut to The Critic sitting against a blueish wall. He had a smarmy look on his face as his hands are tented and crossed. His lips clicked as he swirled his head upward to a comical degree as he started the review. 

"Hel-loooo I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it, so you don't have to." he spoke with a prideful conviction. "Am I the only one getting sick of these? He whined. It then cut to various clips from a bunch of classic "FF" movies like *Paranormal* and *Willow Creek*. Royalty free music played over these clips as Doug explained his take. 

"After Blair Witch came out in 1999, audiences were astounded by this new type of film and craved more. Eventually, after the popularity of movies like Paranormal Activity the genre exploded. Unfortunately, that's when every Schmuck with a camera went- Hey I can do that!" 

He sounded more cynical than usual, but despite his brash attitude he had a point. If you went on any streaming service, you could find dozens, if not hundreds of FF movies.

"Some of them are good, but most are just low effort, low grade slop with a gimmick. And today we're going to be looking at the worst of the worst. Because GOD forbid, we ever watch anything with substance on this show." He shrilly spat. There was a look of pure disdain in his piercing eyes, like he could choke the life out of you just with a look.

"Let's start off with-*eugh*, *The Borneo Incident.*" He said with disgust. It was odd, seeing him have such visceral hatred for what he was watching. I'm not talking about his overacted rants about stuff like "*Battlefield Earth,*" looking at him now he was repulsed by the sheer mention of this movie.

Then it cut to. . . the beginning of the movie. I don't mean like a quick clip where he speaks over it and then it skips ahead after a snarky quip.

I mean it just started playing the movie.

The whole thing.

At times it would just cut to Doug sitting alone in his studio, boredom wrapped around him like a blanket. His face had the frozen expression of sheer disdain, no jokes, no annoyed comebacks. There was nothing.

In fact, as the movie played, he would comment over it-he would whisper:

"There's nothing here. Just nothing." over and over again. It was halfway through the movie, which is an hour and a half of shitty shaky cam footage in the jungle by the way; when I checked how long the video was.

The video was about 14 long. Not even his commercial compilations were this long. My immediate guess was this was some sort of stream I had missed that got archived.

Frowning, I skipped ahead to the end of the movie and stopped when Doug reappeared. He was holding a DVD copy of *The Borneo Incident* in his hands. He was looking down on it, pure disgust coming off his face in waves. He opened his jaw then, his disturbingly stainless white teeth glistening in the light.

He opened wide- his lower jaw seeming to unhinge itself like a snake. He chomped down with a sickening crunch, slowly chewing the bits of plastic and glass. He closed his eyes and let out a soft moan as he chewed, his face contorting in pain.

I could hear the bits of glass shatter and liquefy as chowed down. There was no blood- but a black ooze dribbled from his lips and down his chin. He titled his head up, his cap falling to the ground. I could see his head now, his impossibly bald head.

There were zero traces of any follicle on his scalp. It looked like he had been sheared clean with a laser, then any remains singed off. As he forced himself to chew, I could see veins pulsating and rising in his forehead. Sweat clung to his dome like angsty ants; his head shone like a radiant diamond as he groaned in agony.

His lips parted-his teeth stained with the faint black ooze. He let the sludge fall from his mouth and it landed on his shirt with a clump. His eyes rolled over white as he slumped back in his seat. The camera focused on that ball of gunk on his shirt; it looked like a furball with chunks of plastic and bile fused together.

The Critic was groaning, low vocalizations that reverberated around the room like the echos of the damned. The camera panned up to his face. He was deathly pale, the only color the dried spittle on his chapped lips. His scalp twitched and shuddered, like something under the skin was shifting and stirring. 

"There's nothing here. So bland. So dull. So tasteless and-mediocre." He drooled. His tone was dull and lifeless; there was no music or sound-just a shot of a man in the throes of mental torment. Suddenly he sprung forward, like a marionette flinging to life. His movements were jerky; I could see the skin on his arms shuffle across his forearms like wilted puddy.

With a shake and a blink, he was back to normal, giving a wide-eyed smile that showed off his entire row of front teeth. The only sign that anything had been wrong was the moist clump of filth on his shirt. 

"Well, that sucked. Maybe the next film will be better." he said cheerfully. He leaned forward, making like he was reading a que card.  "Next up let's take a look at-*Slender*? Isn't that a game?" There was a garbled voice off camera as Doug squared his face.

"They made a movie-this isn't the Sony one???" The garbled voice continued as horror washed over Doug's face. "What do you mean it's WORSE?" He moaned and put his head in his hands. The theme kicked in as it faded to black where it would usually go to an ad.

I was thoroughly confused by all this to say the least. Was this all just some elaborate bit? These special effects were outstanding, so life-like. It really looked like he had eaten that DVD. I skipped ahead a little, I had actually seen *Slender* before.

Dreadful movie, but the Slenderman costume they built was pretty cool I have to admit. Every time I resumed the video, I heard this gurgling noise. It sounded like someone was choking on their own spit and kept drying heaving to clear it.

I found a cut to Doug, and he was sitting there making that horrid noise. Drool pooled down the bottom of his lower lip, his eyes drifted lazily to the side as he consumed this awful flick. The movie was an hour and a half long, I think he was making that noise throughout the entire runtime.

Yeah, that's right-he just watched the whole movie again.

It was getting late now, but my curiosity was getting the better of me. After the movie ended it again cut to Doug holding a copy of it in his hands. He pursed his lips in sorrow as he cried, inky tears streaking down his face. His cheeks seemed sullen yet also bloated, his hands were misshapen and puffy. He seemed to be melting, like he was wearing a skin suit that was three sizes too large.

Again he unhinged his jaw, this gaping thing now, and sunk his perfectly molded teeth into the disk. The sounds of him chewing were grating to listen to-like glass striking a chalkboard. His cheek flaps flopped around as he did, jowls of flabby flesh bouncing to the rhythm of pained chewing. 

I winced away from my screen, my stomach churning at this grotesque sight. Eventually I heard him force a swallow and resume that awful moaning noise. It was then I noticed his pulsating cranium had grown. The top of his skull had embiggened, spider-like veins encircled his scalp as it throbbed like a heartbeat.

His eyes were empty, milky things as he mumbled and rocked silently in his chair. The skin around his scalp seemed to slope near the edge, like his skull had grown so large it had begun to collapse onto itself.

Finally black bile spewed from his mouth, and he smiled as he let himself be bathed in filth. His smile was ear to ear, a mocking grimace with perfectly outlined teeth. 

"Awful-rancid taste. Cliche and poor production design. No substance, no heart, no soul." He chattered. I was frozen in my seat, horrified at a bit gone too far. His suit was filthy and haggard; wrinkled and torn like he had pulled it out of a gutter. His glasses hung by the bridge of his nose, barely hanging on with each mournful breath he took.

 "Next movie-it-it must have substance." He wheezed. His voice sounded so shrill and sickly at the same time. He looked offscreen at some unseen thing that gurgled at him. He blinked his empty eyes and spoke once more. "What-the hell is *Bad Kitties*?" 

The next movie was, I can't even call it a movie really. It was an hour-long collection of teenage girls bitching each other out and committing petty theft. It kept ramping up and at some point, I thought they were going to go on a killing spree or something but no, it just sort of ends after one of them ODS or something, I forget it was so boring and nonsensical.

Afterwards he consumed the disk once more, forcing himself to swallow the nonsensical slop. Doug sank further, deflating like a flesh balloon. Black ooze foamed at his mouth, an abysmal bile boiling up from whatever churning hell his guts had become. 

"Awful." the thing on my screen gurgled. "Non-sense plot. Spin-ing Wh-eels for two hours. Need-sub-stance." It choked out. I skipped through most of the next two movies.

The next was *Meghan Is Missing*\-which the gelatinous thing turned off in disgust and frankly I don't blame it.

The final film was *V/H/S: Vira*l. When it started The Critic let out a piercing death scream, like the movie had physically assaulted him. Which given how bad *V/H/S: Viral* is that actually wouldn't surprise me.

It consumed two more DVDs, forcing them disks down his decaying gullet in agony. I couldn't look away from this video, it was like a trainwreck unfolding. After he choked down *Viral*, the screen flickered off and for a moment I thought it was over. Yet I could still hear the bubbling, gurgling mass of flesh Doug had turned into.

I dreaded what would appear once the video returned. To my terror, once it did, I clasped my mouth in shock.

The head was like an overgrown deflated mushroom. The cranium had grown so large it hid the still frothing mouth. What was once his perfectly bald scalp wrapped around his shriveled body like a comforter. His arms were gangly, loose skin hanging off his boney limbs like ill-fitting clothing.

They carefully waved around, searching for something to steady its dissolving form. It leaned forward and snapped back quickly, the flap of skin hiding its face now folding on itself. Poison was rushing out of The Crtic's mouth, a raging river of pure hatred with cheap plastic and even cheaper filmmaking.

His eyes were hollow and cloudy- I wasn't even sure the thing was fully conscious at this point. It twitched and gurgled like a deformed, malfunctioning puppet. It kept gaping his mouth like a trout gasping for water. 

"La-zy. . . Filmmaking." It choked out. He wheezed and brayed like a dying animal; his mushroom scalp scarred with frayed veins and withered skin. "Found-footage, hopeless. All-lost, art is-dead. We are all-dead." It croaked, sorrow in his voice.

From an unseen corner I heard a door open, and a voice calling for Doug. From the cranky Chicago accent, I think it was his brother Rob.

"Hey Doug, I need you to sign off on this script-oh Christ again?" He bemoaned. All the frayed pile could do in response was weep. Rob stormed off, speaking to others in the studio.

"Somebody get the movie box-it happened again." He sounded more annoyed then horrified his brother had devolved to this thing before me. Eventually Rob returned and fiddled with something offscreen-a DVD player maybe. Another voice was with him, a woman who sounded an awful lot like Tamara-one of his employees. 

"Third time this month." She muttered as Rob bashed his fist against something metal.

"Yeah, yeah, just cash your checks and keep your mouth shut." He grumbled. "Grab me something- I don't care as long as it's good." Tamara grabbed something and the screen cut once more to the beginning of another movie: *Savage Land*.

This one was great, a faux documentary that details the aftermath of a zombie take through the use of horrifying photos. They left the room, and I could hear Rob say, "This is nowhere near as bad as when he watched *Scary Movie 5*." 

I scrubbed through the rest of the video. Slowly but surely, as the film went on Doug began to regain some form of coherent speech. I could hear flesh squelching and bones snapping back into place as Doug began to praise the movie.

The camera did not cut to him once during this time, but I could hear every disgusting detail as his body reformed. 

"Yes-yes it's so good." He moaned. "The movie is such a unique take on this oversaturated field.  The use of haunting photos to tell a story like this is such a breath of fresh air." he critiqued. "It's a tragic story as well, that warns us all that humanity's true nature will always be callus, and that irrational fear can always override rational evidence." He mused.

Finaly the film ended-and it cut back to a smiling, fully formed Doug. He was already chewing, savoring the taste of the movie. With an audible gulp, I could see something slide down his throat as he looked pleased with himself.

His bald head throbbed slightly, but he quickly put his cap back on and readjusted his suit for the camera. Then he just went on his end of the video tirade like nothing happened.

"-That was a much-needed reprieve, but honestly I think I've had my fill of found footage movies. Between the obscenely shaky footage, horrible overacting and just disgusting handling of certain topics, there is a lot of garbage out there. But even in a landfill, you can find a rose. Stuff like *Savageland* gives me hope for all the up-and-coming filmmakers out there-so more of that, and less of *Bad Kitties*." He said:

"I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remembered it, so you don't have to." He waved himself off camera and the screen cut to the credits as his theme roared.

I was stunned by what I had just witnessed. Doug's true nature, this tortured blob of flesh and blood. I tried to ignore it, but my nightmares of that night thought otherwise. I tried to find the video when I awoke from my restless sleep; but it was gone. vanished without a trace.

I tried looking for it, reaching out to fan forums and YouTube support. I was laughed off them and labeled an elaborate troll.

No one believes me about Doug.

The thing is- I don't think he's malevolent, or evil or anything. I just feel bad for the creature. Forced to scour the dredges of entertainment for our amusement. It starves itself for our benefit, ever searching for something with "Substance." I hope it finds what it's looking for someday, and whatever he "reviews" next, I hope it sustains him.
