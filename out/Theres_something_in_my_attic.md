My dad and I live in quite a remote area. I won't give out the exact area, but it's pretty far from any towns or  shops. Since I can remember, I've seen some strange things in our area. From eyes in the woods, to deep claw marks on trees. Even our horses were getting attacked. Whenever I told my dad about them, he would assure me that it was just a bear in the area and that I must be careful. And I believed him.

But as I grew older, I started to notice more and more things that I couldn't explain. One such incident started happening about 2 months ago. It was late one night. I was sitting in bed watching YouTube on my phone when I suddenly felt a wave of unease. Almost nauseous. And then I heard it. A faint growl. I wasn't too concerned because we do have dogs. But the growls started getting louder and more deep. They were coming from above me. I brushed it off as a raccoon or some other small animal. The next night, same thing. A deep bellowing growl. This time though, they were accompanied by a scratching sound. Again, I assumed that it was a raccoon and reminded myself to tell my dad about them the next day. It was that next day that our dog Riley went missing. Riley was a large bull mastiff. He was ballsy to say the least. It wasn't unusual for him to disappear. He would sometimes make his way into the woods, but would always return by night. This time, he didn't. We spent a good for days looking for him, but our searches prevailed to nothing.

The growling and scratching went on for about a week or so. It was like clockwork. I would be in bed watching YouTube or playing a game, and I would hear that same growl and grumble. Fast-forward about a month and a half. It was nearly midnight before I decided to get some rest. I set my alarm for early the next morning, and rolled over. As I was drifting off to sleep, a massive crash echoed through the roof. I instantly shot up, wide eyed. My breathing was heavy and laboured. And then I smelt it. This horrible stench filled my nostrils. It smelt like a dead animal. I had seen and smelt enough deer carcasses in my days to know. I let out a cough as I pulled my shirt above my nose. I could hear rustling from my dad's room, so he had also heard it. Once again, I heard that deep rumbling growl. This time though, it was different. Whatever was up in my roof, didn't sound happy. The scratching and moaning was right above my bed. This was no raccoon. This was something else. Something far bigger. I summoned the courage to get up and make my way to my dad's room. Adrenaline coursed through me as the creature in the roof started screaming. It was ear piercing. I jumped and started to panic. By now, my dad was wide awake. I opened his door to find him loading his shotgun. I didn't even have to say anything. I looked into his eyes and he knew. We both knew.

My dad led the way up the stairs. I've always known my dad as a very brave man who wasn't scared of anything. But on that night, he looked terrified. We made it to the top of the stairs and he unlatched the door. I was right behind him holding a flashlight above his shoulder. Whatever was in the roof, went silent. Slowly we made our way through the doorway and into the roof. My eyes scanned the room for any signs of movement. Eventually they lay rest on this large dark lump near the corner of the room. I started to feel sick as I realized what it was. Guts and flesh, dried blood and skin lay strewn around. I could faintly make out a head and jaw. It was Riley. My dad could see this too. Suddenly, we heard a scream. I spun around to see this creature for the first time. And my God, it was massive. At least 200lbs or pure mass. I struggle to find the words to describe it. But here's my best attempt. It was about 7ft tall. Its shoulders were huge and attached to it, was just a deer skull. Deep black holes stood as eyes. It was covered in this dark black matted hair. Thick long arms with long thin fingers stuck out to the sides. It stood up like a human, but it most definitely wasn't one. It let out a scream so loud that my ears started ringing. Before I could react, it lurched forward. 

My dad fell back and his shotgun went off. It might've hit this creature, because I was suddenly covered in thick, warm and gooey blood. I landed hard, but didn't have time to register the pain. My dad pulled me up to my feet as the screaming continued. He pulled me down the stairs and slammed the door behind him. I lay at the bottom of the stairs, out of breath and covered in blood. My dad made his way to his office, with me not far behind. I could see the seriousness in my dad's face as he locked the door behind us. We took a couple of minutes to calm down and catch our breath. I didn't dare speak. I wouldn't even know what to say. The screams from the roof slowly turned to whimpers and wails. My dad was the first to speak. "Do you know what that is?" He said. I shook my head. "Well neither do I. It's been here ever since we moved in. I prayed for this day to never happen." I held my head low, not even knowing what to say. "Remember when you were younger?" My dad said. "And grandpa left?" He didn't have to finish his sentence. I already knew what happened to grandpa. "How did it get into the roof though?" I asked. "I don't know my boy, I actually don't know" 

So here I sit, on the floor of my dad's office. As I write this, my dad is fast asleep. We're taking shifts to sleep. I don't know what we're going to do. I don't know what that thing in the roof is or how we're going to sort it out. It's quiet above me, other than I small thud every now and then. I'll give you guys an update on what's going to happen within the next few days.
