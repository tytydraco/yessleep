It may be too late for some of you, but every since I was a child I would get an unsettling feeling every time I would look at my reflection. Just the way it would stare back blankly would give me a feeling of pure dread. It seemed as if it was tired, waiting for it’s opportunity to pounce at me and take my place. This fear took over me at a young age. I would be scared to close a door when I would use the bathroom or take a shower because I thought my reflection would come out and attack me almost like some urban legend. But as I got older I figured, “well it couldn’t really reach through the mirror and grab me, could it?” 

Well anyway, after going to college for  4 long, grueling years I became an interior designer and I was told to build a gigantic mansion. I was told that the most important part of the house was the mirrors. They were meant to tower over everyone in the house. They were meant to be 10 feet tall with no dents or marks in them. In every single room there stood at least 12 tall mirrors each showing your reflection with no cracks or handprints visible, Except for one large room with a mirror, even taller than all of the rest, with one massive scratch mark going down the mirror. It made me wonder just what kind of person wanted this house made. But whatever makes them happy, I suppose or so I was told to think.

While at lunch, I told my friends and co-workers about my fear of mirrors and they just laughed it off and shrugged as if it was just some irrational fear. This upset me. What if it was some irrational fear? I mean it’s insane to think that there is a clone of you inside a mirror, right? My co workers nudged me in to face my fears and in there I reached out to my mirror and placed my hand on it, making contact with what seemed to be just a regular mirror with my reflection inside of it. 

But something felt weird about it, almost like a cold body had grazed my skin. I jump back from this, but I notice that “it” is grabbing my arm trying to suck me in. Just as I had feared, our mirrors do hold a secret. Maybe not one that anyone knows about, but I do. I may be one of the luckiest men in the world, but not too lucky. I was saved. 

My friends came in to check my progress with facing my fears. And lucky for me, the demon or whatever the hell that “thing” really was pulled back. But my other friends weren’t as lucky they got pulled in by their own reflections out of nowhere. Now every day the sight of a mirror frightens me, I have removed every last mirror in my house but that face I will never forget here was a sketch I made of him. A face I will never forget.
