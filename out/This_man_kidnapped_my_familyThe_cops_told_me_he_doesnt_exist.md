I 30 years old and I’m living alone in Washington state. It wasn’t always this way, 5 years ago my wife and kids went missing and I know exactly who kidnapped them. The cops told me this person didn’t exist. 

5 years ago before my family was kidnapped, we lived a happy life as a small family. Me, my wife, my 5 year old son, and my 2 year old daughter.

I did my normal routine, tucked the kids into bed and then went into me and my wife’s room. When I woke up, all of them were gone without a trace. 

 1 week after my family disappeared was the first time I saw John Raker, he was standing across the street. I walked over to talk to him. I asked him if he’s seen my family, or if he’s seen any signs. By that time I had the entire police searching everywhere for my family. John said that he hadn’t seen them but he was willing to help find them. 

I appreciated John for willing to help me, but the next morning, I got woken up early, around 6:50 or so. I could here the storm cellar door being slammed shut. I got up and peered out the window. It was John Raker. He was in my backyard. I opened my window and yelled out to him. He said he was going down to search near the lake behind my house. I invited him in for a glass of orange juice.We talked for a bit then I asked him why he was looking in the storm cellar.  He told me not to go down there, he said it “wasn’t safe.” That night I put a lock on the storm cellar 


  I hadn’t seen John for couple days after that, until one night, I lurched out of bed when I heard metal clashing outside my window. The time read 2am. He had bolt cutters in his hands, and beside him were grocery bags, months worth of groceries. What stood out most were the diapers and the baby food. He was trying to get into that storm cellar. I sprinted down the stairs, and out the back door. He stopped dead in his tracks when he heard the door slide open. 

“what the fuck John” I yelled

He didn’t speak for about 30 second. He than said “your family needs me, Nick” I tried to shove past him to get into that storm cellar. He than pulled out a dagger out of his coat. He stuck the blade into my mouth. 

“If you ever go in there. I’ll kill your entire family” he said. I was gagging, and when he finally pulled that knife out, blood poured of my mouth like a river. I then watched him break the lock and enter the storm cellar with the food. I must have passed out because I woke up the next morning on the lawn. My vision was bright red and blurry. My entire mouth had been gutted. I drove straight to the police station. I told them about John Raker, I told them about my family in the storm cellar. The Officers searched through public records everywhere but never found him. The Police Chief called me in and told me that John Raker doesn't exist.The officers came to my house and searched the storm cellar. My family wasn’t in there, it was just the food from the night before. They offered to park the cruiser outside my house for the night and keep an eye out. That night I saw John Raker about 50 yards down the street from the police cruiser. The next morning when I asked the officer he said he never saw him. How could he not have seen John? The officer said I could give him the call the next time I see John. 

I went to bed that night and when I woke up John was standing over my bed dressed in all black. 

I yelled at the top of my lungs “GET THE HELL OUT” I yelled so loud that the women jogging by called the police. The officer came over and searched my entire house. John had disappeared again. After that day the entire police department thought I had gone crazy. 

Throughout the years, John had terrorized me. I’d see him almost every other day, weather he was across the street, or standing in the backyard. He was always watching. One night while I was shaving in the bathroom, I had a small glimpse of something behind the shower curtain move in the mirrors reflection. At that moment I knew exactly who it was. I wanted to show John I wasn’t afraid of him, so I just walked out of the room, turned the light off, and shut the door. That was a huge mistake. The next morning I woke up and all the knives in the kitchen disappeared. 

Every month John would bring food into the storm cellar. What I noticed is he stopped bringing food down there after the 3rd year. He stopped feeding my family. 

It’s the 5th year and I hadn’t seen John in over a month. I bought myself a shotgun to protect myself from John.I should’ve bought it way sooner, or was the shotgun there to protect me from myself. You see, the cops were right. John isn’t a real person, but he exists inside of me. I want my family back more than anything, but John, he wants them to suffer, he wants them to starve. John has been feeding them just the right amount of food and water so he can keep them alive. The storm cellar is where me and John would stock up the foods and essentials. The real prize was in the basement. And when I said John stopped feeding them after the 3rd year, it’s because the cashier at the grocery store became suspicious of us.

 Every 2 months or so, me and John would stock up. Diapers, baby food, vitamins. This was the type of town where everyone knew each other. Everyone knew my family was kidnapped. The cashier women started doing investigations of her own. I couldn’t take any chances. I stopped going to the grocery store, I stopped feeding my family. And if you were wondering about the knives, the knives were 6 inches deep in the cashiers flesh. 

As of now, my son would’ve been 10, and my daughter 7. My beautiful daughter, my wife, my son. All corpses because of John. How can those kids endure such a brutal death? How can I get rid of John for good? I bought a shotgun for a reason.
