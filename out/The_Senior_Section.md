Dorothy was 68; her birthday in the upcoming week. She had stopped caring about the yearly celebration about 20 years previously, it was just another day in her mundane life. 

Things were a out to change, but she had no way of knowing that. Dorothy continued with her usual activities, but her loneliness was overwhelming. She had lost everyone in her life that mattered and was forced to keep living, in utter isolation. 

Three days before her birthday, she decided to check out the local library. Books had always comforted her and served as a break from the monotony.

The library was an old brick building, not much larger than Dorothy's own one bedroom home. It was older than Dorothy and, like her it had a lot character. There was a small fenced in playground off to the side and the library itself had a good amount of ivy climbing the side of the building. 

Dorothy knew the librarian, Mr. Goldberg for more than a decade but he was a good 20 years younger than her.  He smiled and quietly greeted her as she entered. 

She quickly made her rounds, picked out a few Nora Roberts novels and headed back up to the front with her choices.  Mr. Goldberg gave her a cheesy grin, he'd never been a fan of Nora and always made it known. 

"You know" he said, "we have a new section open for readers 65 and above?" "Hmm, no. What sort of books do you have there?" she asked.  "Well, I actually don't know, I don't fit the age requirements so I'm not even allowed to shelve them. It's a mystery to me, you can't even check out from that section. I'd love to know what's down there!" 

Dorothy puzzled at this point responded with "Ok, you've piqued my interest! Where is this new section?"  Mr. Goldberg looked a little nervous to tell her. "Well, it's in the basement. You can only get in with this key card and your i.d. card. Joe will be at the door, he's kind of like a bouncer, don't worry he's a puppy dog if you belong there."

What an odd thing to say Dorothy thought as she took the key card and headed to the basement.  She couldn't help but feel a little excitement as she made her way. What is so special about this section that you have to be 65 or above? It all seemed like a weird fever dream. 

When she reached the basement it occurred to her that she had seen every corner of this building before and had never seen this door, or even known that it existed. 

Joe was standing outside the door, he looked to be about her age, possibly a few years older. He was small in stature and dressed well, so she was surprised when he spoke in a booming, commanding voice. Must of been a marine or something she thought. "I.d. card" he said. Dorothy trembled a little as she handed it over. He flipped it over in his hands and studied it like it was fake, she wondered what happened to the people who weren't supposed to be there and a shiver ran down her spine. "Ok Dorothy, looks good. Go ahead in." She scanned the key card Mr. Goldberg had given her and the door beeped in response, letting her know she had gained entry. 

When she opened the door she was surprised to find a set of well lit stairs leading down in to a large open room with a single desk in the corner. There were book shelves as far as she could see. She couldn't help but wonder how the room was so large, she suddenly felt like she was on Dr. Who. It was the only thing in her mind that she could compare it to. 

There was a tiny woman sitting at the small desk in the corner, she looked as though Dorothy had just woken her up. She stood up and straightened her dress, approaching Dorothy. 

"Good afternoon, I'm Martha" she said. "Welcome to the seniors only section, I see that you are new so let me explain some rules."

"The use of phones or electronics is prohibited, you may not at any time take photos or videos of any of the books contained in this room or anything else seen in this room. You may not take notes or draw anything seen within this room, nothing leaves this room aside from what you have brought in" she continued. 

"I'm sure I need not say it, but no food or drink are allowed. Talking must be limited to low whispers after I'm done telling you these rules."

"Now I must ask you to hand over all electronics and drawing instruments as well as paper, lipstick, eyeliner, small mirrors and any food or drink you have on your person." she rambled off. 

Dorothy was shook, why all these precautions she thought. She handed over her whole purse and her ancient cell phone to Martha. 
"I'm sorry I have to do this she said, I need to pat you down before you are free to roam amongst the books." 

Dorothy was in shock. I should just go she thought, this just seems like a lot. As if her body and brain weren't connected she raised her arms and spread her legs and allowed Martha to pat her down. "Ok" she said. "You are free to browse now."
