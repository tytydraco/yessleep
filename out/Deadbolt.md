So, a few days ago I had a weird experience. I would have dropped it if it didn't stick with me like this. I'm putting it here for either answers or assurances.


Power outages are a very normal part of my life. It was practically part of my weekly routine. The city couldn't afford to keep everyone at full power all of the time. The lights have never been an issue for me, and I’ve never had this particular problem before. There's still a chance that this didn't really happen but I'm not sure anymore. 

The lights had shuttered off right as I slid the deadbolt of the door closed. The faint scent of mildew suffocated by air freshener welcomed me home to my cramped, dingy apartment. 

I set down my grocery bags onto the creaky dining table after locking the door, placing the paper bag with my dinner onto the stovetop. I had lived here long enough to know my way around the almost claustrophobic area in the dark. 

I called out to Boris, my roomate of five years, to let him know I was home. Even with the poor condition and small space of the apartment, I couldn't afford it on a single income alone. Customer service doesn't pay enough for me to live on my own. Luckily for us though, I had managed to take home some leftovers from work, meaning neither of us would have to cook dinner that night. I had been expecting some kind of response, Boris normally would yell back at me to keep my voice down, or that the dishes still needed to get done. 

Today, however, I was met with silence, the rhythmic tapping of our leaky faucet the only sign of movement. Given the late hour, I had simply assumed that Boris had gone to bed early. After all, Boris had been up all night studying for his calculus exam the night before, so he probably crashed right as he got home. 

The groceries were methodical; Vegetables in their designated drawer of the ice box, placing perishables in the fridge, placing cans in the pantry, ignoring that nagging urge to turn the lights back on. It wouldn't do anything, but being unable to see properly would always take a bit of getting used to.

The sink was filled to the brim with precariously placed dishes. We didn't have enough space for an automated dishwasher and Borris hated doing dishes more than he hated doing his coursework so the responsibility always fell to me. I figured that since we were having pre-prepared food, I could put off doing dishes until later that evening. 

I sighed in resignation and decided to make the short walk over to the bedroom. We only had one, taking turns sleeping on the creaky couch. I had to wake Boris so that he knew there was cooling food waiting for him. 

I flicked on the flashlight of my phone, shining it into the room. There were a few clothes on the floor, tests and papers scattered around the floor, as well as a few dishes. A run down laptop blinking away in the corner. 

The bed was empty

I frowned into the empty room. Boris wasn't the most social person so it was hard to believe that he was having a night out. I would have left it alone but it really wasn't like Boris to leave without saying anything. He even sent me a text before leaving to go to his classes in the morning or before he went to work. I turned of the light of my phone and sent him a text

>> where even are you??

I stood in the dark of my apartment, listening to the faint hum of the heater. Boris was never the best at responding rapidly, so I wasn't going to hold my breath for an immediate response. I slowly made my way back to the kitchen area, hoping the lights would turn back on so I could lose this gnawing feeling.

I knew it was illogical, but the dark made me feel uneasy. I hated that I didn't know where Boris was, he could be anywhere. My mind jumped to the worst case scenarios. He could have gotten into a car wreck, he could have been mugged or shot, Boris could be-

My phone buzzed.

<< Go outside

I let out a sigh of relief. It was entirely like Boris to go stargazing during a power outage. I hadn’t noticed him on the stretch of lawn the complex had when I had showed up with the groceries, but I had been pretty distracted when coming in so it’s entirely possible that I just missed seeing my roommate. I figured I should still probably let Boris know about the food while it was still relatively fresh, common courtesy and all that. It had long gone cold but I figured it was better late than never.

I stepped out into the sharp night air, feeling a slight shiver as I stepped onto the metal landing of their apartment complex. The dark of the night was almost suffocating. It seems silly saying now, but I could almost feel that childlike fear of monsters returning as I looked out into the black. I couldn't see the stars, I couldn't even see faint city lights. I  couldn't see a thing. 

“Boris?” I called out into the black. 

There was no response. 

I took a cautious step forward, moving further onto the landing and pulling out my  phone to turn the flashlight back on. The battery was low. 

“Boris?” I called again, voice shaking slightly. Fear slowly seeped into my thoughts. 

The light didn't reveal much. It should have gone much further than it actually did. The lawn wasn't even in view. Only the rails of the landing. It was unreasonably quiet, even my shouts couldn’t cut through the silence. We live in a big city, there is always shouting and honking, cars driving through, no matter the hour. It was eerie to have a quiet so complete. I could only hear my heart beating in my chest. 

I tried telling myself to calm down but I couldn't think of a reasonable explanation for what was happening. The city was never quiet. Even with their frequent power outages, you could still hear the thrum of people and cars and life. It was as if the city was dead and I was left with the remains. 

I called out for Boris again. Stepping further and further away from the apartment. Calling his name, for my neighbors, for anyone who could possibly hear me. 

There was no response. 

I was starting to feel the creeping edge of panic. Heart thumping and almost imperceptibly increasing in pace. What was I even supposed to do? Go to sleep and pray that it would be over when he woke up?...That actually didn't sound like too bad of an idea. 

I quickly swiveled on my heel and walked the five paces to get back inside. I reached my destination, apartment number 426. I pulled on the handle only to be met with the clicks of a closed and locked door. It didn't make any sense. I double checked the number, trying the door again to no avail.

I quickly shoved my phone away and rummaged in my pockets for the keys. I fumbled to unlock the door, sliding the key in the lock and turning, trying for the handle again. The deadbolt had been put in place. I was locked out of my own home. It couldn't be real. It had to be a sick joke.

I had started pounding on the door.

“This isn't funny, Borris!” I yelled at the door. Slamming my fist against the door. Suddenly furious that my roommate would do something like this. The quick movement of my arms warmed me up slightly. My threats were met with silence. There was no response even when I offered to do his laundry for a month. No matter what I said, I was met with a cold, hollow, silence. As if the air was swallowing my cries and pleas. 

I tried calling Boris only to have all calls go straight to voicemail. I called 911, my mom, anybody. Nobody picked up. There were no signs that anyone else was even alive. Even Google didn't bring up any results. 

“Do you need help?” A voice called from the left of me, the noise almost deafening in the silence. I almost jumped out of my skin at the intrusion. the voice sounded strange, almost like a mockery of something familiar.

Dimly I registered that the voice had come from the left. The stairs onto the landing were from the right, meaning the voice was from someone who lived in the area. Despite how odd the entire situation was, I wasn't going to turn down the company or the help.

“Oh! Uh, yeah. Yes. I'm locked out of my apartment.” I stumbled back from the door and moved to pull my flashlight out for the man to my left. Eager to see the man who had come to my aid.

“Don't.” He said suddenly, before I had the chance to do anything.

I paused. “Don't what?”

“That light isn't going to help anything. you’d just be drawing attention to yourself.” His voice said smoothly. 

“Okay…” I replied slowly. Feeling dread and apprehension crawl into my system. “Well, my roommate won't let me back in and-”

“Give me your keys.” The man said. 

I hated the idea of this man going into my house. I didn't want to hand over the keys to my apartment. Especially not to this stranger.

“No, I can do it.” I assured.

“It's not about ability. It's about opening the door. Your roommate isn't home to open it.” The man said easily.

“I- Is there any other way to get inside?” I asked. 

I could hear the smile on the man's face when he replied. “I suppose we can always look for your friend.” 

I hesitantly agreed, and felt the air shift around me as the stranger walked past. I followed the sound of footsteps. The sound was offset, distorted to my own ears. The sound of shoes against metal muffled and amplified in the space. I followed in almost complete silence before I swallowed my apprehension and eventually asked a question.

“So, who even are you?” I asked the stranger.

“I’m a friend.” The voice replied airily, sounding entirely too distorted to be human. “I'm here to help you, to save you.” 

I was unsettled by that answer. I knew I would feel much better if I could see. If only I knew where I was or what was going on. Instead all I had was the scent of my own breath and the rushing of blood in my ears. 

I was led down the steps of the apartment, hearing the switch from my shoes clanking on metal to the easy click of cement. My hand on my phone and the cold of the night grounding me as my thoughts screamed at me that something was wrong.

I felt increasingly uneasy as I was led away from the apartment. I was getting further away from my only safe point. Even when trying to keep logical and calm, the panic was settling into my gut. I tried to ground myself but I couldn’t shake the feeling. I kept coming back to the voice of the stranger. Something wasn’t right. 

With every step further away, I felt more and more trapped. I was a fly waiting for the spider. I was a rabbit caught in a snare. I had to run and I had to run now. Whatever was leading me away was not a friend. It was not human. I didn't really know how I knew, besides the realization that the voice that it was speaking in was a direct mirror of my own. Twisted and distorted but almost unmistakable.

Not wanting to second guess myself, I took my opening and ran as fast as I could. Feet pounding to the beat set by my own heart.

I fumbled for my phone light. Almost dropping the phone in the process. I used the light to see the pavement as I ran. 

I could hear the sound of something following me. It wasn't footsteps, it wasn't human, it was just following. Following right behind me. 

I glanced behind me, shining the light as I went and briefly spotting a spindly white limb moving in a blur.

I made it to the stairs with whatever it was seconds behind me. Ignoring the ache of my bones and the exhaustion in my frame, I ran. Adrenaline fueling my every movement as I clambered up the stairs.

On the third landing, I tripped. Slamming into the cold metal of the floor. Phone skidding from my hands, The light breaking as the thing got ever closer. The light wasn't consistent anymore, flickering on and off as I moved to my feet, barely managing to pick up the fading light as I stood.

Run.

I had to run.

I  managed to get to the fourth landing and grabbed my keys. Praying that the door would be unlocked. 

I tried the door once, locked. 

I jammed the key into the lock as I heard the thing behind me finish climbing up the stairs, phone held in my teeth as I caught glimpse of what looked like incredibly pale skin. 

The door unlocked and opened. 

I bolted inside and moved to slam the door behind me. 

The door caught on an arm. Long and pale and forcing the door open with more force than I could possibly fight against. 

“Don’t you want help?” The thing asked, in a twisted alteration of my own voice, trying it’s best to claw its way into my home. The sound of its voice–of my voice–shattering any bravery or resolve I might have mustered up.

I gave up the losing battle of keeping the door closed and ran. Shoving past the creaking table and almost tripping over piles of half-folded laundry. 

I had made it to the bedroom right as my phone finally died. The flickering light stayed off. 

I scrambled for anything. Something to fight with or hide in or anything. I couldn't think, couldn't breathe. I was dead. I was going to be torn apart by the thing that had taken my voice and offered me help and lead me away and–

I felt something grip my arm and I froze with pure terror. Unable to move. Unable to scream. 

The lights flicked on. 

Boris was standing in front of me with a concerned look in his eyes. 

I nearly cried with relief.

The power had returned. Whatever had happened was obviously some kind of messed up nightmare and I was fine. I had never hallucinated before but that seemed the most logical answer to why I had a scraped knee right then. Any possible thoughts of other worlds and alternate dimensions were to be shoved out of my thoughts immediately because they were ridiculous. 

I instinctively dismissed any thoughts that what had happened could have been real. I was in my house, right where I had been when I had sent Boris the first text. Boris probably came back from his star gazing and had found me on the ground. 

I shakily started to laugh. Unable to process the situation any other way. I just had to do something that wasn't scream or run or cry. 

“Woah, uh.” Boris said, looking nervously at me. “I'm really sorry to have scared you like that.” He said, rubbing his hands on his neck.

I waved him off, composing myself just enough to be convincingly normal. 

“I was just wondering why you didn't shut the door.” He said.

I continued to dismiss him and we ate dinner. Only after the fact did I really think about what he said.

 I know that I locked the door, I know that I shut it. I know this for a fact so it makes no sense that the door was open. Boris had no reason to lie about it. I've never hallucinated before and I get almost eight hours of sleep every night so there's no reason for me to have hallucinated this, but I can't think of anything else that would make this make sense

So I'm wondering if you guys have any ideas or theories as to what happened there?
