I was lying in bed in my etheric body feeling like I'm floating two inches above my bed not fully in my body. Having pleasant dreams about going up and down streets from a birds-eye view at night. It was calm and quite peaceful.

Then, out of the blue, I hear with my real ears the sound of a rattle which reminded me of a rattlesnake, but it was much louder like maracas. This maraca sound started at the tips of my toes and proceeded to go higher and higher until it was getting closer to my head. I didn't know if it was a snake, or something else.

I wasn't panicking because I was in such a calm state. I could of flipped over and seen what it was, but just decided to keep relaxing. Then suddenly, it captured me in what felt like a whirlwind or tornado force, and whirled me around in the dark. I could feel the bed spinning and everything with no wind. I felt like I was being taken to another dimension, my instincts told me. I heard my sons voice say "I love you mom." The only thing I called out was that I never wanted to forget my son, (we'll call him Lei for the sake of his identity). Then the winding stopped, and began winding backwards, much slower than before. It stopped, but didn't feel it rewound all the way. So I may have woken up in a parallel dimension.

Everything that has happened since, like COVID-19, everything seems to be related to this event. I had already had a kundalini awakening prior to this, and had reached the crown chakra. I knew nothing about spirituality so I had to search this up. I don't think this shaman, or whoever had done this to me was supposed to do this to an awakened person who was in the middle of healing their trauma.

There was a time prior to this event where I saw a cross symbol on my right wall beside my bed for two weeks straight. Which I attributed to the light coming in to my bedroom from the street in a unique way. Although it had never made that symbol before. I tried closing the blinds and it didn't change.

Then the following week, I woke up to seeing a triangle with an eye in the middle of it, with the eye moving out of the triangle on the side of my bookcase, and hovering in the middle of the same wall beside my bed for two nights. Then the next night it was a pentagon, and finally the next night a butterfly.

One of the nights between these events, I awoke to a portal spinning a few feet away from me. I kept staring at it, wondering what it was doing there. Slowly what emerged in three dimensions, was a solid gold, what later I looked up to be a rosacrucian-style helmet from the templar ages. A second one emerged as well. I didn't know if I was supposed to grab them. It was like a 3D movie where you almost feel like you can grab what pops out at you. Because this has never happened to me, I just sat there looking.  A few nights later something awoke me and I watched myself, with perfect accuracy, wake up, and catch a game piece that came out of the ceiling, past my ceiling fan. I looked at it, fully awake, and realized it didn't come from the bookshelf, or anywhere. I held onto it and put it under my pillow. In the morning, it was still there so it wasn't a dream. I looked all over the house for any game pieces I had that may match that game piece, but I didn't own any. Secondly, I know it was teleported telepathically somehow into this dimension. I couldn't of, even if it was a natural piece being blown, woke up with perfect accuracy and caught it at the perfect timing.

If somebody knows if someone is playing a game with me, and whether once you reach a certain level, you're a target, please reach out, because I don't think you can heal from being haunted by these adepts. There is nothing reassuring about them.
