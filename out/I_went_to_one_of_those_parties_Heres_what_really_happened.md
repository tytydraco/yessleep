I know what you’ve heard about these parties. The baby oil, the freaky shit, the NDAs. It’s all over the news now, everyone acting shocked like they didn’t already know how Hollywood works.

But I was at one of those parties a few years ago. And I’m telling you right now—the sex, the drugs, the wild stories? That’s the cover-up.

The truth is much worse.

I got the invite through a client. Back then, I was an up-and-coming talent agent, still clawing my way into the industry. My roster was small—some TikTok kids, a couple of SoundCloud rappers, and one stand-up comedian who kept getting banned on Twitter. But I had a good reputation. I wasn’t just some desperate newbie; I had a future.

So when my client, a mid-tier rapper, told me he could get me into the party, I didn’t hesitate.

“You gotta come,” he said. “This is how you level up. These parties? It’s where real deals happen.”

I should’ve asked more questions. But I was young, hungry, and stupid.

The invite wasn’t a text or an email. It was a physical card, black with embossed gold lettering. No address, just a time and a phone number. I called, a voice gave me the location, and that was it.

No plus-ones. No details.

It was already weird, but I figured that’s just how rich people did things.

The house was in Beverly Hills, but not in the way you’d think. It wasn’t some gaudy influencer mansion. It was old money—huge, but understated. No paparazzi, no screaming fans. Just black SUVs and tinted windows.

Inside, it was everything you’d expect. Champagne fountains. Girls who looked like they had a million followers minimum. Rappers, actors, executives.

And the host? You already know who it was. I won’t say his name, but if you’ve been paying attention to the news, you don’t need me to.

At first, it was just a party. Loud music, expensive liquor, people doing coke off marble countertops. Industry people love to pretend they’re above starstruck behavior, but everyone was watching him. The way he moved, the way people spoke to him—like he was a god.

I saw a couple of big-name actors, a few Grammy winners. Everyone was cool, but there was this… feeling. Like we were all waiting for something.

Then the clock hit three.

And everything changed.

It started subtle. The music didn’t stop, but it changed. Something slower, heavier. The kind of sound that gets inside your skull.

People stopped dancing. Conversations got quieter. There was a shift in the air, like the room itself was holding its breath.

I noticed the staff first. Up until then, I hadn’t paid much attention to them—just background noise, refilling drinks and clearing glasses. But now they were lined up along the walls, standing perfectly still. Watching.

And then the doors shut.

Not just shut. Locked.

I was near the main entrance, and I heard it—this deep, metallic clunk as the deadbolts slid into place.

People weren’t surprised. No one panicked. If anything, the energy in the room heightened. Like this was what they’d been waiting for.

A man in a suit—one of those nameless billionaire types—took off his watch and set it on a tray. Someone else followed. Jewelry, phones, anything metallic. Like they were preparing for something.

My stomach was in knots. I turned to my client, whispered, “What the fuck is happening?”

He didn’t look at me.

“Just follow along,” he muttered.

And then the host stepped forward.

And everything really went to hell.

I should’ve left the moment the doors locked.

Should’ve caused a scene, forced my way out, done something.

But I didn’t.

I told myself I was overreacting. That this was just some elite rich-people tradition. Maybe a toast, some weird inside joke, or even some “Eyes Wide Shut” type shit.

But then I saw their faces.

The way people changed.

Not everyone—some were like me, first-timers, confused but playing along. But the ones who knew?

They were calm.

Excited, even.

Like they’d been waiting for this all night.

The host—him—raised a hand. The room fell silent.

He smiled, looking at us like a father addressing his children. Then he spoke, voice low and deliberate.

“We give thanks,” he said.

And the room responded.

It wasn’t applause. It wasn’t cheering.

It was whispering.

A hundred voices, speaking in unison, murmuring something I couldn’t understand. The sound crawled over my skin.

I turned to my client.

“What the fuck is this?” I hissed.

He didn’t answer.

The host gestured to a group of people near the center of the room. They stepped forward. A mix of men and women, young, beautiful. I recognized a few—models, influencers, a couple of actors who’d been in Netflix shows.

They walked to the middle of the room and knelt.

And then the lights dimmed.

Not like someone flipped a switch. It was like the room itself got darker. The walls seemed to breathe, shadows stretching in ways that didn’t make sense.

The air felt thick, charged with something wrong.

The host stepped toward them, placing a hand on the first person’s head. He said something too quiet for me to hear.

And then—

They started shaking.

Not convulsing. Not seizing.

Shaking like they were vibrating, like something inside them was trying to crawl out.

Their mouths opened, but they didn’t scream. They just… gasped, like they were drowning on dry land.

And then—

I swear to God—

Their shadows stayed behind.

Like something peeled out of them. Dark, shifting shapes stretching across the floor, slithering toward the host.

He opened his arms.

And the shadows crawled up his body.

I didn’t even realize I was moving until I felt the bathroom door slam behind me.

I locked it. Pressed my back against it, heart slamming against my ribs.

I could still hear them. The murmuring, the low hum of whatever the fuck was happening out there.

I turned to the window.

It was small, too high up. But I didn’t have a choice.

I climbed onto the sink, shoved it open, and pulled myself through.

I hit the ground hard, twisting my ankle, but I didn’t stop.

Didn’t look back.

I limped to the nearest street, flagged down a car, and begged the driver to take me anywhere but there.

I didn’t sleep for two days.

Didn’t tell anyone.

What was I supposed to say? “Hey, you know that party? It wasn’t an orgy. It was a fucking ritual”?

I tried searching online. Nothing. No leaked videos, no whispers on Twitter. Just the usual rumors—sex, drugs, debauchery.

And then, the last year, the first headlines dropped.

“Wild Secrets of [Redacted]’s Exclusive Parties!”
“Sources Claim ‘Freaky’ Behavior, NDAs, and Baby Oil at Elite Gatherings.”

It was everywhere.

I felt sick.

Because that wasn’t the story. That was the distraction.

They wanted people to think it was just another Hollywood sex scandal. Because if the truth ever got out?

No one would believe it.

But I was there.

And I know what I saw.
