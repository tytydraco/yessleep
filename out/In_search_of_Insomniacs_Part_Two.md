I want to start off by thanking everyone who responded to my question in my last post. While I have tried chamomile I have not tried Valerian root, and thankfully the singular CVS in town had it in a mass produced capsule form. It was the one silver lining from this morning. 

To the individual who messaged me personally and offered up micro dosing psilocybin, it looks like I’m taking a vacation to Canada once this project is done. Unfortunately it’s not something I can try right now even if I could get my hands on it. 

My crew is the closest thing I have to a family, each of them some straggler Dave had picked up along the way and plopped into my hands to train up. 

I was four years into this when we met Matt, our human version of an excavator, a big Texan kid who had dropped out of ACU, a Christian college, after a nervous breakdown due to being thrown into that sort of culture after 13 years of homeschooling. He took to cleaning like a duck to water, years of mucking stalls on a family ranch gave him not only the stamina for the 10 plus hour days but the mentality he’s not better than anyone else and we were all in this together. 

Two years later Matt and I got Zeek, who by all accounts just kind of appeared one day. It was right after Lola, actually. He was the sweetest and kindest man with the weirdest collection of tattoos mixed perfectly with even odder music taste I’d ever met. Zeek eventually folded and told us his story a year in. He was a ‘road toad’, he set up the equipment for a plethora of low budget small name bands, and he got out of it when the band he was left behind in the middle of nowhere after a minor disagreement. Cheyenne had been their last stop and they just didn’t need him anymore. He applied to half a dozen jobs while living in a shelter and Dave took him in the moment he heard the man could carry a washing machine down a flight of stairs by himself with his only explanation of this being he was Samoan and he was just built different. 

Then there was why I couldn’t in good faith take micro doses of anything like that. Danny, the small boat a loving god refused to let run aground but always stuck on a stormy sea. The three of us took turns manning the metaphorical lighthouse of a friend group so he was never too far from a clear way to a safe place. He was in Cheyenne 4 years ago for rehab, we’d met because the same non-profit ran my anger management classes and his NA ones were down the hall. He’d asked me the stupidest question I’d ever heard which was something about how someone as queer looking as me ended up here. I told him to go fuck himself. His bark of laughter and statement of how I needed my classes made me realize we had misunderstood each other. After I explained that there are, in fact, queer people in Wyoming and the story of why I was in the classes, he told me his. 

Danny had been down in Colorado for College, gone to a frat party, then a year later he was dropped out, homeless, and addicted to amphetamines. He hardly remembered the next two years. Then it happened, he was given fentanyl laced crystal and nearly passed from the OD. He’d taken the help when it was offered by a priest and gotten moved out here. Three of the four years, he’d worked with us he’d been completely sober. We threw a party every full year that passed because Danny was the sweetest and kindest man any of us had ever met. He’d give you the shirt off his back or shoes off his feet, if they were your size, and you needed them more than him. I’d seen him do it for a homeless person twice in broad daylight. 

So, of course, the first person who got hurt had to be Danny. 

We were entering the house, suited up, and ready to work when Dave mentioned the room we couldn’t get into. Danny being the smallest and lightest of us said he could walk along the top of the trash and get into the room to report the state to us. Matt and Zeek were stationing everything in the clean bedroom with Dave while I stood with him as he mounted the pile and crawled to the room. The door opened, Danny slipped in, and then everything went to shit. 

The screams perked all our heads up, they weren’t human. They were the shrill ones animals give off when they’re startled and when Danny booted the one closest to him out of shock it bit back. I was the babies rush towards me and knew why she had chosen violence without question. I let them pass and hopped up on the banister to get on top of the trash.

My whole body broke out in a fever chill, I didn’t even hear the banister give, all I could hear was this howl of laughter that paralyzed me. At first I thought it was Dave’s panicked reaction but then I could feel more than hear how wrong it was. 

My body turned from muscle memories to brace from impact but I looked towards the banister to find the laugh, seeing the frantic mother screaming for her babies as her tiny world came crashing down harder than my body into a lifetime of newspapers, magazines, and bills. I actually sort of sank in to them in a nauseating, but thankful, kind of way. Still looking up to the others, I swore for a moment I saw someone peaking at me from the room where the raccoons had been. 

She was a head taller than Danny, a golden shower of waved hair crested by sharp white light behind her. Those eyes wide enough to see the whites above ocean blue, mouthing something rapidly as she put a hand on Danny’s shoulder. The way he snapped his head back to look at her then turned fully to look around caused me to blink a few times. She was done as quickly as she came, and then the pile released me sickeningly gentle to the floor until  the crucified Christ was directly in my line of sight. 

Matt lifted me as Zeek came rushing down holding Danny by the shoulders as a rose of blood bloomed through the white hazmat suit at the ankle. Dave’s hard lumbering steps and swears lead us out of the door towards the RV, which he drove us here in. He rushed Danny in as Matt begged me to get checked out too. I opted to go nab those capsules from the pharmacy. I’d had worse. 

Now that Danny was discharged we were all waiting for the hammer to drop. How we would go about this all depended on how Dave felt about it. 

“How’s your ankle doing?” Zeek asked as Danny climbed back in the 

“It’s fine.” It was a clear lie given the limp he had on flat ground “little tender. Arms worse. They gave me rabies shots.” 

“Either way we’re gonna need someone to sit in the dining room and start packing up the dining room China. The email Dave sent me yesterday said the husband said it was his mom’s and he really wants as much of it as is salvageable. I’m gonna need Matt and Zeek clearing out the hallways so we have a path for animal control to get in through, so it might as well be you Danny.” 

“If the bastard ever answers. For now just pack all of em up.” Dave nodded 

“Dave and I are gonna have to handle the back left bedroom ourselves, given the state of the flooring so I need the three of you to stay on the first floor with us and unfortunately no headphones or music until the raccoons are removed.” I sighed getting a few well earned looks and huffs 

They didn’t have to like it. This was about them not getting hurt. Danny hobbled over and sat next to me waiting for the others to get distracted before whispering eyes dead ahead. 

“Why were you staring at me when you fell?”

He had his hands together in his lap but I could tell they were shaking a little. 

“I thought I saw something behind you.” 

I wasn’t about to tell him I’d seen her but I didn’t want him thinking he was crazy. If I could play it off that there had been something there, we’d both feel better. 

“That rooms spotless, Sol.” He whispered shaking his head “like the bedroom. It looked like a classroom. There was still stuff on the walls.” 

“It’s probably some sort of Sunday school or Wednesday night church group they were running back in the day.” 

He picked up the pill bottle and looked at it closely, his eyes scanned the back then sat it down. 

“Sleep supplements?” Danny asked confused 

“Oh yeah no. Sol has really intense insomnia. One time he didn’t sleep for like a solid two weeks almost and Dave had to put him in the hospital about it.” Matt “something about how if you don’t sleep long enough your brain like starts eating itself. I thought you had meds for that.”

“I do but I don’t like taking them.” That didn’t land well. 

“You did bring them right?” Dave looking in the rearview 

“No-“

“Sol. We aren’t gonna have another round of you busting your ass for a two days straight then passing out for a day at a time. I’m not going to be there and Saul wants to keep his eyes on this job.”

Oh fun the co-owner of the company was gonna ‘help’ us. 

“Why didn’t you bring them?” Zeek confused 

I felt Danny’s eyes on me. He thought this was about him, that I didn’t trust him. 

“You know how some people sleep talk?” I offered to Danny mostly 

“Of course! Zeek sleep talks all the time!” Danny smiled finally  

“Hey Dave what happens when I fall asleep after I take ambien?” I asked loudly to which he busted up laughing immediately “no seriously.” 

“He sleep screams!” Dave wheezed slapping his hand on the wheel “and it’s always some weird shit! The last time it happened-! It must have been 3am, okay? I wake up to Sol screaming “the apples Dave! We have to get the apples!” And me, hearing Sol of all people yellin’ like this, I go “oh my god the fuckin apples!”. I got up, ran out of the RV, and then I realized I had no clue what he was talking about I go back in. This sonsabitch, he’s still asleep still screaming about apples because apparently in his dream I was giving him a hard time.” 

“I don’t think I’ve ever heard you scream” A confused Zeek 

“That’s the part that gets you! One time he did that shit with Matt and Matt sat right up from a dead sleep lookin at me like it was the end times!” Dave still laughing “that time it was about the laundry and he-“

“Completely dead asleep, screaming about laundry mind you, stops for a moment just enough time for Dave and I to wake up fully! And Sol just goes “whatdaya mean we aren’t having tacos?“. Dave about pissed himself because Sol is ya know Sol. He talks so soft and gentle. But the way he said-“

Dave repeated the line in a furious booming voice throwing a fist up frantically and shaking it, more than earning the fits he received from us. 

“When we get back I’m going over to Sol’s. I’ve got to hear this.” Zeek smiled at me.

That would never happen but I smiled all the same. Most of my dreams fell more in the night terror category. The same cyclical loop of the 4 years I spent in orgen as a part of what was now legally branded as a satanic cult. Sure we did rituals, there was always something about demonology going on in the ‘temple’ but the real horrors were how we got treated. 

It was a hive mind. My group just north of Portland was mostly grifters and scam artists pulling in money for the priest and priestess. I had done all sorts of things but my claim had been being a crystal healer. For a long time I believed it. I believed I could actually help people like that and I had contractually traded my birth name for wisdom through the priests power. They just wanted to strip me of my identity and make sure I felt special enough not to leave. 

I walked that same familiar route in my head, back through the woods of the west coast and along the mountains of California. The nights we’d spent out under the stars dancing naked under the stars, falling in each other’s arms, committing unspeakable acts we claimed but more importantly believed was magic. I had grown my hair well past my collar bones that summer and when I spoke out against them that fall they shaved my head down to nothing. It was all they had left to take. 

“Sol. Come on.” Danny nodding as he got up. 

I’d missed us getting back but seeing Saul talking with a woman on the porch snapped me right back to the moment. If I had known what I’d see when I got off the RV I would have stayed in Lowell playing it up in the hospital. 

Since you guys were so helpful last time I’ve gotta ask for help again. 

How do you get her a severe fear? 

Real fast. 

The sort of fear that stole the air from your lungs and thoughts from your head, the kind of fear where your thoughts sort of leaves your body and all you have left is that primitive survival reaction. The chimp like urge to bear your teeth and scream at the thing before you. The thousands of years of evolution washed away into a tender morsel of ‘but what if I throw a rock like really hard at it?’. 

All I’m saying is I really fucking hate horses. We’d had them back in the commune and since then every time I saw one of those big glass cannons of darwinistic failure it made me lose my ability to function. They triggered my fight response but even in this negative pressure space I knew that they’d win. 

This one just looked wrong. Like the bones in its face were drawn wrong, and its skin pulled to tight across those mistaken lines. The things fur? Do horses have fur? It’s hair, right? 

“Shit!” Dave pulling me back.

Instinctively I lurched forward and got in front of Danny pushing him back to Dave.

“What’s going on?” Zeek asked coming over. I grabbed Matt’s arm and yanked him to cover Danny’s other flank “Sol. It’s fine it’s just a horse.” 

“He’s petrified of them.” Saul laughed “how’s Danny, Dave?” 

“He’s hanging in there so he’s doing some of the busy work for us today.” Dave 

“Good, good.” Saul nodded slapping Danny’s arm approvingly 

“Is that an Arabian?” Matt asked the man approaching us

“That he is. Rescued from slaughter. Gelding unfortunately for us. Not only that he’s a wet match in a dark cave. Stupidest horse I’ve ever met.” The man sighed “he’s harmless.” 

“Tell that to the one who bit my pinky off.” I deadpanned showing my left hand with its faded pink scars. “Because it felt like it.” 

“Well they put it back on.” He offered taking my hand. 

His hands were too warm almost hot, and rough. My whole fist fit in the palm of his hand and he was a good two inches taller than Matt. The horse turned its face to me and looked right into my soul. 

*part of you died in order to survive* 

The fear and lack of sleep were really nagging at the back of my skull. Horses can’t talk and even if they could their voices wouldn’t sound the way chalk feels when you write with it, like little fragments of it were left behind where it made contact. 

*something may have grown in its place but you will never be the same*

“So.” The man’s voice, satin compared to the one in my head “Solomon. You’re the project manager?” 

I felt the crews eyes on me. Dave had never called me my government name in front of them before. Saul must have used it. 

“Yes. We need to change the plan a little, we need to focus on the base level of the house and call animal control so they can lay traps for the racoon.” I offered confidently, despite the horse closing in on us. 

“Nikao!” A second man called harshly before whistling. It looked at us for along while before he whistled again. “C’mon Nikao!” 

He leaned right over me and got right up next to Danny, sniffing him. I could feel the muscles in its neck shift and roll as it inhaled the odor of blood deeply, just inches from either of our faces. I had to fight the urge to punch it despite its hooves being close enough to crack my skull. It began retreating rapidly, looking almost horrified, when the man looked at it. Just looked at it. 

“You weren’t joking. You and Ash are identical.” Saul laughed 

“Mhm.” The man with us Saul was refusing to introduce apparently “he stays on the ranch. You’ll see him more than me, if y’all run into anymore problems go find him down by the pasture.” 

“We need to discuss what happened earlier. This house is in worse shape than you let on and it’s already injured one of my crew.” A firm tone from Dave 

“I discussed this all with your co-owner already. He was very clear that this kind of thing is a breech of contract but I negotiated with him and made a new one, much higher pay and a little more time.” The man simply and unwavering “if you ask me it up to the crew to decide. They’re doing the work.” 

“I agree. He raised the 60k to 80 and they’ll cover the roll offs and pest control.” Saul was clearly pleased with the offer. 

That was almost 20k for each person, easy. Saul, Dave and I would split my share if they agreed. I had no doubt they would. 

“Well I’ll let you all get to work then.” His teeth were so white and straight when he smiled speaking to us I knew they had to be implants. They were too perfect to be his natural ones.

Dave and Saul stood on the porch bickering quietly at one another as we entered. There was a new awkwardness as we suited back up, no one wanted to bring up the use of my full legal name but they all seemed confused as to why I didn’t use it. 

How could I tell them between being born and raised in a jewish family having a birth and Hebrew name, my lack of identity in the cult, and changing my full identity to exist free of both of my pasts now I had chosen something simple yet ironic. A subtle joking nod to myself. None of them had ever truly defined me for long enough to feel mine. 

“So why Sol?” Zeek asked as we settled in the living room 

“Yeah. I would have gone with Monty, like Monty Python.” Danny laughed 

“Solomon” Matt said the name to the air more than me 

“Matthew.” I nodded curtly to him handing the awkwardness right back “I wish I could say I was deep but mostly Sol just means shit out of luck.” 

Everyone settled into their post keeping an eye out for any major movement, finally really getting into the swing of the job like we normally did. I could hear Matt and Zeek chatting but not what about, Danny seemed to be adding to the conversation at points or maybe they were just checking in on him. Either way they all sounded happy.

It took a solid twenty minutes of just grabbing stuff and putting it in the 30 gallon trash bags just to get a wide enough section of the bedroom floor to evaluate it. The wooden boards looked clearly warped but the scent wasn’t that of raw sewage. 

It was… sweet. Bitter sweet. Like rotting fruit but the tinge of yeastiness made me thinks of moonshine or hooch. The way the still sheds on the commune smelt in the high heat of autumn. I went against my better judgement and got on all fours. My nose just a foot above floor there was a metal hint. Like it had seeped into the very base board, into the 6 inch nails and rusted them out. 

Had of the twins had been making alcohol in this room? I wouldn’t doubt it. I turned my head to look under the bed and saw a shoe box with a small hole into it. They had probably been smart enough to burp the container but it had fallen over. 

“What’s going on in here?” Dave asked I waved him over smiling I explained my theory as he kneeled next to me. 

That’s when I saw the little face in the hole. A mouse. Dave hissed seeing it too. We both knew it was dead, had been for a while. Maybe it had been a pet. Hell I had kept the medical leeches they’d used in my fingers for 7 years before they passed of natural causes. 

Pulling it from its spot, I almost didn’t want to open it. It felt intimate in a wrong way, like I was glimpsing into some teenage boys lonely years. The small haven he allowed himself in his darkest hours. When I did that boy didn’t seem so innocent. 

Dave bolted for the door. I shoved the box back under the bed and then went after him. The twin we’d talked to stood in the door hand on Saul’s shoulder smiling that fake toothed grin. I heard the sound of dry heaving right in front of me, as Dave struggled with his respirator, eyes wide with panic. The whites above gold flecked earthy soil just like hers. I instinctively looked up to where she’d been and the sound of vomitting echoed in the now soundless space. 

Mice conjoined by the tail in a shoe box with scraps of food either meant it was a pet rat king or an act of conservation. I grabbed some paper towels from Matt who looked for once genuinely spooked. Dave was shaking, which was unusual. We’d seen dead people. 

But how does one get over some sort of instinctive fear? How does one go against what their brain says is naturally wrong to the conscious?
