I (24M) graduated college in May of 2025 and immediately moved from Minnesota to sunny Southern California. I studied computer science in undergrad, which was my first and most egregious mistake in this whole ordeal, and I hoped that the west coast would have more promising job prospects. My sister, Maddie (28F), had already been living there for a few years, so I had a built-in tour guide to help me navigate a brand new city. I found a cheap apartment on Craigslist (which was probably my second mistake) and moved my few possessions across the county in June. 



The five-story apartment building was unremarkable. It was in a part of the city that was quiet but not desolate; the hallways always smelled like weed but were fairly clean; and the building’s eclectic mix of residents were generally welcoming, but not particularly interested in conversation. Even my roommate, Johnson, the one who had posted the advertisement, was pretty nondescript—a balding forty-something with a friendly but awkward demeanor. He was almost never around, which I sure didn't mind. When we crossed paths, it was usually in the evenings, when I'd be coming home from the gym and he'd be leaving for what I assumed was an overnight shift. 



Maddie helped me move my few possessions into the apartment. Despite how entirely uninteresting I found the building, her first words upon stepping inside were: "This place is giving me bad vibes." I brushed it off. No disrespect to my sister, but she and her best friend are full-time content creators who run a podcast about haunted houses. It's her job to be paranoid. 



My first few nights at the apartment were uneventful. I quickly settled into a routine: my mornings were dedicated to applications and interview prep; my afternoons were for gig work like dog walking and tutoring; and I'd end most days at the gym or exploring the city as best I could on a budget. One night, after going out with new friends, I got home later than usual—around two or three in the morning. I hadn't ordered much at the bar, so I was ravenous by the time I returned to the apartment. I got out a pot to boil water for noodles, and I set the thing down a little heavier than intended. It clattered against the stovetop, and I counted myself lucky that Johnson wasn't trying to sleep. 



A few seconds later, I was startled by a heavy *thud* right beneath my feet. I paused, ramen packet in hand, and listened as several more harsh knocks were planted on the ceiling of the apartment below me. Eventually, the noises subsided, and I finished my late night snack quietly but with no shortage of indignation. I hadn't been *that* loud. I hoped I hadn't gotten stuck with one of those uppity neighbors who got pissed off by every little sound. 



Unfortunately, that seemed to be exactly what had happened. About a week later, I again got home later than usual. I went straight to my room to change out of my clothes and dropped the hoodie I'd been wearing onto the floor. Before I even had the chance to put on a shirt, I heard a familiar *thud* from right beneath me. I remember looking down at the floor in disbelief. *A hoodie?* I thought. *Really?* 



I finished changing as my neighbor continued their knocking, then I headed toward the kitchen for dinner. The sounds from below did not stop. In fact, as I walked down the dark hallway of my apartment, the knocks followed me. They aligned so perfectly with my steps that they were like thunderous footsteps. My downstairs neighbor was following me somehow, and they didn't stop until I reached the kitchen and took a seat on the counter just to get my feet off of the ground. The sounds stopped after that, and I was left as confused as I was freaked out. I'm not a particularly heavy guy, and in socks, my footsteps hardly made a sound on the wooden floor. I had no idea how my neighbor heard my hoodie, or how they had tracked my steps so perfectly. 



Although the rest of the night passed without incident, I continued to hear knocking every few nights. My neighbor's responsiveness was varied; sometimes I could go about my nightly routine without incident, and sometimes even the faintest sound would signal the start of drum practice on the ceiling below me. I figured that I'd just gotten stuck with some asshole with really good hearing, but even so, the swiftness and accuracy of the knocks began to disturb me. When I heard those *thuds* in the middle of the night, I started to feel like I was being watched. 



After about a month of this, I did what I should've done far sooner: I went down to the floor beneath me and knocked on my downstairs neighbor's door, hoping to talk things out with them. When no one answered, I tried again a few days later. After these two attempts, I slipped a note under their door, asking if we could meet up to chat about the noise situation. I think I did an alright job of being firm but not confrontational, but I still didn't receive a response. 



On one sweltering night in mid-August, I was laying on the couch in the living room area, halfway through a great book. It was just past midnight, and like most nights, I was alone in the apartment. I was being as quiet as a goddamn mouse, sitting there with my book, not listening to music or anything. And yet out of nowhere, I began to hear noises from below—sounds placed firmly and fervently against the ceiling of my neighbor's apartment. Only this time, instead of knocks, it was the telltale sound of scratching. 



At first, I didn't understand where the sound was coming from. It was fainter and more sporadic than the *thuds* to which I had grown accustomed. I thought the sound was coming from next to me, perhaps from some poor animal that had gotten trapped inside the wall somehow. It didn't sound like a broom or some other object: it sounded distinctly like two paws (or, I guess, two hands) burrowing in quick, uncontrolled bursts. When I realized that it was coming from directly below me, I set down my book and headed toward my front door. The sounds followed me to the threshold of my apartment, but no further. I took the dimly lit stairs down a floor and planted myself in front of the neighbor's apartment, banging my fists against their door and yelling for them to come out. I didn't care who else I woke up. I imagined my neighbor scratching against their ceiling and felt a pit form in my stomach. How did they get up there, anyway? 



I was knocking for a solid two minutes before I heard a door open behind me. I turned around to see someone's meemaw standing in the doorway of the apartment across the hall, dressed in a nightgown and looking at me with murder in her eye. 



"What in the world are you doing?" 



"I'm sorry I woke you, ma'am, but *this,*"—I pointed behind me—"a-hole won't stop banging on his ceiling when I make the tiniest little noise. Hell, even when I *don't* make a sound, he's still knocking and scratching on the ceiling." 



The woman gave me an odd look as I continued.



"And yes, I've tried catching them at a more convenient time. I even left a note. I only came down here this time 'cause I was trying to enjoy my book, not making a sound, and he starts scratching against my floor so loud I thought there was a rat in my walls." 



The woman narrowed her eyes. 



"I think you're confused, young man. That apartment has been vacant for two years." 



Well, after that unpleasant epiphany, I spent a few more minutes talking to the old woman, trying to convince her I wasn't completely out of my mind. I knew I had the right apartment, so I was left with three possibilities to mull over as I made my way back to my floor. 



One: the old woman was lying. What motivation could she have to do so? No clue, but it seemed within the realm of possibility that she'd protect her neighbor from an angry stranger. 



Two: the sounds were coming from somewhere else and only *seemed* to be emanating from the apartment below me. This struck me as pretty unlikely, but who could say? The apartment building was fairly old, and maybe the knocks were the result of some weird acoustics thing that I was too dumb to understand. 



Three: there was an animal trapped in the empty apartment. That seemed, by far, the most reasonable explanation, and I was annoyed that I hadn't thought of it sooner. The following day, I visited the Building Management office first thing in the morning. I explained the situation to the women at the front desk and they confirmed that the apartment directly beneath me was vacant. They also promised me, unconvincingly, that they'd send someone up to look. Honestly, I didn't really care if they stayed true to their word. The important thing, in my mind, was that I now had an explanation for the sounds. 



In the following days, I was still hearing strange sounds at night, but I brushed them off far more easily than before. I made the mistake of mentioning the situation to Maddie, who immediately offered up possibility number four, which was—you guessed it—that the apartment beneath me was haunted. She said that she would look into the history of my apartment in more depth, particularly if there were any deaths in the building. I told her not to put me on her stupid podcast. She said no promises. 



I was doing well, for a while. The nighttime knocking and scratching, now easy to explain away, faded into background noise, and coming home in the dark to an empty apartment got less foreboding. However, several weeks after I first heard the scratching, the noises had still not gone away. If anything, they grew more frequent, and my hypothesis about a trapped animal, initially so sound, started to tear at the seams. I paid another visit to Building Management. They told me that not only was there no animal in the vacant apartment, but they had recently paid an exterminator for an inspection, and the building was decidedly pest-free. 



On one particularly hot night in September, I was laying in bed when I was suddenly pulled from the verge of sleep. There was that scratching again. I pressed my fists against my eyelids in frustration. I knew it wasn't my downstairs neighbor. I didn't even *have* a downstairs neighbor. And still, my mind's eye conjured up the image of an old man, unnaturally tall and reedy, lying in wait in the darkness below me. I imagined him reaching up, up toward the ceiling, his gnarled fingers capped by thick yellow nails, burrowing into the drywall, digging closer and closer to me. 



I removed my hands from my eyes, trying to blink away the image, when all of a sudden, the sound seemed to *jump*. No longer was it originating from the room below me. Instead, I swear, the scratches were being laid not against the downstairs ceiling, but against the slats of my bed. 



I leapt off the mattress and ran toward my bedroom door. Slamming it shut behind me, I hurried into the kitchen, where I was surprised to see Johnson standing in front of the fridge. When he heard me, he looked over in mild interest, asking what got me so worked up. I realized then that, despite living together for months, I had never told my roommate about the strange noises. I took the opportunity to amend that—telling him everything I'd heard since moving in. At first, he seemed amused, but the longer I went on, the more serious his demeanor became. By the end of my account, he was looking at me with an expression I couldn't quite place. Concern? Judgement? He denied having heard any knocking or scratching in all the years he'd lived there, let alone in the months since I moved in. 



I fell asleep on the living room couch that night, wondering for the first time if there was something wrong with me. The sounds continued throughout the night, but never again did they reach the volume of the ones from directly beneath my bed. 



I talked to my sister a lot more after that incident, even spending the next night at her townhouse. She didn't talk much about my apartment, but she did mention that, as far as she could tell, no one had died in the building. Her research hadn't turned up anything out of the ordinary, and I couldn't decide if that gave me comfort or not. I didn't want to consider the fact that there was truly nothing wrong with the building or its residents, because that meant that the problem lay solely with me. Maddie hesitantly asked if she and her cohost could stay at mine for a night just to see if they could hear what I had heard. A few months ago, I would've vehemently refused, but I was so hopeful that someone else would hear the knocks that I told Maddie I'd think about it. I promised her that I'd ask my roommate and see what we could figure out. 



The next night, I slept on the couch of the apartment again. It was a little after midnight when I accidentally dozed off. I was awoken by a vibration a few hours later. Sitting up, I fished my phone out of the blankets and realized that I'd forgotten to plug it in for the night. The notification was a text from my sister, sending me a link to some article, probably about some bs ghost story. I turned the phone off with a sigh. 



Before I could get up to find my charger, I glanced up to the middle of the room and was surprised to see a figure standing there, not five feet away from the couch. I went still for a minute, squinting, before I made out the shape of my roommate. At first, I was relieved to be looking at Johnson and not some burglar, but I soon realized just how bizarre the situation was. Why was he hovering over me in the dark, and how long had he been standing there, staring? 



Eventually, I broke the silence by calling out his name. 



"Everything good, man?" I asked, and after a heavy pause, I saw him nodding his head. 



"Yeah," he said. "Yeah." And that was all—no further explanation. He turned around and walked into his room, closing the door, but not shutting it all the way. I got off the couch and made my way into my own bedroom. I locked the door behind me. 



Four days later, I realized that Johnson was gone. It took me a while to notice since we crossed paths so infrequently, but when I knocked on his door with a question about our water bill, I found his door unlocked and his bedroom completely cleaned out. No note, but also no signs of a struggle or a sudden departure. Johnson had packed thoroughly and left the room spotless, cleaning like his security deposit depended on it. Since he left without any heads up, I assumed he wasn't coming back and told the Building Management ladies as much. They said I could continue renting the apartment at half-rate for two months while I looked for a new roommate—a gesture I found both kind and very typical of the management's laissez-faire approach.



I spent a week alone in that apartment after Johnson left. He had not turned in his keys, and I sometimes worried that I would awake in the middle of the night and find him standing in my room. Despite my fears, I never saw the guy again. Not only that, but he moved out, I never heard any strange sounds from the apartment beneath us again. Wherever Joshnson had gone, and for whatever purpose, it seemed like he had taken the strange noises with him. 



On the Saturday after my roommate's abrupt departure, there came a set of knocks against, for once, my apartment's front door. When I opened it, I was greeted by the sight of three police officers, who asked to come inside and ask me a few questions about my roommate. My first thought was that Johnson actually had gone missing, and, feeling guilty that I had brushed off his disappearance so casually, I eagerly welcomed the cops inside. They poked around the apartment as they questioned me, revealing the truth little by little. 



Johnson wasn't missing. Johnson, as it turned out, never existed. The man I had been living with for months was a fugitive living under a fake name, wanted by police for charges including sexual assault, domestic abuse, and first degree murder. The cops seemed reluctant to give me many details, but eventually, I was able to weasel my former roommate's full name out of them. I texted it to Maddie immediately, grateful, for once, for her sleuthing skills. She called me an hour after the police left, her voice thin and shaking as she told me about "Johnson's" ex wife, whom he murdered by nailing her into a crate and burying her alive.
