I hate customers, especially the dead ones. Theres a reason Im a cook and not a waitress. I walk out into the dining room to get my 3 am. coffee. I immediately feel a chill down my spine.

He's sitting at the bar, staring at me. This would be unsettling at the best of times, but our valued customer is translucent. There is a horrifying stream of blood pouring from his lips. He's here every night.

Sullivan’s diner is a paranormal hotspot, or we have a full staff of mentally ill employees with shared delusions. Either way, I'm to broke to quit. I finish pouring my coffee and stumble over myself to get back in the kitchen.

I've worked at Sullivan's for five years; you survive by adapting fast to whatever weird situation pops up. It's been pretty lax since Ted bought this place, right before I started. Before Ted, the old owner was clueless. He didn't know the importance of keeping the supernatural happy. It took the towns plumbing company a good two weeks of work to unclog his remains from the pipes.

"You look like you've seen a ghost, Ivy." Say's Ted with a grin. 

He owns this place. The dead don't bother him as long as they pay with worldly money.

"You're an asshole."
"Who was it?"
"Bloody mouthed Randy."
"Fucking gross man."

Normal customers can't see them. The dead only appear when the restaurant is empty and quickly vanish when a normie walks in. They are also the bulk of our nighttime clientele.

If we want to keep Sullivan's Diner in good standing with the dead, we have to serve them. Bad things happen when the customers aren't satisfied, very bad things.

"Randy wants another egg. The first one is too runny." Says Joann, she looks a little nervous.

Joann has been here a year, she's our longest employed waitress. Longest surviving waitress works too. Customer service is brutal. The things people do for a little over minimum wage, or to pay off a contract with a demon. Whatever unfortunate circumstances brought us here, we can’t leave until something external deems our time to be up.

The night shift consists of Ted, me, Joann and our dishwasher, Frank. You have to have something a little wrong with you to hold this job, but I guess that's why I'm here.

Ted sighs and drops another egg on the grill. I don't see why Randy cares so much, he doesn’t even eat them.

Joann take hes eggs out front again. The sound of a plate aggressively smashing on the floor comes from out front and we hear Joann scream.

"Fuck." Mutters Ted and we both rush out into the dining room.

Eggs and broken ceramic cover the floor. Bloody mouthed Randy has corned Joann and I can hear him gargle something into her ear.

"Eggs... he'd like more eggs, not runny." Her eyes are wide with fear. Ted rushes back into the kitchen to make them again. The customer is always right I guess.

Frank pops his head out to see what all the commotion is about. I can see him shake his head and mutter something about at least he doesn’t have to wash the plate. He disappears again a second later.

It's been months since something like this happened, and Randy is usually a very laid-back dead guy. Me and Joann exchange helpless glances as we wait for Ted to come back with the eggs. I have to break my gaze and turn away, so Randy doesn’t see the look of absolute disgust at his appearance. Yet another reason I’d make a terrible waitress.

Ted comes back and slams a plate on the counter. The ghosts are known to be docile and harmless as long as they get what they want, a hot plate of food, and some decent service.

"Randy, back off." Ted's voice is low.

Randy turns back to the counter and sits. He inspects the eggs. "Good." He gurgles, blood dribbles out of his mouth and down his throat.

Joann composes herself, tucking loose strands of red hair back into her messy bun. She starts a fresh pot of coffee and me and Ted head back to the kitchen.

"Freak." I mutter. 
"Valued. Customer." Corrects Ted sarcastically.

I can see Randy through the window in the kitchen door. He is just staring blankly at his eggs, and he will do so until he is satisfied. Eventually he will disappear, leaving a plate of cold eggs, a ten-dollar bill, and a lukewarm warm cup of coffee behind. At least he tips.

It’s been a pretty slow night all things considered. Ted remedies this by making me and Frank scrub down and polish every stainless-steel surface in sight. The place is cleaner than a retired addict's spoon by the time we’re done with it.

Our next regular walks in, an old woman named Hilda. She must have died in a peaceful way, she is not covered in the obvious injuries many of our otherworldly customers have. You can usually tell, but most ghosts aren’t happy when you ask. I know enough to know that only restless souls who never found peace after their death frequent here.

Her appearance is welcomed warmly as a change in energy. Hilda orders her usual, a corn muffin, extra hot. She sits in her booth and mimes sipping a cup of green tea.

She looks usually chatters away with Joann. I’m sure she mainly comes for the conversation. A lonely old woman, almost like every other daytime customer, but dead. They can move objects, but don’t consume them. I’ve never figured out how ghost physics work. 

Tonight is different though, the front of house is quiet, and I catch a glimpse of Joann unnecessarily dusting. I guess Hilda wasn’t in the mood to talk, that’s the first I’ve ever seen. 

I’m pretty sure her spirit lingers around waiting for her husband Jerry to die. I catch him sometimes early in the morning as I’m leaving. The old bastard hobbles in here two or three times a week at 5am. for a black coffee and a plain pancake. We don’t talk about the spirits but it’s almost as if he knows she’s here, the two always pick the same booth in the corner by the window. Old habits take longer to die than people I guess. I venture out into the dining room again to top up my coffee.

“Hello Hilda, how are you?” She doesn’t even look up; she just stares almost angrily at her muffin. Joann gives me a glance and I turn to head back into the kitchen.

“Not hot enough.” Comes as raspy voice from Hilda’s booth in the corner.

“Let me fix that for you.” I say and take the muffin off of her table. It is quite literally steaming but I’m not willing to risk another Randy incident.

“Another one?” Asks Ted as he watches me microwave the muffin an excessive amount. The damn thing will explode if I heat it up anymore.

“Yeah, Hilda.”
“This isn’t good, something’s up.” Ted says almost to himself.
“Don’t break this plate I don’t feel like taking out sharp trash.” Says Frank. Me and Ted give him a look.

I take the muffin back out to her table and Hilda doesn’t even look up again.

“Not hot enough.”
“Hilda it’s very hot I promise you.”

Hilda reaches out, head still down and grabs my wrist with a translucent hand. I feel cold wrap around me and loose my breath. I haven’t had one touch me in years, the feeling is absolutely horrible. Death comes a little too close. Again, I could never be a waitress.

I drop the plate on the floor and Hilda abruptly let's go. I feel the warmth of my own blood rush back into my wrist.

“I want… a hot… corn muffin...” She says it almost in a whisper. 

Ted comes bursting out of the kitchen holding another plate, it’s so hot he’s wearing an oven mitt. This plate  has an almost black muffin on it, steam is swirling up into Ted’s face fogging his glasses.

“I’m so sorry about that Hilda, here you go. Girls get into the back, now.”

Hilda slowly nods in approval and me and Joann hurry out of the dining room.

“What the fuck Ted?” Asks Joann.
“Yeah, what the fuck?” I rub at my sore wrist, what looks like a mild case of frostbite has appeared in finger forum.
“Yeah, what the fuck?” Chimes in Frank.

“I don’t know exactly what’s going on but it’s not good. We need to keep the customers happy, just stick it out until sunrise and I’ll try to see what’s happening. You know how important this is.” Ted looks instantly exhausted, like he’s been up for days. I can see the worry lines forming quickly in his face.

“I’m not going back out there.” Says Joann.
“Customer service Joann.”
“I don’t care Ted I’ve had enough for tonight please don’t make me go back out there.”
“Then you’re putting us all in danger. Don’t make me send you home early.” Ted’s voice is stern. Joann eyes widen at the threat.

Getting sent home early when you work at Sullivan’s almost certainly means you don’t be coming back, at least in one piece. I stay quiet, she knew the risk when she started working here. You simply can’t bail mid shift, it would put the whole town in danger.

We are just as, if not more important that the police when it comes to keeping the community safe. We work in the background, but if we weren’t here the town of Lastdale would crumble from the inside out. There’s more going on here than anyone fully understands.

“Yes Ted, I’m sorry.” She looks as the floor, tears welling in her eyes and hurry’s back to the front.

I do feel bad, I don’t think she’s ever worked a day like this before and the first time the regulars turn on you is bound to make anyone scared.

“We’re two plates short boss, I need them in the morning.” Ted barely nods in acknowledgement at Frank.

The diner has to stay fully stocked, we can’t risk running out of anything. We have to be overly cautious so even two broken plates will quickly be replaced. As long as we’re running smoothly, the spirits have less of a reason to become aggressive.

The rest of the night goes by quietly. We serve a few of the usual drunks, some truckers, but no more supernatural guests. I can’t shake the feeling that something bigger is off. Our regulars are almost never aggressive. Anyone worth their salt knows the ghosts respond to things going on behind the scenes. I’ll see what I can find out tomorrow, I might even have to speak to a customer or two.
