I waited some days for Mrs. Stratton to get back to me, and that was all it took for everything to go to hell. I would email and ask her for an update, and she'd tell me she hadn't forgotten me, she just had many other cases of people wanting to leave the program and the Brighter Days agency was currently understaffed. She said she expected to follow up with me in a couple days at most. I was comforted by this for the most part, and decided not to take any injections since, one, I figured I'd be gone before Sunday when they started testing people, and two, having strike number two when I was moving soon wouldn't get me arrested. 

I tried to grin and bear it (no pun intended) in the meantime, but the news got more and more concerning. Sandra and I were watching the TV at my house during the evening, sipping wine. Her kids were being watched by her new boyfriend so we could have some girl time. The local newswoman was wearing a smiling mask as she announced, “There have been reports of strange side effects from the new upgrade of the Smile Serum.” 

“Upgrade?” I questioned.

“Oh right, you haven't been taking the last few ones,” Sandra replied, “apparently they made it ‘more effective’ to combat the ‘rise of high tensions’ in town during the Scowler riots.” She rolled her eyes. 

“Residents have claimed that the injections have caused extreme cases of hysteria and mania among men, women, and children alike.” The newswoman explained. “Some have even said that it evokes violent reactions and aggressions in those exhibiting these side effects, and the Council has released a statement claiming that they have their best scientists working on it and to report any hostile people to your nearest Sentinel Station.” 

“Jesus Christ, they've been giving my girls that.” Sandra groaned. “That's it, we have to leave. I just wanted a safe future for my kids and these people are taking it all away. Ben has some money stashed in the bank, and he's been trying to talk me into leaving but I was too stubborn, I guess.” 

“You're gonna get in touch with your caseworker?” I asked. 

“Fuck that, we might just pack up and leave overnight.” She shook her head, taking her phone out her bra as it started to ring. “One sec, Cin-I mean, Madison. What's up, honey?” 

I watched with growing concern as I could hear faint yelling from the phone's speakers. Sandra frowned, and I could see her worry increase every second of the call, “S-slow down, Aubrey. What happened to Ashley? …Well, where's Ben? He what?” I tensed up as Sandra stood up in a panic. “Baby, calm down, remember that number I put on the fridge? I want you to call it as soon as I hang up and then hide, mommy's just down the street and she's on her way, okay?” She hung up the phone and rushed to put on her jacket. “Oh God, Oh God!” 

“What's going on?!” I demanded as I stood up and put my glass of wine down. 

“My family's in danger, I have to go!” Sandra refused to elaborate and left. I followed her outside, watching her get in her car and drive off in confusion. Suddenly, before she could even make it out of the block, another car came crashing into her at full speed. The sound of metal bending and glass breaking filled the air. 

I screamed and ran over. Sandra seemed fine if not a little dazed, so I went to the driver of the other car, fuming. “Watch where you're going!” I shouted as I walked over. I stopped dead in my tracks when the sight of the man's wild eyes behind his smiling mask registered. He did not look like he was playing with a full deck, whatsoever. 

“Where's your smile, honey?” The man asked cheerfully as he grabbed a hammer from the passenger seat and got out of the car. 

“Madison, get in right now!” Sandra yelled at me in a panic. She didn't need to tell me twice. I scrambled into the passenger side and she started to back the car up. The man marched over to my side and raised his hammer, bashing my window with it and laughing maniacally. 

“What's the matter, sweetheart?” The man asked sweetly as I cried out in shock. I watched him get smaller in the distance as Sandra hit the gas pedal. “Where's your smile?!” He called out after us. 

“We have to get to my place right fucking now!” Sandra said as we sped through the neighborhood. 

“Are your kids okay?!” I watched people run out of their homes in a panic as I asked this, and I wondered just how big of a problem this upgrade for the serum was. 

Sandra started to laugh. “If not, I'll just tickle their bellies and kiss them on their beautiful, shiny faces.” 

“Huh?” I looked at her sideways, puzzled at the change of tone. Sandra grinned at me, and the car swerved as she allowed herself to stop looking at the road ahead of us for an extended period of time. I seized the steering wheel and straightened our path. “Watch the road, Jesus!” 

“Oh, I love you, Madison.” She leaned over and planted a sloppy wet kiss on my cheek. She stopped driving and dragged me into a tight, uncomfortable hug. I didn't know how to react, I simply froze. What was wrong with her? 

“Diane, your kids…” I muttered, stroking her hair softly as I thought she was perhaps having a breakdown.

“Tickle their bellies.” She murmured as if in a stupor, her lips close to my ear. “Tickle their insides, tickle their intestines and kill their woes, make them vomit their worries from their mouths to their toes.”

“Get off!” I pushed her away just as puke started to waterfall out of her mouth. Still, she smiled, her pupils dilated and her eyes opened wider than I thought possible, staring directly into mine. 

“Smile, Madison.” She urged, sticking her fingers into my mouth to force my lips to curl upward. I slapped her hands off my face and got out of the car, a terrible feeling in my stomach. I backed away from the car, back towards my house, my eyes never leaving hers. She laughed as she watched me, and grabbed her steering wheel again, turning her car around to face me. 

“What are you doing?” I asked in horror. 

“We're playing Tag, and I'm it..” Sandra giggled like a little girl, flashing her headlights at me. She honked the horn. “Beep beep! I'm gonna give you a headstart now, Madison. Beep beep! You only have a few more beeps until I try to tag you with my car! Beep beep!” 

“Somebody help me!” I screamed as I turned around and ran down the sidewalk, glancing over my shoulder to see the car follow me at a slow and steady pace with Sandra laughing all the while. I didn't have my phone with me and no one was outside.

Then came the final, childlike “Beep beep!” from Sandra. 

Suddenly, I heard the engine rev and tires squealing as Sandra’s car tore across the tarmac towards me. Thinking fast, I climbed over someone's picket fence. I wasn't the strongest or fastest woman out there, so it took more effort and time than I would've liked, with the hood of my friend's vehicle speeding towards my frail body. I finally landed in the backyard, but just as my ass hit the ground, the fence beside me exploded into wood chunks as Sandra's car came hurtling through it. 

I cursed as I pushed myself to my feet and ran around the side of that person's house. When I got to their front yard, I saw one of the most disturbing things in my entire life. 

First, I saw two teenage boys with forced, creepy grins on their faces and buggy eyes. They looked like they were about to play basketball in the driveway, where a basketball net stood near to the garage. I thought they were gonna act shocked after hearing a car break down their fence, but instead, one of the boys pointed and happily asked, “Hey, can you throw us the ball?” 

My gaze followed the direction in which he was pointing, settling on an object lying in the grass that was roughly the size of a ball but definitely wasn't one. 

It was the severed head of a man, his eyes staring into nothingness. He looked middle aged, with dark brown hair and a similar nose to one of the boy's. Clearly the father, but unfortunately the father of his killer. 

However, none of this was on my mind until later, at that very moment in time my mind went blank and I screamed so shrilly my throat felt like it would tear. No sooner than I did, Sandra's car came driving through the space between the right side of the house and the picket fence separating it from the adjacent house. She was still laughing, and she ran me over before I could even think to run. 

Thankfully for me, her speed had slowed, driving over ground, and I didn't suffer any extreme injuries. I rolled over the hood of her car and fell off the side, my legs bruised from the impact. I groaned and tried to crawl away. 

Sandra got out of the car and dropped to the ground on all fours. “Are we pretending to be animals?” She asked gleefully, before barking, yes, barking and panting like a dog would, crawling in circles around me. 

“The injections are making you crazy,” I tried to reason with her as I backed away, “please stop trying to hurt me and think about your family.” 

At some point, the boy with the brown hair had snuck up on me, and was standing over me. “I twisted my dad's head off with just my hands!” He boasted, like he was bragging about good grades. He looked at his bloody hands with a smile, then at me. “You wanna see me do it again?” 

He then grabbed Sandra, who didn't even seem afraid, just kept barking and panting and even growling on occasion. I watched, my jaw hanging open, as he broke her neck with all his strength. Then, once her eyes glazed over, he started to twist and turn her head with great force, until you could hear bones cracking and meat starting to tear. I finally found the strength to get up and run just before I heard the disgusting sound of flesh ripping from flesh as he tore my friend's head off her neck.

I ran back towards home, not stopping for anything. While I did, I heard screams,  laughter, shouts, and the wailing sirens of Smile Sentinel cruisers erupting all around me. This was a much bigger problem than I had originally thought, and once I made it inside, I slammed and locked the door behind me. I ran about, turning off lights to make it seem like I wasn't home, and picked up my remote to turn off the TV. Just before the screen went black, I saw the newswoman losing her mind, vomit leaking from inside her mask and her shoulders bouncing as she cackled. 

Oh, fuck, what do I do?! 

I tried calling Mrs. Stratton over and over again, but it went straight to voicemail each time. Finally, I texted her and told her that I was leaving town early due to everything that's going on. Strangely enough, she read my text immediately, and called me. 

“Do NOT under any circumstances try to leave town, Madison.” Mrs. Stratton sounded serious as the plague. 

“Do you know what's happening here?!” I couldn't believe what I was hearing, honestly. 

“Please rest assured that our council has it under control.” She replied sternly. “This will all blow over in a day or two, and then we can proceed with your withdrawal from the program shortly afterwards. But you absolutely cannot leave Smilesville without officially dropping out of the agency, there are papers you must sign and things you must be told before you move.” 

“Look, I can come back to town to sign your bullshit papers or whatever or you can even meet me outside of town.” I snapped. “But I just watched a teenage boy rip my friend's head off her shoulders right after she tried to run me over with her car, and I'm not fucking staying here another goddamn minute! You people told us we'd be safe here! You're all psychos!” 

“Madison, I need you to tell me you won't try to leave town without being escorted out by me or another agent of the company.” Mrs. Stratton said calmly. 

“Jesus Christ, she had kids.” A sob escaped my mouth. “Three little girls, and they sounded like they were in trouble. It sounded like her boyfriend had something to do with it. I wanna help, but I'm too scared to go look for them, and I don't know if the police made it there yet. I'm a coward, a goddamn coward.” 

“It's alright, Madison,” Mrs. Stratton's voice took on a softer tone, “just remain somewhere safe and I'm sure a Sentinel will be able to assist your friend's family.” 

“Oh yes, the psychos will save us from the psychos!” I yelled. “I'm getting the hell out of here, screw you and the agency!” 

“Madison if you do that I can't guarantee -” Click. I hung up on her, and immediately began packing my belongings. 

I laid my duffel bag on my bed and started tossing clothes into it. I sloppily packed my things, mostly that which could not be easily replaced, and tossed them in my car in the garage. Finally, I got behind the wheel and peeled out of my driveway, the GPS pulled up next to my steering wheel with a route leading out of town. On the way there, I saw carnage and chaos. Smile Sentinels and civilians in a bloody mess of writhing bodies and broken masks and blunt or sharp objects. A maddening cacophony of screams and laughter and crying washed over the streets, cars crashed into stores and traffic so catastrophic like the type you'd see in a zombie movie. I had to break more than a few driving laws to maneuver my way through flaming wrecks and unhinged drivers trying to make a game out of smearing people on the sidewalk. 

Finally, I was nearing the edge of town. I could feel anticipation build up in me. I was ready to feel safe, I was salivating at the thought of escape and freedom. The ‘Leaving Smilesville, going so soon? :(’ sign came into view just as soon as the towering blockage and armed Sentinels did. The wall looked like steel painted yellow and striped with black like a taxi, spanning in both directions as far as I could see. I've never been to the outskirts of Smilesville before, how long did it take for them to put this here? Other cars were here, and there were people already being accosted by our masked authorities for the crime of arguing against their own captivity. 

A Smile Sentinel spotted my vehicle and charged at me along with a few of his comrades, reaching for his waist where his shot was contained. He didn't even wait to see if I was going to do anything. Not wanting to end up like the cackling and convulsing people lying in front of the wall, I made a sharp but clumsy U-turn and tore out of there. I decided to try and exit from multiple other roads which led out of town, including the one I was driven in on. The same wall and terrifying visage of deranged eyes behind plastic masks and an angry mob just barely subdued by smile serum greeted me. Every. Single. Time. 

I was trapped. We were all trapped. How long had I simply been a rat in a cage? Drugged up and not even realizing the danger I was in? Why had no one told me a wall was being built? What the hell was going on? Is the government aware, is anyone outside here aware? 

I didn't want to return home after already having packed everything, especially not to that neighborhood of terrifying smile junkies, but I didn't know where else to go. So I thought, where would the least amount of people be? 

I found the cheapest, lowest rated motel on the smartphone app they had for the digital map of Smilesville, meant to replace Google Maps. Then, I drove straight there, witnessing pure chaos along the way, people breaking into businesses and homes wielding weapons like savages. I made sure to choose the one closest to the border of the town, too. When the government eventually (hopefully ) intervened and broke down that big yellow wall, I would be one of the first people out. I just had to bide my time. Seeing people break into houses only made me more confident in my decision, I don't know if they were simply killing or robbing or both but my nice house would be a big target and something told me a dirty rinky dink motel would be the perfect place to lay low.

When I got there, there were only a few cars in the parking lot, and the reception office was empty with no clerk in sight. I went behind the desk and stole a room key for a room in the back of the building on the second floor. I then grabbed a bunch of leftover free breakfast items off the table and stashed them in my pocketbook before going to my room. I was prepared to hole myself up for a long time. Once in the little motel room, the first thing I did was close the curtains and turn on the TV. All the channels showed nothing but static. I tried to tune into the local radio station on my phone but nothing was broadcasting. Then, I tried to call 911 rather than 811 which was for Sentinel Stations, but my phone service had been disconnected, not to mention the motel didn't even have Wi-Fi, and I suspected it was the same thing for the whole town. I just sat there on the dirty bed and cried myself to sleep, listening to distant yellow cruiser sirens. 

I woke up to the sound of someone knocking on my door. I crept silently to the peephole, holding the broken-off towel bar from the bathroom as a weapon. A man and woman wearing crude frowning masks were looking around nervously, as if afraid to be spotted. I felt the tension release in my shoulders at seeing what looked like two very sober Scowlers, but I remained warily silent.

“Look, we know you're in there,” the woman said, “we saw you pull up and we saw which key was missing in the office. It's alright, you can trust us.”

 “Who are you and what do you want?” I asked aggressively. 

“I'm Jenny, and this is Ryan.” The woman replied. “We can tell you're not hopped up on that piss yellow serum like the others. We wanted to offer you to hold out with us.” 

“And how would I be any safer with you two jokers?” I asked rudely. 

“Safety in numbers, for starters.” Ryan whispered this next bit.  “And, we may have a way out of town.”

I opened the door, but kept the chain lock on so it was only a crack. “How? They built a fucking wall around us. Even if we could climb it, one of those fake policemen would be on us in seconds.”  

“Look, I'm not talking out here where one of those smiling fuckers could be listening.” Jenny became impatient.  “Think about it, then stop by room B28, it's around the front so make sure you're not seen. We're leaving at sundown so don't take forever making up your mind.” 

With that, they left. I thought about it for a good long while. Anyone with masks seemed untrustworthy in my book, even if they were against the Smile law. What if Scowlers were their own type of evil? But then again, what else would I do? Just sit around and wait for things to resolve themselves? Would they resolve themselves? How would this community even get past something like this? No, I had to at least try. I was done with sitting around waiting for someone to save me, like the old battered and bruised Cindy Turner cowering under the shadow of her abusive partner. I decided right then and there that Madison Gilmore was different, she was going to take her fate into her own hands and not be a fucking coward. 

So I slunk through the shadows of the exterior hallways of the motel's second floor, and made sure no psychos were within eyesight of the motel before I knocked on the door. I could hear talking from inside, multiple voices. I was let in pretty soon, and saw that there were five people in total in there including Ryan and Jenny, all with frowning masks, although they were taken off at the moment. They had duffels packed and weapons like crowbars and hammers laid out on the desk. The door was quickly shut behind me. 

“What's your name?” Jenny asked. She was blonde, young, and pretty. 

“Madison.” I replied. “Now tell me what your genius plan is before I get my hopes up too high.” 

“Well,” Jenny began, inviting me to sit in the armchair by the window with a gesture, “we can't get through the wall, and we can't get over the wall, so we found a way to go under the wall.”

I scoffed. “And to think I actually thought I was getting out of this hellhole…”

“There's an underground base only the people who govern this town use.” Ryan explained. “The Scowler thing all began when someone who worked with the council went down there and saw all sorts of fucked up experiments they were doing to test the serum. They decided to start the organization in secret, but they were somehow found out and haven't been seen since. We decided to continue the cause either way.” 

“We actually thought we could make a difference.” Another woman sitting on one of the beds sighed, looking despondent with her mask in her hands. “Thought they'd listen to reason and improve the town so it could actually be the perfect home.” 

“Should've called our losses and gotten out of dodge before shit hit the fan.” Another man sitting on the counter of the bathroom sink added. 

“Where did that wall even come from?” I asked. 

“Underground.” Jenny answered me. “It's even more proof that the base exists. One of us saw it when it went up. It just shot up straight from the earth, like it had been there all along.” 

“So it goes all the way underground?” I raised an eyebrow. “Then how are we gonna leave underground?” 

Ryan brought my attention to a large blueprint spread out over the round dining table by slamming his hand on it. “Remember the council guy I mentioned? We found this in his house after he disappeared. There's a passage that leads through the wall and seems to let out somewhere in the forest. We'll be miles away from civilization but we'll be free.”

“So, how do we get in?” I came over and looked at the intricate and complex looking architectural floor plan. 

“That's where things get… complicated.” Jenny said.  

“As if they weren't already.” I rolled my eyes. 

“Our leader's name was David,” Ryan replied, “David told us before those assholes did something to him that there were lots of ways to get into the base, some even hidden in plain sight. He said one of the most easily accessible ways was in a Sentinel Station. Being that they are the authorities of Smilesville and trusted by the Council, they have direct access to the base. Every station has a basement with access there.”

“So you're just gonna waltz in there?” I rubbed my forehead, feeling beyond stressed already. 

“The town is practically going up in flames.” The woman sitting on the bed, who was brown skinned and wearing a beanie, said. “Sentinels are all over the place right now. They only have so many of those guys, and they're busy trying to reign in those smile junkies. We can only hope that the stations are less manned rightnow, and will be even lesser-manned at night, which is when we expect things will get even worse.” 

“Worse? Worse how?” I felt uneasy. 

“At night, the symptoms of the serum get more extreme.” Jenny said grimly. “This past week, as those signs started to show up, it became more and more evident with each night. People were wandering the streets mindlessly, puking and giggling like hyenas. It was so… creepy. Like a sundowning thing.” 

I couldn't imagine things being worse after today. Worse than teenage boys playing basketball with someone's severed head? Worse than my friend trying to run me over with her car? And we were just going to walk out there among all the madness and just hope there was no one manning a station? I voiced these concerns to them. 

“We are going to pretend to be Smilers reporting a crime.” The man on the bathroom sink wearing a flannel shirt said. “We even have the masks.” He gestured to one of the duffle bags. “Then, we're gonna knock those motherfuckers out, lock them up in their own cells, and find the entrance to the base.” 

“I know it sounds crazy, but it's our only chance.” Jenny said. “So, are you in, or out?” 

I gave it a few moments of consideration. I did say I was turning a leaf, that I was going to save myself this time. I also remembered what Mrs. Stratton said over the phone, about how this would all be cleared up in a few days. It was obvious the people in charge were desperate to clean up their mess, and didn't want anyone getting out to tell the tale before they can try to force them into silence by legal contract or threaten their lives. But it was plain as day to everyone else that this wasn't something that could just be solved and moved on from. I mean, we're talking mass homicides and basically terrorism. 

“I'm in.” 

*** 

When the sun was setting, we set out on foot with all the bags. We were wearing Smile masks, and equipped with weapons in case someone tried to attack. However, we did our best to avoid that, and took back alleys or deserted side streets everywhere, which made things take a bit longer. We could still hear chaos and cruiser sirens all over the city, punctuated every now and then by a scream or a baby crying. Finally, we made it around to a local police department , or more accurately, a ‘Sentinel Station.’ The building was official looking like any old police station, but more yellow in color, as if painting this sunny color everywhere made things in this town seem brighter and happier. 

We looked through the glass of the front windows and double doors, seeing that the front desk area was abandoned. No receptionist and no officers anywhere, just furniture bathed in fluorescent white light. However, there was one big problem: the entrance was chained and padlocked. Clearly, they were smarter than we thought. I felt dumb for not thinking of this and wondered if they did, too. 

“Well, what now-” 

“Stand back.” The man wearing the red plaid flannel shirt, who I had come to find out was ‘Darren,’ raised the baseball bat in his hand and knocked the butt of it against the glass. It fractured with one hit. With a few more hard swings, it shattered, and he used the handle to clear the shards from the frames so we could safely step over and inside. 

“Did anyone hear that?!” I whispered harshly as we all clambered through the window. 

“Let's not stick around to find out,” the woman wearing the beanie, Latasha, whispered back through gritted teeth.

It seemed the longer we searched the building that no one had actually heard us breaking in, though. Still, we were quick and quiet, and there was still the possibility of a Sentinel returning, or God forbid some random crazy person, seeing the destruction from outside and finding us. It really seemed like a regular “police” station, and nothing was too amiss, aside from the spare Smile masks and serum shots of course. Until I parted from the group and entered one particular room that seemed out of place, through a door at the end of a hall. 

The walls were a nauseatingly bright yellow, and the floor white tile. There were rows of metal chairs lined up before a  TV mounted on the far wall. Under the TV was a small stool where a black remote was perched on. Out of curiosity entirely, although I knew this could've been a waste of time, I went over and turned the TV on. As soon as it powered on, it started cycling through these strange black and white scenes. I'll try my best to describe them, because as soon as I was able to tear my eyes off them, it's like my brain was quickly trying to scrub the memory away. 

One scene had a big room full of people in seats, resembling a theater or stadium, but it didn't look like either one. They all stood up in unison, and although the camera was some distance from them I could tell they were smiling, but because of the grainy, low quality I couldn't tell if they were wearing masks or not. After they stood, they started laughing in an almost comically exaggerated way, slapping their knees and throwing their heads back. It seemed as if someone had told them to laugh and their acting skills weren't great. 

Then it cut to a man being tortured on a stage, possibly in the same room. Even with the film being in black and white, I could clearly see he was covered in blood, and dismembered. It was so jaw droppingly gruesome that I audibly gasped. His hands were missing, as was his legs below the knee. His face was covered in blood and I couldn't see any indication of eyes, or a nose or mouth, leading me to believe his face just wasn't there at all and had been cut off or damaged to the point it was just pulp. He writhed on the ground, thrashing about, and another well dressed man stood by him, whipping him like some animal or slave. Occasionally, the torturer would look up and at the audience with an expectant grin, prompting them to laugh even harder.

That's what I remember the most. The next scenes are fuzzy to me. They didn't make sense or seem to connect with one another. I slightly recall that one had a clown doing a routine in front of an audience of children that involved pulling a bunch of clothes tied together out of his mouth, and then after that there was a real funeral being taped with two parents sobbing and despairing over their two children lying in open caskets. I watched long enough to notice a running theme, a pattern more like, of there being a sick and disturbing scene followed by something fun and cheery. 

I felt a tap on my shoulder and spun around, raising the crowbar they'd given me. It was only Ryan, who backed away and put his hands up. “Whoa, it's just me-” he began, before his eyes caught sight of the TV screen and he slowly removed his mask to get a better look. This time, the screen showed a litter of puppies being removed from their mother's cut open womb and shoved into a bag that was then stomped over by a woman wearing stilettos. Then it cut to a kids show of a puppet show with the characters  dancing in a fake field of sunflowers.

“What the fuck?” 

“I know.” I suddenly remembered I was holding the remote in my hand and turned it off. There was this light, fuzzy feeling hanging over my brain, but it dispersed with time. 

“We found it.” Was all he said before turning around and leaving the room. I followed after him hastily, not looking back once. Neither of us brought it up again. 

It was located in a holding cell they had to find the keys to. Presumably it was a cell they never put anyone in, just there to be decieving, and it was all the way at the end and covered in dust and cobwebs. There were no people being held captive there. Jenny had seen the state of that cell and became wise, so she had Latasha search with her, and lo and behold, under a metal  cot was a big loose tile hiding an airtight hatch. The hatch clearly had a number code, which caused me great concern until I saw Ryan pulling out papers from his jacket pocket, sorting through them, and telling Darren the numbers as he used his strength to turn the big, metal wheel like a dial for a combination code lock. 

We all took our  flashlights and went down a ladder into a steel chamber one by one. The last person to go down threw down the duffle bags for us to catch before climbing down themselves and shutting the hatch behind them. 

I felt excited but also frightened. I couldn't wait for this nightmare to be over, to taste freedom and return to regular society. But it wasn't over, not yet.
