Lawns

I recently remembered something that disturbs me deeply. This truly shook me to my core and my outlook on my life has changed drastically because of this.

As a teenager, you tend to think that you are completely invincible. Nothing can ever hurt you. This is not true.

Going into my sophomore year of high school, I went on a backpacking trip with a few friends and was feeling a little brave. I decided that I was going to jump across some large rocks. It was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. My foot got caught in one of the cracks in the rock. I broke my ankle and smacked my head against the hard rock, leaving me concussed and in immense pain. I now have a permanent dent in my head, scarring on my foot, a crooked nose, and some missing teeth. I had to get airlifted to the closest hospital and the rest of the trip was cancelled.

I found out at the hospital that I had also broken my leg and torn my anterior talofibular ligament due to my broken ankle. The pain was horrible. I went into that school year in a wheelchair, a cast on my leg and foot, and multiple bandages that needed to be changed several times throughout the day. It was absolutely embarrassing.
I've never been the scholarly type. The year of my injuries, I was entering my second sophomore year. I failed everything miserably the year prior and got held back. I never had a grade higher than a D. Due to this fact, I was bullied relentlessly by nearly everyone around me. My friends abandoned me, my brother made fun of me, and my mother constantly expressed her disappointment in me. It was a horrible year for me that year. I was on the verge of suicide for most of that year.

I only remember one assignment from that year. It was the last assignment of the year, meaning that there was no way that it was going to push me over the edge for that class. It was a business class. We were required to make up and try to execute a business plan. Corbin and I decided we wanted to mow lawns. We designed our flyers, equipped with pictures of both of us, all our gear, and my phone number. Corbin had yet to get a phone. We put that flyer everywhere. We put it in every mailbox, knocked on every door, nailed it to every possible pole, and handed it to any pedestrian that dare walked on our side of the street. The phone calls and text messages never came. At least not until mid-July when we got a message from a man who wanted his lawn mowed and the edges trimmed. He scheduled us for July 17th at 6:30 pm.

On the day of his lawn appointment, we got to the house and things seemed normal at first. It was an average house, with an average front and back yard, and an average garage. Everything about this house seemed normal. There were far more security cameras than what we had ever seen before, but we just chalked it up to the homeowners being anxious about robberies or something like that. We didn't live in the safest neighborhood ever. There was a note left on the door. It read “Thank you for mowing my lawn. Behind this envelope is the cash to pay you. Please collect and mow my lawn. My phone number is (* * * ) * * *  * * * * (censored because I cant seem to remember the number). Thanks again. I'm most likely inside if anything is needed.” The paper was rather dirty. As if whoever wrote it had been doing some yard work or something right before they wrote the note. There were dirty hand prints all over the note. Regardless we started working.

It was rather late when we started our work. We didn't get there until about 6 o`clock, and didn't start until around 6:30. It took a while for us to mow. The grass was thicker than we had anticipated, and our mower was nearly 10 years old, and our floundering lawn mowing business had not yet made enough money to buy a new one. As we were trying to mow, I began to notice a flashing light coming from one of the windows of the house. I didn't think anything of it. I thought that maybe the house owner was watching TV or maybe they were turning on and shutting off lights or something. We kept working until my ankle had started to hurt. I took a seat and Corbin finished for the night. We collected our cash and went home.

We got home around 9 that night and decided that Corbin was going to spend the night at my house. We split our earnings and got ready for bed. We each made 20 dollars that day. Now if you`ve read my previous post, you understand that something constantly taps at my window in the middle of the night, and it persists until I wake up and look to the window. That night was weird, however. We went to sleep that night and the inevitable taps had started. But rather than there being nothing there, that night there was a piece of paper taped to my window.

I got up, walked over to the window, and grabbed the paper off of my window. It was a picture. A picture of Corbin and I while we were working on that lawn. It was printed on a piece of computer paper with a heart around me. Corbin had been crossed out on the paper. The paper had many dirty prints all over it. I looked around outside but saw nothing. All I heard was some crunching and the sound of a camera taking a picture. My phone was blowing up. I checked my messages and saw dozens of messages from the client earlier saying things like “Soon you will love me, as I love you” followed by dozens of pictures of me working, always with the heart around me, and Corbin being crossed out. I woke Corbin up and we ran to my mom's room, woke her up, showed her the pictures, and immediately left the house. We spent the night at Corbin's house and lived in several different motels for the next several months.

That night my mom called the police, and while they couldn`t help much, the fact that the police knew was at least a little comforting for me. It was a nice false sense of security. 
	
That's all I can remember right now. My mother is getting irritated with all my questions, but I feel that I deserve to know all the facts of what happened during my childhood. It's starting to drive me insane that there is so much mystery in my mind that I don't understand.

I will write again once I'm able to pry more information out of my mother, but for now, that's all I have.

I'm looking through all of the pictures again, and I'm starting to feel sick to my stomach because there is something out there sick enough to do this to a person for so long. This is real torture.
