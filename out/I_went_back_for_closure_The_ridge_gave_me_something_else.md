My best friend Eilidh and I had been bagging munros for over three years when we finally found *our* mountain—a remote ridgewalk tucked deep in the Cairngorms National Park. 

It was breathtaking, brutal, and nearly always empty. The kind of place you'd only reach if you had the orienteering skills to even find it, and the stubbornness to try. 

Few people walked the route to the ridge, let alone attempted to wild camp on the mountain—we managed to find a snug camp spot, a semi-exposed indent in the rock along the craggy mountainside—sheltered just enough to pitch a tent, though still being battered by the elements. 

On the concave rockface, faint markings stretched across the stone. Faded and strange it intrigued us enough to try and identify what they were.

Eilidh took some pictures, and afterward, did some digging. She found similar symbols at sites all over the world—each tied to local myths about “thin places,” places where time and space didn’t behave the way it should. The stories were always old and half-forgotten—tales of travellers returning changed, or never returning at all. Electric storms that let you speak to the Gods. If travellers did come back, they all had one thing in common—no one came back whole. Sometimes it was subtle, like having the wrong eye colour. Other times it was worse. Like when they opened their mouths, someone else's voice came out. 

We’d never experienced anything on that mountain beyond unforgiving weather. But still, it felt sacred—ancient, powerful. That only made us love it more. Our own little piece of history. 

We returned to it as often as we could. Rain, hail or shine—it always felt like coming home. 

Eilidh always made fun of me for packing too much. She said I packed like we were going on a polar expedition, not a two-day camp and a ridge walk.  

“Come on tae fuck, crampons? In summer?” She half laughed, watching me zip up my overstuffed pack.  

“Ye know how quick the weather cin chinge up there,” I shot back. “Mind that time we camped in the sunshine and woke up tae a blizzard?” 

She just shook her head, laughing. “Still made it doon in wan piece though, dint we?” 

Then, last summer, she asked to do it again.  

I had just started a new job. The kind you don’t take time off from straight away. 

“A cannae, Eilidh,” I told her.  “Ye know how important this job is fur me. Just gee us a month, and we’ll go.”

I begged her to wait. But I knew that itch—she had it worse than I did. The need to get out there, to move, to breathe in the wild. Waiting wasn’t in her nature. 

She told me she’d already packed. That she expected me to say no, but wanted to ask anyway—just in case. She’d even packed crampons and extra tent poles, despite the season. Probably more for my peace of mind than hers.  

Before she left, I checked her pack one last time and tucked a Twix—her favourite—into the side pocket for later. We cuddled and said our goodbyes, and I wished her luck. I stood at the door and watched her hobble down the path with her gear. 

She gave me one last wave before driving off.

*You should be gaun wae her,* I told myself. 

It had only been a day, and although Eilidh was more than capable of mountaineering solo—in fact it was her who taught me everything I knew—something tugged at me. 

I decided to check the weather on her route. It was supposed to be cold but clear all week. 

It wasn’t.

A storm had rolled in, directly on top of the mountain Eilidh was on. 

My heart started racing.

*Chill oot Brodie. She knows wit she’s dain. Over-prepared—just like you always dae. She’ll be fine.* 

She had shared her Garmin GPS location with me, as she always did when solo hill walking. Up until this morning, it had been sending out the usual “I’m safe” messages and updates on her trail progress. 

I opened the app and checked again. 

Nothing. 

No GPS ping. No texts. Nothing. 

I called her family. 

They didn’t seem worried. 

“Eilidh knows wit she's dain, hen.” her mum said gently, repeating my own thoughts back to me. “She’s always bin careful. She shid be back in a day—try no tae worry!”

But I was worried. 

I waited through the night, hoping the signal would come back. That she’d check in.

I told myself—*if she disnae get back tae me by morning, ad git mountain rescue phoned.* 

That was a year ago. 

Eilidh never came back. 

Not even a piece of her kit turned up—despite the best efforts of some of the most skilled mountain rescuers in the world.

Her parents accepted this, almost too easily. Which… I get and I don’t. 

If the rescue teams couldn’t find a single trace—not after scouring the ridge and surrounding areas grid by grid for months—then maybe no-one could. 

But still. She was their only daughter. 

Surely there was more they could’ve done? Surely there was more I could’ve done. 

There was some part of me that felt like she was still alive, still out there. Waiting for me to find her. 

It took me almost the full year she was gone to work myself up to going back to the ridge. I thought maybe it would bring me closer to her. Maybe it would give me some closure. 

So I packed. Told my family where I was going—and they supported my decision. I double-checked my pack, like I used to do for Eilidh, then stuffed it into the car. 

As always, I’d checked the weather in advance—and again that morning, just to be sure. 

Cold but clear, same as it was for Eilidh. 

My stomach sat heavy. 

I couldn’t help but wonder if I was making a mistake. 

But I was desperate to be close to her—as close as I could get—I pushed the thought aside and readied myself for the 12-and-a-half-mile walk to the camp spot. 

The path was rugged and poorly maintained. Just setting foot on it again gave me that familiar, wild feeling—like I was somewhere I wasn’t supposed to be. It was probably used more by wild animals than people. 

I paused to breathe it in—the crisp mountain air, the quiet stillness, the way the light caught the dew as it slowly evaporated, the droplets twinkling like stars. This was what life was meant to feel like. Eilidh had always known that.

Usually, when I pictured her alone up there—gale-force winds battering her tent, scared and cold—it tore me apart. But now that I was back on the trail? 

Now, all I could think was… *Eilidh died dain wit she loved. How cin a be angry wae that?* 

Soon, all I could focus on was putting one foot in front of the other as the trail gained elevation. I hadn't done anything outdoorsy since Eilidh died and my body felt it. That said the weather was still beautiful—crisp cold air paired with the direct sunlight. It was good to be back outside. 

I was making good time, and didn’t want to slow down. If I kept the pace up, I’d be at the camp spot in under an hour. I pushed on—my muscles begging me to relent. 

I reached the camp spot and got my tent pitched just in time. While securing the last guy line, I noticed the symbols on the wall—once faint and barely noticeable, now bright and fresh. It looked as if someone had drawn over them.  

The weather turned fast—what had started as a crisp summer morning had collapsed into torrential rain and hail. I could hear the wind rolling in, miles off but closing in quick, dragged along by jet-black clouds that swallowed the sky. 

The familiar warmth I used to feel up here was gone—replaced by something cold and sharp. Dread. 

I’d been here in rain. In snow. But never in a proper storm. 

Then the wind hit the mountain.

I hadn’t packed extra tent poles like Eilidh did, and now the tent flapped wildly, even with every guy line pulled tight. The noise was deafening—canvas snapping, rain hammering like fists. 

This was the first time I’d felt real, ancestral fear—a fear that I might never leave this mountain. I started to sob.

And for the first time wondered—*Is this how Eilidh felt before she died?*

The storm was relentless. 

I couldn't hear anything but wind, screaming through the mountains for what felt like hours. My ears rang, raw and aching—I was almost convinced the pressure had burst something. 

Then came a different sound. 

A low, drawn-out horn—

Not from any instrument I’d ever heard.

It echoed through the storm like it was being pulled from the bones of the mountain itself.

And it arrived with a shift in the air—an ancient terror that settled in the pit of my soul.
