Hey Aggie, it’s Drew. How are you? I’m fine.

Well, that’s enough chit-chat, let’s get down to business…

I’m posting this on a throwaway account from a secure location. Any minute now you’ll shuffle into the lounge, kick off your shoes, plop down in that stupid armchair you love so much, and browse this shitty sub for hours on end.

Well, guess what? I’ve got a special surprise for you…**YOU’RE DUMPED.**

Now don't even try to say I'm blind sighting you with this post. I already tried breaking up with you once before, remember? See, you got upset over my reasoning and claimed you were upfront about your hobbies (as if ‘hobby’ even comes CLOSE to describing what you do) from our first Tinder conversation. 

Here’s the thing, though: when a lady says she’s into magic, guys *generally* assume she means Owl House cosplay or some shit. Not, oh I dunno, LITERAL FUCKING WITCHCRAFT.

So then when I learned the truth (AFTER spending six months’ salary on your engagement ring ffs) and hint at calling off the wedding, you made the temperature plummet while pictures danced along the walls.

Then, after I dropped to my knees and begged you to take me back—y’know, because the ground started shaking and the lights blinked out—there was a patch of breath fog in the icy bedroom window framed by four-fingered handprints.

And you just smirked and said, “Good thing we patched things up, huh?”

Well guess what: **IT’S OVER**. I’m gone with the wind. My phones in the bin, I’ve blocked your email, and deleted ALL social media. You can’t intimidate me into staying through party tricks. So go find some other chump and ruin *his* life. And because I'm such a nice guy, you can even keep the ring.

Ciao, bitch.

~~P.S. I lied: You DO have weird elbows.~~

**Edit:** Okay, this is spooky. There’s a noise coming from the attic of my safe house. Aggie, is this anything to do with you? Maybe I came on a little strong with this post, but I *really* think us moving on is for the best. Please take some time and really think about it.

**Edit 2:** What the fuck, it’s like there’s a giant cat with long nails running around up there. The sound moved above my head when I got up to use the bathroom. Aggie, are you casting some kind of curse? This isn’t funny. Can’t we part ways amicably?

Look, I was just in a foul mood before. Your elbows aren’t weird. I'm sorry I said that.

**Edit 3:** What. The. Fuck. The attic stairwell just folded down by itself then the engagement ring toppled down the steps and rolled across the hall into my room. I swear there’s a fucking voice whispering my name up there. Aggie, I can’t remember your number. If you’re reading this please, please, please PM me. Please.

**Edit 4:** Oh fuck it’s banging against the door. I can hear sharp nails raking across the wood. FUCK I’m stuck. Aggie please I just wanna talk to you again, say I love you again, laugh with you, cook with you, play board games, split a bottle of expensive wine at a fancy restaurant. 

I’d do anything to reconcile our relationship. I was an idiot before. I just want to heal you. And heal myself too.

Without you life is meaningless. Please reach out. My DMs are open. Please please please.

**Edit 5:** Hi everyone, Aggie and I are back together. We’ve agreed to try working through our issues. I’m the luckiest guy alive to have such an understanding partner. [Thanks for your concern.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)
