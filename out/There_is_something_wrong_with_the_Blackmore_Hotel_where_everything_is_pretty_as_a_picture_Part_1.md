I needed a  job, just something to earn some extra cash before returning to the chaos of work and school back home. I found one at the Blackmore Hotel, but then things started to get weird. Now, I don't even know who I can trust anymore. The terrifying events there made me question what is real and what is not, as well as the true intentions of everyone around me. It's ironic that I feel more comfortable confiding in strangers than my own friends . Maybe after so long I finally feel safe enough to talk about what happened. But nevermind that, it doesn't matter right now. What matters is that I share with you what happened at Blackmore Hotel, where it all started out pretty as a picture.

Seven months ago, I was set to start my job at the Blackmore Hotel. I was happy to have found a summer job so soon, as it meant that I would not hit too much of a slump in my pay. I worked as a teacher for the majority of the year. Times were tight and I always needed something in summertime to help ease the financial burden. So when I heard about the opportunity I jumped at it.

The Blackmore Hotel was a little out of the way, but not too bad to get there from where I lived. I had never stayed there before, but the place was recommended to me by my old friend Victor. He was also the current manager and by virtue of that status, soon to be my boss for the summer. He and I went way back and I was grateful to not only have the job, but to catch up with him as well.

The drive was scenic, if a little long. I drove through a good chunk of rural roads and a stretch of farmland and finally I came upon the well kept lot that housed the Blackmore Hotel. I stepped out and grabbed my suitcase. Since I was going to be working here and the drive was not insignificant, Victor offered me a room to stay in to avoid a daily commute. I readily accepted the offer. It worked for me since I did not have much to worry about leaving at home.

I walked to the entrance and was impressed as I beheld the imposing facade of the Blackmore Hotel. The Victorian-era building loomed above me, its weathered brick and ornate structure hinting at a long and storied past. As the summer breeze rustled through the nearby trees, I couldn't shake the feeling that the hotel's darkened windows were watching me. It felt imposing in its grandeur, reminding me a lot of the opulent yet haunted hotels in movies and literature. I am a bit embarrassed to admit that I paused before proceeding. Wondering what secrets the tottering place could hold.

I took a deep breath and ignored the temporary distraction. It was silly, hotels were only creepy because of all the strangers and all the stories. I brushed it off with a chuckle and proceeded inside.

Pushing through the heavy oak doors, I entered the lobby. The musty scent of old wood and faded memories enveloped me. I walked into the very tastefully decorated entrance hall and saw the check in counter a bit further ahead and figured I would start there.

I saw that even that waiting bench was an exquisite piece of work, crafted from mahogany with delicate carvings adorning its surface. Despite the high sheen, it bore marks of wear and tear, evidence of the many guests who had sat at it over the years.

As I looked around I also saw many paintings hung in several spots around the lobby. I was reminded of my old friends proclivity towards the artistic. I was genuinely impressed at how nice everything looked. I moved up to the front counter and as I looked near the desk I saw a figure I knew well, it was the man himself.

Victor Blackmore, my friend from school. We had lost touch after graduation, but he hadn't changed much in the few years that had passed. I had thought he had moved on to a prestigious art school and was surprised when I had received word from him that he was now working at his families hotel and not in some far flung corner of Europe learning the secrets of the masters of the craft, as he often pined about doing once he finished high school. As I approached and greeted him with a smile, he recognized me at once,

“Hey, Sam!” Victor greeted me with a grin, though his eyes seemed slightly sunken, as if he hadn’t slept well in days. “Glad you made it. You’re just in time for the orientation. It’s... interesting today, to say the least.”

“Interesting?” I responded, setting my bag onto the desk.“What do you mean by that?”

Victor leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a whisper.

"Well some guests have reported strange sights and sounds at night that have caused a bit of a scare. Now there is absurd talk of hauntings. I swear just because a victorian building with lots of memories is used as a hotel, everyone and their mother think it's haunted. It's been five years since I took over this place from my parents, and we always seem to attract the most superstitious visitors.” He sighed in frustration and continued,

“What’s worse is that because people are paranoid about this irrational nonsense, the art exhibit is likely to be poorly attended."

He frowned at the thought, his brow furrowing deeply and casting a shadow over his eyes. I noticed a young woman standing behind the front desk, her hands fidgeting anxiously with a pen. Her gaze darted between the man and her computer screen, nervously watching him, anticipation etched across her features as she waited for him to finish speaking.

"But don't worry about it," Victor continued, his voice calm and steady as he turned back to me. "Let's just focus on our work here. The summer season is bustling, and we don't have much help for a place of this size. Not too many people I can count on, except of course for you, right Irene?" He glanced at the young woman, who nodded silently, her eyes downcast as if the words were too heavy to voice aloud. Her demeanor was shy, her cheeks tinged with a faint blush of embarrassment.

When I caught her eye, she quickly turned away, her gaze fluttering like a startled bird. I couldn't help but feel a twinge of concern that Victor might not be the most comforting manager for someone with a more introverted nature. She seemed like a sweet and sensitive soul, and Victor was sometimes annoyingly boisterous.

Victor checked his phone suddenly and held up a finger to indicate he needed a moment. I walked up to the front counter and introduced myself to the clerk, whom I had already learned was named Irene.

“Hi, my name is Sam. I assume we’ll be working together this summer. It’s nice to meet you.” She seemed uncertain at first, but eventually gave a small smile and replied, “Oh, yes, sorry. I’m just not feeling myself today. The noise around here can make it hard to sleep at night. My name is Irene, I work as the day clerk here. And when there's time, I assist with room service and cleaning.” Before I could finish our introduction, Irene rose from her seat as another group of guests entered and she began attending to them at the front desk.

At that moment, Victor put down his phone and asked me to follow him for a tour of the place, allowing Irene to focus on her work. Just as we were about to leave, he grabbed a radio from his belt and said, "Ryan, come down here. We have a group and need our bellhop."

He turned back to me, apologized for the delay, and said, "Alright, let's get going. I can't wait to show you the rest of the place. I know you've got a keen eye and will appreciate it. I've spared no expense. As you know, I always make sure everything is as 'pretty as a picture.'" He chuckled, and I smiled too, remembering how he used to say that back in school. The old saying was sort of his catchphrase. Whenever something turned out well, looked good to him, or he was just happy he would always say it.

We continued on to the tour, and he led me away from the counter toward the central lobby and the corridors beyond.

Victor marched at a brisk pace, his polished leather shoes clicking against the marble floor as he led me deeper into the hotel. The rest of the lobby was grand, with high ceilings adorned with intricate moldings and a chandelier that cast flickering shadows across the room. I could not place it, but despite its elegance, there was something unsettling about the space. It was too dark maybe.

Victor broke the brief tension and spoke, his voice echoing slightly in the cavernous space. “You know, Sam, I’ve been thinking a lot about the past few years. It’s hard to believe it’s been so long since we last caught up properly. Life has a way of pulling people in different directions, doesn’t it?” He glanced at me with a knowing smile, his piercing blue eyes gleaming with a mixture of nostalgia and curiosity.

As we continued, the marble floor beneath our feet seemed to hum faintly with each step, a sound that was both elegant and oddly unsettling. The walls were lined with tall, ornate mirrors that reflected our images in distorted waves, giving the illusion that we were walking through a ripple in time itself. Above us, the chandelier swayed ever so slightly, casting long, ominous shadows that danced across the walls like restless spirits.

“I mean, think about it,” Victor continued, his voice smooth and reflective. “We were just kids, sitting in Mrs. Winslow’s history class, and now here we are. You’re working at my hotel, and I’m… well, I’m running the place. It’s funny how life turns out, isn’t it?” He chuckled softly, a low, melodic sound that seemed to match the rhythm of our footsteps.

We turned a corner, and the corridor opened up into a long, dimly lit hallway lined with doors that seemed to stretch on endlessly. The air here felt heavier, thick with the scent of old wood and something else—something faintly metallic that I couldn’t quite place. Victor noticed my lingering gaze and nodded. “The guest rooms. We’ve had our fair share of… interesting visitors over the years. People come and go, but this place has a way of leaving an impression.” He paused, his smile widening slightly. “That impression is always one we try to make special. The spirit of this place is more than just the conjurations paranoid people assume it holds.”

I raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite myself. “Holds? You mean like ghosts?” I asked, trying to keep my tone light, though the weight of the atmosphere made it difficult.

Victor laughed, the sound deep and resonant, but there was something in his eyes that didn’t quite match the humor in his voice. “Oh, Sam, don’t start buying into that nonsense and getting cold feet. I mean you could say this place has a certain… character. It’s old, you know? And old things tend to accumulate stories, whether you believe in them or not.” He gestured to a large, ornate painting on the wall, depicting a scene of the hotel in its heyday. The figures in the painting seemed to stare out with unsettling intensity, their eyes following us as we moved.

I frowned, my gaze lingering on the painting. There was something about it that felt off, something that made the back of my neck prickle. “It’s definitely got atmosphere,” I admitted, though I didn’t mention the growing sense of unease that had settled in the pit of my stomach.

Victor nodded, his expression thoughtful. “Atmosphere is what makes a place like this special. It’s not just a hotel, Sam. It’s an experience. And I think you’ll find that the longer you stay, the more… layers you’ll uncover.” He paused, his eyes glinting with a knowing light. “But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. There’s still so much to show you. Indeed if you enjoyed the painting of the hotel, there are rows of my families art to enjoy further along, come on.”

As we continued down the hallway, the shadows seemed to deepen around us, and the air grew colder. I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched, that unblinking eyes were never too far behind.

The hallway continued winding on before us, lined with walls that seemed to hum with an almost palpable energy. Every few feet, there were paintings—strange, vivid pieces that seemed to glow faintly in the dim light. Victor noticed my gaze and slowed his pace, a faint, knowing smile playing on his lips.

"Ah, yes," he said, his voice was low and measured. "The Blackmore Hotel has always been a place of... artistic expression. My family, you will remember, are all artists. Not just in the conventional sense, but in the way we see the world, the way we craft experiences. Each piece here was created by someone in my family. Many more are in various galleries throughout the hotel."

I stopped in front of one of the paintings, my breath catching in my throat. It depicted a sprawling, otherworldly landscape—twisted trees with bark that shimmered like liquid silver, and skies that swirled with colors I couldn’t name. But what struck me as odd was the absence of any figures, human or otherwise. The painting was teeming with life, yet utterly devoid of people.

Victor chuckled and stepped closer to the painting. His reflection in the glass seemed to ripple, as if the surface were water. "Yes, we've never been ones for... portraits. Or scenes of everyday life. Why bother with the mundane when you can capture the essence of a feeling, a moment, a world?"

He moved to the next painting, his long fingers brushing against the frame. This one was darker—deep, rich blacks punctuated by slashes of crimson and gold. It seemed to pulse, as though it were alive. "This one," he murmured, "was done by my sister. She had a talent for capturing the... heavier emotions. Fear, longing, the weight of secrets kept too long."

I felt a shiver run down my spine as I turned to him. "Your family did all of these?"

He nodded, his piercing blue eyes glinting with pride. "Yes. Every piece in this hotel was crafted by a Blackmore. It's a tradition, you might say. We don't just run a hotel—we curate an experience. And the art is part of that."

As we continued down the hall, the paintings grew stranger, more surreal. One depicted a room filled with doors, each one slightly ajar, revealing glimpses of places that didn’t seem to belong together—a beach, a forest, a city street. Another showed a staircase that spiraled upward into darkness, with faint, flickering lights that seemed to move as I watched.

A third image depicted an ancient castle beside a dark lake, with two suns setting in the sky above. The shadows they cast on the weathered, wind-beaten stonework were unsettling in their striking depiction.

Victor’s voice dropped to a whisper, his tone taking on a conspiratorial edge. "Each piece tells a story, distinct and beautiful. A story, not the kind with a beginning, middle, and end, but the kind that makes you feel something deep in your bones. The kind that stays with you long after you’ve left the canvas behind."

I couldn’t help but ask, "Why no people?"

He stopped abruptly, his gaze locking onto mine. For a moment, I thought I saw something flicker in his eyes—something sharp, something defensive. But then it was gone, replaced by his usual charm. "People are... complicated. Unpredictable. We prefer to focus on the things that truly matter—the emotions, the moments, the truths that lie just beneath the surface. A person’s story, their soul can be told in paint, but…..it is best not to try. The consequences of failing to capture that story, that soul….can be as terrible, yet wondrous when you succeed."

He turned away, his stride lengthening again. "Nevermind that for now, if you would like to enjoy more of the art we will have our gallery exhibition later this week. You are welcome to view the pieces on display when you are not busy with your duties of course. Now come, there’s more to see."

As I followed him, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the paintings were watching me, their empty landscapes filled with a silence that was almost deafening. I paused for a second when I thought I heard a noise from one of the paintings. I knew it was silly, but I leaned in closer and waited. Nothing happened of course, but I swore I had heard something. I figured the superstitions were already getting to me. Victor called down the hall impatiently and I rushed along to follow.

 We turned a corner and Victor continued the discussion about the hotel,

"This hotel," he said, "it’s not just a building. It’s a living, breathing thing. My legacy. Once you’re inside its walls, you will see. It has a way of rewarding the trained eye and of course is pretty as a picture too." He looked back and showed me a reassuring grin.

I didn’t have time to respond before he pushed through a door at the end of the hall, disappearing into the shadows again.

I considered the guests who believed the halls were apparently haunted. Maybe this place did have that special kind of eye catching magic that made people wonder. I was normally a firm skeptic but something did feel strange about this place. My thoughts were interrupted by Victor, who signaled for me to follow him. I rushed along to catch up, my footsteps echoing through the eerie, though impressive halls as I moved.
