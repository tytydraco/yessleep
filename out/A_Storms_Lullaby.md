The harsh storm outside is music to my ears. My room is dead silent. The only sounds accompanying me being the rain outside and the sounds coming from the air conditioner.

I rubbed my eyes tiredly, looking at the time on my computer. 4am. Of course it's morning already. I sighed in exhaustion. I had forgotten to leave my room again.

Let's see how long I've been here… about 2 weeks I think?. The reason for it is, well, I just don't really want to and I don't have to. As my school, Crimson Solstice Academy, shut down last month due to some circumstances.

Anyway, my friends and parents are worried and my mother even quit her job in order to help me. As I've stopped looking after myself after the incident. My parents had even decided to hire a therapist to help me. My mom says I'm still in shock, even though it's been months since the incident. But my therapist said I'm still grieving and suffering from the guilt.

Before anything, no it wasn't me who did it, I just felt that if I had arrived sooner she wouldn't have suffered. It's all because of me.

You might be wondering what I'm talking about right? Well, let me explain what I meant, and hopefully it will shed some light. 

I've been attending the prestigious Crimson Solstice Academy ever since I was just a little 4 year old, attending the kindergarten there, up to the day the school was forced to shut its doors. But that's not the point.

It all started when the school started after the yearly Winter break, a new girl had transferred to my class. I was excited as I've been in the same school for most of my life and this is probably the first time my class is the one getting a new student. I'm not sure why, but my class always had the least amount of students. Before let me explain that the 10th grade each classes in my school each had about 30 students, while my class only had 28 and my class would almost never get any new transfer students, that is. Until she arrived.

It was a normal day, everyone gossiping and chatting with each other and sharing what they did that holiday to their friends. Our homeroom teacher Ms Riley had been late that day. We were all so loud that Ms Riley had to loudly slam her marker on the blackboard to shush us.

“Now that I've finally gotten your attention” she frowned but then her lips curved to a smile. “I'm sure you've heard that we'll be getting a new student this year” She said, everyone nodded, a chorus of ‘yes’, ‘yeah’, and ‘yep’ echoed, answering her question.

That's when I noticed her, she wore our uniform and an aqua blue coat over it. The new student was standing next to our teacher. “This is our new student, would you like to introduce yourself?” The girl nodded. 

“I… I'm Madison Everest”

She greeted us. It was the very first day we met.

Ms Riley gestured to Madison to sit next to me. And I was excited, it's been a while since I have another person sitting on that empty desk next to my desk.

I wanted to introduce myself and get to know her so badly but I can't yet. Luckily the class was short today and before we knew it, it was the first break of the day. And Ms Riley put me in charge of giving her a tour of the whole school.

“Hey Madison!” I greeted her. I might've scared her because she flinched. “Oops sorry” I apologised, “no it's fine.. You're Felicity right?” I nodded happily. “Yes you remembered me!” I cheered, giving her a hug, “I uh.. Nice to meet you I guess”. I smiled “alright first you need to grab your bags, I'll show you to your locker” I said, helping her with her backpack.

“Now, are you ready Maddie?” I asked, she nodded.

“Come on Maddie, I'll show you around”. I grabbed her hand and led her out of the classroom.

The hallway was buzzing with students enjoying their breaks and we arrived at the rows of locker, I helped her find her locker and she decided to leave most of her books inside. “This will be your locker for the rest of your school days in this school” I explained “you don't get new lockers every school year?” She asked, confused. I shook my head “no we don't, that's why the school allows us to customise our lockers” I said. “Oh did you do something to yours?” She asked curiously, I smirked.

“Can I see?”

“Sure, once we pass mine I'll show you”. I helped her put her books in the locker and once we’re done, I led her to mine as I also needed to get some books and put some books inside.

I put my locker's combo and opened it. On the 2nd shelf are my books but the 1st shelf above the 2nd is where my other non-school related items are. And the very bottom of my locker is where I hung my roller skates, an extra pair of shoes and sandals and a bag and just other school necessities.

Over the first few days, we became close friends. I tried my best to help her deal with her social skills and even introduced her to my friends. But it's fine!. She may be quiet but she's a nice girl. A pretty one too.

Madison and I found so much in common, we even played the same online game together!. We sent and accepted each other's friend requests obviously. 

She's also very athletic and tomboyish. In our PE class, I luckily got to be in the same group with her and she single handedly carried our whole team and scored 4 to 0 by herself. She's an MVP.

After that, in the locker rooms, I suggested she join one of our school’s sports teams. I still regretted doing that as that's how she met him, Ivan Winston.

Even now I still gag and my blood will boil when I hear, write, or even say his name. I blame myself for it. Because maybe if I hadn't, all that wouldn't have happened to her.

Ivan Winston is our school's typical jock and playboy. I never liked him, he hit on me once but I always rejected his advances. The teachers wouldn't even bat an eye as he treated the students from 10th to 12th grade badly since his father was the principal of this school. And he enjoys slapping that fact to our faces.

But this time it's different, normally he's a playboy yes but this time it's different with how he acts with Madison. At first I thought it was adorable as I've never seen Ivan Winston act that way with any girls. He's more flirtatious with Madison and often tries to be alone in a room with her. But Madison would always avoid him and even rejected his advances.

I get she's pretty and athletic, but in the end she's still my friend and I need to protect her from him. Plus, apparently Amelia Lawson was jealous of this and started to be a bully. She's a coward if you ask me because she would call her stepbrother Nolan Sullivan to help her. 

Anyway, apparently, her online alias is Blank_Ange and she has this cute character persona. And to my shock and surprise, it turns out her father is the owner and CEO of the game.

But that's not the only thing special about her.

It happened when we were biking to my house after school ended.

I think while we were biking, we were laughing so hard when it happened. I accidentally fell off my bike after hitting something, presumably a small rock but I didn't see anything.

Strangely enough, Madison actually apologised, obviously I told her it's not her fault. Anyway, we arrived at my house which is nearby and we did our homework.

It was there when she told me everything. Word to word.

Apparently, she was born with psychic abilities and because of that, her parents shielded her from the outside world ever since she was young. She thought that if I had known that, I would have avoided her. But I don't care, I just thought it's super cool.

I'm just worried about her. And from that day on I would try my best to help her in any way I could. 

She got along well with others in the girl's soccer team and the game design club and she rejected Ivan’s confession to her. It's wonderful.

Anyway, a few months passed and we were given an assignment to make a documentary short film and we were allowed to pick our groups. Our class was uneven so some groups are made out of 3 students and some are just 2. We were in that category.

The due date was until next month, but we decided to start early. So we decided to try our best to finish our script first.

But it's not the creation of the script that took so long. It's that we have to memorise our lines.

Anyway, we managed to finally. Now it's just to set up the time. “What time and when should we record?” She asked me “hmm well we can't on Wednesdays since we both have after school clubs and I'm unavailable on Mondays, I have first med club meetings on Mondays..” “How about this weekend? That way we could finish early and have enough time left to edit and rehearse the scenes just in case it's bad” She said. It's a great idea. I nodded in agreement “wait, do we have to wear our uniforms when recording or…?” She gazed up at me. I just nodded “it's usually like that”.

We planned on doing the recording that Saturday, but it was raining so we had no choice but to delay.

I'm not sure how much time passed but I fell asleep. And only woke up when my phone, which is next to me, rang. Groggily, I grabbed it to see who was calling me. I was expecting my mom or dad to call. But it was Madison. So I picked it up.

“Fel?” I heard her soft voice answer “hey Maddie what's up?” I replied checking the time “Fel where are you? I'm already at the nature park, you know, the one near our school” Then it felt like I was dumped by a bucket of ice cold water.

I had forgotten. Oh shit. “Oh fuck I fell asleep! I'll head there right away!” I panicked quickly running to my closet to grab my school uniform all while still on the phone with Madison. “It's fine Felicity, take your time” Madison tried to reassure me. “Um so is there anything interesting there or just trees?” I asked trying to break the awkward silence.

“Well I saw a family of ducks earlier so we ha-” A loud thump was heard from the other end. This worried me instantly. “Hello? Maddie? Madison? Ange?” I tried. But the call was disconnected. This just made me more worried, so I grabbed the small backpack I used for my med club and quickly rushed to my bike and started biking there as quickly as I could.

Thankfully my house was near the house so I was able to arrive within exactly 12 minutes. But I don't see Madison anywhere. I quickly noticed a car. It was dark so it was hard to make out. But I was able to quickly distinguish it as one of Madison’s brothers’ cars. So I went up to the car and politely knocked on the window.

“Oi Sammy, someone's here!” I could hear someone yelling from within the car. And the window on the driver's seat rolled down. Revealing Samuel, who is to my knowledge, Madison’s eldest brother and on the back seat is Kieran, who is also one of Madison's brothers. I knew, Madison told me about them. So I knew for a fact she has 3 older brothers and one sister.

“W-who are you?” He asked, rubbing his eyes. “I'm Felicity, and I'm wondering if you knew where Madison went?” I asked “oh you're the one she's meeting with?” I nodded. “Last I saw her, she's sitting on that bench” Kieran answered, taking off his headphones and pointing to a bench. But it's dark and I was unable to see anything.

I was still worried so I told them about the noise I heard over the phone. This quickly got their attention, Samuel suddenly isn't so tired anymore. “Wait what?” He turned to Kieran “did you at least see anything?” “It's too dark to see anything,” He replied. I didn't hear the rest of their conversation as everything was just like white noise to me. My anxiety levels skyrocketed and I didn't even notice that the two had left the car.

Until Kieran shook me from my stupor. “Earth to Felicity?” He said “huh? Yeah?” I answered instinctively “you coming?” Samuel asked “you know, to go find Maddie” he continued “ah! right! yeah wait for me!” I quickly rushed to the eldest and Kieran followed along. It was hard to navigate. The soothing light from the moon isn't helping much as it was only able to give us enough light to see each other. We have to navigate in the darkness with the help of our phone flashlights to light our way.

It was quiet, but we were able to hear a strange sound, followed with a loud sound of wood bashing against something. It was loud so we decided to follow it.

I still remember it as clear as daylight. Madison poor Maddie. My eyes would start to tear up just remembering it.

Ivan was kissing someone, I couldn't make out what he was doing but both Samuel and Kieran were both enraged. It scared Ivan and his two friends. It caused Ivan to accidentally drop the person, who I quickly realised is Madison. I threw my bag to the ground and dove in the waters as both Kieran and Samuel dealt with Ivan, Nolan, and Amelia. 

I heard Amelia screaming some garbage because she's a girl they can't lay a finger on her. I wanted to punch her so badly..

I managed to carry Madison to the surface, and I noticed the blood dripping from the right side of her head and that her left coat sleeve was rolled up to her wrist, revealing her cuts. But it doesn't look like self -inflicted wounds.

I quickly took out the first aid kit I had inside my bag and tried my best to stop the bleeding despite her being all wet. 
 
I got on the phone with 911 and putting it on speaker.

“911, what's your emergency?” the operator greeted with a robotic tone. “Please help!” I begged, shouting as I tried but failing to wrap bandages around her wounds. “Ma'am, I need you to calm down and tell me what happened,” they said. “JUST SEND POLICE AND AMBULANCE TO THE NATURE PARK NEAR THE CS ACADEMY! WE'RE NEAR THE LAKE! PLEASE!” I snapped “I've sent them to your location, now please tell me what happened?” They asked. I didn't even answer them. Too busy trying my best to save my bestfriend.

I didn't even notice when officers and the paramedic arrived. The cops had to restrain both Kieran and Samuel from beating Ivan and Nolan to death.

Amelia was adamant about not being arrested. And I had enough of it. I walked up to her. And for once in my life, slap someone's face so hard and loud. Of course that cry baby instantly started to cry. But I ignored her.

The cops put Amelia to a different patrol car while me and Samuel and Kieran shared a patrol car. Unfortunately, both Ivan and Nolan were too injured that the cops legally weren't able to put cuffs on their wrists. They put them and Madison in separate ambulances.

And me and the boys were driven to the police station for interrogation.

And that's what happened. But that's not the cause of CS to close down permanently. It's what happened a few months after Madison’s funeral which both girls and boy's soccer teams(excluding Ivan and Nolan who were kicked out) and the game developer club attended her funeral to pay their respect and to grieve for her.

However, the greatest thing to ever happen so far after Madison's death was when her father, who turns out to be a millionaire(unsurprised to me) and has more power than Ivan's father, threatened to buy the school and sue our principal.

Everyone, all of Ivan's victims all started speaking up. And in the end Mr Winston was forced to kick his own son out of his own school. But I don't think that Mr Everest or any of us were thrilled about this, his punishment is too light.

So without any hesitation, Mr and Mrs Everest called the cops. And because Ivan is already at the legal age, he was arrested and booked to prison.

However both Amelia and Nolan were still students but now everyone would avoid them like the plague.

I should get to the point now on why CS closed. It was a normal day at CS. I placed a bouquet full of Madison's favourite flowers on her desk. There's no classes as everyone is still in shock about what happened. When we suddenly heard a loud scream from outside our classroom.

Ms Riley was the first to dash out the door and gasped. Me and my other classmates were curious so we followed her and saw it.

Blood was pouring from under the lockers. Another teacher quickly called 911 as Ms Riley ushered us back to our classrooms. I sat on my desk as usual.

I  raised my hand. I asked to use the bathroom and Ms Riley nodded, she's being more sympathetic than usual since she knows I was there when it happened. I could tell she's a bit sad from her eyes. But I can't blame her. Madison was such a good student and a joy to have in our class.

She was our class’ resident cool girl. Until now many of us still call her that.

I don't want to go to the bathroom, I just wanted to take a walk and maybe calm myself down a bit. I walked past the gym when I saw it. By it I meant her. I'm unsure on how it happened, but Amelia’s body was skewered to the gym's ground with a volleyball net pole and only a few inches off the ground. Only her long bleached hair reached the ground. Her stomach was wide open and her intestines were dangling outside her stomach. I screamed as loud as I can and ran back to tell Ms Riley who looked horrified at what I just told her.

Thankfully now the cops had arrived. So we led them to the gym where they were also horrified by the gruesome discovery. And it turns out, that under those lockers.. Is the body of Nolan Sullivan. It was very hard to identify him as his facial structure and entire body was crushed by the lockers.

However it's not just that. Because later in the news, apparently Ivan was also found dead in gruesome mannerism. It was more gruesome actually. The guards found him crucified with his hands being nailed to a wall, which hung his upper body and his intestines dangled down uselessly. His lower half had been reduced to nothing but blood and small tissues was the only thing left of them and his genitalia was placed inside his chest, replacing his heart which had been put into his mouth as a makeshift gag.

The other prisoners claimed they didn't see anyone. But one claimed that Ivan mentioned something about a girl with glowing magenta eyes following him. But when he turned to see where Ivan was pointing at, he saw nothing.

But I guess they all deserved it.

It has been a month since it happened. I rarely touched the game. But sometimes I swore I would hear her now distorted voice coming from my headphones and even from inside my head. But it's not threatening. It was soothing.

“It's not your fault, please stop blaming yourself”

I would hear inside my head. I saw her profile picture on my friends’ list.

Blank_Ange. For a strange reason I felt as if the avatar was looking directly at me. Into my soul. But it's impossible! Right? The avatar is something from the game, therefore within the digital or virtual world, it can't possibly interact with me, who is in the real world. Right?.

I drew pictures as the soothing voice continued to interact with me.

And her voice helped me eventually go to sleep. But even then I heard her voice just more distorted. That just said:

“Sweet dreams”.
