Throughout the decades, everyone who has been at sea had a story to tell, or a legend to share. Sometimes plausible, and sometimes unbelievable. However, I am sure you have never heard of the legend of the Sleeping Whales - a tale of unknown origins, and phenomenon reported by humans across the globe. 

  
The sea is a plane of mixed emotions upon our planet. Some fear it, some hate it, some love it, and some are indifferent about it. These emotions can come from different experiences, or lack of them. Witnessing the beauty of the coral reefs, finding out about the alien creatures at the bottom. Never seeing the waves with their two eyes while standing on burning-hot sand on a beach, being attacked by a fish as a youngling, taking a cruise, scuba diving next to peaceful filter feeders, studying marine biology, living on a ship, being born on an island, feeding the seals, hearing songs at night, the bioluminescent lights of creatures washing up on the shore... or finding the sleeping Whales.

  
As you swim in the ocean through the october night, and the moon light reflects on the dark ocean waves, there's a range of emotions from different circumstances, but they all transform into quiet calm upon seeing the Sleeping Whales. You stand at the deck of the ship, remembering everything awaiting on land, you are struck with relaxation. Your brain flips a switch, and your muscles lose all their weight. You shrug, snicker, smile, and grin. You see them. The whales. A vibrant blue light shines from beneath the night waters illuminating gigantic shapes. It seems warm. Is it warm? No, but it can't be. Its middle of the night. But... you feel the warmth. You don't know how but you do. You want to be warmer. Your worries wash away. You NEED more of this comfort. You need to be in peace just like the Whales.  
You put on a scuba diving costume as your crew is asleep, and jump from the deck of the ship. You may not know how to swim, but you know the peace does not lie. You float through the salty waters, which are suddenly illuminated as if it's day. Your ship floats above you, not leaving a shadow. You know it's abnormal, but your brain can't bring itself to make you care as you float to the shapes - a field of sleeping whales. Majestic giants, which stand facing the night sky without movement. You remember the feeling of the warmth of your bed after a snowy day, the comfort of the fireplace, the times you woke up in bed with your lover and just couldn't let go. This feeling - This comfort - it's the strongest it's ever been. Your body feels warm, you don't have a care in the world about your ship, crew, family, job and life. You understand the Whales. Your oxygen does not run out, as you float further and further and FURTHER down. It's so close. You smile. Your heart beats slowly. You feel the warm summer air. Childhood smells fill your nostrils, and the memory of your family and friends singing happy birthday at the theater for your special day fills your ears. This is everything your life has climaxed towards - perfection of your spirit.

  
You stand in a field of giants, hundreds upon hundreds of Whales floating like crops. They are the most beautiful things in your entire life - perfection, just like your brain, which races with repeats of the same key words: comfort, warmth, childhood, Peace, and Whales. Desperate to find a proper way to convey and understand the overwhelming, cosmic feeling covering your body in an invisible blanket devoid of stains. You position yourself between two of them, their motionless form towers over you. You look up, onto the stars. The clearest stars you have ever seen. Each light in indescribable detail. Distant galaxies as visible as your neighbors house. You're mesmerized, and the sky darkens. You feel the same peace as when you fall asleep in a dark room after a nine hour hike, even if you had not moved more than a kilometer in the last twenty four hours. It darkens, your muscles lose all feeling, any itch or pain or tickling feeling vanishes. You're a soul in an ocean. No size, no restraints, no needs. You're at the peak of your life, in the field of Sleeping Whales...
