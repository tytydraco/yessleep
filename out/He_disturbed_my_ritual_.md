I awake once more.

I've been waiting for this. The time has come once again.

It's not so often he gives me my long overdue gifts.

Excited to start, I head to the mirror to greet my lovely new look. I gaze over and... 

Huh... I'm... clean. 

My hands too, are clean.

That's weird. 

Well, I can't let that stop me from enjoying this. I move over to my closet. Slightly unsure about what's to come. I pop open the hidden compartment; eager to wear my new used clothes. 

I open it and... 

Nothing's there. 

Something's... wrong. 

Maybe he was in a hurry. That's ok. I hope he still came through for the rest of it. 

Time to make the signature dish. I walk to the fridge door. What if he forgot about me this time? I open it.

What the fuck? 

No new additions? 

Fine. I'll use some left overs. 

I sit in my kitchen naked, all clean and eating old crap. My day is not going as planned.

I turn on the TV to the local news channel.

Channel 58: "Good evening. In local news, residents of Maple Street are advised of upcoming roadworks starting next Monday. The annual town clean-up day is set for Saturday, volunteers encouraged to participate. And in weather, expect partly cloudy skies with a high of 72 degrees Fahrenheit. Back to you."

NO! NO! NOOO!

HE CAN'T DO THIS TO ME. 

I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

*Breath in*

I contain myself. 

It's okay. 

Looks like he didn't take over properly. 

He disturbed my ritual. 

I need him to wake the fuck up and do what he's supposed to do. I can always try again.

Right?

I get up and fixate on the wall in front of me.

This time I need to get it right. Perhaps I have to commit to it more. He'll definitely appreciate this. 

I begin sprinting as fast as I can and *bang* my head into the wall.

Blackness...

I awake once more. 

I've been waiting for this. 

This time it has to work. It has to.

I slowly creep into my mirror's vision...

OH YES. BLOOD ALL OVER. MY HANDS ARE ALL RED. 

I skip over to the closet giddy as a schoolgirl.

I open the hidden compartment. 

Oh wow. 

Stockings and a onesuit. 

This must've been a hooker's. 

My favourite.

He really knows me.

I slip into the lingerie and feel godly. 

Time for the signature dish!!! 

I glide on the ground with my new fit. Aiming for the fridge door. Time to open this bad boy...

*Creak*

Oh wow.

That's a smaller brain than usual. Must've been a dumb bitch.

I sit in the kitchen all pretty, bloody and munching on meaty goodness. I turn on the TV to the local news channel:

Chanel 58: "Breaking news: Another victim has been found in the ongoing series of murders plaguing our city. Police are urging residents to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity. Stay tuned for updates on this developing story."

Ohhhhh yes...

Everything's back to normal.
