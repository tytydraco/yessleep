This is not a story with a happy ending. This is a not a story in which good triumphs over evil and our heroine rides off into the sunset, happily ever after. This is a story about vengeance.

I am, for better or worse, a transgender woman. If this fact was not relevant to my tale, I would not be sharing this particular piece of information. I am one of those lucky few who are able to pass as my preferred sex, having been blessed from youth with a short stature, high-pitched voice, and a relatively soft face. Combining my latent physique with hormone treatment, a little makeup, and some concealing clothing has allowed me to live my life fairly comfortably without much fear of transphobic violence.

I used to live in a one bedroom apartment with my roommate, Lucy, another trans woman. Unlike myself, Lucy was frankly unlikely to ever pass. This isn't to say she wasn't beautiful, if anything she was the prettier of the two of us, but even from a distance one could generally tell she wasn't cis. Lucy was quite tall, about 6'5" if I recall correctly, with a square jaw and broad shoulders upon which were draped her bleach blonde hair. People sometimes assumed we were dating, but we were never more than just friends.

The apartment wasn't great, it had a persistent cockroach problem which the landlord patently refused to investigate, central heating didn't work, and it was in a bad part of town. However, between the two of us we were barely able to afford it, despite Lucy being chronically unemployed. I worked as a gas station clerk on the night shift, and my workplace was only a few blocks away, which let me get away with neither of us owning a car. I wouldn't have been able to afford both rent and car insurance anyway.

Like I said, we lived in a bad part of town. All the buildings seemed several decades out of time and were consistently in ill-repair. Even the newer constructions quickly seemed to get infected by whatever architectural disease permeated this place, swiftly covered in a layer of grime and graffiti. The air always stunk of cigarette smoke and sewage.

On my way to work I'd often count the spray painted swastikas I noticed on the way there, and the number frequently increased, the tide of hate only occasionally turned when some intrepid street artist covered it up with something else. Despite the half-hearted attempts at obscuring them with murals and the like, the swastikas would keep on appearing, like some sort of poisonous dandelion. It is far easier to spray a swastika than a work of art.

The creators of the spray painted swastikas were well known to Lucy and I. It was a local neo-nazi gang, I'm sure they had their own pompous name for themselves, something like "the Aryan Warriors" or "Sons of Evropa". We just called them the skinheads. They were the old fashioned sort of neo-nazi, not the besuited alt-righters with their undercuts and podcasts. These were the sort of people who had no real ideology other than hating anyone different from them. The skinheads wore all black, leather jackets adorned with iron crosses, swastikas, sig runes, and all other manner of hate. They were covered with tattoos of similar motifs, with their heads shaved to allow more space for ink. Aside from the occasional degrading catcall I didn't generally have to worry about them too much, as to them I simply appeared to be any other white woman, but for Lucy they were a nightmare.

Besides Jewish people and anyone whose skin color was anything darker than a sheet of printer paper, sexual minorities were a favorite target of the skinheads. Lucy's obvious trans status made her a frequent subject of harassment. When she was out in town, looking for work or running errands and whatnot, she would sometimes be followed and screamed at by the fascists. She generally tried to stick to crowds, and always carried around some pepper spray just in case their threats turned out to be less than empty.

I was heading out for work one evening when I noticed Lucy was headed out the door with me. I asked where she was off to at this time of night, and she said she'd gotten a new job. I was a little surprised she hadn't told me until now, but shrugged it off. We walked a bit together and chatted until our paths diverged, and that was that.

This continued for a few months. Lucy's schedule seemed erratic to say the least. Sometimes she would leave hours before me, sometimes she would still be at the apartment when I headed off for work. Occasionally she wouldn't be back until noon. However, she seemed to be getting steady money, so I didn't question it too much. We were friends, sure, but Lucy had always been a rather private person, except when she was drunk, which was quite rare.

It was during one of these rare occasions of drunkenness when she first told me about her high school baseball career.

We were chatting about something or another when she'd received a text from some acquaintance, the text tone was the familiar baseball "Charge!" fanfare, the sort of thing an organist would play back in the old days of the sport.

"Odd choice for a ringtone", I said, half expecting her to simply respond "yep" and leave it at that.

"I used to play baseball y'know" she said, her words slurring a bit as she swirled what was left of her drink in one hand, absentmindedly staring off into space. "In high school I mean. Used to be pretty good too. Was gonna continue on into college, but," she hiccuped, "y'know, wasn't really room for a gal like me on the women's team, didn't want a trans girl out-competing everyone else."

I nodded, surprised by her willingness to talk about this. I gestured for her to continue.

"Well, I was left with a choice. Detransition or quit. It would have been really awkward to detrans right after coming out to the whole family, so I stopped playing. Of course, it wasn't like they understood the decision. My folks now just thought I was a pervert *and* a loser." At this, she began to start laughing uncontrollably, tears flowing down her face. I paid for her tab and escorted her back home.

\---

I wasn't too surprised when I came home one morning to find her gone. I figured she must have just had one of her longer days at work. It wasn't until I was getting ready to head back to work the next day and noticed that she was still gone that I started to worry.

On my way to work I sent Lucy a text, asking her when she expected she'd be back. At this point I was about halfway to the gas station, a couple blocks away from the apartment. I sent the message and heard a familiar text tone from the nearby alleyway. An old stadium organ playing out a fanfare.

"Lucy?" I called out, looking into the dark red brick lined alley for signs of motion. Nothing.

I crept forward, reaching for the small pocket knife I kept on me. Something felt off. I knew that in any sort of actual defensive situation the tiny knife wouldn't be much use, but it comforted me in a way. It gave me the feeling I at least had some sort of fighting chance, regardless of how slim.

I stepped into the alleyway proper, flicking on my phone's flashlight and nearly dropping it when I saw what it revealed.

Blood.

That was the first thing I noticed, the red catching the eye as it reflected the glare of my phone's flashlight. Bright red, cherry red, very fresh. More blood than I'd ever seen before.

I started to feel like I was in a dream, and finally my eyes deigned to inform me of the rest of the gory scene. A figure lay slumped against a wall, bleach blonde hair stained pink with ichor. It was Lucy. She wasn't breathing. She must have been stabbed a dozen times.

In a daze, I looked up at the wall of the building to be greeted with a spray painted swastika.

\---

I called the police after a few minutes, and they took care of the body. They told me they'd send someone around to follow up with me. I sent a text to my manager simply stating "Roommate killed. Can't work tonight". I went home and stared at the wall until the sun came up. She must have been killed shortly before I saw the body, the blood hadn't even congealed. I wondered where she had been the whole day beforehand. Was she kidnapped? Did they torture her before they murdered her?

I don't remember much of the next few days after that. I know that the police did send someone to ask some questions. I know he was the person who informed me what I had already started to suspect; Lucy had been a prostitute.

I didn't feel anything after learning this information.

We hadn't been particularly close, If I'm being entirely honest with myself we were more acquaintances than friends really by the end. We used to be much closer, but as my transition progressed and I started to be seen primarily under the label of woman rather than the label of transgender, we grew apart somewhat. I don't know if she distanced herself from me out of some sort of jealousy or if I distanced myself from her out of a desire to hide my own transness. Either way it didn't matter, the end result was the same. I felt guilt that I didn't feel more sorrow. There was loss there, sure, sadness, but not enough grief to block out the feeling of emptiness that you get from seeing someone's mutilated corpse. From the voice in your head whispering It could have been you.

I checked the obituaries, looking for her. There was a newspaper rack at work that I used to ignore, but I began to make a habit of looking through it. About a week afterwards I found her.

It was written under her deadname, the picture one chosen from before her transition, when she was still doing high school baseball. I was lucky to have recognized her from her last name. She was referred to with the wrong pronouns, and no mention of her transition was present anywhere in the paragraphs mourning her loss. Apparently she was buried with a baseball bat.

\---

A month passed.

I managed to get a new roommate, some stoner named Fred. The apartment reeked of weed but he paid the rent on time and didn't bother me much. The strangest part to me was how little things changed. I went to work, I came home, I slept, I read, I ate. The only thing that was missing was Lucy, and due to her line of work she had kept unusual hours anyway. I began to settle back into my usual routine, to almost forget about the murder.

I was walking home from work, lost in thought. I didn't hear the footsteps, didn't notice I was being followed until it was too late.

I turned around to find that my pursuers were three of the skinheads, with their leather jackets and fascist tattoos. One of them had on a cheap replica SS officer's cap, the silver *totenkopf* gleaming slightly in the illumination of a nearby streetlight. I reached for my pocket knife, but before I knew it the other two had grabbed me by the arms and were dragging me off into a familiar alleyway.

I started to scream, but the capped skinhead, who must have been the ringleader, covered my mouth with his hand.

"Woah, easy there", he said, a hideous shark-like grin crossing his face, "we're not gonna hurt you." One of skinheads holding my arms down snickered, muttering "Not like how we hurt your freak boyfriend at least."

My heart felt as though it had stopped. My blood ran cold. The man covering my mouth laughed when he saw my eyes widen with fear. These were the murderers. These were the people who killed Lucy. If they didn't want to kill me, what did they want with me?

It wasn't until the leader of the bunch reached down for the fly of my jeans that I realized what was happening.

*Oh God,* I thought, *They want to rape me. They don't know I'm trans.*

I knew that once they pulled aside my gaff and figured out what I was that I would become another bloody corpse in the same alleyway. Another body for the police to ask questions about. I knew that for all my efforts to hide what I was, it would end in the same way as it did for Lucy.

My train of thought was interrupted by the sound of metal dragging on pavement. It was coming from further down the alleyway.

The skinheads noticed it too, and ceased their hyena-like cackling at my terror to look towards the noise. The light from the streetlamp didn't penetrate far enough into the alley to allow a view of its source.

"Who's there?" called out the wannabe SS officer, flicking out a switchblade as he said so. There was no reply. Just the dragging of metal against pavement, getting closer, accompanied now by the faint, occasional *thud* of shambling footsteps.

"Fuck it, George, come with me, let's teach this freak some manners", muttered the ringleader, motioning for one of the other skinheads to follow him. He nodded and handed me fully over to the third skinhead, putting on some brass knuckles he was carrying in his coat pocket. I tried to struggle free now that there was just one person holding me, but I felt the barrel of a gun pressed into my back. "I wouldn't do that if I were you", said a voice disgustingly close to my ear, my captor's cigarette-smelling breath wafting past my nose like a reeking fog.

The two skinheads moved out of sight into the shadows as the dragging and shuffling footsteps drew closer. There was a pause in the dragging, followed by someone crying out "What the fu-" before being interrupted with the sound of metal smashing into flesh and bone. An ear-splitting *crack*, sickening to hear. And then another. And another. In between the crunching, I could hear gurgling screams.

I saw the guy in the cap start to stumble out of the shadows towards us, blood dripping from his nose and mouth, before he tripped and was dragged back in, screaming. His cries were silenced with one last resounding *crack*.

The man holding me let go, and I fell to the ground, shaken and dazed. I've never been particularly good in stressful situations. I had a tendency to freeze.

"I've got a gun", said the skinhead, in a voice I'm sure he meant to be intimidating. He sounded like a scared teenager.

Out from the darkness came the dragging and shuffling once again, finally coming close enough for me to see the source.

The details came in flashes, my brain not working well enough to process coherent images all at once. A moldering, dirt-stained black suit. Messy bleach blonde hair hastily cut to a masculine style. A dented metal baseball bat held in one rotting hand. It was Lucy.

The skinhead unloaded his entire magazine into her, but it didn't do him any good. Bullets do little to harm those who are already dead. Lunging forward with uncanny speed, like an old film played at the wrong framerate, Lucy's corpse swung the bat at the man's head, instantly knocking him to the ground. Once he was prone, she began to mechanically, stiffly beat him to death, continuing long after he stopped moving.

I don't know what happened next. I blacked out. When I woke up, it was still dark, and Lucy was gone. I was alone with 3 corpses in an alley. I stumbled back to my apartment, trembling like a leaf in the breeze, and made an anonymous tip to the police.

I found myself recalling something I must have read in a book somewhere. There are stories of people who were killed and didn't receive proper burial rites, who came back from the grave to get revenge on those who wronged them. Victims of hanging coming down from the gallows to strangle those who strung them up.

I'd say being buried under a name that isn't yours sure as Hell doesn't count as proper burial rites, wouldn't you?
