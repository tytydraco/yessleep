Have you ever knocked on a window? I guess if you have you probably did it to get somebody’s attention on the other side, right? Whether you were on the outside looking in or the inside looking out. A knock is a means of getting someone’s attention, getting them to look at you, to let you in.



"So, do you always leave your blinds up at night?"

 

Dan sat on my couch like he’d been sitting there his entire life. He was just that kind of guy, I guess. He was so comfortable in his own skin that no matter where he was, he was always at home. We were opposites in that way. I was so introverted it could be painful at times, but something about Dan inspired some kind of ridiculous courage in me, and I often found myself in increasingly bizarre situations thanks to his influence. Meanwhile he had decided I was someone he could confide in. I guess it was because I didn’t have any standards he needed to live up to. His stupid grin was enough for me. I was someone he could always talk to, someone who wouldn’t be disappointed in him. We were close, a regular Sam and Frodo, but with less crying.

 

Despite all this it had actually been nearly two years since I’d seen him. Work and girlfriends seemed to always get in the way. Okay, his girlfriends got in *his* way, my reluctance to go outside unless it was completely necessary got in *my* way.

 

So as much as an unannounced guest kind of pissed me off, I couldn’t help but laugh at the figure I found in my doorway that Saturday night.

 

A pounding at my door tore me from my favorite anime. It sounded just like the SWAT team were attempting to kick it in. I figured it must be my downstairs neighbor complaining about my cat again, so I swung my door open without checking, fully prepared to listen to a lecture about responsibility and offer multiple quiet apologies. Instead, I was greeted with Dan’s sheepish snaggletoothed grin. Precariously balancing two large pizzas in his right hand, and gripping a case of beer in the other, he gave me a ‘wassup’ nod.

 

“Sorry, for kicking your door down, man. My hands are kind of full. Can I come in?”

 

I laughed and stepped aside to let him through. The pizza smelled good and was definitely more appetizing than the sorry excuse for a tv dinner I had languishing in the freezer.

 

While he set everything down on my coffee table, I shut the door and grabbed some paper towels and my only two plates. I looked over my kitchen counter as Dan sank into the couch, quickly making himself at home, and I finally got a good look at him under my apartment’s overhead lights.

 

To put it bluntly he looked like crap. His normally bright, attentive eyes had big bags under them, and their color seemed almost dull. His five o’clock shadow made his sunken cheeks seem even more gaunt. Hell, even his normally thick brown hair sat dry and lifeless atop his skull like an old dusty bearskin rug.

 

Something had clearly been bothering him, he looked like he hadn’t slept in a while, and besides, he knew how I was, he’d never show up without texting first. I figured he’d tell me about whatever was up with him when he was ready. In the meantime, whatever it was hadn’t seemed to affect his overall personality or his barking laugh.

 

So, for what must have been nearly an hour, we shot the shit, scarfed down too much pizza, and drank most of the beer. We were laughing about some stupid movie we had seen the last time we hung out when I killed my fifth can of beer and set it down with a hollow tang.

 

The sound seemed to make both of us finally pause. I leaned back in my recliner and looked thoughtfully at my ceiling. I remember thinking, *here we go, he’s going to tell me what happened to him. It’s either a girl or work.*

 

“So, do you always leave your blinds up at night?”

 

“Tha-what?” *Oops*, I thought, ‘*that’s rough, buddy,’ probably isn’t the appropriate response to that question*.

 

“Do you always leave your blinds up at night?”

 

I sighed, “No. Well, yeah. I told you I picked up that kitten a few years back, right?”

 

He nodded.

 

“Turns out her favorite activity is running window to window like her tail’s on fire, chasing birds, or whatever.”

 

“They call that the zoomies, don’t they? When cats kick it into warp speed and make like the Enterprise?”

 

“Yup, usually late at night or early in the morning too. I’ve already gotten a few complaints about it from the lady below me.”

 

“Well, you can’t really control that right?”

 

“Right,” I said and got up to stretch my legs.

 

“About the windows, though. You’re not worried about privacy?”

 

I stepped up to the living room window and strained to look out against the glare. Another busy Saturday night, alright. I leaned on the cat tree I had setup next to it and could just make out the sounds of the cars and a few shouts that came wailing up to my lofty windowpane. I sighed and let my eyes refocus, catching Dan’s reflection staring back at me. What I saw caused the hairs on the back of my neck to stand up.

 

His already lanky frame seemed even more stretched out, like taffy that’s been pulled too thin and is about to break. And if you held that taffy up like a sword and let it curl over at an odd angle, you’d have the exact shape of his back as he hunched over at the edge of my couch. His elbows rested on his knees, long hands with long fingers dangling loosely from too skinny wrists.

 

He had the hollow eyes of a man dying of thirst in some godforsaken desert. A man who, upon looking up, sees an oasis. His eyes had that kind of reluctant hope, as if his salvation was near at hand yet he dared not believe it because it might just as easily be a cruel mirage. The eyes that stared back at me through that distorted reflection were desperate.

 

I turned around slowly, swallowing my fear.

 

Dan sat there quietly, haggard, but still Dan. My oldest and dearest friend sat there and the swell in my heart dispelled the sudden creeping dread, and it slithered away back into the night.

 

I shook my head, “I’m on the top floor, who’s gonna look?”

 

I chuckled nervously and Dan’s face split back into that crooked grin once again.

 

“Okay, I just never knew you were one of those weirdo exhibitionist types.”

 

“Hey-“

 

“Ya think ya know a guy, right? I mean I know it’s been a little while, but hey, I’m glad you’re so comfortable with yourself,” he laughed his barking laugh.

 

My face was warm with embarrassment, but I started laughing too.

 

“Aw, shuddup, it’s not like I’m giving anyone a show here.”

 

“Whatever you say, man. I’m not judging,” Dan shrugged and cracked open another beer.

 

Like salve soothes a burn, our shared laughter relieved my morbid imagination. I must have been more drunk than I thought I supposed. I swept the sweat on my forehead back through my hair and felt my shoulders relax.

 

Without thinking, I rapped my knuckles twice against the glass, “Seriously, if I could teach my cat to open the blinds herself I would. The only reason I’m comfortable with this at all is because I’m so high up. You should know, even on the second-floor y-”

 

BANG BANG

 

I nearly jumped out of my skin, and a split-second later I was bolting to the other side of the room, instinctively putting my recliner between me and the window.

 

“What the hell was that?!” Dan shouted, trying to wipe beer off his face and shirt and failing at both.

 

 “Maybe somebody’s shooting off fireworks?” I offered weakly.

 

“Damn, that close to your window? I didn’t see a flash…” he coughed.

 

I hadn’t seen one either and I had been right next to it when it happened. Dan inched his way over and looked outside, still patting at his beer-soaked shirt.

 

“Hey, turn out the light,” he breathed. “I can’t see anything!”

 

I flicked off the lights and watched Dan’s back silhouetted by the city lights.

 

“Well?”

 

“No, nothing.”

 

“Are you sure?”

 

“Yeah… wait. Something’s not right.”

 

My eyes bore holes in the back of Dan’s head.

 

“That’s the main road, right?”

 

I gulped, “Yeah, why?”

 

“There isn’t a car anywhere in sight.”

 

“What?!” I hissed.

 

“I’m not kidding! I don’t see any people either!”

 

I thought he was playing a prank on me and I moved to stomp over there, but with every step forward, I found it more and more difficult to breathe. My chest tightened and I could feel my pulse in my ears. I made it to the coffee table before my legs refused to go any further.

 

Dan wasn’t that far away, his head brushing up against the drawn blinds as he smooshed his forehead against the glass. The dim yellow light played across his skin, highlighting the shape of his skull. The dread I felt earlier shimmied back up my spine.

 

On reflex my hand shot to the base of my neck, but instead of some black leech all I felt was my own sweat streaming down my back.

 

I backed away slowly and mumbled something about checking on my cat. Dan waved a hand dismissively and grabbed the window frame, craning his head this way and that. It took all my willpower to not sprint to my bedroom.

 

I made it to my bed before my knees gave out. Wiping my face on the sheets, I let their coolness soothe me for a moment before I switched on the lamp. The stark walls of my bedroom comforted me, and I breathed deeply through my nose before softly calling out my cat’s name.

 

She was a shy cat in the best of times, and I figured she must have been frightened by the loud noise. Thankfully, my room was pretty bare, and the only place she could really hide was under my bed. I lifted up the comforter and peeked under. Two big yellow eyes stared back at me accompanied by a squeaking meow.

 

There really isn’t any getting her out of there when she’s scared so I sat cross-legged on the floor and gently whispered to her to calm her nerves. She licked my hand in response, and I scratched behind her ear.

 

BANG BANG BANG

 

“Shit!” I yelped as my cat scurried deeper beneath the bed, and I banged my elbow on the bedframe.

 

I stood back up quickly and hurried back into the living room.

 

Dan was sprawled across the floor, his face contorted into a death mask as he stared up at my window.

 

“The hell happened?” I huffed as I ran over to him.

 

His eyes never left the window as he kind of crab-walked closer to me. He was paler than I’d ever seen him, and his eyes were as wide as saucers.

 

“Something’s out there, man. I don’t know what, but something.” He swallowed hard before continuing and I could see every vein in his throat as he did so. “I remembered that just before it happened the first time you sort of tapped at the window, remember?” I nodded and he continued, “Well, I sort of gave it three quick knocks, just to see, ya know? Like, on a whim?”

 

He turned to look at me for the first time, and I grimaced. He looked like hell. His forehead was pouring sweat, his eyes round and unblinking, the sparse ambient light made his skin look jaundiced.

 

“Christ, man, you look like you saw a ghost!”

 

“NO!”

 

I flinched at his sudden aggression.

 

“No! It wasn’t a ghost! There’s no way a ghost would look like, like that THING!”

 

“What thing, man? I’m on the top floor; there’s no way somebody is climbing walls like some twisted spider-man or something just to fuck with us.”

 

“Damn it! It wasn’t a guy either! It wasn’t human shaped, do you understand?”

 

A chill ran up my spine as I shook my head. Wasn’t human? I felt a lump in my throat as I realized what I had to ask next, “Is it still out there?”

 

“I… I don’t think so.”

 

The slippery panic I’d been dealing with throughout the night suddenly engulfed me, sticking to me like wet clothes, a terror that made my limbs heavy. Almost involuntarily, I began backing away from both Dan and the window.

 

“M-maybe you should go home,” I said thickly. My tongue felt like it was glued to the roof of my mouth. “I mean, nothing like this has ever happened to me before. If it’s a ghost or a prank or whatever, there’s no way, nothing’s ever happened like this the whole time I’ve lived here.”

 

Dan gave me a betrayed look, “Are you trying to say it’s because of me?”

 

“No, I mean, I don’t know… “

 

Dan shook his head, “Do you… believe me?”

 

Neither one of us spoke for a few seconds as I thought about it. What was I supposed to believe? That some creature was outside my window? Come on, this isn’t a movie. No, Dan had a couple too many and maybe I had too.

 

“Look, it’s late. We’re not exactly sober. I dunno, maybe you’re just seeing things. Maybe all of this has a perfectly reasonable explanation, and it will all make sense in the morning.”

 

“Just seeing things? What the fuck, dude?” Dan’s jaw clenched. “Knock on your window again.”

 

“What? Wh-”

 

“I dare you, you fucking bitch, knock on your window right the fuck now.”

 

“Dan, I’m not going to knock on the window. Let me make some coffee or something and we can come down from this.”

 

“COWARD!” He bellowed.

 

I’d never seen him like this. He’d gone from sickly pale to beet red and his teeth clenched so tightly I thought they’d crack. I genuinely thought he was going to punch me, but instead he scrambled up onto his feet and made for the window.

 

“Dan! What the hell are you doing?”

 

“If you won’t knock, maybe I will! Maybe you should see what I saw! Maybe then you’ll believe me, you asshole!”

 

I’ve never been so scared in my whole life as much as I was in that moment. Whatever he saw, I didn’t want to see it, I couldn’t see it. Every fiber in my being screamed at me that if I saw it, I would die.

 

I was on him in an instant.

 

Fear gave me strength unknown, and I wrestled him to the ground. My mind flashed back to Dan’s reflection in the window, and it gave me resolve as I hurled my fist into his face, wheezing like some beast.

 

Dan was caught off guard and never really stood a chance. I don’t know how many times I hit him before my mindless terror subsided, but his nose had been broken, and my knuckles were cut and bruised. I fell over exhausted, our ragged breathing filling the darkness.

 

Seconds felt like hours, and minutes, days as we lay there. My mind was numb with exhaustion, that night’s rollercoaster of apprehension leaving me in a malaise. In the purple shadows my eyes remained focused on the rectangular beam of light that came from that damned window. A shape that seemed to grow brighter as I stared.

 

Somehow all I could think about was how Dan’s blood was going to stain the carpet.

 

Surprisingly, Dan was the first to recover. I winced when I saw his arm move, but it was for nothing. Dan sniffled and coughed as he used my couch to hoist himself up, a spider scrambling for purchase. I just stared, not really knowing what else to do.

 

He looked at the window again and that powerful dread came rushing back, only this time I was too exhausted, incapable of motion as I gaped at him from below. My body twitched as the adrenaline pumped through my blood, urging me to move, to… kill him. To kill him before he could summon whatever it was that only he had seen, and yet, somehow, I feared in an intense primordial fashion. An existential threat from humanity’s infancy.

 

Dan wiped his nose and looked down at me. He gave me a mean kick to the ribs and I turned over in pain, I saw blackness closing in but somehow didn’t faint. From the corner of my eye I saw him step over me and walk out the door, shutting it slowly behind him.

 

I closed my eyes and finally passed out.

 

I woke up to my cat licking the cuts on my hands and gave a short groan. She looked up at me for a second before going back to her licking.

 

“Get off me, girl.” I said, waving her away. She whined at me before jumping on the table to sniff the leftover pizza.

 

My phone told me it was around 1AM and I shuffled into the kitchen to wash Dan’s blood off my hands. I vaguely remembered reading something about getting an infection from cutting your hands on someone’s teeth, so I figured I’d better use the antibacterial dish soap.

 

After bandaging my cuts and tossing my cat a few treats to get her mind off the pizza I inched open my front door to look out into the hallway. The elevator door reflected the flickering fluorescent lights as I thought about Dan making his way home in the state I’d left him in.

 

I gave him a call, but his phone was off so all I got was his voicemail.

 

Thinking I’d text him in the morning, I leaned against the doorframe to my kitchen and stared out the window.

 

After several minutes I found the courage to walk up to it. I kept expecting that sick irrational fear to well up inside me again, that disgusting, murderous fear that had driven me to nearly kill my oldest friend, but it never came.

 

I stood there, my nose nearly touching the glass and looked out into the abyss… and nothing stared back. A cop car drove past and a late-night bicyclist in a hoodie crossed the street. His reflectors flashing in my eyes made me wince and I shut the blinds for the first time in ages. I marched to every other window and did the same.

 

I shut off the light in my bedroom and sunk into my bed. What happened? What *was* that? What *had* Dan seen? My cat hopped onto my chest, snapping me out of it. I scratched her head, and her purrs lulled me into a fitful sleep.

 

I didn’t dream that night, or if I did, I don’t remember.

 

The next morning, I woke up and immediately went into my routine. The cuts on my hands were my only reminder of the night before. Without even thinking about it, I opened the blinds again. My cat was practically tearing them apart to get at my windowsill so… I opened them. Just like that. No hesitation. It all felt like a dream.

 

As my cat settled on the windowsill I looked down below. The sun was bright, and the main street was bustling with early morning commuters. I ran my fingers across the windowpane, but there was nothing to see, no evidence of what could have shaken the window like that. I gave my cat a pet on the head and hurried off to work.

 

When I came back home that day, I drove around my apartment complex a few times to see if there was any damage to the building, or any sign as to what could have happened the night before. I saw nothing, nothing at all. None of my neighbors said anything to me about it, and I was too scared to ask.

 

Life moved on, days passed, and as time passed the more that night began to feel like a dream. A few days later I shot Dan a text but got no response.

 

Yesterday something finally happened. I got a call from Dan’s mom.

 

In all the time I’ve known Daniel, I think I’ve only ever spoken to her a handful of times. Just something brief and in passing. She asked me if I’d seen Dan recently. My stomach sank. I could hear the worry in her voice. I told her I’d seen him last weekend but hadn’t heard from him since. I asked her if anything was wrong.

 

She told me that she hadn’t heard from him in a month, so she went by his apartment. I remember when we were kids, she was always one of those really overbearing helicopter moms, so it was no surprise to me that she had a key, and apparently had let herself in.

 

She said there were spots of blood on his carpet and furniture that left a trail to his kitchen and a knocked over bottle of whiskey. I grimaced, looking down at my knuckles and flexing the fingers of my right hand. She continued, relating to me how she had searched the house, calling his name, but received no response. Finally, she had knocked on his bedroom door before slowly opening it. It looked like he hadn’t slept there in weeks. Besides the mess in the kitchen nothing had seemed amiss in the whole house. Nothing, she said, except for the fact that every window in the apartment had been wide open.

 

"Maybe he decided to go somewhere, I don’t know. I’m just so worried because nothing seems to be missing in his house and his bags aren’t packed. His neighbors told me that they never saw him leave his apartment. His car’s still parked in the back.”

 

“That’s strange.” I said, heavy beads of sweat collecting on my forehead.

 

“I just don’t understand why his windows were all wide open when I got here. Like he was airing out the apartment. But he wouldn’t leave with them open like that, I taught him better. Well, please let me know if you hear from him, dear. I know he’s a grown man, but I’m worried sick. I’ve already talked to the police, but they say it will be another day before they can declare him officially missing. I just, I don’t know, I have a bad feeling.”

 

As I hung up with her, I already knew they’d never find him. I knew when he got back home, he must have knocked on his own windows. He knocked and that thing took him.

 

And that’s why I’m writing this, because Dan’s mom called me again today.

 

She was crying uncontrollably, and I could barely understand her. The cops had come by to look at the apartment. The windows had been closed since yesterday and now there was a smell. The cops searched the place and realized the smell was coming from his bedroom. Under the bed were two bodies laid out next to each other, one of them wrapped neatly in a blanket.

 

It was Dan, and in the blanket next to him was the corpse of a woman covered in what the cops had called quicklime. Dan’s mom identified her as Dan’s most recent girlfriend.

 

The cops said that the lime deters decomposition, that Dan hadn’t known what to do with her body yet and needed time to make a plan. It’s also why she hadn’t smelled anything the day before, the lime… and the open windows.

 

After half-hearted reassurances to Dan’s mom that I’d visit her and help her with arrangements, we hung up.

 

My cat rubbed against my leg as I slid into my recliner, sinking into its depths.

 

That cloying feeling was back, humid and sticky, a sickening fear that clung to my skin. I felt somehow that I'd aged a hundred years in only a few minutes.

 

My eyes were dry and made noise in their sockets as they moved around my living room in the fading light. My couch, my floor, my window, again and again. My couch, my floor, my window.

 

Dan’s sunken cheeks and tight jaw. The sleeplessness apparent in his heavy eyelids. His recessed eyes that seemed to peer out at you from just beneath the surface of a pool of black water.

 

My friend. A murderer. In my apartment. Was he going to tell me? Confess? What would I have done if he had?

 

And then the thing in the window. A thing only he could see. He said it hadn’t been human.

 

I don’t have any answers. Night has fallen as I write this. My blinds are closed, and my cat is locked in my bedroom with me.

 

The only thing I know is the only warning I can give. There’s something out there. Something that’s not a ghost. Something real, monstrous. Something that killed my friend.

 

Please, *please* don’t knock on your windows at night. Something knocks back.
