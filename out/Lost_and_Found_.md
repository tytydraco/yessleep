Let me start this off by saying I know everyone reading this probably won’t think any of this is real. I wouldn’t, and for the first few incidents, I didn’t. But I promise it is. 

Four months ago, the day after I turned eighteen, which here in Canada is the age where you're considered a legal adult, I took almost a quarter of my inheritance and bought a house way up in the woods of northern alberta. I’m not going to go into detail about why I did, I just wanted to be someplace far from where I grew up, and where everyone knew me for not so great reasons. None of which was my own fault, but still, it seemed like everyone was watching me after what had happened, wondering about what I was going to do in the aftermath of… it.  That’s not important to any of this, I just thought some explanation of how I came to live here was needed. 

The house sits on a ten acre plot of land in the wooded north. It’s at least an hour’s drive to the nearest town from the house. The town won’t be named, since for my safety and yours, it’s best you don’t find this place. There’s already been one corpse on this property. That’s enough. The point is that it’s far away from everything else, lost in the forest.

 I guess the house was built as the ultimate bachelor hunting cabin at first, before the previous owner bought it. He lived out here full time, and had the wi-fi installed, as well as the necessities of modern living, like indoor plumbing. He had lived out here at least ten years, before dying of natural causes. 

I found all this out from the owner’s son, who was selling the place. He told me all this before I signed the papers. Granted, him saying natural causes the way he did now seems suspicious, but at the time I didn’t really care. I know that might sound harsh, but at the time, I was desperate to move, and wasn’t in the mood for making friends. Not that I've ever had many. 

Anyway, long story short is that I had bought what was supposed to be a place for me to live out my days stress free and in privacy, only now it seems like neither is going to be happening anytime soon. 

Let me start at the beginning. 

The first incident happened at least seven weeks after I had finished moving in. The day before it happened I had been washing my clothes, but towards the end of the night I decided that I would put the last load of laundry in the dryer in the morning. But when I went to get it out of the washer, it wasn’t there. A sweater and four pairs of jeans, just gone. At first, I was confused, thinking maybe I had just imagined putting them in the washer. But when I went into the bathroom to check the laundry bin, it two was empty, confused, I walked back into the laundry room, and froze. 

On top of the dryer lid, neatly folded and stacked on top of each other was my laundry. 

I’ll be honest, that sent me into a panic. 

It wasn’t just the fact it was on top of the dryer, completely dry, which would have been bad enough, but it was folded. In the eighteen years I’ve lived on this rock, I can’t remember the last time I’ve ever folded any of my laundry. I didn’t see the need to really. Call me lazy, but when I hang the sweaters and shirts on a hanger in the closet, it seems like a waste of time. And I usually throw jeans haphazardly into a drawer in my dresser. 

I spent the rest of the day sitting on my coach. Realizing I had two options, both terrible, but one more desirable than the other. 

The first option was simple, I had forgotten that at some point after going to bed, I ran my clothes through the dryer, then folded them and left them on top of the dryer. Then I had completely missed them when I went to finish laundry in the morning. Walking around them both when I walked into the room, and turned around to walk out of the room. 

The other option was that someone else had done it. As scary as that idea was, it seemed to be the least likely one. The idea that after eleven o’clock last night, someone had picked the lock to my house, came into the entry room where the washer and dryer were, opened the washer, saw the wet clothes, put them through the dryer and then folded them and left them on top of the dryer before leaving was insane. First, if someone had been here, I would have heard them coming down the road before getting to the parking area in front of the cabin. And even if they had left their car up the road and walked in the woods, that were filled with bears mind you, why only do this? Even if they had done this the shortest cycle the dryer had that still would last at least an hour. they would’ve had to wait an hour and risked waking me up from the sounds of the dryer. Plus, nothing else was disturbed in the house, at least, that I could see. 

That meant this would’ve been the only thing they had done. Why do that? It seemed unreasonable for a prank. Nobody from my old town knew I lived here, and I hadn’t told anyone in town either. And even if it was the guy that sold me the place, I had got new locks on the doors. 

Plus even if it was somebody else, how had I missed seeing the clothes? 

As bizarre as it sounds, I was actually kinda hoping it had been somebody else, because the alternative meant that I might be losing my mind. I spent the day on my phone trying to figure out why this could be happening. I read somewhere that memory loss was a sign of stress, and yes, I had a lot of stress in the past year, but I never had any signs of memory loss or any other symptoms this drastic. 

The thought that I could no longer trust myself, my memories scared me beyond belief. Part of me thought I should drive into town, maybe get checked out at the hospital. But in the end, I decided against that and figured I would wait and see if I forgot more things. Maybe this was an isolated event. at least that’s why I told myself. 

Honestly, looking back now I wish I was losing my mind, because at least it would all be in my head.

The second event occurred four weeks later.
Since the town was so far away, I had made a schedule for myself to go into town for supplies and food every other week, and it happened on the drive back home. I was about ten minutes away, When it happened. It was almost fully dark out, and the forecast called for rain, so the sky was full of clouds. in this part of Alberta, you have to drive at night slowly and carefully since all sorts of animals like bears, moose and deer are in the woods. If you hit one of them driving at a hundred km, it’s not going to be pretty. I was driving down the dirt road, minding my own business, when all of the sudden it started getting brighter out, like the sun was coming out. This was weird for two reasons. 

One, even if the clouds were parting, it was almost nine o’clock at night, and the sun had already fully set. And two, the light wasn’t coming from the sky, it was coming from the trees. I know it sounds crazy, but for a split second, each tree lit up like they were a lightbulb getting power. The best way I can describe the way it looked was as if each tree spontaneously combusted. The light from the trees was so bright in fact that it became hard to see anything else. I had to slam on the breaks since I couldn’t see the road in front of me. It was like I had just been teleported onto the face of the sun. I knew I should close my eyes, it was so bright that it hurt, but before I could even comprehend the fact I should shut them forcefully I blinked, and everything was back to normal. The trees had stopped glowing, and it was night again. It was back to being nearly solid black outside my truck, aside from my headlights. 

I had to stop the truck for a second to regain my composure, before I resumed driving home. In my mind, it had been some weird hallucination caused by the fact I had only gotten two hours of sleep the night before. Looking back, it probably wasn’t, but what else was I supposed to think? That the trees in the woods started glowing bright enough to light everything up for a second. I tried to remember back to that day with the laundry to remember if hallucinations were a sign of stress, but I couldn’t. In the end, despite the fact that I felt it was otherwise I tried to chalked it up to hallucination due to lack sleep.

The last incident I’m gonna write about today occurred seven days ago.

 I had gone into town again to buy groceries and after doing so decided to walk down the streets to see what kind of shops they had. I had to walk down one street to get to a video game store, and as I was doing so, I passed a store that sold models of planes and trains and cars and army men and those games that use little figurines people paint in them. I could see into the store through the big window in the front. inside, I could see a man in mid forties was at the cash register scrolling on his phone, and there appeared to be two people browsing a shelf stacked with army miniatures, one was in a big hoodie with what looked like some kind of patch on the shoulder with their back to me. The person beside them though is what caught my attention.

Unlike the other one they weren’t wearing normal clothing. They look like they were in a Halloween costume. The best way I can describe it is like something somebody would wear in a  fantasy movie with dragons and knights and elves.  Brown layers of cloth can only be described as something like a robe with a hood covering their head. I could see that they were wearing black gloves over their hands. They appear to be holding some miniatures off the shelf. They were at least a head taller than the person in the hoodie. 

At first I thought it was just somebody dressed up in cosplay. I saw that the shop also sold fantasy miniatures, but that’s when the person apparently got that feeling they were being watched and turned to look at me. To this day, it’s amazing to me that I didn’t scream.

 They were skeleton. Like a proper skeleton. Not somebody wearing a mask and not somebody dressed up or with face pain or anything. They lowered their hood and rested it on the back of their shoulders, and I could clearly see the bones, where the neck should be. There is no way anybody could fake that. Honestly, that was weird enough, but was even more weird was the fact that where their eye holes were, instead of being empty, inside were two bright red gems that almost seemed to glow. 

For a moment we just stared at each other, I was hypnotised by its stone eyes. Then snapping out of it I looked around the street, looking to see if anybody else was around, but there wasn’t anyone then. It was empty. When I looked back into the store, the skeleton raised a gloved hand and waved at me. 

That was it for me. I took off running back down the street until I got into my truck, I slammed and locked the doors, put into gear and drove off to my house.

I wasn’t sure what I was going to do when I got home, but I did know I didn’t want to be in town anymore. I tried thinking it over, it was just another hallucination, I told myself. it was just a regular person and for some reason, my mind saw them as a skeleton with gemstone eyes. 

I ended up crying myself to sleep that night. I truly thought I was losing my mind. How could this be happening to me and I suffer enough? After I finished crying, I laid in bed for a long moment before making up my mind about something that I didn’t wanna do but knew I had to. I decided that in the morning, I would drive myself into town and get checked out at the hospital. If I was losing my mind, maybe there is something they could do to help me, or they could explain to me how I was supposed to live my life when I couldn’t even trust my own eyes.

In the morning, I got up reluctantly and showered, and got dressed and packed a bag to take with me into town in case I had to stay overnight at the hospital. I looked in the mirror, and said a quick prayer, which was something I had done in a while. I sort of lost my faith after everything that happened, and walked out the door. I was walking to the edge of the deck to the stairs when I kicked something accidentally. It flew down the stairs and landed in the dirt. I felt my heart stop when I saw what it was. It was a large, red gemstone. 

I realize that this probably isn’t the best place to leave this off, but I’ve got to go now, my phone is about to die. Plus I have to prepare for this weekend. There’s a storm coming and if what he says is true, I need to make sure I’m going to be safe inside my house in case they try to get in. Feel free to ask me anything. I’ll try to answer when I can. And if I’m still around after tonight, I’ll explain what’s happened this past week. One thing is for sure, out here, everyone gets lost, and only the lucky ones get found.
