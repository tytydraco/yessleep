It had been 3 days since I last heard him walk around the garden. I know I will run out of food eventually but I can't risk going outside. I am using the last battery to write this and hopefully make people aware of him

It all started tuesday morning. I own a small ranch where I produce and sell pasteurized milk to townfolk. 

I had a regular customer named Larry who would come to me, buy the product and make cheese out of it. He would come around monday and I would leave some raw milk for him in 2L bottles for him to take. It was a like a subscriptions. 

He called me telling me he would arrive Tuesday due to personal problems. I sayed no problem and Tuesday morning came and he did arrive. He did the usual, put the milk in his car and pay me last months debt.

As he was counting the bills, we both stopped to admire the silence. No cow was mooing, no bird was chirping. Just silence... as our ears adjusted to the silence, we started hearing a 'sss' sound coming from the fields. Then small steps on the grass. It was weird as no cow was moving,they all froze. Not even their bells were ringing even tho they were let free to roam their part of the field covered by fences.

Larry then left disturbed by the silence. I went check the cows and they were all laying on the grassy field, pretending to be dead. Then I saw who they were scared off. An abomination of man. It looked like the mummy of a black bear. Only muscle and bone, no fur. The muscles seemed to be dry, almost like dry aged ham and the eyes were horrific. Noticing me, he started sprinting on his hindlegs towards me and the cows got aggitated and started going everywhere.

Seeing him run towards me, I ran towards my door and locked it quickly. For the following hours I heard him slaughter my cows.

I was scared but I acted on my feet, going towards my attic and getting a crowbar. Then I began prying the floorboards of the living room off and nailing them on my windows.

I was now locked in my house with nothing to do. I would occasionally peak outside and shut the curtains.

1 day passed, 2 day passed, 3 day passed. I was suprised no one was coming to my house to buy products. I made a makeshift spyglass using a newspaper and some old glasses to see the outside. I loosened some nails and spied outside. Red all over the grass, and dead cows everywhere. I looked towards my gate and saw what happened. A car crashed into a tree and a disemboweled Henry on the floor. 

My sight-seeing was cut short by scratching on the door. Then it turned to banging. I contemplated opening the door.

Then 4, 5, 6, 7 days passed. I had slaughtered a cow on Monday before the disaster so I had enough food. But how much?

It had been 10 days since I was last outside. The noises stopped on day 7 as he got bored of tormenting me. Ever since then I unbarricaded the door incase I wanted to go outside.

I exited  my house for the first time in 10 days. I checked around for a bit before I went to Henry's car. Stepping over his body, I sneaked towards the trunk and got some groceries from him as I knew Henry always came to me to finish his groceries from the chit-chating. I took his keys and drove the car further towards the roads to get signal to copy and paste this message onto reddit.

The highway was full with dead bodies and cars that crashed into one another. I looted the cars for any groceries.

I had enough groceries to last me more time, especially as the screams never stopped. If you read my story, go to another continent far from me.
