There’s never been a time in my life where I didn’t let my mind wander, since I was born I’ve been thinking back and forth on things that don’t really matter at all.



I remember days where I would do nothing but think, letting the emptiness fill my mind and trying to replace it with pieces of a puzzle of thinking that really didn’t match. On one of these days, though, I broke from my seemingly endless cycle of thought, and I snapped back to reality as suddenly as I had left it.



It was a strange thing, like having cold water dumped on you while you slept, except it wasn’t cold water, it was the loud sound of a gunshot ripping through the air on the other end of my house. 



I sat up quickly, the warmth of the sun shining through my window disappeared from my face and, without moving an inch, repositioned itself onto my bed where my head once laid. 



I got off my bed and walked over to my door, it was a few steps but I took my time, I wasn’t sure I wanted to know what was going on outside of it. 



When I got to the door I slowly opened it and crept out into the hallway, then began to move toward the main area of my house, taking care not to make any sounds at all in case the wielder of the gun that was shot might want to let out an attack on me.



When I finally made it out I saw something strange, a large chunk of my family and friends were sitting up against the walls of my house, a terrified look was plastered over all their faces. 



When I got a closer look into the main space of my house, I saw it. A man in a black leather jacket stood in the middle of the large group of people holding a gun, and above him sat an illuminated sign hanging from the ceiling that simply read “DON’T MOVE”.



I stiffened immediately, and followed the directions the sign gave me, whether they were voluntary or not. 



After some 30 seconds the sign flashed a green color, and the text changed to say: “GRACE”, with a timer counting down from 20. At the sight of this, some of the people who sat against the walls got up and quickly moved to other places, the man in the center didn’t move or react at all.



When the grace period ended, an old friend of mine was still standing, trying to find somewhere to move himself, and didn’t notice the sign change. He took a single step after the wording of the sign changed, and a gunshot rang out, hitting him directly in the head, and spattering his blood on the wall, and on the people he was standing near to. 



The man’s lifeless body fell to the ground, and was slowly absorbed by the floor. The people who had watched him die’s faces contorted, and tears welled up in their eyes, but none of them screamed, or really did anything at all, aside from forming their clearly emotional expressions.



I stood in shock for a long while, my eyes darting across the room, trying to make sense of anything that was happening, when suddenly a loud voice boomed out across the space, shattering the silence; “You, come out of the hallway, or you will die right there” it said, the power in each of the words shook me harder and harder as they progressed.



I walked out from the hallway into the large room of people, and managed to mutter a quick “alright” before quickly positioning myself against the wall next to a friend of mine and a family member I didn’t speak to much, right in the place the man I had just watched die had gotten up from.



It confused me why the person who got up from this seat had done it, or why anyone who got up really did it at all, but that confusion dissipated when the grace period began and words were thrown over my field of vision. “YOU MAY REMAIN WHERE YOU SIT” they read, and I breathed a sigh of relief, but my friend next to me wasn’t as lucky. 



He suddenly got up, and I could only assume it was because he had been commanded to, and he feverishly ran around the room trying to find an open spot, but as they filled in, he realized he wasn’t so lucky. 



He looked over at the illuminated sign and the terrifying man standing below it, and shed a single tear before the sign changed back once more, and a bullet blew through his brain, killing him instantly.



Next to me a large metal tube rose up, filling in the spot where he sat, and the same happened with every other empty spot.



Someone on the other side of the room let out a whimper, and they were the next to die.



As more and more people were shot dead, I sat there, waiting for my prompt to change, waiting for it to tell me to move, and eventually it did.



“MOVE OR DIE” it read, and I stood up, looking for an open seat as people frantically scattered around the room trying to find an empty space. 



The timer hit 5 when I finally saw one, and I bolted towards it as fast as possible, but someone had the same idea, and started moving towards it as well. Now, I’m not usually a violent guy, and I never was, but as that man threatened my own life, I had to fight back, and I did just that.



The clock hit 1, and we both dove for the seat. As we were flying towards the wall, my perception of time seemed to slow itself, and a thought echoed through my head; “Do you kill him or yourself?” it asked.



I didn’t take any time to think on it, and I pushed the man out of the seat with all my strength. He went backwards and into a standing position and then fell, but was dead before he hit the ground. Warm blood rocketed out of the wound onto me and the people close-by, and another metal tube rose up on the other side of the space, but I didn’t react, I couldn’t, or I would die too.



It continued on like this for hours, I watched the sun set as I sat and occasionally changed spots. I watched friends and family die, but eventually it all just became gray, desensitization is a powerful thing.



Eventually it narrowed itself down to me and two other people, and of course, the man standing in the middle of the room with a gun.

The walls were almost entirely covered now, the holes the bullets made along with them. The sign again, and I was prompted to move. As I got up, a pipe slammed up from the ground onto the ceiling, covering my space.



The two other people also stood up, leaving only two open spots, and I wasn’t about to lose now. I ran as fast as I could to the next open spot, and, just like earlier, the other person dove for it; my half-brother John. 



I hadn’t yet gone for the spot, so as John jumped, I grabbed him by the back of the shirt and pulled him backwards, then moved myself into the spot as quickly as I could. 



Another gunshot rang through the house, my clothes were stained red, and the only other person left looked at me in fear, it was my cousin Layla. The sign sat still, the same words as when I first saw it plastered over it in aggressive red text.



Then suddenly, the color changed, and a new prompt appeared in front of my eyes; “CIRCLE” It read, and I understood what it meant immediately.



We were now playing a twisted game of musical chairs, walking around and around until the sign changed again. I saw Layla cry as she got up and began circling around, but at this point I didn’t care.



For what felt like hours we circled back and forth, and then the old prompt appeared in front of my eyes. “MOVE OR DIE” it read, and I did just that, I ran for the empty spot ahead of me.



Layla didn’t move, she stared teary-eyed at the spot as I filled it, and sat down in the middle of the room. “I’d rather it be m-” she spoke but was cut off by a bullet piercing her head.



As her body sunk into the ground, the sign’s light dissipated, and the intimidating man with the gun began to walk towards me. 



“You’ve done good” he spoke, his flat, deep voice penetrating the air around me.



The man then dropped his gun, knelt down in front of me, and placed two fingers on my forehead. I recoiled at his touch, but was powerless to move.



I held eye contact with him for a few seconds, and felt my mind begin to shut off; I was drifting away from my own conscience, and I couldn’t do anything about it.



As suddenly as I was awake, I fell asleep, drifting from my position in the physical realm, and off into another body.



I opened my eyes and in front of me was my room. I felt my phone buzzing in my pocket, and pulled it out to check what was going on. There were thousands of text messages, “We’re sorry, but \_\_\_\_ has died.” they all read, the blank space interchangeable with anyone who sat in the death chamber I had just been in a few seconds earlier.



I checked one message, and it gave the reason of a heart attack, so I checked the rest, and they all followed with similar causes. 



I got up from my chair, and walked to the front room of my house, it was empty now, no tubes, no blood, no man with a gun, it was peaceful.



I walked out of my front door into the nice, fresh air of the outside and drew in a deep breath.



I had survived, but I wish that I didn't
