As I stepped into the small elevator, the man immediately started staring at me.

It was just the two of us in there, and the panel was on his side. Luckily, the button for the 1st floor was already pressed—no need for conversation.

But it was a tall old building, and as the elevator slowly passed through its thirty-two floors, I noticed the man kept sizing me up. I focused straight ahead, fixing my gaze on the door.

“Are you Anna Hansen?” he asked.

“Yes,” I replied, giving him a nervous smile.

“I knew it!” he exclaimed, his enthusiasm unsettling. “I’ve been following your career since the 2024 Olympics. You made history there.”

“Thank you,” I responded shyly.

Maybe it’s just a gymnastics fan, I thought, but his appearance left me uneasy. He looked to be in his 40s, about six feet tall, with a round belly and what I could only describe as wild, thinning hair. At 5’1, he loomed over me.

Every Thursday I came to this building for massage therapy, but I’ve never noticed this guy before.

“I just want to say,” he continued, “the blue leotard you wore during your gold-winning vault was one of the prettiest I’ve ever seen in the sport.”

Ok, my instincts weren’t wrong. What a creep.

I thanked him again, forcing an awkward smile, and turned my attention back to the elevator’s display. Fifth floor. Almost there.

But then a loud noise, followed by a sudden jolt, made me lose my balance. The lights flickered off for a moment before coming back on in a dim red glow. Emergency lights.

“Oh no,” he muttered. “This ancient elevator keeps doing these pranks.”

He pressed the alarm button and spoke to maintenance. They explained the technician was finishing up another call nearby and wouldn’t take long.

“We’ll just wait then,” he said, flashing an unsettling smile that sent a chill down my spine.

Determined not to engage further, I checked my phone—no signal.

We sat in silence for a few minutes until, of course, he decided to speak again.

“Your life story is also quite special,” he said. “Daughter of a poor Texas rancher. Left the cows behind for the big city and got discovered at 12. Really inspirational.”

“Thank you,” I replied for the third time, now a bit uneasy with how much he knew about my background.

“You’re my second favorite gymnast,” he added. “After Carly Miller.”

The name made my skin crawl. Carly Miller was my biggest rival. In a month, we were set to face off in the national finals.

The man reached into his pocket, pulling out a small blade.

“But it’s not a fair comparison,” he said, a twisted grin forming on his face as he stepped closer. “For Carly, I’d do anything. Anything.”

What happened next was hard to explain to the police. The stab I got in my shoulder. The struggle. The gun I carried on my right hip and the three shots I gave him near the chest.

The only thing I clearly remembered from that afternoon was the relief of seeing the elevator doors open again, even if soaked in blood. 

The injuries were quite bad and I didn’t compete in the finals, but neither did Carly Miller. She was arrested five days after these events.

According to the police reports, Carly encouraged a crazed fan to murder me. There were even texts between them where she provided details of where and when I would be each day of the week.

Thankfully, her research wasn’t detailed enough. The daughter of a Texas rancher always carries a gun.

As for me, after months of recovery, I returned to competing and slowly worked my way back into the game. Now, I just take the stairs.
