I woke up in an empty town. I can’t remember why I’m here, or even my own name. The streets are cracked, buildings abandoned, paint peeling, as if the town itself forgot how to live. My suitcase is here. Everything I own is here. And inside it… a diary. Luke Martinez. That’s the name on the cover. I don’t know who he is, but something tells me I should read it.

August 12th

I decided to take a walk today. The air smells sharp and metallic. The trees sway like they’re breathing. I spotted something on a hill, half-hidden in the shadow of an old brick building. At first, I thought it was a stray dog. Its eyes were… white. Too white. Staring. I froze. My stomach dropped. It didn’t move when I walked toward it. When I turned my back, I could swear it followed me with its gaze.

I got back to my room. Nothing happened… but something feels off.

August 12th, Evening

Later, I woke with a tightness in my chest. The house felt… smaller. I shouldn’t have brushed off what I saw in the park. It’s here. In my closet.

I froze. My throat went dry. I could hear the faint rustle of fabric against wood — stretching, rearranging itself. Mouth open, eyes matte black. Thick, dark ooze dripped slowly from the corners of its lips. Not sloppy, but precise. Its head stretched, pulling human features into something grotesquely familiar. Fingers twitched like they had a mind of their own.

The air tightened around us. Every instinct screamed at me to move, but I couldn’t. I was rooted there, staring at this… thing that had been inside my home, inside my life, while I slept. The room smelled wrong, sour, like burnt iron and decay. My heart raced.

I screamed, a raw, unthinking sound, and stumbled backward. My eyes couldn’t leave it. My mind cycled through disbelief, terror, and stubborn hope that this was a hallucination. But it wasn’t. It existed. And it wanted something.

I didn’t wait. I threw open the window and jumped out, heart hammering, body trembling. Even as I ran, the memory of those black, unblinking eyes and slow, deliberate movements followed me.

I stayed with a friend for a while. Her dog… it’s different. It stands on its hind legs, eyes fixed on me. At night, I see it dragging something across the floor. The air smells of decay. Every time I blink, it’s closer. I can’t sleep.

The diary says these are signs. I didn’t think I’d see them again. Something inside me recognizes it, and I hate that.

August 14th

I’m on the road now, headlights cutting a pale rectangle through the darkness. The asphalt gleams faintly, slick and uneven. Shadows bend around lampposts that don’t work.

Two minutes pass. Nothing. Another minute. Still nothing. The car slows, not because of brakes, but because of fear. The street stretches endlessly. Trees arch over the road, black fingers brushing the edges of the headlights.

I see something — maybe a figure, maybe a tree — flinch at the edge of my vision. My pulse spikes. I dare not turn my head. Every sound echoes: tires over gravel, wind through leaves. The tape in my mind glitches like an old VHS. I tell myself it’s nothing, but the knot in my stomach tightens. The street doesn’t end. I don’t know if I’ll reach the edge or if the edge will reach me first.

August 15th

Back inside, lights off. The old TV flickers to life. An old tune, warped, scratchy. There it is. Black figure rising, slow. Its eyes… not white this time. They’re watching. The audio whispers:

“It’s 333, Luke. It’s 333.”

Over and over. My heart races.

The dog stops. Stares. I feel its presence in me, not in the room. My diary, my memories… they mix. The chain… is it broken? Something moves in the corner. I can’t look away. The screen flickers — and I swear it’s looking directly at me, responding to my smallest movements. Waiting.

August 16th

I don’t know how much of me is left. Pieces, fragments, when I was someone else. Reading this diary… I feel it. The doppelganger hesitates. Confused. My thoughts flicker between mine and theirs. The TV whispers again, slower this time.

Waiting. Watching.

I know they’ll come. But… I also know I remember. I will not be taken this time. Something shifts in the air. Something bends. And then… silence.
