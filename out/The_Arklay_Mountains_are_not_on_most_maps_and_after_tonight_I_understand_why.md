The Arklay Mountains are not on most maps and after tonight, I understand why.

I am here to document rare alpine fungi. That is the excuse on my permit, at least. The locals in the village below the mountains warn me not to go past the torii gate on the old logging road. They smile when they warn me, the kind of tight smile people use when they are tired of explaining something. I bow, thank them and go anyway. I am confident in my gear, my GPS, my training. Confidence feels like armor right up until it doesn't.

The forest changes the moment I pass the gate. The air grows thick, sound dampens. My footsteps feel swallowed by the moss. The trees here are wrong, twisted into shapes that look intentional as if someone bends them by hand.  By late afternoon, the fog rolls in without warning. It pours between the trunks like water. My GPS begins to act up. I stop to mark my position, and that is when I hear breathing that does not belong to me.

It's  close. Too close. I stand still, holding my breath, counting the seconds between the inhales. The rhythm is uneven, like lungs that do not remember how to work. I scan the fog, and something moves in it. 

It is tall, taller than any person I know, and thin in a way that looks painful. When it steps forward the fog curls around it instead of breaking. 

I want to run. I tell myself this is a trick of the light. Then it tilts its head and I see it, the face is almost human. The eyes are set too far apart reflecting light like wet stones, the mouth opens wider than it should, stretching down its chin and I hear my own breathing echo back at me. That is when I understand it's mimicking me. Learning me.

I back away slowly. My boot snaps a twig. The creature takes a step forward, and the ground does not crunch under it. It does not weigh what it looks like it weighs. Its skin ripples, as if something underneath shifts to find the right shape.

I turn and run. The forest becomes a maze of grasping branches and slick roots. I hear it behind me, not chasing so much as keeping pace. I burst into a clearing where an abandoned weather station rots under a leaning tower. I slam the door behind me and shove a rusted cabinet against it.

The breathing stops. For a moment, there is only the hum of old equipment and my heart trying to claw out of my chest. Then fingers slide through the crack under the door. They are too long, bending at extra joints, skin pale and stretched thin. The voice comes next, and it is my voice,  asking me to open the door because it is cold. I clamp my hands over my ears. I do not answer. I do not move. The fingers withdraw. Footsteps circle the station. The fog presses against the windows and for a second, I see its silhouette merge with my own reflection. Then it steps back into the trees. 

I wait until dawn, I leave everything behind and run downhill until my legs give out. The rangers find me hours later, babbling about echoes that walk. They listen politely. They don't smile. Some things up there are still practicing how to be human. And they are getting better.
