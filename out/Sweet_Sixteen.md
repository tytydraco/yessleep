They’ve found me. They’re pounding on the door. It won’t hold for much longer. I’m trapped. There’s no escape. Please accept this post as my dying declaration. More importantly, let it be a warning to you… to all of you. Because the fate of the entire human race could rest upon what I’m about to tell you.
 
Before I go any further, I beg you, do not dismiss what I’m about to reveal as a prank or hoax. It’s so unbelievable I can scarcely believe it myself. If I were not living this nightmare in real time, I would have laughed at how far-fetched it all sounds.
 
I was living my best life, not easy, given I’m a wheelchair-bound teenage girl living on a rundown ranch in the middle of nowhere. But I was determined to make the most of it. I was a straight-A student and captain of the girls’ softball team. Sure, I needed someone to be my ‘legs,’ but boy could I swing that bat!
 
I had a happy upbringing thanks to my elderly foster parents, Jack and Ruth who raised me since I was a toddler. The way they tell it, my mom had eventually succumbed to her opioid addiction on the couch in our ramshackle home in Lincoln County.
 
She had been there for several days, leaving me upstairs all alone. I had somehow managed to scramble out of my crib desperately looking for food despite only being 18 months old. Weak from hunger, my legs gave way, and I tumbled down the stairs.
 
I may have lost the use of my legs that day, but I gained the most loving foster parents you could ever wish for. They doted on me. They made sure I never went hungry ever again. I often teased them, calling them ‘feeders.’ I guess they saw the funny side because they always responded by saying, “Eat up” at mealtime.
 
The joke was wearing thin. My sixteenth birthday was rapidly approaching, and I was concerned about how much weight I had gained. There was a boy in class that I liked, and I wanted to look my best. But when I shared my concerns with my foster mom, she told me, “I was being silly, and if anything, I had lost weight.”
 
When I complained that, “my clothes were starting to feel too tight” she smiled, and said, “You’re turning from a girl into a woman, they’re bound to feel tight.” I nodded. It made sense.
 
A few days before my birthday I saw her gift-wrapping a beautiful dress. It was red with lots of frills and sequins. I was so excited I could hardly wait to try it on. Later that day I saw the same dress sticking out of the trash. I was devastated and wondered what I had done wrong. I had done my chores.  I had eaten my dinner, every last morsel as they had demanded. It made no sense.
 
I gazed longingly at my ‘birthday’ dress as it drowned in a sea of trash. I wanted so much to rescue it from its terrible fate. Eventually, I reached for it. The silk felt so soft against my delicate skin. As I held it against me the label landed on my lap. It looked like it had been removed with a pair of scissors. I glanced at it and immediately noticed that the dress was at least two sizes smaller than the label suggested, “Ah, that’s why they threw it away. It was way too small” I told myself..
 
I would not have thought any more of it had I not seen my gift exactly where my foster mom had left it earlier that morning. It was untouched. I sensed something was off. I grabbed my birthday present and tore at the wrapping. Inside was an identical dress. Except this one was my size and sure to fit. I beamed like a ‘Cheshire cat’. My crush was bound to notice me in it!
 
For a moment, it was probably the happiest I had been in my entire life. But then my eyes zoomed in on the label. It was the wrong size. I knew instantly that my foster mom had switched the labels. She wanted me to think I was much slimmer than I am. It was like a kick in the teeth. I suspected that I had gained a lot of weight and here was the evidence to prove it. Furious, I spun my wheelchair around and headed towards the living room to confront her.
 
As I approached, I could hear what sounded like conspiratory whispers. I peered through a crack in the door and saw my foster mom utter, “I hope she tastes as good as she looks!” My foster dad looked predatory as he licked his lips and whispered, “Mmm… sweet sixteen.” They started to cackle like a pair of hyenas on the hunt.
 
Their disturbing chuckles rang in my ears as I charged into the bathroom in my wheelchair. I barely had my head in the toilet before the contents of my stomach erupted like Mount Vesuvius.
My heart pounded as I wiped my mouth clean. The two people I loved most in the world had been fattening me up like a plump Thanksgiving turkey so they could devour me. I couldn’t believe it. I had to know more about these ‘monsters’ whom I had spent most of my life calling, “Mom” and “Dad.”
 
I rifled through the cupboard drawers looking for something… anything. I pulled out several bills and invoices but nothing incriminating. I paused for a moment, “Think, Cassie. Think!” My mind raced. I suddenly muttered, “The tool shed!” My foster dad spent an ungodly amount of time there. Yet, he never seemed to make anything or fix anything.
 
The wheels on my wheelchair spun like Boudica’s war chariot as I charged outside. I checked to ensure the coast was clear and entered the shabby structure.
 
A strange humming sound greeted me.  Distracted by the weird noise, my wheelchair brushed against a workbench. The impact caused a bottle of weedkiller to topple over. I caught it mid-air and put it back, next to a small blood-stained ax. I felt sure it was human blood, but I couldn’t get that damn noise out of my head. It was coming from behind a dusty old curtain that looked like it had been a food source for moths since the dawn of civilization.
 
I yanked the curtain hard. A cloud of dust enveloped me. I coughed and spluttered as I frantically rubbed my eyes, desperate to see what it was concealing. I was confronted with an imposing,  solid oak door reinforced with thick strips of wrought iron. The incessant humming sound grew ever louder. I turned the handle expecting the door to be locked. To my surprise, the door slowly CREAKED open.  I gasped as my vision fell upon an array of state-of-the-art computers and servers that looked like they belonged in NASA’s headquarters, not my foster dad’s tool shed!
 
I was desperate to discover what secrets the hi-tech equipment was holding but knew I needed something to protect me in case I was disturbed. I promptly grabbed the ax and weedkiller off the workbench and placed them on my lap.
 
My fingers caressed the keyboard as I attempted to gain access to the password-protected information concealed within the hard drive of one of the many computers. I wondered what dark secrets they were hiding as I typed variations of all the passwords I could think of.
 
Just as I was on the verge of giving up, I noticed a small trunk tucked in the corner beneath a workstation. It was covered in cobwebs and had a rusted padlock.  I wasted no time in breaking it open with the ax. Inside was an old driver’s license with my foster dad’s name on it dated 1947. Lying next to it was a framed, black-and-white picture of my foster parents. They looked the same now as they did back then. How was that possible I wondered? Almost eighty years had passed but they had not aged a day.
 
At the bottom of the trunk, there was an old scrapbook. I quickly thumbed through it. There were several newspaper clippings of the Roswell incident. Not too surprising I reasoned. After all, it was practically on our doorstep and was big news back then. I continued to flick through it. To my horror, there were several polaroids of teenage girls spanning decades -- each blowing out the candles on a birthday cake as my foster parents looked on admiringly. All the girls looked like they were carrying a few too many extra pounds, much like me. Moreover, each cake had two numbered candles. The first one was the number “one.” The second was the number “6.”
 
My brain instantly generated a myriad of questions, “Who are these girls?” “Where are they now?” “Why are there no photos of them celebrating any other birthday besides their sixteenth?! I feared the worst, “Am I next?” I wondered. I gazed at their innocent, smiling faces as they blew out the candles on a cake they probably never even got to taste. I focused on the candles. An idea suddenly jumped out at me. I hastened over to the same computer as before and hurriedly typed in the number “16.” It failed. I tried “sixteen.” Access was “denied” yet again.
 
I turned away from the computer screen, defeated. I was on the verge of giving up when I decided on one final try. I typed in the words “sweet sixteen.” The screen suddenly loaded. I was in! I couldn’t help myself and whispered, “Sick sonofabitch” because of my foster dad’s twisted cannibalistic desires.
 
I studied the monitor as an array of text appeared on the screen. There were no actual words; rather it was a huge sequence of similar numbers such as 01100001 and 01100100. Fortunately, math was my strongest subject. I didn’t particularly like it, but I understood it. I instantly recognized the numbers as binary code and set about deciphering it as best I could.
 
Just as I believed things could not get any worse, the seriousness of the situation escalated to catastrophic levels. I began to decipher words such as “planet,” “attack,” “destroy” and “colonization.” My heart raced as I started to make sense of the numerical text. It quickly became apparent that ‘Jack’ and ‘Ruth’ were aliens from an unknown planet whose inhabitants were preparing to attack us. My so-called foster parents were seemingly on a scouting expedition when they crash-landed near Roswell in 1947.
 
They had probably murdered Jack and Ruth and stolen their identities and all their possessions including their ranch. Hiding in plain sight, they had been reporting back to their home planet ever since.
 
As I continued deciphering the code, I noticed the text was becoming increasingly dark. There was mention of ‘sustainable farming’ accompanied by drawings of dozens of young girls in individual cages. They were all shackled with feeder tubes inserted in their mouths. Breeding farms were also discussed. The best male ‘livestock’ would be used to produce a continuous food supply.
 
Tears filled my eyes when I saw their plans for the rest of the population. Virtually every male, man, or boy, is to be put to death—their bodies to be used as a source of heat. A similar fate awaited the sick and the elderly. The only human survivors in this terrible new world would be girls aged 0-16 with a life expectancy of 16 years. Once they reached this milestone they were to be slaughtered and eaten.
 
My stomach churned as I discovered why 16-year-old girls were so prized by this alien race. It was apparent that my foster parents had documented their culinary exploits in great detail. They had ‘sampled’ human flesh from all ages and sexes: newborn to elderly. Their comments were grotesque and way too graphic. Phrases such as “too fatty,” “too tough” and “too grizzly” were common. It was suggested that the raging hormones in pubescent girls is the reason the ‘meat’ tastes so sweet and flavorsome with 16 being the optimum age to slaughter the ‘livestock.’
 
My body shook head-to-toe as I tried to process these shocking revelations. I knew that I had to try and stop them somehow. My mind raced as I tried to devise a plan of action. I thought about returning to the house to get my cell phone so that I could call the cops. I had left it on charge but was sure it would have enough battery to make multiple calls by now.  I decided it was too risky and opted to put everything I had discovered in a folder and email a copy to the relevant authorities.
 
I set about creating a folder. My fingers frantically pounded the keyboard. I was almost done when I heard footsteps. I eyed the weedkiller and knew what I had to do. I reasoned that maybe I could take them with me as I quickly unscrewed the cap.
 
I discarded the ‘empty’ bottle of weedkiller just as my foster parents started pounding on the door, demanding that I, “let them in.” I gripped the ax tight as the door suddenly exploded into a pile of kindling. My heart pounded like a drum. I realized that Jack and Rose had morphed into their true selves. No way could two elderly folk have destroyed the door with such force.
 
I was expecting slimy, green creatures with tentacles. However, they are far more hideous and threatening. They have both transformed into a huge black mass which is more animalistic than human. It was like staring at a pair of silhouettes. Yet, they exude power and have multiple limbs with claws the size of daggers. Their  mouths are huge with row upon row of razor-sharp triangular-shaped teeth with a vicious serrated edge. They are like no apex predator I have ever seen. It is like looking at the shadows of two giant, multi-limbed, grizzly bears with the jaws of a great white capable of enormous ferocity and damage.
 
I’m beginning to feel incredibly nauseous. I’m not sure if it is sheer terror or the weedkiller starting to take effect. Either way, I am determined to keep the contents of my stomach intact in the hope that they get a nasty little surprise when they devour me.
 
I take great comfort in knowing I will taste anything but ‘sweet.’ Hopefully, I won’t be the only one who breathes their last today.
 
They’re still twenty feet away but are edging closer towards me. Drool drips from their huge, shark-like teeth as they salivate in anticipation of their ‘feast.’
 
They’re almost within touching distance now, I can feel their hot breath on my soft skin as I frantically finish typing up this post with my left hand. My right hand grips the ax tight. I may be ‘disabled’ but I’m going out swinging.
 
I pray you heed my warning and notify the authorities immediately.

They’re inches away. I’ve just enough time to click ‘SUBMIT’.......
