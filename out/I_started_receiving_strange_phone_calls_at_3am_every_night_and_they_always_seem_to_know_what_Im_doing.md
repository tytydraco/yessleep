It all started a few weeks ago. I would be fast asleep and suddenly, my phone would ring. I would groggily pick up, only to hear silence on the other end. I thought it was just a wrong number or a prank call, so I didn't think much of it. But then it started happening every night, at exactly 3am. I couldn't shake off the feeling that someone was watching me, it was always at the back of my mind and I couldn't help but feel a knot in my stomach every time my phone rang.

At first, I tried to ignore it. I would just let it ring and go back to sleep. But then the caller started to say things. Things that made my blood run cold. They would say things like "You're just getting home from work, aren't you?" or "You're in the kitchen, making yourself a sandwich." How could they possibly know that? It's like they're watching me. Every time I heard their voice, my heart would race and my palms would sweat. I couldn't shake off the feeling that someone was watching my every move.

I started to feel like I was being stalked. I changed my phone number, but the calls still came through. I even unplugged my phone at night, but they still managed to get through. I don't know what to do. I'm scared to be alone in my own home. I've even started sleeping with a baseball bat next to my bed, just in case. I couldn't shake off the feeling of being watched and I couldn't help but feel like I was going to be attacked at any moment. It was affecting my work, my relationships, and my mental health. I was constantly on edge, and every time I heard a ringtone, my heart would race and I couldn't help but feel a wave of anxiety wash over me.

I've tried to talk to my friends and family about it, but they think I'm just being paranoid. But I know what I'm hearing and I know it's real. I don't know who is doing this to me or why, but I just want it to stop. It's affecting my work, my relationships, and my mental health. I just want to feel safe again. I just want to be able to sleep peacefully without the constant fear of someone watching me. The feeling of being stalked and harassed was overwhelming and I couldn't shake it off. It was a constant battle and I felt like I was losing. The fear of the unknown and the constant unknown calls was eating me from the inside and I couldn't take it anymore.

I started to investigate, trying to find out where the calls were coming from. But every time I tried to trace the call, it would be untraceable. It was like the caller was always one step ahead of me. I tried to change my number again but it made no difference. I even went to the police but they couldn't help me either. They told me there was nothing they could do unless the caller made a direct threat to me.

The calls continued, and they became more and more frequent. They were no longer just at 3am but at all hours of the day and night. I was starting to lose my mind. I couldn't focus on anything else. I was constantly thinking about the caller and the calls. It was affecting my work, my relationships, and my mental health. I was becoming more and more isolated and paranoid. I couldn't trust anyone. I was scared to tell anyone about the calls, fearing they would think I was crazy.

Eventually, I couldn't take it anymore. I was at the end of my rope. I was about to snap. I decided to confront the caller. I stayed up all night, waiting for the next call to come through. And finally, at 3am, my phone rang. I answered, and a voice on the other end said "You're awake, I can hear you breathing." I was shaking with fear and anger. I screamed into the phone "Who are you? Why are you doing this to me?" But there was only silence on the other end. I couldn't take it anymore, I hung up the phone and broke down in tears.

I don't know what to do. I am afraid to be in my house. I'm also afraid to sell it. I just have to hope that I am not running out of time.
