The headaches began the first week of October.

At first, merely a dull pressure behind my eyes that I attributed to stress, to insomnia, to the changing seasons. But by mid-November, they had evolved into something more insistent - a throbbing pulse that concentrated at my temples, sharpening at dusk and lingering until dawn.

It was during one of these episodes, standing on the back porch of my childhood home with my palm pressed against my skull, that I saw the first one.

Twilight was bleeding across the vast wildflower fields behind the house - a crumbling Victorian at the edge of town that had remained unoccupied since my mom's passing. I had retreated here last year seeking solace in familiar surroundings, a temporary escape from my city life.

*I think moving back here was a mistake.*

A singular figure, impossibly tall, standing motionless amidst the undulating grass. Its silhouette possessed a liquid quality that defied natural geometry - limbs elongated beyond proportion, head featureless save for a mercurial shimmer that caught non-existent light. In its hand, it carried something resembling a surveyor's instrument, though the tip pulsed with an arterial orange glow.

I blinked, attributing the vision to the headache - perhaps a migraine aura manifesting in increasingly bizarre forms.

The diagnosis came three weeks later. On a Thursday.

Glioblastoma multiforme. Grade IV. The MRI showed it nestled against my occipital lobe like a pale spider, tendrils stretching outward with quiet, methodical purpose.

"Six months," Dr. Carlisle said, her voice maintaining the practiced neutrality of someone who had delivered such sentences before. "Perhaps eight with treatment."

That night, I saw two figures instead of one.

By the time I received my diagnosis, I had seen several of them.

"Visual disturbances are to be expected," Dr. Carlisle explained during my follow-up appointment. "The tumor's location makes hallucinations almost inevitable. Your brain is essentially creating sensory information that doesn't exist."

"They're methodical," I said. "They're preparing something."

She made a notation in my chart. "The mind imposes patterns even in degeneration. It's rather remarkable."

"You don't understand. There were four of them last night."

Dr. Carlisle's pen paused. "Four what, exactly?"

I couldn't articulate what I had seen without sounding deranged. How could I describe the way they drove luminous instruments into the earth in perfect geometric patterns? How they moved with synchronized precision despite their impossible anatomies?

As the weeks passed, the headaches intensified, concentrated pressure like a vise tightening incrementally against my skull. The specialists increased my dexamethasone, adjusted my anticonvulsants, scheduled another MRI.

The tumor had grown 17%. The prognosis contracted accordingly.

And each evening, their numbers continued to multiply.

Dozens became hundreds.

Hundreds became a small army that stretched toward the horizon, their movements increasingly elaborate, increasingly purposeful. They were constructing something - a lattice, a network, a scaffold of glowing orange filaments that formed an intricate grid across the entire field.

One month after my diagnosis, I ventured into the field.

The air changed texture as I stepped beyond the boundary of the porch.

It pressed against my skin with palpable weight, as if the atmosphere itself had congealed into something viscous and resistant.

My vision stuttered - reality fracturing into alternating states of presence and absence. One moment, the field teemed with their elongated forms; the next, nothing but empty grassland stretched before me. The flickering accelerated until the two realities began to bleed together, superimposed like double-exposed film.

Then, as abruptly as it had begun, the flickering ceased.

A single figure stood before me.

Its height - easily seven feet - registered first, followed by the deep, instinctual *wrongness* of its proportions. It did not stand so much as *hover*, its elongated limbs twitching with a slow, liquid motion, as though its bones - or whatever lay beneath its shifting skin - were rearranging themselves in real time.

Then it moved.

Not a step. Not a lunge. It simply shifted, closing the distance between us in a way that defied logic, as if the space between us had simply folded inward.

I turned to flee.

A shriek, high and choral, erupted behind me, burrowing into my skull with needlepoint precision. The air thickened, viscous and suffocating, as if unseen hands were pressing against my chest, slowing my movements, dragging me backward. My legs pumped uselessly against the ground - running, but not moving fast enough.

The thing did not chase. It did not need to.

It was everywhere at once - its limbs elongating, warping in my peripheral vision, closing in with that impossible, fluid movement. The sound it made was not footsteps but a *wet shifting*, like muscle being stretched and snapped back into place.

Then - agony.

A limb - no, something worse - lashed outward, impossibly fast. It did not strike me; it pierced me, sinking into my forearm like a hot wire through wax. Pain bloomed instantly, white-hot and electric, spreading through my nerves like wildfire.

I collapsed. The world swam in a haze of pulsating orange light.

When I looked up, the field was empty.

But the pain remained. And so did the wound, throbbing with a rhythm that did not belong to me.

That night, I didn’t sleep. I couldn’t.

I sat in the dim glow of the bathroom light, my arm resting on the sink, the bandage unwrapped and discarded in the trash. The wound was still there - or maybe it wasn’t.

It hurt, regardless.

The skin wasn’t broken, there was no blood surfacing. But my skin was split, like a crevice was opening, revealing something dark beneath the surface, veins threaded with faint orange light, glowing and pulsing. I ran a finger over and in it. It was all warm and smooth.

*Strange*.

I cleaned it anyway.

I grabbed the bottle of hydrogen peroxide from the cabinet, poured it over my arm. Nothing. No fizzing, no bubbling, not even the dull sting that should have come with an open wound.

I wiped it down, slathered a thick layer of Neosporin over the spot, as if it would do anything. I pressed a new bandage over it, tighter this time.

Maybe it wasn’t real.

But it hurt like it was.

*Pain comes from the brain.*

*And my head was fucked.*

It throbbed at the base of my skull, radiating outward, as if the tumor itself was reacting to what had happened.

In the morning, I staggered into Greenwood Market, my arm burning as if injected with molten metal. The pain had spread, radiating upward toward my shoulder, following what I imagined were neural pathways.

The cashier - a university student working summer break - dropped the carton of eggs he was scanning.

"Jesus christ bro," he whispered. "What happened to your arm?"

I froze, uncomprehending.

"You can see it?" I asked.

"Of course I can see it." His voice pitched higher. "It's glowing. Like, actually glowing."
