Dear Reader,

As I write this email, I am no longer among the living. My body lies still, but my mind continues to wander, seeking answers to what happened during my final moments on that cursed train.

It all began innocently enough. I had boarded the train like any other passenger, looking forward to a peaceful journey. However, the atmosphere on this train was different. Something about it felt strange, unsettling even.

The other passengers seemed distant as if they were hiding something. Some were fidgeting nervously in their seats, while others were whispering amongst themselves. Nobody wanted to make eye contact with me, and I could tell their reasons were less about polite reticence than desperate fear.

I tried to ignore the strange behavior of the others and settled in my seat, reading a book. But my attention kept drifting to the conversations around me. Some passengers recounted stories of ghost sightings or encounters with supernatural entities, while others simply murmured to each other about the cursed train.

At first, I thought it was all superstition, but then things started to take a dark turn. The lights flickered, the windows shook as if on the brink of breaking, and the air grew cold and oppressive. An uneasy feeling settled in the pit of my stomach – something was wrong, very wrong.

I tried to get the attention of the train staff, but they seemed as afraid as the passengers. Their eyes were glazed over and unfocused, as if they were under some sort of spell.

As the night drew on, I found myself unable to sleep, haunted by the strange aura emanating from the train. I had hoped that the morning would bring some comfort, but the sun never rose.

When I looked outside, all I saw was an endless void of darkness, miles and miles of pitch-black nothingness that seemed to go on forever. Panic set in; I grabbed my bags, ready to flee at the next station.

It was then that I realized we had not stopped for hours, and the train showed no signs of slowing down. I was trapped, the darkness enveloping everything, even my thoughts. Every time I tried to make sense of what was happening, my memories blurred, and my mind grew hazy.

And that’s how I ended up here, dead, on this cursed train, another victim of its sinister power. I don’t know what happened to the other passengers, but I know they’re gone, vanished into the void.

Who or what cursed the train, I’ll never know. All I know is that it’s still out there, still moving, still taking innocent lives with it. If my email is the last thing you ever read from me, I urge you to stay away from trains that feel just a little too strange or cursed.

There are things beyond our understanding out there, things that will take everything from you, including your life. Beware, always beware.

Sincerely,

(No signature – the email sender has passed away.)
