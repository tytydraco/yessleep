Ashley and I have been together for over two years now. During that time I’d like to say that our relationship has been pretty much perfect. We’ve never had any big fights and have been living together for about eight months. We still plan a date night at least once a week, and I can honestly say that we both look forward to spending time with each other. I'd like to think that we truly trust each other not to wander into anyone else’s arms.

But starting about three months ago, although we were as close as ever, she suddenly became uncomfortable with me seeing her naked. She started sleeping fully clothed despite always complaining of being too hot, and she only changed alone in the bathroom with the door locked. I tried to talk about it a few times and even recommended she go talk to a professional, but every time I brought it up she got really uncomfortable. I could tell that she thought I just wanted to have sex.

So I tried to be a good boyfriend and respect her privacy, but I couldn’t help but be worried. We have each other’s passcodes and every once in a while, maybe once a month at most, I’ll check Ashley’s phone while she’s sleeping. As I’m sure you can guess, that’s what led us here.

A few days ago I was having trouble sleeping. Stress from work, Christmas coming so soon and presents that needed to be bought. Thoughts were circling my head like a swarm of bees whose only goal was to keep me awake. Eventually these thoughts turned into a wondering about Ashley. It had been so long since we’d been intimate. Usually she was all over me after two days without sex. Was she cheating on me?

So I slipped her phone off the charger, got under the covers on my side of the bed, typed in her passcode, and started checking the typical suspects. Instagram, Facebook, iMessage. Everything was ordinary and innocent, and I was just about to close her phone and try to go to sleep when I, for no real reason, opened Safari.

The tab was already open, like she wasn’t even trying to hide it. OnlyFans. She had 15 subscribers and 11 posts. I was pissed. We’d been together for so long, she’d never crossed any boundaries and this was one of the most clear of all: my body is yours and yours is mine, no one else gets to see.

But apparently she wanted the whole fucking world to see. Or anyone who was willing to give her some change out of their pocket every month. It’s not like we were struggling for money. I had a six figure job and she had full access to my bank account despite not having to work. How could she let these strangers have access to something so intimate as her body? How could she disrespect me like this? I felt my heart break as I realized our relationship was clearly coming to an end.

I wanted to shake her awake and yell at her, or cry and beg her to tell me what I did wrong, or both. Instead, I took some deep breaths to steel myself. I clenched my jaw before continuing forward. I had to see what type of stuff she was posting, who she was talking to. I knew I didn’t want to see but I had to know.

Her account was called DeathConnoisseur, and I opened her posts to see an array of gore. I threw up in my mouth as I quickly scrolled to the bottom of the page before I saw anything too closely. There were glimpses of cuts and bruises, bodies and bones. It was like an Instagram page made by Jeffrey Dahmer. I put her phone down as I caught my breath. Surely it wasn’t real, right? Maybe it was some art project she was too embarrassed to tell me about? Maybe there was a deeper meaning to it, like, “look how dark the human mind can be. Look what people are willing to pay for.” Surely the dead bodies weren’t real, just a trick to expose some evil men.

But as I scrolled up and explored the page, there was no hiding the realness of what I was seeing. The pictures were too intimate, the bodies too grotesque, and the bottom of each picture showed what was without a doubt the tiles of our bathroom floor. My heart threatened to choke me as it climbed up my throat. I was deathly afraid of the person who was so calmly sleeping not two feet away from me.

I decided I was going to go through each and every post. I felt like I couldn’t move until I did. I had to know the extent of the madness.

The first post was three months ago and I recognized it immediately. It was of Ashley’s foot after the accident she’d had around that time. She’d been cutting a cucumber when she dropped the knife and it landed blade down on her foot. Even worse, when she went to pick it up she accidentally kicked the counter in front of her, causing the knife to drag across her foot. At least that’s the story she told me. It had stretched across nearly half of her foot and had required 28 stitches. Looking back, the story seemed ridiculous.

But then again, what reason would I have had to question her? And the truth was so much more unbelievable. The caption to the photo read: “Cutting into your own flesh is hard at first, but it gets more and more enjoyable the longer you do it. Hope you enjoy <3”

The post had two replies:

This was so hot! I can’t wait till you warm up to more.

Good girl.

The following posts were filled with similar content and replies. Cuts on her thighs and ass. One picture was of her shoulder with a cut so deep and wide you could have fit two fingers in and pushed. How had she managed the pain? How had I not noticed?

The caption to this one read: “I’m getting tired of being the canvas. What should I do next?”

The next post was almost like a reply. A picture taken from directly above a dead body, clearly on our bathroom floor. It was of a man. His face was blurred out and he was covered in wounds. A deep stab wound on each hand, a slit in his throat so deep that he was almost decapitated. One thinly drawn cut stretched all the way from the tip of his jaw down to the head of his penis, his pubic hair shaved on the floor around him to make space for the visual.

There were two more bodies after this one. Both men, and both stabbed, cut, and tortured. The caption on the latest one, posted only 3 days prior, read: “Thanks for the motivation guys! I can’t wait to take things to the next level!”

What’s the next level? I asked myself. She’d already self-mutilated, murdered, and tortured. What was worse than that? Cannibalism? Necrophilia? Some sort of Satanic ritual? As I swam through the thoughts and images my breath quickened to the point that I was worried I might wake Ashley. I put a hand over my mouth, closed my eyes, and started counting backwards from 10.

What I did next, I can’t possibly explain in any way that doesn’t make me sound like a good for nothing, negligent, fool. I loved her so much. She was the girl I was supposed to marry. Part of it was me believing that there must have been some explanation, part of it was just morbid curiosity. Whatever the reason, instead of running out of the room and reporting her to the police, I simply put the phone back into its place and got back in bed. Then, I grabbed my phone, made an anonymous account, DeathLover1349, and followed her. That way I could at least keep track of what was going on. I spent the rest of the night laying in bed, staring at her back as I thought about everything I’d just found.

I stayed like that until she stirred awake and turned towards me the following morning.

“Aww, that’s adorable,” she said. “You were watching me sleep.”

“Yeah,” I said after a momentary pause. “You’re so cute.”

“Is something wrong?” She reached toward me and I flinched, then immediately gathered my thoughts.

“Sorry, bad dream. You were acting kinda crazy.”

She leaned forward and kissed me softly on the lips. “Well, if dream Ashley was here I’d beat her the f up!” She laughed as she started elbowing and punching the bed between us. “Bam! Bam! Bam!”

“Dream Ashley wouldn’t stand a chance.”

“Nope, I’m real dangerous.”

By the time I shaved, showered, and brushed my teeth she was back asleep. I headed out the door and to work. In my office I ran through the contents of her account one more time, being sure not to connect to the company’s wifi.

At this point I’m an accomplice, I thought. If I call the police now, I’m safe. If I wait any longer, we might be getting arrested together.

It was then that I realized I had the ability to message her on the website. Maybe I could learn more that way.

Wow! I never thought anyone would post this kinda stuff. I’m so happy I found you

Her reply came within five minutes.

DeathConnoisseur: Who are you? How’d you find this account?

Fuck, I thought. Of course it was unlikely that some random guy would find this account posting such niche and… illegal content. I scrambled to think of a reply that wouldn’t arouse suspicion.

Me: It was recommended to me on a dark web forum. I’m into some pretty messed up stuff ;)

DeathConnoisseur: Ooh, like what?

Me: I like to see people ripped apart. Never got to do it in real life, though. What about you?

DeathConnoisseur: I think it’s pretty clear we’re into the same type of stuff. Don’t you think? I’m

also into pleasing my fans. I have something for you if you can hold tight for a little bit.

Me: Of course. Can’t wait!

What could she possibly be talking about? What would she be sending me?

Just then, a text from Ashley.

Ashley: Good morning baby! I was thinking we could have a date night tonight. What sounds good for dinner? I’ll have everything ready for you when you get home.

Me: Pizza sounds good! Little busy at work but I’ll be home at 6.

How could she be texting me while simultaneously talking with guys on OnlyFans about such heinous things? I attempted to focus on my work for a while, but when I failed I told my boss that I was sick and had to go home.

Instead, I went to the park for a walk, then out to a restaurant for lunch and a drink. By the time I was wrapping up and paying for my hardly touched burger, I got a text from Ashley on OnlyFans.

DeathConnoisseur: Here you go hon! :) I’ll be posting this tomorrow, but I thought you’d like a sneak peak since you love seeing people ripped apart!

Attached was a picture so gruesome that it pains me to describe it even now. It was a man laying down on our bathroom floor. He had no arms or legs: those were stacked in the corner of the room, barely visible in the picture, as if they weren’t meant to be in the shot at all. His head was also separate from his body. Once again his eyes were blurred, but she’d cut a smile into his face and stabbed him deep in each cheek, as if she were trying to create bloody punctured dimples.

I almost threw up. I ran into the bathroom, locked myself in the stall, and collapsed onto the floor. “This has to be some kind of dream!” I cried, not caring who heard.

I had clearly gotten that man killed. In barely 4 hours she had gone from fast asleep to obtaining, slaughtering, and displaying an innocent man. How could she work so quickly? Was it that easy for her? Had she already cleaned up the mess?

I drove home in a panic. I knew I had to call the police, but then, wouldn’t I be responsible too? Surely they’d go through her account and track her subscribers back to me. But what was there to do? Either way I had to report her.

But I wanted to see her one last time. Maybe I was hoping to catch her in the act, to put away any doubt I had that she was the one doing these killings. Maybe I just wanted to have one last good memory with her. Maybe I loved her so much that I was never going to report her at all.

When I walked in the door Ashley was surprised to see me, but she didn’t seem worried or upset at all. I feigned having to pee and she didn’t try to stop me as I walked into the bathroom.

I found that it was completely clean. It didn’t even smell like bleach or cleaning supplies, only the air freshener that we typically sprayed after going to the bathroom. Was it possible that this was all some misunderstanding?

I half convinced myself that it was. I told Ashley that my boss saw how stressed I was and gave me the day off, and that I wanted to spend the day with her.

She kissed me, first on the lips, and then gently on the ear. “I’m so happy to hear that, hon.” She whispered.

I coughed and took a large step back. “Hon” wasn’t something she’d ever called me before. Except on… I suddenly noticed the black handle of a knife poking out of her pocket. “Why…”

She tracked my eyes. “Oh, I was about to do some cooking before you came in and I just shoved it right in my pocket.”

I’d looked her over carefully when I first walked in the door. I was sure the knife hadn’t been there. “I actually think I left something at the office.”

She pushed me against the wall and leaned in once more. “You can stay a little longer, can’t you, Deathlover?”

Our hands met on the knife that she had been in the midst of unsheathing from her pocket. There was a momentary struggle for control before I came out on top and she collapsed to the floor.

“Johnny!” She screamed. “This is a big misunderstanding, I swear!”

“How is this,” I gestured to the knife in my hands. “A misunderstanding?”

“It’s a fetish,” she said. “You subscribed and obviously didn’t call the police so I thought you might be into it. I was gonna pretend to stab you, all those pictures are fake, I promise.” She got up and started walking towards me as I backpedaled into the wall.

“Don’t get any closer,” I said as I raised the knife defensively. “How’d you know that account was mine?”

“I saw you going through my phone last night. When ‘Deathlover’ said he found my account on the dark web I put it together. There’s no way anyone would recommend the account to some random guy on the dark web. I wasn’t completely sure until I saw how you were acting just now.”

I shook my head. “This doesn’t make any sense.”

“Baby, please trust me.”

I lowered the knife ever so slightly before she threw herself at me. I fell against the wall and the knife ended up first on the floor, and then in her control. I fought hard against her but she managed to stab me once in the shoulder before I kicked her off of me.

The knife fell once more and I grabbed it about a half second before her. She tried to hit it out of my hands but I pulled back and slashed her across the chest. The pain caused her to scream and fall to the floor. I took the moment to run into the bathroom and lock the door behind me.

She banged and banged against the door, pleading for my forgiveness and mercy as I called the police and explained what was happening. They arrived within five minutes and arrested her immediately.

They ended up finding her account which led to her being charged with four murders among various other charges. As for me, I was arrested for not turning her in when I had the chance. I’m currently out on bail and awaiting trial.

Regardless of the outcome, I don’t think I’ll ever love again. I’m still trying to understand how someone I loved and trusted so much could be so evil. Sometimes, the darkest monsters are the best at blending in. Sometimes, they’re the ones that we love most.
