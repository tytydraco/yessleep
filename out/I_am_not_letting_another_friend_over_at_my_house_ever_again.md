My current dream right now is to be a normal teenage boy. I just want to hang out with my friends after school, like a normal kid. Considering my circumstances, I can't.

My household is a little different then what I would consider other people's households to look like. I was a little reluctant to bring someone over, but I didn't think thay it would be too different from your average home. I was very wrong. 

The other day, I had gotten an amazing opportunity. One of my friends that I have a huge crush on asked if we could hang out after school. I had told her about my comic book collection, and found out she loved comic books too. I suggested we go to her house to see her comic book collection, but she said she had strict parents who didn't let her bring male friends home after school.

I decided that letting her come to my house was fine.  This was such a good opportunity to finally be with my crush who might like me back. Besides, the visit should go fine, as long as she follows my advice doesn't go where she's not supposed to.

Me and my friend pulled up to a house in her car. It was a small, one story house painted a bright white. It had a light brown roof and a small yet gorgeous garden. The colorful flowers and curvy path leading to the home made the home feel enticing to look at. My friend looked pleasantly surprised by my home, and quickly opened the car door. 

"Wait!" I said as I grabbed onto her arm, "Don't go out! There's something I need to tell you!"

She shook my arm off of her, "Don't touch me like that, but fine, what do I need to know?"

"Cover your mouth and nose like this. Keep your eyes peeled shut as I lead you inside," I said while showing  her what I wanted her to do. It then hit me that she probably isn't going to take these rules seriously. So, I followed with an excuse. "This is because my dad sprayed some dangerous chemicals for the garden. It's really good for the plants, but not for you. I'll guide you inside, alright?"

My friend rolled her eyes at me, thought for a second, and nodded her head. She covered her face just as I showed her. I carefully led her to the front door, religiously checking to make sure she didn't open her eyes even a little. I opened the front door, shoved her inside of the house, and quickly closed it. 

"Alright, you can open your eyes now," I watched as the girl uncovered her face. She looked mildly disappointed at what she saw. The foyer was completely undecorated, other then for an old, stained, dark red carpet.

"This carpet, what is on there, is that...?" She gasped, a disgusted look on her face.

"After my little sister got injured on this rug, we couldn't clean all the blood out. Now, it's stuck in the rug," I interrupted.

"That... That's a horrible injury. There is so much blood in here, even though you tried cleaning it? Is she okay?!" 

"Actually, you should refrain from talking about both her and the rug. She doesn't like it when that happens," I said, "don't question it either, she doesn't like that. Also, there is a sign on her room. Whatever you do, do not knock or open the door, alright? And if you see the door opening, come to my room as quickly as possible. Don't let her see you, alright? Nod your head if yes."

My friend looked at me, tears beginning to form at her eyes. I was already regretting bringing her here. This wasn't the place for her kind after all. She turned back towards the door, but before her hand could reach the knob, I jumped in front of her.

"Do NOT go out. If you leave too early, my PARENTS will know," I said, breathing heavily. My friend put her hand down. 

"We also can't spend too long in the foyer either, so we have to go somewhere else. Let's go into the living room, alright?" I asked her while making the decision for her. I pulled her arm and quietly ran into the living room. 

Me and my friend entered a dully colored room. I thought it was relatively normal looking, but her questions made me realize that it probably wasn't a good idea bringing her here.

"Alright, now we can calm down a bit in here. We can watch TV, and I can bring some of my favorite comics in here-" I was interrupted by my friend.

"W-wait a second, first off, why can't we just go to your room so I can see all of your comics? And second off, what is with that corner over there?" She asked, pointing towards the decorations in the corner.

"...Do you not have decorations in your home?" 

"A pile of skulls is a very, very strange decoration choice!" she whispered, shivering. I realized that I probably should've covered that decoration up with a blanket before bringing her here. 

"Uh, don't worry, they aren't real of course!" I said.

"You know, I don't know whether to believe whether or not that is true, based off of everything else here. But seriously, why is that the only piece of decoration? No plants, no paintings? Just a dusty old couch, a TV, a broken coffee table, and a literal pile of skulls?! Are you kidding me?!" She seemed very angry and tense by now. I didn't know then that people didn't have these kinds of things at their own homes. "Also, answer my other question. Why can't we just go into your bedroom and look at comic books? I don't want to do it in here! The skulls creep me out!"

"If you're too loud coming down the hallway, my sister will hear you. She knows the difference between my footsteps and everyone else's," I said. She had a frustrated look on her face, but sighed and nodded her head. "Good, now since you seem pretty insistent on looking at those comic books, I'll go to my room and get some, alright?" 

She nodded her head yes again, but something told me this wasn't quite right. My intuition was indeed correct, because I noticed her following me down the hallway.

"What?! Go back to the living room, now!" I whispered sternly, pointing in it's direction.

"Well, I'm almost halfway across the hall, so at this point I can just go to your room!" she whispered back.

"No you aren't! Also you're making a ton of noise!" I replied.

"Well... How are we supposed to hook up if we're in the living room?!" she began to raise her voice.

"What?!"

"I didn't want to look at comic books with you dumbass, I just wanted sex!" 

The thing is, my thoughts and intentions about her had always been pure. I wanted romance with her much more then I wanted sex. I thought that this is what I finally found when I found out she likes comics. A cute girl with an interest like mine. A girl who is kind of a weirdo, so maybe she'd accept my living circumstances and my own strangeness, and be with me. That's what I wanted, not this. The feeling of betrayal were already affecting me. Teard rolled down my cheeks, and my former crush looked at me in confusion, wondering what she could have done wrong. She did everything wrong. My sister doesn't like it when someone makes me sad. 

Her hand pushed opened the door and entered the hallway. To be more specific, her hand was almost as big as the doorway to her room, and was covered in lumpy, contorted growths. My crush sprinted for her life out of the hallway, out of the living room and to the door. I heard an ear piercing scream. I covered my ears and waited.

The screams were replaced by low pitched, inhuman groans. It looks like my parents noticed her trying to leave early.

I waited until the groans stopped, then walked into the living room. Sure enough, another decoration was in our room. I broke down into more tears just by seeing it. It didn't have to end this way. I wish I could have a girlfriend.

I wish I could bring human friends to my house.
