Every morning started the same. I’d walk out onto the back porch and see her standing there in the backyard, wearing the same flowery yellow sundress that draped around her like sunlight. The fabric floated around her legs as she moved, brushing the morning air.

I’d watch as her golden curls swayed in the wind, and the moment she turned to look at me, she’d flash a smile that made even broad daylight feel brighter, pushing away every shadow in the world.

As I made my way toward her, she stepped barefoot across the grass, her arms outstretched to meet mine.

“It’s a perfect day, isn’t it?”

She’d say, her voice soft and comforting, touched by a hint of southern charm.

“Every day is perfect when I’m with you.”

I’d say while gazing into her eyes, a window into her soul, one full of beauty and care.

She’d start tracing little circles in my palms with her fingers, a small habit that I strangely loved.

Before I can lean down and gently press my lips against hers, my phone’s alarm goes off, ripping me away from her once again.

I wake, and instinctively reach across the bed, only to find a cold empty space where she once lay. 

In just a week, it’ll be a year since Daisy last kissed me goodbye, and walked out the door, only to be struck by a drunk driver less than a mile from our house.

I’ve heard that grief gets easier with time, that the pain softens, and the memories flourish, but truth is, all time does is put distance between you, and the last moment you were truly happy.

I sat up in bed, just staring at the wall. My mind drifts back to the day we first moved in. How excited she was to finally have a home of her own. She spent the first day just standing in each room, taking it all in, as if the walls were singing to her.

I remember her twirling barefoot in the kitchen, laughing as the afternoon sun poured into the kitchen, a look of pure joy on her face.

I’d have done anything just to see her smile like that.

 I’d give the whole world just to see it again.

We spent the rest of that first day unpacking. By the next morning, she was already sketching out how she wanted to decorate. She always had an eye for interior design, being able to turn dull and mundane looking rooms into something that just felt like, us.

She knew how to make a house feel, alive. Floral paintings brightened the hallway, copper pans gleamed from the kitchen wall as sunlight hit them, and Daisy’s favorite piece, an old, worn-out rotary phone that sat on a small podium right outside our bedroom door.

It didn’t work, but Daisy loved it. She said that it gave the house a heartbeat. Like it was a story that only we knew. I didn’t see the appeal, but I didn’t care. It clearly made her happy, and that was good enough for me.

Now they were just echoes of a happier time. Reminders that she wasn’t here anymore. Once, they were proclamations of her creative spirit.

Now, they’re just things. Cold, silent, witnesses to everything that was now gone.

I finally dragged myself out of bed. The floorboards creaked beneath my feet as I made my way to the kitchen. 

The sun stretched across the room, gleaming off the copper pans hanging on the wall. For a moment, I could almost see her twirling around barefoot in their reflections.

I placed my mug under the coffee maker, and sat down. 

It was quiet.

My eyes shifted towards the Alexa that sat on the counter across from me. 

In my head, I could still hear Fleetwood Mac and Dolly Parton’s voices floating through the house like they once did.

I just sat there, staring out the window as I drank my coffee. Not looking at anything in particular, just staring.

Wanting.

Wishing for something.

 A reason to keep going.

To keep fighting.

Eventually, I pulled out my laptop, and opened my emails. It had been a few days since I last checked them. 

It was mostly junk. Newsletters I never unsubscribed from, promos for a new credit card, insurance I didn’t need. 

But one subject line stood out:

Would you like to book a venue with us, Mr. Mayberry?

It was strange.

Daisy and I had gotten married two years ago, and yet this email was sent last night.

An automatic promotion maybe, One with incredibly bad timing. 

Still I couldn’t help but look at that line:

Would you like to book a venue with us, Mr. Mayberry?

What did they mean?

 My curiosity took over, and I clicked on it.

The email was short, only a few lines.

Your heart aches for her, but she can’t hear you. 
One final vow will bring her back. Call out to her, we can make the appointment 

(323) 416–8729

I stared at the screen rereading the message over and over again.

A prank, had to be. Someone decided it would be funny to mess with me, even though it hadn’t even been a full year since Daisy died. 

Rage built up inside me. I almost deleted the email right then, but another part of me wanted to call the number and give whoever was on the other end a piece of my mind.

I grabbed my phone off the counter, and dialed the number. My breathing was louder than the dial tone in my ear.

I was ready to lay into whoever answered the phone, but when the ringing stopped, a woman’s voice came through. calm, rehearsed.

“Thank you for booking with us. We’ll be sure to reach out to you at more appropriate time. Be sure to pick up.”

The line then went dead. 

I threw my phone across the room in anger. 
Of course they wouldn’t use their real number, how stupid could I be. 
I slid down to the floor. Tears welling up in my eyes. 

One year, I thought I could get through it,but I can’t.

I miss you, Daisy.

I didn’t do much the rest of the day. Mostly sat around, trying to get work done. Numb the entire time.

By ten, I was exhausted and went to bed, hoping I’d feel better by the morning. 

As I slept, I saw her again.

I stepped out on the back porch, and there she was, barefoot in the back yard, staring off into the distance.

The same yellow sundress danced in the wind, the fabric floating around her legs like sunlight come to life.

She turned to look at me, her expression soft, but distant.

I stepped forward to meet her, but as I was about to step off the porch, I bumped into something.

An invisible barrier, separating me from the backyard. From her

“What the hell?” I muttered. Pressing my palm against the air. It was solid. Cold. Like glass

Then I heard her voice

“Sam?” she called out. “Where are you?”

I started pounding on the barrier, calling out to her.

“Daisy! Daisy I’m right here!”

But she didn’t seem to notice. She looked around confused, as if she didn’t know where she was.

I pounded on the barrier even harder, trying desperately to get her attention, but nothing was working.

A thick black fog rolled in from the field. It was slow at first, like smoke sliding across the grass.

Daisy turned towards it.

“No Daisy, don’t go in there!” I screamed.

She didn’t hear me. Her eyes scanned the field, frightened.

“Sam?” Her voice trembled “Sam where are you?” 

I pounded the barrier even harder now, trying desperately to break through.

“I’m right here baby, please just listen to me!”

I watched as the fog began to consume her, starting from her ankles, to her waist, and as I watch her curls disappear into the darkness, I jolted up in bed at the sound of a ringing phone.

For a second, I couldn’t breathe. My chest was tight, and my hands were trembling. It took me a moment to fully realize where I was, and why I woke up.

I grabbed my phone, half expecting to see a missed call or something. But the screen was blank. No missed calls, no messages or anything.

Maybe the ringing was also a part of the dream.

I sat my phone back on the night stand, and lied back down. That’s when I heard it again. The sound of phone ringing. This time coming from the hallway.

That was impossible, the only phone in the house was lying on my night stand, so what the hell was ringing in my hallway?

I sat back up in bed, and stared at the door. The sound kept going, never ending. I stood up, and slowly made my way towards it. 

As I approached the door, I placed my ear against it to get a better listen.

The ringing wasn’t just coming from my hallway, it was right outside the bedroom door.

 I grabbed the doorknob, slowly cracked it open, looking the source of the ringing. 

I found it.

Sitting there on the mantle, next to my bedroom door, was the rotary phone.

It hadn’t worked in decades.

Yet there it was, ringing.

I stood there in the doorway, just staring. It just kept ringing.

Finally, I stepped forward, and grabbed the receiver and held it up to my ear.

“Hello?”

For a few seconds, nothing. Just static, until a voice came over on the other side, male, hushed, and whispered.

“Would you like to book a venue with us Mr Mayberry?”

I stood there in confusion.

“What venue?” I asked.

“A midnight wedding, Mr Mayberry.”

I almost laughed. Not because it was funny, because of how insane this was.

“Is some kind of joke? Is this what you get off on? Messing with people who lost someone? Go fuck yourself.”

The voice on the other end didn’t react. It just continued in a calm monotone voice.

“She still calls out to you. Wondering around, scared, alone. She wishes to reunite with you. Do you wish the same?”

I don’t answer. My hands were trembling, but I still held on to the phone.

“You don’t know what I want.”

The voice grew silent. All I could hear was static. Then eventually,

“Every night, you see her. every morning, you lose her. You’d you like to be with her permanently?”

I fell to my knees as all the anger in me dissipated, leaving nothing but a hollow, empty feeling.

“Yes, I do. More than anything, I want her back”

Another beat. The voice returned, still calm, still hushed.

“Then your venue is booked. We will contact you shortly on what you need to do.”

I just sat there, staring at the floor, unable to say anything.

Before the line cut, I heard one last thing.

“Congratulations, Mr Mayberry.”

The next morning, I woke up to a new email on my laptop.

Your venue is booked, please follow these steps to secure it.

In the body of the email was a list of steps, each one linked to instructions.

Step 1: Call out to her

Step 2: Ground her

Step 3: lead her home

This was ridiculous, insane.

There was no way I was going to do any of this. 

I shut the laptop, and went on with my day, trying to keep it out of my mind.

Still, something kept bothering me. 

How did they manage to call the rotary phone? It was just a decorative piece, there was no way it should have been able to ring.

I kept looking back at my laptop. Tempted to open the email back up, but I left it on the table, and tried to shut it all out of my mind.

Later that night, I had the dream again, only this time instead of walking out to a bright, colorful field, I opened the back door to a black void.

I stood there in disbelief, the thick black fog from before had completely swallowed the back yard.

“Daisy?” I called out, but she didn’t answer.

I stepped towards the steps, and was once again pushed back by the invisible barrier.  

From a distance, I could faintly hear Daisy’s voice. She sounded scared, and weak.

“Sam, please… where are you? Why can’t I find you?”

I pressed against the barrier, desperately crying out to her.

“Daisy! Daisy please I’m right here.”

I looked around through the fog, but couldn’t find a trace of her.

“Daisy! Please!… come back.”

I listened, but all I could hear was the sound of her sobbing. I pounded hard against the barrier, but it didn’t budge.

I was stuck on that porch, while she wandered, lost, and alone.

I listened to the sound of her sobbing until suddenly, she went quiet.

I stood up, my eyes darting around the black fog, looking for her, but to no avail. Then from right behind me, I heard her whisper in my ear.

“Why won’t you come find me”

I jolted up in bed. My heart pounding, and my body in a cold sweat.

For a long time, I just sat there looking around the dark room. Listening to the silence. When I finally calmed down, I headed towards the kitchen to get a glass of water.

As I stood there, glass in my hand, I looked over at the dinning room table, my laptop now sat there face up, with my emails opened.

I sat there and stared at the email for a couple minutes until I finally hovered my curser over the the line,

Step 1: Call out to her

I just sat there staring at it, until I finally decide to click the link.

It read


She calls to you, but she cannot hear your voice. You must reach out, so that she may listen.

Dial our number. When the call connects, recite your wedding vows. This memory is sacred to her. She will hear it.

Do not stop

No matter what you hear on the other line, you must not stop. Continue to recite until your vows are complete. Do not deviate, do not respond.

Once you have finished, end the call immediately. She has heard your voice, and she will follow its sound.

As I read those instructions, I felt my stomach twisting. Recite my vows? That felt wrong to dig up something so sacred.

But her voice echoed in my head.

“Sam, please… where are you?”

I stood up from the table, and made my way to the hallway closet. After digging around for a few minutes, I finally pulled out our wedding box.

It had been so long since I last looked at that box. I opened it, and after searching around for a bit, I pulled out the yellow envelope that contained our written vows.

The paper was still Pristine. Like I had just written it yesterday. I fought back tears as I pulled out my vows to Daisy. Was I really going through with this?

I already knew the answer. 

I stood up, walked to my bedroom with the paper in hand, grabbed my phone, and dialed the number that was thankfully still saved in my recent calls.

I held the phone up to my ear, waiting for the call to connect, but instead all I heard was.

“We’re sorry, but the number you are trying to reach does not exist”

I looked at the screen in confusion. I had dialed the right number, how could it not exist? I called it before, and they answered. 

Then they called me back.

My eyes darted toward the door leading to the hallway. The rotary phone sat there, silent, untouched. 

It was just a decoration. It hadn’t worked in decades. It had no dial, no line, just something Daisy thought had “charm.”

And yet, just last night, it rang, and when I picked it up, a voice came over on the other side.

The longer I stared at it, the tighter the knot in my stomach grew. I didn’t want to believe it, but I couldn’t ignore it either.

I stood up, my vows still in my hand, and made my way to the hallway. I stood in front of the mantle, and picked up the receiver. 

There was static on the other end. Not dead silence. Static. Against my better judgement, I placed my finger on the first number, and began pulling it back.

When I finally dialed the full number, the line clicked, and a voice on the other end simply said:

“Begin”

I held the paper out in front of me, and began reading the words I said to her all those years ago.

“Daisy, I don’t know what I did to deserve you, but I promise to spend the rest of my life trying to be the man that is worthy of your love.”

My voice started to break as I read, but I pushed on.

“Your smile is the most beautiful thing in this entire world, and I promise to never take it for granted. I promise to spend every day giving you a reason to smile”

The static on the other end grew louder, and for a moment I thought I could hear something. I tried to ignore it and pressed on.

“I promise to hold your hand when things get tough, to hold you together, when you feel like falling apart, and to carry you in my arms when you can no longer carry yourself”

“I will protect your heart like it is my own, because it is. I’ll be there when you wake up, and I’ll be there when you fall asleep.”

My eyes began burning as I read the last line.

“When there are days, where you feel lost, I promise to be there as your guiding light. To help pull you out of the darkness.”

I gripped the handle of the phone tightly, as I began sobbing. Before I pulled the receiver away from my ear, I heard a faint voice on the other line.

It was distant, but unmistakable.

“Sam? Sam is that you?”

I paused in disbelief. It was her, it was Daisy’s voice. I almost called her name, but I remembered what the email said.

Do not deviate, do not respond.

Daisy’s voice called out again, she sounded more scared, more desperate.

“Sam, please where are you? I can’t see you, baby please don’t leave me here.”

I slammed the receiver back onto the phone. Tears flooded my eyes. I looked over at the laptop still sitting on the dinning wood table. 

I pulled up the chair, and hovered the curser over the second line.

Step 2: Ground her

Without hesitation, I clicked the link.

She has heard your call, now you must tether her to this world. Take something sacred to the both of you, and place it somewhere outside. Somewhere she felt safe.

Once the object is placed, close your eyes, and listen. 

Do not open them.

Just listen for the sound of her arrival. When you hear it, open your eyes. You will see no change, but you will feel it. 

You’re almost there.

I knew immediately what I needed to get. I walked into my bedroom, opened the closet door, and fished around until I found it. 

Daisy’s flowery yellow sundress. It was a gift from her mother before she passed away. On our wedding day, she opted to wear it instead of the traditional white gown.

She always looked beautiful in it. 

I held the dress for a moment. Running my fingers over the soft fabric, then walked it to the backyard. The sun was beginning to rise, painting the sky in faint streaks of pink and orange.

I gently placed it on the grass, exactly where I’d see her dancing every night in my dreams, weighing it down with a few rocks.

Then I shut my eyes, and waited.

At first, I couldn’t hear anything. Just the sounds of breeze whispering through the air. I tried to drown out every stray thought, and focus entirely on her.

Minutes passed, I just stood there, listening, hearing nothing. I was about to give up, when I heard the sound of footsteps behind me.

“Daisy? Is that you?”

No answer, but the footsteps continued, soft, slow, crunching across the gravel path from the side yard. I could clearly hear that the footsteps were barefoot.

The footsteps made their way from the gravel pit, onto the grass, and I followed the sound, as they made their way in front of me.

I held still, eyes wide shut, waiting for her to say something. 

Then I felt it.

A breeze brushed across my face, but it didn’t move past. It just lingered, warm and still. Like a hand resting against my face.

I opened my eyes, hopeful, but there was nothing there. I looked down, and the sundress was still in the same spot.

Without wasting a second, I turned, and rushed back inside. I plopped down at the table, and clicked the third link.

Step 3: lead her home.

You have tethered her to this world, now you must lead her back home.

Take something meaningful to her, something that she cherished receiving as a gift, take it and make a trail leading from the place of her passing, to her sacred object. 

You must complete this step by midnight. Once you have made it to the sacred object, The Midnight Wedding will begin. 

There she will be yours again.

I looked at the time. It was barely 5:15. None of the stores would be open at this time, so I went back to bed, hoping to be able to rest before I completed the steps. 

I woke at around 3 pm. This time there was no dream, no black fog, no Daisy. I looked over my laptop again, something she cherished as a gift.

I grabbed my keys, headed out to the greenhouse about 30 miles away. 

On our first date, I tried to be funny by giving her a bouquet Daisies, she laughed and said that they were her least favorite flowers. she told me that if I really wanted to impress her with flowers, Peonies were her favorite.

Since then I would give her a bouquet of Peonies for every special occasion. Birthday, Valentine’s Day, even Easter. 

No matter how many times I got her a bouquet of Peonies, she was always appreciative of them.

I arrived at the greenhouse at around 3:30, I picked out every bouquet they had, there were around 200 peonies.

The cashier gave me a strange look as she checked me out. I paid no attention to her. 

I arrived home at around 4, and began cutting the stems off every peonie, leaving only the flower heads. By the time I finished, it was around 10:50.

I took my bags full of flower heads, and headed outside. I stood in front of the sundress, and placed one down, then another, then another.

I continued on until I reached the front yard. I paused for a moment, it was pitch black outside the glow of the porch light. I pulled out my phone, turned on the flashlight, and kept going.

Eventually, I reached the block where she died. I checked the time, 11:48. I had to hurry up. I still had a full bag left, so I began dumping them on the ground leaving a trail.

As I did this, I looked up, and saw it. 

The cross her family left at the side of the road. I approached it, and read the name

Daisy Mayberry 1998-2024.

I’ve driven past this cross countless times, but this was the first time it really sank in. I knelt down in front of it, placing my hand gently on top.

“I love you” I whispered “I’m not leaving you in that darkness”

I reached my hand into the bag, pulling out a handful of flowers, and spread them all across the memorial. I then dumped the rest of the bag along the road, I wasn’t sure the exact spot that she had died in, but I was certain I had covered it.

I checked my phone again, 11:51. I dropped the bag, and took off, jogging back home, following the trail I had made. The wind picked up as I ran.

As I reached my street, my phone shut off, taking the flashlight with it. That didn’t matter anymore, because I could see a flickering light coming from my backyard.

I got closer, and I could start to hear music, 19th century ballroom music. Faint at first, like it was playing from a warped record.

When I stepped onto my driveway, I saw that my front porch light was now shut off. The only light came from the back yard, casting strange shadows across the lawn.

I made my way to the side yard, that’s when I felt a hand grab my shoulder.

“Congratulations Mr Mayberry.”

It was the same voice I heard on the phone. Before I could turn to look at him, he wrapped something around my eyes.

“You cannot look. When it is all over, you will have her again.”

He guided me around the house, and into the backyard. As we moved, I started to hear voices around us, dozens of them.

They weren’t speaking words I could understand. It sounded like whispers through water, like a dream where voices surround you, but none of it makes sense.

My heart began racing, my body shaking. 

What was I doing? 

I can’t go through with this, it’s unnatural, it’s not right.

“I don’t want to do this anymore” I said, my voice trembling. “Please stop!”

“Shh, don’t worry.” The voice said “it’ll be over soon.”

He brought me to a stop, and guided me to hold out my hands. 

As I did, another pair of hands took hold of mine, and I immediately jerked back.

“Who are you? Please, I changed my mind, I.. I can’t do this!”

The man gently took my wrist, and placed them back into the waiting hands.

“Just hold her hands until the ceremony is complete.

I held the other hands, they were smooth, almost like plastic. The man stood beside us.

“Allow us the begin the ceremony.”

I could barely hear him over my hyperventilating. I felt the presence of dozens of figures surrounding me. 

My hands trembled in the other pair’s. I decided that I needed to take off the blindfold. I had to see what was happening to me.

Daisy was dead. There was no changing that. Whatever this was, it wasn’t going to bring her back. I had to stop it, I had to get away.  

I was just about to pull the blindfold off, when the other hands began tracing small circles in my palm with their fingers. 

Then I heard her voice.

“It’s a perfect day isn’t it?”

My heart stopped at the sound of her voice. That soft tone, her comforting cadence, and the faint hint of her Georgia Accent. It was her. She was here, right in front of me.

In that moment, every ounce of fear and panic drained from my body, replaced by something warm and safe. I gripped her hands tighter, not even realizing that mine had stopped trembling.

“Are you ready to begin Mr. Mayberry?”

I let out a long, cathartic breath.

“Yes”

Daisy locked her fingers with mine, and the man began speaking.

“We gather here in the hour between day, when the veil is thin and the breath of the world slows.

We gather to bind the souls of the departed and the longing.

Daisy Mayberry, called by name, and tethered through love. You have pierced the veil between life and death to reunite with your beloved.”

The wind began to pick up as the man spoke.

“Samuel Mayberry you have called out to her. She listened. You tethered her to this world. She came. You lead her to this very moment. Now she is here. 

Do you bind your soul with hers? Will you accept her, not as she once was, but as she is now?”

My throat tightened, but I swallowed it down.

“Yes, I do”

There was a pause, then the man spoke up one last time.

“Then she is tethered to you forevermore. May she be forever yours”

I rushed to remove the blindfold. Ready to see her again, but when I opened my eyes, the backyard was empty. All there was, was the flowery, yellow sundress lying on the ground.

“Daisy?”

I looked around for her, but there was nothing, and no one. As if I had just hallucinated the whole ordeal. 

The wind died down, and I was left feeling alone, more than I ever had before. I collected the sundress, and made my way back inside. I placed it on the dinning room table, and looked around at the mess. 

It was a problem for tomorrow, I was incredibly tired, and I made my way to my bedroom.

I lied down in my spot on the bed, all I could think about was how foolish I could be. It was now exactly one year since Daisy died, and I was in a far worse state than I had ever been.

I began drifting into sleep, I instinctively rolled over in bed, placing my arm on her side. My arm wrapped around someone lying in the bed with me.

I shot up, and ran towards the light switch. When the light came on however, there was no one there. My eyes scanned the room, but there was no one there.

I must be delirious I thought to myself. I shut the light back off, and hopped back into bed. right before I fell into a deep slumber, I heard the sound of a familiar voice.

“Good night Pumpkin.”

The next morning, I was awoken by the sound of music coming from the kitchen. I walked in to hear Dolly Parton coming in from the Alexa over on the counter top.

I looked around. The mess from last night was completely gone. No flower stems, no pedals scattered everywhere. The wedding box was somehow back in the closet, and the sundress laid neatly folded on the table.

I stopped the music and sat down. 

“What’s going on” I said to myself.

I began rubbing my hand over my eyes in an attempt to fully wake up. As I did this, I felt a pair of hands gently grab my shoulders. I jerked up, and looked behind me, but nothing was there.

My heart began to race. None of this made sense. My mind went to last night.

Had it all been a dream? 

I grabbed my phone and headed straight to the living room. When the screen lit up, I saw a photo of me and Daisy on our wedding night and the date. 

June 17,

Exactly one year since she’s been gone. I could feel the grief rushing me again. I shut my eyes, and leaned my head back on the couch. 

“I love you” I said aloud.

Then, from right beside me, I heard

“I love you too”

I fell out of the seat, and onto the floor. My eyes darted across the room, looking for whoever just said that, but there was nothing there.

It was her voice, Unmistakable. But why couldn’t I see her?

My mind went to last night. How I was blindfolded, and not allowed to look at her. The gears turned in my head, and I shut my eyes once again, and waited.

I sat back up on the couch, waiting to see what would happen. Then after a minute, I felt her hand slip into mine. 

It was her, no doubt about it. Her hand was soft, and warm. With my other hand, I followed the shape of her arm, up to her face, feeling her rest her cheek in my palm. 

Her skin didn’t feel the way it used to. It was too smooth, too flawless, almost like warm plastic, but I didn’t care. She was here, she was with me again.

“Can you stay in today?” She whispered “I just want you to hold me”

Tears once again filled my eyes, and I opened them to look at her, but as soon as my eyelids separated, she was gone.

Tears welled up in my eyes again, and I opened them. Desperate to see her again, but the moment I did, she was gone.

It’s been this way for a while. Whenever I have my eyes closed, I can feel her, I can hear her, but the moment I open them, she’s gone.

I don’t know why I can’t see her. Maybe that’s the price for having her back, maybe it’s sacred for her to stay unseen, but every time she comes back to me, I can’t help myself from peeking. Every time I do, she’s gone.

So I’m going to make sure I don’t look anymore.

I’m writing this because it might be the last chance I get, I’ve got the small knife in my hand now. It’s small and sharp, it’ll get the job done, and from now on, every day will be perfect.

To the one who performed the ceremony, Thank You. You’ve given me my life back.


If you’ve lost someone, and they contact you about the midnight wedding, you might think it’s a hoax, you might ignore it. 

Don’t

They can give you exactly what you want.

I love you Daisy Bell Mayberry. Every day is a perfect day when I’m with you.
