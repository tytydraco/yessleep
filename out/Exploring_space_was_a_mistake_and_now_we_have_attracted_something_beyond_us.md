Hello, my name is Brandon. And we only have a month until that thing eventually comes for our planet. To explain the situation to you, we have to go back, a year back specifically. The year was 2025 and we had advanced majorly in technology. Almost like a miracle, we were able to create a spaceship that could reach speeds up to the speed of light on December 31st. In the year 2026, we prepared the ship for launch. I was the second pilot of the ship. We had decided to name the ship: Infinity. It was very suiting for the time but now I wish we hadn’t even created that god damn ship.

Anyhow, the launch was a success and we explored the infinite cosmos, finding more unique planets. We also found other planets habitable like Earth. K-12, K-289b, and K-50a. To continue with the main story, we received an signal from a universe far away. In curiosity, we decided to make a course towards where the signal came from. But I wish we hadn’t. Curiosity kills the cat as they say.

Once we reached the location, it felt unreasonably cold. Sure, we were in a spaceship out in the middle of space but we had heaters for that problem. The heaters weren’t deterring the cold in the slightest. What really freaked me out is that there were an….absence of planets. There were only asteroids. We were able to navigate around the asteroids and we picked up the same signal from before. It was farther away this time, almost as if it was moving. Of course, we shrugged it off. As we explored more through the universe, we stumbled into something. Something terrifying. A gargantuan monster came at us from behind a star with a deep-bellowed roar. The roar echoed throughout the ship, petrifying everyone in fear.

Its presence was choking. I felt myself subconsciously gulp as the 800-foot king monster got closer. Looking back on it, its size was unbelievable. Our spaceship was 563-feet long, which was the tallest spaceship we had ever created. You know the leviathans from subnautica?

That creature reminded me of the ghost leviathan. Just the presence of it almost made instinctively run away in fear. It was worse for the others though. Some were on their knees, crying and struggling to breathe. It was only until that I snapped back to my senses that I woke everyone from their trance. Quickly, we operated the ship and got the fuck out of there. Unfortunately, it has been following us back to Earth. They said I couldn’t share this information to the public or I’ll be killed but who fucking cares at this point. I fucking dare them to. Even if I do die and they somehow finish the preparations for the ship, what second pilot would they have? I really hope we have enough time to prepare the ship for launch. Otherwise, we’re all dead. Good luck everyone. If I can, I’ll update you guys later.
