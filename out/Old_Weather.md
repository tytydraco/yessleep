Something's happening in Arizona. You had to be there. Let me tell you how I got married to the “say less” lifestyle of party till your underground.



With the explosion of social media on the internet reaching maturity, city exclusive entertainment has become par for the course on how lifestyles are stereotyped. If you post a selfie out clubbing you get “hype beast flexing on domesticated dorks”, cred for example. If you don’t have any recent selfies out in the city with your crew posted you are obviously more sober than thou. Overtime, however, attention has shifted to internet social media influence being balanced out by the poster documenting the regular status exclusive to locals only. The neighborhood mom and pop taco shop on the corner for example. Soon after that the domesticated dorks started covering the need for a geeks vanity mirror by streaming and vlogging bedroom hobby virtuosity. With every city, town, and neighborhood now covered in neon E-guise, some self-proclaimed real internet housewives like myself grew bored of the same semi-professional persona every content creator had and started moving towards amateur content creators, but I always felt too voyeuristic then to consume that slice of life.



My name is Beverly. I am  27 years old and single in every way. The pandemic and subsequent lockdown in 2020 put my computer science degree and anti social workaholism to great use after a gratefully safe and lonely college career. My life by numbers predictable goal chasing made my molestable baby face blonde bombshell early life into something of an autosexual open love letter fuck you to an intrusive world in my auto pilot head canon. I was famously attractive and tragically oblivious to hard to get complimentary behavior. Not only that, I thought girls too undisciplined to merit a healthy diet and fitness habit for pure optimizing were too indirect in their ploys to earn me as the hot naive friend, so I just stayed alone until graduation and landed a work from home office job. It wasn’t until during the pandemic that I noticed the literal autism I had after putting down the books I hit and picked up the internet for revenge porn on justifying my 2024 risk averse championships participation trophy..



 Scrolling started becoming synonymous with an SAT body language flash card review I self assessed just in case I was ever a guest judge on a panel along side the world wide web class performers reviewing the newest viral person’s slang integrity. My boredom about this started making me feel semi-professional as I got stoic in my deconstruction of innocent fun, so I decided to try the newest social media trend that even the internet hadn’t marketed in 250 words or less and just went outside to curate my feed AKA watch the grass grow. 



Sitting outside in the park a walk down from my apartment my pessimistic feelings of being behind on trends began to grow. Only the random homeless encounters I overheard made me feel like my social adjacent skill set was valid.  



There was news spreading about underground to dos by sun burnt drifters in on the excitement of penny wise tone delivering a business pitch if you got the bag and wears suggested otherwise. Of course though, the great equalizer is the white collar etiquette of the inside voice, both employed and off the clock. A national identity, you could even say a global anomaly. Word on the street where I'm from is the less than paranormal strip club with private rooms, or smoke shop that sells potpourri that's not for human consumption. The regular good ol capitalism cliches that turned me off from exploring around., but this is where Arizona came in.



Arizona was the loudest whisper amongst them I gathered on my less than coincidental walks through their temporary settlements around the park. Smack dumb in the middle of the Wild Wild West, Arizona has become known for two things, the snow birds that come in for the winter, and the locals keeping the place hot all year long. Grandchildren of wealthy retirees growing up to be platinum elites with signature orange skin. Grandchildren of religious pioneers growing up to be the sleepy American dream here in a desert oasis. Grandchildren of Native Americans keeping the classic good looks lifestyle competitive. Grandchildren of immigrants who traveled alongside the railroad they helped build. 



The news I concluded about Arizona through weeks of slang eavesdropping was of unofficial 24/7 365 burning man like gatherings that were equated to have been the national conference of inside voices for thieves cant polyglots that happened sometime between now and 2020.The “you had to be there” witnesses now peppered Arizona hosting pop up impromptu seminars. 



These sun burnt drifters seemed to have gone to several of these types of scenes across the nation and spoke of spellbinding witches in Salem Massachusetts becoming an elite class too but that landed blandly to me, so did the hillbilly Bigfoot homesteaders some lumberjacked with in the forests of Washington. I began to grow sick of the FOMO of long walks on the beach as eye candy for surfers and skinny dipping at the lake with the college spring breakers the basic bitches bucket listed about, and I was also suspect of the air quotes partying for the fad of beating the bell curve odds and returning to uncanny sobriety as a cracking young 40 year old.



Maybe it was suicidal ideation from career comfort shuddling me through high school, college, and intern life into my interest being a flat rate fee routine, but truly this moment in time felt like my chance to be cool about something that was properly rated.



I continued to eaves drop while staring at the grass and this is what I heard. Arizona offered urban tourism catered by the dirty dozen of drug addled luminaries. The desert druids vision questing for your divination. The rumor was that the locals and established settler families had vetted a pseudo mystic movement approach to the art of specializing people watching not available through academia or the traditional courtship diet. They speak your presence into the occasion coming from the highest,lowest, broadest, and narrowest states of animation drugs can encourage through their individual taste for the toxin. Nothing personal from them because the Michelin chef restaurant food critics of chemically altered perception critique the peripherals of your stranger persona cutting into their exclusive group think. A still life oration of confidence. Hardcore drug addicts flock to Az to be strained for their interest in the substance available. Just like me I paused to think, but I'm sober. 



The call to adventure to return with a suntan postcard grew into a pale faced pre traveling to do list. I was listening to my walls talk. With big entertainment comes big opportunists keeping it sanctioned for the obvious benefits of segregating to speak easy of it. The long and short of it was the criminal nature was professionalized by those investing their livelihoods in it. Beware of the suits. Organized is organized on and off paper. I began to grow a preference for my innocent feelings toward exploring the Grand Canyon instead. As the days passed I figured I could get away with an accidental trespass into their red light district on the way to the rest of what the beautiful state could offer. Maybe a vacation from my shuttle life was all I looked for. After a few weeks of my domesticated dork routine I decided to YOLO it and sought to be a witness for what could be my “you had to be there.” That’s you only live once for those who are uncool and werent there for early internet.



After landing in Arizona, some of the superstitious aura of the legends started evaporating away, not in small part by the  + degree temperatures that were minimum during the summers. Nothing about the Phoenix airport felt different than the one I took off from, but as soon as I got on the lite rail, I spotted some cleaned up folks who obviously sleep on the street that noticed my objective once over. 



The conversation happened quickly. A nod. An expectant customer service grimace. Weight fell off my shoulders when the youngest face of the group began asking everyone on the way to me if they had any change. I shuffled through my purse like a church visitor surprised by how much tithing strangers were donating. I pulled out a twenty. 



"Is this enough?"- Beverly



"Any change mam?"- Druid Guy 1



"More?"- Beveryly



"Enough is enough, thank you."- Druid Guy 1



My heart flipped in my chest as his eyes lingered a little too long in mine. It was a knowing look.



"A twenty? Jackpot, how obvious."- Teen 1



"Asshole."- Teen 2 



"What?"- Teen 1 



A group of on the other side of literail talked in our direction as I began to notice a novel grin breaking out on my face. 



"We know. How convenient that they got off at the same stop."- Teen 3



"Don't lose your mind over it, you copy?"- Teen 1



"Asshole. Not again."- Teen 2



"Alright alright. Sorry."- Teen 1



"How weird, stops here."- Teen 4



An older cleaned up street camper stood up and moved ahead of the group towards the exit. Just like me the others grabbed their belongings quickly in a shared panic to exit onto the platform unexpectedly. 



"Need help with your bags lady? Haha"- Grown guy 1



"Yea please, uhh I'm here for the Grand Canyon."- Beverly



I noticed another group of suntan cleaned up street camper individuals exit a rideshare car as the group I just donated a 20$ to entered. The man with the young face waved at me as the car drove off. The new group nodded in my direction. The rumours were true. It was organized.



"Hm, here's as good as anywhere."- Older Male Druid



"So what's there to fix now."- Female Druid



"Moore concrete sleeep oor?"- Haggard Male Druid



"Hehe"- Granny Druid



I found myself noticing the evidence of days with little to no sleep and exposure on their faces as I chuckled along with them from afar. 20 dollars seemed cheap. I was prepared to spend hundreds and even thousands for a once in a lifetime trip. Maybe they were not for real and it was a coincidence.



"How about the other direction?"- Female Druid



"Sounds good."- Older Male Druid



I felt my blood thicken and my vision blur as several singular eyes flicked in my direction as I began walking in time with the group across the platform onto the other lite rail train heading back toward the airport. Too many began a phone call after side eyeing me to ignore but I chalked it up as coincidence too. Here I was on a boujie vacation and I wasn’t about to let commoners interrupt my sober than though stomp through the woods. The passengers paused conversation as I noisily boarded with all my luggage after the tour guide group I hired. The seats were against each wall facing the other and I sat across from them. My bags took up an entire row. Were they sleep deprived and catching a nap on the lite rail or were they already smashed for my turn at being divinated?



"Interest rate flat fee forwarded to me"- Older Male Druid



"Payment for civil works"- Druid Male



"So what's there to fix now?"- Female Druid



"Moore concrete sleeep oor bore dumb?"- Haggard Male Druid



"Hehe"- Granny Druid



I found myself noticing my heart rate slow and senses dull as I chuckled along seated with them hoping they would make it more obvious that I was the mark. Just like watching grass grow, I thought.



"Dang tourist heckling our local druids."- Guy 1



"Weather just shy from dry here in Az, right?"- Guy 2



All of the sudden an orange glow began blinking in and out from somewhere in between my depth perception. My face was rubbery as I stared expectantly at the acknowledged druids recalling the goal was- 



"Right? Oh ‘rite’ right. Tree hugger nursery time."- Lady 1



The color again absorbed my attention becoming a lucid interest as if I were reading characters on a page.Time seemed to thicken along with my underwhelm as fluid lines of dull neon emanated off of the faces of the guides I anchored the square of my face staring all of the doubt I could project. They were speaking but it came across as noise compared to the vivid neon water color hallucinations that became unignorable.  A wide toothy smile broke across my now clammy face as I again chuckled, noticing fishy features appear like a glowing second face around their face. Was I having a psychedelic experience just from staring at some small time scene queers. What have I been missing doing this over my phone! A pressure down the center of my skull coincided with the pulsing color filling into a matte red. I was too rich with my life savings on the line to care about anyone except the classiest of these mystics. I came prepared knowing I was now a guest judge like I fantasized except it was with some drug addict street camp--.



"Suits you"- Male Druid



"Your not barking enough if it suits you"- Female Druid



"Sh-ark? Me?"- Male Druid



"Cold bitch from a mutts sh-one"- Female Druid



"Rough draft of homework? We pride."- Older Male Druid



"Paart doone, I choose."- Haggard Male Druid



"Hehe.”- Granny Druid



Panicked feelings began to grow alongside the clarity of my teeth thumping with expectant nerves. A scene outside the window floated into my interest like a jellyfish. The entire sky was separated by a glowing film that was slowing churning like the surface of a pool. My stomach growled at the sight of glowing flocks of birds of different colors. Birds with the same fishy silhouette as the guides who slowly nodded once. I wanted something more visceral than the visual feeling of there’s always a bigger fish. WHERE’S THE PARTY!



"Big deal."- Female Druid



"Great white and doll eyes while chomping at the bit, looks like her love craft finds those lookin to be missin."- Male Druid



What did they recognize me as! Proudly I felt unlike myself wanting to try my hand at content creating instead of judging so impersonally, but making something up made me feel like a child- Suddenly my selfish single mindedness shifted to something that felt foreign to my memory and imagination. One colossal inky figure loomed slowly- No it was swimming into the grain of my vision from some deep gloom behind the watercolors safe familiarity. It had the same blurry detail the moon has viewed from a night on earth. My stomach growled at the idea that it was just as big and so did my brain. 



Pssd!!- Beverly 



The weight of its cold impersonal attention singled me out from however impossibly far away it was as it’s movement prioritized what was unmistakable to me as hunting prey. Child-like fear hit me as my vision was swallowed by red. I would fight my predator this time now that I was over my life. This triggered a tectonic rumble that grew loud enough to rattle my teeth. 



"aaaaAAAAA!"- Beverly



"Ma'am!"- Mom 1



My head whipped to the side towards the sound of a voice as I let out the rest of the yell I held through clenched teeth. A mother drew her young daughter closely to her as the druids shrugged slightly.



“Don’t stare at strangers sweetie.”- Mom1



“She was mooning me mom.”- Child1



"Dang tourist get a night life if you are scared by the red light district in your eyes."- Guy1 



"He saying blink, you're lookin into your blank account checkin if its really empty.”- Young Man



"Settle into the reefer madness, everyone knows what smokin second hand marry wanna is."- Guy 2



“The way they staring like we’re praying for them, they hopin the abyss say something back or something, but it only stares back.”- Old Guy 



I blinked at the brightness of the halogen lights as I glanced around noticing nothing fishy glowed any longer. My body was wound tight and I was damp with sweat. It felt like I had fought for my right to party and now I was ready for the championships! WHERE’S THE PARTY! 



“It’s supposed to be gazing, to reference Nietzsche.”- Old Guy



“Exactly”- The druids answered in unison.



"Here they go. The black and white suits hoping to smoke more virgin marry with the white lie habit misses."- Lady 2 



"Gen Alpha has these geezers crying wolf."- Guy 1



"Well she did look beyond thirsty."- Guy 2



“Better than being a history luddite. Who’s bright idea was that?”- Lady 2



“Luddite?“- Beverly



“Blank blank.I mean, blink blink? Love at first sight? Like metal machine averse.”- Young Man



The guides nodded once as I noticed my head finished with them.



"Big deal."- Druids/Beverly



We said together flatly. I was still just hearing noise no matter how hard I stared at them. No body made me feel interested the way I expected from the rumours. Nobody even poetically alluded to the colossal inky figure I hallucinated. 



"Totally married to the idea, huh. Pride flag lady. They are total junkies. No name lifestyle until you get the toxics down.You’re better off coming out on your own first."- Young Man



"Better than a weathered basic bitch inside voice."- Lady Druid



"Yea, nothing fishy out here."- Male druid



"Show us?! These rumors talk about code talking shamans but all I ever got was proud silence."- Guy 3



"Look for us. The weather we smoke is past behind wolves. Nothing cool from you pixel junkies crowding a small black period.”- Male Druid



"Shark shark"- Young Man



"That's the great white park huh keyboard."- Female Druid



"Hehe"- Granny Druid 



The young man's face grew rubbery and flashed a wide toothy grin. A grin I almost reflexively mimed. It wasn't the same feeling as the second hand from the druids but I saw some color glow in my eyes again. Were we not sharing a hallucination? Suddenly I wanted off the lite rail train and on the soonest plane back home to my routine. A smile broke out on my face at the memory of it before my stomach growled and a colossal inky figure loomed out of the grain of my depth perception again. For some reason the circumstances didn’t convince me I was being hunted by it this time.



“What they mean to say in between basic bitching at you for prying is that you may go out and accidently find someone with black and white groom intentions hoping you go missin consensually with them without knowing how to judge their business merit in the working relationship. These guys are hardcore and do this every day probably. You know? Junkies for the miss understanding. Blink.. blink. This made me feel so young to watch but I think you need to know there’s old weather to peak into in every square inch of every space bar.”- Older Lady  



"Get a room you two"- Guy 2



"Big deal."- Older Male Druid



"Equivalent exchange."- Older Lady



"Fair weather."- Older Male Druid



"Damn doom scrollers. The algorithm is so old school. Meme stonks by name is the name of the game, lady. Do you ponder the rectangle?"- Young man



Saying nothing I turned back towards the guides. I didn’t want to be recognized as an internet dork. I wanted to be at the party championships! They nodded once.



“The cold shoulder.. ouch. It might be the blue light from your rectangle making your eyes soar. Minding memes or minding me?”- Young Man



“Wow you really do look out for virgin marry wanna be smoke-ers.”- Older Lady



“Thanks dood”- Young Man



“Hehe.”- we both laughed 



“You don’t see that every day.”- Guy 1



“For real.. Damn tourists.. It’s a regular city here.”- Guy 2



“Annnnnnd here come the ‘sober’ black and white court ship artists.”- Guy 1



My stomach growled. I felt let down by how unamazed I was by the whole experience. Maybe they were small time tour guides and I could find some worth more than 20 dollars. All I got was some bigger fish hallucination. Remembering I came here prepared for a party gave me a wide toothy grin. There’s more tour guides than these cheap small timers. I bet I could pass off as a tour guide. Yeah. I’m the world wide web class tour guide and I’m a CHAMPION!



“All grey for the bark park walkers huh great white?”- Cold Man



A man was staring at me rather coldly. 



“Blank blank until you see read.”- Cold man



I flashed him an impatient glare. He had his phone on his lap which appeared to be on a conference call with more than 3 people. He nodded in the direction of the young girl. Her face was rubbery and she had eyes the size of dinner plates. The pressure in the middle of my head strained on my skull as a strong flash of red filled my vision. Did I give off psychedelic feedback like the druids? Maybe I stressed her ou-



“Beverly.”- Young Girl



She said my name like a mantra just behind a women’s voice coming out of the cold man’s phone that shocked me back into my fight to party!.Screw tree huggers and their psychedelics! If it was over the phone I’m in the championships! The lite rail slowed to a stop at the next platform by the airport where a pale man in a chauffeur outfit wearing a lidless smile was holding a sign with Beverly written on it.



“Don’t side eye sweetie.”- Mom 1



Her face relaxed



“I was reading mommy.”- Young girl



“No kidding…. You come across as a tourist. Your name is a local meme already, I can s-ell.”- the man said coldly hanging up the phone call.



I whipped my head in shock at the young girl before her mom picked her up and exited the lite rail. My neck stiffened as the anonymity left my body followed by a cold sweat. I watched them walk past the chauffeur undistracted and boarded the other lite rail car going in the same direction. I began grabbing my bags in a hurry. The young girl, the woman on the phone, the cold man, and chauffeur had me convinced that I sold my name to pay an entrance fee into the party CHAMPIONSHIP! I made eye contact with the chauffeur. As I did a faint crackle of static buzzed in my ears as I mimed a nod he gave to me.



“The deep end is a love craft for us lookin to be missin.”- Beverly



I declared outloud to no one in a voice that seemed to be fed to with a crackle of static. 



“Go ahead and shallow mister machine me then scooby snack. Your meme, I mean name is going old school viral. School of fish. Human traffic. What sign do you need?”- Young Man



“Seems consenual”- Granny druid



His flirtation hit me in my habit of ignoring ploys of me playing hard to get. My vision cleared from all the color and the sensation in the pit of my stomach moved into my muscles and nerves making me feel alive with competitive anticipation. The rubbery smile changed into a plastic one that rang bells in my brain. I was a viral hype beast flexing for cred on this domesticated dork!



“Beverly Hills here I come! Wooo!!”- Beverly



My confidence grew into hedonistic certainty hearing the crackle of static behind the words I recited like a script replaced my autosexual self absorbed feelings.. Enormous amounts of euphoria began washing over me as I felt that my awkward life story of average success would have a legitimate underground moment in time you had to be there for to be one of those people!. I walked out of the lite rail glancing at the group of druids and immediately felt hesitation as the color in my eyes returned paired with the nervous growl in my stomach. 



“Always piss tested for talks in. Rumor had it we fit the description to say high.”- Granny Druid



“Nice basic bitch you bark bark.”- Young Man



They shared a nervous chuckle.



I pushed the humour out of my face and improvised a plastic frown at them feeling temporarily ungrateful. Is that how disloyal they are to their champion! He’s wasn’t even putting his whole life on the line! Then I remembered that 20 dollars worth of second hand psychedelia didn't compare to what my name was worth trading for in my quest to feel alive for once. I redrew the plastic smile and the crackle of static came back as I  matched the chauffeurs micro expressions. Curious anticipation spread into  my nerves and muscles again washing me of the water color 20 dollars bought.

	

“Beverly?”- Chauffeur 



His voice sounded well rehearsed like it was used as an instrument.

	

“Yes. I’m Beverly.”- Beverly



“Great, we have been expecting you. Let me take your bags.”- Chauffeur



The pale man grabbed my things and gestured to a limousine where he athletically with professional sleekness packed them into the trunk before opening the door for me without ever losing his smile. There was a group of people dressed in matching outfits inside wearing plastic smiles that put me at ease and evidence of little to no sleep on their face that all shouted. 



“Beverly!”- Strangers

	

“Yes! I’m Beverly!”- Beverly 

	

I climbed inside and noticed the men wore matching vests and black slacks while the girls wore                 matching dresses of light pink. Plastic spread to my eyes as they were the only portions of my body that were not buzzing with overwhelming excitement. At the far end of the limousine a man wearing a tuxedo with an extra dark  jacket motioned me toward him as the chauffeur closed the door. The sound of a heavy lock clicking from the outside.



“Hello Beverly, welcome inside. Mint?”- He opened a small metal tin box in front of me                containing capsules and pressed pills of different colors and sizes. 



“PSSD!”- someone whispered loudly outside the limousine as it started pulling away from the airport parking lot.



“Yes piss. I mean, yes please.”- I reached randomly for one placing it on my tongue and swallowing as my attention made out a blurry silhouette of someone outside the window waving their hands over their head.



“Remember basic memes!”- Young man



I heard the young man from the lite rail muffled yell bleed through the limousine as my stomach growled. My smile never broke though there was a short break in the static in my ears as I noticed how everyone in the limousine seemed to be blissfully ignoring anything happening outside. The pill hit my stomach and euphoria began rooting itself as the priority of my focus.



“Where are we going?”- Beverly



“We are already here, Beverly. All of us are officially missing in a few days. Do you understand?”- Tuxedo Guy



“Yes, I do.. Black period championships.”- Beverly



“Say less.”- Group



We all said this together just behind the crackle of static.



“I’m Beverly.”- Beverly



The plastic in my smile began spreading to every inch of space I had faster than I could think as the static blurred my vision.



“Say less.”- Group



We all said this together just behind the crackle of static.



“...”- Beverly 



The mystery man in the tuxedo nodded and sat back comfortably in his chair as we all followed suite. No one spoke. There was a knowing agreement that we all simply kept the colossal inky silhouette of his suite as the priority of our attention as we sat looking forward enjoying a nameless static luxury.
