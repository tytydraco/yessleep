For a quick backstory i served 14 years in the military and from this time period I experienced a lot of scary/disturbing things but this one is the one I will never forget.


It was my 8th year in the military we were in a group of 3 in a mission to Pakistan to destroy an enemy bunker.

We were dropped from a plane with supplies on the country border each solider had 2 guns 3 granades 3 liters of water food to last a couple of days and a C-4.

The plan was to walk 5 miles north from where they drooped us there was the enemy bunker we had open the hatch by placing a C-4 and on it and activating it, after it was open we needed to throw 3 grandest inside and run back to the dropping spot where they would fly us back.


We started the walk north we were in the middle of nowhere no people no cars no houses Just desert.


Me and the other 2 guys(mark and John) started talking Mark said "this whole mission seems strange why didn't they give us more details.
John replied " I don't know but that's the mission we gotta follow the instructions"
I said John's right don't ask questions just follow orders"
Mark said "ok but when something weird start happening don't complain to me.


After an hour of walking we arrived at the bunker everyone was ready except Mark he was looking nervous we ignored his suspicions though because we had to focus.

John carefully placed the C-4 on the hatch and we all got 30 meters away from it, John detonated it and it opened the hatch.

I ran to the bunker and threw the 3 grandes down there I waited a few seconds after the explosion and ran back to the group but I slipped and fell to the bunker.


I looked around the place and I was empty no people, no army gear, no computers no nothing.


Mark came to get me back he shouted "get out of here and let's go john is running away I can't wait for you much longer"
I told him "look at this place it's empty what the fuck were we even exploding"

Mark said "you're the one who said just follow orders what do you want".

I replied "I know you are curious too let's check what we risked our life for"

Surprisingly Mark agreed. He got down and we took a look around the bunker we found an open steel door.

I said "come on let's check what's inside".

Mark said "ok but after this we are out of here".
I agreed and I opened the door mark didnt come inside with me because he was too scared, inside there was a room with just a desk in it on the desk there was a note,  this is what was written in the note:
"So you got here I gotta say I never thought they would send you here, well I guess they did it I'm sorry but I can't tell you what was  this room used for let's just say you probably don't want to know".

I was disturbed from this, I felt like someone was watching me I noticed below the note was a picture,the picture captured 2 men smiling in the room and behind them was a tall black creature I couldn't tell what it was but I Knew it wasn't human.

It was taller than the room and the room was about 9 feet tall from what I remember. 

I left the room and mark said "so what was in there?"
I didn't want to scare him more so I said "nothing just another empty room"

He said "weird" with a little chuckle.

We were climbing up a ladder the leave the bonker Mark got out first but before I left I heard a little laugh coming from the room I looked there and I saw the black creature smiling inside the room I could only see the head but I knew it was atleast 10 feet tall.

I was terrified and climbed the fastest I can outside
Mark said "whoa what happened?"

I replied "nothing just got a little claustrophobic that's it"

I couldn't tell Mark I knew he will get too scared and i didn't want to disturb him.

We ran to the dropping point there was waiting for us a small plane
John shouted at us "where the hell were you?"
I told him " my leg just got stuck sorry"

He said "next time watch where you're going"

At the flight back I thought to myself what did i see in that room who wrote that note 
Who was this creature.

I asked myself was the mission to kill that thing?
Well I'm still not sure but what I am sure about is that I saw that creature down there smiling at me, laughing.
