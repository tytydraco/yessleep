I know this story has no ghosts, demons, goblins, or creatures from the Underworld stalking some poor fool. However, out of everything I have experienced in my short life, this is without a doubt one of the most twisted and terrifying things—because it was real… I lived it far too closely, closer than I ever could have imagined.

The final school year always carries a hint of nostalgia, as if every moment bears the weight of farewell. For us, however, it was more than nostalgia. It was fear. A fear that crept into our lives like an imperceptible shadow until it was too late.

We were four inseparable friends: Natalia, Camila, Julieta, and me. Always together, always sharing everything… or so we thought. Because Julieta, despite being the most outgoing, the most in love with love itself, harbored a secret that would freeze our blood when we discovered it.

Julieta had always had an almost obsessive fascination with love. She searched for it, longed for it, idealized it. That’s why it didn’t surprise us when she started dating Felipe, a guy four years older than her, whom she had known since childhood. They had reconnected in the town where her parents had grown up, and what began as a lifelong friendship turned into a long-distance romance. Felipe never met us in person, but he knew about us. Julieta talked about her group of friends, our outings, our laughter. And though he lived far away, his presence was unsettlingly felt.

At first, it was small things. Persistent questions about where she was, what time she got home, what she was wearing. Comments that seemed innocent but, in hindsight, had a dark edge—sharp as a blade that barely grazes the skin before sinking in slowly. Julieta never spoke much about her relationship with Felipe. We, on the other hand, shared our stories, our entanglements, our doubts. She listened with interest, smiled, gave her opinion… but she never truly told us anything deep about her own romance. It was as if she wanted to protect something. Or protect herself.

And then Cristian appeared.

Cristian wasn’t like the other boys at our school. He didn’t try to flirt with us, didn’t seek attention. He was simply our friend—one of us. Someone we could talk to about anything without fear of judgment. Over time, he became an essential part of our group. A brother. A confidant.

But to Felipe, Cristian was not just a friend. He was a threat.

The first time Julieta mentioned his name to Felipe, his expression changed. We didn’t see it, of course, but Julieta told us, with an uneasy look, as if trying to downplay it. She said Felipe had gotten a little upset, had asked her uncomfortable questions about Cristian, had told her to stop hanging out with him so much. At first, we dismissed it as a harmless bout of jealousy. But Felipe’s jealousy was not normal. It was something else. Something deeper. Something darker.

That was when we began to see Felipe’s true nature. And what we saw left us frozen.

It was an ordinary afternoon, leaving school with simple, routine plans—buying snacks, watching movies at Julieta’s house, laughing without worries. Cristian was coming with us. As we walked out the side gate of the school, Julieta received a video call. It was Felipe. She ignored it without hesitation.

“For security,” she shrugged. “I don’t want my phone stolen.”

Seconds later, her phone vibrated with a message. Julieta’s face changed instantly. Her lips, once curved in a smile, tightened into a rigid line. Her hands, which had been relaxed at her sides, now gripped the phone with force.

“Felipe… is mad.” Her voice was barely a whisper.

We peeked at the screen. The messages appeared in rapid succession, like desperate heartbeats:

**"Answer me."**  
**"Why did you hang up?"**  
**"Don’t ignore me."**  
**"No excuses. Pick up the video call."**

“Wait, what?” Camila frowned. “But you already told him why…”

Julieta didn’t answer. She just sighed, with the resignation of someone who knows they have no choice, and called him back.

Felipe’s smile appeared on the screen. His voice was soft, syrupy, like that of a perfect lover. He told Julieta how beautiful she looked, how much he loved her, how much he missed her. But his eyes did not smile.

We were standing right in front of Julieta, behind the phone. He couldn’t see us. But something unsettled him.

“Who are you talking to?” His tone shifted subtly.

“With the girls,” Julieta said, making a face.

“Show them to me.”

We looked at each other. The request was odd.

“Why?” Julieta sounded annoyed.

“Because I don’t believe you.”

The color drained from Julieta’s face. Felipe stared at her through the screen. The pressure was undeniable.

We nudged her gently so she would show us on camera, and in an awkward moment of forced introductions, we waved hello.

His response was immediate. And cruel.

“No, Julieta… what regular-looking friends you have. You’re definitely the most beautiful. You should be happy that I’ll never be interested in them. You’re my queen.”

The silence that followed was razor-sharp.

Julieta laughed nervously. Her cheeks flushed slightly. At that moment, none of us said anything. But the years would make us understand what had really happened. That phrase, disguised as a compliment, was just another chain in the cage that Felipe had built for her.

The call ended. Cristian, who had been pushed away to avoid problems, returned with a look full of doubt.

"Julieta will explain," I said, unwilling to be the one to unleash the storm.

We walked in silence to her house. We bought snacks at a nearby store, went up to her room, and settled in to watch a movie. But before pressing play, Julieta spoke. And what she told us… we would never forget.

Julieta told us that Felipe was very jealous, especially when they visited the town where her parents had grown up. Every time they went, he introduced her as if she were his greatest trophy, as if he had won a prize that everyone should admire. At first, Julieta felt good about it. He didn’t hide her, didn’t deny her, and demanded that his family respect her. But there was a condition: under no circumstances could she approach the men in the family. Not her brother, not her cousins, not even her own father. If she did, Felipe would lose his mind.

But they weren’t the problem, no. The insults and accusations were always directed at her. "You’re easy," he would say. "I bet you’ve already slept with half the town." Julieta didn’t know what to do in those moments. She just stayed quiet and cried silently. She thought that maybe the women in the family would defend her, but no. Although they comforted her, they also justified Felipe’s behavior. For them, it was normal, as if the entire family functioned that way.

The one who finally convinced Julieta to stay was Felipe’s mother. She told her that her son had changed since being with her. That he had left bad company, that he no longer got into trouble or wasted his life. That thanks to her, Felipe was a better person. Julieta felt she had a purpose, that she could help him. As if a teenager could fix a man older than her. So she decided to stay in the relationship. She learned to lower her gaze, to not talk too much, to not breathe too close to any other man. Only her own father could approach her. No one else.

One afternoon, after school, Julieta was in her room trying to solve a physics problem when Felipe called her. Laughing, she told him she was struggling with it more than usual. He joked: "Maybe the teacher wants you to pay more attention to him. Who knows, maybe he likes younger girls and, well, with how beautiful you are…". Julieta smiled. Felipe seemed to be in a good mood, so she decided to play along. But then everything changed.

Felipe exploded. "So you like being looked at, don’t you?" He accused her of wanting to seduce the teacher. Of playing with him. Of seeing him as a fool. "How many more are there? How many are you with?" Julieta, terrified, tried to explain that she had just followed the joke. But he wasn’t listening anymore. From that day on, every chance he got, he interrogated her about her relationships with her teachers.

Weeks later, Felipe showed up unexpectedly in the capital. Julieta was leaving school, walking home. As she walked, she received a call from Felipe. Not wanting another interrogation, she lied. "I’m home, my grandma sent me to buy something." In reality, she was still on her way.

Before entering her house, she saw her neighbor, Mr. Jaime. He was a kind man, the owner of a furniture restoration shop and a little puppy named Nucita. Julieta asked about the puppy, excited. Mr. Jaime smiled. "Let me bring her." That was when she felt an arm wrap around her throat. A cold, venomous whisper in her ear: "Very busy shopping, huh? Do you like lying to me?"

Julieta froze. She could barely breathe. Her mind tried to process what was happening, but her body didn’t react. Mr. Jaime came out with Nucita and stopped in his tracks. He nearly shouted at the sight. Felipe let go of his grip but didn’t release her. Instead, he grabbed her arm tightly and introduced himself with a tense smile. Julieta barely managed to say goodbye before he dragged her to her house. "You have to feed me, the trip was long," he said, as if nothing had happened.

But when they were alone in her room, Felipe exploded. He yelled, insulted her, cornered her. Julieta felt real panic. She was trapped. She couldn’t move. She couldn’t escape. But the worst part… the worst part was that she didn’t understand that she needed to run from him. To her, it was just his "personality." His mother had told her that he sometimes got angrier than he should, that it was his only flaw. Right.

Julieta finished telling us with her gaze lowered, her hands trembling, and her eyes glassy, trying to hold back tears that seemed to burn her skin. We surrounded her, whispering words of comfort, assuring her that everything would be okay. But among us, the only one who reacted with true indignation was Cristian.

"That’s not normal," he said, his brow furrowed and his voice full of restrained anger. "It’s not right for that guy to treat you like that."

Julieta lifted her gaze abruptly, glaring at him—not with anger, but with desperation.

"Felipe is not bad!" she protested, her voice breaking. "He’s just a little jealous… sometimes he likes to play rough jokes, but he doesn’t mean any harm. I love him."

Cristian clenched his fists, his breathing heavy, and for a moment, it looked like he was about to shout. He ran his hands through his hair, pulling it in frustration.

"You don’t understand, Julieta," he murmured, his tone so serious that even we felt a chill run through the room. "You’re trapped in that relationship, and you don’t even realize it."

I watched the scene in silence, feeling a weight in my chest. I didn’t know much about love, I had never had a boyfriend, but something about all of this made me feel uneasy, as if we were standing at the edge of an abyss and Julieta was clinging to the ledge with her fingernails, refusing to see the fall waiting for her.

Cristian, seeing that his words fell into an echoing void, sighed in exasperation. His gaze shifted from Julieta to us, as if searching for support, but none of us had the courage to confront Julieta at that moment. Finally, he took a deep breath and declared:

"I’m not going to stick around and watch that guy completely destroy you."

And he left.

Something in me reacted, and I followed him to the door, catching up before he disappeared into the night. I stood in front of him, searching for the right words, but he just looked at me with immense exhaustion in his eyes.

"Don’t leave her alone," he told me, with a seriousness that chilled my blood. "Support her, but don’t make her believe that love endures everything. Don’t justify this. Because this isn’t love."

His words remained in my mind like a persistent echo. After that night, Cristian began to distance himself. He didn’t ignore us, but there was something in his attitude that showed his patience had run out, especially with Julieta. She, for her part, stopped mentioning Felipe, perhaps because she still wanted Cristian’s friendship. It seemed like everything was calming down. But we were wrong.

One night, the WhatsApp group lit up with a message from Julieta.

"Felipe wants to kill himself."

The air seemed to thicken immediately. We all fell silent, paralyzed, horror creeping through our veins. We started bombarding her with questions, begging her to explain what had happened.

She answered us with a voice message, her breathing ragged. She told us that her grandmother had overheard her argument with Cristian and that, for the first time, someone in her family had told her what we and Cristian had been trying to say: she needed to stay away from Felipe. Her grandmother begged her to leave him before it was too late. At first, Julieta refused, but something inside her started to give in. Maybe, deep down, she already knew.

She distanced herself from Felipe little by little, ignoring his calls, responding less and less. But he wouldn’t accept it. He clung to her like a castaway to a piece of driftwood in the middle of the ocean. He constantly questioned her, blamed her for everything, told her that no one else would accept her, that she was a fool for wasting the chance to be with him. He humiliated her, insulted her, made her cry countless times. But she resisted.

Until one night, he called.

And she answered.

Felipe’s voice was calm, melancholic. He talked about his problems at home, how unhappy he was, how much he needed her. He swore he would change, that everything would be different if she gave him another chance. Julieta felt her heart tighten. She hesitated. But she wanted to be sure that he would really change. She told him everything that had hurt her—his jealousy, his mistreatment, the way he made her feel small. Felipe let out a bitter, lifeless laugh.

“I’m a mess,” he whispered. “An idiot. A monster. All I do is hurt people. I should just disappear.”

Julieta felt a lump in her throat.

“Don’t say that…”

“The world would be better without me,” he said, with a calmness that sent chills down her spine. “I can’t live without you, Julieta. I’m nothing without you. I’m at the town’s lookout. The night is cold, but the view is beautiful…”

Julieta stopped breathing.

“I love you,” Felipe whispered. “Forgive me.”

And he hung up.

Julieta felt the ground open beneath her feet. She trembled, tears falling uncontrollably. Desperate, she called Felipe’s mother, sobbing, pleading for help. But the woman’s response was a knife straight to her heart.

“This is your fault. If anything happens to my son, it’ll be because of you.”

And she hung up.

Not knowing what else to do, Julieta wrote to us.

The silence that followed her audio was dense, heavy. We stared at each other through the screen, though we couldn’t really see one another. We felt like statues, trapped in a moment that didn’t seem real. Cristian was the first to break the silence.

“Don’t do anything,” he said firmly. “Don’t respond, don’t look for him. This is manipulation. He will call you again.”

But Julieta was shattered. Consumed by guilt, anguish, terror. She felt like the worst person in the world. She felt like she had ruined Felipe’s life.

“What should I do?” she asked in a barely audible voice.

And the answer was not simple.

Julieta was desperate. She called Felipe over and over. His mother. No one answered. The silence became a monster that devoured our sense of calm. It was as if the world had stopped in a dark crevice where the worst was about to reveal itself. We, her friends, felt the sticky anxiety clinging to our skin, the helplessness of being on the other end of the phone, unable to do anything.

And then, in the early morning, the notification hit us like a gunshot to the head.

“Felipe was found.”

He had been unconscious, abandoned at the town’s lookout. A neighbor had found him, a limp, intoxicated body that looked more like a corpse than a person. Julieta told us about it with a shattered voice, sobbing, crushed by her own cries. She blamed herself. She was drowning in an ocean of guilt that Felipe himself had built around her—with every shout, every threat disguised as a plea, every hug that was more of a noose than a comfort.

And then she said the words that froze our blood.

“I have to go see him. I have to apologize.”

I expected Cristian to explode. To yell, to shake her with words full of reason. But his silence was a sharp knife that left us exposed. It was Natalia who spoke. Her voice was firm, restrained, but it carried the weight of a truth that could no longer be ignored.

“Don’t do this, Julieta. Don’t you see…? Don’t you see what he’s doing? He’s manipulating you. He’s pulling you into his cage. And if you go in this time, you won’t come out.”

Julieta didn’t answer. She couldn’t. Because deep down, she already knew.

Her body knew. Her instincts screamed at her to run. But love, that damned trap, kept her tied. That night, she didn’t write again. But silence wasn’t peace.

The next day, Julieta gathered us in the school’s green area, away from the others, her skin dull and dark circles like shadows under her eyes. She wasn’t the same Julieta. Something had changed. She looked at us. Swallowed hard. And told us what she had discovered.

She had spent the night without sleeping, searching through every corner of Felipe’s social media. She remembered the name of an ex-girlfriend, Samanta, a ghost mentioned by Felipe’s mother in a moment of carelessness, under her son’s warning gaze.

Julieta searched. Dug. Found her. And messaged her at around four in the morning. Of course, Samanta didn’t respond immediately. But that morning, Julieta saw the notification. A message that would change everything.

“Stay away from him before it’s too late.”

Julieta trembled. So did we.

Samanta told her the truth. Felipe’s real face. That he didn’t have female friends, only prey he sought to trap. That he wasn’t capable of being faithful or of loving without possessing. That his love was a prison and that, when she tried to escape, he marked her with his clenched fists.

“I didn’t react in time.”

“He convinced me it was my fault.”

“He promised he would change.”

“But he never did.”

Julieta read every word with a stomach full of thorns. She didn’t want to believe it.

“What if she’s lying?”

“What if Samanta still has feelings for him and just wants to keep me away?”

But then the fear came. That visceral feeling that everything fit together too well. That she, too, had felt that control. That she, too, had seen those terrifying mood swings, that suffocating love, those pleas that sounded more like threats.

“Felipe never left me alone.”

"Even now, he keeps looking for me. He calls me. He sends me messages from unknown numbers. He asks my family about me. He says he loves me. That I shouldn’t leave him alone."

"He can't stand it. He can't stand being left."

"He can't stand losing."

Julieta placed her phone on the table as if it burned her fingers. We were in shock. Felipe wasn't just a toxic boyfriend. Felipe was a predator.

"Tell me you understand what this means," I whispered, my throat tight with fear.

Julieta blinked. Swallowed hard. And broke into tears.

"I love him. But I’m also afraid of him. I want to keep him away, but I don't know how to get out of this."

Terror hit us like a wave. It was like watching her sink into quicksand, trapped between love and horror.

"Don't talk to him again. If you feel like you're going to, call us instead. We'll keep you company, we’ll stay with you, we'll do whatever it takes." I pleaded. I begged.

She nodded. But the fear never left her eyes. Days passed. Felipe didn’t reach out. Julieta avoided looking at her phone. She was doing it. But peace was an illusion.

That night, lying in bed, I couldn't sleep. There was something in the air. Something thick. Something pressing against my chest. And then I knew. Felipe hadn’t left. Felipe wasn’t going to let her go. Felipe was still there, lurking… and my body knew it. But I didn’t listen. None of us could have imagined what would happen next.
