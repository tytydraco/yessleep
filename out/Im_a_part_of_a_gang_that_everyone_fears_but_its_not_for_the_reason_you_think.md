So to give you some context I am a male in his late teens and if you were to ask one of my friends what I'm like they would probably tell you that I am not very talkative and mostly a chill guy but more importantly athletic, especially fast, I've also done martial arts which is relevant.

Now that's about all you'd find (hopefully) but if you just so happened to turn down a couple of sketchy streets deeper into town you would see a large abandoned square filled with peaople dressed in black. You might recognise me in that crowd since that's where a gang called "The crows" meets up, the name may sound stupid but it is actually very important so bare with me.

The gang is split into factions that are named using body parts of a crow, well kinda... The members of the largest group are called feathers since they serve a universal role in suporting every other group. They are also the weakest and their numbers can wary, the reason why I am saying strongest is bcecause in my country you can't find guns in every shop you go to and you have to be trained to have the right to own one, so the weapons we use are knives, baseball bats, axes(sometimes) and my personal favorite- brass knuckles. Now that may seem absurd and primitive, because it is. I didn't understand at first but I really enjoyed fighting but that slowly got me into more and more extreme situations and that led me to joining the crows.

The secong largest group is called teeth... 10 teeth which is interesting considering that there can never be less nor more and that crows don't have teeth. The same can be said about the wings(4 ppl) and the fangs(2 ppl). The leader is called the eye since there is only one... apparently. Now all this shit may seem wierd and stupid but if you were a part of it you would understand, that this is not by any means funny.

Every month we have what we call The trials, where new ppl get to join our gang if they can beat one of the current members. Usually new guys try to get a spot among the feathers since, well it's the easiest and if you win you get a spot, if you lose you can never try again, which are pretty fair rules in my opinion. However when you want to get a spot in any of the higher ranks or if you try to rank up it gets sketchy, almost like you are trying to join a cult or smth, let me explain.

I've been a part of this gang for 5 months now and I have only seen one person ever attempt to rank up and the moment he stated that he wanted to join the teeth, it got silent, like dead silent and everyone around him cleared a path for him to the front of the 10 teeth, who had their faces covered with masks. He was told to pick an opponent and after pointing at one of the teeth, almost like on queue we heard a crow call but it sounded more like a crackling whisper that sent a shiver down my spine. His opponent stepped forward, walked up to his face and then pop... the challenger's head just popped and his brains scattered on the ground. Only after a few seconds did my brain register what had happened, and I just stood there scared to move, I looked around only to see everyone else was in a kind of trance like state with  their pupils swollen and eyes wide open. So I waited and waited while they cleaned it up and went back to their original spots and everything else was the same

So while everyone else was convinced that the dude just lost in a fist fight, I couldn't think of anything else but that night. I also started to experience the same lucid nightmare over and over again. I was on a frozen lake with fog surrounding me and no matter where I went, I reached the exact same place- a shrine with a statue around the size of your average man with a dark cloak covering most of it and hands over it's face, leaving just a tiny gap between the middle and index fingers. At first I was freaked out abt all that was going on but I slowly started to enjoy the place since I could stay there for as long as I wanted, it was actually quite calming. When I wanted to leave or I suppose wake up all I had to do is try and peek through the gap between the fingers, which was something I figured out after, what was probably a few hours there. 

Fast forward to the next trial, nothing special happened until I got home and went to sleep. I was in that same place as before and after a few steps into the fog I found the shrine, only this time it was different It had four wings and was trying to fly away but there were chains holding it down so it could only float a few meters above the altar it was suppose to be standing on. The statues hand were on the side and I could see It's face, the most horrible face with one huge eye in the middle and a deformed mouth mimicing, what seemed like a smile that revealed It's pitch black teeth. This time the usually pale altar had something written on it in a language I didn't understand or at least I thought so, since the longer I stared at the text the more it started to look like the word ''sacrifice'' , at least in my language. At that moment I felt something grab me but it felt more like my soul was being ripped from my body and right as I thought I was dead I heard that horrible whisper from the trials that day "excuisite vessel" was what It said. 

After a few moments I felt something, I was cold like freezing cold and there was wind, I also heard cars and well crows lots and lost of crows, I was alive... I opened my eyes only to see a lamp shining in my eyes, I was lying on the street in a pile of snow, I immedietly got up and recognised where I was, I knew that street but it was almost 2 km from my house, "How tf did I get here?" I said out loud and right as I was about to leave I felt someone grab my shoulder from behind, not the "Hey buddy" kind of shoulder tap but it felt more like someone was trying to pull me through the ground so I instinctively slipped under his hand and threw probably the best uppercut I will ever land, after which he dropped to the ground. While checking to see if he was really out I noticed that there were around five other people, on the ground, ripped to shreds, like literally in pieces. After that I just ran until I got home, locked the doors, went into my room and just sat on my bed, staring at a wall, wondering wtf I just witnessed, until I heard the same voice, in my head this time "The crow requires sacrifice and you will deliver".
