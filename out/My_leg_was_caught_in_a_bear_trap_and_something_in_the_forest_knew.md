Every time I glanced at my leg, I'm haunted by memories. The pain was gone, as was most of the injury, but the scar was still there. It looked like something tried to bite my leg clean off, and that's usually the story I tell people when they ask. Fighting off an animal is a lot more believable than what actually happened.

The other boys in my cabin had decided to skip out on the campfire one night and investigate the forest. Much to my surprise, they invited me. Blinded by the idea of having friends, I didn't think twice about joining them.

I've come to regret that day ever since. Once the campfire started and we told the cabin counsellor that we were going to sleep, we set out to the forest. The leader of the group, a kid named Braden, took the lead and led us deeper and deeper into the woods.

Camp Nightingale had a rumour that there was a monster lurking within its woods. Of course, no one believed it. Or, at least, I thought they didn't. As I looked to my left, I noticed that Daniel, a kid with a body type more similar to mine, was wielding a slingshot. Any good that would do, I thought. "We're not actually going to find anything. You guys know that, right?" I asked, looking around the group of laughing and joking boys who were all sporting various amounts of weapons. They just laughed. 

"Probably not, but it would be awesome if we did." The kid said, cocking his slingshot at me and preparing to launch whatever he was aiming at. I flinched, instantly stopping my walk as the group chuckled. Still the butt of the joke, I thought. That's when I heard it. It was so synced with my footsteps that I almost missed it, but the moment I stopped, something behind me took another step before pausing. I froze, tilting my head around to see what it was.

Unfortunately, without Braden's flashlight, I had no luck in finding what it was. "Y-yo, can you shine your light on something behind me?" I stammered. Braden was confused but did so. I studied his expression, which turned into irritation. Aside from the hundreds of trees, there was nothing behind me.

"Stop being such a pussy. Like you said, we're not actually going to find anything." I rolled my eyes, jogging to catch up with them.

"Duh. I just thought it might be a bear." That caused an uproar in laughter.

"A bear? Out here? Man, you're dumb!" The third kid, Thomas, spoke.

For the next ten minutes, things went smoothly, and nothing happened. We had only been travelling in one direction, which Braden thought was good enough to act as our way back. "Also, I have this." He shook the smartphone in the air proudly, the Google Maps app open. It didn't make me feel all that much relieved, but I dropped it.

Once we reached the edge of the forest, I started getting the feeling that we were being watched yet again, and the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. Then something rustled in the bushes. This time, I wasn't the only one who heard it. Braden pointed at the bush, Daniel aimed his slingshot and Thomas pulled out a pocketknife I never knew he had. With nothing in my possession to fight back, I picked up a stick I found beneath me, pointing it at whatever was behind the bush.

I expected that after a tense moment, a rabbit would pop out as the cartoons would show. But that moment of silence never came. Something emerged from the shadows, lanky and covered in fur. Its shape was unlike any other animal I'd ever seen. In fact, I wasn't even sure it was an animal.

Its body was long, limbs gripping onto a tree, scurrying away the moment the light hit its face. But those few seconds gave me all the time I needed to make out the beast's features. It had a snout like a deer, yet it walked upright. Though fur coated its skin, I could tell that it was almost decaying, with black spots on its flesh. Its face was hideous, with black gums lining yellow teeth. Instantly, all of us let out a shriek and dashed in the opposite direction.

I was able to keep up with them for the first thirty yards, but they were all much more athletically built than me and I soon fell behind. As I tried to shout, my lungs burned, muffling my voice. I felt like I was coughing up blood. Soon, the light projected by the flashlight diminished behind the ever-growing sea of trees.

I sucked in the air, trying to call out for one last time. But before I got the chance, I collided with a tree and I lost consciousness.

The first hint of daylight crept through the treetops, and the birds welcomed the dawn with their songs. My bones ached from having slept on the uneven ground but, despite it all, my eyes had finally opened. Memories of the encounter drove me to jump to my feet, no matter how dizzy that made me. I looked around, searching the surrounding area for both anyone from the camp and the thing I saw earlier.

But there was no sign of either. However, there remained another problem; I didn't know how I was going to get back. After being unconscious for quite some time, I forgot which way I was running to. I swallowed back fear, realizing that the monster I saw could still be lurking in the forest.

With nothing else to do, I began walking, my legs feeling like lead. That was when I took a step, landing on what felt like hard metal. I barely had the opportunity to look down before the jaws of a beartrap clamped down, coming close to severing my right foot. Cartoonishly triangular blades dug into my skin, one completely piercing through my bone.

It took everything I had to not pass out right then and there. I tried to let out a scream, but my throat choked up and all I could manage was a dry rasp. As I fell to the ground, the bear trap flipped with me. My first thought was to open it. However, it wasn't like what I'd see in the moviesâ€”it was bolted shut, with several parts and components that I couldn't dream of ever figuring out. Once I realized I wasn't going to open it, my heart rate spiked and I began yelling.

My frail voice barely left my throat, sobs overtaking the words. A deafening silence surrounded me. I kept calling out for help with no response, and I must've lost a lot of blood because I got light-headed. I tried to keep moving, but I could barely lift my arms, forcing me to stop.

I know that it was probably my paranoia getting to me, but it seemed that there was always something in my peripherals, only making an effort to move when I wasn't looking. It got so bad that after a few hours, I considered ripping my leg off. Of course, when I so much as touched it, an excruciating pain shot through my entire body.

After letting go, I lay on the hard ground, just beginning to drift to sleep, hoping that someone would come back for me. That's when I heard branches cracking. My eyes immediately shot open, the idea of sleeping suddenly becoming foreign to me. My body jumped to life, frantically searching my surroundings to see where the noise came from.

Noticing the rock beside me, I picked it up before immediately looking back up. How I wish I hadn't. There was something there. Two, large white orbs floated in the air about eight or nine feet away. They were far too big to belong to a small critter, and it was positioned at least seven feet tall, giving them considerable size. The creature's body was long, with thin legs supporting a frail torso that looked like it was made of sticks. Its body was covered in matted fur, except for its head. Its jaw was unhinged, open and revealing rows of teeth. However, what was interesting was that the teeth weren't all that sharp.

In fact, it didn't seem like any part of the creature could be of any trouble; its body was way too skinny for it to actually attack. It was more like a sickly animal, with no strength to speak of.

As I waited to see what it was going to do, wondering if it was trying to hurt me, I began to realize something. It wasn't trying to attack me. Instead, it simply watched, wide unblinking eyes not taking the slightest interest in anything around me. I glared back as if it was the only thing I could do. Though the sun began to shine, it remained motionless.

At night, the creature looked terrifying, but in the sunlight where I could make out every detail, even more so. Clutching the rock, I throw it as hard as I can. It hit the creature in the shoulder, but aside from awkwardly shuffling back, it didn't seem to notice it. 

Dehydration had begun to set in, and I was feeling dizzy. As the creature watched, it reminded me of something. The way it watched its prey die before I could only assume it eats me, reminded me of vultures. It's funny. As I was asking myself if dehydration or hunger would kill me first, the creature was thinking the same exact question.

As my vision slowly began to blur, I noticed that it was slowly getting closer. When my eyes would close for a moment, I'd open them and its head would only be an inch away from mine, causing me to jump. The creature would do the same, bolting behind the safety of a tree. But as this act of ours repeated for several times, the creature would be less afraid each time, until, eventually, it would no longer move.

I wave my arms violently, but still no response. My stamina was running low and there was no sign of anyone else coming for me. The more exhausted I got, the more I wanted to give in to the idea of dying. The pain in my right leg was becoming unbearable and, at this point, death was a preferable outcome to continuing. In the very bottom of the pit of despair, I lay there, limp and completely spent, not moving another muscle.

Despite the fact the creature was glaring down at me, I couldn't care anymore. My eyelids began to grow heavy, my consciousness growing cloudier by the second. But just before I could be taken away, a voice rang out. "Oh my god, oh my god!" It was loud, startling me awake.

I looked toward the source of the noise and found that it was Braden and his friends, along with the camp's staff. They all rushed in. The creature, jolting its head up to face them, scurried off before everyone else could even get to me.

The next couple of minutes passed by in a blur. The camp staff managed to free my leg from the bear trap. I was sent to the infirmary for treatment, then released with instructions to remain on crutches for the rest of the month. When I asked them about the creature, they said they thought it was just a bear, but couldn't tell for sure. Maybe I was just imagining the whole thing. All that mattered was that I survived. However, lingers of the despair I felt from that day never left. For some reason, I can't shake the memory of that creature from my mind, and the fear it induced within me.
