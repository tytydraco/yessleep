My dreams had been plaguing me, what was real, what wasn’t? I’d wake up with blurred memories. One day, I wasn’t me anymore. The neurons in my brain rewired into some kind of mechanical blood and bone machine. Fearless of death. Playing with it. Jabbing my jagged long fingernails into the organs of this strange human. Mangling its body. I just wanted to know what it felt like, and though it was nobody, something in me knew it was mine. Rushed with endorphins the fear kicks in, where do I leave this body? It’s too heavy, everytime I pick it up it falls over and the splatter of its guts and brain matter keep slamming the ground making this squelching noise. And I keep having to shove the dangling intestines back into the orifice. I don’t know why I tried hiding it under the bed, but I needed to lay down for a second and close my eyes.. and breathe.. think.. 

I heard a knock at my door and saw the knob turn; it was my brother. My head was pounding, I jumped up and quickly remembered the strange human I had killed. I could taste my heart in my throat, my brother let himself in, as he always does. I turned towards the bed and sighed a wave of relief, for some reason the body of that strange person wasn’t there. Am I dreaming still? It felt so real. I can still feel the gooey insides on my fingertips. My brother is all I have left, our parents died years ago. Ever since then I’ve just been rotting away in my apartment, as if I’m on auto pilot. He checks up on me, but it really should be me checking up on him. He never says anything anymore, just comes in occasionally, gives me a smile, then leaves. As the days went by the feeling of the flesh never left. I’d drive myself crazy trying to figure out if it was real or not, so I just started going about my days. They started to mesh, Monday again, what month? I forget the year too. How did I get to work? I don’t remember how I learned how to drive, or how I got this job in the first place. Do I even exist, or am I just flesh and bone idling by unknowingly? Nobody witnesses me, nobody besides my brother. He was there that day. Nobody acknowledges me at work, or on the street, my phone doesn’t even ring. I know I’ve pushed most people away, but I can’t help but wonder if I ceased to exist that very day. 

I woke up on Monday, October 32nd. Before I could even get out of bed I noticed a putrid smell emanating from under me. Horrified by what I might see, I reached my arm down the side of the bed and slid my fingertips on the floorboard. A slimy, fleshy goo, sticky too. I would’ve shuddered in fear, but the endorphins took over me and I began smashing the corpse gunk with my fingers, like a child smushing bugs. A knock at the door shook me out of my daze and I jumped up. The knob didn’t turn. It wasn’t my brother. I turned around and the body was still there, lying right under the bed which faced directly to the front door. The smell was rancid, almost as if you could see the stench stagnant in the air. Flies and maggots were scattered around the corpse. The knocking got louder. “Hello, is anyone there?” I froze in horror. Maybe I’m dreaming right now? I held my breath and waited for the footsteps at the front door to disappear. Did I really kill this strange human? The fear is kicking in again, as if everyone can see me. The whole world knows what I’ve done, and soon they’ll be coming for me. I needed to lay down again.. to breathe.. think.. breathe.. think.. 

I must’ve fallen asleep all day, because I woke up and it was dark outside. I checked my phone, no service. The streets outside my window looked empty, not a car in sight. Before I could recollect my thoughts, I noticed the body was gone, like it never happened. 
My front door swung open, it was my brother again. “Not even a knock?” He didn’t respond nor smile, just stared at me with contempt this time. Does he know? His silence stabbed deeper than any words. He didn’t move; I called out to him again but before I could finish he walked out the door. 
I should’ve been relieved, but his departure only left me feeling hollow while the rotting corpse smell began to engulf me again. 

I check my phone, no signal, no messages, the date hasn’t changed. October 32nd. When was the last time I’ve seen anyone? Anyone but my brother and this strange corpse. I hesitate this time, but check under the bed again. A hand.. familiar.. my hand. A lung... my lung. A brain… my.. brain. I haven’t just lost my mind.. I think I’m looking right at it. I hear a sound behind me, a cry. I know that cry. I turn around and see my brother, but this time he doesn’t look the same. His neck is limp, bruised dangling to the side ready to snap off, he has that same look of contempt. I finally hear his voice after what had felt like ages… “Look what you’ve done.” The rope still dangling on his neck. Lost in my own mind, I buried the ones I loved with me. He pointed toward the floor, right under the bed. I tried to blink it away.. breathe.. think.. breathe.. think.. but there was no sleeping this off.. it was etched into the floorboards for eternity. Not just one body. Two. Bloated. Blue.
