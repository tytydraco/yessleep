I’ve always had this weird habit of staring at myself in the mirror late at night. It sounds strange, I know, but it’s almost comforting, like reminding myself that I’m real, that I’m *me*. I live alone in a small apartment, so it’s quiet, and sometimes it helps me settle down after a long day. The mirror is one of those big, old-fashioned ones, a leftover from the previous tenant. It’s cracked on the edges, but it has this charm to it that made me keep it.

Last night, around 3 AM, I was standing in front of the bathroom mirror, just zoning out after a sleepless night. I was exhausted, and my eyes looked dead tired, but I couldn’t pull myself away. I must have been standing there for a good five minutes, just staring at my own face, when I noticed something off.

My reflection blinked. But I didn’t.

I felt a cold chill run down my spine. I thought I was just tired, that maybe I had imagined it. I mean, it was late, and I hadn’t been sleeping well for weeks. I blinked a few times and shook my head, trying to clear the fog out of my mind. But then it happened again.

My reflection blinked. And this time, it smiled.

It wasn’t a normal smile. It was slow, almost like it was testing it out, stretching my lips in a way that felt… wrong. It was the kind of smile you’d see on someone who knows a secret, and not a good one.

I took a step back, my heart racing. I couldn’t look away, though. It felt like my feet were glued to the floor. I watched as my reflection stayed where it was, still smiling, its eyes locked onto mine. It leaned in closer, closer than I was standing, almost like it was trying to push through the glass.

Then it whispered something. I couldn’t hear it clearly at first, but it was like it was speaking inside my head, a soft voice, barely audible. “You’ve been watching me for a long time,” it said. “Now it’s my turn.”

I stumbled back, nearly falling over the edge of the bathtub. I slammed the bathroom door shut and stood there in the hallway, trying to catch my breath. My heart was pounding so hard I could barely hear anything else, but then I heard it. The sound of glass cracking, a soft, splintering noise that sent another wave of panic through me.

I don’t know why, but I pressed my ear against the door. I held my breath, listening, and I heard it. My own voice, whispering through the crack in the door. “Don’t leave me here.”

I ran to my bedroom and grabbed my phone, hands shaking so badly I could barely unlock it. I called my best friend, Sarah. It was 3 AM, and I knew she’d be pissed, but I didn’t care. I needed to hear another human voice.

“Hello?” she answered, her voice groggy and annoyed.

“Sarah, I need you to stay on the phone with me,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “Something’s wrong.”

“What’s going on?” she asked, suddenly sounding more awake. “Are you okay?”

I glanced down the hallway, half-expecting to see the bathroom door slowly creaking open, but it stayed closed. I took a deep breath and told her everything. The blinking, the smile, the voice. I could hear her breathing on the other end, and I could tell she was trying to come up with a rational explanation.

“You’re just tired,” she said eventually. “It’s probably sleep paralysis or something. You said you haven’t been sleeping well, right?”

I wanted to believe her, I really did. But then I heard the sound again. The mirror. It was cracking. The noise was louder this time, like something was pushing against it from the other side. I heard my own voice again, clearer now, more insistent: “Let me out.”

“I need to get out of here,” I whispered, grabbing my keys.

“Wait, what are you doing?” Sarah sounded panicked now. “Where are you going?”

“I’m leaving,” I said. “I can’t stay here.”

I ran out of the apartment without another word, slamming the door behind me. I didn’t stop running until I was outside, standing on the sidewalk, gasping for air. I looked up at my window, half-expecting to see something staring back at me, but it was dark.

I stayed with Sarah that night. I haven’t been back to the apartment yet. I know I have to go back eventually, but I’m terrified. I covered every mirror in the place before I left. I don’t think I can look in one again.

And the worst part? When I got up this morning, there was a crack in the mirror in Sarah’s guest room, and a single word was written on the glass:

“Soon.”

**(Lily):** I don’t know what to do. If anyone has experienced something similar, please tell me what happened. I feel like it’s watching me, even now.
