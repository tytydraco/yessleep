I live alone in a small, quiet town in Northern Luzon Philippines, tucked between rice fields and forgotten hills. Nothing ever happens here, except whispers—old folktales, strange dreams, and that name they told us never to speak.

Mirasol.

Not in daylight. Not in prayer. And never at 3:33 AM.

I thought it was just local superstition. Until last week.

It started when I was researching folklore for a horror script I’m writing. I asked an old woman at the palengke (wet market) if she knew any “real” curses from around here. She dropped her fish basket and spat at my feet. All she said was:

“Pag binanggit mo 'yan, wag mong isusulat.”
(If you say her name, don’t ever write it down.)



That night, I wrote her name anyway. I even whispered it.

I said “Mirasol” at 3:33 AM.
Out loud.
Like a goddamn idiot.

And now—I haven’t slept for six days.


The first night, I heard breathing in my kitchen.

Not footsteps.
Not creaking.
Just… breathing.

Wheezing. Heavy. Like someone was waiting.

I locked my bedroom door. Told myself it was a dream. But when I woke up, my mirrors had foggy handprints on them.

All the mirrors. Even the one inside my cabinet.

On the second night, I saw her. Just for a second.

She was standing in the reflection of my TV while it was turned off. A tall woman with no eyes. No lips. Just torn, wet skin stretched over her teeth. And her head twitched—like it was caught on a loop.

She mouthed something.

“Balik ka, balik ka, balik ka—”
(“Come back, come back, come back—”)

I didn’t understand. Back where?


I tried sleeping during the day, but she followed.

At 1:37 PM, I heard a knock from inside my closet. Not from the door. From the back of it.

I opened it, and the lightbulb flickered once—then I saw a single sunflower petal fall from the shelf.

Mirasol means sunflower.

That was when I remembered the curse’s full line, the one carved into an old stone behind the chapel ruins. It wasn’t in any dialect I recognized, but I tried to Google it.

Roughly translated:

“The one who names her at the hour of broken sleep shall be named in turn. The one who writes her name shall give her shape. The one who sees her shall never see peace.”




The third night, she stood in the corner of my room.

Not moving.
Not breathing.
But I swear my walls were pulsing behind her.

At exactly 3:33 AM, my phone lit up by itself and displayed a draft message—something I never typed. It just said:

“You are now Mirasol.”



I tried deleting it. My phone cracked in half.


Tonight is my last night, I think.

She spoke to me clearly an hour ago, right behind my ear.

Her voice sounds like a choir of people drowning.

She said:

“Write my name where others may see. Share me. Feed me. Or stay and rot in this body forever.”



I don’t know if this will reach anyone. I’m sending it because I have to. Because she doesn’t leave until someone else says it. Because if you read her name—if you say it in your head right now—you’re part of this.

And if it’s 3:33 AM when you’re reading this…

You should stop.

You should pray.

You should never say her name out loud.

Because that’s how she gets out.

That’s how you become her next home.
