[Part 5.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1gfe1rx/the_unexplored_trench_part_5/)

  
The explosions erupted above, tearing through the water with a violence that defied belief. We could see the ripple of light, feel the shockwaves in the water. But the Abyssal Behemoth held us firmly, shielding us from the worst of the assault. 

The silence stretched, and finally, after what felt like hours, the Abyssal Behemoth loosened its grip, releasing us from its mouth. Our submersible drifted downward, the lights flickering faintly, the metallic groans of the hull a haunting reminder of how close we had come to being its prey. Slowly, it nudged us upward, pushing us out of its domain, as though sparing us… for now. 

The moment we surfaced, ANEX operatives were on us. Their faces were masked with indifference, moving with the well-oiled efficiency of a machine that felt nothing and remembered everything. It felt like being arrested rather than retrieved. We were shuffled into a nondescript, steel-gray ANEX vessel anchored nearby, where one of their agents intercepted me in the hallway. “Debrief in ten minutes,” they said, their eyes barely meeting mine before they moved on.  

The harsh lights and clinical scent reminded me more of a lab than a briefing room. We were on edge, silently fuming. I could feel Dr. Miles’s anger rolling off him like static. His jaw clenched so tight it could’ve shattered teeth, his hand in a white-knuckled fist that had been twitching since we surfaced. Tension radiated through the whole team. I kept my own expression neutral, fingers brushing the sliver of tissue tucked in my jacket’s inner pocket. 

The specimen was small, hardly more than a translucent scrap, but it pulsed with some kind of energy I couldn’t identify. I had seen it, stuck to a part of the submersible and I’d managed to secure it without the ANEX operatives noticing. A piece of the abyss, nestled secretly against my chest. 

We filed into the room where Colonel Gaines waited, his presence as cold and immovable as iron. He didn’t flinch at our entrance, nor at the scorching glare Miles leveled at him as he approached. But Gaines must’ve known it was coming; before we even had the chance to sit down, Miles lunged forward, his fist connecting with the colonel’s jaw in one swift, angry motion. 

"How dare you use us as bait?" Miles spat, voice barely restrained. "We weren’t supposed to be here to get eaten or blown to bits!" 

The guards rushed forward, but Gaines waved them off, lifting himself slowly with a calculated sigh. A bruise darkened his jaw, but he didn’t appear fazed. His stare was unnervingly calm, scanning each of us with chilling efficiency. 

“Are you finished?” His voice was low, threatening in its stillness. “You are here because you are needed. This isn’t about your lives; it’s about something much bigger. The Behemoth you encountered represents a threat so vast you couldn’t possibly understand it yet. ANEX has dedicated resources, lives, and unimaginable technology to contain entities like this—entities that would annihilate our world without a second thought.” 

He leaned forward, letting his words sink in. "You’re scientists, and I don’t expect you to trust ANEX. But your work is critical to our understanding of these anomalies and how to contain them. And yes, the sponsors funding your expedition are heavily involved with us. They believe in protecting the human race, whether you agree with their methods or not.” 

It took everything I had not to argue back, but I swallowed my anger for now, knowing I still had that piece of tissue tucked safely away. After all, it could be the key to understanding this thing we’d barely survived. 

The days since our return to the surface felt like a fever dream, every moment heavy with an inexplicable tension. None of us spoke much; our words seemed brittle under the weight of the reality we’d come face-to-face with below. Emily threw herself into her data, combing through notes and readings as if they held the answers. Dr. Miles, meanwhile, could barely contain his anger, the veins at his temples constantly throbbing, his fists clenched with fury. 

It was worse at night. The steady hum of machinery aboard the ANEX vessel was our only company, reminding us that we were now part of something monstrous, something far beyond us. Each of us struggled to make sense of why we had been pulled back down again, why ANEX insisted on putting us in the path of a creature they couldn’t begin to understand. Gaines’s assurances that we were "needed" felt like hollow echoes. What need could we serve to an entity as vast and incomprehensible as the Abyssal Behemoth? 

I hadn’t told the others about the tissue sample. Each night, I inspected it in secret, my heart hammering as I tried to unravel its mysteries. It wasn’t just tissue. It was something… anomalous, something that seemed to absorb light and energy, feeding off the air like a living, breathing wound. The more I studied it, the more certain I became that this creature wasn’t from our world. It was a shard of something that defied every boundary we knew. 

The orders to descend again came swiftly. No explanation, no briefing—just the hard, unsympathetic directive from Colonel Gaines. This time, though, something gnawed at the edges of my mind as we prepared for the dive. It wasn’t fear, not exactly; it was something much colder. A sense of inevitability. 

Emily took the controls again, her hands shaking as she powered up the submersible. The flickering light illuminated our faces in harsh relief, each of us cast in shadow. We avoided each other’s eyes, each lost in our own battle with the dread that coiled around us like an invisible snake. 

We began our descent, plunging once more into the cold, dark depths. The light faded rapidly, swallowed by the weight of the ocean. Outside, shadowy figures drifted past—fish and jellies, barely discernible forms moving sluggishly in the void. The deep felt different this time, somehow thicker, as though the very water was aware of us, pressing in on all sides. 

The sensors picked up faint energy readings, much like before, but they were erratic, pulsing in strange, rhythmic patterns. There was an electricity in the air—or what passed for air down here—a crackling sense of something lurking just beyond our senses. I felt a tingling along my skin, the hairs on the back of my neck standing up. Something was waiting for us. 

We approached the ocean floor, the beams from our floodlights illuminating patches of sand and skeletal remains scattered across the abyss. Shadows of old wreckage rose up around us, their jagged edges like teeth in the dark. The scene was eerily silent, devoid of movement. 

And then we saw them: the eyes. 

Two colossal orbs, glowing faintly in the darkness, hovering at the edge of our light’s reach. They were the Abyssal Behemoth’s eyes, but this time they weren’t merely watching. They pulsed with an intensity I hadn’t seen before, flickering with a light that seemed alive. As we drifted closer, I saw within them strange cosmic vistas—a swirl of galaxies, black holes collapsing in on themselves, supernovae exploding in distant parts of the universe. These weren’t just eyes. They were windows to other dimensions, other realms. And in that light, I saw something I hadn’t before: fear. 

Emily gasped, her grip on the controls faltering. “Dr. Ellison… do you see that?” 

I nodded, unable to look away. The Behemoth’s eyes were alive with an alien fury, a rage that seemed to shake the very water around us. But underneath that rage, there was something else—a primal, instinctual dread. It wasn’t looking at us; it was looking beyond us, past us, into a darkness that even it seemed to fear. 

As we turned to face where the behemoth was looking, we saw a cold light ahead of us growing larger and more defined, spreading like a blight against the endless dark. It was as if the ocean itself recoiled from the approaching presence, its light casting eerie shadows that distorted reality, as though rejecting the very concept of solidity. The thing that emerged wasn’t like the Behemoth. It wasn’t alive in the way we understood. It was a grotesque, shifting form, more a wound in the fabric of existence than a creature. Its edges bled into the water around it, warping space with strange, jagged limbs that seemed to phase in and out of sight. 

The entity’s surface was a sickly, translucent membrane, riddled with pulsating black veins that seethed beneath its skin, pumping some viscous liquid that bubbled and frothed. Each pulse of those veins was like a heartbeat, slow and irregular, reminding us of something that shouldn’t be. And within that translucent form, shifting shadows swirled, giving fleeting glimpses of eyes—thousands of them, each blinking in unison before vanishing into the murk of its body. It was like staring into an infinite pit of suffering, a glimpse of something so ancient and unfeeling that it defied even the concept of empathy. 

It drifted toward the Behemoth with an unnatural grace, extending one of its warped limbs, which seemed to bend in multiple dimensions, folding back on itself as if it were breaking through space. The limb itself writhed, covered in countless tiny tendrils tipped with glistening barbs. These barbs flashed in and out of existence, their unnatural glow sending icy shivers down our spines. The closer it came, the more the air in the sub felt thick and heavy, as if we were being pulled into some dreadful, inescapable current. This thing was not of our world. It was a cosmic horror that had somehow found its way into our reality. 

The Abyssal Behemoth braced itself, curling its massive form protectively, almost as though shielding us from this monstrosity. Its colossal eyes fixed on the intruder, and we saw the galaxies within them churning with raw, chaotic energy—supernovas exploding, stars collapsing into singularities, all in the span of seconds. In those eyes was a fury that transcended mortal anger, a cosmic wrath that only a guardian of the ancient oceans could embody. The Behemoth wasn’t just preparing to fight; it was preparing to annihilate. 

Then, with a silent roar that seemed to vibrate through the very fabric of the water, the Behemoth launched itself at the entity, the entire ocean seeming to recoil from the impact. The water around us buckled as a shockwave rippled outward, rattling the submersible. The two beings collided with a force so powerful it was as if the sea itself had torn open, each releasing energy that ignited the water in bursts of bioluminescent colors. 

The entity responded with a scream—a soundless, mind-piercing wail that drilled into our skulls, sending waves of nausea and terror through us. The sickly light it emitted flared as it lashed out with a limb, striking the Behemoth’s side. Where it touched, the Behemoth’s skin blistered and blackened, the wound bubbling as though corroded by the entity’s very essence. It was a creature of entropy, a force that sought to consume and unravel all it encountered. 

But the Behemoth fought back with equal ferocity. It swung its colossal tail, the galaxies in its eyes blazing brighter as it channeled an otherworldly energy, ripping through the entity’s translucent form. A deep, guttural sound echoed through the water as the entity recoiled, splitting apart at the site of the strike. For a moment, it seemed almost to vanish, retreating into the darkness, only for its scattered pieces to reform, each chunk crawling back to the core in sick, writhing motions. The horror was relentless—it would not retreat. 

More of the entity’s limbs flailed toward the Behemoth, each movement unpredictable, each strike an attempt to pierce, bind, or corrupt the creature that stood against it. The Behemoth’s massive body twisted and undulated, dodging most of the strikes, though each glancing blow left dark, festering marks. This wasn’t just a battle; it was a cosmic clash of wills, a confrontation of fundamental forces. One, the Abyssal Behemoth, was a sentinel, a protector tied to our world’s deepest waters. The other, an interloper from realms of darkness that sought to consume, corrupt, and eradicate. 

Then came a moment of stillness. The entity’s limbs retracted, the eyes within it blinking in unison, focusing all at once on the Behemoth. The Behemoth’s eyes narrowed, the galaxies within them swirling faster, reaching a blinding brightness. It let out a rumble that seemed almost like a warning. The entity’s limbs pulsed, splitting into smaller, thread-like tendrils, each moving independently, preparing for a final strike. 

The entity surged forward in one swift motion, its tendrils fanning out to form a maw—a void of darkness so complete that it seemed to devour even the faint light of the deep. It lunged, trying to engulf the Behemoth, its form stretching like an endless, writhing black hole. But just as it closed in, the Behemoth’s eyes flared, a supernova blazing within each. With a roar that shook the ocean floor, the Behemoth thrust its massive body upward, its colossal jaws snapping shut around the heart of the entity. 

There was a blinding flash, a detonation of light that sent us reeling back in the sub, shielding our eyes. When we looked again, the entity’s form had begun to dissolve, its limbs flailing in the water, disintegrating into wisps of dark, toxic smoke. The Behemoth held firm, its jaws clamped down on the heart of the creature, crushing it with a slow, determined finality. Its eyes blazed as it consumed the last vestiges of the intruder, devouring the darkness in a display of raw, primal power. 

The remnants of the entity faded, its sickly glow dimming until only darkness remained. The Behemoth lingered for a moment, its gaze turning to us. We were frozen, caught between awe and terror, our hearts pounding as we realized we had just witnessed a battle that transcended our understanding—a clash not of monsters but of forces beyond the realm of human comprehension. 

In that gaze, we saw galaxies settle, stars cooling as the chaos within the Behemoth’s eyes calmed. It had defended the oceans, preserved its vigil over the abyss, but there was a tiredness in its gaze—a weariness that came from eons of this cosmic guardianship. Then, with a slow, almost reluctant movement, the Behemoth drifted back into the shadows, its colossal form vanishing into the depths, leaving us suspended in a silence that felt as vast and eternal as the void. 

And in that silence, a single thought echoed in our minds, cold and unyielding: there were horrors in this world, and beyond it, that were never meant to be seen by human eyes.
