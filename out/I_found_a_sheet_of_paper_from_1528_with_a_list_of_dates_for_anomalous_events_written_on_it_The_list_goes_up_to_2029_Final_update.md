[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13a1q7t/i_found_a_sheet_of_paper_from_1528_with_a_list_of/?)


I not sure why any of it happened. It just... did. Out of nowhere. Hopefully this is the last update.


I was hiding, stopping myself from breathing loudly as the sound of footsteps got louder and louder. My other self was covering her face as she lyed to my left. I had a view of the bottom of the bedroom door through the crack between the blanket hanging off the bed and the soft carpet floor. The door was knocked right off its hinges, filling my guts with more dread.


"You two can come out now," said a feminine voice. "I'm not one of those cultists, I promise."


I exchanged looks with my other self. I didn't want to move. I wasn't just going to trust some random person. How did they get into the house when we couldn't? If the answer was advanced weaponry, that still ticked me off considering I hadn't heard of a rescue team on par with the cultists. And if it was a rescue team, they should give at least one sign.


The blanket was lifted up, which was something I should've expected. A woman with black hair who looked to be in her late 20s looked where we were, her eyes widening as she noticed us. My eyes widened as well, my heart dropping as she looked at me.


"You two can come out now," she said. "I got rid of the occultists. Well, all but one of them."


She took out a badge, covering her name with her fingers, but she had a government badge. I crawled out from under the bed and stood up. My other self followed suit.


"How'd you get in here?" I asked.


"Knocking, portals," she said.


"Portals?" I asked. "Do you know anything about a sphere of monstrosity that had risen inside the library?"


"Oh, yeah, it's still here," she said. "It's my next target. Oh, hold on a second. I'll be back shortly."


The agent took out a white handheld device and pressed one of the buttons kn it. A white light popped up and expanded until a person could fit inside. The agent stepped into it, then it disappeared.


"Woah," I said, looking at my other self, who had a look of amazement on her face."


"Yeah, that was interesting," she said.


A moan echoed from downstairs, sending chills down my spine. Was that a… cultist? My other self was pale already.


"Maybe it was an officer," she said.


"Yeah, that's what I'd do," I said, almost smiling. "Why not assume the best if you can't tell if something is signaling anything bad or good."


A silence fell between us as I heard the sound of a gun being cocked. We both got back under the bed and my other self covered herself in clothing. I did the same.


Their footsteps got louder and louder. It's possible this person heard us talking in here. If so, he probably heard exactly where our voices were coming from. I remained as quiet as possible just in case this person was a cultist. I saw some shoes along the floor. They stopped, and a loud gunshot made my other self and I scream. The bedsheet was lifted, and a pale faced man looked under the bed. He had a jellyfish tattoo on his face.


He let the bedsheet go, then I watched on, adrenaline rising, as he walked over to my side of the bed. He lifted the bedsheet, and I saw his silhouette. It was somehow freakier than his actual face.


"Get out," he said. "We're going now."


I was frozen. I bet my other self was as well. She's me after all, and through all of this, I only barely got to be light about it.


The man pulled away each of the clothes that were covering me, grabbed my arm, and tugged me out from under the bed.


"No!" I screamed.


The man pushed me onto the bed. He took out an older looking phone and showed me videos that will probably stick with me.


The first video began with the camera operator filming the Statue of Liberty up close. They zoomed out, revealing a red UFO or something hovering above the bay, taking up most of the sky. It had a dozen pulsating bumps hanging off of it. The camera operator zoomed out further, revealing this living UFO had a black trim and was shaped like a triangle. It looked far from CGI or an AI generated video. The video looked impossible to fake. The living UFO began to move eastward, sending chills down my spine.


The second video showed a group of eight people in grey robes sitting around a table, talking and laughing. It looked like they were in the CN Tower observation deck. I could see what looked to be the shoreline, but with different buildings lining the shoreline. At one point, one of the robed men stood up. The others went silent, then the robed man spoke.


"Tonight, we celebrate the fifth year of notes' presence," he said. "Anybody who opposes us will be subject to the following. I love this list. Electric poking, beating, forced teaching…"


It was a surreal video. The cult-ishness of the group gave me goosebumps. As he kept listing the punishments, I realized more so that I shouldn't type them…


Another thing was the mention of Notes. I had heard it before. I recalled reading about a creature named Nnotz before entering the bedroom in the first place, along with a woman named Arilyn Campbell from an alternate reality. Were these videos from her reality? Was this man a member of that cult?


The third video showed a rear end view of a truck speeding up a road at night. I focused on the rear headlights as they illuminated the road. As I did so, a dark creature… it almost looked like a tree, but it was also very animalistic in appearance… and it was sprinting, following behind the truck. I looked away, but the man told me to keep watching. Man, that thing was chilling to see.


The video ended, then the man slid his phone back into his pocket while asking me a very troubling question.


"Are you ready for all of that?"


"W-what even is that stuff?" I asked.


I didn't want to be dragged into whatever hell hole I just saw. Is that really where these cultists want to take my other self and I? The dread continued to pile up inside me. I felt there was no way out of this. I began to tear up as the weight of this situation continued to get heavier.


The man gave me a devious smirk.


"Why did you need me specifically?" I sobbed.


"We were able to stick a tracking chip in your neck," he said. "I bet the soreness wore off by now."


That answers the neck question.


What about my other self? I guess the cultist didn't notice her when pulling me. Or he was doing this one at a time? My question was answered as he told me to scoot to the corner of the bed, and, as I did so, he reached underneath the bed and pulled my other self out. She screamed as he made her sit down on the bed.


The cultist showed her the same videos and asked her the same question. Before she answered, a light formed in the corner of my eye. I turned my head and saw what looked to be the portal from earlier. It was back!


That agent stepped back out, making eye contact with me, then looking over my shoulder, adopting a look of surprise. She jumped back into the portal, then stepped back out with a handgun and aimed it over my shoulder.


"Set these people free," said the agent. "If you do, you can go back to your reality, but be monitored rather than sent to prison."


"I don't need to worry about that," said the cultist. "No matter what you do to me, Nnotz will be watching."


"I guess whatever helps your psyche," said the agent. "Tell me what you're going to do in this town."


"As if this is the only town we've been popping up in," said the cultist, giggling monotonously.


"Oh really, creepy man?" said the agent.


"I'm not telling you anything more," said the cultist.


The agent pulled the trigger. The cultist tumbled to the floor. With a look more straight faced than what would seem normal, the agent dragged mr. cultist into the portal. The cultist was frozen, mumbling on his way. A minute later, the agent stepped back out of the portal. To my delight, she told us she was going to get us out of here.


She walked us down the stairs. Once we got to the living room, she blew a hole into the wall between the front door and the window. She stepped through the hole and we followed. Lights flashed through the fog, but no one was making any noise. The agent stood close to us and pulled out her phone. Teeth were sticking out of the screen.


"What… in the… what is happening here?" the agent asked herself.


The phone buzzed, falling out of the agent's hands and landing with a thud on the concrete. Once a clearing opened up in the fog, I could see red veins squirming out of the charging port. My stomach clenched at the sight. The agent stomped on the phone over and over and over, cracking the screen and splintering the case until purple fluid was oozing out of the charging port… and the sides. The fog got thicker again, covering the damaged phone.


The next thing she did was walk us to the library, telling us to keep quiet on the way. I dreaded going in there to witness the sphere, so once we arrived, I told the agent I didn't want to go in. She told me all I needed to do was stand under any of the windows and call the police if I heard any screams from inside. She gave the same mission to my other self, who asked her what I was wondering. Why would she go in alone?


"It's just what I'm used to," she said. "I love it."


She walked away, disappearing into the fog. I made my way over to the building, taking slow steps to ensure I wouldn't bump into anything. I was hoping there'd be more clearings, but there was only one behind me. Once I reached the building, I tripped over the fence, but picked myself back up and stood under the window.


After about a minute, I started hearing gunshots. As I listened in, somebody called out to me.


"Hey! Come with us right now!"


I could see their silhouette, but they were still. I asked them who they were, but they didn't answer. Chills ran down my spine.


Listening through the window, I could hear a croak, along with more gunshots. I also began to hear footsteps walking along the grass. They got louder and louder. The damn tracking chip. I needed to get this thing out of my neck. I was grabbed by the head and put into a headlock. The adrenaline was rising again. I couldn't think of anything to say other than…


"No!"


Where were the government agents when you needed them?


"Is something going on over there?" asked a male voice.


"Everything's fine!" said the man holding me hostage.


Typical. Cheesy even…


The man covered my mouth and brought me to the ground. As he tackled me, I noticed the fog was getting lighter. I could see the silhouettes of nearby cars and buildings, then the outlines, then their actual appearance.


Two men in suits ran up to me. They argued with the cultist, then eventually pulled him off of me. I felt relieved. I glanced back at the library. A wild chilling croak made the ground vibrate. I could hear some crashing and smashing coming from inside the building. I began to be able to hear the noises with greater clarity, as if all the windows on the building had been smashed. The agent better be winning, I hoped.


I couldn't see anything, but the sounds I was hearing were putting me in a frozen trance. They were so erratic... and sinister. I couldn't explain exactly what I was hearing aside from the croaking and some animalistic screeching mixed together. They were rough. Not knowing who was winning kept me on edge further.


There was a loud but soft explosion, then the screeching and croaking stopped. Seconds later, I began to see the outline of the library. Black liquid was leaking out of each of the windows. The front door was opened, then the sound of quick footsteps ran across the grass, getting louder and louder. I could see the outline of the agent. She was running by a couple men in suits.


"You need to tell us exactly who you are and who you're affiliated with," said one of the men.


"Well, my name is Arilyn Campbell," said the agent. "As for my affiliates, how about I write a report for you guys?"


The agents told her that was fine, where to contact the FBI to give the report, and who they were. They left with the cultist, who was aggressively attempting to break free from their tight grip.


All I could think about was the Arilyn Campbell I read about. The one who tanked an entire world's creature-fighting economy. Arilyn walked up to me. I gave her a look of confusion as she reached me and stopped.


"You good?" Arilyn asked.


"There was an agent with the exact same name as you who destroyed an entire world and sent somebody back to the 1500s," I said. "At least, according to a document."


"What document?" Arilyn asked. "There are plenty of documents, usually from entitled people, that shit talk me."


"A document I translated after I found it under my floorboards," I said.


"Those guys were using monster fighting organizations as a disguise for… get this… multiversal domination," Arilyn said, rolling her eyes.


I was confused. They were the evil ones all along?


"So, they were bad guys?" I asked Arilyn.


"Terrible guys… yes," Arilyn said. "So many accusations of rights violations and manipulation. They took care of 1% of all the creatures slipping into their reality and made up grand numbers to make them look like bosses."


I was relieved to hear Arilyn wasn't evil, but not so much that I fell for a 500-year-old lie. I brought up the third page, the one with the predictions on it.


"Wow," Arilyn said. "He wanted to convince people he was right so badly he sat down and vaguely predicted every anomalous event?"


"Yeah," I said, giggling.


"He's probably long dead now," Arilyn said. "Hey, did he predict this? The thing that happened to this town?"


"Yes," I said. "Correct date and my actual surname."


"What was the next date?"


"May 15, 2023," I said. "But instead of a surname, it just said Switzerland."


"Huh," Arilyn said. "A trick I use is I go to an alternate reality where it's essentially the same as thelne I was in, but a sometime in the future. I'll do that to make sure nothing drastic happens." Suddenly, she had a look of urgency on her face. "Okay, I don't have much time to chat right now. Your town is freed and the connections between realities have been closed. Have a good day."


Arilyn opened up another portal and walked in. The portal vanished, leaving me with the sight of a dozen agents, dented SUVs, broken shop windows across the street, and a phone with teeth and grey withering veins hanging out of every hole.


The end of this was so sudden, but welcoming. It looked like the situation was really over!


I'm glad this is over, although I still need to bring up the tracking chip to somebody who can help me out in that regard, and my other self is still here too although now I can actually have fun with her being a mirrored version of me. I feel weird about new phones now, so I might stick to older models for a while.


Hopefully, the FBI will release information about this event to the public. I just got a letter from them, reminding me not to share pictures or videos of the black ooze, purple ooze, freaky mouths, or the sphere of monstrosity. It ended with the usual note… "The FBI will release information regarding this anomaly to the public once it has determined it is appropriate to do so."


Only time will tell.
