Taking in the sick display my mother had greeted me with, I was unable to contain my terror. The way the slaughtered doe's glazed eyes looked up at me, my mother's completely vapid stare as penetrating as it was numb while she kept nursing that fucking wineglass… it was too much.

I doubled over and emptied my stomach onto the floor.

*What had become of my mother?* 

I had this feeling of disconnect again, like my body wasn't mine to control—my soul's absence was making itself painfully noticeable in my state of distress. Nevertheless, I found my fingers trembling as beads of cold sweat ran down my skin. My guts were still churning, and I was whimpering like a dying cat. 

"Mom?" I pressed out, tears rolling down my cheeks. "Please, I want my mom back." 

I don't know why that was the only thing I could think to say, but my mind was in another place entirely. The carnage didn't matter anymore. The buzzing noises didn't matter anymore. All that mattered was my mother. Just to remind you, I was in my mid twenties when this happened, but my fear for my mother was reducing me to a much more vulnerable state. I felt like a kid again, and I was just about ready to pee my pants, but I had to pull myself together. 

I took a cautious step towards the familiar woman who was sitting there, unmoved, in a bloodbath of her own creation. I extended my hand to her. "Mom? Let's go upstairs. Let's go lie down."

"But I just slept the whole night long."

"I think it hasn't been quite enough," I pressed out, trying to hide the tremor in my voice.

"If you say so." Mom rose from her seat. "But remember, you're a part of him, and he's a part of you."

"Who?"

Ignoring my question, she latched onto my arm. "He has a deep, *deep* lust for you, Fiona. But don't be afraid. It's the same lust he feels for everyone, and everything… because we're all part of him, you know?"

"I don't understand," I muttered, voice brittle. I had a feeling she was trying to tell me something of actual relevance, but whatever madness had taken hold of her didn't let her. 

"It'll be over soon. He never needed me, but he's getting old… Old, old, old and so vulnerable… He'll need you, and you need him." She paused to take a long, wheezing breath. "His love is lust, and his lust turns into hunger, and he keeps confusing the three."

"What are you talking about?"

"Oh, it'll be over soon, honey, don't worry so much. I'm sorry for the mess." She let out another sigh as I guided her into her bedroom and allowed her to gently lower herself down on the mattress beside Dad. He had already sat up and was regarding us in bewilderment, but I motioned for him to stay quiet. 

"I do so miss my little boys. And the one with the fire in his throat, I miss that one, too."

I swallowed audibly as I reached for the blanket to tuck her in. She looked so tiny all of a sudden. 

“I love you, Fiona.” Mom closed her eyes, grasping my hand in hers. "This is the hard part," she whispered. Her head hit the pillow and she drifted off to sleep in an instant. 

My father and I exchanged stupefied glances. “You don’t wanna see what happened downstairs,” I informed him. “I’ve gotta go clean up. Keep the others up here until I’ve given you the green light. We need to talk about getting her admitted later, we’ll have to call a doctor or something, I don’t know…”

I started trudging down the stairs. Our house had gotten very empty over the last couple years. Jem had already left us a long time ago, Cas had launched his career and moved out a couple years prior, so my sisters were the only kids who still stayed at our place, aside from myself. For as long as I can remember, it had been set in stone that I would be the one to inherit the land. I think my mother had known that from the moment she popped me out, and she’d started making her expectations very clear to me in my early twenties. Honestly, part of me had already known there was no escape for me, no life outside the forest. I spent many years in denial about that. By the time this happened, though, I knew my place. I knew it would always be me who’d have to deal with the bloody shit.

I got nauseous several times while tidying up the kitchen. The doe wasn’t particularly easy to carry, and the flies and the stench didn’t help. At some point, I just sort of mentally disconnected from everything. My mind was somewhere far, far away while my hands picked up and scrubbed the plates and wiped the blood off the table. My legs carried me out the door as I dragged the doe outside, leaving a bald valley in the fresh snow as I crossed the yard with the cadaver in tow. My back was starting to hurt. I let go of the doe and straightened up to stretch, only to bump into someone who’d been standing right behind me. I whipped my head around to find myself face to face with the Leshy, who had mercifully adopted his human form, lest I would have likely suffered cardiac arrest. 

“Bring me food, there, heiress?” He pointed at the doe.

“Well, you can have it, I guess,” I muttered, still sort of shaken. “You’d just give me shit otherwise, right?”

*Oops. Probably shouldn’t talk like that to the Lord of the woods.* It had kinda just slipped out. I was still in a daze, my tongue acting on its own. I was already preparing for hell to break loose, but the Leshy actually started smiling.
“Oh, I’ll give you more than enough *shit* in your lifetime, Fiona.”

Fiona. Hearing my name from him was always beyond eerie. I gritted my teeth but refrained from commenting.

“But not now,” the Leshy clarified graciously. “Although I do like company while I eat.” He cocked his head.

“Please no,” I mumbled wearily. 

His smile grew wider as he pointed at the ground. “Sit.”

I sighed very deeply before gathering my skirt at my sides and plopping down. I tried not to watch as the Leshy knelt down, setting his cudgel aside and reaching out his hand, proceeding to plunge it into the carcass, somehow instantly piercing the skin. His fingers coaxed a disgusting squelching noise from the doe’s insides as he started rummaging around in them. Just as I thought the sound was going to make me throw up again, he pulled his arm back out, producing something red and drippy. It took me a while to realize it was the doe’s heart. He held it out to me.

“Take a bite,” he invited.

“No, thanks.”

“Take a bite,” the Leshy repeated.

“Thanks but seriously, no.”

“Fiona.” This time, it sounded like a threat.

So I started crying. 

The Leshy just kind of looked at me with wide eyes before sinking his teeth into the heart himself, chewing pensively. “What’s wrong?” he asked, not bothering to swallow before speaking up. 

I kept bawling, gurgling incoherently. The wood-demon was beginning to look a little put off, but he didn’t stop eating. We must have been quite a sight sitting there together. I think I was starting to make him uncomfortable, if he was able to feel something of the sort. 

“There, there,” he said softly, still chewing as he rose to his feet. “Relax, I need you to hold still for a moment.”

Somehow, I was overcome by the sudden urge to obey. He grabbed my face and pried my mouth open. I was too shocked to move; it just happened so fast. He leaned down and spat the stinking, foul red mush his teeth had turned the doe’s heart into right down my throat. He held my gaze the entire time, clasping my mouth shut the second the last bit of red had landed on my tongue. My fear reflected in his steely eyes, tears kept on rolling down my face. 

“You need to swallow now.”

I shook my head, letting out a choked sob as I tried to ignore the rotten taste. 

“I’m not letting you go until you swallow.” He sighed, readjusting his grip. “Come on, don’t make this any harder than it needs to be. Trust me, you’ll thank me for this.”

Something about his tone was oddly disarming. I squeezed my eyes shut, grimaced and gulped it down. He removed his hand and I stuck out my tongue to prove there was nothing left. The effect hit me immediately as I was overcome by a serene, pulse-slowing calmness. The tension disappeared from my shoulders and I let go of a long breath, wiping the tears from my puffy red cheeks. 

“Feels good, don’t it?” the Leshy asked.

“This is sure to make me sick,” I grumbled.

“It won’t. Sure, it’d be tastier if it were fresher, but it serves the same purpose. The flesh of a doe from these woods steels the nerves when consumed raw.”

“Huh. Why’d you have to make me eat the heart, though?”

He looked seriously puzzled. “Well, because it’s the best part?” Shaking his head at my cluelessness, he added, “I saw your mother slay this one last night. She looked quite out of it, waltzing through the darkness with that machete on her…”

“I think she’s dying,” I blurted out. “I don’t know what’s going on with her. She seemed fine yesterday, but then she started talking about the huldufólk, whatever that is; and now she’s just gone completely crazy, she’s not making *any* sense…” I had to catch my breath before carrying on, but the Leshy merely held up a hand, cutting me off.

“I’ll warn you not to speak too loudly of the huldufólk. There are forces here that even I find difficult to control.” He paused, regarding me with something akin to pity. “I understand that this will be hard for you, gentle soul. But trust that all pain and grief shall pass someday. That’s what I’ll leave you with. Return to your mother, stay by her side and if you can, bid her farewell from me, too.”

“So she really is going to die?”

“The huldufólk have to pay their toll to hell, heiress.” He stood up and, to my surprise, helped me to my feet. “I’ll take the carcass off your hands. What belongs in the woods will be mine again. Run along, wench.”

Not wanting to overstay my welcome, I headed back to the house as fast as I could. I didn't think that the Leshy had lied to me, and that assumption was confirmed when I heard a hair-raising cry the moment I burst through the front door. It was my mother's voice, agonized and frightened, coming from inside the master bedroom. I found my father at the top of the staircase, looking down at me and frantically motioning for me to hurry. We hastened down the hallway together, telling the girls to stay in their rooms as they briefly stuck their heads out.

We shoved open the bedroom door just in time to see Mom crawling off the bed on her hands and feet, facing the ceiling in a grotesque, spider-like manner, howling like a banshee. It was probably the most horrifically gruesome sight I ever had the displeasure of beholding, but the doe’s heart had not yet ceased to affect me. The unnatural, relentless calm allowed me to break through my mental fog and rush to my mother’s side, gathering her frail, writhing body in my arms and forcing her into a hug. Dad was screaming; in fact, he couldn’t stop screaming; he was clawing at the skin of his own face, tugging on his hair and wailing, until I turned and told him to finally shut up. I understood the sentiment perfectly, but some daughterly instinct of mine told me that these were my mother’s last moments. I didn’t want her to meet her death surrounded by panic and despair.

"Mom?" I whispered to her as the haze in her eyes let up.

Her chapped lips stretched into a wan smile. She didn't say anything, merely grasped my arm with her fingers. Her hand was incredibly cold. I pulled her a little closer and she let out a low moan.

"Fiona," she rasped out.

"Mommy, I'm here."

"Is it okay?"

"Sure. Everything's okay, Mom."

"Fiona… I'll be going now."

"I know."

"Are you…" Her voice faltered and she swallowed. "…gonna be okay?"

"I'll be fine, Mommy." I buried my face in the crook of her neck as she weakly wrapped her arms around my shoulders. 

"See you when you're ready, honey," she muttered into my ear before her head dropped onto my chest. I sat there on the floor, cradling her until I was afraid her body would begin to stiffen. I laid her out on the bed. Her eyes were shut, her mouth slightly curved. I hadn't expected this, but she actually looked peaceful. The minutes preceding her death had been fearful and excruciating, but the moment itself had been harmonious.

The ground was frozen and rock-hard when Dad and I dug out the grave. It wasn't easy, but we managed. We laid her to rest beneath the red meadow, calling everyone she was close with as well as the extended family. Jem didn't show up, but Cas obviously came and so did Mom's sisters and brothers from out of state. We hosted a small gathering at our house. Cas and the girls cried their eyes out. Dad kept his composure during the funeral service, but afterwards, he was never the same. No matter how often they'd fought, no matter how many times Mom had cussed him out and he'd compared her to other women, her demise left him adrift and just utterly shattered. As soon as my sisters were out of the house, he moved to some sunny place where he could ogle bikini babes and pretend he hadn't lost the love of his life.

So I told all this to Jacek as we sat on the couch. Most of it, at least. 

"I'm really sorry," he said when I concluded my report. "I didn't mean to tear open any old wounds."

I regarded him with a tilted head. "You haven't seen Mom down there by any chance, have you?"

"In hell? No. That's not quite how it works. Not everybody gets… that kind of an afterlife."
His eyes were glistening a little. "Sorry," he repeated, stealthily wiping the moisture away. 

"It's cool." Cas had wrapped his arms around me from behind, his chin on my shoulder. "C'mere, man. Triple hug. I know she meant a lot to you."

Jacek gave him a weird look but, after a moment of consideration, very briefly joined us to form a warm, comfortable sandwich. After a few seconds, he drew back and awkwardly cleared his throat. 

"Two things. Remember that dog I had with me sometimes?"

"Sure do."

"It's not still around by any chance, is it?"

"Yeah," I replied. "We ran into it a couple days ago. Seemed to miss you a lot, it still knew me…"

"Huh. Who woulda guessed. I thought it hated the surface. Always considered myself selfish for summoning it in the first place. Wow, I feel, like, twice as shitty now." He coughed. "Anyways, second question—did you ever find out more about the huldufólk?"

"Nope."

"Well, no matter." A sly grin began to unfurl on his lips. "I might have an idea."
