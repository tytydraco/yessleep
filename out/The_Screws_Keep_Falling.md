It started small. A single screw on the floor near my front door.

I almost stepped on it. Thought nothing of it. Picked it up, tossed it in a drawer.

The next day, another one. This time by the hallway vent.

Then more—on the stairs, beneath my bed, in the bathroom sink.

By the fourth day, I felt sick.

They weren’t just screws. They were the same size, the same shape. They were *coming from something.*

I checked every piece of furniture, every fixture. I ran my fingers along the walls, pressing, knocking. Nothing felt loose.

That night, I heard it.

A tiny metallic *plink.*

I sat up in bed, heart hammering. The sound had come from the hallway.

I didn’t move. Didn’t breathe.

Then another *plink*.

I forced myself to get up. I grabbed my phone, turned on the flashlight, and stepped into the hall.

A screw lay on the hardwood floor.

I looked up.

The air vent.

One of its screws was missing.

I told myself it was normal. Things come loose. Houses settle. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something had… *unscrewed* it.

The next morning, I found a handful of them by my bedroom door. As if someone had *placed them there.*

I called a handyman that afternoon. He checked everything—vents, hinges, furniture. He tightened every screw he could find.

“Probably just vibrations in the house,” he said. “Could be the HVAC, could be nothing. I wouldn’t worry.”

I *wanted* to believe him.

That night, I lay in bed, every muscle tense, waiting for it.

At exactly 3:12 AM—

*Plink.*

Then another.

And another.

*Plink. Plink. Plink.*

The sound moved.

From the hallway… to the ceiling. To the vent.

I turned my head.

The vent cover was barely hanging on.

Something was *pulling the screws out from inside.*

I gripped my phone, heart hammering. I wanted to turn on the flashlight, but I was *afraid* of what I might see.

The screws hit the floor one by one, forming a neat little trail toward my bed.

I didn’t sleep.

By morning, I found a pile of them. A *dozen screws*, perfectly aligned in a row on my nightstand.

I didn’t put them there.

I packed a bag. Called my brother. Told him I was staying over.

When I opened the closet to grab my jacket—

A screw fell.

From *inside* the wall.

I ran.

My brother let me crash at his place, but he thought I was losing it. I started to believe him. Maybe I was. Maybe it was stress, paranoia, something explainable.

Two nights later, I went back. Just to check.

The house was silent. Nothing looked out of place. No new screws on the floor. No missing vent covers. Maybe whatever had happened was *over.*

Then, just as I turned to leave—

*plink.*

I whipped around.

A single screw lay on the floor.

From the hallway vent.

The cover hung loose, barely clinging on.

And inside the vent—

I saw it.

A sliver of darkness.

Then an eye.

Unblinking.

Watching me.

Something inside *shifted*.

I ran.

I haven’t been back since. I don’t think I ever will.

But every now and then, at night, even at my brother’s place—

I swear I can hear it.

*Plink.*
