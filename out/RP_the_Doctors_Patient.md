__the Details__:
I've recently  been interested in a plot that is inspired by *Hannibal* (2013) the one featuring Mads Mikkelsen and Hugh Dancy, without the snacking on humans part, [unless that's your thing, because it could be mine!] But mainly just with Hannibal's signature manipulation and control. I'm looking for a Hannibal, treating Crucible "Cru" Moray, a young, na√Øve, college freshman studying pre-med, who struggles with severe anxiety and perfectionism. She also has *major* Daddy issues, which the doctor can exploit.  

Throughout the role, which I assume is long-term, the doctor will groom her in a dd/lg sort of situation by controlling what she does through her therapy, but also maybe by lacing her medications with other sketchy substances, leveraging her trauma, and things of that nature. And, of course, the girl has some very fun Daddy issues, that no doubt the doctor will pick up on, using them to his full advantage when making her his project [cannibal?] plaything. 


__the Beginning__: 

Crucible Moray walked from the warm, cozy university library to her car, parked in the back of the parking lot--she couldn't park in front--the closeness to the other cars made her too nervous. Her teeth chattered, and her glasses were fogged--it wasn't a good time to go out, but it was time for her therapy appointment. 

Her psychiatrist, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, was probably already sitting, legs crossed in his chair. She straightened her mustard knitted sweater a little, pulling her short black skirt into its proper place as she got out at his office. It was her fourth session with Dr. Lecter, and she liked the man. They shared some similarities--their Type A personalities, their shared medical pursuits, their use of a favorite pen--though Cru's was a fine-tipped gel writer, and Dr. Lecter's was a vintage fountain pen. 

Since she liked him so much, that meant she wanted to please Dr. Lecter, following his orders. However, she hadn't this week, and the thought already set her heart to pounding before she even got there, since she hadn't written in her journal this week. 

That was how Crucible Moray was wired--she liked to please--she had ever since she was a child. She rarely misbehaved or got in trouble. She had a perfect grade-point-average from elementary school through college, and her perfectly organized iPad lived in her purse, next to her anti-anxiety medicine and a snack, should she need one. That was how she lived. 

Since Cru was only ten when her father passed away, it started out like that for her mother. She didn't want to be a burden on the young widow, so her perfectionism went into overdrive. She had always tried to please both her mother and her father, who was after away on a military tour, but once he passed, it was just to alleviate the stress of her mother, being the best sweetest girl she could be. That was how Crucible Moray struggled in managing her own grief for her father. 

"Hello, Dr. Lecter," Crucible smiled her usual sweet smile for the man, staring up at him doe-eyed."Um... my week was *okay*, I suppose. It was--I had lots of homework, three panic attacks, called my Mom crying once, didn't have time to journal (she skipped over the last bit quickly), avoiding eye contact, biting her lip nervously, as if she were afraid she was going to be in trouble for the panic attacks, like they were a red stain upon her week. 

"But I got an A on my Anatomy exam and a perfect score on my Foundations of Public Health paper," Crucible said, looking up expectantly, almost as if she were waiting for Daddy to give her a kiss on the forehead for a job well done.

Heya! I'm Cru!  I'll write on most any platform! I'm 29, and live in EST. I live with chronic pain, though, so that makes my schedule sort of no fun, though I am available day and night! I take a lot of  naps, though. I usually write about 4-6 paragraphs, but can write more or less. If you write more or less, that's amazing, and I'd love to hear from you through Reddit chat or message!
