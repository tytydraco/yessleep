* I spoke with Father Caughtree today. He says I can trust him, that he’s here to listen if I ever need someone. He gave me a candy bar—said it was because I’d been so good in church. He’s kind, though I didn’t want him to think I was needy. It’s been a long time since anyone cared like that. He even let me visit his house once. I was scared at first, but it felt safe. Father listened to me talk about my family—about how Daddy would hit me when I didn’t do things right. How he’d look at me with that mean stare and call me useless. I cried. Father didn’t judge. He just touched my face. He says God has a plan, that everything will be alright.
* I want to believe him. But sometimes… sometimes I wonder if anyone will make things alright. Maybe it’s just easier to believe in someone who promises things will get better. I feel embarrassed though. I don’t want to cry in front of him. But Father says there’s no shame in it.
* Sometimes \[page torn off\] and then I was crying again, I feel embarrassed but Father told me there's no need to be ashamed. \[Page torn off\] ever since then, Father Caughtree comes to me every Sunday after mass now... \[this part of the page was burned off\].

* \[Page torn off by either owner or some other circumstance\] I hate you, daddy.'

**December \[X\]  \[Intentionally censored by the owner\]**

* And Father Caughtree—where is he? Where did he go? There’s a new priest at the church now. Father Sullivan, I think his name is. It’s not the same. I don’t feel safe with him like I did with Father Caughtree. Why did he just leave? Why didn’t he say goodbye? Maybe he didn’t care after all. But it was always about me, wasn’t it? Just me. And I know that now.

**January 1, 1965**

* I’m starting to think I should’ve known better. Father Caughtree never came back after mass that Sunday. They said he’d gone missing. The news said they found his purple blood-soaked coat and a smiling badge. It was like he vanished into thin air. But I saw him yesterday. I felt him. I don’t know what to think anymore. Was he ever real?

* Apparently, the owner of this bank - Mr. Maroni - was a very rich man. According to Mr. Falcone, that means a fat paycheck for me. All I need to do is get the money. Just this one job and I'll be set.
* I’ve been in this business long enough to know that “one job” doesn’t always go as planned, but I’ve learned how to stay focused. This is it. This could be my ticket out of here. The details are all laid out. The plan seems simple enough. In and out, fast. No mistakes. And then, a life of comfort waiting on the other side. No more looking over my shoulder.
* I can do this.

**October 13th, 1985**

* We met at the warehouse south of Gotham last night. It was a dead drop. Mr. Falcone has a contact for the job, some guy I’ve never met before.
* “New blood in the underworld,” according to Mr. Falcone. Even though this clown has been climbing the ranks as a “crime lord” for only three years, he's got his hands dirty enough to prove himself. 
* But there’s something about him. Something I can’t quite place.
* His smile is… off. It’s too wide, like it doesn’t belong. Like it’s been glued on———too fake, too rehearsed. He’s younger than I expected for someone at his level, and he doesn’t act like the usual thugs we work with. But that smile… I swear I’ve seen it somewhere before. Or someone wearing it, maybe. There’s a rumor going around that he killed his old boss and wore his face like a mask to intimidate underlings who wouldn't submit. There was another story that says his "face" mask belonged to some priest. Crazy shit, right? I don’t know if I believe it, but the smile, that damn smile, keeps nagging at me.

**October 14th, 1985**

* I’m in the truck now, on the way to the bank. Masks—check. Guns—check. Gas—check. Everything’s set. I’ve done this before, but it never feels normal. I picked the Bat mask. It’s the only one that doesn’t look like a damn clown. Something about clowns sets me off. It’s like they’re mocking something, or maybe I’m just projecting. They remind me of my father—his twisted smile, the way he’d laugh when things went wrong. It was always a joke to him. Always funny. Even when I was crying.

**October 15th, 1985**

* I’m not sure how I’m still alive. Maybe it’s luck. Maybe it’s something worse. Pretty soon, the commissioner's men will arrive to interrogate me. I’ve been staring at these hospital walls for hours, but my brain won’t let me forget what happened at the bank.
* We were supposed to be in and out, clean and simple. But that’s not how it went down—not by a long shot. I should have known. I wrote about it—stupid, stupid, stupid.
* I thought the plan was tight. Mr. Falcone’s guy, the "new blood"—the one with the goddamn smile—was supposed to be the muscle. The enforcer. He was supposed to keep things moving fast. He had a reputation. Hell, he was supposed to be good. But the moment we stepped into that bank, I could feel something off in the air.
* I don’t know how it happened. One minute, I was bagging the cash, watching for any signs of trouble. The next, the lights went out. It was like the world dropped into darkness, and then—gunshots. Boom. Boom. Boom. The whole room shook. Screams erupted from every direction. Everyone panicked, and there were echoes of bones breaking.
* And then I saw it.
* A shadow, low and quick, darting through the chaos, heading straight for the vault. It moved with purpose, too fast to be human. The silhouette had two unmistakable, pointy ears.
* It was HIM.
* The boogeyman.
* I thought he was just some myth. A stupid story cops used to scare low-lives like me. Some tale about a masked vigilante who struck fear into criminals. I never believed it. Not until now.
* I grabbed the last of the money, stuffed it in the bag, and turned tail—ran for the exit. But my feet never hit the floor the way I thought they would. I was on the ground. I don't know why.
* I could taste blood in my mouth, feel the hot, sticky trickle from my side. I heard the gunshots too close, too real. My head spun, and the floor spun with it. The world felt like it was unraveling.
* And then… his face. That stupid Scarface-wannabe. That fucking smile, like he knew what was about to happen. He shot me. Right in the side. I wasn’t even ready for it. I didn’t hear him pull the trigger. It was like he’d been waiting for the right moment, like it was part of the plan the whole time. I don’t know why he did it, but the look in his eyes... It was like he wanted me to see it coming.
* Then, they ran away. All of them. They abandoned me. That joker shot two more of his own men before disappearing around the corner.
* I begged. "Please, don’t leave me."
* I felt pathetic.
* But the boogeyman's shadow loomed over me, cold and monstrous, as if it swallowed the light around us. I could see his eyes now.
* His eyes… They’re not human.
