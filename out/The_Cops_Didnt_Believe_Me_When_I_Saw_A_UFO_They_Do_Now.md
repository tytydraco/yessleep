I’m writing this from inside an interrogation room, barricaded behind a desk and a filing cabinet, hands shaking, with the lights flickering overhead and something wet scratching at the other side of the door.

I don’t know how much time I have. But someone needs to know what happened. Someone needs to understand what’s coming.

It started last night, just after 1:40 a.m., when I caught the last bus home after my shift at the gas station. Route 13. Practically abandoned. It cuts through a winding stretch of forest before looping out toward the far edge of town where I rent a little house. Most nights, I’m the only passenger. Just me and Marcus, the driver.

Marcus was solid. Quiet. Maybe late fifties. Always wore a faded baseball cap, always had a half-dead cigarette tucked behind his ear. The kind of guy who gave off this unshakeable calm, like he’d seen everything and just didn’t care anymore.

He didn’t scare easy.

Until last night.

We were maybe three stops from mine, just entering the thickest part of the woods. The trees crowd close there—thick, black pines that block out the stars. The air always feels heavier, like the forest is *watching*. Then the bus stuttered. Just once.

The headlights flickered. The dash lights dimmed. And then, with a grinding *wheeze*, everything died. No power. No engine. No hum of electricity. The heater shut off and the cold hit me like a wave.

And then the light came.

Not headlights. Not lightning. Something *else*.

A white, sterile brilliance washed over the forest—so bright it bled through the seams of the bus, glowing under the seats, behind the windows, through the *metal*. It wasn’t light. It was erasure. Like everything outside the bus had been painted over.

Marcus stood slowly.

I remember the way he looked back at me—one hand on the door lever, eyes narrowed. Not scared exactly. Just… resigned.

“Stay here,” he said. “No matter what.”

The doors opened with a hiss—*even though there was no power*. Marcus stepped out into the light, casting a long shadow behind him.

I climbed into the driver’s seat, heart pounding.

That’s when I saw it.

The ship wasn’t above us. It was *ahead*, parked right on the road like it had always been there. It was impossible to focus on—curved in ways that made my head hurt, like a Mobius strip made of bone and steel. The surface writhed subtly, pulsing like it was breathing. Or hungry.

And then they came.

They didn’t walk. They glided—silent and deliberate, like something underwater. They were tall, thin, their skin waxy and pale. Their arms bent in too many places, like dislocated joints moving with unnatural precision. Their heads were smooth, eyeless, featureless except for a vertical slit that split open slowly when they got close, revealing a slick red membrane that *rippled* like it was tasting the air.

They approached Marcus and *touched* him—just a single hand on his forehead. He went stiff. Then they turned, and he followed them like a puppet on strings, walking up into the open ship.

No sound. No struggle. Just obedience.

Then—*nothing*.

The light vanished.

The ship… was just *gone*.

Like it had never existed.

I ran. I don’t remember getting off the bus. I remember the cold air biting my lungs and the sting of tree branches on my face as I sprinted through the forest toward the main road. I flagged down a logging truck, babbled something about abduction and creatures and Marcus disappearing.

The driver called the cops. They met me in minutes.

They didn’t believe me, of course. But they were kind about it. Too kind. Like they were handling someone fragile. They brought me to the station.

That was their mistake.

I told them everything. Six officers. One dispatcher. Two detectives. All of them sitting in stunned silence as I described the ship, the things that came down, the way Marcus didn’t fight.

Then the lights flickered.

Just once.

Then again.

Then everything went *dead*.

And the humming started.

Not mechanical. Not even physical. It was in our *skulls*. A low, nauseating frequency that vibrated behind the eyes. One officer screamed and dropped his radio. Another grabbed his head and staggered back against the wall, eyes rolled up into white.

Then the windows shattered.

The front glass *imploded*, and a gust of cold air filled the room, reeking of burnt plastic and decay. Something stepped through—*no, spilled through*—like it was peeling itself into our reality.

It was one of them.

But this time, there were *many*.

Chaos erupted.

One officer fired his sidearm. The bullets froze midair—hung there for a second—and then reversed direction and tore *into* him. Another was *lifted* by his throat and *peeled open* from the jaw like paper. There was no blood at first—just smoke, like something inside him had boiled before his skin caught up.

One creature slid through the ceiling tiles and dropped onto an officer’s back. It wrapped long fingers around his head and *sank* its hand through his skull like it was dipping into clay.

The screams never stopped. They didn’t even sound human after a while.

I watched the sergeant try to fight one off with a baton. It didn’t even flinch. It let him hit it—then folded itself inside out and *swallowed him whole*. His body didn’t fall. It just *melted into the thing* like it was never there.

I ran.

I don’t even remember getting into the interrogation room. I just remember slamming the door and jamming the filing cabinet in front of it. My hands were covered in someone else’s blood.

Now I’m here.

Listening.

The hall is quiet, except for the occasional *click*. Like bone tapping on tile. Or teeth chattering in reverse.

Then the scratching started.

Soft at first. Curious. Then faster. More aggressive. Long, sharp movements. Something dragging claws across the wood and glass. Something *eager*.

I didn’t dare look through the window.

But I should’ve known they’d *want me to*.

Because that’s when I saw it.

Standing outside. In the parking lot. Perfectly still.

One of them. Tall. Pale. Skin like curdled milk. Long arms dangling at its sides like puppet strings.

And its head…

Its head was *Marcus’s face*.

Not a mask. Not a copy.

His *actual face*—stitched onto its head like wet leather, stretched too thin over something *not meant to wear it*. His eyes were glassy. Lips pulled into a slight, pleasant smile.

And then it spoke.

In Marcus’s voice.

“Come on now.”

“It’s alright.”

“Let us in.”

“You’re the last one.”

His voice was calm. Kind. Familiar.

But there was something under it. A subtle delay. Like someone practicing speech by playing it through a broken speaker. Like it didn’t *know* what it was saying—just that it had to say it.

The scratching’s getting louder now. Faster. The door’s vibrating like something’s clawing at the lock from the inside.

They don’t want to kill me.

They want me to *open the door*.

They want *permission*.

They want *compliance*.

I can hear more of them out there now—clicking, hissing, mimicking footsteps and whispered voices. One of them is giggling. In my voice.

I’m not going to make it out of this room.

But I needed someone to know what happened here.

This isn’t science fiction.

It’s not invasion.

It’s *replacement*.

And if this is just the beginning…

**I don’t think we’re the dominant species anymore.**
