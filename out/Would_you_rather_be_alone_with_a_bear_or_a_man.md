You have probably all seen or heard of the bear or a man trend. The trend is where a person asks a women if she’d rather be alone in the woods with a bear or a man. Unsupprisingly most women choose the bear. I’m one of those women, here’s why.

I was in my early 20s and me and my best friend, Miranda, decided to hike the entire Appalachian trail. We had shipped packages of food to post offices along the trail. We were ready for the 7 months on the trail ahead of us. 

The entire trip went smoothly for the first 4 months. We had the time of our lives, but as soon as we made it to deep Appalachia, was when the illusion of an amazing trip was shattered. 

The night before Miranda went missing was when we encountered the strange man. At that time we were in the heart of the wilderness. No cell service for miles. We’ve all heard of the deep Appalachia stories. I was still in my early 20s and was always a bit superstitious. The nights prior were followed with sounds of footsteps getting closer to our tent. We assumed it was an animal but the way it just stood there right in-front of the tent. This happened for 4 days in a row. On the 4th night, when we heard the footsteps, 

Miranda shouted “Hello” 

It was nothing but silence for about 30 seconds until Miranda said Hello again. We were so afraid to get out of our tent. We could 100% tell it was a human by the sounds of the breathing. The breathing sounded like he’d smoked about 10 cigarettes everyday of his life. Me and Miranda whispered to each-other, about unzipping the tent, the man outside must have heard us because we could no longer hear the breathing or the footsteps. 

The morning after that, me and Miranda woke up and noticed all of our maps had been completely stolen from our packs. We had absolutely nowhere to go. There were a million other trails here to go down. We were stuck in the middle of the woods.

 We got into our tent late that night, and when I went to zip up the tent I skimmed the trees for  movement when behind a tree, about 40 feet ahead, I saw a large figure standing behind it. In panic, I whispered to Miranda for her flashlight, and when I shined it on that tree, I saw the figure who’d been stalking us for the past week. It was a huge man, looked to be about 3 to 400 pounds and stood around 6 and 1/2 feet tall. A beard hanging down to his chest, and our maps were in his jeans pocket.  

Miranda and I sat there for a minute, while the whole time the man had been watching us. Watching us panick brought a wide grin to his face, which progressively grew wider. 

Me and Miranda completely took off, running deeper into nowhere. Tripping over tree roots, and trying to maneuver our way through brush piles. 

I think we’d run nonstop for about 3 hours until both of us stopped and collapsed to the ground. When I woke up, Miranda was no longer by my side. I didn’t shout her name because I was afraid that the man would hear me. I searched quietly for days and hopelessly texted her phone. I planned on trying to get out of the woods first and then go to the police department. 

It was about a week later when I encountered an older couple. They knew the area really well, and I told them about what happened. They said they’d drive me to the police station. They lead me back to there car and drove me to the police station. They walked in with me, and I told the police everything, and the police said they would look into it. 

That nice old couple actually let me stay with them that night. When I was about to lay down and try to get some sleep on their couch, when a text from Miranda finally came in. The message was from 5 days ago. 

“Lauren, they’ve tied me upside down in their trailer, I don’t know where the fuck I am, don’t tell the cops, they’re in on it too, don’t trust anyone Lauren.” 

I was absolutely horrified. That night I ran out of there house, and was able to track her location, which I wasn’t able to do before since neither of our phones had service.

 I got in the old couples car and drove to the location. It was a long dirt road that stretched far into the night. When I finally reached the trailer, I could tell this was the place. The stereotypical trailer home you’d expect to see in West Virginia. I stormed through the door, only to see Lauren’s dead body hogtied from the sealing. About 5 hillbillies were sitting on the couch, including one cop in the corner, just staring at her corpse, mesmerized. I vomited and was barely able to see straight as I made a run for the car. My vision went completely blurry to see straight because of how sick I felt. My entire body felt like it had poisoned. I ended up steering off the dirt road, and made a run down the moonlit path, all the while, the raging rednecks we’re still chasing behind me. I thought I heard police sirens behind me but I’m not sure.

This is the reason why I’d never choose a man over a bear. Most men are extraordinary like my husband but not all. There’s some that you must look out for.
