Since I was born, I have lived in a small town in the eastern bay area of California. It was a small but beautiful city. We were located within contra costa county which was home to many rolling hills and oak trees, I lived with my older brother who was 14 at the time and my parents. We resided in a large home with two stories on the top of a hill where we like often be greeted with the pleasant ocean breeze from the nearby San Francisco Bay. Sometimes, we were greeted with something else, something far less pleasant than ocean breeze. This is the story of the *thing*

When I was 12 years old, I’d always love to lay my eyes on the beautiful view from our home. I’d sometimes sit for hours just embracing everything I could see. Today was a beautiful day, the clouds were mild and soft, and the sky was bright and full of the signature breeze. As I woke up, I walked down to the kitchen to grab some breakfast where I was greeted by a wonderful sweet smell. “ Hi Matthew, “ my mother said sweetly as she’d always been, 

“ come grab a waffle, they are delicious today. “

 I was immediately excited as waffles were my favorite thing ever, so I dashed over to the large island to eat my breakfast. 

“ Thanks mom! “ I said excitedly, immediately chowing down on my food. 

“ Your brother is in the backyard mowing the lawn, sorry about the noise. “ I nodded my head and examined the room, suddenly my eyes were met with the calendar hanging on the wall. It was a pleasant day in May, however that’s not what caught my attention. What I saw was the date of the special day me and my friend would have. Every once in a while, we would ride our bikes to long distance to the Briones Regional Park, which was a beautiful expanse of rolling hills and trails. There we would hike all day long and play in the beautiful hills getting up to god knows what, and today was one of those days.

“ Mom, remember today? “

She looked confused for a moment until the calendar also caught her eyes. 

“ Oh, I’ll have to call Lucas’s mother, “ she said, “ What time are you leaving? “

“ 1 o’clock. “

She grabbed her Nokia phone, which was the biggest new thing at the time, and dialed my best friends mothers phone number. 

“ Hello, this is Alyssa, Matthew’s mom. “

As she talked on the phone, I saw my brother come in and head into his bedroom where he sneakily picked up my mother’s fashion magazine. I rolled my eyes as I knew what he was doing but ignored it, I went up to my room to text my buddy Lucas on my Nokia.

“ Hey bro, “ I texted awaiting a response. About 5 minutes later I got a response.

“ Hey, my mom says I’ll come to your house at 1 o’clock so we can ride to Briones. “ I told him that he was right and I’d see him at 1 o’clock.

When he arrived, he was all ready with his backpack and everything. “ Hey! “ I called out excitedly. Lucas was a 12 year old fair skinned boy on the cusp of puberty with medium length brown hair and green eyes. We got up to our usual shenanigans until we finally got ready to get on our bikes. Until we saw the *thing* upon leaving the house.

Every once in a while, flickering lights could be seen from the hills of Briones which were an odd blue color. They were clearly visible and had an off putting presence.

“ What’s that? “ Lucas asked me.

“ Oh, we just see those lights every now and then, we don’t really know what it is. “

This didn’t concern us at the time and after about an hour of riding we finally arrived at one of the trails. We got off of our bikes and started our hike.

“ It’s a nice day bro, “ I mentioned, “ not too hot or cold. “

“ Yeah, good thing we went today. “ Lucas added on.

We started our usual hike to one of our favorite spots in the park which had a big oak tree where we would eat all the usual snacks. However as we were hiking, a familiar voice shouted. “ Hey! “

It was my brother, what was he doing here? He got out of his Honda and ran to me.

“ You forgot your backpack, here. “ He handed it to me and drove off before I could say anything. 

“ That was weird.. “ Lucas added.

“ At least we have my backpack now “

The hike was beautiful, we crossed a lot of unmarked trails as where we usually went was deep in the park.

After around 45 minutes of hiking and doing our usual banter, we made it to the oak tree and laid out a picnic blanket. 

“ Okay, I brought some snacks and water. “ Lucas commented. As we took out all of our food from our backpacks, I noticed one more thing, my mother’s magazine. 

“ What’s that? “ Lucas asked.

“ How did this get here? “ I asked myself puzzled.

“ What is it though? “ Lucas asked me.

“ It’s one of my mom’s women’s fashion magazines, I saw Dallas grab it and head into his room, he must have accidentally left it here. “

Lucas quickly grabbed the magazine and said “ damn “ under his breath. Now that I look back at it it was a pretty normal magazine, but we were 12 going on 13 on the cusp of puberty, how could we resist?

“ Should we take a look? “ Lucas suggested.

“ I-I don’t know bro, should we? “

“ Of course we should! “ Lucas exclaimed. 

“ Aight then.. “

I hadn’t got my hands on any magazine as it was the late 1990s and they were hard to find. So obviously I was invested as we flipped through the page. Until I felt a presence, almost threatening.

“ I’ve got a stiffy now, bro. Your brother shouldn’t have put this in by accide- “

“ Do you feel that? “ I interrupted 

“ Feel what? “ Lucas asked confused.

“ I don’t know, it just feels off. “

“ You’re just excited bro. “

“ No- well yes, but I feel something off. “

Before he could get a word out, I saw it. I saw the lights. They resembled a moth flying around a lamp. I felt like I was being punished almost, I had no idea why.

“ What the hell? “ Lucas said extremely shakily.

“ I think those were the lights! Let’s go come on! “

“ We are in the middle of this mag! Seriously Matthew? “

“ I don’t care about the hot chicks no more, come on! “ 

“ Fine! “

We got up and ran to the sight where the lights were seen. After about 10 minutes we saw a sign. 

“ What the fuck? “ 

It was a tall sign that had the words “ Purificationem Statione praesmisit “ written on it. We had no idea what it meant. 

“ What the hell does that mean? “ I said. 

Before Lucas could say anything, I pointed out a weird industrial looking box building surrounded by electric fence. 

“ What is that.. “

I started to feel uneasy again, I felt a terrible sense of dread. Right when we got to the small gate, I heard a whisper right by my ear.

“ You’ve brought something impure to the site, Matthew. “

I shut down in the moment and I felt the Magazine flying at me extremely fast. I blacked out, fading into unconsciousness.
