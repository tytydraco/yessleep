**-- "Hey Babe, can you come over?"**

\-- "Uh, I mean, yeah... evrything OK?"

**-- "Yeah, just come over, please?"**

She followed this with a pouty face. I sighed. *Typical Rita.*

\-- "Yeah, okay, on my way."

I shot her a wink emoji.

**-- "Awesome! Oh, and wear something nice!"**

\-- "Huh? Babe, what's going on, here?"

**-- "Just come over, it's a surprise! See you in 10!"**

\-- "Uh... Yeah, okay, love you."

After that, I started scrambling to find the nicest outfit possible. I wasn't at all sure what this "surprise" was supposed to be, but I could tell she was excited about it. Well, it ended up taking me the better part of twenty minutes before I managed to scrape up the suit that I'd worn at my grandfather's funeral.

While I was driving down to her place, I could hear my phone buzzing off the hook. I looked to see my boy, Johnny, blowing my phone up with at least 4 different text messages, wondering where the fuck I was.

**-- "Dude, what's the hold up?"**

**-- "I'm waiting outside your house, you gonna leave my ass hanging?"**

**-- "You still remember our plans for today, don't you?"**

**-- "Dude, answer me back!"**

I rolled my eyes and sighed when I saw this. In truth, I forgot almost entirely about the fact that the two of us were even supposed to hang out. *The bowling alley, dipshit!*

I sighed, mentally slapping myself. I was about to start texting him back when I suddenly caught his last text message.

**-- "Hey man, uh... I think someone's watching me in your parking lot, man..."** Eyes wide, I frantically started texting back.

\-- "Wait, man, WHAT?!"

**-- "Yeah, there's like this guy outside your apartment staring down my car by his truck."**

\-- "Send me a picture."

As I waited for him to respond, I got another text from Rita.

**-- "Baby... You almost here?"**

This was also accompanied by a pouty face.

— “Hey babe, yeah I’m on my way.”

**— “Ok... get here soon. I’m rly excited!”**

She followed this with a cheerful emoji. I flipped back to Johnny’s text, waiting for him to respond. About three minutes passed, but there was no word from him.

— “Bro, is everything ok, hit me back!”

Nothing. I started typing again, telling him I was about to call the police when Rita started calling the phone.

“Hey baby, listen, I—“

“BABE!” She squealed excitedly. “Oh my god, I forgot to tell you, did you take a shower before you left?”

“U-uh... y-yeah.” I sighed and shook my head.

“Seeiously, look hon, I can’t talk right now. I’ll be at your place in two minutes okay?”

“Okay, but you DID shower?”

“Yes.” I sighed, exasperated.

“And you’re wearing something nice?”

“Yes, look, I promise, the boxes have all been checked, okay? I even used the fancy cologne you like, okay? Just, I need to hop off here. Somethings going on.”

“Okay...” I heard her say pitifully. “I *wuv* you...”

I sighed again and said “Yeah, yeah, I *wuv* you too. Look I *really* gotta—“

“I wuv you more!” She squealed like a child. Sighing in annoyance, in agitation, and in growing worry, I hung up with Rita and went back to texting Johnny.

“— “Look, I’m about to call the cops, I need you to send me a pic of the guy okay?”

Two minutes passed, nothing.

“— Yo, seriously, this shit ain’t funny, what’s going on?”

Three minutes pass. Nothing. Five minutes. Still nothing. The worst possible thoughts started rushing through my mind.

*What’s he taking about?! Who is the guy he’s talking about?! Oh God, what the fuck was he even doing, sitting outside my apartment?! How* ***long*** *has he been there?!* I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. *calm down Eddie, Ol boy...*

Admittedly, this probably *would’ve worked* and made me feel better, had I not been snapped back to reality by the blaring horn of the Honda Civic that was coming straight for me and about to spearhead my minivan. I managed to swerve out of the way just a microsecond before we collided. After that, I drove about another two and a half miles or so before pulling off to the side of the road and just stopping.

Both my heart and my brain were thumping. Pounding, like they were hammers against the head of a nail. The world around me was spinning, even causing my vision to cloud over and make everything look fuzzy. About another minute passed like this when my phone buzzed again. I looked to see it was from Johnny.

**-- "Hey man, everything's cool now. He left, sry for scaring you."**

I stared at the phone for a moment, dazed. *Huh?*

\-- "You sure? Have you checked around the back?"

**-- "Yeah. Not there. He's gone. Everything's fine."**

\-- "Okay... Well did he do or say anything?"

**-- "No."**

\-- "He just left? Just like that; just gives you the death glare for ten minutes and drives off?"

**-- "Guess so."**

\-- "'Kay, well did you get a good look at him? What'd he look like?

**-- "I don't know, look, you just go have fun with your girlfriend."**

This was followed by the "Cool" emoji (The one with the shades). Mentioning her caused me to look at the time. 3:30 P.M.

*Shit!* I thought, not realizing I'd somehow managed to lose another 20 minutes since stopping. Rita was gonna lose her ass at me when I showed up. *What the hell is she so excited about, though?*

That, despite everything else, believe it or not -- including the whole stalker outside my apartment situation, was still the biggest source of confusion for me. Two years, almost; that's how long Rita and I had been together and not *once* had she ever requested (far less *begged*) me to appear "nice" or professional like this. Now, before you try to start running your mouth about how she shouldn't *ever* HAVE to ask me to show up looking nice and clean, keep in mind that she *doesn't!* That's my point.

Showing up in nice, clean clothes and having showered and shaved if needed were things I'd *always* done just out of my own habits. Being honest, I didn't entirely think she'd even picked up on it. But like I said, it wasn't just that she was demanding me to appear squeaky clean that had me confused -- and perhaps a bit nervous, at least given the circumstances only seconds before.

She'd also never been *this* excited for a date before. Yeah, we had fun dates, but usually *I* was the overly hyped one while she'd be the one that was chill about it. Usually, I was the one planning our dates, not because I wouldn't have *let* her, but because she never really *wanted* to. Even when I'd ask what or where she wanted to go, she usually always said she was cool with whatever I wanted. Bottom line, I wasn't used to being up and surprised like this by *her.*

A welcome change -- at least at first -- but unexpected, regardless. What was she planning? *What the hell was going on with Johnny?*

In another minute and a half or so, I pulled up to Rita's house. I took a moment to try and gather myself and figure out some sort of an apology before I got out. Before I could set foot outside the car, however, I see her front door come open and out comes Rita, flying out like a bullet. In maybe three seconds flat, she'd cleared the front yard and seized me out of the car in a bear hug.

"Hey, Baby doll..." I said, startled.

"Hey babe!" she exclaimed excitedly. "I'm so glad you're here, come on, there's something I think you'll *love!*" I chuckled a bit nervously in reply.

"Okay, okay, just give me one second to turn off the car." She planted a wet kiss on my cheek before releasing me, allowing me to breathe a bit more freely. *Yep, she's definitely hyper here.*

*But  why?*

"Well make it quick, okay? Seriously, I can't wait to show you!" With that, she spun around and speed walked back into her house. I cut the van off before checking my phone again. Johnny still hadn't texted me anything after his last message.

*He's fine now, said so himself.* I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. *Everything's okay now, just have fun with Rita, like he said...*

I stopped.

*Like he said...*

For whatever reason, another feeling of unease crept from the pit of my stomach. Something about that wasn't sitting right with me. I wasn't sure, though, as to why. Something about the way he'd said it, maybe or just the sudden shift in tone from before.

*"Just go have fun with your girlfriend..."*

"Babe!" I heard from the front porch. Rita was standing on the porch, impatiently waving for me to come the fuck on already. My thoughts were derailed after that, so I decided to go ahead and get out, see what the hell she was so stoked about. As soon as I'd made the porch, Rita, giggling, took my hand and damn near ripped it off my shoulder, jerking me into the house.

"Whoa, babe, slow down." I said.

"Sorry, just, Oh my God, I've been looking forward to this!"

"To what?" Her smile faltered a bit.

"Babe, stop playing around..." She chuckled. I just kept looking at her. "Y-You mean you *actually* don't remember?"

"Remember *what?*" Her face fell away completely after that. Now she had a look of sheer disappointment.

"What the hell, how could you forget about today?!" she exclaimed. I began stammering, not at all knowing what to say.

"Rita, I-I'm sorry, look, can you please just tell me?" She sighed and crossed her arms. If you'd have seen the look on her face in that moment, you'd swear I just told her I'd stolen her grandmother's necklace or something and pawned it for cash.

"My Dad's in town. There, that jog your memory?" All at once, everything came back to me. She saw the way my eyes went wide with realization and and said "Uh huh, yeah, remember the convo from two weeks ago now?"

I sighed. "Yeah..." I rubbed my face and looked at her. I could tell this hurt her a good bit. Her dad was wasn't in town often and I remembered how she told me that when he *did* make the trip down here to Weeping Willow, N.C. from all the way up in Maine, he'd usually throw this sort of cookout with Rita and/or a few other members of the family if they were around, too. This time around, though, I could actually remember her telling me that she wanted only me there to meet her dad for the first time.

"Ah shit, Rit, I'm so sorry, fuck. I've been extremely busy lately and my memory's been shot all to shit because of it. Can you forgive me?" Her look of disappointment relaxed a bit.

"Well... You're here now, and you *do* look handsome." She winked at me, parting the left corner of her lip up.

"And I showered, like always." I added, giving her a wink of my own. Her excited grin from before returned full-blast and like that, I was having the shit squeezed out of me for a second time that day, completely off the hook. I was happy and, for the moment, I'd actually forgotten about whatever might've been going on earlier.

Rita led me into the kitchen where she had started cooking a pot of chili. "Alright!" I cheered. She chuckled. "Smells awesome, babe! Can I taste?" She winked, knowing how much I *love* her chili, and handed me the spoon. I took a small scoop before tasting it.

"Well, whatcha think?" she asked eagerly. I hesitated for a moment, contemplating.

"Not bad, but this ain't your usual recipe. I can tell you did something different."

"Yeah, so it's the recipe my mom always used to make for my dad. I used pulled pork and a little bit of chicken instead of the usual ground beef like I usually make. You like it?"

"I mean it's not my *favorite*, but it does have an interesting texture to it."

"To be honest, I'm not a *big* fan of it, myself, but Ma always used to make it. We didn't really get ground beef though, so she'd use pulled pork instead. We had plenty of that, given that he'd always bring hunks of it home from the butcher shop."

"Oh shit, that is right, I forgot you said your old man was a butcher. Didn't you say they used to call him 'Mr. Squeals'?" We both snickered at this.

"It was 'Mr. Squealer'." she added.

"Ahh. Well where is the old man, anyways?"

"He's on his way. He said he was picking up something special to bring for dinner tonight. He'll be here later on tonight."

"Awesome. I wonder what it is."

"Dunno, but he's *really* hyping it up. Says he wanted to do something *extra* special since he'd be meeting you for the first time."

I chuckled. "Huh, well, like I said, can't wait to see it. Hey, real quick, though, how come you wanted me over so early?"

"Huh?" She sat down the spoon she'd been using for the chili and looked at me.

"I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm always down for spending quality time with you, I'm just curious why you wanted me to come over when the old man wasn't even gonna be here yet."

"Hm, oh, well..." She handed me a pot and a spoon. "I was hoping you'd be willing to make some of that homemade jambalaya you made on our first date at your place. You remember that, right, Mr. Amnesia?"

I laughed and replied that I did. "I, uh, don't have any of the--" Before I could even finish that sentence, she held a finger up, stopping me and dashed off down the hallway. While she was gone, I felt my phone buzz again. This time it was from Johnny's girlfriend, Trista.

**-- "Hey, have you seen Johnny anywhere lately?"**

I was about to ignore this. I was with my girl, and while Rita and I had a good foundation of trust with one another -- enough to where we *don't* feel the need to look through each other's phones -- it still wasn't right to me. On top of that, Trista and Rita aren't exactly on great terms with each other, due in part to some sort of falling out they had a few years back just before she and I started dating, something she wouldn't talk to me about, strangely enough. But  at the same time, she HAD been asking about Johnny.

\-- "Has he not said anything to you?"

**-- "No, I haven't heard from him all day. I remember he told me the other day you and he were supposed to hang out today. That's why I thought he was with you."**

\-- "Yeah, no, I'm with Rita right now. I forgot I'd already made plans with her before I did with him. Have you tried calling him?"

**-- "Yeah, like I said, I've been trying all fucking day to get in touch with him because I was wondering if he and I could go out tomorrow since he was supposed to be with you today. He hasn't responded to any of the million calls or texts I've sent him though."**

I frowned at my phone. Something wasn't adding up here. If he wasn't with me, or at my apartment anymore, then why wasn't he answering any of Trista's texts? His phone was on, otherwise he wouldn't have been talking to me earlier. Though, that brings up the question, why isn't he *already* with her? He already knew I was with Rita... Didn't he?

*"... You just go have fun with your girlfriend."*

\-- "Okay, give me a sec, I'm gonna try getting in touch with him."

**-- "Okay, tell him to please call me back as soon as he can."**

I'd started texting Johnny, asking him where he was and why he wasn't answering Trista's texts when Rita came through with a grocery bag. "Hey, sorry about that, took me a minute to find. Really need to clean that room out a bit, huh?" She paused and asked "Everything okay, babe?"

I looked up from my phone. "Huh, oh yeah, no, everything's fine, I'm just trying to figure out if everything's going okay with Johnny, that's all."

"Did something happen?" I paused.

"I... I'm not sure." She cocked her eyebrows at me. "On my way here, he was texting me about someone watching him from outside my apartment." I showed her the texts from earlier.

"Well he seems fine from all this." she replied, pointing to the last text message.

"I know, I know, I just... Just wanna be sure, you know?" She grinned and pulled me in for a hug.

"You're a great friend, hon." She pulled away and said "But I seriously think you worry too much. Have you looked into that therapist I told you about the other day?"

"Yes." I groaned jokingly.

"I'm just saying, he *can* help. I would know." She winked and pointed to herself.

"Not sure I'd consider that as a credible mark on his reputation." I joked, grinning. She smirked and looked at me like "Yeah, I hear ya, wise-ass" before playfully slapping me on the shoulder. Like that, my anxiety situation about the whole situation with Johnny faded again. I'd honestly started wondering if Rita might not have had a point about me being too much of a worrier.

*He said he was fine, didn't he?*

*(But why isn't he answering his texts?)*

*He said to have fun with my girlfriend.*

*(But why isn't he answering the phone for his?)*

This slowly started to seep back into the back of my mind as I started making the Jambalaya while Rita kept stirring the chili. About twenty minutes passed and I was chopping up some of the porkchops I'd cooked to throw into the jambalaya when I saw the reflection of headlights pulling up into the driveway. Rita immediately dropped the spoon and jumped up and down, squealing like a little girl on her birthday. "Oh my gosh, he's *here!*"

Like a bolt of lightning, she was across the living room and throwing open the front door. In the doorway stood a 6'2" mountain with legs of a man, with arms that I'd be willing to bet would make a gorilla blush and a beard that'd make him fit right in with just about every biker bar in town. Rita threw her arms around his giant waist and squealed "Daddy, it's so good to see you! I've missed you SO much!"

Her father gave a deep, almost bellowing laugh while holding her close. "I've missed you too, my little 'Ms. Oinkers'." Rita giggled at that and did this little snorting thing. I have to admit, I found this to be absolutely adorable. Odd, but adorable.

He stepped in, having to duck down to miss the threshold, where he then saw me for the first time. He eyed me up and down for a second. From the way he was staring me down, I half expected him to burn holes in my forehead or something. Rita pulled away from him and said "Oh yeah, so Dad, this is my boyfriend, Eddie."

He exchanged glances between her and me. I simply stared back at him, frankly too frightened to really say anything. For a moment, he looked like he was about to strangle the life out of me before he let out a deep toned belly laugh. "Well, now, the boy respects his elders so much he can't speak. Either that or he's a mute."

Rita laughed and replied, "Oh no, that's just Eddie." She made her way back towards the kitchen.

"Well, I'll say one thing, the way he's lookin', if I didn't know no better, I'd say he was staring straight at a ghost or somethin'." He snickered again when he said this.

"I keep telling him he needs to loosen up a bit." Rita remarked, shouting from the kitchen behind me. "Isn't that right, hon?" I didn't answer. My mind was blank. I mean, you'd have had to be there to *really* get how overwhelming it was to be in front of this dude, this behemoth. He made his way in my direction and I couldn't help but shrink a bit with every step he made toward me.

"Hey, babe, you know the jambalaya's gonna burn, right?" That snapped my attention away from her father and I quickly scrambled back into the kitchen. Luckily, she caught me on that just in time, too, and I was able to keep it from burning.

"While he's doing that, you think you can help me set up the grill outside?" asked her dad.

"Sure, gimme just a sec." She turned the stove to a simmer and set it to cook before planting another kiss on my cheek and heading off. While stirring the Jambalaya, I watched the two from out of the living room window. I saw them reaching out and pulling out both the biggest smoker I'd ever seen -- like seriously, the damn thing could've been from an actual restaurant -- as well as a giant white sack that was spattered with blood.

*What the heck is that? Did he bring an entire pig with him? We having a pork-pull here?*

Right then, my phone went off again.

**-- "Has he said anything to you yet?"**

\-- "No, not yet."

**-- "Oh my God, I can't take this anymore! I'm scared here!"**

\-- "Calm down, okay, I'm sure he's just fine. His phone's probably just dead or something."

**-- "But He always tells me when his battery's about to die. Eddie, I seriously think something's wrong here. I'm gonna go to the cops."**

\-- "Hold on, let's just wait and see what he does by the end of the night."

**-- "Fuck that, I wanna know where he is! Look, like it or not, I'm calling the cops."**

I sighed. *God, and Rita calls ME the "Worrier". She should get a load of this.*

In spite of the annoyance, I will admit, it *was* a bit concerning to me as well that Johnny *still* hadn't tried getting back with Trista. I mean, sure, maybe he was trying to get a break from her -- she *was* almost always attached to him at the hip -- hence why he might've been wanting to hang with me that afternoon. Even still, though, I still hadn't entirely lost the feeling myself that something wasn't entirely right here.

I pulled up Johnny's number.

\-- "Hey, bro, look, Trista's really worried about you. She's been blowing up my phone and I'm with Rita -- and you know how THAT is. So if you could do me a solid and just hit her back, letting her know you're okay, that'd be awesome."

I hit "Send", only for it to tell me that the message couldn't go through. I frowned. I tried about three or four more times to make the message send before giving up. That's when I went back to Trista.

\-- "Hey, I just tried texting him again. I think his phone's dead or something. I can't get the message to go through."

**-- "I just called the police. They're looking for him now."**

\-- "Okay, well, if you see or hear anything from them or him, let me know. I'll keep an eye out."

**-- "Okay..."**

\-- "Hey, look, I'm telling you, it's gonna be okay. Johnny probably forgot to charge his phone or something. You know how he is, he's ALWAYS forgetting shit like this."

**-- "I know, I know... I just... I just care about him, you know? I can't help but feel like something's wrong, like he's in trouble."**

\-- "You know you're not his mom, right? XD"

**-- "Oh go fuck yourself. (Kidding... sorta) Look, I just have this feeling. I know that sounds crazy, but I do, I feel like something's happened."**

\-- "No, I get it. I really do. I sometimes get that way with Rita. I have to go, but seriously though, PLEASE try to relax, okay? Johnny'll turn up somewhere and will come back."

**-- "Okay. =)"**

I sat down the phone after that and went back to stirring the jambalaya. I turned and looked out of the window again. Outside, Rita and her father were attempting ton heave *whatever* the hell it was that was in that spattered ruck sack of theirs onto the big ass smoker. Looking down at the pot, I started to see that the jambalaya was almost finished, needing only to cook for another five or so minutes over medium heat. With that, I set aside the spoon and went out to see if I could try and help them out.

"Hey there, I thought I'd come and see what's what out here." They looked at me.

"You wanna be a smoke-y?" asked her father. I raised my eyebrows at him. Rita giggled.

"Oh dad," she said, giggling. She turned to me and said "That's what we used to call anyone who wanted to grill out with us." Her old man laughed.

"Well, I mean, I'm no George Foreman or anything, but..." Her father barked out another deep-toned belly laugh.

"George Foreman? Ha! I'd like to see his barbequing skills try to stand against mine."

"Oh no..." Rita said, pinching the bridge of her nose, "You got him started on this."

"Oh, I, uh... wasn't meaning any disrespect, sir, I just--"

"Son, you know, you *really* ought to take my daughter's advice and loosen up a bit. I'm just yankin' your chain here. Man-to Man." I looked to Rita. She just grinned shyly and shrugged. "Here," he tossed his keys to Rita and said, "There's a case of Lager in the passenger seat, why don't we crack open a couple?" He looked at me then and asked "Think that'll help, a little of the hair if that dog that's bitin' you in the ass?"

I shrugged and said "Uh, sure, why not?" Rita looked at me, raising her eyebrow. 

"You sure, hon?" 

"I mean why not?" I replied, chuckling nervously. 

"Well, you don't usually drink."

"Yeah, but your old man's here and all..." I gestured towards her father. Rita looked skeptical while her father barked another hearty laugh and said "Aw, come on now, let him loosen up a bit." Rita held up her hands, conceding before fetching the case of beers. 

She came back and the old man and I each cracked one open and held a toast before throwing 'em back. Now, Rita's skepticism wasn't out of place. I *wasn't* a drinker. At all. A fact that was pretty much painfully made clear when, as soon as the Lager touched my tongue, I damn near retched it all back up. Fortunately, I guess Rita's dad wasn't the type to want to make fun of me for "Not being able to hold my draught" or some stupid crap like that. Regardless, I was still enough of a bonehead to wanna not only finish the one I'd started, but ask for another. 

I'd started on the second one while he and Rita began to fire up the super smoker. They started trying to heave the big-ass sack onto the grill again and I stepped in to help them. I remembered wondering again just what the hell her old man had in this bag that was not only as big as this thing was, but as long and, frankly, as weirdly shaped as it was. What I mean by this was that, it was heavy enough, sure, whatever it was, but it didn't quite feel as dense as a hunk of beef or pork, you know? I don't know how else to describe it other than it didn't *feel* like what I figured it should've. 

When we laid it on the grill, I saw part of it get snagged, ripping a small hole in the fabric. Small as it may've been, it was enough to immediately make my blood freeze solid. In the sack, staring through the hole at me -- *literally* \-- was an *eye!* A fucking eye! Not like from an animal or anything, either. 

No, it was an aqua blue eyeball staring back at me, glazed and frozen in place with veins honeycombing the whites of it. What, or rather *whoever* this used to be, had obviously spent their last moments scared out of their minds. I looked at Rita's father and then to Rita herself. *What the fuck is going on here?! What is that, a person? Are they SERIOUSLY about to grill a fucking PERSON?!*

Rita's dad slammed the lid shut on the smoker. "Well, time for 'Ol' Smokey' here to work her magic. Get the meat all nice and hot before I add the seasonings." 

My stomach turned hearing him say that, "Seasonings". "See that's the trick here, son," he continued, wrapping his arm around my shoulder. I couldn't resist wanting to try shying away from his arm, but it was no use. "What they don't tell you about grillin', boy, is that it's best to wait till *after* the meat's gotten to be all sizzlin'. See, when you do it that way, you have a chance to *really* let all it's little internal juices mix together with the seasonings before you finish her off, you know what I'm sayin'?"

"Sort of like a built-in marinade so you don't have to worry about having to keep it sitting for days on end." Rita chimed in. Her father winked at her, grinning.

"That's my girl." Rita giggled at this. I remained frozen, staring horrified at the closed smoker. "Hon, what's wrong?" she asked. 

"Need another Lager?" her father asked, reaching into the cooler. 

"No!" I blurted. They both looked at me, puzzled. "I-I mean, no thanks, I think I've had enough beer. I think I'm gonna head inside, I need to check up on the Jambalaya anyway." They exchanged glances from each other and back to me while I stepped backwards toward the house. 

"You sure you're okay?" she asked. 

"Yeah, yeah, I just need to check on everything inside." I turned and hurried back into the house. My heart was pounding furiously. 

*Oh God, what am I gonna do?! That was a body in there! AND THEY'RE GONNA EAT IT!* I started scrambling for my phone. It was when I pulled up my text messages that it started coming back to me again. I looked outside, seeing Rita and her father standing beside the smoker with the truck. 

*Truck...* 

*-- "Yeah man, there's this dude outside your apartment staring down my car from his truck."*

*I asked him to send me a pic of the guy, but nothing ever came...*

*I waited for almost ten minutes...*

*-- "Yeah. Not there. He's gone. Everything's fine."*

*He said everything was fine...*

*He said to have have fun with my girlfri--*

That's when a tidal wave of sheer horror washed over me. This whole time, I'd been ignoring the one crucial aspect to this. He said to have fun with my girlfriend, not "Have fun with Rita", like he would've said any other time with like a sly wink emoji or something like that, like he would normally to tease me. Not only that... But, at least as far as I could remember, I'd never told him about my plans to hang with Rita that day, hence why he was at my place to begin with...

*Wait... but then, why was her father at my....*

I closed my eyes and began trying to remember any and every detail from the past week or so that might serve to explain what the fuck was going on. I started recollecting the conversation I'd had with Rita. I could remember her telling me that her father was coming into town, to which I'd replied that I'd already made plans to hang with Johnny that day. I remembered us getting into a huge fight about it, but we made up that night when I took her out to dinner and told her I'd bump off Johnny to hang with her. 

Obviously, though, I already mentioned how the whole "bumping off Johnny" part of the plan kinda slipped my mind. That still didn't explain why he was staking out my place though, until I started to consider that she may've sent him there. But why? Why would she want to send him to stalk me, unless...

Unless it wasn't *for me*...

I looked out toward Rita again. *Rita... Oh God, Rita must've sent her father after him and had him murdered and is about to serve him for dinner!* I pulled up Trista's number.

\-- "Trista! Listen to me, something's very wrong, you're right! I need you to call the cops to Rita's place, okay? Call in an anonymous tip about a body, and tell them to hurry!"

I hit send before I felt a hand on my shoulder. I whirled around to see Rita. She looked worried. "Baby, be honest with me, are you okay?"

I glanced back to the window and to her. "Y-Yeah... Yeah, no, everything's fine." She remained looking skeptical. "Seriously, everything's fine, I just... need to run to the bathroom real quick." I turned and quickly strode down the hall to the bathroom, where I then ended up actually retching into the commode. I started scrambling for my phone again when I realized I'd left it in the kitchen. 

*FUCK!* Now if anyone, say Trista for instance, were to text back, She'd be able to see it. *I have to get out of here.*

I started coming up with any number of excuses; upset stomach, nausea, need to pick up my cat from the vet, Hell, fuckin' *anything!* I just *HAD* to get out of there. Once I could, I'd be able to get the police to come, if Trista hadn't already gotten them on the horn. I heard a knock at the bathroom door. 

"Hey Babe, you okay in there?" Rita asked from the other side. I started making fake vomiting sounds. The knocking then became jiggling the handle. Fortunately, I'd thought to lock it beforehand. I could hear her jerking on the handle. "Hey, come on, open up!"

I faked even harder, louder vomiting sounds, but this only served to make Rita more determined to force the door open. Eventually, though, my worst fear was realized when I heard a **DING** from my phone. Right then, I jumped up from the commode. I could hear Rita moving away from the door. *Shit! I have to get to the phone before she does!*

I threw the door open before sprinting past her to the kitchen. I swiped up my phone and saw that it was a text from... From *Johnny...* 

**-- "Dude, I told you I was okay. Have fun with your girl, seriously. =)"**

"Eddie, What's going on?" I looked up from the phone to see Rita, staring at me wide-eyed and like she was ready to call the police on me. My body began to shake. 

*Oh God, what am I supposed to say to her?*

I looked outside. I could see the smoker going full-blast, but I couldn't see her father anymore. I knew the so-called text I'd just gotten from Johnny was a fake, just like the last one and so the fact that I couldn't see her father meant that he was obviously trying to hide it. I looked back at Rita again. 

"Well?" she urged, her own body starting to shake. She always did that when she became agitated, which meant I'd need to be careful about what I said and I'd need to get the fuck out of there quick. We were standing in the kitchen and the last thing I needed was for her to come at me with a knife. 

"Look," I began, sighing, "I'm sorry, okay? I don't know what's come over me. I think I just need to go home."

"But... But..." she stammered, her voice falling apart. Her body shook more violently now. I backed away into the kitchen. She stepped forward. "But why? My father *just* got here! I've been so excited for this, and first you forget, and now you wanna go home?!" Her voice escalated in pitch with each word she spoke. 

Soon, I was backed against the counter. I started groping behind me for anything I could use to possibly defend myself. She took two steps closer, her face redder than a cherry and twitching more violently than I'd ever seen before in my life. "If you're gonna be an asshole like this, can you at least tell me why?" She stomped the rest of the way to me. "Huh?!" she shrieked, "Tell me why!"

"Rita, stay back!" I exclaimed, managing to wrap my fingers around the hilt of a kitchen knife. She continued closing the distance between us. My hand stiffened around the knife. 

"Fuck you!" she screamed, lunging forward toward me. In a fluid motion, my arm thrusted forward and before I knew it, I looked up to see Rita's petrified eyes bulging out at me, gasping like a fish. The knife was embedded almost all the way to the hilt dead in the middle of her chest. My mouth fell open and I immediately withdrew the knife. Her body went limp and I caught her mid-fall. 

Blood flowed in a steady stream from the center of her chest. I held her for a moment, horrified at what I'd just done. *Oh Jesus, what am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do, I KILLED her!*

I shook my head. *It was self defense. It was self defense, and they killed your friend...*

My thoughts were cut short when I heard her dad walking in, announcing "Alrighty now, who's ready for some good eatin'? Tonight's menu, a nice hunk of fresh fox mea--" He froze then, seeing me on the floor, clutching his daughter's corpse. I stared back at him, frozen in shock. "What have you done?!" he shouted.

"I... I..."

"Get off her!" He stomped over to me. I moved away quickly. He then cradled Rita's body, shaking it and calling her name. Eventually, he devolved into a sobbing fit before raising back up, glaring at me. "YOU!" he screamed. "YOU DID THIS!" 

Panicking, I turned and ran. I cleared the front door, jumping over the front porch entirely. There, I jumped in my truck and sped off. I then drove for hours, not at all knowing where the hell I was gonna go. I was scared. I'd just murdered my girlfriend, and for what?

 I thought they'd killed and was about to serve my best friend to me for dinner. Except that it wasn't Johnny at all. *It was a fuckin' FOX!*

I remember I ended up stopping on the side of the road when it got to be around 2 AM. I didn't sleep that night, though, afraid of the possibility her dad might've been following me. When the sun rose, I decided to head back into town and turn myself in. 

From there, most of this is history. I confessed to murdering Rita and was taken into custody. The trial was about a month later. I forget honestly how long it went on for, but I remember it ended with me being initially sentenced to two years in psychiatric detention. That brings me to today. 

Today marks the first year since I've been here. I'd like to think I've been making progress here, but I can't lie, it's not feeling much like it. That's why the doctors have given me this tablet to write all of this out on for you all. Part of me still wants to think that I was right about Rita and her father, that they'd killed Johnny and were gonna barbeque him for dinner. But then I'll never forget the fact that Johnny was there, at the trial. 

Well, maybe... The way he was shaking, though, plus the way he kept looking toward Rita’s father, suggested otherwise, maybe some poor bastard that looked remarkably like him (though not entirely) that was suckered into taking the stand — not that it meant Jack-shit to the jury. 
He claimed he actually *had* been told that I'd be with Rita and that he didn't want to get in the way. 

I suppose it’s worth mentioning that, though her testimony was called into question, Trista never appeared. Why, well, because no one could find her. The text messages between me and her WERE reviewed, but it meant essentially nothing without her being there to back me. It’s also worth mentioning that I saw a missing person’s report in the paper a few days later, having last been sighted near Rita’s house the same day I’d left, just a few hours later. She’s never been found since and Johnny, or “Johnny” I guess, never attempted to contact me again. The last thing I’ll say about the whole thing, her father had the sack with him in the courtroom, dredged in more blood than I remembered from that day, as well as claw marks seemingly from the inside — as if somebody was trying to get out! 

It's funny, really, I guess, how convenient it is to forget things like that. What's even funnier, is that no matter what, though, true or not about that being a “fox” in that sack or my best friend’s body, I can't ever forget about Rita's homecoming dinner now...
