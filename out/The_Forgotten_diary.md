As I stumbled into the attic of my childhood home, I began searching for an old video game console. It wasn't long before I found a diary and thought not much of it, yet as I continued searching I became curios about what was in this diary, I fought off the urge to look at this mysterious diary, but as I continued searching for my console curiosity got the better of me. I decided that it wouldn't hurt to look inside, oh but boy was I wrong.

As I flipped the diary open I became very confused, as the diary had my name on it. I had never owned or written in a diary, but I decided I might have just forgotten about it. As I began turning the pages it was all normal stuff, but as I turned the pages more and more I noticed the room getting colder. I began noticing the hand writing getting messier and mor jagged.

After about 5 minutes of flipping pages I started becoming creeped out, as I Read

"Entry 27:

14 July 2003

It was today I met the man,

The man who stands in the corner of the room at night watching over me. He just appeared during the day, unlike himself. He is tall and lanky, but he's very skinny almost as if his bones are poking out of his skin. He doesn't speak but he has sharp teeth, I can tell by the bite marks in the wood of the closet door. He seems harmless but I can't tell, I didn't speak to him but we made eye contact.

JACOB"

I didn't remember writing this, but it was my handwriting. As I turned the pages it became worse and worse as I apparently encountered more entities. I was so consumed by this diary that I didn't notice the shadow in the corner. It was slowly getting closer, and when I noticed it I also noticed that I had been locked in the attic with this shadow figure and this diary, I didn't want to acknowledge this entity as I was afraid. As I finished reading the last entry I saw the entity hovering over me as if it were reading too.

From what I had read some entities were good and some bad, and this one seemed to be good. As I searched around for a way out of this attic I noticed the temperature dropping. I was beginning to see more things emerge from the dark when suddenly, "click" and the lights went off. I was terrified after what I had just read, and that's when I noticed the door to the attic had been opened by something after it was locked. I was the only person in the house since my parents died. At that point I couldn't leave this all up to my imagination.

As I got up to leave the thing from Entry 27 was behind me and I knew that when I felt the sharp teeth dig into my shoulder. I thought it wasn't dangerous as I hadn't stated so in my diary. The diary I never knew I had. I began sprinting and this thing let go. I made it to the attic door before realising that now that these things have come out I might still need the diary for information.

And so I as I ran I began recollecting thoughts and got myself bandaged up. I knew that this thing does not move as I stated in the diary so If I could get something to bring the diary close to me. I found an old broom and that did the job.

I then left the attic and as I got to the front door I tried to leave, but the town and street I used to know were gone. It was as if I were no longer in my normal plain of existence, but instead In the plain of the me that wrote the diary. When I looked through the opening there was my town and street but not as I knew it. Instead it was as if it had all aged a century. Houses and roads were cracked and moss covered. Vines grew everywhere and nature took over what once was hers.

I don't know how long I can  survive here with the limited supplies. If anyone can help me out of this plain, I'll do anything to be back home. To the home I can remember.
