Personally, I believe temptation is a fundamentally misunderstood concept. People *think* it’s a perilous state of indecision: will you give in to your baser instincts, or will you stay firm in your convictions?

What a load of moralistic, melodramatic bullshit.

For once in our lives, let's be honest: temptation is a made choice pending resolution. You’re going to give in - without question - it’s simply a matter of *when*. You’re just waiting for the right moment. We all are. In the meantime, it feels good to pretend like you're conflicted, like you *might* resist temptation when the time is ripe. I understand that. Pretending keeps the ego shiny and polished. But when push comes to shove, the righteous tug-of-war reveals a shameful truth: temptation is a facade, and it always has been.

So, be kind to yourself. Save some energy. Embrace the reality that, sooner or later, you’ll give in to your demons, whatever they may be.

I know I did.

***April 16th, 2025 - Morning***

I pressed myself against the microscope, but I wasn’t looking at the sample. While one eye feigned work, the other monitored the security camera stationed at the corner of the lab. My window of opportunity was slim: ten seconds, max.

Every morning, the dim red light below the camera’s lens would blink off - something about synchronizing the video feeds for the entire compound required the system to restart. That was the only time I wasn’t being watched. That was my window.

*I shouldn’t do it. It’s not safe. It’s not ethical.*

My focus shifted to the dab of gray oil squirming between the glass slides. I couldn't ever *see* it move: not directly, at least. Instead, I observed trapped air bubbles dilate and constrict in response to the liquid’s constant writhing, like a collage of eyeless pupils looking up through the opposite end of the microscope, examining me just as much as I was examining them.

The sight was goddamn unearthly.

Despite studying the sample day in and day out for months, I’d found myself no closer to unlocking its secrets. Tests were inconclusive. Theories were in short supply. Guess that’s why *CLM Pharmaceuticals* shipped me and my family halfway across the globe to begin with. And yet, despite my expertise, the questions remained.

*Why does the carbon-based, non-cellular grease move with purpose?*

*Why can’t the mass spectrometer identify all the elements that lie within - i.e., what’s the unidentifiable five percent?*

And, most pertinent to the discussion of temptation,

*Why in God’s name do I feel an insatiable compulsion to eat it?*

That last one was a more *personal* question. One I wasn’t getting paid an obscene amount of money to get to the bottom of.

I found myself lost in thought, vision split down the middle between the slide and the gleaming chrome surface of the lab table. When I realized I hadn't been paying attention, my available eye darted into the periphery, ocular scaffolding aching with strain, stretching the muscles to their absolute limit. I swallowed the discomfort. Didn’t want to move my head away from the microscope and make what I was doing obvious.

I saw the camera and gasped.

The light was off, but critically; I didn’t *watch* it turn off. How long had the feed been dead? One tenth of a second or nine? It was impossible to know.

Pins and needles swept down the arm I had resting on the table, closest to the specimen jar. My heartbeat painfully accelerated. I could practically feel my consciousness turning feral.

*Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.*

*Just a morsel.*

*One drop.*

Electrical impulses swam across my palm, but the directive was muddy, and it failed to mobilize the limb.

*Helen - you can’t risk losing this job. Get ahold of yourself.*

All the while, my right eye watched the tiny, lightless bulb.

I still had time.

***DO IT. DO IT.***

***DO.***

***IT.***

My mind spun and spun and spun, and, without warning, my hand shot up, animated like a jungle spider that’d been lying in wait for prey to stumble by. It dove into the specimen jar. I wasn’t used to feeling the oil on my bare skin: cold, but otherwise formless, like steam. I scooped a dollop onto my fingertips and brought it to my face. The sickly white light from the lab’s myriad of halogen bulbs twinkled against the substance. A pleasurable warmth radiated down my spine: the smoldering ecstasy of giving in to the temptation after defying the enigmatic impulse for weeks. I didn’t even wonder *why*. The *whys* could be dealt with later.

Then, I saw the camera’s light click on.

Panic exploded through my chest.

I didn’t think. I didn’t have *time* to think.

I shoved my oil-stained hand into my jeans pocket and brought my eye back to the microscope with as much nonchalance as I could muster.

*Surely they saw me. I’m going to be fired, or worse. It’s all over.*

As I tried to contain my blistering anxiety, the bubbles trapped between the slides shuttered, some growing larger, some contracting, all in response to the oil’s imperceptible movement.

An audience of unblinking eyes, silently watching me crumble.

***April 16th, 2025 - Evening***

I sped home from the compound. Distracted, I nearly collided with a truck on the interstate going ninety miles-an-hour. The man and his blaring horn saved my life, undeniably, but all I could offer my savior was a limp, half-hearted “*sorry about that!”* wave. A few adrenaline-soaked seconds later, my eyes drifted back to my phone. I flicked my wrist across the screen, continuously refreshing my emails. A correspondence detailing my indiscretion felt imminent. Completely, helplessly inevitable.

Nothing yet, though.

Linda and the kids were thankfully out when I careened into the driveway. I didn’t want them to see me like this. Moreover, I didn’t have the mental reserves to withstand an impromptu interrogation from my wife. Any deviation from the norm was a candidate for investigation after the affair. A homogenized version of myself was the only one that could exist unmonitored.

*\*Relatively* unmonitored: that's a better way to phrase it.

I paced across the chalky cobblestone pathway and threw myself against the front door without remembering to unlock it first. My shoulder throbbed as I steadied my shaking hand, inserting the key on the fourth attempt. The door swung open, and I stomped inside.

I threw my keys at the key bowl aside the frame but missed it by a mile, going wide and landing in the living room, metal clattering against the parquet flooring as it slowed to a stop. I barely noticed. My fingers were busy unfastening my jeans. It didn’t feel like a *great* plan - throwing out a potential biohazard with the apple cores and the junk mail - but it’d do in a pinch.

*Before I trash them, though, I could flip out the pockets and suck the oil from the fabric.*

My priorities underwent a fulcrum shift.

From the moment I’d been caught - or very nearly been caught, it was still unclear - I’d fixated on the potential consequences. My contract with *CLM Pharmaceuticals* was entirely under the table. The sample I’d been hired to research was a tightly guarded secret: something those at the top would kill to keep under wraps and out of the hands of their competitors, no doubt about it.

At that point, though, the possibly fatal ramifications couldn’t have been further from my mind.

*Maybe I’ll finally get a chance to taste it.* \- I thought.

I yanked the jeans from my calves, folded them haphazardly, cradled them in my armpit and sprinted to our first-floor bathroom.

*Maybe I’ll finally understand why I care.*

Rubber gloves squished over my hands. I ripped a few sheets from a nearby paper towel roll and placed them gently beside the sink. The precautions were unnecessary, but they made me feel less rash. I set the jeans down on the makeshift workbench with reverence and took a deep breath. As I exhaled, my hand burrowed into the pocket and pulled the material taut.

My wild excitement curdled in the blink of an eye. After a pause, I pulled out the other pocket. It didn’t make an ounce of sense.

Both were dry. I saw a few specks of lint, but no oil.

I stumbled back, reeling. The sensation of my shoulders crashing into the wall caused my gaze to flick upward reflexively. I cocked my head at my reflection in the bathroom mirror.

At first, I thought it was just a drop of spittle hanging from the corner of my mouth, a liquid testament to my feverish desire. Before I could diagnose myself as clinically rabid, however, I watched the droplet slowly wriggle like a sleepy maggot. That’s when I noted the color.

Gray-tinged.

Without fanfare or ceremony, the liquid squeezed itself between my closed lips and disappeared into my mouth.

Immediately, my tongue scoured its surroundings - ran the length of every gumline, slinked across every tooth and over the entire canvas of my hard palate - but I tasted nothing.

Robotically, I pulled the glove off my right hand and dragged my fingertips over my cheek, on the same side that’d first noticed the “spittle”. There was a strip of skin inline with the corner of my mouth that felt perceptibly colder than its neighboring flesh.

Guess the oil was just as eager to be eaten as I was eager to eat it.

Scaled me like a goddamned mountain.

The muffled thumps of Linda and the kids arriving home radiated through the walls. I sighed, sliding my jeans back on. Strangely, I didn’t experience fear or panic.

Instead, I felt a profound disappointment.

*In the end, the oil didn’t taste like anything, and I don’t feel any different.*

Linda knocked on the bathroom door with a familiar, nagging urgency as the kids trampled by.

*“Helen, honey, what’s going on? Why in God’s name are your keys on the floor?”*

***April 24th - Early Morning***

I lied awake for hours each night. Sleep had been scarce since I ingested the oil. I’d found myself consumed with worry. The exhaustion was starting to really take its toll, too: I felt myself becoming disturbingly forgetful.

The clock ticked from 4:29 to 4:30AM, and it was time to begin my new morning routine.

Sunday night, I’d set my phone alarm for 4:30 AM and slip it under my pillow. When morning came, it didn't ring; it vibrated. The kids and the wife slept lightly, and our cramped city apartment had walls thinner than paper. They appreciated the lack of a proverbial air-raid siren wailing at the crack of dawn, though I’d be lying if I said the device convulsing against my head was a pleasant way to be yanked from the depths of R.E.M. sleep.

Once I silenced the contemptible thing, I’d drag myself out of bed as quietly as my groggy limbs would allow. From there, I’d jump into meditation. Wearily, I might add. It was a daily activity, but I didn’t do it by choice. No, it was a company mandate. I laughed when my boss explained the requirement. Prioritizing employee *“wellness”* is big right now, I understand that, but does a chemist really *need* to meditate?

*“Yes.”* he replied. The Executive had a wide, almost goofy smile.

*“Well…I suppose you won’t know for sure whether I comply. Unless y’all have some sort of chakra analyzer as part of my security clearance?”* I chuckled and nudged the man’s shoulder playfully.

His body stiffened. His pupils narrowed like the focusing of a target reticle. The temperature in his office seemed to plummet inexplicably. Objectively, I knew the air hadn’t been sapped of warmth. Still, I struggled to suppress a chill.

*“Trust me, Helen - we’ll know.”*

The smile never left his face.

Needless to say, I spent an hour each morning clearing my mind, precisely as instructed. Told myself I was complying on account of how well the position paid. Didn’t want to *rock the boat* and all that. My motivation, if I’m being honest, though, was much less rational. So there I’d be, ass uncomfortably planted on the flip-side of our doormat-turned-yogamat, cross-legged and motionless, a barbershop quartet of herniated discs singing their agonizing refrain in the small of my back, impatiently waiting for my phone to buzz, indicating I was done for the morning.

I always resisted the meditation, but it’d become easier after ingesting the oil. More intuitive. I slipped into a state of emptiness with relatively little effort.

That said, I began to experience a massive head rush whenever I was done. Felt like my head was tense with blood, almost to the point of rupture. The sensation only lasted for a minute or so, but during that time, I felt… I don't know, detached? Gripped by a sort of metaphysical drowsiness? It’s hard to explain. All the while, a bevy of strange questions floated through my bloated skull.

*Who am I? Where am I? -* and most bizarrely - *Why am I?*

As I recovered, I’d hear something, too. Every time, without fail, there would be a distant *thump*.

Like someone was quietly closing our front door from the inside.

*They don’t want me to hear them leave* \- I'd think.

But I'd have no earthly idea who I thought *they* were.

\- - - - -

***May 10th - Afternoon***

I knocked on the door of the compound’s security office. Jim’s gruff, phlegm-steeped voice responded.

*“It’s open, damnit…”*

The stout, sweaty man grined as I enter: whether the expression was related to my presence or the box of local pastries was unclear, but, ultimately, irrelevant. I’d been worming my way into his good graces for almost a month.

*Today's the big day* \- I thought.

*“Care for a croissant?”*

He reached his grubby paw towards the box. I sat in an empty, weathered rolling chair next to him and flipped open the lid. The dull gleam of the monitor wall reflected off the non-descript, shield-shaped badge tethered to his breast pocket. We shot the shit for a grueling few minutes - reviewing hockey statistics and his takes on the current geopolitical landscape - before I felt empowered to the ask the question that’d been burning a hole in my throat for weeks.

*“Say, Jim - I think the camera in my lab may be on the fritz. The bulb below the lens flicks off sometimes, like its rebooting or freezing or something, though I heard it might be a normal part of the video system, synchronizing the feeds for the whole compound. What do you think? Don’t want anyone questioning my work because the monitoring has interruptions…”*

He chuckled. A meteor shower of half-chewed crumbs erupted from his lips and on to his collar.

*“Christ, Helen, you’ve got one hell of an eagle eye. Glad ya asked me instead of Phil, though. He’s too green. Hasn’t been around as long as I have.”*

He swallowed and it seemed to take a considerable amount of effort. Too big of a bite or the machinery of his neck was prone to malfunction. Maybe both.

*“Don’t repeat this, OK? A few years ago, we had a problem with the cafeteria staff. Employees lifting silverware and other small valuables. They were careful, though. We couldn’t pinpoint who was responsible. Couldn’t catch anyone in the act, either. That’s when upper management approached me with an idea. We programmed those lights to periodically turn off. People started gettin’ the impression that the cameras were briefly inactive, even though they weren’t. Emboldened the thieves right quick. Made them slip up within days. Worked so well that we never de-programmed the flickering.”*

Beads of sweat dripped down my temples.

*“Oh…I see….”*

*“Synchronizing the feeds…”* he repeated, still chuckling. *“Where the hell did ya hear that?”*

I paused and searched my memories, but found nothing.

*“Ha…I’m not sure…”*

God, why couldn’t I remember?

*"We're always watching, my dear. Remember that."*

Jim winked at me, and I paced from his office without saying another word.

\- - - - -

***May 22nd - Evening***

I sat up, propping my shoulder blades against the bed frame. My eyes scanned the homemade flashcard. The question wasn’t difficult, and I’d practiced it five minutes earlier.

*When was your first day at CLM Pharmaceuticals?*

*“March 21st”* I whispered.

I flipped the card. The words *“March 8th”* were scribbled on the reverse side.

*“Fuck!"*

The expletive came out sharper than intended. Linda’s head popped over the door frame. I had always liked the way her blonde curls danced on her shoulders, but I couldn’t stand the sight of the graying strands buried within. The color was a pollutant. It matched the oil to a tee.

Made me want to cut the follicles from her skull and swallow them whole.

*“What’s the matter, sweetheart?”* she cooed.

I pulled the next card in the pile, outright refusing to meet her gaze.

*“Nothing.”* I muttered.

*How many children do you have? -* the question read.

*Easy, three.*

With a noticeable trepidation, I flipped to the answer.

The number written on the opposite side wrapped its torso around my heart and squeezed.

*One.*

*“Are you sure you’re alright?”* Linda reiterated.

My eyes, violent with misdirected anger, shot up.

She was smiling at me. I blinked.

No, her expression was neutral.

It took everything I had to suppress the hellfire coursing through my veins. I closed my eyes.

*“Linda, don’t you have something better to do than just…fucking…watch me? You know, like live your fucking life?”* I scowled.

When I opened my eyes, her smile was back. Wide. Tooth-filled. Rows and rows of sharp pearls that seemed to extend far back in her mouth and down her throat.

*"What the hell is wrong with you?"* I whispered.

Starting with the bulb farthest from the bedroom, the hallway lights behind her flicked off. One by one, the squares of light disappeared. A wall of impenetrable darkness steadily crept forward.

*Click. Click. Click.*

Finally, the bulb above Linda fizzled. She didn’t move. She didn’t react. She just kept smiling - even through the darkness, I could tell she was still smiling.

There was a pause. Instinctively, I pulled out the next flashcard.

The question was familiar. It was even in my handwriting. That said, I didn’t recall writing it.

*Why does the carbon-based, non-cellular grease move with purpose?*

The answer sprinted to the tip of my tongue.

*“Because it wants to be whole,”* I whispered.

I flipped the card.

The letters were rough and craggy, like whoever wrote them did so with an exceptional amount of pressure.

***Because it wants to be whole***

Hands trembling, I continued to the last question in the pile.

“*Why can’t the mass spectrometer identify all the elements that lie within - i.e., what’s the unidentifiable five percent?”*

I didn’t know. As soon as I flipped the card, the bedroom light clicked off.

A wave of silent black ink washed over me.

*“Linda…what’s….what’s happening…”* I whimpered.

Another pause. My body throbbed. My mind spasmed.

*“Oh, Helen…”* she said.

*“Let me show you.”*

A tiny red glow appeared across the room, along with the sound of a tiny mechanical click.

Her front two, semi-transparent teeth emitted the crimson light.

Slowly, my gaze traveled upward.

The reflective lens of a security camera, elongated to the size of a dinner plate, had replaced the top half of her face.

God, I didn’t want to, but I forced my eyes away from her and to the answer I held in my hands.

Deep shadows made it impossible to read.

As I tilted it towards Linda’s glow, however, it started to become legible.

Right as I was about to read it, my phone buzzed, and my eyelids exploded open.

I was sitting on the floor of my bedroom. The melody of Linda softly snoring encircled me.

I’d been meditating. At least, it seemed that way at the time.

The belief was just another facade, however.

Another lie for the pile.

Another temptation obliged.
