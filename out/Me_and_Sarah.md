The morning Sarah opened her eyes for the first time in months, I wept with joy. Her lashes fluttered against her cheeks—those same cheeks I'd been moisturizing twice daily to keep them soft—and when her gaze finally focused on my face, I saw recognition bloom there like spring flowers.

"There you are," I whispered, stroking her forehead. "Welcome back, sweetheart."

Her mouth moved, trying to form words. Nothing came out yet, but that was okay. Dr. Morrison had warned me it would take time. The important thing was that she was awake, that she was trying. After everything we'd been through together, every setback and small victory, we'd finally reached this milestone.

I'd prepared her favorite breakfast—scrambled eggs, soft and buttery, easy to swallow. I'd been studying her old journals, the ones from before, learning everything about her preferences. The egg recipe came from an entry dated three years ago: "Made the BEST scrambled eggs today—lots of butter, pinch of cream, barely cooked. Heaven!"

"Open up," I cooed, bringing the spoon to her lips. She hesitated, and I saw the confusion in her eyes. "It's okay, baby. You're safe now. Everything is exactly how it should be."

The eggs slid past her lips, and I watched her throat work as she swallowed. Pride swelled in my chest. She was doing so well.

I'd converted the spare bedroom into her recovery space months ago, right after I'd brought her home. The walls were painted her favorite shade of pale yellow—I'd found the paint chip she'd saved in one of her Pinterest boards. Sunlight streamed through the large window, which I kept sparkling clean so she could watch the oak tree outside. Sometimes birds landed on the branches, and I'd narrate their activities for her.

"You're going to love it here," I told her as I wiped a bit of egg from her chin. "I've thought of everything."

The feeding took forty-five minutes, but I didn't mind. I had nowhere else to be, nothing more important than this. Than her. I'd rearranged my entire life around Sarah's care, and it was the best decision I'd ever made. Purpose. That's what she gave me.

After breakfast came medications—a rainbow of pills that Dr. Morrison prescribed during our video consultations. I'd crush them into applesauce, making sure everything went down smoothly. Sarah's eyes tracked my movements now, following the spoon, watching my face. Such progress from those first weeks when she'd barely responded at all.

"Physical therapy time," I announced cheerfully, pulling back her covers.

Her body had changed so much under my care. Where she'd been thin before—too thin, really, from all that stress and running around—she'd filled out beautifully. I made sure she got proper nutrition now, the right number of calories. Her muscle tone was different too, softer, more relaxed. All that tension she used to carry had melted away.

I began with her fingers, gently flexing each joint. "One, two, three," I counted, massaging the muscles. Her hands were so delicate in mine, so dependent. It made my heart sing.

The old Sarah had been so independent, so busy, always rushing off somewhere. Work, friends, errands—she'd barely had time to breathe, let alone be present in the moment. I used to watch her from my apartment window, across the courtyard, observing how she'd practically run to her car every morning, coffee sloshing in her travel mug, phone wedged between her shoulder and ear.

She'd needed saving from that life. She just hadn't known it.

Working my way up her arms, I chatted about my plans for the day. "I thought we'd do a face mask this afternoon. The lavender one you loved—well, that you pinned on your 'Self-Care Sunday' board. And I downloaded those meditation recordings you bookmarked. We'll listen together."

Her eyes widened slightly. I chose to interpret it as excitement.

The physical therapy session lasted an hour. I moved through the exercises Dr. Morrison had outlined, supporting her limbs, encouraging each small movement. When her leg twitched—just a tiny spasm, but still—I gasped with delight.

"Did you feel that? You're getting stronger every day!"

Bath time was my favorite part of our routine. I'd fill the tub with warm water, add the rose-scented bubbles she used to buy from that expensive boutique downtown. I still had her credit card, used it for all her purchases. She'd want me to maintain her standards.

I undressed her carefully, noting how peaceful she looked. None of that frenetic energy from before. She'd been so wound up back then, so anxious. Her old therapist notes (I'd found them in a box under her bed) talked about her insomnia, her racing thoughts, her inability to relax. 

Not anymore.

Lifting her into the tub required strength I'd built up over these months. She was dead weight in my arms—not dead, no, that was the wrong phrase. She was \*relaxed\* weight. Peaceful weight. I lowered her gently into the water, supporting her head with a bath pillow.

"Doesn't that feel nice?" I asked, soaping a washcloth.

I bathed every inch of her with loving attention. Her body was mine to care for now, mine to maintain. The responsibility thrilled me. I washed her hair with the expensive shampoo she loved, massaged her scalp, rinsed carefully so no soap got in her eyes. Her hair had grown longer under my care—I trimmed it sometimes, just the ends, keeping it healthy.

She made a sound, a small noise from the back of her throat.

"What is it, sweetheart? Are you trying to talk?" I leaned closer, my ear near her mouth.

The sound came again, wordless but meaningful. She was really trying now.

"That's it," I encouraged. "You're doing so well. Dr. Morrison said the vocal exercises would help. We'll practice more today."

After her bath, I dried her thoroughly—moisture could lead to bedsores, and I refused to let her skin be anything less than perfect. I applied lotion to every inch of her, the vanilla-scented kind she used to use. I knew because I'd watched her routine through her bathroom window during those early days of our connection, when she didn't know I existed.

But now she knew. Now she understood.

I dressed her in one of her favorite soft nightgowns, the blue one with lace at the collar. She'd worn it in a selfie from two years ago, captioned "Cozy vibes." I'd saved all her photos, studied them, learned everything about her.

Settling her back in bed, I propped her up with pillows so she could "watch" while I showed her my latest surprise.

"Look what came today!" I held up the package. "That sweater you had in your cart forever but never bought. I got it for you! Well, you got it for yourself, technically. But I made it happen."

I pulled the soft cashmere over my shoulders. "It fits perfectly. I'll take such good care of it until you're ready to wear it yourself."

Her eyes followed the sweater, and I swore I saw something in them. Recognition? Appreciation? Maybe even love?

"I know you're grateful," I said, sitting beside her bed and taking her hand. "You don't have to say it. I can feel it."

The afternoon sun painted golden squares across her bedspread. I'd positioned her bed for optimal light—not too harsh, but bright enough to maintain a healthy circadian rhythm. Dr. Morrison had emphasized the importance of that.

"Storytime," I announced, pulling out her Kindle. I'd charged it, organized her library, started working through her 'to be read' list. "We're on chapter twelve of that romance novel you downloaded. Remember? The duke and the governess?"

I read aloud, doing different voices for the characters, pausing at the good parts to gauge her reaction. When I reached the love scene, I glanced at her face.

"Steamy, right?" I giggled. "The old you would have blushed."

The old you. The phrase hung in the air between us.

But the old Sarah was gone. This Sarah—my Sarah—was so much better. She was present. She was here, completely here, not scattered across a dozen obligations and worries. She had no choice but to be in the moment, to accept the care I provided, to depend on me entirely.

It was beautiful.

For dinner, I pureed pot roast with vegetables, another recipe from her journals. I fed her slowly, making sure each spoonful was the right temperature. She swallowed mechanically now, a reflex she'd relearned. Such progress.

"Your mom called again today," I mentioned casually. "Left another voicemail. I listened to it on your phone—she's worried because you haven't called back. I texted her from your number: 'Taking a break from everything to focus on myself. Need space. Love you.'" I smiled. "She responded with a heart emoji. See? Everyone understands you need this time."

I'd handled all of Sarah's communications since bringing her home. Her boss had been trickier—I'd had to actually quit her job via email, citing a family emergency and immediate relocation. But I'd managed it. I'd managed everything.

"Your rent was due, so I paid it from your account. Kept the lease active in case anyone got suspicious about you 'moving' without a paper trail. But you're not going back there. That cramped little apartment with the noisy neighbors? You're so much better off here with me."

After dinner, I brushed her teeth, flossed carefully, used the mouthwash. Her dental hygiene was impeccable under my care. Then came the evening medications, the ones that kept her calm and comfortable.

"Dr. Morrison increased your dosage," I said, crushing the pills. "He agrees you're ready for the next phase of treatment. Soon you'll be moving even more. Talking, maybe. Won't that be wonderful?"

I tucked her in as the sun set, drawing the curtains, turning on the soft nightlight I'd bought—shaped like a moon, just like the one in her childhood bedroom photos I'd found in her cloud storage.

"Goodnight, my love," I whispered, kissing her forehead.

She blinked up at me, and in her eyes, I saw... something. Fear? No, that couldn't be right. She was safe here. Protected. Loved more deeply than she'd ever been loved before.

"I know you're happy," I told her, stroking her cheek. "I can tell. Tomorrow we'll have an even better day. Every day gets better and better."

I kept the baby monitor on as I went to my room—the master bedroom, which used to be hers before I'd moved into her house. I'd sleep with one ear tuned to her breathing, ready to rush to her side if she needed me.

Lying in her bed, surrounded by her things, wearing her clothes, I felt complete.

Sarah needed me. Sarah was mine to care for, mine to love, mine to keep.

And she was never leaving.

Through the monitor, I heard her make that sound again—the wordless noise from deep in her throat. It almost sounded like crying, but that was impossible.

She was happy now.

I'd made sure of it.
