The dark never scared me. Many other things did – unopened bills, social gatherings. Commitment, according to my ex. But the dark never held any particular terrors for me. Sure, your senses are heightened; I guess it’s some kind of evolutionary thing. Sometimes you even see things that aren’t there. When I was in the service, during basic training, the brass decided to teach us a lesson about sleep deprivation. I was three or four days into the maneuvers, on about as many hours of sleep, doing sentry duty in the middle of a dark forest. Suddenly I saw a figure standing a few yards away, completely still, just watching me. I told him to halt and identify himself, but there was no response. For several minutes I was locked in a battle of will with what I eventually realized was the stump of a fallen tree. Naturally, I felt like a complete idiot, but when I told the others about it, they had – practically to a man – experienced something similar.

 

But then there are those special places. I swear, I’m not superstitious or anything. I don’t believe in ghosts, but some houses, some floors, some rooms – you walk in and you feel this evil presence, like the place is haunted, and you just want to get the hell out of there.

 

The training room was one of those places.

 

…

 

That Tuesday, I arrived at work at ten to ten. I liked to get there a little early; that way whoever was on the evening shift had time to change and pass on any messages, without having to rush. That night, there was nothing special to report. Paul was a bit younger than me, studying law or something and working part time, which meant that he would probably be gone in a year or two. Like the other guys, he loved working here. As a security guard at a nursing school, there were always opportunities to socialize with the students, ninety percent of whom were female: helping a damsel in distress who had locked herself out of her room, returning property from the lost-and-found to grateful students, or just having a chat in the hallways or courtyards, trying, with varying degrees of success, to stay within the bounds of professional conduct. There may also have been occasional use of the video surveillance system that wasn’t strictly up to code; that’s not for me to say.

 

Me, I preferred the night shift, when there was minimal client contact. I’d bring a book to read, have a bit to eat, and when it was time to make the rounds, that was little more than a welcome opportunity to stretch my legs. Most of all it was the quiet of the place that appealed to me – this place that was bustling in the daytime, now completely dead and deserted, with me wandering around like the last man on earth.

 

The path I had taken to end up in this line of work was probably different from most. From an early age, I had imagined myself as an academic. I did all the right things: got good grades, secured the funding, was accepted into a top school – my dad’s alma mater. Then my dad died, and nothing seemed worthwhile anymore. I didn’t open a book for months. I showed up for the first exam, took a quick look at the page, and nothing made sense. It wasn’t that I didn’t understand the questions; I could probably have bullshitted my way through it and pulled off a passing grade. But it all just seemed so meaningless, like nothing had any relation to anything at all in the world I knew. I stood up and walked out, and never came back.

 

I think others cared more than I did; people talked of wasted talent, low-earning jobs, uncertain future. I was just happy to be left alone, free from any pressure or responsibility, disposing of my own time the way I wanted. I had been dating a girl in college for a few weeks. We promised each other we would give it a try, but I think we both knew it wouldn’t work, and we soon drifted apart. More freedom, fewer obligations.

 

Once Paul had gone, I popped my dinner (or should I say breakfast?) in the microwave and got my book out – an old M.R. James I had picked up at an antiquarian. After a couple of hours, I decided it was time to do the rounds. I got the phone, the keys and the flashlight, locked up the office and went outside. It was a clear, cold night; there was no moon, so the stars were out in numbers. The snow that had fallen the day before had congealed into a thin layer of frost, so the ground gave off a crisp crunch for each step.

 

I followed the perimeter of the school, checking doors and windows. The building was an old red-brick one, built in the nineteenth century. It consisted of a tall central tower-like structure, flanked by two lower wings. It had been a hospital before St. Luke was built on the outskirts of town in the 1960s, at which point it was turned into a nursing school. After I had done an outside control of the residential buildings, a few minutes away, I came back for the interior check. Though the school looked old and traditional from the outside, the inside had been renovated quite recently, and the staff and students had all modern facilities at their disposal.

 

We were not really supposed to, but I always took the elevator to the top floor. I knew I would be in big trouble if I got stuck, but fortunately there had been no problems so far. From the top I made my way downwards, making sure the building was in fact empty, turning off any lights, projectors, coffee machines and so on. Below the ground level there were two more basement floors, and once I was done with what was called U2, the rounds were over. This last floor consisted of a long corridor, with doors leading to rooms mostly used for storage, or offices and locker rooms for the janitorial and cleaning staff. Then, at the end of the corridor, was the training room.

 

Rumor had it this was where the most irredeemable mental patients had been held: the violent, the criminally insane. Here they were strapped to their beds, screams muffled by thick walls, dead to the world. There was also talk of hauntings – tormented spirits unable to leave their place of last repose behind. Be that as it may, once the building became a school, it had been transformed into a room with dummies in two rows of hospital beds lining the walls. Here the students could practice their skills – anything from bedside manners to CPR or the administering of medications – under the supervision of their instructors and without any grave consequences should they make mistakes. There were of course no windows down here, and the atmosphere was somber under the fluorescent lights. To lighten the mood, perhaps, they had installed a giant, lit-up smiley symbol on the far wall. To me though, this was the creepiest thing of all; the big yellow face like a deranged, all-seeing deity, cheerfully surveying its domain of tortured captives. The dummies’ mouths were open as if in screams of soundless agony, their eyes and ears closed so they would never know when their next punishment were to commence.

 

As always, I wanted to get out as soon as possible, but as I was heading for the door, out of the corner of my eye, I thought I registered movement. Had one of the dummies moved? Was I losing my nerve down here? Or my mind? It was probably just time to get back to the office and put on some coffee. I turned to my right and everything was still, but something was off nevertheless. As I walked up to one of the dummies, it seemed different; instead of the dumb, gaping rubber mask, it seemed to have a real, human face. Not just any face, it seemed to me, but my own face, only bruised and infinitely sad. As I stared, I remembered exactly where and when I had seen that face before.

 

It was my first year in college, and I was going home for Christmas. My dad had picked me up from the airport, and I was driving. It was the same Volvo station wagon we’d had since I was a kid, the one I had learned to drive in. My dad was very fond of that car, and refused to trade it in no matter how old and ramshackle it got. Outside, the windshield wipers were working frantically to keep the snow off. As so often during that period, we were arguing. I had decided to major in English Lit, and he was concerned I might regret it. Thinking back now, I can easily see it from his side: he had grown up in poverty and gone on to get a degree in engineering. Through hard work, he had managed to secure a good life for himself and for us, his family. That was what education was to him: an insurance against want and uncertainty. He was never condescending or angry; his concern came from love. Back then, however, I didn’t see it that way. I had been a reader all my life, and all I wanted was to work with books: to teach, perhaps to write myself. When someone questioned my choices, I took it as an attack on my integrity. The discussion soon grew heated; I got angry and defensive, yelled at him to mind his own business and leave me alone. That’s when, a little too late, I saw the trailer overtaking another car, coming towards us in our lane. I swerved and lost control of the car. Dad didn’t make it; I got away with minor injuries. With a bruised face I lay staring vacantly ahead of me in the hospital bed, hearing the frantic voices of my family down the corridor, like sounds from a detuned radio.

 

I snapped out of it. This dummy, it was probably nothing but an elaborate prank by the others; it wouldn’t be the first time. Once we put a skeleton from the anatomy room in the driver’s seat of Paul’s car. He freaked out completely, and we got it all on video – it was glorious. Was this him getting his revenge? I went over to the bed to have a closer look. It was certainly still a dummy; the back of its head was smooth and rubbery, and there were small gaps where the joints would be. Nor had a mask been strapped on to the head. Was the face painted on to the rubber? If so, it was eerily realistic. I had the sensation of looking into a distorted mirror. Not able to contain myself, I reached out a hand to touch it.

 

Just then, it turned its head and looked me dead in the eye, while it lifted up the covers to put its feet on the ground.

 

I ran like a madman, shuffling my feet on the polished linoleum floor. It felt like running in a nightmare, where my legs would not follow my commands and barely moved in spite of all my efforts. Behind me I thought I heard footsteps, like rubber soles on the floor of a quiet library. Out the door I ran, down the long corridor, where in the end I could see the light coming out of the elevator. Reaching it I stumbled inside, and as the doors closed behind me I heard a sickening thud.

 

It was the lights going out. I was now in complete darkness, and the thundering sound of my heart seemed to fill the small room. I reached out trying to find the control panel, but there was something in front of me; something soft and hard at the same time. Suddenly I remembered that I had my flashlight on my belt. I grabbed it and fumbled wildly for the button. The light came on, and I saw it: the dummy was in the elevator with me.

 

The thing had its back to me, neck bent, looking at the control panel as if it had forgotten which floor it wanted. Suddenly it jerked its head up and slowly, slowly started turning around, and as it did, I knew – I just *knew* – that it was no longer my face it was wearing. I had not prayed since I was a kid, but now I prayed fervently, silently: Please God, not that! Anything but that!

 

But I knew it was no use. As the thing turned around completely, I looked straight into what I feared the most in the whole world – the face of my father. Not the face I had seen every day growing up, and more and more infrequently after that: the kind, inquisitive eyes, the shy, playful smile always on his lips, that unkempt head of only slightly graying hair. No, this was his face as I had seen it that last time, in the car before the paramedics pulled me out. The face I looked into now was covered in blood, his eyes were looking into mine beseechingly, scared and confused. And the jaw. His jaw looked like no human jaw should ever look – not aligned with his face at all, but smashed into the back of his throat, like a crushed beer can. This…this *thing*, it was just standing there in front of me, leaning forward slightly, showing me what I had so desperately been trying to forget as if it was proud of what it had made. But it wasn’t done yet. Oh no, there was still one little part of my memory it had yet to access, to make the picture complete. Out of what should have been a mouth came that sound I had thought I would never hear again – the sound I had spent years, waking or sleeping, trying to forget – that wheezing, gargling sound, like a cry for help drowned in blood.

 

Up until that point I had been frozen with terror, but now I screamed. I screamed and screamed, covering my eyes with my hands as I fell to the floor and everything went completely, mercifully black.

 

…

 

I woke from something hitting my head, over and over. I opened my eyes and realized it was the elevator door, as I had collapsed with my head in the opening. I was back on the ground floor, and I could see the light from the guard room. Outside, it was still dark.

 

I left my gear, picked up my things and walked out into the pure, cool night air. Never in my life had I imagined that I would leave my post before being relieved, but now I didn’t even hesitate. In the morning they would call, angry, confused, worried. Let them; I’d be far gone by then. All I knew was that I would never set my foot in that building again, or – probably – that town. I’d go home, gather what little stuff I owned, load it in the car and just drive.

 

Of course I could not tell anyone what had happened – they would laugh, blame hallucinations, a particularly vivid dream. But I knew what I had seen. There was something living in that basement. If it was human, I don’t know; maybe it had been human at some point. Perhaps the most frightful thing was the complete lack of malice it showed. It just needed to feed – off my fear, my pain, my trauma – like a hawk, casually eating the entrails of a still-alive dove. Now perhaps it was sleeping, waiting for its next victim. Never mind; there was nothing I could do about that. All I could do was put as much distance as possible between myself and the training room.
