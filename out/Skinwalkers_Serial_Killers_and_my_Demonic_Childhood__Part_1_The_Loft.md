I’ll just get straight to the point, since I don’t really don’t know how to start this. I recently created a reddit account, mainly because I needed to share my story somewhere. I really had no fucking clue where else to post this to be honest, and I’ve heard of people really gaining a lot out of this community. Also, this isn’t my only fucked up experience with paranormal or monster shit, and this is only really covering one experience. Guess I’m just unlucky. This will likely only be one part out of multiple, just depending on how it goes. Anyways, as I said, straight to the point.
	
While some of my memories may be a little fuzzy, I’ll try to explain the older ones I have as a young child the very best I can. To sum up my life, I grew up in an alcoholic family, and in a farmhouse that is either haunted or infested with skinwalkers. Maybe both. I’ve lived in Utah until 2 years ago, and most of it in the same neighborhood. As a child, I suffered from abuse, but what was the hardest for me was watching my father abuse my mother and three sisters, both physically and verbally. This family dynamic influenced me massively, and I’m now a 26 year old adult still burdened by my unhealthy and cruel childhood. 

I worked on a farm all through my teen years, and my mother homeschooled me through all 12 grades. I used to think I had any kind of positive future taken away from me by my parents, but I’ve now come to accept my past and move on. Much to my father’s anguish and anger, I broke the so-called “family obligation” of tending to the lands as a farmer. He has now disowned me. Sure, my heritage had a rich history farming the lands of Utah, but my goal in life wasn’t to fucking keep my dad happy. About my mother, she died a few years ago. Her death was both complicated and unfortunate, but too gruesome to talk about it here. I was never very close to her, but not a day passes by where I don’t think about my family, causing me to think about her. My sisters don’t hold much value to the story that I’m trying to tell, so all you need to know is that they have all left Utah, are married, and living good lives. 

My fucked up experiences started when I was about 2 years old. While I’m not even sure if this is a memory, made up, or a dream, it’s a vision that is forever burned into my head. I remember lying down at night in my parents bed. While awake at night, I saw something in my room, and this thing was some sort of humanoid figure. I believe it stayed there all night, but I really can’t be certain. All I remember are the red eyes, watching me. This has stayed vivid, and as a child I remembered this but thought I was crazy. That was until I saw those red eyes again.

Most of what I’m going to talk about from here on are things I’ve never tried to tell anyone, considering my family was indifferent, and everyone else.. well, I’ve been afraid of being called crazy. This experience was only one of many, and because of all my wackass encounters I’m very certain that the place that I grew up in is cursed, or something far worse. If you’re wondering, I live within a 3 hour drive of Skinwalker Ranch, so imagine that, but with more than just skinwalkers. 

My second and most notable experience is why I actually came to reddit in the first place. Our barnhouse had a loft, and I slept up there. It was a pretty nice setup, and quite small but also cozy. When I got older, I had to either crouch or go about on my knees. So, as I said, it was very small. However, the coziness vibe was taken away by a large gaping hole in one side of the room. This hole led into the rafters, and was full of spiders and obscured by cobwebs and dust. My older sisters would always tease me about a made up creature called the “8 legged monstrosity.” It supposedly had murdered all the little boys in this house before me, and the only way to stay safe from it was to sleep with 9 stuffed animals, because their power would supposedly repel all evil 8 legs of the monster. The fact that it was a giant spider combined with my age, gave me arachnophobia that has stuck with me to this day. 

My gullibility wasn’t the only reason I believed the creature was real. Almost every night I would hear scraping and whispers coming from the hole, and up until I was 13 I thought that it was that god forbid 8 legged beast. Every night I heard those chilling sounds, and I was always too afraid to take a peek through my covers. It eventually became a routine in my day, and I eventually normalized it, strangely enough. Every night the stuffies always protected me, so what was there to be afraid of?  

However, one night I had the guts to take a peek at this nightly occurrence, and what I saw was far worse than a giant spider. When I looked out from under the covers, I saw those exact same red eyes staring at me from deep inside the hole in the wall. I couldn’t take my eyes off of the eyes, petrified in terror. I thought about screaming for help, but my mouth was dry as a desert, and I dared not to when I saw the eyes come closer. Gliding out of the crevasse, a large black mass slowly crawled out through the rafters. Our eyes were locked, and now even when I tried to scream for help and move, I was frozen, unable to speak. The form was not humanoid, and instead seemed like a large ball of black energy, with two piercing red eyes. I don’t know whether I fainted or was overcome by this being’s energy and force, but I lost consciousness. When I woke up, it was the morning, and the creature was gone. Terrified, I ran downstairs blubbering to my parents, which was a mistake. Apparently I was being “annoying,” and my father whipped me. My mother tried to make him stop, which earned her a beating as well. 

From that point on, my sisters no longer made jokes about the 8 legged monstrosity, and I quickly gave up in my attempts at persuading my father of what I saw. I knew no one believed me, and that they never would. I never heard noises from that hole or that pair of glaring red eyes ever again. I still am undecided if I belong in an insane asylum or where I am now, far away from that cursed place. I’ll continue sharing my stories of my childhood and what lurked inside it, and I hope that someone on this platform may help me understand what I saw that night, because I really have no fucking clue
