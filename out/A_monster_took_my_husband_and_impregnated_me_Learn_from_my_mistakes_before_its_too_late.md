When the monster came tapping on my window, a sickening, familiar panic began to drip down the back of my throat. It settled in my empty stomach and lit every one of my nerves on fire.

I was foolish to believe that my nightmare was over, but I have to wake up eventually, right?

I had hoped, with every fiber of my being, that I was hallucinating, insane from grief.

That I couldn't be pregnant.

I wasn't a bad person.

And monsters weren't real.

Unfortunately, for me -- only one of those statements was true.

***

Nine months ago, I'd dug an old, nearly expired pregnancy test out of one of the cabinets in my bathroom, "just to be sure".

From the moment those two pink lines became visible, I wanted so fucking badly to believe that I was being handed the privilege of raising and nurturing a piece of my husband.

I wouldn't allow myself to recognize that the estimated time of conception didn't line up with the last time my husband and I were intimate in that way.

Or the way that his appearance had begun to change before he was out of the picture.

Color seemed to slowly drain from my husband, bit by bit with each passing day -- *easily* explained by his time spent indoors, away from the sunlight.

Being out of work must *surely* have been what was smoothing out the texture covering my husband's body. The difference was only noticeable because his had been exacerbated by years of hard, physical labor.

It made sense that the darkness my husband dwelt in caused his eyes to sink in -- irises round and dull, they were hardly visible around his equally round, dilated pupils.

And without reason to use his hands much, it was understandable that my husband's had reduced to short, blunt digits.

Excuses were easier than admitting that something was wrong. Changes are harder to notice when they happen to the person you spend so much of your time with, even if they're drastic.

As much as I hate myself for this: The more difficult it became to recognize my husband (once his appearance started to change), the easier it was for me to recall the similarities his features bore to the monster that stood outside my window.

***

That was the first night the monster came.

I sat up in bed after the faint sound of tapping roused me from my sleep. I instinctively reached toward the empty half of my bed as my eyes strained, trying to locate the source of the noise.

A ghastly shade of gray outside my bedroom window stuck out to me. I threw my glasses on.

Fuck.

My heart sank.

There was *something* lurking outside my bedroom window.

Fear, in a way I'd never felt before, crept its way in, cold and hollow in my chest. I was in no way prepared to handle a peeping tom, or any sort of home invasion. I mean, who really is? I had no weapon, no dogs, no protection, *nothing* to deter someone from attempting a break-in. 911 can only do so much with spotty service, and being 45 minutes away from the closest city.

I fumbled for my phone while continuing to peer out of the window -- the few inches that weren't covered by curtains. I could only distinctly make out a short, pale talon, and watched as it continued rapping against my bedroom window. The winter night was unforgiving; it cloaked whatever figure stood on the other side of my window in a deep, inky darkness, making it difficult to discern any features beyond the talons that tap, tap, tapped incessantly.

What do you DO in this situation?

Realistically, I had no options. Until an actual *threat* was posed, there was little more I could do but to continue staring.

So that's what I did. Wide and dry, I kept my eyes fixed on the talons that tapped on my window. It wasn't until brilliant sunlight suddenly stung my eyes -- beaming through the gap in my curtains -- that I realized I had dozed off. My memory of the previous night was still fresh in my mind; the anxiety that'd built up in my chest had yet to even dissipate.

It was all so... strange. Creepy. Unnerving. Calling the police may have been the right decision to make, because a pervert watching me sleep *was* the likely culprit. But what predator tracks down a home tucked away in the woods, just to stand outside and tap on their intended victim's bedroom window for several hours straight? What police department would take a complaint like that seriously?

Valid questions, but their answers do not matter. Not anymore, at least.

There was an instinct, a gut feeling I had that held me back from reacting to the monster outside my window.

Pinning the explanation for that gut-feeling on an imaginative product of stress and sleep deprivation was easy. It probably even made sense.

Unfortunately, nothing was going to have a chance to get better until I accepted the reality of my situation. But how can I be expected to accept something that shouldn't exist?

***

It was a monster.

Yes. A *real, living* monster.

If I opened my bedroom window, I'd be able to reach out and shake its disgustingly smooth hand. The cold wind would make my skin prickle as I'd stare directly into its depressingly lifeless eyes.

Thus began a nightly, torturous ritual.

Nine months.

275 nights.

I was losing my fucking mind.

Who wouldn't?

And where panic increased linearly, contempt grew exponentially alongside of it. I hated myself. I hated the monster outside my window.

Most of all, I hated whatever the fuck the monster had put in my body. It kicked and writhed and made me miserable. The shapes that pressed against my belly with every blow were something unnatural that made me sick.

I was scared, okay? My life is more important than an unwanted, alien fetus, and I am not a bad person for prioritizing myself. *Nobody* is a bad person for that.

Whatever I was incubating was largely to blame for the way that I fell apart. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't take care of myself.

How can you eat or drink when anxiety is the only thing your body will let you swallow?

How can you take your meds when you can't even brush your teeth, let alone be bothered to refill your prescriptions?

How do you cope with your life -- that was already fucking shitty -- when what should be impossible drags you deeper and deeper into madness?

How can you stand to be completely isolated, with nothing to distract you from the scary fucking monster that nobody would fucking believe, because it shouldn't be fucking *real*?

The honest answer?

I can't.

I *don't*.

***

I only woke up to blinding sunlight on the first night the monster visited. It was the only time I dozed off in that way, and the only time I stared at the monster for longer than 10 minutes.

Like a goddamn 5 year old, when I can't stand it anymore, I pull the covers over my head. I keep my eyes closed but never really fall asleep. When the sun is bright enough to shine through my blanket, I know it is safe to look again.

Looking at the monster outside my window *never* got easier to stomach. Like a car crash, though, I couldn't look away. Not until the panic overrode my system.

Slowly worming their way out of impossibly black shadows, details of the monster's frame became more apparent as time passed. It felt calculated, because I wasn't attempting to analyze the monster -- I could hardly stand to fucking look at it. *It* was intentionally revealing these small traits, giving me the parts to a machine without the instructional manual.

Wickedly colorless, the monster's skin was the same pale shade of gray as its talons, a stark contrast against every starless night sky it stood under. *Fur(?)* of some sort sprouted from its head and face in an unrecognizable pattern. Dark, dull eyes, devoid of life, stared straight through me -- the monster's expression never changing. Its pupils were so large and round it's as if they devoured the irises entirely.

Believe me when I say, friends, that I would've preferred sorrow to completely consume me, swallow me whole, and spit out the "monster" as a hallucination -- a manifestation of misery -- than to *ever* accept that a physical monster was what stood outside my window, tapping and whispering every night.

Yes. The monster began to whisper, too. Unintelligible words, softly articulated, filtering through the window as if carried on a breeze.

The monster's voice was mythical, like that of a Siren's -- tempting, luring me in with melodies full of promise. *Waiting* for me to climb ashore and sign my own death certificate.

And I was the crew member that'd been left to die in the wreckage of my ship, swimming desperately toward the Siren's euphonious ballad. Oblivious to the monster that was hiding underneath its skin.

If Sirens were real, I'd have been able to crawl out of my bedroom window and be met with an unbelievable, unimaginable atrocity, beyond the scope of anything a normal brain could process. Before having the opportunity to sense the danger I was in, I'd have already been dead.

The monster would've picked me right up and tore me limb from limb, savoring its meal as I bled out on the ground. I'd have been given the mercy of death, and my last conscious thoughts would've been filled with hope and desire.

Sirens are a fairytale. The monster outside my window is both halves of the Brothers Grimm. 

***

I've skirted around the topic long enough. My husband passed from a sudden cardiac event roughly 3 months before I discovered that I was pregnant.

3 months before the monster came to visit.

My husband was (and still is), from the bottom of my broken heart, my entire world. My person. More than words could ever express. He was love, warmth, *home* incarnate. Six years was not enough time. A *lifespan* wouldn't have been enough time.

I'd never imagined a future without my husband in it. How could I? Even after our mortal bodies passed, I truly pictured our souls bound to an eternity together -- an eternity of raw, wholesome love. Our words, delicate and tender, floating through time and space. A cadence not unlike the whispers that come from the monster outside my window.

***

While I did my best, I can admit that my husband deserved better.

The guilt (as you can imagine) will haunt me indefinitely. I will spend every fucking second of every goddamn day wondering how different things would have been if I'd noticed the way he was changing. *How* could I not recognize what was happening to my better half?

I know what you're thinking.

My husband was never a monster. He was full of love and warmth until the moment his heart stopped, and my love for him never wavered. I don't know what caused his changes, and it wouldn't matter if I did. My husband was different, but he was *never* a monster.

***

Time was ticking for the creature growing in my belly; I had to accept and face what was happening.

It was no coincidence that a monster came to my window the very night I found out I was pregnant.

It was no coincidence that the creature growing in my belly felt more and more alien, in tandem with the intensity of the monster's nightly visits.

I can acknowledge that my husband's condition resembled the monster outside my window, but I cannot stress enough:

**My husband was never a monster.**

The thing about the monster, though? The overarching question of *why* the abomination outside my window had initially been given that title?

The monster IS alien. Not from outer space; its features are just grotesquely... unique. In the most unsettling way.

The monster incites such an intense fear because it is unknown. And how has history treated the unknown?

***

The night before I went into labor, the monster once again came tapping. Over time, with every visit, its volume slowly rose from gentle whispers, growing louder and louder. More urgent. Making it harder and harder to muffle.

You have to understand -- I *had* to protect myself in some way. I don't care if pulling the covers over my head was childish. I don't care if doing everything shy of killing myself was immoral. Somewhere in the storm, I had to figure out how to keep my sanity anchored. I had to find what I could control.

I tried to be brave.

I tried to stay confident.

I tried to remain strong.

I tried.

I tried.

*I tried.* 

That night, I couldn't take it anymore. Trying was pointless.

I knew I would go into labor any day, and gauged that it would be safe if I just pressed my ear to my bedroom window. To *finally* listen to what the monster had been saying. I couldn't imagine it would recite everything it's uttered over the last nine months in a single night, but I had a feeling it would know I was listening this time.

Getting out of bed, I knelt by the window and carefully pulled the curtain aside, just enough to press my ear against the cold, damp glass.

A deep, booming voice, *seething,* almost vibrating in my skull, spoke,

*Abominations are born from me, and to me they will return.*

*Murder, sickness, suicide, accidents... they always find their way back home.*

*Children are not a consequence of your actions. **My** children, my **abominations** bear that burden.*

*Over and over, your kind fail my children. I give my strongest to your weakest, and you still fail. My children will return to me, flesh or spirit, but you will not be absolved of your negligence.*

*Why do I send my children to their death or great harm? They are different from you in ways you wouldn't understand or believe.*

*My children will be fine. The wicked hearts I send them to, will not.*

*Wicked Hearts deserve misfortune. Losing your husband, your sanity, everything but your **life**, was nothing compared to the fate you truly deserved*

*For nine months, I whispered from the other side of your window.*

*How ironic, that the only way you chose to "protect" yourself, was by ignoring all that you'd need to know to make your burden your gift.*

*What was the big secret? The answers you were **so** curious about, but were too cowardly to listen to? What message could the monster outside your window want to convey?*

*You won't like it. Wicked Hearts never do.*

*I told you **everything** you would ever need to know to take care of the daughter I sent you.*

*Her anatomy, her expected development, what she ate, the conditions she would thrive under, the differences between your heart and hers, and how you could grow from that.*

*What did you do?*

*You childishly covered your ears.*

*You starved yourself, refused necessary medical care, stopped taking your prescribed medication, and physically hurt yourself in an effort to miscarry.*

*You call that "brave"?*

*You call that "confident"?*

*YOU CALL THAT "**STRONG**?"*

The monster then mocked me:

*"But what was I supposed to believe with an abomination lurking outside my window every night?"*

*"How could you expect me to believe a hideous, unknown creature was anything but evil?"*

*"There was something foreign growing inside of me; how can you blame me for protecting myself, fearing that it would take my life?"*

I didn't have an answer, but the monster didn't wait for one.

*Your heart has always been wicked. My son, your "husband", returned to me once that became apparent.*

*That's why I sent you **my** child, **my** abomination, **my** daughter -- to be **your** burden.*

*I knew what you would do with her. It's what all Wicked Hearts have done.*

*Do not get my words twisted. Termination is not murder. A **good-hearted** mother's life should always come first.*

*You may think I'm cruel -- that **my** heart is wicked -- for destroying your life in the way that I have.*

*Justify that however you would like. You are delusional, and your behavior is predictable.*

*The day a Wicked Heart sees a stranger instead of a monster,*

*Guidance instead of damnation,*

*Gratefulness instead of revulsion,*

*A bestowal instead of a burden,*

*Is the day I'll consider that Wicked Hearts can change.*

*Until then, they'll get what they deserve.*

*For 275 days, I tapped and tapped on your window, drawing your attention, revealing myself piece-by-piece through the gap in your curtains.*

*Slowly. Intentionally.*

*Waiting for the day your resolve would slip and you would come to me.*

*Waiting for the day you would throw the curtains aside to look directly at me, to satisfy your curiosity of wanting to know what your daughter will look like.*

*Waiting for the day you would murder her.*

*You will be going into labor tomorrow. I will be watching.*

***

The monster's words had barely ceased before the clock on my nightstand clicked over to midnight. I turned my head to get one last glimpse of the monster, only to be met with a pair of unnervingly deep, dark eyes, inches from mine on the other side of the glass.

A scream escaping my throat and an indescribable pain erupting in my midsection were the last things I remembered before my vision went black.

***

I woke up in a hospital bed, disoriented and in pain. My brain *throbbed* as it became flooded with... everything.

There was a sort of "aura" I felt that I couldn't describe, though; it evoked an eerie degree of calmness that somehow held me together. It freaked me out, but absorbed the panic before it could melt into my nerves.

Instinctually, I placed a hand over my stomach in an effort to ground myself and control the pain I was in.

It was flat.

My monster was gone.

Before I could compartmentalize anything that I was taking in, a woman dressed in blue scrubs entered my room.

"Hello, my name is Jamie and I'm a nurse-practitioner," she spoke from just inside the doorway, almost robotically. The sight of someone normal, speaking normally, knocked the air right out of my lungs.

*How did she know I'd just woken up?*

"I stopped by to let you know that the doctor will be with you shortly," the nurse finished.

I gestured vaguely toward my empty stomach, unable to form words. The concern etched into my face was palpable.

I expected Jamie to turn on her claws and scamper away the moment she was done talking, but surprisingly, she didn't. Instead, the nurse hesitated -- a look on her face that can only mean bad news is coming.

"I'll go get it," Jamie said reluctantly, harshly whipping her tail as she turned to walk away.

*It?*

I took a closer look at myself and my surroundings after the nurse left the room, trying desperately to absorb the stillness that the hospital was providing. Objectively, everything was "normal", in the sense that the shapes and colors were correct. But something was "off" in that the arrangement of them wasn't quite right.

The silence was becoming nerve-wracking. The longer I sat, the worse it felt.

I caught a glimpse of some faces as they walked past my room. Their expressions worried, passersby quickened their pace and averted their eyes.

My mind was reeling. So many thoughts, so many questions. Keeping in everything I've gone through these last nine months was smothering me.

275 days of solitude. The rest of the world could have burned to ashes and me -- isolated in my cabin in the woods -- would have been none the wiser.

But the world hadn't burned to ashes. The grass was still green and the sky was still blue. Taking a glance out the window, I could see that crunchy leaves littered the sidewalk, while shades of orange and red danced together in the wind.

I hadn't felt a breeze in so long. I bet the autumn air was crisp and refreshing. My body was probably relieved to be breathing anything other than stale cabin air.

The view should have been breathtaking, but my senses were overloaded. There were too many lights, too many colors; the barren tree branches pecking against my room's window bore a nauseating resemblance to the monster I've been haunted by. I quickly looked away, wishing I had a blanket thick enough to shield me.

The lack of postnatal care was beginning to put me on-edge. Why was I still alone? Why was it so quiet? Shouldn't I be feeding whatever I gave birth to? How much time had passed since I'd given birth? *Where was the fucking nurse that should be bringing me my baby?*

*Baby?*

I sat with my thoughts, making friends with the flickering fluorescent lights overhead. The more that time passed, the closer their humming sounded to faint whispers.

Can you imagine what I was going through in this moment? Nine months of completely secluded torture, waking up in an unfamiliar space with no memory of getting there? No answers, forced to sit in agonizing silence when you want to scream at the top of your fucking lungs and rip your scutes out in a fit of rage? Forced to sit still while your body processes everything you denied to give it for the past 275 days?

***

Time isn't real. I can't say how much passed before a different woman entered my room, cradling something small, silent, and unmoving in her arms; it was wrapped loosely with a blanket that was entirely too large for it.

*Is that what came out of me?*

"My name is Doctor Howell," the woman spoke. "You must be Ms. Farley. Can you tell me your date of birth, please?"

The way my brain stuttered before mumbling the correct numbers felt alarming.

"Is... that my..." I croaked, unable to finish my sentence. Sweat began to bead on my forehead. I hardly recognized my own voice.

"We need to talk about that," Dr. Howell replied, her face bearing a familiar mask of hesitancy.

As she started toward me, she continued, "I know you must feel very overwhelmed right now."

She bent down and handed me the bundle from her arms. The fabric was soft and warm. I kept my eyes locked on Dr. Howell's; despite my frustration, I wasn't ready to look.

"I have so many questions," I replied weakly, my lower lip quivering.

"I'll do my best to answer what I can," said Dr. Howell. "It's going to be hard, but I need you to take a look at the... child, for lack of a more accurate term, I've handed you."

I took a deep breath.

I'd held onto the hope that I was insane and this was all a nightmare. That I'd be "pregnant" forever, stuck in a layer of the afterlife, somewhere between limbo and hell. I couldn't believe that the time had come for me to look at the creature that had been growing in my belly.

I closed my eyes, tilted my head down, and opened them.

A scream clawed its way up my throat. It took every ounce of my willpower to choke it back down.

The thing I was looking at was not conceivable. The pieces of the puzzle the monster outside my window had been giving me were finally coming together. The creature in my arms was the picture on the box.

Tears sprang forth immediately.

I ran a webbed hand over impossibly smooth skin. Skin so pale it was almost reflective. 

Glancing at the scales on my arms, I revered in the way they shimmered under the room's lights. A reminder that I was right to be disturbed by the creature that I was holding.

The monster. *My* monster.

I held the hand of my monster, feeling its short, detached talons. 5 on each hand. I recognized them as the shapes that had pressed against my belly while I was still pregnant.

My monster was so still. So unnaturally quiet. Its eyes weren't open yet, so I pulled up one of its eyelids to look at the shape and color of them.

Steely-blue, dark and round, my monster's eye gazed upward into nothingness.

Our eyes are never that dark. Our pupils are never that round. Green, orange, or yellow, our irises take up the entirety of our eyes. With slits for pupils, they shine and allow us to expertly see in the dark. Something monsters shouldn't be able to do.

The contrast between our eyes and those of monsters made my stomach churn.

*It wasn't. Fucking. Right.*

I opened my monster's mouth. It had no teeth, and its tongue was fully intact. I ran a forked tongue over my own sharp canines, my mind breaking down with every infeasible characteristic it tried to process.

Something fine and wispy sat atop my monster's head. It was soft and sparse. I had to feel the serrated texture of my own head to remind myself I wasn't crazy. This wasn't normal. *I wasn't a bad person for putting myself first.*

The sun was setting outside the window in my hospital room, casting beautiful shades of gold across the sky. It felt like years had passed when Dr. Howell spoke again.

"The thing you're holding is unlike anything *anyone* has ever seen before," she started.

"But I'm sure you know that, Ms. Farley."

"Where am I even at? How did anybody know where I lived, or that I was going into labor?" I asked.

"To the best of my knowledge, a 911 call was placed from your home, describing your condition. Your location was then tracked by dispatchers, and you were taken by ambulance to here," Dr. Howell replied.

"Do you know how long I've been here, or when this monster-

"Creature -- I meant to say -- was born?" I inquired.

Dr. Howell looked so tired as she responded,

"You gave birth roughly 18 hours ago. Even after the best numbing agents we have, nothing was helping your pain. The only thing we could do was sedate you, to ensure yours and your offspring's health was prioritized.

"Staff assisting the delivery were growing increasingly disturbed and ill -- a few had to leave the room.

"To be completely honest, Ms. Farley, we were speechless. We were in no way prepared to see a creature such as the one in your arms. It defies all manners of biology that we thought we'd figured out.

"I wish I had more answers, Ms. Farley. After birth, we took the creature to another room to stay warm, but it *still* has yet to make a peep. Were it not for it breathing, you could tell me that creature was a stillbirth and I would believe you.

"The more time that passes, the more needs this creature is going to have. What those are, or how to meet them, we don't know. The creature is going to suffer, if it hasn't already begun to.

"I fear you're going to have to make a choice, Ms. Farley," Dr. Howell then said.

Gooseflesh broke out underneath my scales as a chill trickled down my spine. I had the distinct feeling -- the same feeling that's haunted me for nine months -- that I was being watched. I glanced over my left shoulder.

No.

*No* 

Outside my hospital window, I could see the unmistakable outline of someone's head and shoulders.

Not someone.

Some *thing.*

The monster.

***

Maybe if I shrieked until my voice gave out and started breaking shit, they'd lock me away in a place with no windows, where the monster couldn't stalk me anymore.

There's just no way it followed me. There's *no* *fucking* *way.*

I turned my head away from the window and fought back more tears. Nothing felt real.

Dr. Howell studied my face while I tried to keep it as composed as possible. I knew what my "choices" were. There was only one.

I wasn't proud of the decision I was forced to make regarding my monster; it made me sick to my stomach. Simply put, I didn't know what *any* of its basic needs were, and even if I did, I was in no way equipped to meet them. I was completely unprepared to take care of something that'd never been known to exist before.

Unable to give the quality of life that my monster would've deserved, the morally responsible decision was to terminate post-birth, which medical staff encouraged. I was told it was quick and painless, although it doesn't ease my remorse. It eats me alive.

As horrible as my monster was, motherly love poured from my heart and seeped into my bones -- a maternal instinct that my 6-pound abomination couldn't change.

***

I came home from the hospital today. As guilty as I felt arriving empty handed, a selfish wave of relief washed over me, thinking that the visits from the monster were over. That I could grieve, sleep, and climb out of the dark hole I'd fallen into, without that creature dragging me back down.

*Tap.*

*Tap.*

*Tap.*

My eyes widened.

The familiar panic was fresh and frigid.

*The nightmare was never going to end.*

I snapped my head toward the window.

There it was. *There it fucking was.*

Fury replaced fear. I should've just closed the curtains when I returned home from the hospital. Fuck, I should've closed them after the first time I saw the monster. Closed my eyes and ears with it on that first night, and pretended it wasn't there.

It wasn't that easy. The sadistic piece of shit creeping outside my window every night knew how to manipulate my senses to keep me in its grasp. To control me. It mouthed off on its soapbox, pinning *me* as a monster, as if it were the pillar of morality.

There was nothing morally superior in any part of that freak.

All I did was love my husband. I didn't seek medical help for him when his appearance began to change. He passed unexpectedly from something I had no way to prevent.

That makes my heart wicked? What did I do -- at what point did my beloved husband "realize" my heart was wicked?

What power does the omnipresent monster outside my window possess, to know exactly whose heart is wicked? How does it even determine "wickedness"? Why does it go through so many hoops to *abuse* people it deems wicked?

Why.

*Why?*

**WHY?**

I yanked the covers off, ready to give the nightmare outside my window exactly what it wanted.

Its features were crystal clear this time; I knew they would be. It wasn't possible to see its entire form through the small gap between the curtains, but I was sure it was smiling.

Smug piece of shit.

I stormed -- no, *stomped* my way over to my bedroom window. Every thud landing with as much anger and strength that I could muster in my fragile state.

"You didn't give me a chance to talk back last time," I said between the gap, a smile of my own stretching ear to ear.

"Not so big and tough when your punishment doesn't pay off, huh?

"Freak of nature ruining good people's lives because your fabricated narrative of good vs. bad is completely skewed from *my* reality.

"It was kill the thing or let it suffer. I couldn't give it what it needed. *Nobody* could. You're insane if you think suffering was the right choice for it. And you're insane for thinking a person would listen to -- let alone *believe* -- something as evil and vile as you.

"In my world, *you* have a wicked heart.

"*You* are the monster.

"You? Are everything you've crucified wicked hearts for.

"But you knew all of that already. You always fucking know.

"Get whatever the fuck you want to do with me out of your system and let me keep the sliver of life I have left."

The monster was silent. Of course it was.

But I knew it was still smiling.

I couldn't take it anymore.

In one dramatic rip, I tore the curtains down and glared straight into the eyes of the monster outside my window.

Just like it wanted me to.

A wave of hysteria tried like hell to overtake me, but the pieces of the monster that had already been revealed to me over time held it back.

The sound of something wet or sticky, writhing and squelching like a bucket of worms, cut through the stillness and broke my gaze from the monster's eyes.

Below its waist, undulating tendrils snaked their way around the lower half of the monster's body, slimy and black.

*WHAT THE FUCK?*

Legs.

If you can call them that.

I was looking below-the-waist of the monster -- the parts that weren't visible from its usual stance outside my window. The parts that were concealed beneath the blanket my monster was wrapped in at the hospital.

There was something stationary in the viscous sea of appendages.

*Multiple* somethings.

Children.

Children that couldn't have been older than 5 or 6 surrounded the monster. All had extreme, visible trauma, including exposed brains, protruding bones with thin layers of skin covering them, deep, long scars and open wounds across their bodies, missing limbs and other injuries too heinous to describe.

How could anyone -- any *thing* -- be able to stomach sending their *children* to a fate like those? How severe is the abuse the monster's children suffered to have accumulated those kinds of wounds?

The monster outside my window remained wordless as I took in the harrowing scene.

Then I saw it.

Saw *her.*

My monster.

Though I only saw her briefly, bundled up in that soft blanket, I recognized her steely-blue eye. The same one I looked at in the hospital before she was terminated.

Detached from her skull, dangling by a meaty string, was her other eye. My monster was little more than a skeleton, her freakishly smooth skin stretched taut over her bones.

Bones that were brittle and broken.

Skin that gleamed silver under the moonlight.

The stars were out tonight.

My monster had deep lacerations on most of her body, slowly oozing a thick, red liquid. Barely detectable, I could see that she was shaking and twitching.

*Did I do this to my monster?*

*Was this the result of neglect during pregnancy -- what the monster outside my window accused me of?*

No.

My monster was perfect at birth. There wasn't anything wrong with her. She died quickly and painlessly.

***

Looking back, from the time I woke up in the hospital to the time I was discharged, everything went *too* smoothly. There was no outrage or panic. No fear or overt urgency. I was given space and time to process things as they unfolded. I was blanketed in that chilling serenity.

Dr. Howell knew exactly what to say, as if she'd spoke it many times before. The first nurse that checked on me, and the people I saw walk past my room, exuded just enough unease to incite alarm in me as I watched them.

So that I wouldn't *really* question them.

Dr. Howell had lied when she said that my child was unlike anything she'd ever seen.

Which means she probably lied about the pain, too.

Time was frozen, icicles chasing me through the rabbit hole I was spiraling down.

My heart pined in a depressing way. Regret, already intense, fused with the rage that was pulsing in my veins. My false bravado faltered as tears gathered in my eyes, stinging as they spilled onto my cheeks.

I was on the brink of collapsing when it dawned on me. When I finally put the fucking pieces together.

How would the graveyard outside my window bear such extreme trauma to their bodies, if they were terminated after birth, like my daughter?

*Daughter.*

The monster doesn't keep its children once they return from their death sentence.

It does something truly monstrous -- something more deserving of that title than my subjective perception.

The monster recycles its children.

***

"Recycling" is the best way I can think to describe what the monster outside my window is doing with its children.

Over and over, the monster sends them to whoever it deems has a "wicked heart".

While all come out unscathed after birth, the monster's children are mutilated in that hospital before being terminated. Every wound from every termination accumulates.

The monster *wants* "wicked hearts" to believe its children's' injuries are a reflection of what they'd sustained in-utero.

The monster then ages its children in a way that exaggerates those injuries, to induce as much guilt as possible when it brings them for its sick show-and-tell.

How fucked up is that?

How *evil* is that?

I know what you're thinking.

That the monster is right, I'm making this up to deflect blame, I caused all of this, I deserve it, blah, blah, blah.

*I* am not evil.

My husband? The sweet man the *real* monster supposedly sent me? Where did he go? I don't recognize his face anywhere outside my window. How do I know the monster didn't drain and murder him on purpose, then lie about his "return" to further guilt me?

Because my husband was never a monster.

*I AM NOT A FUCKING MONSTER.*

***

I don't know how long I stood, transfixed, before a mirthless laugh brought me out of my pensiveness.

I once again fixed my eyes on the monster.

It didn't take long for it to speak, reigniting that spark of hatred within me.

*No emotion you fill yourself with will defy the atrocities you've committed.*

*Try as you might to convince yourself that I am evil and your heart is not wicked -- the torment you've experienced is a reflection of that.*

*It will haunt you for the rest of your days.*

*And you deserve every bit of it.*

The monster outside my window broke into that shit-eating grin, revealing two perfect rows of straight, flat, pearly white teeth.

My body was ablaze.

It was time to end this fucking nightmare.

Before I fed myself to the wolves, I spoke up one last time,

"If you were in my shoes,

"If you'd have been there,

"If you'd have *witnessed* it from my perspective,

"You would have done the same."

The monster's expression never changed, and my blood was still boiling.

Without thinking twice, I opened the window and stumbled out toward the monster. My bare claws sunk into the mud and brambles were catching in my scales as I approached it.

The monster stood further back than normal in order for his legs and children to be visible through my window. I closed maybe half of the distance before a mucky tendril snatched me up and pulled me nose to nose with the monster.

It spoke:

*You see a monster.*

*I see humanity.*

Another tendril forced my mouth open.

The monster purged a foul, black sludge, and pushed every drop of it down my throat.

I wanted to gag and spit it back up, but I couldn't. The monster kept me in its tight grasp as the sludge dispersed throughout my body. It wasn't until it fully sank in that I was released.

Everything went black before I'd even hit the dirt.

I woke up back in my bed.

Sunlight beamed beautifully through my window -- a sight I wasn't sure I'd ever find comforting again. My blankets were soft and warm. The smell of coffee permeated the air and I could hear pots and pans tinkering in the kitchen.

My belly was full. My medications were back on my bedside table. Beside them was a card -- an appointment reminder with my primary care. Scars, chips, and burns to my scales were completely healed.

It's as if the monster outside my window really *was* a nightmare and I had finally woken up. That time had turned back or I was sent to a universe where my husband never passed away.

I took a deep breath and pulled my covers off, excited but nervous to walk into the kitchen and be reunited with my soulmate.

Something clattered to the ground as I stood. Startled, I bent over to pick it up.

Shimmering in the sunlight, I held between my fingers one of my scales. No longer its usual vibrant blue, my scale shone a colorless silver.

I cracked my bedroom window open and tossed my scale onto the grass.

Out of sight, out of mind.

The smile I was forcing did not reach my eyes as I strode into the kitchen.
