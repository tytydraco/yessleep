I had always known there was something off about my roommate, Jake. We had been friends since high school, and when we both ended up in the same college, it seemed like a no-brainer to room together. But lately, he had been acting…strange.

It started with little things—he would stare at me, unblinking, for long periods, his eyes glassy and distant. I’d catch him murmuring to himself in a low voice, the words too quiet to make out. When I asked him what was wrong, he’d just laugh it off and change the subject.

But then, one night, things took a turn for the worse.

I woke up to the sound of scratching. It was subtle at first, almost like the sound of a mouse scurrying along the floor. But as I lay there, trying to figure out where it was coming from, it grew louder, more frantic. I sat up in bed, my heart pounding, and looked over at Jake’s bed.

He wasn’t there.

The scratching was coming from the closet.

I swallowed hard, trying to shake off the wave of dread that washed over me. “Jake?” I called out, my voice trembling.

No answer.

I slowly got out of bed and crept toward the closet. The scratching continued, growing more desperate with each step I took. My hand shook as I reached for the doorknob. I hesitated, every instinct in my body screaming at me to turn around, to go back to bed and pretend I hadn’t heard anything.

But I couldn’t. Something compelled me to open that door.

The second I turned the knob, the scratching stopped. The sudden silence was almost worse than the noise had been. I took a deep breath and swung the door open.

Jake was crouched inside, his fingers bloody from scratching at the walls. His eyes were wide, wild, and locked onto mine the moment the door opened. He grinned, a smile that stretched too wide, too unnatural.

“Do you think I’m crazy?” he whispered, his voice raspy and hoarse.

I stepped back, my mind reeling. “Jake, what the hell are you doing?”

He tilted his head to the side, as if considering my question. Then he laughed—low, guttural, and completely devoid of humor. “They told me you wouldn’t understand. They told me you’d try to stop me.”

“Who told you?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady, but it cracked with fear.

Jake slowly stood up, his movements jerky and unnatural. He stepped out of the closet, his eyes never leaving mine. “They’re in the walls,” he whispered. “They’re always watching, always whispering. But you can’t hear them, can you?”

I shook my head, backing away from him. “Jake, there’s no one in the walls. You’re not making any sense.”

He lunged at me suddenly, grabbing my shoulders with a grip so tight it hurt. His face was inches from mine, his breath hot and ragged. “Don’t lie to me!” he screamed. “You have to hear them! You have to help me!”

I tried to pull away, but he was too strong. “Jake, let go of me!”

“They said you would say that,” he hissed, his eyes wide and bloodshot. “They said you’d pretend, but I know. I know you can hear them too. You’re just too scared to admit it.”

I was scared, but not of what Jake was talking about. I was scared of him. I needed to get out of there, needed to get help.

“Jake, please, you’re scaring me,” I said, my voice barely a whisper.

He let go of me suddenly, stepping back and running his hands through his hair, tugging at it as if trying to rip it out. “I’m sorry,” he muttered. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to…it’s just…they won’t stop. They keep telling me things…terrible things.”

I took a deep breath, trying to calm my racing heart. “Jake, we need to get you some help. Come on, let’s go to the hospital.”

He looked at me, and for a moment, I thought I saw a flicker of the old Jake, the one I’d known for years. But then he shook his head violently, his expression darkening. “No, no, no,” he muttered. “They said you’d say that too. They said you’d try to take me away.”

Before I could react, Jake pulled a knife from his pocket. My blood ran cold as he pointed it at me, his hand shaking.

“I can’t let you do that,” he said, his voice eerily calm now. “I can’t let them take you too.”

I raised my hands, trying to stay calm, trying to think of a way out. “Jake, you don’t have to do this. We can figure this out together. Just…put the knife down.”

He shook his head, tears streaming down his face. “I’m sorry,” he whispered. “But I have to.”

I lunged for the door, but Jake was faster. He grabbed me, the knife flashing in the dim light of the room. I felt a sharp pain in my side, and everything went black.

When I woke up, I was lying on the floor, the room spinning around me. I could feel blood pooling beneath me, feel the life draining out of me.

Jake was gone.

I tried to move, but my body wouldn’t respond. but... by some reason... i couldn\`t stop smiling. a deep and horrefying smile. The world grew dimmer, and as I lay there, I heard it—the faintest of whispers, coming from the walls.

They were real.

And they were laughing.
