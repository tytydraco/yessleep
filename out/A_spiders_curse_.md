In the hollow dark, I wait, I creep,
Where shadows crawl and secrets sleep.
A place forgotten, cold, and vast—
Where light dares not to breathe or last.
Upon the floor, the dust collects,
A stillness thick with slow regrets.
And in this tomb of endless night,
I hunger, patient, for my bite.

There, I sense it—the prey, so near,
A mortal, frail, so filled with fear.
His breath, it trembles, soft, unsure,
A soul that teeters on the edge of pure.
He stumbles through the dampened air,
Eyes wide, lost in despair.
This world of rot, this world of dread,
Where every thought is filled with lead.

Oh, how you tremble, broken thing,
Shivering under what I bring.
I see you now—so weak, so lost,
A fragile soul, no matter the cost.
Your shoes are torn, your face a mask,
Of misery, you dare not ask
For mercy, for release, for light—
For I am here, and you are mine tonight.

The air is thick with dust and mold,
A tomb, a crypt, so dark, so cold.
The walls, they crack, the floor gives way,
The stench of rot is here to stay.
And still you stumble, oh, so near,
A heartbeat racing, full of fear.
Each step, a plea, each breath a prayer,
But none will come—there is none who care.

Now you pause—so close, so tight—
And feel my presence in the night.
The hairs upon your neck they rise,
As I descend from where it lies.
With legs so long, so black, so thin,
I crawl and writhe beneath your skin.
And you, so human, so unaware,
Feel a sudden chill fill the air.

Do you feel me? I am the dark,
I am the spark that lights your heart.
Your skin, so warm, so full of breath,
I take you now—closer to death.
A tremor in your hand, you turn,
A flicker of fear, a silent burn.
I see you now, and you, me too—
And in your eyes, despair breaks through.

I come for you, and you, for me,
Bound by fate, no chance to flee.
The webs I weave are soft and slow,
But soon they bind, and soon they grow.
Around your throat, around your heart,
The silken threads, they pull apart.
Each breath you take, each scream you try,
But now, in darkness, none shall cry.

You fight, you struggle—oh, how weak,
Each move you make, you feel the streak
Of venom coursing through your veins,
A fever, hot with ancient pains.
You try to scream, but none will hear—
The silence, thick, is all you fear.
The webs, they pull, they wrap, they bind,
Until your body’s trapped, confined.

I take you now, I take your soul,
You’ve wandered far from hope’s control.
Your flesh, it quivers, soft and tight,
As my fangs taste the dying light.
I feel your pulse, your final breath,
A flicker near the edge of death.
Oh, how you struggle, how you ache—
But this is yours—this is your fate.

The walls close in, the light fades fast,
And all that remains is what I’ve cast.
No refuge here, no place to hide,
For in my web, you shall reside.
The air grows cold, the silence deep,
And soon your cries—no longer seep.
You are mine now, bound in dread,
A puppet pulled by threads of red.

And so I wait, in the deepened night,
In the shadows, beyond your sight.
The flesh you leave, the soul you lose,
Are mine to feed, and mine to choose.
And as I feast, I shall not spare,
For all who wander find despair.
