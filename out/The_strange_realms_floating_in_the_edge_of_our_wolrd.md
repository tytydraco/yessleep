I want to share this knowledge to you guys on nosleep, because I noticed that there are a few stories from the members of this subreddit that remind me about the feeling and character of a "Kaidan".

So what is "Kaidan"?

You can understand it as "strange stories" in Japanese, but this one are not describe as the original meaning.

"Kaidan" are bizarre, horror and terrifying events, they happen when one (sometime it take more than one person) reaches a certain condition (these conditions are not fixed and are not the same).

The chances to one encountering Kaidan are very low, but there are paranormal research organizations that already organize hunting units and actively seeking for Kaidan. They have equipment like the Kaidan detection radar, which can detect the spatial wavelengths that Kaidan leaves behind as they floats between the boundaries of our world. 

Kaidan can "float" aimlessly, without an anchor until you meet a condition that activates them. Sometimes they stay in one place, waiting for an unlucky one to enter their realm. It can look just like our real world or taken place as something far from what we've ever seen. 

In some cases, Kaidan remains in contact with our world after someone enters, which leads to the same result where people can still communicate via phone or access the internet, like in the case of "Kisaragi Station", which I believe is also a Kaidan.

Sometimes ordinary people discover Kaidan's existence and organize their own Kaidan Hunting groups. For unknown reason, they became sensitive to Kaidan's existence and coordinate, which, according to my grandfather, is like Kaidan are inviting them into their world.

My grandfather's experience after many years of working in a Kaidan Hunting team has been boiled down to 3 rules:

#1: Every kaidan has its own rules, which is equally binding on both "them" and us. The only way to survive is to find out how the Kaidan works.

For example, a kaidan where you are hunted by a monster in a dilapidated building, you accidentally discover that it cannot attack you when your back is touching a surface. It is right in front of you but cannot attack you, because it is also under the authority of the Kaidan rule. You just keep your back to the wall, even crawling backwards on the floor until you exit the building and return to the real world.

But there are always exception.

If you're in a Kaidan with the only rule is "dont look benind". How can you find out about it? The first thing a human will do when they enter a strange place is to look around to have a sight of what's around. This will lead you to demise instantly. The only way to survive in this case is when you have a "companion" who will look around, triggering Kaidan's rule. Their deaths will give you a clue as to how this Kaidan works.

But these still just the easiest kind of Kaidan, since there are those that have more than 1 rules, even 7-8 rules.


#2: Try to avoid conflicts with "people".

Sometimes a Kaidan will be role-playing mini-world, which means there will be "NPCs" and plot. 

These NPCs act like normal humans in Kaidan's world, their existence having a significant effect on the fulfillment of your "role" as well as driving the plot forward. They are directly related to your survival, so be careful when dealing with them if you can.

#3: Don't try to fight "them" with the stuff from our world.

Like I said, Kaidan's existence has the nature of a mini-world, they have their own rules, and this also includes objects.

Objects from our world cannot deal damage to objects in Kaidan.

Yeah, your AR-15 won't leave a scratch on the monster's head, im sorry. But it can be kill with a hand knife or something you get randomly around the place (you can get hurt, so be careful). If you want to fight back, try to find a weapon around the Kaidan's realm.

***

I don't think this information can affect our world or your lives, because like I said, the odds of encountering a Kaidan are very low.

But be careful with your actions if you intend to dig into Kaidan's existence.

If you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back at you.
