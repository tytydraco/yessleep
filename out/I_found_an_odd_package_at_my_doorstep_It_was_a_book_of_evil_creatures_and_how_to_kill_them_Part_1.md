Hello, I’m Lee. If you recognize me, I’m the guy who wrote that shitty story about that haunted Sonic CD disc. If you don’t, that’s fine. I’ll give you all a quick explanation.

I am, or was a pretty avid sonic nerd. I found my dads old game consoles, and bought some Sega CD games off of ebay. The Sonic CD disc I bought was either tampered with, or haunted in some way. The reason I think it was tampered with was because it mentioned some organization at the start. The disc in itself was kinda stupid.  Looking back now, I probably shouldn’t have even posted that. But I guess I was too panicked to think clearly.

Ok. Back the the present. It’s been about two months, and I’ve done a little research into the organization the disc mentioned.It was… The Limbo Project, i think? I looked that up, and found nothing. So I forgot about it. A few days passed, and nothing really happened. Until one day, me and my brother were staying up watching a movie. We normally stay up all night once a week. At around 2:00 AM, someone knocked at the door. My high strung west highland terrier barked like mad man at the door. My brother gently pushed him away from the door, and i grabbed the package.

The package was not really out of the ordinary. I asked my brother if he ordered anything under my name, which he refused. I opened the package and I was dumbfounded. In this package was a book called “The Limbo Project: Encyclopedia of Evil Entities”. Well, looks like I got my answer. I turned to page one. A makeshift warning was on the front.

“Dear Viewer:

We thank you for participating in our endeavor. The purpose of The Limbo Project is to capture evil entities, and return them to their realm of origin. Yes, evil creatures exist. Not just from your campfire story or internet creepypasta, but everything written is brought to life im some way. Its a certain effect on cognition that brings written concepts to reality from the collective unconscious. In summary, if enough people think about a fictional concept, it will become a reality. This book is an encyclopedia on every being we’ve come across, and how to kill them. You are in charge of using this book to find a way to kill these creatures once and for all.

All will be revealed in due time.

May Time be on your side, in the name of the ticking clock.

-The Limbo Project


I silently cursed at myself as I flew through the pages. There were some weird entries on here. There was Slender man, That weird smiling dog, and even that one cat Trevor Henderson created. It said EVERY CREATURE, isn’t there something I haven’t heard of? A few pages later a found something interesting.

Entity 5147: The Nevergreen

A pine tree given life from sprits of murder victims killed on the night of Christmas Eve. It is very stealthy, disguising itself as a regular tree until someone draws near. Upon nearing the beast, it un roots itself, revealing spider like appendages and swallows the victim whole. It is unknown where the victim goes after being consumed, but theory’s suggest that they are transported to a snowy plains with many Nevergreens. We have deducted that it’s only weakness is to cut the tree down with an axe, then recite the banishing spell found on page # 247. The Nevergreen will cease to exist after the spell is told.


After a few pages I go to the page with the Banishing Spell. I jot it down on a notebook, and head to bed along with my brother.

Looks like I’m going monster hunting…
