Last year my mom finally trusted me enough to give me my own phone. This meant that I could communicate with friends, read, meet people online, play games, and browse the internet without much restriction. I’m homeschooled so it’s safe to say that I’m pretty sheltered. Which was why my mom gave me the task of studying the internet as part of my homework packet.  
  
And I did this diligently  
  
The task led me on a journey to the creation of the first computer. Uncovering the story of the gay British genius that we as a planet failed, tortured, and ultimately destroyed. It led me towards war. Love. To the very first messages between college campuses. I traveled through the history of the internet like bullet points. From Napster to Livewire. AOL to MSN. Yahoo to Google. 56k to DSL to Fiber. I got to see MySpace and FaceBook at their height. Xanga and Tumblr. And the darkest corners of 4Chan and the Silk Road, to Reddit: The Front Page of the Internet.  
  
Along the way, I found out that not every link should be clicked. Not every voice needed to be heard, or every thought read. I learned life lessons without ever leaving the safety of my room. But the most important thing I learned was how to pretend to be a boy.  
  
Seems silly, and maybe unimportant to some. But I’ve played games where if I didn’t mute the mic, it would be unbearable. I learned to use stock photos for profiles and gender neutral handles. I learned how to shield myself.  
  
And how to never drop my guard. Even for a second. Because they come so fast, and so relentlessly like sharks that smell blood in the water. To the uninitiated, it feels exciting. All of the attention. But quickly, I learned their tricks, and understood their broader intentions. And their actions became stale, as they were largely unoriginal.  
  
This all stopped the day that I signed up for a new website and decided that I would like to pretend to be someone else for a change. A boy, online.  
  
I signed up, and logged in. And sat there browsing and commenting for nearly an hour before I realized how quiet it was. And carefree. Lonely, even.  
  
See, largely no one cares if you’re a boy online. There are no nice comments, if you’re not outright ignored. And everything else is a battle. Every engagement became a struggle to find the bit of human somewhere. It feels as if everywhere I turned, I was fighting. It’s a world that was both cruel and unyielding.  
  
Which seemed perfect.  
  
I reveled in this chaos for close to a year. Laughing, screaming, arguing, tapping my thumbs until the ends were sore. And not one person tried to slide into my dms.  
But if there were so many predators for girls online. All with their tired and textbook tactics. Then it only made sense that there must have been some out there for boys. Statistically speaking.  
  
Someone dangerous, with a set of rules that I wouldn’t recognize.  
  
It would happen the first week of my summer break. I logged on and saw my notifications had been blown up. Which was unusual since I began pretending to be a guy online. Sure, there would be the occasional 3 or 4 notifications from someone who wrote me a god damned essay about their opposing opinion, but never anything like this. No matter who I pissed off.  
  
In total, I had 32 new notifications waiting for me. And all of them were deplorable.  
  
So my experience started with bullying.  
  
This head ass had found an offhanded comment I made several weeks ago and it looked as if they were so offended at what I said, they went through my entire profile and started attacking all of my other thoughts. It was a form of stalking that I wasn’t accustomed to. And in my anger, I fell for it.  
  
At first I only replied to the comments that affected my core beliefs. And pointing out the blatantly obvious ones that were simply ignorant. But as I went back and forth between tabs, waiting for a reply, my anger got the better of me and I started attacking everything else. Taking a leaf from his tree to see how he liked his own medicine steeped.  
  
I thought I was doing something. Reading and reviewing my comments as I gloated at my own wit.  
  
But the minutes dragged on to hours. And as the day neared its end. I received nothing back in return. Their absence gnawed at me. Or if I were to use a popular internet phrase. Dude lived in my head rent free.  
  
It wouldn’t be until 2:38 A.M. on the second day that I would feel my phone vibrate under my pillow. Groggy and half asleep, I glanced at the glaring screen, but it would be his words that cut my night short.  
  
He had replied. And he had replied in the most asinine, condescending ways possible. It wasn’t even what he wrote, but how he wrote it. As if he were scolding a child or a girl, as I’ve known both, but with the extra layer of male ribbing that threw me into a fit of rage.  
  
For the next 7 hours we would go back and forth. Arguing through breakfast, about anything and everything. No topic was too sensitive, no insult could cut deep enough. And I loathed every moment of it.  
  
I hated it. Hated. Him.  
He was so inexplicably wrong about everything! That he made it easy for me to take the high road in every exchange. Which was unusual for me as I often played the devil’s advocate in order to learn all the different facets of things. And I think he knew that. As he let me grow so unabashedly self-righteous that I became a reluctant teacher.  
  
And slowly, as the days turned into weeks, he began to agree with me. And even slower, I started to realize that his wasn’t a path of destruction, but a cry for help.  
  
I knew firsthand how lonely but vast the internet could feel. It’s like throwing a stone into the everglades. All it can do is drown as carnivorous alligators circle the drop in the water.  
  
Somewhere my anger turned into pity. It’s like how a good book can make the reader feel things. Even if the characters are fake. Because they’re in situations that are easy to imagine. Things that could actually be happening to someone somewhere. If not once upon a time, than to this day.  
  
Then suddenly, he disappeared again.  
  
When he returned. I found him on Instagram.  
  
There were stitches down his arms. His skin was still blue from the swelling but he looked to be healing. After seeing the pictures, a lot of things started to make sense. Things that he had planted early on, started to grow.  
  
For instance, I knew he liked to play mobile games. So I thought. What’s the harm in downloading some, to keep him in good company as he recovered?  
  
I had no clue on how to play his favorite games. But he was a great teacher. For all of his aggressiveness. He was patient, but firm, and gave good advice on how to improve. In less than a month, from his tutoring, I was ranking in ladder with the best of them. He had taught me something new. How to strategize, and what a different kind of person he could be when he was passionate about something.  
  
God. I would be lying if I said that I didn’t eat it up.  
  
It made me want to ask about his other interests. Things that he found worthwhile. And the more I learned from him, the more he became a person.  
  
Three weeks into this back and forth. Daily. He finally posted a new picture. It was the first time that I saw his face. And he was smiling and finally being discharged. At first glance he isn’t what most people would think of as handsome. Not in the way of Harry Styles or Daniel Dae Kim. He was…something else. He was a feeling. Like all of my favorite books. He evoked an emotion. It felt kind of like watching BeWhy sing Lullaby on MnetTV. Such a convoluted and complex mix of emotions that led me to make a lot of mistakes. One after the other. After the other. After the other.  
  
About a week after he had been released, I found out that it was his birthday. I didn’t think he would be on. Didn’t expect him to be, but still I checked. He wasn’t. I figured that his time was preoccupied with friends or family, so I left him a simple message, wishing him a happy birthday. And how I hoped he was having fun.  
  
He didn’t reply, and I tried not to think too much about it. Then somewhere after midnight. He messaged me.  
  
“Thanks,” he wrote. “You’re the only one who remembered.”  
  
I could have cried.  
  
As lonely as the internet could be. I never imagined that it was also his reality. Where were his parents? His friends? A sibling or a cousin. Anyone that cared?  
  
That was the day I told him that I was not who he thought I was. That I was actually a girl. He told me that he didn’t care. And now that I think about it. How easily he brushed it off, as if none of it mattered. Made me feel seen. And served as a turning point for me. He’d make comments, be mean to people we played with online. And I’d give him a pass. I even started making excuses for him when my real friends began asking me why I kept inviting this toxic person into our lobbies.  
  
Soon. Being his friend isolated me.  
  
But at that point I didn’t need anyone else. He was far more interesting than anyone that I had ever met. He gave me so many new things to talk about. So much insight. Like a never ending Wikipedia rabbit hole, down and down we fell, sharing ideas that seemed unlimited.  
  
Eventually the ‘ttyl’ became ‘I wish you were here’. The prodding and jarring texts transformed into unabashed, unrefined, unfiltered paragraphs of sweet sickly things.  
  
We were party watching a 90 day fiancée episode one night when I asked him, “How do these people cope with long distance relationships?”  
  
“How does anyone cope with anything? How do you cope with stuff?”  
  
“I don’t know. I write horror stories. I guess. But I mean. How can someone fall in love with someone else that’s not real. Or, at least. Someone they’ve never seen or touched?”  
  
“You can’t see them. That’s true. Can’t touch them. You can’t even know if you’d like their smell. Or how it feels to stand next to them. What if they’re uglier in real life than their picture? What if they’ve got some quirk that can’t be seen without being face to face? A lot of what if’s right? But don’t you think that’s what makes it real? More real? Falling in love with someone you’ve never met. Don’t you think that’s true love? Because you can only see their soul?”  
  
My fingers trembled.  
  
“I love you.”  
  
I waited.  
  
“I love you too.”  
  
Almost immediately after that we started making plans to meet. It was perfect timing as my mom was going on a business trip in a week. And I had enough money saved for a plane ticket and some expenses. We made so many plans and talked constantly up to the day that I locked the door behind me as I left my house.  
  
In a few short hours I would land.  
  
But he wasn’t there.  
  
I tried calling him, texting him. But he didn’t reply. I was too young to get a hotel and I didn’t want to stand around at the airport anymore. So I got a taxi to the mall that was closest to his house. The one where he said he wanted to work at this summer so that he could come visit me next time. In hindsight I should have tried his address but my pride wouldn’t fully let me commit to showing up unannounced, or unwanted. So I sat in the food court and waited.  
  
I grew angry with myself as I sulked. Angry at myself for being such an idiot. Angry for being stood up. Several times I was prepared to leave. But each time that I thought about it. I didn’t. Because somewhere in the back of my head I kept thinking that he wouldn’t not meet me. He wouldn’t not show up. Something must have happened. Right?  
  
Nick wouldn’t do this to me. I repeated that every 10 or 15 minutes until it started getting dark. We had been talking excitedly right before I boarded even. I mean, it just didn’t make any sense. Why wouldn’t he have ghosted me the day before or something. Why talk to me minutes before I boarded in order to disappear?  
  
It was a bit past 6:00 when I finally got a call from him. I picked it up, angry but relieved that he finally called me back.  
  
“Chels.” He didn’t sound too good. “I’m so sorry.”  
  
“Nick? Where are you? What happened?”  
  
“I got jumped.”  
  
“What? By who? Why? Oh my god. Are you okay?”  
  
“Some guys from school. They saw me buying snacks at the store. One of them got in my face. Another one stole my basket.” I could hear him groaning in pain. “They made fun of me for buying stuff as if I was going on a date. I told them that I was in fact going to meet my girlfriend.” It was the first time I had heard him call me that. “And they called me a liar. I should have just left. But one of them said something about. And I shoved him. The security guard broke it up before anything else happened. So I paid for the stuff and left. But they followed me. I-I only just woke up. Chels. I’m so sorry.”  
  
I can’t describe how I felt. Nor did it matter. He was hurt and for once I could do something about it. I was near. I could be by his side, “Where are you?”  
  
“I’m at the old factory.” I knew that was next to his house. “My head’s bleeding.”  
  
“We should call an ambulance.”  
  
“You know that I can’t.” I knew that his parents were still paying off the debt from the last time he was admitted.  
  
“Can you walk?”  
  
“No. I don’t think so. They got my leg pretty good.”  
  
“Okay,” I decided. “I’m coming to get you. Right now.”  
  
I hailed a taxi and had them take me to the address Nick gave me. When we arrived, I saw that the entire place was surrounded by a chain link fence. The driver didn’t say anything but he gave me a long look. I didn’t care. I paid the meter and got out. He drove away.  
  
I called Nick back, as connection had been spotty and he was feeling dizzy from holding up the phone. It rang. And rang. Each ring feeling like forever in my hand. But he finally picked up.  
  
He sounded worse than before, “Chels? Sorry. I blacked out for a bit.”  
  
“Where are you?”  
  
“Are you alone? I don’t want anyone else seeing me like this. I just want to go home.”  
  
“Where are you?” I started walking faster.  
  
“Are you alone,” he repeated.  
  
“Yes! Nick! Yes, I’m alone. Now where are you?”  
  
“In the blue building. The one with the steel roof.”  
  
I started running when I saw it. The gravel crunching beneath my feet as the world echoed. “Nick!” I shouted. “Nick!” I was nearly out of breath as I entered the blue building. “Nick!”  
  
“I’m here.”  
  
I turned around. Relieved to hear his voice.  
  
The only problem was. The man facing me wasn’t Nick. He wasn’t scrawny or wore a lazy stare. He didn’t have a goofy smile or ears that he would grow into. No, this was a large man. And he was older. Much older. The only thing he did have was Nick’s voice.  
  
“Nick…”  
  
He grinned and then lunged at me.  
  
I was flattened in an instant. All of my fury was useless against his weight as I struggled. All of my anger transforming into fear as I realized how hopeless it would be as he pressed against me.  
  
I couldn’t even scream. I couldn’t even breathe.  
  
“Close your eyes,” Nick’s voice told me. “It’ll be better for you.”  
  
“Why,” I sobbed. “Why?”  
  
His hands never stopped, “Because you replied.”  
  
He tore my clothes. I could feel the gravel sinking into my skin. He ripped my bra. I could feel the cold air on my chest. In an instant he took away the walls I had built over the years. And now he could finally see me completely naked. And helpless.  
  
I had let the wrong one in.  
  
Then, like a new day. A shot rang through the air. It bounced off the bare walls. The man stopped moving. And he looked at me. HIs eyes were wide open. And he looked as if to say something. But all that came out of his mouth was blood. It landed on my face and I choked on it through my nostrils as I struggled to breathe.  
  
“No.” I finally managed. He grabbed my throat. “No!”  
  
Another shot, and he slumped next to me.  
  
I could hear footsteps running towards us. I looked up and saw that it was the taxi driver. His gun barrel still smoking in the cold as he points it at…Nick.  
  
The driver took off his jacket and gave it to me. His pistol still trained on Nick as he called the police. The ambulance arrived first. I saw them start to resuscitate him. I couldn’t believe it. “No! What are you doing? Let him die!”  
  
But he survived.  
  
And I would be forced to relive it  through an entire trial. Watching him sit in that chair as my lawyers kept telling me that justice was going to be served. For 4 months, I was forced to hear our tale unravel from the man with Nick’s voice. He used that voice to defend himself. To read the transcripts. All of our texts and messages. He used it to tell everyone what he did to me. And what he wanted to do. Eventually the man would be sentenced. But I wouldn’t call that justice.
