I won't take up much of your time. I don't know for sure why this happened to me tonight. Just needed to get it out there.

So I just started a new job today. Just administrative stuff in...well, the place doesn't matter, and I don't think telling you exactly where I work will help, really, because what can internet folks do for me anyway?

But I was in the Marisol Hedgepath building, sitting in a cubicle, one of the extra ones not used by staff. Not officially mine, as all I do here is sort the mail in the morning and do customer data entry and make lists into spreadsheets when I'm not off cleaning anything or filing files, yippee, exciting.

My supervisor, Jake, just met him today, is all right. Seems not easily excitable, with a kind of faint smile when talking, the kind that says he'd rather be somewhere more hip and happening but is making the best of his current situation. I mean, this isn't a bad job, pay's above minimum wage and the hours are great. So I feel like maybe he's just waiting for the chance to leap at a whole bigger career.

He has short blond hair that's kind of wild and spiky. This is important, somehow...Christ, I already sound like a loon. And I feel like I'm about to become as extinct as the dodo, even though nothing's really happened yet.

The day was over. It was nearly eight, my clock out time. Only me and Jake left in the building. He told me earlier in the day that one of the required things is to keep my computer turned on until it's at least eight by the clock on the wall, as that's the official closing time, and I might need it, even if it's just sitting around doing nothing.

No, this isn't one of those "I was given a weird rule to follow" posts. It's not *that* abnormal, in my opinion. No, the weird part is, all the computer monitors are CRTs. You know, the big, bulky, old fashioned kind from the 2000s and before. The PC towers and desktops are modern, it's just, the monitors are that older type. They still *look* brand new, though, and are all from the same manufacturer. Who the hell is still MAKING these power hungry pieces of shit?

Anyways, about 7:45, he poked his head around the corner of the cubicle and said he'd be back in a minute, was just going down to use the bathroom and fill his water bottle. Then he was gone. I figured, no problemo, we're both about to be outta here. I turned off my monitor, and got ready to push the power button to start the PC's shutdown.

Then I remembered. I chuckled to myself, then pushed the monitor button to turn it back on. That's right, I realized. Can't turn this off yet. I was kind of just fooling around. When Jake got back, I decided, I'd tell him "oh no! Dude, I accidentally turned it off for five seconds, don't fire me!" He seems like a good humor kind of guy. Probably would get a laugh out of it. I figure it's just some arbitrary thing the bosses all said just to increase, uh...the *appearance* of productivity. That's the ticket.

Except when it turned back on, making that momentary buzzing noise, the screen that came back to me wasn't the Windows 10 desktop. It was a full black screen with a digital clock in the center.

I was mesmerized. How'd they make the computer aware of turning the monitor off to the point that it would start up this clock screensaver? I moved the mouse, but the clock stayed on.

7:46.

Suddenly, from behind me, I heard a slightly high pitched sound, a sort of squeak, like some guy's voice saying a short, quick "eeh" in a funny way. I turned around, expecting to see Jake. It sounded like the type of sound someone would accidentally make while yawning.

But when I looked, nobody was there. In fact, I could still hear the faint sound of Jake's footsteps getting farther and farther away toward the bathroom on the other side of the building.

"Huh." I felt a little unnerved, but I couldn't really tell you why. It could have even been my chair's rotor squeaking a tiny bit. There's plenty of small sounds you occasionally hear, anyplace at all, that you don't think much of, don't know the cause of, and don't really care about. This felt like it should have been one of them.

I turned back to the monitor, telling myself I was being an oddball over nothing. Nobody else was in the building with us.

I moved the mouse again. Nothing happened. I clicked. I pressed a few keys, and even the computer's power key. No software shutdown began.

The clock turned to 7:47 as I watched.

"Ehr."

It was slightly louder this time, not very loud, but enough to startle me, as though it had been the same volume but a little bit closer. I turned around, a little faster than before, and the tiny little thing----you know, that corner of your mind you don't always want to listen to----said that, as I turned my gaze to the big open cubicle doorway behind me, a small pinprick of something, like a little tuft of hair, pulled itself back behind the wall of the cubicle.

I sat frozen for several seconds. I could feel my heart pounding suddenly, and I could hear my pulse in my ears, a terrifying sound that resonated with the anti-nostalgic, childlike fear of approaching rhythmic footsteps in a nightmare you thought you'd forgotten long ago.

Sis, why'd you leave the room? Don't you wanna play with our blocks some more? You're going downstairs? I'm alone suddenly, wait, there's a loud slow thumping coming up the stairs now, like something way too big, I should have followed her, shouldn't have let her get too far out of my sight, she doesn't exist anymore, nobody is in the house except me and some terrible thing coming up the----

*Whoa.* I pulled myself out of that. I have no idea where that phobia fest had suddenly come from. The cubicle doorway suddenly appeared to materialize before me, as though my vision had faded momentarily.

I realized I was panting a little. Not too loud, not too heavy. But breathing kind of hard. Forehead a bit sweaty. I turned around as I wiped it, and saw the clock on the monitor.

It now read 7:50.

"Urrehh."

This was right behind me, inside the cubicle. I hadn't meant to stare at the monitor for more than a few seconds, but now, this throaty, almost funny growling sound, ending in a slight huff, with a bit of a leer to it, as though the person who'd made it was going to laugh in just a second at the silly noise they'd made.

I spun around. Just in time to see the top of a head of slightly spiky, messy blond hair disappear around the wall of the cubicle, so fast that it might have been Sonic the JakeYourAssIsGrasshog.

"Jake!" I growled, getting up and momentarily letting my anger take control. I stepped out of the cubicle and froze, chilled to the bone.

The room we were in went 8x5. Forty cubicles. To the left, the moment I stepped out, I would see the doorway leading into the side hallway that led to the main hall where the elevators were.

There was no doorway. There was no wall. The cubicles continued on and on, stretching for what seemed like eternity. I shakily stumbled forward, grabbing the doorless entryway of the one just to the left of mine, and looked in.

A monitor turned on to a black screen.

7:51.

My cup of hot chocolate sat close by.

They were all MY cubicle. There was no getting out. My cubicle repeated infinitely throughout the room, which by now, I realized, could have been thousands of miles long and wide.

I looked out toward where the doorway should have been again.

The room didn't go like I expected, where you'd think the floor, the cubicles, everything, would eventually fade into the distance miles away as the Earth curved down. Like how you can't see other continents across the ocean. They aren't just too far away, there's nothing where you're *looking.* The water just eventually falls below your vision.

The floor was straight the whole way. The cubicles didn't seem to end, just kept getting infinitely smaller, and far away where the light gray wall should have been...

I don't know what it was. Far, far away, a hundred miles or a million, a dark, foggy looking gray abyss looking thing that might have been the wall. But if it was, it had to be over a hundred thousand stories tall. The ceiling...

I didn't look up. I didn't want to know. I couldn't see it from my current viewpoint, and, hyper-aware of this, I slightly tilted my head down to keep myself from being tempted to look just a bit higher, just a bit more, a bit more...

I slid into the cubicle and sat at the chair shaking. I looked at the monitor.

7:53.

What was this feeling? Why was it like nostalgia, but so tainted, like childhood memories that should have stayed in that box where they belonged?

Why am I in my room, sitting in bed all alone at night with the lights off? The door's cracked open a few inches like usual, it feels like I should be going to sleep, but I hear Mom and Dad talking downstairs. With company, I think. I hear a few voices. All chatting.

But they sound so far away, like we have a hundred stairs going down. The upper hallway's dark. It somehow feels like it isn't bedtime for me yet. I should be down there, where there's people, where it's...

*No. Don't think the word "safe." Don't acknowledge any sense of danger or else it'll become that way.*

It's...not time for bed, right? I should get out. Why aren't I moving? No, of course it isn't because I'm scared. Noise downstairs, normal sounds, but up here right now, quiet as a graveyard, why should I be scared? I hear normal sounds even if they're far away. It's dark here, but Mom and Dad are right down there, nothing could possibly...

Finally my voice breaks open, "Mom! Is it time to go to bed?" Perfectly normal question, right? She'll hear it and answer me, I think.

The voices just drone on, so far away, like across a cafeteria, can't make out what they're saying. She didn't hear me.

"Mom! It's not bedtime yet, right?" No, my voice is NOT shaking.

The voices sound farther away, suddenly, and quieter, like they're murmuring.

"Mom!" I scream, and tears are rolling down my cheeks. "Is it TIME TO GO TO BED YET?"

The voices are gone. Why am I sobbing? "MOOOOM!" Why am I sitting at the edge of my bed, staring up at the tall shelf sitting a few feet away facing the door? I can't see the insides of the shelves, it's facing sideways from my bed.

Why am I holding these things in my hand? What are they? Little spiky things, like those dead gumball things that fall off of trees. In fact, I think that's what they are. I sob louder and drop them clumsily to the floor. I don't know what they're for.

From the top shelf, something dark leans out, about a foot tall, a clump of dark gray, just barely visible in the moonlight pouring in through the window behind me. Just a dark gray clumpy looking thing with heavy folded, wrinkled skin like a rhinoceros, a single dark fold with a black oval is its eye peeking at me, its mouth is a slightly extended, jagged misshapen thing like a stretched-out crab claw.

*"Eehhhrrrr,"* it says, leaning further out, and I scream for Mom again.

"FUCK!" I shrieked as I came out of it suddenly, and my chest was pounding and throbbing, like I was about to have a heart attack. The sound of the word brought me out of the weird momentary vision; a tiny child wouldn't say that word, so it didn't fit. If only I'd had that self awareness seconds ago.

The monitor said 7:58; I was leaning very close to it.

"Eehhhrrrr."

I turned around with my fists balled, feeling like I was about to throw up my fucking ribcage.

A very thin, flat top of slightly spiky blond hair----shorter than Jake's, I realized----a very narrow forehead, and two tiny, dark black holes with white pinpricks for eyes.

I saw it for just the quickest instant as it was pulling itself away from the open cubicle doorway.

I stared at the doorway. Kept staring. *I don't care. I'm not looking at the monitor again. It's almost eight. This will end at eight, won't it?*

Suddenly...in and out. Again. The head very, very quickly peeked right around the cubicle entryway, just a quick peep, just enough for me to see those black hole eyes again with the white pinpricks staring right at me.

It peeked and immediately pulled back again, all in a quarter of a second.

Several seconds went by.

It peeked again and pulled back again. Really fast.

It peeked again. "Eeh," it squeaked slightly as it pulled back, still just as fast.

It kept happening, every ten to fifteen seconds, for what I KNEW was at least three minutes. Was it seriously past eight?

Or did I have to look at the monitor again to make it go to the next minute?

"Eeh." It peeked, and there were no white pinpricks in its eyes this time.

I slightly began to turn my head, without taking my eyes off the doorway.

Wait...wait for it...wait...

"Eeh."

I turned and glanced at the monitor very quickly.

7:59.

"Eeh."

I spun my head around again. It wasn't peeking any farther out, but it was there. Disappearing again in a flash.

*Don't lose consciousness again. Don't do it. Don't black out. Don't remember it...don't remember anything else...it was so long ago...it doesn't matter...it can't have anything to do with what's happening right now, it can't...it's just because the feeling of fear is similar to back then, that's the only reason I'm remembering...*

"Eeh."

Peek----gone.

Suddenly, there was a *click* behind me. I turned around in surprise----in time to see the Windows 10 desktop. The icons began disappearing. The taskbar flickered away. The mountains in the background vanished, replaced by that cool blue default color.

*Windows is shutting down...*

The spinny circle thing...

"Eeh."

I whirled around.

Jake stood there. His hand up to his mouth. Yawning. "Eeh----ehh----oooh. *Man,* I can't wait till Friday. I get off early. I'm gonna go out to Golden Corral instead of straight home and dump my ass in bed." He grinned sheepishly at me. "Not really a night owl, you know?"

His smile faded slowly. "Colin? Are you...okay?"

Who was that behind him, several cubicles away at the far end of the room? With long black hair, grayish skin, and...those sad little eyes...

*Sis...*

Staring at me so pleadingly.

*Brynnie...I'm sorry...it wasn't me though...I didn't do it to you...I should have followed you downstairs that day...I didn't know it was real, I didn't know it would get you...I mean, it's only a foot tall when you're LOOKING at it, except in SOME of the nightmares...I...I had no idea...I thought I was just having another dream, I didn't know it was real...*

She stared at me from far away, her lip trembling. At least I could see her whole face. Seeing only something's eyes, not the nose and mouth, was super unnerving to me, and I don't know why.

She vanished. Only then did I realize Jake had turned and was looking that way too. "Something over there?" He turned to look back at me.

"No," I sighed, trying to keep my voice from shaking. I stood up.

*It's not over.*

"It's just, I...I was remembering something, that's all."

I started to walk out of the cubicle, and he fell into step to my right. We turned left, toward the doorway just up ahead, and walked toward the side hall.

"And someone."

We walked into the hall, heading for the main passage with the elevators. I could practically feel Jake's eyebrow raising in confusion without even looking at him.

"From a really long time ago."

She didn't appear, but her small, cold hand slipped into my left. She squeezed softly, asking the same question she always had.

I squeezed back, giving my usual sad answer.

I thought I could hear a quiet sniffle and a muffled sob before her grasp faded from mine.

*I'm sorry Brynnie. Not yet. Maybe some day.*
