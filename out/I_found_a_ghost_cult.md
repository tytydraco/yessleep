I had recently lost my dad to cancer. We had gone through years of chemo and radiation that left him in such an unrecognizable state that my kids were scared to visit him. It wasn’t how he looked, they didn’t care about that. It was the change in mood. 

He would sometimes be irritable, which caused him to lash out at whoever was near, regardless of who it was. It was erratic and would come in bursts after being somewhat jovial. He would then forget that he acted like that, then be loving to the people he mistreated. 

His eyesight became really bad, as he had developed thick cataracts, so he would often mistake you for someone else, someone he loathed, probably from his younger days, as I didn’t know who he was talking about. Maybe it was just the nurses who would have to put up with him day by day. I’m not sure. It always took him a long time to understand what the doctors wanted him to do for them. 

I’m pretty sure he forgot that he had cancer in the first place and decided that the people who were trying to help were keeping him hostage. I don’t know how much of it was from the treatments or dementia, but they piled on each other that made it difficult for me to be there, even without my kids.

He finally died at the ripe old age of eighty-four. It sadly became a relief for me. I know my children felt the relief, even by proxy of the weight being lifted from my shoulders. I heard one of them say, “He’s becoming our dad again.”

That messed me up for a long time. Was I not there enough for them while he was in the hospital?

After he died, I got a letter in the mail that read: You can speak to them again, if only for closure.

It named my father: first, middle, and last name, the age he died, and which hospital he was cared for at.

I barely knew all that information, why did they?

It also had an address. I looked it up on the internet, and there was nothing of note. It just looked like a building you would pass by on the road. It was well kept. The lawn care was phenomenal. There were trimmed bushes, decorative trees, and a garden full of local wildflowers mixed with orchids and roses. Stuff like that.

I was told to just bring the letter as admittance, and I would be greeted in the lobby.

The sting of his funeral service still plays in my head. His family and friends showed up with beautiful memories before his diagnosis, but they never truly experienced his end like I did. We didn’t make the mental deterioration public. They didn’t need to know that. I didn’t hide my tears. I think it’s good for children to see that side of you. Know that it’s okay to grieve when you’re sad. I want them to know the emotions they feel are real and should be addressed but not hidden. I held them in my arms as their extended family reminisced about grandpappy. They had a few memories of him too, and gratefully spoke in their little voices that made it even more devastating. 

Throughout the funeral, the letter stayed in my mind, with all those memories. A question lingered in the back of my mind: “Can I get this version of him back?”

It was a few weeks of questioning myself before I made a decision. I kept the letter on my dresser, but never told the kids what it was. Not that it interested them, it was just a piece of paper. I never hid it from them, but I also never brought it up. It was a constant reminder of my dad. Of his memory. I had thought about it constantly, to the point of my kids worrying about me.

Their questions made my decision for me. I asked my sister if they could watch the kids for a couple of weeks, telling her I needed a break. Our kids got along wonderfully, and I was the major caretaker for our dad before he passed. She was there, but as the older brother, I wanted to keep this memory of him away from her. Which I think she was thankful for, but I never pressed and neither did she. I kept the letter from her, though. I don’t know why.

The maps didn’t lie about how the place looked. It was just as beautiful as it looked on the internet. The sweet, floral scent floated in the air as butterflies lapped at the wildflowers nearby. I sat on a bench near the entrance for maybe thirty minutes or so, staring at the letter as people entered and left. Normal people. They even looked happy, or at least putting up a front. That did make me question if the letter was real. Would people act like this for what the letter promised? They were dressed casually, like they were going to the store.

Ultimately, I pushed through the door and was met with a receptionist with a kind smile. She asked what they could help me with, and I silently handed over the letter. Her smile widened, and she expressed with genuine gratitude, my welcome. She asked to make a copy of my ID for future entrance, and a good phone number to contact me by. I hesitated for just a second, but provided both. She said I could use either to come inside at any time. Didn’t even give hours.

After I signed the copy with my ID and phone number, she spread her arm towards a door behind her. The room’s lights were a soft, pale orange, and there was a faint aroma of the same flowers we had at his funeral. I almost walked out. A man sat on a leather chair in front of a full library of old books and lush greenery. He was adorned in business casual with an easy smile. He gestured toward a plush couch saying, “Hello, my name is Mike. I am the grief counselor for this establishment. Please. Sit.”

I answered, “Hello, Mike. I’m Paul.”

“Hello, Paul. It’s nice to meet you. May I ask who you’ve lost?”

“I lost my father not too long ago. He passed from cancer and dementia. The end was rough, he-”

“Please, let’s remember the good times.” He interrupted, “It helps in the long run. It’ll make everything easier for you and your father.”

“So it’s true? What the letter said?”

“Of course, Paul. We seek to soothe the pains of the living by giving them access to those who left us behind.”

“How do you do that?”

“It would be easier to show you.” He answered, “Please, lie down.”

I did as he said.

“Now, think of your father. Your favorite memory of him. That will be the catalyst.”

The memory I chose was of him signing over custody to my children from my drug-addled other sister. I see them as my own, despite being my niece and nephew. Their biological father died from an overdose and my sister is in prison for armed robbery. She stole my dad’s pistol and used it to rob a gas station to get high. My kids were too young to remember any of it, so they see me as their dad.

“Okay. Keep that memory in your mind. See his prideful smile. Smell his oaky cologne as he signs over Kelly and Cameron.”

“Dad?” He stood before me in his jean jacket and khaki pants. Grinning down at me with an arm raised for me to grab. He looked just like he did then. So full of life. So much gratitude for me taking the kids on.

“Let’s go pick up Cameron and Kelly. They’re waiting for you at the hospital.” He said.

Then he faded into the air. His grasp lingered on my hand. He had felt so real. I slept soundly in a hotel, not daring to go back home. I wasn’t sure why I took a room. I had felt at peace for the first time in years.

I had called my kids to see how they were doing. They told me they went to the beach with aunt Carol. They played in the waves and made the biggest sand castle ever, then smashed it down with all their might. I wondered, “Could dad bring them to the beach?” but also, “Would that confuse them?” I could attempt to explain it.

After the call, I thanked my dad for them.

Then the next day, I went back. I had to.

The same receptionist greeted me with the same kind smile. She said, however, “Mike is not here today, but you are welcome to go into the main room.” She gestured towards another door where others were freely entering and leaving. She never checked my ID, which I still think was odd. But the others weren’t asked for theirs either. So I went along with it.

The room was comfortable with lounge chairs, large windows that let in the warm morning light, a full spread of breakfast set on a table against the wall, and people disappearing to rooms at the end of the room. A man greeted me, saying that I could use the rooms at the end for the persons I lost. I grabbed a plate and some food, not having eaten, and thought of what he said. Persons. As I sat there eating, I had the thought, “Can I summon more than just my father?”

A sign caught my eye. It read: “Less suffering for all. We will open twenty-four new facilities across the country, and nine internationally. Tell your family now!”

After I finished eating, I steeled myself then stepped into a vacant room.

The room was equally as beautiful as Mike’s office, but without a window. I did as I remembered, guided along by visual instructions painted on the wall.

“Hello, father.” I said, admiring his presence. He had the same khaki pants as before.

“Hello, son.” He smiled. “You are welcome to join us whenever you like. You can also bring Kelly and Cameron. They would enjoy the afterlife as much as I do. Coming back is wonderful.”

We reminisced about old times. Peaceful times. I stayed with him for three hours before leaving. I took a photo of the sign, but it disappeared after I left the building.

I think that really was my dad. It really did seem like him, even though I buried him myself. Threw dirt onto his casket as they lowered it into the earth. Laid flowers next to his gravestone.

I looked it up, and some of the new facilities are already open. I don’t think anyone should enter them, but at the same time, I still want to see him again. That makes my heart race. He wants to see the kids again, and I’m tempted to bring them. I’m worried that if I see them, I will take them there. I don’t know what to do anymore.
