It all started a month ago on 16/02/2023. I woke up on 8:30 as usual, i brushed my teeth, and dressed up to go to work. While i was preparing a quick breakfast, i noticed something off outside. There were a few military trucks and jeeps passing through the street. Normally i would brush this off as something normal however the nearest military base that i know of is 150 kilometers away. Still, i ignored it. Ate my breakfast and entered my car to go to work.

While on the road i decided to listen to some music and opened the radio. Usually there was cheerful music or the weather broadcast on the radio however, it was just static. Weird, i thought to myself. The radio channels here rarely went down.

I parked in the parking lot of the building i worked in and just as i entered the elevator i got a text message. It was from my boss telling everyone that work was cancelled. "Finally i can rest for a little bit." i said to myself before entering my car.

As i was driving on the road i was driving 15 minutes ago, i saw what i thought was another military convoy in the distance. This whole day felt off. Still i could be overreacting and that could be the same convoy that i saw earlier. While i was driving i saw a few military guys setting up perimeters around the town entrance in the distance. I started getting really creeped out. What was going on?

I parked my car on the driveway of my house and headed inside. I decided to watch tv since there was nothing else to do. While i was watching a documentary about cryptids i accidentally changed the channel to the news broadcast. I was bored so i deciced not to change it back and nothing caught my attention until i heard the broadcaster say:  
"There have been reports of heavy military activity around the Mainland United States, these reports are mainly from rural areas such as suburban towns and small villages. A video sent to us shows a few soldiers putting up barricades blocking access to the entrance of a national park and the video ends with a soldier stopping the person from recording the video. The government has not made a public statement about the situation yet."

As the broadcast ended, i heard a knock on my door. When i opened it i saw a person dressed in military tactical gear wearing a gas mask. Before i could ask what was going on, they said:

"Stay indoors if possible, there has been a gas leak in the nearby area. Do NOT exit your house after 6pm, a curfew was placed to keep citizens safe. Close your curtains after 6pm."

And before i could ask anything, they pushed me back and closed the door before i could even get up. I didnt understand the last part, why would we need to close the curtains if it was a gas leak? Still, even tho it sounded like bullshit i decided to listen to the "soldier" that knocked on my door.

This was the night it all went to hell. I woke up on 2:33 AM to gunshot and explosion sounds outside. I was too scared to get out of the bed. I heard someone yelling "ANOTHER ONE! SHOOT IT QUICKLY BEFORE IT CAN DO ANYTHING!" and a few gunshots after that. I didnt sleep after that, i stayed in my bed motionless for the whole night until 9 am. The sounds stopped at 4 AM but i didnt have the courage to get out of bed.

After i shakily got out of bed i peeked out the window to see, a bloodbath. There were alot of heavy machine guns dropped on the asphalt and a lot of dead bodies, i think they were soldiers. I blocked the door with a huge table while i desperately tried to call 911 to no avail. The phone lines were down or there was noone to pick it up. I remembered that i had a few cameras installed around my house so i reluctantly went to check the footage out. What i saw, made my blood run cold. I could see a few people in tactical gear shooting someone or something offscreen. Then i saw it, there was a huge claw type limb reaching out from the forest grabbing the soldiers head and squishing it like it was a balloon. I couldnt continue watching it.

I stayed in the house for the next 19 days until i ran out water. While i was inside, i couldnt hear anything from the outside. No people, no cars, not even birds chirping. When i decided to go out to get some water, i grabbed my M9 pistol with me incase something was out there. I ran to my car as fast i could thinking something was going to grab but, there was nothing. While i was driving to the store i saw cars flipped over, and a few houses destroyed. I expected there to be people and soldiers in the downtown area but there was **noone**. Not even a dead body. However i did see alot of abandoned cars. When i got to the store, just like the downtown area there wasnt anybody in it. The streets were devoid of people. Either all the people were inside or they somehow disappeared. There were no signs of those thing i saw in the camera either. It was like every living being just disappeared into thin air. I grabbed as much water and food as i can and ran back to my car.

As i was driving in the "abandoned" city, i had an idea. I could check to see if people were inside hiding somewhere. So i grabbed my M9 pistol that i brought with me and went to the first house that i saw. The door was unlocked. I slowly entered the house to find nobody inside. The bathroom door was locked so i tried to kick the door down and i somehow did. There was something written on the wall with blood, the blood seemed relatively fresh. The writing said "cover windows after sunfall". What the fuck was going on? I searched a few more houses to find no people. Not even animals. I drove back to my home and barricaded all the windows with what i could find. I had food and water that would last me for weeks. After the sun set i could hear this weird type of buzzing sound outside. I didnt have the courage to check the camera to see what it was. After 6:34 AM, the noises stopped.

After the noises stopped, i decided to drive to the downtown area to see if there were any signs of people or any animals. I checked a few houses but there was nothing. One of the houses seemed to be inhabited very recently, there were empty bottles of water and a few cans of food on the floor but no sign of a person.

After i got back home i found an old radio that was still working and i decided to see if there was anything on the radio. The only thing i got was a weird beeping sound, there were 3 short beeps and 3 longer ones after that, and at the end were 3 more shorter beeps playing on loop. I think it was morse code, i am not sure.

I do not know why i am writing this, since i could be the last living thing on the planet except for those fucking things that killed everyone. If someone is somehow reading this, i am in the town of  Swindmore in Iowa. I will be at the town centre everyday at 9 AM. Those fucking things killed off the entire town or possible even the whole world, the last television broadcast was 4 days before the electricty cut off and it was about serial disappearences all over Europe and North America. I will be at the town centre everyday at 9 AM, if i am not there i have probably died. 22/03/2023.
