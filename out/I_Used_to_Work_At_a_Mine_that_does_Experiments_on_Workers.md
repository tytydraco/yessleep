I was debating on telling this story as I wasn’t sure if anyone would believe me, but at least I don’t have an NDA holding me back. So fuck it; I’m going to share my story about my last job that I did the previous year. Since there is so much to unpack, this will be multiple posts overtime. I used to work at a mine for a company recently.   
  
The job paid pretty well and they had a good health plan, so I was quick to jump on it while it was still available. My job was to manage security and surveillance of the mining site, so it was mostly looking at cameras and occasionally wandering the grounds. It was a live-in job like on one of those oil rigs in the middle of the ocean so it was a type of gig where you had a room included.   
  
My first day was pretty normal; I got to the mine along with the rest of the staff early in the morning. It was going to be my home for the next three months. When I got there, I went to see my office and the tiny bedroom behind it. Inside the bedroom was a bunk bed, so I assume one guy was going on surveillance during the day and I’d probably take night shift.   
  
When I put all my stuff down in the room, another person came into the surveillance room; a round guy who looked like he had been used to taking these sorts of jobs. You know, someone who has experience in the art of Sitting Down. No greetings were exchanged, he simply said,   
  
“Name’s Kovacs. You want day or night shift?”  
  
“Night shift.”  
  
Kovacs simply nodded and got behind the desk, and I got to start my day by taking a nap and having some late breakfast. The on-site cafeteria was grueling to say the least; watered down ass-coffee and jaundiced half-burnt eggs and toast. It was like eating styrofoam and sawdust. After managing to stomach that down, I went back to my bunk room and went to sleep.   
  
I woke up to a dark room and Kovacs lightly kicked the side of the bed before going up the top bunk. I was still groggy, but I guess it was time for my shift. In my haze, I stumbled out and behind the desk. It was going to be eight hours of looking at screens. The night started out okay; a lot of nothing mostly. It was only at the 1AM mark that things got weird.   
  
One of the screens, I saw that a truck was pulling up to the front of the site. Maybe it was from the company, I thought. Out of the truck came a bunch of military guys and a suit walking inside. I was feeling tired earlier, but now I was gripped with attention. The suit and their entourage went into the site laboratory. You may be wondering; why does a mine have a laboratory? What are they mining?   
  
Those questions shall be answered in a moment, don’t worry. There was no camera in the laboratory so I decided to grab a flashlight from the desk and walk out of the office, sneaking towards the lab door. I didn’t think going in was smart so I instead listened through the door. Here’s what I heard:   
  
Suit: So, doctor, what’s the status of the operation?  
  
Doc: The miners had reached the substance deposit. We collected a sample and had the first responder help with some testing.   
  
Suit: Hopefully there’s enough in the deposit to refine it. Where’s the test subject?  
  
Doc: Right here, miss.   
  
Miner: Hey, doc, why am I strapped?  
  
Doc: All part of the process, sir. You’ll only feel a pinch…  
  
I would go on but after this, the guy just starts screaming and cursing as the doctor did whatever he did to him. Then I heard the sound of crunching and squelching, as if someone’s bones were cracking. Their screams were becoming… inhuman. That’s the only word I can describe it. It was like a cross between a human and an animal. I then heard the suit and the doc begin to panic.   
  
Suit: Will the restraints hold?  
  
Doc: Not indefinitely. I have prepared a tranquilizer after last experiment’s results.   
  
I then heard the sound of metal bending and finally snapping before the suit began to shout orders and all hell broke loose. Whatever was inside began to wreck whoever else was inside as I could hear gunfire and ripping of flesh inside. I decided to run towards my office but I caught a glimpse of what was inside behind me.   
  
It was deformed, bubbly, and looked like it had scabs all over. It looked vaguely human, but so much was wrong. The bubbles all over their body was filled with a sickly green fluid and their mouth looked like a maw of teeth over teeth. It shrieked as it was running behind me and I scrambled to find the office. I swear it took me what felt like an hour to reach the surveillance office, mostly because I was trying to lose my tail.   
  
When I finally reached it, I slammed the door shut and leaned against it. I guess I was hoping that it would either forget me or that it was enough to keep it from getting in. I could hear it coming close from the other side of the door, but I jolted from the sudden BANG coming from one of the military dude’s piece. There was then a wet thud and footsteps approaching. I hear the guy say into his radio,   
  
“Target eliminated. Commencing disposal procedures.”  
  
I let out a sigh as I heard the military guy drag that carcass down the hall. How was I supposed to sleep now. Fuck. I went back to the desk and saw the guy dragging it out of site building and loading it onto the truck. Some schmuck from the site staff was tasked to mop up the shit, but both the suit and the doctor watched them. I assumed the suit would fuck off onto the truck or the doc would go back into the lab.   
  
It was only when they finished cleaning that the suit took the mop guy with her to the truck before leaving. That was when I realized that I couldn’t let them find out I had gotten wise just yet. The doctor went back to the lab, and I was left to sit there and process what I just witnessed. These guys left no witnesses; the miner who found the substance deposit, and the janitor who cleaned up the bile.   
  
The next day went as normal. Kovacs got behind the desk while I had shitty eggs and toast. Instead of going straight to bed after breakfast, I was left thinking what last night meant. Was it just a weird dream? Was the company hiding something? That kept me up for a while and whenever I was on my shift, I’d have a cup of that ass-coffee at my desk to keep me awake. Hopefully some people are interested in my story about my weird job experience. Let’s hope I don’t get silenced by some company goon in the future.
