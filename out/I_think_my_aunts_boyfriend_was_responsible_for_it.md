For privacy, I’m going to change the names in this story: my aunt will be “Debby,” her boyfriend “Ricardo,” her ex-husband “Rick,” and her granddaughter “May.” My aunt passed away a few years ago, and I can’t stop thinking about everything that happened—especially the things we learned afterward.

Before Ricardo, Debby had all her kids with her ex-husband Rick. They divorced years ago but stayed on good terms. But when Ricardo came into her life, things never felt right.

I try not to judge people by their looks, but sometimes it’s hard not to. Ricardo was creepy-looking—he had some missing teeth and just gave off this weird vibe. He’d say little things here and there that rubbed me the wrong way, but the biggest issue was how controlling he was with my aunt.

They had a stand at the local flea market that my parents would visit every weekend. I’d usually stay and help them out, but every time, I noticed how he wouldn’t let her talk to male customers or even longtime vendors she’d known for years. He was always hovering, keeping an eye on her, and getting mad over nothing.

The last time I went to their stand, I saw something I’ll never forget. I walked by their white truck and caught Ricardo grabbing Debby’s wrist—hard, like he was about to throw her to the ground. He froze when he saw me, then said in this cold, scary tone, “If you tell your dad, you won’t come to see Debby anymore.”

I was just a kid, and that threat terrified me. I didn’t want to lose time with my aunt, so I stayed quiet. But after that, I stopped going to their stand altogether. My parents still went to the flea market, but I always avoided being around Ricardo.

Fast forward to when I was 19, and my aunt got a cancer diagnosis. It hit all of us hard. As her condition worsened, we saw her less and less. I always felt like it was because of Ricardo—like he didn’t want us around her.

One day, I overheard him and my dad arguing on the phone about her treatment. I didn’t catch everything, but it sounded like Ricardo was leaving her alone while he went out and didn’t think it was his responsibility to stay and care for her since they weren’t married. It made me furious, but there wasn’t much I could do.

Eventually, my aunt passed away. I remember coming home from the gym and hearing the news from my mom. We planned a trip to Fresno, where she lived, to figure out her burial and other arrangements. When we got there, her daughters told my dad something weird—Ricardo hadn’t been seen since her death.

When they went to Debby’s house, they noticed something strange. A lot of her medicine bottles were still half full, like they hadn’t been used as often as they should have been. And the safe where Debby kept her cash savings? It was gone. Multiple calls to Ricardo went unanswered, and we decided to leave it until the next day.

The next morning, Ricardo was suddenly standing on the porch. He was crying, saying he’d been “going through a hard time” and couldn’t answer anyone. Part of me wanted to believe him, but something about it didn’t sit right. How could he just vanish like that and leave Debby’s daughters to handle everything?

Later, my dad asked him about the safe. Ricardo swore he didn’t know about it and said, “If I took the money, why would I come back?” He refused to talk about it anymore.

The next morning, as we were preparing to leave, my dad got a call from Ricardo. He confessed that he had taken the money but claimed he used it for Debby’s medical expenses. He said he didn’t want to tell anyone because it “belittled his manhood” to admit he couldn’t financially support her. I still didn’t believe him. If that was the truth, why not just say so from the start?

A week later was her funeral. It was a sad day for all of us, but Ricardo didn’t seem upset at all. He didn’t shed a tear or even look like he cared. I tried to tell myself that maybe people grieve differently, but it felt off.

After the service, we went to Debby’s house to eat and celebrate her life, as is common in Mexican culture. I was sitting with my cousin (Debby’s daughter) when she told me something that sent shivers down my spine.

The week we were at the house, during the campfire, she went to Ricardo’s shed to grab firewood. Something told her to snoop around. In the corner, under a blanket, she found candles, herbs, and a picture of May—Debby’s granddaughter. My cousin didn’t want to stick around long enough to figure out what it was for, but she was freaked out.

Hearing that made everything click. Ricardo always acted strange around May. She didn’t like him, and I remember times he’d force her to sit on his lap while she cried, clearly uncomfortable. I couldn’t help but wonder what he was doing with that picture. What kind of sick ritual was going on in there and did he do the same thing with my aunt. Why would he want such a young girl to like him so much? I didn’t know what it was, but knew it was fucking weird.

After the funeral, we cut ties with him. I told my mom what my cousin found, but I didn’t tell my dad. He’s the kind of person who would’ve gone after Ricardo, and I didn’t want things to escalate.

It’s been two years, but I still can’t stop thinking about it. Was Ricardo not giving Debby her medicine frequently? Why was he so controlling about who could visit her? What was the deal with the safe? And what was in that shed?

I don’t know what to make of it, but something about Ricardo was never right.
