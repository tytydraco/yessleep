Long post 
Okay please keep in mind I wanted to post this in glitch in The matrix but realized you can't do dream post. I'm still super shaken up about this but I'm going to try to explain with as much detail as I can. My daughter is 6mo old and such a sweet happy girl. About 2 weeks ago we laid her down in her plush sheep pajamas and we gave her her kisses good night, and sang I love you forever. We were watching the new Garfield movie as we drifted off. Well at some point as my daughter was sleeping in her bedside bassinet I woke up to her convulsing and struggling to breathe. It was around 2:30 in the morning.

 I remember letting out a scream that I don't think I'll ever forget. My husband woke up and we called for an ambulance they said it would take 10 minutes. Well we know that we are about 8 minutes from the hospital so we buckled her up as quickly as possible and made it there in about half the time. 

When I went to pick her up out of her car seat she was cold and had foam coming from her mouth. We rushed into the ER and they quickly took action and started working on her lifeless little body. A lot of events after this were a blur but  I remember them trying and trying to save my daughter's life and she did not make it. The time they called her death was approximately 3:17am. 

I remember the car ride home. It was so silent and lonely even with my husband sitting right beside me we couldn't turn the radio on we couldn't talk all we could do was sit silently and cry hoping the nightmare would end. I remember the first few days at home alone. I didn't have my baby to take care of. I just slept all the time hoping for some kind of escape hoping to see my daughter again. 
Life kept going on. It kept going on without her. The only things I could do besides plan her funeral were necessary functions. 

 Her funeral was scheduled for the week after she had passed. It was so beautiful but it was also a nightmare. I had to speak in front of all my family and friends about the one thing I was trying to avoid. She was carried in one of those beautiful glass princess carriages with 2 horses pulling her, and she was laid to rest in a beautiful sunrise coffin engraved with her name and pictures of our little happy family on it. I remember my Adopted mom crying and screaming with me as they lowered her into the ground. That was her first grandbaby.

I remember going home to the same empty feeling and just not wanting to live. I know my husband was struggling too but he wouldn't talk to me. Anytime he had anything to say he yelled at me. We didn't eat unless we were starving and then we would grab something small straight from the pantry. Even though we were giftet several 100 dollars worth of gift cards for doordash. Even though people had stocked our fridge with easy home cooked meals.How could we eat properly when we had just started introducing foods to our daughter?!? We were both completely and utterly broken. About 5 days after her funeral I decided I needed to be with her again. I decided to shoot myself....

Then I woke up... I WOKE UP to my husband shaking me while I waited and had tears streaming down my face. My daughter was once again by my side (in her little pink pajamas), It was around 1:20am and Home(that cute little alien movie was playing). My husband tried to get me to talk to him but I literally couldn't I was frozen. I stared at my daughter for literally 5 hours. Then I realized something strange I KNOW I went to sleep with Garfield playing on the TV. I woke up and home was playing. The miniscule thing I'm hung up on is the fact my Netflix is not set to play another movie after the finished movie and never has before it only shows previews. I KNOW it was playing Garfield when we went to sleep.

I'm super paranoid that I'm still dreaming or something. Having severe anxiety and I can still literally remember everything so I have some PTSD that I'm hoping goes away. I don't know what happened if it was just a simple dream that lost grip on time or if it was something totally different. But I'm so grateful to have another opportunity with my child. I know I didn't really lose my child. But I now know the grief of it I lived it for multiple weeks within the span of 2 hours. Please hold your babies, your children, and anyone you love super tight.
I hope this is the right group for this.
