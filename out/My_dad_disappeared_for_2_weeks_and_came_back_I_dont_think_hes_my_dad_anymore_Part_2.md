I felt great pain as my legs hit the ground. Even with all that pain, I still carried myself up and tried to run as hard I could. I began to run with a limp as I heard the demon let out an ear piercing screech.

I knew my life was over, I knew that he'd jump out the window and land straight on me, but surprisingly, I heard him running out of my room

So he's afraid of heights then?

I said to myself

I still knew that he wanted me dead and that he'd eventually run out our front door and kill me, I kept on running until I reached the house next street. I banged on the door as hard I possibly could until an old man answered

What are you doing at such a late time, bo-

MOVE!!!

Hey! What's gotten into you, Davey?!

Mr. Matthews, please just close the door. I'll explain.

I'm not doi-

CLOSE THE DOOR!!!

He eventually complied.

You'll probably think I'm crazy, but my parents were arguing, and my da-

IM GONNA CALL CPS IF YOU DON'T LET MY SON OUTTA THERE YOU OL-

Mr. Matthews, please don't li-

What's going on, Abraham?

Oh Lord. I thought he wasn't married... it's gonna be a bloodbath in here!

I decided to go back to running, I ran out of the house via the back door as I heard Mr. Matthews let the demon in the house.

I felt like a horrible person as I heard Mr. Matthews and his wife get torn to shreds by that devil. As I ran, I felt as if I was a murderer. I technically caused their deaths after all. Going into their house is an action that still haunts me to this very day.

I'm ashamed to say it, but the death of the Matthews bought me some time, as the demon was eating them, I managed to get a bit far away from the house. I eventually found a man and his family driving back home, I stopped the man and explained my situation. He surprisingly believed me. The man went to his house, which luckily was a bit far from where the demon was. He dropped off his family then drove to the airport where he parked his car and got me on a flight to Kansas. He knew I couldn't survive alone, so he decided to come with me. He got me an apartment and a certain amount of money each month to spend on food. He came to visit every once in a while until he and his family eventually moved to Manhattan and adopted me.

I finally had people whom I can call "parents" again, I finally had a family again.

My life went on normally, I graduated college, got a job, moved out, and got married. I had children of my own and would occasionally visit my family every now and then. My adoptive father died back in 2012, then my mother followed in 2014. I still mourn their loss to this day. But I didn't write all this to keep people up at night...

 3 days ago, I got a call from one of my siblings about a man who broke into their home. I asked if I should come over, but he assured me that they'd be fine and that he had already called 911 and the police are on their way, on top of that him and his son were both armed. His phone was about to die, so I told him to stay safe before hanging up.

I was worried sick that night. I barely put myself to sleep.

I woke up the next morning to my son calling me, I went to see what he wanted when much to my dismay... my worst nightmare had come true.

DAD!!! UNCLE SAM IS DEAD!! HE'S DEAD!!!!

I almost dropped dead on the floor as he said that

WHAT DO YOU MEAN DEAD?!

I ran over to him, and I saw TV on and the news reporter talking about a deadly burgler that ended the lives of a family of 5.

I turned the T.V off as I broke down crying. My brother and his entire family were wiped in the blink of an eye, not going to his house that night might be the biggest mistake of my life! 

I eventually stopped crying as my family comforted me. I went on with my day and contacted a funeral service to arrange my brother's funeral.

The next morning I went to the morgue to see his body, it was... mutilated, his eyes were popped, his hands were cut off and a massive smile was carved onto his face. I feared that my father, or the demon that possessed him might still be alive, what if it found me?

I was prepared to move out right after the funeral which was supposed to happen on Saturday, the 16th of this month.

Worried sick, I was forced to go on with my day. Eventually night came and I went to bed, I woke up to my daughter's voice today morning

DAD! Someone is at our front porch, he says he wants to see you.

I got out of bed and went to our front door, my fears were confirmed as I looked through our ring camera.

I saw my father, he still looked the exact same as he did 45 years ago, I told my daughter to barricade the door and hide in the master bedroom, I woke my whole family up and told them to hide.

I already called 911 and can hear him breaking down our front door as I'm writing this
