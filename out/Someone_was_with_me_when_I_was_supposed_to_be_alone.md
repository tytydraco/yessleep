Okay, So I really don't know how to tell or share this personal experience of mine but I'll just quickly get to the point. (TW: ALOT of grammar mistakes)

I remember around 2022 or 2023, It was school week. So of course me and my mom had to wake up early to prepare and stuffs. I remember one day, me and my mom woke up for school ugh, and decided to go to the bathroom when my mom gave out a shriek and rushed to wake up my dad, she went like "Wake up, wake up! The toilet's leaking and if you don't fix this the entire room is gonna flood!". She wasn't overreacting at that part though cause I also saw it with my own eyes and the water was like spraying and squirting EVERYWHERE. Of course my dad had to rush in the bathroom and like inspect and try to fix it. 10 minutes later, my dad fixed it so me and my mom sighed in relief. So my mom went down to prepare and acted like our room wasn't just seconds from getting flooded away while my dad fixed the toilet he jammed up to fix, while I fixed my bed. I remember hearing those noisy metal sounds and my dad's morning burps (Im so sorry dad) and his heavy breathing and heavy footsteps. When I was done fixing the bed I went downstairs to eat breakfast.

I remember when I was just two steps away to the first floor when I suddenly stopped and my entire body froze. My eyes were staring at our front door (The one where we go in and out) and, somehow, there was someone outside our front door walking around. I, of course, panicked and was like "OH MY GOD. AN INTRUDER? WHY IS THERE A PERSON INFRONT OR OUR FRONT DOOR?? WHO IS THIS?? IN THE MIDDLE OF 4AM?? AM I GONNA GET KIDNAPPED? DOES HE HAVE A GUN? ARE WE GONNA DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE????????????????????????" Yep, I panicked so bad to the point my brain function shutted down.

My mom was like at the kitchen, cooking my lunch for school when she saw me standing there like someone freezed me. "Honey? What's wrong?" She asked. When I didn't respond for like a minute she started to worry and ran to me and shook my body because she realized that I was SOOO pale. My eyes were glued at our front door when I suddenly pointed at the front door and said: "Who is that?". I think those words gave my mom a fright or shiver in her spine cause she also panicked too. I repeated the same question again but I started screaming "WHO IS THAT?!". My mom also screamed with me and was like "WHO WHAT? WHERE?" when suddenly, the front door OPENED.

Girl I have never felt so scared that I almost felt like sharting right there. My heart jumped and was prepared to see like a gun or a knife pointing at us when suddenly, I saw my dads frowning face. I paused for a while and went like "Oh." IT WAS JUST MY DAD, he just placed the tools back to the garage. My mom of course, who I almost gave a heart attack, slapped me on the back and said things that you are imagining right now and how I almost scared her to death. My dad was clueless and just raised his eye at me when my mom told him what happened. I laughed awkwardly and said "I thought you were in the bathroom". My dad raised his eyebrows at me and said "No, What do you mean? I went down when your mom also went down too.". Then after that I just chuckled nervously and went on with my life.



....



But, something was just not right at all. If my dad was downstairs all the time, who was the one inside the bathroom fixing our toilet? Who was the one making those noises? If I was alone upstairs then who was with me that entire time? If my dad went down when my mom also went down, leaving me ALONE up there, then what were those human noises that I heard when I was ALONE up there?



Until now I still couldn't figure out what or who the hell was that, but yeah. I just wanted to tell this experience of mine.
