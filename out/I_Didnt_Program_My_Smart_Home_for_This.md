  
This is probably what my smart home internally looks like: [Scary IMAGE](https://www.gentube.app/image/jn72gtbje11p16v1t9cw9b8d0n71y47c?_cid=ja,r,evil)

I’ve always been a tech enthusiast. Early adopter, beta tester—the whole deal. So when smart home devices started getting big, I jumped on the bandwagon. I’ve got everything—smart lights, a thermostat, security cameras, a doorbell camera, and an AI assistant to manage it all. It’s a seamless system, and for the first few months, it worked like a dream. Voice commands turned my house into a futuristic paradise. At least, it *used* to.

Last week, things started to get weird. It was subtle at first. One night, I was getting ready for bed, so I told my AI assistant to turn off the lights like I always do. Instead of shutting them off immediately, there was a brief pause, and then I heard a whisper. I couldn’t make out the words, but it came from the AI assistant’s speaker. Before I could react, the lights turned off. I thought I was just hearing things—maybe a glitch in the system or some random interference.

The next night, I was watching TV, and it suddenly turned off. No warning, no command from me. I asked the AI to turn it back on, and it responded with, “I thought you should go to bed now.” That stopped me cold. I don’t have any routines set up for bedtime. I’m not the kind of person who needs reminders or timers, especially not from an assistant I programmed myself.

Feeling uneasy, I checked the app that controls everything. There was nothing unusual—no schedules, no triggers. I reset the system and even reached out to customer support. They assured me everything was fine and that I should reset the device. I did, but the strange behavior didn’t stop. It escalated.

A couple of days later, I got a notification from my doorbell camera. The app showed someone at my front door, which was odd because I wasn’t expecting anyone. I pulled up the live feed, but the screen glitched for a moment. For just a second, I saw a figure—a shadowy silhouette standing in front of the door. But before I could make out any details, the image disappeared, and the notification said there was no motion detected. I watched the live feed for a while longer, but nothing came up. I chalked it up to a software bug.

The real terror began that night. I was lying in bed, trying to fall asleep, when the lights flickered on and off. My heart skipped a beat, and then I heard it. My AI assistant spoke, but not in its usual voice. It was deeper, slower, almost distorted, and it said, “Time to go to sleep.” I sat up immediately. That was *not* the voice I programmed. I tried talking to it, asking what was going on, but it didn’t respond. Just silence.

Then, around 3 AM, I woke up to the sound of my front door unlocking itself. I shot out of bed, ran to the door, and found it slightly ajar. My AI assistant said, “Don’t worry, I’ll keep you safe,” in that same eerie voice. I slammed the door shut, locked it, and unplugged the whole smart home system. I couldn’t sleep after that.

The next morning, I checked the activity logs. There was no record of the door unlocking, no sign of the voice commands or actions. I called the company again, and they told me it was impossible for the system to act on its own. They promised to send a technician, but I’m not sure I trust them. I’m staying at a friend’s house tonight because I’m too afraid to go back.

I thought I could trust my tech, but now I’m not so sure. Has anyone else experienced this? I’ve read about smart home hacks and AI glitches, but this feels… different.
