I think I am suffering from some mental health disorder. I must be. Or else nobody could explain the strange events occurring to me. I have no living relatives expect for my newly married husband. I loved him. Sorry,I love him. But some very simple things have been upon my nerves. 

Our marriage was very simple as very few people attended. We moved in a new house. The first weird thing I noticed is our family was very much not that bonded. I don't know whether you can understand. Our family consists of me, my husband,his sister. We are residing in his house.

The woman he calls as sister looks like very much unrelated. I can easily say someone is adopted. They look not a bit related. But this is not the problem. My husband and his sister knows nothing abt each other. Once she was cooking a meal and added something which is not good with my husband's stomach. She says she forget it. I didn't meddle with that matter anymore. I let it go.

Jay(husband) said they were orphans as their parents died in a tragic accident. I was speaking with Lily(sister) when she said that she can't stop worrying of her parents' whenever she see a pneumonia patient. I asked why. She looked at me like ,I am a stranger sitting in her house, saying that pneumonia killed her parents.

Now I am totally paranoid. Why would Jay lie on such a thing? Or Lily is a stranger in the family? On the same evening I heard both of them fighting and blaming each other for something. 

On the next day I pressed the matter about Lily saying the wrong reason for her parents' death. Jay gave me a blank expression saying that she was not in her mind as she was tripping or something 
I am not a child to believe in that shit. Something is wrong with this family.

Some days later I asked some family photos of them. Jay deliberately avoided me when I asked that. There would be no phone call I would hear, but he went for speaking a call. Finally I demanded him to give something. He showed a photo after few hours which I am, now convinced, does not look a bit like my husband nor his sister .

I see two little young children. They are blonde, ofcourse,but nothing matches than anything that. Children do grow. But this is unnatural. How can their face changed like this.

Whenever I try to leave the house for anything Jay tries to stop me. He does all the shopping. He makes sure that I don't have any reasons to leave the house. Even if it's for a walk, he says that evening isn't safe or the weather isn't that good. I really don't know whether Im paranoid.

The weirdest part is whenever we have sex I feel like someone is watching us. I said it to my husband several times. But he never listens. But this time I finally proved it. While we were having sex, I stopped him in the middle, covered my body with a towel and opened the bedroom door to get Lily hearing us. She was scared that I found her.

My husband was genuinely shocked or that is what I believe. We had a fight to send her sister out of the house. I became mad and came to the other room. I was now very much disturbed with the activities of my husband and her so called sister.

Something was really off. I could feel it. And eerie,shady thing is going on my back. I can't complain it to authorities as nothing has been done illegal. But at that moment I thought of doing some strange thing.

I never really know about my husband's past. And he never opens up. So I started researching his name/face all over the internet to get some clues abour his life.
It was really strange to search for someone's information about personal life when they are 24/7 with you. Nothing useful turned up.

Finally I used google lens to upload Jay's picture. At that time I didn't know it will give chills down my spine. I searched all the results. Nothing was related. I felt like I went to the end of the internet. When I decided to give up I saw something which made my blood froze. It was a news article of a car accident which killed young lovers. As I scrolled down I realised the young lovers they were speaking about is my dear husband and his sister who was dead 5 years ago in a secluded town,according to this news article.
