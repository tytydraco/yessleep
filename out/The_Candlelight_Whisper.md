I never believed in ghosts. To me, they were just stories people told to scare children or to explain the unexplainable. But what happened last winter changed everything, shattering my skepticism into a thousand pieces.

It was a cold, moonless night, and the power had gone out due to the heavy snowfall that blanketed our small town. The darkness in the house was thick, almost suffocating, and I was left alone with nothing but a single candle flickering on the table. The wind outside howled like a restless spirit, rattling the windows, but inside, the silence was heavy, oppressive.

I decided to pass the time by reading, so I grabbed an old book from the dusty shelf in the corner. It was a collection of ghost stories, tales of haunted houses and restless souls. The irony of the situation didn’t escape me, but I needed something to distract myself from the eerie quiet. I settled into my worn armchair, the book resting on my lap, and began to read.

As I delved into the stories, I noticed something strange. The flame of the candle began to waver, not in the gentle dance of a typical flame, but in a frantic, almost desperate manner, as if disturbed by an unseen force. There was no breeze in the room; all the windows were shut tight against the cold. I paused, watching the flame, but it soon calmed, and I shrugged off the oddity.

Minutes passed, and I became absorbed in one of the book’s eeriest tales, a story about a haunted inn where guests would hear whispers in the night. I chuckled to myself, thinking how appropriate it was, given the situation. But then, out of nowhere, I heard a faint whisper. It was so soft, so delicate, that at first, I thought I was imagining it. I stopped reading and listened, my ears straining in the dark.

The whisper came again, a little louder this time, though still unintelligible. My heart skipped a beat. The sound was so close, as if someone was standing right behind me. I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. Slowly, I turned my head, half expecting to see a figure looming over me, but there was nothing—just the dim light of the candle casting long, eerie shadows on the walls.

“Who’s there?” I called out, my voice trembling with a fear I hadn’t felt since childhood. The whisper ceased, and for a moment, there was only the sound of my own breathing, heavy and uneven. I tried to convince myself that it was just the wind, that my mind was playing tricks on me, but the silence that followed was too thick, too unnatural.

Just as I was beginning to relax, the whisper returned, clearer this time. The words were still a jumbled mess, like a dozen voices speaking at once, overlapping and merging into a cacophony of sound that made my skin crawl. The whisper was circling me, moving from one side of the room to the other, as if whatever it was, was toying with me.

Panic set in, cold and paralyzing. I shot up from my chair, nearly knocking over the candle in the process. The book fell to the floor with a loud thud, its pages splayed open like a broken wing. I grabbed the candle and made my way to the door, my steps quick and unsteady, desperate to escape whatever had invaded my home.

As I reached for the door handle, the whisper grew louder, turning into an angry chorus of voices. The flame of the candle flared wildly, casting grotesque, distorted shadows that seemed to dance with malicious glee. My heart pounded in my chest, and I could feel a cold sweat trickling down my back.

Then, just as suddenly as it had started, it stopped. The candle’s flame extinguished, plunging me into complete darkness. I was frozen, unable to move, my hand still on the door handle. The air around me felt heavy, suffocating, and I could feel a presence, something cold and malevolent, inches from my face.

In the darkness, I heard one final whisper, clear and unmistakable: “Get out.”

I didn’t need to be told twice. I yanked the door open and fled the house, the freezing night air biting at my skin, but it didn’t matter. I ran until I could no longer see the house, until the only sound I could hear was the pounding of my own heartbeat.

I never returned to that house. Whatever it was that whispered to me that night, I don’t ever want to hear it again.
