Hi there, I'm new here and I am aware that many won't believe such thing is possible but I will explain everything that leads me to believe its very much possible

To give some context, my dad is an extremely intelligent and honest man who discovered in his 20s that he had a gift for reading people and predicting events that may happen to certain people. His early adult life had him on a path to massive success. He finished his degree to be a real estate agent and in his first year won rookie of the year in Canada at age 24. I believe after making over 100k his first year which in todays economy is much more

His life couldn't go any better but as a spiritual human being who as a young age knew had a skill to predict things, he decided to use his free time to get better at it by using common practices just for the fun of it. He read a ton of books about it and wanted to try for himself. As far as I know he mainly practiced tarot reading which many call bullshit due to many frauds out there but my dad was different, the amount of future events he predicted for people in an almost identical way is enough for me to know he's legit

As a kid I was aware of his gift but never asked him to make a reading on me up until I was 13. He wasn't a fan of doing it but I convinced him. That day he told me that he sensed an injury might happen stating that he believed it would be playing Hockey. Trying to not scare me he said it would be mild and not that serious. 2weeks go by and what do you know I brake my clavicule on the ice. This is one example, At age 16 I was about to leave for work and he acted super weird when I was leaving for work which is 1km away mentioning multiple times to be careful on the road, something he didn't do usually and what do you know I get a bad accident leaving me fine but the car is wrecked. He predicted a ton of things of my ex step moms future too but I wont get into details to not make this too long

At that point I was aware that my dad had an insane amount of bad luck in life that started just a couple years after winning real estate agent of the year but as a teen I didn't think anything about it even though I had my own bad luck as a kid. From ago 7-13 I was one of the best Hockey players in my whole Canadian province and in fact was better then multiple teammates of mine who eventually made a career in Hockey, 1 is in the NHL and 2-3 are playing in Europe.

I'm about 12 at this time and enter the triple AAA camp, my first game I score 3goals and am by far the best player on that team. As the camp is ending its clear I made the team as I was point leader by a reasonable margin but someone had evil intentions. The coach of that team that I didn't know anything about aside from his son on the team being a top goaltender in the province had the audacity to look me in the eyes and say 'you didn't make the team'. All the kids parents are shocked with one even going as far as threatening the coach in my behalf.

Making this team is huge for your development due to them having multiple off ice trainings a week meanwhile playing against the best which eventually makes you a better player. Not to rant too long, the next years camp happens and the same exact scenario happens with the same coach who is following his son as a coach in all the top teams. At this point I slowly start to lose confidence and the love for hockey which leads me to eventually just quit after having another good camp and getting cut from Midget AAA from the same coach. Midget AAA is where the majority of top players get drafted to the next league which is the best league in the world for 16-20 years old, its at that level that the majority of NHL players are drafted

Thinking I would never get an answer on why this coach didn't want anything to do with me, I latter found out that the reason was that he cheated on his wife with my dads girlfriend before my dad starting dating her and didn't want her anywhere near his wife, its a special type of bad luck to potentially be taken away a Hockey career over this scumbag and it hurts to this day

To get to the point, at age 17 as I was just casually telling my dad how unlucky ive been lately he went on to say 'One day when your older I'll tell you more about it but our family is cursed' It was a little shocking but I didn't ask any questions and overall knew my dad had non stop bad luck for decades but if it was a curse then why would it affect me. I go on with my life forgetting about this conversation. I'm 18 now moving on my own with adult responsibilities and over time I start to notice a pattern of things never going my way in extremely important situations, which seems to be leading me in a path of destruction. I'm now 26 and one thing I noticed is every time I have extra money something bad seems to happen to keep me struggling and that's a pattern my dad has been going through for decades now too

I'm sorry for the long post, had to get it off my chest, I just want to add that my dad did mention multiple times when I was young about a guy who put a curse on him at the time where he was very involved into reading peoples future. I don't know the exact story but something went bad between the two and I believe at the time he knew this guy was into black magic and his readings on himself confirmed that someone bad was out to get him. Weirdly enough my dad was hugely successful up until this situation happened. Nothing but obstacles and constant bad luck has been coming his way since then even as of today
