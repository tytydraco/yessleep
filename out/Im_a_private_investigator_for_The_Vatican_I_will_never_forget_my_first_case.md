I have worked as a private investigator for the Vatican for the last three years. I began working in the field long before my work in the Vatican though. Prior to investigating phenomena that the church couldn’t explain I mostly dealt with cheaters and family members stealing from each other. The work was mundane, but clients paid well. That was until COVID hit and I almost lost my house due to the lack of work. When it seemed like my life was going to hit it’s lowest I got offered a job working for the Vatican.

At first, I couldn’t believe that the church was willing to hire a private investigator. I had assumed that any investigations would occur internally, however they wanted an outsider to assist with their most recent conundrum. Before explaining the assignment to me they sent a local bishop to vet me. I don’t know whether it was to determine my trustworthiness or simply to determine if I was a good fit for the job.

Hoping to make a good impression I invited the bishop to my house on Saturday for lunch. He introduced himself as Bishop John and we began talking. I’ll skip the details of me bending the knee to get hired, but he agreed I was the right person for the job and gave me the details.

A local house had been abandoned four years ago when the owner disappeared without a trace. Since then, many teenagers have attempted to stay in the house, whether it be for urban exploration or on a dare. These teenagers would often get home to their parents though with scratches all alont their backs and bruising on their arms. They swore that it was paranormal activity.

“Why doesn’t the church just authorize an exorcism and bless the house?” I asked, curious why it was a problem.

Bishop John responded saying “The Vatican has to confirm an exorcism, which requires a priest to get proof of a haunting.”

“Well then why do you need me? I’m no priest.” I inquired.

Bishop John shook his head. “We have sent priests to investigate the house, however there is no evidence of a haunting. It is possible however that whatever is causing these hauntings is hiding itself in the presence of priests that is why we need an outside opinion.”

I matched his head shaking, clearly hesitant to spend the night in a haunted house, even if the kids were lying about where they had got injured.

Seemingly sensing my unease John continued “If you do a good enough job the Vatican will consider hiring you as their own outside private investigator. You won’t get work often, but they will pay for your housing on the condition you are always on call.”

My eyes lit up at that proposition, whether or not I believed that hauntings were real having someone pay for my house while having very few working hours was impossible to pass up. I quickly stood up and shook his hand “You have yourself a deal sir!”

Skip ahead three days and I was given the address of the house and told when to stay there. Bishop John gave me his number to call in a situation where I needed immediate help. I was also stocked up with flashlights, portable chargers, bottles of water, and beef jerky to hold me over as a snack.

I entered the house at 6:30 pm and looked around to get my bearings. The first and second floor had their share of cobwebs but everything within the house looked modern. When I reached the basement, however, I noticed that the door had a lock on it. I texted Bishop John if he knew any reason that the door was locked, but didn’t immediately get a response.

I set up a “basecamp” on the second floor in the master bedroom, which had a king-sized bed and a television. I went to turn on the lightswitch out of instinct not thinking about how the house wouldn’t have power. I lay in bed for about two hours scrolling tiktok on my phone. At 8:45 I had received a text from Bishop John that read “I don’t know, must have been put in by previous owners to keep their stuff safe.”

Now my curiosity was peaked, what could they have kept in the basement that was worth locking the door with a padlock. I got out of bed and worked my way downstairs, the air was choking with dust, and the stairs creaked. Clearly no one, not even the teenagers who would sneak in here had used them in quite some time.

Once I made it downstairs, I texted a reply to John informing him I was going to search the basement. I walked my way over to the door and began fiddling with the handle, seeing if there was any way to bypass the lock. I couldn’t get the door to budge, however, which led me to search the first floor for something heavy and durable. I eventually searched the garage where a grey Chrysler 200 was sitting. I wondered how long the car had been idle.

As I searched the garage I found a pile of bricks. I picked one up feeling how hefty it was before deciding that it would work. I made my way back to the basement door and began smashing at the lock with the brick. After about four swings the lock finally broke and I was able to open the door.

As the door opened my nostrils were penetrated by a vile stench. I had never smelled anything like it and could not determine what was causing it. I turned on my flashlight however and braved the smell working my way into the basement. The stairs were wooden and open-backed creaking with each step. It was smaller than I would have thought compared to the house as it had only two rooms. The first room had things a person would expect in a basement like a fridge and a pool table. It wasn’t until I entered the second room that my heart skipped a beat.

I entered the second room and found a pentagram drawn onto the floor in what appeared to be chalk. On top of that, however, the smell became worse, however I could not pinpoint where it was coming from. Beside the pentagram was a bowl and what appeared to be a sleeping bag. I searched through the room for the source of the stench but could not find it, until I realized it was coming from the wall. There was a heavy bookcase that when I removed a book, I saw that there was a door behind it. I moved the bookcase and opened the door.

At the very moment the door opened my flashlight had died. Looking back on my actions they were not the smartest but despite my first flashlight being dead I moved forward into the room. Once I’d entered, I pawed through my bag until finding another flashlight. I wish I’d hadn’t turned it on though as what I saw still haunts me. Two corpses were in the room. I didn’t analyze them, however, as I immediately vomited and began making my way towards the exit. I worked my way through the basement and back to the stairs. As I ran up them, however, something grabbed my leg and I tumbled back to the bottom, my head hitting the cold concrete floor before everything went dark.

When I awoke, I fumbled around and felt both my phone and flashlight, the rest of my gear was gone. The stench was also its strongest. As I sat up, I heard something scraping across the floor, that is when I picked up my flashlight and realized I was in the same room as the corpses. The scraping I was hearing was the bookshelf being moved back into place. I was trapped inside the room, until my kidnapper had gotten bored of me and decided to kill me.

I panicked rushing for my phone, realizing that whether I had service I would still possibly be able to call the police for help, however when I picked it up, I realized it had no battery remaining. After a few moments of freaking out I calmed down and began observing my surroundings. I saw the corpses and immediately a wave of panic washed over me. My fate was going to be the same as theirs. My mid raced as I imagined all the torturous ways that the man could kill me. As I looked around the room, however, I noticed that there were scratch marks on the wall as if they were trying to claw their way out.

Upon further analysis of the corpses, however, it was evident that one of the corpses had bite marks on their bones. The thought made me nauseous, they didn’t die violent bloody deaths, they starved. The surviving member was forced to chew on the bones of the other to survive.

Another sudden wave of dread washed over me, if this is how I am going to die it may be better to have just been killed. I put my head in my hands and attempted to fall asleep. I knew I would be stuck in there for a while, and maybe by sleeping in my situation I would be able to come up with a solution.

I don’t know how much time had passed but I was awoken by the sounds of shouts. At first, I was groggy, and my head was pounding, however when I hear a voice shout “Drop the weapon” my heart skipped another beat. I could have been saved. I began banging on the door, before I heard the movement of the shelf. I moved away from the door, and it suddenly opened.

My hope quickly returned to fear however as I saw three men aiming their firearms at me. They were officers and shouted, “Get on your knees and interlock your fingers behind your head.” My heart sank upon hearing their command.

I was obliged, however, and was put in cuffs, after an hour or so of questioning on the scene they saw I was clearly a victim and they unhandcuffed me and called me an ambulance. Apparently, Bishop John had noticed I never replied and called the police giving them details about the house and me “exploring” the basement. I was down there for about 15 hours.

After the fact I found out that the man who had kidnapped me was a satanic squatter. He was living in the family’s basement, and one day while they were in the basement he hid, waiting for them to enter what I would call the prison room. Once they did, he quickly closed them in and moved the bookshelf in front of the door making it impossible for them to open it from inside. The police never found the family upon initial investigation as the bookshelf blocked the door.

As for the explanation of the paranormal happenings, the teens probably heard him in the basement. They also probably scratched themselves on furniture or banged up against something causing the bruises. The man who locked me in the basement is currently serving a 72-year sentence for the two counts of second-degree murder and the kidnapping.

Bishop John visited me while I spent the next three days in the hospital. Apparently, I was dehydrated and suffered a nasty concussion from tumbling down the stairs. He told me that the church thanks me for my help and that they are willing to hire me as a permanent investigator for them. Even though the experience left a sour taste in my mouth I needed employment, so I took him up on his offer.

That leads us to two days ago when I hadn’t received a single call asking me to do another investigation. Honestly, I would think theyd forgotten about me had they not been paying my bills. Today, however, I am about to go out on my second investigation. I will keep everyone updated on whatever happens once it is all said and done.
