Hello my name is Michael.



I always loved playing vintage Sega games when I was growing up. The fast paced gameplay, colorful worlds, and catchy music always kept me entertained for hours on end. But as I got older, I stopped playing the games. I remember going for hours at a time but not anymore. I always used to play the games with my friend Jeremy and then we both got jobs but we still keep in contact.



One day , What seemed to be Jeremy sent me an email which had a link to a ROM that he told me was for a long lost PC port of Sonic 1 for the Game Gear . I transferred the game to a CD-ROM. I inserted the disk into my game and Started playing.



The game started normally, (THIS IS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL) Until the first level. I was playing as Sonic in his 8-BIT glory in Green Hill Zone. I started to run quickly to the right until a strange looking character appeared in front of Sonic . He had a grayish blue color scheme with bloody gloves and shoes and closed eyes. I don't know what to tell you but it was strange. I gave "IT" the name "TENREC" cause it looked like Sonic but not exactly. I tried to attack the Tenrec by spindashing into it but then I lost my rings but instead of rings falling out it was red pixels. I tried to jump on it but that didn't work. Sooner or later it started to run towards me giving me the final blow as I got a GAME OVER after waiting a bit the text started appearing. "Why are you still here" after waiting a bit more it said "You know, don't you" as the background became Pitchblack with only the Tenrec visible. The Tenrec opened its eyes only to reveal his black voids that he called eyes as he started laughing and laughing and laughing, "I Killed them" IT said "I Killed them all" after that the game crashed. I opened the game again only to reveal an Anti-Piracy screen with Sonic waving his finger and the text "You seem to have an unlicensed copy of our game. Please report this and make sure to comply against your Sega game manual or



R̶̡̠̯̹̞̞͚̹͔͔̬̤̆̓̚U̴̫̰͇̠̹̠̙̣̥̕N̷̢̨̲͇̖̩͙͐͂̅̽͗͑̑"



The game showed Sonic drowning with that horrifying music playing with the countdown with the words " R̶̡̠̯̹̞̞͚̹͔͔̬̤̆̓̚U̴̫̰͇̠̹̠̙̣̥̕N̷̢̨̲͇̖̩͙͐͂̅̽͗͑̑" repeated OVER and OVER and OVER until it stopped as it released such I high frequency of sound that it cracked my computer screen.



I went to the police to see if they could investigate it and it turns out the game was made by a bloody Serial killer back in the 90s who drowned his victims who made a game that was supposed to be a last message before he died. The killers name was John Matthews, he made the game as a puzzle to drive the police insane.



It turns out the game was supposed to mess with you computer and leak all your information onto the internet.



It turns out that my Jeremy's personnel information including his house was on the internet now. Also somehow an already written E-Mail template with the link was already made and Jeremy did not actually send this



Detective Jones has been assigned to the case as he is trying to investigate where the last body is cause the games source code had the address that could lead to the last body.



Can't believe all of this happened. This is just messed up. The fact that I was involved is just maddening. What if all my data gets leaked. I might have to move now. Might take a break from the internet for a while. Maybe a month, a year but see you guys soon, hopefully.
