**Journal Entry 1**

I had always been a man of routine. Wake at 6:15 AM. Shower. Shave. Dress in one of my five outfits. The predictability grounded me necessary for a job where operations never slept and changes never stopped moving. 

Sarah used to tease me about it. \*\*"\*\*You’re like a Swiss watch except way cuter, and slightly less expensive to maintain."

That was before everything changed. 

The morning it began, I stood in front of the bathroom mirror, razor gliding over stubble. Steam curled from the shower, softening my reflection. The scent of Sarah’s lavender shampoo lingered. She’d showered earlier than usual. 

Movement flickered in the fogged glass. Sarah stood behind me. But wrong. 

Her posture was rigid. Her face slack. And her eyes—her eyes.

Where warm hazel should have been, there were only voids. Not just dark but lightless. Pools of perfect black that swallowed the air around them. 

The razor slipped. 

"Jesus!" I spun, pulse pounding. 

Sarah blinked and her eyes were normal again. 

"Sorry, sweetheart" she muttered, dabbing my cut with a tissue. Her fingers were ice. Far too cold for someone who’d just stepped from a hot shower. "You were so focused, I didn’t want to interrupt." 

That night, I dreamt of mirrors. Endless corridors of them, each showing Sarah behind me with those black voids for eyes. Every time I turned, she vanished, only to reappear in the next mirror, always watching. 

I woke at 3:17 AM to an empty bed. 

From the bathroom came running water and humming. Sarah’s voice, but…wrong. A lullaby her grandmother used to sing. One she’d sworn she couldn’t remember. 

When she slipped back under the covers, her skin was frigid. "Just washing my face," she whispered. 

I lay awake until dawn, certain I could still hear that off-key humming echoing through the house. 

**Journal Entry 2**

Three days passed. I nearly convinced myself it had been stress. 

Then, at work, I looked up from my desk. Sarah stood at the end of the hallway. 

Black-eyed. 

Unmoving.

Her head tilted at an unnatural angle. Arms limp. That impossible grin stretching her face. 

My coffee cup shattered on the floor. 

"Whoa, easy!" Mike knelt to help. "You okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost." 

"Do you see?" I pointed. 

Mike frowned. "See what?" 

She was gone. Her vanilla perfume hung thick in the air. The expensive kind I’d bought her. Far stronger than it should’ve been. 

My phone buzzed: 

Sarah: “Thinking of you. Come home soon. 

I called her immediately. 

"Where are you?" My voice cracked. 

"At home, silly." The air conditioner groaned in the background. Then static hissed, and beneath it, breathing. Slow. Hungry. 

I hung up. 

For the rest of the day, I saw her in every reflection. The break room window. My darkened monitor. Watching.

When I left, I found a single black hair on my passenger seat. 

Sarah was a blonde. 

**Journal Entry 3** 

3:17 AM. The clock’s red glow painted our bedroom like blood. 

Sarah’s breathing wasn’t sleep-soft. It was measured. 

In. Hold. Out.

Like counting. Like waiting. 

I turned my head. 

She was already staring at me. Black eyes gleaming. Smile too wide.

"You’re always watching me" she whispered. My own words from last week, thrown back at me in my exact inflection. 

The next morning, every mirror in the house was covered with towels. "I thought you’d appreciate it" Sarah said, scrambling eggs. Humming that lullaby. "Since they seem to bother you lately." 

I hadn’t told her about the mirrors. 

That night, I went to write in my hidden journal. Only to find every page sliced out. In their place, one sentence in my handwriting: "I must be imagining things."

**Journal Entry 4**

"You’re not sleeping" Sarah said, pressing a cold hand to my forehead. "It’s affecting your mind." 

The doctor agreed. "Stress-induced hallucinations," he said, scribbling a prescription. 

Sarah squeezed my hand. "I’ve been so worried." 

At home, she poured the pills into my palm. "These will help" she said softly.

They tasted like metal. My thoughts blurred at the edges. 

That night, I flushed them down the toilet. The water swirled black before clearing. 

Sarah stood in the doorway. "Wasteful" she shouted. "But I do love watching you try."

The next morning, the pills were back in the bottle. All of them. Even the ones I’d swallowed. 

**Journal Entry 5**

The grocery store lights buzzed like wasps. 

I turned, Sarah stood at the end of the aisle. 

Black eyed. Grinning.

A child ran through her. No one reacted. 

My phone buzzed: 

Sarah: “Need anything from the store?”

The reflection leaned in, breath like frost: "She doesn’t love you like I do."

I ran to the parking lot, every reflective surface showed her behind me. 

That night, I dreamt of mirrors again. This time, my reflection had black eyes. 

I woke screaming to Sarah straddling me, her hands pinning my shoulders. 

"Shhh" she whispered, breath cold. "It’s almost time."

**Journal Entry 6** 

The bathroom light flickered as I splashed water on my face. I barely recognized the man in the mirror—shallow, hollow-eyed. 

Then he blinked. Black.

I stumbled back into Sarah’s grip. In the mirror, her reflection grinned, mouth splitting wide with needle teeth glistening.

"Almost time" she whispered. 

I pushed free but the bathroom was empty. The mirror was fogged with breath that wasn’t mine. Written in the condensation: "SOON."

**Journal Entry 7**

I spit the last pill into my palm. Sarah watched from the doorway, head cocked. "You’re not taking them."

The light flickered. Her face stretched, elongating, before snapping back. 

"I don’t need them" I lied. 

"Liar" she firmly stated.

A sheet slipped off the mirror. I didn’t want to look. I had to.

Her reflection stood behind me, fingers digging into my shoulders but the real Sarah was still in the doorway. "You’re mine" the reflection mouthed. 

I yanked the sheet back. Sarah sighed. "You’re being paranoid again." But then her nail lengthened against my lip, just for a second, before retracting. 

I grabbed my phone, flipped to the front camera and my reflection winked. I threw the phone. It shattered. 

From the bedroom, Sarah called: "Everything okay?"

No. 

The thing in the mirror wasn’t just watching anymore. 

It was learning.

 **Journal Entry  8**

The doctor’s office reeked of antiseptic. Sarah clutched my hand. "He thinks I’m not me." Dr. Langford nodded. "The mind under stress plays terrible tricks." 

In the car, I checked the rearview mirror. Black eyes. Grinning.

The real Sarah hummed along to the radio. Two of them now and I couldn’t tell which was which. 

**Journal Entry 9**

The house was too quiet. 

Sarah showered. I searched her nightstand—a locket.

Inside: a single black hair. 

The shower stopped. Sarah appeared, dripping wet. 

"You found it" she whispered. 

Her eyes were black. 

But this time…so were mine.

**Journal Entry 10**

The pills were never for me. 

They were for her. 

To keep her human. 

To keep her from seeing what I’ve become. 

Now, when I look in the mirror, the man who stares back is a stranger. 

Sarah kisses me goodnight, her lips warm. 

Mine are not.

I don’t sleep anymore. 

But she does. 

And when she wakes. I’ll be waiting. 

Black eyed.

Hungry. 

Ready.
