There's something about having a knock on your door at any time of day that creeps me out in today's day and age, what could be so important as to warrant a visit, could they not have called or texted?

Out of anxiety and confusion my base instinct is to hide the fact I'm home, and attempt to check who's there without revealing my presence, even when it is just a neighbor or a solicitor. That's my typical response, even with a door dash I wait for them to drop off the food and leave before I retrieve it.

That is exactly why at three am, I would never answer my door. It's said that nothing good happens after 2 am.

One night, like many others I was up late smoking weed and playing games, guzzling down caffeine to stay alert, but unlike other nights, one of my worst fears was realized. A knock at the door.

As the knock sounds I immediately flinch, what could that sound be this late while I'm home alone. I sat there, not even breathing unsure if what I heard was real, breathlessly I waited and waited hoping it was just imagination, afterall at 3am who would come to my door of all doors?

Then the repetition sounds again, the knock echoing through my house. Frozen to my computer chair I debate my odds of them just leaving assuming I'm asleep, it is late after all. Doing quick mental math I had to note they'd know I'm home and awake having all of the lights in my house on. Between that, and pure curiosity driving me I knew at the very least I had to see who it was knocking upon my door.

As cautiously as I could I creep towards the front door, positioning my body against the wall to avoid being spotted from the window. Again, the knocks ring out almost frantically, desperate in a way. Slowly I make my way to the peephole, breathing shakily, the only noise besides the knocking is my heart banging against my chest, blood coursing through me so intensely I can hear my heartbeat throbbing into my own ears.

Through the peephole an even more worrisome and curious sight, for there is no immediate presence, Yet an immediate knocking forces me back out of pure instinct. At this point my heart is screaming in my ears, the drum beat begging me into fight or flight mode, nothing but adrenaline pushing me into my next actions thoughtlessly.

Forcing myself I undo the deadbolt on the door and fling it open full of fear only wanting this nightmare to be over. As the door swings ajar my fear is reduced seeing the small figure of a child, and yet the fear doubles even more realizing the intense knocks that rang through my house in the late hours of the night were from a mere child, but yet why would there be a child at more door in the midnight hours. I stood there for several moments thoughtless, genuinely bewildered at the situation I've found myself in.

As I stood there mouth and mind agape, I realized the child wasn't even facing the door. My voice caught in my throat, I could barely force out a whisper. My voice cracked and waivered, fear dictating my very being, and then it struck me. This is a child, scared and helpless banging upon my door in the middle of the night. There is just something within the human heart that overrides fear when realizing another is in need, doubly so when it's a child. "Hello, is everything okay?" I beckon out to the mysterious child to no avail.

Faced with just the silhouette of the back of the child I repeat myself, "Hello is everything alright?" Silence. Long, terrifying silence. I want to open the screen door, reach out to the child but something inside of me just..won't. Again, with confidence I bellow, "Hello, please if you need help I can help you, but if not I don't appreciate you bothering me this late" and that's when the child finally spoke.

In a hoarse and drawn out voice, as if the child desperately needed water, or perhaps it was sounding out it's first words, the child spoke almost questioningly, "I Wannnt." As any adult would when talking to a child, I soften my voice, and ask "What do you want?" Almost as if the child were mimicking me in that hoarse terrible voice, he repeated "You. Want. Youu, Waaant." Growing less fearful and more concerned for the child and this situation entirely I persist, "Yes, what is it that you want? Is everything okay?" Still, without turning around the child just echos in his terrible worn out voice, "Want"

The fear starts creeping up my spine once more, like a cold chill ascending from the floor and growing colder and numb into my core. I stutter out, "P..please just tell me what you need! Are you all alone?" Coldly, the child once again echoed my own words back at me, "Are you Alone" feeling as if it were taunting me or mimicking me, but feeling equally guilty for that thought as if it's just a scared child. I reply "Yes, it's just me, I can call someone for you if you need, are your parents around? you shouldn't be off on your own."

Coarsely the child hisses out, "We are not alone." My only thought is panic and confusion, my eyes leave the child and dart around our surroundings in a panic, I start to tell the child I don't see anyone else, before my entire being halted by the realization that we in fact aren't alone. Hidden in the shadows of the night stood a tall dark figure in the middle of the lawn. Featureless, just a lump of shadows in the form of a man, but in the darkness I couldn't make out any details of the figure at all. I begin to crack open the screen door just slightly so I might address the shadowy figure, but as the door opens the child spins on its heels swiftly startling me backwards into the safety of my doorway.

Within seconds all of the fear felt before was back and more pungent than before. Quickly with my fear growing evermore i studied the mysterious child's face, pale and smooth as if it were sculpted out of porcelain, all of its features perfectly in place, and smoothed in such a way where as it was so natural it couldn't be anything but natural, something about the perfection of the child's pore less skin, just didn't seem real. And that's when I saw it. The eyes. My entire life, all the joy, all the fear, all the sadness I'll ever live could not hide or erase the memory of sheer dread when I looked into the child's eyes. If you've ever stared out into the dark, into a starless night, into dark waters abyss, and felt nothing but the emptiness staring back at you, devouring the light, pulling everything in, then you might understand the feeling of terror I felt as I saw Nothing.

The eyes weren't there, replaced by sheer darkness, shadow, fear itself. Not just dark eyes with no white, but an all consuming darkness from which light could never escape, something that could only be compared to the eldritch horror of a black hole pulling everything in, devouring all.

Time felt as if it stood still as I gazed into the abyss, unable to think, to react, as if its stare had turned me into stone, I did the only thing I could. I screamed, not the scream of a full grown man, but the scream of a desperate soul fearing it's final fate as I fell back towards the floor, kicking and screaming desperately to get back, to get away, anything to avoid the deep dark gaze of this mysterious child. I'm not proud of it, but in my chaotic retreat I managed to fearfully flail around in just such a way I kicked the door shut.

Without the eyes upon me I was able to think again, "Door, lock, Fuck." The only thoughts as I fumbled forward towards the door.

As I heard the deadbolts lock click shut, the knocking started back up again, and I heard the mystery child beckon "I WANT." Terrified, I crawled back away from the door. Right then is when I heard a noise that terrified me even more than the knocks that shook my door in its frame. The Sharper, more fragile knocks on glass, upon my window. I spun around with dizzying speed towards the knock, if a child could shake the door it could easily bust the window. And then again, from another window, another knock boomed in repetition, and then another, making its way from window, to window, to window, and then back to the door, and then, the child's voice rang out like a terrible symphony, a cruel cacophony from every door and window rang out at once, "WE WANT YOU."
