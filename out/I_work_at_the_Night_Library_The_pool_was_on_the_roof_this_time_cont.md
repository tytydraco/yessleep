Hey, y’all. Just wanna say sorry real quick before we get started for the insane delay on the update; my life is in shambles (it’s not) and everything is falling apart (I had to move) and I thought my days on the internet were over for good (I lost my computer charger). But never fear, I beat the odds (finished moving and Matt ordered me a new charger ‘cause I use my laptop for work) and I am in the proverbial saddle once again.

So, anyway. Back to it.

We found “me” first. (If you don’t know what the fuck *that* means, see our [previous installment](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1cstjoo/i_work_at_the_night_library_the_pool_was_on_the/) for context—this is a part two.)

It was the scent that did it. That cloyingly sweet, rotting smell I’d picked up on when I first headed down into the cabin space. I hadn’t noticed it coming off of Wiley’s doppelganger on deck, I assume, because we’d been out in open air, but here, now, I was choking on it. 

I don’t know that anything could have prepared me for the sensation of perceiving myself from the outside when Wiley and I rounded the corner. The compulsion to mirror the movements of this tangible, corporeal visage of myself was so incredibly compelling I had to fight not to look away.

The way its lips stretched over its teeth as it bared them to offer us a sickly, unsettling grin was almost helpful in its disconcerting nature—the less human it appeared, the better. “What’s the matter?” it asked, in a near-perfect iteration of my voice. “Aren’t you having fun?”

“What the fuck *are* you?” Wiley spat, fists tightening at their sides.

The thing lifted its hand to its chest in mock offense, bottom lip jutting out into a pout. “Wiley, that hurts. I’m your friend! You know me.”

“You’re not my fucking friend.” Wiley stepped ahead of me, nearly toe-to-toe with my doppelganger, and shoved against its chest, hard.

It didn’t budge. 

I cartoon-character-tug-the-collar gulped. 

Trying to recall the following sequence of events in enough detail to adequately recount them here is a beast. I’m not sure how my brain decides what’s traumatic enough to protect me from in the moment and what isn’t, but evidently this encounter in particular was too much to process, because the next thing I remember is Wiley dropping their candle as they were flung in the opposite direction of me, landing hard enough that their impact echoed throughout at least the immediate vicinity. 

“I’m okay,” they said, after a beat. I don’t remember calling out to them, but it very well may have been in response to me. “Get that fucking thing.”

I just…I don’t know. I charged it.

I’m not sure, in hindsight, what I thought that was going to accomplish. I’d just watched Wiley attempt to knock it down and end up the human embodiment of a paper airplane, so the delusion that my outcome would differ wildly enough to make full-body tackling it worth the effort, and, additionally, *terror,* was fully devoid of sources to cite. 

But it worked.

I won’t pretend not to have forcibly suppressed a small swell of vindication welling in my chest when I took note that the mimic’s smug stoicism had slipped precisely far enough to give away that it was utterly shocked.

There was something unsettling in the exchange, too—something about the understanding that not even *it* fully grasped the mechanics of what was taking place—but I ignored the unease in favor of focusing on the fact that I’d managed to best it, even by a one percent margin. 

This, of course, did not indicate to me that the situation would be smooth sailing (pun intended) from that point forward. Motherfucker was *strong.* I was flipped onto my back in a fraction of a second, knees practically pinned to my chest, shoulders held flat against the ground. 

“Actually going to have some fun now, are we?” It snarled happily, face inches from my own. Its breath was hot and putrid and sour, and I turned my head to the side, desperate to draw in a lungful of clean air. “I love a good dance.”

I’ve gotta give that to it: in a way, it *did* feel like a dance. There wasn’t anything but the existence of the two of us in the space, and the push-pull of each movement was calculated in a way that no one but a practiced pair could conceivably achieve. 

It’s a fascinating mental exercise, vying for purchase against yourself. I, of course, don’t have any real grasp on the impossible dynamism of existing as a creature that imitates a person, but I can tell you that it was uncannily perceptive of every individual one of my movements, as I was of its. 

When I rocked further onto my back, planting my feet against its sternum, its hands were already there, lithe fingers encircling my ankles. When it made its move to pull me fully prone, I grabbed onto its biceps, refusing to allow its motion any independence from mine. It used my own leverage to its center of gravity against me, folding me essentially in half, knees next to my ears as it weighed me down. Back and forth and back and forth we went, until, finally, I slipped out of its grapple a *fraction* of a second too fast for it to have already planned a step further. I hadn’t yet, either, which was likely why I took so little care not to hurt *myself* in the process of slamming my forehead full-force into its nose. 

Shit *sucked.* I mean, it sucked worse for the doppelganger, ultimately. I wasn’t the one fountaining blood from the center of my face like a spigot, so I guess I got off alright, all things considered. But I’m not gonna pretend it didn’t daze me for a minute. 

When I was back to seeing more darkness than stars, however, I could make out its form in front of me, both hands covering its face, and I figured that was my opportunity. 

I still had the bike chain clenched in my fist, and I considered, briefly, wrapping it around my knuckles and driving it into the thing’s already busted cartilage, but I knew that wasn’t its intended use. So instead, I placed one end in either palm, clambered to my feet, and bent behind the mimic, wrapping the chain around its neck.

Its hands sprung downward, slicking the metal with blood as it dug fruitlessly at its own skin, nails desperate to separate the chain from its larynx. I knew, though, as I tightened my grip, that the fight was over. It wouldn’t recover—not from this. It wasn’t supposed to.

Wiley pulled me out of it. I don’t know how long it had been, but when awareness returned to me, the doppelganger was entirely limp before me, lifeless form held up by nothing but my own tension. 

“Adam,” Wiley said, far closer now than they’d been at the beginning of the altercation. “It’s done.”

I looked up at them, one of the remarkably still-lit candles casting a soft glow across their face, and then, for the briefest moment, let my eyes fall closed.

“I’m sorry,” they offered quietly. 

“Thanks,” I said, knocking a knuckle against the back of one of their gloved hands. “I’m sorry, too.”

They helped me up, and I let the chain fall to the ground, landing with a sifting, tinny clatter next to “my” body. I didn’t look back as we continued down the hall.

The candle we’d lost in the fray hadn’t been doing much in the way of visual aid anyway, but its absence didn’t go entirely without note. Wiley and I remained next to one another rather than walking in file, squinting through the darkness and relying heavily on our proximity to the walls in the narrow space to guide us. 

Eventually, we advanced to a larger, open area, wherein there was a faint but persistent sound akin to that of water hitting the bottom of a tub somewhere to our right.

We both, on instinct, turned to head toward it, and were met roughly five steps in with the sensation of shallow splashing underfoot. 

After exchanging a *look* with me, Wiley lowered the candle to the ground. 

Not only did we receive confirmation that it was, indeed, wet, but additionally, we gleaned the knowledge that the water was not stagnant. It was spreading, centimeter by centimeter, until, after a brief moment, our shoes were surrounded.

I didn’t have it in me to be anything but horrifically, sickeningly amused. 

Wiley, in a similar state of exhausted delirium, evidently didn’t either. “It’s gonna fucking sink, isn’t it?”

“It sure is,” I laughed, pushing my damp hair back from my forehead. “Jesus Christ, what are our lives?”

“Almost over,” Wiley snorted in response. “We could…I don’t know, try to figure out where it’s coming from, I guess? See if we can…stop it somehow?”

“I mean, I guess we could try to plug it or something, maybe?”

“Wait, wait,” Wiley said, “maybe *this* is what the thing meant. The riddle or whatever. Maybe once we take out the…the other one, this’ll stop. But then—does that mean the whole *pool* won’t go away? Like, will we still be stuck here?”

“Oh. Yeah. Okay, yeah. Maybe. One catastrophe at a time. Let’s just—let’s find your…the other one, take it out, and then we’ll—”

Good news, gang! We didn’t even have to look for it. Bet you’ll never guess why.

Before you ask how many concussions this job has given me, I’ll just go ahead and confirm that they’ve done enough damage that I truly do not know. A lot. It’s a lot. 

The doppelganger fully bodied me, and I hit the floor so hard I swear to god I heard my skeleton rattle inside me. The pulsating pressure in my head was instantaneous. Everything spun, and already being on mobile ground made it so difficult to reorient myself that all I could do upon forcing myself back to my feet was squeeze my eyes shut and spin around to face the wall, seeking out the solace of the slightly-cooler-than-air-temperature wood with my forehead.

Wiley was already on the thing, by the time I got it together. I’d never seen them display the level of unbridled, empty rage they held in that moment before, and I hope I never do again. It was both more and less guarded than they’d ever seemed, somehow, methodical and measured as their gloved fist came down again and again against the mimic’s face.

They were sitting on top of it, knees on either side of its waist, holding its wrists together above its head with their free fingers, driving their knuckles into its cheekbones, browbones, ears, lips, nose, chin, anywhere and everywhere there was an inch of unscathed flesh. 

It really wasn’t even fighting them, and I realized with a sick, sinking horror that I understood why.

“Wiley,” I said quietly, offering the same grounding they had for me. 

They slowed, gradually, in acknowledgment, finally drawing to a panting, trembling halt. “Sorry. That was…sorry.”

I clapped them on the shoulder, offering them a hand up, which they hooked their elbow into so as not to bloody me with the gore coating the gloves. “Water’s still coming,” I commented, a little more solemnly now.

“Yeah,” Wiley said, stripping off the gloves and casting them to the ground. “Guess we’re fucked, huh?”

“Let’s go back up,” I suggested, picking up the candle Wiley had methodically placed on the floor before beginning the ending of the mimic. “Maybe the rest of it’s gone. Like, the pool. Maybe it’s just running in here from nowhere now.”

“...I was gonna ask how that’s possible, but.” Wiley gestured broadly, generally, around us.

“Yeah,” I scoffed. “I don’t know. Come on.”

We traversed clumsily back through the darkness and eventually found our way to the stairwell, which we climbed quickly, pushing our way back out into the (comparative, even if it was only from the moon) light.

You’ll be shocked to learn that the pool was not gone.

There *was* something happening in it, though. 

A moderately close section of the water was rippling; gently at first, as though something small was moving just beneath the surface, and then in grander waves, growing steadily less contained.

“You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me,” Wiley said. 

Before I could respond, the water’s tension broke.

Tentacles. Large ones. They appeared to be a pallid green-gray hue in the silvery light, and they twitched and flicked independently, splashing a rain of droplets into the air.

“Okay,” I started hesitantly. “Maybe it’s fine, maybe it’s just a–an octopus. A big octopus.”

“Maybe,” Wiley agreed, with absolutely zero confidence. 

We observed the tentacles wordlessly for several moments, waiting for something *else*—for the body they were attached to to emerge, or for them to come closer, but they never did.

Instead, something rocked the ship. Something from the opposite end. 

“Fuck,” I said. 

“Fuck,” Wiley agreed.

It would’ve been hilarious, probably, watching us from a third party perspective. 

Whichever end of the ship we ran to, the waters steadily rippled as though something had just submerged itself beneath. We traversed back and forth an embarrassing quantity of times, quickening our paces in hopes that we might be fast enough to catch whatever it was before it disappeared fully again, before arriving at the conclusion that, to catch it, we’d have to split up. 

Neither of us was particularly keen on that idea, given the Whole Entire Fucking Situation™, but we figured the likelihood of imminent danger at this point was relatively even either way, so split up we did.

I saw its head first. Just happened to get the unlucky end of the stick, I guess. 

It took me a minute to process that it even *was* a head at first. It was *that* big. But the eye (singular, in the middle of its face) clued me in. 

It opened vertically, like a reptile’s nictitating membrane, only there wasn’t another lid overlaying it. The shade of yellow it revealed itself to be was absolutely otherworldly, and the light emanating from it prompted me to absently recall camping with glowsticks as a child. 

And then I remembered, suddenly, the moonlight illuminating something fastened to the front of the ship. 

Except that it hadn’t been, had it? It had been glowing, too. 

“Wiley!” I hollered. 

Before they could respond, however, I felt a massive *thud* against the vessel’s side and glanced back to the water to find that the creature’s enormous head had rammed into it, causing the entirety of its weight to shift and forcing me to hold onto the railing nearest to me with both hands to keep from falling.

“What the *fuck* was that?” they yelled back.

“Come here!” I said, because I didn’t know how in the nine levels of hell I was supposed to explain.

The reaction you’re imagining Wiley having is probably accurate, so I’ll just leave that one up to you. But as soon as I clued them in on my revelation about the ship’s glowing ornament, they leapt into action.

We didn’t need to communicate verbally to understand that the move was to get our hands on it. In a moment’s time, I was holding securely onto Wiley’s ankles, their entire body dangling with determined fervor over the vessel’s front.

“Got it!” they reported after a long, unsteady silence, the certifiable monster below us slamming its form into the precariously sturdy wood separating us from certain disaster.

I pulled them up gracelessly, causing them to fall back onto the deck clutching, what I now saw, was a wooden crossbow.

“Shit,” I said, lifting it from their chest with one hand and employing the other to help them up. “Sorry. You good?”

Wiley nodded. “Look at it,” they panted, gesturing toward the weapon in my grasp. “It’s got a…”

An eye. It had an eye embedded in the stock, glowing in precisely the same hue as that of the beast. I ghosted my thumb over it, about half convinced it would *squish* beneath my touch, but to my exultant relief, it seemed to be composed of nothing but glass.

“So that’s, like. Where we should shoot it, probably,” Wiley said. 

“Uh-huh,” I agreed. “You ever shot one of these?”

Wiley shook their head and held out their hands. 

I eyed them skeptically.

“Have *you?”*

“...Fair enough.” I handed it over, casting my gaze to the writhing, gnashing creature in the increasingly tumultuous waters below us. It rammed into the ship’s hull once again, head thrashing back in disdain when it still wasn’t successful in breaking through. 

There was only one bolt. That was what made the odds so precarious. There wasn’t a pouch or quiver or holster full of backups. We had *exactly* one shot, and the fucker wouldn’t stay still. 

When I tell you what I did, you have to bear in mind that it was a lose-lose situation. I was either going to die stuck on this ship starving to death *with* Wiley, or I was going to die being probably eaten/possibly drowned by a fantastical, mythical, legendary beast and Wiley was going to live to tell the sickest, most metal tale of all time.

So I jumped.

Just, like, imagine for a second, for my dignity, that it looked ridiculously cool and heroic and that I landed directly on the thing’s back, one leg on each side of its neck like some kind of seasoned cryptid tamer.

Got that image in your mind’s eye? Great. Now wipe the slate completely clean and picture my ass knocking my forehead off its *apparently* fucking plate-metal-armor hide and flopping about as gracelessly as is humanly possible into the water, ‘cause that’s…yeah. That’s it.

In my defense, though, I did clambour up onto it like I wasn’t even double-concussed or currently shitting my pants about the prospect of being consumed whole. Wiley was hollering at me the whole time, naturally, asking was I crazy and/or out of my mind and/or what the fuck did I think I was doing, but Nessie and Cthulu’s lovechild honestly wasn’t paying me much mind. It was pretty well locked in on the vessel, still presumably calculating how to bring about its ultimate destruction.

Its neck was too big for me to really secure my arms around, but I did my best to maintain my position, my newly re-drenched clothing somehow helping me to retain traction. I had to calculate, mentally, as best I could, my probability of catching the weapon if I instructed Wiley to throw it down to me. If I missed, it would sink, no question. It weighed plenty enough to hold itself down. And also, it wasn’t entirely unlikely that the beast would simply catch it first, and in the event of *that* outcome, it would serve as a pleasant appetizer to the main course: me. 

So I couldn’t miss, and I had to beat the monster to the punch. That was all there was to it. 

Easy enough.

“Throw it down here!” I told Wiley, motioning toward myself. “You’re too far away and it’s moving too much, there’s no way you’ll make it!”

“Throw it—? It’ll knock you off if you catch it, and that’s *if* you even catch it! You’re fucking insane, get back up here!”

“Wiley.” 

Something in my tone, I guess, stilled them. “Adam, this is—it’s probably suicide.”

“Nah,” I said, as though I was arguing something as menial as not needing to leave the house five minutes early for an appointment. “It’s fine. I’m good. Hit me.”

Wiley hesitated for a moment that felt longer, probably, than it was. “Matt’s gonna fucking kill me if you die,” they said, and then hurled the bow over the side of the boat.

In case you were worried that I’d suddenly jumped ranks and developed even sub-par reflexes, don’t be. I did not, in fact, catch it.

What I *did* catch, however, was the one, single bolt. (Without even falling off, so. I’m basically superhuman.)

I had absolutely no idea if it would work. None. But the bow itself was already sinking into the ink-black depths below me, so if it was a necessary element in the creature’s undoing, that proverbial ship had sailed. 

I had to try the only thing I could.

Wiley peered down on me, frozen, looking as though they were holding their breath.

I tackled it. I didn’t know what else to do. I didn’t feel like trying to be stealthy about it would lend itself to my favor, given that I was already on the thing’s back, so I just did my damndest to wrangle it into a position that would allow me access to its enormous, glowing eye. 

It released something, when I stabbed the arrow into it. There was a wet, squelching *schlick* and then the beginnings of a plume of dark, opaque smoke. 

The monstrosity itself did not seem to have any reaction whatsoever to having just been maimed and, assumedly, blinded, other than to still. It wasn’t thrashing about anymore, but it wasn’t screeching in pain or fury or anything at all. It was utterly silent and motionless, save for the fog pouring steadily from the gaping wound in its pupil.

When it touched the surface of the water, it was as though a chemical reaction was taking place; it looked so much like bubbling acid that, for a moment, I was afraid it would burn me.

I realized quickly enough, however, that the reality of the situation played heavily to my favor. The water was evaporating.

“Oh, shit,” Wiley said, disbelief hanging too heavy in their tone to allow for relief. “Fuck.”

I heard myself laughing before I felt it, a wild, frenetic sound made more unruly by the manipulation of the heavy wind around me. 

I hadn’t allowed myself to register before now that I truly hadn’t expected to make it out. Not this time. There’s always something about barely scraping the bottom of a near-death situation that brings you a new appreciation for life, even if you’re soaking wet and freezing cold and probably going to have pneumonia by tomorrow.

It was fairly straightforward from there–the water disappeared, slowly, and it left the creature nothing but a mess of bones and skin in its wake, any real essence of what had made it *alive* filtering into the damp, hazy air.

We booked it back inside as soon as the ladder made its appearance again, both panting and exhausted but too giddy to sleep if we’d tried, and headed straight into the kitchen, both, hilariously, feeling as though we were about to die of thirst. 

I filled a glass for Wiley first, sliding it across the table to them as they fell with a heavy *plunk* into the chair nearest to me, and then pulled another from the cupboard for myself.

I let the silence settle around us for several moments, comfortably, as we drank, and then asked, “Do you want to talk about it?” without turning away from the sink. “About why you…didn’t fight back?”

For a long beat, Wiley was silent. Then, the shuffling of their chair pushing away from the table as they stood. “Nah,” they decided quietly. “Doesn’t matter. I made it out, so.” They sniffed, polishing off the last of their water and setting their glass down gingerly on the island next to me. “How ‘bout you?” they countered, leaning back against the cabinet and crossing their arms. “Are you okay? After…everything?”

“Yeah,” I said, fingertips grazing the scarred tissue across my throat—nearly imperceptible to the naked eye, but smooth and cool to the touch. “Yeah. I’m good.”
