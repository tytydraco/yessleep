"Hope, I need you."

*What you need to do is forget my number.*

I didn't say that to my boss. Wanted to, but couldn't. If I weren't so lovely, I had about a dozen other words I desperately wanted to say to him. None of them would be polite to use in public. Some of them may include the location where he could stuff his head.

"Danny," I said, my voice ratcheting up its natural southern drawl, "We've talked about this. You know I don't like opening alone. I get the frights." I really let *i* in frights walk him through the magnolias. Southern Belle-ing him into submission.

Dropping and picking up my Southern accent was a skill I developed as a kid of divorced parents. I lived in the South exclusively until I was ten. That was the year my parents split and my dad moved back north to Michigan. Code-switching between two unique cultures helped me fit in with both. After that, I shuffled between the North and the South more than a Civil War battalion.

I keep my Dixie accent in check these days - unless using it will help me get what I want. A woman with a Southern accent can be catnip for a certain kind of man. I prayed Danny was one of them.

"Those are just stories," he said.

"No sir, not just stories. The entire staff is afraid of the room."

"Hope," he half said, half sighed. "You'll only be alone for twenty minutes. Thirty, tops." Damn it. He balked. The first salvo in my southern charm offensive failed.

I rallied the troops and charged again. "Captain," I said, blessing him with a nickname he didn't deserve, "You know that place gives me the creeps when I'm alone. It plumb scares me to high heaven!"

Even I was repulsed by the Scarlett O'Hara act.

"Just stay away from there," he said. "Gene will be there too. Let him do it."

That was hardly a relief. If it were Gene joining me for the early shift, he'd be an hour late. Minimum. That flies when your last name matches the owner.

"Gene? That's how you're gonna sell this to me?"

He paused. "His work habits are a bit, well, unconventional, but he's good people."

"He's a raccoon in a necktie," I said.

"What the hell does that mean?"

I sighed - it wasn't worth getting into. "I can't trust him," I said. "If he even shows up on time."

"He told me he's set two alarms."

"He could sleep on the hands of a giant alarm clock, and it wouldn't matter! What if something horrible happens to me before he gets there?"

"Nothing has ever harmed anyone."

Laughing, I said, "Doesn't mean it won't, Cappy. You kill the weevil when you see its egg, not after it eats your cotton."

He paused. "I'm lost. Are you the weevil or the cotton?"

"I'm saying I don't want to open with haints loose in the building." Before he could express his confusion again, I filled him in. "Ghosts. Not a fan."

"Want me to send an old priest and a young priest over to clear the room first?"

As you can imagine, the joke went over as well as the devil in a pew. "I mean, we've discussed this before I took the job - no solo opening shifts. You agreed with me," I said, trying a new tack.

"Technically, this isn't a solo opening shift," he said weakly. I sighed, and he could sense my frustration in the huff. "I wouldn't normally ask, but I'm stuck. Paul called out, and Jane can't come in until 9. We have a medicine delivery and I need someone there to sign and stock."

"You aren't coming in?"

"My day off," he said sheepishly. "I'm taking the family to the beach."

I held the phone away from my face and mouthed a string of curse words that would make a longshoreman repent. "Sounds fun," I finally said.

"I'd consider this a personal favor to me."

I stayed quiet. It was a ploy. Another attempt to break him. Most people fold when silence enters a conversation. Bosses, especially weak-willed ones, weren't above caving. I was trying to wait him out.

"What if," he started. "What if you do this favor for me, and I ensure you're off two weekends this month?"

"I dunno," I said, my drawl as exposed as a preacher in a whorehouse.

"Three weekends?"

He wasn't budging. Might as well get something useful for my impending trauma. "A month?" I offered, letting my coquettish lilt do the asking.

"A month it is."

When my alarm went off at 5:15 in the morning, I wanted to die. I lay there and wondered what my funeral would be like. What would my decor be? Colors? Theme? Would any of my exes show up? Would my parents reunite without a donnybrook breaking out? Who'd cry? Would my grave have a pleasant view?

Once I finished Pinteresting my funeral, I got moving. Norm, our medicine delivery driver, was always prompt. We were the first stop on his route. It was easier to get meds delivered, inventoried, and stocked before we saw our first patient. That said, I'd rather eat a plain beignet dunked in hot water than check and stock meds.

At this time of year, especially in the early morning, a fog would sometimes grip the landscape and hold it firm until the sun fully arrived. This was one of those days. I hit the unlock button on my key fob and saw the haunting red of my taillights wink in the billowing white clouds. From where I stood, I couldn't even see the car. Who doesn't love driving in whiteout conditions?

Thanks to the fog and my overly cautious driving - thanks Dad - I was running behind. Norm was the most punctual man on God's green Earth. He'd arrive at his grave a day early just to show the Devil up. If he beat me there, he wouldn't wait long before he motored off to his next destination. No medicine in a medical clinic was generally considered a problem.

Our clinic was in an odd location. Typically, when you envision a clinic, you think of it being in a medical park. Ours wasn't. We were a free-standing building surrounded by light industrial companies. Car paint shops, electronic recycling, and warehouses don't precisely align with anyone's idea of health care, but you take cheap real estate when you find it. After a while, it seems natural.

I pulled into the parking lot exactly at six. It was still dark out, and the fog had only gotten worse. Visibility was limited to a few feet. Hopefully, the fog would burn off in the sun, but that didn't make it any less scary.

Horrid beasts hide in the fog. Everyone knew that.

I stepped out and heard the buzzing of the urban cricket. I glanced up at the burnt-orange light spilling from the lamppost. The fog made the lamps look like they had little halos. Utilitarian angels keeping watch over us. I nodded at the sentinels and headed to the back door. As I was jingling my keys, I heard something move inside the building. I jumped back from where I stood as if Zeus's bolts had jolted me.

"The heck," I whispered, clutching my keys tight so they'd stay silent. I caught myself holding my breath. Had Gene gotten here before me? That didn't seem likely. His BMW wasn't in the parking lot. Plus, the man couldn't get anywhere on time, let alone early.

But it sure sounded like someone was in there.

I pressed my ear against the cold, wet steel door. I focused my attention on the noises inside. Footsteps. The sounds of someone opening cabinet doors. Muffled words behind steel and concrete. I couldn't make out specific words, but you know the rhythm of speech when you hear it.

I quietly peeled off the door. What in the world was happening in there? I glanced down at the keys. To enter or not to enter. What would Willy Shakes have to say about this situation? Probably nothing, as he's just bones and dust at this point.

While I was idling on about dead authors, the light in the parking lot winked out. Perfect. I was hiding in the dark, contemplating what monster was hiding in a haunted building, while a thick mist whipped around me. If I weren't wearing my comfy Kermit the Frog Crocs, this could be an opening scene in the latest fantasy series. It left me wondering who'd be my shining prince riding atop a white steed.

There was the rumble of an engine behind me. I turned in time to see a white Dodge Sprinter van break through the fog. The green lettering on the side of the van announced that "Lancelot Medical Supply Company" had arrived right on time. Despite everything, I laughed. My shining knight was Norm, the medicine delivery guy.

He seemed surprised to see me outside and gave me a half-wave before hopping out. Norm was a late-twenties white suburban man straight from central casting. If he had dreams or hopes or desires, he kept them under his well-worn Kansas City Royals cap.

"Crazy fog, ain't it? Almost missed the turn. Whatcha doing out here? Running late this morning?"

"I'm the reluctant early bird," I said. "Pretty sure I missed the worm."

Norm politely chuckled. "Gotta set two alarms. That's what I do. If I only had one, I'd sleep right through it. Why I set a second one in the living room. Forces me to get up."

"I live in a studio apartment. I only have a living room."

"Suppose that would be a challenge," he said. "You wanna open up so we can unload these boxes?"

"Norm, I think I hear someone inside."

"Co-worker?"

I shook my head.

"Hmm, Doc come in early?"

I gave him a look. "When have you ever heard of doctors coming in early? Especially at a clinic?"

"True," he said. "I always wanna give them the benefit of the doubt. I think it's because of the whole 'do no harm' thing," Norm said, before he abruptly stopped speaking. His brain caught on to what I was suggesting. Finally.

He hunched and whispered, "Oh, hell's brass bells, are you talking about a thief?"

"Or a ghost. Which is better?"

"Should we call the cops?"

"With this fog, it'd take them forever to get here. These guys will be halfway to Tijuana with our stuff before they show up."

"Is there another car in the front patient parking lot?"

"I haven't checked."

"Wouldn't that be a good start?"

"Norm, would you recommend sending a delicate lady like myself to stroll to the front of a clinic you thought was being robbed? In whiteout conditions?"

His cheeks flushed red. "Valid point," he said. "For the record, I've never thought of you as delicate." I shoot him a look. "No, no, I-I don't mean that in a bad way. I just got the feeling that you know how to handle yourself, is all."

"I'm wearing Kermit Crocs," I deadpanned. "Also, Kermit has Miss Piggy fight his battles. It's their dynamic."

"I never cared for the show," Norm said, before adding, "Wait, am I Miss Piggy in this scenario?"

"If the dress fits," I said.

"Let's go. If we see something weird, we call the cops."

Clinging to the side of the building, we gradually made our way to the front parking lot. While we walked, I realized this was the longest time I'd ever spent with Norm. We'd made small talk, but that was it. I honestly knew nothing about him other than his occupation. Unlike him, I had exactly zero hunches about his personality.

"I thought you guys usually had two people open the clinic together?"

"We're supposed to," I said.

"Where's your second?"

"It's Gene. He's not exactly reliable."

"Gene…is he the balding guy? Skinny? Scraggly beard?"

"He shaved the beard, thank God, but yes."

"I thought he was a manager."

"Boss's kid."

"One of those," he said as we got to the front parking lot. The fog was a little thinner here for now, but if it kept advancing, it wouldn't stay this way for long. The big news, though, was that there wasn't a car in the lot. Norm sighed. "I'll go peek in the front window."

I didn't stop him. He flipped his cap backwards and pressed his face against the front glass. Scanning, he shrugged. "I don't…wait…oh shit!" he whispered. He hurried back to me. "I saw someone standing near those saloon doors. Facing away from us."

"Was it Gene?"

"Hard to see. Wanna look?"

I didn't, but felt I should. I walked over and peered in. Sure enough, toward the double doors that separated the exam rooms from the treatment area, someone was standing there with their back to us. They weren't doing anything. No robbing. No clearing out meds. Just…standing.

"It looks like Gene," I said, once I got back over to Norm. "But he's acting weird. Even for him."

"Should we go inside?"

"Will you go in with me? I'm scared, and if this isn't Gene and I'm alone, well, I don't want to suggest anything untoward. Wouldn't be ladylike," I said, letting that drawl out like an angler looking for a monster to hook.

"Of course," he said. Knight arriving on a white steed? Maybe not. But I was happy for a delivery guy in a Sprinter van. "I have a delivery to make, anyway." Seeing my disappointment, he quickly course-corrected. "I mean, what kind of man would that make me if I let you go in alone?"

"A no-good, rotten scoundrel, as Me-ma used to say," I said. "But I'm too polite for that language." For the record, I called my grandma "nana." Nobody I knew growing up ever called their grandma "me-ma." But when the accent comes out, most people expect the 'southern-isms' to follow. I heard the beat and played my tune.

We returned to the back door. The fog had advanced and thickened. The air felt charged. I held my key over the lock. I turned to Norm. "Are you a good fighter?"

“In Tekken or…?”

I shook my head. "You have a weapon in the van?"

"Well, I have something that might work," he said. "It's kind of embarrassing, though."

My mind was swimming. What type of weapon could Norm have that would be embarrassing? He darted off to the van and, after some scrounging, came back holding something behind his back.

"What is it?"

He held out an old thigh-length gym sock with a knot tied at the top. He gripped the knot and let the sock fall from his hand. It dropped and bounced like a cheap bungee cord. There was something heavy and round inside.

"That's an eight ball," he said, looking down.

"A pool ball in a sock?"

"It's basically a mace," he said. "A cheap modern version, anyway. I've never used it. Don't want to, if I'm being honest."

"Is that your sock?"

"An old one, yes."

"Won't the ball rip through if you swing it?"

"I've swung it for practice. Hasn't broken yet."

"If it did, you'd just have a limp sock in your hand. Not much you can do with that."

"Do you want to have a weapon or not?"

I held up my hand. "I appreciate it. It'll work…or look hilarious when it fails."

"Mary-Ann, come on, now. I'm trying to…."

The overhead lights started blinking. Turning, we watched as it strobed but couldn't stay on. It was being choked out by the much denser fog. It was so bad now that the sky was blotted out. A glance at the time told me the sun should've started peeking down at us by now, but there was no sign of it.

Off in the distance, we heard thunder roll. Or, that's what we thought it was. It sounded like thunder. It was loud and rumbled. But deep in the ancient ape parts of my brain, there was a familiar fear that had nothing to do with the weather. Something older than that. More powerful. An ancestral sensation passed down through generations. A feeling that had lain dormant inside our minds until that ancient menace activated it again.

I felt that flicker now.

"You gonna open the door before the rain gets here?"

I shook myself back to the waking world. Turning the key in the lock as quietly as humanly possible, I heard the KA-CHUNK of the mechanism unlocking. Norm clutched his sock mace so tightly, his knuckles were white. Nodding at him, I swung the door open.

"H-hello?" I called out.

Footsteps sprinting away from us and a door slamming. I didn't need to see anything to know which door it was. It was exam room six. I tried to exit but ran smack into Norm, who had leaned forward to get a look, sock at the ready.

"Hello?" came a familiar voice from inside. Gene. What in the world was that man doing here so early? Where had he parked his car? What was he moving around?

"Gene?" I asked. "That you?"

"Who's that?"

"Mary-Ann," I said. "Where are you?"

"Up front."

"Doing what?"

"Up front."

I turned to Norm. "Pretty sure I'm gonna make it," I said with a smile. I nodded at his limp sock. "Thank you for being ready to brain someone with your old gym sock."

"Don't go in there," Norm said. I thought he was joking, but the concern on his face was genuine. "That's not Gene."

"What in God's green heaven are you talking about?"

"You don't feel that? How off the energy is here?"

I had. I didn't want to admit it to myself or Norm, but ever since I'd arrived, I'd felt an unease. "Something in the fog?"

"Yes," he whispered. "But also something inside. I don't think that's Gene."

"Sounds like him."

"I - I think it's a mimic. I've read about them," he said, before correcting himself. "Well, watched a lot of YouTube videos about them. They use a friend or family member's voice to lure people in."

"Gene and I are not kin nor friends," I said. "Truthfully, the man is a worm of the highest order. He's actually worse than a worm. I'd rather have lunch with a dozen Texas red wigglers than share a meal with him."

"I have a bad feeling about this," he said, his voice shaky. "It's been there since I walked outside and saw how thick the fog was."

"It's just fog, Norm," I said. "We get it pretty often."

Even as the words left my mouth and crashed into our reality, I didn't believe them. I was having the same feelings. Something was wrong—potentially two things - outside and in. I wasn't sure if I was trying to convince Norm or myself with my answer.

"I know, but… it's not just fog," Norm said. "I feel like it's covering something. Concealing it. I thought I was going crazy, and then all this started up. That make sense?"

The words got caught in my throat, and before they could escape, the lights inside the clinic winked out. Power lost. The hum of the machines slowed until they stopped. Everything went quiet. Like God hit mute on our remote.

Another rumble in the distance. Closer this time. The storm was approaching.

"Hello?" Gene - or faux Gene, we hadn't settled that yet - called out from the dark. "What's going on?"

"Come over here," I said. "I need help moving the boxes into the clinic."

"Mary-Ann?"

"I'm telling you, that's not him," Norm whispered. He let the billiard ball drop from his hand, pulling the sock taut. "It's a mimic."

"What are you gonna do, knock it into the side pocket?"

"Mary-Ann? Mary-Ann?" Gene said, sounding more like a myna bird than the dirtbag son of the clinic owner.

There was another rumble of thunder. Just down the street from us. Inching closer. Norm and I both flinched as it cracked above where we stood. I looked up but didn't see a flash of lightning. Nothing but fog. It had gotten so thick in such a short amount of time. It was now curled around Norm's van. Python fog, squeezing the life from the morning.

"Norm, the fog," I started. Another violent crack of thunder stopped me. It was just outside our driveway. It was so violent, I felt the sound waves vibrate through my bones. That was a secondary concern, though. As the thunder boomed and the fog crept closer, I heard a breathy voice speak into my ear.

*"We're here for you."*

I swatted at the side of my head as if a bug had crawled in there. Norm, stunned by my sudden impromptu dance move, nervously jumped away. I turned to him, and my face said everything I needed to say in a glance.

"You heard that, too?" he asked.

"I think we should go inside," I said, against my better judgment.

Norm tightened his grip on the sock. "I agree. I'll go in first."

No argument from me. I slid aside. He took a deep breath and walked into the alcove. I glanced back at the fog. It had nearly enveloped the entire van. In the vapor, I heard movement. The wet slap of skin on concrete. I didn't hang around to find out what it was.

We got inside the building, and I locked the door. I didn't want to, but my instincts snapped in and I flipped the deadbolt without a second thought. Keep the monsters out. For a brief, sublime second, I forgot that there was also something unexplainable *inside* this building, too.

Some days, the bear doesn't just get you. It flays you and wears your skin as a scarf.

"Lemme turn on a light," I whispered, pulling out my phone. The beam was weak, but it provided enough light for the time being.

"Mary-Ann? Mary-Ann?" Gene called out again. The voice was coming through the double saloon doors that led to the exam rooms. Right where we'd seen the figure.

"I think this is why the phrase between a rock and a hard place took off," Norm whispered. Sweat was rolling down his nose. He wiped it with the sleeve of his uniform and sighed. "The fog should lift soon. It should. The sun should be rising. Has to be."

I applauded his commitment to positivity, but I'd been drifting down shit creek for quite some time. Not even Kermit's smiling, plastic face beaming up from my Crocs could convince me we were going to be okay.

The frog had a point: it sure wasn't easy being green.

We huddled together in the alcove, not moving. With a random ghost chirping at us - well, me anyway - moving into the treatment area of the clinic was a no-go. I wasn't sure if this thing could move and didn't want to be the employee responsible for inviting it out of exam room six and to where we earn our daily bread.

Point was, we were trapped. There wasn't any place for us to go. Outside was, well, who knew what. Inside was a mimic trying to lure me into the dark for God knows what reason. Ground clouds had swallowed Norm's van.

Only getting a month of weekends off to deal with supernatural horrors was starting to feel like a god-awful deal on my part.

WHUMP! WHUMP! WHUMP! WHUMP!

Something heavy slammed into the back door. We both yelped but quickly placed our hands over our mouths to muffle the noise. There was no window in the door, so we could only guess what was violent and dumb enough to throw themselves at pure steel. Whatever it was, it was way worse than any solicitor hawking solar panels, that's for damn sure.

*"Inside."*

The ethereal voice again. I know Norm heard it too, because he looked back at the exit. Sweat beaded on his forehead. His body was shaking. If he were a drawing, there'd be squiggly lines all around him. "Nothing but hail from the storm."

"Mary-Ann," Gene called out. He was closer now, too. From where we were standing at the back door, I could see the swinging double doors. They were closed. Nothing had come through. Yet.

"What do you do with a mimic?" I asked, the fear bringing out my authentic drawl.

"I'm, I'm not sure," he said. "I've seen a few videos, but they, they never talk about how to get rid of it."

"Hell's half acre," I said, the twang in full effect now. I opened my phone and started typing in the search bar.

"Do you think the internet is going to have an answer?"

"Norm, I'm as lost as last year's Easter egg," I said. Before he could ask, "I don't know what to do. Maybe someone out there has a clue."

I punched in "mimic what to do" and got a result. A hopeful little cheer escaped my lips. Then I started reading.

"Mimic is a 1997 science-fiction horror movie starring Mira Sorvino…goddamn useless AI answer! Who wants this shit?!"

"Mary-Ann? Come here. I need help."

"I don't think he needs help," Norm said.

"You think?" I snapped.

I made a face like I'd just eaten rancid meat and punched myself in the thigh. Why was this happening to me? What god had I angered? Worse, I had accidentally included Norm in this whole thing, too. All he was guilty of was being punctual.

"I can see them," Gene called. "I can see you, too."

The double doors wavered. Norm and I held our breaths as hard as he clutched his sock mace. I shone my phone light toward the door. My tremulous hand quivered and bounced the beam up and down like the line on an EKG.

"Something is standing there," Norm whispered. "Look in the crack between the doors."

I'd already seen it, but was hoping it was the dark playing tricks on me. It wasn't.

"How do you think Mira Sorvino would handle this?" I joked.

The smartass in me came out in times of crisis. Admittedly, not my best quality. I expected Norm to be annoyed, but he gave me a small smile when he turned to me.

"I'm going to rush the door," Norm said. "Scare them away."

My brows furrowed. "Why?"

"Maybe they'll leave?"

"It's a ghost, not a bunch of raccoons in the dumpster."

Norm kept on, ignoring my barb. "They leave, and we get a few minutes to clear our heads and plan an escape. If that's even possible."

My whole body and face objected to this dumb ass idea, but before words could join in, Norm held his hand up and halted my incoming response. "I'm a lost egg too," he said, butchering my southernism. "This is a long shot, I know, but what the hell else are we supposed to do? My years of delivering medicine haven't exactly prepared me for this scenario."

"But scaring a ghost?" I asked. "That's the move?"

He smiled. "It's what Mira would do."

I laughed. Couldn't be helped.

He nodded at my phone. "Kill the light, huh?"

I placed my phone in my pocket, putting the spotlight to sleep. Norm moved to the wall where the door was and shook out his nerves. He let the sock drop and cocked his arm. Ready to swing his Mizuno mace at anything threatening his life. Quietly, he started slinking along the wall. Nervous sweat had turned that Royals cap from blue to almost black. The saloon doors loomed large.

My eyes flickered from him to the door so fast, it looked like I was watching Olympic ping-pong. The shadow of the mimic was still there. Still menacing us. From behind me, I could hear something scraping along the outside door. Nails? Claws? Was it searching for a way in? A spike of fear hit my heart. Panic and anxiety were tapping into my nervous system. I'd need my wits sharp if I wanted to survive this.

I closed my eyes and slowed my breathing. We had to deal with one problem at a time. Whatever was out there could stay out there. No need to solve both ghost problems at once. Problems, like busted escalators and broken relationships, are best dealt with one step at a time.

Norm got within an arm's length of the swinging door. Ghost Gene was still standing there. I couldn't make out any features of his face. It was just a form that filled in what should have been an empty space. For a fleeting second, I thought of my ex. He took up space, too. Trauma is its own kind of haunting, isn't it?

As Norm was about to make his blind jump at the double doors, the power kicked back on. The burst of light should've been heavenly after our time in the darkness, but its sudden arrival shocked our vision. Norm took a step back and slammed his eyes shut. I did the same.

When I opened them back up, the figure was gone from the door. But they were still in the clinic. Somewhere in the shadows. Waiting. Watching. Plotting.

Norm stood and blinked away the burned images. "What the hell?"

He had more to say. Another question or two to inquire about. But those remained unasked as a large glass bottle came hurtling through the air and crashed into his forehead. Medical bottles can withstand a lot of jostling, but Norm's head must be concrete because it shattered on contact.

Dozens of pills and bits of glass rained down. They pinged off the ground and scattered in all directions. A cut opened up on his forehead. The cut was slight but grew larger as the welt under it swelled. Before he could respond, his eyes rolled back into his head, and he joined the pills sprawled on the floor.

I rushed over and went into nurse mode. The lights overhead started flickering again. Once I had Norm stable, I looked in the direction from where the pills had come. Gene was there. In the corner. Looking away from me. I felt a surge of anger and let it out in a scream.

"What the hell is your problem, bitch?" No twang this time. Just pure rage.

At once, every cabinet door in the treatment room slammed open, and everything on the shelves came crashing out onto the floor. I screamed and held my hands up to protect my face. Glancing over to where Gene had been standing yielded diddly-squat.

He was gone.

I scanned the space. Nothing. Was it gone or hiding? My answer came in the form of another violent outburst. One of the IV stands across the room took flight and came screaming for my head. I dropped to avoid being impaled by the blunt end, but one caster caught just above my temple. Pain blossomed and spread across my head like an invasive weed. I touched the spot and winced.

The lights in the clinic shut off again. I ducked down between two exam tables. I tried to collect myself, but was struggling. My thoughts were water in a broken glass. I was trying to hold everything together, but it felt impossible. Everything was coming undone.

"Mary-Ann," Gene said. "Come here."

Not a chance, I thought. I wanted revenge. Anger raced through my body. Preparing myself for action. My hands balled into fists. Skin flushed red. My teeth bared and ready to strike. Vision colored crimson. It was more than anger.

I was rage.

I had become Venkman, destroyer of ghosts. Unadulterated fury pushed aside any thoughts of how to achieve my revenge. Just violence in my veins. I was mad. Curse-out-a-cheater mad. Yell-at-a-Karen mad. Fight-with-my-parents mad.

"Mary-Ann," Gene said. Another bottle of pills sailed over my head. "Mary-Ann. Mary-Ann. Mary-Ann!"

It threw another bottle. Like the one that hit Norm's melon, it smashed into a nearby wall. A firework of glass and pills exploded all around me. I watched the blue pills hit the ground, bounce, and roll until they finally came to a stop. Well, no more forward progress. But they all were still vibrating from some unfelt hum around us.

THUMP! THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!

The things in the fog were beating on the steel door. I crawled away from the shattered pill bottles and back to the alcove. The strikes against the door were violent and loud. Small dents started forming from the blows. The inside of the door now resembled a topographical map.

Why were they getting violent? For that matter, why had Gene gotten more violent? Before today, the ghost in exam room six would only appear in glimpses. In shadows. It never spoke. Never threw things. Why was it acting out?

As more medical equipment went sailing through the air, a thought came to me. Norm and I had both heard something in the fog say, "We're here for you." Who they were seemed unknowable. The real question I struggled with was why *they* were here at all? Why come to a medium-sized city? Why come to an out-of-the-way medical clinic? Why try to break in?

Why come after me?

"Mary-Ann." It was Norm. He'd woken up. The bruises turned his forehead into a Rothko painting. "What happened?"

"Ghost Gene throws things now," I said.

He touched his head and winced. When he looked at his fingers, he saw fresh blood on the tips. "I don't like…."

Norm's eyes went wide. The color ran out of his face. I didn't need to feel his hands to know they were clammy. This map was leading him to one place: he was about to faint.

"Stay still," I said. "Try to control your breathing. You're gonna be okay. It's just a little…."

THUMP.

Norm passed back out. On the way to Sleepsville, his head hit the wall. The impact caused a small crack to form in the drywall. The white residue dotted his face like an artist running their thumb over the tips of a brush to create stars in the night sky. Norm was out. I swallowed hard. I was alone.

Gene was calling for me and throwing things all over the room. The creatures outside were incessantly beating on the back door. Pushing myself back against the wall near the alcove, I shut my eyes tight. I brought my legs up to my chest and wrapped my arms around my knees. Placing my elbows over my ears, I tried to drown out the noise. If I sat still long enough, this whole thing would blow over.

*We're here for you.*

The phrase beat against the walls of my skull. Logically, none of this made sense. Yet, the entire ordeal evoked familiar feelings I'd long buried in the depths of my brain. Fights. Real knock-down-drag-out ones.

Old battles flooded my cortex. My ex and I right before the whole engagement blew up, and I moved away. When my roommate admitted she had stolen rent money from me. That time I got nose to nose with a cat caller.

But those paled in comparison to the big ones that scared me. Memories bubbled up of Mom and Dad going at it before their divorce. Colorful phrases. Big accusations. Harsh truths. Hiding from the fear. Watching the Muppets to drown out their screaming. Feeling like I was stuck in the middle.

*The middle.*

My eyes shot open. Kermit's unblinking gaze stared back at me. The smallest green shoot of an idea broke through the topsoil in my mind. What if…what if it is just like those fights? What if they weren't after me or Norm?

What if they were fighting with each other?

"Kermit, you magnificent bastard."

Jumping up from the floor, a crazy plan quickly formed. I looked at where Norm had passed out. He was still slumbering like baby Jesus in the manger. I heard the crashing of more equipment in the treatment area. His attention wasn't on us.

I rushed over to the door. The creatures in the fog were still there. Still wailing away at the steel. I put my hand on the handle, and the lights in the clinic shut off. Everything went still. The only sounds were Norm's concussed snores.

"Mary-Ann."

Gene. He was standing directly behind me. Like before, he kept his gaze in the opposite direction. His true face still hidden. It didn't matter - fear still gripped my heart and gave it a squeeze.

"Mary-Ann. What are you doing?"

The creatures in the fog went wild at the sound of his voice. Like I'd just paraded around starving dogs in a meat suit. Frenzied. Bedlam. They could sense Gene near the door. It cemented my hunch. These things didn't want me or Norm.

They wanted Gene.

The lights inside the clinic began to strobe. I glanced at where Gene had been standing. He was gone. That's when I felt the hair on my neck move. Freezing fingers drag across my skin. A raspy voice in my ear, "They'll kill you, too."

"No," I said. "They won't." I yanked the door open, and the fog outside surged in. There was a rumble in the clouds, but it wasn't from lightning. It sounded like dozens of voices speaking at once in a language I'd never heard before. Something inhuman. Ancient.

The commotion nudged Norm back into the land of the living. His eyes fluttered open, but he couldn't believe what they were seeing. "Mary-Ann!" he yelled. "What's happening!?"

I heard his voice, but just barely. I couldn't respond even if I wanted to. The voices crying out from the clouds had funneled into the clinic. Hidden creatures rushed into our building.

Gene had disappeared as soon as I had wrenched the door open. I heard him move through the treatment room, knocking into the mess on the floor. Sending bottles and equipment flying in its wake.

Hell followed with him.

Gene fled through the swinging double doors. The fog chased him. As more of them streamed in from the outside, the noise in the clinic grew louder. I could barely hear the slamming of a door from the hallway, but I instantly knew where Gene had gone. Exam room six.

He was trying to hide from these things.

Norm crawled over to where I had dropped and curled into a ball. He was saying something and pointing, but the deafening noise of chanting voices was too loud to make it out. He shook my shoulder, and I opened my eyes. My jaw dropped.

What looked like a white snake of fog poured in from outside. It ran through the treatment area and shot down the exam room hallways. I now say it was a snake, but at that moment, it brought to mind an umbilical cord. Connection between mother and child.

From the exam room, we heard a scream. Inhuman pain. The chanting voices got louder. The fog began to glow and pulse. There was crashing and thrashing coming from the hallway.

They'd found Gene.

I pushed myself behind the open door and curled into the fetal position. I snapped my eyes shut again and covered my ears with my arms. Seconds later, I felt Norm's body as he squeezed in next to me. He draped his frame over mine, repeating something that sounded like a prayer.

The double doors flew off their hinges as the fog started retracting from the building. Over the chanting and my attempt to block the outside world, I could hear Gene screaming "Mary-Ann" repeatedly. It got louder as the fog dragged his form past us. As soon as it crossed the threshold, the door slammed shut and everything went quiet.

The power turning back on was what finally made me open my eyes. The first thing I saw was a sweat-stained Kansas City Royals cap. I nudged Norm in the ribs, and he opened his eyes as well. Realizing that he was squishing me, he quickly moved and apologized.

The air was still, but it felt new. Clean. The heaviness was gone. The room still looked like an F5 tornado had torn through it, but I didn't feel Gene. That evil energy was gone.

I stood and swung open the back door. I expected to find a wall of fog, but I saw the orange rays of the rising sun. The sky was clear. The fog was gone. No storm damage. No water from rain. Nothing.

"What the hell?" Norm said, taking in the scene.

"Where did everything go?"

"Including the time," he said. I turned to him. He held up his phone. It was only 6:10 in the morning. "There is no way that only took ten minutes to happen."

"At least thirty," I said, confused. "Maybe more."

A brand new cherry red BMW turned into the parking lot. Despite being early in the morning, the radio blared some Euro dance music. It came to a stop in the handicapped spot. Gene - the real one - hopped out of his car and shot finger guns at Norm and me.

"What are you goobers staring at? Never seen a new car before?" He hit his fob and locked his car. He turned his wrist and looked down at his Rolex. "Six ten! I'm early!" he said with a smile. "Set two alarms to get here on time."

"Did you see any fog?" Norm asked.

"Only the mild brain fog I had waking up this early. Had to get some 'go-juice' before my mind started firing on all cylinders," Gene said with a yawn.

"No storm?" I followed up. "And before you start spouting nonsense, I just mean a rainstorm."

"Dry as an old lady," Gene said with a wink. "We gonna unload this truck or what?"

"Or what," I said.

Confused, Gene laughed. "Lemme go place my *schtuff* in my locker. Then we can do whatever." He started walking inside the building, but stopped and turned back to us. "I should mention that I tweaked my back windsurfing, so I might not be able to move any boxes. Cool? Cool."

He walked inside. I looked at Norm and then held up three fingers. Two fingers. One finger. On cue, Gene screamed, "What the fuck happened in here?"

"You okay?" Norm asked.

"Are you?" I said, touching the top of my head.

He felt his wound, winced, and smiled. "I'll live. I have to see Bobby Witt win a World Series."

"I don't know what that means. Is he a player or…?"

Gene came out, his face aghast. "What happened?"

"You wouldn't believe me if I told you," I said.

"Try me."

"Creatures in a thick fog abducted the ghost from exam room six. He threw a fit and trashed the place before they dragged him off."

"Plus the time dilation," Norm added.

Gene looked at me and then Norm. "Did you two crack into the meds or something?"

"No," I said. "But I am leaving to grab some breakfast. You got this, right?"

"What? I don't open alone. If you leave, I'll tell my dad."

"Bless your heart," I said in a drawl so thick you'd get a foot caught stepping in it.

"You're Southern?" Gene said. "If you leave, you're gonna lose your job."

I shrugged. "Norm? Wanna get Denny's?"

"Yup."

"Mary-Ann! Mary-Ann! Come here! I need help!"

Norm and I started laughing. The real thing had replaced the mimic. He sucked as much as his ghost version. We both left Gene standing there ranting and raving. He kicked a nearby pole and collapsed to the ground in pain. I smiled.
