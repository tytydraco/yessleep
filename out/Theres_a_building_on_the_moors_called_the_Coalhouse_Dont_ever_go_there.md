The first time I saw the Coalhouse was in a dream. In it, I drove along a bumpy, two-rut track over moorland, not knowing where I was going, but with a foreboding that left me jittery. The day was slate grey and the bracken waved around the barrens, as wind sprites seemed to run this way and that all across it. The car I drove came out of the nineties—all triangular angles, hand-cranked windows and pop-out ashtrays. The track arced over a ridge and a large building rolled into view at a distance. I took in the sight as the road led me in its direction; a brutal stone rectangle with a gable roof. It stood three storeys high and its length, which ran along the edge of a valley one-hundred-and-twenty feet deep, could have comfortably fit fifty windows to a floor, though few actual windows had been doled out in the design, and the ones that existed seemed to be dotted around on the building’s face haphazard, like rare afterthoughts, and their ancient, crud-covered panes blended with the stone to diminish them entirely. I’d have guessed the edifice was constructed as a nineteenth century workhouse or prison. And—at least in its existent form—I wouldn’t have been far wrong.

The rutted road came to an end at the near side of the valley, which cut the building off, leaving no way for a vehicle to reach it. I cranked the handbrake and clambered out into the open air, where the wind ran riot around my hair. Gazing across the gulf, I spotted a figure standing to one side of the building, by the main entrance. Even at this distance I recognised Malena. That Malena was dead made no odds. Her dress snapped with the gusts, hailing me like semaphore.

I started desperately in the direction of the vision. A jagged footpath led me down into the valley and underneath the bite of the wind. At first I imagined Malena’s gaze trained on my descent, but as soon as I got below sight of the ground level I began to doubt she had ever stood there. The building itself still jutted up above me, as though peering down in judgement. Among the hardy foliage of the valley bank, black grains lay dotted around—coal fragments. A rivulet dribbled through the scrubby dip of the valley, which I got over in a single large step and then, huffing, I strode my way zigzag up the track on the opposing bank. Finally, the grey building confronted me, its stones slick and darkened by fungal life. Not waiting to catch my breath, I waded roughly through knee-high bracken along the perimeter towards the front of the building, to where Malena had stood.

Or wait, had she?

Only the wind hurtled over empty moor to greet me as a I rounded the corner. If the front had once boasted an outdoor space, an entrance driveway for example, it had been lost entirely to time—bracken grew thick right up to the double doors. The great doors themselves were composed of knotty beams, ash-coloured hardwood, each beam as thick as a man’s torso. Above the arch, the name of the establishment was chiselled into the stone in large, old-fashioned lettering: “the Coalhouse.” The doors seemed rooted, set and locked in time. No way I would get them open; I bargained even hewing through with an axe would cost a serious day’s work. For that reason I was surprised when I pushed at them and they responded with a slight play, a bounce under my hand. I pressed once more, this time with force, and gasped when they gave like butter, as though a pair of concierges had heard me loitering and drawn the doors back in my service.

I stepped into the foyer of the Coalhouse and it was like crossing incongruently from cold reality onto a living movie set. I had expected a lightless, mouldering husk of a building inside, instead I found the reception hall of a hotel straight out of bygone days. Cast-iron braziers set with glass radiated a smoky paraffin glow from their brackets on the walls. A grandmother clock ticked pacifically in a dark recess beneath the main staircase. Everything was decked out in walnut: the flooring; the wall panels, the balustrade on the first floor. The fittings were all brass. No one was around.

‘Hello?’ I said dumbly. Flatly.

The wall facing the left side of the staircase housed a reception booth, masked by frosted glass. From behind the glass there came a low creak, and I caught a glimpse of movement from what looked like a seated figure. As I walked over I realised the glass was not originally frosted, but appeared to be made opaque by some kind of gunk built up on the other side of the pane. Through the glass, I could only make out the grey shadow of the person attending the desk.

‘Excuse me, is this a hotel? Is this place open?’ I asked.

‘You’re here to lend a hand.’ The voice was gritty, atonal in a strange way. Female I thought, though I couldn’t be sure.

‘Er, no. Wrong person. Unlikely as it sounds, I was just passing and wandered in.’

A straight mix of aggression and despair. ‘You won’t help me?’

I glanced downwards. A semi-circle had been cut out of the bottom of the glass and rimmed with brass, such as the type of gap used to pass identification and money in a bank. If I squatted right down I’d be able to peer through this hole directly up at whoever I was talking to. I was tempted, but I didn’t know, at the same time the idea unsettled me.

‘What… what is it you need?’

‘You need to find him. I need to find him.’

‘Who?’

‘Albert.’

‘And who’s Albert?’

‘Albert. He left me. Up on the moors. I pulled it out myself you know.’

I couldn’t follow this conversation. ‘I don’t know who Albert is. Listen, are you the receptionist?’

‘You’re not going to leave me are you Albert? It’s okay now. I pulled it out myself anyway.’

Something was not right, I felt it in my bones the way an old sailor detects a cold front coming. Slowly, hesitantly, I lowered myself on my haunches and peeked through the transaction gap.

She was a woman after all, most likely in her mid-thirties. She looked kind of done up for a 1940s-themed murder mystery party, in a high-collar dress and rolled-back pompadour. This was not the striking thing about her though. Her skin had turned to grey-blue marble. Three great, elongated-diamond gashes blighted her face, obliterating the left side of her upper lip and carving chaos up through her cheekbone and into the hairline between the eye and ear—dry, umber valleys wrought of violence in her features. She clasped a meat cleaver in one hand.

‘I pulled it out myself you know,’ she said.

I stumbled back so hard I collided with the banister of the central staircase.

The shadow beyond the glass rose to its feet, silhouette of the cleaver visible to one side. She growled now: ‘you’re not going to leave me here like this are you?! You have to help me!’ She turned and moved beyond the frame of the glass. My eyes followed the trajectory and rested with horror on a door that communicated between the foyer and the booth. I glanced at the entrance only to find it somehow closed and barred with a heavy beam. In any case I had come to find Malena, no way I could leave yet. I bolted instead for the rear of the foyer as the receptionist jiggered the brass door knob.

‘You can’t leave me out here like this Albert! I won’t allow it!’

Behind the staircase lived another set of double doors. I ducked through under a volley of pleas. ‘You have to help me! You have to find him!’ I careened into the adjoining room, slamming the doors behind me. ‘Albert! Albert…’ The shouts petered out; did that mean the cleaver woman had made it out of the booth?

I took a breath and turned to encounter some kind of dining-hall-cum-ballroom. A stage stood untrodden at the far end. The space was a sea of unadorned round tables, and great chandeliers lit up the area, held among the beams by massive chains. These chandeliers stuck to the Coalhouse theme, being built from rings of black iron paraffin lamps. On the left wall, a pair of swing doors led off, most likely to a catering area. Some sort of catastrophe had occurred in the middle of the hall. There, tables and chairs lay about upturned, piled, strewn and splintered. I floated towards the damage, curious yet wary. A rough space had been entirely cleared of furniture, an area of around fifteen by fifteen feet. And caked all over the floor was thick, dark, dried blood, brown in its staleness. I raised my hand to my face to mask the stench—there are few smells ranker than old blood. Just beyond the cataclysmic haemorrhage someone had carved words into the floorboards in big, ugly letters:

*Angwynne, left hand of the Bull God*

The carving knife had been left for punctuation, stabbed into the bottom of the “d”—an ornate specimen, curved blade, its gilt handle muckied by a blood handprint. There were no signs of a body. Cursed, I thought. This building has been cursed by some grievous event, and now only bad things may happen here. At that instant, a person standing in the doorway beside the stage caught my eye.

‘Malena!’

There she was; my deceased wife. She mustn’t have heard me cry out. She turned and slipped through the portal, closing it silently behind her. I stumbled after her, clattering through a hillock of chairs.

‘Wait.’

A plain corridor led off behind the door; bare floorboards, rows of rough-cut doors on either side, nothing painted, not an inch decorated. Whatever function this part of the building served, it no longer felt like a hotel. No Malena in sight, I blundered along the passage, rattling at the locked doors, rapping on the panels.

‘Malena…’

At the end of the hall I rounded a corner and deep darkness confronted me. Only in the distance could I make out a meagre orange glow. The air hung heavy with must, and it appeared some yards ahead part of the corridor’s roof had collapsed; a beam skewered downwards through the floor. What little I could see showed signs of long age and rot. This was how I’d expected find the building when I first entered. I peered back over my shoulder and my heart collapsed.

The corridor I had just come down now lay unlit; it too suddenly twisted and rotted with time. Adrenaline pumped furious through my system. I could find no sense in my situation. Here I was, abruptly cast deep into the belly of a dark crumbling hulk on the moors. Leagues from anywhere or anyone. Remote. Exposed. Abandoned by sense. The only sliver of hope left to me, I realised, was that faint glow way down in the distance. I stumbled onward while the boards beneath my feet groaned and threatened to crack, my shoes kicking up chunks of softened wood as though it were wet cork. The entire corridor hungered to cave in around me, to swallow me down into the gut of the building forever. I slipped over unseen debris, my hands reached out and slapped against walls. The weighty air was oxygenless, poison that wrapped itself around me and suffocated. The light… hone in on the light. As I closed in, the diffuse glimmer formed into a point, a spot to focus on, to clamber at. And when finally I came within reach I distinguished the source—a single portable paraffin lamp hanging on a hook from the roof. No saviour, but at least it could illuminate the way from hereon out.

I wrangled the lamp down and thrust it out. Just ahead the corridor widened before ending in a flight of broad steps, leading down. I hesitated. Malena was somewhere here, yet I had been so shaken by all that had happened since I crossed the Coalhouse’s threshold I barely dared move. Perhaps it was better to find my way back out.

The whisper came from below.

‘Peter…’

That was my name. I couldn’t be sure, but the voice might well have been Malena’s. My reservations fell away, I lumbered towards the origin of the whisper, cantered down the stairs. A short passage met me at the bottom, terminating in a pair of iron doors. Before the portal stood Malena, staring at me with a distant, inquisitive look. She clutched at a pillow, and the pillowcase bore that same flowery print as the bed sheets in which she had died.

‘There you are,’ I said, not believing the words as they came out.

Something almost indescribable happened then. I thought I saw Malena as a different woman, her wiry ginger hair tied up with sisal string, wearing a smile fouled by tartar-covered teeth. Yet nothing had changed. She was still Malena.

‘Come down to me,’ she said. She held the pillow out, brandishing it in front of her with both hands, and advanced.

I backed away, but the bottom step lay directly behind my heels and blocked my retreat. I fell instead onto the stairs, cracking my spine sharply against the risers. As I toppled the lamp slipped from my grasp and shattered on the steps; paraffin washed everywhere and the flame rushed to follow. My trouser legs caught fire eagerly, casting a bright orange glow around the stairwell. And then agony. Hair and skin seared off my calves. I smelt myself cooking. Beyond the flames the ginger woman lowered her pillow and grinned in satisfaction.

&#x200B;

My eyes shot open. My hand reached out to the empty space on the other side of the bed. I mentioned that this was a dream, but forgive me if I contradict myself. As far as I can make out it did happen between going to sleep one night and waking up next morning. Like a dream, the story is littered with fantastic elements, impossibilities and incongruities. But every fibre of my being tells me I was there, as real and vivid and concrete as any waking memory I can dredge up. I don’t know what you’d call it, but “dream” short-changes the bill.

I lay on the bed for I don’t know how long, paralysed between worlds. At some point my bones dragged themselves up and I found myself preparing a pot of coffee in the kitchen. I was just pouring when there came a knock at the door of my flat. I shuffled into the hallway and blindly clawed the door open.

The mutilated receptionist stood in the frame, brandishing her cleaver. Her face contorted, allowing the gashes to reveal a giant cavity in her skull. ‘You’re not going leave me out here like this are you!?’ She raised the cleaver as I yelped and slammed the door. The cleaver thudded into the far side. Then it came again. Then again but quicker. The thuds sped up, though as they did they became softer in tone. Eventually they began to sound like simple knocks.

‘Peter! Peter what the fuck?’

That was the voice of my sister Suzie. I used the spy-hole this time and discovered my sibling’s angered face in the hall. Tentatively, I opened the door and Suzie bristled in with a shopping bag.

‘What did you do that for? You need mental help. You look like crap by the way.’ She marched into the kitchen and I mindlessly followed. My sister set the shopping down on the counter. ‘This self-pity act has to stop. What would Malena think if she saw you now?’

*Malena can’t think*, I wanted to reply, *she’s dead*. But what would have been the point?

Suzie took my silence as a victory. ‘I brought you food but you can’t keep relying on me.’ She unpacked the groceries on the sideboard. As usual it was all the pretentious stuff she liked for herself: disgusting patés; olives stuffed with pimento, sourdough bread. ‘You can give me thirty quid for this.’

’Take it,’ I said. She knew where my money was.

She swished past me into the living room to grab the cash. ‘Look, the third anniversary of Malena’s death is coming up. Three years Peter! Why don’t you prepare, do something nice, get the last of that grief out of your system, go crazy and break down if you have to, and then draw a line under it? This is too much now.’

But it wasn’t too much. It would never be too much as far as I was concerned.

That night was not the last I would be transported to the Coalhouse. Each time a Coalhouse dream came, some phantom or other would hound me around the dark building on the moors. Most times I’d pursue Malena, in other instances the ginger woman made an appearance. Often I would die horribly at the end. The more I had the dreams, the further away reality seemed when I came to. And sometimes the dreams merged into my waking hours, until I didn’t know which was which. Since Malena’s sickness and death I had ceased work as a reporter and wound up in this grotty flat down the rough end of town. But I had made a decent investigative journalist at one time. Over the following weeks I applied the few remaining nuts and bolts of my skill-set to tracking down talk of a building on the moors called the Coalhouse. I became adamant it was a real place and I had been there—even if it had been a dream, the dream had contained too much detail. I worked under the theory that my knowledge of the Coalhouse must lay trapped in some kind of repressed memory, perhaps a forgotten childhood trauma. I found my way onto an un-indexed forum on the dark web with a sub-forum entitled *placeinmydreams*. This sub-forum was a dedicated space for people to share their experiences of any location they had visited, but only during their sleeping hours. I planned to make a post of my Coalhouse visits on the off-chance someone might identify the real-life place. Through journalistic habit, I first searched the forum using the term “coalhouse.” I never imagined retrieving a page full of hits.

One user spoke of a moorland workhouse hiding coal-filled cellars, where they suffered a gruesome encounter with a half-skeletal man brandishing a snake whip. Another told of a bleak stay at the Coalhouse hotel, a place where shadows entered doors in the distance, but the guest in question was unable to catch up to and speak with anyone. Yet another user posted about a missing partner who had mentioned nightmares of a place called the Coalhouse in the months running up to their disappearance. There were comments below these entries, with some commenters confessing to similar dreams. It surprised me that no mega-thread had emerged from these individual puzzle pieces. Armed with this new knowledge I crafted my own post, laying out my night terrors, connecting similarities to previous posts, adding in links and calling on the general population of this sub-forum to sit up and take note. I ended with this:

“I am not a superstitious guy, but the multiple independent reports found on this forum match too neatly for coincidence. I’m dead set on tracking down the source of these Coalhouse dreams, to get a handle on them before they totally overwhelm me. Any information you could give, no matter how small, might be crucial. Thanks in advance for your input.”

The next day I opened my laptop to check for responses. I had a number of commenters simply praising me in one way or another for the engrossing thread. Six people claimed they too had visited a place called the Coalhouse in their dreams. Two of these were obvious works of bad fiction, and from journalistic experience I knew all of them could turn out false; you just can’t trust what you read on the internet. I had inspired these people with my tale, and perhaps they believed what I wrote an elaborate fiction to begin with. Still, one or two stories looked worth a follow-up.

I discovered by far the most interesting reply in my direct messages, and it came from the user who had previously spoken about her missing partner. This is what she wrote:

*I’ve been researching the Coalhouse for some time now, just over five years, ever since I lost Beth. I have tons of information on its history. I will pass this data to you, but only if you agree to meet face-to-face. I won’t share it over the internet.*

That suited me. I had always found meeting sources a valuable step in weighing the reliability of the info. Get them up close, look them in the eye. Find out what’s making them tick. I arranged to meet with her in the café of a village two-thirds of the way to her home city, setting out from my location. The café in question straddled a design space between chintz and earth hippy (likely based on the villagers’ cultural make-up), and it smelt like carrot quiche and arabica beans. I got there early after a couple of hours drive, ordered myself a lungo and sat doing the crossword with one eye on the entrance. My glass was empty before a woman bearing dark lines under her eyes shambled in and approached me.

‘I’m Carly,’ she said, offering me her hand.

‘Peter. Take a seat. Can I get you anything?’ I caught myself treating her immediately like one of my old sources—old habits do die hard I guess. She let me order us a pot of tea to share. After an awkward—and ultimately failed—attempt at pleasantries from both sides, Carly gave me the hard once-over then said, ‘you really are having the nightmares aren’t you?’

‘I am,’ I confirmed. ‘And I’m not the only one by the looks of it.’

She closed her eyes and nodded. ‘They began six months ago. I’m surprised they took so long to be honest.’

‘You’d better share this information,’ I said. ‘Then maybe we can work this thing out.’

She leant in like she didn’t want anyone to hear. ‘So I can trust you? Fine. Let’s start at the beginning. First of all, the Coalhouse is a real place. It was built sometime in the eighteen-twenties. One half of the building ran as a workhouse for a coal repository—there are tunnels from the coal mine eight miles away running directly to giant coal cellars deep under the Coalhouse. A constant stream of pit ponies would haul coal up into these cellars. The valley running by the building is artificial, and was dug to accommodate a railway and train station with easy access to the cellars for loading. There are collapsed entrances into the cellar hidden along the valley. The other half of the Coalhouse was a kind of fancy hotel, where the mine’s administrators came on business and rich train passengers might stop off. You see, in the early days of steam travel, you would book passage in a carriage attached to a freight train, and it wasn’t rare to have to wait a couple of days for a connection. The Coalhouse made a kind of midway hub back when few lines were running.’

‘Interesting. So that’s its history. Why are we all dreaming about it?’

She pulled back and folded her arms. ‘Ah well, there’s more. Before the Coalhouse there was a lonely inn, a sort of halfway-point for people crossing the moors, which stood in that spot in one form or another for around four hundred years, and before that there was a fortified outpost dating back to Anglo-Saxon times.’ She quickly leant back in. ‘There’s always been something there. I found some early references to a pre-Christian religious site that matches pretty neatly with the location. Can I ask you, in the dreams, have you ever come across anything that suggests some kind of cult or religion?’

I shook my head, thought about it. Then it came to me. ‘Something about a Bull God.’

Carly raised a finger triumphantly. ‘Aha, the Bull God. Yes! So the thing to ask when dealing with polytheistic gods is “what sort of god is this god?”’

I shrugged. ‘Any ideas?’ I asked.

‘I already know what sort of god he is. I admit, some of my working out is joining dots, but there are enough facts—which I’ll share with you later—to point to a definite answer: the Bull God is the ruler of an ancient underworld. A land of the dead.’

I took a swig of my tea and chewed on this. ‘But, you know, Hades, Satan, Anubis, Pluto, Hel—I’ve heard of these. Why have I never heard of a Bull God as the king of the underworld?’

‘Not “*the* king of *the* underworld” but “*a* king of *an* underworld.” We’re talking about such early times when kings were local, and so naturally were gods. The Bull God featured in an archaic local religion that died out before written records began, and he reigned over an underworld the size of an ancient kingdom, that is to say, probably a stretch of land we could walk across in two or three days.’

‘So you’re suggesting an ancient god is using my dead wife to haunt my dreams?’

She tutted. ‘I’m not sure.’

‘It’s just that, apart from the words, I haven’t come across this Bull God at all.’

‘Me neither.’

We sat and thought in silence together for a while.

‘Angwynne,’ I said at last.

‘What?’

‘“A-N-G-W-Y-N-N-E. Angwynne, left hand of the Bull God,” that’s what I saw carved. Who’s Angwynne?’

'Angwynne’s new to me. Left hand you say? Well, a god is like a king, he needs to recruit advisors and subordinates. I imagine his Left Hand would be one of his dead subjects raised in status… and thinking about it, I tell you who I have been seeing in my nightmares…’

‘Who?’

‘Gingery woman. Ring any bells?’

‘That does.’ I sucked my teeth.

‘So, if we assume our ginger woman is Angwynne, the Left Hand of the Bull God, and we’ve both seen her—I imagine she features as prominently in your dreams as she does in mine—then my guess would be she’s the one behind all this.’

The pieces fit, I agreed. ‘But why? How are we connected?’

‘Well, I can’t say why Angwynne is targeting us, or for what purpose, or even how, but I’m connected through Beth, my girlfriend,’ said Carly. ‘How Beth began to have the dreams I don’t know. From researching other cases, I believe the Coalhouse—Angwynne I suppose—draws you in by isolating you, picking on your social flaws and separating you from the world using them. The user on the forum who had the lonely hotel stay? She’s troubled by severe social isolation problems. As for me? All I know is that the last time I saw Beth she was heading for the Coalhouse. I guess my obsession for the place finally gave Angwynne a way in. And if you’re grieving and depressed, which it seems you are, it’ll use that.’

‘You know the location then?’

She squinted. ‘You mustn’t go there.’

‘Carly,’ I said. ‘Let’s be honest. You met with me because you intend to go yourself, but you daren’t go alone.’

She couldn’t look me in the face. ‘Well…’ Then she did look up, abruptly resolute. ‘Maybe. The dreams have taken over; there’s nothing else left.’ She pulled out her phone and brought up a map. ‘If you want to know, it’s here.’ She pointed to a spot.

I took in the location, then started and sloshed my tea.

‘What is it?’ Carly asked.

‘That’s about fifteen miles from the village retreat where Malena died.’

‘Then she died within the borders of the Bull God’s kingdom. There’s your connection to all this anyway.’

I could hardly believe we were seriously discussing gods and the malignant undead, and any normal person eavesdropping would have been within their rights to count us doolally. But after the anguish we’d both been through and those inexplicable concrete dreams shared by multiple people, just the ones that we knew of, nothing now seemed too far-fetched. So we sat there and drew our plans to visit the Coalhouse.

&#x200B;

Tomorrow we set off. I’m writing this document as a matter of record, in case something should happen. We both sense that the Coalhouse most likely spells our downfall, but the pull of the place is too heavy. We need to find our loved ones, find out what became of them, alive or dead. If we make it back I will post an update. However, I will warn you either way, do not go looking for the Coalhouse, don’t research it, don’t get too curious, and whatever you do, don’t ever go there. Not even in your dreams.
