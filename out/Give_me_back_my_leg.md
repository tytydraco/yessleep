I was returning from fishing. I had spent almost the whole day under typical Ukrainian early spring weather, when nature cannot decide whether to rain or to snow. But despite such a prolonged fishing trip, all I carried in my backpack were three lonely crucian carps. I had caught four, but one was so small that I released it back into the river.

Petro's house stood alone on the edge of the village, cut off from other streets by wide gardens and plantings. It was so far from people that it was hard to believe that it really belonged to the village and didn't exist in the middle of the forest. I approached the yard and carefully, slowly opened the gate, expecting Alma, Petro's old shepherd dog, to jump out. But to my surprise, complete silence reigned in the yard. "Is she dead already?" I thought to myself and closed the gate behind me.

I took a few steps across the yard and stopped. A torn dog chain lay near the doghouse. There was no sound - no livestock, no chickens, not even any insects. The only sound that reached my ears was the quiet howling of the night wind.

- Hey, neighbors! Guests have arrived!

Silence.

I knocked on the door and listened. It seemed that someone was standing behind the door. Breathing.

- Petro, is that you?

The breathing stopped. A familiar voice came from inside.

- Who's there?!

- It's me, Sashko! Who else?

- Sashko... - Petro repeated in a calm voice. - Yeah, like I'm so easy to fool. Listen, "Sashko"! Swear!

- What? - I was confused.

- I said swear! Curse as bad as you can!

- Are you fucking crazy? Have you already drunk away your last brain cells, you stupid fuck?! Who the hell do you think you are? Why would anyone come here, in the middle of fucking nowhere and pretend to be your friend?!

I was ready to spit, turn around and go, when suddenly the door creaked and Petro whispered:

- Come in. Quick, quick!

I took a step forward, but the impatient Petro grabbed me by the jacket and forcibly pulled me inside. The whole house reeked of alcohol. Petro quickly locked the front door.

- Are you fucking mental? - I spoke angrily. - How long have you been on a bender? And where's your wife?

- Wife?.. - said Petro. - She left. Took the children and moved to her mother's.

- Ah... - suddenly the reason why Petro was drinking became somewhat clearer. - And I went fishing. I thought, why not visit an old friend? But honestly, I probably had the worst catch of my life.

- Need a place to sleep? - Petro asked. Even while drunk, he still quickly understood everything without any hints.

- Well I... - I mumbled, - The next train won't be until morning, and I'd have to walk home for probably two hours... And it's already night outside...

- Sure, sure, relax, - Petro interrupted me and went deeper into the house. I wanted to follow him, when suddenly I felt sharp pain - I kicked something in the darkness. - Fuck! Where's the light?!

Only now did I notice that not a single light bulb was on in the house.

- Now, now, - Petro muttered. - Let me light some candles.

- What happened? Did the wind break the wires? Though I don't remember any strong winds...

Petro ignored this and simply came out into the corridor with a candle. In its dim red light, I finally saw the face of the house owner. And I didn't much like what I saw. Petro resembled a homeless man who hadn't slept properly for a whole month. And the house itself wasn't much better - windows covered with blankets and towels, things scattered on the floor, overturned chairs - it seemed his wife had left him long ago.

I took off my shoes, removed my jacket, and meanwhile Petro went to the kitchen and came out with two bottles of vodka and a jar of pickled cucumbers.

- What are you doing - I said. - We won't drink that much.

- Don't worry, - Petro muttered in a tone as if he were talking to himself. - The first one is hard, the rest will go easy. I'm so tired of drinking alone.

Does he have delirium? - I thought to myself. But I decided not to pressure Petro, and simply left my backpack in the corridor and went into the living room. As I walked in, I automatically flicked the light switch. The room was instantly flooded with bright white light.

- Turn it off! Turn it off quick! - Petro panicked. His eyes went wild, and his skin turned white like a ghost's.

I got scared and quickly flicked the switch again. Whatever. It's his house.

- Just walked in and acts like he owns the place... - Petro continued to mutter. - Flicking the lights...

Poor guy. He really needs help. Maybe he just needs to talk to someone? With these thoughts, I sat at the table and took a cucumber from the jar with my fingers.

- Well, Sashko, - Petro's voice sounded surprisingly strong and loud. - Let's drink for courage.

Why for courage - I didn't understand. The vodka was strong and I immediately reached for another cucumber. Petro, not wasting any time, began pouring second shots. I raised my hand in protest, but he didn't stop.

- It's all good, all good. Wait, I'll bring some meat now.

But as soon as he stood up from his chair, he immediately sat back down.

- He's coming. - Petro said with despair in his voice. - Right. He's coming. He saw it. You shouldn't have flicked those lights!

- Who's coming?

Petro was silent. He listened to the street.

- On the porch... - he whispered quietly.

- Want me to take a look?

Petro shuddered. A drop of sweat ran down his forehead.

- Sit still!

We heard footsteps on the porch behind the front door. Someone touched the door handle, tried to open it, and then stepped back. You could hear him walk along the house to the window under which we were sitting - a window covered with a thick blanket.

- GIVE ME BACK MY LEG! - a deep voice echoed through the room.

I shuddered from surprise and almost knocked the candle to the floor.

- Who is this? - I whispered.

Petro was silent. His eyes were fixed on the table. His lips moved but made no sound.

- GIVE ME BACK MY LEG! - the voice sounded again. This time it seemed to come from everywhere at once.

I got up and began looking for some weapon.

- Sit still, I said! - Petro ordered and began pouring more shots. - He won't do anything. He has no right, understand? He's just trying to scare us.

I understood nothing, but sat back in my chair anyway. The blanket on the window stirred.

- He's going to drop it... - Petro warned.

The blanket began to tremble like a wave, but it didn't fall. One of the nails continued to hold it. But now it no longer completely covered the window, and dim moonlight flooded the room. There was nothing outside the window, only darkness and the empty yard of Petro's house. Suddenly a triangular head on a thin neck appeared in it. I almost fell off my chair. The creature's eyes were round like soap bubbles, and with its three-fingered hand it touched the glass like a frog.

- What is that?! - I almost screamed.

- What do you think... - Petro said irritably. - An alien.

- What?!

- An alien - Petro repeated with anger. - Don't play dumb.

- GIVE ME BACK MY LEG! - this time the voice sounded as if from the ceiling.

Petro shook his head.

- Bastard, he's pretending to be a dead man. - he complained. - He knows I've been afraid of them since childhood.

Petro shook his whole body as if he had just woken up, and then turned to me and said in a normal voice.

- Just sit calmly. Relax. Relax, I said. At first I was the same, sitting tense, wouldn't let go of the rifle. - He nodded toward an old hunting rifle by the wall.

It became quiet and dark outside again. The alien disappeared. I took a shot of vodka from the table and carefully looked out the window.

- Just don't be afraid. - Petro instructed. - He won't come inside anyway, he doesn't have permission... I figured that out on the third day.

- GIVE IT BACK! - The voice shouted again. This time it was quieter and resembled an ordinary person.

- I don't have your fucking leg! - Petro cried out. - Leave me in peace. - he turned to me. - Stubborn as a ram. Give it back, give it back...

- Did he lose his leg?

- The leg from his flying saucer. Someone unscrewed it, and he thinks it was me. Just because you parked in my garden doesn't mean I'm now responsible for your junk!

- GIVE ME BACK MY LEG! - the glass trembled.

- He speaks Ukrainian, - I noticed.

- He's been mastering pronunciation for two weeks. - said Petro. - But he still can't swear. Too complex a concept for him. Let's have another one, for courage.

- YOU BETTER GIVE IT BACK! - the voice threatened.

Petro was visibly nervous.

- Now he'll start spinning, - Petro warned vaguely. - Just... Don't move. Sit still. It's just a vision. - Even though Petro said this, he still clamped the vodka bottles between his knees.

The house shook and tilted to one side. I panicked and fell to the floor.

The house stood like that for a whole minute, but despite this, the table and chairs didn't budge from their places.

- Now he'll turn it upside down - Petro nervously predicted. And just as he said, with one sharp movement the floor under our feet turned to ceiling. And again, no furniture in the room moved from its place, and despite the fact that it was now hanging in the air, none of it fell down.

- GIVE ME BACK MY LEG! - the voice sounded as if right in my ear.

- Just don't move! - Petro shouted. - He's not spinning the house, he's spinning something in our heads. Close your eyes. Or you'll get hurt!

- How long will this last?! - I felt my lunch treacherously rising up my esophagus.

- Oh, this is just the beginning! He hasn't even started shaking yet!

The alien put the house back in place, and then spun it around its axis again. Then again. And again. Somewhere during the third rotation, I lost consciousness.

When I woke up, everything was already over - only my fingers instinctively held onto the table leg. Petro sat at the table with long-suffering tears in his eyes.

- And you know what's the worst part? The bastard won't believe me! - Petro complained. - I tell him again and again, but he won't believe!

He sniffled and put the vodka on the table. I looked out the window and again saw the triangular-headed alien there. It seemed to me that he noticed some hope in his bubble-like eyes.

- Are you sure you didn't take it? I mean, the leg...

Petro sighed heavily.

- Why would I take it?

- Then explain it to him.

- Try it yourself - said Petro.

I looked out the window. The alien was no longer there. But his quiet steps could be heard behind the front door. I got up and approached it.

- Listen, guy... You're mistaken. Petro didn't take your leg. It's not here...

- GIVE ME BACK MY LEG! - the voice behind the door replied.

- See? - said Petro. - He's not even listening to you!

- Maybe call the police?

- Police? - Petro got angry. - And where will I hide my fishing explosives? And the venison I hunted without a license? They'll only bring me more problems.

Defeated, I sat back at the table.

- Even Alma ran away, - Petro said with sadness in his voice. - She tore her chain and ran away. Everyone abandoned me. I was left alone...

- Calm down, - I tried to cheer him up. - Don't despair. We'll think of something. It's an intelligent creature after all, we can somehow come to an agreement...

- YOU BETTER GIVE IT BACK! - the intelligent creature shouted from behind the window.

- Drink quickly, - said Petro. - God knows what else he might pull off.

And we drank. And waited. The house didn't move. Silence also reigned in the yard.

- Maybe he left? - I said hopefully.

Petro slowly shook his head.

And then we heard it. Water. A river. A river? In this locality? In the middle of the night? In the middle of snow? The rumbling of water was getting louder. There could be no mistake. A wild current was running straight in our direction. We saw it in the window. It broke the fence and flooded the yard. The water level was rising. Quickly. In a minute, half the window was already under water.

- The glass will crack! - I panicked.

- The hell it will! - Petro replied irritably. - There's no water there. All his damn tricks. He's already buried me underground, thrown me into space...

My backpack floated past the window, and behind it swam three lonely crucian carps.

- Hey! That's my catch! How did he?..

- That's why I hung up the windows. - Petro said in a tired voice. Then he approached the window and tried to pull the blanket back, when suddenly from the other side of the glass the pale face of a dead person with a wide open mouth looked at him.

I never figured out who screamed - Petro or the dead man. Petro took a step back, fell to the floor and lost consciousness. And right at that moment everything stopped. There was no dead man, no water. No backpack, no fish. Only night and the lonely moon in the sky.

---

Petro sat at the table and stared blankly at the burning candle. I didn't know what to do, so I poured him another shot of vodka.

- Do you know who could have stolen his leg? - I asked.

For several seconds Petro was silent.

- Anyone could have! - He finally shouted. - Some gypsies are constantly prowling around here. Once they stole my shovel right from the yard - and even the dog didn't wake up!

- Bastards. - I agreed. - And the worst part is that the thief with the leg is probably sleeping now. And we're suffering here because of him...

I carefully looked out the window. The triangular-headed alien was looking straight at me. Probably thinking about his next step.

- What's he doing there? - Petro asked.

- Just standing in the yard. No, wait... He's laying firewood under the shed. Hey! Does he want to burn it?

- You're lying! - Petro shouted in fright and instantly rushed to the window.

The alien was carefully stacking firewood with his thin hands under the walls of the old shed. And then he looked straight at Petro.

- WILL YOU GIVE IT BACK?

- He'll burn it! - Petro panicked. - He'll definitely burn it!

He ran to the corner of the room and grabbed the rifle. Then he ran straight to the door. I barely managed to stop him.

- You said he wasn't doing anything! It's just a vision!

- And what if it's not?! - Petro shouted. - I know where he got this firewood, the firewood is definitely real!

We heard the crackling of fire. Very quickly the flame became so bright that we no longer needed the candle.

- There's explosives in there! - Petro almost dropped the rifle on his feet. - Did he really?!...

He approached the window and put his hand on the glass.

- Though... Did it start a bit too quickly?.. And he didn't even pour kerosene on it...

His thoughts were interrupted by a loud explosion. The roof of the shed flew off.

- Explosives! - Petro muttered. - Maybe I really should give it back...

I was confused, digesting what I had just heard.

- What did you say? Maybe I really should... Did you really steal it?!

Petro was silent, clearly thinking about his next words. And then he spat and angrily shouted:

- It's his own damn fault! He shouldn't have parked in my garden! I'm walking home, I see his junk, doors open, nobody around. Well, I thought, the hell with it! I'm a trained auto mechanic, can't I figure out how to work his saucer? So I took tools from the shed, propped it up with a piece of wood and...

- GIVE ME BACK MY LEG! - the alien insisted.

- He will! - I shouted.

- Why the hell are you giving away my stuff? - said Petro.

- Because it's his stuff! - Now it was my turn to be angry. - You either give it back, or you'll live in a mental institution! He'll never leave you alone!

- So let him!

- Damn it... Just give it back already! - I insisted.

- No... I've already suffered so much for it that I've earned it.

I didn't even know what to answer to that.

- And what about me? What am I suffering for?

- I'm not responsible for you! You came here uninvited!

- Show me! - I demanded.

- Show what? - Petro was confused.

- The leg! Show me the leg!

Petro fell silent. He carefully looked out the window, and then quietly went to the bedroom. In a few seconds he returned with some kind of metal pipe, about a meter long.

- Here. Look, but don't touch! - Petro presented.

- This is it? And this is what he's scrambling your brains for? Why do you even need it?!

- You don't understand! - Petro replied offendedly. - It extends! Look!

He twisted one end of the pipe, pulled the other and the leg doubled in length. He did it again, and it doubled one more time. And again. And again. It seems he stopped extending it only because the room dimensions no longer allowed it.

- It extends up to 12 meters! - Petro explained proudly. - And not only that, look how light it is! And it doesn't bend! Look, I'm holding it by the end with one hand!

- So what? - I shouted. - It extends? Who cares?! Is it worth your sanity? Another week of these tortures and they'll lock you in a room with soft walls!

Petro folded the leg back and hid it from the alien's sight.

- Listen, - I pleaded. - Just give him the leg... Wait! Listen! Give him this thing! And I'll make you another one just like that at the factory! From aluminium! What do you say?!

Petro looked at his stick like a child at candy.

- It will bend...

- It will! - I began to lose my composure. - But nobody will spin your house again, debile!

Petro didn't answer. He just sat on the floor, not taking his eyes off the stick.

- You'll die from alcohol poisoning faster than you'll have time to play with it!

Petro's lips began to tremble.

- You promise?

- Promise what?

- Promise to make... From aluminium... Just like that...

- I give you my word!

Petro started to get up, and then sat down again.

- Or I'll open the door right now! - I threatened. - Try explaining to him how you earned it!

Petro looked at me with anger. Then he got up, approached the door, opened it and threw the stick into the snow.

- Take it! And choke on it!

Petro closed the door and locked it. Then he slowly returned to the table and poured himself another shot of vodka. But I didn't see this. My eyes were fixed on the small triangular-headed alien, who slowly picked up his leg from the snow, carefully wiped it with his three-fingered hands and walked past the untouched shed toward the gate. But before he left the yard, he looked at me with his large bubble-like eyes one last time.

The gate closed. Petro sat at the table and looked longingly at the bottle of vodka.

- Don't forget... You promised... You gave me your word... From aluminium... Just like that... Extendable... Up to 12 meters...
