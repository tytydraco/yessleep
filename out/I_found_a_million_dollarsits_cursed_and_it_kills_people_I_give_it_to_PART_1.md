I swung the sledgehammer like I was turning on a fastball. It smashed into the bricks in the fireplace, the spot where you might hang a family photo. The bricks exploded, little bits blasting into my skin and ticking off my safety goggles.  
  
I swung again, and the sledge didn't go clear through to the inside of the flue that led up to the old, crumbling chimney. I'd hit something. Usually the only thing you find in a chimney is a dead animal. But it wasn’t a raccoon carcass, a mummified corpse doesn’t stop a sledge with a dull thud.  
Then, things started to fall to the bottom of the fireplace. Whatever it was had been wedged up there, held in place by the brick. When the dust settled, I could see cellophane. It looked like cinder blocks wrapped in plastic.  
  
I ducked down and pulled one of them out, and it didn't carry the weight of cement. I pushed the goggles up onto my forehead and squinted. The cellophane was wrapped around fuck knows how many times, so whatever was inside wasn't visible.  
I used my jackknife to cut into it, peeled back the layers, and saw President Jackson staring at me. I frantically pulled at the wrapping and came out with a wad of twenties. There was a two thousand dollar bank band around the stack, and I took its word for it.  
  
Fifty stacks in the package. Three more wrapped blocks on the bottom of the fireplace. I took them out and arranged them on the hearth. I reached my hand into the hole I’d bludgeoned and felt around.  
There.  
  
After a nudge, six more fell into the fireplace. I didn't bother counting it all, but I did the math. Two thousand bucks a stack. Fifty stacks per block. Ten blocks. One million dollars. Approximately nine- hundred ninety-nine thousand dollars more than I currently had to my name.  
Your humble servant Mitch Harris was dirty, rotten, filthy, stinking rich.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
I’d gotten out of high school seven years before this happened. College wasn’t in the cards for financial reasons. 1.8 GPAs don't get you a full ride at most institutions of higher learning, if you can believe it. I kicked around doing minimum-wage jobs that I couldn't hold down, mostly because I didn’t like being told what to do.  
  
My buddy Ryan Chambers went into the house-flipping business and offered me work cleaning out foreclosed properties he bought. The ungodly things I’ve seen…I’ll spare you most of the details in case you plan on eating at some point this week.  
  
I started doing it for a couple of other guys regularly, and this expanded into demo work to prepare a place for renovations. The work wasn't steady, given the real estate market here in Western Maine  
   
wasn't booming at the time. I could make a thousand bucks every couple weeks, and that was enough to keep beer in the fridge.  
This particular gig wasn’t that bad. The house way up on Poplar Ridge wasn't squalid and had only been empty for the past year or so. The only disturbing thing was the splatter of red on the bedroom wall and the buckshot peppered into the plaster.  
  
The home's former occupant, Richard Burgess, had met a rather untimely demise. I could only remember three or four other murders in Buckton in my lifetime. This one remained unsolved, but the local police assured everyone that there was no danger to the public. That's always “we know who did it, we don't have enough evidence to charge him, and Richard Burgress had it coming. “  
  
So in the grand scheme of how surprising it is to find a million dollars, I'd rate this one on the low end of shock. It made sense. Richard was involved in unseemly shit, someone was pissed at him, money was involved, and poor old Richie got turned into Swiss cheese by a twelve gauge in his master bedroom.  
Richard wasn't the best and brightest, so I was confident that the money was ill-gotten. That doesn't mean I should keep it, but that knowledge would make me sleep better at night if that's the way I decided to go.  
  
It was a victimless crime. Not even a crime at all. A victimless find. So I cruised back into town and went to Walmart. I bought two big duffel bags that could hold fifty pounds in them. A million bucks weighs a hundred and ten pounds, all told, I later learned.  
  
So I stuffed the wrapped bricks into the two bags and tossed them in the trunk of my Kia. I dumped the unwrapped brick into my backpack and placed it on the passenger seat. As I drove, I unzipped it and occasionally stuck my hand into the bag to convince myself that it was real.  
My apartment was on the third floor on a dead-end street. When I got home, I sat on the front porch and watched my car in the dirt parking lot below until it was dark. I didn't dare let it out of my sight.  
  
When the sun slipped behind the mountains, and the streetlights came on, I went down and popped the trunk. I dragged each bag up one at a time and stuck them in the back of my closet.  
  
I sat at the table, thinking of how I would spend the money. Flashing cash around town when everyone knows you don't have a pot to piss in was a surefire way to draw attention. Same for driving a nice new Chevy pickup.  
  
The one thing I was comfortable doing with the money in the short term was heading down to Boston and getting hammered with my buddy Jeff.  
  
I wasn't going to tell him about the money, but it would be nice to go out without worrying if I was going to overdraw my account. So I called and told him I was coming down, and we would tie one on. It wasn't a tough sell.  
   
The next morning I rolled down the Turnpike with a Mountain Dew, a pack of butts, and classic rock on the radio. Jeff lived in Saugus, which was a two-and-a-half-hour drive. US Route 1 cut a swath through the city, lined with strip malls, fast food, and a giant cactus for the Hilltop Steakhouse.  
  
It was an impoverished man's Vegas. But it might as well have been heaven for a twenty-five-year-old with cash to spend.  
  
Jeff worked for the T - that's the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority - as a maintenance man on the Green Line. That may not sound like much, but it was a union gig with a full pension after you do your twenty. So compared to most of us who didn't leave home after high school, he was living high off the hog.  
  
We smoked up at his apartment and then decided to go to dinner. My treat, I said. He suggested the Kowloon - the cavernous Chinese restaurant, but I told him I was buying, and we were going out for a nice steak. He looked surprised, and I told him I had just finished a big job. The Hilltop it was.  
  
We got a booth in the Dodge City room, and each got a filet. It tasted like the best steak I ever had. As I chewed, I looked down at the placemat that featured a cow drawing with all the cuts of meat labeled on it. It didn't seem weird to me then but now strikes me as a bit perverse. Spiking the football a little too hard.  
  
When we finished, I plopped my debit card down on the table and, for once, didn't feel a bit of anxiety. Jeff suggested we continue the evening at one of the two local nightspots in Saugus that catered to gentlemen.  
  
That meant either the Cabaret or the Golden Banana. I've never been one for strip clubs, and I'm not just saying that now with the benefit of years and maturity on my side. They're depressing, and the Banana was more depressing than most. But Jeff was ready to party, and I wasn't going to rain on his parade.  
  
Say what you will about it; there's no better name for a peeler than the Golden Banana. We walked in to the thump of Warrant's Cherry Pie. Apparently, they had a weakness for the classics. There was no cover, only a three-drink minimum, and Jeff tossed a fifty on the bar to take care of both of us. The bartender thanked him and used his name. Of course, he was a regular.  
  
I did my best to sit as far away from the stage as possible. I didn't want to be cheap; I just felt weird watching Mrs. McCabe's daughter Mercedes gyrating her way through community college while I tossed legal tender at her.  
  
After a few minutes, Jeff got a private dance, and I was left there conspicuously alone. The feeling of cheapness soon overwhelmed my sense of discomfort. I got up and went to the bar, pulling a crisp twenty from my pocket. I hesitated for a moment. It was the first of the million I'd spent, and I wondered if the bills were somehow marked. Or if they were counterfeit.  
   
I considered going to the ATM with the four-dollar surcharge but decided against it. The bartender looked at me impatiently from beneath her curled bangs that were five years past being in style.  
  
Finally, I went to hand her the twenty, and she nodded toward a clear plastic cube with a slot on top. I stuffed the twenty in the hole, and She reached into a metal bank box and counted out twenty singles for me.  
  
While Jeff went two more songs with whatever luxury car brand or birthstone he was getting a private dance from, I sipped my Budweiser. I occasionally placed a couple of bucks on the corner of the stage, stealing glances at the Sox and Yankees game on the TV above the bar.  
  
When Jeff returned, grinning like the cat that dry-humped the canary, I told him I wanted to get going. Grab some beer and catch the end of the game at his place. Mussina had a perfect game going for the Yankees.  
  
He didn't argue and could see that I'd had enough. I placed the remaining ones on the stage for the performing dancer, and we headed out.  
  
As we walked across the parking lot to my car, a police cruiser blazed past us, lights flashing. A moment later, an ambulance screamed past and pulled around to a side door. I stood beside the Kia and watched the paramedics wheel a stretcher into the club. Jeff and I looked at each other and offered a shrug.  
  
We stopped at the packie on the way back to Jeff's, and I bought a thirty-rack of Bud. I only made it through about six beers before dozing off on the couch shortly after the Sox broke up the perfect game with two outs in the ninth.  
  
I wasn't really hung over the next morning and was itching to get back home. I was anxious that someone had broken into my place and taken the money. That was foolish, but until you've had that much money lying around, you probably wouldn't understand the anxiety that comes with it. Jeff was still asleep, so I left him a note and thanked him for having me down.  
  
I gassed up at Cumbies and headed north without stopping to eat or take a leak. At the New Hampshire and York toll plazas, I tossed the remaining coins in my ashtray into the little baskets at the toll booth.  
  
When I got to the New Gloucester toll plaza, I realized I was out of coins, and all I had was the folded-up twenties. I went through the cash only lane, and the guy in the booth made change for me from one of them, returning me $18.75.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
I was home an hour later, scrambled up the stairs, and fumbled with the deadbolt key as I came onto the third-floor landing. I pushed into the kitchen and smelled the stale coffee I'd left in the pot.  
   
When I opened the closet and pushed the three dress shirts and the suit I wore for funerals to the side, I exhaled. The two bags were there.  
  
Still, I was unsettled. Whoever had killed Richard Burgess was probably looking for that money. They could come looking for me if they found out that I had done the demo work.  
  
I picked at a leftover Italian sandwich from Four Corners for lunch, absently keeping my ear to the noontime news on Channel 6, largely tuning out stories about the search for Chandra Levy, an increase in shark attacks over the summer that was fading fast, and an accident on the Turnpike that morning.  
  
Rather than finishing my sandwich, I took one of the wrapped blocks from the closet. One hundred thousand bucks. 10% of my total. If the people who killed Richie returned to look for the money and poked around the fireplace's remains, they'd come away with that.  
  
It wasn't a million bucks, but it was enough to convince them that whatever money there was at one time was gone. Maybe Richie had spent it. Perhaps he'd hidden it somewhere else. But the bottom line is that the guy who gutted the place hadn't taken off with it because who would leave a hundred thousand bucks behind?  
  
\*\*\*  
  
I still had the key to the place. I'd return it to Ryan when we settled up for the job when he got back from a trip out of state. So I drove up to Poplar Ridge with the single cellophane brick in my backpack.  
  
I stepped into the house and got on my knees on what remained of the hearth. The bricks from the fireplace were all gone, so access to the flue was easy.  
  
I paused and considered as I was about to stick the money up there. I didn't need to put it all back, did I? Maybe just half.  
  
So I reached into my pocket for my knife and opened the plastic. I pulled out twenty-five stacks and put them in the backpack. I wrapped the plastic back up and shoved it up inside the chimney.  
  
Instead of heading home, I parked outside the Silvertone, where I could see my car from the barstool through the plate glass window.  
  
Laura Childs was tending bar. She had been a couple of years ahead of me in school and had a Coors Banquet poured before my ass hit the stool. I thanked her and sipped it, staring blankly at the opening weekend of college football playing silently on the two TVs over the bar.  
Only a couple of other guys were in the place, and they were shooting pool. Laura caught me stealing nervous glances out the window at my car. She told me not to worry - my ride wouldn't get towed. I tried to laugh it off, but she could see something was wrong with me. I polished off four beers in less than an hour and felt pretty buzzed.  
   
When I was finished, I thanked Laura then reached into my pocket. I had peeled off two twenties from my backpack before coming inside.  
The beers came to twelve bucks. The bills felt crisp and perfect as I pulled them out and tossed them on the bar. Laura looked at me curiously, and I told her to keep it. She shrugged and thanked me. I headed for the door just as she picked up the money and turned for the cash register.  
  
I heard the drawer slide open, and then there was a crash. Stacked glasses behind the bar shattered as they hit the floor. I whipped around to see Laura on the ground, her legs twitching, her eyes rolling back in her head. She was gasping the last breaths she'd ever take.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
I waited for the paramedics to arrive after one of the pool guys called 9-1-1, but it was too late. When the ambulance pulled up, and the two EMTs ran in, they took one look at Laura and knew it was over. One of them said something about a “massive cerebral hemorrhage” to a couple of the cops and firefighters that showed up as they zipped her into a body bag.  
I wasn't exactly sure what happened next. I stood on the sidewalk, watched as Laura's body was loaded into the back of the meat wagon, and headed for…the hospital? I guess that's right. They didn't need to  
run the lights and siren, that’s for sure. She was taking her last ride, now a dead single mother who left a two-year-old behind.  
When I got in the car, I took the backpack from the floor of the passenger side, where I'd stashed it before going into the bar. I unzipped it just to make sure the money was still there. It was.  
  
I drove home in a daze. I had never seen anyone die before, not even one of my grandparents. Not my father. No one I was close to had ever gone to be with their Lord and Savior while surrounded by their loving family, as the obits always note.  
Maybe the beer or Laura's death caused me to run one of the two stoplights in town. This time the sirens were used as Sgt Jim Daley hit the blues. He was a prick's prick, still ass sore at the world because he was cut from the JV football team in high school.  
  
He walked over to the Kia, and I could see the spit-shined boots approaching in my side view mirror. I secretly popped a piece of gum in my mouth just as Daley rapped a knuckle on the window. That's when I realized the backpack was wide open, and the money was visible.  
  
I thought of zipping it up but didn't want to draw attention to it, so I tried to play it cool. I rolled down the window and told Daley I needed to pay better attention. He sniffed and said yeah, that would be a good idea.  
He asked me where I was coming from, and I told him the Silvertone. He said he heard on the radio about Laura and I said that she was dead. He grunted, and I couldn't tell if it was out of a sense of pity. Probably not.  
   
He asked how much I had to drink, and I gave him the stock answer he was probably expecting – just a couple of beers. Daley grunted, and with that noise, there was no ambiguity. He didn't believe me, could smell the bullshit as easily as my peppermint gum poorly masking my booze breath.  
  
I thought about all the shithouse, barstool lawyers I'd known on shitty job sites. Never blow. You never fucking blow. I knew if I did refuse, my license would automatically be revoked, and I needed to drive. It wouldn't be an OUI, but it would effectively be the same.  
I tried to decide if I should roll the dice with the breathalyzer. Twenty-two years ago, you couldn't pull up a BAC calculator on your iPhone.  
  
It was going to be close. I weighed a buck seventy soaking wet. Four 5% beers in forty-five minutes. That had been over an hour ago, though. 08? .07? .1? Whatever it was, Jim Daley wasn’t exactly a smack you on the ass and tell you to head right home type of fella.  
I looked up at him and saw myself in the reflection of his dickhead issue aviator sunglasses. He asked for my license and registration. I leaned over to the glovebox to grab the latter. As I did that, I used my left hand to try and covertly close the backpack.  
  
I made a big production of trying to find the registration. When I heard Jim sigh, I pulled it out and handed it to him. Instead of looking at it, he nodded toward the bag.  
I told him I had just finished a big job up on Poplar Ridge. He said that was an awful lot of cash, and I agreed. He asked if it was the Burgess place. I thought of lying but realized he'd know if I was, so I told the truth.  
  
He asked me to step out of the vehicle. I walked the line like a fucking ballerina. I followed his finger like a red-tail hawk on Adderall. I said the alphabet forward like a genius three-year-old. But for fuck's sake, if I didn't stumble on reciting the alphabet backward. That's some rigged shit right there. Try it right now. Fast. Not so easy, is it?  
  
So when I tripped over K-J-I-H and said K-J-H-I instead, Daley smiled and told me to get back in my vehicle. I figured he was going back to his cruiser to get the breathalyzer., I watched him in my rearview, and he just ducked his head inside the vehicle's window. He came back empty-handed.  
I don't know for sure, but I guess he was turning off his dashboard cam. There were no body cameras in those days, just the shit you saw on COPS. Bad boys, bad boys, whatcha gonna do?  
When he got back, he leaned casually with his forearms on the rolled-down window of my car, now smiling at me like we were old friends.  
He let the sunglasses slide down his nose so I could see that his eyes were fixated on the bag of cash. I could tell he wouldn't bring it up first; he was waiting for me to make the opening move. I asked how much, and he said how much for what. I said how much to let me go home and forget this happened.  
   
He said all of it. That would mean fifty-thousand bucks. Fifty-thousand to get off of an OUI. I might as well take the penalty. Hell, I even had enough cash to hire a fancy lawyer. Maybe even Seth Carey.  
I knew his actual price had to be lower, so I said five thousand. He countered with ten, and I said fuck it. I was feeling magnanimous. It's not often someone from a shit-bum family like mine has the leverage over a big swinging dick like Tim Daley. I told him I'd throw in an extra two grand just because he was such a swell guy.  
  
I reached into the backpack and fished out six bands. I started to hand Daley the cash. Cars passed, slowing to gawk to see who had been a naughty boy. Daley put up a hand, telling me to stop.  
  
We couldn't do this here in broad daylight. He asked if I knew where he lived, and I said over on Somerset, right? He said to stop by after dark, maybe around 8:00.  
  
I exhaled as he drove off in his cruiser, figuring that my problems were over.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
When I got home, I popped a frozen pizza in the oven. I didn't turn on the TV or the radio while waiting. I just thought about what I was going to do with the money.  
Maybe I'd go to Florida. Drop a couple hundred grand on a nice two-bedroom on the Gulf somewhere and spend my days drinking beer and fishing. It would beat the fuck out of the Maine winters.  
When it was a quarter to eight, I took the money for Daley and placed it in a plastic shopping bag. I hopped in the car and cruised over to his ranch on Somerset. The motion light in the driveway flipped on, and I saw him sitting in a lawn chair in the garage. The Italian Lanai, as my grandmother called it.  
  
He got up and waved me in, flicking on the light over a workbench. I handed him the bag and he pulled out a stack and took a pen from the bench. He drew a line on a twenty with it and held it up to the light, ensuring it wasn't counterfeit.  
  
He said it looked good. I nodded and turned to leave, and he told me he wanted another five grand next month. I stared at him and considered the situation, calculating if I still had the advantage. Who had more to lose? I had nine hundred fifty thousand or so dollars, give or take. But him? He had a career. A reputation. Freedom. All that could be taken from him, and I never had any money to begin with. So I told him to fuck off.  
  
I realized this was a mistake when he reached into the drawer of his bench and took out his service weapon. He raised it. I took a step back into the shadows. He pointed it at his head…  
And pulled the trigger.  
  
The sound amplified in the enclosed space. He fell to the ground, the gun clattering on the cement floor.  
   
Blood trickled toward a drain. I felt my hands move up to my mouth and I tried to scream but no sound came from me. I thought of running to help him, but when you can see brains, the fat lady is pretty much singing.  
  
I managed to unfreeze myself and get started for the car so I could get the fuck out of there. But then, I bolted back for the plastic bag. I grabbed it off the bench and got back in the Kia.  
As I peeled out of the driveway, I saw neighbors’ porch lights going on and heard dogs barking. I made it home in one piece. I clicked on my father’s old police scanner and listened to the situation unfold.  
I didn't do anything, but no one else knew that. I didn't need to be spotted at the scene of a cop's death. I mean, it was a suicide, right?  
  
I waited. Waited until I heard the words – killed himself. Then I clicked the scanner off and went to bed.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
My eyes snapped open just as I was about to doze off. I know it seems obvious to you now. I'm sure it clicked for you when Daley pulled the trigger and blew his brains out all over the garage, but not for me.  
  
Maybe the trauma of what I'd witnessed that day had clouded my thinking, caused me to not see everything clearly.  
Like I said before, I had never seen anyone shuffle off their mortal coil in my presence before Laura in  
the bar that afternoon. And now? I’d seen two in the space of five hours. Coincidence? Bloody unlikely, given the circumstances.  
  
The last thing that either of them ever did was accept a little bit of the money I’d pulled from the chimney at Richard Burgess’ house. At first, I thought that maybe the money was laced with something. Or that it had been exposed to something in that chimney – lead or mercury.  
Maybe. But both deaths happened quickly, in almost an instant. Would lead or mercury act that quickly? And why the hell didn't it impact me? Maybe I had some kind of natural immunity to what it was, built up over my years of low-level exposure to Christ knows what in these abandoned houses.  
  
Perhaps Laura’s death was just the finger of fate reaching out and whispering now. And maybe, just maybe, Daley had been on the take for years, and this was the one that finally did it, pushing him over the edge. The guilt had become unbearable.  
  
These were not rational thoughts. But the conclusion I kept coming back to was even less logical. Despite that, it still seemed more likely.  
There was something about the money. Something…cursed. That's when it hit me. I hadn't only given the money to Laura and Daley. There was more. My trip to Massachusetts. I rocketed straight up in bed.  
   
I frantically searched my memory bank, trying to remember all the transactions I had made. I'd gassed up on the way out of town but had used my debit card at the pump and four quarters for my Mt Dew inside. What else? There was a dollar for a cheeseburger at the McDonald's in Auburn; I'd pulled that from the ashtray.  
  
The same went for the Maine and New Hampshire tolls on the way down. Then there was dinner at Hilltop, also on my card. Then…The Banana. I remembered the ambulance, and it felt like I'd taken a sledgehammer to the gut.  
  
I reached for the wireless landline on the floor next to my bed. I frantically dialed 617-555-1212. I knew 617 was a Boston area telephone code. When directory assistance picked up, I asked for the Golden Banana in Saugus, and the operator told me it was in Peabody. She offered to connect me for fifty cents, and I said that was fine.  
  
On the third ring, someone answered. In the distance, I could hear the thump of the music. I told the guy that I had been in last night, and when I was leaving, an ambulance pulled up, and I just wanted to make sure the person was ok.  
  
There was silence on the other end of the line. He said that was privileged information. I don't know if peelers fall under HIPPA, but it made sense. I pushed him, and he hung up.  
  
I sat there with the receiver in my hand, thinking, then called directory assistance again. I connected to the Peabody Police Department, and when the dispatcher picked up, I said I was a reporter from a paper in Maine and was looking for information on an emergency call the evening before.  
  
He asked what time, and I said around 9:30, to the Golden Banana. He hesitated and asked what paper I was with again. I told him I hadn't said, but it was the Lewiston Sun. He took a breath, and I could tell he was looking through paperwork.  
  
He told me the call was for a female thirties, possible overdose. Dead on arrival.  
The hairs on my arm stood up. I asked what she died of, and he said he didn't know; that was up to the coroner to determine. I asked for a name, and he told me it was Sara Miles. I thanked him and hung up.  
  
I wasn't sure what my next move was, but things were starting to become clear to me. I obviously didn't know if the bartender who made change for me was named Sara Miles, but I had a pretty good idea it was.  
  
But she hadn't dropped dead immediately like Laura and Daley. Then I remembered, through the fog of the beers I had at the Hilltop and the Banana – I'd placed the twenty inside the plastic cube.  
   
The ambulance had pulled up to a side door, so the most likely explanation was that she'd gone to the back to empty out the cube and put it in a safe or a lockbox. And then…what? I guess it didn't matter because she was dead.  
  
So that three. Three people dead because –  
  
I whipped my head to the glow of the alarm clock on my nightstand. 10:57. My mind raced back to that afternoon when I was eating lunch and keeping half an ear to the noontime news. An accident on the Maine Turnpike.  
  
I got out of bed and raced to the living room. I flicked on the TV, and it was still on Channel 6. At 11:00, the late newscast began. The top story was about a murder in Camden. I was pretty sure that didn't have anything to do with me. I hoped, anyway.  
  
The next story was the one I had heard at noon. That morning, an eighteen-wheeler had plowed into a tollbooth at the New Gloucester plaza, killing the toll worker inside.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
I lugged the second of the two duffel bags out onto my private back porch and set it down next to the other one.  
It was dark back there; the rear of the apartment building butted up against the woods. I could hear peepers chirping their late summer night songs. A cigarette-induced cough hacked out from someone in the darkness.  
  
I took the cover off of my charcoal grill and cut into the cellophane of one of the bundles with a knife. Once I unwrapped the stacks, I placed them on the grill surface. Then, I grabbed the bottle of lighter fluid.  
I held it over the money and hesitated. I half expected that when the fluid hit the paper, it would start to sizzle without the aid of a struck match.  
  
But that didn’t happen because I didn’t put the fluid on the money. I scraped the stacks off the grate, dumping them back into the duffel bag with one swoop of my arm.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
I know what you're thinking, and I don't blame you. I suspected I had nearly a million murder dollars in my possession, and I didn't immediately destroy them. It's ok for you to judge my decision to not torch them on the grill as soon as I suspected I had played a role – albeit unintentional – in the deaths of Laura, Tim Daley, of Sara Miles, and the toll booth worker. His name was Jesse Preston, I’d later found out.  
   
That would have been the utterly rational, reasonable, and morally correct thing to do. There were two reasons why I didn't do this. First, I still wasn't sure. I was leaving the door open for the infinitely small possibility of coincidence.  
  
I needed to prove it, and what if there was a way I could? Maybe I could look at the local online sex offender registry. I could check to see what each of them did – the records were readily available – and then pay them a visit. The logic of why I would be giving them money still needed to be worked out, but I was spitballing.  
  
I could find the most heinous one, give him some of the loot, and see what happened. But even though I’d be doing society at large a solid, it didn’t sit right with me. There was something a bit too…murder-y about it.  
Whatever our collective disgust for their crimes might be, according to our laws, these people – men, mostly – paid for what they’d done. Even if that doesn't mean they atoned for it, I wasn't keen on going around as some pedo Punisher.  
  
The second reason I didn't burn it all was that I couldn't. I don't know if it was this money in particular or if it would have been any money that amounted to just under a million dollars. But it held me. It enraptured me. I thought about it constantly. I would open the duffel bags, peel back some cellophane, and caress the money. Myyyy preciousssss.  
  
That's a weakness on my part. It would have been different if I'd grown up with money and not dirt poor. But that doesn't make much sense now that I see it in writing. The rich, long noted for their lack of greed and avarice, right?  
But back to the first reason – I needed to be sure. What if it was just dumb luck? The craziest coincidence imaginable? Because, really – cursed money? How does that begin to make sense?  
  
I thought of other angles. Maybe I could deposit it at the bank, which would be like laundering it, getting it clean of whatever cursed it. I wouldn't deposit it at the window because I didn't want to inadvertently kill some poor teller just because I was sick of driving my shitbox car and living paycheck to paycheck.  
Maybe I could deposit it in the ATM a bit at a time, drawing on it as needed. Of course, I wasn't sure how that would play out. Would it kill the bank manager or the Wells Fargo armored truck guy when he came to empty the machine, like it did with the cash box at the Banana? So that was out.  
  
Every idea met a dead end except for one. Remember what I said about people who have done their time and paid their debt to society? What about people who haven't? What if there were someone who was so unassailably bad that he deserved to die? Someone that I knew was bad because he had killed my sister and escaped justice.
