When we got there,  Lisa changed her mind. “I don’t want to climb up there anymore” she complained. “Why not, are you still scared of what that old guy said?” I teased.

“So what if I am?” she retorted.

""One hundred steps to heaven, or a thousand steps to hell,” pretty catchy, at least that’s how it was translated to us. But why would that scare you?” I asked.

“It’s just the way he said it, like he meant it as a warning, well maybe not a warning, but he definitely seemed concerned,” she replied. "Like, when he realized where we were going, he wouldn't let us leave until we heard what he said."

“How would you even know what he meant? How would you know it was a warning by how he said it? He barely spoke English. We had to record him and then have it translated at the hotel, even the people there weren't sure exactly what he meant!” I replied laughing. I continued "Lisa, you're putting a lot of weight on the words of a guy selling dumplings, I'm pretty sure he didn't want us to leave because he wanted us to buy more stuff!"

Lisa pouted, which is how I know she was serious. “We shouldn’t go up there,” she said.

I tried to reason with her: “Lisa, they call this place “the land of 10,000 temples,” and it seems like all of them have been climbed and explored by a million people. We finally found one no other tourist seems to know about, and now you’ve changed your mind? You can at least tell me what you’re scared of. The structure looks safe, so we don’t have to be afraid of an accident, like the stairs collapsing.”

Lisa stared at the entrance of the temple. “”One hundred steps to heaven, or a thousand steps to hell.” I'm just trying to figure that out. It’s like, what happens if we climb up a hundred steps? Or what if we come back down and what if…..” she trailed off as I stood there bemused.

“You know what,” she exclaimed, “I’m staying right here. You can go up by yourself."

I sighed, "Alright fine, you wait down here. No one's around, but this area seems pretty safe. We have cell phone reception, we're only a 20 minute walk from the main road, our hotel knows we're here, and since you insisted even our embassy knows we're here! I'll be up and down in a few minutes, ok? I just want to check out the view from the top, and I'll take a picture."

"That's fine," Lisa replied, "You go on ahead, and I'll wait down here. Might as well get used to this kind of thing, I knew what I was getting into when I married you. I'll be scrolling through TikTok."

I gave her a thumbs up and entered the temple. When I saw the old, winding, stone stairway leading to the rooftop, I had a sudden thought: ""One hundred steps to heaven, or a thousand steps to hell," you know what, I'm gonna count the steps." I started my climb.

"I really needed this trip," I said to myself happily as I counted:"36, 37, 38, 39"

"For dinner, we should go to that restaurant by the hotel," I thought to myself as I counted:"67, 68, 69."

"We need to remember to buy souvenirs," I reminded myself as I counted: "76, 77, 78, 79."

"Wait, am I here already?" I said aloud as I counted "96, 97, 98, 99, 100."

I looked around on the rooftop of the temple, and was thoroughly disappointed. The view wasn't anything special. I could see a little of the countryside, and the cars driving on the main road. A small bird flew away as I looked around, but I was alone. And the temple itself didn't seem at all different from all the ones we already saw.

"Oh well, they can't all be great," I shrugged to myself as I snapped a quick photo. I made my way back to the stairway, started my descent, and unconsciously started counting again.

"Ok what's going on," I thought nervously as I counted "296, 297, 298, 299"

"There has to be a logical explanation" I reasoned to myself as I counted "596, 597, 598, 599."

"You just suck at math, so you miscounted, that's all" I reassured myself as I counted "796, 797, 798, 799."

"Oh dear God, what's happening" I thought, terrified,  as I counted "996, 997, 998, 999, 1000."
