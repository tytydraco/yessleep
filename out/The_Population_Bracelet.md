The Population Bracelet has been a mandatory device for every citizen in the country I live in for about a decade. The country faced a declining population, with a low birth rate which led to concerns about its future. The government needed to keep things updated in real-time as the numbers continued to decrease.

The bracelet looks like a wristwatch, but instead of showing the time, it displays a number—a rank. The wearer's rank in the population. The oldest person has number 1 displayed on their bracelet's screen.

Mine? It displays 5 billion something. I'm only 30 years old right now.

Yesterday, I woke up in my apartment room, staring at the scene outside my window. Then I glanced at my wrist.

My bracelet still displayed a number in the 5 billion range.

The government made wearing the bracelet mandatory—to the point that going outside without it is considered a crime. Anyone caught without it faces 24 hours in prison.

I took a few days off from work and planned to spend my holiday at my parents' house, out of town. I hadn't seen them in months due to work.

Once I finished packing, I grabbed my car keys and took off.

When I arrived at my parents' front door, my mom greeted me with so much love and passion. She hugged me so tightly, as if I were a seven-year-old who had been missing for three years. Like she always does.

The first day at my parents' house went as it always did. We spent the night talking in the dining room, sharing stories we hadn't known about each other during the time we were apart. When the clock struck 10 p.m., I asked to go to my room upstairs. I was tired from the trip and quickly fell asleep.

This morning, when I woke up, I felt strange. I couldn't describe why.

I did the first thing I always do—I lifted my right arm to check the bracelet I never take off, not even when I sleep. I don’t want to risk 24 hours in prison just because I left it at home.

I checked the number displayed on the screen. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me because what I saw didn’t make sense. I looked at it over and over, opening my eyes wider each time. I shook my bracelet several times, just in case it was malfunctioning.

The number didn’t change.

The number on my bracelet stated 275,863.

I woke up this morning, and suddenly, I’m ranked number 275,863 in the population? What the hell. That doesn't make sense. I'm only 30 years old.

How could I have shifted from 5 billion to 275,863 in just one night?

I immediately ran to my parents' room. I just wanted to ask if their bracelets were malfunctioning too. If I had suddenly become number 275,863, then what about them?

I knocked on my parents' door before opening it—only to witness a horrifying scene inside the room.

On the bed, where my mom and dad should have been, lay something else.

Two babies, lying side by side.

I rushed toward them, staring at their faces. My parents had shown me pictures of themselves as babies before. And these babies on the bed looked exactly like them.

If someone saw me, they might think I was crazy, but I stared at the baby girl and asked, "Mom?"

The baby girl stared back at me, her eyes filled with shock, horror, and confusion. The exact same expression was in the baby boy’s eyes.

From the way they looked at me, I could tell. They really were my parents. Somehow, they had turned into babies.

"Wait… Wait here, okay?" I told them frantically before running outside the house. I told them to wait, but in their condition, it wasn’t like they could do anything else on their own.

I hopped out onto the porch and looked around.

The neighborhood was eerily silent.

I ran to Mr. and Mrs. Stevenson's house next door. The door wasn't locked, so I walked in.

"Mr. Stevenson? Mrs. Stevenson? I’m so sorry, I really need help!" I shouted in panic. But when I reached the living room, I saw two more babies lying there.

One baby was lying on the couch, next to today’s newspaper. The other was on the carpeted floor, beside a still-running vacuum cleaner.

Mr. and Mrs. Stevenson were a dark-skinned couple, and both babies in the living room were also dark-skinned.

Seeing what had happened to my parents, I immediately realized—that the Stevensons had turned into babies too. It looked like Mr. Stevenson had been reading the newspaper and Mrs. Stevenson had been cleaning the house when it happened.

Something terrible was happening, and I had no idea why.

As I was about to run outside to look for other people, I caught sight of the news on the Stevensons' television. A breaking news broadcast flashed across the screen.

"A few hours ago, a government research facility had exploded," the anchor said frantically, explaining exactly what was happening.

"The government had been working on a top-secret project called the 'Forever Young Serum,’" she continued in an extreme hurry. "The serum was designed to reverse aging—reducing a person’s age while allowing them to retain their memories and knowledge."

"So, the Population Bracelet being extremely mandatory has anything to do with it?" I muttered.

"Because of the explosion, the serum, which had been stored in a tank, had turned into a gas and spread rapidly across the country—," the anchor continued explaining the situation when she abruptly stopped and appeared to twitch.

Her body began shaking violently, then shrinking before my eyes—on live television.

Within minutes, she lay on the floor—as a baby. Her facial expression was filled with horror and confusion.

Now I understood. My mind raced.

Everyone had been affected.

And the reaction, it seems, was occurring from the oldest to the youngest.

My parents and the Stevensons—both in their 60s—had turned into babies hours ago.

The news anchor, who I knew was 38, had just transformed live on air.

If I was right, that meant I only had hours… or minutes before I, too, turned into a baby.
