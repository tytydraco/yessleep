It was April Fool’s Day and me being the butt of the joke among my friends every year thought I deserved a little payback. It was supposed to be a bit of harmless fun. I never imagined things would get so out of control. I’d been planning my revenge since the beginning of March. I knew my friends were already brainstorming as well.  
  
  
This had been going on ever since we first met in high school. It started when the oldest of our group, Billy, offered me a chocolate pudding cup mixed with ghost pepper powder. In his words afterward,  I was “crying like a little bitch”. The following year, the second oldest, Devin, stole my clothes while I was in the gym shower. I had to spend the rest of the day wearing mixed-matched clothes from the lost and found.   
  
  
Both of these events occurred during April Fool’s so I put together that this would be a yearly occurrence. No matter how careful I was, though, I’d always fall victim. The year after the gym shower incident, I made sure not to accept any food from my friends. I also kept my clothes close to the shower from then on. However, if there was anything I could expect from my friends it was that they’d never pull the same prank twice.  
  
  
During junior year, our other friend, Kirby slipped a stink bomb into my backpack during science class. Due to this, I was referred to as “Stinky Sam” until graduation and I received two days of OSS. My friends had a knack for avoiding punishment. It also helped them that  I didn’t want to be seen as a snitch. The April Fool’s before graduation, we all got invited to a party and there I was subject to the most devastating prank of all.  
  
  
They talked a girl into hooking up with me at the party and being quite hormonal at the time, I failed to notice the glaring red flag before me. The next sign came when she told me to wait outside while she “got ready”.  Then when I came into the room where the lights were off, she told me to strip down. In hindsight, the lack of illumination should have been my final warning. When I was fully naked, she flipped the lights on.  
  
  
My friends and other graduates were waiting and took pictures of me in my birthday suit. It was a good thing it was our last year because right then I wished I would have spontaneously combusted. This tradition continued even into college. After an incident involving a raccoon and a lot of spiders, it was the last straw for me. I wanted to be the one laughing so I needed to pull off the granddaddy of all pranks.  
  
  
I’m terrible at keeping secrets which meant I needed to be careful about letting my hand slip. Not only did I want to get back at them, I wanted to make sure they never messed with me again. In a way, I suppose I did succeed just not how I intended. The biggest issue for me was deciding what sort of prank to pull.  They had a lot under their belts and I wanted mine to be original.   
  
  
After much self-deliberation, I came to the conclusion I would need a professional. The question then was who would it be? It had to be someone none of us had any connection with. That way none of my friends would be tipped off. There was only one place I could think of, the dark web.  
  
Unbeknownst to anyone in my social circle, I'd been an avid connoisseur of it for several years.  I logged on one day while the others were out of the house we were renting. Several hours of searching went by before I came across something I thought could help. It was a site with a whoopie cushion as the logo so I assumed whoever made it must be quite the jokester. I clicked on it.  
  
  
When I did, for a split second I could have sworn I saw the logo change to some weird face with sharp teeth and horns. Not thinking much of this, I proceeded and came to a chat box with only one user. PranksALot was their name.   
  
  
“Hey,” I typed.  
  
“Yo, what's good?” PranksALot typed back.  
  
  
Cutting straight to the chase, I explained my situation and asked if he had any ideas for me.  
  
  
“I can do better than that. What if I pranked your friends for you?”  
  
  
This surprised me. I never expected this person would offer to meet me in person. I of course knew the many dangers of browsing the dark web. I’d heard the stories of mishaps leading to people being stalked. For that reason, I was always good about noping the hell out whenever I saw trouble. Naturally, I was cautious about the offer.  
  
  
“What exactly would you need from me in return?”  
  
“Nothing at all. Just tell me the where and when and I’ll make it happen. You just have to trust me.”  
  
  
I spent a couple minutes considering, asking myself if this was worth the risk. Then I remembered everything my friends had put me through. Due to the raccoon incident, I had to get a rabies shot. I responded with all the information needed. Since I’d never done anything like this before, the advantage I had was the element of surprise.  
  
  
The location in question was to be our home where a party would be hosted to kick off Spring Break. Truth be told, I wasn’t enthusiastic. For all I knew, the person I talked with wasn’t going to show up. Nonetheless, I made sure to act as if nothing was out of the ordinary. Fast forward to the morning of April 1st. I woke up to the feather and shaving cream trick.  
  
  
“Fuck y’all,” I yelled.  
  
  
I could hear Kirby laughing as he ran away down the hall.   
  
  
“Cheap-ass landlord never having the locks fixed,” I thought.  
  
  
I got ready in the bathroom and went out into the hall. Glancing down, I noticed some tripwire. Peeking over it, there was a contraption filled with eggs. Knowing my friends, I figured they weren’t fresh. How they never cost us their deposit I’ll never understand.   
  
  
Although, in a place where gas pipes are rarely repaired, money back should be a guarantee. I stepped over the wire and went towards the stairs. It was the second or third step that had been coated in butter. I slipped and fell on my side, slipping down the rest of the way.  
  
  
“Watch your step,” Billy told me,  
  
  
He and the rest of my friends doubled over, laughing.  
  
  
“Hey, now, that’s enough guys,” Devin said and went over to help me up.  
  
  
I was in too much pain to register the strap around his hand. The shock I got knocked me out of my daze.  
  
  
“For one year, one god damn year can you guys just not do this shit to me?” I asked.  
  
  
Billy frowned.  
  
  
“Hey, guys, I don’t think Sam likes this.”  
  
“Yeah, maybe we should stop,” Devin said in the same pseudo-concerned tone.  
  
  
It didn’t take long for them to burst out in laughter. Ignoring them, I went to get something to eat. A bowl of Honey Bunches Of Oats With Almonds would hit the spot. That’s what I thought until I poured out the cereal and saw ants crawling among the flakes. Sighing, I got up and not trusting the food at the house anymore, decided eating out would be better.   
  
  
I turned over my shoes and shook them where some roaches fell out.  Cursing under my breath, I slipped them on and opened the front door. There was another wire there that this time I tripped over. The others must’ve heard me fall because they went back to their hyena impressions. All I could do was hope they got theirs soon.  
  
  
The party was going to be at 8 PM and according to them would be an all-out rager. I got some chicken and bread rolls from the local convenience store, then went to the park to kill some time.  I got back at around 8:30 where things were already in full swing. I knocked on the door and was greeted by Kirby who, by the smell of his breath and the lampshade sitting on his head, was already several drinks in.  
  
  
“Sam, you’re just in time. We got our old DDR game setup!”  
  
  
The next thing I knew, he grabbed my wrist and pulled me in. Billy and Devin were already going at it in the living room with the former having the slight lead. As an aside, I've never been any good at that game. I’d let PranksALot know I’d be wearing my retro Mario Bros 2 shirt, a game that I think is highly underrated, by the way. I scanned the room for anyone I thought could be PranksAlot.  
  
  
I recognized most people from our campus, save for a few people. However,  PranksAlot let me know I’d be able to tell who they were right away and nobody I saw so far gave off that vibe. The party hadn’t been going for long, though so I remained patient. With all the party activity, you'd think my friends would be too busy to mess with me. You’d be wrong.  
  
  
  
Billy had a persuasive charisma about him that enabled him to convince people to do his bidding. This time was no exception. DDR was eventually switched out for Mario Kart. Someone offered me a chair to sit in. When I did, it collapsed and I fell to the floor.  This was of course met with instant guffawing.   
  
  
This increased when I grabbed the side of the coffee table to help myself up and found my hand stuck to it.  Wishing that everyone would be hit by a train, I grabbed my wrist with my free hand and then ripped it away from the table. I blew on my hand as it was in pain.  Despite my frustration, I performed pretty well, even beating Billy a few times.  
  
  
An hour or so went by when suddenly something happened nobody could have predicted. I got up to grab something to drink. I went into the kitchen where I was smacked in the face with a pie by Kriby.  
  
  
“Do you ever get sick of doing this shit?”  
  
“Nope!”  
  
  
I wiped away some of the whipped cream with the back of my hand, then used the paper towels to clean up the rest.  Suddenly, the ground began violently shaking.  The lights flickered and the faucet turned on and off.   
  
  
“What the hell’s going on?” I heard Devin yell. “An earthquake?”  
  
“Since when did we get those?” Kirby replied.  
  
  
I went back into the living room. People were holding to what they could to keep their footing.   
  
  
“Everyone shut the fuck up,” Billy ordered ord everyone quieted down.  
  
  
The calm only lasted a second before there was a thud at the door. This was followed by several more and then it flew off the hinges. Standing in the doorway, was a monstrosity the likes of which we could hardly comprehend. Its skin was grey and it was naked. Its head which vaguely resembled a jester hat was covered in eyes.  
  
  
It wielded a giant mallet. Thinking this was a joke, one very inebriated partygoer went up to the creature.  
  
  
“Hey, man, cool costume. How’d you make the house shake like-?”  
  
  
He was cut off when the hammer was swung against his head, turning into something resembling a crushed watermelon. There was a brief period of silence following this, then we all freaked the fuck out. People were tripping over each other in an attempt to escape. The monster was on a rampage. It grabbed several people.  
  
  
 It must’ve had some kind of electric powers because their bodies jerked and smoke came out of their ears and mouth. It was all happening so fast. I scarcely comprehend the unfolding horrors. Several more people tried fleeing. It stretched its arms and caught them with ease. They begged and pleaded to be let go to no avail.  
  
  
What it did next is almost too horrible to describe. It turned them upside down and then lifted its leg. It let out a massive fart that peeled the skin from their faces, leaving only their skulls behind. It dropped their corpses onto the floor and looked at me. I wanted to run, but my body wouldn't listen.  
  
  
To my confusion, though, it ignored me in favor of people trying to escape out the back door. Some people upstairs thought they could sneak past it out where the front door used to be. Too bad for them, it shot a mucus-like substance from its palms that filled up the door frame. They tried to break through it. Sadly, it appeared the substance was highly acidic, and as soon they touched it, they screamed in agonizing pain.  
  
  
The creature made an odd noise and I realized it was laughing. It was horrible like tearing metal mixed with nails on a chalkboard. What was this thing and why was it here? That was the first question on my mind. The second was how do I get out of there before that thing decides to rip me apart?   
  
  
If there’s one thing that gets in the way of people surviving, it’s people. In their attempt to reach the back door, people were shoving each other out of the way. If they had just stayed calm and went out one at a time, many of them would have survived. Unfortunately, things didn’t pan out that way. The monster had plenty of time to run into the kitchen while wildly swinging its mallet over its head.  
  
  
  
I didn’t need to see what happened next to know it was nothing short of a slaughter. All the shrieking and bone-crushing is something I’ll never forget. I raced upstairs seeing as how that was the only place that was remotely safe for me.  
  
  
“Guys?” I said, trying to keep my voice low.  
  
“In here!” Billy replied from my bedroom.  
  
  
Devin and Kirby were in there as well.  
  
  
“Okay, so what’s the plan?” I asked.  
  
  
They looked at me like I had two heads.  
  
  
“The plan is to shut the fuck up and hope that thing downstairs goes away,” Billy told me.  
  
“What? But, Devin, I thought your room had a fire escape?”  
  
“Nah, we already tried that. It broke, sorry.”  
  
  
I suggested we make rope out of the bedsheets.  
  
  
“There’s not enough here for that,” Devin said sadly.  
  
“What do we have that can help us then?”  
  
“I got some Axe body spray and a lighter,” Billy said.  
  
“Who the hell still uses that stuff?” Kirby asked.  
  
“It was discounted, alright?”  
  
  
Stomping ascended the stairs and we all froze. Billy raised a finger to his lips and I backed slowly from the door.  
  
  
  
“Y’all don’t think I know you’re in there?” we heard from the other side of it.  
  
  
We gasped and then it was knocked off its hinges. The creature came in. Something I didn’t notice before was that it had a mouth. It gave a wicked grin full of razor-sharp teeth. Despite how on the verge of shitting myself I was, I managed to speak to it.  
  
  
“What are you and why are you here?”  
  
  
It stopped and then the house shook again with its cackling.  
  
  
“I thought you would’ve figured out who I am by now, Sam! You don’t remember? We chatted earlier this month!”  
  
  
The pieces clicked together.  
  
  
“Holy shit,” I said. “You mean, you’re PranksALot?”  
  
“In the flesh.”  
  
“Wait, who?” Devin asked.  
  
  
I confessed about my chat with it earlier in the month.  
  
  
“Are you fucking kidding dude?” Billy said. “We pull some jokes on you and you sent this fucking thing after us?”  
  
“Hey, I just said to prank you guys. I never said anything about getting murdered by a demon.”  
  
“Actually, I’m an alien,” it corrected me.  
  
  
  
It explained that it had to flee from its planet after an atomic stink bomb destroyed a city.  
  
  
“Most beings in the universe don’t have a sense of humor so I’ve been pretty bored, but you humans are different. That’s why I like you.”  
  
“Then why have you been killing everyone?” Billy asked.  
  
“Because there’s nothing funner than pranking the prankster. After I’m done here, I’ll wreak havoc on your entire town.”  
  
  
Billy held up his axe can and lighter.  
  
  
“Stay back,” he said shakily. “I’m warning you!”  
  
  
It ignored the threat and raised its mallet. Just then a smell reached the room. It reminded me of…Rotten eggs. Then I remembered that one of the noises I heard earlier was it smashing the walls of the kitchen. That’s where the gas pipes were.  
  
  
“Billy, don’t!” I tried to warn.  
  
  
I was too late. He flicked on his lighter, causing a massive explosion that killed us all instantly including PranksALot. When the smoke cleared, we stood in the burnt wreckage of our home as ghosts.  
  
  
“Smooth move, dumb ass,” Kirby told Billy.  
  
“Fuck you, at least I did something instead of just standing there.”  
  
“Yeah, a fat lot of good that did,” Devin said, “and anyway, this is all Sam’s fault to begin with.”  
  
“My fault? You guys have been fucking with me for years so excuse me for wanting some payback.”  
  
“If we weren’t already dead, we would kill you right now,” Billy replied to me.  
  
  
ParnksAot cleared his throat. Aliens can become ghosts too apparently so there’s that I guess.   
  
  
“I suppose you could say this night really…Backfired!”  
  
“You know you’re dead too, right?” I asked.  
  
  
It shrugged.  
  
  
“My species reincarnates after a century. Anyway, I’m going to haunt a DMV. Later, bitches!”  
  
  
PranksALot flipped us off and floated away.  
  
  
“Well, what now?” Devin asked.  
  
“Let’s go fuck with some people,” Billy said.  
  
  
The rest of that night was spent scaring people half to death. In a way, I was successful. It’s been two years since everything went down and I haven’t been pranked since. I’ve typed this all up and a library computer that I accessed after hours. This post is already long.   
  
  
However, I will say there are some rules to being a ghost and I need to be careful about what I do.  If there’s anything I can leave off with it’s this. Be careful who you talk with on the dark web because even if they seem like jokesters, they may have a twisted [sense](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) of [humor.](https://www.threads.net/@rose_black2222)
