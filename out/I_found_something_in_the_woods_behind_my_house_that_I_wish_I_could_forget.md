I need to tell someone about this. I haven't slept properly in days, and I'm starting to see things in the corners of my vision. Maybe writing it down will help, or maybe one of you will know what to do. I don't know anymore.

My house sits at the edge of a small town in northern Maine. The backyard extends about fifty feet before it meets the treeline of a dense forest that stretches for miles. I've lived here for three years and have hiked those woods countless times without incident. At least until last week.

I was walking my usual trail last Wednesday afternoon. It was unseasonably warm for May, and I wanted to enjoy the sunshine before the inevitable rain came back. About two miles in, I noticed something odd. The birds had stopped singing. Complete silence. Not even the rustle of leaves in the breeze.

That's when I saw it—a small clearing off to my right that I'd never noticed before. The grass was dead in a perfect circle, about fifteen feet in diameter. At the center was what looked like a crude stone well, maybe three feet tall.

I approached it cautiously. The stonework looked ancient, covered in a type of moss I'd never seen before—dark purple, almost black. But the strangest thing? The air around it seemed... wrong. Like it was thicker somehow. Each step toward it felt like wading through invisible molasses.

Against my better judgment, I peered down into the well. It was too dark to see the bottom, but I could make out something reflective about ten feet down. I took out my phone to use as a flashlight, and that's when I heard it—a soft whisper that seemed to come from directly behind me.

"*Finally...*"

I spun around, but there was nobody there. Just the silent forest. My heart was hammering in my chest, but curiosity got the better of me. I turned back to the well and shined my light down.

What I saw still haunts me. It wasn't water reflecting my light—it was eyes. Dozens of them, blinking independently of each other. Then they all focused on me at once, and the whisper came again, this time from the well:

"*We've been waiting for you.*"

I dropped my phone in shock. It clattered down the well, illuminating something pale and spindly starting to climb up toward me. I ran. I ran faster than I've ever run in my life, not stopping until I burst out of the treeline into my backyard.

That night, my phone rang. My phone that should have been at the bottom of that well. The caller ID showed my own number. I didn't answer.

The calls have continued every night since then, always at 3:17 AM. Last night, I finally worked up the courage to answer. There was only breathing on the other end, wet and ragged, before a voice—my voice—whispered:

"*We're coming up now. We found the way to your home.*"

I looked out my bedroom window toward the woods and saw lights moving between the trees, approaching slowly. They weren't flashlights. They were too small, too numerous, and they blinked.

This morning, I found wet, moss-covered footprints on my back porch. Purple-black moss, exactly like what was on the well. And there was a message written in the condensation on my kitchen window, visible only from the inside:

"*Thank you for the invitation.*"

I don't know what to do. I can't leave—I tried. My car won't start, and whenever I try to walk down the driveway, I get disoriented and somehow end up back at the house. Cell service is gone, and my internet cuts out whenever I try to look up information about the well or send messages about my situation.

This is my last attempt to reach out. I'm using my neighbor's unsecured WiFi, which somehow still works. If anyone knows what's happening or how to stop it, please help. I can hear something scratching at the basement door now.

Wait. I just realized something. The footprints this morning... they were heading *out* of the house, not in.

Oh god. I think they're already inside me.

If you're ever hiking in the woods of northern Maine and find a strange well, run. Don't look inside. Don't listen to the whispers. 

And if you get a call from your own number at 3:17 AM, whatever you do, don't answer.

UPDATE: The scratching has stopped. Instead, there's a tapping on my bedroom door. Tap-tap-tap. Pause. Tap-tap-tap. It's been going on for twenty minutes now. I'm going to try to make it to the kitchen for a knife. If I don't update again, tell my family I love them. Though I'm starting to forget what they look like.

UPDATE 2: I looked in the mirror. My eyes are wrong. They're blinking out of sync with each other.
