You'll have to forgive me if I make any mistakes. I have never been allowed to use a phone before. I'll start right at the beginning, I guess.



When I was born, God chose me to be a hero. As a little baby, I was born with thick blonde curls, and Mama said that was the Lord's doing, sending down one of his very own angels to Mama and Papa to protect the family. 

It was my hair that made me holy, that of which made me pure. I remember spending hours upon hours sitting on the bathroom floor while my mother groomed and preened my hair with a bucket load of products, made to stay still and quiet even as she tore through knots. 

Obedience was a very big thing on the hill, you know. If you weren't obedient, you weren't worth a bed. We all lived on a very large hill. Mama, Papa, all of my siblings, the elders, and about a dozen other families were spread across a clump of houses across the way from the church. The houses were all rather small, besides ours, of course, and even if ours hadn't been small it was still packed. If you weren't worth it, you didn't learn how to be good and *soon*, Papa walked you down into the woods that the hill led down into.

I.. I'm not sure what happens after that.



When I was seven, I was old enough to go out on field service alone, according to Father Fire. We were always trying to spread the Good Word. I'd known since before I could remember that if you weren't a follower of the fire, you weren't making it to the paradise that comes after life. Follow the fire, the misery, the pain for your entire life, and God *will* reward you. Unfortunately, most people didn't follow the fire. They followed the light, the selfish joy and instant gratification. 

I felt very sad, even back then, thinking of all the people that God was going to punish for being so selfish. I wanted so badly to save them, I begged my parents to let me go on field service. My job was to hand out pamphlets, in which Father Fire, my papa, had written down the word of God about the fire and all that. 

When you went on a mission, you had to trek down the hill, go to the bus stop and then ride the bus into the city. I kind of just wandered around the city back then, until I had at least a few people accept my pamphlets. 

Father Fire had never needed to tell me outright that if I didn't hand out a few pamphlets, I didn't come home until I did. It was just kind of an unspoken rule. Sometimes I didn't come home until very late at night. That was when Mama swept me up into her arms at the gate, brushed her hand through my hair, and tucked me into bed.




When I was eight, I met Rowan Holloway. I had found myself in an outdoor market one fair Saturday, and he *literally* ran into me. He was taller than me, with bright green eyes in contrast to my stark gray, scruffy blond hair that was longer than what was proper, and a bright yellow smiley face shirt that was way too big on him. He was hyper, as I soon learned he always was, just excited to make a new 'friend'.

I had strict orders not to speak to other kids unless it was for service. "Don't even look at them, all they'll do is distract you and lead you away from God." My mother had said sternly. That was all I had really been able to think about as this boy talked at me, and I'd realized I couldn't breathe. 

He had grabbed my hand and pretty much dragged me through the bustling crowd, leading me towards a large woman in a pink bathrobe puffing on a cigarette near one of the stalls. She had blown a stream of smoke down at us, and I vaguely registered from Rowan that this was his mother, and he wanted her permission to 'Bring me 'round' his room. We spent hours playing with his toys that day, and once I calmed down, I hadn't known that kind of happiness existed.




Very shortly after I began coming back to the outdoor market just to see Rowan, my hair began changing color. Ms. Holloway said that was just a part of growing up for some people, but I knew better. My perfect blonde hair, the same hair that marked me as the future savior, began to reflect my sin. My dishonesty, my disobedience, you could see it all when my roots started turning an ugly black. Soon my whole head of hair was black.

The late night hair care sessions spent on the bathroom floor stopped. My mother could barely look at me, and when my father did, it was with contempt. My black curls began to mat, despite my own fumbled efforts to brush it with my fingers. It grew and grew, a rat's nest that, by the time I was thirteen, went down to my waist. An improper length. I couldn't find it in myself to care about my hair, my inherent sin, my failure to my family, anything by that point. I knew I would make it all up soon. I spent most of my time outside of the market on the hill, kneeling in the chapel and confessing my sins to God where I would never be brave enough to confess to my father. 

I went back to the market any chance I got to spend time with Rowan. Poor, sweet Rowan. Five years flew by and he knew something was wrong, but he also knew all I wanted to do was help him with his Nintendo game levels, listen to him talk about his day and help his mother around shop. It was an unspoken rule not to ask.

By that time, I vowed to try to be a better friend than ever. I only had a year left, after all.




My fourteenth year was the year I was destined to save my family. Just as predicted, our crops we grew on the side of the hill began dying. 

This happened every fourteen years, and Father Fire carried on the word from God that He wanted a pure child of His back in His kingdom in exchange for bountiful crops once again. If He did not get it, we would starve.

My birthday was regarded as a holy day. I had assured Rowan that I would see him next time the week before with a heavy heart. On my birthday, my mother woke me up before the sun rose. She brought me into the bathroom, and told me to sit on the tile. 

Mother Fire shaved my hair down to the scalp, and bleached it as best she could. Then she fitted my Sunday best to me, fussing with my tie and smoothing down my front with a cool, almost clinical precision. There was no love in any of it. I didn't expect there to be. I stood still and remained quiet. 

I received one birthday gift that night, standing on the altar in the church beside Father Fire. The moonlight shone in through the windows, accompanied only by candle light to illuminate the chapel. The pews were full, of everyone on the hill, to the point that some of the children were sitting on the floor. Dozens of eyes stared me down as I took the thin purple box in my hands, adorned with a bright orange ribbon. I stared hard at that ribbon, determined not to look anywhere else. 

Not back at any of the eyes, not at Father Fire's hands, trembling with the unsteadiness of old age as he gripped the canister of gasoline, and not at any of the small flames flickering on the walls.

I drew the lighter from the gift box and prayed to the Lord that it wouldn't hurt.
