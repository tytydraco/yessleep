They say you never really know a house until you’ve lived in it for a while.

I bought mine cheap—too cheap, in hindsight. A two-bedroom fixer-upper on the edge of town, sagging porch, creaky floors, wallpaper that peeled like sunburnt skin. But I saw potential. I saw a place to finally be alone, away from everything. Away from her.

The first night I moved in, I couldn’t sleep. It wasn’t the usual insomnia. It was the sound—scraping, slow and deliberate, coming from the walls. I tried to tell myself it was rats, or maybe the wind. But it wasn’t the kind of sound that scurries or whistles. It was more… methodical. Like someone dragging fingernails across the inside of the drywall.

I checked the attic the next morning. Nothing. Then the basement. Still nothing. But when I was down there, I found something odd: a small door tucked behind the furnace, barely three feet high. It had no handle, just a rusted metal latch.

Curiosity won out. I pried it open.

It led to a crawlspace—low, narrow, pitch-black. The air was stale, damp, like the breath of something that had been sleeping a long time. I shined my flashlight inside and saw nothing but dirt and cobwebs. Just before I backed out, I noticed something: deep scratches in the wooden beams. Long and parallel, like claw marks.

I closed the door and tried to forget about it.

That night, the sounds got worse.

It wasn’t just scratching. I heard whispers, low and hoarse, coming from the vents. I turned off the TV and held my breath. Still there. Not words exactly—more like the shape of words. Something trying to speak but failing.

I barely slept. In the morning, I checked my bedroom wall. There were new scratches. From the inside.

I started locking the basement door at night. It made me feel safer. That illusion lasted two days.

I woke up around 3 a.m. to the sound of footsteps. Not above me—beneath me. Slow, heavy, pacing. My chest tightened. I didn’t move, didn’t breathe. Then the footsteps stopped, right below my bed.

I didn’t sleep the rest of the night.

The next morning, I found the basement door wide open.

That was when I called a contractor to seal the crawlspace. He arrived, went down with his tools, and didn’t come back up for twenty minutes. When he did, he looked pale, shaken.

“There’s something weird down there,” he said. “Like… symbols. Carved into the beams. Old ones. You didn’t put those there?”

I shook my head. He didn’t say anything else. Just packed up and left without doing the work.

I tried to seal it myself. Hammered boards over the little door, stacked bricks in front of it. That night, I heard the boards crack. Not from the house settling—from something pushing.

I don't remember falling asleep, but I woke to find dirt—damp, black dirt—on the floor of my bedroom. And a handprint smeared on the wall. Long fingers. Too many of them.

I should’ve left. I know that now.

But I stayed one more night. Just one more.

I don’t think I ever woke up.

Because now, I hear the whispers all the time. Not through the vents—but in my head. I can't move anymore. Can't speak. The dirt is everywhere. It's in my lungs. My eyes.

And sometimes, when the house is quiet, I hear footsteps upstairs.

Someone else has moved in.

I hope they don’t find the door.
