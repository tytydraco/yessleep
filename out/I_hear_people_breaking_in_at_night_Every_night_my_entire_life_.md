First off, I'm probably already a weird enough guy. I work third shift, I don't go out unless its to work, don't talk to anyone, still live with one of my parents, and possibly the most interesting thing about me: I sleep in a hammock. Every night for the past few years now. It started when I was feeling a little adventurous in life and with all the youth a working 22 Year Old Male, I sat my bed up against a wall one day and hung up a hammock from one end of my room to the other. Using four (VERY LONG, this is important) screws drilled (blindly, it took a few attempts) into my best guess as to where the stud was in the wall. Sure, the screws have given up once or twice, but its something I take a certain amount of pride in. Some might say its because I want to have something "Quirky" I do that convinces me I am unique in some way. Sometimes, when people ask why I sleep in a hammock, that's what I tell them. But its not the real reason...

For my entire life, whether I am sleeping in a bed, hammock, couch, chair, hell even the times in life where ive been on the floor, there has been...something happening. Every single night, for my entire life. At some point in the night, I would feel them. I would feel....it? I would describe it as a smashing sound, or a slam, or I would equate it to the sound of someone kicking in your front door. That's what I think it is, most of the time. But its not really the SOUND of it. Its the vibration. If I am sleeping on the floor, it really feels like the whole house shakes, or rumbles. In a couch, bed, etc, it feels like im on a bed, et all, that is violently shifted when the slam happens.

Instant panic attack, pretty much every time. Instinct takes over, I jump up and try to move my feet as fast to my bedroom door as I can, and the entire way to my families room I am picturing those graphic pictures so easily found on the internet... And then.... nothings happening.

Its hell. Its hell, and I am the tortured victim. Because every SINGLE TIME IT HAPPENS, I am convinced that THIS is the time that its real. And I will have completely ignored it and let whatever is about to happen, happen.

I still hear stories about how, as a toddler, I would end up screaming every night. And there was nothing to be done to console me. Growing up, memories of being confused as to what had happened get engrained into my memory, crying all night and still getting up to go to school that morning. It was horrible.

The "event" isn't always the same, either. Usually it's that slamming, door kicking sound. Sometimes, I end up thinking it sounds more like glass breaking, or like a parade of people running down the hallway. Sometimes, god the worst times, its screaming. Those are the ones that truly haunt me. Because I always feel like I am hearing the tail end of a very aggressive conversation and I should have been up and intervening way back.

I should probably clarify, I live in a very low density area at the moment. No one is near by enough for me to "overhear" anything like that. But it doesn't matter. It happened when I lived in two story apartments, where there actually WERE neighbors making a little bit of noise. Trying to figure out what was real and what wasn't was entirely out of the question for me. Every place I have lived, and with all the different people, it always happens and it never makes sense.

I've seen a therapist, and I have done all the tests that wonderful lady (genuinely, my therapist was a fantastic lady, very understanding) has recommended and she has said it's nothing like schizophrenia. She suspects night terrors and all the meds, meditation, and masturbation (forgive me, I like the alliteration) in the world has done nothing to stop it... At some point in the night, of course its usually RIGHT AS I am slipping off to sleep, it happens.

I have practiced rationalizing it. When it happens, I try to stop myself from jumping out of bed to go see what has went down, but it is so mentally taxing... And when I say I have tried EVERYTHING to get it to stop...I mean EVERYTHING.

In the start, I said I have been working third shift. For those who arent familiar with how that works, it means I go to work at 11PM and come home at 7AM. And still, when I NEED TO GO TO SLEEP, it always happens. When I was working a different shift, and sleeping a more regular sleep schedule, it would happen at night. At ACTUAL night. But now, it happens at MY night, roughly 12PM-4PM maybe.

I've asked everyone in my household and they all deny having heard anything, and I absolutely believe them. But also, I don't think its entirely in my head either...

I've been awake and active when it happens, and I wish I hadn't.  
One time, I was on a late night doing some hobby stuff on my computer when it happened. I couldn't believe it. Sitting at my desk, not in my bed, I heard a crash from what sounded like the living room, downstairs.

This time was especially brutal, as it seemed absolutely real. SURELY someone was breaking in, or hell maybe a bear was ravaging the whole house? It was louder. MUCH louder.

So I jumped up and basically jumped down the whole stair case. Right into eyesight of my poor mother, scared half to death of ME jumping down the stairs freaking out. Its really quite hard to explain to her, every time... I can see her trying to understand what I am telling her but I think I lose her at the part where I say "You can't hear it, but I hear something happening."

So, lets wrap back around for a second. Why a hammock? How does a hammock help with this? Well, dear reader who probably hadn't given it a second thought, a HAMMOCK has two points of contact with the house. The head, and the feet. I'm sure some of you have slept in a hammock before, theres a whole subreddit dedicated to it, but I really am not sure how many of them sleep in one every night the way I do. Im sure im not the only one. Anyway...

Those two points of contact provide two completely different vibation readings. And those vibration readings are what sets me off. In a bed, or a couch, et all, the whole bed will feel the vibration of the event. In a hammock, only ONE of the connections will. Its the strangest thing, genuinely the most baffling discovery I have ever made about this...unique predicament I am faced with. It happened the first night I slept in a hammock, and when I noticed it I felt like it might finally be a key to figuring out what the hell was going on.

And even bigger, perhaps the BIGGEST PART, there is PROOF of it. Sort of. When it happens, the screws and metal plate holding the hammock to the wall may actually shift slightly and damage the wall. This is extremely interesting to me. Because with a bed there is nothing left for me to see left over afterward.

So then I thought, maybe I am violently shaking at night or something strange? Pulling on the hammock when it happens? So I tried something crazy. I basically sacrificed a night of sleep, willingly, to test this out. I put more than enough blankets and pillows in the hammock, along with a bag of work stuff, to get my weight accurate, and I slept on the floor beside my hammock. And the hammock fucking SHOOK. I was frozen, I felt like god himself was saying "Because fuck you, thats why" right in my face. The whole ordeal doesnt last more than a minute or so, but the hammock was left bobbing a bit. And the side of the hammock it was leaning toward was the same side I felt the vibration from originally.

Reddit, please, for the love of all things holy, help me figure out what the hell is going on so I can GET SOME SLEEP

Edit 1: Its almost 8AM on the east coast, and wouldnt you guess it....It happened again. A jolting slam coming from  somewhere around my front yard. Poked my head up just enough to see out the window, see nothing, and go right back to sleep. Then, I remembered I made this post and decided to check if anyone had any advice. None...Hm...So much for a subreddit for people who cant sleep...

Also, I never mentioned that the location always seems to change. Its most usually the front door, but I just say that cause its a vague location approximation. Sometimes, like this last time, its the front yard. Those are the easy ones, its just a head pop up and make sure nothing is on fire or whatever.

But the close ones are the absolute WORST. When I was younger, there was one that sounded very LOUD, very METALLIC, and RIGHT OUTSIDE my bedroom door. I think I was maybe 17 when that happened. I was absolutely terrified, and just so...god awfully so tired. And the one that sounded so close it could come through my bedroom door....jesus....it still makes me shiver. I really need some sleep...hopefully theres just this one tonight. Usually its not more. If anyone has any advice, PLEASE let me know. I will respond asap to any questions. Debating taking pictures of the hammocks hanging side to show the damage but i dont know how much that would be worth...anyway.
