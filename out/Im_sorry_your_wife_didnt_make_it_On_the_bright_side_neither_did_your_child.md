I jogged down the office steps, unable to take the elevator- it was taking too damn long and I didn't have time to spare. My shoes squeaked against the clean tiles, and I dogged the bodies of my colleagues. 

I barely got the chance to glance at Jackson- he wasn't having it and grabbed my wrist right as I passed his cubical.

"Where do you think you're going?", he grinned. 

*"She's in labor"*, I muttered, smiling ear to ear. 

His eyes widened. He mirrored my expression and stood from his chair. His grip on my wrist turned borderline painful, but the adrenaline rush alone helped me ignore it, "Well why the hell are you still here? I'll handle your work. *Go to your damn wife and kid!"*

He pulled me into a quick but firm hug, patting my back twice as a gesture of goodluck. And just like that, I was off.

Out onto the parking-lot, into my piece of shit corola. 

The highway, ofcourse had bumper to bumper traffic, and the heavy rain didn't do much to help. My phone would alternate between ringing and buzzing from messages from friends and calls from family. 

Appeared everyone and their mother knew about the good news. And it brought an odd sense of pride. Tory, my wife's sister was the most persistent party, called to ask where I was- as well as gave me updates on how Tiffany was holding up. 

She wasn't at all far from the delivery room- I could hear the mother of my child screaming her lungs out in the background. And sure, my heartbeat was in my throat for obvious reasons, but I couldn't focus of anything but the road and Troy's voice. 

*"...so if you don't get your ass here in the next ten minutes? You'll officially be a deadbeat from day one!"*,she warned. 

"Very funny- how is she?", I asked, honking my horn at some moron who tried to swerve lanes. 

Tory paused, as if listening for my wife's cries of agony, then responded with, *"she's been better... but I'm sure she's fine*

"I'll try to make it as soon as possible!"

*"Yes, you will. Deadbeat clock is ticking. Tick tock, tick tock"*

"Tory!"

*"I'm kidding, Jesus! Just get here as soon as you can. They'll be waiting for you."*

I smiled at her wording...*they'll*

*I'm about to meet my babygirl...*

"I'll see you soon, Tory", I hung up. 

I'm not a particularly religious person. But I was mumbling a prayer to myself. Barely remembering the words, stumbled over syllables- jumbled phrases. But I prayed. 

*"If you're listening? Please protect my wife and child"*

Pregnancy is dangerous enough, Tiffany definitely has complications with hers, it technically was never supposed to happen- for medical reasons. 

She's perfectly fertile, so am I. Her womb was healthy, I had a high sperm count. Everything pointed towards us having a child sooner rather than later. 

Then a new strand of Covid hit. With it's own rules and expectations. No masks, nothing like that. It didn't even infect most of the population. Those it did infect? For some reason, they were advised not to try for children.

That's it.

*"We strongly advise you not to have biological children"*

I was infected.

And we abstained for 5 good years because we feared for the safety of our child. Our baby's health came first, our happiness was an afterthought. We were willing to wait. 

However... eventually we decided it's been long enough. Other variants of the virus are long gone from our bodies by now- this one can't be *that* different. We got tested- we were clear. And we tried for a baby. 

It happened quickly, as you can imagine, and Tiffany was pregnant, ready to face months of doctors visits and strange cravings. 

*...very strange cravings*

Making my drive to the hospital, stepping out and running to the front doors- finding Tory and hugging her in celebration, all the sweeter. We stood and paced in silence. As more of our family started showing up. 

My uncle and Aunt- Mary and Kyle- with a few of my cousins. My Granddad also turned up, all of them had this palpable buoyancy, as if stuggling to stay in place and I was no better. 

Tiffany's screams had died down- she was quiet and that gave me a bit of relief. Selfish, I know but it *does* hurt to hear someone you love so deeply, in pain. 

*But at any point by then, they'd call us in to meet the newest member of our family-*

Well... they certainly called us. 

And I listened. I stood with a vacant stare, tooning out more screams. Only this time, from the outside. 

This time, I could see the faces around me distort in agony. Feel hands grab as my arms and pry me every which way. As if wanting an explanation from me. 

A husk stood next to trembling bodies.

I never moved. I never spoke. Because there was nothing to say. 

It wasn't a sense of grief or anything of the sort because grief implies you'll move on to the next day with the knowledge of loss. As far as I was concerned, the world ended the moment those words left the doctors mouth. 

They explained the complications. They explained what went wrong. 

They didn't get a chance to actually hammer in the final nail. 

*"we did everything we could-"*

By this point? Their wailing had completely drowned her out. 

My eyes did follow the figure under the white sheet. White as snow. 

My Tiffany would sing out of tune. She would leave dishes in the sink that would drive me insane, ironically she hated a messy space. We'd watch terrible 80's movies and talk about cheesy romance books she was obsessed with. She had two left feet and a wild mind. She had ambition- grit. The most stubborn woman I'd ever known. 

All of that doesn't begin to describe my Tiffany. 

And she was simply reduced to a body on a gurney. A number to tally- a tragic statistic, a failure in modern medicine. She doesn't move. She doesn't speak. She gets rolled away. A pile of bones and flesh. 

A mind that I adored, dormant. 

And a heart that I inhabited, still. 

Resting, *beat-less*

Our family does ask to see her. When she's stored. 

*They can't allow her to rot.*

*"...so will you be able to spare a moment?"*

I heard a question- because questions still matter. Life is still happening around me. It *hasn't* just stopped.

No, questions still matter- and I needed to answer. 

"...ofcourse", I rasped. 

I'm sure I looked psychotic. Unjustly stoic. 

Truth is, my body wouldn't react. 

I'm not proud of it. But I followed the steps of the medical professional through the hospital- the cries and confusion of my family fading down the hall. 

*They hate me, for sure.*

*I'm responsible aren't I?*

*Maybe Tiffany didn't even want a child. Maybe she did it just for my sake. Maybe... she'd still be ali-.... she'd still be here, if I never asked us to take that step*

I stepped into the elevator. Stood by the doctor. 

"I'm sorry, again", she muttered. 

I nodded. 

*...I'm still supposed to walk out of this hospital. After, whatever she needs me for*

*I have to face the pavement, the clouds, the cars in the highway.*

*I have to make dinner... wash dishes... clean our home... sleep... wake up... eat... breathe...*

*I still have to exist after her. I have to plan her funeral... write words befitting a goodbye. Watch her get lowered, her ravenous soul- long gone, her body trapped in a wooden coffin. I have to watch them throw dirt over the wood. Stop myself from jumping in with her*

"...Sir? This... this way, please."

I'm not sure how long she was standing there. But the elevator had long opened. 

A hallway, untouched by sorrow, revealed to me. A distant light flickers right at the corner. 

"...I'm sorry", I muttered, stepping out. 

"...I understand", she assured. Continuing to lead me. 

Our steps are loud against the tiles. And my phone vibrates every few seconds. 

*It seems everyone and their mother knew what had happened.*

She stopped right in front of a door. No different from the rest, plainly white, regular silver doorknob. 

"Just through here.", she said. 

I nodded.

Her steps once again sounded, retreading the way we came. 

I touched the doorknob, and heard one last phrase.

"...I really am sorry. I'm sure she mean't a lot to you", she comforted.

I nodded.

She was holding back more. 

Her eyes were glossed with the weight of witnessing what she did. And she knew there was nothing anyone could say. 

She walked back into the elevator. 

I entered.

It smelt of pine. 

Probably the large wooden desk at the far end of the office. An engraving too elaborate to even ponder was facing me. It looked as if it was worth more than my entire life. The carpet... the curtains, the backdrop- overlooking the city. 

The man himself. *Everything* in that room looked more valuable than my life, including him.

He didn't pay me immediate attention, still typing away on his laptop. 

And I wasn't in the spirits to announce myself. 

"...oh! Hello there! How rude of me, *have a seat- have a seat!*", he chirped, adjusting his tie, and straightening the papers on his mammoth of a desk.

I wandered over. Took a seat on one of his leather seats. And tried to introduce myself. 

I thought of doing so and that alone was daunting. 

He cleared his throat, offering a hand over his desk. 

I took it. Shook it and acknowledged his awkward grin. 

He had a head of silver hair, although didn't look much older than me. Distinctly blue eyes, an angular nose and strong chin.

He chuckled, "I'm...sure you're not in the best of spirits."

"..."

"Well... uhm... that's what I'm here for!", he declared, right before calming his tone and dawning a serious disposition. 

The type you'd wear during a distant relatives wake. 

You never knew them. But you understand there's a Performance of grief that's expected of you. Of loss. 

"Nothing, could heal you, I'm sure. Nothing I say might bring her back. Tiffany... she was special. Very... very special and deserved a longer life than what she was given", he said. 

And I couldn't swallow the feeling that he was patting his own back over his ability to seem kind. 

"...What am I doing here?", Is what I decided to ask. 

He sighed. 

*Was I supposed to participate in congratulating his behavior?*

"...We...let you down. We can't expect you to walk out with this level of dissatisfaction", he stated. 

Dissatisfaction. 

As if she was a faulty product. 

"...What... number would it take, to make this challenging time easier?", he asked. 

I didn't immediately react. And in the passing seconds, most people would get uncomfortable. He was starting to seem impatient. Strumming his fingers on the desk- fiddling with the keys of his laptop. 

I'm an inconvenience. 

"We never asked for money." I said, "I was under the impression, we owed the hospital"

"You do!", he claimed, "but...you know, not anymore. It's part of our apology."

"...I've never heard of a hospital paying families of patients after a death.", I mumbled, "Not unless they did something-"

"I assure you. We did our jobs as servants of the public, and medical professionals", he interrupted, "it *would* be hard for you to understand at this exact moment, I'm aware-"

"What are you talking about", I asked. Sharp toned and out of patience, "What are you trying to say? I just lost my *wife* goddammit! I have a family to keep together. And right now, they're all waiting for me. So tell me why I'm here, plainly. *Clearly*"

He sighed once again. 

"If you insist.", he muttered, "...Mr Rhodes, your wife didn't make it. But you're aware of this. She died because of your child. It's unimaginable to lose them both. But it's what had to be done"

...

I suck in a shallow breath, "...*had to be done?*"

"You were advised to not have children, yes?"

I nod.

"Well there you go! You had one order. You might have adopted, even a sperm donor would've worked in your particular situation. Afterall, Tiffany wasn't infected. But no, you insisted on the one thing medical professionals insisted against", he rambled. 

"We were tested-"

"The order wasn't, 'we advise you not to have biological children until you're clear', the order was, 'we advise you not to have biological children.' *period*", he insisted. 

My eyes dropped to my lap, and I made a conscious effort at steadying my breaths, "...I don't understand"

"The new strand of Covid, Mr Jones. It... isn't a friend of reproduction. And all we asked of you was a bit of time to fully understand it. Most people listened, what makes *you lot* special?", he complained. 

I listened. 

"We took your child. By extention, we killed your wife", he states, it's blunt and moved-on from immediately, "Because what was in her womb. Whatever it was, was a bio-hazard. *At least.* And at most? What people would assume is God's punishment for human depravity. We couldn't let it out... yet. Her body worked as a type of containment for your child"

"...*took?*"

"*Ofcourse* that's all you heard", he sighs, "You're a father, I'd expect nothing less. Yes, Mr Rhodes, *technically* your child is alive"

*"Where's my babygirl-"*

"You'll see her.", he insisted, "You will. First, we have matters to sort out. Things you must understand"

"I'm not interested I'm understanding anything!", I stood. And it took him off guard, but he quickly regained his composure, "I want my daughter."

"You won't get her regardless. But you'll see her, only if you sit back down, and listen.", he ordered. Completely cold. His veneer of empathy, no longer served him. 

And it ate at my pride but I sat, watching him push a peice of paper towards me, along with a pen, "Non-disclosure agreement. What I tell you, stays here"

"But-"

"Do you want to see your daughter or not?"

I griped the pen, and scribbled my signature on the dotted line, sliding it back to him, "Here. Now say your piece and take me to my daughter"

He nonchalantly filed the document in a folder. It became the latest copy in a mountain of them. 

My stomach churned at the though of me being just another loose end in whatever they're doing in this institution. How my family was just an unfortunate part of their jobs. 

"...did you have a name in mind?", he asked, storing the folder in his drawer.

"Why does that matter?", I bit.

"She's not dead. There was no point in giving her a name when you thought you were gonna have to bury her soon. Now... you know she's still alive, a second chance, name her", He said, typing something on his laptop. 

"...Bella", I whispered. Barely believing the first name that came to mind. 

"...Bella Rhodes...why?", he asked, clearly curious. 

"It was my mother's name. We weren't close but- *why am I telling you this?* Just say what I need to know", I insisted.

He turned his laptop around, showed me the screen. 

And he spoke, but my attention doesn't falter from the glow of the video I'm witnessing. 

It had a friendly, almost salesman tone of voice. Diagrams of human anatomy in an art style reminiscent of tenth grade biology. 

*"So! You've slipped up and had offspring- despite your many warnings against it. It happens more often than you'd think! Believe me"*

The voice said, stock images of happy families flashing across the screen. Cooking in the kitchen, walks in the park.

*"I'm not here to judge you over your blatant disregard over your children's well-being. I'm also not here to tell you that this is most definitely your fault! I'm here to tell you the results of your decision. So sit back, grab a snack, and pay attention!*

My eyes shifted to the man across from me. He wasn't even paying attention- sorting out his own paperwork. 

So I looked back to the screen, now showing the human anatomy.

*"For the last few years, we, as scientists have been scratching our heads over Covid-19. A virus that seemingly mutated about of nowhere. But ultimately we did find a way to counteract it. Vaccinate it. And as nature tends to do, it evolved. Mutated- again! This strand is much more... picky with its victims. We do not know what characteristics make you the most likely to be vulnerable. You. Just. Are."*

"*Now. What exactly happens to your body? Well... we don't know. The virus seems to hide itself pretty well. Blending into your juices as if it was always there. Like your brown eyes or curly hair. It spreads like an STD and it's ultimate affects are more or less not to far from one too. Depending on how you look at it"*

I swallow my building discomfort at the imagery. A pregnant woman with... something inside her. 

That's wasn't a baby. 

*"It stays dormant. But something about your hormones during pregnancy agitate the little bug. And it latches on to the most vulnerable cells in the body. The host's, yes, but more-so the fetuses. It digs into every bit of their DNA and remodels the entire thing! It would be remarkable- if it, you know, didn't create monsters. HERE'S SOME NEAT EXAMPLES!!!"*

I didn't get the chance to close my eyes. Videos flashing I quick succession. And after I saw the first...

-A baby, normal in most ways. But it's face... it's mouth is lined with rows and rows of jagged teeth. It's lips are swollen, curling back into it's whole face. Red and throbbing as the tongue sort of wanders its immediate area. That very tongue is deformed by bumps and is as long as an adult hand, scraping it's face as if having a mind of it's own. The poor thing cries in a drawl- a painful rasp. 

After seeing that? There was no point in covering my eyes for the rest. 

And there was *plenty* more...

*"I'm sure you've seen enough! So. Our job here. It's quite simple really, we do our best to convince the infected to not carry on their now permanently tainted genes. We could just ban them from reproducing, but human rights and all that. Besides- we outlawed abortion years ago. Didn't think that would bite us in the ass, huh? There's not much we can do without causing a panic. Except warn everyone who gains the new strain of Covid. And capture the offspring of those who don't listen"*

I felt hot tears in my eyes. And the screen was a glowing blur at this point. My breaths were ragged. Clawing at my throat.

*"So, best of luck to you! And I am sorry if your bundle of joy ended up with a thirst for human blood. Sucks, I know. Thankfully, we'll deal with the consequences of your completely avoidable actions for you! Have a great day!*

"...So think of it this way", he muttered, closing the laptop, "Your wife didn't make it. On the bright side, neither did your child-"

"I want to see her", I whispered. 

He looked at me with a visible confusion, "*huh...* that's a first. Usually parents take their cheque and go running for the hills after the video."

"I want to see my baby", I repeated. 

Why? I wasn't sure. 

Maybe because I'd lost Tiffany. And Bella was the last piece of her that was still alive? As... twisted as my babygirl may be. I want to see her once. 

"You realize it's not the bodily...quirks that are the problem. It's that these fetuses are actively bloodthirsty", He deadpans. 

"Please just take me to my daughter", I'd plead. 

And for a moment, I swore there was a glimmer of actual empathy in those cold blue eyes of his.

Then he stood, "Fine then. Follow me.", is all he said, walking around his desk then out of his office. 

I followed. Down the hall, into the elevator. 

He didn't press a button. He pressed a certain sequence if then. 

1-91-3-89-6-7

And the elevator reacted. Closing its doors. And going down. 

I sniffled softly, keeping my tears to myself. I guess I'd only had so long until I really started to dawn on me that Tiffany wasn't coming back.

He stood, not acknowledging my quiet whimpers. And I appreciated it. 

I was too weak to be mad. I was too broken to try and attack the man that took everything from me. And he pittied me enough to not watch as I sobbed.

We descend past the ground floor. Past the basement.  The numbers on the panel no longer glowing. 

The ride took about 5 minutes before we reached our floor. And I tried not to think about how deep we were underground. 

The doors opened, and unveiled an entirely normal looking hallway of the hospital. It looked like any other, with the added acception of no windows to be seen. 

"I suggest you don't go exploring", he advised, shrugging off his formal suit. He hung it on a rack right next to the elevator. He then grabbed a white lab coat, throwing it on over his shirt. 

"We won't be held responsible for what happens to you", he warned, nodding towards the lab coats. 

I took the hint, and put one on myself. It was a thick material- oddly so. I suppose it helped with the cold air down there. 

I followed him down the hall. And was wondering why we ignored every door we passed. Until we reached the wall. Plain, not a single remarkable thing about it. And we stood in silence. 

I almost dared to ask what we were looking at. Why were we just standing there? Until the wall slid away without much of a sound. Revealing that the hallway continues behind it. 

An entirely different feeling to the one we'd just passed. 

A harsh blue light shone from the fluorescents. In place of white walls and plain doors, there were glass displays. 

And as we walked. My eyes did sprint from cage to cage. 

I mean, that's what these things were. Cells would be for humans... these creatures.. were of another species. 

Tiny bodies, completely twisted and deformed but not at all defenseless. 

*First cage on my left*
- the fetus was crawling. It's face engraved with a deep sadness. No frown, it would need a mouth to frown and it had no such body part. Blank skin below it's 'nose', which were just two holes on it's face. I wanted to ask what's so bad about that one? Surely it could still live a somewhat normal life? 

*It couldn't.*

It did have a mouth, on it's back. Not visible until it opens, ripping apart it's little body. Ofcourse jaws, and a horrifyingly long tongue that quickly pounded against the glass, aimed at my throat. 

I flinched and kept walking. 

*Second cage on my right*
-It sits on the cold concrete of its cage, it's body faced away from me. It's head fully following me as I walked passed. One of it's legs, *just one*- is stretched to the length of a python. It's knee towering high above the rest of it's body. Stiff, and it's toenails scratching at the floor. It had tunnel vision, on me- and I wondered how on earth it would kill me. Then decided I didn't want to know. 

"You could always turn back", he offered, nonchalant to the reality around us. 

"...I'm here to see my daughter.", I insisted. 

"Why? To traumatize yourself? Do you really want to see what we ripped out of your poor wife? What *you* put in her?", he chastised. 

"She would want me to see our daughter.", I whispered. 

"...she loved you, yes?"

"She did"

We made a few sharp turns. Revealing more fetuses, different states of hunger and decay. Different ways to rip off your flesh, all over their bodies.

"Then she wouldn't want something like that for you. She would never wish years of sleepless nights on you. Eternal solitude from the weight of nobody understanding. No therapist, no family, no friend, no lover. Nobody will understand how it feels to see your child in this state. Tiffany... wouldn't wish that apon you.", he reasoned. 

And I had no response worthy of countering it. So I just continued to walk behind him. 

"Suit yourself", he sighed, "and enjoy the person you are now.", he muttered as we reached a door. One of the only ones down here, "Because you'll leave here a different man."

"...why is Bella in this room?", I asked. 

"Because... we're still assessing just how dangerous she is. What containment might be necessary for her. If she's harmless enough for this floor, or if we need to place her on the lower levels"

"*Lower levels?*"

"A *lot* of you couldn't keep it in your damn pants.", he said under his breath, annoyed. 

"Do not interrupt the doctors. You're here to *see* your daughter. Nothing more", is te last thing he said, oping the door. 

We stepped in. And I immediately felt my fists clench. Adrenaline once again flooding my veins at the sight. 

The room was coated in streaks of red. Bodies laid in awkward positions.

A gurney tipped over at the center of the carnage. 

I accepted it damn quickly- that Bella is not my innocent little girl. She's something else entirely. And I needed to live for my wife's family. For what's left of mine. They couldn't lose us both in one day.

I'm not sure what was going through his head. But I was deciding what we were up against. 

She's obviously free...

My eyes go from one corpse to the next. How one had it's head in it's own hands, propped up against the wall... it was on purpose. 

*She's smart.*

The next few corpses were laid on their back, their innards completely scattered around them in red ropes. With almost the exact same technique. 

*She can kill multiple people at once. And she efficient.*

A body in the corner had a long red streak trailing from the roof right down to it. Head also severed. 

He was picked up, injured mid air, and slid down. 

*she's strong...really strong*

From everything around us. *she's sadistic, and merciless... clearly enjoys the hunt*

"Stay calm.", he muttered, walking to a cabinet, swinging it open. A black metal safe inside. Which he must've had the code memorized because he opened it with ease, pulling out a gun.

"...you're gonna... *you're not gonna kill her*", I said.

He raised an eyebrow, "her or us? We can't all make it out of here."

"We can try", I took a step towards him.

"She somehow overtook the anesthesia in her system. Enough to keep dozens of elephants asleep for days on end. And she woke up. Killed everyone here in a matter of minutes, We can't contain something like that!", he insisted. 

"...she's my baby", I muttered.

"Everyone here also had children. They also deserved to live. Your child, took them away from their families- *your choice* did this. I'm not putting your desires over anyone else's life", he said as he inspected his weapon. 

"Stop acting like this is our fault!", I shouted. Feeling my blood bubble at his relentless accusations, "All we wanted was a damn family! Not this. I lost Tiffany today. Now... now I'm losing Bella and you're acting as if-"

"You're to blame?", he interrupted, taking a step towards me, "you *are* Mr Rhodes."

His eyes were just as certain as mine.

"Do you want to know something I preferred to keep from you? Something that wasn't in that damn video?", he asked, "I'll tell ya. This strand of the virus, it doesn't infect women. Men are it's primary carrier's. Ironically... men are the only ones who walk away unscathed.", he seethed, "you had *one job*... don't get your wife pregnant"

"If you had just told us-"

"You wouldn't have believed us. We've tried. We've tried every method at stopping you people from having kids. It never works. And I always end up having to explain to men like you, why your wives are now gone. Always beating around the damn bush- using kid gloves like you didn't sign your wives death warrents! You selfish bastards do this to yourselves! You are to blame. You killed Tiffany.", he stated. 

I swallowed deeply. Forcing tears to not show themselves.

"Now. I'll get us out of here. And if I have to kill Bella? I will", he walked past me.

And I took once last glance at the room. How the joy of my life somehow did it. And I thought about how I was about to watch that joy be ripped from me all over aga-

*Gunshot* 

Several of them in quick succession. And my legs carried me to the chaos without another thought. 

The peice of metal slid across the tiles. Right to my feet. The walls were already marked with red. And the man was hanging off of the ground. 

Held up by an arm with it's body hidden just around the corner. It's flesh hanging off it's thin bones, dangling with his movements in meaty shreds. It's skin- or what was left of it, was red and irritated. But certainly- it had a chilling amount of strength. 

His legs weakly tried to sway, his hand pried at the grip around his torso. Long...long fingers completely wrapped around him, the fingertips slowly sinking into his chest with an ease that made my own stomach squirm.

He screamed. Louder and louder. 

And the hand kept him in place. As if wanting me to observe his torture. 

*"God! Shoot it! Please!*", he begged. Desperately pounding at the fingers with his fist. And his assaults went unnoticed. 

I trembled. Grabbing the gun at my feet and my quivering dulled my aim. 

It's fingertips sunk deeper, and slowly started parting. As if working with dough. His chest- the insides slowly showed. Blood dripped on his expensive suit. And on the floor. I could see intestines squirming together, taking up odd spaces, and hanging out like sausage links. And I wondered how he was still conscious. 

*"Kill it! Kill me! Do something! For the love of Christ!*", he screamed.

And so I did. I fired several bullets. Squeezed the trigger out of pure fear and had no perception of my own aim. A few hit the wall, a few hit the tiles, a few hit the fingers  a few must've hit him. And then...

*Click, click, click*

The gun was out of amo. 

And as if on que, the hand released it's grip and he fell to the ground with his butchered chest. Taking his last ragged breaths. 

I crept towards him. And I could see his exposed, pink, plump lungs take their last few pumps of air. 

I knelt there for a few minutes. 

Not out of guilt- he killed Tiffany. 

More-so understanding that I'll probably meet a similar fate. And giving myself a moment or two to accept that inevitably.

I stood back up. And walked the way we came. 

Knowing full well that Bella was somewhere that way- probably blocking the exit. 

Still I walked to her. 

*Tiffany died by the hands of strangers. I'd die by the hands of my little girl*

I could hear a chuckle. The type you'd expect while flying an aeroplane over your child's head. Calling them the cutest little thing to ever exist. Quiet coughs that you'd hear if you wrapped them in a blanket, swaying near a fire. Ignoring the storm outside that's upset them. 

Bella sounded precious.

And as I made my last turn- *Bella looked precious*

A beautifully dark skin tone- almost matching her mother's. She blinked at me, and I returned the action. 

She was sat on the cold floor. She wasn't clothed yet, she must've been cold- but showed no signs of it. She glanced at the other cages. She glanced at me and tilted her head. Made a sound that any baby would make in an attempt to speak. 

I walked to her, catching climpses of the cages I passed- and how the little prisoners hid most of their more frightening features. How they crawled and sat and wailed as if no different from any other child on the surface. 

*I broke my heart that I knew this wasn't true.*

A few steps from Bella, I look into the eyes of the last love of my life. 

"...H-hey babygirl", I whispered. Not knowing what death wish had take over me. 

I knelt, I reached for her. And she let me cradle her in my arms. 

She was covered in blood, but her skin was soft to the touch. She gently kicked and gripped in my grasp.

I was crying. She was completely calm. And that irony wasn't lost on me. 

I couldn't take her. I knew that. 

But for a moment- for a flicker in her honey brown eyes, I saw Tiffany holding her all the same. I saw her upset with me over being stuck in traffic. Her and I bargaining over diaper duty. I'd take up even more of the house work so she could focus on raising our happiness- and I'd take over when the little one wears her out. 

Our Bella would be a handful... I knew it. 

I'd never get the chance to have it. Complain about it. To miss it once she was grown and gone... 

I let out a breath. And lowered her to the cold floor. 

"...Bella... I... can't take you. You're...dangerous", I whispered, "And...it's- it's not your fault baby... it's mine."

She blinked at me. 

"...You'll... be just fine... you...", I notice the streak of blood leading right to her, "...You don't need me. Not to p-protect you, that's for sure". 

She couldn't understand me. She chuckled just out of being entertained by daddy talking in a funny voice. 

A trembling, weak voice. 

"...I have to look out for your cousins... for everyone in our family... I can't let you hurt them... I- I know it's selfish baby...I know... so please forgive me."

I didn't have any reason to think she'd let me live. That she'd allow me to walk to that elevator, watch the doors close as her form faulted, a few fingertips peaking from her little lips. 

I rode the elevator up. For five long minutes. Watching the buttons eventually started to glow, until I reached the ground floor. 

I wandered the hospital- right out of the doors. Into the parking-lot where the rain had started to pour. 

I sat in traffic. Watched as some moron switched lanes and caused more chaos. 

I parked in my front yard. Walked into my home. 

*I slept.*

*I woke.*

*I slept.*

*I woke.*

*I cleaned the house. Took out the trash. Trimmed the lawn. And went to work.*

*I made funeral arrangements. I waked Tiffany's body get lowered.*

*I didn't jump in.*

*I read the cheesy books on Tiffany's nightstand.*

*I watched the horrible 80's movies I loved once.*

*I talked with colleagues, finished spreadsheet after spreadsheet.*

*I answered questions- because questions still mattered.*

*Life went on.*

*The world went on.*

*So I had to do the same.*

*Somehow. I had to be okay*
