Hello, I am Detective Anderson with the unit of the unexplainable. Me and my unit were called in to investigate an occurrence of strange happenings around this one particular villiage. More specifically its that anyone who lives in this particular house always seem to die the same way. 

I was taking a look over through the rooms trying to find anything odd or strange the police may have missed and I ended up finding this poorly scribbled letter just wedged under a desk. The letter read....:

(Start of letter)
Hello, my name is not important. I've been working hard to find the energy to write this letter and hope it finds its way to you. If you found this you have either moved in or you are in some kind of law enforcement. Please beleive me when I explain everything that's happened. Here's how it all went down.

It had been such a long day at work, a 15 hour shift that had felt like 24. I was so tired, all I wanted to do was watch my TV and fall asleep to the back ground noise and so that's what I did.

I flopped all my weight onto the sofa beneath me and grabbed at the remote, pressed the on button and closed my eyes.

I awoke at some time around 2am, the TV was glitching and replaying the same part of a food delivery app add over and over "Did somebody say just eat? Did somebody say just eat? Did somebody say just eat?" It was relentless and the remote wasn't working at all.

I froze in place...something felt off all of a sudden, I looked down my hallway to a door by my bedroom, that door was never there before. I had never seen that door in my 5 years of living here and it was wide open. 

My eyes darted around my apartment, barely lit by the dim light emitting from the obnoxiously orange ad still replaying on the TV. My eyes locked on to a particularly dark corner in my kitchen that I could see from my living room because the only thing separating the 2 was a kitchen island. 

The dark corner seemed to almost sway, and suddenly an arm stuck out, then another, held straight up into the air...it waved with both hands, what the fuck it waved.

I darted for my bedroom and slammed the door shut trying everything to ignore the sound of the pattering hands and feet on my wooden floors closing in behind me. My tired legs carried me to my closet and I curled into a ball behind the hanging coats in the corner. 

It felt like it had been hours, until I heard the creature rattle my bedroom door handle, fuck I forgot to lock it. It slowly swung open and I heard slow and careful creeks approach the closet doors.

This time the closet doors were violently ripped open and I heard high pitched breathing, like that was it's way of communicating. After a few seconds the doors closed again and I relaxed after another few minutes of being in the silent closet....

Until I heard a shuffle on the other side of the closet, my body tensed up instantly and my breath hilted in my throat. I didn't even hear it enter, not a sound. This thing could move so silently that it feels like the times it made noise was to scare me on purpose. 

The shuffling got closer until it came to a complete stop again and in a matter of seconds the coats covering me were ripped away to reveal a pair of red glowing eyes just inches away from my face, staring at me, this creature had the widest smile painted on its face, it looked painful and strained and its teeth were jagged and sharp, even in the dark i could see that they had a yellow tint to them.

It said in the lowest voice ive ever heard "did somebody say just eat?" And then it just stared, like it was waiting for a reply. It took all of my mental strength to say "what do you want?" 
It's smile dropped instantly into a frown and was obviously displeased with my reply. It simply stood up and walked out of the closet.

I thought it would leave until I heard a raspy voice yell from my hallway "Trevor! Stop playing with your food and bring him to me will ya' bud?"

Food? Food!?! This whole time I was just being toyed with, my fate had been sealed long before I woke up, I was terrified. 

The thing reached back into the closet, grabbed my ankle and started dragging me out, despite its bone like stricture and a clear sign of malnutrition it had an inhuman amount of strength. My ankle snapped just from him gripping it, it wasn't even phased by my guttural screaming or pleading for it to let me go. 

It only stopped when it arrived to the feet of the guy who spoke earlier, he was an old looking dude but well looked after, a big contrast from his skeleton like friend. He wore black, thin framed glases and held a book to his side. The main thing I noticed though was the long black trench coat he wore witch had a purposefully obvious knife handle sticking out of his left pocket.

"Fast or slow?" He muttered.
I was confused at the question, mainly due to the lack of context behind it. I replied back with some confused noise because I simply couldn't bring myself to utter a word.

"Ugh do I really have to elaborate? Do you want to die fast or slow?" He side eyed the humanoid creature because he had started to sniff me and poke at my mouth, "Trevor, side!" He hissed, and it obliged, scuttling to heal by the man's side like and obedient dog.
"I'm sorry?" I managed to force out of my throat, no doubt failing to hide any hint of fear.

"I'm not going to repeat myself, you heard me. You aren't getting out of here alive so either you can die slowly and painfully while I harvest your organs or I can shoot you in the head and get it done quickly, no pain. Good boy Trevor" 

The man opened up his trench coat, revealing multiple ziplock bags filled with teeth lining the inside, I almost gagged as he retrieved one and threw it to the floor.
Trevor, the thing, grabbed it off the floor and rammed it into his mouth, I could hear the crunches of the tooth, it made me feel sick.

The man huffed at me, clearly loosing patience and it made me panic, I scrambled to my knees and blurted "Fast!! Please...please just shoot me and get it over with" 

Tears pricked at my eyes as the man reached into the inside pocket of his coat and pulled out a gun, I closed my eyes and was just relieved that I wouldn't have to feel any pain from this. 

The man said in a hushed tone "Trevor, just eat" before he pulled the trigger. Since then I have been trapped in this house as a spirit. Forced to stare at the door the new renters still haven't seemed to notice, it's always open. Sometimes I think I can see a pair of red glowing eyes staring back.

I've been working towards focusing my energy in order to manipulate things in your realm. 
(End of letter)

Ever since reading this letter I've been unable to sleep. Obviously it's hard to convince the others in my unit that this is the real deal, the reason we are a unit in the first place. Our head detective told me he'd think about investigating it further but his tone didn't make me feel hopeful.

I'll do my best to keep you updated,
Detective Anderson.
