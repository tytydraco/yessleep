Well, we’re stuck on the other side again. This isn’t a super unusual occurrence, but it’s always the most annoying way to spend our day. Luckily, we get paid overtime for these occasions, but it still takes way too much time and effort to get back to our reality.

&#x200B;

I told you about the first breach in open hours I experienced in my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10g4sge/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_most_of_the_time_the/), so since I find myself here again, I’ll tell you about the very first time I got stuck on the other side. It wasn’t too long after my first breach, maybe two weeks, so I was still relatively new to all of this.

&#x200B;

When I showed up for my shift that day, I already felt something was off. The staircase light was flickering a bit, which doesn’t seem unusual, but the slight flashing made my head spin more than it should. I was already on high alert, and stepping into the back office, I saw Daniel and Patrick whispering to each other. They quickly stopped when they noticed me, and Daniel offered me his fakest smile.

&#x200B;

“Good morning!”

&#x200B;

“What’s going on? Something feels off today.”

&#x200B;

He sighed and glanced at Patrick.

&#x200B;

“Well, she obviously knows,” Patrick said, nodding to me. “You might as well just tell her.”

&#x200B;

“Tell me what?”

&#x200B;

Daniel stood up and motioned for me to take his seat. “Every now and then, the store has to sort of… *reset itself.* It’s not easy for this building to be constantly guarding itself and us, so sometimes it needs to recharge in its natural environment. It seems like today is going to be one of those days.”

&#x200B;

I glanced at Patrick, who shrugged, pulled out his phone, and shoved in his earbuds.

&#x200B;

“So what does that mean exactly?” I asked Daniel, who looked annoyed with Patrick. “What is its ‘natural environment’?”

&#x200B;

“It means today we will be in its reality while it cools down. It really isn’t too bad, and we won’t have to deal with any clients. In our reality, we will just look like an empty store. I don’t know how it works exactly, but in the 5 years I’ve been here, none of our clients, custom or otherwise, have ever mentioned us being gone during this time. I suppose the building puts up blinders of some sort, but who knows. Either way, today we will be cleaning the store, and when the time comes, we will guide the building back.”

&#x200B;

With that, he walked away. I, as usual, had a million questions. How exactly does the building guard us? How does no one notice our business is missing? Won’t our appointments be wondering where we are? Also, what the fuck is the building’s reality?? But, as usual, I decided I didn’t want to ask too many questions.

&#x200B;

I followed Daniel to the floor with our cleaning bucket and broom just as my other coworker, Samuel, arrived.

&#x200B;

I haven’t spoken about Samuel yet, so I feel like I should explain why. Samuel is… interesting, to say the least. He is seven feet tall (yes, I actually measured him one day), extremely well built, and has purple eyes. Daniel and Patrick assure me he is human, but I think they’re lying to me. Not necessarily because of his eyes, since I know there is a genetic mutation that gives people purple eyes, but because he really doesn’t show a whole lot of emotions, and for the entire year I’ve been here, the only thing I know about him is that he loves tea. That’s it.

&#x200B;

Despite his lack of personal connections, he is the best salesman I have ever met. He outsells everyone in our store combined during open hours, and during customs, he can calm the rowdiest of clients, while still upselling them to more expensive fabrics. He once convinced a faerie to *give me my name back*. This was during one of my first custom fittings when I wasn’t super aware of how most of these creatures work, but to this day, it is still the craziest thing I’ve ever seen. I’m convinced he is the only reason this store is still in business.

&#x200B;

He’s the kind of guy that never loses his cool. So when he walked in on this day and instantly panicked, I knew this wasn’t going to be as simple as Daniel had made it seem.

&#x200B;

“Sam, it’s alright. You know how this works, we'll spend the day cleaning and be out of here before you know it. If you want, you can even organize the fabrics in the back so you don’t have to be by the windows,” Daniel said, immediately noticing Samuel’s anxiety.

&#x200B;

“Today of all days? Really? I’m leaving.”

&#x200B;

“Sam, we’re already open, you know you can’t-”

&#x200B;

Before Daniel could stop him, Sam opened up the staircase door, revealing what I can only describe as a sea of souls. The thick, indigo liquid stretched out as far as I could see, and I swear instead of a splashing sound, the waves screamed. The sky in this world was deep red, and although brightly lit, I couldn’t find a light source. It seemed like the light was coming from the water. I suddenly felt the entire building shift, and realized we were floating.

&#x200B;

I felt myself getting nauseous, both from the motion and what I had just seen, and ran to the bathroom before I made another mess for us to clean up. Thankfully, the water in the toilet and sink was still regular, clear water. I sat on the bathroom floor and pulled out my phone to calm myself, and I noticed we still had a wifi connection. I considered asking how this was possible, but I decided I didn’t want to know. It was clear that none of this was ever going to make sense to me, so I washed myself up and went back to the floor to find Daniel and Patrick mopping.

&#x200B;

“You good?” Patrick asked, not even looking up.

&#x200B;

“Yeah, sorry, just motion sickness,” I lied, but judging by his smirk, he knew better. “Where’s Sam?”

&#x200B;

“In the back. He hates when this happens. It’s really not so bad, plus we get overtime, *right Daniel*?” he said pointedly, and Daniel rolled his eyes.

&#x200B;

“Yeah, yeah, you’ll get your overtime. Why don’t you start dusting down the mannequins, Harper? We’ll take care of the floor.”

&#x200B;

I went and grabbed  the duster, but before I went back out to start on the mannequins, I realized something: Sam wasn’t there. I quickly checked the office, breakroom, and bathroom, but he was nowhere to be found.

&#x200B;

“Sam’s gone,” I announced, starting to feel a panic rising in my chest.

&#x200B;

“He’s probably in the bathroom,” Patrick said, clearly unaffected by this news.

&#x200B;

“He’s not, I checked. And he isn’t in the office or breakroom. What if he left? Do we have to go out there and look for him?”

&#x200B;

Patrick laughed a bit at this, and Daniel shot him a look.

&#x200B;

“I’m sure he’s around here somewhere, Harper,” Daniel tried to reassure me.

&#x200B;

“Okay but where?? This store is tiny, and if he isn’t in the back or on the floor-”

&#x200B;

“He said it’s fine. Don’t worry about it. Just start dusting, alright?” Patrick snapped, earning another harsh look from Daniel. He mumbled an apology to me, but it didn’t matter. It was clear this was yet another thing I didn’t need to know, so I moved on.

&#x200B;

After about three hours of cleaning, the entire place was sparkling. We were all sitting on the couch chatting, when I heard a rattling in the ceiling.

&#x200B;

“What was that?”

&#x200B;

Patrick and Daniel glanced at each other before Daniel said, “Probably just the building. It goes through a lot during this shift, but don’t worry. She’ll hold.”

&#x200B;

With that, he stood up and started explaining closing procedures for days like this. Basically, how to get back to our reality.

&#x200B;

“We have to check that all the windows and doors are secured, the curtains are drawn, and there are no leaks anywhere on the floor. If you find a leak, tell me immediately, as I will need to contact corporate for further instructions. We’ll each have to sit alone in the middle of the room, silently, for five minutes. If you hear any voices during this time, whether you recognize them or not, let me know and I will contact corporate. *Please tell me if you hear voices*. They might try to convince you not to tell me, or will even impersonate me, but I promise you I will not be talking.”

&#x200B;

This statement didn’t really surprise me, as I deal with weird shit everyday, but the voices impersonating Daniel was shocking. We have plenty of custom clients who visit in the form of someone we know, trying to confuse us or just generally mess with us, but never as Daniel. Up until then I always assumed, as the manager, he was sort of untouchable to these other worldly beings, but I guess in this other dimension, no one is off limits.

&#x200B;

We began our check of the building, and as I was about to open the curtains to check the windows, Patrick stopped me.

&#x200B;

“Wait, let me do that.”

&#x200B;

“Why?”

&#x200B;

“You’re not going to like what you see.”

&#x200B;

“You don’t have to protect me, Patrick, I’m a big girl,” I said mockingly, before turning and opening the curtains.

&#x200B;

I was greeted with an underwater view of the sea of souls. I could see hundreds of thousands of faces, screaming. They noticed me quickly and began swimming towards the window, banging viciously and screaming for help. Before Patrick could shut the curtains, I saw the face of the man Richard had eaten during my first breach of open hours. His face was stretched to a length unimaginable, and it could be in my mind, but I swear he recognized me for a moment.

&#x200B;

I didn’t even realize I was screaming until Patrick hugged me. I instantly started sobbing.

&#x200B;

“I’m so sorry, I should have listened, I didn’t know-”

&#x200B;

“It’s okay, you’re okay,” he said softly.

&#x200B;

He led me to the back office and sat me down.

&#x200B;

“Look. This is just another day on the job. There is nothing you could have done to save those people. This is the way it works, and the only thing we can do is try to keep as many people out of this place as possible. You are very good at your job, okay? Don’t let this break you.”

&#x200B;

This was the kindest thing Patrick had ever said to me, and it seemed like he realized it too, as he quickly got up and walked away. I was still shaking, but I heard a sound from the air vent above me. I looked up, and I swear, for a split second, I saw purple eyes staring back at me. As soon as I noticed them, they quickly disappeared, and I heard the same rattling I had heard earlier.

&#x200B;

I didn’t have time to process this before Daniel poked his head into the office.

&#x200B;

“You okay?”

&#x200B;

I nodded silently.

&#x200B;

“It’s time for your five minutes. Let’s get this done so we can go home.”

&#x200B;

I got up and followed him out to the floor. He had drawn a circle with salt in the middle of the room, and motioned for me to sit.

&#x200B;

“Remember, if you hear any voices at all, you need to tell me.”

&#x200B;

I sat there for my five minutes, heart racing, but thankfully that was the only sound I heard. When Daniel touched my back, I nearly jumped out of my skin.

&#x200B;

“Time’s up! Hear anything?”

&#x200B;

“Not at all.”

&#x200B;

He looked at me suspiciously for a moment.

&#x200B;

“Do you really think I wouldn’t have screamed if I heard someone talking to me?”

&#x200B;

“Fair enough,” he said, and helped me back to my feet. “Sam, you’re up.”

&#x200B;

Sam came silently strolling out, glancing at me briefly before sitting in the circle. Daniel and I walked to the back and waited with Patrick silently in the office. When the timer went off, all three of us came back to the floor.

&#x200B;

“Did you hear anything?”

&#x200B;

Sam shook his head, and Daniel didn’t ask any further questions.

&#x200B;

“Okay, we’re ready to go.”

&#x200B;

“Wait, what do we do now?” I asked, seeming to be the only one confused.

&#x200B;

“We go home,” Sam said, already heading to the door.

&#x200B;

“Wait don’t-”

&#x200B;

I stopped as he opened the door. Our regular staircase was back. There was no sign of the sea of souls, or even any trace that it had been there. I had the urge to open the curtains to make sure it was safe, but after a reassuring nod from Daniel, I hesitantly followed Sam down the stairs.

&#x200B;

I’ve never been so happy to see sunlight. I couldn’t believe we were actually back, and judging by the people walking past, they had no idea our building was just gone. I said my goodbyes to the guys, and got on the bus home.

&#x200B;

I’ve experienced 3 more trips to the other side in my year working here. Each time has been the same, except for today.

&#x200B;

Today, I heard voices during my five minutes. Lots of voices.

&#x200B;

I don’t know how long we’ll be stuck here, but I’ll give you an update when I can.
