As the title should read, it would seem like my departure from this world is near. I debated for a long while on how to handle this. I am filled with the normal sorts of fears and concerns about dying, however I may have an additional clue as to what will happen as well as additional duties to take care of before I die. And it’s because of these that I write this now. 

Simply put, I have a thing in my basement that won't die and cannot be left alone. And I’m afraid what will happen after I pass. What it will do and how long until it escapes.

Now I know this may all sound like the last thoughts of a demented dying man- to which I would say I am dying but I am completely sound of mind. It may help to go back to when I first confronted the thing.  I was born and bred in Bellford, Mississippi. I’m 86 now and it was in fact when I was 8 years old that I met it. My sister and I had been playing outside, her by the vegetable garden and me around the toolshed in the backyard where my Pa had badgered me to stay away. If only I had listened, I know not how differently my life would have turned out. But I was collecting rolly-pollies, when I found a claw hammer seated neatly in the grass in front of the locked shed. 

To be totally correct I heard it before I ever saw it. I heard, in a way, a faint whisper in my ear, but more like in my mind itself. When I looked up searching for the speaker I came eye to terrible eye with it. It stood staring at me, half hidden by the edge of the shed. Roughly human, and I mean *roughly*, Its arms and legs proportions seemed wrong and unsettling, and it had an unusual rough texture across all its skin and its awful awful face was wreathed in bony protrusions, maybe horns? If you wanted to call it a demon, ghoul, monster, or something unnamed yet, you certainly could as it suits your understanding of such a thing. But it was horrible.

But curiously, as it spoke, none of the horror seemed to register in my mind. In fact I was far more concerned about what it was saying. As best as my mind can recall, at that moment I hardly recognized words being said to me, just a train of thought. A very convincing train of thought that guided me to pick up the hammer, walk into the vegetable garden and begin to bludgeon my sister. 

Fortunately, I was a weak young boy and my mother heard the awful sounds soon enough to intervene. My sister lived. However a much abbreviated life, less than half of what I’ve lived so far. And through its entirety, she was deeply handicapped physically and mentally, never getting a moment where she didn’t require support. She told me once, decades ago that she forgave me. But I don’t know if she truly knew what she was saying when she said it. 

On that day it was after my mother shook me to sense that what I had done came crashing onto me and the words that had flowed so smoothly, like chocolate through my mind, came to manifest in their vulgarity and brutality. Suddenly, I was overwhelmed with these words, some I had never heard before screaming around in my head. 

I was taken to a psychiatric ward for many months. Initially I insisted on the entity that I recalled looking at me from around the corner of the house in the moments where my mother clutched my bleeding sister and carried her into the house and stood there in the garden. It might just be an addition made over time, but I can picture it waving to me. Eventually I abandoned my insistence so I could be released. 

It would be many years later when I was 24, now living in Braxton, Missouri. When I was driving along a county road past a children’s party in a park when I saw it again. It would seem that some landscaping was being done nearby and a gardener’s shears had found itself in a little secluded spot just past the treeline around the park. It was this dirt road that gave me this fortunate angle. I saw the thing, just tucked behind a tree beckoning to a young girl who had strayed from the party. 

I parked my car as quietly and quickly as I could before I skulked over. It had begun its whispers. She stood there as still as the trees around her, frozen in trance. One thing I learned then and has continued to be true is that this thing is greedy and lustful for pain and violence beyond all else. It is only because of this weakness that it was distracted and careless enough for me to get behind it. 

Amongst the landscaping tools I had spied a sledgehammer and snatched it up.. As I approached I got a better view of it. I learned that it stands above seven feet in height in this form. It bends its spine in a grotesque manner to be at nearly head height with its prey. But it was busy weaving its curse on her which gave me my opportunity. To note too, if you aren’t its target you can hear the words it speaks clearly. And I nearly blew my chance when I heard the horrific things it was instructing the girl to do. I remained hardened and brought the sledgehammer down on its head. I followed that with a couple more swings immediately before inspecting my work. 

I noticed that the girl began swaying and seemed as if waking up from a dream. So to spare her I was able to pivot out of sight behind the trees, and with the creature lying on the ground when she woke she seemed to only wonder why she was so far away from the party and as “cake” was called she seemed to forget the episode completely and ran off. 

As soon as I judged she was out of earshot I looked back down at my foe and caught it as it finished turning its head to face me. Its eyes met mine once again. I swung down on it again and again only stopping when I was exhausted having quickly sweat through my clothes in that Missouri heat. With horror I learned the second thing I know about it, and that which is the root of all our problems: its otherworldly durability. 

Despite what must have counted in the dozens of swings with the sledgehammer I had caved in about half of its head, the other half looking nearly unscathed, and its grin still intact. From then I knew my problems would not be solved so easily. 

I lugged that heavy monstrosity into my car and took it home. When I had arrived the damage was about half healed, its skull seemed to reinflate and push much of its exterior back into place. I went at it again with the sledgehammer, having exhausted myself and only reaching barely more damage than before. But I got it into my house and into my basement.

The basement it remains in today, at this very moment, that many years later. Since then I learned how to be more efficient and careful. A huge step was switching to a heavy splitting maul. Tools with a more focused spot of impact do more damage than purely blunt bludgeoning. It takes it longer to heal. 

Additionally, on the other end, blades also do little damage. A thin stab or cut heals basically the fastest and even a resilient blade blunts far too quickly on its flesh to be helpful. The key is separation. Splitting the skull seems to do the most damage and take it the longest to heal. 

Restraint is another crucial part. I procured one of those old fashioned heavy metal dental chairs, this one had thick metal arms connected to it. It’s bound to that chair now with clamps, handcuffs, and soldered metal bands. The next thing you need to know about it is it is immensely strong. I had scars on my face, arms, and chest when one of its arms got loose. It had a genuine police handcuff attached to its right arm and it simply pulled against it and snapped the chain like a rubberband. This also leads us to the next lesson. 

It’s extremely smart too. It had the opportunity to break the handcuff on that hand for maybe hours, but it waited until I was within arm’s reach to make its move. It tore at me and wounded me badly, before I was able to strike it down with the maul. 

Restraint and damage. That is the name of the game. Overall, it’s a schedule of checking its restraints and dealing enough damage to keep it healing continuously. You never want it to be healed enough that it's capable of thinking clearly or talking. Every day you must split its skull. It’s by far the most efficient way. I do it at 8 in the morning and evening. I used to do it three times a day, including immediately before and after I slept up to 8 hours at night. Back then I set three alarms for each session to make sure. 

After a while the schedule became more familiar to me than speaking. It’s additionally difficult because it can heal at differing speeds (I’m still unsure if this is by its own control or not) so it’s key to damage it regularly. For the especially speedy recoveries that’s when maintaining the restraints pays off.  Anyways, I’m old now and the physical toll is getting to me. 

Years ago I sprained my back swinging the maul. I fell to the ground in pain. And while its skull was still split and it remained inert I swear I heard a giggle as I grunted and wept in agony. I fear that it may be aware and cognitive way earlier in its healing than it portrays.

After that I jury rigged this pulley system where you turn a crank to raise the maul head, now with a heavy iron weight welded to the back of it. When it's at its apex you pull a small cord attached to it and it falls straight down onto its head. I won’t waste too much time describing it. I’m sure you'll find it very intuitive to set up.

And yes I have tried to kill it for good. There simply isn’t a way. If you can find a way my spirit will rest easier, because I am aware of none. To start with the obvious; physical damage doesn’t have lasting effects, it's never been fed or given water but clearly that has not weakened it. I’ve also burned it, which truly does nothing whatsoever and it just laughed at me. 

I’ve looked to the faiths and thrown holy water and touched it with every holy symbol I could get my hands on and nothing has any effect on it at all. Hand saws are useless, I’ve used power saws but they struggle to get through an inch of flesh before its teeth are filed down to nubs and a new blade is needed. Acids, bases, poisons, and toxic gasses are useless. It can’t drown or asphyxiate. Over the many many years if there’s a way you can think of I have thought of it. Yet it persists. 

I must warn you of its cruelty, and why it is so important that it remains damaged beyond function for as long as you can maintain it. For one, it loves to whistle. Early on, whenever it could heal enough to function I would find it silently pulling and wearing down the restraints. I would subdue it, then repair and reinforce its restraints again. I think over time it learned that it couldn’t do enough damage to escape in the little time before I returned. So it took to whistling to me. 

I don’t know how it knows it but it’s the song my mom sang to my sister and I when we were children. It may just be my mind responding to some abhorrent curse it spits from its teeth. Or perhaps it's seen into my mind and it found this song that I haven’t heard in so many decades. Similarly, sometimes it chooses to speak in the voice of someone you love. For me, it’s either my sister, mother, or my Pa. But those are the only people I’ve ever loved so I don’t know who it’s capable of mimicking to you, or what you may hear or even see. And I apologize to you for this especially.  

When I die someone will have to take this job for me. I would entrust it to a family member but with this burden I never was able to pursue long relationships in my life. A couple foolish times in my youth I made some halfhearted doomed attempts, but after all, I couldn't stay away longer than 8 hours at a time. And every minute past I would be worrying what was happening in my basement. And what happens if I was to bring someone to my home? After some time I would have to kick them out or disappear for a while to split its skull. They would have to eventually notice my peculiarity and then what? There’s questions I can’t answer. I can never show them, never share it with anyone. I can’t expect them to understand- to not be terrified of me. So I took this burden on in solitude. And that unfortunately is the greatest price I must ask of you. You will have to live a life of isolation and simplicity. No dinner parties, no bringing partners home, no sounds of little ones running. It will be you, it, and the sound of a splitting skull, repeatedly, every single day. And once you take it on you cannot share it. Keep it hidden, keep it quiet. It will be yours to bear alone, as it was mine. And your life will be lonely and your death will be quiet. That’s truly what I am asking you, beyond all the physical and emotional turmoil it will bring you directly, it is the life and loneliness that you will have to accept. 

I am hoping that someone out there will be willing to accept this and live in silence as I have up until this point. Maybe you’ll fare better than I and be able to find a lasting solution. But if not, do your best to shoulder it, be gentle with yourself, and when your time comes like mine nearly has, pass it on to the next. 

If you choose to accept this, come to my house. I live in Braxford, Missouri. Come here and ask any old feller for directions to the Debson house behind the old grain mill. If I am still alive I will greet you and show you everything and prepare the handoff for when I die.

If I am already dead; the spare key is under the mat. There will be a sticky note on my computer with my login information. When you have accepted this responsibility, sign onto this account and delete this story so no more have to know than necessary. If this story is still up then the job is still open. Just hopefully I’m not dead for too long before someone takes the torch. If I am and it has regenerated and succeeded in its attempts to escape; then pray for everyone.
