I woke up in the morning feeling exhausted, and the moment I opened my eyes, an uncomfortable sensation seized my body. As if thousands of flies were trapped beneath my skin, it itched — a maddening, psychologically torturous feeling. I stopped right there to think.

"Was it something I ate yesterday?" That was my first thought, but it couldn’t be; I'd vomited up my entire dinner.  
"Maybe some fabric I wore?"

With several possibilities running through my mind and none of them putting an end to it, I ended up spending almost the whole morning lying on that old bed, because even the slightest movement of my frail body felt suffocating, unbearable.

It wasn’t long before my boss called, giving me the same lecture as always — that I was irresponsible, that other girls would kill to be in my position, and a bunch of other crap like that. So, against my will, I got up and got ready.

Walking was uncomfortable, showering was uncomfortable, and putting clothes on was uncomfortable. But I couldn’t back down now. Today was everything. I couldn’t be defeated by some unknown sickness.

So, with my chin held high, I opened the door and ventured out into the chaotic city streets. Everything was fine, except for the sunlight piercing my sensitive skin and making it tingle, even though I was wearing an overcoat. But that was irrelevant — something else was wrong.

The people around me… stared as if I were naked. Some as if I were drenched in blood. Many gave me disgusted looks, while others refused to meet my eyes. That was the case with the security guard at my workplace — the same man who used to throw flirty comments and desperately try to get my attention. Today, he simply ignored my existence, as if I were filthy. That enraged me, but I let it slide. Today was special.

Almost two hours after that incident, people at work were treating me normally again, so I decided to forget what had happened that morning. And somehow, it worked — so much so that the strange sensation on my skin disappeared. Everything was perfect again — all eyes on me, right where they belonged. Finally, the long-awaited hour had arrived. The grand fashion show that would put me in the world’s spotlight was about to begin.

In my dressing room, some assistants were putting the finishing touches on my dress. Everything was perfect — until I saw myself in the mirror and froze in terror. My face… was gone. So were my shoulders, my chest, and my legs. Everything had changed. A bloody skeleton stared back at me with hollow eyes, my own reflection.

I screamed as loud as my voice could carry. Everyone around me stared in shock, so different from the looks of admiration I usually got.

“Relax, people, she’s just a bit dizzy… it’s normal; she always does this,” my boss said, trying to calm them down while yanking me off the floor rather roughly.

“Listen here, don’t screw with me. I’ve spent too much money on you. Everything has to be perfect,” he whispered in my ear.

Still shaken, I tried to push through what had happened, avoiding the mirror entirely. I lifted my chin again to show everything was fine.

Almost immediately, someone came in to say I was on in five minutes.  
Everything has to be perfect. I worked too hard for this. I’ve sacrificed too much for this. Nothing will go wrong, I told myself.

Five minutes passed. From where I stood, I could see the long runway and dozens of cameras aimed at the model ahead of me.

“You go when she comes back,” said the same person as before.

I was excited. I had waited my whole life for this moment. I had destroyed my body so that this one moment would be worth it.

The model was wrapping up her presentation — it was almost my turn. When I finally heard the signal, I shined. I walked down the runway the best I could — until it all collapsed when I glanced at the model returning. In her eyes, there was pure disgust.

When I looked forward again, blinding flashes filled my vision, but even through them, I could hear the laughter — over and over, from all around me.

I froze, catatonic. Looking down at my hands, I saw them melting away like a burning candle, leaving only bone behind. When I looked up again, the camera lights grew stronger and stronger, and so did the laughter.

“SHUT UP! DO YOU KNOW WHAT I HAD TO DO TO BE HERE?! SHUT UP!” I screamed with all my strength — until the camera flashes stopped, and I saw before me hundreds of what should have been people… but were nothing more than bones and blood.

The cause of death remains inconclusive, but according to experts, the most likely cause was due to the model’s practice of bulimia. Her manager, Carlo Fiore, refused to give a statement.”*
