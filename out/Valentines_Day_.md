“It’s so pretty”

I looked at the gifts all around me and the red flowers blooming on the white sheet.

“I should go back to drawing. The red patterns on the wall are so pretty”

I sat on the floor and stared at the wall with the beautiful red dots spattered on it. This takes me back, I thought. Mother always hated Valentine’s day. My earliest memory of the holiday was my mum burning me with the flat iron just because I showed my mum the drawing I made of a rose.

“SINCE YOU LOVE RED SO MUCH, LET ME LEAVE A MARK YOU WILL NEVER FORGET,” Mother screamed as she pressed the iron into my delicate skin. 

I screamed and cried and begged her to stop but Mother’s vindictive smile got wider and wider till she looked like her face was filled with sharp, hateful teeth curved into a hair raising smile. When Mother was done marring my skin, she took an ice cube and rubbed it over the fresh wound.

“See? The red looks pretty on your skin sweetie”

That was the first of many many “lessons”, though most were not related to drawing. I stopped shortly after because I was not ready to find out how Mother would make the other colours show on my body. But every Valentine’s Day brought its own form of medieval torture, all performed on me by my mum. I let out a bitter laugh and slowly got up.

“I loved art so much that my body became a canvas for Mother.”

I heard a meow and turned around to see the cutest cat ever, with whiskers as long as the hair of that wizard in Legend of The Seeker and fur as soft as the lush carpet in the living room of this house. I bent down and cooed at it till it walked straight into my arms, and let out a contented sigh as it purred in my arms.

“I’m going to keep you. What emulates love more than the relationship between a woman and a cat?” I said as I slowly got up again and continued to pet its fur. I turned towards the entrance of the house and walked towards the front door, passing the bodies of the family I had just murdered. 

Every Valentine’s day, someone had to die at my hands. It’s the only thing I’ve ever known and frankly, it felt satisfying. I would never be like Mother who did not have the guts to finish the job.

I would never be a failure like her.

I looked down to see the fur of the cat turning red as the blood on my hands rubbed off on the cat with every pet I gave it.

“Look at me Mother. I get to have all the red in the world and you cannot stop me. Ever. You will never get to take this away from me”, I said with a light cackle that was carried away with the wind.

Suddenly I started giggling and the giggles turned into maniacal laughter as I walked out of the carnage I had indulged in. 

The moonlight shown through the front door as the blood of the slain seemed to follow me through the rooms of the house. I continued to laugh and as I disappeared into the dark night, with the echo of my laughter being all that was left of me, I sounded just like the woman I loathed: 

Mother.
