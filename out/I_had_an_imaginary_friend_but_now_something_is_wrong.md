This is going to be strange. I've never told this story, because of how weird it is. Or rather, how insane it it sounds. Please don't mind the incoherence of this, as I'm having to remember things from early on in my life.

When I was five or younger, I really don't know the exact age, I lived in what I would call a small town, but since then it has grown into a big one. I won't say where, except it is in Texas. Well, in the house I lived in, there were several things that happened there that were weird. Even my memory of that house is skewed.

I remember that we had at least one of my brothers living there with us, but his room was off limits. I still don't know why. There was the room that my mom and I shared, the kitchen, which was rather small, and a bathroom? It is hard to picture the house, as I was too young, before the age of going to school.

Well, one of the things that happened in that house was that my other brother's kid was sleeping in the living room with me. I was woken up that night to a horrible banging. My mom was at the door, holding it closed. When I asked her who was at the door, she told me that the wolf man was trying to get in.

Even to this day, I don't know who that was supposed to be. And I can't ask anyone either. I remember after the banging stopped, we all went outside and went to the police station. But that's all I remember from that night.

Another odd memory from that house was how I woke up before anyone else. That was strange, because there was always someone awake, but not that day. It was a dreary day, with clouds hanging low in the sky. I remember walking through the house, just looking at things.

You know how older people used razor blades for random things? Well, my mom used to carve her toe calluses off with them. I was always curious what that thing did, or was, as a kid. On the dreary day that I was awake before anyone, I found one of them. I took it with me and went to sit under the dresser in the kitchen.

Once sitting there, I looked at the bendy metal piece, flexing it slightly and turning it end over end. I have a clear memory of taking the edge of the blade across my thumb, of it cutting me but not bleeding. Then a wave of exhaustion hit me and I fell asleep right there. It may have been shock, but I'm not sure.

I woke up hours later, to the house being empty, and my hand being covered in blood, but nothing else. My brother's room was open, which led me to not understanding at the time why it was off limits. Maybe because he wanted privacy? Either way, there wasn't much in there. The sound of rain was everywhere, but I didn't register the sound until I opened the door and actually saw it raining.

No one was in the house, and there was no one visible from the open doorway. In any of the other houses on my little dead end street. I do have some vague memories of my oldest brother coming home, but I won't go into details of what happened then. The memory only goes up until a little after he came inside and told me I scared everyone. This might have been a reason I have some mental issues, what happened slightly after.

The main reason I came here, and am writing this is due to the guy who lived in the closet of my room. At the time, I barely acknowledged him, as far as I remember. He was a creepy guy, who looked almost as tall as the entire closet. He never really spoke to me, and no one else acknowledged him, so I guess I just checked out whenever he was there. I say he, guy, etc, but it was more of a shadow I guess? Like I said, my memory of that house is really hazy and messed up.

Anyways,he was always there, even during the day. I saw him as a solid person shaped shadow, like completely black. The only thing that made him not black, was whenever he had his eyes open. I remember only two or three times that he opened his eyes, but only that he did so. I have no memories of the days when he did. His eyes were red. Like stop light red. Solid, not fluctuating. Like a kid trying to draw eyes on a drawing before they learn any of the nuances of drawing.

Sorry for rambling. I'm typing this up and remembering some things. I remember how I'd always get this feeling of depression, no, that's not right. I'd have this hollow feeling, like something was missing, every time I would look at him. He's honestly the reason I hated going into that room.

When we moved from that house, I didn't see him, but strange things happened in every house I lived I  from then. He was a distant memory until I was fifteen. Ten years, and he had never shown up again. Different city, different mentality. At that point, I had been diagnosed with add or adhd, or both. I have no clue. I was sure I was misdiagnosed either way, as I was showing heavy signs of depression, and had done some stupid things in those waves.

I don't want to go into details, so let your minds wonder on that. In the newest house that I had lived in at that age, I got a nice large bedroom. I think it was 20'x15'x12'. Not sure on the height, as an eight foot ladder could stand up and I could stand near the top rung to touch the ceiling. Either way, this bedroom had a small closet attached. I would generally sit in there whenever I was on the phone, back when you had to do any phone calls after seven for unlimited minutes.

Well, this closet was weird in a way. It was always hot and humid in there. Like, even if I had the door open, and the window unit running full blast, it was still hot. Like, so hot I'd always sweat whenever I was in there. During my stay at that house, I had a religious change and started doing my own research and experimentation with religions.

I branched out into Wicca and a few others, but when I was in my Wiccan phase, I had utilized it to have sight again. Sight like clairvoyance, Astral projection, but I preferred the previous as I did not feel safe with Astral. AP always made me feel weird, which I am getting to. Well, these experiments actually tuned me in to the spirits as well. Well, Mr shadow guy suddenly showed up in the new closet after a while. I played around, kind of toying with it. Gave him a name even, one that I had associated with bullies and assholes. I called him Jack.

But Jack was different in this space. He moved around, never opened his eyes, but still moved instead of just standing there, like at the previous house. Even knocked a few things off of the shelves in the closet. But he wasn't always there. He'd show up randomly, and disappear randomly. And whenever he was there, I had bad issues with depression. Even a few of those.

He overall gave me negative vibes. And when using clairvoyance, what I used to call remote viewing because I was an idiot, I was able to see past the shadow. He had a form, or I projected a form on him? I'm not sure. And I could hear him speak during those sessions. He never spoke anything overly negative or anything. Really just sounded like he was happy to finally be acknowledged.

Even though this change happened whenever I'd be utilizing clairvoyance and the negative air disappeared, afterwards, I'd always get about a week of heavy depression. Like, really bad depression. Then  a few years later, I moved. I moved into a house and took the room without a closet. Thinking about it now, I never had any really bad episodes of depression in that house. I did drink a lot though.

But after everything that happened in that house, and the really bad snow storm of 2010, it was never that bad for me mentally there. Aside from anger, but at least I wasn't sad.

Then I moved into another house, and took the smallest room, and there was a closet. He never showed himself in that room. But I might have been too distracted with a fianc√© and work to realize anything. But depression, oh, that was a big thing in that house. I was always depressed, and so was my partner. My partner even had several attempts made in that house, and cheated on me several times. I found out afterwards, and after a bad breakup. But no signs of Jack.

Now I'm in yet another house, in a different state. There aren't any full closets in an rv, but my depression is pretty bad here. The strange thing, I hardly ever feel alone anymore. I've seen things here, but it could either be the lingering radiation from the 30s/40s, or all the spirits in the area. By now, I'm a polytheistic agnostic, but I still have my beliefs that I've gathered from different religions.

There are shadow people everywhere out here. I have even seen one with red eyes.

But I don't feel the same energy Jack gave off. This energy is worse. Murderous.
