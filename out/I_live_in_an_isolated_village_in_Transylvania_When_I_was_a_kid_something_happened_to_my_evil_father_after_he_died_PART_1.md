My father died at noon on September 18, 1995. I would remember that day for the rest of my living days because that’s when he last beat me and my mother— a foggy autumn Monday morning. He woke up at about ten, demanded breakfast, and spat it in disgust on the floor after the first bite.

The kitchen door stood slightly ajar, and I peeked through, too afraid to even ask for food with him around the house.

“Damn, devil woman! What is this? Am I a fool to you? Are you trying to poison me? I’ll teach you a lesson!” he screamed as if possessed by ungodly spirits. He would then proceed to beat her. He would occasionally beat me too, but those instances didn’t occur as often. My mother screamed and begged, but it didn’t matter to the monster. He stopped whenever he saw fit to stop —probably when the alcohol voices spoke to him to leave her alive so he could do it again.

“I hope he dies, Mom,” I whimpered. I couldn’t stand to see my mom like that. “I hope he burns in hell for what’s doing to you. All these things you have to endure.”

Because of her swollen face, she didn’t want to say anything. She just moaned, hurt, desperate, and sick of that pathetic excuse of a husband who also wore a father's mask.

He got his much-needed satisfaction and went straight to the village bar. After a couple of drinks, the alcohol erased the few physical and mental human features he had. His skin hung from his face as if the melted right off the bone. He couldn’t speak—all the words came out as the mumblings of a madman, and he lost all sense of direction, mainly meaning he got home walking in zig-zag on the old and beaten country road.

He was an evil, ugly, and bitter man who couldn’t love anything. Hate filled his black heart, and the cyanide of desperation ran through his veins. He didn’t care about anything and only knew to ask for things with a sense of immense entitlement. He bowed down to the only god he knew: ALCOHOL.

The saddest thing was that no one knew how violent my dad was. The rest of the villagers knew him only as a good-for-nothing drunk—one of the many drunks in the village.

My mother did all the work in and around the house. She cleaned, cooked, fed the animals, harvested the garden, and cared for me. She said father wasn’t always like that, but with time, he drank more until he finally gave in and the addiction took over.

I wanted the bastard to die a million times before. I hated him with every ounce of my soul. I wished to never see him again—an all-familiar monster wearing a father’s face.

At last, the bleak gods that reigned in the heavens above found fit to grant me my most burning wish — my father's death.

When he returned from that sorry excuse of a bar— where, by the way, the owners used to scam people by speeding the process of getting them drunk or driving the prices of drinks up, he met his end. Of course, the poor drunks didn’t ever see the problem. The owners, a young fellow named Bogdan and his wife Corina, used to laugh and pretend to care about the drunks’ problems. They did it with a smile while screwing them over or handing them drinks they never ordered.

These two are not crucial to this story. I mentioned them and their behavior because this village has a way of getting back to people who don’t have any moral compass. Corina tripped off a beer case and broke her neck, and Bogdan drowned in the river behind the bar—weird situations.

Anyway, back to the man in question. He finished drinking at noon and tried to come home with his wagon. He couldn’t steer it properly, and when he yelled at the horse to move faster, the poor animal got scared and sped up.

Father lost balance, fell, and the horse kicked him in the face. From the kick, the man landed with his left temple on a pointy rock. A large pool of blood formed under his head, and the incident claimed his life. He died with his eyes open and mouth agape, his whole face frozen in horror.

One of the village elders, a man named Janosz, found him laying in the middle of the road. He came to our house and let my mom know about the accident. She didn’t hear me sneak out. I studied their demeanor from a distance and knew Mom would be at peace. I felt as if God lifted an enormous burden from my chest.

Janosz was her father and my grandfather, but he wasn’t much present in our life. He also didn’t know about the violent nature of my father. He and mother always had a cold and distant relationship. Still, I think they cared for one another, even though it wasn’t what one would call a traditional father-daughter relationship.

“Marieta, what happened?” Janosz asked.

“I fell face down on the stairs,” Mother said, averting his gaze.

Janosz wanted to ask more questions but didn’t. Deep down, he knew mother lied to him about the actual motive of her injuries.

“Listen, I came here about your husband. He’s dead. I found him a little while ago on the road. He fell off his wagon and hit his head on a rock. I’m sorry,” Janosz said. He hugged my mom and kissed her on the head.

She didn’t say a thing. She only nodded and glanced past Janosz in the distance, searching for a face in the clouds, reaching for a familiar face to thank for what had happened. I sensed she wasn’t happy with the situation, but she was relieved. She was a good woman, she never wanted father to die. I did, though.

“Can you take me to see him? Is he still there?” Mom asked. She could barely contain the trembling in her hands.

I heard the voice of villagers gathered around my father’s body from afar—a lot of gasps and old ladies who made cross signs in disbelief.

“Poor man. I heard he drank a lot,” a drunk guy said.

“May he rest in peace in the Kingdom of God,” said another grey-haired woman.

“I heard he beat his woman and boy every morning,” a blonde woman whispered to her friend.

“He didn’t die of a good death,” old lady Simina Cerban said.

Now those words made my heart sink. Simina Cerban was a peculiar woman. The village folk said that she did nefarious stuff inside her house. At times, red candlelight would burn in her window at night, and green smoke would come out of the chimney in the middle of the day. They said she was an evil witch who was in league with Satan. I never saw anything wrong happen while passing by her house.

One of my friends said that strange things happened one day in his backyard. He said six of his hens died, six of his goats foamed at the mouth, and blood poured out their eyes, and he found six black frogs under a bucket after a heavy afternoon rain.

He laughed when telling this because his grandmother made him pee on the frogs, poured gasoline over them, and set them on fire. They went out in flames, a black smoke dissipating in the air. He swore he heard a voice inside that smoke telling him that his grandfather would die in three days.

He said the frogs fixated on him, and he felt dizzier by the minute. That’s when his mom came to the rescue. She grabbed his arm, splashed a handful of cold water on his face, and gave him a glass of water with seven burnt matches inside. His family thought Madam Cerban cast an evil spell against them because she didn’t like seeing happy, healthy people.

Many other weird things happened in that village, some of which I have personally seen or experienced in the forty-three years I’ve lived here. This beautiful country, Romania, has seen its fair share of supernatural events. But that’s for another time to discuss.

Now, back to what happened with my father.

After hearing what Madam Cerban said, I dreaded the worst things would happen. I studied his death pose. He had wet his pants, and the blood under his temple had turned black and thick, a coagulated painting made of doom and gloom.

The black horse— my father’s executioner, observed me from afar. At one point, it nodded as if it was the one that granted my wish. I didn’t even flinch upon seeing my messed-up father’s corpse. I kneeled beside him and studied his dead features—the ghastly wide eyes stuck forever in horror and death, the open mouth as if he screamed upon arrival at the gates of hell.

Janosz and a few other men lifted the corpse from the ground and placed it in the wagon. Then, they took him home, where they cleaned, shaved, bathed, and gave him new clothes. No one came to mourn him. I was angry because I didn’t want to see him in that house anymore. Yet, there he was. Even in death, he found fit to stay for a while more.

Night came, and I snuck out of my room to see him again. Pale white face and his lips a dark purple he, he held his arms crossed on his chest as if he fell into a deep slumber; I couldn’t help but smile. He didn’t deserve to be groomed and well-dressed like that. Instead, I would’ve poured alcohol on him and set his body on fire—give him a last taste of his own medicine. I sighed, closed my eyes, and smiled again, thinking the monster was gone once and for all.

Mother didn’t want to waste one more second with him in the house. The burial took place early the next day. A few villagers came, but not because they wanted to be there. They came for the food and drinks my mom would give out at the wake.

The gravediggers slowly but steadily descended the coffin into the hole. Six feet under, the coffin was nailed shut and swallowed by the earth. My father would become food for maggots, his insides rotting into nothingness. In the end, nothing could stop the sands of time.

The funeral ended, and a few villagers returned home to drink and eat at the wake. I just sat in a corner, waiting for the charade to end because the monster didn’t deserve to be remembered as a regular person does. But traditions don’t care about who was who or what kind of person they were.

“Poor man,” said one lady dressed in black and with a face white as a ghost.

“May he rest in peace,” said an old man with a black wool hat.

“His poor family, how will they live from now on?” said another man, half-drunk. He sipped some more wine and ate a chicken thigh. His mouth was oily. He belched while a piece of chicken fell from his mouth, stained his already yellowed, sweaty shirt.

I remember thinking that people would say anything without knowing a specific situation. I couldn’t stand the gossip anymore and went to the last man and whispered that my mom and I would live just fine from then on. One less bastard in the world, one less violent man that no one would ever miss or shed a tear for.

After a few hours, everyone left, and an unusual silence filled the house. Unusual because that would be the time when father came home drunk for the second time of the day and started shouting and breaking things.

Janosz left last. He told Mom to take care of her and me and that he would check on us.

Life went on as it should have. The village folk soon forgot about the accident, and it seemed as if my dad were never there. I loved that. I wanted to tear down his grave sometimes. I wanted to destroy his cross and burn that awful photo on it.

A few weeks went by. Nothing happened.

Until that fateful night.

**Tuesday, October 10, 1995**

&#x200B;

The bizarre events began in the morning. An unusual fog enveloped the whole village, making it hard to see even a few feet ahead. Mother sent me to get the milk from old lady Victoria’s house. On my way there, I passed Madam Cerban’s house and saw her in her front dirty window. She glanced at me and grinned. Her cracked lips, dry saliva in the corner of her mouth, and her yellow-stained, crooked teeth made my heart beat ten times faster. She waved at me in slow motion and then slowly retreated into the darkness of her home. I heard a faint animal cry and then silence. Her dog observed me through the spaces between her fence but didn’t bark. I felt like the woman studied me through that dog’s eyes.

As I left that crooked house behind me, my heart rate returned to normal.

Mrs. Victoria gave me two bottles of warm fresh milk, told me to say hello to my mother, and that she would visit her soon. She was a good woman; may God rest her soul. I remember she gave me some homemade sour cherry jam too. I paid only for the milk and thanked her for the present. She died a few years ago at the age of 93. She had no kids and no relatives left alive, and I thought it would be nice to take her off her grave, keep it clean, and remove the weeds and stains from the cross.

The fog thickened when I went back. I could only see ten or maybe twelve steps ahead—all the houses on the right and left sides of the road became lost in the fog. I sighed, relieved I wouldn’t see Madam Cerban’s house. Thank God for that.

Yet, as I walked back home, I could see a strange shape forming in the middle of the road. At first, I thought it was a large animal, maybe a pig, and I stopped dead in my tracks. I wiped my eyes to see if I’d imagined it. Now the apparition seemed closer to a human body. It came towards me, a low-pitched whispered groan breaking the silence around me.

Madam Cerban stopped three feet in front of me. She levitated above ground. She had mushrooms in her hair, twigs, and small animal bones and skulls — rat teeth, a chicken beak, and a dried frog adorned her unkempt hair. She opened her mouth, and a swarm of worms fell on the gravel. Her eyes, two black spots, observed me with malice intent.

“Little boy, little boy. Why didn’t you say hello when you first passed through?” she asked. She grabbed both my shoulders, and I felt her hands squeezing while her fingers grew longer. I wanted to speak, but the words remained stuck in the back of my throat. Her nails dug under my skin and warm blood started pouring. I didn’t even feel the pain.

“It’s starting tonight, you know? It’s all coming back, and there’s no way of stopping it. All the suffering and torment your mother and you thought was left behind is coming back to haunt you again,” she said. She laughed like a maniac; her head jerked backward while a thick cloud of black smoke flew toward the sky from her mouth.

“Let me go!” I screamed from the top of my lungs. I didn’t know how I found the words, but I was glad because she let me go.

“You go tell your mother it’s coming; the plague is coming!” she screamed. I glanced back, and she had vanished into the fog.

I ran home, almost out of breath. The fog slowly dissipated. A murder of crows circled my house, maybe ten or twenty meters above. They cawed as the black and dark grey clouds appeared in the sky. Thunder boomed in the distance. I thought the end of days arrived, and that’s what Madam Cerban talked about.

“Vlad, come quickly! Get inside! The storm’s coming!” my mother cried from the backyard. “I have to lock the animals and chickens, and I’ll join you.”

“Alright, Mother!” I replied. I placed the milk on the kitchen table. The smell of freshly baked bread filled the whole kitchen. I grabbed one, ripped a corner, and stuffed it in my mouth. Before I knew it, half of the loaf was gone. I wanted to take more but dropped when I saw that what remained was rotten, moldy, and worms danced inside it.

I blinked, rubbed my eyes, and it all returned to normal. Maybe it was all from the shock of meeting Madam Cerban. That evil witch scared the living soul out of me. Mother soon finished the chores, and the rain began pouring. It was a heavy storm, and the raindrops banged against the tin roof in a staccato rhythm. Du-du-du-du-du.

I watched it all outside the living room window.

Mother came and gave me a big bowl of chicken soup and scolded me mildly for eating half of the bread loaf. I said it is what it is; at least she had to feed only two mouths instead of three. She didn’t like it, but I only said the truth.

Night soon came, and the storm went away. She tucked me in bed, kissed me on the cheek, and said goodnight. I fell asleep in an instant.

A Strange nightmares came into focus. I found myself in the field behind the village church, glancing at the moon that loomed over the ancient hills. Behind me, I heard noises as if someone was digging the dirt in the cemetery. But it didn’t sound like a burial, like dirt hitting the coffin. No, to me, it was the other way around. It was as if a dead person wanted to dig themselves out and stay longer on this earth instead of heaven or hell.

The nightmare transported me to the front of my father’s grave. The cross was broken in half, and the grave was dug out. The coffin had been opened, and the body was missing. My father decided to come back to life, and it scared me so bad that I remember waking up panting to a soft tap on the window.

Tap-tap-tap-tap. Then slow-motion scratch against the window. The sound made me jump out of the bed. I looked outside to see the intruder, my dead father, or maybe Madam Cerban, but saw no one there. Then from the corner of my eye, I thought I saw a figure moving outside the house. I blinked and they were gone.

Relieved, I went back to bed, but not before studying the ceiling for a few more minutes. What would the meaning of that awful dream be? Was it from the earlier shock in the fog? Was it because I thought my father would haunt us deep inside, even from the grave?

I was scared but somehow managed to go back to sleep.

Only to wake up again in the dead of night. My mother’s screams pierced the walls of the house. I jumped out of bed and ran to check on her. I ran to her room, turned on the lights and saw her twisting and turning in bed, her whole face red and sweaty.

“He’s on top of me, he’s eating me, he’s killing me!” she cried. But no one was there.

“Mom, wake up!” I screamed.

“He tried choking me!” she said.

“Who tried to?”

“Your father!” she exclaimed.

I stood petrified. There were too many coincidences for this only to be an illusion or hallucination. The encounter with Madam Cerban and all that happened after what she said, the crows above my house, the heavy storm, my nightmare, the tapping and scratching on the window, and my mother’s scare all meant something.

What she said was true because she had hand marks around her neck as if someone had tried to strangulate her. I gave her a glass of water and tried to calm her down and comfort her.

“Mom, I need to tell you something,” I whispered. I then told her about all that happened until I awoke to her screams.

“Strigoi,” she said. All blood had drained from her face, and she became as white as a sheet. “I feel sick, Vlad. Very sick. I think he’s trying to kill me, and God only knows I can’t let you on your own in this dying and twisted world. You need to go and get Janosz here at the crack of dawn. He was born on a Saturday. He can see the strigoi.”
