I am a high school student. Im a nerd, a target for bullies and anyone could easily say I am being bullied. I try to act cool. Not good at anything. My parents are worried for me. But I didn't care abt them. Now I worry I should have been more responsible. I have never tried to kill me. But I took a lot of sleeping pills. 

My aim was not to kill me but I think Im gonna die. I need to sleep now. If I don't sleep, that motherfucker would kill me. If I died, everyone must know I didn't commit a suicide. Lemme explain it from the start. It all started when my frnd said abt the urban legend 'The damned building'. She said that if we went inside the 'damndd building ' in our dream we could kill who ever we waent(pls tolerate with my spelling, grammar mistakes. I don't have the fuckin time to correct those mistakes). 

I asked her how to get inside the building . She said that someone who need to get inside that building must have a strong will to kill someone.( I sure had the reason and the will to kill that bitch and his stupid boyfriend. What they did to me is insane level abuse. They're not needed in this world. They always steal money from me and sometimes forces me to have sex. I want them dead.)

 The next thing I needed was their photo which I must keep  in contact with my body while I sleep. There's no loss in trying what she said. I didn't believe in what she said initially. But I ended up getting a photo of the boyfriend from the schl album, tucked it under my shirt, and drifted to sleep.

 You can't believe what happened next. I woke up or I thought I woke up infront of a building. It had a strong smell of death in the air. The environment was looming. There was no one around. The building was surrounded by pine trees. It had an entrance straight infront of me. It looked like it was very old. I went inside to see a room full of pictures of random people. I have never ever seen them. Suddenly I remembered why I was there.

 I hesitated for a minute. But I went searching for a vacant place. I kept on walking as the building was never-ending watching different people's photo. At last I came to the last photo. Near to it was a vacant wall with a pen in the floor. I took that and wrote his name in the wall imagining his face in my mind. Suddenly out of nowhere his photo frame appeared there.

 I was sweating like hell the next day when I woke up. I just cant believe my dream. It was exactly like the urban legend my frnd said. I now want to just tear the photo of him to get him killed. I just can't process this. Am I hallucinating my dreams?

 Whatever, I packed my bag and went to the schl with his photo in my bag. The day was fine until he called me to give him a blowjob. I refused. He forced. He got mad as I said no. After class he confronted me in the schl's washroom and he beat the shit out of me stealing the money I was left out with.

 I got insanely mad. I had his photo in my bag which I tore. I never thought,even in my wildest dreams ,he would die instantly. I was walking out of the schl when I heard his scream wailing through the air for the last time as he was rode over a truck killing him instantly. I felt chills in my spine. Did I just kill someone?

I got scared and ran back to my home. I was inside my room for the whole evening when my frnd called me. She was not sounding great. She asked whether I did that. I was honest with her. She was not happy. I tried to convince her that this was a weird coincidenct. She must not worry. 

After this incident I did the same thing with that bitch too after a week and she died in a fire accident in her home. Now the whole schl was haunted by something. The students were always walking in groups scared of something. My frnd probably leaked abt the urban legend and everyone was talking abt this, blaming someone for their death.

 But nobody pointed me. But somehow the students were convinced that my frnd was the mastermind behind this curse. She was excluded from everything. I was the only girl to support her. Everyone were scared of her. She was depressed.

 One night she called me and said that she is going to confess abt what I did to the whole schl. I shouted at her that she can't do that. But she ended the call abruptly. I was scared like hell. I can't let people know abt the horrible thing I did. At that moment I did something which I regret till now.

 That decision was purely for survival. I decided to get inside the damned building again to kill my frnd. We were never really that close. So I got no choice. Everything happened again,she died in a car accident on the way to schl. Now the whole schl was shocked as the one who was being blamed for the killings got killed.

 Everyone were scared of each other. The school's environment became very silent. I felt guilty and tried to do something good. I am a fan of Light Yagami and decided to do what he might have did if he was in my situation. I went inside the building with a picture of a serial rapist tucked to me. 

But when I entered I  froze in shock to see my picture in the wall. My frnd must have told what I did and some motherfucker is avenging me for her death

. I went infront of the photoframe and pulled the photo out of the wall. The imprint of the photo frame got in my hands as I finally got the photo in my hand. My hands were red in colour. It was throbbing. The photo of me suddenly disappeared and my name appeared in the wall. To my relief I erased it with my saliva and hands.

 The next morning I took a day off finding who tried to kill me. I can't go to shl just like that. I needed to find which motherfucker is trying to kill me. I was very restless the whole day. I thought of checking the damn building again just in case.The night came. 

But to my distress I wasn't able to sleep. I got no other choice than eating a sleeping pill which I stole from my grandmother . I finally slept and I went to the building again. I found my photo again and removed it again.

 It started to repeat. Everyday I slept and went into the building and removed the picture. I was increasingly scared for my life. Day before yesterday I was not able to sleep even with two sleeping pills. I got no other choice. I ate another sleeping pill (the medicine box said that only two pills should be consumed at a day).

 Yesterday I was able to sleep with three pills. But tday I tried a lot. But I just can't. I ate four whole sleeping pills which became a mistake. I can feel my pulse slowing down. Im feeling dizzy. I am scared for my life. The sun will rise in two hours after which I can't remove the picture no matter what. I think I messed up everything. Am I gonna die?
