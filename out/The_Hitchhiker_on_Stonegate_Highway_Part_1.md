That day, as usual, I was on a solo trip towards the deserted ruins, a place I had been to many times. Yet it always called me back, as if it liked my company.

The route was so familiar that I could direct anyone there blindly. I had an exceptional memory for roads. I could memorise entire routes, no matter the distance. I remembered tiny details, the types of trees, small landmarks, insignificant things that somehow mattered. It was almost impossible for me to lose my way, even if I was travelling a specific route for the first time.

I remembered my time as a tour guide, not just in my own area but in nearby states as well. I was often called Google Maps for my ability to guide tourists and lost drivers whenever they misplaced their maps.

Nevertheless, I was still almost a three-hour drive away from my destination, and I knew I would soon reach the gas station where I usually refilled and bought snacks.

When I reached the gas station, it looked slightly unfamiliar that day, as if it had been stripped of its familiarity. A fog of deception seemed to have engulfed it. Strangely, the fog appeared to stop exactly at the gas station, while it stretched endlessly ahead. I had to leave early, so I walked towards the convenience store, but something felt off there too. The store looked slightly misplaced. It was always right next to the air pump, yet that day it seemed as though it had shifted.

I didn’t want to engage myself in all that, so I grabbed a few snacks from the rack I usually picked my favourites from and sat back inside my car.

Next, I drove off towards the ruins. I passed the tallest tree that seemed to know me well, its hanging branches always stroked my car’s roof like a mother stroking her child’s hair. Then I reached the familiar milestone that read "12 miles." It used to read "8 miles."

"Looks like someone messed with it," I said to myself, and continued. A while later, the fuel indicator caught my eye, That meant it hadn’t refilled at the gas station. something I must have missed amid the station’s sudden inaccuracies.

While the road felt too calm and too silent. I could hear the tyres gliding against the asphalt. It didn't look like the road I knew well.

As a usual habit, I unfolded the vanity mirror and looked at myself. My eyelids stretched wide in confusion. For a few seconds, it felt like I had seen someone else. I immediately stopped the car, turned the dome light on, and sighed in relief.

After a mile or two, I was greeted by a diversion. The barricades were still dripping with mud, as if they had been installed moments ago. The road past the diversion had nothing blocking it, no accident, no landslide. A large arrow pointing left was cut into one of the barricades. The fog swayed around it like a snake coiled on a branch.

I wondered why they would install barricades for no reason. But there was no way I was removing those barricades, so I followed the diversion.

The fog had already made it harder to look around, but it didn’t block the road ahead, as if it were mindful of my passing.

Half a mile later, everything began to change abruptly.

The road was covered in huge markings, graffiti, if you could call it that. They weren’t static. They moved, slowly enough to be barely noticeable, like a snail crawling through sand. The trees no longer looked like trees. They looked like people. When stared at, they appeared normal again, but moments later you could sense them moving, folding their hands like humans.

Then I heard noises from nearby. It was a narrow stretch of dirt road. It looked like a family was camping there. I could hear wood crackling and children laughing, but there was something else as well. It felt like someone was crying far away. The sound echoed from all directions at once, followed by the sound of small canals appearing out of nowhere.

When I entered the dirt road, a sharp wind blew my car sideways. It was so forceful it felt like driving past a tornado. The pressure shoved me forward, as if a tow truck were pulling me from behind. In the rear-view mirror, I could see the fog, thick, massive, swaying as a single entity.

I continued down the road ahead. The faintly glowing graffiti lit the path, pulsating in unison. When I looked up at the sky, it appeared as though countless shooting stars were firing at once, endlessly. It was mesmerising, yet deeply otherworldly.

After covering what felt like only a few meters, my car began to hiccup. That meant my fuel tank was empty, something that didn’t seem possible. I opened the car door, stepped out, and began walking instead, hoping to find someone who could tow my vehicle to a nearby gas station.

After walking for what felt like an hour beneath the shooting stars and the pulsating road, surrounded by eerie trees that looked far too human. I saw a man standing beside the road, his thumb raised.

"Why would someone stand like that when there are no vehicles approaching?" I asked myself. But what felt stranger than the man was my own voice. When I spoke, even quietly, the words echoed back from all directions at once, as if the surroundings were mimicking me.

The hitchhiker was the only person I could ask for directions, and possibly a gas station nearby.

Now, I regret it.
I wish I hadn’t walked towards him.

As I approached, his thumb slowly lowered. He looked at me next. His eyes were foggy, and his veins were visible beneath his skin, pulsating like the road itself.

Then it happened...

The hitchhiker entered me, like a soul slipping into a body.

A sharp pain struck the back of my head. My body jerked violently. My skull felt like it was about to burst.
