Im not sure what it was or how it started, I dont even remember how long ago it was but I do remember the day it started.

It was a monday, I didnt have work on mondays thankfully so like normal I had an urge to just stay in bed and rot away but on that day it seemed unusually stronger as if the bed was calling my name and holding me in bed, but I knew I had to get up and at least do something valuable with my time, so I got out of bed and stumbled my way into the kitchen, the curtains were still covering the window so I couldn't see any sunlight, it was nice. I made my self some breakfast I dont really remember what I exactly had for breakfast but I did eat, in fact I dont remember much at all from that week its like it was a blur, like a dream, but it couldnt be a dream, especially not after what happened to my neighbours. I sat down and ate pondering what to do today knowing I would just rot on the couch watching some stupid show that I was only half interested in, and thats exactly what i did.

I woke up to a loud crash as if something heavy had fallen from a shelf from somewhere in my house, I live alone, the windows were shut and curtains drawn so no wind was coming in or out of my house, but something fell or I thought so, I looked everywhere around my house for something, anything that could of made that noise, but there was nothing, nothing laying on the floor, under the bed that may have rolled under there, nothing at all, everything was how it was when I fell asleep so just what exactly made that loud crash, I thought it may have just of been in my dream but it sounded real, it woke me up it had to of been real, it was stuck in my head all day long while I tried my best to focus on the stupid TV that didnt even interest me.
"Holy fuck this is boring" I said to myself out loud, I  dont know why I was talking to myself, maybe I thought it ease my mind but it didnt, my voice just echoed in my house reminding me Im all alone.

I didnt realise how much time passed until Netflix asked me if Im still watching, thats when I looked to the clock in my kitchen, 7:00pm, I havent had dinner yet, I didnt even have lunch but I wasnt hungry once again my bed was calling my name, but I had to eat and so I did, I ordered some KFC, I know it wasn't healthy but fuck it I didnt want to cook, it arrived shortly later and I ate it, once again it was mediocre, Ive had better and i know the store I order from can do better but it didnt matter and so now that I ate I decided to give in and answer the call from my bed and go to sleep.

*CRASH*. Once again I was awoken to that same loud noise except it sounded closer, much closer as if it was right in my ear and once again I go to investigate and just like last time, nothing, everything the same, I see its 2:00am not early enough to stay up so i went back to bed


My eyes flutter open like a butterfly in the early morning, it was still dark, I look at the clock and see its only 4:00am the sun hasnt risen, but that morning was weird, I had an overwhelming urge to get up, normally I wake up at 6:00am and stay in bed till 8:00am but now I have an urge to actually get up and move, and so I do, sadly i had work that day at 9:00am and I really didnt want to go and get yelled at for not fully remembering which cheeses are slightly sour and which ones were not, I dont fucking eat cheese can they even be sour or not I dont know but it didnt matter i worked in a supermarket I had to deal with idiots. It didnt matter what time it was I just got up and walked to my kitchen ready to have something to eat when I notice all of my bloody ceral boxes which were only 2, were empty and on the floor with crumbs coming out of them, "Did a bloody animal get in last night" I asked myself out loud, but this was no animal, it was no human either.

Out of the corner of my eye I see a figure move as if it was hiding from me, or watching me, waiting, I turn the lights on to find nothing but a note on my table and it read, "Death, Death, Death" was written over an over in quick frantic handwriting my blood went cold but I saw it again, the shadow, it was behind me slightly but I could still see it, as soon as I turned around it ran and it made a noise as it quickly disappeared *CRASH* the same noise that awoken me, I follow where I saw it went and found another note "KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL" Written again over and over but this time more frantic and in capitals the words were overlapping eachother. *CRASH* *CREAKING* I hear the crash again, it was infront of me, I look up to see a human figure whose neck was 1 foot long and twisted, its head fully spun around, multiple ribs protruding out of its chest, it had multiple fingers on each hand in the quick glance I had I saw 8, it had jagged rows of teeth in its mouth that could open wide enough to fit a watermelon, all of this was illuminated by my dinning room light, it screeched at me making a noise youd think only dinosaurs and prehistoric creatures would make, it ran at me full speed as I ran back to my room and locked my self in there, I barracaded the door with my dresser and stayed in my room until I got a call from my boss

"Hey were are you, you were meant to come in at 9:00am this is the 3 time this month, please tell me you have a good reason" he berated me over the phone

"Ive been spewing all morning, it just haesnt stopped, I havent had the time to call im sorry" I lied through my teeth

"Fine whatever, stay home get better I guess, better not pull this shit next week though" he continued to berate me, but i couldnt care.

5:00pm so much time has passed, and I havent left my room once I was hungry, and needed to desperately use the bathroom and so I unbarracaded my door and checked out into the hallway, nothing, good, I went on and ate and went to the bathroom and went right back to my room, I thought about calling my friend for a distraction but it didnt go through, she didnt answer, it was okay though because the bed was calling my name.


4:00am again, I woke up and had an urge to get up, but I couldnt I didnt want to, I was too scared after what I saw, but the urge was too strong, I got up and left my room and searched my house, nothing. I went on with my day like normal, went to work, came home, ate, and went to bed the only abnormal thing was this time the bed wasnt calling my name, I still had the urge to stay up and not rot in bed, but I went to bed anyway. The rest of the week went on just like that day, nothing happening, no noises, no notes, just that urge to stay awake, and it stayed that way until Saturday 

The Saturday sun had risen and so did I, I walked into the kitchen and made my self breakfast, everything was normal until I heard it again, *CRASH*, it came from above me, in my attic, I forgot I had one but I did, this time a new urge entered my body, I needed to investigate, I opened my attic and climbed the ladder that came down and almost hit my head like it does everytime, but something was off as soon as the door opened my nose was assaulted by this brutal smell, that smelt like I was living in a pile of decomposing rats, but I climbed the ladder and when i got into my attic I found what was making that smell, My friend, the one I called on Tuesday, Dead, she was hung on what looked like a meat hook half eaten, her jaw was ripped off of her skull and her torso and chucks bitten out of it, her bones where protruding out of her body, out of the places it feasted upon, some of those bones where broken, her neck was snapped and from the gapping hole in her stomach I could see so was her spine, her flesh was half decomposed with maggots crawling out of her pores and eye holes, and from her muscle, it was horrific but the creature wasnt up here.

After seeing her like that, I had enough, I ran and ran, I remember calling a taxi to an airport where i then spent every penny in my savings to by myself a plane ticket somewhere else, I settled on Norway, it was a hassle and I managed to get the rights to stay in that country as a resident and now have a job here a good one thats not a shitty supermarket, and I even got my self a dog a beautiful golden retriever named "Lucky". Not long after I left and and landed in Norway I was in my house watching television when I saw on the news that the neighbours of my house were found brutally murdered, the same way my friend was, the polic also found notes very similar the ones i found in my place, the police never found the creature though but at least I was safe now, I feel bad for leaving my friend in that attic for food for that thing but I had too 

A full 4 years has passed since it all started and thank god nothing has occured, every day the normal thing, wake up, get the urge to stay in bed but I dont, and get up, and its stayed that way until this morning when I got awoken by a loud crash and the feeling to get up and move, I looked out my window and saw it again, IT fucking followed me here.
