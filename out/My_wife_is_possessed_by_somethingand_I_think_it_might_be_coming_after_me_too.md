My wife is possessed. I know how that sounds, but it's true. She's possessed, and I'm afraid that I could very soon meet the same fate.  
  
It started about a year ago. My wife, Amy used to work a standard secretarial job. It was all kept very top-secret, but I knew that she was the assistant of some very important and powerful people. I knew that she had a desk, took calls, filed reports, standard secretarial stuff. At least, that's what I thought.  
  
One night, Amy came home from work, completely shell-shocked. I asked her what was wrong, but she shrugged off my concerns. Eventually, I managed to prise it out of her that she'd accompanied her boss to a top secret location. I gathered that she must have seen something shocking, hence her reaction.  
  
She wasn't quite right for a few days after that. That was back when she was still talking, walking, moving around. I could tell that she wasn't herself. It was almost like she was in some sort of trance. Eventually, I decided that I had to find out more about where she went that day. "Amy?" I asked, when we were both sitting at the table. "What happened, that day when you went out to that secret location?"  
  
"Nothing happened," Amy responded, her voice monotonous. "I didn't see anything." It sounded like she was reading the words off a script. I figured that this was what her boss had instructed her to say. Clearly, this was another top-secret project.  
  
Still, I couldn't shake the fact that something was wrong with Amy. My concerns heightened, when I caught her late at night, sitting straight up and staring at the wall. What was even more worrying, was the fact that she was mumbling. It was the same sentence over and over again. "Nothing happened. I didn't see anything. Nothing happened. I didn't see anything."  
  
I didn't know that these would be the last words I'd ever hear Amy speak.  
  
"Amy, come on," I told her. "It's the middle of the night. You need to go to sleep." As I spoke, she seemed to not even register my presence. Eventually, she laid her head back down on her pillow, and fell asleep within seconds. Even when she was sleeping, Amy still didn't look peaceful.  
  
That was where it all changed. I woke up the next morning, and Amy was gone. She was not in the bed next to me. Immediately, I jumped up, terrified for her. I raced from room to room, until I finally found her.  
  
Amy was sitting in the middle of the bathroom, her entire body shaking. I noticed that she was mumbling something under her breath, rambling like she was crazy. As I rushed towards her, I noticed that her hands were covered in scratches, deep cuts that still had fresh blood emerging.  
  
I tried to make her snap out of it. I yelled at her, I shook her, I pleaded with her to stop, but she wouldn't. Amy just stayed on the floor, curled up, muttering the same sentence over and over again.  
  
"Nothing happened. I didn't see anything. Nothing happened. I didn't see anything."  
  
That was where it started. From that moment onwards, Amy wouldn't talk. She wouldn't speak, she wouldn't move, she wouldn't eat. She couldn't do anything for herself. I took her to countless specialists, doctors that cost a fortune, but they all told me the same thing. There was nothing that they could do for her. Scans showed that nothing was wrong with her brain. This was purely psychological, and they couldn't even help her there.  
  
I even contacted psychics, people who claimed to read minds, even a preacher who rambled about finding God for three hours. As Amy's condition grew more severe, I turned to different people. A man who claimed to be a revered exorcist. Nothing. Even he had to admit defeat.  
  
I had to quit my job to care for Amy. It was a completely isolating experience. During the day, she wouldn't move. She slept, or stared into the distance, making no movements to do anything else. The nights were the hardest.  
  
I slept in a room next to hers, so that I could hear them. The screams. They were low, guttural, almost a growl. They didn't sound like Amy. They weren't her. They almost seemed demonic, like they were coming from deep inside her. It was like she was possessed.  
  
It was difficult to sleep, knowing that I'd be woken up by the screaming. It didn't happen every night, but when it did, it was difficult to ignore. I would rush into Amy's room, to find her lying, motionless, on her bed, unaware of the monstrous cry that had just come from her. Occasionally, she would go into a state of frenzied muttering. Always the same sentence, over and over.  
  
"Nothing happened. I didn't see anything. Nothing happened. I didn't see anything."  
  
I tried everything that I could for her. I even tried to contact her old boss, but I couldn't find any traces of him, or the company that Amy had worked for. It was like it had never existed.  
  
I still saw doctors, specialists, people who claimed to be clairvoyants, exorcists, psychics. I had people who came and recited prayer, who faked exorcisms, who attempted to read Amy's mind. They were all con artists, the lot of them.  
  
Of course, Amy's condition took a toll on me, too. Any spare time that wasn't spent at her bedside, I was hunched over my laptop, researching. I joined chat forums with people who were going through something similar. That was where I first started to consider the idea that Amy was possessed by some unknown entity. Something had possessed her, that day when she came home from work.  
  
I had hired nurses, people to take care of Amy when I couldn't, but they all quit after a few weeks. Their reasons were always the same. Being around Amy made them uneasy. Things started to happen to them. Strange things. They started to see shadows, feel lightheaded. They would quit, and never even come back.  
  
It was then, that I started to accept it. My wife was possessed. I didn't know who, or what, was responsible for it, but she was possessed. It made so much sense, now.  
  
I began to look for an answer, a reason for her possession. I looked through all of Amy's documents from her old job. I saw a lot of files marked- "Top Secret". I read a few things that I probably shouldn't have. Still, none of it gave me the answers that I so desperately wanted.  
  
Until I found it. One document, titled- "The Demon". I knew immediately that it was exactly what I was looking for. I opened it, without even hesitating. I had to have answers. I had to know what Amy saw, that day.  
  
So, I started to read. I can't even describe what I saw. As I read, it felt like my insides were twisting inside, my stomach churning, my heart exploding in my chest. What I saw was so shocking, so horrifying, that it began to almost numb my brain.  
  
I obsessed over it. I was plagued by it. I didn't want to move, I didn't have the energy to even think of anything else. It was like I had forgotten everything else, like I had almost forgotten who I was. I could think of nothing else, but the horror that I read on the pages of the top-secret document. When I closed my eyes, all I could see were the pages, flicking, a sound that haunted me.  
  
I didn't go out of the house much anymore. The only people who I saw were Amy's nurses. One nurse, Martha, was the first person to notice that I wasn't acting like myself. At the end of her shift, she asked me a question. "Is everything okay with you?" she asked. "I know that this is hard, but you don't seem like yourself. What's going on? Did something happen?"  
  
And before I could even think of how to answer, it felt like the words were already spilling out of my mouth, uncontrolled. As I said them, my heart almost seemed to stop.  
  
"Nothing happened. I didn't see anything."
