[PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/18cjxnh/stay_far_away_from_the_a41_motorway_no_exceptions/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I awaken with a stiff neck, disoriented in the first moments. Initially, I assume I've dozed off uncomfortably in bed, only to realize my actual location: the driver's seat of my Ford, stationed behind an Italian gas station amid dense woods.

A subdued groan escapes me, but I quickly hush myself, wary of disturbing Mae. Shifting my gaze toward her, I discover she's not asleep.

"Are you awake, baby?"

"A long time ago. Too uncomfortable and cold to sleep."

"What time is it?"

I consult the car's on-board computer, which indicates 4:26 am. Despite the early hour, darkness still envelops the surroundings with no hint of dawn.

"Oh, I feel utterly wrecked from that sleep."

"But are you ready to go?"

"I think so. Let's wait until dawn and hit the road."

Exiting the car, I feel a sense of wooziness, accompanied by a splitting headache and a stuffy nose. The chilly air catches me off guard; I had anticipated warmth on this journey. Glancing upward, I observe the bitten apple of the moon partially obscured by dark clouds. In an attempt to shake off my sluggishness, I make my way to the nearby toilet stall and buy another can of energy drink from the vending machine.

Gotta grab some gas. I'm so fed up with this situation that all I want is a straight shot from here to my destination, no pit stops for fuel. I fire up the car and pull alongside the gas pumps. Placing my half-empty energy drink bottle on the car's roof, I attempt to fill up and pay, but the monitor stays dark. It's out of order.

"Crap, it's not working."

"We still have enough fuel. Should be sufficient to reach town," Mei reassures.

I nod in agreement, and we hit the road once more.

Mei's grim.

"I told Mom I'd ring her up once we hit Venice. She was waiting for my call last night, and she's probably freaking out by now."

"It's okay; I'm sure she thinks you just dozed off after the long drive."

"Man, it's so dark. It's five o'clock; why isn't it dawn yet..."

I'm nearly as exhausted as I was before catching a bit of sleep. The trees zip by, merging into an indistinct mass, and I feel a wave of dizziness.

"Shit."

"What's up?"

"I forgot to grab my energy drink off the car roof. It was almost full."

I flick on the music, and the familiar song starts playing again. After two repeats, I switch off the radio.

"I’m feeling nauseous," Mei confesses.

"Motion sickness?"

"I think it's hunger. It's been ages since we had a proper meal."

"Anyway, we're definitely on the right track now."

"You said that last time too."

"Damn, even if I'm wrong again, I don't care. We're going this way. This stupid road has to end at some point, right?"

We continue driving through the never-ending darkness. My eyelid starts to twitch. Will dawn ever arrive?

In the distance, I notice something, and a lump forms in my throat. Because I recognize it. I don't want to believe it, but I do.

"What the hell..." Mei whispers.

It's the gas station again. The exact same one, right down to the last detail. I slam on the brakes outside the gas station and storm out of the car, frustrated. Mei joins me outside; her movements seem sluggish, as if in slow motion.

"We're driving in circles."

"That's impossible, okay? We're definitely heading the opposite way from when we pulled into the gas station. I give you a hundred percent guarantee."

"I get it, but you can see it's the same gas station, right?"

"Not the same one, just similar."

"Finn…"

"What, you want me to believe I'm losing my mind?"

"No, no... look!"

I fix my gaze on the stain she's pointing at—a spill of liquid almost absorbed by the asphalt—and the discarded energy drink can nearby.

"Isn’t that your energy drink?"

"I don't understand..."

"I think this road... it's like a loop. And we can't get off it, no matter which way we go."

"You can't be serious."

"Well, how do you explain it?"

"I thought you were rational enough not to believe in any mysticism."

"Finn, look at the sky. Dawn should have come about three hours ago. I try to think rationally, but sometimes the most obvious answer is..."

"The most obvious answer can't be that we're on a loop!"

"Then I'll wait for you to come up with a rational explanation."

Mei squats down, resting against the vending machine. I'm at a loss for words, unsure how to navigate this situation.

"I suggest we empty this vending machine of all the food and water. At least we'll have some supplies."

"Not that there's much to take... but yeah, let's do it."

We utilize our remaining coins to purchase all the snacks from the vending machine and indulge in a meager breakfast of chips.

"If we can't escape this... we might not come across any other food. Let's ration the candy bars and water," Mei suggests.

Her words plunge me into utter frustration. Are we genuinely having this discussion? Seriously considering the possibility of starvation? I let out a sigh.

"Let's just… think. If this road is looped, how did we end up here?"

"It's clearly tied to the moment a car almost collided with us. Our own car."

"Not ours, a similar one," I correct.

"Yeah, with the same license plate."

"I did mention I'm uncertain about what I saw. Now that I think about it, it could be a false memory."

"A peculiar coincidence, don't you think?"

"Okay, Mei, let's entertain the idea that you're right, and we're stuck in a loop. What does that get us? How do we break free?"

"I don't know, but circling past the same gas station clearly isn't working. We need to try something different."

"Should we go after the blue Ford again? The issue is, we never spotted it again. Nor any other car, for that matter..."

Before I can respond, a thought hits me.

"The bus. It's the only distinctive thing around here, apart from the gas station. The sole feature that stands out in this monotonous landscape."

"Do you want to check it out?"

"'Tis the only alternative I've got. Any other ideas?"

"No, you're right. I agree."

We leave the gas station behind, its neon lights fading as we drive further into the darkness. The road stretches endlessly ahead, seemingly mocking our attempts to break free. The air inside the car thickens with uncertainty, and the hum of the engine remains the sole disruptor of the eerie silence.

As we approach the bus, its form gradually becomes more apparent, standing solitary in the desolate landscape. I park the car at a short distance, exchanging hesitant glances with Mei. Moving closer, the details of the bus become clearer – the bus sits at an odd angle, tires deflated, windows shattered, and a web of cracks on its windshield. The impact of a crash is unmistakable. The vehicle seems abandoned, left to decay.

"What the hell happened here?" Mei mutters, her voice barely audible above the whispering wind.

She cautiously takes the lead, and we circle the vehicle, searching for any signs of life or clues about our predicament.

"Stay close," I say to Mei. She peers through a dusty window, attempting to see inside, while I check the front for any indication of its last journey.

"Nothing," Mei murmurs, her voice tinged with disappointment.

The doors resist our attempts to open them. With a frustrated exhale, I take a step back and survey the situation. The idea of breaking into the bus feels absurd, yet desperation pushes me to consider it. I scan the perimeter, searching for something to aid my impromptu break-in. Spotting a discarded metal rod nearby, I grab it and approach the bus doors. I wedge the rod between them, using it as leverage to pry them open. After a tense moment, the doors creak open, revealing the dimly lit interior of the bus.

The air inside is stale, carrying a faint scent of abandonment. The torn seats and scattered debris tell a silent story of the chaos that unfolded within these metal walls.

Mei hesitates at the entrance.

"Stay there. There's broken glass everywhere," I call to her, stepping cautiously over the debris and into the bus. The interior is a haunting tableau frozen in time  –  discarded belongings, shattered glass, and an overturned luggage compartment.

I begin to search through the scattered belongings on the bus, my fingers sifting through the remnants of lives once intertwined with this metal vessel. The dim light reveals forgotten possessions – a tattered scarf, a battered paperback novel, and a small, dusty backpack.

My hand brushes against something solid, and I pull out a flashlight. I turn it on, and to my surprise, it still works. The dim beam of the flashlight illuminates the confined space.

Mei cautiously steps inside, her eyes adjusting to the light.

"Any clues?" she asks, her voice a hushed whisper. I shake my head, scanning the interior. "Nothing that makes sense. It's like this bus crashed, and then everything just stopped."

"Do you think this bus got trapped on this road too?"

"Seems like it. But it was definitely a crash. And... well, there's no sign of any... bodies here."

I take another thorough look around the bus, scrutinizing the driver's seat, peering under each seat with the flashlight, and even inspecting the ceiling with a glimmer of hope. However, there's nothing of value here—just trash and debris. Mei pulls on a scarf she finds on the floor. It's dusty, but it's better than nothing.

I'm unwilling to accept that we still lack any understanding of what's happening here. Yet, there seems to be no other place to search. Or—

"Look, a postcard," Mei calls out. I glance at the postcard in her hands. It appears almost intact, nearly new, featuring a picture of a mountain landscape. Mei turns it over, revealing Italian writing on the back.

"Do you understand anything in Italian?"

"Nope. Just the date."

I also notice the date marked on the postcard. October 24, 2003.

"An old postcard? Or has the bus been stranded here for all these years?"

Nausea intensifies within me.

We walk back to the car in silence, guided by the torchlight. Mei leads the way, her face obscured, but the quiet sobs betray her tears. I wish I could find words to comfort her, but in the midst of this uncertainty, what can I possibly say?

Truthfully, instead of offering comfort, I find myself constantly reproaching her. The tension has made me unusually on edge.

We settle into the still-warm interior of our Ford. Shall we go? But where to?

Mei sniffs, her nose still tinged with the aftermath of tears. "What do you think we're going to do?"

"I don't know. I'm not even sure if it's worth wasting gas on another senseless trip. All we seem to encounter is that damn gas station."

"At least we know we'll find it—whichever way we go."

I emit a nervous chuckle, then consider the situation.

"If the road looks identical in both directions, maybe we shouldn't take it."

"What are you suggesting?"

"We'll navigate through the woods."
