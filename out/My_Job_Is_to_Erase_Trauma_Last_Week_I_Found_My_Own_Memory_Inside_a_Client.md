Part 1 — The Memory Architect

They call me a Memory Architect, but the truth is less poetic than it sounds.

I don’t build memories. I delete them.

For the past seven years, I’ve worked at Mnemosyne Labs, a private clinic in the city that helps people “move on” from their trauma. We use a proprietary process that isolates the neural signature of emotional pain and dissolves it, like scraping rust off an old machine.

The public knows us through clean ads — smiling faces, soft piano music, and slogans like “Because healing deserves help.”
But no one really understands what happens in that white, windowless room on the 12th floor.

And I’m not allowed to talk about it.


Every patient signs a double-consent form: one for treatment, and one that binds me to silence. Even mentioning a client’s name can void my entire career. But this… what happened last week… I can’t keep it bottled up anymore.

Because I think I may have found something that shouldn’t exist.
A memory that belongs to me.
Inside someone else.


Before any deletion, we run memory maps — an interactive scan of a client’s mind. The patient sits in a chair surrounded by a halo of sensors while I monitor a holographic field of neural pathways projected in front of me.

It looks beautiful — a glowing coral reef of electrical storms, each pulse representing a memory cluster. You learn to read it like a language: the erratic flashes of fear, the slow pulses of nostalgia, the dense red swirls of trauma.

We never erase a whole event. We only target the emotional layer attached to it. That’s what makes the procedure legal.

For example, if you were in a car crash, we wouldn’t delete the memory of the accident — you’d still know it happened. But you wouldn’t feel the panic anymore when you remember it.

It’s supposed to help people heal.

But lately, I’ve begun to wonder if healing and forgetting are the same thing.


Last Monday, I received a new assignment: Case #A-91324.
Female, 32. Name: Evelyn Shaw.

Her intake file was thin — unusual for trauma clients. Usually, they come with a thick stack of psychological profiles and history. Evelyn had one sheet of paper:

> “Primary Complaint: Recurrent nightmares. Possible traumatic memory imprint. Patient unaware of source.”



That last line caught my eye — unaware of source. Most people know what they want erased. Evelyn didn’t even know why she was suffering.

When she arrived, she didn’t look like a trauma patient. Her face was calm, her posture precise, her eyes... too still. Like someone rehearsing emotion.

“Mr. Voss?” she asked softly. “You’re the one who helps people forget?”

“Only the pain,” I said.

She smiled faintly. “Then that’s all I want.”


During memory mapping, I guide patients through recall prompts. My voice triggers the neural response while the system highlights active emotional nodes.

I started simple:

> “Think about your earliest memory.”



> “Now your happiest.”



> “Now the one that still wakes you at night.”



Her neural field bloomed from soft gold to violent red. The trauma node spiked sharply in her mid-temporal lobe — the memory hub for visual and emotional storage.

On the screen, I saw faint static lines running through it — noise patterns I’d only seen once before. They looked like electrical scars, evidence of prior interference.

Someone had already erased part of this memory.

I leaned closer. “Evelyn… have you ever had this kind of treatment before?”

She hesitated. “Maybe. I don’t remember.”

That answer chilled me.

Because that’s exactly what an erasure subject would say.


As the machine stabilized, I asked her to describe what she was seeing.

> “There’s… a room,” she said slowly. “It’s white. Cold. There’s a humming sound. Like… machines?”


I felt my throat tighten.

That’s our clinic room.

> “Someone’s standing near me,” she whispered. “He’s saying something… his voice—”



The monitors flickered. The emotional spikes grew erratic.

> “He says… ‘It’s going to be alright, Evelyn.’”



She gasped. Her hands trembled.

> “I can’t see his face. Just—just his eyes. They’re—”



The system alarm blared. The neural feedback loop went unstable. I had to manually shut down the mapping sequence before she suffered cognitive shock.

Evelyn slumped forward, breathing hard.

I tried to calm her. “It’s okay, it’s over. You’re safe.”

But my hands were shaking.

Because that was my voice she described.
Word for word.


I stayed late reviewing the recording. The system logs all sensory data from each mapping — visual, auditory, and emotional resonance patterns.

When I replayed the segment where she described the voice, the waveform alignment nearly stopped my heart.

It matched my own speech pattern, down to the pitch and timing signature.

I cross-referenced it with archived files. Nothing. No record of a previous session with her. No erased logs. No hidden data.

But the timestamp of her trauma’s origin — the neural decay signature — was six years old.

That’s the same year I joined Mnemosyne.


Every Architect hears rumors about the Vault, the secure offline archive where the company stores high-risk memory data — the ones too unstable or dangerous to delete entirely.

Access requires two executive keys.

But I know a backdoor. Everyone in R&D does.

I shouldn’t have done it, but curiosity ate through my fear. I used an old encryption script and logged in as a ghost user.

Inside the Vault, there were thousands of files labeled by numerical IDs, not names. But one code caught my eye: A-91324-EV-SHAW-2019.

The file size was massive — multiple terabytes, which meant it wasn’t just text data. It contained full sensory memory reconstruction.

When I opened it, my monitors flooded with images.

I saw Evelyn strapped to a chair — terrified, screaming, begging someone to stop.
A man’s shadow stood over her, adjusting the headgear.

And then I heard the voice again.

“It’s going to be alright, Evelyn.”

My voice.

Exactly.


I don’t remember ever treating her. But six years ago, there’s a gap in my employment log — six months I can’t account for. HR says it was a medical leave. I don’t remember being sick.

I thought maybe it was burnout, maybe the system glitched my own records. But after watching that footage, I realized something horrifying:

Someone erased my memory of her.

Which means I’ve been one of my own clients.


When Evelyn came back for her second session, I couldn’t look her in the eye.

She seemed calmer, almost too calm. “Did I do well last time?” she asked.

“Yes,” I said. “Very well.”

“I keep dreaming of the same room,” she continued softly. “But it feels… different now. Familiar.”

I swallowed. “Do you remember anything else?”

She tilted her head. “Just… you. Your voice. You said you’d help me forget. But now I think… maybe I don’t want to.”

Her words hit me like static in my skull.

She shouldn’t remember me. Not if her erasure was complete.

Unless… it was never meant to be.


That night, I found something in my locker.
A cassette tape. No label, just the word “PLAY” scratched into the plastic.

I didn’t recognize the handwriting.

When I played it, there was heavy breathing, then a man’s voice. My voice.

> “If you’re hearing this, Arin, it means the cycle has begun again. Do not trust Evelyn Shaw. She isn’t your patient. She’s your mirror.”



I froze.

> “They used your neural signature to stabilize her implant. You erased her memory once. Then they erased yours to cover it. The system loops every six years to maintain equilibrium.”



The tape ended with a mechanical click.

I sat there for a long time, the hum of the servers filling the silence.

I don’t know what scared me more — the fact that someone had predicted this moment…
or that it sounded exactly like me.


When I returned to the lab, security was tighter than usual. Two men in black suits were talking to my supervisor outside the neural bay. They stopped when they saw me.

“Mr. Voss,” one said. “We need to speak privately.”

He handed me an envelope. Inside was a termination notice — effective immediately.

No explanation. Just:

> “Your services are no longer required. Please surrender all company property.”



I wasn’t surprised. Somehow, I knew this was coming.

Before leaving, I checked Evelyn’s file one last time.

But her entire record was gone.
Deleted.

Like she never existed.

I’m writing this from a rented apartment across town. My hands still shake when I type.

Every night, I dream of that white room — the hum of the machines, the glow of the halo.

And I hear my voice saying the same words:
“It’s going to be alright, Evelyn.”

But here’s the thing — sometimes, when I wake up…
I see her sitting at the edge of my bed.

Smiling.

And she whispers back:
“It’s your turn now.”
