The night’s events clawed at my thoughts as I drove home. I pulled into a gas station and grabbed a single bottle of distilled water. The ritual’s instructions throbbed in my mind, each step syncing with my pulse, pulling me closer to a line I knew I could never uncross.

The cashier looked at me twice. I couldn’t blame him—who the hell shows up at seven in the morning in a black suit, eyes bloodshot, veins thrumming under their skin, just to buy water? I must’ve looked like your local crazy lady.

Back home, I lined everything up on the counter: the bottle. The knife. Rubbing alcohol. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking as I sterilized the blade, like if I moved fast enough, I could cut away the dread with it.

After two breakdowns. Three half-muttered arguments with myself. I stopped thinking.

I drove the knife into my palm.

Pain tore through me—bright, blinding, electric. My breath locked in my throat as I forced my hand open, watching the blood spill.

Except… it wasn’t blood. Not like I remembered.

I’ve bled before. I know the color, the thickness, the smell. But this was wrong. Too dark. Too heavy. It crawled from the wound instead of flowing, slick and black like oil pulled from the earth.

The drops hit the water, and instantly it churned—swirling, blooming outward like smoke in glass, until the whole bottle pulsed with a sickly red light.

I didn’t hesitate. I couldn’t.

I drank.

The taste was jagged metal, raw iron, thick enough to chew. My stomach lurched, my throat spasmed, but I forced it down. Every drop.

Then came the fire.

The wound flared white-hot, pain ripping up my arm until my vision broke into static. I staggered, clutching my wrist, watching in horror as the cut sealed itself shut. Skin knit over muscle in seconds, smooth and unbroken. The suit clung to me, tightening, alive against my body, whispering its approval.

By the time the burning faded, there was nothing left but skin. No scar. No proof. Just the afterimage of agony—and the heavy certainty that the ritual had worked.

That it had changed me.

The final step was simple: stay hungry until nightfall. I thought it would be impossible—my stomach gnawing itself raw, hours dragging like years.

But the hunger never came.

I didn’t feel hungry at all.

Instead, there was only dryness. My lips cracked, my throat scraped raw. I could drink, but food… the thought of food felt foreign, unnecessary. My stomach sat silent, too silent, like something had switched it off entirely.

By noon, I realized I hadn’t thought about eating once.

This wasn’t willpower. This wasn’t discipline.

It was the ritual hollowing me out—scraping away hunger, scraping away humanity—until all that was left was thirst. Not a person. Not anymore. Just a vessel, waiting to be filled.

**10 p.m.**

I slid into the suit again, its weight clinging to me like a second skin, and drove in silence. The dagger in my pocket pulsed against my leg like a second heartbeat, thrumming louder with every mile closer to Evergrove.

Somewhere deep inside, I knew there was no way out. Acceptance had settled in me, cold and heavy—the last stage of grief.

But acceptance wasn’t surrender.

I wasn’t walking into Evergrove Market to survive anymore.

I was walking in to kill it. To rip the place apart from the inside. To drag the Night Manager down with me.

If this was the end, it would be my revenge.

When I pulled into the lot, Dante was already there, leaning against his motorcycle. He straightened the second my headlights hit him and slid into the passenger seat without a word.

We sat there in silence for ten long minutes, the store looming in front of us like it was waiting.

I thought about the first night—how every nerve in my body had screamed to turn back, to run, to *live.* But desperation had shoved me through those doors then. And it was desperation that would shove me back through them tonight.

“Explosives,” Dante said suddenly, breaking the silence. “I planted them all around the store.”

My head snapped toward him. “Explosives? How the hell did you even—”

“They’re homemade,” he cut in, eyes flicking away.

“And you just *know* how to make bombs?” I pressed.

He hesitated, his jaw tightening. “Because I used to work for—” He stopped himself, teeth grinding, and turned away. Whatever it was, he wasn’t ready to say. Maybe he never would.

I stared at him, realizing we all carried secrets in this place. Some too heavy to name.

Dante shifted, forcing his voice steady. “We’ll survive this, Remi. Both of us. I promise.”

I heard the desperation in his voice, but I couldn’t bring myself to look him in the eyes. Not when I knew the truth.

“Run, Dante.” My voice was quiet, almost drowned out by the hum of the car. “When I kill the Night Manager, it’ll be too late for me. Save yourself. Burn the store down.”

I stepped out of the car without another word. Dante followed, our footsteps crunching in unison across the empty lot until we crossed the threshold of the store.

The old man was nowhere in sight.

But the building itself was… wrong.

The air buzzed faintly, like static crawling just beneath my skin. The overhead lights flickered, not in rhythm but in jagged pulses, like the store was breathing unevenly. Even the clock was different—silent now, its steady thumping from the night before gone, as if time itself had stalled.

“Dante,” I whispered, my voice swallowed by the humming air. “Let’s find a ladder.”

He nodded, and together we moved deeper into the aisles, the shelves leaning as though watching us pass.

We searched for nearly forty minutes, every aisle beginning to blur together, the hum of the lights drilling into my skull. Just when I started to think the store was mocking us, Dante called out.

“Here.”

I turned. He was standing by the janitor’s closet, tugging a small ladder free from behind a stack of buckets. It wasn’t tall, but it was just enough.

We dragged it beneath the clock, the silence around us thick as stone. Ten minutes left until 11. Ten minutes before the shift began.

I went up first, the ladder creaking under my weight, Dante steadying it below. My hand brushed the clock’s edge, cold and trembling with some current I couldn’t place. Then I saw it—just behind the clock, a tile, not flush with the ceiling but slightly lifted, shifted out of place.

I pressed it. It moved.

My stomach twisted. Because behind it wasn’t insulation, wasn’t wood beams—wasn’t anything that should’ve existed.

It was an opening.

An attic.

But that was impossible. Evergrove was a single-story building. I knew that. I’d walked the outside more times than I cared to count.

And yet here it was—black space yawning above me.

I didn’t hesitate. I climbed through, pulling myself into the void, the air colder, stiller, wronger than anything below.

Dante followed, his boots scraping the ladder before he hauled himself up beside me.

We were inside the attic of a building that wasn’t supposed to have one.

The attic wasn’t dark like I expected. It was lit—faintly, unnervingly—as if someone actually lived here. A lantern flickered on a desk, casting shadows that stretched too far, too thin. Beside it sat a book.

The Ledger.

The same one I’d seen locked inside the cabinet downstairs.

I wanted to touch it, to open it, but there wasn’t time. The ritual wasn’t about books—it was about finding the heart. So Dante and I searched, pacing around the cramped attic. Nothing. Just that desk. Just that cursed book.

Then—

The clock chimed.

11 p.m. Shift time.

And before I could breathe, we heard it.

Footsteps.

Slow, heavy, deliberate. Not coming from the ladder—but deeper in the attic. Somewhere no one should’ve been.

There was nowhere to hide except beneath the desk. We dropped down, pressing ourselves into the shadows, hearts thundering in sync with the ticking above.

The footsteps drew closer.

Then he appeared.

The Night Manager.

But he didn’t look like the flawless monster I’d seen before. His edges were slipping. His skin sagged, human, mottled with gray. His suit hung loose, imperfect. His presence was still crushing, but weaker somehow, as if the glamour was rotting away.

And then I saw it.

Around his neck hung a massive locket, pulsing with life. Veins coiled across its surface, feeding into his skin. It thumped in real time—like a heart torn from some ancient beast, sealed into metal. The glow was faint, sickly green, every pulse wet and nauseating.

My stomach lurched. Dante whispered, almost gagging, “What the hell is that…”

I grabbed his arm, silencing him before he could ruin us both.

The Night Manager stopped. Six feet away. His head tilted, nostrils flaring.

And then, in a voice low and rasping, he said:

“I know you’re here, Remi…”

Every muscle in my body locked. My lungs refused to move, my throat dry as bone. Beside me, Dante’s whole frame trembled, his breath quick and shallow.

The Night Manager didn’t crouch down. He didn’t rip the tablecloth away. He just stood there—six feet from us—his ruined skin glistening in the lantern glow, that pulsing locket thumping against his chest.

Then he moved.

Slowly.

Each step measured, heavy, dragging across the warped boards of the attic. His shoes scraped against the wood in a rhythm that felt deliberate, taunting.

“I can smell you,” he rasped. “That stink of borrowed courage. That suit wrapped around your fear.”

His hand grazed the desk. For a terrible second, I thought he’d lift the cloth and find us. Instead, he traced the Ledger with a long, gray finger, almost lovingly. The veins in the locket pulsed harder, like it fed on his touch.

Dante clenched his fists, shaking, whispering something that was barely breathing. I pressed down hard on his knee, begging him not to move.

The Night Manager circled the desk. His shadow cut across us, vast and warped, spilling under the table. My heart rammed my ribs, but I didn’t breathe. I couldn’t.

Then—his shoes stopped inches from my face.

Silence.

He leaned down—not enough to see us, but close enough that I felt the weight of his gaze burn through the wood. His voice dripped down like poison.

“Do you think you can take it from me? This heart has beaten longer than nations. Longer than gods. And you think you’ll cut it free with a toy knife?”

The locket throbbed, louder now, like it was laughing with him.

And then—

The table lurched.

The Night Manager’s clawed hand clamped down and wrenched it aside in one violent motion, lantern light spilling across us. His face was inches away—eyes raw and bloodshot, teeth gnashing like broken glass.

I didn’t think. I just moved.

“Run!” I shouted, shoving Dante toward the far side of the attic. We bolted as the Night Manager screeched, the sound ripping through the attic like metal tearing.

“Do you think you can kill me?!”

His voice wasn’t human anymore—it was layered, jagged, as if a dozen throats shrieked at once. The floorboards shook under his steps as he charged after us, the veins in the locket flaring green, casting sickly light across the walls.

Dante grabbed my arm, pulling me toward the opening above the clock, but the Night Manager’s laughter followed, echoing in the rafters.

“You’re nothing but a vessel, Remi. A hollow thing. You think you’ll end me with that little blade?”

The dagger in my pocket throbbed hotter than ever, like it wanted out, like it was straining against my flesh to answer him.

The Night Manager lunged, claws slashing inches from my shoulder.

And then—the suit acted.

Not my conscious choice. Not my muscles. The black fabric along my arms and chest tightened like living steel, coiling around me, pushing me forward. My legs moved before my mind could catch up, vaulting over a fallen crate, skidding past Dante, toward the night manager.

The dagger pulsed, thrumming like a second heartbeat, and I felt it *resonate* with the suit. Every strike the Night Manager made was anticipated. Every shadow that tried to grab me twisted aside, the fabric stiffening like armor, like a predator of its own.

“Remi…what are you doing!!!!!” Dante shouted, as I ran towards the night manager.

The Night Manager hissed, frustration rolling off him in waves. “What… what trickery is this?!”

I didn’t answer. I just ran—upturned boxes sliding under my feet, lantern light scattering like fireflies—and felt the suit guide me, weaving between obstacles, almost *showing me the path*.

The suit guided me toward the locket, pulsing and tightening around me, when suddenly the Night Manager’s eyes flared with fury.

From the shadows, he summoned him—The Pale Man.

A nightmare of limbs and teeth, lunging at me with terrifying speed. I barely had time to react, the clawed hands missing me by inches.

“Dante!” I yelled.

He dove into the fray, throwing whatever he could at the Pale Man, buying me precious seconds. That’s when it hit me—we weren't alone here. 

“Selene! Stacy! John! Please… help!” I screamed into the void, desperation raw.

Above me, the attic ceiling cracked as skittering sounds grew louder. Stacy. Her spider-like form, the same creature that had once hunted me, dropped from above. In a heartbeat, she lunged at the Pale Man, fangs and claws shredding him, tearing one of his arms apart.

It happened so fast it almost didn’t feel real. Ten seconds, maybe less. And then—the Night Manager, sensing her threat, ripped one of her legs off, her scream echoing through the attic. I knew she couldn’t take him down alone.

The suit had gone still—no guidance this time. My heart pounded in my chest. I ran.

Stacy struck again, claws flashing, but the Night Manager’s iron grip locked around her arms, pinning her in place. Selene and Jack appeared in a blur, seizing each of his legs while Stacy kept both his arms occupied. The suit surged, snaking through me, forcing my hands to move with the precision of a memory I had stolen—the one I’d traded my most precious moment to obtain.

I moved without hesitation. The dagger struck—both legs, then an arm. The Night Manager bellowed, tossing us aside like ragdolls. I slammed into the floor, Stacy cushioning my fall. She sprang back instantly, a blur of skittering limbs, keeping him locked in a desperate struggle.

But then he turned, choking Selene while Jack and Dante fought the Pale Man elsewhere. The weight of it hit me—this fight was spiraling, and there was no room for mistakes.

I slid low between them, my fingers closing around the locket at his chest. It pulsed violently, green veins beating against my palm. I yanked it free, adrenaline burning through me.

“Dante! The ladder!” I screamed.

He was already there, one hand outstretched, urging me to run. I lunged—

—and the Night Manager’s grip clamped around my leg.

I looked back. His hand crushed my ankle, while the other—still slick and bleeding from where I’d stabbed it—clamped around Stacy’s head. And with a sickening crack, he split her skull open, her body twitching violently in his grasp.

Rage and terror fused into one. I drove the dagger down, stabbing through his hand, and then I planted the blade straight into the heart itself.

The dagger pierced deep.

The Heart didn’t just bleed—it erupted. A blinding green light seared the attic, latching onto my hand like molten chains. My vision blurred, colors bending, reality stuttering as if the store itself screamed. The Night Manager’s shrieks rattled through the beams, inhuman and endless, a sound like the world being torn apart.

The Heart pulsed, veins crawling up my arm, merging with me. Every throb was a command: *Stay. Belong. Never leave.*

Dante’s hands closed around me, dragging me toward the ladder as my body fought to resist. “Come on, Remi!” he roared, half desperation, half defiance.

But the store had me. My feet slid against the wood as the clock’s gravity pulled me back, the Heart burning brighter with every step. I caught Dante’s eyes. There was despair there—but beneath it, something harder. A fire.

I wanted—no, *needed*—him to survive. For me. For us both. Maybe he understood. Maybe he’d already chosen.

“Guess we’re both going,” Dante said, voice steady as he reached for the detonator. “It was good to know you.”

The button clicked.

The world convulsed. Explosions thundered outside, ripping through walls and shattering glass. The store screamed louder than the Night Manager ever had. Beams cracked. Flames roared. The clock itself shuddered and fell, its face splintering across the floor.

The pull on me broke. The Heart spasmed in my hand, fighting me, before going still.

Fire engulfed everything as Dante dragged me through the collapsing aisles toward the exit.

That’s when the floodlights snapped on.

Not the police. Not fire trucks. Not rescue.

Five matte-black vans cut through the night, engines idling low, faceless. Their doors slammed open in eerie unison, and figures spilled out—too fast, too precise.

They weren’t soldiers. They weren’t cops. They were something else.

Their gear was stripped of insignia, black armor that seemed grown, not forged. Their helmets had mirrored visors, no eye contact, no humanity. Even the way they moved—silent, efficient—felt rehearsed, like puppets on invisible strings.

One grabbed me, the grip iron-tight, forcing the Heart out of my fingers into a waiting case that hissed shut on its own. Another stepped forward, snapping to attention. “We are here, sir.”

*Sir.*

I blinked, dazed, watching as the soldier addressed—not a commander, not some hidden superior—but Dante.

He straightened, shoulders squaring in a way I’d never seen before. No trace of the ragged, desperate friend I thought I knew. Just cold authority.

But then he smiled at me, a familiar, reassuring curve that felt like the Dante I knew—my friend, not just an ally in this chaos. “Take care of her”, he said softly, almost like he was looking out for me. His eyes met mine, warm and steady, carrying the weight of everything we’d survived together. “We’ll meet again, Remi.”

The soldiers’ hands gripped me, lifting me effortlessly as Dante stepped back, eyes locked on mine. I tried to reach for him, to call out, but no sound came—my voice swallowed by exhaustion pressing in from every direction. The edges of my vision folded inward, the world narrowing. The last thing I saw was Dante, standing there, watching as they dragged me into the waiting van.

Then—black.

I woke up just now, typing this on my phone. The nurse said I’ve been in a coma for four days. She won’t answer any other questions. The room is white, sterile, with no windows, no other patients. I still believe in Dante…The nurse mentioned he’ll meet me tomorrow morning. She didn’t say *no*, but I have a feeling it won’t be good and a part of me wonders if I ever will be the same again.

I just hope I heal—because I haven’t been hungry in so long, I’m not even sure I’m still human.
