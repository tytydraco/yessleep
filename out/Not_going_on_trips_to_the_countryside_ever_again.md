I was on a solo road trip, just a quick escape to clear my mind. It was late afternoon, and I was driving through a quiet part of the countryside—empty fields and dense trees on either side, with barely another car in sight. I’d been on the road for hours when I saw a motel that looked a bit run down but not too shabby, there were cars parked and a couple of people outside so I thought I might stay the night.  
  
I pulled in and parked near the front office. An older woman came out to greet me, her hair a soft gray, face kind but worn. “Looking for a place to stay?” she asked, she was nice and gentle, seemed really welcoming so I was really positive about the place.

“Yes, just for the night,” I said, already feeling relieved to be off the road.

She handed me an actual key, not a card, and offered a room in the main building, just next to her house. “I don’t usually get many guests this time of year,” she said with a small smile. “Would you like some dinner, too? It’s no trouble.”

I agreed, and she led me inside. The place was old but cozy in its own way, like someone had lived there forever. She made a simple stew, and we ate in her small dining room, filled with old books and faded pictures. She was kind, even chatty, talking about her family, the town, and how she’d run this place her whole life. I felt oddly comfortable, like I’d known her for years.

As we finished eating, she looked at the clock—it was close to 8 p.m.—and her face turned serious. “One last thing,” she said, her voice low. “After 8, don’t laugh please, it's our polcy here."

I stared at her, waiting for her to laugh it off, but she didn’t. She kept her gaze steady. She told me not to disregard what she'd just told me, and that she was really serious about it. I forced a nervous smile, hoping it was some local superstition. “Why's that though?” I asked, but she didn’t answer. She just gave me a small, knowing nod and showed me to my room.

Back in my room, I tried to brush off her words, chalking it up to her quirky personality or maybe just a joke that went too far. Still, something about the way she said it stuck with me, making it hard to relax. I was scrolling through my phone to distract myself when I heard it—a faint laugh outside, drifting through the evening air.

I froze, heart pounding. It was faint, but there was something… odd about it. It didn’t sound like kids playing or even adults laughing naturally. It was off-pitch, hollow, as if someone was forcing themselves to laugh. I told myself it was just my imagination, just echoes in the trees, but then the laughter grew louder.

It moved around the building, slow and deliberate, until it was right outside my window. My skin prickled as I realized it sounded like… me. The same tone, the same cadence as if someone was mimicking my laugh but getting it just slightly wrong.

Then, I heard a single knock at the window, slow and deliberate. I felt every muscle in my body tense, too afraid to even breathe. Another knock followed, and then another, louder this time, as if something was pressing itself against the glass. I wanted to peek, to see if anyone was there, but a deep instinct kept me frozen, every nerve screaming *don’t look*.

The laughter continued, louder and closer, different voices joining in, each one sounding like a warped version of my own. I clamped my hand over my mouth, heart racing as I tried not to make a sound. I didn’t know why, but I felt certain that if I laughed, something terrible would happen.

Hours dragged by. At some point, the knocking stopped, and the laughter faded into silence. I must have dozed off in a state of exhausted fear, because when I opened my eyes, it was morning.

I stumbled out of the room, desperate to leave. The old woman was waiting for me at the front desk, looking calm, almost relieved.

“Did you laugh?” she asked, her voice soft.

I shook my head, still too shaken to speak. She nodded, a faint smile on her face. “Good. Some people… don’t listen.”

I didn’t ask anything else, didn’t want to know. I just thanked her and left as quickly as I could, trying to shake off the eerie feeling that followed me out of the driveway.

For days after I got home, I couldn’t bring myself to laugh. Every time I felt a laugh coming, I’d remember the hollow sound of that laughter outside my window, circling, waiting. Living alone, it was easy to stay silent, to keep myself from laughing—just in case something was still listening.
