**Part 1**

&#x200B;

"Three months. That's how much you have left."

"...What if I try the new chemotherapy you mentioned earlier?"

"I'm afraid it won't be that effective. It has already spread to the lungs, so chemo is no longer an option."

&#x200B;

Cancer. In my pancreas, and now to my lungs. Oh lord, I muttered. I've been cursing at those chemos that looked like pure filth until just a few weeks ago, and here I am now, begging for another trial. 

&#x200B;

"But we could at least give it a try and see how it goes, can't we? It surely must help in *some* way."

&#x200B;

True. Disgusting as it may be, that thing had been keeping me alive for quite some time. But maybe not anymore.

&#x200B;

"Your body," the doctor started carefully, "has reached its limit. It can no longer take in those powerful drugs. If you want the chemo so badly that you're willing to take risks, I won't stop you. But it would be safer if you didn't."

&#x200B;

Yeah, a safer way toward death, I thought.

&#x200B;

"Mr.Rider? It's time for your meal. May I help you to your ward?"

&#x200B;

A nurse had entered the room without me noticing her. Startled by her voice, I spun around and saw a tall, fit woman with blond hair and heavy makeup. She was hard to be unnoticed. Could it be that those bloody cancer cells were finally starting to sap the strength out of my senses, eating away my body?

&#x200B;

"I'm fine. I can help myself."

&#x200B;

I dragged my feet towards the door, closed it, and shuffled to my ward. Within my blurry vision, I saw one of my gowns lying on the floor. I bent down for it and found a rusty name tag under the bed that read: Ken Rider, 32 years old. It was almost a year old. My new name tag read: Ken Rider, 33 years old.

&#x200B;

"Thirty-three," I read out loud. What a young age to die. 

&#x200B;

Skipping dinner, I cuddled into the blanket and closed my eyes for what would be my last night here in this hospital. I'm leaving this ward tomorrow, I told myself. If, of course, I can make it through this night alive. 

&#x200B;

The very cause of my cancer, I can say with certainty, is because of the horrible bullying I had to suffer during middle school. There were six of them - six that I can remember, at least - who were lucky enough to find a nice human toy on which they could fully express their growing sense of teenage violence. The damage they have done to me in physical terms is one thing; my real trauma was getting mentally devastated. They would beat me almost every day until my nose cracked and my teeth fell out, and even then they couldn't be more excited to think of another way for me to compensate for the loss of their entertainment. I've tried my best to fight them, but to no avail. The only result of my desperate struggle against them was the dreadful feeling of impotence and isolation, and that terrible sensation strangled me all throughout my lifetime, leaving lethal scars every day and every night. It is those scars that had turned into cancer which has now grown too big and too deadly for me to deal with. Alex. Kevin. The two names I remember until now. The two names most responsible for my current state.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Please, Alex. This is insane. I can't do this, I'm sorry."

Slap. My left cheek which had been already bruised started swelling up, making it hard for me to see.

&#x200B;

"Do not test my patience and do it, for the sake of everyone to cared enough to come all the way here to watch your show."

&#x200B;

The entire crowd was giggling, some even filming me with their phones, and none of them seemed to be willing to stop this horrific show until I finished the mission. Beside my trembling right foot lay Coco, my beloved cat. She was more than just a family. She was a soulmate. There was no way I could do it. No way I could hack her to death. I dropped the knife I had been holding and hugged Coco.

&#x200B;

"I'll do anything else you tell me to do," I whimpered, "but not this. How can I - "

At that moment, I heard something crack inside my head. Then the world began to spin around me. As my legs went limp I hit the ground head first with a heavy thud, then my shoulders, and fell unconscious. 

&#x200B;

Whether it was the bitter taste of blood inside my mouth or the hissing of Coco that woke me up, I cannot remember, but the first thing I saw after opening my eyes was the horrific scene of Coco being bound with a rope. Alex was working on her hind legs, binding the ropes so hard that her paws had already turned purple. Behind him was Alex's best friend, Kevin, holding a bucket of red paint. He was laughing in a way that seemed to be spooking Coco off, shaking his head left and right every few seconds. Then he fixed his eyes upon her, gestured Alex to get out of the way, and splashed the paint all over her. 

&#x200B;

"Well well... now she needs some grooming, doesn't she?" Kevin giggled.

"Looks like we have the perfect tool for that!" Alex replied, already excited to see how I would react. He picked up the knife I had dropped and marched forward.  

&#x200B;

My heart sank, and I cried out, "Stop!!! Please, Please Alex! I'll do anything, everything you want!! I swear!!!"

But they didn't seem to hear me. I had to yell harder. 

&#x200B;

"Please leave her alone, you've got *me!!!* She has nothing to do with you!! SOMEBODY STOP HIM!!!"

With Coco's horrible screeching, I flew out of bed and smashed my forehead against the window on the left. That's when I had it clear. 

&#x200B;

'I've got to kill them. Alex especially, that son of a bitch who ruined my entire life just for fun. That's the one thing I must finish before I die.'

Panting and sweating, I stormed out of the ward and splashed my face with cold water. 

'I don't have much time, and I can't do this alone. I'll have to look for a partner.'

&#x200B;

Thinking of a partner, I was reminded of a classmate named Jack who had also been bullied heavily by Alex and his friends. Although not best friends, Jack and I were still good friends. A friend close enough to share our hurtful feelings toward them. Yes, Jack. He is the one. He could be the ideal one for this job. The perfect partner to help me out. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Part 2**

&#x200B;

For the first time after being diagnosed with cancer, I found myself a clear goal, a goal that gave me endless energy and spirit. I commissioned a famous detective agency to figure out the tiniest details about Alex's life, and after about a month I had my plans roughly set up. My best chance would be hiding near his workplace and knocking him out with a taser on his way home, but there was a problem. Alex was working for a mayor in the countryside as his private secretary, which meant I had to keep a close eye on the mayor somehow as well. If his secretary went missing for even a short while, that would mean trouble. Severe trouble. 

&#x200B;

"Which is where Jack kicks in," I mumbled. Jack was the leader of a management team working for the country's biggest shipping company, and according to the news, there seemed to be an upcoming conference regarding the problems of illegal shipping that all mayors had to attend. If Jack could figure out when and where the conference would be held, things could be much easier. The mayor would be too busy to care even if Alex went missing. So I decided to meet Jack in front of his house and ask for what I needed. 

&#x200B;

After waiting about an hour on the bench in front of Jack's garden, I saw his car emerge and waved my right hand. In my other hand were reports from the detective agency about Alex and a medicine packet including some morphine painkillers. I had to sell him that I was in desperate need of his help. Jack got out of the car and headed towards me with unexpected company. A wife. 

'Gee,' I thought. 'I didn't know he was married.'

&#x200B;

Shivering in the cold weather with his hand tightly holding his wife's, Jack presented an awkward smile to greet me. He had this weird way of talking with a vague expression of reluctance since middle school, which was one of the things Alex would always prey on for excuse. An excuse to beat him up.

&#x200B;

"Hey.. it's been quite a while... since we met. You've never met Sarah before, have you..?" 

I shook my head, hiding what I brought behind my back. I couldn't show this in front of his wife.

&#x200B;

"Honey, who is he? Is he a friend of yours? Or a colleague, maybe?" the wife asked.

"Um... haven't I told you about him either..? Haha..... seems like I haven't. Well, it's never too late to start knowing each other. Greetings." Jack replied, this time his face trembling heavily as well. Sarah shook my hands, laughed shortly about how Jack was always having trouble when it came to dealing with people, and went inside, leaving Jack by my side. 

&#x200B;

"So.. what is it...?" Jack asked nervously.

I looked at him for a while, took a deep breath, and started explaining. 

&#x200B;

By the time I was finished, Jack was dumbstruck. His vision was fixed on the ground and I could see his head spinning, scouring madly for any possible flaws that I might have missed while setting up my plan. When he finally decided to speak, his voice was so tiny I had to lean over right next to him to hear his words properly.

&#x200B;

"Look, I.. I have a family. Sarah is going to become a mother soon.. and I don't want to ruin their lives for the sake of my personal revenge. I'm sorry... really sorry.. that I can't help you with this.."

&#x200B;

I sighed. Not a sigh of disappointment, but a sigh of utter disbelief. How could it be possible that Jack and I, raised and taught in the same environment during our entire teenagehood, have become such different adults just after about a decade? And apart from that, how on earth was Jack finding it okay to let go of the perfect chance of revenge against the bastard who had wrecked his entire school life? Didn't he have the slightest feeling of anger or rage inside of him? 

&#x200B;

"Jack," I spoke flatly, "the way you speak and the way you smile, that weird expression of yours, isn't that your terrible aftermath of getting bullied? And your right leg too. You can't walk properly even until now after they broke your knees. Do you not see that they have damaged our lives permanently, yours physically and mine mentally?"

&#x200B;

Silence fell. Jack's shoulders were trembling - in fact, his whole body had been trembling this entire time during my visit - and I could see him restart the tug of war inside his mind, hopefully, this time leading to a better conclusion. 

&#x200B;

"Well.. there is one thing... just one thing I can do to help you out. I know the details... about the conference schedule.. you know, for the shipping. It's this Saturday afternoon... it starts at 3 PM and ends at... at like 8 PM or something. I'll double-check."

&#x200B;

I looked at him, my eyes widening. This guy was finally getting the gist of what I was talking about.

"And where is it held?" I asked. 

&#x200B;

"In a city far away from Alex's hometown," Jack replied. In his voice flew a scent of seriousness I had never felt before, which gave credibility.

"Where exactly? Do you know the location?"

"I'm not sure, but you don't have to worry about that. The conference is highly confidential, so Alex will probably be left out the entire day, which means he's likely to have a day off. Away from his mayor, you see... for quite some time."

&#x200B;

Now that, I remarked, is a precious piece of information. Not as critical as I had hoped, but still worth taking in. 3 PM to 8 PM, Saturday, far away from hometown. 3 PM, 8 PM, Saturday, far away from hometown. I scribbled the words inside my head to make sure they didn't slip away.

&#x200B;

"Alright, thanks. That's very helpful."

"One last thing. Ken, promise me something when you meet Alex. Finish him off in the most painful way, will you? Do it instead of me... and for yourself as well."

I grinned and replied, "You can count on me."

&#x200B;

I was about to turn around and leave when I figured that Jack's face was extremely pale, much paler than usual, and his eyes were glittering with resentment big enough to swallow him whole. But not near enough to swallow his entire family, which was why he couldn't be as proactive as he should have been for his revenge. What a pity, I thought, to be able to vent only in the least pleasurable way.

So without really meaning it, I added, "Oh, and Jack, I'll make sure to call you when I bring Alex into my garage.. so that you can join me anytime you want. Just in case you change your mind."

Jack grinned his awkward smile, waved his hands, and closed the door. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Part 3**

&#x200B;

Only two days were left until the conference, and my body was getting worse every day. But my mind, my living soul, had never been stronger. As I got out of bed, I tasted blood inside my throat, which I was starting to get used to since I'd been coughing out blood every now and then for the past week or so. 

&#x200B;

'I cannot die, not like this. I have things to finish.'

I hauled myself out of the bedroom and turned the TV on. 

&#x200B;

*<Soldiers in the Pacific are now entering their training season, but will they manage to...>*

Hmm. What a boring issue. I lay down on the sofa and switched to the next channel. 

&#x200B;

*<The battle to avoid relegation, will it succeed? The fans haven't been supportive of...>*

And next.

&#x200B;

*<Breaking News: A mayor found lying unconscious in the hospital due to a severe car accident...>*

I sat straight up. A mayor? Fallen unconscious? Could it be *the* mayor? 

My phone rang. It was a call from Jack, and I picked it up. 

&#x200B;

"Did you hear the News?"

"You mean, about the mayor?"

"Yup, seems like you should be in a hurry."

Oh, great. So it *was* the mayor.

&#x200B;

Jack continued, "They say he was rushed to the hospital, but I'm not sure about Alex. Just a heads up."

I scanned the screen for one final check before heading to my car. 

*<......and the doctor rated his chances of recovery as nil.>*

&#x200B;

My heart started beating madly. There was good news and bad news about this incident. The good news was that Alex going missing was no longer a problem since the mayor wouldn't be able to check it anyway. The bad news was that Alex, now a free man, could stray anywhere. If he decided to step out of his daily routine, which was, considering his tendency as the ultimate seeker for entertainment, highly probable, it would be difficult for me to find him. Starting the car, I prayed for him to be still asleep.

&#x200B;

When I reached Alex's house, the first sight of it gave me chills. I had received dozens of photos and reports about the area from the detective agency, but I never imagined it to be so eerily quiet. Apart from the old house in front of the car, this place was almost like a forest. There was absolutely no sign, no trace of any living creature around. Complete silence. That was the only way to describe it. Was Alex inside? If so, what could he be doing? Could he have already gone, far away from his house? 

&#x200B;

Suddenly I heard a terrifying sound right next to me: a knock-knock at my car window. I froze. There stood Alex, tilting his face sideways, trying to look into the car. I could recognize him straight away. His face had barely changed since middle school, but he had grown taller and was wearing a suit, probably an outfit for something official. But I didn't feel his approach. Just like I did with the nurse a month ago. Only this time, it was much more critical. 

&#x200B;

"Excuse me, driving here is forbidden. How may I help you?" He yelled through the window. Luckily, he didn't recognize me, thanks to the window's heavy tanning. I slowly picked up the taser I had brought with me and lowered the car window. My heart was thumping faster than ever. I could feel every beat, every movement of it inside my chest. 

&#x200B;

"Can you hold this for a second?" I asked, my voice shaking terribly. My body was starting to lose control. Even before facing him properly, I had already given in to the old fear of the past. Breathe, I told myself. Breathe. All you have to do is just time it right. Then he'll be on the ground. Just time it right. 

&#x200B;

"Sure. Hand it over and I'll keep - "

As soon as the window was open wide enough for a shot, I twisted my body to reveal the taser and fired it straight at Alex's chest. With a short shriek, he collapsed forward and bashed his head against the door before crippling down on the ground. He lay there, twitching. His eyes were still open, but the empty look on his face told me that he was knocked out for good. 

&#x200B;

I let out a deep sigh of victory. At least the difficult part was over now. I quickly texted Jack to come to my garage anytime he felt like doing so. Then I hauled his limp body into the back seat of my car and started to tie his arms and legs behind his back. When it was all done, I felt an enormous amount of adrenalin pumping all over my body. My heart was still beating heavily. This entire scene felt like a dream. Here lay Alex, tied up and unconscious underneath my knees, completely vulnerable. If I wanted to, I could kill him right now - I had brought a hammer and a knife with me as well in case things went wrong -  but it wasn't a wise decision to do it here. Plus, there was that promise I had made with Jack. I hurried over to the driver's seat and closed the door. 

&#x200B;

'Don't be stupid and keep patient,' a voice rang inside my head.

'You can't kill him just like that. He deserves more.'

So in I drove back to the foresty road. After a few minutes of driving, I began to feel dizzy. Or was I just feeling tired and sleepy? This entire hunt for Alex today had been well beyond my body's limit, and all my power was starting to drain out. 

&#x200B;

'Keep going!' The voice warned. Clutching onto the steering wheel, I forced myself to stay awake and rumbled toward my house. To my garage. To the place where Alex would finally expiate his sins. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Part 4**

&#x200B;

"Wake up, bitch."

I splashed cold water into Alex's face, but he didn't budge. His limbs were tied to the chair he was sitting on, and I stood in front of him, waiting for him to come back to his senses. I slapped him. This time, his eyes flickered a bit. So I slapped him some more. 

&#x200B;

"...What the heck..... where is this place..?" he moaned. 

"Ah, good. You're awake now. I was worried you might have been dead already." I replied.

I stared at him and examined his face. In there was an emotion of both terror and anger. The same emotions I used to feel every day when Alex and Kevin were around. 

"Look at me. Depending on what you say, I might let you live."

He stared back at me blankly for a few seconds and then nodded.

&#x200B;

"Why was it me? What was it that you hated so much about me?"

I looked straight at him with glaring eyes, trying hard to control the rage exploding inside. 

'Let's at least give him a chance to apologize. I can punish him after listening to what he has to say.'

&#x200B;

After staring at each other for a while, Alex spoke.

"I'm sorry... I can't remember you. Who are you...? Did I do anything wrong to you? Is that why I'm here?"

&#x200B;

I stood there, stupified, unable to believe what I had just heard. He had to be joking. Nightmares of him had been haunting me all this time, and I had been suffering terrible traumas for almost twenty years. I have failed numerous job interviews due to that traumatic experience and now have fallen ill with terminal cancer. After all that, it was crazy for that bitch to say, "Oh well, I don't remember you, but I'll apologize if I have caused any trouble." and then get away with it. How on earth could he not remember me? Was he playing dumb, acting as if he couldn't recognize me?

&#x200B;

I took a step toward him and slammed his right hand as hard as I could with the hammer I had been holding. 

"AAAAAGGGHH..!!!" He cried out. I slammed the same spot again. This time, he shook his head up and down, writhing in agony. 

&#x200B;

"Does it hurt??? Huh? DOES IT FUCKING HURT?!" I yelled back. The third blow was on his head. I swung the hammer toward one of his temples, but the shaking of his head mistimed my blow and I felt the skull crack underneath the impact. Blood splattered everywhere, covering half of his head in seconds. 

He started yelling, "Who *are* you? What do you want from me?! When you're torturing me, you tell me who you are!!!"

&#x200B;

"I'll tell you who I am," I replied, "after this one." I marched again, this time for his knees. For the same knee bone that Jack had received a beating and got splintered. 

&#x200B;

"I, I remember you!! It all just suddenly popped into my head, and I'm really sorry about it! I shouldn't have done that.. I must have been out of my mind. I apologize..." 

Alex started sobbing.

&#x200B;

Withdrawing my hammer, I asked, "Do you indeed? Can you remember who I am?" 

&#x200B;

He took a few seconds to breathe, and then came the reply.

"Yes, of course, Samuel. How could I forget? I've always wanted to apologize to my peers at uni. I admit that I was a psychopath back then. I mean it."

&#x200B;

The slightest hope that he might recognize me and apologize was what had been keeping me from killing him straight away. That hope, thinner than a thread, broke miserably. I bent down, picked up a piece of thick nail on the ground, and dug it deep inside his left thigh with the hammer. He screeched painfully. 

&#x200B;

"Listen. My name is Ken, not Samuel. And we met at middle school." I whispered. From then on, I cannot remember. For at least five minutes - or was it ten? - I must have gone crazy, pounding and stabbing him madly. At last, when I was too tired to move, I slouched on his body and the broken chair. Breathing heavily, I stared at his face, smeared all over with blood and dirt. The gush of dark blood that had been pouring out of his nose had begun to stop, leaving a red trace alongside his swollen chin, like a zombie in horror movies. So that's what I must have looked like during high school. What a disastrous scene. 

&#x200B;

Now that Alex was dead, other things I had to consider started slipping into my mind. When would his friends or the mayor's workers come searching for him? Were they already on their way? I had to get up and clean the mess on the ground before the blood left permanent stains, but I could barely lift my arms. I lay down for some rest and wiped off the blood on my face. What a day, I thought. What an absolutely tiring, devastating day. My eyelids were too heavy to keep my eyes open, but I knew that closing them now would drag me to sleep forever. So I just lay there gazing at the ceiling.. and trying my best not to fall asleep.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Part 5**

&#x200B;

It was all over now. All over in a matter of minutes. But something just didn't feel right. Wasn't revenge supposed to get rid of the burden inside? I felt far from being settled. I felt some kind of horrible emptiness, even after a rather successful revenge. Was it because I had lost my mind throughout and couldn't remember most of it? A possible theory, but there was something else, a cause fundamentally different responsible for this uneasy feeling. What was it?

&#x200B;

I was trying to figure out what exactly it was when I heard the roaring of a vehicle right outside my garage. The cops? No, they have sirens. And it couldn't be any of Alex's peers at work as well, since he worked alone. Which left only one person. I stood up and saw a truck enter. It didn't slow down until it stopped right in front of Alex's dead body. When the truck came into close view, I could see that its entire front was a complete mess. There were huge dents everywhere, the side mirror on the left was broken, and the door hinge had been torn apart. What a hurry he must have been in to come here. In the driver's seat was the familiar silhouette of Jack, and I adjusted my orientation toward him with a grin.  

&#x200B;

"Hey, I didn't think you would come."

He walked out of the truck and I greeted him by handing him over a knife lying next to the corpse. 

&#x200B;

"You arrived a bit too late, I'm afraid. He's already dead. If you're still okay with a dead Alex though, then go ahead and do whatever you want. He's all yours. It's a priceless chance for you to overcome your trauma."

Jack took the knife and rubbed its blade against a brown shawl he had draped around his shoulders which seemed to be made of animal fur. There was a writing carved into it: *R.I.P, My Dear Bella.* Whatever that meant, he must have worn it for a reason, probably something related to his trauma during his school years. 

&#x200B;

"You're right. I thought about what you told me earlier, about revenge, and realized this was something I had to finish with my own hands." After taking a quick scan around the garage, Jack asked quietly, "What did Alex say to you before dying?"

&#x200B;

"Oh, that bitch," I replied heavily, "didn't even remember me. After all that bullying, he couldn't find a clue of who I was. What a comedy. I spent my entire life petrified, but to him, it had been literally nothing more than a joke. This is so fucking unfair."

&#x200B;

Jack looked up into my eyes. He was holding the knife in one hand, and his shawl in the other. Both hands were trembling. He was hesitating. That's when I noticed he was wearing a cast around his neck. He had been covering the area with the shawl. Did he crash his truck while hurrying over? Or was he involved in some kind of accident? Wait, a truck? A group of letters suddenly flashed through my head. 

&#x200B;

*<...and according to the police, the truck driver had run away after striking the mayor with a vehicle much heavier than his...>*

The Mayor. The truck. The accident. My brain started spinning. Was it the same truck? I turned around swiftly to check if the truck was the one that had appeared on TV when I suddenly felt a searing sensation on my waist. It started to burn immediately. The pain was so excruciating that I couldn't even breathe. When I turned my head to check, I saw a knife stuck into my waist. It was the knife I had handed over to Jack. 

&#x200B;

"What the..?"

I collapsed to the floor, my shirt starting to soak with blood. I gagged for breath and tried desperately to get up again, but my body didn't listen. My legs were heavy as a log. I looked up and saw Jack limping toward me, this time holding a hammer in his hand. I had to get up somehow.

&#x200B;

"It is you," Jack sobbed, "who ruined my life. I've had more traumas because of what *you* did to me than Alex or his friends. You vented your anger on me every time they troubled you, and that memory has given me horrible nightmares."

&#x200B;

WHAT? I staggered to my feet with my back hunched over the knife stuck in my stomach, already feeling dizzy. What the hell was he talking about? For a moment, I thought I might be dreaming. But the pain in my stomach was too real for it to be a dream. Jack unfolded his shawl and spread it wide in front of me, showing me the words I had seen earlier. He then asked, "Do you remember Bella?" 

&#x200B;

"I.. I don't get it. What are you talking about? Who is Bella? Look, there must have been some kind of misunderstanding - "

Another horrible burn throbbed inside that contracted the muscles around the area, cutting off my words. This one was ridiculously painful. For the first time, I felt what it was like to die. Before I knew it, Jack was right in front of me. He whispered, "Bella was my dog. And you killed her."

&#x200B;

My heart started racing. Bella? His dog? Since when did Jack have a dog in his family? I felt Jack's fingers close around my neck. Then he growled in a low voice with his eyes almost popping out of rage, *"You don't remember either, do you? You punk."* And that's the last thing I heard from him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

  \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"It's not fair they didn't do the same to Bella, is it? I thought we were friends in the same boat."

"Ken, please.."

"Looks like she needs some grooming too. Don't worry. I won't use the paint. We're friends after all, aren't we? Come here, Bella. It's time for you to meet Coco."
