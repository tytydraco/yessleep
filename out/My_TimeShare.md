Have you ever had a job that you simultaneously cared about and also didn’t really care about? Like, you would make an effort while there, but when outside of work, you loathed to even think about it. Maybe you’d put in the minimum effort, but you’d still be devastated if you ever lost this job. On a rare occasion, you’d go above and beyond, but you’d never consider yourself worthy of employee of the month. That’s me working at The Gentlemen’s Pizza Parlour.

As the name suggests, we sell pizza. I’m the delivery driver, and I have been for over a year now. I work evenings. I get shifts every day, but they’re short shifts. My boss is never that mad if I want to take the day off, because he has a system where he’ll make one of the bus boys take his car to make the deliveries anyway. We don’t really get that many orders anyway. Sure, it’s a small town, and there’s only one or two pizza places around, but Guigino’s is way cheaper.

“You can’t sacrifice quality,” my boss always says while cursing Guigino’s. That’s how we got out name. My boss likes to think that his pizza is top of the range. A fine-dining experience. A *Gentleman’s* pizza. In my opinion, we’re just okay. Maybe we’re a bit too sparse on the cheese.

Still, one of those times where I considered that I was going above and beyond in my job was when I bought that briefcase. I was loitering around town, window shopping, when I happened upon a briefcase in the window of an antique store. What really struck me about it was how big it was. Big enough to fit, say, a couple of fourteen-inch pizza boxes inside comfortably. When I showed up to work the next day, I had the briefcase. It made my boss laugh so much that for a moment, I really did feel an immense amount of pride in my work. Delivering a pizza in a briefcase sure lived up to our name, and my boss instantly okay-ed the idea.

The briefcase itself, apart from its size, was nothing much to look at. It was battered at the corners and made of brown leather. On the top of it, there were three dials which I initially thought were combination locks, but no dice. The case didn’t lock. They were pretty much useless and I just assumed that the locking mechanism on the case was broken. There was also a small metal plaque just to the right of the handle that said “ONE OF A DOUBLE SET”, meaning that there was another matching briefcase out there somewhere in the world. I never even once considered that this thing was rare, or worth a lot of money. To me, it was just a fun, gimmicky way to do my job.

For whatever reason, business really picked up that summer. I was driving to the address of a delivery, the briefcase on the passenger seat of my car next to me. When I pulled up to the house, I picked up the briefcase and noticed that it was suspiciously light. When I opened the case, the pizza was gone. I had been sure that I’d put it in there, but also, I wouldn’t have put it past myself to drive off without the order, so I sped back to the shop where I got an earful from my boss (who claims he gave the pizza to me) and, eventually, the fresh order.

This was just a taste of things to come. You see, this started to happen more and more frequently. My boss even made me take a piss test, convinced that I was high. He also accused me of stealing. You see, there were occasions where he stood by me as I loaded two pizza boxes into the briefcase, and, when I pulled up to the delivery address with only one pizza in the case, I had to turn around and go back. He was this close to firing me, and I wouldn’t have blamed him. All I knew was that the pizzas were disappearing, and I had no clue where they were going.

I didn’t pay much attention at the time, but now when I look back at fall, all I can think about is the amount of missing cat posters that were on our noticeboard at work. You see, around this time, although I had assumed that the locking mechanism on the case was broken, it shut on me and wouldn’t open. I even tried to pry this thing apart with a crowbar, but it wouldn’t budge. This would happen for a couple of hours at a time, and then, like magic, the thing would be openable again as if nothing had happened.

The case was really starting to smell as this point too. Not old pizza smell, but like something rotten. I tried to leave it open as much as possible to air the stink, but nothing seemed to make it go away. That’s that job apathy I was talking about earlier. No matter how bard the briefcase started to smell, I never replaced it. One night, I was airing out the briefcase. I had left it open on the kitchen table in my apartment, but when I woke up the next morning, it was closed. Another magically stuck shut moment. I picked it up and rattled it hard, but it felt… full. Something inside moved around, and a pitiful yowl came from within the case. I dropped it in shock, and as I did, the thing sprung open. It was empty, but it smelled worse than ever. That apathy again, I shrugged it off. I should point out that at the time, I was heavily stoned. Even my boss's piss tests hadn’t deterred me from sparking up semi-regularly.

That same week, an order came in. I placed the pizza - a twelve-inch meat lover’s – into the briefcase and drove away. This address was pretty far away, just on the outskirts of town. I don’t remember much about the house itself, only that it was fairly nondescript. When I knocked on the door, a man answered almost immediately, as if he had been standing behind the door just waiting. He was in his early thirties, with long, greasy brown hair tied into a low ponytail. He had bad acne, bad teeth, bad everything. His face was wet with a sheen of sweat, and the inside of his house reeked. He grinned at me, and looked down at the pizza.

“Wow,” he said. “It really is *identical* to mine.”

“That’s $18,” I said to him promptly, not really wanting to engage in conversation with a guy that looked like that.

“Your briefcase,” he said. He had a funny manner of speaking, all high-pitched and breathy.

I’m normally quite slow on the uptake, but this clicked instantly, and, wanting to hurry the interaction along and get out of there, I unenthusiastically said: “Oh, you have the other one in the matching set. That’s cool.”

The man made no effort to reach for money or anything. He simply languished in the doorframe and I stood in front of him awkwardly. “I thought I should finally order pizza from you guys officially. You know, after all the freebies you’ve been giving me.” This stumped me, so I just stood there and said nothing. “The briefcase,” he prompted. “Do you really not know how it works?”

I could feel the pizza turning cold in the box in my hands. “What do you mean?” I asked slowly.

He turned on his heels and headed back into the house, leaving the door wide open. When he didn’t return after a few minutes, I followed him into the house, calling “Sir? Sir? You still have to pay for this pizza.” The house smelled rotten. The guy was sitting in what would have been a lounge if it weren’t for all the clutter. Amongst the mess, there were several mouldy looking pizza boxes, our own brand, even though I knew I had never delivered there before.

He had his own briefcase, truly identical to mine, on his lap, and he gestured for me to sit on the floor across from him. “Sir, I need to get back to work. Are you gonna pay for this pizza?” The whole interaction was wigging me out, and I really wanted to escape the smell of this house. “This won’t take a moment. There’s a big tip in it for you,” the guy responded. So, I sat.

He instructed me to close my briefcase with the pizza box inside, so I did. Then, he flipped one of the dials on top of his case - the ones which I had assumed were broken locking mechanisms - and opened his case. There was a pizza box inside. He took it out and opened it. The smell of meat lover’s pizza added to the already sweaty smell in the room and made me want to barf. “Open yours”, he instructed, and I did. My pizza was gone.

“That’s-”

“That’s right!” the guy said, all girlish and excited. “Isn’t it amazing. Here, watch this.” He took some money from his pocket – a twenty-dollar bill – fiddled with one of the dials on top of his briefcase, put the money inside and then shut it. He instructed me which of the three dials I should flip, and when I opened my own briefcase, the greasy twenty-dollar bill was inside.

“Dude, you nearly got me fired,” was all I could think to say. He giggled.

“That’s not all,” he responded, and made a clicking noise in the back of his throat. A curious mewing emanated from somewhere at the back of the lounge, behind all the trash and clutter, and a small black and white kitten approached at the sound of the clicks. The guy picked up the kitten in one hand, and with the other, he beckoned for me to close my briefcase, which I did. He toggled a different dial on the case, and then, with a smooth and rehearsed motion, he used both hands to wring the kitten’s neck.

I yelped and shot up, but he had already quickly stuffed the kitten’s body into the case and slammed it shut. “Relax,” he told me, flashing a grin with all of his bad teeth. I was paralysed, and stood rooted to the spot before quickly grabbing at my own case, hoping to free the kitten and check if it was alright. However, my case was stuck fast, and the lid wouldn’t open. “I call that one the privacy lock,” the guy said, sounding bored. “You can’t get in,” he continued in a sing-song voice.

I was about to yell, shaking all over, when he held up one finger to silence me. “This last lock,” he said. “I call it ‘void all’”. He flipped the third and final dial on his case, and when he opened it up, the kitten was gone. I grabbed at my own case, now able to open it, but the kitten wasn’t in there either.

I turned on my heel to leave, and as I was halfway out the door, the last thing I heard him say was “The only thing is, I could never figure out where it sends them to.”

I tried to put this whole encounter out of my mind. In the following days, I only delivered pizza with what he had called the ‘privacy lock’ engaged, and I never had any more trouble with the boxes vanishing. It was only after a week, sometime in the middle of the night, that I realised I had been transporting food in the same case that had been used to store cats both dead and dying. I had thrown up at the thought and put the briefcase in the back of my closet. I ordered a new one for work the next day. I know, I’m a saint.

It was weeks after this that I head a rumble coming from inside my closet. The case inside was shifting around, and a muffled scratching was coming from within. I tried, but couldn’t prise it open. I was of the thinking that this had to end, so I grabbed my phone and a hammer (the only intimidating thing that I could think of at the time) and drove over to my time-share partner’s house. When I knocked on the door, he answered immediately, his face fixed in a nervous grin that looked almost pained. He was pale and sweaty. “It’s not me this time,” was all he said. I went inside his house again, with half a mind to cuss him out and start breaking things with my hammer, threaten to call the cops if he ever hurt another animal again, even if it meant explaining how I knew. However, he demonstrated that his own briefcase, which shuffled around, noises coming from within, was also locked tight. “It’s funny,” he said to me. “When I was sending them away… wherever I was sending them. I never considered the idea that whatever’s on the other side might be able to send things back.”
