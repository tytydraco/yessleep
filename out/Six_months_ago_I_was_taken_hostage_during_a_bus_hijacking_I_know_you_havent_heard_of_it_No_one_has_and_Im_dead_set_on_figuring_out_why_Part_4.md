Alma held the door open and extended an arm into the darkness.

*“After you.”*

Fear swelled in my gut. I sifted through my memories and once again pulled Nia’s reassuring voice to the forefront.

Focus and breathe.

My eyes widened. I took a sharp inhale. My heart slammed into my rib cage.

For the first time in a decade, it didn’t feel like a memory.

I heard her. I heard Nia. Not in my head, either.

I heard my dead wife’s voice coming from somewhere within the darkness. It was faint. Almost imperceptibly so. The ghost of a distant whisper, hopelessly delicate and ethereal.

She spoke again.

Without my permission, I heard her again.

One foot in front of the other, Elena.

Without a shred of hesitation, I stepped over the threshold.

***Treatise 1:*** The Simple Art of Becoming a God

Before I go any further, allow me to provide you all with a few tidbits of clarifying information. Something to keep in the back of your mind as I detail what came after I voluntarily entered the bowels of that cathedral. Insight I would have killed for at the time.

During the bus hijacking, Apollo called out to Eileithyia and begged her not to interfere with his *ascension.* Claimed he was close to reaching that hallowed state, which I would argue was plainly evident given his ability to change the constitution of his own matter at will, liquefying and reforming to avoid being subdued. Apollo had undeniably *transcended* his baseline humanity, to some degree. But, according to the man himself, he hadn’t yet *ascended* from humanity all together.

Apotheosis. Deification. Ascendance. Whatever name you’d like to give it, the crux of this all revolves around Godhood: how to achieve it and what that means once you have achieved it.

So, what’s the difference? What distinguishes humanity, transcended or not, from being a God?

Creation: A God has the capacity to make something out of nothing, with a tiny asterisk. I’ll get back to that asterisk soon.

Apollo could manipulate reality, yes, but he couldn’t create anything from scratch. In retrospect, it makes all the sense in the world. Every aspect of the cult points to creation being the key. It’s named *The Audience to his Red* ***Nativity,*** where the definition of *nativity* is “the occasion of someone’s birth”\*\*\*.\*\*\*Then there’s Jeremiah, with his placental mouth and his thousand children bursting from his chest in droves, according to the image in the stained glass. I mean, the cult’s recruiting grounds was an online infertility support group, for Christ’s sake.

Speaking of Christ, you want to know the most famous example of the point I’m trying to illustrate? The difference between mortality, transcending mortality, and ascension to Godhood?

Well, look no further than The New Testament.

Now, I ain’t attempting to elicit any zealous indignation or stoke the already inflamed societal unrest regarding religion in general. That isn’t my goal, and if it was, there are plenty of quicker, more efficient ways to do it. That said, some of what I lay out may sound a lot like sacrilege. Try to maintain an open mind. I promise that, ultimately, I’m advocating *for* Christ’s place in history as a God, just not the one and only God.

So, where does the story of Christ begin?

Immaculate conception: the creation of a child through preternatural means. In other words, Christ was created from scratch. Implanted into the virgin Mary via God’s will alone. And because of his immaculate conception, he was born with *some* innate Godhood.

From there, what does he do? Christ bends reality. He converts water into wine. He cures leprosy from the downtrodden, no doubt wringing out the bacteria that caused said leprosy like someone would wring out suds from a sponge. He feeds five-thousand by multiplying a few loaves of bread and fish. I will say that I’m doubtful of the nutritional content provided by the copied bread and fish, given that (by my estimation) he was only spreading the original calories out over a much larger surface area, not creating more, but I digress.

Christ, like Apollo, needed substrate. He could transmute objects, but he couldn’t manifest them out of nothing.

Before, I claimed that Christ was born with *some* innate Godhood. Everything that’s made manifest by a God is by definition. That’s the nuance of this whole thing. A God can circumvent the natural order to create life, and it appears like they’re manifesting something out of nothing, but as much as they may want to avoid it, they can’t help divesting a piece of themselves into their creation.

From there, I think the question becomes this:

What did Christ need to make that final leap? Again, the answer is simpler than you’d think.

To ascend, one needs to be more God than they are human. Once those scales are tipped, ascension is inevitable.

After Christ was killed, he was entombed under a church built on the side of a hill outside Jerusalem. Something within that tomb catalyzed his ascension, and it’s the same thing that Apollo was to so desperate to find. Something hidden under the chapel constructed on that Arizona mountaintop.

The piece of a dead God, just waiting to be cannibalized by the right individual.

Here’s the kicker.

In the end, that *right individual* wasn’t Apollo. Nor was it Alma, The Monsignor, or anyone else trapped within the black catacombs.

It was me.

\- - - - -

All that awaited me beyond that door was an impenetrable darkness. I suppose I expected there to be *some* light to guide me, even if I couldn’t see it when I initially looked in. How else would Alma and the others navigate the space?

What a naive misgiving.

My first few steps were confident, driven by the siren call of Nia’s phantasmal voice. Quickly, though, my momentum slowed to a stop. I’d say I took no more than ten steps into the lightless miasma before realizing my mistake.

I was utterly and completely blinded.

Heartbeat thumping madly in my chest, I brought my hand up to my face. Nothing. I brought it closer, so close that I accidentally touched my unprotected eye with a fingertip, causing my head to reflexively withdrawal.

No matter how close my hand got, I couldn’t see it.

*Get out*, my brainstem screamed. *Turn around and get the fuck out.*

Carefully, I rotated my body one-hundred and eighty degrees, expecting to see Alma or the dim light of the chapel’s lobby beyond the open doorway.

Unchanged blackness.

My mind scrambled to comprehend the situation, but it made no earthly sense. Had she closed the door? If she did, I didn’t hear it, but how could that be? The damn thing screeched like a banshee when she first pulled it open, scraping roughly against the stone floor.

Did I not fully turn around? Carefully, panic swimming through my each and every capillary, I rotated my feet in a circle. As I moved, my eyes begged for stimuli. Something to anchor me to reality. I ached for a scrap of driftwood to cling on to. A buoy to keep my head above the waves of an unforgiving sea, preventing me from falling deeper and deeper into these black waters, never falling far enough to hit the sea floor, and never completely drowning, either: an unescapable, infinite, abysmal descent.

Three full revolutions, and not an ounce of light in any direction.

*“Alma? Alma, I can’t see. Where are you?”* I shouted.

***"Alma? Alma, please, where are you???"*** I yelled.

Then, I just screamed. A guttural, crackling shriek. A sound so harrowing that, when it bounced off some unseen surface back to my ears, it frightened me even further. It felt decidedly inhuman. The pain was too raw, the pitch indescribably high and low at the same time. For a moment, I wondered if I had even created it, or if something in the darkness was screaming back in response to my outcry.

*Why did I spin around so many times?* I thought, chastising myself, realizing I couldn’t determine which direction was the way I came in.

So, I chose a direction at random, and I ran. Practically sprinted. Seconds turned to minutes. Minutes turned to hours. I ran until my legs gave out, all without turning.

I didn’t meet any wall.

Defeated, I sat down, crumpling in on myself from the sheer impossibility of the circumstances. As I lowered myself, however, my palms touched something wet. Pulsing. Leathery. Closest comparison I can think of while writing this is the sensation of touching a tongue.

The floor felt moist and ridged and alive.

Boundless fear re-energized my futile marathon.

Not sure how long I ran for. Could have been months, could have been minutes. Time was a pliable metric in the black catacombs: it was a recommendation, not a requirement.

Eventually, a hand laid itself on my shoulder. The touch felt gentle. Delicate. Part of me hoped that tenderness was a ploy. Something to lull me into a false sense of security while it creeped along my collarbone, looking to wrap itself around my neck and squeeze the life out of me. A mercy killing. There didn’t seem to be a physical way out of the darkness, so death appeared to be the only true exit.

Unfortunately, that was not the hand’s intent. It spun my body around, and then the mouth that was attached to it spoke.

*“You must be tired now, yes? Are you ready to sleep? You’ll need your energy for tomorrow’s sessions.”* Alma cooed, like a mother to child whose temper tantrum was finally abating.

Not thinking, I didn’t say anything. Instead, I silently nodded.

*“Great. Take my hand.”* She replied.

Somehow, she could see me within the blackness.

To my shock, I was starting to see her too.

There wasn’t any new light.

And yet, I could appreciate the outline of a tall, lean woman standing in front of me.

I took her hand, and we began walking the opposite direction, backtracking over the path I felt like I’d been running on for hours. After about fifteen seconds, Alma stopped, so I stopped too. She guided my body down. At first I was reticent, but I gave in. Before long, my glutes landed on something soft and cushioned. I ran my fingers along the surface. It felt like a mattress, and a comfortable one at that.

Suddenly, I wasn’t afraid. I wasn’t confused, or angry, or sad. I wasn’t anything, really.

I was just exhausted.

Alma’s hand cradled the back of my skull and gracefully lowered my head onto a pillow. I was able to do the rest. I brought my legs up, shifted my torso, and laid my aching calves on to what I assumed was a mattress.

My breathing calmed. My heartbeat slowed. Alma draped a blanket over me.

*“Goodnight, Elena. Don’t get up. I’ll come get you when it’s time.”*

I didn’t hear her walk away, but it felt like she had. I can’t tell you why.

I thought about reaching out from under the blanket, over the side of the mattress, and down to the floor.

*Would it feel like stone or like a tongue?* I contemplated.

Ultimately, I decided against it, and I closed my eyes. At least, I think I did. It was hard to tell for sure, because my vision didn’t change. In the embrace of a perfect darkness, is there even a difference between having your eyes open or closed?

The last thought I had before I drifted off into a dreamless sleep was an important one.

*Alma hadn’t called me Meghan. She didn’t use my alias.*

*She called me Elena.*

*Alma knew I wasn’t who I claimed to be.*

*If that was even Alma at all.*

*It could have been Alma, or someone pretending to be Alma, or no one at all. An illusion created by a broken mind.*

*In the embrace of a perfect darkness, did it* [*even matter?*](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/)
