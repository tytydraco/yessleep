I got a call from my dad just as I was about to take my daily dose of Prozac.

“How are you?” he asked cheerfully.

“I’m fine,” I lied and downed the capsule.

“Well, that’s great,” he said, not sounding convinced. “That’s great, Ben.”

"What’s up?" I asked, eager to change the topic.

“I, um,” he hesitated. “I know we’re seeing each other soon—and I guess this could’ve waited—but I just wanted to tell you that I went through everything in my basement last night and, um, well, I found some stuff I thought I had gotten rid of years ago.” He laughed nervously. “Just some of my old things from college and, um, from before your mom got sick.”

I could tell he was struggling to find the right words.

“It was kind of a trip down memory lane,” he continued. “Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that I found some of your old things, too. I thought you might want them.”

Just thinking about my youth gave me anxiety, and I didn’t want to be reminded of it.

My childhood and teenage years were strange and sorrowful times. It’s fair to say they were my rise and fall. Eventually, I managed to gain friends, even a girlfriend, but in the end, I lost all of them and I never fully recovered from it. The fall wasn’t just metaphorical. At the end of eighth grade, in 1998, my girlfriend did the unthinkable. I have almost no recollection of this time in my life, but the vague image of her falling toward the schoolyard’s pavement persists in my mind; her white dress embracing her body as if she was carried down by a cloud. Sometimes I see this scene from above as if I’m soaring above like a bird, detached from everything, and sometimes I’m right there next to her. I remember the blood seeping out from beneath her, turning the dress crimson red. For a few moments, she was still alive. Our eyes met. And all I managed to say before she was gone forever was her name:

“Julia.”

She was crying, and with her last gasp of air she formed the words:

“You too, Benjamin?”

My life before the suicide was happy, and my life thereafter was clouded by a never-ending depression. Julia didn’t just end her own life; in a way, she ended mine as well. I just couldn’t bring myself back. It remained a mystery to everyone why Julia chose to end her life so abruptly, even though it was true that at the end an indistinct sorrow had taken hold of her spirit.

I’ve tried to follow her example twice.

Dad’s mention of my old belongings brought these memories back, but it also—just for a moment—reminded me of one of my most recurring nightmares, and for some reason, it hit me differently this time. Me, running down a staircase that seemed to never end, my legs aching, my lungs burning. And at the bottom of the staircase was a door, and beyond that door was Julia. I could see her, waiting for me. But no matter how fast I ran, I could never reach her.

“Ben?” my dad said.

I shook my head to rid myself of the thought.

“Y-yeah?”

“I saw some of your old CDs in the box. I thought you might like to have those back, at least, considering you were practically addicted to them back then.”

He laughed, but I could still hear how concerned he was for my well-being, or perhaps how afraid he was that I was going to make another attempt at my own life.

“You kept them?” I asked. “That’s pretty cool, Dad.”

A small, almost imperceptible curiosity awoke within me. I loved those CDs. Some of them were legit titles, such as *The Queen Is Dead* by The Smiths and *Hagnesta Hill* by the Swedish rock-pop band Kent, but most of them were my own bootleg mp3 copies that I burned on CDs on my old Pentium II. In the end, I thought it couldn’t hurt too much to check them out.

It wasn’t until next weekend—a few days later than planned—that I finally pulled myself together enough to be able to leave the house and visit my dad. I opened the door to my old Volvo and sat down in the driver’s seat. I turned the key in the ignition, put the car in gear, and drove off. I dreaded going back to that part of town; just seeing it reminded me of all the pain I’d gone through. I thought about taking a detour to avoid my old school but decided against it. I didn’t want to give it that much power over me. Of course, a red light kept me stuck at the intersection right in front of it—the Royal Conservatory of Education. I looked over at the imposing stone building, watching the children play in the yard dressed in their little uniforms, oblivious to everything that happened there all those years ago. I took a deep breath and continued on my way.

Dad had cooked meatballs with mashed potatoes, my favorite dish before I lost my appetite, and invited me to sit down to eat with him. He asked me how things were going and I shrugged.

“I’m okay,” I said, pushing the food around my plate.

Dad shook his head. “You’re not eating,” he said. “You’ve lost weight.”

I shrugged again.

“I’m sorry, I know you don’t like when I worry too much,” he said, “but I can’t help it. You’re my son after all. Anyway, um, how did that job interview go? What was it for again?”

I had gone on a few job interviews, but I couldn’t bring myself to care about any of them. “It was fine,” I said. “I didn’t get it.”

Dad frowned. “That’s a shame. Maybe something will come up soon. It shouldn’t be a problem for you. Programmers are in high demand these days.”

I knew he was just trying to make me feel better, but it wasn’t working.

“Not depressed programmers,” I said with a bitter smile.

Dad sighed. “You’re still seeing that therapist, right?”

I nodded. “Yes, I am.”

“Good. I think that’s helping. You seem a little better. Telling a joke like that.” He smiled at me, but I just stared back at him.

Dad changed the topic after a few moments of awkward silence. “So, did you see the game last night?”

From here, we didn’t touch upon anything too personal or deep. We just talked about sports and the weather like we always did. It was nice, in a way, but it also made me feel even more depressed. I was reminded of all the things I used to enjoy that I no longer had any interest in.

It wasn’t until it was time for me to go back home that he gave me the old, tarnished cardboard box.

“Maybe it will bring back some memories,” he said.

I could see the pity in his eyes.

“I kind of hope it won’t.”

Later that night, I removed all the dishes from my small kitchen table and placed them in my over-stuffed sink. I stood in from of the table for a moment, gathering the courage to face my past. I reached down and picked up the box, placing it on the table with trembling hands. I ran my fingers along the top of the box, tracing the words that Dad had written there in black permanent marker. “Ben’s stuff.” Just two words, and yet they held so much meaning.

It surprised me how nervous all of this made me. The scent escaping the box after I opened it gave me an instant flashback to my old room at my dad’s place, specifically to a random memory of me sitting on the bed together with Julia. One of those days when we had spent the entire evening playing computer games. *Why did you do it?* I had stopped trying to explain it a long time ago, but now—just for a second—the question returned to my mind. It made me uneasy.

I swallowed hard and reached for the things in the box. At the top was a Tamagotchi, an empty *Toejam & Earl* cartridge, and among some stickers and Kinder Egg toys, my old Nokia 3310. There was also the red beret that Julia had forgotten at my place sometime before she killed herself. I held it for a couple of seconds, listening to my heavy heartbeats.

Beneath this were some drawings and schoolbooks and under that, hidden at the bottom, my old CDs. All of these things were from before it happened, when I still knew what happiness felt like. The nostalgia I felt seeing these items wasn’t exactly a positive feeling, but at least it was a *feeling*. I almost couldn’t remember the last time I had one, other than numbness.

I remembered most of the CDs, but one of them stood out to me. I had written “backup” on it with a red marker. I put one of the CDs in my stereo, and as “Bitter Sweet Symphony*”* by The Verve started playing, I walked over to my PC with the backup CD.

It contained an old folder where I had kept most of my stuff back in the day. It was named “Ben’s lair.” I double-clicked on it. Inside, there were a few more folders: “Small games,” “Music,” “School,” and, “Misc.”

Most of the games were either too old for Windows 10 or were immediately stopped by Norton when I tried to transfer the files. The only software in that folder that worked properly was *Stray Sheep*, the Japanese screen mate. And as the small sheep ran around on my screen I went through the rest of the folders. The last one was, as expected, filled with random stuff. Old DLL files, logs from some FTP server, screenshots from old *StarCraft* matches, and other games that were big at the time. That sort of junk. I was just about to close the folder and call it the night when I noticed a file titled “proof 01.bmp”. My heartbeat increased steadily as I opened it, not sure exactly why.

My reaction when I saw the image that appeared on my screen was total confusion, followed by a cold sweat. For a few seconds, I couldn’t even comprehend what I was seeing, and after my mind had finally grasped it, I still didn’t understand what it meant. It was a picture of myself, not as a teenager but as a grown man. Next to me, with my arms around her, was Julia… older than she ever actually got to be. And we seemed to be just as happy as we had been back when we were together in high school.

I quickly scrolled through the files again. There was one more picture, titled “proof 04.bmp.” In this picture, Julia was holding a speech in front of a large group of people.

“What the hell *is* this?” I asked myself.

It felt like my mind was about to turn inside out. I went through everything on the CD meticulously, but there wasn’t anything more like this on it. I went back to the box on the table and dug into it in a frenzy, hoping to find some additional clues, but I couldn’t find anything else. I sat down on my chair and stared in front of me. My body was shaking and my head was spinning. *Is this some kind of sick joke?* It didn’t make any sense. Pictures of a life I never lived… a happy life. Pictures of a life with Julia! It made me furious to see what I could have had if Julia hadn’t killed herself. All the feelings I had suppressed for so long, all the questions I had pushed aside… now they came flooding back.

I made one last attempt at finding something inside the box. This time, I found a bunch of printed pages, folded and put between the pages of a Donald Duck comic. *The Model* by Kraftwerk began playing from the stereo as I read the text on the pages. The first one was filled with instructions on how to mix some chemicals together. I dismissed it as old homework, but after I had read the rest of the pages, I realized the horrible truth behind them.

To make sense of the words on those pages, I have to share what happened to me in high school, no matter how painful it is for me to tell the story.

\*\*\*

The bullying began as soon as I started school. It was all seemingly manufactured by one kid in particular: Oliver Rachtmeister. He successfully convinced everyone that there was something inherently wrong with me because I wasn’t as wealthy as he and his friends. I remember that I sat next to him in the assembly hall on my first day of school. He was wearing an immaculate white shirt, dark trousers, and polished black shoes. His dark hair was slicked back with some sort of gel. I was wearing a pair of hand-me-down jeans and a t-shirt with a cartoon character on it. I felt very out of place. I *was* very out of place.

During the assembly, Oliver turned to me and whispered, “You’re poor, aren’t you?”

I didn’t know how to respond, so I just nodded.

He stared at me with contempt in his eyes. “I can tell. It’s written all over your face.”

I was so embarrassed and ashamed that I wanted to disappear. I wished that the ground would just open up and swallow me whole.

This marked the beginning of my hell on Earth. Oliver and his friends would trip me up in the corridors, push me around in the playground, and call me names. I was too scared to tell anyone—not even Dad, especially not Dad—because I didn’t want to be a disappointment. So, I just suffered in silence. I tried my best to ignore them, but it was hard. Some days, I would come home from school and just sit in my room and cry. I felt so alone and helpless.

Dad noticed I wasn’t as happy as before, but I kept lying to him every time he asked what was wrong. I didn’t want to worry him or make him think I was weak. Had I told him, I’m sure he would’ve gone to the school and given Oliver and his friends a piece of his mind. But I didn’t want that.

One day, after yet another humiliating experience at school, I came home and curled up in a ball on my bed and cried. I felt like I couldn’t take it anymore. I was tired of being the outcast, the one who didn’t fit in. I was tired of being bullied. I was tired of being poor. And I was tired of being tired.

I don’t know how long I lay there, but at some point, I must have fallen asleep because the next thing I remember is Dad shaking me awake.

“Wake up, sleepyhead. I’ve got something to show you.”

I rubbed my eyes sleepily and sat up.

“What is it?” I asked, still half-asleep.

“Come and see for yourself,” he replied, a smile in his voice.

I followed him downstairs, yawning and stretching. When we entered the living room, I stopped in my tracks and stared.

There, sitting on the coffee table, was a brand-new Macintosh Quadra 650.

I couldn’t believe it. Dad must have saved up for months to get me this computer. I gave him a hug and thanked him profusely.

“I know you’ve been going through a tough time lately,” he said, “and I thought this might help you take your mind off things.”

This wouldn’t change much, but it meant the world to me. This was the kind of thing Oliver and his friends would have, not me. For the first time in a long time, I felt like I belonged, or at least as if I wasn’t as good for nothing as Oliver and his friends made me out to be.

At school, everything continued as before, but now I had something to look forward to when I came home. I could escape into my own world where I was the hero, not the outcast. I could be anyone I wanted to be and do anything I wanted to do. And, for a little while, I forgot all about my problems.

There were moments I thought the bullying would stop and that I would finally be treated like an equal. Those rare occasions always gave me hope, but it always ended the same way. One time, I was invited to come along to the candy store during recess. On the way there, they all stopped in their tracks and looked at me foolishly as I continued walking a few steps. Then the boys jumped at me while the girls laughed. I had a crush at that time on one of the girls who laughed. I was reduced to tears and ran home. Another time, they came to my birthday party that my dad had arranged. Before they left, Oliver had spit in the slot of my “stupid” Genesis console and whispered to his friends to ruin my collection of hockey cards.

The bullying made it difficult for me to focus on school. I had no problems with my attention in general. For example, I had already learned HTML on the computer my dad had bought me. It was just school I couldn’t handle, the constant harassment made sure of that.

The teachers were blind to what was going on, or perhaps they didn’t want to acknowledge that they had problems. In either case, it was all allowed to continue. And when I started to ditch gym and fell behind on almost all subjects—even math, which I was actually good at—the teachers decided I was a problem. They couldn’t understand, or wouldn’t admit, that the good pupils were the reason I was failing. It didn’t help that some of those pupils were the sons and daughters of some of the richest people in the country, only because the school happened to be located in one of the wealthiest areas in the city. Oliver was one of those pupils. One of the untouchables.

Luckily, my school was small and only had classes up to third grade. After that everyone had to go to one of the larger schools. That was when all the rich kids got separated from the poorer ones, and I had always held up hope that my suffering would end as soon as it was time for me to change schools.

However, when the day finally arrived, the principal convinced my dad that I needed special education because of how far behind I was, and apparently the most prestigious school in the city—that only the richest families could afford to place their children in—had recently begun to accept special needs kids as a humanitarian effort. This was presented to my dad, who could never have afforded for me to attend that school, as good news. There was excitement in the room when it was decided over my head that I would be going to that school… to the Royal Conservatory of Education. Dad finally saw some light at the end of the tunnel, almost as if he thought that the sheer association with that school would turn my life around completely.

“A lot of your friends are going there as well,” the principal said. “Isn’t that great?”

I looked down at my hands, feeling the hair stand up on my neck.

I was put in a class with only seven students, all suffering from different mental disabilities I didn’t have. This ruined my chances of starting over. And of course, my so-called friends were none other than Oliver and his friends. They made sure the bullying continued. I was constantly picked on not only for getting special education but also for somehow trespassing and intruding. It didn’t matter that I was given the same fancy school blazer as everyone else. I didn’t belong, and they made sure I would never forget it. Everything they accused me of was now proven to be true in their cruel eyes. Why else would I attend a class with mentally disabled children? This was the worst-case scenario. For the first time, I contemplated killing myself.

But then everything changed. And this, I suppose, is where my story truly begins. I was standing in line at the canteen. I was just about to enter it when Oliver turned around and pushed me back down the line. The kids behind me pushed me back further and the kids behind them did the same and so on and so on. I broke down somewhere halfway toward the end of the line. I hated it, I hated that I couldn’t stop those damn tears from coming. My tears always proved them right, proved that I was just as weak as they said. They laughed as they pushed me down the line, and I cried as they pushed me over the edge. This would’ve been the last straw for me, the true end of the line, but instead of that natural conclusion to a story that’s been told one too many times, I finally bumped into someone who didn’t push me further back. Instead, I found myself embraced in a warm hug. A feeling I had never felt before in my entire life blossomed in my chest, pressing my despair back up my throat and turning my tears into tears of relief. I know it might sound ridiculous, but what I felt at this moment was nothing less than a miracle.

Before I even saw her face, she whispered into my ear almost as if she had known me my entire life:

“Things will be different from now on.”

I stepped back to see who had just unknowingly saved my life. She had a gentle smile and innocent eyes, which was strange considering her sharp gaze which was like a bird of prey. She removed some of her black hair sticking out from her slightly off-centered red beret from her face and asked me for my name. I stuttered it between my sobs.

“I’m Julia,” she said with an Italian accent. “This is my first day.”

Everyone standing in line had turned their heads, watching Julia with curiosity, fascination, and perplexity. And at the end of the line, in the doorframe to the canteen, Oliver stared at us with his dark eyes as if he had witnessed something beyond his comprehension.

It might be that I only remember it this way, but this blip in time felt eternal. During those few seconds, it felt like we all stood inside a photograph that depicted a turning point in our lives.

Julia wasn’t prettier than any of the other girls—that’s not the way she stood out—it was just that she exuded a form of undeniable confidence that immediately demanded respect from the people around her.

“Walk with me,” she said and proceeded up the line with me at her side.

She introduced herself to each and every person, offering them a handshake while looking at them as if she could read them like open books, and they all unconsciously straightened their backs as they received it. Oliver quickly fixed his hair as we approached him, nervously looking at me and then back at Julia. It was obvious that he had already begun to fall in love with her, just like that, and that he could no longer hurt me as long as he wanted her to like him. It made him confused and more than likely secretly annoyed.

What had happened spread quickly throughout the school. Everyone loved Julia. In a way, it was almost as if she was my total opposite. She was loved just as quickly as I had been hated. I saw the popular girls fighting over her attention, trying to make her their friend, and the boys—especially Oliver—swarmed around her like bees surrounding honey. In just a few weeks, Julia had altered the dynamics of the entire school. It was as if she had been a missing piece to a puzzle that was now finally complete. I was still mostly alone, it wasn’t like anyone wanted to be my friend all of a sudden, but I was also *left* alone, which of course had a huge impact on my life.

A few months later I was sitting alone in the school library, playing around with Visual Basics on one of the few computers at the school. The library was an impressive room, with high ceilings, chandeliers, and wooden shelves filled with books. The computers, placed on large desks in the center, were the only thing that seemed out of place. They were new and modern, while everything else was old and classic. I often came here to work on my programming projects. It was also a refuge from everyone else at the school. Here, I didn’t have to worry about fitting in or being cool. I could just be myself without anyone judging me.

On this particular day, something odd happened. As I sat typing away at the computer, I could faintly hear the choir practicing in the music hall nearby. The sound of their voices singing *Miserere Mei Deus* drifted into the library, adding soothing background noise to my work. Then, the large doors opened behind me. I heard the librarian whisper a soft hello and then footsteps stop right next to me. I turned around to see who it was, and my heart skipped a beat when I saw that it was Julia.

“What are you doing?” she asked.

Her voice was smooth, but at the same time authoritarian. Listening to her both fascinated and frightened me.

“Um,” I said. “I-I’m good, I—”

“You know how to code?” she interrupted. “Can you teach me?”

I was dumbfounded and looked at her without knowing what to say.

“Well?” she said. “The world is changing faster than anyone is realizing, and you need to know how to code if you want to stay ahead.”

“S-sure,” I said, my heart drumming out of happiness in my chest. “I’ll teach you.”

This was the second time she would disrupt my life. I had never had a friend before, but this was the day that changed. My confidence was too low for me to consider the possibility of more than friendship, but slowly but surely, I began falling in love with her. Just like everyone else. I couldn’t help it. It might be that I would have fallen for any girl that showed me the slightest bit of affection, but there was something truly compelling about Julia that made her seem almost too good for this world. My feelings for her quickly became my deepest secret, partly because I was afraid it would ruin our friendship if I ever told her.

We met up at the library every day, and after a few weeks—after she called me at my home out of the blue—we began talking over the phone during the evenings. She was a guarded person, and most of the time she only wanted to talk about programming, but from time to time she opened up and told me some of her deeper thoughts and emotions. The time I remember the most is when she told me what happened to her older sister.

“We went to the same school,” she said. “That’s actually why I had to change schools because one of the guys who raped her went to her class. I couldn’t stand seeing him every day, you know. There wasn’t sufficient proof against him and his friends.” She tried to tell me this in her normal voice, but I could sense the hatred behind her words. “No one denied the act, it was that they couldn’t prove that *she didn’t want it.* That was the problem. But who wants to have sex with several guys at once like that? She was high, dressed ‘the wrong way’, and had a sexual relationship with one of them and they all said she wanted it…” The last words that came out of her mouth felt like a punch to my stomach: “She killed herself the same day they all walked free.” I was silent on the other end of the line, unsure of what to say. “They all belonged to the same street gang,” she continued. “They called themselves Los Bárbaros.”

Julia never spoke of this again and I never brought it up, but it was clear that it was something she always carried around. It would help me understand some of the things that happened later on, but during the rest of fifth grade, I didn’t think much more of it. We were still just kids messing around in Windows NT 3.5.

Julia learned impressively fast and soon surpassed me, but she still joined me in the library during recess even after she didn’t need my help anymore. In fact, it was now she who helped me. Of course, she didn’t waste all of her time on me. She gave everyone the attention they craved, even Oliver, although she never reciprocated his feelings for her. As far as I could see, she never got involved with *anyone* in that way… which of course gave me hope. Even so, I knew that even though she had become the most important person in my life, I was one among many in hers.

During summer break that year, we finally began seeing each other in our free time. I was never allowed to visit her place, but she often came over to my dad’s place and either played *StarCraft* with me or worked on some new project that we had going together. She said it wouldn’t be fun at her place anyway since she didn’t have an internet connection. It wasn’t that she was poor—far from it—just that the internet was a new deal. I myself used a 56k modem to dial up. Still, it was Julia who introduced me to the concept of hacking. She brought it up rather casually while we were finalizing a small DOS game which, until now, had been our main project.

“We should become hackers,” she said, still standing at the door, smiling innocently beneath her beret.

I laughed, guessing she was joking. “Yeah, right.”

“I’m serious!” she said and basically forced herself inside. “Think about it. Soon the entire world will run on computers. I just want to stay ahead, you know.”

She gave the impression that she said these things and came up with these ideas on a whim, but I always felt like she had actually put a lot of thought behind it, almost as if she was acting out steps in a complicated plan that she wasn’t sharing with me. She always said she wanted to stay ahead like she was in a race not to fall behind the wheel of time. I didn’t ask that many questions, though, since it was nothing more than a hunch anyway. In either case, this was the third time Julia changed my life.

For the rest of the summer, we changed our approach and began studying ways to make computer viruses and other malicious software. Ironically, this meant that we spent just as much time at the public library reading magazines and books on encryption as in front of our computers. I was pretty good at math, even as a thirteen-year-old, but reading didn’t do that much for me since the best way for me to learn was by doing. Julia on the other hand could do both, although at times she was frustrated with certain concepts, and she managed to implement what she learned rather quickly.

We didn’t make anything impressive during this time, just some files that in theory could destroy or damage the victim’s computer. Since we didn’t have access to that many computers, we couldn’t really test our files. We only managed to “nuke” a library computer by putting one of our files on a floppy disk that we inserted into the machine. It made me feel conflicted; on one hand, I was glad that our work had paid off, but on the other, I realized that we had just done something really bad. Not only that, but I was also afraid we would get into trouble. Julia, on the other hand, didn’t show any sign of either fear or remorse. She just looked at me with a satisfied smirk on her face and said:

“This is the beginning of something beautiful.”

When school started, they had placed more computers in the library and installed Windows 95 on them. We didn’t want to damage them with our files, but we did test some of the less destructive ones and also began researching how to hack into the system so that we could access whatever it was the teachers were doing. At the same time, the messenger client ICQ became popular, and that changed the ways we interacted with each other and with the other kids at school. Everyone added Julia, and she managed to convince almost everyone to download the program to stay in touch, but for a long time, my list only had her nickname on it: Minerva.

It was around this time that she told one of her classmates—a boy named Victor—about a file she said I had made. We had made it together, but I guess she didn’t want anyone to know about her involvement. It was a file that she had named Obitus. Victor sent it over to someone else, telling him or her that it was a game, and when he got confirmation that the file had crashed the victim’s computer, he added me on ICQ and told me how impressed he was with what I had made. This was another turning point. Slowly, a rumor began spreading, thanks to Julia, that I was a hacker—much more competent than I actually was—and more and more of the other boys at school began adding me on ICQ. Julia kept this rumor alive, and I didn’t question it because deep down I liked the attention.

I gave away some of the less harmful files that we had made. The most popular one was a file that generated several folders on the desktop with forbidden characters in their names which meant that they could only be deleted from the DOS prompt. Since most people didn’t know how to do that, they were stuck with all those folders on their desktops.

I was even approached in school by pupils who not only wanted to use our files but also learn how to make their own. Oliver, who had refrained from bullying me since the day Julia started at our school, took notice. His hate for me was still burning in his chest even though he had tried to hide it, and one day he decided to jump me out of the blue. He grabbed my arm, spun me around, and threw me to the floor. One of his classmates intervened.

“Dude,” he said, “stop. Don’t you know what he can do?”

Oliver stopped, not so much because of what I could do, but because he didn’t get the reactions from his friends that he had hoped for. It confused him, and therefore even more enraged, but there was nothing he could do. Julia showed up a few moments later, forcing a fake smile on Oliver’s face. He patted me on the shoulder.

“We were just having some fun.”

She said she needed to talk to me. I followed her to the cafeteria. As always, everyone looked at her when she entered the room. I ordered a toast and sat down with her. I could tell from the eagerness on her face that she had come up with a new idea, or at least that she was ready to inform me about it. She gave me her usual smile, almost as if she felt she had to make an effort to convince me, and said:

“Don’t you think we should do something good with all of this?”

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“Right now, our friends are using our stuff to fuck with people. There is no thought behind it. There are so many bad people out there, you know, and more and more of them are coming online. We should send our files to them, not just to random strangers. Innocent people don’t deserve to have their computers destroyed. We’ve some people who are eager to help now—it doesn’t just have to be you and me—we just need to give them a *direction*. You know what I mean? We need to add a sense of *purpose* behind their actions.”

“What are you suggesting?” I asked, afraid of the words “not just you and me” since it sounded a little bit like she wasn’t satisfied with hanging out with me alone.

“We should organize!” She gave me a huge smile. “I think it will be fun. We’ll do it together, okay?” I felt relief hearing those words. “We’ll begin with something simple.” She paused as if to think, as always just as if she was coming up with her ideas on the fly even though they seemed thoroughly thought out. “Let’s begin with establishing a chain of command. I don’t think it will be possible to have two leaders, at least not officially, so even though we decide everything together I can take the role of leader while you become my number one—so to speak—and therefore second-in-command. Are you with me so far?”

“Y-yeah, but what are we talking about here—” I began.

“My idea is that everyone who wants to use our files has to join our little organization, and they will be given a specific rank or whatever depending on how good they are. We give them missions—or targets if you like—and depending on how well they perform they can climb in rank. At least within their own group.”

“Group?” I asked. “There’s more than one?”

“Doesn’t that make sense?” she said. “If we allow for several hierarchies, there will be more room for advancement among our members and therefore a greater motivation among them to fight for a higher rank. We need to foster ambition if we want this to work. So, we should have several groups, maybe based on which class you’re in or maybe based on who you’re friends with or both, and they should all have their individual commander who is sworn in by us. I strongly believe this project has potential.”

I must have looked like a living question mark when she told me all this and I nodded along with a stupid-looking smile. Julia remained silent for a minute, rocking her chair, and said, “So many are joining different street gangs, you know, and then there’s the skinheads recruiting people even from our school. I just think we should offer an alternative with a vision behind it. An organization that’s fighting for something good!”

Later that night, I saw that she had added “Imperial Legate” in brackets before her nickname on ICQ. She wrote to me as soon as she saw that I came online: “Hey! Please add the following in front of your username the same way I did: Legion Legat. That’s your title.”

“What does it mean?” I asked, and at the same time, she told me.

“It’s the post beneath mine. You’re the overall legion commander and I’m, officially, the commander of legion commanders. It’s just a formality, really. I’ve decided that we should name our organization Legion Zero, which justifies this ranking system. I just thought it was cool. Do you like it?”

“Um, sure… but imperial? Isn’t that a bit too much?” I added a smiley.

It took a while for her to answer, which made me nervous, but then I heard the “uh-oh!” sound from ICQ and immediately opened our message box.

“It makes sense, trust me.” No smiley. “Every commander will have to add ‘Centurion’ before their names, and their soldiers—the ordinary legionaries—will add their commander’s initials and a number signifying their rank before their names. It’s super simple. Every cohort will have its own centurion who commands a set of soldiers, and together we all form Legion Zero. Anyway, all we have to do now is recruit the first centurions and fill the [ranks](https://www.reddit.com/r/tobiasmalm/comments/112r4le/i_just_released_my_novel_the_cave_to_another/)!”
