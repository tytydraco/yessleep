I suppose you could say I abandoned them. Every year, as was tradition, I would go trick or treating with these four other kids who lived in the same cul-de-sac as I did. It was easy for our parents that way, I suppose. Our ages varied and I didn't hang out with them much for the rest of the year, as I had just turned fourteen and the rest were either eleven or twelve. This was my last year going, begrudgingly, trick or treating with them, and they knew it. They wanted to do something special for the last observance of our tradition, but I couldn't care less. By some blessing, I'd been handed a golden ticket, an invitation to the Brookers’ Halloween party. The Brooker twins were the coolest kids in my high-school, and their annual Halloween parties were converted. They were now seniors, and only a few freshman students ever made it in. I was now one of them. I was more than ready to head to their house, which was practically a mansion, and experience my first real party. But my mother had other plans. She heard buzz from the other neighbourhood parents of how excited their children were to go trick or treating with me for the last time. She decided it was time to let her youngest, my little brother Shane, out to trick or treat for the first time. Of course, she wanted me to chaperone. 

I moaned and groaned, and begged her to let me go to the party. She strictly forbade it, warning me that she heard talk of alcoholic prevalence at those parties. Then, she started ranting about how absent Mr Brooker was, who was now rarely seen around town and from what I heard, was abroad for Halloween. The idea of a large, parent-free house sounded perfected to me, but was what repelled my mother. As the evening on the 31st came around, I pulled on my hastily made robot costume and was greeted at the door by Shane. Shane was only four, and wore a bulbous pumpkin onesie. He carried a pumpkin shaped trick or treat bucket that was nearly the same size as he was. My mother saw us off, telling me that I could stay out as late as ten, as long as Shane was ok. I was already out of earshot when she started listing off conditions. 

The rest of the gang were waiting for me further down the street, and doted over Shane when they saw him. What followed was the usual. Walking from house to house, begging for candy. I felt self conscious of partaking in this childish ritual while I had the wisps of a moustache growing. Thankfully, the presence of Shane eased the embarrassment, as it appeared like an older brother tasked with taking their sibling out for the night, which was exactly my situation. The gang's grand plan for the night was to egg the house of this old woman, who Parker, the ring leader of the group, seemed to particularly hate for whatever reason. We had begun down her street, not too far from the Brooker household, when I decided to peel off from the group. Shane was asleep on my shoulders at this point, giving me a solid excuse to leave. I told them I was going home, and they all remorsefully bid me a farewell. They continued bickering as I left, unaware of my ulterior motives. It was now just after eight o clock, giving me around an hour and a half to show my face at the party and climb the popularity ladder, factoring in the time it took to get there and back before ten. I wished I could've snuck off earlier, and maybe things would've gone differently if I had, but I had to spend time with those kids. Otherwise, they'd go home and tell their parents of my absence and that information would quickly make its way to my mother. At least now I had plausible deniability. 

The Brooker family estate lay just outside of town, a short walk from the so-called “nice side.” A long driveway led up through the trees, so long you didn't have a hope of seeing the house from the front gate. That was where I found myself walking up on this night, with my younger brother asleep on my shoulders. He was starting to stir, thankfully. I really couldn't hold him much long, and I thought quietly to myself that in a few short years, I wouldn't be able to lift him up at all. Midway up the driveway, cars started to appear. Decorating either side, they'd been driven here by the kids old enough to own a license. I looked at them in awe as I helped Shane back down to his feet, and he started to walk by my side once again, holding my sleeve. I felt butterflies in my stomach, not just at the excitement of my first real party, but also because I was going against my mother, which was a rare occurrence. On top of all that, there was no one here that I really knew, just some casual acquaintances. I was also one of the youngest people in attendance, apart from Shane. I bribed him with candy to say nothing to our parents, and planned to stick with him in a less occupied part of the Brooker household. 

Which was a mansion. It loomed out from behind the pines just after a bend in the driveway. There was a fountain in the center of a pristine gravel clearing, surrounded by yet more cars. Teens were everywhere, hanging out around the massive porch. Many were smoking, letting the night breeze carry away the evidence. The whole building reminded me of a modernised antebellum plantation, and I would've assumed it was if not for that fact we were in Maine. I kept Shane close to my side as I walked up the steps to the front door. People watched as we shrugged by, and I realised I had no idea what I was in for. As soon as we passed the threshold, we were in the fray. Already drunk teens ran riot, music blared, people screamed. Immediately, Shane started to tug at my sleeve, wanting to go. I awkwardly made my way through the crowd, passed some very attractive women and into the kitchen. It was quieter in there. Unopened snacks and cans were piled on the kitchen island. Three people were hanging around, drinking and talking to each other. They turned and stared me down as I stumbled in. 

“Hey man, what are you supposed to be dressed as? A child kidnapper?” Said the one dressed as Ash Williams. 

The other two laughed as I blushed. Ash stepped forward and handed me a can. 

“Drink up,” he commanded. 

And I did. With my younger brother in one hand and a rotating selection of alcoholic drinks in the other, I tried to make the most of my short time here. I don't remember too much of that part of the night, thinking back on it. I became more drunk as Shane got more agitated. It was a blur of bumping into people as I walked aimlessly around the truly massive house. At times, it felt like every teen in the county was there, and all accommodated by the mansion's size. I don't think I ever even saw either of the Brooker twins, not that they'd want to be seen with someone as low on the social ladder as me. The house was too large for the party to be concentrated in any one room, and I found myself going between pockets of people. Eventually, this led me outside. It was nice to be under the night sky again, surrounded by fresh air instead of stumbling idiots. The Brookers had no real backyard, just a collection of wooden seats and picnic tables on flat earth that eventually led into the forest. There was no barrier between the trees and the property, and I wondered how far into the woods their ownership extended. Either way, a group of people had begun piling kindling from the woodshed into a large pile, intent on making a bonfire. Shane seemed less anxious outside, so I decided to stick with this group. 

The longer the night went on, the larger the pile became, and larger too was the crowd of people around us. By nine-thirty, I should've started thinking about going home. Too drunk to consider the punishment I'd get if I missed my 10 PM window, I continued helping increase the pyre while Shane sat at one of the varnished, mahogany picnic tables, eating away at his trick or treat candy and mine. I can remember I started talking to a girl around then, although I can't remember what about, nor would I recognise her today. We stood close to each other, our hands brushing flirtatiously as we watched the flames erupt. I was forced to take a cautious step back as the wave of heat hit me. Before long, a mountain of flame was created, and barely contained within the small ring of rocks. Teens, some as drunk as I was, some more, danced around the flames. They hollered and howled, letting the primitive impulses of their brain bubble to the surface. That was the effect bonfires tended to have, especially when experienced with large groups of people. Burnt wood collapsed in on itself, and the fire began to lower as the frame they sprung from was reduced to embers. I stuck to swaying, going back and forth with the girl next to me. When I could, I looked in her eyes and saw a bright orange reflection. I felt that every worry and commitment I had had melted away from me, and carried away in the autumn breeze as some form of smoke. 

Then I felt a tugging on my sleeve. I tore my hand away, agitated. Shane stood by my side, begging me to take him home. No shot. I was finally enjoying myself, and wasn't about to give up my first kiss to take him back to mother. I shook a condescending and dismissive hand in his direction, and turned away. Then another tug. Shane stood there in his bulbous pumpkin costume, yanking at my cuff, trying to lead me away from the best night of the year. I took my hand away more forcefully this time, trying to nudge me away. My soon-to-be girlfriend, I hoped at that moment, was looking at me strangely. I was about to speak, however slurred it may have been, when I felt a hand grab my wrist, followed by more fucking tugging. I looked at Shane, who was starting to cry. I let out an exaggerated sigh and shoved him away. He whimpered as he fell backwards, stumbling over his own feet and losing balance.

He tried to steady himself but failed, and was propelled towards the bonfire. The last failure of his balance came as he tripped over the ring of stones. My eyes widened and I let out a scream, as did half a dozen or so people around me. I rushed forward, but did nothing. Shane fell backwards into the flames, which licked out to meet him. He disappeared into the heat, screaming until the combustion robbed him of his voice. I stood and watched, watched as he writhed and burned. His costume melted away, and dripped down his body like wax. Soon it was him who was dripping, bits of him, falling off the bone and into the pile of charred debris. By the time party goers arrived with buckets of water and blankets, Shane was dead. With the fire extinguished, it was I who pulled his body from the charcoal. At first, I mistook him for charcoal. His corpse looked like a dead spider, the limbs curled tight, I remember thinking to myself as I collapsed to my knees. 

Few have a single moment they can point to being the defining moment of their lives. Some would try, saying it was the death of a spouse or a sudden diagnosis. But on their own, these events are nebulous. They're defined by your reaction to them. Because of this, it is still you, at the end of the day, who defines your own life. I didn't have the same privilege. The night, October 31st 2008, irreparably destroyed my life, both what I had and what was to come. My parents were broken by what happened to their little boy, and their lives degraded. My father lost his job and soon took to alcohol. My mother did too, to a lesser extent, although her preferred coping method was just turning off. She'd sit on her bed in her room for hours at a time, not moving. Sometimes she'd be in there for days. Occasionally my dad would send me in there to give her food, when he found the courage to speak to me. Every time I did, I would see the last meal I delivered her left rotting on the floor, untouched. She was a modicum of her former self. 

The grief we faced was drowned out by the despair of the community. Nine children, not including Shane, were killed or went missing that Halloween night. Our cul-de-sac seemed to be the epicentre of the victims. Three of the children I went trick or treating with earlier that night were among them. Not my closest, but by far my oldest friends. Gone, in the same night I lost my brother and, really, my family. A year to the day of deaths, a memorial service was held in the town's chapel. It was packed to the rafters, and that was just the families of the deceased. Many more remained in the parking lot, or in the grief counselling tent manned by Gary, my Sunday school teacher. I slunk off during the service, unable to bear the eyes. People blamed me for Shane's death, and maybe they were right to do so. The weight of their judgement paralysed me, and turned me into a recluse. At the service a spotted a boy called Rowan. He was my brother's closest friend at Kindergarten, and I was attacked by memories of them playing together in my backyard. That was too much, and I rushed out of the chapel to a chorus of murmurs and spiteful glances. 

I wondered for a bit, away from the chapel and the busy streets. Eventually I crossed over the small park, passed the gazebo and on towards the woods. They were a place of solace to me since I was a child, and now I felt them calling to me again. I passed the ferny threshold and entered the forest. The pine trees all stood firm and I knew they'd be here longer than I would. After a while of aimless walking, I sat on a log and put my head in my hands. There was nothing I could do but weep. This Halloween was sterile. There were no decorations out, no pumpkins carved and certainly no children allowed out to trick or treat. In my slump, I blamed myself for robbing the town of this holiday. As I wallowed, I heard something. The cracking of twigs. I turned, and saw death. 

Shane was standing just a few yards in front of me. He was damaged, but I would never forget his face, especially not the variant I saw screaming back at me from within the flames. The pumpkin costume had melted, and was clinging to his charred body. Blackened bone was visible between gaps of cooked flesh, and I realised the snapping sound that accompanied his walk came from his fused joints grinding and not anything underfoot. A steady trail of smoke rose from his nose and the corners of his mouth, which was bent like a horseshoe down into a miserable grimace. I got to my feet but could move no more. Fear and regret washed over me as I watched my brother near. 

“I'm… sorry,” I choked out. 

The words burned as I said them, and they seemed to have no effect on Shane. I could smell him now. It was the smell of sour grease, and it made me gag. Finally I regained control over my body and took a step back as he entered touching distance. His eyes, once a light blue, were the first things to fizzle and pop as he was engulfed in the fire. Now his scab covered sockets were filled with embers, which shone in the shadow of the pines. I let out a defeated whimper as I stared into them. Knowing I couldn't confront him now, I turned and ran. I didn't look back as I crashed through the forest, eventually bursting out into the park. I ran past the gazebo and didn't stop running until my lungs gave out. I stopped at the road and started to make my way up the inclining sidewalk that led into main street. Between pants, I realized I could hear something off in the distance. Sirens. I looked up to see a flash of red go by near the end of the street. It was a fire engine, heading towards the chapel. 

Apparently it was a fault in the electrics. It could've been prevented, easily, if only they had the money to replace the wiring that had been there since the 70s. It was a matter of when, not if, the newsreader said. The real tragedy was that it finally did happen while so many people were gathered inside the building. The fire claimed the lives of eight people, although we should be thankful it wasn't more they all said. Two of those eight people were my parents. It was my mother's first time out of the house since Shane's funeral, which she demanded be an open casket. In the span of a year I was now left with no close family, and I knew why. It was punishment, divine or cosmic, for what I had done that Halloween night. Soon after losing my parents, I was sent to live with my Aunt and Uncle who lived upstate among the pines. 

For a while, tragedy ended here. I was cared for, and quickly made friends at the small, remote school I now attended. Every Halloween, however, I'd see him. Usually a glimpse from a window, where I'd spot him off in the forest, watching the house. One year I decided to not look outside at any point during the day of the 31st. On this occasion, he appeared in the corner of my room. I simply rolled over in bed, and held my breath until the smell of an uncleaned grease trap disappeared. 2010 was the hardest, as I was convinced he'd burn down my new home. That never happened, and I was granted solace, apart from the annual appearance, for the next decade and a half. In that time I went to college and fell in love, as so many do. Her name was Amy and we were married by 2016, and parents by 2018. Family life was a comfort for me, a sense of normality that was absent throughout my teens. I raised my son well, I like to think, although he was quite sheltered. I forbid him from trick or treating, although the covid pandemic helped enforce that rule. My son's Uncle would still appear to me. Like clockwork, I'd spend the day racked with guilt and anticipation for Shane's appearance. He always arrived, even just in the corner of my eye. No one else ever saw him, judging from the reaction to his appearance at a halloween party last year, or the lack thereof.

I wasn't used to seeing him, I knew I never would be, but my eyes tended to glaze over when I saw him. It wasn't a shock anymore, just a horrifying fact. I hadn't spoken a word to him since 2009, but decided this was the year. Halloween 2025. I would confront my personal demon. And where better to do so than in my hometown? I was surfing the web a few weeks ago, and saw that my old home was now a B&B. On a whim, I decided to book a stay for the Halloween weekend. My wife was surprisingly thrilled, as I had always been reluctant to talk about my life before I met her. She received snippets, and knew the gist of what had happened to my family. She could always tell how raw the wound was, and didn't push me too far. This trip, I decided, I would tell all. We packed our things, just enough for a five day stay, and headed north. 

It was a three hour drive from my new life, but it felt much longer. Mentally too, my hometown had been the furthest thing from my mind since I left it. Not by choice, but by the active suppression of my connection to it. Other than one or two, I really couldn't remember anyone who might still be living there. It was afternoon by the time we drove past the erroneous sign displaying the town's name and population, with “welcome” and “come back soon” written on opposing sides. We finally cleared the pines, which had been on either side of the road for much of the journey, and began to pass houses. As I drove, I realised just how little the place had changed. It was a little more run down, sure, but other than that it felt like it'd been preserved. Untouched. I didn't notice a single new building that wasn't around when I was a teen. I drove past suburban rows of houses, and eventually turned into a familiar street. 


My former house was right at the end of the cul-de-sac, built further back than the rest of the row, breaking the pattern. The paint was new, and a side hung above the door letting people know it was now a B&B rather than a residential building like the ones around it. I helped Amy heave luggage from the trunk while my son excitedly ran around the finely trimmed yard. With a strange feeling I can't quite describe, possibly a mix of nostalgia and disgrace, I made my way up the path and onto the white porch. I entered with the ring of a bell and was greeted by a fragile old woman who sat behind a makeshift desk. I told her who I was as she showed us to our rooms. She became enthralled with emotion, and let me have a private tour around the entire house. Not all that much of the layout had changed, apart from the conversion of a dining room and office into yet more bedrooms. The decorations were foreign, but I found I could still traverse the building with my eyes closed. The old widow, Mavis, retired back to her room once we were settled in. All three of us were in the same room, me sharing a bed with Amy while my son had one to his own. It was nice. Quaint. The whole place smelled like linen. I lied there for a while and remembered creaking open the door and seeing the husk of my mother sitting in here, between piles of molding plates and clothes wet with tears. 

The next day was spent doing a little walking tour of the town, acting as a guide as I told my wife and son about the places we passed. It was a fun day out, and I got to relive a few of my happier memories from childhood, scarce as they may be. In the evening we ate with Mavis, who told us her life story. It was her husband's dream of running this place, and he died of an aneurysm just weeks after opening. There was no sign of grief in the old woman's eyes or tone as she spoke. It wasn't that she was cold and heartless, she had just grown to accept the hand she'd been dealt. She gave me hope. The next day, Halloween, I went for a walk on my own. I was hoping Shane would appear while I was out, so I could finally talk to him in full. For much of the day I walked the streets, which were covered in Halloween decorations. Every house I passed seemed to have been invaded by Jack o'Lanterns. The effort the town put into Halloween seemed to dwarf what it had been when I was a child. The place had clearly moved on from the stigma that surrounded the holiday. Why couldn't I? It was getting late now and still no sign of Shane. I even spent some time walking by the forest's edge, although I never found the courage to enter the green darkness. It was finally time to get back to my family, I thought to myself, and that's when I saw it. Rising in the distance. Smoke. 

The smoke was accompanied by an orange glow. Sirens blared as I ran terrified towards the source. As I did, sprinting across roads and through allies, I realised the fire was too close to possibly be my house. I finally emerged into the effect street, where a fire engine had already arrived, along with a cop car. One of the many stores was engulfed in flames, and beginning to collapse in on itself. The place was called Largo's Novelties, a costume and mask store that became insanely popular around Halloween. It was a store vital to my childhood, and I felt a strange sense of symbolism watching it smoulder. Crowds of would-be customers stood outside, some dressed in its wares. Thankfully, firemen were already bringing the fire under control, and it looked as though much of the dull, unassuming location would be saved, apart from the roof. A cop waved me away, and I began to walk back to the B&B, deeply relieved. I arrived before dark, passing countless trick or treaters as I walked. 

My family had eaten, and I found them reading in our room. I grabbed dinner earlier at the small Vietnamese restaurant that I'm overjoyed was still open. Amy told me that they'd gone to the park earlier, and that she spotted me off in the distance by the trees, although I didn't respond to her shouts. She then asked if anything was on my mind, and how I was dealing with being back. I gave my son his headphones and let him play some game on my tablet while I talked to his mother in private, or as much privacy as could be found in a single room. Once I was certain he was distracted, I opened up. I told Amy, for the first time in our marriage, that it was me who was responsible for my brother's death. I told her that my parents died because of me too, in a less direct way. I told her how I saw Shane every year since on Halloween, and came back here for this trip to try and finally talk to him. Her face cycled through a series of emotions, from shock to horror then to something akin to understanding. She comforted me as I began to cry, although I noticed her embrace felt cautious. Reserved. She whispered to me that I didn't need to hide these things from her, and I told her I knew. My son noticed my distress and left the tablet where it was, jumping onto our bed and throwing his arms around me. We decided to have an early night that night, as we were all tired. I fell asleep happy to not have seen Shane for the first Halloween since he died. 

I awoke to the smell of smoke, which I had become intimately acquainted with. I slowly sat up and swung my legs out of bed, expecting to see my forever little brother standing in the corner of the room. When no orange glow caught my eye, I switched the bedside lamp on, making my wife stir. The room, now lit, was clearly only occupied by us three. I decided to journey to the toilet while I was up, and switched the lamp off. As had been when I was a boy, there was only one bathroom in the house, which was downstairs. I left my room and was immediately hit by a waft of smoke. Fire crackled on the first floor and I ran back to my family, coughing and spluttering. They were awoken by the sounds of my struggle to breathe. I hastily explained the situation and told them we had to flee. They both tried to grab a bag or a needed possession but I knew there was no time, I took my wife by the wrist and my son by the hand and fled. We burst out of the room and into the smoke filled hallway. I crouched low, just short of crawling, and made sure my family did the same. We collectively ran down the stairs and into where the fire had taken hold. Thankfully, it seemed to mostly be relegated to the kitchen. There was a clear, flameless path to the front door and although the heat was still oppressive, I held my wife and son close as we bolted outside. 

The night was cold, giving a strange contrast. Mavis stood in her garden, being attended to by a young woman. She was muttering to herself about not replacing the smoke alarms in a cadence that felt depressively senile. Another neighbour, a middle aged man, stood near them talking on the phone. I gathered he was calling 911, and felt a wave of relief wash over me. 

“Where… is he?” My wife barely choked out the words through tears. I had never seen her so frightened..

“Who…?” I began, then trailed off. 

I looked down to my side. I was holding the hand of a young boy. The skin was peeling and charred, as was the rest of him. The fabric of a pumpkin costume had been heated to the point it fused with the flesh. Two embers squinted at me, accompanied by a lipless smile. Quickly, Shane faded into ashen dust which was carried off by the wind along with swirling leaves of yellow and red. I looked back at my wife. Both of us stared at each other, our mouths opening and closing, consumed by devastation as we processed our situation. It hit as soon as we heard his voice. We both turned quicker than was thought possible and saw our son screaming in terror from the right, upstairs bedroom. Immediately, our parental senses forced us to abandon our better judgement and we both headed back to the front door. The man, the same man who'd been on the phone, shouted and tried to stop us from diving headfirst into our deaths. Clearly, he wasn't a parent. The man ran after us, and grabbed Amy just before she could follow me into the burning building.

 I heard the door slam shut behind me, and knew it was some other force that had driven it closed. The flames now engulfed the lounge, and licked at the base of the stairs. I lifted the collar of my night shirt up past my nose, although it gave me little protection. My forearm sizzled against the heated brass knob that adorned the end of the staircase's banister. I ignored the pain and rushed up through the blanket of smoke, which hung above me like clouds on a stormy day. I reached the second story and burst into our room, which had once been my mother's room and could well soon be my final resting place. The room was crowded. I fell to my hands and knees to escape asphyxiation, and gazed up at almost a dozen children. Most were dressed in a Halloween costume. One in a skin-tight Spiderman suit, another, who had a large head wound, was a wolfman. All had glowing eyes like a candle flicker. Among them was the gang. My group of friends I spent the first half of that fateful night trick or treating with. Olivia in her homemade robot costume that consisted of egg cartons and foil and David, who was the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Zach wore a snake charmer outfit, which was really just an excuse for him to play his clarinet in public. Parker was the lucky one of the bunch, who survived. The fact that he wasn't here made me realise what connected the children in this room. They were the ones who died on October 30th 2008. 

In the center of this group was the burning figure of my younger brother. Next to him was my son, who, almost seven years ago when he was born, I named Shane. I watched him now, frightened and surrounded, clutching the hand of my little brother. 

“Please,” I pleaded, my voice muffled, “let him go.”

“You're not supposed to be here,” my little brother began. Smoke bellowed from his mouth as he spoke which swirled and gathered at the ceiling with the rest. They were the first words we'd spoken in over a decade.

“I know,” I said, coughing, “I can leave, just let me bring my son.”

“You're not supposed to be here,” my brother repeated, his voice a low and unnatural mockery of how he used to sound, “you died seventeen years ago tonight.”

“No,” I gagged, “you did.”

My younger brother shook his head slowly, flakes of burnt skin falling from his neck as he did. Then he spoke for a final time. 

“Join us,” It said and held out its hand. 

My terrified son, Shane, screamed then and tore me from the conversation. I ran to my feet and grabbed him, a clear plan in my head. I dragged him to the window, which only opened wide enough for a small gap. I called out for some, anyone, to catch my son. I watched as Amy positioned herself under the window, along with the concerned man. A crowd of neighbours soon gathered, and I saw the lights of a fire engine draw near. I lifted Shane to the gap, holding him close. I told him to trust me and, for the last time, told him that I loved him. Then I let go. I watched as he fell into the arms of his mother, who was held up by the crowd. I fell backward, the smoke unbearably tearing at my eyes. I looked up, and saw that I was still surrounded. 

“Michael,” the apparitions of my childhood friends began to chant as one, “Michael, Michael.”

I rolled over onto my stomach and took out my phone. I began writing this while sat on a park bench waiting for my brother to appear earlier today. It began as a way to collect my thoughts, and to process what I could say. It now ends as my final message to my wife and child. A goodbye, typed as my lungs fill with poison. Even if my phone melts with the rest of me, I hope someone online makes sure this finds its way to them. Amy, you are the love of my life. When I first met you, I couldn't imagine spending my years with anyone else. You hold half of my heart, and that's how I know I'll live on. My final thoughts were of you and Shane, and that's what made death bearable. Shane, you will never know how much I love you. My only regret with life was that I couldn't spend more of it with you. Never forget me, and remember to cherish the memories you have of your father. They can never leave you. Memories never [do](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/X4g7YiFx6A).
