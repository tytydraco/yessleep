I was on my way to hang out in the park not too far from the house I lived in when I encountered an abstract-styled graffiti painted on the wall at the back of the park. I passed this wall almost every day whenever I went to the park, and I remembered not seeing this particular graffiti the day before.

A graffiti can be drawn in mere hours, and it might have been done during the time I wasn’t there—I get that. But something about this graffiti intrigued me, and I couldn’t put my finger on it.

I shrugged it off and walked toward the park, just around the corner.

A few weeks ago, I had befriended a new boy in the park. A quiet one. I’m an introvert myself, but I could use some company too. So being friends with someone who didn’t talk much was a blessing. We played on the slides or jungle gym side by side, ran around the park, barely speaking. Just having fun.

A blessing.

“Hey, I’m gonna need to take a leak. I’ll be back,” I said to Toby, my new, quiet friend, as I stood up and ran toward one of the restrooms in the park. He didn’t say a word, just quietly nodded.

When I was done with my business and opened the restroom door, I saw him being dragged out of the park’s gate by the neck. The boy dragging him was Axel, a bully everyone tried to avoid. He didn’t dare to bully me anymore—or any other kid in the park—since all our parents had gathered to pay his parents a visit and warned them to teach their son to stop harassing kids. Otherwise, they’d take legal action.

But Toby was new. He had told me his parents had just moved to town the same week I met him—about two weeks ago. Toby and his family didn’t know about Axel. Axel, on the other hand, knew Toby was new.

He found someone fresh to bully, someone he was sure he could get away with—for a while.

I had never been a strong kid; I couldn’t fight. But I couldn’t just let something bad happen to Toby. He was a nice kid. So I quietly followed them to the back of the park. They stopped far from the road, only a few meters from the strange graffiti I had seen earlier.

I watched from afar, trying to think of a way—or at least a moment—to pull Toby out of there.

Axel beat him up so badly. It seemed obvious that Axel was treated poorly at home, venting his anger and frustration on others. Since the recent warning to his parents, he’d been holding back, likely afraid of the consequences. But now, he found his outlet in Toby. Poor kid.

I had the strongest urge to help, but realizing I wasn’t good at fighting—or even running—I stayed hidden behind a tree nearby.

That’s when I saw something strange and terrifying happen right before my eyes.

When Axel seemed to tire from beating up Toby, the quiet boy suddenly stood up and charged at the bully with all his might. Axel wasn’t ready for it. Toby grabbed him by the torso and kept pushing him backward until Axel’s back hit the wall.

Toby kept charging, shoving Axel’s body into the wall as though he was trying to bury the bully through it. It didn’t make sense to me—Axel was big, and Toby was small in comparison. The only reason Toby succeeded in pinning Axel to the wall was that Axel wasn’t prepared, and the wall wasn’t far behind him.

But to my horror, I saw Axel’s body begin to sink into the wall.

Slowly, the parts of Axel starting from his back already inside the wall transformed into an abstract-styled 2D graphic—like a graffiti.

Toby was turning Axel into graffiti by pushing him into the wall, blending him into it. Axel, caught off guard, froze in horror. His face was a mask of terror.

When most of Axel’s body—except for his face—had been consumed by the wall and transformed into graffiti, Toby stepped back.

“Yesterday,” Toby said slowly and calmly to Axel’s face, “one of your friends came to the park to bully me, just like you did. Didn’t you wonder why he’s missing today?”

Toby raised a finger and pointed to the other graffiti on the wall—the one I’d seen earlier.

“There he is,” Toby continued, his voice steady, “buried in the wall, transformed into graffiti. Just like you.”

It hit me. I finally understood why the strange graffiti felt so unsettling earlier. It was Dylan, Axel’s friend, who used to bully kids in the park with him before the parents’ intervention.

“With him, and now you, gone,” Toby said, his voice eerily calm, “the park will be a safer place for all the kids in town.”

As he finished, Toby placed his palm on Axel’s face and pushed it into the wall. And just like that, Axel’s entire body transformed into a two-dimensional graffiti.

I thought it was over, but then Toby turned his head toward me. He stared at me from a distance, his expression calm and unreadable.

He knew I had been there the whole time.

“Did he... did he die?” I asked, my voice trembling. I didn’t know how to react to his cold stare.

“Not at first,” Toby replied, still calm, emotionless—just like always. “But he’ll have trouble breathing as a two-dimensional graffiti on a wall, so... yeah, he’ll die. Eventually.”

“So... this... is... murder…?” I asked cautiously.

Toby nodded. Calmly.
