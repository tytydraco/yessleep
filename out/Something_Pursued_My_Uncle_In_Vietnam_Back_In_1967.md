Several years ago, while my Uncle Bob was dying of cancer, he told me a story about something terrifying that happened to him while serving in Vietnam.

It was sort of a deathbed confession if you will.

Anyway, to describe my Uncle Bob's (my dad's younger brother) character...

Well, he was a good Christian man who would have given you the shirt off his back if it helped you (sorry to sound so cliche).

My uncle who never got married or, had kids of his own treated me like a daughter and tried to instill good values in me.

He taught me to always tell the truth and wasn't the type of person who was scared easily either.

Anyway, as he began to tell me his story I could hear the fear in his voice (which was unusual for him) so, I knew then that everything he was about to tell me was going to be true.

After taking a sip of water that sat on his nightstand, he began his story...

It was the summer of 67.

I was in the army and just arrived in Vietnam a month earlier.

I was a naive 20-year-old who had never been this far away from home.

I remember too, that it was unbearably hot my first month there.

Anyway, to pass the time at the camp we would drink, smoke, and listen to great music like CCR.

It was during my 2nd week there when we received a distress call from a platoon that had gone missing 2 weeks earlier.

I, along with several other men were given the task to retrieve them.

We packed our gear and immediately left camp without any incident.

Maybe a week into the mission though, we stumbled upon an abandoned village.

Except for a fire that was still burning, there was no sign of life.

Although the place felt off, it was decided that we would spend the night there.

That night while getting drunk, we were ambushed by some invisible force.

One by one we were taken out until I was the only one left.

I lay there while pretending to be dead.

I was on the ground for about 2 hours before I found the courage to get up.

As I got up though, I spotted what looked like a man (except it wasn't human) leaning over my squad leader.

I gasped as I realized that the thing was slicing the skin off my dead squad leader's face.

I quickly got up and was about to run when the thing grabbed me by my arm.

Although the thing was strong, I somehow managed to get away.

As I was running away, I turned back, and what I saw shocked me to my core.

Instead of its face, it was wearing the skin of my squad leader.

Anyway, I kept running until I nearly stumbled over the bodies of the missing platoon lying in a huge pit.

Soon after discovering the bodies of the missing platoon, I blacked out.

When I came too, I was in a helicopter.

Afterward, I was discharged from the army.

When I arrived back home, I suffered from PTSD and began to see that thing everywhere.

At first, I thought It was my PTSD but I knew the thing was real.

Oh, I also took something from it too.

A knife.

2 days after my uncle's confession, he succumbed to his cancer.

I was tasked to clean up his house to sell it.

As I was going through his stuff, I found a knife.

Ever since finding the knife, I've been seeing the same thing my uncle saw in Vietnam and I think, It wants its knife back and will do anything to get it back...

Even going as far as killing me.

So please, I need your help before it's too late...
