I didn’t get much sleep that night.

The thing that looked like me kept coming back to my bedroom window, scratching at the glass with this patient, methodical rhythm—tap… scrape… tap…—as if it had all the time in the world. Every sound felt deliberate. Testing me. Listening for my reaction. Once or twice I could swear I saw the faint outline of its ear pressed to the pane, like it was trying to hear me breathe.

Eventually, I abandoned my bed and curled up on the couch instead. Vivienne stayed near the window, watching in this unnervingly calm way, ready to stop it if it tried anything else. She didn’t say she was protecting me. She didn’t need to. I could feel the tension radiating off her like static.

I kept blinking at the ceiling, counting scratches until they blurred together. At some point, the world went from night-black to that pale early-morning color—blue, then gray, then something almost normal. The scratching stopped. Its presence slipped away like a held breath finally released.

But it didn’t feel gone. Not really. More like it had stepped back into the tree line to watch.

That thing wasn’t obsessed with me in a flattering way. I felt hunted.

“You’re going to need to go to work and act normal,” Vivienne said softly. She didn’t sound tired, even though she hadn’t slept either. “If people start worrying about you… It could get messy.”

Her voice was gentle, but her expression stayed unreadable. Too composed, too controlled. But her tone—there was something protective in it. Even after she’d threatened me not to say a word to anyone.

“That makes sense,” I muttered, rubbing my eyes. My whole body felt off—heavy legs, jittery hands, that wired exhaustion you only get from a night full of adrenaline. “But what if it hears my voice again? You said it only needed to hear me one more time.”

Vivienne hesitated—really hesitated. “I’m handling that part. Just… trust me for today.”

I gave a small, shaky laugh. I tried to take it as reassurance. I wasn’t sure it was.

My morning routine felt like moving underwater. Brush teeth. Comb hair. Try not to stare too hard at my reflection, in case something looks back at me wrong. I put on my usual big on-air grin, even though my stomach kept tightening every time I remembered claws dragging across glass.

By the time I left the house, I had the routine pasted onto me like armor.

I slipped into my car. The seat felt colder than usual—like no one had sat in it for days. I started the engine and turned on my upbeat playlist, forcing myself to hum along. If I stopped humming, I was afraid I’d start listening for scratching again.

When I pulled into the station, Kim and Marty were arriving at the same time. I kicked myself into gear, jogging over with my usual enthusiasm and throwing an arm around each of their shoulders.

“Hey, guys! I hope you’re both ready to put on a great show today!”

Kim snorted. “One day, Bradley, you’re going to walk in here tired or grumpy, and I’m going to check your pulse.”

“Seriously,” Marty added. “Not a single bad mood in three years? I’m starting to think you’re a robot.”

I forced a laugh. “If I were a robot, I’d have more energy right now.”

Kim frowned. “You good? You look a little pale.”

“Just didn’t sleep great,” I said quickly. “Neighbors were loud.”

Kim opened her mouth like she wanted to ask more, but Marty clapped her on the back.

“Let the man suffer in peace. Come on.”

I kept smiling so hard my cheeks hurt.

Inside the studio, Kim immediately crouched by the soundboard, muttering to herself as she checked the levels.

“These inputs are all over the place again,” she groaned. “Did someone kick the mixer last night?”

Marty laughed. “If they did, it was justified. That thing has a personal vendetta against us.”

“Maybe it needs therapy,” I joked weakly.

Kim pointed at me without looking up. “Don’t tempt me. I will schedule a counseling session for this mixer.”

It helped. For a second, I felt almost normal.

I grabbed today’s script and skimmed through it.

Weather updates. Local cases. Community spotlight.

Totally normal. Wonderfully, blissfully normal.

Kim leaned over my shoulder. “You’ve got the charity segment today. You’re usually good at that stuff. People love your ‘local hero’ voice.”

“My what?”

“You know—soft tone, slight head tilt, eyes that say ‘I care deeply about your casserole fundraiser.’”

I laughed for real that time. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”

“Sure you don’t,” she said, smirking.

Marty walked past us with a coffee cup the size of a small bucket. “Five bucks says he does the head tilt before the first commercial break.”

“Ten,” Kim shot back.

Their normal, easy banter wrapped around me like a blanket. I clung to it without letting them know how badly I needed it.

I stepped onto the set, cleared my throat, smoothed my tie, and let my on-air smile take over as the red tally light blinked on.

“Looks like today we’re gonna have a very sunny morning! Temperatures are gonna be a little higher, so make sure to drink plenty of water and have fun!”

As I spoke, the familiar rhythm settled over me. My voice. My pacing. The camera’s unblinking eye. Something inside me loosened, like I could finally breathe for the first time since last night.

Behind the camera, I saw Kim watching me with an amused smirk. She tapped her own head and mouthed, “The tilt!” Marty silently handed her ten dollars.

I almost smiled.

Then I heard it.

A faint sound above me. Soft. Familiar.

Scratch.

I froze mid-sentence. Kim’s brow furrowed; she glanced upward, then back at me, mouthing, “Is that feedback?”

Marty tapped the boom mic, frowning. “Something’s buzzing in the ceiling…”

They heard something. Not clearly. Not enough to understand.

Another whisper of nails dragging across metal.

Then—my name. Barely audible.

My stomach dropped.

Slowly, against every instinct screaming at me not to, I lifted my eyes toward the rafters. The studio lights washed everything in white, the edges blurring—but even then, I saw it.

It clung to the beams like a spider, its limbs bent wrong, too long, too loose. And its face—

Its face was mine.

My hair. My eyes. My forced, camera-ready smile. Except wrong. Timed a second off from my own expression, like an echo wearing skin.

Its mouth moved.

My exact voice whispered my name again.

Kim’s eyes widened. “Is someone up there?” she whispered.

Marty squinted into the lights. “I—I can’t see… is that a person?”

I tried to keep reading from the script, pretending everything was normal while my eyes darted between the teleprompter and the thing above me. It had begun inching closer, limbs folding and unfolding with deliberate hunger.

Then—

A blur behind it.

Vivienne.

She drove a knife into its back in one clean, practiced motion. The creature let out a chattering hiss—sharp and insectlike. It lashed back at her, claws scraping metal.

Kim shrieked. Marty stumbled into a light stand. Someone cut the feed—probably thinking equipment was falling or someone had gotten hurt up there.

I forced out, “I—uh—need to take a quick break! Be right back!” with the most cheerful anchor voice I could manage.

Then I bolted for the ladder.

At the top, the creature twisted its body around the knife, lunging at Vivienne. She barely dodged the next strike.

Something in me snapped.

I tackled it, and we slammed onto the metal grating.

It smiled—my smile—wide and hungry.

Then it tore into me.

Claws raked across my shoulders. Another stabbed into my ribs, sharp enough that the pain exploded white behind my eyes. I gasped, trying to shove it off, but it was stronger. Everything blurred, muffled. My heartbeat thudded slower and slower.

The thing lowered its face toward mine and whispered my name—

—and then everything went black.

When I finally clawed my way back to consciousness, Vivienne was steadying me. Behind her, the thing’s body lay twisted on the catwalk, its head a short distance away—still, unmoving.

I winced, pressing a hand to my side. Warm blood seeped through my fingers.

“Well… I’m assuming it won’t be messing with me—or anyone—anymore, right? Please tell me it can’t… come back.”

Vivienne didn’t smile. “No. Whatever that was… It’s done.” She hesitated. “But things like that don’t usually show up at random.”

That made my skin crawl.

Then she pressed the knife into my hand.

“Keep it,” she said quietly. “Please.”

My blood dripped onto the floor beneath us.

I didn’t know what was waiting for me after this.

But I knew I wasn’t going back to normal.
