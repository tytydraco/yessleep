He watches from hidden hovels. When looking in the right place, I think anyone can see him — anywhere, any time. But you wouldn’t want to find him.

Still, if you do, then you would do well to get on your knees and pray — pray to any holy thing that might exist in this world of nightmares.

Or find a way to save yourself, as I have.

I’m sorry.

In the early hours of the morning, I was watching my favourite film. Shaun of the Dead. A comedic masterpiece that I’ve seen roughly 40 times in my life. I know every last line of dialogue. Every scene. Every character, minor and major.

But I didn’t recognise *him*.

The man in the back of the pub. And then again at the end of the film. In the shadows by the side of the house. A man of average build — a little under six-foot tall. Dressed in a suit of a muted grey-green material. It looked as if he had fashioned the clothes out of something unorthodox. Something familiar.

The man unnerved me in a way I didn’t yet understand. The only thing that set him apart from any ordinary man, bar his unusual attire, was his eyes. Oval-shaped, but positioned vertically, not horizontally, on his face. I felt a deep, dire dread. Something terrible was coming. I knew it.

Redditors confirmed that there was no such man in any version of Shaun of the Dead — not in any director’s cut or bonus material. I could’ve chalked it up to an inexplicable fan edit, but it was my DVD — yes, I know that’s old-school. But it’s a disc I’ve used, as I say, about 40 times. The man never used to be there.

And then I received a strange piece of advice from one particular commenter.

*He spares you and chooses another victim if their suit matches your first. You’ll know what that means.*

I thought about that oddly unsettling comment as I got ready for bed. The man’s suit. Why was it so familiar? It seemed to be fabricated from some unusual material, but that wasn’t it. That wasn’t why it unsettled me. Why did I recognise it?

The curtains. The bedroom curtains.

Grey-green drapes. As I stared at the material, identical to the fabric of the shadowy man’s suit, a coldness spread across my skin, tightening it to my skeleton like a shrunken glove.

Then the true horror of my situation struck. I saw something. For a fleeting moment, between the two curtains, I saw him.

The man.

His grey-green suit blended into the drapes. He was one with the fabric. Too frozen to move — too petrified to think — I found myself staring into those lopsided eyes. Two narrow, lifeless slits observing me from the darkness. I felt a terror beyond anything primal.

After all, we’re not meant to see such things. I fully believe that. I was never meant to find him in that film or between my curtains.

When my limbs finally came unstuck, I turned from the horrifying man in the curtains and ran for my life. I hopped into my car at 3am and drove far from my house. But nowhere, it seemed, was far enough.

Standing beside a bus stop at the edge of town was the man again. But he wore a suit of a different fabric. Leather. Black, striped leather. My car seat.

And before that thought had even fully formulated in my head, my eyes drifted to the rearview mirror.

I screamed.

In the back was the man with vertical oval eyes and clothes that melded into the very seat on which he sat. Mouth hanging agape in unfathomable horror, I found myself suddenly choking.

One hand shakily on the wheel, as the car started to swerve in the road, I used my spare hand to reach into my throat. I can’t quite explain the vomit-inducing, horrifying hell of producing an endless strand of leather — yes, *strand* — from the back of my throat. My eyes watered, and the car swerved into a tree.

I woke to find myself in a hospital bed. The doctors informed me that they saw no sign of a long leather strand in my throat. They said I had a concussion and was probably misremembering the events leading up to the crash.

But I knew what I’d seen. Just as plainly as I knew what was happening when I saw, for a brief, haunting moment, a flicker of a shape between two of the doctors. The lurking man in a suit made of the same fabric as a hospital gown.

I shrieked for help, but no sound escaped my lips. I soundlessly stared at the hospital staff as they left the room — eyes watering as I internally screeched for them to save me.

Lying in that darkened space, I slowly looked down at the hospital gown on my body, and the most terrifying thing happened. It started to squeeze. Squeeze until my compressed lungs felt unable to fill with air.

I pulled myself upright and silently, again, screamed at the sight in the mirror opposite the bed. My eyes were vertical oval slits. They weren’t my eyes at all. I was gazing into the suited man’s face.

I started to claw at the hospital gown, tearing it from my body and toppling onto the floor in a naked, shivering heap. As I crawled away from the pieces of my tattered clothes on the floor, I saw something so ghastly that my heart is still racing, an hour later.

The man’s seemingly-dismembered head lay beneath the ruined gown, surveying me from a shadowed recess. Below his topsy-turvy eyes, he did not smile. Did not frown. Did not express anything. His neutral lips, as rigidly straight as his vertical eyes, were simply there.

I did not and still *do* not know what the man wants from me, but I grabbed my phone and fled the room, barely cognisant of the fact that I was fully nude.

I locked myself in a cupboard and jotted down my story. This terrible story. But why? Why would I tell you about this terrible, terrifying man?

Well, I pray one of you has a matching suit.
