I didn’t think I’d be posting here [again](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ha9fh8/this_town_is_starting_to_scare_me_please_tell_me/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). If I’m being honest, you guys weren’t that helpful the last time, but I don’t know where else to go with this. I can’t just keep this shit to myself or else I’ll go insane thinking about it. If you don’t know or remember, I posted here the other week about this creepy town I just moved to: speakers, no people, etc. Before any of you ask, the town is still weird, The speakers and bodiless people are still rampant, but that’s why God made curtains, shitty white noise machines, and television. Those three paired with long 8-hour shifts usually result in some form of sleep. It’s enough to get me through more shifts and get bigger checks. I thought I had adapted pretty well until earlier this week. 

I was doing a deep clean of the apartment. (I had a rough week and let the place go to total shit.) I had wrapped it up with a final trip to the dumpster and made my way back into the building. When I walked in, there was a figure standing at the top of the steps.

He was this short, white guy in his mid-30s. He lived in the apartment right next to me with his wife. The wife and I had interacted on occasion, that being just smiling or nodding as we passed each other in the hallway, but he and I had only exchanged glances. They were an okay couple, I think. They kept to themselves and didn’t make too much noise, although they had gotten louder, lately. They fucked a little too loud, sometimes, too, but they were nice enough. He was just standing on the top step with a cup in his hand, looking down at me. I groaned internally and kept my eyes straight forward, hoping to look lost in thought or angry or tired. I forget that it doesn't work on southern people. 

“E-Excuse me, you live next door, right?”

I stopped and looked at him, begrudgingly. My actual worst nightmare. 

“. . . Yeah.”

His eyes lit up. A brutal smile spread across his face. 

“Yeah? I’ve been meaning to talk to you!”

He stuck his free hand out, and I reluctantly took it. He gripped me tight and shook my hand vigorously, his drink threatening to spill. His hand looked messy, various stains peppered across it. I could smell him now, too. He smelled sour and hot and ripe. I had to fight every muscle in my face to not react. 

“Couldn’t help but notice you haven’t really met any of us, yet. I-I don’t know if you can tell, but I’m more of an extroverted guy, haha. And my wife is out of town for the weekend- she’s with her mother and her sister up north- and so I’m just here tryin’ to keep myself entertained.”

He gestured with his cup, which I could now smell was some shitty beer. I noticed he was holding a joint between his index and middle finger. I let out a forced chuckle and feigned empathy.

“Yeah, well, I noticed that no one in this town really talks to each other, you know? They’re all quiet and keep to themselves, which if you can believe doesn’t suit me well. I usually just talk to my wife, you know, but I been meanin’ to meet the neighbors and get to know y’all and whatnot. But, you know, the neighbors in this place, they’re a little *weird*.”

He gestured to the other doors and finished his sentence in a whisper, like he was concerned somebody else would hear him. He laughed at his jokes violently and quickly. He talked as if he couldn’t get the words out of his mouth quick enough. I couldn’t tell if it was excitement or some kind of panic that was pushing them out. Was he drunk? No, this is too much to be drunk. He was smiling so wide that I thought his dry lips would crack at the edges if he kept it up. His eyes were fixed on mine, forcing me to look into them the entire time. 

“But I hadn’t met you yet, you know? So I thought I’d take advantage ‘n say hello and see what’s up and stuff. Oh! Do-Do you smoke?”

He once again gestured with the joint in his hand. I mumbled that I do it every once in a while. I was just trying my best to be polite while providing as little information as I could. 

“Ugh, perfect! You see, I can’t usually smoke in the apartment- my wife doesn’t like the smell- so I was thinkin’ if we got along, you know, we could be, like smokin’ buddies! Cause I haven’t gotten to make any friends around here, and like I said, I’m an extroverted guy and need someone to talk to, haha. B-But hey, what time do you usually get off of work? . . . I only ask because I just wanna get an idea of how much time I’d have to give ya so you can, you know, get cleaned up or relax a bit or do whatever you need to do before we could hang out. And I’m down for whatever, so we could hang out at mine, or I could come over to yours.”

It wasn’t an invitation. No, it was too frantic. His voice tensed as he said it, causing his body to vibrate slightly. He was demanding that I invite him. It sent a wave of dread so intense that it made the LEDs of the hallway feel brighter. The lights reduced his pupils to where they were just sharp pins, holding me in place like some dead insect. He was studying me, anxiously waiting for my response. I shook as deja vu washed over me. I told him that I’d have to see what all I have left to do today, and it depends how much I have to work this week. He nodded his head in a “go on” kind of manner. I told him that I’d let him know whenever I could. 

His smile dropped for a second, just long enough to see something that looked like irritation or anger. It sent my heart into a frenzy, screaming to escape. A half smile returned, but the anger stayed in his eyes.

“Yeah, yeah, I completely understand, hehe. Yeah, you just let me know whenever you get the chance and we’ll figure something out.” 

He held out his free hand again. I took it and suffered through another handshake. When he finally released me, I gave him a nod and slowly made my way back to my apartment. I was wracked with fear. I struggled to walk back down the hallway, desperately trying to relax my body and breathing. I felt my hands twitch as I forced them to stay at my sides, and I had to hold myself back from walking too fast. When I finally placed my hand on the doorknob, I could see my hand trembling. It was only when I had made it back inside that I heard him walk back into his own place. I sat on my couch and stared at my black TV screen, replaying the interaction over and over.

A few hours later, there was a soft knock on my door. The noise yanked me out of my trance, and I stumbled to pull out my phone. I searched through my apps frantically and opened the one connected to my door camera. I had it installed after the last post out of concern that the property manager would come by unannounced. When it finally loaded, I was greeted by the familiar sight of the door across from mine. No one was there. I held the phone closer to my face, trying to find any sign of life on the feed. A firmer knock suddenly came from the door, causing my phone to fumble out of my hands as I jumped. I swore under my breath as the phone clattered on the ground, announcing my position. I kept still, hoping he didn’t hear it and would go away. A loud and final knock rang from the door, this one more insistent than the other two. I forced myself up from the couch and back to the door, fearing the worst. 

When I cracked the door open, the first thing I saw was his face. His eyes were still wide and searching, another hideous grin consumed his face. His head was at an angle this time, though. It was tilted. I glanced down at his body and realized that he was leaning. He was leaning over the fucking camera. 

“Heyyy!”

He drew out the word, using it as a moment to explore. I could see his eyes flick behind me into my apartment, hoping to gather some kind of data. I kept the door at a crack and greeted him.

“Yeah, man! I’m so excited! You know, you really are the best!”

His body moved, and I suddenly felt a pushing against my hand. He was trying to come inside. Instinctively, I pushed against him, keeping him in place. He looked back down at me, confused. 

“Yeah, I thought about it,” I said, trying to think of a rational excuse,  “Listen, I’ve just been cleaning all day, and I’ve got a long day at work tomorrow. I’m really sorry, I just can’t today.”

His whole body was facing me now, staring me down. The smile had dropped so fast, frustration taking its place. I could see his breathing grow more intense. The frustration slowly morphed into a scowl. Why was he already so angry? I kept trying to fill the silence with small apologies and excuses. 

“Don’t worry, it’s fine. I understand. We’ll get together, eventually.” 

He turned around. He gave me a quick, forced wave goodbye as he started back down the hall. I closed my door, relieved to be free of him again. Suddenly, a loud BANG came from the end of the hallway. I knew it was his door. I could hear exactly where it came from. This man had slammed his door because I wouldn’t let him into my apartment. Shaking with anxiety and rage, I returned to my couch and tried to calm myself down.

There was something wrong. I knew it. I could still hear him making noise in his apartment. Loud bangs and muttering kept coming from the wall that connected our apartments. Sadly, that wall is in my bedroom. I waited for him to tire himself out, but it just didn’t stop. So I was stuck trying to drown out the speakers outside with nothing but a television and a white noise machine. The only option I had was to put in my earbuds and hope that rain sounds will do the trick. 



I had fallen asleep on the couch. I can’t remember if it was a noise or a feeling, but my eyes just suddenly shot open. I was freezing cold and my heart felt like it was clawing at my chest. My sudden awakening put me in a daze, and it felt like minutes before I could recognize the feeling as fear. Pure and utter fear. My limbs were shaking so hard that I couldn’t sit up or look around. I could only move my eyes. 

The living room was covered in thick, smothering darkness. My vision refused to adjust. The only thing that I could identify was a familiar big chunk of light that split the wall across from me. That damn clock. My relief was short-lasted, though, and my breath left my body faster than I’d gotten it. 

There was a figure in the light. 

He was slightly squatting, his hands and knees pressed against the glass. I could see his shoulders moving up and down with his breathing, and he was breathing hard. It looked like he was practically heaving. I slowly tore my eyes away from the shadow to try and look at him. I still couldn’t move my head. The bottoms of my eyes were pulsing from straining to look at him. It felt like my eyes were going to burst, but I could finally see him. 

He wasn’t just heaving. He was shaking. Vibrating. He fogged up the glass more and more with each breath he took, building droplets on the glass. When the fog cleared, I saw that he was smiling. That wet, ravenous smile he gave me in the hallway. His eyes were so wide that I thought they were going to shoot through the glass. His pupils were so wide that I didn’t realize he was looking right at me. I was screaming before I realized I was breathing again, my back suddenly pressed against the wall. My scream must have shocked him because the last thing I saw of him was his head as he fell away from the window. His smile and gaze never broke. It felt like minutes before I heard the softest “thud” from the window. No other sound followed. I stayed pinned against that wall until sunrise. My eyes never left the window, never dared to look away from his handprints. It took the morning sun shining right in my eyes to shake me from it. 

I called the sheriff’s office and pleaded for someone to come check on my neighbor. I couldn’t bring myself to recap the night’s events, but I cried about how I thought he was hurt. An officer eventually showed up. I managed to put together a story about how I thought my neighbor was hurt because I heard really strange noises from next door and outside the window. I begged the man to investigate, and he finally obliged. 

He was gone. Just gone. There was no evidence of a body outside the building. No blood, no stain, nothing. Just naked asphalt. His apartment looked practically abandoned, only a few pieces of furniture and trash indicated that someone lived here. I kept trying to tell the officer that something was wrong, but he had grown too annoyed about this wasted call. When I calmed down, he just chalked the whole thing up to a night terror and sleepwalking, as well as an infuriating tale about his own niece with similar issues. I was left in my apartment with nothing but the fading handprints on my window to remind me of what really happened. It makes no sense. I *saw* him fall. I *heard* him hit the ground. He didn't make a sound after he fell. He had to have died there, but there was nothing.

It’s been days since this happened. I never got any updates from the officer. I’ve scoured the internet every day for an obituary or an article. Nothing. Not even a mourning relative. His wife never came back to the building. The other neighbors never talked to me about them. I’ve tried to go to the sheriff, but they won’t tell me anything. A majority of them can’t seem to figure out who I’m even talking about, but I know something happened to them. People just don’t fucking vanish like that. They don’t. Not without something else being involved. 

I started writing all of this with the intention of asking for help in finding something about them. *Anything* about them. I haven’t been able to sleep or eat or work without knowing what became of them. But as I am writing this, I’ve realized something. Something that I can’t tell confuses me or gives me an actual answer. 

I can’t remember his name anymore.
