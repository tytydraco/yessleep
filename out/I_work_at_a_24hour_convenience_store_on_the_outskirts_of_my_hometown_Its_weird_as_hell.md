I'm not really sure how to start this so let's just go with the basics. This is my first post, mainly due to the fact that I haven't had anything to post until now but also because I've only had a phone and just recently got this secondhand laptop. It works well but for some reason the "3" and "+" keys are missing, either someone got bored or they really didn't like math. 

Like the title states I work at a 24-hour convenience store on the outskirts of my hometown that sells the usual things like snacks and drinks, but what makes it a 24-hour store is the fact that the owner doesn’t wanna pay for a nighttime security guard so just decided to keep the store open for any backpackers or people on road trips who needed a snack or needed to ask for directions.

Some of you might be wondering why I work at some crappy store so far out of town, well I'll give the shortest answer I can. The owner desperately needed a full-time employee so she put out an ad that said the job would pay $22.25 per hour for night shifts that start at 7 pm and end at 6 am, which is like $244.75 PER SHIFT and I need to pay my rent.

However, that's not the weird part, as you all probably suspected. The weird part is the store itself, it's hard to explain so I'll just tell you guys of some common things that happen. Hopefully, that'll explain even a tiny bit of the madness that happens, and to keep this post short.

We sell coffee from a coffee machine that never needs repairs, that sounds good right? Well not once you realise that it's never cleaned, never refilled and never had a maintenance check up. The only reason I can think of an explanation for this is that the stoner looking due that comes in on a Wednesday at 5:55 pm every week. He's always carrying around a toolbox, wears a fisherman’s bucket hat as well as a pair of sunglasses that looks like he borrowed them from berry bee Benson, that bee from the *fucking* bee movie. All he does when he comes in is he pulls out a tool that looks like a wrench and a spanger combined, hits the coffee machine with it five times and then leaves.

Another thing is that Mantis teenager, that I have yet to figure out if they're a boy, girl or something else. They speak, act and even dress like a teen would. The only thing different is that they're head is one of a pray mantis, and if I don't give it alcohol it tries to bite me. Don't ask.

Now you may be thinking "Wow this is all weird and all but not creepy" and your right. So allow me to ruin that by telling you what really scares me. The fresh produce section. I know, its weird to have one in a convince store but its what the owner decided so who am I to stop them? I say them as I've never met the owner in person.

1. Now the fresh produce section is weird so let's just cut to the chase with why is freaks me the hell out.
2. Popular fruits like apples, bananas, oranges and pears go off extremely quick. Once they're off they start to leak a black- brown- navy blue colour??? (Idk I can never tell)
3. On the 21st day of every month, a man with a brown ascot cap comes in with a crate you'd use to take your cat to the vet, puts it on the floor, and one by one multi coloured rats come out of it, each one looking like they have some sort of disease and they run around the store bitting anyone who is standing on the ground, except for the man. This lasts for up to an **hour** and then they all go back into the crate, the man locks it and tips his hat to the cashier before walking out the store. This happens *every. Single.*  ***Month.*** 
4. Crows fly themselves into the window right behind the fresh produce section.
5. And finally, the bags of random meat that will appear next to the grapes.

  
Anyways I'll end it here. If I think of anything else that's happened or is anything *does* happen I'll update. Thanks for reading this shitshow of a post.
