In 2009 I was made homeless in Alaska. I had to drop out of college and spent 6 months, thankfully in the summer, finding a place to live while I try to rebuild my life. I settled into working 2 hourly jobs totaling a 60 hour work week with 0 days off since my week was scheduled to look like 12/12/12/8/8/4/4. I had zero free time but I was in the best shape of my life and saving 3-4k per month from having no life outside of work. In 2010 I chose to get my passport and fulfil a lifelong dream of my, a vacation in Japan. In 2011 I turned 22, quit my jobs and come the month of June I was on a plane inbound for Haneda Airport in Tokyo. Feet on the ground and into the city I bought a Motorola Razor as a domestic burner since I would be spending the next 2 months being a tourist in the northern part of the country.

My first 2 weeks were in Sapporo, the timing was intentional because that's when the Beerfest takes place. The whole of Odori park becomes an outdoor beer garden and I spent a few nights there just socializing and trying drinks that you can't get anywhere else. I had no idea this would be the catalyst for the worst mistake of my trip. I would talk to other patrons of the Beerfest and tell them of my travel plans, some of the local guys I was quite friendly with said they knew some friends in my next stop, so they phoned ahead and set up a meeting. That next stop; Hakodate. Historical sight seeing with Fort Goryokaku, Hatsumae castle and the best seafood in the entire world. That's were the next contact was, completely different nightlife than with Sapporo the guys I met took me to some hole in the wall Izakayas and at least 2 cabaret clubs. Those working girls will take a strong interest in foreigners and you'll blow money like you're a rapper if you're not careful.

The lads in Hakodate set up my next meet  2 weeks later in Aomori, more historical sights, Lake Towada and lots of Apples and Whisky. Same deal as before, Aomori friends knew some people in my last stop, Akita, and set up a meet. It was the 8th day of my last 14 in Japan and I was at another local Izakaya with a group of flash friends I'd been introduced to when the guy who changed the end of my vacation showed up. He was a pudgy guy who looked like he was in his late 20s, rounder than most and might have been upwards of 240lbs. Overweight Japanese are a rarity and I assumed it was because of his weight that he introduced himself as "Buta" which is the word for pig. The night carried on with small talk and guy banter when Buta asked how much longer I'm in the country, I told him and he asked what my plans were until I leave. I told him I'd planned to spend 2 or 3 days exploring Oga, Ogakokutei park, Akagami shrine, the Namahage museum and aquarium. One of the ways I was able to make friends so quickly in Japan is because I spent time reading history of the local areas I'd been and could talk about it on a level that drew in the locals, often them adding their own tidbits to what I'd read before. This time was no different but what Buta said grabbed everyone's attention. "When you go to Akagami, if you see a sign that reads Zujoshiu, turn around and leave immediately." 

The other guys began chiding Buta for this, saying it's a myth or some story made up to keep people from wandering off the park paths but Buta was insistent that he'd seen it and even brought back pictures. They were on his phone and it was the same kind of Motorola I'd bought as a burner so they weren't the best quality and looked like dilapidated buildings but as he showed me the photos the other guys continued to tell him it's all a fiction made to keep the locals out of the woods. The thing about Japanese is that the language is strongly contextual, I had not heard "Zujoshiu" before this point and since I had no kanji to read, I didn't have any other option but to ask the obvious question; "What's Zujoshiu?"

Guys groaned as Buta sat back at the table and explained; "Back towards the end of Joumon there was a village in the woods near where Akagami shrine sits, near the Sanno falls. In those days the the Namahage ruled Oga like migrating bandits, villagers would dig beneath their homes for a place to hide food, valuables and themselves when the Namahage would be near so that when they show up to raid the village they'd only find a bunch of empty houses. At best, they'd destroy the buildings but they'd move on quickly since there's nothing to take. It was during one of these raids when an infant in the arms of it's new mother began to cry. The Namahage heard the crying and found the hidden. They brought all the villagers above ground and the Namahage leader made clear that ever time they passed through the village, they'd have to give up half of their food and 3 lives or the village would be burned down and everyone killed. The Namahage then killed the infant, the mother and her husband as an example and left with half the village's food. The next morning the village elders came together to try and think of a way out. They didn't have enough food left to make the journey out somewhere else. And wince the Namahage came through 1 a season the village would be losing food and people at an alarming rate. The one of the elders said he had a plan; they'd make a deal with an akuma for protection." He placed emphasis the word 'akuma'. 

"They used the bodies of the recently dead and took them deep into a cave near the village. There's no tale of what ritual they performed but when the elder's immerged from the cave they announced that a deal had been made and now a shrine must be built. They spent the whole season building the shrine at the mouth of the cave and painted the buildings with the blood of animals they'd kept for food. The season changed and eventually the Namahage came back, the villagers had hidden themselves like before but this time they'd done so in the cave so when the Namahage found the houses empty again the leader shouted how he was going to burn the village and eat everyone. The village elder who's idea it was to make a deal with the akuma was the only one to not hide, instead he stayed at the shrine until he heard the Namahage, then walked down towards them in the village. The villagers heard laughter and vile mockery to the elder but that was soon replaced with the sound of screaming and wood splintering. The noise lasted for a few minutes until the elder approached the shrine again and spoke to the hiding villagers 'The Namahage will trouble us no more.' 

When the villagers descended from the shrine and returned to the village they found the homes half destroyed and pieces of Namahage everywhere. The elder instructed the men to collect the Namahage and throw their meat into the cave as far back as they can manage. Everyone was delighted to see that the plan worked but knew nothing of what the elder had done to condemn them. A new problem arose as the village didn't have enough food to last until the next season so the elder suggested that some of the men take provisions and scour Oga to see if any other villages existed that could take their own in for survival. And not 3 days later them men returned with word of what's now Ogata, they'd built a wall that cut off Oga from the rest of Honshu which is why the same Namahage showed up so frequently, they were trapped. The village elder sent the majority of what food was left with the villagers and sent them east to this wall that they might find refuge, but the elder's family chose to stay. His wife, his 2 sons and their wives and 5 children. The other villagers did find sanctuary on the other side of the wall and when the men who lead them explained what had happened in their village the elders of Oga sent the men back to retrieve the elder and his family. It had been over a week since they'd left Zujoshiu and expected to find the elder and his family working what fields they could but upon seeing the village it was eerily silent. There were no sounds of birds or bugs or people at work. Upon checking the elder's home he found the man asleep in his bed, be he wasn't asleep, he was dead. He had large bruises around his neck like he'd been strangled and no sign of his family was anywhere.

They traveled up to the shrine but it too was deserted, but then they felt an ominous sound coming from the cave. It shook the earth and them from their feet. They fled and returned to Oga to tell their discovery. The elders of Oga were questioned and most remained silent, but one did speak. The ritual had called something they could only describe as akuma, he made no effort to say what it looked like. But he said it spoke with malice unlike even the Namahage could. It demanded payment and a vessel. The elder who summoned it bargained that it would get the vessel first and payment after. The akuma agreed and instructed how the vessel is to be made. First they took the right forearm of the dead mother and separated it from the rest, then washed it in what fluid they could squeeze from the corpses of the husband and infant, the elder was then instructed to consume the remains of the infant and make a pledge to fulfill the deal, which he did. Then the shrine was built and the arm was placed within it to bind the akuma to the land. But the elder had a trick up his sleeve, after the akuma had destroyed the Namahage, he returned to the shrine and used blessed nails to pin the arm to a plank of Hinoki washed with sake, then wrapped it in the clothes the mother was wearing. The elder said this was to limit the power of the akuma and it would not like what comes next. When asked what the payment the akuma demanded was the surviving elder said 20 lives of the akuma's choosing.

The people of Oga who learned of this believed that the elder and his family counted as 8 of the 20 as promised but the fact that the elder had sent everyone he could away first had upset the akuma. It had taken his family but not him. Akagami shrine was built to hide Zujoshiu from the world and prevent the akuma from taking anyone else or being set loose." One of the other guys chimed in "You love to tell this story to any foreigner who'll listen but it doesn't exist. You're the only one here who's ever seen it and those photos could be from anywhere." Buta fired back "Because the akuma chooses who gets to see it. You think the number stayed at 8? Plenty of people have traveled to Akagami and it wouldn't surprise me if more than a few had gone missing in the nearly 2000 years since it happened." Watching the back and forth between Buta and the guys I spoke up "Dude, that's a great story. Tell me now if you're bullshitting me." Buta looked me straight in the eyes, leaned over the table and said in English "I no bullshitting, that place is cursed".

That night I could barely sleep, this kind of folklore is my jam and I was itching to see how much truth their was to it. All folklore has an it's origins in a true story so there has to be **something** to this one right? Waking up about noon and slightly hungover I set out for Akagami shrine, fully expecting Buta to have been bullshitting me but hoping he wasn't. Well I went out there and didn't find anything. I mean I did, I found some stunning scenery but no Zujoshiu. So I continued my sightseeing and visited the Shinzan shrine after the Namahage museum, and that's when I found it. An overgrown path barely visible through the surrounding woodlands. So of course as a headstrong 22 year old who doesn't believe in monsters and curses I'm going to do a bit of exploring. It felt like I was walking for an hour when I noticed the sound of the forest was gone. It was the first half of August, there should have been Cicada and bird songs but it was just silent. Like an apex predator was somewhere nearby and the whole of nature was trying to go unnoticed. So I did what I thought I should do and turned around to leave, but I didn't leave. After another hour hiking in silence the woods opened up to what looked like the remains of wooden houses, old houses, the kind that were built with thatch and without nails. None of them were standing and if it wasn't for the bizarrely clear area where all this was I would have thought it was just a part of the forest but it was too symmetrical and organized to be anything nature would make. I took cautious steps through the ruins and thought to myself *Did Buta lie and say it was near Akagami to intentionally mislead me?* Then I felt it. A shaking beneath my feet, like someone had turned a subwoofer all the way up and pointed it face down into the dirt. It came in waves of 3 seconds but it was unnaturally consistent.

Towards the back of the ruins I saw a stone staircase, it was little more than rough cut stone, some with jagged edges jutting out from the hill but it looked like a deliberate staircase of no more than 30 steps. Looking up I didn't see a Torii so I assumed it was just more ruined village. I climbed the stairs and found I was wrong, it **was** a shrine. It wasn't fancy, it wasn't big, but it was a shrine. One stone lantern stood covered moss and vines as it had been left to nature and the other had been partially destroyed at some point but looked just as green. And between them was what looked to be the main building of the shrine. It stood no taller than 5 feet and was maybe about just as wide at the base, more finely cut cobblestones in a slope like a castle foundation and sat upon it was a wooden structure that looked every bit like any other Shinto shrine I'd seen, save for that it didn't have a bell and tassel or donation box for praying. It had a set of double doors on it's face that look damn near rotted off. I was so fixated on the shrine that I'd completely forgotten about the shaking my feet had felt. But the rustling of what nearby flora dared to grow in this place brought me back to my senses as I'd finally noticed the large cave sat right behind the shrine not even 10 feet away. The mouth of the cave was almost twice as wide as the shrine and had a Shimenawa across it that looked as frayed and rotten as the shrine was. Again I thought to myself that the story Buta told me must have been mostly bullshit, no way any of it was real. But my dumbass had to tempt fate. I opened the shine doors, causing one of them to fall off, and found a bundle wrapped in a dirty cloth, it looked like it could have been an obi but Buta said the story happened in Joumon which would have been long before the Yukata was a thing. I took out the bundle saw it had a peculiar shape, a rectangle 2 foot long by 1 foot wide with a bulge on one side. I unwrapped the bundle and saw it was an arm nailed to a wooden plank. I immediately knew I fucked up.

The arm was pale, almost translucent with blackened and cracked fingernails, the only parts that looked rotten were where the nails were driven through; the palm, under the wrist and further down where the elbow would have been. I didn't completely unwrap it, but I did feel around for the nail, didn't make any sense for a piece of a human body that's over 1700 years old to not only not be rotten but still feel relatively fleshy. Once again shaken back to my senses as a gust of putrid air blew out from the cave. The smell was worse than that of a landfill mixed with rotting chicken and jock itch. I dropped the arm as I wretched, puking what little fluid I'd had in me. I pulled a water bottle from my backpack and went to rinse the taste of bile from my mouth when I heard the distinct sound or wood creaking, like stepping on a loose floorboard. I looked over to the origin of the noise, it was the arm, it's fingers twitched. **The fucking arm's fingers moved.**

I sprinted like I was about to be mauled by a bear right the hell out of there. It felt like hours to get there but minutes before I was falling on the stone foundation of the Shinzan shrine. I'd fallen right out into a pair of Japanese and a priest. I was so freaked that I'd effectively forgotten any Japanese I knew in that moment, on the ground and looking back at where once was a barely there path. My arms and legs were pretty cut up from my mad dash through the woods so while I was given some medical attention I was questioned on where I came from what what had happened. I told the priests and police everything I could, my Japanese was still a mess from nerves and there was no interpreter available but since there was no evidence of any crime they assumed an American tourist just got lost and scared in the woods. And I wish that's where it ended.

That night at my hotel I had the worst time sleeping. Every time I would get to sleep I would feel a pressure on my chest and throat like something trying to suffocate and strangle me but the feeling would vanish every time I woke up. At one point I actually managed to sleep long enough to dream, but in it I was standing back at the shrine as a dozen or more arms stretched out from the cave to pin me down while 2 strangled me, jagged black nails digging into my skin. Come 7am I felt like shit and went to take a shower when I saw it, blackish yellow bruises all around me neck. Well I'd already fucked up once and I immediately came to a terrible conclusion; I had 3 days left in Japan and I had to go back to that shrine.

I bought a pack of salt then made my way back up to Shinzan shrine and right where it was the first time, that overgrown path into the woods was there. So I took it. I didn't know at the time that one of the priests had seen me head back up there. I don't know how long it took to get back to the village, I was too in focus to try and keep track, the plan was I would salt the arm before putting it back, salt the cave entrance, say some prayers then head home. But I was not prepared for what I'd find upon my return.

The village was still destroyed, I spent some time poking around, looking for something I could take back as proof. Found a completely rusted head of a Kama that was probably used to harvest rice or something, it'd be enough as evidence for my cause. I ascended the stairs again and set my eyes on the shrine, there was a thick chain and bad lock on the shrine. The shine of their metal sparkled in the sunlight and kept shut the doors of the shrine that had been replaced. I was in complete shock for longer than I want to admit because when I brought myself out of it I noticed the Shimenawa had also been replaced. I walked closer and it was all new like someone had been there after me to fix it. The old Shimenawa was lying in the dirt off to the side of the cave as well. I muttered to myself *What the fuck?* when I heard a whisper in my ear like someone was right behind me, it was Buta's voice, it was Japanese and he said "I warned you".

Second verse same as the first I dropped my salt and sprinted back to Shinzan. By then there were at least 2 priests and 4 cops waiting when I fell out of the woods again. I was in less of a stupor the second time and after being approached by the cops I looked to the priests and asked if they could perform an exorcism. I didn't need much medical help this time since I'd chosen to wear long pants and sleeves for my second venture I explained everything from meeting Buta to the story to my second visit. The cops understandable asked what drugs I was taking but everyone went quite when I pulled the Kama head from my backpack. I told them I picked it up in Zujoshiu village. The cops took the piece and changed the topic to how long I've been in the country, I told them I fly home in 2 days and they put me in their squad car and made sure I was on a train back to Tokyo before the sun set.

According to the cops and priests there were no bruises on my neck and the only reason they even took me seriously at all was that Kama head, which I didn't get to keep. Sleeping had become a real struggle and by the time I was back in Alaska I had a bad habit of mixing sleepaids with booze just so I wouldn't feel like I'm being choked and strangled in my sleep. Was ruining my health and my finances so I went to see a doctor and explained the symptoms while conveniently leaving out the whole Zujoshiu incident, I wanted to sleep, not get locked in a psychward. Again. Diagnosed with Sleep Apnea and Night Terrors.

It's been 13 years since. I don't need meds to sleep anymore, I don't dream either. Still wake up tired though. I should have listened. I should have turned around and left. Curiosity doesn't always kill the cat, sometimes it just maims it.
