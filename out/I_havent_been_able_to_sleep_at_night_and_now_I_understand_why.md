Now, I'm coming to you all to share my story. I understand you aren't going to be able to solve my problems, nor do I expect you to help, but I need someone to listen, not to tell me I'm some nutcase or something. I simply want someone to read, and understand what's been happening to me.

I've always struggled with sleep. Insomnia. Ever since I was young. Whenever I was told to bed, I couldn't. I'd either stare at the ceiling for hours until my brain relented, or I'd cut my losses and read a book. Always been a fan of the night, nice, quiet, time to myself.

Kept this all the way up even to now, currently enrolled in college, all night classes. Studying psychology, maybe I can read my notes and figure out what's wrong with me, so I don't have to consult a therapist. But a couple weeks into my intro class to psychology, I noticed something off. 

There's this weird phenomenon with pretty much anyone studying disease and stuff like that. They call it MSS, Medical Student Syndrome, or Second Year Syndrome. You read all these symptoms, day in day out, basically makes you hyper aware of all the things you think and do, so you notice a load of stuff you normally wouldn't. Dry mouth, headaches, a feeling of being watched, stuff like that. So as you read, you think, “oh no, I have all of these!” That's what I thought was going on. I'm reading into insomnia, as I do often anyway, and get more into the root causes. Basically just a comorbid symptom with a bunch of stuff, anxiety, depression, unfortunately pretty common thing.

What, however, was not common, was sleep paralysis for me. You ever feel sleep paralysis before? One of the scariest things I've ever felt in my life. Your body is locked in place. You can think, you can feel, but you cannot move, no matter how hard you try, or want to try. It's just…god I hate it… But, eventually, I got control of my body again. I was able to sit up, quell my panic, and explain it away to myself. That's my biggest coping mechanism. Explain to myself, why what happened to me, happened to me. Takes away some of that fear of the unknown, y’know? Part of the reason I went into psychology. The one thing I couldn't shake off though, was the feeling someone was *watching* me.

Now that by itself, actually pretty common. Kept us alive back in our caves, while you might not be aware, in the back of your mind, you’re hyper aware of the feeling of someone who’s looking at you. Unfortunately, when your adrenaline starts pumping, that feeling can get kicked on even when no one's there. And that's what I assumed. I was scared, so I got paranoid. Simple as that.

I was not getting back to sleep that night. How could I? I didn't want to get stuck in…that…state again. A couple days go by, I get to sleep, then it happens, again. That same, horrible, locked in feeling. But this…was worse somehow. It lasted what felt like days. I know it wasn't, I assume it's like how an hour at work feels way longer than an hour with friends? But I was 100% there longer. And the entire time, that feeling of being watched was just getting stronger, and stronger. Once I got out of it, I immediately called a friend about it, I just…couldn't be alone… they said maybe I was just overworking myself, so I decided to take a week off for my mental health.

God if only that helped. It was well meaning, but I swear things only got worse from there. That week, for the first time. I saw HIM. I assume you’ve heard of sleep paralysis demons? Basically the idea when something evil is looming over you, your body locks up? The actual scientific reason is basically the part of your brain that's in charge of dreaming hasnt turned off fully, so it kinda…overlaps into real life. That's what I told myself. That's what I wanted to believe. But that…THING was so realistic. It was right at the foot of my bed. This huge…robe? Might have been a coat or something? Doesn't matter, all that matters is that it had a big hood over its head. Covering its face was a…mask…of some sort. A huge eye, staring through me, covered in all sorts of symbols and stuff. And it began to move closer to me. It raised one of its arms and I realized it had shackles on its arms, long chains almost dragging across the floor. And it crawled towards me. Getting closer…and closer…and I could hear…voices…all over lapping…saying things like “just give up”, “it doesn't matter”, “you’re just an afterthought”. And it was all in MY VOICE. I shot up, finally having control over myself, and the thing was gone. I could feel my heart thumping against my chest, my mouth tasted like blood, I could barely breathe how panicked I was.

I didn't sleep that next night. Or the one after that. Every time I tried, I just got a vision of that thing. No matter how badly I wanted rest, I just couldn't bring myself to risk sleep paralysis again. Sleep deprivation has some really taxing effects on the mind, you know? Depression, irritability, hallucinations. Crazy what the mind will conjure up when you can't get any rest. And because of it…the nightmares followed me into my waking hours. On day two of no sleep, I was pouring myself some coffee, and for a few seconds, I was SURE that I saw that eye in the steam. Couldn't drink it after that. I was doing some homework, closed my eyes for 2 seconds, and in my own handwriting, scrawled in this blue ink, “just a fly on the wall” across the entire page. Even playing games on my computer, my screen would flicker and show me that fucking eye staring right back at me. 

I finally slept that night. Didn't even mean to. I passed out at my desk. When I woke up, I was frozen in my slumped over position. I heard him walking up behind me. Those voices…my voices…getting louder and louder…”Lazy”...”Worthless”...”Meaningless”...

And I got up. I had enough. I spun around, and of course, the thing was gone. I hopped in the shower for probably the first time in two weeks. Brushed my teeth, told my mom I loved her. Scheduled some appointments I'd been putting off too long. Just…tried putting myself back together. The hallucinations stopped. The feeling of being watched, faded. Still there, but…distant. The paralysis became less and less common. I’ve been better for a decent bit now, rare I have sleep paralysis, if at all. But now, I have a new problem.

I’ve begun sleep walking.
