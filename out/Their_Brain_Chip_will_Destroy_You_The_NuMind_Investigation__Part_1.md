Her family have kindly given me permission to reproduce her account here.**

**I intent to document my investigation of NuMind here in the hopes that the company has a harder time censoring this account, and so that it may be used as evidence should justice one day be served.

'I still don't understand.' I said, raising my eyes from the pamphlet to the oily man standing in front of me. He smiled a wide smile, displaying a set of gleaming white teeth.

'It's all very simple.' He said, explaining again without a hint of impatience. 'We're offering to expand your brain. Upgrade it, like slotting another stick of RAM into your computer, but for humans instead. Haven't you always wanted to have better memory, think faster on your feet, do all the maths you could never do in school?'

I looked around at the people bustling past on the street, all of them deliberately avoiding eye contact with the people at the stall so they didn't get sucked into a sales pitch like I had. I huffed and set my jaw, trying to think of a way to finally disentangle myself.

'I'm happy the way I am, I don't need _upgrading_' I said firmly. 'Now I need to get on.'

I went to leave, but the man took a small step forwards and held up his hands as if surrendering.
'I didn't mean any offence, I can just see that you're someone with amazing potential and I wanted to see if I could help. Really, I didn't mean anything by it. Look, I'm not meant to do this, but I can give you a sample...'

Casting a furtive look at his colleagues who were all busy trying to snag their own victims, he pulled a small packet, barely bigger than a postage stamp, out of a pouch at his waist. It was made of a rainbow-reflective plastic and had "NuMind" stamped across it. He opened it and let a small golden sticker fall into his palm. Knowing better than to take the sample of whatever this was and get sucked further into the pitch I actually turned to walk away, but he abruptly darted forwards and stuck it to the back of my wrist. Just brazenly put his hand on me in the middle of the street.

I recoiled, absolutely scandalised as my hand flew to where he'd touched. 

'What the actual hell is wrong with you??' I shouted, causing a few people to glance over at my outburst. I opened my mouth to let him have the biggest piece of my mind I could manage, and then...
It was like when you put on glasses for the first time and you realise just how blurry everything had been. That moment when a problem clicks in your head, and all the parts suddenly make perfect sense. Standing on the street, I was suddenly inundated with information, and I was processing _all_ of it. 

_That middle aged woman was struggling with her bags due to minor untreated disk damage; from how she held her shoulders it was affecting the L4 and L5 vertebrae. The elderly man walking past had eaten fast food for lunch, the smell of his sweat and the oils on his skin indicate he'd had the full-sugar drink, despite his diabetes. The chain clothes shop in front of me would fail within the next two years as I had only seen one hundred and fourteen people wearing their brand of clothes in the last year and assuming a 7% net profit margin against the standard high-street rental rate of..._

All at once the feeling faded. My brain dimmed, the new power of my mind falling away like the memory of a dream. It was as if the world had lost saturation. I stood for a moment, stunned, and sweatier than before, the small sticker glinting on my arm. The salesman was looking at me, grinning.

'Amazing isn't it?' He said, his enthusiasm seeming genuine. 'And that was just what we could put into the sample technology, there's so, so much more!'

'I...What was that? Be real with me.' I said, still reeling. 'Is this drugs? Like is it a chemical thing?' I knew there were substances that could be absorbed through the skin, LSD and cocaine, but I'd never tried anything more than alcohol.

Ahmad, I saw his nametag as I leaned in, laughed. He gestured to the bright blue signage behind us, and the few other guys and girls in blue windbreakers talking to pedestrians.

'I'd think anyone selling drugs wouldn't want to be this obvious about it. This isn't drugs Miss, it's technology! New, powerful technology! And we're here to find people like you, people with potential and drive, to make the most of it.'

'Why advertise on the street like this? It seems so... sketchy. No offence.'

'Keeps it off the radar, to generate an underground buzz before full launch.'

'And are you using one?' I asked suspiciously.

'We recommend only having it active for two hours a day at most. I save mine for personal time.' Another smile.

I considered. 'Alright, how does it work then?'

'Femtoprocessors intercept nerve signals and use machine learning to interpolate the brain activity before running complementary processes as psuedoneurons and feeding the resultant information directly to the hippocampus via milliamp beta waves.' 

He grinned at my expression and held up a small handbook. 'That's what it says in here anyway. I'm sales, not engineering.'

'So...so what does all that mean?' I asked, still working my way through his answers in my head, missing the brainpower I'd had moments ago.

Ahmad pivoted easily on my question. 'It means that I can hook you up. That sticker was level one, but for a small direct debit I can get you to level ten.' 

I tried to play it cool, but the truth was that I was sold. I'd been sold since I'd touched the sticker and had reality spin 90 degrees on me. The negotiation didn't take long, and I walked away with a box the size of a phone case in my jacket pocket and a new financial obligation to the NuMind corporation.

I was anxious when I arrived back home, and pulled the contents of the box out immediately. The foil looked similar to the sticker, but the patch was larger this time, around the size of a credit card and designed to be worn on the back of my neck according to the small instruction note. With shaking hands I applied it, feeling the cool material stick to my sweat, along with a small pricking sensation.

I sat for a moment in shock, looking around my living room, in the flood of information and thoughts that were suddenly racing through me. I remembered where I'd gotten every piece of furniture, knew their names, even in Swedish. I wandered over to my bookcase and picked out every title in seconds, recalling the full stories of all of the ones I'd read as easily as remembering my own name. I focused on one, and suddenly saw the narrative expand in my mind, connections between the characters and themes that I'd never been aware of before leaping out at me, clear as day.

In awe, I took a few steps when my work bag caught my eye. Thinking about work, suddenly a lot of things made sense in my mind. The office politics, the favouritism for others that my boss showed that I'd never been consciously aware of. My thoughts flashed between my network, my skillset, the active projects that suddenly seemed so simple. All I had to do was get in better with Jim in HR, work the social web that was suddenly so clear to me. I'd always deserved better, had always been looked down on and held back, and now I had the ability to change things...

It was as I was eating half an hour later, devouring bread in the grip of a sudden hunger, that I had a simple thought: _If one was good, more must be better._ I was in the middle of my third book, a pop-science title on black holes I'd never gotten around to reading, when I realised that my new NuMind brain didn't need to be the upper limit. Ten minutes and some internet searching later gave me a crash course on femtoprocessors, brain waves and the rest, even though the information was sparse for this new tech. Nothing suggested an upper limit to the effectiveness; just one paper warned of excessive metabolic activity from prolonged use, and that was easily managed. NuMind's website itself warned against adding additional patches, citing untested impacts, but I didn't care. I was greedy and wanted more.

Getting a second patch was surprisingly easy, though it meant some time without my NuMind which I already found disconcerting. After scouting the area for an afternoon, and with my sister's card details memorised, I waited for Ahmad to take a break and approached a different salesperson. A discussion with Anne, some forged details, and a bus ride later I was back in my flat with a hammering heart and a second box. Breathing shakily, I put both stickers on my neck.

How do I describe my world at that moment? You know when you do a task you're familiar with like chopping vegetables, but you're also chatting with someone in the room and scanning the worktop for the next ingredient at the same time? Your brain effortlessly handling the different tasks with different areas, yet all are seamlessly a part of your conscious experience? My mind floated apart, different layers following trains of thought that all wove through me and were me, threads of consciousness that wove together into the fabric of _me_. And the universe opened itself before me.

For the next hour I simply _thought_, though that seems like an inadequate word. The difference between my brain then and now felt the same as trying to explain existential dread to a hamster; concepts and connections that had seemed impenetrable before were resolving within an instant. The threads of history, mathematics, philosophy, all seen from a bird's eye view and completely understood. Wherever I cast my mind, whatever I looked up in books or online or within the recesses of my brain, all was laid bare. I felt immortal.

That night I wrote, fourteen thousand words at least, on science and technology and anything else that crossed my buzzing mind. The idea was to take the concepts and expand on them, seeing if I could break new ground, maybe get a theory named after me. Of course I knew that as soon as people who were naturally smart got their hands on the tech then I'd be out-competed, so time was of the essence. I flitted between subjects, trying to get down as many new thoughts as possible, ignoring the growing heat in my head.

_Femtoprocessors gain increased efficiency at higher temperatures, forming a peak close to 39 degrees celcius_

I'd been working faster as the night went on, refusing sleep, almost physically able to feel the NuMind compensating for my tired brain. The work was important though, a dissonance between my higher ideals and baser human need for recognition.

_Beta waves from the chip are competing with my theta-dominant brain state, leading to some loss of lucidity._

I was moving on to psychology, determined to finish one final section before succumbing to sleep. Knowing that I should stop soon.

_I'm being watched._

I froze, all threads of my mind suddenly snapping taught. Something was here, something that I couldn't see. My eyes flew around the room, all details leaping out to me, everything still except me. I was breathing too fast.

_The human brain seeks patterns in its environment due to-_

_Detection of threats is prioritised in most creatures as a survival mechanism_'

_Femtoprocessors nearly double in efficiency at 39 degrees, leading to-'_



_They're all around us._

All at once I could sense them. Head feeling like it was bursting, sweat pouring from me, I could sense them. From the oldest part of the brain that sees the shadow in the bushes and knows it to mean teeth and claws, the part of the brain more ancient than consciousness that speaks in nothing but instinct, I knew them to be around me. 

_Spacetime is the fabric of reality, and they stared at me from the space between the threads. Particles are ripples in the fields that make up the universe, and they were the shapes beneath the waves. Our realities are shadows we watch flickering on the walls of a cave, and their breath is on the back of my neck._

Now I got to experience the sensation of a neurologically enhanced panic attack. Fear normally limits the higher brain functions and sparks up the amygdala, giving a tunnel-vision to thoughts. No such luck for me though, as my NuMind kept me full and alert on multiple levels as I spiralled down an existential nightmare. I could almost feel the synthetic thoughts being injected into the meat of my head, the panic being harvested and processed and upgraded to higher dimensions by the sterile hardware on the back of my neck. I wanted to scream, but the thoughts and emotions piled at the back of my throat and wouldn’t release. Instead I staggered upright, clawing at the back of my neck, fingers coming away bloody as I felt the barbs of the NuMind pull free of my skin and thoughts.

_Hypoxia is a lack of oxygen to the brain, and can be caused by insufficient breath during moments of acute stress._

One lingering thread of consciousness had the foresight to drop me to my knees before I passed out.

***

I still know that they're watching me. Even with the pills and the therapy and everything else the nurses do. It's like finding out that there's a hidden camera in your room; I can try to live my life, but there's always just those _eyes_, just behind the veil. The extra brain power, that expansion given to me by NuMind, that's all gone. The eyes though...

There's a flake of gold. It's under the fingernail on my middle finger of my left hand, it must have gotten lodged there when I was scratching those patches off my neck. I could probably get it out, if I wanted, but I don't want to. The flake reminds me that they're here, the width of a shadow away. I don't think I could stand to forget.
