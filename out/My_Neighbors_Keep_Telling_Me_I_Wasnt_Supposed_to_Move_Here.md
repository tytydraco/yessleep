I really need to write all this down while I still can. While I'm still sure of what I've seen. Hopefully someone can help me or knows what I should do.

About five weeks ago I packed everything I owned into my beat up Dodge Ram and drove from Lenox, Massachusetts to Stagwell, Maine for a delivery driver position at a big distribution center. The pay was way better than what I was making and rent was half the cost. I was tired of choosing between groceries and gas. At the time, it seemed like the right move.

The company closed two days before my start date.

I found out when I showed up and the building was locked. Not weekend closed. Abandoned. The loading docks were empty and there was a bank notice taped to the front door about some kind of asset seizure. I sat in my truck in that parking lot for over an hour trying to figure out what to do. I called the manager who hired me and the number was disconnected. I called the HR line and got a recording saying the mailbox was full.

I had already signed a lease on a house outside of town. Spent what little savings I had on the first month and deposit. The money I have left might cover two weeks of expenses if I'm careful. Not enough to break the lease and start over somewhere else. Not enough to move back home.

So I stayed.

That's when I started noticing how people look at me here.

Mainers have this thing where if you weren't born here you're what they call "from away." Doesn't matter if you've lived here twenty years. You're still from away. I expected some cold shoulders and slow service. New England reserve and all that. But this is different.

They stare.

Not the normal curious glances you get in a small town when a stranger shows up. These are long, deliberate stares that don't break when you notice. The woman at the grocery store watched me walk down every aisle. Didn't even pretend to be doing anything else. Just stood there by the registers with her arms crossed and followed me with her eyes. The old man who walks his dog goes past my house four or five times a day. Each time he stops at the end of my driveway and stares at the house for a long time before he moves on.

Yesterday I went to the only diner in town for lunch. Every conversation seemed to stop when I walked in. Just cut off mid sentence. A dozen people turned, one by one in their seats and looked at me as I walked to my table. The waitress took my order without writing anything down and never once looked away from my face. When my food came out it was cold. I ate it anyway because I couldn't afford to waste the money. And I was too nervous to speak up. The whole time I felt eyes on the back of my neck.

When I was leaving, four of them were standing outside the diner, in the cold. No coats. Just standing there watching me get in my truck to leave.

I keep the curtains in the house closed now.

It doesn't help my nerves. It's old and makes all the sounds old houses make. Floorboards creaking. Pipes knocking. Windows rattling when the wind picks up. I tell myself they're normal sounds but they don't feel normal when you're lying awake at night counting how many times the same pickup truck has driven past in the last hour.

I've never met my landlord by the way. Everything was done through email. I dropped the check in the mailbox on the front door like he asked. Never got a response. Never got a receipt. The check cleared though so I guess that's something.

I tried making conversation at the post office two days ago. Asked the clerk if there were any places hiring. Any restaurants or shops that needed help. She stared at me for a long time before answering.

"You should stay close to home. Especially with the festival coming."

"What festival?" I asked.

She didn't blink. "The Winter Festival. Town tradition."

"When is it?"

"December 28th." She handed me my mail even though I hadn't given her my name or address. "Sorry, but it's not for people from away."

I wanted to ask more but she turned her back and walked into some back room. Left me standing there at the counter.

That was two days ago and now I'm seeing signs for it everywhere. Handwritten posters stapled to telephone poles. Notices taped in shop windows. "Winter Festival Dec 28 Residents Only" in marker on white paper. Some of them have drawings on them. Symbols. Spirals and branching lines that look like trees or maybe antlers or something else I can't make sense of.

I asked my neighbor about it this morning. He's older, maybe seventy. Keeps to himself mostly. He's the only person who's even nodded at me since I moved in. I caught him taking his trash out.

"Hey," I called from my porch. "What's this festival everyone keeps mentioning?"

He stopped moving. Completely froze with his hand still gripping the trash bin. When he turned around the look on his face made my stomach drop.

"You weren't supposed to be here," he said. His voice was quiet. Almost sad. "This house was supposed to stay empty this winter."

"What does that mean?"

He looked past me at my door. At my windows. "Lock your doors at night. Keep your curtains closed. And on the 28th no matter what you hear or what you see you stay inside. You understand? You stay inside and you don't look."

He went back in his house before I could ask anything else.

That was six hours ago.

It's getting dark now. There's someone standing at the edge of the trees behind my house. They've been there for forty minutes. Not moving. Just standing there in the cold watching my house.

I don't know what's happening here. I don't know what this festival is or why everyone keeps saying I shouldn't be here. But December 28th is in sixteen, short days and I'm starting to think I'm not just unwelcome in this town.

I think something bad is supposed to happen to me.
