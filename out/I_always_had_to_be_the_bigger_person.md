Conflict resolution is a funny thing, a kind of equalizer. We think we're all so different, but in reality we all handle conflict the same couple ways. Some people ignore it and hope it goes away, some love throwing gas on those fires.



Me? I'm a high road kind of guy. Most often I can will myself to be the bigger person and move on. In fact that's pretty much my exclusive strategy for conflict resolution. To be honest, I think it might be a superiority thing. That's what my ex said anyway.



To be clear, this just started happening, or maybe I just started noticing. It was just last week, I went to my regular coffee shop and ordered my regular drink, and cashed out with my regular barista. He was a friendly guy, maybe a little slow. He messed up my order (I always get no whipped cream), I said something about it, and he got kinda shitty with me. 



As always I shrugged it off and let it go.

When I came back the next morning he looked like he was standing on a milk crate behind the counter. But he wasn't just taller, his clothes were really tight to his body. At first I thought it must be steroids. I doubled down on that bet when he very aggressively slammed my drink down, splashing it all over me.



He just grinned and said, "just be the bigger person, right?"



I am overweight. I do not run. The speed with which I vacated that shop probably set a record. I got back to my shitty studio apartment as fast as I could manage, and frantically dialed my girlfriend. She didn't answer. Shit. I decided to brave it and hustle over to her place. Only a few blocks.



I'm an average height guy, I'd probably look tall if I lost weight. But today I noticed, in the surging groups of pedestrians, a few familiar faces floated above the throngs. Weird. I knocked hard on her door when I arrived. I could hear movements on the other side of the door, heavy and slow movements. I tried the knob, and it gave freely. I swung the door open and her name never made it past my teeth.



Wall to wall. Like something out of 'the thing' a huge fleshy mass, flesh toned but featureless. It twitched occasionally. I could see a suggestion of golden blonde locks from within one of the many folds. The morbid curiosity getting the better of me, I dug into the flesh mound.



As I lifted a large curtain of sweaty meat, I yelped, and fell back against the wall. Within the bloom of flesh I found her face. Embedded deep in the blob. I ran out of the apartment and vomited more than what was in my stomach. Holy shit, is she dead?



I pulled out my phone to call the police, to call someone. And I remembered every argument she and I ever had. I always had to be the bigger person with her. Now she's massive. I remembered arguing with a cop that pulled me over. You can guess how I handled that.



When the cops pulled up, they sat in the car for a long time, I waited for them to approach me, but they never did. I walked up and peered in the window. Against the tinted windows all I could see was some god awful tattoo of a lion or something stretched thin and pressed firmly against the window. What the hell. I could hear the patrol car loudly creaking in protest to its load.



I backed away, apparently at the perfect time, as the door swung open fast, the ironically pig-like flesh of the officer poured out onto the pavement. My heart was hammering, and I sprinted away.



As I ran I could see them, on the horizon, a couple blocks over, everywhere. Humanoid shaped sky scrapers. I sat in my apartment for days hearing a constant rumble of gargantuan steps wandering aimlessly.



I still have internet, and my phone still works. Granted my reception is dog ass in this bunker. I had to flee my apartment when the lady in 4F fell through the floor and took most of the building with her.

I'm still pretty sure this is localized. There's nothing about it on the internet or any news sites.



I'm running low on food, so I'll have to go out again soon. I started up the ladder out of my burrow and heaved the hermetic sealed door open. Mr. Bennet wasn't going to miss his fallout shelter, he could never dream of fitting inside now. I wish I never said anything about his dog shitting outside my building.



I wonder if they're still in there. Human but trapped, or are their minds gone completely? They wander like lost puppies or grazing cattle. I heard the roar of a jet engine slashing the sky in half. The food could wait. I ran as fast as my untrained legs would carry me and half fell, half climbed into the cold hole in the ground. After just a few moments of holding my breath, I heard it. Distant at first.



Large booming explosions punctuated each other topside. It sounded like bubble wrap, if each bubble was a few megatons. I waited for the explosions to stop, or for the ceiling to fall on me. The former happened, the latter did not. I don't know the difference between a conventional bomb and a nuclear one, so I didn't know if I should wait.



I decided my odds were about the same no matter what I did, so I decided to at least take a peek above ground. If I opened it and atomic hellfire melted my face, well at least it's be quick. When I did look, I wished the hellfire had gotten me instead. 



Towering above the wreckage of what was once my home city, enormous skeletal frames wandered, kicking up rubble. The internet is coming and going now, I can be online for about an hour each day. I had to get this out. Whatever you do, stay away from [redacted], Ohio, and for the love of God, just settle your conflicts.
