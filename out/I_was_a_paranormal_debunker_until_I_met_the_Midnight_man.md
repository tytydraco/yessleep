I used to be a paranormal debunker.

You know the type: the asshole in the comments saying “Actually, that’s just pareidolia and bad audio compression.”

That was me. For eight years, I made a living taking people’s monsters apart and showing them the loose screws. I’d go into “haunted” houses, review grainy CCTV, rewatch “demonic” social media posts frame-by-frame and send back a neat little report:

It’s the wind. It’s mould. It’s your neighbour’s Wi-Fi camera. It’s grief.

They paid me to tell them it wasn’t real.

And I was always right.

Until I learned about the Midnight Man.

I didn’t find him on some cursed forum or ancient book. He found me in a client email that, at first, looked like all the rest.

Subject: URGENT – Please Prove This Is Fake.

Hi Daniel,

My daughter played a game she found on TikTok. The Midnight Game. Now she won’t sleep, won’t eat, and says ‘he’ is in the house. Can you please help convince her it’s not real? I’ll pay whatever you charge for an emergency visit.

There was an attachment:

RULES FOR THE MIDNIGHT GAME.docx

I almost deleted it.

Games like that are all the same: candles, salt, mirrors, “you must do this or else.” Urban legends repackaged for bored teenagers.

But then I read the rules.

Rule 1: Write your full name on a piece of paper. Add one drop of your blood. Place it in front of your front door.

Rule 2: Exactly at 12:00 AM, knock on your own door 22 times. The final knock must land whilst the clock is still 12:00

Rule 3: Open the door, then blow out your candle and close the door again. You have just invited the Midnight Man inside.

Rule 4: Relight your candle immediately.

Rule 5: From 12:01 AM until 3:33 AM, you must keep moving. Do not stay in one place for more than a few seconds.

Rule 6: If your candle goes out, immediately draw a circle of salt around yourself and stay inside it until 3:33 AM.

Rule 7: Do NOT look directly at him. If you do, he will show you your worst fear. Most people do not survive that.

Rule 8: Do NOT speak to, touch, or acknowledge any person you see in your house between 12 and 3:33 AM, unless you are absolutely sure they are real.

Rule 9: Do NOT leave the house during the game.

Rule 10: The game ends at 3:33 AM. If you are alive and in one piece, you “win.” Nothing will happen… for a while.

At the end, a line in bold:

If you fail to follow these rules, the Midnight Man will claim you.

I scoffed. The whole thing read like a fanfic version of every other “summoning game” out there.

I emailed the mother back, set a time, and drove out the next night, halfway across the county to a tidy semi-detached in a normal estate. The kind of place where the worst thing that should ever happen is a wheelie bin going missing.

Her name was Laura. She looked like she hadn’t slept in days.

“Thank you for coming,” she said, ushering me inside. “I know it’s stupid. I know it’s just… kids scaring themselves, but she’s not eating. She won’t go upstairs alone. She screams if the lights go off. I just, I need someone with… science.” She gestured vaguely at my bag. “With gear. To show her it’s fake.”

Kids were often my worst cases. Adults want their fears fixed. Teenagers want their fears believed. I’d learned that the hard way.

“Where is she now?” I asked.

“In her room. Won’t come out.” She paused. “She said he sits outside her door now. Every night, waiting. I tried telling her if he was real, we’d all see him, but she just cried harder.”

I heard it then, a soft, rhythmic tapping from upstairs.

Tap.

Tap.

Tap.

“Is that her?” I asked.

Laura swallowed. “She says it’s his fingers.”

I told myself it was a loose pipe.

The girl, Mia, was fourteen, grey-faced and hollow-eyed, sitting on her bed in yesterday’s clothes. Her curtains were taped shut. Her bedside lamp was on, plus a battery lantern and a string of fairy lights. No shadows left if she could help it.

“I’m not crazy,” she said before I even introduced myself. “Mum says you’re going to tell me it’s all in my head, but it’s not. It’s in the house.”

“I’m not here to say you’re crazy,” I said, pulling out my standard kit: EMF meter, thermal camera, audio recorder. Props, mostly. They made people feel like I was doing something real. “I’m here to see what happened and explain it. That’s all. Start from the beginning.”

She took a breath that shuddered all the way through her.

“We saw it on social media. Me and Becca. ‘The Midnight Game Challenge.’ You have to play it alone, but you can, like, be on call with someone else playing. So we did. We followed the steps. Wrote our names. Blood. Candle. Knocked 22 times. Let him in.” Her eyes flicked to the bedroom door as she said it. “It was a joke. We were laughing at the comments.”

“How long ago?” I asked.

“Four nights.” She dug at her thumb with a chewed nail. “It was fine at first. Dark, creepy, whatever. I heard stuff, but I thought it was my brain. You know? TikTok sound effects, neighbours. But then my candle went out.”

She gripped the duvet. Her knuckles went white.

“I didn’t have salt. I forgot that part. So I used sugar. I thought it was the same. He… didn’t.” Her eyes went glassy, unfocused. “The air went cold. Not like ‘I’m scared’ cold. Like freezer-burn cold. Something moved behind me and I knew, I just knew, if I turned around I’d see...” She cut herself off, breathing fast. “He didn’t show me monsters. He showed me things that haven’t happened yet. Things that haven’t happened and can’t happen and will happen and...”

I held up a hand. “Okay. It’s okay. We don’t have to go into that. Can I ask,did anything physical happen? Scratches, nosebleeds, objects moved?”

She lifted her hair without a word.

On the back of her neck, at the base of her skull, the skin looked… wrong. Not like a cut. Like frostbite in the shape of fingertips. Four on one side, thumb on the other. As if something cold had cupped the back of her head and squeezed.

I’ve seen kids dig their nails into their own skin. I’ve seen self-harm, psychosomatic rashes, hysterical bruising.

This wasn’t that.

I took a picture, pretending it didn’t rattle me.

“I hear him every night,” she whispered. “He didn’t leave at 3:33. That’s a lie. He stays if you lose. He just makes you wish he’d kill you quick instead.”

Something thumped softly outside the door.

Tap.

Tap.

Tap.

Her eyes went wide. She grabbed my wrist.

“Don’t open it,” she hissed. “He doesn’t like being checked on.”

I cleared my throat, forced my hand away, and opened the door.

The landing was empty.

But the EMF meter, which had been flat, spiked so hard it squealed.

I could have walked away. I should have. I could have told Laura: It’s stress. It’s TikTok. It’s mass suggestion. Send them both to therapy, file my report, take the money.

But I’d seen that frostbite handprint. I’d seen the EMF spike in a dead-quiet house with modern wiring.

And I’d heard the way Mia said “He stays.”

I made a mistake then.

I let my pride answer.

“Alright,” I told Laura in the kitchen. The house lights felt too bright somehow, like they were trying too hard. “I’ll prove it’s fake. Not just to her,to you, to me, to him if he’s listening. I’ll play it. Here. Tonight. Properly. Every rule, every step, documented.”

Laura paled. “You don’t have to do that. I just wanted...”

“You wanted proof,” I said. “If I play exactly the way the instructions say and nothing happens, you can show Mia the footage. Sometimes that’s what it takes.”

That’s the thing about debunkers. Deep down, we’re daredevils with a lab coat on. We poke the bear because we’re so sure it’s just a guy in a costume.

Her hands trembled as she made me coffee. “If… if you’re sure.”

I wasn’t. Not really. But I was curious, and curiosity is just fear that thinks it’s clever.

We started at 11:30 PM.

I set my equipment up in the hallway: tripod camera facing the front door, secondary camera on a bookshelf covering the hall and stairs, audio recorder on the console table. I took baseline readings: EMF low, ambient temperature a little chilly but normal for an old British house in October.

Mia stayed in her room. She refused to come downstairs. I didn’t blame her.

Laura hovered in the living room, clutching her dressing gown like a shield.

The rules said I had to play alone. So at 11:55, I asked Laura to go upstairs and close her door.

“If you hear anything,” she started.

“I’ll shout,” I said. “Or I’ll be embarrassed tomorrow when I show you how boring this was.”

She didn’t smile.

At 11:58, I sat on the floor in front of the door, knees creaking, and prepared.

I wrote my full name on the paper in block capitals.

Daniel Matthew Cole.

I pricked my finger with a sterilised lancet from my kit (ghost-hunting gear overlaps a lot with diabetes gear, it turns out). One drop of blood, dark and heavy, hit the paper and spread.

I placed it on the doormat.

My candle was a plain white pillar, the sort you buy for power cuts. I lit it and turned off every other light in the house.

Instantly, the world shrank to the small, flickering circle around me.

The camera’s red recording light winked back from the darkness.

I checked my phone. 11:59:37.

My heart was beating faster than I liked.

“It’s a ritual,” I muttered to myself. “Rituals feel powerful because they’re structured. That’s all.”

The minutes ticked.

When my lock screen changed to 12:00:00, I started knocking.

Rule 2: Exactly at 11:59 AM, knock on your own door 22 times. The final knock must land at 12:00:00.

“What precisely counts as ‘land’?” I’d scoffed earlier, reading it. “Do they know how milliseconds work?”

It’s funny what your brain latches onto when you’re scared. Stupid details.

I counted the knocks under my breath. One, two… nine… fifteen… twenty…

The candle flame fluttered with every impact, smearing shadows across the hallway walls.

“Twenty-one,” I whispered.

I held my breath. There was something obscene about hitting your own front door from the inside, like trying to get out of your own life.

“Twenty-two.”

My knuckles connected with wood and the moment they did, the entire house seemed to… drop. Like a lift juddering at the bottom of a shaft.

My phone ticked over to 12:00:00.

Rule 3: Open the door, then blow out your candle and close the door again. You have just invited the Midnight Man inside.

I unlocked the door, opened it a crack. The night outside was misty and still. No wind, no foxes, no passing cars. The street looked wrong in candlelight, all hard edges and over-saturated shadows.

I blew the candle out.

The dark that rushed in felt thick. Not just absence-of-light dark. Presence dark. Heavy. Watching.

I closed the door. Locked it. Heart hammering.

My hands shook just enough that it took me two tries to relight the candle.

Rule 4: Relight your candle immediately.

I managed it...

Well done, I thought. You have successfully set the mood for yourself, idiot.

I checked the time again. 12:01.

Three hours and thirty-two minutes to go.

People imagine these games as frantic from the start: walls bleeding, voices, chase scenes.

Mostly, it was walking. Just… walking.

The rules said not to stay in one place more than a few seconds, so I paced the downstairs circuit: hallway, living room, kitchen, back to hallway. Every door open so I didn’t fumble. Candle in hand, audio recorder clipped to my shirt, EMF meter in my pocket.

The house creaked and settled. My shoulders loosened a fraction. It was just a house, and I’d let a story get under my skin.

By 12:17, I was bored enough to start narrating for the camera.

“This is Daniel, approximately seventeen minutes into the Midnight Game. No anomalous readings so far. EMF baseline. No audible voices. No...”

I stopped.

From upstairs, something moved.

Not a creak. Not a random settling noise.

A step.

Deliberate.

Heel-to-toe, heel-to-toe, pacing right above me.

I swallowed.

“Could be Laura,” I muttered, even though I’d told her to stay put. “Or Mia.” Or old pipes, or mice, or…

The footsteps stopped directly over my head, at the top of the stairs.

The candle flame leaned toward the staircase as if something had exhaled down it.

My EMF meter squealed from my pocket.

My mouth went dry.

You can reason yourself out of fear until your senses disagree. Then the lizard-brain takes over.

I forced myself to keep moving, doing slow loops through the living room, eyes pointed at the floor so I wouldn’t accidentally catch a shadow that looked too tall.

From the corner of my eye, I saw movement in the doorway.

Bare feet. Small. A nightdress hem.

“Mia?” I said automatically, looking up.

The doorway was empty.

The air where she should have been was colder.

Rule 8: Do NOT speak to, touch, or acknowledge any person you see in your house between 12 and 3:33 AM, unless you are absolutely sure they are real.

“Well, that’s broken,” I whispered. “Good start.”

Still no reason to believe anything paranormal was happening. Sleepwalking. Suggestion. My own tired brain misfiring.

I checked the time.

12:34.

The candle went out.

It didn’t flicker and die like a normal flame. It went from burning steadily to gone, like someone pinched it.

The darkness hit me like cold water. Something inside it moved, just behind my shoulder-blades, like a presence leaning in.

My hand shook as I grabbed for the matches.

The match wouldn’t strike.

Once.

Twice.

Three times, the head crumbled off, useless, onto the floor.

The air grew colder, pressure building in my ears like I was underwater.

Rule 6: If your candle goes out, immediately draw a circle of salt around yourself and stay inside it until 3:33 AM.

My fingers fumbled for the salt. Bag. Open. Pour.

I poured in a messy, shaking loop around myself, grains pattering like soft static on the wooden floor.

I finished the circle, and the pressure… stopped.

The dark was still total, my eyes blind and useless, but the sense of something closing in paused at the edge of the salt, like it had hit a wall.

My chest heaved.

“Okay,” I whispered into the recorder. My own voice sounded wrong in the dark, like it belonged to someone else. “We have… an anomalous event. Candle extinguished without apparent air movement. Difficulty striking matches… perceived drop in temperature. Possible panic response.”

I tried another match.

It lit on the first strike.

I relit the candle. The little pool of light showed my salt circle, clumsy but unbroken.

Outside it, right at the edge of the grains, something had left… marks. Each about the size of a finger, pressed into the fine layer of dust on the floorboards. Four parallel lines… then another four… then another. Like someone had dragged both hands around my circle, testing it.

I didn’t say anything. I just raised the EMF meter and watched it flutter between normal and what-the-fuck.

I wanted to call out to Laura. To say I was done, I was convinced, I was sorry for being smug.

But the rules said not to let anyone in. And I had the distinct, sinking feeling that if I opened my mouth and shouted, something else would answer.

I stepped carefully over the salt and forced myself back into motion.

Time lost meaning for a while.

I walked. I listened. I tried not to look at the corners, where the darkness felt… thicker. Like it was folding in on itself, almost-shapes pulsing in and out of existence.

Once, as I passed the hallway mirror, I saw a tall, thin shape behind me, where my reflection should have been. No face. Just the impression of height and limbs too long, bent slightly to fit.

I didn’t look up. I kept my eyes on the floor. That was the only reason I didn’t break Rule 7.

At some point, my phone buzzed in my pocket. A text from an unknown number.

12:59 AM: you’re doing so well, Daniel.

I swallowed bile.

No one outside this house should know what I was doing. Even if the number was spoofed, why was there no contact name, no code, no country prefix?

Another text.

don’t stop moving. i like you better this way.

I turned airplane mode on and put the phone face-down on the console table.

The footsteps started again upstairs.

Heel-to-toe. Heel-to-toe.

Pacing. Waiting.

The first time he spoke to me, it wasn’t a voice. Not really.

I was passing the closed door to the under-stairs cupboard when, for a second, the wood vanished and I saw...

Not with my eyes. With something deeper.

A staircase going down instead of up. Steps worn thin at the center. Walls too narrow, too close, pulsing slightly like a throat. At the bottom, in the dark, something tall and pale and hungry waited, his outline blurred, like he only existed when you weren’t quite looking at him.

My hand jerked away from the door.

Worst fear, I thought. That’s what the rules promised he’d show you if you broke them. Your worst fear.

I’d always thought my worst fear was something basic. Spiders. Dying alone. That sort of thing.

I was wrong.

My worst fear was being wrong. That all the things I’d laughed at were real. That I’d been walking naked through a world full of teeth, and tonight was the first time something had decided to bite down.

The vision snapped shut. Wood was solid under my palm again. The candle sputtered, then steadied.

“Fuck you,” I whispered at the door. “I’m still here.”

The air around me pulsed with a low, soundless amusement.

At 2:12 AM, the crying started.

Mia’s voice. High and cracked and terrified.

“Dan? Dan, please, are you there? I can’t move. He’s in my room. Dan, PLEASE,”

My heart punched the base of my throat.

“Mia?” I called before I could stop myself, turning toward the stairs.

The instant her name left my mouth, the crying cut off.

Not faded. Not muffled.

Cut. Like someone hit mute.

Something ran down the stairs then. Fast. On all fours. The sound of hands and feet slapping wood. It stopped just out of the candle’s reach.

I didn’t look up. Every instinct screamed at me to tilt my head, to see what was right there in the dark, breathing too fast.

I stared at my feet and recited the rules in my head like a mantra.

Don’t look. Don’t speak. Don’t touch. Don’t leave. Keep moving.

The breathing hitched. Then a whisper, right next to my ear, where no one tall enough should have been.

“good boy.”

I nearly dropped the candle.

By 2:47 AM, my legs shook from constant movement. My lower back ached. Every loop of the house felt longer than the last, the hallway stretching, the kitchen narrowing, the living room turning into a tunnel.

I checked my phone again.

No signal.

Time: 2:47 AM.

Forty-six minutes.

“I can do forty-six minutes,” I muttered.

The house disagreed.

The next time I passed the front door, there were scratches on it.

Four long, vertical gouges, just deep enough to tear the paint. Fresh. No splintering. As if something with patience had dragged its nails slowly down, enjoying the resistance.

My own handwriting stared back at me from the paper on the mat.

DANIEL MATTHEW COLE.

The blood drop was dry.

A second drop had appeared next to it.

I hadn’t given that one.

I kept walking.

We think of rules stories as horror because of what happens when you break them. Midnight Man taught me the horror comes from the moment you realise you don’t actually know whether you’ve broken them or not.

Did I speak to someone who wasn’t real when I answered Mia’s fake crying?

Did I “acknowledge” him by reading those texts?

Did the salt circle count if some grains scattered when I stepped over it?

Did looking at his reflection count as looking at him?

The rules were clear… until they weren’t.

Until every breath felt like a potential violation.

By 3:20, my brain was sliding on itself.

I counted loops. I counted heartbeats. I counted rule numbers under my breath, checking and re-checking them like rosary beads.

On the thirty-somethingth loop past the staircase, someone was standing on the third step up.

Bare feet. Long legs. Hands hanging a fraction too low. Torso disappearing into the dark.

My eyes flicked up instinctively, stopping at the knees.

I didn’t go any higher.

The candle flame bent toward him like a flower toward the sun.

The EMF meter in my pocket went dead.

He didn’t move. He didn’t speak. He just… waited.

I kept walking. Past him. Past the living room. Past the kitchen. Past every primal instinct that screamed at me to run, to hide, to throw myself out one of the windows and crawl bleeding into the street.

I don’t actually remember the last thirteen minutes.

Shock does that. Your brain gives up on saving everything and just grabs snapshots.

My next clear memory is standing in the middle of the living room, candle in hand, staring at my phone as it turned to 3:32.

The house was vibrating. Not literally. But the air felt charged, like static before a lightning strike. Every corner throbbed with the sense of something pressing up against thin, invisible walls.

Thirty seconds.

Somewhere behind me, boards creaked under a slow, deliberate step.

Twenty.

Breathing. Close enough to fog the back of my neck.

Ten.

A hand, not cold, not hot, just wrong, hovered a centimetre above the top of my head, not touching, but close enough that every hair on my body rose.

Five.

Four.

Three.

Everything stopped.

At 3:33 AM exactly, the pressure dropped.

The candle burned normal yellow again. The boards stopped talking. The EMF meter crackled weakly back to life.

I checked the front door.

The extra drop of blood was gone.

So were the scratches.

The under-stairs door was just wood.

The texts on my phone had vanished.

No unknown number. No log. No screenshots.

The only proof anything had happened was the salt on the floor and the audio file still recording on my collar.

I let myself fall onto the sofa, legs jelly, heart pounding in my ears.

I lived.

I “won.”

The rules said nothing else would happen.

They lied.

Laura found me half-asleep on the sofa at 4:10 AM. She looked… better. Less grey. Less hollow.

“Did it… work?” she asked softly.

I forced a smile. “Nothing your boiler man and a good therapist can’t fix.”

Upstairs, Mia slept for the first time in days. Proper sleep. No lights on.

The frostbite fingers on her neck had faded to faint pink marks by morning.

My report was short and neatly phrased, just like always.

Client’s symptoms consistent with acute stress reaction. Ritual effects explained as a combination of sleep deprivation, expectation, and environmental factors.

I wanted to believe it.

For three nights after that, I convinced myself I did.

Then the knocking started.

It came at 12:00 AM on the dot.

Not at my front door.

On my bedroom wall, right above the headboard.

Twenty-two knocks.

Slow. Measured. Perfectly spaced.

The last one landed exactly as my phone flicked from 11:59 to 12:00.

I lay there, every muscle rigid, counting them in my head.

Twenty.

Twenty-one.

Twenty-two.

The air chilled.

I hadn’t written my name. I hadn’t bled. I hadn’t lit a candle. I hadn’t invited him in.

It didn’t matter.

The rules, you see, were incomplete.

They only tell you how to start the game.

They don’t tell you what happens after you “win.”

He doesn’t stay if you lose. Mia was wrong about that.

He stays if you survive.

You’re his now. A long-term project. A favourite toy.

He doesn’t need paper and blood anymore. He knows exactly who you are.

Every night since then, I feel him.

Not always with knocks. Sometimes it’s a text from a number that doesn’t exist. Sometimes it’s a shadow in the mirror that lags half a second behind me. Sometimes it’s that tiny, almost-imperceptible drop in the room, like a lift shuddering at the bottom.

Sometimes it’s nothing, just weeks of silence, until I start to think, Maybe it really was just stress. Maybe it’s gone. Maybe...

Then he does something small.

Moves my keys.

Leaves my bedroom door half-open when I know I shut it.

Whispers my name from inside the wardrobe when I’m in the shower.

He’s patient. That’s the worst part. He’s not a jump scare. He’s a slow leak in your sanity, drip by drip, over years.

I still debunk other people’s ghosts. I still go on podcasts and talk about EMF spikes and sleep paralysis and why orbs are dust.

I still send neat little reports telling people their monsters aren’t real.

I’m not lying.

Their monsters aren’t.

Mine is.

So here’s my advice, from one sceptic to another.

Don’t play the Midnight Game.

Don’t write your name. Don’t bleed. Don’t knock. Don’t open the door.

But if you’re stubborn like I was, if someone dares you, if you need to know...

Then at least follow my version of the rules. The ones the file didn’t include.

Rule 11: If you “win,” move. New house. New locks. New number. It won’t help for long, but it might buy you time.

Rule 12: Never assume the game is over just because it’s 3:33 AM. That’s just when he stops pretending there are rules.

Rule 13: If you start seeing him in reflections, don’t smash the mirror. He likes when you panic. Just… stop looking. At anything that can hold his shape.

Rule 14: Don’t tell people you’ve seen him. Not in detail. Not exactly. The more specific you are, the more his shape spreads in their heads. He likes new rooms to walk in.

Rule 15: Above all, do not fall in love with being right. That’s how he gets people like us. He doesn’t come for the believers. He comes for the ones who laugh… and then knock anyway.

I used to be a paranormal debunker.

I still am, technically.

But when it’s just me, in the dark, at 11:59 PM, phone face-down and house too quiet, I don’t pretend anymore.

I don’t tell myself it was all stress. Or social media. Or mould.

I just listen to the silence and wait for the first knock.

Some nights, it doesn’t come.

Those are the worst ones.

Because that means he’s [already inside.](https://youtu.be/AfUBZT0sxZk)
