I want to start by saying, I am not in this story. I am a detective and over the years I have come across a lot of stories. What I am about to post now is the best retelling of events I can write. Two years back while going through a storage unit, I found a GoPro. Once I had taken it home to watch, I quickly took it into the station after the first ten minutes. I watched the rest of the video with a few others there and after watching the video we all got to work on trying to uncover what it was about. That is why I am here now, maybe I can get help from someone here.  

So, here is what was on that video. 

 

Time: 0:01 

The video starts with a view of the ground before getting strapped onto the head of our P.O.V. from now on.  

 

Mark: “How does it look?” he asked, looking around at seven people in the woods around a campfire. 

Frank: “You look stupid.” 

Margret: “Frank! Please try your best to be nice.” She waved her hands to get everyone's attention. 

Margret: “Now that we are all settled in, and the fire is going how about we all give our names and why we are here. Mark, how about you go first, and we go right from you.” She sits down looking at Mark to start. 

Mark: “Sure, hi I’m Mark, I’m here to meet new people for the most part and become more social.” He looks to his right, seeing a man who looks to be in his early twenties. Looks to be around 6 feet tall, blonde short hair and muscular. 

Daniel: “Hello everyone, my name is Daniel and I have known Margret for some time now. I like to help her whenever I can, that is why I am here now” Daniel looks around smiling at everyone, as if he were excited to be there. Right of him was a man that also looked to be in his early to mid-twenties, long black hair, about 5’10 feet tall and has a patchy beard. 

Frank: “I’m Frank” he said with his arms crossed looking into the fire. Mark looks at Margret and back to Frank. 

Margret: “Frank...” She said with care. 

Frank: “I’m here to deal with my anger” he sighs while tapping his boot. To his right, a pale woman perhaps younger than Daniel. She looked frail, maybe 5’5 in height and a bit on edge. 

Emma: “I’m Emma...here to move on from the last two years.” She looked at the ground not wanting to make eye contact with anyone. Right of her was a large man. He was bald, had a big beard, maybe taller than Daniel, and a scar running from his left eye down to his neck. 

Frank: “Move on? That's it? I had to say the reason I’m here” he looks around chuckling.  

Margret: “Frank please, don’t push her” 

Daniel: “Yeah dude, be respectful and wait for everyone else to talk” 

Frank: “Of course” he makes a motion to zip his lips. Everyone sighs.  

Jacob: “Hello everyone! I’m Jacob, happy to be here of course. I’ve been off the alcohol for over a year now thanks to Margret, but this is my first time at a camp with a support group.” Everyone claps and Frank scoffs. Right of him is a woman in her mid-forties or so. Short black hair, 5’8 maybe 5’9 and both arms filled with tattoos. 

Mia: “The names Mia, I am here to work on myself, give more and take less” she slightly shakes her head. Finally, the last person. A young man, around the age of Daniel or so, but much shorter. He had to be around 5’6 or so, long messy dark hair and no facial hair. 

Liam: “Hey everyone, I’m Liam Sa-” 

Margret: “No last names! Haha, I know you’re new, but we don’t do last names” 

Liam: “Oh, sorry...I’m Liam, I’m here to you know, get out of the system and shit, look for a job maybe, you know” it seemed like he didn’t really know what the group was there for. 

Margret: “Great! So that is everyone, thank you all again for coming here, I’m sure you will all get something from this that will change your life.” 

 

Mark looks around at everyone and Margret suggests everyone talks to each other for a few minutes. Before anyone gets to any conversations, Mark turns the GoPro off. 

 

Time: 4:23 

The video snaps back on, chatter quietly dies down as Margret stands up. 

Margret: “I’ll be right back!” She walks about ten feet behind from where she was seated to the Van they had come here in.  

Mark: “Anyone got any good scary stories to tell?” He looks around at everyone. 

Daniel: “Yeah, I got a good one. It's about a group of people that go campin-” 

Frank: “Yeah, yeah, we all know how this goes. Let me tell a scary fucking story” Daniel sighs and Frank stands up, looking at everyone.  

Frank begins telling the story as Margret comes back from the Van, with flashlights passing them on to everyone. Daniel moves his chair closer to Margret and Mark, wanting to talk to them while Frank went on with his story.  

Daniel: “It's good to see you in better spirits Margret. I know it’s been a little hard for you after...well, your husband left you.” He says softly and she nods. 

Margret: “Yeah, well let’s not talk about that right now yeah?” Daniel nods. 

Mark, Margret and Daniel start to talk to each other while Frank continues his story. After about Two minutes, Margret gets everyone's attention. 

Frank: “Aw what the hell, I was getting to the best part” 

Margret: “That’s enough now, I want us all to now go on a scavenger hunt. You all have your flashlights and I set up flags not too far from here yesterday. You’ll all be in pairs of two, sorry if you get paired with me haha.”  

Jacob: “I don’t really want to go walking in the woods just when it’s already dark” 

Frank: “Did my story scare you?” 

Jacob: “No, I don’t wanna go looking for flags for who knows how long in the dark.” 

Mai: “I think it sounds fun; I could probably find more than everyone else.” 

Emma: “Yeah...I also don’t want to do this” 

Margret: “Oh, I should have told you all first, that’s on me. But a raise of hands for who does not want to.” Everyone but Mark, Mai and Daniel put their hands up.  

Mark looks around at everyone as chatter starts to turn into arguing. Three minutes of them all discussing the activity, what to do instead and to maybe go to bed in the tents they had set up when they got here. Maybe all of them talking so loudly was the reason they didn’t hear it coming, but I think Mark did as he turned to look behind him a few times and to look in between the others. Then, Frank stops talking as he focuses on behind Margret. The rest of the group slowly hear it too and sees what Frank does.  

Walking from behind Margret was five people dressed in suits and wore blank white plastic masks. The masks looked cheap, but the suits looked extremely expensive, black with red stripes on the sleeves. Everyone fell silent as Margret turned around to see the five people walk closer to her, passing her car. Now only a few feet away from Margret, can the shapes of the five be fully seen. The one in the middle, tall and imposing, wore his suit jacket around his waist wearing a white tank top, his arms muscular and full of scars. The other four were about 6 feet tall, looking heads and shoulders smaller than the man in the middle. 

Time 10:12 

Frank: “What the fuck do you all want huh?” Mark looks at Frank and at the others, I’m sure many thoughts are going through his head. Margret turns to the group and back to the five men. 

“Lives” said the tall man in a deep muffled voice before taking a machete from behind him and in one quick, swift swing. Margret falls to the ground with her head flying from her body. Her head rolls to the firepit, slowly catching on fire as her body goes limp. A silent horror falls on everyone as they look at each other in disbelief. The masked men don't move at all, just looking. 

Frank: “FUCK! Everyone, run with me!” he screams. Mark snaps his head around to see Frank running away from everyone else as they start to follow right behind him. 

Mark takes a few looks back as he runs to catch up with the others back at the five men, they remain in the same position, not moving at all. Frank, Daniel and Mai are the fastest as everyone is now reaching them, with Jacob only catching up after everyone else is already talking about what has just happened. 

Time 12:45 

Frank: “What the fuck!” 

Daniel: “Just calm down, we must make a plan.” 

Mai: “Yeah, keep running in this direction!” she points off into the wood as Mark catches his breath. The camera looks at the ground as Jacob can be heard panting heavily. 

Emma: “And what is that way, huh?” 

Frank: “The way that’s away from those fucks!” He nods at Mai. 

Mai: “We have to keep going while we have this much distance on them” 

Daniel: “No, there are others here that need help” He walks over to Liam, Jacob and Emma. Mark looks at Frank and Mai. 

Mark: “Yeah...we can’t just leave them” catching his breath and standing upright. 

Mai: “I am not dying because of some out-of-shape fucks. You with me Frank?” 

Frank looks at Mai and back to the group.  

Frank: “I fucking hate that I'm about to say this, but we are better with the numbers.” 

Mai says nothing as she runs into the woods with the flashlight she has until she cannot be seen anymore.  

Mark: “From what I was able to see, they aren't following yet or at least I didn't see them move when we took off.”  

Daniel: “Okay, from now on, only one flashlight on at a time and we follow me. Can you three walk?” He does his best to get Jacob, Liam, and Emma ready to go. 

Frank: “No, we follow me, I’m not taking orders from a goody-goody." 

Daniel: “We do not have the time to argue this. Who wants to follow me?” Everyone raises their hands but Frank. 

Daniel: “See, I’m leading”  

Liam: “Just wait! Hold on, this isn't adding up you know” He stands up and starts pacing. 

Daniel: “Look, we can talk about this late-” 

Liam: “Noo, this is a set-up, it has to be. Margret said something like, this will change our life? And wanted us all to go in groups of two into the woods minutes before those crazy people showed up? Right?” Everyone looks at each other. 

Daniel: “I will not tolerate any slander on Margret's name.” 

Liam: “Yeah, you wouldn't right? I overheard you talking about her husband leaving her, why did he do that?” 

Emma: “Wait what?” 

Jacob: “I’m good to go now, we should leave.” 

Frank: “No, no not yet” Frank steps in front of Daniel. “So? Liam is bringing up some interesting points wouldn't you say?” 

Mark: “I gotta say, it does sound weird when it’s put like that.” 

Daniel: “No! What does that even mean? She got her head chopped off, what’s the plan?” 

Liam: “Suicide and wanted us all dead” 

Daniel: “Why? Why would she want us dead, I’ve known her for years and she wouldn't do something that messed up”  

Liam: “Explain her weird ass words and the timing” the sound of steps can be heard in the distance. 

Jacob: “Wait! You hear that?” He moves his flashlight towards Mark. 

Frank: “Dude, come here!” Mark rushes over to them and turns his body to see the five men walking towards the group from about 20 feet away. The sounds of footsteps on sticks quiet the group. 

Mark looks at the group and waves his hands to get the others to start running. Making sure no one is left behind and the five men keep walking slowing. The group stops for a moment to catch their breath. 

Time 17:28 

A loud clap can be heard where the five men are following the sounds of sprinting. Quick stomps can now be heard in five different directions than dead silence.  

Frank: “They are fucking with us...” 

Daniel: “And they split up” He runs his hands through his hair. 

Frank: “Dude, is that GoPro thing still on? How have you not tossed that thing” 

Mike: “Right...I forgot about it” 

Daniel: “Keep it on, it might be able to get one of their faces...or at least capture what happens to us.” 

Liam: “Why do you have that thing anyway?” 

Mark: “Oh shit...” 

Everyone looks at Mark at once, I’m sure thinking he is seeing one of the men. 

Mark: “Margret and I had a talk before we came out...she wanted me to bring the GoPro to capture the trip and make a little film over the two days.” Frank and Liam stare at Daniel. 

Emma: “What the hell. Oh fuck, Liam is right, isn't he? Daniel say something!” He is just staring into the distance. 

Liam throws his arms into the air and walks around the group when loud metallic chomp can be heard followed by the screams of Liam. The others rush to him and see he has gotten himself caught by a beartrap. 

Liam: “FUCK! Get this fucking thing off me!” Everyone tries to pull the trap open but with no success. 

Daniel: “Come on everyon-” 

Emma: “SHIT!” She lets go of the trap and falls backward. Mark looks at her, at the trap and back to her. She kicks her legs around trying to get to her feet as everyone looks at her. 

Jacob: “Yo-” Steps can be heard from behind them and as Mark looks behind Jacob, one of the men dashes in with a knife and slashes at Jacob. He had put his arm up in time to protect his face from the knife. Daniel and Frank both let go of the trap to tackle the man when another man dashes in to dig his knife into Daniel's left leg. Mark watches as Liam is stuck in the trap, Jacob is now bleeding from his arm and his attacker now moving towards Frank while Daniel pushers the man off him but doesn't pull the knife out. 

Daniel: “Mark!” The man that got pushed off Daniel gets up and starts slowing backing up into the woods as the other man swings his knife at Frank. Mark and Daniel rush at the knife-swinging maniac, Daniel pushes Frank out of the way and tackles the man to the ground. Jacob now coming tohad help with Mark to attack the man on the ground. 

Daniel: “He is stabbing me! Grab him!” Frank rushes in to help the other two in the attack, the three grab the man’s arms and get the knife away from him while also stomping on him. 

Daniel: “Don’t kill him, just hold onto him” He stands up and holds his side. Blood turning his right hand red. The three hold the man down as Frank grabs the knife that was at the man's side and starts to stab into his neck. 

Daniel: “No!” He coughs as Mark and Jacob both move away, and Frank keeps stabbing his neck. 

Frank: “Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!” Mark watches Frank hack away at his neck before his head is completely severed, still wearing that plastic mask. 

Liam: “Can you get me out!” Daniel and Mark both turn to Liam screaming for help. 

Mark: “Fuck...this is so bad.” Daniel looks at the knife in his leg. 

Daniel: “That’s not good.” 

Frank: “Shit, is it deep?” Daniel turns to Frank and shrugs his shoulders.  

Jacob: “Look dude, we couldn't get him out before...” Frank and Daniel both turn their heads to see if they can find the other man that attacked them. 

Mark: “Looks like the other guy took off” 

Liam: “HEY! This fucking trap!” He cries out in pain when footsteps are heard running at them. Mark turns around to see Emma. 

Frank: “Thanks for the fucking help” 

Emma: “They could have fucking killed me...” 

Frank: “Yeah, no shit! we could have died, if you run away again don't you dare think of coming back” Frank rips up some of his shirt to give to Daniel to stop the bleeding from his side. 

Mark: “Wait a second, take his mask off and I’ll get it on the GoPro” Frank picks the man's head up and removes the mask. What’s picked up on the video is shocking to say the least. The man's face looked like the skin on his face has been skinned off slowly over a few months. Giving his face an almost burnt-like look, a shade of light reddish brown. No hair anywhere on his face, nothing to identify. 

Frank: “What the hell. People don’t just look like that.” 

Mark: “Why not? If you passed him on the street, he would just look like someone that has been in an accident.” Daniel looks at the face with concern. 

Daniel: “In him was life, and that life was the darkness in mankind.” Daniel closes his eyes for a moment.  

Emma: “Can we leave now.” 

Liam: “Not without me you aren't!” 

Time 25:39 

With a lot of effort, they free Liam’s leg and Frank carries him. With the knife now out of Daniel’s leg and pieces of shirt wrapped around to slow the bleeding. Footsteps can be heard all around them, but nothing is done in this time. 

Jacob: “They are just letting us walk to mess with our heads.” 

Frank: “Yeah, these sick fucks must be enjoying it. How you holding up Daniel?” 

Daniel: “Yeah, I’m good” Mark looks around and hears sounds, steps and sticks breaking. 

Emma: “There is not a chance they let us leave right?” 

Mark: “Well we got one of them, maybe we can fight them off.” 

Jacob: “At least only two of them jumped us, right? and one ran off for some reason.” 

Emma: “Yeah...” 

Frank: “So, tell us about your past Emma, before we all die haha.” 

Emma: “You are annoying...But I was an escort.” 

Frank: “Your prices cheap?” 

Emma: “Too expensive for you.” Everyone laughs. 

Daniel: “Hey Liam, you still with us?” 

Frank: “Liam?” They all stop for a moment to make sure he is still breathing. 

Frank: “Shit, he passed out.” Frank puts him down against a tree. 

Frank: “My fucking arm is killing me” With no sound as a warning, an arrow pins Liam’s head to the tree he is resting on. Everyone starts to look around to see where that arrow came from. Mark points his flashlight at one of the men holding a small Bow. 

Mark: “Shit! Look at that fucker just standing there. Come here you piece of shit!” 

Daniel: “Mark stop, we got to just keep moving.” The man takes aim and shots another arrow into Liam’s head. 

Emma: “He is playing with us...” She runs to Frank and Daniel. 

Jacob: “We have to leave now.” 

Mark: “Damn it!” Mark follows behind them as they walk a bit faster. They walk until they come across a steep hill. 

Frank: “God I hate these woods.” Before they start to walk up the hill, one of the men are only a few feet away from them to the left. He is holding a large knife and watching the group. 

Frank: “Come on! I killed one of you already.” He holds the knife up. Mark gets close to Frank as they are both in front of Emma, Jacob and Daniel now. Fast steps can be heard from behind the man coming down the hill. 

Emma: “You guys hear someth-” 

Mia: “AHHH!” Mia comes rushing behind the man with a rock flying down the hill. He turned to her just to see how he was going to die. Her body slams into his, pushing him violently to the ground. 

“What!” Said the whole group as they now watch Mia slam the rock into the man’s mask, breaking it and caving his face into a brutal mess. She grunts and doesn't stop for a full minute. 

Frank: “Hey the dude is dead also where the fuck did you come from?” 

Mia: “Up from the hill” She points from behind her. “I’ve been keeping close but far from those masked weirdo’s” 

Daniel: “What, why? You could have helped us earlier.” The group look at each other and at Mia as she starts to walk up the hill. 

Mia: “We should get going up here.”   
Frank: “Answer Daniel, you have been close and not helping until now?” They all start to follow her up the hill. 

Mia: “Yes...I’m looking out for myself, not taking any chances” 

Frank: “That’s so fucked up, but I understand.” 

Time 39:23 

Frank: “That hill sucked.” They get to the top and rest for a moment. 

Daniel: “Oh come on. Everyone look...” He points down the hill. The three remaining men are at the bottom of the hill, looking up to the group. 

Frank: “Look at that big cunt.” He spits. Mark falls to the ground and just sits there looking at others. Jacob catches his breath and stands near Mia. 

Mia: “Yeah, just keep an eye on them. We'll make a run for it if they start walking up here.” Emma walks to Mia. 

Mark: “So Daniel...have you put more thought into what Liam said?” 

Daniel: “Yeah...” 

Frank: “And?” Daniel takes a deep breath and sighs. 

Daniel: “I don’t think she has anything to do with this. I can’t see her doing something this horrible.” 

Mark: “Okay, I guess it doesn't matter right now anyway. But can you tell us about what happened with her husband?” 

Daniel: “Sure. He left her for her younger sister. She is a successful doctor, attractive and smart. Margret has always had something against her sister, thinking she had it easier. That doesn't mean she would do anything like this to people she is trying to help.” 

Frank: “Maybe she needed help.” There’s a moment of silence. 

Frank: “Anyway...looks like they aren't moving for as long as we are looking at them. Another game, I’m sure.” 

Daniel: “Most likely. I just keep thinking if I could have helped a little more.  

Frank: “Dude there’s nothing else we could have done. It’s just fucked, that’s all.” 

Daniel: “Well maybe we should have all attacked them the moment they arrived. Better chance of killing them maybe. There is no way we can take them all on now with how we are.” 

Frank: “Killing them? You sound different from before.” 

Daniel: “They are monsters...”  

Frank: “Worse, they are man.” 

Daniel: “Frank, I hope you can move from your anger. God will forgive you.” Frank said nothing and just looked at Daniel. 

Frank: “So... think there’s an afterlife?” 

Daniel: “Yeah.” 

Frank: “I hope so...” Frank sighed and grabbed Daniel, pushing him. 

Daniel: “What are you doing!”  

Frank: “Everyone run!” Frank jumps down the hill towards the men. Mark stands up and looks at the girls and back to Daniel. 

Mark: “Shit! He just took off.” 

Daniel: “We gotta go, he is giving us time!” Mark helps Daniel move as fast as he can. Emma and Mia ran but not too far ahead. 

Jacob: “Shit, I can’t keep running.” Jacob can barely run at this point. 

Daniel: “Mark, go help Jacob...I’ll be fine.” Mark nods and runs to Jacob to help. 

Mark: “I got you man, but we gotta move as fast as you can.” Mark puts an arm around Jacob. 

Jacob: “I’m so sorry.” He says while panting heavily.   

Emma and Mia are far ahead of the group, Mark helping Jacob and Daniel being close to them. The woods are dark and thick with trees, the sounds of bugs and animals can be heard faintly.  

Time 48:21 

Mia: “Hurry up!” She shouts at the three that are now far behind. 

Mark: “They are gonna leave us at this rate.” 

Jacob: “You and Daniel really should leave me.” 

Daniel: “Not happening” He moves closer to them. 

Jacob: “I’m slowing you guys down. The girls are so far, and we shouldn't be split up like this.” He moves Mark’s arm and gives him a little push. 

Mark: “We still aren't leaving you.” They start to jog a little. Emma and Mia come back to the group.  

Mia: “If you wanna live, maybe run faster.” 

Emma: “We can’t let them catch up to us or find out where we are.” 

Jacob: “Maybe we should all split up and run in a different direction to the others?”  

Emma: “That’s not a bad idea.” 

Daniel: “No, we just need to keep, AH!” He falls to the ground and grabs his leg. 

Mark: “Shit, dude you’ve lost a lot of blood.” 

Daniel: “I’m good.” He stands back up and grunts. 

Mark: “Mia can you help please?” 

Mia: “No.” Emma sighs and walks to Daniel, helping him move. 

Daniel: “Thank you Emma...” They start moving again. 

Mark: “Hey Jacob, if it’s okay to ask but how did you get that scar?”  

Jacob: “Well, I got it in a car accident. One night coming home from drinking, a lot.” He puts his finger on his eye and runs it down to his neck. “Got this, survived and stop drinking from that day on.”  

Mark: “What about you Mia? Got anything you wanna get off your mind?” She turns her head to Mark and back. 

Jacob: “Guess not haha.” Daniel sighs and whispers something to Emma but it can't be heard. Emma leaves Daniel and steps quickly towards Mia. 

Jacob: “We still can split up. Make it hard for those crazy people.” 

Daniel: “It seems like they know these woods. I don’t think it would really do anything.” 

Mark: “Yeah, they are probably not too far behind us.” 

Jacob: “Or maybe Frank killed them all for us.” Daniel stops for a second but keeps walking. 

Daniel: “He didn't have to do that, but I hope he managed to get away from them.” 

Jacob: “Yeah I would have liked to hear the rest of that scary story.” The three share a quiet laugh. Mark turns his head, to the left to see nothing and to the right. He stops and Jacob looks at him. 

Daniel: “You two?” He stops and turns to Mark. 

Mark: “There...” He points into the woods and a white mask can be seen. Mark turns his flashlight on and sure enough, the man with the Bow can be seen about twenty feet away or so. 

Jacob: “Oh fuck off...” 

Daniel: “I guess they have been following us this whole time.” He takes a deep breath and sighs. The two girls now come walking back to the group. 

Mia: “You guys wanna stop every two damn seconds.” 

Emma: “Yeah come on-” They both look in the same direction. 

Mia: “Shit. Well, are we just going to keep looking at him or what?”  

Mark: “Wait, if there’s one there.” Mark starts to look around and the other very tall man can be seen from about 20 feet behind them.  

Mark: “Well that’s two...” Mark turns to both masked men one at a time. 

Daniel: “They aren't moving, but shouldn't there be a third?” 

Mia: “Frank might have got one of them.” 

Jacob: “Or he got away, and he is getting followed by the third one.” 

Mark: “Enough running.” 

Mia: “Are you serious?” 

Mark: “With only two left, yeah.” 

Daniel: “I’m still bleeding out so I don’t know how much I can help.” He coughs. 

Jacob: “Yeah I’m in!” Emma quietly gets close to Mia. 

Mark: “Come here!” Mark waves his hands at the two masked men. The one with the Bow starts to walk over to the group. 

Mark: “Get ready everyone.” The group moves closely together. The man now about six or seven feet away. He tosses his Bow and one arrow to the group. Mark dashes to the Bow and arrow, picking them up and taking aim. 

Mark releases the arrow and doesn't come close to hitting the man. Everyone yells at him. 

Mark: “Damn!” The man reaches his hand out as if Mark would nicely place it but in his hand. Mark tosses it back to him. As the group backs up a little, the other masked man can no longer be seen. 

Mia: “If he comes any closer, we jump him and follow me.”  The man puts his left arm behind his back then in front of his face and repeats this motion two more times. He shrugs and puts the Bow around his torso and pulls a Knife from his back.  

Jacob: “Let’s just rush him now.” He turns to mark. 

Mia: “Fuck it!” She runs to the man followed by mark and Jacob behind him. The sound of someone behind them falling over can be heard. 

Emma: “I got you Daniel.” 

Mark is in front of the man, Jacob on his left and Mia on his right. He swings his knife left and right as he takes steps towards Mark. Jacob moves in and gets his right arm cut. 

Jacob: “Shit!” Jacob wraps his arms around the man’s waist. Mia and Mark rush in as Mark tries to grab the hand with the knife but a few stabs quickly hit Jacobs back. They push him and get him to the ground with Jacob now on top of him. Grunts from the man can be heard as he gets a few more stabs into Jacob.  

Mark: “I got his arm!” Mark holds the arm with the knife as Mia starts punching the man's face. Jacob starts bleeding from his neck onto the man. His left arm grabs Jacob’s face, the GoPro can’t pick it up but Jacob yells in pain and covers his face with his hands. The man thrashes around and with Jacob falling towards Mia, she moves for only seconds, but he gets free.  

He overpowers Mark and gets on top of him, the GoPro now looking up to the man as he raisers his hand up and just before he can slam it down. Daniel tackles the man. Emma helps Mark up and they see the struggle between Daniel and the man. Mia gets to them before Mark, helping get the knife off him as Mia starts to stab the man. Daniel stumbles off the man as Mia stabs away at his neck, face and torso. He grunts as he gets stabbed and soft moans can be heard. 

Mia: “Let’s see what he has on him.” She pants as she looks in the pockets of his jacket and pants. 

Mark: “Daniel thank you...” Mark helps him up as he coughs. Daniel nods and Mark looks at Mia as she pulls a wallet from his jacket pocket.  

Mia: “What...” She throws money from the wallet and it’s just monopoly money. She empties the wallet and nothing else is in it. 

Mark: “That’s just...I don’t even know what to say to that.” Mia looks at Mark and over to Jacob. Sounds of flesh can be heard getting hacked at. Mark turns around and so do the others. 

“NO!” Yells Mark and Daniel. The tall man chopping into his lifeless body with the machete. 

The tall man is now looking at the group. Breathing heavily over Jacob’s body, he takes one step towards the group and Mark flinches. The tall man pulls his arm back and throws the machete. The sound of it hitting something can be heard. Mark turns around to see Emma with the machete in her head and her body twitching on the ground.  

Mia runs towards him with knife in hand. The tall man grabs Mia and with one hand around her neck, he lifts her up from the ground. She swings the knife, cutting his arm and chest before he grabs her hand with the knife. Daniel rushes over but he is kicked in the chest and falls to the ground. He rolls on the ground and moans faintly. 

Mark: “Shit! No this is so bad.” Mark runs to Daniel and gets him up on his feet. The GoPro now seeing the tall man up-close. He looks down at Mark as Mia can be heard gasping for air and kicking around.  

Mark: “I’m so sorry Mia.” Getting Daniel up and helping him move. 

Daniel: “We...can’t leave...her.” He coughs. Mark takes a few looks back to the tall man just watching them leave. Tank top now having blood on it and Mia dead at his feet. 

Time 55:10 

Daniel: “Mark...stop, just stop.” 

Mark: “No we gotta keep going, we can’t stop.” Daniel trips over and Mark quickly tries to pick him up. 

Daniel: “I’ve lost too much blood...” 

Mark: “You can keep going, I know it.” 

Daniel: “No...” He gets up. “You run...and you don’t turn back.” He points behind Mark. 

Mark: “I-” Daniel pushes Mark lightly.  

Daniel: “Get out of here...” Mark backs up and footsteps can be heard deep in the woods. 

Mark: “I’ll make sure I get out of here.”
