It was advertised as a summer camp for young adults aged 18-25. 

*“Come and relive your childhood!”*

To my knowledge, the camp closed down in 2022, every trace of it wiped from existence. All I have left is my own makeshift list of rules to survive.

**1). Do NOT trust Gabby Hastings.**

**2). The daily campfire isn't the danger. The danger is not believing the ghost stories.**

**3). The Yellow Cabin will either break you or make you. Make sure it breaks you.**

**4). The empath sitting next to you is not your friend. Avoid empath’s at all costs. Especially if he calls himself a singer.**

**5). Tearing off your bandaids WILL result in death. Do not do this.**

**6). Murder is legal at Camp Hemlock. Kill ALL ‘camp counsellors’ no matter what.**

**7). Delusion is your enemy. Stay away from Gabby Hastings. Protect Gabby Hastings.**

**8). The dead will come back to life. Enjoy your new bunkmate.**

**9). The words, “Snap out of it!” will mean a lot. Hold onto these words.**

**10). Inexplicable abilities are guaranteed by the end of summer. Survival is not. Follow the rules, and you might get out alive.**

After seven years, each page of this rulebook is still stained with our blood. 

I bought the notebook because I thought it was cute, so I could record memories. 

But the cartoon giraffes on the back cover have their eyes scribbled out.

I scratched their eyes out at my worst, and doodled  legs on them at my best. 

I know the mess on page three is Jude, because he specifically told me I wasn't *allowed* the notebook. I remember my campmate was still bleeding from partaking in the latest ‘camp activities.’

On page one, I began writing. 

*June 1st, 2018.*

*Mom, can you come get me? I don't want to be here anymore. I know I'm technically 21. I even told you I was an adult, and you don't have to worry about me anymore. But I’m scared. The gates are shut and the guards are scary. I know I said I wanted to go to camp, but I didn't mean it. All of my friends are gone, Mom. 

*Mateo, Sam, Nick, and Rue. I can't find them anymore. Their cabins are empty. Can you come pick me up? I’m so fucking scared, Mom, I think I'm going to die. I can't do this—*

There are three single blots of bright red smearing my handwriting which was a barely cohesive mess, my brain scrambled and foggy after our camper induction. Jude Topaz was a med student on leave, after witnessing a traumatic death during surgery. 

Jude’s therapist led him to Camp Hemlock, promising him *relief from mental trauma, and a chance to make like-minded friends!* I met him on the bus ride, charmed by his handsome smile and ponytail only a guy like him could pull off. He spent the entire time listing all of the medication he was on. 

Upon arrival at the camp, however, Jude had been dragged away. 

I hadn't seen him for days, scribbling in my notebook every night. 

*Where is he??? Why isn't he back yet????*

Jude snuck into my cabin after curfew four days later, immediately trying to snatch my notebook. If one of us broke the camp rules, all of us were punished. 

“You're not supposed to have that.”

His voice came from behind me. 

Camp Hemlock’s number 1 rule was to *never* question the initial side effects from introductory camp activities. But I found it hard to keep my mouth shut. 

Especially when Jude was bleeding all over my notebook, leaning over my shoulder. 

“Oh, shit, sorry.”

I watched one single drop of red hit the page. 

Then another. 

And another. 

I twisted around, my heart diving into my throat. Jude shushed me with his index finger, gesturing to the guard situated outside my cabin door. I had no idea how he'd managed to slip inside. 

“Avert your eyes.” Jude grumbled, trying to gingerly cover up the horror show that was his face. 

*Unrecognisable* is the word I'd use to describe my friend at that moment. 

Somehow, he looked younger in the eyes, a large chunk of his hair sheared away. 

The man’s eyes were half lidded, yellowing bruises shadowing his cheeks. I pretended not to see the blood splatters staining the collar of his camper shirt, a single streak of scarlet down the front. 

Jude was trying to (unsuccessfully) hide the band-aid stuck to his left temple, where a tiny hole had been drilled directly into his skull. 

I remember the feeling of wanting to be violently sick everywhere, my blood running freezing cold and then piping hot, poison in my veins. In the shadow, my friend still looked like *my friend*.

But when he stepped into the light, I could see something inside him had been contorted. I pretended not to see a lot of things for the sake of my sanity. 

The visible burn marks on his wrists,  indentations in his flesh from the straps that held him down. Jude pressed both hands over the band-aid, pressing pressure on the wound. “You're catching flies. It doesn't look that bad.”

“Right.” I lied, trying to maintain a smile. “It… doesn't look bad.” 

He shot me a sickly grin. “I've trained with patients in a worse state. Trust me.”

“Did you drill into your patients heads?” I asked dazedly. 

Jude’s eyes darkened. “Unsurprisingly, no,” he said, “I'm not a psychopath.” he shrugged, “I'm also not qualified for that sort of thing. I'm barely a trainee.”

“And… how old are you again?”

Jude’s bottom lip trembled slightly. “Twenty.” 

That night, I wrote in my notebook again. I can still see the smudge marks where I tried to clean Jude’s blood from the pages. 

*The Yellow Cabin is experimenting on the campers. Jude said he's okay, but he has a HOLE IN HIS HEAD!*

Page six is my first breakdown, before eight blank pages where I spent a week taking part in my *first* camp activity. 

I don't remember a lot. 

All I wrote was: *“It hurts. I couldn't move. Sticky things on my head. Bright lights. I think I had a kind of surgery.*

Then, further down the page: 

*”Why didn't they drill into my skull?”*

I told my bunkmates to write entries while I was gone, but when I got back from camp activities, they were dead, lying limp in their bunks. Jessie's eyes were still open, her blood wet, pooling down her chin. Nin was curled into a ball. 

I didn't go near her. 

When I stepped closer to the girl’s bunk, a pinkish froth was bubbling on her pillow, her body violently contorting. 

I had no idea how they died. I left for camp activities in the Yellow Cabin on June 4th, with the entry, “God, help me.” and returned on the 12th, commenting, “I'm the only one left in Bunk 12. Jessie and Nin are gone.”

The following page is the very first rule I scribbled down on June 18th, 2018.

**Rule 1). Do NOT trust Gabby Hastings. 

After my cabin was cleaned out, I was woken by guards dragging in my new bunkmate. I could only see her shadow, and when she moved further into the light, her hands were tied behind her back, what looked like a dog muzzle covering her nose and mouth. 

Her clothes, a short sleeved white shirt and shorts, were too clean. The girl was shoved into the bunk below me, and when I risked a peek, hanging upside down from the top bunk, I caught her legs curling into a ball, a halo of dark curls on her pillow. When I looked closer, a scary bald spot where half of her hair had been cruelly sheared away. 

Her  name was Gabby, and *Gabby* wore a content smile, despite the bandages wrapped around her head, dried blood crusted under her nose, and her trembling arms wrapped around herself. 

I didn't fully understand Gabby Hastings until it was too late. 

The next morning, I woke to my new bunkmate shaking me like it was  Christmas morning. The sun was shining through gaps in the window.

Jessie was cross legged on the floor, brushing through her red curls, Nin still snoozing, one leg hanging off of her bed. 

The new girl was standing inches away, choking me with toothpaste breath, her smile *way* too big for… I glanced at the clock on the wall. 

8:07am.

“Hey, Bunkie!”

Gabby’s southern accent was kind of cute, even if her obsession with shortening words was a little on the annoying side. Gabby Hastings was the youngest out of all of us, barely eighteen, after lying about her age to get into a ‘more mature’ summer camp. 

This girl was textbook golden retriever energy, bouncing up and down on the spot in front of my bed, already sporting a fresh, *Camp Hemlock 2018” shirt. 

Since joining late, my new bunkmate couldn't wait to start engaging in camp activities. The girl had already dragged me (unwillingly) to kayaking, where we both toppled out of the boat and almost drowned. Gabby would not stop talking about that night’s scheduled campfire, since she missed the last three. She leaned closer, her hair tickling my face. 

Which was weird, because now I was squinting my eyes, her hair was in pigtails. 

*So, what was it that was tickling my face?*

“Too close.” I managed to get out in a sleepy yawn. 

“Are you coming for breakfast?” Gabby asked, prodding me in the forehead. “They're serving chocolate oatmeal!”

“*Cold* oatmeal.” Jessie corrected from her bunk.

“It's still oatmeal,” Nin mumbled into her pillows, “Just add some sugar.”

Jessie rocketed a pillow at the girl’s head. “You’re not even out of bed.”

“It's cold.”

“It's almost 90!” 

Jessie and Nin were a strange blend. 

Jessie was a new mother escaping her baby twins for a summer dedicated to herself. She was also the girliest girl I had ever met, and I had met a *lot* of girly girls. Jessie treated her precious silky red ponytail like a third child. 

Nin, a college dropout and aspiring author, was the polar opposite, hiding behind thick black curls and panda eyes. 

Somehow, the two of them worked. 

In the corner of my eye, a butterfly danced across the ceiling. I dazedly followed its path. The butterfly's wings were a whole new shade of blue. I could hear laughter outside, sunlight seeping through the crack in the door.

Sitting up, I stretched, and settled my bunkmate with a wry smile. “How are you so energetic?”

Gabby shot me a grin, dragging me out of my bunk. “Sunlight is your best friend, y’know! My mama always said, "as long as you have a face full of sunlight, you can get through any day!”

She was right. When the two of us stepped out of our cabin, the sun was bearing down on me, bathing me in a warm glow. Gabby tugged me across the campgrounds, her ponytail swaying from side to side. There were kids already setting up a game of Capture the Flag. 

I glimpsed an older guy  maybe in his mid twenties with blondish brown hair, sprinting toward the forest, stumbling over himself. 

The first colour I saw was bright red, running in thick beads down his face. It was *too* bright. Too real. And for a second, I could sense that very same colour staining my own skin, stuck in my nails and matted in my ponytail. 

The world around me blurred, and I could feel my breath quickening, my chest aching. His eyes were wild, terrified. Slamming his hand over his mouth and nose, the guy leapt over the smouldering campfire. The guy was fast, his shoes slamming into the trail.

“Libby?” 

Gabby’s voice directed me to another butterfly balancing on a leaf. 

She tipped her head back, smiling at the sky. 

“Isn't it a beautiful day?”

I could hear his staggered breaths, wheezing for air. When I twisted around, following his shadow through the trees, Gabby pulled me forwards. 

“I hope the oatmeal isn't too cold!” She  said, laughing.

The sudden gunshot stiffened my bones, chills creeping down my spine. 

I heard the guy's body hit the ground with a meaty smack. 

Gabby stopped abruptly, following my gaze. 

“Oh, no,” she pulled a face, “Did he just fall? I hope he's okay!”

I nodded dazedly, turning back to my friend. “Yeah,” I heard myself say, ignoring the guy’s screams. “I hope he's okay.”

Inside the breakfast cabin, I joined the long winding queue for lukewarm oatmeal and orange juice. I was reaching for the last piece of limp-looking bacon when someone else scooped it up first. 

I glanced up, and something slimy squirming up my throat. It was the guy who was running. 

This time though, he didn't look scared or out of breath. 

His camp uniform was too clean, too perfect, sculpted to his body, light brown hair sticking from a baseball cap. 

“Sorry.” He stuffed the bacon in his mouth, grinning through bacon mush. 

“Mine now.”

The guy introduced himself as Nico. He was 23, a chemistry student, and the main vocalist of a band I had never heard of. Gabby was smitten with him, inviting him to come sit with us. I had to keep reminding her that Nico was *seven* years older than her. Though he was quick to shoot down her dreams. 

“I'm more interested in guys.”

Scooping up soggy oatmeal, Nico introduced himself as an eighteen year old chemistry student, and the lead vocalist in a band I had never heard of. 

Something snapped in my mind, and I was suddenly half aware that I wasn't eating oatmeal. The consistency was wet and fleshy in my mouth, a metallic taste sticking to my tongue. I had to force myself to swallow, but the immediate panic that filled me, wrenching my gut, was quickly soothed. 

“Didn't you say you were twenty three?” I said, gulping down slime. 

Nico chuckled. “Uh, nope. I just left high school, like three months ago.”

Gabby’s eyes lit up, and I ignored bugs skittering down my spine. “So did I!” 

“Libby, what the *fuck* are you doing?”

It was like being hit with ice cold water, and yet somehow, I still couldn't see properly.

Lifting my head, Jude was standing over me, his expression frenzied. The colour red was present again, this time staining his chin. When I told him to join us, he didn't move, stiffening up. 

I gestured for him to take the seat next to mine, and he surprised me with a splutter. “Are you fucking serious?”

“Relax,” Nico said, inhaling rubbery eggs, “Sit down, man. Have some breakfast.”

Jude took a step back. 

His hands were shaking. 

Gabby started talking, her voice drowning out Jude’s manic hissing. 

“Libby!”

Jude’s eyes followed me all day. He was there during camp activities, his pleading voice in the back of my mind. 

*“Libby, can you hear me?”*

It was during the campfire, did things start to grow clearer. 

There were seven of us gathered around flickering flame, Gabby in the centre, happily chewing on a hot dog bun. 

Nico was opposite me, Jessie snuggled into Nin. We made snores, exchanging ghost stories. I was having so much fun, I barely noticed Jude stomp over, slumping down in front of the fire. 

His eyes found mine. 

I ignored his panicked tone. 

“Can *I* tell a story, please?”

Gabby nodded with a smile, gesturing for him to take centre stage. Over her shoulder, the sun was setting over the horizon, the sky smeared in pastel colours. “Of  course! Tell us a story!”

Jude Topaz nodded, but instead of speaking, strode over to Gabby, slapping her across the face. “Snap out of it!” 

Gabby staggered back, her eyes wide.

And above me, that beautiful blur of color in the sky blinked out of existence. 

It was pitch black. 

Raining. 

I could feel it running down my face, glueing my hair to the back of my neck. 

Jude slapped the girl again, *harder*, and she dropped onto her knees. 

With her, my world started to crumble at the seams. 

The downpour was soaking me, and yet I barely felt it. 

“Wake up!” Jude snapped. “If you don't, you're going to fucking die!”

Gabby’s wail collapsed into a screech, a gnawing parasite drilling into my skull

The girl slammed her hands over her ears, shaking her head.

“No,” she shrieked, her eyes wide with childlike fright. “No, no, no, no, no!”

I waited for the sun to come back, but I was covered in filth, blood staining my face. The sun didn't exist at Camp Hemlock. For a disorienting moment, I was frozen, before the world snapped back into place when Gabby let out an ear piercing shriek which hit like a physical wave, unravelling me completely.

Blinking back rain filling my eyes, all of that suppressed panic was back, squeezing my chest.

Several guards around us dropped to their knees, a splurge of red exploding from their mouths. Jude’s voice hit me in clarity. The guy was behind me, on his knees in dirt, his arms held up in surrender. I don't think his eyes were supposed to be that color, the same shade that was painting his camper shirt, like his eyes were bleeding, a fresh bandage wrapped around his head.

He was shoved into the dirt, face-first. Gabby’s scream was affecting him, just like the guards. Jude’s cry shattered the splinters of illusion still clinging on. The man was rolling around in the dirt, blood pooling through his fingers clamped over his ears. His body jolted, and he heaved up lumps of bloody red. 

“Are you *trying* to get yourselves fucking killed?”

Gabby was hysterical, staggering back, her eyes half lidded. 

I watched a masked guard stiffen up, scarlet splattering across their visor. 

When the guard hit the dirt, other campers, or *’campers’* erupted into panic. 

“We’ve got a C6.” One of the surviving guards said calmly into his talkie. “I repeat, we have a C6 loose. I need backup right now. The C6 is confirmed to influence another subject, a C5. However, the C2 appeared unaffected.”

The real world was cruel. I wasn't surprised Gabby was living her own delusion. I watched an older redhead get her brains blown out for not following instructions. When a guard grabbed me, forcing me to my stomach, I craved her illusions hitting me again. 

*Guards*. 

I forgot there were guards. 

I was a prisoner, not a camper. 

Jessie and Nin were dead, and Nico’s body was still lying in the dirt. 

In Gabby’s head, however, we were all at a real summer camp.

Gabby was pulled to her feet by a female guard. 

The woman was dead in a single second, her brains leaking from her eats. 

My bunkmate needed a full task force in protection suits to even touch her.

I was dragged back to my cabin, and when my head stopped spinning, I pulled out my notebook and pen from my pillow. My hands were still covered in blood, trying to flick through pages.

I hadn't written in days, trapped in Gabby’s little world.

**Rule number 1** I scribbled on the next available page. 

“Do NOT trust Gabby Hastings.” 

Underneath, I added: “Protect Gabby Hastings.” underlined four times. 

The following day, Gabby woke me up like normal, wearing her usual smile. 

This time, there was a scary looking metal device attached to her temple. 

I figured that was the thing controlling her ability to influence others. 

Still though, that didn't stop Jude playing along. 

I think he was too scared to trigger her again. 

“Good morning!” 

He stepped into our cabin, fresh from The Yellow Cabin. 

Jude was getting paler, his eyes no longer looked human. 

His camper shirt was clean, at least. 

He was still smiling, for the sake of keeping the human time bomb happy. 

I was now fully aware, if I wanted to keep my brains in my skull, I had to pretend we really were at summer camp. 

The guards, or “camp counsellors” had protective gear and masks to shield them from whatever Gabby was. 

The rest of us had nothing.

So, rule number one to surviving Camp Hemlock, was protecting my bunkmate. 

“Rude, Jude!” Gabby shot Jude a grin. 

In reality, my bunkmate was barely human. Gabby Hastings was skeletal and malnourished, her camp uniform hanging off of her. Like the guy, she too had been drilled in her left temple. I had to guess *something* had come loose in her head, plunging her into delusion. 

“Aren't you going to say good morning to *all* of us?”

The girl gestured to Jessie's bloodstained sheets. 

Nin's elephant plushie was still balanced on her pillow. 

Something sickly twisted in my gut, but the guy was a surprisingly good actor. 

“Good morning, Jessie.” Jude maintained his wide smile, nodding to my dead bunk mate's beds. “Nin.”

I pretended not to notice the fresh wound in the back of his head. 

“Why are you here?” I asked, avoiding his gaze. Gabby terrified me. She was a giant question mark I didn't want to solve. 

Not just what she could *do*, but what she could make me *think*. 

I had been casually talking to my two dead bunkmates for days, my reality twisted for her comfort.

Jude was on thin ice. 

I was painfully aware of the *Stay in your allocated cabin* rule. 

He wasn't responding, and, with a wary glance at Gabby, I met his gaze. 

“Why are you *here*?” I kept my voice down. “Won't you get in trouble?”

*Gabby did not like yelling.*

The guy shrugged, leaning against the wooden door. 

“I may have bribed the guard.”

I had a hard time believing that. 

“How?”

His lip curled. “I told him his fuckin' wife was dead.” 

Before I could reply, he responded to my earlier question, especially when Gabby shot him a suspicious glance. “I have a new bunkmate, and they told me to stay out the way,” he muttered, his gaze skirting the ceiling. “His name is Nico. Fresh from The Yellow Cabin.”

Jude’s gaze flicked to Gabby’s oblivious smile. If she really wanted, Gabby could fry our brains whenever she wanted. “So that's going to be fun.”

-

This experience still haunts me to this day, and I have so many more pages to share. Camp Hemlock no longer exists. The cowards who ran it destroyed every trance, so this book is all I have left.
