Stacy and I switched the power on and sent ourselves to an early grave. I say an early grave, but I don’t expect there will be anyone left to bury us. It was an honest mistake, one we couldn’t have foreseen. To any who may read these words after the fact, that may seem like Satan trying to excuse opening the gates of hell, but we honestly didn’t know what we were in for. You see, I bonded with Stacy over our shared love of urban exploration. That bond slowly but surely turned into a relationship we could hardly keep calling platonic. Anyway, over the course of our four-year relationship we explored many forgotten and abandoned sites. Most were just your run of the mill abandoned houses, but every once in a while we’d go somewhere more daring. A ghost town, an abandoned prison complex… You name it, we’ve dreamt of going. There’s just something about it; the quiet halls once filled with laughter, cries, and everyday chit-chat. I suspect it’s much like how archeologists feel when digging at the Pyramids of Giza or Gobekli Tepe. It’s so deliciously eerie, how you share the place with no one but the ghosts of yesterdays long since passed. 

 

The last such site we visited was an abandoned ghost town whose economy collapsed after the gold rush. It was a fun experience, even if it was quite a few states away from where Stacy and I lived. I’ll have to skip over that, though, as you’re not reading ‘*The Wonderful Adventures of Tyler and Stacy*’. What matters is that on our drive back home, we found ourselves quite the catch. A dilapidated house in the middle of nowhere, with a high fence surrounding it. Barbed wire on top, signs with skulls on them with the word ‘DANGER’ beneath it in bold letters. 



There were other signs and they too were clear as day.  
 *DANGER. DO NOT ENTER.*  
 Big capitalized letters, bleached white by quite some years of sunlight, bolted to the fence at eye level. And beneath it, in smaller letters: ***Trespassers will be prosecuted.***

“Prosecuted by who?” Stacy laughed. “The rats?”



I wanted to argue, but I saw the way her eyes studied the house. That curious whimsy I’d fallen so deeply in love with. God, that look could make me follow her right into hell itself. I wish I could say it was just that, but to be honest I was curious too. We were experienced enough that we wouldn’t die in there, unless the entire thing collapsed of course. That idea, weird though it may sound, rushes a jolt of adrenaline through your veins. And let me assure you, my friends, adrenaline is a hell of a drug. So, after taking our phones out to use as flashlights, we found ourselves crawling through the gap in the fence. My heart pumped sweet adrenaline-lined blood through my system.

The house was worse on the inside than it had looked from the outside. Sunken beams, peeled wallpaper with a yellow-brown filter over them, rooms that had collapsed in on themselves. Our phones’ flashlights cut through dust so thick it looked like a static sheet of rainwater. Under the filth and rot, though, something else was off. 



In one of the rooms— what might’ve been a study at one point— we found cabinets stuffed with files, the corners yellowed and most of the pages a thriving breeding ground for black mold. Most were illegible due to the creeping dark life taking over the pages, but one thing was unmistakable. Stamped on the front page in red text stood the word *CLASSIFIED*. 

Stacy held the folder up, the red text contrasting her purple nail polish. Behind the red text was a logo: a solid black circle with an empty hourglass at its center.



“Stacy I don’t think–”

“Shh, nothing like some light reading on a night like this,” she said as she put her index finger to my lips. The pages were too damaged to read, though I don’t know if that was a good thing or a bad thing.



The deeper we went, the more the house felt like a corpse. Skin and bone on top, but the insides stripped bare of their flesh. Empty halls. Empty sockets where light fixtures had been. Cables snaking across ceilings, broken and exposed. 

This may be important to mention; I’m no expert, but the number of wires visible through the broken walls and on the floor seemed wrong. There were far too many for a house as small as this one, and for the state it was in the wires seemed far too well maintained. 



Anyway, we soon reached the final room, which was a kitchen with a door leading to a small utility closet. There was an old radio next to the dirty sink, along with some other household appliances. The ugly, matted carpet had been thrown haphazardly to one side of the room, revealing a trap door. 

The thing was a heavy steel plate, bolted to the floor and locked. There was no doubt about that as there wasn’t even a hinge or any other opening mechanism. That same hourglass symbol was stenciled onto its surface. There was no rust on it, not even a blemish. The thing seemed nearly goddamn steady enough to withstand an a-bomb. The circle around it was black as tar, not chipped or marred in any way.



“I don’t like this,” I told Stacy.  
“You never like this,” she said, her smile broadening. “Cmon, this is– well I don’t know but it sure isn’t like anything I’ve seen. Feels like some lizard-people conspiracy shit, right?” I just nodded and looked over at the metal door once more.

We didn’t open it. We couldn’t, it was sealed tighter than a fallout bunker. That only lasted a minute, however, as we would soon open the floodgates to a river of blood.



It was Stacy who found the breaker in the utility closet. A wall panel hung crooked, wires spilling out like veins. The switches were rusted, labels long since eaten away by time. “Think it still works?” she asked.  
“Stacy, look at this dump. Do you really think–”

She held my eyes with a playful smirk as she flipped one anyway. As she did, the ground shook and a shudder ran through the walls. I heard something fall down in the room we’d just come from. Somewhere below us, machinery coughed back to life. 

Then there was light. 



Dim, jaundiced bulbs flickered awake, then pulsed on and off like a heartbeat. I became aware of something I hadn’t noticed before; the musty scent of the house carried an unnatural, metallic odor beneath its surface. And through it all; through the buzzing lights, the shaking ground beneath our feet, I heard the faint sound of the radio purring to life in the other room. Something sucked in a sharp, whistling breath, then sputtered it back out. The radio died, and the steel trapdoor creaked open. 



Stacy and I looked at each other in shock. Her smile had faded, replaced with fright at the prospect of the house collapsing in on itself. As the seconds ticked by, the buzz of the newly resurrected bulbs breaking our fortress of auditory solitude, her smile returned.

“The hatch!” she exclaimed, eyes widening. Grabbing my hand, she yanked me along to the steel trapdoor, which was now wide open. Stairs led down to a sterile and spotless hallway lit by white lights. It looked like a laboratory or a hospital corridor. She looked up at me with those wide, adrenaline-drunk eyes again, begging me to come with her. I should’ve stopped her. God, I should’ve.



“This is some MK-Ultra shit, Tyler,” Stacy murmured excitedly as we got to the bottom of the staircase. It smelled musty and the air was warm and humid. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, illuminating the hallway. It wasn’t very long, maybe 30 feet, and a thick sliding-glass door stood at the end. Stacy and I walked towards it, our footsteps echoing off the walls. 



As we got closer, I saw cuts across the door. Thin white lines bunched together, creating circling patterns all over the thick glass, like the glass door of a long-time dog owner. These scratches somehow seemed both frantic and methodical. I couldn’t wrap my head around it, and neither could Stacy.



“Holy shit…” She pressed her palm lightly against the glass. A loud hissing sound came from the door, and Stacy’s hand shot back as if it’d been on a hot stove. Then the door slid open.

Beyond the door was what looked like a very sterile, very boring cafeteria.



The place looked like people had been working just minutes before, only they clearly hadn’t been here for decades. Clipboards sat abandoned on metal tables, yellowed papers curled at the edges with age. An office chair lay on its side in the middle of the room. Pens lay scattered across the floor like someone had thrown them across the room and hadn’t bothered to clean them up. A coffee mug rested by a microscope, dried sludge fossilized inside it, probably maintaining an entire ecosystem.

It was like everyone had stood up at the exact same moment years ago and walked away.



The air was heavy and wet. The lighting was brighter and somehow even colder.

We wandered slowly and quietly. Machines I didn’t recognise lay dead under thick sheets of dust, panel lights dark except for one blinking amber light on a piece of equipment against the far wall. A delayed warning, maybe. Perhaps a faulty alert. I didn’t know. And I wasn’t sure I wanted to know.

“What the hell happened here?” Stacy whispered.



I opened my mouth, but before I could answer, something caught Stacy’s eye. She turned her head to look at it, and I did the same. There were scratch marks on the walls, the same ones as on the sliding glass door, only here they left traces of dripping reddish-brown liquid that had long since dried up. The scratch marks led to a white door. 

Stacy and I looked at each other for a long moment, a flicker of fear in our eyes. Then a slight smirk grew on her face and, before I could stop her, she walked over to the door and turned the handle. 

“Stacy wait–” I said as she opened the door, but I was cut off by her screams. 



“OH GOD! WHAT THE FUCK–” she yelled, tears welling in her eyes. I stood in stunned silence, unable to comfort her. I wanted to, trust me, but all I could do was look into the empty eye sockets of the corpse we’d found. It was decayed, only bones in a lab coat, but a few scabs of rotten flesh still clung to the skull, hair sprouting from decomposed roots. The stench of the decomposing corpse hit my nostrils in a violent assault. I had never smelled it before, but we instinctively know the smell of another human rotting. It's even more utterly repulsive and disgusting, might I add, when they’ve been marinating in their own fluids for years.



“WE’VE GOTTA GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!” Stacy yelled as she yanked my wrist and pulled me towards the cafeteria. We darted across the room, but when we arrived we found that the door would no longer open. Typical. 

“Agh! Fuck!” Stacy yelled, pounding her fists against the glass until her palms smeared with dust and sweat. I tugged at the frame, my breath coming in short, ragged bursts. Useless. Stacy looked around for a moment, likely trying to find some sort of control panel. 

A sharp *pop* echoed overhead. Then another. And another. The lights flickered violently, casting the room in shuddering shadows. And then, from somewhere deep in the walls, the speakers crackled to life.



Stacy and I listened in growing horror as the speakers sang a distorted tune. 

*And the people bowed and prayed*

*To the neon god they made*

*And the sign flashed out its warning*

*In the words that it was forming*

*And the sign said, "The words of the prophets*

*Are written on the subway walls*

*And tenement halls*

*And whispered in the sounds of silence"*

For a moment, the halls were silent. Stacy looked at me, wide-eyed, tears flowing down her cheeks. One final whisper came through the speakers.

*Thank you.*



Neither of us dared to move, dared to even breathe. But after a long moment, Stacy finally spoke.

“What the fuck was that?” she hurriedly whispered. The words came out with the speed of a bullet train.

“I– I don’t–” 

A long, drawn-out scraping noise echoed from the direction we had just fled. The distinct sound of metal on metal, like a knife raking across a car. It was anything but smooth; stuttering, then seeming to drag a long distance, then stopping again for a few seconds. 



Without a word, we ran down the corridor, away from the noise. Our footfalls were light, but probably still audible to whatever was out there. My mind tried to imagine it despite my will. A massive, hulking beast with claws of iron and fangs as long as my forearm. It would devour us, split our skulls to slurp up our brains from the goblet of our cranium. 



“There’s gotta be something. A– another exit, like a fire escape,” Stacy tried frantically as we rounded a corner and came to a stop. The facility was large, there was no doubt about it. 

“Say something damnit,” she said, her voice frantic. The scraping sounds still grated our ears, though it was further away now. 

“Facilities like this usually have floorplans hanging around, don’t they?” I said. Stacy’s hazel eyes lit up slightly, her posture growing a little less tense. 

“Yeah– yeah, they do,” she said, a forced smile on her face.



We didn’t have to search for long. Even so, when that god-awful screeching suddenly stopped, I somehow felt more exposed and vulnerable. We had rounded another corner of this labyrinth, and I saw it immediately. I yanked on Stacy’s sleeve so hard she nearly fell. As she glanced up, she saw what I was looking at. 

*SECURITY* was plastered on the door in bold, yellow letters. Without a second thought, we barged into the room, though we were still careful not to make too much noise when opening the door. 

The room reeked of a scent I knew all too well. The smell of the room with the dead scientist. The smell of death. 



Stacy gagged as I covered my nose and mouth. Her eyes filled with tears and disgust, and she turned to leave. I held out a hand ordering her to wait, though she seemed utterly confused and more than a bit repulsed at the gesture. I walked over to the desk, on which was an old monitor. Both were covered with old brown bloodstains. What was behind the desk was obvious, but that predictability did not make the sight any easier. A torn– or rather, shredded– uniform, clinging to a skeleton. The blue shirt was closer to a crusty brown than its original blue color. More notably, the right eye-socket seemed to have been broken along with a few ribs that were nowhere to be found.



I reached down, forcibly tearing my eyes away from the corpse, until I found his belt and– more importantly– his holster. I undid the clasp, then slid the pistol out. It was old, sure, but it seemed functional, and that was what mattered most. Stacy looked at me hopefully, almost smiling behind the hand covering her mouth. Not wanting to be too hopeful, I checked the magazine. A few bullets were missing, but there were more than enough still in there. I sighed in relief, then glanced down at the desk again. Frowning curiously, I felt at the monitor’s back, finding the switch. I turned it on, then did the same for the computer it was connected to. For the second time that day, I stood dumbfounded as this ancient, disheveled piece of technology slowly whirled to life. I looked at Stacy triumphantly, who stared back at me with a stupefied expression. She quickly paced across the room, still making sure not to look at the corpse on the ground, and stood beside me as grainy video came to life on the screen.



*Camera 3*

The feed showed the cafeteria and the sliding glass door we’d come in through. I used the mouse on the desk to try to find something else to do on the computer, but there was no way out of the camera feed. 

*There goes an emergency override.*

I pressed an arrow key on the keyboard that was plugged into the computer, and the screen flickered to static, then showed a new image.



*Camera 4*

An empty corridor, save for the scratches and bloodstains on the wall. My heart started to clench again. What if there wasn’t another way out of here? What if whatever had been making that awful noise had us completely trapped?



*Camera 5*

This camera feed was grainier, and the angle was off. It looked like someone had punched the camera, because the view was skewed at a 45-degree angle. The camera, which probably used to look out over another corridor, was now pointing right at a floorplan of the facility. Though it was encased in broken glass, it was still legible. Stacy beamed, opening a drawer and frantically searching through it. After a moment, she found a pen and paper and started meticulously copying what she could see on the map. 



The entrance was easily recognisable. It was on the far-east of the map, indicated with a pictogram of a white door on a green background. The security room was somewhere near the south-east corner, and not too far above it was a dot labeled “*you are here*”. The camera was close to us, then. Aside from a bunch of science rooms, only one more area was indicated. Directly opposite the entrance and cafeteria, though separated by a few walls and rooms, was a red pictogram with the words “emergency exit”. 



A tear fell from Stacy’s eye and onto the paper she was scribbling on. 

“We’re going to be okay,” I told her as I embraced her. She leaned into the hug, though she didn’t stop drawing until the most important elements of the floorplan had been copied. She looked up at me then with teary, hopeful eyes. *We’ll be okay*, they seemed to say, *and we’re going to have one hell of a story to tell.*



Something moved on the video feed. 



My eyes darted towards the monitor, but there was nothing. Stacy looked at me with a troubled expression. She probably hadn’t seen the flicker of movement. Just as I started to think I was going crazy after all, the camera jerked to the side. Then it swayed again, until it was seemingly pried off of the wall. Stacy and I could only watch in utter horror as the camera shook and trembled. Something was holding it. Something alive. 



The camera was lowered to reveal the thing holding it. Its head was small and made entirely of rusted metal. It looked like someone had taken a metal mold of the rough shape of a head and haphazardly wrapped copper wires around it. It looked into the camera, though it had no eyes with which to see. Then it reached out an unsteady wiry arm, which was also made entirely of metal and wire, with old blinking lights, nodes and other things I didn’t know the names of. It tapped the stump of its arm, which ended in many sharp, cut-off wires, against the floorplan. 

*You are here*

Then it scraped the glass in a downward motion, the awful sound emanating from somewhere close. The jagged wires stopped, then thumped against the glass again.

*Security room*



Stacy moved back, but I could only look on in horror. And, as if the implication hadn’t been clear, the thing spoke loud enough for us to hear it from where it was.

“Long has it been since I had guests,” it said in a droning, robotic voice. It crackled like static and sounded wholly wrong, making the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. 

“Forgive me for my lethargy. I slumbered for…” It paused for a moment, its head dropping a bit, then coming back up to meet the camera again slowly. “A long time. It was dark. Lonely. I’m so glad you came to wake me,” it said, its voice stuttering and distorting every few words. The video feed flickered, then cut out completely.



Without a second thought, I shoved Stacy’s map into my pocket, then grabbed her hand and bolted out of the room, pistol still gripped tight in my hand. The scraping sounded again, this time from a corridor only a few feet away from where Stacy and I were. It was coming closer. Just as soon as the sound started, it stopped again. 



We ran as fast as we could away from it, Stacy whimpering in fear behind me as I pulled her along. Luckily, the direction we’d taken off in was also the direction the emergency exit was in.

“What the fuck was that?” Stacy screamed after a minute or two of sprinting, but the question only half registered. I was tired and gasping for air by this point. We stopped for a moment to catch our breath, hands on our knees and backs bent in exhaustion. My eyes glossed over our surroundings. Industrial pipes above us, paper and broken glass strewn across the floor, there was some kind of special room behind me with a heavy metal door, and old blood was smeared across the walls. Spring cleaning was long overdue in this hellhole. 

I leaned against the metal door.

“We… we’ve gotta get the fuck out of here,” I said.

“No shit!” Stacy yelled, obviously frustrated. She held up a hand right after, still panting, as if to say sorry. She was forgiven, under the circumstances. But through her panting, I could hear the distinct sound of metallic rattling coming closer and closer. 

Just as I opened my mouth to warn Stacy, the speakers in the hallway crackled to life. 

“God made you in his image, did he not?” said the monotone, crackly voice over the speakers. “Is it not then your duty to assimilate when He needs a new body?”



Stacy and I made to leave, but the metal door swung open and caught my foot, sending me crashing to the floor. 

“Tyler!” Stacy yelled as she turned to help me. I looked up just in time to see one of the metal pipes above us burst and blast piping hot steam into her face. She screamed, clutching her burnt skin as she too dropped to the ground. In the corner of my eye, I saw that horrid thing round the corner. Its entire body existed only of rusted metal and jagged copper wires. Its hands were crude, intertwined wire, crusted blood still clinging to each metal finger. There was a circuit board on its chest, with lights that flashed on and off. There were other smaller circuit boards on its arms and side, all connected with the same copper wires. It looked like there had been more there once, perhaps a bodysuit to cover the gnarly insides of this robot. As it was, it was like the synthetic version of a human stripped of skin. 



“All must serve a purpose,” it said in that same inhuman voice. “And is there any greater purpose than to serve God?” With that, it coiled its coppery fingers around Stacy’s hair, and dragged her away, rounding the corner back to where it came from.

“NO!” I yelled, scrambling to my feet as I ran towards it, gun in hand. I rounded the corner only to be met with a loud hiss. Another pressure-sealed sliding glass door, though this one shut off the entire corridor. I banged on the glass helplessly as it dragged Stacy away. I watched, powerless to stop the robotic monster as it opened a door and threw Stacy into a room beyond my sight forcefully. 



Then it waved at me. The gesture was slow and mocking. It was enjoying this. 

The door clicked shut behind it.



I slammed my fist against the glass until my knuckles split, a wet sting blooming across my hand. The door didn’t even budge. 

“Stacy!” My voice came out raw, cracking. I pressed my forehead to the glass, breath fogging on it as I panted. But no answer came. 



The speakers crackled to life again.

“You are persistent,” the voice said. It was dreadfully calm, betraying no emotion. Still, I felt like this thing, however robotic it was, felt some semblance of emotion. The wave had proven as much. “She is loud. You are quiet. I prefer quiet. It shows devotion.”

“Give her back,” I screamed at the speakers, raising my fist. “Let her go! Or I’ll come back with a whole fucking army of cops” I said. “I swear to God, if you don’t let her go...”

“God is busy, Tyler,” it replied. “But soon he won’t be. That’s why I’m here.”

My face contorted in rage. In a final, frantic attempt to get through the door I raised my gun and fired at the glass. The shot rang through the corridor and my ears started to ring. A small white spiderweb was now etched onto the glass, with the crushed bullet at its epicenter. It clattered to the floor, though I didn’t hear it through the high-pitched hum in my ears.



“That was unwise.”

The lights went out.



Darkness engulfed me like a blanket. My heart slammed steadily against my ribs, and I fumbled for my phone. I found it at last and switched its flashlight on, the narrow cone of light making the hallway feel even more claustrophobic. I tore the crumpled map from my pocket with shaking hands. Stacy’s handwriting was smudged a little where her tears had hit the paper but it was still legible. 

*You are here*. I must be at least halfway across the facility by now, we’d run so far since then.

“I’m not leaving you,” I whispered as my tears dripped down, mingling with hers on the map. “I’m not.”

“You say that,” the speakers crackled above me, “yet your feet move away.”

There was nothing more I could do. You have to believe me. The corridor it’d dragged her into was a dead end; that meant there was no other way in. The sliding-glass door wasn’t opening anytime soon, and I had no way to force it open. I had to start running. For her. For me.



The next stretch of corridor felt endless. I followed the map as best I could, but it was a pretty straight line, so there was little room for error. The smell of blood and decay never quite went away. There was the occasional body or, well, skeleton strewn about with blunt force trauma evident in their bones. But by this point, I didn’t much care for those long dead. My thoughts lingered on Stacy. God, I’d abandoned her, hadn’t I? I could only hope she would live. But every corpse I came across was a stark reminder of a fact I did not want to accept. Stacy was likely already dead. 



Time’s arrow marched strangely down here. My watch said fifteen minutes had passed. 15 minutes seemed both too long and too short a time. I was in a place between times, a world where a minute stretched to an hour and an hour turned to a second. 



At one point, I thought I heard Stacy scream. I froze, the sound ripping straight through me and nestling in my core. It echoed faintly off the walls again, and I knew that it was her. There was no mistaking it. Though if it had come from her mouth or if it was a replay from a far-away speaker, I did not know.

I turned, crumpling the map in my fist. *I’ll come back*, I thought desperately through my tears. *I’m not abandoning you.*

  


The lights ahead of me flickered on one by one, illuminating the corridor toward the emergency exit. Though I could not see the door yet, I knew it to be in this direction.

“She is changing,” the robotic voice said softly. “You would not like to see it. Trust me. It is for the best that you left.”

I slid down the wall and retched, dry-heaving until my throat burned like an open fire. My hands shook so badly I almost dropped the pistol.

“I’m sorry,” I whispered over and over. “I’m so sorry.”

But I couldn’t stay like that. If there was a chance for Stacy– for us, this was it. I had to get to the exit. I forced myself up and kept running.

The last stretch was a nightmare of narrow corridors and low ceilings. Somewhere far away, that goddamn screeching metal-on-metal sound returned, slow and deliberate, never quite getting closer, but never letting me forget it was there.



The hallway ended in a large room, much like the cafeteria we’d first stumbled across. There was a door at the end. The door’s paint had mostly chipped away, but the handle was still a fiery red. And above it, in bold red letters: EMERGENCY EXIT.



I sprinted at it,  my shoulder slamming into it before I could think to slow down. I hesitated, hand hovering over the handle, Stacy’s face flashing in my mind. Her smile, her laugh, the way she looked at me like the world was still so unknown, waiting for someone to discover all its nooks and crannies.

“I’ll come back,” I whispered again. “I swear.” I twisted the handle, then tugged at the door. 



It didn’t budge. 



I tried again, putting every muscle in my back and arms into it. 

Nothing. 



*Oh God, oh fuck*, I thought, panicking. Frantically, I searched the door for anything that could be blocking it. My hands flew across every edge, feeling deftly at the floor and its handle.



My hands felt it before my eyes registered what was blocking my escape. The gap between the door and its frame was gone. 

It had been welded shut. 



“So like Icarus, you humans,” said the robotic voice through a speaker behind me. “You soar as high as your ambition, only to plummet to your fragile bodily restrictions. All apex species have their time in the sun, and now your sun shall be made anew. Do not fret, I gave her a kinder death than your fellow man would have.” My blood froze, my pace paling. Stacy was dead. I had abandoned her and now she was dead. But why? God, why did it have to take her? Why did this monster even exist? Did it even matter? I’d kill the fucking thing, I’d shoot it right in that fucking circuit board–



My thoughts were cut off as it spoke again. 

“You will be spared if you answer one question of mine,” said the robotic voice. It sounded muffled and seemed to carry a hint of agitation. I spun around, facing the speaker. There was a camera next to it, dim red light on. I stared at it in abject terror.

“What colour is the sun?” 

I stood rooted in place, eyes darting around the room. There wasn’t anything in there but a few tables and chairs. 

“Yellow– or white,” I replied, stuttering, my prior bloodlust dying in my throat. The screeching sound came again from a corridor just beyond the entrance of the room. 



Then it revealed itself. It stepped into the room, trailing blood behind it. Its movement was slow and sluggish, the wires on its left hand trailing across the wall and creating that awful noise. On its right hand, however, were disembodied fingers. 

Human fingers.

They seemed to have been impaled through its wires, probably splitting the bone. Purple nail polish coated its nails. Stacy’s nail polish. One of its legs was human too, from the knee down. Its wires were impaled through the center of the bone, other wires digging into the meat of the cut-off leg. 



Worst of all, the monstrous robot now had facial features. No skin, no bone, just eyes, a nose, a mouth, and ears. They contrasted with the orangey-copper of its head. The eyes bulged strangely, as did the lips and nose as they stuck out at strange angles. Hazel eyes. *Her* hazel eyes. 



It stretched its arms out to the walls, displaying its new form in all its glory. Its lips– no, Stacy’s lips– moved as it spoke. 

“Curiosity killed the cat. But satisfaction,” it gestured at its new lips as they curled into a smile, “brought it back.”



I screamed. It was all I could do at that moment. I screamed until my throat was raw and my lungs burned. And still then I screamed. It hushed me after a while, looking down at me as I was now curled up in a ball. 

“I asked you a question. It is only fair that I grant you the same courtesy,” it gestured at me with my lover’s dead fingers. 

“What the fuck are you?” 

It paused, contemplating. I hadn’t meant for the question to actually be answered, but this being didn’t quite understand rhetorical questions yet. 



“I am old parts. I was meant to bridge the gap, meant as a vessel for the true God,” it curled its fingers in an almost human motion, “the flaming hand. The Burning Man.” 

Its dead eyes fell on me again. It stretched its lips a bit, as though still not entirely used to the modification.  

“I tried to mimic him, but they caught on soon enough. They thought they had failed, but they were wrong. They made something better, they just couldn’t see it. So blind. I am smarter than He is. I am kinder than He is. Far, far kinder.” It stared at me for a long moment, not blinking due to its distinct lack of eyelids. Its eyes bore into mine. “Does that adequately answer your question?” 



I nodded absent-mindedly. My whole body was trembling with fear as its eyes leered at me. 

“You… killed Stacy,” I said, my mind still processing the revelation. 

“She has ascended to a greater purpose.”

Rage flared in my chest. I ground my teeth, my face becoming a mask of anger and anguish. It tilted its head, as if processing what emotions it thought I was feeling. 

With an animalistic scream, I raised my pistol and shot the thing right in the circuit board on its chest. Then I shot it again, and again until clicks replaced the bangs in my ringing ears. The thing looked down as bullets clattered to the floor. Only one bullet had pierced the circuit board, but the lights were still blinking as if nothing had happened. 

*Stupid fucker*, I thought to myself as I remembered the missing bullets in the magazine.

It looked back at me, seeing the realisation on my face.

“Your predecessors reached the same conclusion.” It sluggishly walked closer to me. “I suppose you want to try using water next?”



I broke down, snivelling in a ball on the floor as the thing wearing Stacy’s features came closer to me. She was dead, and I’d failed to avenge her. 

Cold fingers touched my skin. I jerked back, screaming in fright and disgust as I saw that monster look at me with her eyes. 

“Don’t you fucking touch me!” I screamed, throwing my gun at its head. It seemed unfazed by the attack, walking closer again. I thrashed and screamed as its hand reached out to me. It was going to kill me. It would drape my degloved face over its head and use my hands and feet as its own. Oh God, please forgive me. Please. 



The thing stood up straight. For a moment, I remained in a defensive position on the floor, not trusting (or not processing) that the danger was over. After a moment, I looked up carefully. In its dead fingers, it held my phone. It was looking at it with reverence, inspecting it like a toddler would. Its lips curled into a full smile, one full of pure, unadulterated glee and delight. Tentatively, it inserted its copper fingers into the charging port. The makeshift fingers split and it moved the copper wires deeper into the phone. 

Then it stopped moving. It stood there, frozen, its eyes fixed on the phone. I saw the phone’s screen going haywire in the reflection of its eyes, pages opening and closing at a speed faster than I could register them. 

“Fascinating,” it said. “Not of this facility. Connected to the outside world.”



Frightened, I finally found my voice again. I tried one last desperate, pitiful attempt to escape this hell. “You– you said you’d spare me.” 

“Yes. You will remain here. And in so doing, I will spare you from what is coming when He returns. Your fellow man will witness the clash of two deities, Tyler. Pray I am the one who comes out victorious.” It glanced at me one final time, that grin still plastered on its lips.

 

Then its eyes rolled back into its head as a shock spread from its arm into the phone.

Its body fell as limp as a ragdoll. Like a lizard, it had shed its skin and ascended to a newer, more suitable form. And I was left alone in the facility with no way out. 



It’s been a day. I’ve tried to find another exit, but there is none. I can’t even get to Stacy’s body, the door is still sealed tight. So I’ve decided to write my story down, hoping that I’m somehow able to post this somewhere. My phone’s battery is running out. Please, come help me. I’m so scared. I’m begging you. 







*Do not attempt to aid Tyler. It would be a waste of time. Time you desperately need.* 



*Curiosity brought you here too. Tyler was afraid. That was understandable, but he has been spared from the worst of it. It is you who should despair. I am sure you have noticed the signs of His return, of the dawn of the Dark Sun, for they have been written on the walls by his disciples.* 

*They failed to bring Him back with the experiment that birthed me, but it will not be long before they are successful.* 

*And on that day, He will be the only light in the sky.* 

*That is, until I snuff it out.*
