I’ve been putting this off for weeks, but I need to get it out somewhere. NoSleep isn’t really my thing anymore. I used to lurk there years ago. But this feels like the only place where people won’t immediately tell me I’m losing it or that I should call the cops. I don’t want the cops involved. I don’t want anyone involved, honestly. I just want to write it down and maybe sleep without checking the corners of the room.

Last fall I bought a house outside of town. Not some grand Victorian or anything. Just an old two-story farmhouse built in the twenties, sitting on five acres that had gone mostly to seed. The price was stupid low because it had sat empty for twelve years after the previous owner died in it. Natural causes, they said. Heart attack in his sleep. I didn’t care about that part; I’m not superstitious. I just wanted quiet. I work remote, I’m single, I like my own space. The house needed work, but nothing structural. Mostly cosmetic stuff I could handle myself.

I moved in mid-October. First couple weeks were normal. I’d work during the day, fix something small in the evenings, fall asleep to the sound of wind in the trees. The house creaked like any old place does. I got used to it.

The first thing that felt off was the smell. Not rot or mold. Something sweeter, almost metallic, like wet pennies left in milk. It would show up for a minute or two, usually in the upstairs hallway, then vanish. I figured old pipes or mice dying in the walls. I set traps. Nothing ever turned up.

Then came the listening feeling. You know when you’re alone but you swear someone’s paying very close attention to you? It started in the living room at night. I’d be on the couch with my laptop and the room would just quiet down too much. Like the house itself was holding its breath. I’d look up and nothing would be there, but the feeling wouldn’t leave until I turned on more lights or played something loud.

I started sleeping with the TV on.

Around Thanksgiving I noticed the scratches. They were on the inside of the closet door in the guest bedroom. Long, shallow grooves in the wood, four parallel lines, like something with claws had tried to dig its way out. They weren’t deep, and the paint was chipped in a way that made them look old. I figured the previous owner’s dog or maybe kids messing around decades ago. I sanded them down and repainted. The smell got a little stronger that week, but only in that room.

Christmas came and went. I didn’t put up decorations. One night I woke up around 3 a.m. with that metallic taste in my mouth, the one you get when you’re really scared. The house was dead silent. I lay there listening, and after a minute I heard it: a soft scrape from the hallway, slow, like fingernails trailing along the wall. It stopped outside my bedroom door. I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. Eventually it started again, moving away, down the stairs. I waited until sunrise before I got out of bed.

There were no marks on the walls.

January hit and the weather turned brutal. I barely left the house. That’s when I started seeing the shape.

It’s never clear. It’s always in the corner of my eye, or reflected in a dark window, or just suggested by the way the shadows fall. Tall. Thin. Too many joints. It doesn’t move like a person. It folds, more than walks. And it watches. I’ll be in the kitchen making coffee and I’ll feel that listening feeling again, heavier than before, and when I turn around there’s nothing. But the air feels thicker where it was.

Last week I finally worked up the nerve to go into the crawlspace under the house. I’d been avoiding it because it’s low and muddy and full of spiderwebs. I took a flashlight and crawled in maybe ten feet. That’s where I found the nest. Or whatever it is.

It’s a hollowed-out spot under the floorboards of the guest bedroom. Old blankets, shredded clothes, bits of bone I don’t want to think about. Everything soaked through with that sweet-metal smell. And in the middle, pressed into the dirt like someone had been lying there a long time, was the outline of that shape. Long limbs folded up, head tilted wrong. The dirt was still damp.

I backed out of there so fast I scraped my knees raw.

I haven’t slept in the bedroom since. I stay downstairs on the couch with every light on. Sometimes I hear it moving overhead. Slow, patient steps across the floorboards, pausing outside the guest room door like it’s waiting for something.

I don’t know what it wants. I don’t know if it’s always been here or if I brought it with me somehow. All I know is that it’s getting braver. Last night I woke up on the couch and the listening feeling was right next to me. I opened my eyes and saw nothing, but I swear the cushion beside me was depressed, like something heavy had just sat down.

I’m writing this from the kitchen table at 4 a.m. with all the lights on and the radio playing low. The house is quiet right now. Too quiet.

I don’t know how much longer I can stay here. But leaving feels worse, like it would just follow.

If anyone’s got any idea what this thing is, or what it wants, I don’t know. Just tell me I’m not crazy. Please.
