I don’t know who else to talk to, so I’m posting this here. I don’t want to bother my friends with this, they have enough on their plates and I never want to be the already flawed girl who also gets to feel like she’s a burden.

Which is why I’m posting this online.

I don’t know, it helps.

I don’t know for sure when it started, at least a month ago. The dream used to be less frequent, maybe once or twice a week. But now the dream is the same every night.

I’m walking across a frozen lake. It’s not a big one, in fact I can see lights and houses clearly on the other side. Everyone I know is on the other side already, waiting for me to hurry up and join them.

But no matter how hard or far I walk, they never seem to get closer. The lights stay the same distance, the voices never get louder, and as I begin to notice something feels off, the ice below me begins to crack.

I used to try running back to the frozen sand, but I gave that up. I never make it, the ice always breaks beneath me, and I always drop into the frozen water underneath.

I used to try swimming backup also, but like running away, that never seemed to work. I can feel the energy sap out of me as my body reaches equilibrium with the water around me, my strength fading faster than my body heat.

So I sink. And I sink. And I keep sinking. It’s not a deep lake, I know that much, but in the dream it’s bottomless, and the farther I sink, the darker and colder it gets. My lungs burn, but not nearly as much as they should for a drowning person. A side effect of hypothermia, maybe?

Well, here I am talking about this like it actually happens. I mean, the dreams feel VERY real, so I could be excused for that assumption.

I had always known that recurring dreams were more common than we all think, so I didn’t think about it that much at first. I was trying new medications, repeating nightmares were the least concerning of my symptoms.

Ever see a nauseous girl wipe tears with the same hands she used to cover her mouth to stop a stream of vomit? I’ll save you some time, it’s not a good look.

But what changed my assumption to concern was when the dream began to change. Not major at first, the same lake, the same ice, the same dark water below. But recently, after sinking for what feels like hours, I started hearing things. Voices, though it took me a while to make sense of what they were saying. They were muddled, like they were being spoken by people talking through a mouthful of water. For this, also, I think I can be excused. It’s dark down there, you couldn’t make your hand out if you poked yourself in the eyes with it.

Which, by the way, you wouldn’t have the strength left.

I’ve tried.

I started writing down what the voices swimming below said. I found if I waited too long, I’d forget the details and become frustrated. It’s been about a week, and I have a small list.

*“Stay here, it’s safe.*

*You don’t really want to go back there, do you?*

*Just give in, you’ll feel better when you do.*

*Wouldn’t it feel good to just slip away? Wouldn’t that feel like a relief?*

*They already forgot about you across the lake.*

*They aren’t coming.*

*Nobody is coming.*

*They moved on from you and it took next to nothing for them to do so.*

*You can feel it leaving you, right? You will? Just let it go.*

*It’s quiet.*

*It’s peace.*

*It’s the best deal most of us will ever get.*

*To go back to being nothing at all.*

*Just to slip away, to feel that relief.*

*Don’t you want that?*

*More than anything, right?”*

So yeah, not uplifting stuff.

And in the dream, they’re right.

In a twisted way, it IS peaceful down there. It’s cold and dark and quiet, but there aren’t expectations. There’s no rules about who or what to be. There’s no need to worry about appearance.

But in the daylight, they’re wrong. They have to be. Right?

I almost called a friend. I wanted to tell somebody. But her son was due any day, I didn’t want to add on to that stress. The next day I almost called my dad, but since mom passed last year he’s been having a hard time. We both have. I couldn’t pile more on.

So instead, I did what most people do; turn to the internet.

I did some research, but I'm not sure how valuable it is. After all, dream interpretation is more of an art than a science.

I did find a few weird forum posts. People having similar dreams; not just drowning, but drowning in a frozen lake, feeling the energy sap out of themselves, hearing voices.

In a dark way, it made me happy that I wasn’t the only one that was experiencing this, but that relief was immediately replaced with guilt.

I was happy other people had the same terrifying dream I did? What the fuck is wrong with me?

I did some more digging. Before I dropped out of college, I was studying cyber security. It’s not the most moral thing to look people up from their IP address, but it beats bothering my loved ones, so I did just that.

I wished I could have talked to them, even just one. Just to hear it in words, the shared experience.

Every single one had passed. Different people, on different websites and forums, who did not know each other offline.

Passed is the term we use to avoid explaining how they died. All of them were found in their beds. Their bodies and sheets were dry, but their mouths and lungs were full of dirty lake water.

They all drowned. Every single one.

So now I’m left to wonder, did they do something I haven’t? Did they cave into the voices and the promise of dark but quiet peace? Did they simply not wake up?

Yesterday night, I started feeling hands in the dark. At first I panicked, but they weren’t rough. If anything, they were gentle. They didn’t pull me down or yank me deeper underwater, they just grabbed onto me, and rubbed back and forth, like a pleasant massage.

But what if that changes? What if I keep waking up, and one night they decide to pull me down, or keep me there? That’s not the impression I get, but I’ve learned not to fully trust my own judgment.

What worries me more is if it’s a choice. What if one night, after a long day, I decide the voices are right? I know it’s the others, the ones that had the same dream. The ones that died.

What if one night I decide that they know something I don’t? Or that everything they have to say and offer is true.

If anyone has any advice or knowledge about dreams, please let me know. I’d like the dream to stop, I even flushed the rest of my new medication down the drain to see if that was the cause, but I think I know that won’t work.

It’s cold but I'm beginning to like the feeling.
