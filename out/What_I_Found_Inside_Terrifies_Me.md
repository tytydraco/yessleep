Hi All, I need to share something that’s been seriously messing with my head. I don’t know what to make of it, and I could really use some advice.

A little over a week ago, I moved into a new house with my wife and kids. We spent the first few days setting everything up—furniture, electronics, and handling some repairs. When I bought the place, I noticed that the backyard garden was overgrown, and there was an old storage shed that was locked. No keys, no explanation. I figured I’d check it out later.

Two days after we settled in, I finally decided to deal with the shed. Since I had no way of opening it, I broke the lock. Inside, I found a bunch of random stuff—some Japanese vintage wine bottles, a map, a guitar, a piano, paintings, Pokémon cards (maybe valuable?), and a folder full of CDs. It all looked like someone’s old personal collection, nothing too unusual.

Then I got curious about the CDs. Most of them had stuff written on them in a language I couldn’t recognize, and none had labels. I have a portable CD player, so I figured I’d check them out. I cleaned a few and started playing them.

At first, it was normal home video stuff—birthday parties, family gatherings, random events. It seemed like someone had just left behind their memories. But then I came across one CD labeled “Dead.” That’s when things took a dark turn.

I put it in, and immediately, I regretted it. The video that played was horrifying. It wasn’t some old home footage—it was people being tortured and possibly murdered. This wasn’t movie violence or some messed-up prank. It looked real. The kind of stuff you hear about on the Dark Web. The kind of stuff you wish you had never seen.

I turned it off immediately, but now I’m stuck with a million questions. Who left this here? Was it the previous owner? A squatter? Someone trying to hide something?

What I Know About Red Rooms & the Dark Web

I’ve heard about Red Rooms before—supposedly live-streamed torture and execution sites where people pay in cryptocurrency to watch or even make requests. While some say they’re just a myth or a hoax, there are real violent videos circulating in hidden corners of the internet. Whether or not true Red Rooms exist, what I saw on that CD was worse than anything I ever imagined.

Now I Don’t Know What to Do

I have a few options, but I don’t want to make the wrong move:

I can’t keep or share this. Just having this kind of content could get me into serious legal trouble.

I feel like I need to report this. If this is real, then someone out there might have actually suffered, and it needs to be investigated.

I don’t want to watch more. I already saw more than enough, and I don’t want those images in my head forever.

I should check the shed again. If something like this was hidden there, who knows what else I might find?


Has anyone ever come across something like this? What should I do? I just wanted to move into a new home with my family, and now I feel like I’ve uncovered something I was never meant to see.
