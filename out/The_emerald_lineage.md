My childhood memories aren't soft; they don't smell of freshly baked cookies or carefree laughter. Mine are sharp, piercing, like the edge of a long-held observation. If I had to describe the place where I grew up today, I'd say it was a house of green shadows, with a stillness that sometimes felt denser than the air. My name was Esmeralda… a name that, over the years, I've come to understand was given to me with brutal irony.

The matriarch, the Grandmother, was the epicenter of our existence. Back then, I didn't know what a "matriarch" meant; I discovered it with time. Her gnarled, strong hands seemed sculpted by time itself, and her eyes… her eyes saw everything, or so I believed, before my own eyes fully opened. She dictated the rhythm of the house; we'd rise with the first sunbeam that filtered through the curtains, and the silence of the afternoons would stretch like a shroud, inviting a kind of collective lethargy that my school friends would never understand. In my house, siestas weren't a luxury but a necessity, almost a ritual, always at the same time, always in the same room, always the same.

The men of the family, my father and my uncles, were large, noisy figures who filled the patio with their deep voices and jokes. They were the sustenance, the protectors, but always, always, at the margins of the true life that we women wove inside. At home, there was an exclusive space for women, like when in ancient times grandmothers would say, "men in the kitchen smell like chicken poop." Well, at our house, that place was the "spinners' room"; they never entered this room. Not because it was forbidden with signs or locks, but by a tacit understanding, an invisible barrier that only we could perceive. There, amidst the smell of dried herbs and fresh earth, my grandmother and aunts moved with a hypnotic cadence, preparing concoctions, preserving fruits, weaving. I watched them, fascinated, like someone admiring and feeling part of old customs that tell the infinite story of a tribe.

As for me, my own perception of the world was different. Other children saw the world with defined contours, vibrant colors. I saw it with a symphony of nuances that no one else seemed to hear. The grass, when I stepped on it, didn't rustle; it hissed, a tiny chorus of bubbles popping under my feet. The house walls weren't inert; they whispered, an echo of footsteps and presences that only I caught. And the smells… oh, the smells. They weren't mere aromas. They were stories. The almost medicinal sweetness of a crushed mint leaf, the bitter, almost metallic trace of a beetle crawling on the damp earth, the scent of a flower that only revealed its truth at dusk. I tried to explain it, clumsily, to my parents: "Mom, the air smells of danger before a storm" or "Dad, the garden breathes at night." They, with a tender smile, explained that it was due to my vivid imagination or an extreme sensitivity to sounds and smells. Today, I know they were referring to hyperacusis and hyperosmia.

As I approached puberty, this sensitivity intensified, but with a new and… strange layer. While my classmates shrieked and jumped at a cockroach scurrying across the classroom, or recoiled in disgust at a spider in the window, I felt an unusual stillness. It wasn't bravery, but curiosity, a fascination that drew me in. The way an insect moved, its dance of survival, its exposed vulnerability… everything mesmerized me. This lack of fear, this calm in the face of what terrified most, made me peculiar. The stares of my classmates, the whispers of "weirdo," taught me to hide my true interests. I learned to feign disgust, to disguise my fascination, to silence that voice I didn't yet understand, but which compelled me toward what the outside world rejected.

Things took an even stranger turn from that day. I was ten years old, the age when the world should be an infinite playground. My mother, a woman of gentle movements and a voice always seeking to calm, was the first to discover it. It was an ordinary morning, with the sun barely peeking and the cool air filtering through the windows. She was helping me get ready for a shower before school, a daily routine in our house. I remember her surprise, a small, contained gasp she didn't quite hide. My gaze followed hers downwards, a dark, primal crimson on the fabric of my underwear. It was my first menstruation.

Her reaction wasn't one of joy or the naturalness I heard in other girls' stories. In her eyes, I saw a complex mix of sadness and a kind of icy terror. She murmured something about how "early" it had come, about how "it wasn't time yet." She wrapped me in a towel with unusual haste, as if trying to hide not only the stain but also the meaning it carried. Her voice, usually a lullaby, became an anxious whisper. "We won't tell Grandmother yet, do you hear me, Esmeralda? It's a secret between us, for now." She made me swear to silence, though I didn't understand the urgency of her request… nor did I understand the implication of that crimson stain in my life.

But in our house, secrets didn't exist for Grandmother. Her presence was a mantle that covered every corner, every sigh. That morning, despite my mother's efforts to act normally, the atmosphere changed. The air became tenser, heavier. Grandmother, sitting at the kitchen table with her steaming cup of tea, said not a word. But her eyes… her eyes pierced me with a new intensity, a mix of grave recognition and somber anticipation. It was as if my small, personal, and shameful revelation had been a signal for her, the beginning of a countdown only she could hear.

From that day on, the house routines, already peculiar, became even stranger. The women of the family, my mother and my aunts, observed me with renewed attention, whispering among themselves in the spinners' room. They dropped half-phrases, like breadcrumbs in a dark forest: "The time of waiting is over," "It's nature, Esmeralda, you can't fight it." I felt like the center of a silent orbit, a tiny planet whose gravity had suddenly shifted. But the most unsettling thing wasn't the change in them, but the change in me. The sensitivity that had once been a curiosity, a peculiarity that made me "weird," transformed into something more. Sounds from outside, once mere hisses, now reached me with disturbing clarity, revealing a hidden world beneath the surface. I could feel the vibration of the earth under my feet, the faint pulse of something moving meters away. Smells sharpened, each aroma a raw, essential story: the cloying sweetness of incipient decay, the metallic trace of fear, the almost electric perfume of an alien life… synesthesia?

But then, fear, or rather, the absence of it… if it was already evident and present before this event, what followed was much more impactful. I didn't flinch from darkness, rats, insects, violent stories, or evil demons. But neither did I feel indifference; it was worse than that. I felt **attraction**, something beyond the curiosity that had faintly accompanied me before the age of ten. I felt attracted to what was vulnerable, to what moved slowly, clumsily, as if my mind sought out what others fled. I found myself observing with a chilling fascination a fly caught in a spiderweb, not with pity, but with an interest in the process of its immobilization. I could stay frozen for hours, waiting for the moment of the hunt, for how the helpless fly's life slipped from its legs into the web owner's grasp. I had to try even harder at school to hide it, this unnatural calm in the face of others' horror, or rather, this unnatural attraction. "Weirdo" became "Esmeralda is strange," "Don't hang out with her, they say she ate a cockroach," and all sorts of false accusations, the typical bullying aimed at a different child, which, in this case, was me.

While the sensations within me intensified, a ceaseless buzzing under my skin, the rest of the house moved with unusual stillness. There were no announcements, no explicit conversations; only Grandmother and my aunts, with an almost ceremonial serenity, began preparing the room next to mine, a room that until then had only housed furniture covered with sheets and years of dust. I saw it as preparation for a guest, perhaps a distant relative visiting. "Someone's staying for a few days, Esmeralda," my mother said with a smile that didn't reach her eyes, as she carefully folded old linens.

But the preparation wasn't for an ordinary visit. The cleaning was excessive, almost a ritual of purification. Every inch of the room was scrubbed with water and vinegar, then smoked with pungent herbs, and finally, a subtle layer of what seemed to be fresh earth, scattered with reverent delicacy under a bamboo mat. The furniture, minimal and robust, was arranged with strange precision, as if each piece had a purpose in a ritual I didn't know. There was a tense silence as they worked, interrupted only by indecipherable whispers and furtive glances at me. In their gazes, there was a mix of solemn anticipation and, at times, deep resignation. Who would this visitor be?

At school, my eyes fell on Gabriel. He was a year older, with an easy smile and a hidden melancholy in his eyes that drew me in. It was the time of first hand brushes, of knowing glances that promised secrets. Casual encounters in the hallways turned into deliberate walks out of school, then talks in the park under the afternoon sun. It wasn't love, not as songs would describe it, but a **magnetic attraction**, an impulse that pushed me towards him, almost as if my body sought a connection my mind hadn't yet processed. My attention focused on his breathing, the rhythm of his steps, the way his body moved. It was the beginning of a youthful romance.

The turning point came on a suffocating summer afternoon. Under the shade of an old tree, in a secluded spot in the park, it happened. It was clumsy, nervous, with the confusing sweetness of a first time and the inexperience of two young bodies exploring. I felt a chill that wasn't pleasure, but something deeper, something knotting in my gut. It wasn't an explosion, but an relentless awakening. As soon as we parted, the calm I had feigned for years shattered. The compulsion unleashed, raw and visceral. The buzzing under my skin became a roar, an insatiable hunger that couldn't be quenched by food or sleep. My senses, already sharpened, transformed into hunting tools. Every sound, every smell, every movement in my surroundings became a clue, a map to what I now knew I needed.

The obsession was primordial: I needed to find **someone**. Not a friend, not a lover. A **host**… Gabriel’s image, previously blurred by immaturity, now appeared with terrifying clarity: he was the flesh, the vessel. Compassion dissolved in a whirlwind of pure instinct.

The red fog of compulsion dissipated as soon as I dragged Gabriel across the threshold. I don't recall the details of how I immobilized him, only the raw urgency of my hands, the unusual strength that possessed me in that park. Now, seeing him inert on the hallway floor, his face pale and his breathing shallow, a paralyzing cold seized me. My mind screamed. *What did I do? I’m a monster!* Bile rose in my throat, and my knees buckled. My clothes itched, soaked in a chilling sweat, and the air in my lungs felt thick, toxic.

My mother was the first to arrive, rushing from the kitchen. There was no scream, just a choked gasp. She hugged me with desperate force, her hands trembling as she squeezed me.

"My child, my Esmeralda," she murmured into my hair, her voice broken by a sorrow I didn't understand, but which felt like a dagger.

Her tear-filled gaze fell on Gabriel and then on me, a silent plea for an explanation I didn't even have. I was in shock, my body trembling uncontrollably. Then, Grandmother appeared… her silhouette filled the kitchen doorway, imposing, unmoving. Her eyes, two icy pools, settled on Gabriel and then, with the same coldness, fixed on my mother.

"Help her," Grandmother said, her voice, a hoarse whisper, cutting through the air like a sharp blade. It wasn't a request; it was an order. "Take him to the room."

My aunts emerged from the dimness of the hallway, their faces impassive. Without a word, they lifted Gabriel's body with chilling efficiency, dragging him towards the newly prepared room. The same room I had thought was for a guest. The creak of their boots on the wooden floor echoed the crumbling of my own sanity.

"No, Mom, she doesn't understand," my mother whimpered, holding me tighter. Her desperation was a silent lament that Grandmother ignored.

Grandmother approached, her shadow enveloping us. Her hand, cold and wrinkled, rested on my shoulder. It was a weight that crushed me, a sentence.

"Get up, Esmeralda," she said, and her voice, though low, was unbreakable. "You are no longer a child."

Grandmother led me to the spinners' room, a place that had always held mysteries and whispers. On a dark wooden table, there was a metal tray. Glistening syringes, small ampoules of amber liquid, and a collection of dried herbs arranged with unsettling precision. My aunts, with Gabriel already in the other room, waited with their faces devoid of emotion.

"This is what you are, Esmeralda," Grandmother began, her voice monotone, almost didactic. "What all of us are. What your mother has been, what your aunts are. It is the gift of our lineage."

My eyes filled with tears, my throat closed.

"I'm… I'm a monster," I barely whispered, the word burning my tongue.

Grandmother stared at me.

"There are no monsters, Esmeralda. Only nature… we do not take lives for pleasure. We give life, but for the new life to be born, we need a vessel. A host."

Then, without the slightest pause, the lesson began. With the cold precision of an artisan, she showed me how to grind the herbs, how to mix them with the liquid from the ampoules.

"This is the sap; it paralyzes the muscles, but the mind remains intact. It must remain conscious. It's crucial."

She explained the importance of the **exact dose**, how to calculate it according to the person's weight and build.

"Too much, and you kill him. Too little, and the containment fails. You must have absolute control."

She handed me a syringe, the cold metal against my palm.

"Here. Practice with this. A little air in the needle, no liquid. Feel the weight, the pressure."

I stared at the gleam of the needle, my hands trembling uncontrollably. The image of Gabriel, inert, returned to my mind.

"Nine months? I'll have him… there… for nine months?" My voice was barely a thread, an echo of fading innocence.

"Nine months," Grandmother assented, her eyes icy. "It is the time the new life needs to grow, to feed, and to strengthen itself. Inside its host. It is the law of our existence, it is your duty, Esmeralda."

The world spun. I couldn't believe it. I didn't want to believe it. But the syringe in my hand, my grandmother's unwavering gaze, and my aunts' expectant silence told me that my life, as I knew it, was over. Grandmother didn't wait; there was no time for lament or doubt. My feet moved on their own, guided by Grandmother's firm hand, while my aunts and my mother followed us to the "host's" room. The spinners' room had been the theoretical lesson; this was the practice, the reality of our lineage.

Gabriel was on the bed, tied. His wrists and ankles were bound with leather straps to iron rods, immobilizing him against the mattress. His eyes began to roll, the uncertain flicker of someone emerging from a faint. A faint groan escaped his lips. It was the sound of consciousness returning, a sound that tore me apart. *My God, Gabriel!* The sight of him, vulnerable and captive, froze my blood. Pure terror flooded me, a panic that chilled my veins and made me wish to disappear.

"No, please, Mom, she's too young! Let me. Let me do it!" My mother's voice rose, desperate, her hands extended towards Grandmother.

There was a plea in her eyes, a mother's supplication trying to protect her daughter from a horror she herself had lived. But Grandmother remained unyielding, a statue of cold determination.

"She must do it. It's her blood. Her duty… like yours, mine, ours. You know it!" Grandmother declared, her voice a whisper that cut the air.

My aunts moved without hesitation. One knelt beside Gabriel, the other tightened the restraints on his wrists. With unusual strength, one of them turned Gabriel's head to the side, exposing his neck. He mumbled, in a choked attempt at protest, his eyes wide, fixed on mine, filled with confusion and fear. The syringe in my hand trembled. The cold metal was an extension of my own panic. The amber liquid inside seemed to boil. I took a deep breath; the smell of earth and herbs in the air was now a reminder of my condemnation… our condemnation. Grandmother nodded, a silent command. My hands, strangely, moved with a precision I didn't recognize, a precision acquired with time and repetition, but… it was so simple, so natural. The needle pierced Gabriel's skin. There was no scream, just a spasm, a small tremor that ran through his body. I pushed the plunger.

I watched the sap do its work, his muscles relaxing with chilling slowness, his limbs, once tense, becoming flaccid, like those of a rag doll. His breathing became shallow, almost inaudible. His eyes remained open, fixed, but the terror in them transformed into a kind of paralysis. It was like seeing him trapped in the worst nightmare, a nightmare he couldn't wake from. It was sleep paralysis, extended and complete.

A pang of nausea churned my stomach. My teeth, suddenly, began to itch, an unbearable sensation that spread from my gums to the depths of my stomach… in the lower part. Something inside me moved. It wasn't a heartbeat, but a dragging, a crawling sensation, as if a tiny creature sought an exit, pushing, demanding. The discomfort was overwhelming, the need to release whatever was moving.

"Out, Esmeralda!" Grandmother ordered, her voice softer now, almost encouraging.

My aunts took my arms, guiding me back to the spinners' room. My mother, eyes full of tears, stayed behind, watching over Gabriel. Once in the room, Grandmother and my aunts surrounded me. Grandmother lifted my shirt, revealing my trembling abdomen. My eyes fell on the almost imperceptible bulge, the point where I felt the most intense pressure.

"Now, Esmeralda," Grandmother said, her eyes gleaming with a strange, almost fervent light. "The time for the deposition has come. Life demands life."

Back, once again with Gabriel, I felt the air dense and heavy with the premonition of what was to come. Grandmother had uttered the word: "The deposition." My guts twisted, the inner crawling, once a sensation, now a demand, clawed at me from the depths of my belly. Grandmother, with cold efficiency, led me to a wooden bench, ignoring my mother's cries, where I sat, trembling, my limbs drained of strength by panic and pain.

"Grandmother, please," my mother's voice broke, "she's too young. Let me! I'll do it." Her face was streaked with tears, pleading. Her hands clung to Grandmother's, a desperate attempt to interpose herself between me and my imminent fate.

Grandmother looked at her with tenacity and reproach; nothing in her trembled or faltered.

"You already did it, daughter. This is hers. The law of our blood is clear." Her voice made my mother release her hands and slump, her shoulders trembling.

With the same stillness she used for herbs, Grandmother took a small, old velvet wooden case. From it, she extracted a surgical steel scalpel and several terrifying-looking instruments, thin and curved. Then, without another word, she gestured to my mother. It was a silent command. My mother, her back hunched with sorrow, took the scalpel. My aunts approached her, their faces a mixture of resignation and a learned hardness. One of them, Aunt Elara, the quietest of all, gave me a fleeting glance. Her eyes, though hardened by years of obedience, contained a hint of understanding, a silent recognition of my terror that offered me minimal comfort. She knelt beside me, squeezed my trembling hand, and though she said nothing, I felt her own disgust, her own contained horror, her own revulsion.

The air changed again; it carried a sweet and metallic smell. My eyes fell on Gabriel… he was there, on the bed, tied, his body an inert extension. But his eyes… his eyes. They were wide, bloodshot, fixed on the ceiling, a slow, terrifying blink. The paralysis of the substance kept him prisoner, but his mind was a silent scream. I felt it, I could feel it in the barely perceptible tremor of his body, the sweat beading on his forehead, the whitish-yellow skin. He was there, he felt everything, he saw everything, he heard everything, he smelled everything. His gaze slowly, inescapably, shifted to meet mine. Those eyes, filled with a terror so profound it couldn't be expressed, pierced me. They were the eyes of a victim, and guilt pierced me like a thousand needles. *It's me. I did this. I'm a monster.*

My mother, her hands now trembling slightly, approached Gabriel's body. My aunts tightened the restraints, immobilizing him completely, and Aunt Elara firmly held his head, preventing him from even turning it. With a deep breath, my mother raised the scalpel. I watched as the blade traced a precise line across Gabriel's abdomen, a clean, superficial incision at first, which then deepened, letting the blood flow from his body. There was no sound from him, he couldn't… only the crunching of my own sanity. With macabre skill, my mother moved his internal organs with the instruments, creating a hollow space, a nest… that's what it looked like, a nest nestled and surrounded by his own organs. Grandmother leaned over, her hawk-like gaze inspecting the work, and gave a grudging nod.

"Come closer, Esmeralda," Grandmother ordered, her voice, though low, brooked no argument. "Look."

They dragged me towards the bed. Contained sobs burned my throat. As I peered over, my breath caught. Inside Gabriel, in that grotesque opening, the flesh pulsated, exposed, vulnerable, and glistening. The space was there, waiting for me. My body convulsed. The crawling within me became frantic, a violent urgency that threatened to tear me apart. My teeth ached, my mouth filled with acidic saliva… like the feeling before acid vomit, but it wasn't that, it was… necessity, impulse, loss of control. My gaze fell on Gabriel, on his wide, unseeing eyes that saw everything, and the horror of my existence became crystalline. I didn't understand why, but my body's demand was more powerful than any fear...
