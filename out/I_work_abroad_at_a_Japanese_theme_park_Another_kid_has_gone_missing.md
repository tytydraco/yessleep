The park was *supposed* to release a statement about the third kid going missing, but because there wasn’t quite enough evidence that it happened on company grounds, technically they didn’t have to.

So they didn’t.

Obviously, it would’ve been a PR nightmare if news spread that three kids in total had gone missing at the theme park.

I felt terrible for the missing kids; all the employees did. But no one wanted to cause a stir because the park employs about 70% of the people who live on this tiny island.

That’s right, the theme park is confined to a tiny Japanese island and has become the de facto economy here.

No tourism means no pay for anyone.

Being the only Westerner on staff, I really didn’t want to be the self-righteous white dude who thought he could solve everything.

But of course, Aiko (my girlfriend who got me the job in the first place) had other ideas.

Ideas that led me to uncover, well… a horrific conspiracy involving kidnapping, bodysnatching, and basically unexplainable shit that I think is probably aliens.

If you already don’t believe me, you can stop reading. 

I won’t judge you.

**But regardless of what you think, I will lay out everything as it happened chronologically, as clearly as I can.**

Perhaps after reading this, you might be willing to get involved. You could help me find Aiko.

I hope she’s still alive.

\*\*\*

I was an English teacher in Tokyo between 2022 and 2023, and that’s where I met Aiko, who was the receptionist at my school.

She was a smart, hard-working girl, who always wore different eyeglasses with cartoons on the rims. Toward the end of my employment, I gathered enough courage to convince my pasty self to ask her out on a date. 

Somehow (to my very own welcome surprise) this first date turned into several more dates.

I don’t want to delve too deep into our relationship, but you should know that I liked her a lot. I probably would have told Aiko that I loved her if everything continued as normal.

If you can read this Aiko: **I love you.**

Aiko was the only person I had met who could speak English as well as me (and liked all the same anime as I did.) She was also the one who invited me to work at the summer job on her hometown island. 

A job at the theme park. For our purposes I will call it: ベーカリーパーク (Bakery Park). I’m not going to reveal the actual name or location of the park because I don’t want to disparage the island locals. 

It’s a very peculiar place. 

It started as just a tiny bake shop which sold delicious cakes made by hand, but after a news article in the 80s, the popularity blew up, and like all things in Japan, the bake shop created adorable cake characters to increase the appeal for children and families.

Soon, staff wore the cake characters as mascot costumes, and following that, they built the merry-go-round and pirate ship ride. One thing led to another, and now we have every Tokyo locals’ favorite little secret.

Aiko and I started working in May 2023 as general laborers. Which meant we were greeting people, cleaning areas, doing the recycling, that sort of thing.

I really enjoyed working there for the first two months because I was able to practice my Japanese in public, and the summer weather was amazing.

**But then the third kid went missing.** 

The third kid in like a span of six months apparently. There was a real concern that could be felt among the staff, people were worried that there was some kind of serious human trafficking, or serial kidnapping going on.

But we’d all been explicitly instructed to let the island authorities take care of it. We could not let word spread among the guests.

So I did as instructed and didn’t get involved. Why ruffle feathers when there were professionals to handle something right?

Well, Aiko saw things differently.

\*\*\*

“I'm going to try and find him,” Aiko told me one fateful evening.

“What?” 

“I'm going to try and find the third kid.”

We were in the employee mess hall. One of the big perks of working here is that everyone ate together at the end of the day.

“They already searched for the boy,” I said. “They're combing through the forest now.”

“I don't think he’s in the forest,” Aiko whispered. “I think he's stuck in the heap beneath the pirate ship”.

Beneath Bakery Park’s pirate ship ride was a ‘sea’ of blue tarps, which were actually covering tons of old props and discarded junk.

“Why would he go in there?”

“He's a kid. I dunno. Maybe he thought that's where he could find a rare flavor.”

I scoffed, but it could have been true. All the kids with their phones were constantly looking for cartoon nutmeg and vanilla sticks to complete their virtual cakes on Bakery Park Hunt™. (It was the park's trendy AR app riding on the coattails of Pokémon Go.)

“We're not supposed to look for the kid, Aiko. It's going to make everyone uncomfortable.”

“That’s why I’m going at midnight,” she said. “Are you coming or not?”

\*\*\*

Of course I had to join. 

On top of everything else, it was Aiko who was allowing me to stay at her aunt’s cottage on the island. 

The last thing I wanted to do was to return to Aiko’s aunt and give some excuse of where Aiko was supposed to be.

I was a bad liar in English. And in Japanese, I was truly god-awful.

\*\*\*

Somewhere around 11:30 PM we snuck our way past the front gates, skirting around all of the security cameras. All of the animatronics looked creepy. 

The normally cheery Chef Choco-Ducky, who would blow bubbles at the entrance, was now this dead, scary statue, leaking soap water from its mouth.

And the pastry-pig guy (I always forgot his name) who would usually give friendly waves to everyone, instead had his arms frozen in a pleading prayer, as if to say: *Help me. Please. Don’t leave me here.*

We stuck to the shadowy rear of the attractions until we came across the pirate ship in question. It was a massive boat, attached only by a single swinging joint above the blue tarp ocean. 

Aiko lifted one of the tarp flaps and directed me inside. It was a massive crawl space, about the height of a child. I could see why she thought this was where the kids would go hunting for ‘flavors’ on their phones.

My flashlight illuminated many rows of support beams, the kind you would find under bleachers. I could see old food carts laying on their side, and wooden signs that said たこ焼き (Takoyaki) and 唐揚げ (fried chicken). 

“Okay, let’s stick together and cover the whole area.” Aiko said. “We'll go row by row.”

“Let’s do it.” I gave my standard Western thumbs up.

We checked under every shadowy nook.

There were tons of cut outs of smiling mascots, and old cardboard stands of desserts to peek under, but all we found were cobwebs.

The kid’s name was Kaito, so we went by each row calling: “Kaito-kun, kikoemasu ka?” *Kaito-kun, can you hear me?*

“Kaito-kun, minna sagashiteimasu!” *Kaito-kun, everyone is looking for you!*

We searched most of the place and didn’t find anything.

 That is until Aiko pointed out a hole in the tarp. It was child-sized and led outside towards the entrance of the Confection Showroom.

“Could the kid have wandered in there?” I asked.

“We have to check.”

The Confection Showroom was slated to open a while ago, but Covid delayed it. And now the park’s been struggling to compete with inflation, so it put the Confection Showroom and other future attractions are on hiatus, even if they were partially built.

Aiko tried her keycard at the door, but it wouldn't work. We circled the hexagonal building and found a side entrance— it was also closed.

“Guess not,” I shrugged.

“Wait. Let’s check for flavors.”

Aiko took out her phone and opened Bakery Park Hunt™. 

On her screen appeared a crappily animated candy cane. It was dancing on the moonlit gravel by Aiko’s feet.

“Peppermint!” 

She proceeded to tap her screen, collecting bits and pieces of the candy.

“So is that … a rare flavor?”

“Yes! Usually only obtainable on Christmas.” She followed the cane as it bounced behind weeds and circled the building. “It shouldn’t even be here right now.”

I followed skeptically. “So the app is glitching?”

She tapped her screen, chipping away at the flavor. The biggest reason Aiko liked to work here was for the novelty of course. Sure the pay was mediocre, and sure the park was run down, but the board still released new interactive desserts each season, as well as new characters. If you could get past the sun-bleached décor and occasional graffiti, you could see there was a lot of passion in creating a world that kids could enjoy.

“Look! He’s climbing the door!” Aiko showed me her phone, and I could see the virtual candy cane skitter up the front entrance door. It phased through solid metal.

I went up and tried pushing on the handle. This time the door opened. *Woosh*. 

“Woah. Did you know that was going to happen?”

Aiko checked her phone. “No idea. I had heard the app used to interact with the park. But this is the first time I've seen it.”

Before going inside, I grabbed a big stick to wedge in the door, to make sure we didn’t get locked in.

We both entered side by side, painting the darkness with our yellowy flashlights. In the middle was a lowered floor composed of LED panels arranged into a circle, all facing upwards. Guard rails surrounded this floor, leading you around the circumference.

Aiko aimed her phone along the perimeter. There were little plastic displays of cakes, quiches and statues of Chef Choco-Ducky.

“That peppermint is gone,” she said, a little disappointed. “Do you think it could've *lured* that little boy into here as well?”

*Lured.* That's an English word I had taught her last weekend, when we came across fishermen at the island lake. “I mean yeah. If the cane unlocked the door for us. Maybe he also lured Kaito?”  

I looked up at the ceiling and spotted dome cameras. “Is it possible security can see into this place?”

Aiko shrugged, she was as confused as I was.

We walked until we reached the opposite end, where a washroom seemed to be located. Then a rumbling came from the ground.

This is the point where I wished we had just run away. **If we had just left this building alone and abandoned the search, I wouldn’t even be writing this story.**

But instead, we both aimed our lights at the room’s center, where some of the LED panels activated.

That’s when we saw the projection. A white, sugar-puffed tanuki appeared above the floor. It was none other than Bakery Park’s premiere mascot: *Mashumaro*.

Normally, Mashu had a pumped-up, jovial demeanor. I was accustomed to seeing his happy animatronic version bowing near the park entrance. 

But here above the showroom’s LEDs, he floated listlessly, staring out of empty eye sockets. 

Half of his face was missing from poor pixelation, and his voice … his voice sounded deep and distorted. Subtitles floated below him as he moaned in Japanese.

ベーカリーパークへようこそ

(Welcome to Bakery Park)

Aiko turned away, frightened by the sight.  Whereas I couldn't stop staring.

“What the hell.”

Detecting my English, Mashumaro floated up towards me. Bits of him kept peeling off, revealing a wireframe skeleton underneath.

*“Hello J-J-James Naka, employee #604373. Welcome to orientation.”*

It sounded like he was speaking from the bottom of a dark, sorrowful well. *“Today you will learn how to* —**SAVE ONE SOUL**— *and how timesheets work.”*

Without saying anything, Aiko and I walked backwards, edging our way towards the main door. 

Mashumaro followed us by the railing. *“Question one: each employee must ensure they are wearing what kind of garment?”*

Gigantic red numbers appeared behind the tanuki. A countdown started at thirty seconds. 

When we reached the entrance, The door slammed on its own, splitting the twig I had left there.

“Shit.”

The numbers were growing brighter and brighter. The loud rumbling returned to the ground.

I cleared my throat and looked at the projection. “Uh, the answer is: we need to wear an apron uniform and er…  nametag?”

*DING!*

The numbers vanished, the floor panels lit up, and a smile spread across Mashumaro's broken face. *“Correct. Be sure to wash your uniforms regularly.”*

Aiko tried scanning her key card to exit, but it wasn't working. She tried again.

*“Now can anyone guess where* —**THE LOST CHILD**— *is located for all employees?”*

We gave up on the door and continued along the railing, looking for another way out. The numbers grew brighter as the countdown lowered. In the last ten seconds, we had to squint to keep walking.

Aiko yelled, “Here! The lost child is being kept here! Isn't it?”

The power suddenly faded. Even Mashumaro disappeared. Electrical arcs shot up from the LEDs. Sparks fell from the ceiling. We both ducked into a little alcove, shielding our heads. For a moment It seemed like something was going to explode.

*“Cor-Cor-Correct! This is the Confection Showroom.”*

The mascot reappeared above the floor, this time it was projected at a massive size. His marshmallow body was shining white light in all directions.

*“Final question. What is the name of everyone's favr*— **CAPTURED BOY** — *any guesses? He’s sweet and puffy.”*

We reached what we believed was the employee washroom and tried to jiggle the handle. It was locked.

Mashumaro became a pixelated blur of intersecting shapes, I couldn't tell what was supposed to be his face. The countdown timer was starting to get blinding again.

“Kaito!” I shouted “The boy is named Kaito!”

The white blurriness suddenly sharpened to a resolute creature. Mashumaro looked photo-real above the LEDs. He grinned immensely with numerous sharp teeth in his soft white mouth.

*“James Naka, congratulations! You are now a proud team member of Bakery Park! As a show of appreciation, here is your* —**NULL OBJECT**.”

The washroom door beside us popped open. A small, limp shape tumbled out.

It was a child.

Aiko gasped and bent down, holding the little boy’s arm, protecting his head.

I watched as the LEDs faded. The alarmingly real Mashumaro smiled at me and slowly flickered out of existence. Some text appeared below him.

情けは人の為ならず  
(Kindness is never wasted)

Then we were in complete darkness again. I turned on both our flashlights.

“Is he dead?” Aiko held hands to her mouth. “Why are his eyes open?”

The child looked unconscious, yet somehow his eyes were wide open. Unnaturally wide open. And he was … *smiling?*

Even I had to look away for a second. It was truly disturbing.

Aiko tried to close the boy’s eyes but couldn’t. She patted his chest. “I can’t tell if he’s breathing!”

I bent down and lifted him, cradling him in my arms. Although he was unconscious, it felt like he was looking right at me with a pair of open, demonic eyes. A sinister flesh-doll.

I ignored the revulsion and peered through the opened bathroom, I could see yet another door. “Come this way, before everything locks again.”

We scurried out of the side exit until we were outside the building. I remember the night breeze being a welcome relief.

Aiko grabbed her phone and dialed immediately. “We need to get him to a hospital.”

The child felt warm in my arms. Fevery. Though I wasn’t sure if that meant he was alive, or if it was just leftover heat from the building. I tried to close his eyes and wipe that smile away, but his eyelids wouldn’t budge, and his lips were completely rigid. 

Aiko contacted the island’s emergency services. Very quickly she explained we had a child in a critical state and arranged for a vehicle to pick us up at the park entrance.

She was in the middle of giving our names when two men suddenly emerged from the shadows.

They shouted in Japanese.

“Intruders! Halt!”

Aiko and I both froze. She dropped her phone to the ground.

They were the night guards, and they both pointed far more powerful flashlights at our faces.

I was tongue-tied and held out the boy, as if that would solve everything.

Aiko lifted her hands up as a show of compliance.

After a tense moment, the guards approached and Aiko calmly explained what had just happened. The security men listened, but did not seem particularly interested.

The taller guard lifted the child from my arms, and commanded me to fall to my knees. 

I complied.

“You’re both suspects.” The shorter guard said.

“Suspects?” Aiko flashed her keycard. “We’re both employees! An ambulance is on its way. We need to get this boy to a hospital!”

They argued in Japanese too fast for me to fully understand. The gist I got was that the guards wanted to detain us, but Aiko was demanding to accompany the boy to the ER.

During the argument, I kept looking at the boy in the guard’s arms, at that menacing smile. Behind the boy’s neck I think I saw *needle marks?* Each time I glanced back at the child I *swear* the eyes were looking right at me. Frozen in a new position.

Eventually a deal was struck. I would be detained in some ‘holding area’ in Bakery Park, while Aiko could join the other guard as they got into the ambulance with the boy.

I didn't love the idea of a holding area, but I wanted to save this boy. *It was still a boy right?*

Things happened fast after that. And I’l try and recount them as best as I can.

1.) We marched up to the park’s entrance, meandering through the attractions under the pallid moonlight. I remember I did not find any of the animatronics scary anymore. 

2.) My real fear was not knowing what was going to happen to me in that holding area the guards were proposing. I remember lagging behind, staring at the child’s freakishly open eyes.

3.) We reached the edge of the road, and saw a pink van. A Bakery Park van—not an ambulance. Its engine was running.

The driver explained he would take Aiko and the boy to the island helipad, where an emergency helicopter would transport them to a proper hospital in Shimoda. A twenty minute flight off the island.

It was suspicious as hell, and I wish we had resisted and argued more. But we had a boy who needed to get to a hospital. 

So Aiko agreed to get in.

As she entered the vehicle, Aiko turned to me and said  “tell my Auntie where I’m going. And tell her that we saved a kid!”

That’s when both guards turned especially sour. The one holding my arm shouted: “You will not tell anyone where you found the boy! Is that clear?”

Aiko and I exchanged dumbfounded expressions. Neither of us were sure how to respond.

“Repeat after me: the boy was found in the woods. The boy was *found* in the *woods*.”

The guard’s hand tightened around my arm. I could see the guard accompanying Aiko doing the same.

Like a pair of robots, we both uttered, “Shōnen wa mori no naka de hakken sa reta.” *The boy was found in the woods.*

The guards both leered and made us repeat it a few more times. We did.

The smiling boy was laid prone on the back seats, his eyes wide open as ever. I waved goodbye to Aiko, for what I didn’t realize would be the last time.

**If I could change anything, it would be to pull her out of that van and run. I really wish I had.** But instead, I remember saying, “Mataatode!” with a hopeful smile.  *I’ll see you later!*

I stood limply as the van shut its doors and drove away. Moments later, it was just me and the tall guard, standing by the park entrance. 

The night had grown cold.

“Show me the back of your hand,” the guard said. He sounded tired and annoyed to be out this late.

I did as he asked and exposed the back of my palm.

He removed a small object—a stamp?—from one of his pockets, and then applied it onto my skin.

It might’ve been the night chill, but I remember my hand felt like it was being mildly shocked by a numbing agent. As if the stamp had an electrical charge or something.

When he was finished, I withdrew my hand and cradled it. The pain receded.

“Where did you find the boy?” The guard asked with finality.

“The … woods. I found the boy in the woods.”

He let out a small, weak laugh, then turned his flashlight back on and walked back into the park. 

“Go home.”

*Home? No holding area?* I was shocked and relieved. I remember at that point I had so much adrenaline running through me that I bowed like four times.

The guard didn’t care.

I started my way back to Aiko’s aunt’s house, thinking about how I was going to explain everything. As I left, I rubbed my palm and observed the new marking that stained it.

森  
(Forest)

 It was the stamp that visitors received when they paid to enter the island’s protected forest. The guard was enforcing an alibi

*I found the boy in the woods. I found the boy in the woods.*

This was the story I was forced to tell [everyone.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EclosionK2/)
