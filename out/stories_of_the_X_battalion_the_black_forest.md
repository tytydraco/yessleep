so, i'm a soldier, part of a task force that doesn't exist. it is kept that way to protect the interests of the people of my country, AKA, they don't want people to panic.

i was part of the regiment designated to guard an area of forest know as the 'black forest.' it's called that way because almost no light can get through it. and thus the... things that are in it don't experience light often, and thus rely on sound. i was tasked with taking 20 other men into a recon mission deep into the forest. this would have been a 5 day mission.

on the first day 2 men disappeared. we heard a shout from behind and two at the back were gone. we would find them on the way out. they didn't even have time to shoot their guns at them. we pushed on to discover what we could here. as the night fell we began to make camp.

it would turn out that they preferred non-moving targets, and thus we were targeted. 2 more died then. our radios cut out that very night. we didn't realise this until the next day at its end, when we were supposed to sign in with the base to confirm that we were alive. 

during the day again nobody was taken, but that night we saw what it was that was stalking us. it was vaguely humanoid, but elongated ears and a perfectly smoothed out face, other than its barbed mouth. we saw it then because we stumbled into its den.

a soldier suggested that we tried to sneak up on it and take it out. he tried, but was quickly heard and then we. saw what it did to those it caught. it ripped him, limb from limb, and we only heard the screams end into gurgling in what i can assume is his own blood. until the radio as he died. we, all 16 of us, all decided to spend the night, thinking that it wouldn't think to hunt so close to its den. we were sorely wrong. 5 men died that day, and the rest were left shaking and huddling close to their guns as if it were their last tether to reality. 

the next day we ran back to the camp, making it about 3/4ths of the way there, before night fell. this time, all eleven of us didn't sleep. we huddled around each other, all preparing to fight that thing to the death. 3 more died, but we managed to injure it, and now it has some new scars to remember us by.

we made it to camp, and we were all taken to the medics, who checked us all for injury, apparently 3 of the men had a marking on their backs, claw marks. it had been toying with us some of the nights.

i have since requested a transfer to a different guarding post, now guarding another thing i cant say, or else i will be thrown in jail. NCO agreement, or my countries counter part. i will be answering questions, if there are any. i have more stories, but that is for later. bye.
