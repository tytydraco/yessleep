When I bought the old Victorian house at the edge of town, everyone said it was a steal. The place was massive, with creaky wooden floors and stained-glass windows that caught the light in mesmerizing ways. It needed work, sure, but I was up for the challenge. I’d been searching for something to fill my time after losing my wife, and this house seemed like the perfect project.

From the moment I stepped inside, I felt a strange mix of excitement and unease. The house was beautiful but carried a weight, like it was full of secrets. My first few nights there were uneventful, spent unpacking boxes and settling in. The nights were quiet, the only sounds being the occasional creak of old wood and the wind brushing against the windows.

A week in, I discovered something odd. While exploring the house, I noticed the hallway on the second floor seemed longer than I remembered. There was an unusual gap between the rooms, as if a space was missing. I counted the doors—five on each side—but something didn’t add up. There should have been six.

Curiosity piqued, I started tapping on the walls, hoping to find some hidden passage. When I knocked on the section between the second and third doors, the sound was hollow. My heart skipped a beat. There was a room there, but no door leading into it.

I grabbed a flashlight and a crowbar from the garage. If there was a hidden room, I was going to find it. Carefully, I pried off the molding and pushed against the wall. It was stubborn at first, but with a bit of force, the wall gave way, revealing an old, wooden door. It was covered in dust and cobwebs, as though it hadn’t been touched in decades.

With a deep breath, I turned the handle and pushed the door open. The room inside was small and dark, the air thick with the scent of age. I shone my flashlight around, revealing tattered wallpaper and an old, iron bed frame in the corner. A thick layer of dust covered everything, except for one disturbing detail—the bed was made, with crisp, clean sheets, as if someone had been sleeping there.

Chills ran down my spine as I noticed the markings on the walls. Words scratched into the plaster, desperate and frantic. I moved closer to read them, my heart pounding in my chest.

*“HELP ME,” “CAN’T GET OUT,” “HE’S COMING.”*

I stumbled back, my mind racing. Who had been in this room? And why had it been sealed off?

As I turned to leave, something caught my eye—a small, leather-bound journal on the bedside table. It looked untouched, free of the dust that covered everything else. My hands shook as I picked it up and opened it. The first few pages were filled with neat, feminine handwriting.

*“June 5th, 1924. He found me again. I don’t know how much longer I can keep running. I thought this place would be safe, but he’s here, too. Watching. Waiting.”*

*“June 7th, 1924. I’ve locked myself in this room. It’s the only place I feel safe. The walls whisper at night, but I can’t make out the words. I’m so tired. I just want to sleep.”*

*“June 10th, 1924. He’s here. I can feel him. I don’t know what he is, but he’s not human. The room is colder now, like the life is being sucked out of it. I’m scared. So scared.”*

The entries stopped abruptly, and the rest of the pages were blank. I felt a cold presence behind me, as if someone—or something—was watching me. I spun around, but the room was empty. Yet, the air felt different, thicker, and colder.

I bolted from the room, slamming the door shut behind me. My mind raced with questions I didn’t want answered. I quickly covered the door back up, sealing it behind the wall once more.

That night, I barely slept. Every creak of the house set my nerves on edge. And then, just past midnight, I heard it—a faint scratching, like nails on wood, coming from the walls. I froze, listening as it grew louder, more insistent. It was coming from that hidden room.

The scratching was soon accompanied by soft whispers, so quiet I couldn’t make out the words, but their tone was desperate, pleading. My heart pounded in my chest, fear gripping me like a vice. I clamped my hands over my ears, but the sounds grew louder, more frantic.

And then, just as suddenly as it began, it stopped.

I didn’t sleep the rest of the night, too terrified to close my eyes. When the first light of dawn filtered through the windows, I made a decision—I couldn’t stay in this house. Whatever haunted that room wasn’t something I could face.

I packed a bag and left that day, leaving behind the beautiful old house with its secrets and shadows. I don’t know what happened to the woman who wrote those journal entries, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that she was still there, trapped in that forgotten room.

I sold the house, taking a loss, and never looked back. But sometimes, late at night, I still hear the scratching and the whispers, faint but unmistakable. It haunts me, a reminder that some doors are better left unopened.
