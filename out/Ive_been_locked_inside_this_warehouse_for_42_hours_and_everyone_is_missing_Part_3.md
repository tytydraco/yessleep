There’s something wrong with Natalie. 


I think she’s been here too long. Isolated and devoid of all hope. It scares me to see her this way. We both started around the same time. Both the youngest employees coupled with the fact we learnt the ins and outs of this place together, it was no surprise that we hit it off so well. She was witty and kind, had an open mind and we often found ourselves putting the world to rights. She helped make those long and boring days go by in an instant. 

Many of the older members of staff often joked about us ending up together but that wasn't the nature of our relationship. Besides, I wasn’t interested in the opposite sex. I think that's why she felt comfortable getting close to me. There were no ulterior motives on either end. We had only known each other for two years, barely any time at all but she was one of the first people I had met that made me feel truly seen. Have you ever had a friendship like that? 

It made my gut churn at the thought that someone so kind had ended up in a place like this. 

I care about her more than I thought I would ever care about a person I had met through work, and seeing someone who would often light up the room she was in reduced to a quiet, nervous wreck clenched at my heart like a vice. It made this all feel so much more real. Knowing that, sooner or later this is how I was going to end up… and if we both lose hope… we won't ever leave. 

I could never admit this to her face but she frightened me now. With the way she would drift off into her own mind, would mutter things to me that sometimes didn't make any sense. Just like the walls that confined us, she had become unpredictable. 

A few hours into our first night together, the tendrils of sleep had wrapped themselves around me and pulled me into probably one of the deeper sleeps that I had managed to have here. My original goal was to stay up and keep watch over Natalie but even with her strange behaviour, I must have found some comfort subconsciously because it hadn't taken me long to pass out in my chair. 

I was roused when something brushed against my cheek. It was light and it tickled as it danced across my skin. Behind closed lids I could see a dark mass hanging close to my face. It rocked ever so slightly. I shifted in my seat slowly ebbing and flowing into consciousness. Confusion fogging my mind. A small part of me knew something was different. That something was wrong. 

 I hadn't quite come too when the sound of heavy breathing filtered into my ears, musty puffs of hot air blowing directly into my own mouth and then something began to drip from above me, falling onto my chin and when warm liquid hit the back of my throat my eyes sprung open, pulse beating against my chest in quick succession as I gagged and retched. Head nearly colliding with a hard mass directly above me.

It was Natalie, only a few centimeters from my face, pupils the size of pinpricks, as they rolled around in the sockets. Mouth agape, head bobbing slowly forward and backward as if her neck couldn't bear the weight of it.  She had drool seeping down her chin and dripping into unkempt hair. 

And then her lips started to move, frantically spewing discombobulated words

“It took my face, it took my face, it took my face” 

I was so taken aback, I didn't know what to do. Her hair dangled over me, sweat dripping from her brow, as she whispered the same thing over and over and over again. In a panic I reached out to grab her shoulders, shaking her harsher than I had intended “Stop!” 

She gasped. Body flinging backwards, stumbling over drunken legs until falling flat against the floor. She stared at me, fear pooling in her eyes, shoulders hiked up at her neck “What the fuck!?” 

Instantly feeling bad I shot from my seat, hands outstretched. 

“Shit Nat, I’m sorry. You were freaki-” 

“Don't touch me!” she yelled. There was a wild air about Nat now, her lips curled back past clenched teeth and her fingers… they were buried deep in her thighs, the jagged point of those nails sinking into the flesh that sat underneath dirtied fabric. 

I nodded my head, opting to sit back in my seat. I think had I continued to tower over her she would have only continued to get more upset “okay, I’ll sit right here alright? Just please… youre hurting yourself nat” 

We sat like that for a while. Natalie quietly rocking on the floor with her knees drawn up under her chin. I didn't know what to do to make this better. Promising anything to her felt like a lie. Instead I let a small smile play upon my lips, a light chuckle shortly following. 

“Do you remember… when we first got to know each other and thought it would be a great idea to hang out after work? Ended up chatting shit all night. We were dog tired the next day for that shift…” my voice petered off as she flicked her gaze up toward me. 

“It was worth it though,” I added finally. 

The quiet rocking came to a halt as she continued to stare. I didn't think I was going to get a response until a light scoff fell from her lips “It was your fault you know? Wouldn't shut up even after I told you to go to bed” 

I laughed at that, leaning back in my chair as the tension began to dissipate. 

“But yeah… it was worth it” 

It felt weird to think about that, how different our lives were now. As we sat shrouded in darkness and mystery. The frigid air dancing around us, nipping at our skin and encompassing our bones…. Leaving us hollow. 

I wanted her to know that despite all of this, I was still there for her. I wanted her to know… that even if this is where we die. I was thankful I got to spend it with someone I loved instead of alone in our own special corner of hell. 

“I'm sorry” she whispered, a dainty hand coming up to flick away the tears that fell. I shook my head in quiet rebuttal. 

“You don’t need to apologise to me… but Nat?” 

“Hnm?” 

“What’s going on with you? What’s happened in the time you've spent here…. You must notice it. Something is…. Different. About you” 

Natalie flinched at the words, gaze flicking to the floor in an instant but she nodded. 

“Something happened. I can’t… I can’t remember what but for a time I wasn't alone here. There was something watching… observing” she groaned in frustration “I can’t get my stupid brain to work properly. I know something happened to me in that fucking cardboard box but I just… I just don't remember what” 

I could see the way she started to wind herself up at the notion, so ready to belittle and demean. As if any of this was her fault. 

“It's okay, we’ve got each other now, yeah? Going forward we try and figure this shit out together” 

Natalie sighed, unfurling her tense shoulder to gaze down to the green smudge of light flickering in the distance “You actually think we’re getting out of this?” 

I wanted to tell her yes, that I did think we stood some chance of getting back to a place that made sense but the words remained stuck in my throat. So I said nothing. Which Natalie took as answer enough. 

She had been right, you know, how excruciating the pangs of hunger were, how I had begged for reprieve. Nat had sat through it with me as I writhed on the floor. A few days after we had run out of supplies. 

She reminded me that it wouldn't last forever, and that for whatever reason. We wouldn't die. It did little to comfort me but I appreciated it when I was able to comprehend the words. 

It's been what feels like a few days now and the more I sit here driving myself insane the more I believe that we aren't dead but…. we're not ‘alive’ either. Somehow, someway we’re stuck in the inbetween. 

Wherever we are though, it clearly doesn't operate under the same logic or science as we have come to understand it. Which makes it incredibly hard to do almost anything without taking a huge risk in seeing what the outcome is. 

When I checked how long ago the last message I sent out was posted, it told me only two days. yet it feels like it’s been at least a handful for me. 

Me and Natalie have been trying to get into the security system for the building on this laptop, now that it's finally working semi normally, if a bit slow and janky. There had been a day or two of getting frustratingly nowhere but today was the day we finally got into it. 

I had jumped slightly from my seat when one of many attempts at the password finally granted us access. Natalie chuckled breathlessly behind me “fuckin finally” she muttered as the screen loaded onto six mini POV’s, each depicting a camera in the building, I glanced toward Nat pointing at the option to look back on old footage. 

“You said, when I found you that you felt like you had been here for weeks but I remember you picking me up for work the day before I ended up here. So why don't we look at the cameras? It might give us ans-” 

“Wait shhh look! The fucking cameras arent recording us, the lights are on for one and I can see Brandon!”  

 I swivelled my head round in disbelief, only to find that she was right. Not only was she right but the feed was  live. 

There was a nervous energy radiating from Natalie, gripping my shoulder as she leaned in closer to the screen. 

I watched as her eyes tracked the movement of our colleagues as they carried on about their day as if nothing was even wrong. Natalie’s face twisted in ire suddenly and I flicked my gaze back to the grainy footage in front of me. 

It was undeniable. Right there, in the middle of the bottom left screen was a familiar mop of brown hair, straightened and neat, so unlike the state we were both in. 

I narrowed my eyes, focusing on the back of her head. 

Next to me Natalie shuddered and in a watery voice she whispered “It… it stole my face” 

So brazen in its movements the thing adorning my friend's skin came to a dead stop in the middle of the last aisle. We watched on with bated breath as its head craned to the side slowly.  

Natalie pushed back from the screen in shock the moment its face twisted to stare directly into the camera with a contorted smile stretched across its features and waved. Bolts of icy fear shot down my spin. 

I closed the system immediately, air evading my lungs. 

In her panic Natalie had retreated a few feet from me. 

She stood there, body wrought with tremors,  her words punctured by stuttered gasps “No this c-can’t be happening… Why are we here Tyler!? What did we do!?” she shouted, motioning one shaky hand out to space around us “What did we do that was so bad we deserved this!?” 

I didn't have the answers she wanted and she knew that. 

“It fucking replaced me! Took my face! And it'll take yours too. Fuck!” 

The pain in her voice echoed across the room, bouncing from the walls and puncturing my soul. I found myself standing from my chair unsteadily, the sound of my own breath ringing in my ears. 

I didn't know what to say, couldn’t bring myself to speak. The rising panic set deep within my lungs and squeezed until I could taste iron on my tongue. 
She was right, we were put here to be forgotten. To be replaced. 

We hadn't seen my doppelganger but that didn't mean he didn't exist. Maybe whatever it was had to learn about the people it took. Maybe that's why I was never able to shake the feeling of being watched. We had been reduced to lab rats scurrying around the dark in a maze of distortion. Tormented as we watched everyone move on with their lives. 

The dull ache of my fingers pressing crescent moon indents into flesh drew me back from the dark corners of my mind, I stared at Natalie. Unable to offer any kind of comfort as she paced the floor in front of me. 

“So that’s it!?” She spat, venom lacing her tone 

“whatever that thing is traps us here in some fucked up hellscape, takes over our lives and what? We just watch it happen until we go fucking insane?” 

I tried to formulate words, desperate to say something, anything! That would put Natalie at ease but I could feel myself choking on the devastation, it climbed up from the pit of my stomach and wound round my throat until I was choking on it. 

I don't really remember much of what happened next, fear had overwrought my senses. I know, as I sit here recounting the event, that I was sure I was dying at that moment. So unbelievably sure, and if it weren't for Natalie snapping out of her frenzy when she noticed, I would have cracked my head on the desk when my legs gave out from under me. 

She had caught me though, like she always did and I came too with gentle fingers combing through my hair. 

She hummed quietly as I lay there, head in her lap. Her kind eyes gazed down at me as I came too. 

“I'm so sorry… I keep forgetting that you're just as scared as I am. Just as lost” 

She spoke softly, never ceasing her movements. 

“I told you already, you don't owe me an apology Nat” 

Unlike my usual cadence, my voice came out strained and hoarse 

“Rest now”  she had said. 

And I did. 

What little hope I had left has been snuffed from me. I just want this to fucking end.
