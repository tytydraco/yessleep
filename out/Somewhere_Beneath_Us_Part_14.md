&#x200B;

I hugged my knees, and Bea hugged me as we sat in the corner of the living room. Across from me, Jan sat biting her nails with Mark next to her, a hand placed reassuredly on her leg. Clair, Benjamin, and Grace were whispering in the hallway, and I knew they were talking about Andi. I didn't hear what they were saying, however. I was solely listening to the underbelly of the house, praying to God that Daniel was okay down there.

Ethan and Frank stood by the kitchen door, waiting with bated breath to thrust it open whenever the need be. Eventually, the conversation in the hallway fizzled out, and the entire mold-covered structure fell into pure silence. For our collective sanities, we constantly interacted with each other at every point of the day. No matter where you were in the house, you could always make out the ambiance of someone talking from somewhere. The fact that the place was this quiet during the daytime was unsettling. My imagination wandered to what this house might have looked like before we arrived. Just sitting still among the hills, sinisterly waiting for unfortunate souls to arrive in its vacant walls. I imagined that this is what it would have sounded like.

Across from me, Jan suddenly perked up, as well as Mark. It didn't take me long to realize why. Footsteps beneath us; Rapid and not sparing caution.

Jan scurried on all fours to the hallway and peered down toward the kitchen, "Get ready!" She shouted in a whisper.

*Tonk TINK plink!*

It was faint and far behind, but we knew the creature was fast. From one end of the building, we heard footsteps pounding up the stairs toward the yellow room, and to the other, the beast barreled through the labyrinth of rooms below. We all stood and rushed to the hallway in time to hear the door to the kitchen swing open and see Dan sprint into the room. Frank and Ethan slammed the door and dragged the pantry back into place as we all crowded around the panting man who had just returned. The thing downstairs had just reached the yellow room and began screaming and pounding, but we didn't care. There were more important matters.

"Daniel! Are you okay? Did you find her?"

"Was she down there?"

"What did you see?"

The barrage of questions clearly overwhelmed Dan, and he raised a hand to silence everyone while he caught his breath. We all waited with pounding hearts until he could speak. He kept his face to the floor the whole time, but when he finally looked up to see the gallery of nervous and scared faces, his expression faded to a solemn one.

"I… I'm sorry, everyone. I went in as far as I could but… there's a big, long staircase going down. As soon as I stepped foot in there, I heard that thing below me and started running back…." Daniel clenched his jaw, and I could see his eyes water. "I didn't… there was no sign of her. If that thing was down there, then I don't know if she…."

He couldn't finish, but it didn't matter. If Andi went down there while that thing was in the same place, then in all likelihood, she wouldn’t come back. Tears began to fall, and gentle sobs emerged from everyone in the group. Not me, however. My brain was still in denial.

"Okay. That's okay." I said softly, taking a deep breath. "We can wait until it settles down and try again tomorrow. I'll go this time."

Dan gave me a sympathetic look, "Joel…."

"I'm okay now. I'll be okay."

"Joel, I know you're upset-"

"I'm not! I mean, I am, but I'm okay. I can go down and-"

"Joel-"

"Please. I can do this; just let me-"

"Joel," Daniel said more sternly this time, placing his hands on my shoulders. I looked into his eyes to see they were full of pain and tears. I surveyed the room to find the same from everyone else. "I'm sorry, Kid, but… She's gone."

At that, I felt something in me break. It was almost physical. The same pain of brokenness I had felt so many years ago that dark autumn night in Arkansas… She was gone. Andi was gone, and it was my fault. I collapsed into the same grief that the rest of the house was feeling and then felt nothing at all.

&#x200B;

We all sat up when we heard the sharp groan of pipes from outside. Dan withdrew from his knees and tilted his head to listen.

"Do you think it's stopping?" Bea asked after a moment.

The question was poorly timed.

All at once, we heard the water outside begin to pick up, going from suburban rain into a tropical storm. The room pounded with the onslaught of water, and Bea, Ethan and I all stood, preparing for what might come next. I crossed down the hallway into the office and looked out the window.

'Of course,' I thought. 'Never a break.'

The water was coming down like a shower over every inch of open 'sky'. Anxiety nestled into my gut as I watched it further fill the flood below. If we didn't move fast, we would drown before those things outside could get to us. The only problem now that we had the keys was getting back to the door. All roads had become a sea of nightmare jellyfish, and with the rain now coming down as hard as it was, I was just in time to see the tops of the fences get consumed. We really didn't have a whole lot of options. On my way back to the bathroom, I looked down into the entryway. I jumped at the sight.

"Shoot!"

"What?"

"Did someone leave the door open?"

"No." Ethan told me, "I was the last one in, and I shut it."

Bea hopped up and peered down to see the same thing I did. The first floor was half-flooded and even worse, three fetuses drifted just below the steps.

"How did they get in!?" Bea cried.

Daniel shook his head. "My wife…" He muttered.

I looked at him, "What?"

"My wife let them in."

"What do you mean?"

Daniel looked vacantly at the floor. "Never mind."

Bea gave me a concerned glance, and I stepped into the bathroom and knelt in front of him.

"Daniel, I…" I thought for a second before speaking again. I needed to find the right words. "I have no idea how it must feel going through what you did… I wish I could tell you the exact thing you need to hear right now, but I don't know what that is. I don't think there is anything. But the one thing I do know is how it feels to lose somebody you love. Especially when it was your fault."

"What happed to Andi wasn't your fault, kid."

"She's not who I'm talking about," I replied.

At that, he looked up.

"I am so, so, so, unbelievably sorry about your daughter, Daniel. I know that it feels like you can't go on and that you failed… But you've never failed us… And we really need you right now…." I stuck out my hand to him. "Please."

He eyed my open palm for a moment, then looked back at me. Slowly, he lifted his hand from the cold, wet floor and placed it in mine. I smiled and helped him up.

Daniel crossed to the staircase and looked over the edge.

"Damn." He grumbled before turning and pacing the hallway.

"What do we do?" Bea asked.

"I'm working on it." He spoke. He looked up and ran his hands through his hair as he paced. Suddenly, something caught his eye. An attic hatch. "That's it!"

"What?"

"We aren't going to be able to swim back to that door, Especially with those things chasing us. We're going to have to sail.

"Well, then I hope you have a boat up there." Ethan quipped.

"Air mattresses."

"Air mattresses?"

"Yeah, blow up beds. My wife had em' for whenever her family came to stay and there weren't enough mattresses. We can inflate those and paddle them back over there."

"Don't you need electricity to blow them up?"

"You do, but I think I have outlet up there. The streetlights outside are still on, so I think the power will still be running."

Bea sighed and looked around, "Well, it's the best plan we have so far, and I don't think we have time to think of anything else." She glanced over her shoulder to see the water steadily rising up the steps.

Daniel nodded and bent over, scooping up the keys he had thrown. He jammed them into his pocket, then reached behind a stand in the hallway and grabbed the hook to pull the attic down. The ladder collapsed down the hallway as dust came puffing out of the entrance. One by one, we climbed up while the drowned souls wailed from below, slowly ascending their way toward us.

The attic was dark, with only three windows letting in what meager light from outside made it through the rain. I pulled out the flashlight and clicked it on while Daniel pulled on a chord, lighting up a single bulb in the middle of the room.

"I'll look for the mattresses. In the meantime, you three look for anything that we can use as oars. We don't want to be paddling with our limbs in that water."

"Got it."

"Sure thing."

"Okay."

We all set to work in separate areas of the attack, digging through boxes and looking for anything we could. Dan pulled out the two air mattresses and began to unpack them, ensuring there weren't any holes or signs that it might not make the journey. I found an old plastic rake for oars, and Ethan found a dusty broom. A roll of duct tape had been sitting on top of one of the boxes, so we began taping the bristles and claws of both, making sure they had enough surface area to paddle through the wake. Outside, the water was rising incredibly fast. I looked down through the attic entrance and saw that it had reached the second story and was already a foot of the way up from the ground. Below me, the things that called the water home turned their curled bodies to look at me. Their black eyes leaked a dark substance into the water.

I pulled away and continued searching.

Bea found an old tennis racket for a paddle, and she passed to Ethan to duct tape. Three out of four. Daniel gave us a heads up and then opened a window, throwing one of two mattresses outside before plugging it into an extension chord and inflating it on the roof. Beyond, the neighborhood had become an ocean, with only the houses that had two stories standing tall above the storm. I looked off to the direction that the exit was in and hoped that we would find it in all of the chaos.

Just as Dan got the second mattress outside and began to inflate it, Ethan withdrew a shovel tucked far back in the corner of the room.

"Hey, we don't even have to duct tape this one." He joked. Nobody was in the mood.

Our second vessel finished with a few feet of water to spare. The fetuses were now so close below us that we could hear their chorus of muffled screams. We all moved to the window where the mattresses rested outside, and I noticed that Daniel looked especially distraught.

"Don't worry," I told him. "This will all be over soon."

He smiled with no confidence behind his eyes but nodded anyway. "Alright." He started, "Here goes nothing."

He used a pair of hedge clippers he had found and snipped both chords of the mattresses so that they wouldn't be tailing us, then slowly pushed one of them off into the water below. It fell gracelessly on top of two of the drowned, but they resurfaced to the side after a moment. We all watched and waited to see if they would be able to drag the thing under, but after a minute of it still being afloat, we breathed a collective sigh of relief.

"Bea, you and Ethan take one. Joel and I will take the other, okay?"

The two nodded and then climbed out of the window, oars in hand, taking caution not to slip off the shingles in the onslaught of the downpour. Daniel and I followed suit and gingerly climbed onto the mattress that had already been set in the water. Part of a fleshy mass drifted through the murk no more than a foot away in any direction.

"You kids ready?" Daniel called over the storm.

"Not really." Ethan yelled, "But when have we ever been?"

Daniel nodded. "Keep your paddles away from the tentacles. If they get dragged in, you'll have to use your hands, and I don't think I need to explain why that's a bad thing."

Behind us, we could hear water burbling into the attic. The whole house would be submerged in a few minutes. It was time to move. Together at once, we all pushed off the roof of the house and into the storm.

We sat on our knees as we gently weaved our makeshift instruments through the water. My heart pounded every time it entered the pool for fear that at any moment, the oar would be yanked into the murky abyss. Below the water, we could see the orange glow from the streetlights that somehow were still glowing brightly. Dozens of the blobs were below too, swimming along with our rafts as we went. We followed the path that the lights presented while I held the flashlight in my mouth, keeping a beam out in front of us in case any rooftops still posed a threat.

The things in the water were fast, but luckily, our paddling was faster, and eventually, we no longer had to worry about our tools getting dragged under by anything. After that, we beelined it and didn't stop, rowing straight down the road toward the catwalk. Soon the wall came into view through the rain, and with it, a pipe that had been directly above the door. We stopped paddling and pulled the oars onto the raft. Dan looked over to Bea and Ethan.

"Alright, no time to waste." He said in a shockingly optimistic tone. "I'll see you kids on the other side, alright?"

They nodded and slowly crawled to the edge. I went to do the same, but Dan suddenly grabbed my arm.

I turned back, "What's the matter?"

Dan smiled, "Here," He slapped a rude awaking into my hand. The car keys. I suddenly remembered something I had forgotten amidst the chaos.

This was Daniel's room. He wasn't planning on leaving.

"I love you, Kids. You and everyone up there. Get them home, okay?"

Before I could say anything, Daniel stood and launched himself into the water. Seeing him do so, Bea and Ethan did the same.

"Dan!" I yelled before diving in after.

The water was dark, and only the beam from my light guided us. I wanted to get Daniel out safely, but I also had to get Bea and Ethan there. I shined the light on the door and saw that all three of them were heading toward it. As we descended, I could feel the pressure mounting in my ears and pushing against my chest. The icy water chilled me to the bone, and my heart pounded not only from activity but out of fear. I couldn't let Daniel stay here. I had to get him out.

We reached the door, and Ethan and Bea hooked their legs to the catwalk. I passed the light to Ethan, and he held it while I slipped the key into the hole.

'Please.' I pleaded. 'Please work.'

*Chook!*

The muffled sound of a mechanism turning echoed out from the door, and I instantly pulled the handle. It turned, but no matter how hard I yanked, it wasn't moving. The water weighed too much against it. I braced my feet on the wall and tried again. No use.

'Come on!' I screamed internally. 'Open, Damn it!'

Ethan saw my struggling and placed a hand on it as well, then Bea. Together we all tugged at once. That's when I felt it. A slight shift. I swung my legs over to the side of the rail and pulled with all of my might. A small suction filled the area, then it got more intense, and more and more until-

*FWOOSH!*

I pulled the door toward me and watched as water began rushing out like a geyser. Ethan tried to hold on to the rail, but the force was too strong. His hand slipped, and he was dragged out to whatever fate lay beyond. Next was Bea. She still clutched the side of the door, but with how she was trying to hold on, if she didn't stop, she was going to cause it to pull shut again. Still holding the handle and the rail with my legs, I reached up and pried her fingers loose. I knew she was only holding on to make sure we were safe. We were going to be okay.

I looked to Daniel last, who was still clinging to the rail. At this point, I could feel my lungs begin to burn, and I knew time was running out. I nodded to the opening, but he shook his head. I stared at him for a moment, and that's when he realized that I wasn't going to go until he did. At that, he let go and let the current take him.

*Thud.*

The suction suddenly stopped. I Peered around the door to see something strange. A thin sheet of glass was blocking the door. I let go of the handle and reached out to touch it. It was cold and slick. Not glass; ice. Daniel looked at me and then shook his head with an expression of grief. This was it. This was the barrier. He had been right. It wasn't going to let him leave.

I wasn't going to take that for an answer, however. I beat hard against the sheet, trying to break it. Doing so only took more oxygen that I was running low on, but I didn't care. I wasn't letting it end like this. On the other side, I could see a staircase that led down, and as I continued to bang and pound, I saw Bea and Ethan running back up. The current must have sucked them down quite a bit. When they took in the scene, they rushed up to the ice and joined me in my goal, calling out for Dan and me in the process. They had no idea that I wasn't the one who was trapped.

Just then, I felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned to see Daniel looking at me. He pointed toward the road where the streetlights still burned their soft orange embers. In the glow, a massive group of the drowned were approaching. We were out of time.

Daniel gave my shoulder a squeeze and then kicked off the wall toward them.

I audibly screamed out through the water, releasing a burst of bubbles into the abyss. I reached out and grabbed Daniel's leg, but he quickly set to trying to shake me loose. Warm tears mixed into the cold water around me as I clung tightly to what I had. The man just looked back with a pleading look. A pleading look I had seen before. I knew what it was saying...

I sat by myself in the hallway, staring at the kitchen door. It was dark out, and I could hear the bodies dancing around outside, but I didn't care. I didn't want to go back to a bed that I would sleep alone in. Daniel peeked his head out of the room and saw me. Without a word, he came over and slouched next to me.

"How are you doing?"

I didn't respond. Just shook my head.

He dropped his gaze to the floor. "I'm really sorry, Joel. I really am."

I still stayed quiet. Not because I was upset or didn't want to talk. I just didn't know what to say. Everything felt pointless now that she was gone.

"Do you want me to sit here with you?"

I shook my head again, "That's alright. You should go to bed, Dan."

I could tell he wanted to say something more, but he chose not to. Instead, he said, "I won't make you come to bed if you promise me you won't run out that door after her tonight?"

A grieving smile came across my lips. I wanted to. I really did. But everyone was already hurting just as much as I was. Andi was family, after all. I wasn't going to go anywhere and hurt anyone else. However, the fact that Daniel knew I wanted to was endearing. "Don't worry. I won't."

"Good." He nodded. He then pursed his lips for a moment before pulling something from his pocket. "Hey, um… This was under your pillow. I didn't mean to go through your stuff; we just were looking for anything that might help us find her…."

He pressed a small, folded piece of paper into my hand, and I stared down at it for a few moments before looking back up at him. Tears began to well in my eyes. I already knew what it was. Andi and I talked about doing it for Ethan and Bea when we were still planning to leave together.

"Goodnight, Joel."

"Goodnight, Dan." I told him with a smile.

He stood and slowly crept back to the room, and I waited until the door was shut to carefully unfold the paper. Tears were falling before I had even read a single word. Her handwriting was enough.

*Dear Joel*, It read, *I am so, so, so, unbelievably sorry. I know how upset you're going to be at me, and you have every single right to be. If you're reading this, it means that I've already gone, and I pray that you won't try to follow me. I was thinking an awful lot about what you said. About losing each other, and about thinking it's your fault. And you were right, Joel. The more I thought about coming down here with you and losing you, the more I didn't want to go. But Joel, you know that I have to. You know that I can't stay here forever. As much as I love you, I want to be able to love you in a place that's normal. A place where we can be fully happy, and this place is not it. You kept me alive these past few years, so now I hope that you'll let me save you. I'm going to find the exit, Joel, and I promise that once I do, I will bring you all back, and we can get out of here together. WE can be together, Joel.*

*I knew that you wouldn't allow me to go alone if you had known, and that's why I had to sneak out. I wish it didn't have to be this way, but I know that you love me too much to let me go. It's the same reason that I know you'll blame yourself for this, but please, I am begging you, do not, Joel. I love you so much, and I can't be another reason you beat yourself up. There are too many ghosts in your life that you think you've created, and you are never going to be better if you don't grow beyond them. Sometimes we lose people, or people have to go away, but that doesn't mean that you have to let them haunt you. Feel that pain, hold the memories, and then let go, Joel. Otherwise, it will tear you up from the inside…*

*I love you so much, and I'll be back before you know it,*

*\~ Andi.*

&#x200B;

Daniel looked at me, and I looked at him. I was suddenly aware of how tightly my fist was clenched around his leg. How much my lungs burned. How bad my eyes stung. His eyes pleaded with me. A pleading look I had seen before. I knew what it was saying because Andi had said the same thing to me many times before, and I had never listened.

&#x200B;

'Let go...'

&#x200B;

I slowly released my grip and felt Daniel's leg slip through my fingers. He looked at me for a second longer before he began swimming back away from me. Behind me, I heard Ethan and Bea screaming after him, but it was no use. He had made up his mind. There was no other way. I felt a slight tug from back as a small hole formed in the ice. It got stronger and stronger the further Daniel swam away from me. The infants moved closer, but he didn't panic. Instead, he just stopped swimming and stretched his arms out, letting them take him.

The last thing I saw before the ice broke and water swept Bea, Ethan, and I further down into the house was Daniel looking back at me, eyes closed and accepting.
