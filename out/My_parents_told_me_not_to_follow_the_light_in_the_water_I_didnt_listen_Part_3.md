It was nightfall again, the clock was at midnight, and the noise from the rest of the house had died down. I hadn’t eaten since the incident that morning, I don’t know if I was forgotten about or if my mother was particularly busy, but it didn’t seem like a good time to push the issue. I was starving. I told myself that I was going to go to the ocean, but I was terribly nervous. I kept thinking about what my mom did to that other kid during the day and didn’t want the same fate.

I held a pen that I planned to use to unlock the door and sat on my bed. Every time I tried to get down from the bed I started shaking, and had to get back on bed, again. Something came through the air then, a mellifluous odor that I could taste in my throat, that pulled me close. It smelled like the brownies my grandfather made when I was a kid. Filled with chocolate, and bits of macadamia. I knew the brownies must be crusted and cracked on the outside, with a soft and heavenly center.

I knew where the brownies were coming from too, it was the ocean, maybe it was the Sea-Witch, calling for me. Somehow, with the strength of desire, I found the resolve to get off my bed, and walk to the door. I took the pen from outside of its plastic casing, and stuck it into the pinhole, I wiggled it while my other hand worked the doorknob. After a few moments I could hear a small “pop,” the door had given, now the dangerous part had begun.

The lights were off, and I switched the light off to my bedroom, so that I was in total darkness save for the sliver of moonlight in the kitchen. I waited a moment for my eyes to adjust, but still, could hardly hear a thing. I made my first step into the hallway and shut the door behind me. The door softly thudded when it met the frame and make “kerchunk” noise as the metal bits inside aligned. It was quiet, but every sound I made sounded like a firecracker – I winced.

Second step into the hallway. I looked at the floor and then back at the hallway in front of me, and then behind me, just to be sure. My heart was racing. My arms vibrated. I breathed as deeply as I could. I’d have gone back, but that smell, those delicious brownies, I’d give anything to taste one of grandfather’s delicious brownies, so I had to step forward; I just kept picturing an enormous plate full of them, and my grandfather standing over me, wearing an old t-shirt, and smiling at me. My Grandfather would always ask, “There’s an extra special ingredient in each brownie that makes it taste so good, do you know what it is?”

“It’s love!” I would always reply and then give my grandfather a great big hug. I missed my grandfather, I still miss him now, the man that I remember him as. A third step into the hallway. I couldn’t turn back now. I was next to my parents’ door. A light flicked on and glowed from underneath the door. I froze, I thought it was over. I was going to get stabbed, and my parents were going to hide my body, maybe in the attic, maybe in that hollow.

I didn’t want to die. I wanted brownies. I ran. I ran as fast as I could through the hallway to the door that led to the bower of trees and the beach with its powder sand. My heart was a rock beating against my sternum, I fell onto my knees, and threw up into the sand, I hoped that nobody had seen me. I hoped that someone had just gone up to go to the restroom or get something out of the kitchen. I collapsed, and rolled onto the sand, the smell of my vomit permeated the air, but of course there was something else, the sweet smell of brownies.

And I could see that golden light again, dancing, calling me from the water. I walked toward the ocean, and the closer I got to the water the more I could smell those brownies, after just a few steps, I couldn’t smell my vomit anymore, just the brownies. And the brighter that light got, and the more beautiful it became. It was stunning and warm, it was like there was a kitchen just underneath the waves, and my grandfather was down there, just waiting to welcome me with one of his enormous hugs.

I stood at the water, and the glowing light glided toward the shore like a will o' the wisp. Until I could see what was glowing. It was a squid, about the size of my head, spotted like a leopard, it glowed brightly – as if someone had stuck an incandescent bulb into it. A voice emanated from it, or from somewhere in the air, “Jeremy,” its voice was warm, and aged. It sounded like grandfather, but I didn’t want to believe it, not just then. “Jeremy, you can’t breathe under water.”

“I know,” honestly, I hadn’t really thought about that. I guess I figured I’d just try to hold my breath for a really long time. I’d taken swim lessons and could hold my breath for a whole thirty seconds, if I really focused, I was sure I could go a solid forty-five.

“You must eat the sand, Jeremy. It will give you the power to breathe under water.”

I didn’t want to eat the sand. I stared down at the squid with its big eye staring up at me, and the water lapping at its tentacles.

“Jeremy, trust me, the sand tastes like sugar.” The squid promised.

I knelt and shoveled the sand into my mouth, if there was anyone I could trust, it was a magic squid that sounded like my grandfather. It did taste like sugar, delicious, powdered sugar, and I shoveled more into my mouth. It felt like someone was tickling my brain, I didn’t know how bad I needed that feeling. I wanted that feeling forever, and I knew then that I might do anything to get it.

“That’s enough Jeremy, you can have plenty of time in the water. And you need to save stomach room for the delicious brownies I’ve made.”

I ran into the water and dove in as soon as I could, my new glowing friend led the way, and we swam deep under water. I saw my grandfather’s body, his mouth hanging open, fish nibbling at his corpse, his eyes said nothing. We stopped and looked at him for a while, I think the squid was paying his respects. That’s what I told myself, anyway. We swam out, further, and the sea level dropped, it was pitch dark, save for the glow that emanated from my friend.

“What’s your name?” I asked the squid.

“My name is Peter because I stand at the gate” the squid said, proudly.

Soon enough we hit the bottom of the ocean, I walked on the sand, and Peter floated near my head. I kept walking forward, trusting that Peter knew exactly where we were going. Then I heard something in the distance, it sounded strange, it sounded like laughter. Peter hovered and looked at me with that enormous pupil of his, his head looked like it had little wings to keep him afloat. “Did you hear that?” I whispered.

“I heard it, Jeremy, stay absolutely still, and do not make a noise” the voice sounded as if it were in my head as much as it was in the ocean.

I heard the laughter again, but I stayed quiet. I tried to quiet the beating of my heart, but it wouldn’t slow, I could hear it as loud as I could hear the door earlier that night. I just wanted it to go away, I wanted to eat those brownies. I wanted my grandfather to be with me again, I wanted off the island. It was a flurry of emotions that I kept buried as deep as I could from fear, then something I couldn’t hide, pain.

A sharp pain in my foot, I had irritated a stingray, and it pierced into my skin, its venom coursing through me. I screamed. I couldn’t help it. Then the laughter stopped, and I could hear a rushing noise. A small girl stood in front of us, with a little smile on her face. She was wearing a white dress, and yellow shorts. She was barefoot, and her skin looked soft. I noticed that her nails were long, too, like they hadn’t been cut in weeks, her hair was long, it must not had been cut in months, maybe years.

Before I could ask any questions, her mouth opened and a serpent wriggled out of her mouth. It had a cobra’s head and a cerulean tint. It came at me; I could see yellow venom flowing from its fangs. I moved to the left, and the serpent flew past me, and snapped its mouth shut. I was terrified, again, and I was in terrible pain.

“Grab it by the head, and bite it!” Peter yelled.

The serpent came at me at me again, and I grabbed it in the middle, it whipped around to bite me, and I bit onto its neck as hard as I could, I dug my teeth in, it tasted like rubber and metal. Its head fell to the ground, and I started spitting. The girl was lying on the floor, the current picked up, and her body slid across the sand, I watched it until it was out of sight. These had better be the best damn brownies I’d had in my long nine years.
