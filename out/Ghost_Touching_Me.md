So I have always been aware that there are spirits and other things in this world and have always experienced things moving or noises that other people couldn't hear. So this happened the other day, I was lying in bed around 10,30pm when all of a sudden I felt a weight drop on the end of my bed, I opened my eyes and saw nothing but then I felt a hand touching my legs, I got scared but said Hello to whatever it was, I felt the weight lift so I thought it was leaving but the next thing the weight dropped again, this time closer to me, around my hips area, I freaked out and said hello again to whatever was there and it started rubbing my thigh, I got really scared so I turned my lamp on and I couldn't see anything (usually I am able to see a faint figure of a person or see it boldly but I just couldn't) I felt the weight leave and I relaxed.

I went to sleep thinking that it was just one of my relatives that had died visiting me. I woke up the next morning at about 4,45 feeling like I was being watched, I loudly stated if something was in my room it needs to leave and I saw a shadow out the corner of my eye walk out, I turned my lamp on and stayed in bed until 7 when the sun started coming up. 

Later that day I was watching youtube when my neck started hurting, I thought nothing of it and continued to watch the video but then I felt a hand holding my neck from behind me, I could feel each finger under my jaw and the thumb on the back of my neck, I got scared so I messaged my friend (she likes paranormal stuff too) and told her what was happening. While i was texting her I felt the hand leave and then I felt something tug on my hair, I got scared and I got off my bed and walked into the kitchen. 

Awhile later I walked back into my room and saw my drink bottle lying on its side on the floor, I had left it upright on my bedside table. Me and my friend (the one I had been texting) were having a sleepover that night so I went to her house. Later that night we were doing a paranormal card game (Sam and Colby have the instructions on their react channel) when I felt a hand grab my arm and squeeze, I freaked the hell out and my friend panicked. Right then me and my friend said very loudly if anything was here with us it must leave immediately. 

Since then nothing out of the ordinary has happened other than just a couple things knocking themselves over. But I am scared in case I am dealing with some evil spirit or spirits. Does anyone have an idea of what this could be, I am thinking it is more than one because it grabbed me and my friends house and was touching me at mine. If anyone has any suggestions I am open to hear it.
