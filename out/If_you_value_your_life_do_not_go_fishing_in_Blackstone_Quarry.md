I have worked as a conservation officer for the Department of Natural Resources for 15 years. Last week was my last. I don’t even care that I was only a few years from receiving my piddly ass pension from the state. I don’t care if I have to spend the rest of my life picking gum and chewed up tobacco out of urinals at the truck stop. I am done.

Being a game warden for 15 years will get you used to seeing some pretty nasty stuff. Animal entrails become as standard to you as twenty dollar bills to a bank teller. And just like a bank teller, no matter how many you handle, you don't get paid any more. If that were the case, I wouldn't have so many stains in my truck from gas station pizza. Much of your time will be spent dragging bloated roadkill out from the middle of the road. I’ve seen deer so distended that they will crack and split like an old basketball you left outside too much as a kid. 

This year I was able to switch assignments and therefore areas. I don’t know if it's because of my “years of dedication and hard work” or just because my boss has looked at me like a charity case ever since my sister drowned 5 years ago. I don’t care, it keeps him off my back. Also, this area doesn’t have a highway cutting through the middle of it. So that means roadkill is at a minimum. 

A few months in and I was really enjoying the freedom that the remoteness has given me. I rarely see any other wardens, so I can be a little more lax on the requirements and duties. My signal here is always spotty, so if I want to slack off a little and get lunch I can just mute my radio and blame it on a bad connection. Then, I am free to head to the diner a few miles up the street and chow down. The owner knows I am not supposed to do that. But she doesn’t care. Hell, half the time I go there I see high schoolers smoking butts out of the ashtray or bumming cigarettes. It scared the shit out of them to see me pull up until they started to recognize I’m not a state trooper. Now when I go they try to bum cigs off of me. I would tell them that I had quit and they would do their best to forget that next time they saw me. 

Part of the area I managed was a place called Blackstone Quarry. It was an old quarry for many years and provided the town with the majority of its income. Eventually the owner, Mr.Blackstone, started to ignore the geologists in the pursuit of lining his pockets. And guess what? They hit water. A lot of water. Flooded the whole bottom of the quarry. Fearing potential litigation, Mr. Blackstone so generously decided to donate all of the land to the government for a cheap price. They were forming a plan for a hydroelectric dam and the quarries placement made for a good “inundation zone”. That way, if the dam were to malfunction, the overflow would only fill the quarry more.

It malfunctioned. The flood was for the most part contained, a few people (including a game warden) were swept away. But it was nothing a few greased palms couldn’t cover up. Most families, like mine, just got a very sincere apology.. 

They could have at least paid for the flowers, let alone the $1,000 dollar tombstone I had to inscribe her name on.

All manner of new opportunities opened up, countless creatures from the lake flooded into the quarry, and a new job as warden opened up. On the bright side, the town had a brand new scenic fishing spot, and I had a new job. Seeing the water did sometimes send a chill down my spine, but I only really had to go there in the winter when it was all frozen. And hey, maybe in some ironic twist, I could save another family from the same water that broke mine apart.

On the third month I found the first body. Winter had started to set in and someone had decided their need for a cold fish outweighed the need to read the warning signs of thin ice over a spring. They cracked right through into the center of the lake. They must have been an out-of-towner, because no one had noticed that they had been down there for days. They had eventually washed to the surface when the ice waned after a streak of unusual warmer January days. The fish did a number on them. The body was frayed and shredded like a moth chewed sweater. The most unusual detail was a circular puncture wound in what remained of the neck. 

As I stood there the scent of decay, our decay, the decay of my fellow human being, saturated the air in my nose and mouth. I could feel the liquid burn of vomit, slithering and twisting its way from my stomach, and up my throat, like a serpent. My mouth coated itself with frantic saliva.

It’s strange you know. I’ve seen so many dead animals that I rarely even feel anything anymore. And yet, even though barely enough remained to tell me I was looking at a human, I could feel my body rejecting what lay before me. Some ancient forgotten voice in my mind would do nothing but just softly cry one word. Run.

It took smoking a whole pack of menthols in the gas station parking lot just to flush the stench of that air, the taste of that air, out of the back of my throat.

I tried to quit that day. My boss Jeff sat me down and tried to rationalize that this can happen and that my job was so important I mustn't abandon it. I knew it was all bullshit, he just couldn’t get anyone else to fill the position. I had told him that I wanted to help protect people and prevent what happened to Laura when I started the new assignment. He said that staying at this job is what Laura would have wanted. I hated it when he said her name. The word curdled in his acrid, tobacco-stuffed mouth like expired cream. I hated that I knew how that word would sound when he added “I love you” before it.

 I hated him. He hated me. I knew it, he knew it.

But unfortunately he was right. Laura would be proud of me for doing what I’m doing, I was honoring her memory.

So, I went back to work. Keeping a close eye on those who returned when the lake finally refroze, while keeping myself as far away from the water as possible. I would always keep an eye out especially before sunset to make sure no one was fishing after dark. When the time would come, people would side eye me and my government plates and reluctantly pack up their saws and rods and head back home.

 I began to relax a little. The quarry was beautiful, almost hauntingly so. It had a hypnotizing natural beauty despite its unnatural creation.

I had heard very few things about that incident since. The body was matched up with a missing person report put out in the next town over. The rest of what I heard was just paranoid theories from the town drunks. It’s funny how everyone's source is always “They”. “They” said that the coroners had to resort to dental identification. “They” said that the government had swept in and took the body away. “They” say that the government let a bunch of chemicals leech from that research lab nearby, and that's why the ice was so thin, and the snapping turtles get so big and so mean, and probably why they haven’t had a steady job or relationship in 20 years. “They” sure knows a lot. Maybe some day one of these wise alcoholics will let me meet their buddy “They” so I can ask them why his friends won’t shut the hell up.

It was one night I was sitting by the quarry monitoring the fishers. It was a windy day, so not many anglers. Most everybody had left hours ago. I decided to pack it up myself a bit early. They wouldn't know. I would turn off my radio and leave it in the truck. Lie that I called in at the end of my shift but the signal had gotten lost in the valley. Then I would take a cursory look around and see if anyone remained on the ice and go home. 

As I walked around looking for any remaining fishers I heard something.
A woman was screaming, calling out for help.

I had felt that same feeling when I saw that corpse. I heard that same ancient voice in my memory saying that same word. Run.

But the word felt different. 

I did need to run. But I needed to run towards it. To save this person from the same fate that fell upon my sister.

So I did. I ran, ignoring the cold wind stinging my ears and burning my lungs. I ran as the screaming got louder and louder and the wind swirled the sound around my ears, twisting around me like rope. I ran. Saplings whipped my face and brush seized my feet, commanding me to stay in place.

When I reached the shore line I looked out into the water. It was almost completely dark by then. With my flashlight I probed the ice’s surface. I spotted a large break in the ice about 20 yards out. I ran as fast as I could, ignoring any safety measures. I looked into the water, but I heard nothing, I saw nothing. There was no discarded fishing gear. No disruption of the snow to show someone had tried to clamber out of the water. Just a clean break in the ice. The ice was thick, almost a foot. More than enough to support even the heaviest of fishermen. 

I fell to my knees. My radio, my fucking radio. How stupid am I. It was nowhere on my belt. I sprinted back to my truck, turned on my radio and, wringing every last whisper of air left in my lungs, called for assistance. 

Help arrived and scanned, scoured, did everything short of dredging the reservoir. Yet they found nothing. No bodies were reported, no vehicles were found in any of the parking areas or on the sides of the access roads. Nothing.

Days passed. No missing person report was ever filed in any of the nearby towns.

I still had no idea where that sound came from. Where that break came from.

Weeks passed, the fishing increased and so did my intake of nicotine.  Public curiosity faded, and I started to feel like one of the guys that believes what “They” had to say. I started listening intently to rumors I had previously dismissed. I would pour through any records I could find that even mentioned the quarry or of the government building nearby. Anything about deaths or disappearances before I started working here. Nothing. I could barely even find anything about the deaths in the flood. Just a few sparse obituaries in the newspapers.

Another slow day of fishing passed, overcast and windy. The sunset did not even try to break the blockade of clouds it faced. It was now late February, and while still breezy, the wind didn’t sound so murderous. I shuddered when I got out of my vehicle to make the rounds, the air felt like it did when I heard that scream. If I let my mind unfocus, the wind itself almost whispered to me about it. But, I tried to stay focused. I turned as much away from the quarry as I could while still looking at it, and failed to light another cigarette. I condemned myself for always impulse buying those cheap lighters at the gas station. Defeated, I stuffed the lighter back in my pocket. I thought to myself  maybe I could get a little buzz if I just chewed on it for a while. I went to walk my rounds and tell everyone to wrap it up and head to shore. The few remaining anglers gathered their things, and whatever creatures they ripped from the depths, and went to search for their vehicles in the fading sunlight. 

I heard it again. That same scream for help. I looked around to see if anyone else had heard. But everyone else had gotten into their vehicles and left already. I rushed out, flashlight and radio ready. I spotted a break in the ice. Far out into the lake someone was thrashing wildly in the water. They were screaming. The closer I drew to them the less the scream sounded like words and the harsher and grittier it grew in my ears. Again that ancient word entered my head, clawing its way to the front of my attention. This time it was only said once.

Run.

It echoed in my skull like a shattered wine glass. The feeling made me want to run away, not to run forward and save them. What is wrong with me? I needed to save this woman. 

I choked it down and ran closer. I could see her distant silhouette thrashing wildly, desperately trying to grasp at anything that she could hold onto. I hastened my pace, the adrenaline and my own cold leaking eyes blurring my vision. As I dived forward to grab her outstretched arm my flashlight and radio clattered onto the ice. In the dark I felt around for her arm. It was bare, slick, and cold from the water. I pulled it as hard as I could trying to free her. She tried to pull herself up from the ice but she was heavy. Resilient even. Her grip tightened. I felt a sting in my hands where she had grasped me. My feet edged closer to the water. She wasn't pulling herself from the ice, she was pulling me under it. I then realized her screaming had ceased. I strained my eyes to see her arm was black and shiny. And it was long. Far too long. As I lay on my back trying to pull away I realized that it stretched the entire length of my body. Its hand flattened and stretched out, wrapping it's glistening, barbed edges around my hands. It now completely encompassed both of my hands down to my wrist. I could feel sharp jabs, almost like needles digging into the skin on my hands, tearing my flesh.

Then I smelled it. That familiar odor that had invaded my senses and permeated my very skin. That odor that I had smelled when I discovered that corpse on the shore.

That ancient word from that ancient voice grew from a vestigial echo into the only thing that I could hear. As my body was slowly dragged into the water, the suggestion of a face crested over the edge of the ice, lit cautiously by the discarded electric light. As the visage breached, I could see that large lacerations seemed to separate the face into quarters. I saw as the quarters separated and a thick barbed tentacle squirmed from between them. The face continued to peel back and bloom like a grotesque lily. The appendage rose overhead, twitching like a hound scenting the air, then struck towards me. I threw myself to the side as the probe plunged deep into the ice next to me. But my effort was not enough as one of the barbs sliced my cheek deeply. My molars felt cool air as my cheek split, forcibly lengthening my grimace. This cold sensation was quickly resolved by the searing heat of pain like no other.

As the tentacle tried to wrench itself from the ice, I took the opportunity to free myself. I ripped my right hand free, and the grasping hooks of the creature rended my skin. Pain roared through my arm as my face felt the warm spray of my own blood. I reached for the pistol on my hip trying to thumb the latch of my holster with my parody of a hand, making everything it touched slick and glossy. With great effort, I cleared the barrel from its holster and pointed it at the water. Bullets ripped into the ice and water; the pistol's harsh report whelming my own cries of pain, anger, and primordial violence. I felt my left hand quickly slip free from its cutting bonds as the writhing dark mass of flesh reeled and slumped back into the water. 

I clawed my way back onto the ice and attempted to stand. No use.

It was dark now. Very dark. 

My ears were ringing and mucus heaved from my mouth and nose, forming a sea foam froth at the corners of my newly widened mouth. I pulled my way back toward the shore and my truck, holding the flashlight in my teeth so I did not miss it. I could hear the ice lazily creaking as if waking up from a long sleep. 

Thump. 

I hastened my crawl. 

Thump. 

The slamming sent tremors through the stubborn ice beneath me.

Very faintly, I swear I could hear a woman screaming. It sounded muffled. Softly, it resonated through the ice.

Then again. 

Thump.

By the third thump I had reached the edge of the quarry.  It seemed to stop. But I could not be sure. I clambered into my vehicle and started the engine. I stripped the cold wet clothes off my near hypothermic body.  I turned the heat all the way up and twisted the radio volume knob so hard it snapped off in my hand, the harsh static cooing to me like a mother to her child. There I laid, curled up until the blackness at the edge of my vision slowly encompassed everything. 

I was told that some workers from the hydro electric plant found me in my vehicle the next morning in a state of prolonged shock. The car battery drained and the gas tank dry. Blood and a viscous black liquid covered much of the upholstery and side panel of the vehicle.

They did not say much about the nature of the wounds. They tried to convince me I must have taken a tumble off of one the cliffs by the shore and got cut up by briars and rocks before falling through the ice. I did not try to fight them on the matter. I knew nothing I could say about it would be believed. They had already looked at me differently ever since I had reported the screaming.

I had asked if they had searched and they told me that the workers from the plant were unable to find any evidence of foul play, that my blood and fingerprints were the only thing found in the area and the ice had already begun to refreeze by the time they had arrived. And that there was no reason to delve further. 

They were even kind enough to send flowers to my hospital room.
