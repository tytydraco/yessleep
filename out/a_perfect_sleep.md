A few years ago my husband and I were going through some issues. He would cheat on me a lot, and after confronting him about it, he grew extremely sick of his actions. We both had trouble getting to sleep after this, but he developed a full blown sleeping disorder. He would toss and turn, get up and then back into bed, and would even pace the room some nights, eventually forcing himself to go on a midnight run. I felt horrible for him, but a piece of me was happy to see his torment, I’ll admit. One night as my husband tossed and turned, he got up and returned about twenty minutes later. Upon returning, I noticed his breathing was heavy so I grabbed his hand tightly, reassuring him I was there for him and he was okay. But he felt different, stiff and rigid. We continued to lay with one another, and eventually I rolled over to see his face. It was pale white, his lips almost purple, and his eyes were doubled in size. He just stared at me, and attempted to smile as his lips quivered violently. “John, are you alright? What’s going on with you?” I asked in a panic. But nothing, he just continued staring, mouth now wide, revealing yellowed jagged teeth that were not my husbands. I shot up out of bed and went for the lights, but they didn’t work. I was about to make a run for it, until my phone began to ring. It was from my husband. A jolt of electricity shot through my spine, and the large imposter was now giggling in a deep, disturbing voice. I answered my phone. “Hey babe, I couldn’t sleep so I went for a run, but some homeless guy bit me. He started laughing and ran away, I don’t know but I’m on my way back home now to go to the hospital. I’ll be home soon-“ He hung up before I could even mutter a word. 



My husband died that night in what doctors call a complete mystery. The monster sat in my bed until sunrise, and then he simply got up and walked out of the house. Every night he returns, ready to laugh into my ear as I try to sleep. It’s been some years since that night, and it doesn’t matter where I go, or what I try to do, he always follows me. I’ve even moved states, to no prevail. If I try to get a new boyfriend, they go missing or die in some bizarre fashion, and my nightly stalker takes on a new appearance. As the sun goes down, and I write this out, I can’t help but wonder if there is a way out. Of course not. This thing wasn’t going anywhere, and as I accept this information, I stare into the bright cat like eyes of my nightly stalker, lying right next to me, smile growing ever wide with trembling lips. He’s the only constant I currently have in my life, and I begin to grow comfort in this. For the first time in many years, I get the best night of sleep I’ve ever had.
