The thing is i never really wanted one, i much prefer having a dog or a cat, but since my parents didn’t want to deal with an animal in the house i figured i might end up buying a bunny instead since it doesn’t give much trouble.

I choose a male, brown one with dark eyes, since he seemed to be much more active than the rest of the bunch, running in circles nonstop and i found it kind of funny.
So the first few weeks everything went normal, i named him Schneider since i found it cool, gave him rabbit food, water, cereal bars, carrots, played with him, etc.

That was until one day when i came back from school and found Schneider shaking and with what appeared to be blood around his mouth.
I got concerned but didn’t really care too much since i thought he had bitten his tongue, so i filled his water bottle with a dissolved half pill of diazepam in it to calm his shakes. I just wasn’t thinking straight at that moment.

A couple weeks later i find Schneider shaking even more, i could even hear the animal’s teeth clenching together. This time i was in a bit of a panic so without considering it i gave him the full pill. I knew he was sick but i really had to study for the maths exam i had the following day so i couldn’t carry him to a vet, figured my father would do it either way after i told him about it.

That night i could hear Schneider constantly hitting his cage bars.

“Quiet that fucking thing already” i heard my father say from across the living room.
I went up to Schneider’s cage and found him with an open wound on his head.
“This rabbit is an idiot, what kind of animal hits his fucking head against his cage until he bleeds” i thought.
I tried to get a look at the wound to see how bad it was but he wasn’t letting me grab him. I grew frustrated so i pulled him by the ears as strong as i could to stop his head from moving and in that moment Schneider bit the index finger from my other hand, almost ripping it off clean, blood started pouring and i wondered how the fuck could a rabbit bite that deep.

“That’s it i had enough you little motherfucker” i said.
I went to the bathroom and in a fury grabbed a bottle of Xanax, broke a few of the pills and dissolved them in water with the intend of getting him asleep.
I entered the room, and gave him the water bottle. I sat and waited until he started drinking it and sure enough he fell asleep, or dead, i didnt really care at that point, i wanted that animal to stop bothering me. Thinking about it now i can’t help but feel ashamed for what i did to that poor thing.

When i was about to leave the room Schneider’s cage went flying and i heard the most horrific and animalistic shriek i ever heard.
I slowly turned around, either too shocked or too scared to do anything else, maybe both.

The abomination that stood in front of me resembled anything but a rabbit, 8 or 9 feet tall with two heads, one looked like a horribly deformed human, with uneven shaped eyes looking in different directions, a grotesquely shaped nose covered in pus and an open wide mouth with decaying teeth and seven saliva leaking tongues, the other appeared to be a mix between a wolf and a hyena, with red eyes and sharp spikes all across its face.
It took me a moment to realize that those were sharp teeth and not spikes.

In that moment the wolf head opened its mouth and let out another terrifying shriek which made the house tremble and i bolted from the room and out of the house not even processing what i just saw, not even thinking about where to go and sure enough not knowing how far should i go before i could be safe or until my parents torn flesh and screams where no longer heard.
