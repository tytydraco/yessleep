When we hear about things like becoming a parent, we have a set age in our mind, and we think that someone can be a parent only in that particular age group. But, this has been defied in the Guntur town of Andhra Pradesh in India. A lady named Erramatti Mangamma gave birth to twin baby girls at 74. 

When the world’s oldest mother gave birth at 74, many people didn’t believe this news. Until then, the oldest mother was 72 years of age in Punjab in, India. But then the title is now taken by Erramatti.

Earlier, pregnancy was almost impossible after the age of 50. With the advancement of assisted reproductive treatments such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), cryopreservation, and in vitro fertilization (IVF), this is now possible.

One thing that should be remembered here is that pregnancy is possible after 50 years of age, but there lies the risk to the health while delivering the baby at such old age.  

## Introducing Erramatti Mangamma

Erramatti Mangamma was born on 1st September 1946.  

5th September 2019 was the age when she became the world’s oldest mother. 

Erramatti Mangamma was married to Erramatti Raja Rao on 22nd March 1962 in the East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh. 

The couple wanted the child early, but they were not lucky enough. They consulted many doctors, but nothing gave them positive results.

In 2018, the couple founded Ahalya Nursing Home, where they met Dr. Shanakkayala Umashankar, and he took up this challenging case.

One of the major reasons why the couple wanted the child was due to social stigma. Society was not good towards them at all. 

## Becoming Mother at 74 with a Successful Delivery

Erramatti got pregnant in January after receiving the go-ahead for IVF therapy.

After struggling for over 55 years, Erramatti and her husband found Dr. Uma Shankar, director of the Ahalya Hospital. 

After some tests, the doctor decided that the lady was healthy enough for the medical procedure. In January 2019, Erramatti went through 1 round of IVF treatment using donor eggs. 

Her husband’s sperm was utilized to fertilize donor eggs because she had already gone through [**menopause**](https://healthclubfinder.org/stages-of-menopause/).

Doctors themselves doubted whether the delivery would be successful or not, but she defied the odds and delivered two baby girls of approx 4lbs. She gave birth via cesarean section. 

All thanks to modern medical science and Dr. Uma Shankar. 

## What is IVF?

IVF, i.e., in vitro fertilization, is one of the popular types of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). To help sperm fertilize an egg and the fertilized egg implant in your uterus, in vitro fertilization (IVF) uses a mix of medications and surgical techniques.

## Parents Reaction

As the parents waited for a long time for their babies, they were happy becoming parents of the newborns. The parents were very happy; the father said – now I am the proud father of 2 baby girls. He also said, “we are the happiest couple in the world today.”
