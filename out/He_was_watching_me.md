At 5 pm, my parents and brother left to go grocery shopping.

When they leave, I go to my room and hop on Fortnite with my friends on a voice call. I put my noise canceling headphones on and began to voice chat with them.

During the round, I spoke to my friends about an in-game enemy l.

"There's an enemy, I don't think he sees me."

"He is in the house with me."

"He is hurting me."

"I'm dead."

I played many rounds that night until my friends got tired of playing and hopped off at around 8 pm.

I sat on my chair for 30 more minutes watching youtube videos on my phone.

I stopped when I heard my mom call me to what I assume was to help her with the bags.

As I walk out of my room, I stumble over some paper that I assume my 4 year old brother tossed around.

I made my way to the front door, which was wide open. There were muddy footprints in the hallway.

My mom asked me why I left the door open.

I said that I didn't leave it open.

She told me to get out, and she called the police.

The police arive and search the house and don't find anyone. However, they find a stack of 4 papers just outside my room, as well as a fancy red ink pen.

This is what was written on the papers.

"I see you."

"I'm in your house."

"I will hurt you."

"You are going to die, not yet."

It was as if he was responding to me when I was talking to my friends.

There was stuff written on three papers commenting on me, what I was saying, even comments on the room and house.

But the last paper had a phrase written on it 57 times.

"Turn around, I want to see your face."

"Turn around, I want to see your face. "

It was written over and over again

The officers also showed me that the ink hadn't even had time to dry yet since when they rub their finger over it, the red ink smudged.

The police said that the person who broke in was most likely still in the house, so they told us it wasn't safe.

Me and my family traveled a few miles away to the nearest motel and spent the night there.

The police called my dad in the morning and told him to meet them at our house so he could go in and gather some essential stuff like clothes for us.

When he got there, he texted me.

There was a note on the front door in red ink.

It read:

"I didn't see you turn around, I didn't see your face. But the next time you turn around, I WILL SEE YOUR FACE."

I froze in shock and in fear.

So here I stand, on my phone, writing, hearing someone knock on the motel door, too scared to answer it."
