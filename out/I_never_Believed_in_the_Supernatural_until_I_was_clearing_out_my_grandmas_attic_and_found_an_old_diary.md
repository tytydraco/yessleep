TW: brief descriptions of potentially triggering/upsetting content.

  
This diary belonged to a ancestor of ours, and dated back to the late 1890s. The writing is in very neat cursive and so I had a hard time translating it to here, however I think I understood most of it. So here it goes. I’ve just picked several entries as there was a lot.  


June 6th 1897  


*‘Today was the first day of my new life, I’ve escaped the filth of Dxxxr, and start my education today. I was surprised to be offered a scholarship to such a prestigious medical school, even more so because I am a woman and we must not have the heart to deal with such gruesome sights! Ha how stupid! I will show them I am just as capable as the men!’*  


*‘I was late to my first class, the streets here are ever so hard to navigate, however I do like how my dress is not covered in mud all the time.*   


*The professor Dr Alexander was ever so melancholy if that is the correct terminology. He was performing a C- Section on a deceased lady, when a miracle occurred, the baby was still alive, I rushed down to wrap the babe in my jacket and smiled at him, but his face was just full of nothing, no happiness.*  


*But that was not all that happened and I start to think if it was all in fact a dream, but it was not. I got an awful pain in my chest halfway through, and blood stained my blouse. I have no idea what could have caused this as there is no wound.*   


*Then the most peculiar thing happened, at the end of the seminar I was spoken to by Dr Alexander and he told me I should change my blouse, covered in blood from both my mystery pain and the baby. He for some peculiar reason invited me into his office to give me a fresh shirt. As he handed it to me, he fell to the floor his hand upon his head in pain. At the same time I had that awful chest pain again, and even more blood seemed to soak my blouse, and I noticed that his white shirt too began to turn red.*   


*I asked him if there was anyone I could get to help him but he just snapped at me and said ‘it’s you! Leave now!’ and upon turning towards me his eyes were, and I’m afraid saying this might end me in the asylum.. but his eyes were completely black. ‘*  


She had mostly scribbled that last sentence out but I could just about make out what it said.  


I won’t post the full transcript of a few pages as they are rather detailed and disturbing, however I will give a brief run down on what was said. She says how she began to receive gifts, that were unexpected, but this was not of a major concern at the start. The issue arose when one of the gifts, a doll, began to smell, and upon inspection she revealed in the doll was a heart. A human heart. And that is not all, the eyes were human eyes. The teeth, human teeth. And they all had come from someone in her past who did her wrong. She knew who it was as on one of the front teeth, were her initials, carved into it, something the deceased man did when they were lovers. Wrapped around the heart was a letter in which it said this.  


*‘He took your smile away from you, so I took his, he broke your heart so I broke his, he couldn’t see how beautiful you were, so he does not deserve to see’*   


There was other stuff that was written however I’m not sure it’s appropriate, however this is what she said in her diary.  


June 31st 1897  


*‘I know who this is from and I’m utterly terrified and confused, Dr Alexander, I told him a few weeks ago that I was grateful for the home the school had provided, and had mentioned that I was just happy that bugs were not crawling in my mattress. In the letter he wrote ‘I’m glad that bugs will be crawling inside the piece of \*\*\*\* mans skull rather than in your mattress’ I had not mentioned this to anyone else, and maybe it is a coincidence but I have to confront him, you might be wondering why not report it to the police? I did but they just laughed and said they couldn’t do anything. This whole town seems backwards.’*  


*‘I confronted him and you know what the man did! And obviously it’s because of his guilty conscience! He threw me off the course. I have to return home now. To the streets that mean you can’t sleep without one eye open, my whole future gone’*  


Once again some of the next pages contain heavily triggering material and so I will not translate them here. Instead I will give another brief rundown. After being thrown off the course, and because she could not bear to return to her home town, she ultimately tried to take her own life and ended up in Shxxxxh Asylum. Where she wrote this.  


*‘I would not wish death upon anyone, as it could come back and lay its grasp upon the people you love, but I was once afraid to sleep with my eyes shut, fearing he may come to get me, but as I sit in this tiny bug ridden room, I realise that after I had let it sink in that he was no longer with us, I felt peace for once. No more fears of waking up to him with a g\*n to my head. Dr Alexander saved my mind, and although he is cold and melancholy, there’s something that draws me to him. I was trying to escape the darkness my whole life, but I seem to be falling back into its arms, but this time I feel at ease.’*  


She stayed at the asylum for no more than a week. Someone had got her out. Any guesses? Dr Alexander. As she left a carriage was awaiting her. She had two options, to get into the carriage or go back to her old life which although no longer had the man she was afraid of, it still haunted her.


The last pages of her diary were ripped out.   


But I for no particular reason but I’m glad I did peeled back the cover which had been glued back on and it said this.   


*‘Im not sure why I am even bothering to write this, for by the time anybody reads this I will be long gone, but I’ll continue. He is not entirely human, death houses itself inside him, an unnatural hybrid. Why was he so interested in me? Because to rid himself of this curse he has been given, and lived with for over two hundred years, he must fall in love with a mortal, and there was so many things he told me that I shall not write. But he has not felt anything positive for those years, just filled with hate, and I was his antidote. His love for me not being enough to beat his hate, and selfishness. I am in the process of turning into what he was. The kiss of death. Upon kissing me he transferred his curse. And soon death would have fully moved in. And I will be cursed to roam this earth until life no longer exists. The only way to ever truly get rid of death.’*
