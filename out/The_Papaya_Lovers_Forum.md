A few years ago, I stumbled across a lesser known forum similar to Reddit, that contained niche sub-forums for users who shared similar interests. The site was taken down shortly after I discovered it, and is still down to this day.

Looking back at my experience with one sub-forum, I can guess why.

I had just graduated college and was job hunting, still living in my parents' house. It was a pretty lonely time - most of my friends had moved away for work, and trying to make friends as an adult was hard in my area. I stumbled across an ad for the site, which said something about group meetups for locals with similar interests, so I clicked on it and started browsing. The site was split into sub-forums based on different interests, including politics, news, anime, cars, etc. Most of these sub-forums had a meetup thread where posters would arrange to meet IRL at bars or other public places. I didn't have much interest in most of those topics, but liked the idea of meeting a group of people just to hang out and have something to talk about.

One of the biggest sub-forums on the site was the 'Papaya Lovers' forum' with over 50K active members, which I found intriguing. For such a large sub-forum, it was in a very obscure part of the site and wasn't linked at the homepage. I had to scroll through most of the other forums and click a link in one thread to get to it. Out of all things, I had no idea papayas had such a large proportional fanbase. Taking a quick scroll through the threads, there were all sorts of papaya related posts.

*'How to grow papayas anywhere you live - a complete guide.'*

*'Ten creative papaya recipes you've got to try.'*

*'Growing your first papaya for beginners.'*

There was also a thread with details for a local Papaya lovers' meetup around half an hour's drive away from my place happening that next weekend. The schedule on the site showed how many were attending - twenty people, more than any other meetup thread on the other site sub-forums I'd come across.

I'd eaten a few papayas in my time, and they were alright - I'd rather talk about papayas than politics, I supposed. I registered for the meetup, hoping to have a chill social experience. I shot a message to the host, whose name was Ben, and he replied in a friendly manner.

*'Hey man, is this meet open to new people?'*

*'Hey, you're totally welcome, we meet new members all the time. There'll be drinks and snacks at the bar. Can't wait to see you there!'*

I set out that Saturday morning, and arrived at a nice looking bar at the other end of the city. Upon entering, I recognized Ben immediately at the other end, and went to greet him. He was talking to a group of about six people, with a few others talking in smaller groups next to them. Some had drinks in hand, and there was a pretty equal split of men and women, some in their twenties and others middle aged. There were a few much older folks too, again a fairly even distribution when it came to ages.

"Hey! Come join, here, have some cheese twirls," he said warmly, holding up a basket of them.

"Thanks, hey everyone, I'm Ross," I said, as I took one from the basket. Some people standing in the circle smiled at me, and said 'hey' back. I already felt the energy was friendly enough to crack a joke.

"Those cheese things are great, but where are the papaya slices?"

The strangers around me burst out laughing immediately, some hysterically. One woman put her hand over her mouth as she smiled, as if she'd just heard the most controversial joke ever. Ben scoffed and patted me on the back, shaking his head.

"Could you imagine? Good one, new guy."

I was a little taken aback by the over-the-top reception, but appreciated it. We introduced each other, made some small talk about family, work and whatnot. I felt comfortable, and it was all very ordinary conversation at first. Then we got to talking about papayas.

"I've been having some trouble growing 'em lately," said one lady.

"Yeah, it's always difficult," replied another. "Just gotta keep trying and they'll come eventually."

"Nah, you've just gotta know the right technique," said Ben. "Removing the seeds is the real hard part."

"Yeah," I chimed in, "I swallowed some once, they're really bitter."

Everyone suddenly stopped talking and looked at me. Even Ben turned towards me with a quizzical expression. Then some of them looked at each other. Had I said something wrong?

"It's, uh, surprising you can even grow them in this weather," I said.

It didn't help. They all kept staring at me, even more wide eyed. Suddenly it had gotten extremely awkward, and I had no idea why.

"Why is it surprising?" Asked Ben.

"Don't you need like, hot weather to grow them properly?" I asked, confused.

"Ah." Ben raised his eyebrows, then looked away. Two women in the circle sniggered to each other, and an old guy muttered something to a woman next to him under his breath. My face flushed red, my heart rate growing faster. I had no idea what I said, but it changed the mood completely.

"Anyways, let's change the subject. Anyone got any vacation plans?" Ben continued, after what seemed like the longest silence.

They talked about their vacation plans and other mundane stuff. I didn't speak for the rest of the night, and left feeling extremely awkward and outcast, but most of all confused. What had I said that was so controversial or offensive to ruin the atmosphere? Anyhow, I knew I'd never be going to that meetup again.

That night, I went home and took a look again at the sub-forum threads. Just the same over-enthusiastic titles about papayas. I clicked on the one titled 'Growing your first papaya for beginners'.

*'Growing your first papaya for beginners. A short guide by Jacqueline C.*

*This is no easy feat. I remember when I grew my first, I almost got caught. I know many of you will have had a similar experience, so this guide is for all of you that are apprehensive. Don't give up, and to motivate you, just think about how sweet victory will taste.*

*Picking a location where there aren't many other papayas around is key. It may seem obvious, but if you mess this one up, you'll stand no chance of success. Do some research on the one you're trying to grow - it shouldn't be very well known. Once you've identified the one, timing is crucial. Always take it somewhere where you are in control to start preparing it. If it doesn't work out first go, leave it be and don't keep trying. It's too risky.*

*Once you've grown the papaya in a secure location, you're halfway there. Clean the area where you grew it and the area you will be storing it in your home thoroughly to avoid contamination and detection. Wear gloves throughout. First cutting it into many pieces is key. There are many options for preparation tools that I have covered in a separate article, but anything large and well sharpened will do. Make sure to skin it and remove the seeds, and burn or dissolve them - this is key to avoid risk. Try to do this in a contained area, as they go off quickly during preparation. If the smell is too intense, you can use essential oils to mask it. Tape the gaps in your doors and windows. If it leaks juices during preparation, soaking surfaces it has leaked onto using vinegar can also help reduce the odors. Cook all pieces thoroughly to avoid diseases, and store uneaten pieces in the freezer. These tips should help you grow your very first, but they take practice and it'll get easier with time.*

*If anyone should come looking for it, do not admit to growing the papaya, ever. It's on them to prove anything, and if you've chosen the right one to grow, it should be difficult for them.*

*And finally remember, growing your first papaya can be a daunting process, but many people in our community grow and enjoy them successfully every day without trouble. If you learn the right steps, there's no reason you can't too. To learn more about how to choose the right papaya to grow and which ones to avoid, check out my last article.'*

I was starting to get an idea of why I had embarrassed myself earlier that night. One thing was for sure - whatever they were talking about, it was not papayas. I clicked on the link to the last article at the end of the page, but the website crashed. When I refreshed it, an error message popped up along with a notice.

*'This forum is no longer available on this site, as a result of a very recent incident. IYKYK. You can access us again through the Tor browser via search.'*

I didn't know what that message meant, or what 'recent incident' they were referring to, but figured something had taken them down. The site is still down, and doesn't show that message anymore - just an unregistered domain.

If it wasn't obvious from the article, then yes, I have a high suspicion 'growing papayas' was code for kidnapping people and eating them. No wonder they got taken down. I don't know if it was all one massive joke, but from that meetup, those conversations seemed serious enough, and it's pretty terrifying to think about possibly having been in a room full of cannibals, or wannabe cannibals. If that really was the case, then I'm glad I survived to tell the tale.

And I'm just glad the site's gone for good [now](https://www.reddit.com/user/latebutstillearly1/).
