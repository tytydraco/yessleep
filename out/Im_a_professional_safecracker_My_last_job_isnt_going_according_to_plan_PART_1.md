 When most people play “The Game,” they rarely recognize that sooner or later, “The Game” plays you. I tried to live by this rule by keeping my head down and taking fewer risks than my contemporaries, but now I’d become desperate. Desperation is the first step toward demise, and my ego convinced me I could leave the Game behind. All I needed was one final job.

My situation turned sour when Tucker Hall, a soldier in the Aryan Brotherhood, accused me of snitching to reduce my sentence. I served three years on a five-year sentence. Did everyone forget about good behavior? Tucker got himself caught for smuggling smack into the Pound. The Aryan Brotherhood doesn’t always recruit the sharpest minds. Still, the court of public opinion doesn’t need a unanimous jury to convict. My reputation was tainted, and my ass was in danger. Getting beaten to oblivion by a bunch of racist tweakers wasn’t exactly how I planned to check out of this world.

But now I’m sure there are things worse than death.

I’ve been in the Game since I was about fifteen. I broke into people’s cars and slowly worked my way up to burglarizing homes until I got pinched for the first time. I got a sappy judge, and she put me in a deferred prosecution program. All I had to do was find a trade to learn to avoid jail time. I found it strange that no one batted an eye when I chose locksmithing. I’ve been a safecracker ever since I graduated from trade school. By day, I helped people retrieve the keys they locked in their cars. By night, I cracked open treasure chests for thieves who couldn’t quite manage the lock. I had a nice little side business going for me until I got that damn DUI. .08% is not what it used to be anymore. 

No one wanted to give me work after my release, and I had a hunch that the AB would send some of their goons after me. I kept a stash in a lock box near the border and planned to hightail it to Eagle Pass, then hide at the first Mexican beach I could find. I was packing my things when a fixer named Paul gave me a ring and said he had a gig for me. He called it my “White Whale.” Whatever the hell that meant. Paul and I had worked on many jobs together, and I trusted him enough to at least hear what he had to offer.

“The job is simple,” Paul began. “Rumor has it that there’s an old safe in a vacated rental property on Holman drive. All you have to do is crack the safe and bring its contents to the client in Crystal City. Pretty convenient for a guy who’s about to skip town.” Paul winked at me. “The only catch is you have to get into the house yourself. The guy I wanted to handle the break-in flaked on me, so I hope you’re not too rusty.” I nodded, considering the terms. “How much is my share?”

Paul grinned, “50,000.”

I was astounded. Fifty grand was more than double my secret stash in Eagle Pass. It seemed too good to be true, but I trusted Paul and had no other options. I agreed to the job, glad to finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. I began making preparations immediately.

The target house was an ancient stucco Craftsmen with broken windows and a boarded-up front door. Graffiti covered almost every corner of the house. I snuck in through the back door and was greeted by a stench of mildew and neglect. Cobwebs were strewn across the walls, and animal droppings were scattered across the floor. “*How the fuck did anyone think to look here?”* I wondered. 

I searched every room but couldn’t locate the safe until I found a hatch in one of the bathrooms leading to the attic. I carefully crawled up the rotting ladder and pulled myself into the room. I knew that if I took one wrong step, I could plunge through the floors, so I shined my flashlight to see if I could find anything. Sure enough, in the back corner was a tiny key safe. I snagged it with my crowbar and then carried it down the stairs to my storage unit across town. 

The safe couldn’t have been more than two feet tall and, once dusted off, appeared to have been from the early 1900s. There was no way lock manipulation could work because the combination lock was too corroded to move.  I needed to drill, though I felt conflicted about ruining an antique. The safe, however, almost collapsed after I drilled even a tiny hole in it.

There was only one thing in the safe, a crumpled and unsealed manilla envelope. I thought it was strange that someone wanted to go through all this fuss for a crusty folder, but I had no authority to ask any questions. I put on gloves and carefully picked up the envelope, but its contents spilled on the floor. It looked like a photograph, but I couldn’t be sure.

I picked up the photo to inspect it and was surprised at how old it was. The picture was of a young girl who couldn’t have been older than fourteen. The girl had long, dark pigtails that almost hung to her waist. She wasn’t smiling in the photograph and almost looked like she was worried or even angry, like the last thing she wanted to do was take a picture. The girl was sitting on a chair, and a man was standing behind her. The man had his hand on the girl’s shoulder, but the photo was cut off where his head was supposed to be.

I flipped the photo on its back to find words written in faded black ink. *Martha and Headmaster Hawkins, 1912.* I was surprised at how old the image was and even more shocked that someone wanted $50,000+ for it. But I was never in the business of asking questions. 

Paul gave me a burner phone to call the client once I cracked the safe. The phone rang five times before a voice answered the phone. It didn’t sound human, more like one of those automated messaging systems. Each word had a different cadence to it.

“Do. *YOU.* ***Have****.* The*. Package?”* A feminine robotic voice droned.

“Uh…yes, the package is in my possession.” 

*“*Address*.* ***2****.*3*.*6*.5. Flower. Mound. Lane. Do. Not.* ***Delay****.”*

I hung up the phone and immediately got in my car. The drop-off was about six hours away, a drive I could make in my sleep. I floored it out of town as the early morning sun rose in the distance, hopeful that I was leaving behind my life. I didn’t dare to look back.

About halfway through the drive, I began to feel an odd sensation. It felt like a weird itchiness inside my skin, followed by pins and needles. At first, I thought that I must have gotten some fiberglass stuck in me from the insulation in that attic. But the itchiness was even more annoying, and there were occasions when I wanted to tear out my own skin.

My car was almost icy inside, and I could see my own breath. The A/C didn’t appear to be working, which was odd because I had recently fixed it. I scrunched tightly and shivered until my teeth began to chatter. It felt like I had the chills. I almost pulled over at a diner to get some hot tea but decided to soldier on.

Then the hallucinations came. It must have been a symptom of sleep deprivation, but I swore I heard faint breathing and sniffling like someone had just finished crying. I also thought I saw a reflection of a face I didn’t recognize in my rearview mirror. Faint whispering cascaded down the walls of my car, and I could barely make out what they were saying. But for a moment, it sounded like “*help”* or *“turn back.”* 

I finally reached Crystal City, feeling like my life had been sucked out of me. I called the number on the phone, and this time, a man answered. “Do you have the package?” The man croaked. His voice sounded almost wheezy. I responded in the affirmative, anxious to get this job over with. “Do not go to the drop-off location. There’s a place called the Riata Inn a couple blocks east. Rent a room there, and stay the night. We will conclude our business tomorrow.” I shook my head, “Why not today? I’m on a tight schedule here.”

There was a long pause before the man spoke again. “You were followed.”

I whipped around to see a silver Dodge Ram tailspin out of the parking lot, releasing a cloud of black smoke behind it. There was a large Confederate Flag sticker on the rear window. I knew exactly who that truck belonged to. How did I not notice I was being tailed? Was I losing my nerve?

The man spoke again. “We were told you were a professional. Handle the interloper, and then meet us at the drop-off tomorrow. I suggest you do not test our patience again.”

I drove to the Riata Inn, seeing the Dodge in my rearview mirror two cars behind mine. The truck belonged to Wayne “Crank” Watkins an enforcer for the AB and Tucker Hall’s cousin. Crank was one of the most diabolical people I knew. He stood over six foot five, and even years of abusing meth did nothing to take away from his gigantic frame. I once watched Crank gouge out a guy’s eye during a barfight. He was the guy you didn't want to run into in a dark alley. 

There was no doubt that skinhead prick was here to 86 me. Luckily, I had a bargaining chip up my sleeve. Crank was one of the greediest motherfuckers I knew, and all I had to do was sweeten the pot.

I quickly checked into my dingy motel room and waited for Crank to grace me with his presence. I sat on the bed and aimed my pistol at the door, just in case Crank wasn’t willing to listen to reason. After about fifteen minutes, the junkie was banging on my door.

“Housekeepin’!” A voice with a thick Texan accent rang out.

I rolled my eyes. “Crank! I know it’s you, bud. Got the drop on ya too.”

“Ah, shit!” I heard Crank mutter to himself before kicking a bunch of gravel in the parking lot.

“Wanna talk to you, Crank. Let’s not make any rash decisions. I can double whatever Tucker is paying you. You armed?”

“What do you think, motherfucker?”

“Well, can you at least hear what my offer is before you turn me into swiss cheese?”

I looked through the eyehole to see Crank rubbing his temple with a 9mm. “How much we talking here?” 

“Well, how much is Tucker paying you?”

“I asked you first, motherfucker.”

I paused to think, knowing Tucker probably offered less than five grand to have me iced. I was willing to let enough job money go to save my own skin.

“$10,000.”

“Damn son, you got 10 grand just fuckin’ lyin’ around?”

“I can get it to you tomorrow. I promise.”

“Well, that’s not a bad deal, I guess. Ok. Let me in so we can shake on it. It’s hotter than a crack pipe on payday out here!”

I slowly opened the door, only to have Crank kick it down. I soon found myself on my back with a gargantuan Neo-Nazi holding an ice-cold pistol to my temple. “You know I never liked you. You think you’re smarter than everyone else.” Crank smacked me in the face with his gun, closing my right eye shut. Blood ran down my face and into my mouth. “You betrayed your race by not answering the call to join us. Then you ratted out one of your own and skipped town? And now you have the gall to lowball me with TEN FUCKING GRAND?”

“That’s right, I paid old Paul a visit. Roughed him up real good too. He says you’re makin’ 50g’s on this job. Well, that’s my asking price to not put a bullet in your FUCKING BRAIN!” Crank then twisted my arm until I yelped in pain.

“Ok, deal! I’ll give you all of it if you let me go.”

Crank released me from his grasp and stood up. “Tomorrow. Or you’re fuckin’ dead.” He viciously kicked me in the stomach before vanishing out of my room. I let out a groan and pulled myself up into one of the beds before falling unconscious.

That night, I had the worst nightmare of my life. I dreamt of following a young girl through a maze, but I couldn’t catch up to her. The maze seemed endless, and the only light source was a full moon. Laughter filled my eardrums, and the temperature outside grew colder and colder until my face went numb. 

The girl led me to the end of the maze before turning around. I quickly realized it was the girl from the photo, only this time, she was faceless. An enormous dark circle rotated clockwise at the end of the labyrinth. It began inching closer toward me, swallowing everything in its wake. The intermittent laughter around me slowly turned into shrieking cries for help, and just before the circle consumed me, I woke up drenched in sweat. My heart was pounding, and there was a piercing pain in my head where Crank had pistol-whipped me. 

The door of my room was still wide open, and the night breeze slowly wafted in. I limped to close the door shut and rested my head on its cooled frame. I then began to feel odd again, like I wasn’t alone in my room anymore. The nagging itching splintered up my back and neck. The room started to get even colder, and I began to shiver again. 

*“Help me.”* A weak voice cried out from behind me.

I whipped around to see the girl from the photograph sitting on the other twin bed with her legs crossed. Her hair, still in pigtails, was tangled and unruly. Her tattered clothes were filled with moth bites, and black tears rained down her face.

*“Help….”* The girl cried out again.

I looked in horror, unable to move, as the girl slowly rose from the bed, her body twisting into inhuman contortions. She crawled toward me, wincing in pain with each step.

“*Don’t take me back to him. Release me. Please.”* I fumbled to open the door, but it was locked shut. I tried to open the window, but it didn’t budge. “*HELP ME!!”* the girl screamed as her body grew larger and larger until her head reached the ceiling. She then cried out in pain as her body began to be sucked into a dark shadow in the corner of my room. 

The shadow morphed into the silhouette of a man with a bowler hat on his head. Blinding white circles appeared where his eyes were supposed to be, and the shadow revealed a toothy grin of jagged teeth. 

I woke up again, realizing that my nightmare had multiple layers. The door to my room was now closed, and I barely had time to collect my thoughts before my body began to ache. The clock read 8 am. I reached for my burner phone and called the client.

“Has the problem been dealt with?” The man asked.

“Yes, well, sort of. I’m ready to deliver the package.”

“Do not delay.” The man said before hanging up.

I drove to the original drop-off location, texting Crank that I was about to get his money. The meet-up was at an old ranch-style house with a chain link fence. I walked to the front porch, envelope in tow, to meet with the client. 

An older man answered the door, peering out to make sure no one was following me. “Come inside.” He led me to the living room, where we sat at a small poker table. The man had to have been in his sixties, and I don’t mean to sound insensitive, but he looked to be part indigenous. A white ponytail was wrapped around his leathery face, and he wore a Southwestern-patterned shawl. 

“I see your confrontation was violent.” the man said, taking note of the bruises on my face and my busted lip.

“I’ve been through worse,” I responded.

“So you have the package?”

“Yeah. Are you the client?”

The man sighed with contempt. “No. I am His representative on all business matters. Why do you ask?”

“Oh, no big deal. It’s just the price seems a little generous for a dusty old photograph.”

The man’s coal-black eyes grew wide, and his glare burned through my skull. “You were not to open the package.” The man said through gritted teeth.

“It was open when I cracked the safe. Slid right out of this envelope.”

“I see. Well, I will retrieve your payment now.”

“You still haven’t answered my question. $50,000 for a crusty picture?”

The man seethed. “You should know by now that it is not just a simple photograph.”

I froze, thinking about all the strange things that had happened since the photo was in my possession. “Then what is it? Just who is this client?”

The man nervously looked around the corner. “You are inquisitive for a thief. The affairs of my Master are of no concern to you. Your payment is in the kitchen. Shall we go?”

I should have given him the photo and left with the money, but something told me not to. Besides, I had a sneaking suspicion that Crank was going to off me anyway once I gave him the cash. I was a man with nothing to lose.

Or so I thought.
