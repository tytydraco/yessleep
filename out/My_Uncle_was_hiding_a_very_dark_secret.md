I was never close to my Uncle Graham. He was one of those relatives who existed more in photos than real life - always the distant, eccentric one. He lived alone in Northumberland, in a draughty stone house tucked into a fold of moorland, the kind of place you'd miss unless you were looking for it.

When he died suddenly - heart attack, they said - my mum asked if I'd go up and help sort through his things.

No one else had the time. I was between jobs, recently dumped, and in the mood to disappear. So I said yes.

The house was three miles from the nearest village, and even that barely had a shop. The drive in was long and grey, the moors stretching out endlessly, a sea of rust-coloured grass under a pale sky. The cottage appeared like a secret - squat, symmetrical, with ivy curling up its flanks.

The postman had left a note tucked in the door: "Sorry to hear about Mr. Bishop. Very private man."

Inside, everything was tidy but impersonal. No family photos, no clutter. Just books, old maps, and a strange number of locks - on cupboards, interior doors, even the fridge.

I started in the attic, thinking I'd get the hardest bit out of the way. Boxes of letters, neatly labelled.

Receiptsfrom the 1980s. Meticulously catalogued weather reports. The man was obsessive. I began to get the impression he wasn't just eccentric - he was hiding something.

On the second night, I heard a noise.

It was subtle at first. A thud, like something falling downstairs. I assumed a book or a stack of papers had shifted. The wind, maybe. But then it came again - heavier. Purposeful.

I crept out of bed, half-naked, clutching a fireplace poker. The hallway was dark. I stood listening, heart thudding, trying not to breathe too loud.

Silence.

I checked every room. Nothing disturbed. No windows open. No obvious cause.

Still, I couldn't sleep. Not properly. I left the landing light on like a child.

The next day, I noticed something odd.

Behind a shelf in the pantry - a section of wall that sounded hollow. I pulled the shelf aside and found a narrow door. Locked, of course. I searched the house for keys, eventually finding a ring in an old biscuit tin under Graham's bed.

When I opened the door, the smell hit first. Not rotting, exactly - just... old. Damp. Like earth and stone that had been left to stew. The door led to a small passage, and beyond that, a second cellar I hadn't known existed.

This one was different. Stone walls. No light. Chains bolted into the floor and walls. A heavy metal ring in the centre of the room, like a tether point.

It wasn't a wine cellar.

It was a cell.

And worse - there were scratch marks. Deep grooves in the stone. Nails embedded in the floor. I staggered back, hand over my mouth.

I didn't sleep at all that night.

By the fourth day, I was paranoid.

I started keeping my mobile on me at all times. Every creak in the house made me jump. I rang my mum and asked if Graham had ever been in trouble - with anyone. The police, neighbours, anything.

She said, "Graham? No. Quietest man alive. Didn't even own a telly."

When I told her about the hidden cellar, she went silent.

"You're not joking?"

"No."

"You should leave," she said, voice tightening.

"I want to find out what he was hiding."

"He wasn't right. Your dad always said he came back from the Falklands different. Used to stay up all night staring at the window. Said he'd seen things people shouldn't."

"What kind of things?"

She just repeated: "Leave it alone, Mark."

That night, I didn't go to bed. I made a pot of tea, sat in the kitchen with the poker next to me, and waited.

Around 2 a.m., it came again.

Footsteps. From the hallway.

I stood slowly and opened the door.

Nothing.

But the air felt wrong. Heavy. Charged.

I walked the house. Front to back. Still nothing.

Then I noticed the trapdoor to the main cellar - the second cellar - was open.

I hadn't opened it.

With shaking hands, I descended the ladder. The torch beam flicked over boxes, crates, old tins - and something else. The wall at the back had been smeared with something. Not paint.

Letters.

Three letters, crudely drawn:

"RUN."

I finally called the police.

A young copper came out, clearly unimpressed.

"I know this place," he said, stepping out of the patrol car. "Your uncle used to report trespassers. Said kids

from the village were breaking in at night. We never found anything. He boarded the place up himself a few times."

"I found a hidden room."

He raised an eyebrow. "That so?"

I showed him the cellar. He looked disturbed, but didn't say much. Took some photos. Promised to file a report. Told me it was probably "historic" - something left from long before Graham's time.

I didn't buy it.

That evening, I made a fire, packed a bag, and decided I'd leave in the morning.

But curiosity got the better of me.

I went back to the attic. Among the maps, I found a journal. Dated just six months before Graham died.

Most of it was ramblings. Notes about "shadows in the fog," "them watching," "hearing breathing that wasn't mine." But then, a passage:

"I trapped it. Years ago. When it followed me home. Thought it was a curse, but I began to understand.

It wasn't trying to kill me. It wanted to be seen. To be remembered. It only took those who ignored it. That was the pattern."

I turned the page.

"I've kept it down there ever since. When it gets loud, I read to it. When it gets quiet... I worry."

I didn't sleep. I stayed on the sofa, lights on, knife from the kitchen in my lap.

The house stayed silent.

Too silent.

I nodded off just before dawn.

When I woke, the front door was wide open. The bag I'd packed was gone. So was the journal.

I ran outside, barefoot, shouting.

Only the moors answered.

The police searched again. Still found nothing. No signs of break-in. No note. No forced entry. They assumed

I'd just forgotten to lock up. Took my statement and left me with a leaflet on stress-related hallucinations.

I left that day. Couldn't stay. Couldn't even finish sorting the house. Left the keys with a solicitor and drove back to London like the devil was on my tail.

I've been back a week now.

Two months later, I got a call.

It was the solicitor who'd been handling the property. He sounded rattled.

"There's a bit of a situation," he said. "You'll want to hear this in person."

I didn't want to. But I went.

The house had been sold. A retired couple from Essex, apparently. Wanted a peaceful getaway, somewhere remote. They moved in mid-January.

They were gone by March.

Vanished.

No signs of struggle. No note. No forced entry. Their car was still in the drive, wallets on the kitchen table.

Allt he doors locked from the inside.

Police found the house pristine - except for one thing.

In the cellar - the second one - someone had written something on the wall in soot.

A single sentence:

"He stopped reading to me."

They assumed it was graffiti, probably teenagers who broke in after the couple went missing.

But here's the thing that bothers me - and I mean really bothers me.

The cellar had been bricked up. Completely sealed. Builders had done it during the sale process. I saw the plans. I signed off on them.

The wall had no cracks. No holes. No gaps in the mortar.

And yet that message was written on the inside.

I told the police everything. About the hidden door, the chains, the journal, the sounds at night.

They looked at me like I'd lost my mind.

I went home, drank too much, slept even less.

The next morning, I drove back out there. I don't know why. Maybe guilt. Maybe curiosity.

The house was still sealed off with police tape. Empty again. As if no one had ever lived there at all.

I walked around it slowly, scanning the windows.

In the upstairs bedroom - the one that had been Graham's - something caught my eye.

There was a smudge on the inside of the glass.

Not dirt. Not condensation.

A handprint.

Small. Almost childlike.

Pressed from the inside
