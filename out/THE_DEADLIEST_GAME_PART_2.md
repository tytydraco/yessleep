Have you ever been dropped on a deserted island with a bunch of other professional serial killers?  Have you ever been told to kill or be killed, as gambling entertainment for the world's wealthiest elites?  

That was the disturbing reality I was now facing, and I didn't like it one bit. 

The host of this twisted reality show had told us that the boundaries of the battlefield would shrink every hour, and that anyone caught outside of them would be killed by drones.  That prompted me to move quickly, continuing on a line straight towards the heart of the island.  But I guessed that everyone else would be doing the same thing.  

It was our only chance at survival, after all.  Like a real life game of Fortnite, we had to stay within the bubble or we'd get popped.

“Psst,” I heard a whisper coming from nearby, and pulled out my knife, getting ready to thrust it into someone’s jugular if necessary.  

“Whoa.  Where’d you get that nasty-looking blade?  Hey, I surrender, cowboy.  You got me beat.”

A scrawny guy with a short, scruffy beard hopped down from a nearby tree branch where he’d been hiding.  His clothing was covered with branches, mud, and leaves, and he’d been invisible to my eyes, even after I’d heard him speak.  I’d never seen anyone with such amazing camouflage abilities.  

He came forward to shake my hand and I backed away slightly, turning my body in a defensive posture.  My fist was gripping the knife very tightly, and he looked down at it, his eyes nervous for the first time.  

“Sorry,” he said, raising his hands in the air as if I were pointing a gun at him.  “I didn’t mean to startle you.  It’s just…”

He looked around nervously.  

“This is crazy, right?  I mean, this dude kidnaps us and expects us to kill each other because he says so?  Fucking rich people, man.”

Despite his unassuming nature, I was still suspicious.  

“A hundred million dollars is a lot of money,” I said.  “That kinda money makes people do some stupid shit.  Like killing each other.  Trust me, I’ve seen it done for a lot less.”

He raised one eyebrow, then smirked.  

“Oh, shit.  You’re the contract killer, aren’t you?  I saw your face up there, but, man, when there’s twenty of the baddest mother fuckers on the planet up there you kinda get lost in the mix. No offense.  I’m sure you’ve seen plenty of action.  How many bodies have you buried?”

I didn’t say anything.  Instead, I continued walking towards the center of the island, leaving him behind.  There was no time for talking.  And if he wasn’t going to make a move, neither was I.    

“What?  Ain’t you gonna kill me?”

“Why bother?  Somebody else will do it.”

He laughed, and I heard the faint sound of clothing as it rustled and shifted, and I knew he was reaching for something.  

“Yeah, you’re probably right about that.  Bunch of stone-cold killers on this island.  We’re all gonna get ours sooner or later…  Except for one of us, that is...”

I spun with the knife blade in my hand, pinched between my thumb and forefingers.  As he squinted one eye shut and began to squeeze the trigger of the gun he was holding, I was already letting go of the knife, sending it sailing through the air.  It landed hilt-deep in his eye socket with a wet THUNK sound.    

The point of the knife blade disappeared into his skull as his left eye opened wider in surprise for a brief second, and then he fell limply to the ground, not even getting one shot off.  

Poor bastard.  Nobody wants to be the first one voted out in a reality show.  It's humiliating.

I cleaned off the knife blade and wandered over to the body, bending over to pick up the gun.  A compact Glock 19 with a 33 round magazine.  

"Will you look at that," boomed a voice in the sky, and I realized it was the host of this twisted game.  "We just had our first encounter, ladies and gentlemen!  And what a doozy it was!  Congratulations to our underdog.  I wasn't expecting that, I'll be honest.  But you've got a long way to go!  Nineteen of you remain in the game.  Good luck."

It didn’t really hit me for a few more minutes how close I’d just been to dying.  If my knife hadn’t hit its mark or if I’d been a little slower, I would have wound up with a bullet through my skull.  

I wasn’t just dealing with unsuspecting victims anymore.  Now I was competing with the best of the best.  Trained soldiers, commandos, and assassins more deadly than anything the world has ever seen before.

After searching the body and finding nothing else of consequence, I moved on.  Heading deeper into the forest, I saw something up ahead that looked like a building in the distance.  Rain clouds were moving in, and thunder and lightning could be heard with it, and I decided to seek shelter there.  But others would be heading that way as well.  I had a funny feeling about that.  

That was something I would just have to deal with.  

“Time is up, everyone,” the host of the Deadliest Game called out from all around.  I looked up to see his face in the sky, through the tree branches where dead-eyed birds sat watching.  

“Better get to where you’re going quickly.  The boundaries are shrinking, and you don’t want to be left outside in the rain!  Trust me.  It’s nasty stuff.”  

A few drops began to splatter and fall on my arms and I felt them burning where they struck my skin.  Each raindrop hissed like acid and I watched with horror as my flesh began to sizzle.  

Acid rain.  Classic.  

I ran even faster, getting closer to the building in the distance and seeing that it was a massive tower which rose high up into the sky.  At its center was a pillar that looked to contain further floors of a skyscraper the likes of which I had never seen before.  It was like a mountain constructed of steel and glass - it dominated the skyline as I emerged into the wide clearing from the forest.  

My head craned up to take in the impossible height of the structure, built out here on this island in the middle of nowhere, but looking like it belonged in a metropolis like New York or Chicago.

There was suddenly a loud noise like machine gun fire in the distance, from more than one source.  At least two or three, if not more.  And then a loud, piercing boom silenced them one by one, as a sniper with a bolt-action rifle took them out.  It sounded like he was a very good shot, whoever he was.  

"Eighteen, seventeen, sixteen!  Bravo, sir!  Bravo!" Called the baritone voice from the sky with giddy enthusiasm.  

Acid rain was now pouring down from above as I ran out from the forest.  I stayed close to the trees which grew outside of its boundaries.  My path was serpentine and I kept my head low, leaving myself exposed as little as possible as the tower got closer.  But it was still so far away.  I hadn’t realized how massive the building was at first, and like a mountain in the distance it was taking a long while to get to it.  

I looked back to see that coming from behind was the wall of a massive blue-tinged dome, shrinking and growing smaller by the second.  

If I ended up on the other side of that wall, drones from the sky would shoot me dead in an instant.  

Not only that, but I had other matters to worry about too.  

Every second I remained exposed was another opportunity for that sniper to catch me with a bullet.  And for the acid rain to melt my flesh.  I saw my skin was drooping and sagging in places, like melted candle wax, and guessed that my face looked the same.  I would be a hideous, disgusting creature by the time I escaped the island at this rate.  Assuming I ever actually managed to escape.  

A sound like a bee zipping past my ear made me jump as I felt blood trickle down my cheek a moment later.  

Fuck.  The sniper.  He had me in his sights.  

I had no choice but to dive quickly behind a large patch of foliage.  Once there, I hunkered down behind a tree and waited, watching as my clothes sizzled and the acid rain scorched my flesh.  

Another bullet impacted the tree and the sound of a gunshot in the distance could be heard a moment later.  Judging by the brief delay, it meant the shooter wasn’t far away.  

I could make a run for it, but it would be risky.  

But then I realized I didn't need to make a run for it.  All I had to do was wait.  

The dome was getting smaller by the second, and it looked like the tower was at its center.  Which meant everyone would be going that direction.  And the sniper would have to head that way as well.  It was only a matter of time.

I waited and listened as shots rang out and one by one my competition fell dead from the sniper's bullets.  He had found a good spot, whoever he was.  He liked to camp, and he wasn’t moving.  

"Fifteen!  Fourteen!  Thirteen!  Twelve!"

The voice of the sadistic host called out each death like a Powerball number.

Finally, the dome was so close I could hear the buzzing electric sound of it, narrowing the gap inch by inch.  On the other side, I saw a man running towards me, until he was vaporized in an instant - blown to pieces by a missile which flew down from the sky above.

“ELEVEN!”

That was about as far as I was willing to push it.  

I got up and began to run, hearing the static-hiss of the translucent blue dome closing in behind me as I bolted through the clearing.  

The sniper had given up his spot as well, I realized, and saw he was now running the same direction as I was, about a hundred yards away from me.  The two of us were running for our lives, stealing nervous glances at each other occasionally, as if sizing each other up.  

But there was no time to stop and kill one another, as the blue dome was closing in fast.  It was at my heels as I ran at full tilt, sprinting through the pain of a stitch in my side, as it grew into a terrible cramp in my belly that begged me to stop.  

I grit my teeth and stared at my feet as I ran, begging them to continue, knowing what would happen if I let up my pace for even an instant.  

The blue dome’s hiss of static could be heard so close now it was like a mosquito buzzing in my ear, tickling the back of my neck as it got ready to overtake me.  It felt unpleasant and wrong when the blue holographic projection hit my skin, as if a low voltage of electricity were being carried through it.    

Up ahead, I saw we were headed for a steep drop-off.  Not quite a cliff, but not quite a ditch, it appeared we would be falling more than ten or fifteen feet towards a rocky embankment if we didn’t slow down.  

And neither one of us was about to slow down.  

We both ran off the ledge at full speed, just as the dome stopped closing in.  The blue wall of light froze at the top of the ledge as we tumbled down the slope, pinwheeling and crashing into boulders and rocks. 

Hitting my head, I felt a lightning bolt of pain go through my skull, before the entire world went black and fell away completely.  

I woke up a few minutes later, realizing with horror that I had been knocked unconscious during the fall.  But to my great surprise, the sniper was gone.  He had not taken the opportunity to kill me, and neither had anyone else.  

Maybe he didn’t want to kill an unconscious man, just to prove he’s better than me, I thought to myself bitterly.  To prove he has honor.  

Ironic, since I wound up in this place due to the fact that I was prepared to kill an old man in his sleep for money.  And I’d been doing such things for a long, long time.  

Perhaps I needed to re-examine my life.  Perhaps I really did need to retire.  Before I lost what was left of my soul.  

Struggling to my feet, I looked around and saw there was nobody nearby.  My destination stood clearly in the distance, even more obvious now that the blue dome had shrunk so significantly.  

That structure was at the very center of this place, it was obvious.  Everyone would be headed there.  And whoever was left alive would be the best of the best.  

I wasn’t out of danger yet.  Not by a long [shot.](https://youtu.be/rumiJJyA2FM)
