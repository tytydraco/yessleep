Adolescence is stereotyped to be the rebelling phase, when the children act up, refuse their parents’ requests, slave away at their screens past their bedtimes, all the sort. I was different. Or I thought I was different. That misconception crumbled when I found myself in front of the TV at 3 AM.

It felt more of a crime than a personal guilt trip. When it's a guilt trip, I would feel bad doing it. But a crime, something about it made it more compelling. Mind you, I wouldn't dare commit a law breaking crime, but watching TV early in the morning isn't really breaking cable laws. They'd appreciate me more, rather, being that I was such an avid consumer. 

Why was I doing this? Well maybe, it had something to do with my mom getting me grounded. TV, as per my parents, was to not be kept on after 9 PM. The new series I started watching during the summer vacations went on until 9:15. You'd think it to be common courtesy that the extra time be allowed. But no. Parents hate feeling out of control. 

I spoke back, of course, right to their faces. The episode was approaching a twist—I could feel it. I wasn't the only one waiting on for today's episode, all my classmates had planned to watch it too. I knew that Tiffany was watching it, totally invested in the story. Sorry, I can’t help myself.

So when my parents had me shut it down, I was distraught. Words blathered while leaving my jaw. I felt out of breath, as if my oxygen supply had been poached. I felt betrayed. Why had the two of you conceived me if not to perceive the lushness of colorful entertainment? Before I knew it, I was on the floor, in disbelief.

If I had pleaded to watch only that remaining bit of it, I might have been granted the luxury. But I had to live up to the teenage stereotypes—all my friends did. So I tweaked my pitch a little over the kilter, somewhere between a whisper and a shout. That was enough to get me grounded—no screen time for a whole dreaded week.

The prospect of missing an entire week's worth of “Tim and Tady” was enough a reason for me to commit this crime. At our side of the county, episodics stayed as recordings for a period of 24 hours if you had scheduled for them to be recorded. I had. Now, all I had to do was sneak out of my bed, tiptoe down the stairs, and take my place comfortably on the couch with the remote. Yep—that easy. I should've known.

The first step was unbedding myself. I sat propped up, waiting for the clock to hit 3. How would I know, in a dark room, if the clock hit 3? I wouldn't. But I hoped. Just as the clock hit a tick louder than the ones before it, I spared little to no time to spread my feet off the bed. Creak. The brittle bed moaned. I paused, expecting the lights outside to go out and for two very expecting and angry adults marching in. But no, a full five minutes later, no one came. I was safe. Right?

I jumped off the bed, yet again, a creak sounded. This time from the wooden sheet boards below, comprising the length of my room’s floor. I located my slippers very articulately. They were near the door. I pitter-pattered to the barely visible doorknob. One hand on the said knob, I slid into my fluffy slippers, nudging the knob clockwise to open it. A very slow, painful, and guttural, pervasive screech grumbled as the door moved open. The noise made me feel concussed, though I’ve never had a concussion. Parents buying homes tactfully knowing that we would try to sneak around might be the pettiest thing they do. What should a teenager do to get privacy around here?

Yet again, I waited. No lights snapping on through the door’s crack, no heated arguments of how badly they’ve raised me, and no talk about divorce. I was in the clear. Spilling the door open wide, I looked left, to the dark hallway leading to my parents room, and then to the right, at the dark stairwell that led down to the TV. I felt it calling to me from below seductively, the TV—it's box blinking red as if winking at me to approach.   
  
I took a deep breath, analyzing the regret-slash-getting-caught ratio, and concluded that I didn't know math. You couldn’t make me solve algebra even if the game's period depended on it.  Eventually, I made up my mind—I was going to sit through all fourteen minutes of the missed episode.  
  
Floating down the stairwell like a helium balloon, I made sure to tap each step twice, portending their squeakiness, fearful of getting caught now, so close to my goal. None squeaked. Our stairwell extended from the walls, with nothing below to support them. Every day, we tread up and down them, yet they don’t budge. Even now, they stayed staunch to their architect. Must've meant I was awake, for they refused to follow the rules of physics as usual. They were almost an exception to the physics I knew of. Weren’t exceptions a chemistry thing? 

The lightless hall was blinding in all of its darkness. Was this 3 AM TV thing an obligation needing fulfillment? No. Will I go through with it anyway? Yes. I said to myself—I was going to watch this episode, and that too, right now.

The clock ticked louder in the empty room, the echoing ticks bouncing off the couches, the coffee table, the flower vases, the TV rack, and most of all, its own frame. But I didn't mind it. It gave me a benchmark to maintain in the noise department. No more than -2 billion dBs of sound. Walking around the couch to its optimal seating position, I took my seat, facing the blank screen of the TV. The remote? Where was the remote? I knew my parents would try to seal it away, so I stashed it between the couch’s cushions. I had put a bar of soap under a cloth on the TV mantel, in case they suspected. I had outsmarted not only two adults, but both of my parents.   
  
I felt proudly satisfied, a feeling that would’ve lasted had the only channels available at 3 AM not been static. The recorded section was empty. What was going on? Where was my recorded episode? Did mom delete it? Did they, instead, outsmart me?   
  
I waited with baited breaths, readily expecting my parents to switch on the lights and jump out from behind the walls, making fun of my elaborate plans. Or, at the least, begin arguing like normal. But the more I waited, the more I began to feel…cold. The fans were off, and I hadn’t switched on the A/C. It was cold, like the insides of a fridge. Had the refrigerator door stayed open? No…that would be absurd, right? It was cold.   
  
That's when it happened. The static continued to strobe the hall in its light, enough to give an epileptic, seizures. Hair on edge from the low temperature, I had nothing to do but…stare. Into the strobing lights of the static TV. I tried shifting channels, but every single one of them was the same—static. I was about ready to cry, when finally, I found a working channel.   
  
Channel 402. The only channel with media playing. I was ecstatic, I had found something to replace my unsatiated purpose. A black and white video was being set up on it. I clicked the remote’s OK button to check the media’s name. Usually, the video would pause, and the details about it would rise up from below the screen. Yet, as I pressed the button for what seemed minutes, the video did not stop.    
  
I tried shifting the channels again, but it didn’t work. I suspected dead batteries, but I knew better than that. I had to watch it. I had no other options.  
  
The video began with two men talking, one was the camera man. The other was a well suited man, younger than my father, with a crooked nose. The subject of their talk was some house. They were planning to break into it, something around the lines of stealing. It was a burglary, I thought. A fun subject to make a documentary on. I wouldn’t be watching this otherwise, documentaries are more of my dad’s thing.   
  
I continued watching the video, interested in its early premise. The sky was black. It was night in it, too. A small timestamp to the right corner read “3:02 AM” within the video. That's how I knew the exact time, which I couldn’t have known otherwise, as I sat in the dark.  
  
They had begun walking past trees, bushes, shrubs, sneaking around the densely packed suburb. The victims of their burglary were supposed to be a wealthy family that stood out from the rest. The two people in the video were whispering, so, many of the details went past me. I had knocked the sound level to 5, knowing that any level over that would cause my parents to wake up like resurrected mummies. Either way, knowing that pushing it up just a bit wouldn’t hurt, I still refrained from doing so.   
  
The two people escaped the forested pathway, now reemerging behind a white washed wall. The wall belonged to their target’s house, they declared quietly. Climbing upon a weeded ridge behind the house, the well suited man faced the camera as he giggled. His feet were on loose ground. He slipped. I could feel his soul leave his body as he breathed a short, quiet scream. That's when it first happened.  
  
A clatter of pebbles outside my balcony window made me jump off the couch. My head dazed on the balcony, from where the sounds came from. The clattering of pebbles seamlessly died down. I kept staring, shifting my gaze across the balcony’s slider, waiting for the sounds to resume. Must’ve been a dog, I reassured myself. The video’s format had somehow begun to get to me.   
  
Hesitant that it wasn’t just a dog, I attempted to get back into the video. The well-suited man was now talking to the camera man, making hand signs as he did. The camera shook as the recorder spoke, his voice agitated. Were they fighting? I had watched enough of my baby videos to know that cameras shake when two people argued. The suited man rubbed his forehead, looking straight into the camera. His eyes glinted on the lens, as if made of lights.   
  
My father once had me watch an animal documentary about tigers hunting down their prey. They were stealthy, fast, and most of all, hungry. He told me, when I asked him about the tiger’s shining eyes, that they were a sign of a seasoned predator. He laughed it off when I looked at him all serious, and I laughed with him too, a little later. I regret knowing that now, what he told me back then.  
  
I was sitting with my knees to my chin. Sweat had begun to pool up near my groin, leaving my forearms in the frozen air. It didn’t bother me all this time, but now that the two men just stood there outside the target’s house, waiting for something, I had begun to lose interest. And so, I became aware of the sweat. The discomfort that followed after realising it was unbearable. I stretched my legs forward, hoping the cool in the air would find its way into my pants, drying the sweat off. I was a mess. Even in the cold, I had sweat on my forehead.  
  
The sweat wasn’t drying. Frustrated, I stood up, standing with my legs wide. I oscillated from side to side, thinking that my movements were generating enough wind to work as a dryer. That’s when it happened again.  
  
The two men in the video had started talking again. Their wait was maybe…over. The two men then began walking down the ridge, taking support of the white wall. A few seconds later, the camera man came into view, his reflection grew on the balcony’s glass sliders. Curtains lay spread behind the glass sliders, so the camera man’s reflection was clearer. He was big. Tall, muscular. His shoulder was exposed, covered in black, dried ink. Tattoos. If I knew without doubt that I wasn’t hallucinating at 3 at night, I’d say that the camera man was…smiling.   
  
I yawned, my eyes dawdled to my right. That's where my house’s balcony was. My mouth stayed open. At 3:21 AM, I saw a shadow on the window curtains. The camera man began to speak, gritting his smiling teeth while doing so. The two of them had stopped their whispering. I heard the words they spoke very clearly now, as if they stood right outside my house.   
  
At first, I thought it was an echo effect, a defect in the audio of the media. But I soon realized that their words weren’t being repeated twice—there was a lag between the broadcast and the outside of my house. They...were outside my house.  
  
I went up to my parents’ room 20 minutes ago. They weren’t there. The room smelled like fish, but they weren’t there. I grabbed my phone from their cupboard, unlocking their safe to get it while slipping over the red liquid drowning the floor boards. I’ve waited in the bathroom without switching the lights on for an hour now. I don’t know what became of the two intruders that broke into my house 5 minutes ago, I don’t know if they’ll find me. They knocked on the windows first, and then broke through them. I tried dialing the police, but I felt that I shouldn’t speak to them…the two outside would hear me.   
  
I…I think they're getting close. I can hear their breaths outside the bathroom door. I don’t know what happened to my parents. I hope they’re fine. I couldn’t understand why they left two red pillows under the red blankets. I thought it was them at first, but it couldn’t be.   
  
The pillows didn’t move.   
  
My parents move.   
  
The two people outside move, too.   
  
I must wake up—  
  
Help me.
