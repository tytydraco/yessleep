Now that I'm holed up in my house with the doors blocked, I think I can get this out. 

Let me start off by saying that I've somehow managed to live 28 years without being able to hold a successful conversation. You'd think I'd have caught on by now, but nope, I still sound like an alien talking to a human being for the first time. 

As a result of my social ineptitude, I'm a bit of a loner. I am not great at forging relationships outside of work, and I have no idea who my birth parents are. To put it simply, I've come to the harrowing realization that I'm someone that no one would miss if I disappeared. 

I would be lying if I said that wasn't my primary motivation for risking my life to post this. I don't have anyone in real life to go to for help. I'm completely alone in this world. 

The incident that led to me getting to this point centers around the new IT guy. I met him when I had to make hard copies of my lab reports. For context, our copier is from the early 2000s and it works whenever it wants to. He had the ancient thing all taken apart, as if he were performing surgery on it. Unsuccessful surgery, at that. 

I tried to say something normal: "I know that the copy machine sucks, but violence isn't the answer." 

It must've worked because he chuckled. When he turned to face me I saw that he was wearing sunglasses. That should've been my first clue that something was "off" about him, but one thing you need to understand is that the lab has what I like to call "morgue lighting:" they're the kind of lights that instantly trigger headaches in people unlucky enough to have sensory issues. Sure, wearing sunglasses inside is kind of extreme, but maybe he was even more photosensitive than I am. 

He joked that the copier's funeral would be on Wednesday before informing me that it would be a few hours, saying something about a processor going bad. I resolved to try again later and went back to work. All in all, our first interaction was fairly normal, and I silently applauded myself for getting what I would consider a Good Grade in Conversation. 

The second time I saw the IT guy, it was in the break room a few nights later. The break room was completely empty while I was getting my first meal of the day... at midnight. Being on nights has made a mess of both my sleep schedule and appetite. 

I jumped out of my skin when I heard someone say, "Dinner of champions, I see." 

The IT guy was leaning against the counter, drinking from a thermos, eyes still covered by sunglasses. When did he get there? How did I not hear the door open? Maybe I was so sleep deprived that I simply didn't notice that he was there.  

I said something stupid about being a health nut first and a human second as I burnt my tongue on my Cup O' Noodles. He raised his thermos and informed me that coffee was his dinner. It was uncomfortably silent for a moment. I twirled my noodles, chest tight with awkwardness until I finally thought of something to say, "So, uh, is the copier alive?" 

IT guy sipped at his thermos again before replying that it belonged in a dumpster. I responded that I lived in a dumpster and could hook him up, then immediately regretted it. He smiled and made an equally cringey joke about living in the walls, which made the knot in my chest lessen a bit. 

It was oddly comforting to talk to someone as socially inept as I am. We continued to make awkward conversation about equally unimportant topics and for the first time in a while, I didn't feel like a complete loner. 

I even let myself be naïve enough to think that maybe I could actually make a friend, for once. 

So for a while, that's how it went: we'd make small talk in the break room or whenever we ran into each other. Besides the sunglasses and the way he seemed to just appear out of thin air sometimes, he seemed like a nice enough guy with an odd sense of humor. 

Where things took a turn was yesterday. I get off of work at 3 am and the way to my house is full of back roads. It's not unusual for me to see my headlights catching the reflection of eyes in the darkness on the side of the road. Just deer, raccoons, and coyotes. Welcome to the Midwest. 

Where things get weird is that there was a tree lying perfectly horizontal across the road. As I got closer, I saw that there was a pickup truck parked in front of it with the driver's side door opened and its hazard lights on. Immediately, something didn't feel right. 

I slowed down, feeling dread pool in my chest. But why? Trees fall on the road like this all the time. I'm sure the driver just got out to try to push it. I was just being paranoid. Yet, I couldn't help thinking that the position of the tree was too perfect. As if it had been placed there.  

Feeling increasingly anxious, I started to back up to turn around, resolving to find another way home. That's when my headlights illuminated a figure. It was a huge, bearded man waving at me with one hand, his other gripping his neck tightly, his fingers and face covered in red. In the moment, it didnt register to my brain that he was bleeding. His eyes were wide and he was breathing quickly, his mouth opening and closing as if he was trying to speak. He stumbled and slammed a blood-soaked hand on the hood of my PT Cruiser hard enough to make it shake. 

I think I screamed, but I'm not sure. Without thinking, I started to scramble for my phone. 911. I had to call 911. In hindsight, I should've handled this better. I should've done more. I could've done literally anything besides sitting in my car like an idiot, fumbling for my phone. 

My whole body was shaking as I finally found it, but in my haste, my dumb ass dropped it. After I snatched it up from the floor, I glanced back at the man only to discover that I was alone. 

I made another stupid decision: I got out of the car. 

I ran out to the front and whirled around, looking for him. One long, red handprint was smeared along the hood, curving off to the right as if he'd been dragged away. But wouldn't I have heard it? How could I not have heard him being dragged? He was right there! 

Was that a voice? 

There it was again, followed by the sound of something falling. I hesitated, not knowing if I should run fast and far or see if I could find the bearded guy. He was hurt. If I left him, what would happen? 

While a voice screamed in the back of my head that this was a terrible idea, I went towards the sounds, guided by my phone's flashlight. This was the right thing. This was scary, but this was the right thing... wasn't it? 

If it was me bleeding to death in the woods, I'd want someone to find me. 

It took a lot of effort to keep my breathing even as I pressed through the underbrush. That effort quickly went to waste when my phone's light illuminated two glowing eyes in front of me. 

I jumped back, thinking at first that I'd run into some sort of nocturnal animal, until the 'animal' raised a hand to shield its eyes from the light. 

It took a second for my brain to register that it was the IT guy at work and he was crouched over the bearded man, whose head was attached to his neck by only a few threads of muscle, like a PEZ dispenser.  

I turned and ran for my life, barely feeling the branches hitting me in the shoulders and face. I tripped over something, probably a stick, and by some miracle still managed to keep going. 

The PT Cruiser was up ahead, the door still open. I dove in and didn't even wait until I'd closed the door to peel off, tires screeching as the old car tried to keep up with my frantic movements. I checked in the rear view mirror in time to see the IT guy walking out to the road to watch me drive off. His eyes reflected my taillights like two tiny mirrors until I got down the road. 

Once I made it back home, I barricaded the door and have been peeking through the blinds obsessively. I don't think he followed me, heck, i dont even know if he actually saw me; I think I may have blinded him with the light. Yet, I still don't feel safe. 

I told 911 about the bearded guy's truck left abandoned in front of a fallen tree, but for whatever reason, the idea of telling them about the IT guy filled me with so much alarm that I wanted to vomit. It was an odd feeling, like somehow he'd know if I'd tell them, and it wouldn't end well for me. I'm hoping that just telling them about the truck would help them find the bearded guy... if there was anything left to find, by the time they got there. That conjured up the memory of the bearded man's head and I had to run unto the restroom to throw up what little I'd eaten today.  

So... I'm really not looking forward to going to work  [tomorrow](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/StlFs7w7bg). If anyone has any thoughts on how to handle this, I'd love to hear them because my brain just keeps cycling back to panic.
