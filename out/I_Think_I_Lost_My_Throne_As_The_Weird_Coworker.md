Let me start off by saying that I've somehow managed to live 28 years without being able to hold a successful conversation. You'd think I'd have caught on by now, but nope, I still sound like an alien talking to a human being for the first time. 

To give you an example, a girl from another department was waiting to use our ancient copy machine that only works when it wants to. I'm not going to give her name or where we work because I'm terrified of this getting back to me. Just know that it's pharmaceuticals. I work the night shift in the lab as a research technician, which means that my lackluster social skills are normally not an issue. Thankfully, cell cultures don't give a hoot if you say something weird. 

But anyways, the copier was doing that wonderful thing where it pretends that it doesn't have paper (it does), and the girl made a comment about how it needs replaced. 

I shrugged and said, "Or maybe that tiny man that lives inside it just wants a pay raise."

Judging by the look she gave me, that is apparently not something a normal person would say. 

Is it any wonder why people don't speak to me at work unless they have to?

As you can imagine, I'm kind of a loner. I am not much better at forging relationships outside of work and I have no idea who my birth parents are. To put it simply, I've come to the harrowing realization that I'm someone no one would miss if I disappeared. 

I would be lying if I said that wasn't my primary motivation for risking my life to post this. I don't have anyone in real life to go to for help. I'm completely alone in this world. 

The incident that led to me getting to this point centers around the new IT guy. I met him when I had to return to the accursed copier. It was all taken apart, as if he were performing surgery on the thing. Unsuccessful surgery, at that. 

I tried to say something normal: "I know that the copy machine sucks, but violence isn't the answer."

It must've worked, because he chuckled. When he turned to face me I saw that he was wearing sunglasses. That should've been my first clue that something was "off" about him, but one thing you need to understand is that the lab has what I like to call "morgue lighting:" they're the kind of lights that instantly trigger headaches in people unlucky enough to have sensory issues. I, myself, had to get a blue light filter on my glasses just to keep from getting daily migraines at this place. Sure, wearing sunglasses inside is kind of extreme, but maybe he was even more photosensitive than I am.

He joked that the copier's funeral would be on Wednesday. He then informed me that it would be a few hours, saying something about a processor going bad. I resolved to try again later and went back to work. All in all, our first interaction was fairly normal, and I silently applauded myself for getting what I would consider a Good Grade in Conversation.

The second time I saw the IT guy, it was in the break room a few nights later. The break room was completely empty while I was getting my first meal of the day... at midnight. Being on nights has made a mess of both my sleep schedule and appetite. 

I jumped out of my skin when I heard someone say, "Dinner of champions, I see."

The IT guy was leaning against the counter, drinking from a thermos, eyes still covered by sunglasses. When did he get there? How did I not hear the door open? Maybe I was so sleep deprived that I simply didn't notice that he was there.  

I said something stupid about being a health nut first and a human second as I burnt my tongue on my Cup O' Noodles. He raised his thermos and informed me that coffee was his dinner. It was uncomfortably silent for a moment. I twirled my noodles, chest tight with awkwardness until I finally thought of something to say, "So, uh, is the copier alive?" 

IT guy sipped at his thermos again before replying that it belonged in a dumpster. I responded that I lived in a dumpster and could hook him up, then immediately regretted it. He smiled and made an equally cringey joke about living in the walls, which made the knot in my chest lessen a bit. 

It was oddly comforting to talk to someone as socially inept as I am. We continued to make awkward conversation about equally unimportant topics and for the first time in a while, I didn't feel like a complete loner. 

I even let myself be na√Øve enough to think that maybe I could actually make a friend, for once. 

So for a while, that's how it went: we'd make small talk in the break room or whenever we ran into each other. Besides the sunglasses and the way he seemed to just appear out of nowhere sometimes, he seemed like a nice enough guy with an odd sense of humor. 


Where things took a turn was yesterday. I get off of work at 3 am and the way to my house is full of back roads. It's not unusual for me to see my headlights catching the reflection of eyes in the darkness on the side of the road. Just deer, raccoons, and coyotes. Welcome to the Midwest. 

Where things get weird is that there was a tree lying perfectly horizontal across the road. A car parked in front of it with the driver's side door opened and its hazard lights on. Immediately, something didn't feel right. 

I slowed down, feeling dread pool in my chest. But why? Trees fall on the road like this all the time. I'm sure the driver just got out to try to push it. I was just being paranoid. Yet, I couldn't help thinking that the position of the tree was too perfect. As if it had been placed there.  

Feeling increasingly anxious, I started to back up to turn around, resolving to find another way home. I didn't want to stay there a moment longer. That's when my headlights illuminated a figure. It was a huge, bearded man waving at me with one hand, his other gripping his neck tightly, his fingers and face covered in red. In the moment, it didnt register to my brain that he was bleeding. His eyes were wide and he was breathing quickly, his mouth opening and closing as if he was trying to speak. 

I think I screamed, but I'm not sure. Without thinking, I started to scramble for my phone. 911. I had to call 911. In hindsight, I should've handled this better. I should've done more. I don't know necessarily what actions I could have taken, but it should have been anything besides sitting in my car like an idiot, fumbling for my phone. 

My whole body was shaking as I finally found it, but in my haste, my dumb ass dropped it. After I snatched it up from the floor, I glanced back at the man only to discover that I was alone. 

I made another stupid decision: I got out of the car.

Or, rather, I started to get out, but then I heard a shriek, followed by a horrible ripping sound, then silence. My heartbeat hammering in my ears, I sat back down and stepped on the gas before I even fully had the door closed. Embarrassingly enough, I was also panting like a nervous dog, looking around for whatever made that sound as I sped off. 

In the corner of my eye, I thought I saw something, but I kept driving, my knuckles white on the steering wheel. I just had to get out of here, then once I was safe I could call 911. That's what I told myself, anyway. It's better than admitting that I was too terrified to be anything even remotely close to rational. 

Once I turned onto another back road, I saw someone walking along the tree line. It took a second for my panicked brain to register that it was the guy from work. It probably also didn't help that up until that point, I'd never seen him without his sunglasses on. His face was bloodied, his hand reaching out towards me as if pleading for help. 

His eyes reflected my headlights back to me. 

I didn't slow down. He watched me pass him by, his eyes shining even in my rear view mirrors. 


Once I made it back home, I barricaded the door and have been peeking through the blinds obsessively, terrified I'm going to see him standing outside. I told 911 about the car being left, but for whatever reason, the idea of telling them about the IT guy filled me with so much alarm that I wanted to vomit. It was an odd feeling, like somehow he'd know if I'd tell them and it wouldnt end well for me. I figure that tipping them off about the car would be enough. They'd be able to identify the driver from that. At least, that's what I'm telling myself. 

So... I'm really not looking forward to going to work tomorrow.
