I flailed, kicking and swinging as I fell, devoured by the gullet of the tree. I smashed through vines, branches. My body spun and cracked, bones on roots, muscles pulling and skin bruising, until finally I crashed into a pile of bones, rolling onto the dirt with a painful groan. 



A voice echoed from the darkness above, bright and cheerful. The boy. 



‘Don’t worry,’ he called down to me. ‘The bones ain’t human. Just squirrels and such. Stuff the Groundskeeper used to hunt.’



Groundskeeper?



I heard what sounded like the girl scolding the boy beneath her breath. Then she called down. 



‘Look out—I’m coming next.’



The girl leaped, landing with much more grace than I. The pile of bones barely shifted as she rolled off of them, and the same happened when the boy dropped down. It was if the children weighed nothing at all. 



‘Did you say these woods had a groundskeeper?’ I asked as they got to their feet. 



‘Used to,’ said the boy, dusting off his shorts, though they didn’t appear to have any marks. ‘He’s gone now. His head got all addled and—’



‘He died,’ the girl said quickly. ‘The Brittle Man got him, just like he’ll get us if we don’t kill that monster first.’



She marched forward, uninterested in further the discussion. The boy and I followed. The passage was tight, with gnarled roots hanging like nooses. It seemed that we were underground, that we’d somehow fallen into a network beneath the Crooked Wood. 

  
  


‘This was one of the groundskeeper’s tunnels,’ the boy told me in a hushed, mischievous voice. ‘Used to use em’ to get around the garden, back before his brain became stew.’



I blinked. ‘Did you just call this place a Garden?’



His eyes went wide, darting to the girl who was far enough ahead she hadn’t heard. He shook his head. ‘What? No. It’s a forest. The Crooked Wood.’



‘But you called it a Garden just now.’



He folded his arms. ‘Nope. Maybe your brain’s turned into stew, too.’



Before I could press him on it, the girl’s voice rang out ahead of us. ‘We made it. Pick up the pace, you two.’



I lifted my hand, shielding my eyes against a pale light. It was the mouth of the tunnel. The girl’s silhouette stood out in the center of it, her foot tapping with impatience and worry. 



‘My God,’ I breathed, coming up beside her. ‘What is this place?’



‘The Jagged Maze,’ she whispered, gazing across a labyrinth of twisted undergrowth. ‘Once, this place was my favorite place in the entire world. Now, it’s nothing but brambles and thorns.’



The boy shrugged. ‘Whatever. It’s still the fastest route to the lighthouse.’



I turned to him. ‘We’re in the middle of a forest. There isn’t an ocean for miles. What good is a lighthouse?’



‘Ask the Brittle Man,’ said the girl darkly. ‘It’s how he finds his victims, or at least, that’s our best theory. We think he uses the flame to fight wandering children, to track them as they run so he could add their skin to his coat.’



‘It’s where he hides his heart,’ added the boy, dropping down and beginning to crawl into the Jagged Maze. ‘So that’s where we’re going. To find that monster’s heart, and rip it apart.’



I swallowed, a cold chill creeping up my spine. 



‘Come on,’ said the girl. ‘The Brittle Man will catch up soon.’



So I followed them into that mess of thorns. It was tight enough that I couldn’t even crawl, I had to slither after them on my belly, like a snake beneath a barbed-wire sky. 

Thorns nicked my cheeks. My arms. They traced bloody lines across every inch of my exposed skin, but I forced myself forward. To finally defeat my demon. To finally get revenge for what the Brittle Man did to Charlie. 



Yet the further we went, the more unwell I felt. 



It was my my thoughts. They were beginning to race, churning inside of my skull like ant-infested honey. Memories knocked at the doors of my mind. The old kind. The haunted kind. 



I remembered him—The Brittle Man. 



I remembered the day we wandered into this Crooked Wood, and the Stranger who had tried to warn us away. To save us from the grim fate that lurked beyond these trees.



How long ago was it? 



It’s so hard to say. It felt like decades, but it just as easily could have been weeks, or even centuries. Time felt funny in the Crooked Wood. I think maybe it always did, even back then; when Charlie and I first walked beneath those autumn leaves. 



All I can say for certain is our nightmare didn’t begin with the Brittle Man. It began with him. 



The Stranger. 

  
  
  
  


Charlie and I found him at the edge of the wood, that liminal space where the forest we knew became the forest we dreaded. He wore a suit. It was white and tattered at the cuffs, and his tophat sunk low enough that it covered his eyes. Though he stood in the glare of the setting sun, he cast no shadow. 



‘Hello,’ Charlie said as we approached. 



But the Stranger did not answer. How could he? His mouth was full of thorns, coiled like razors spilling from his lips. In retrospect, he was a terrifying figure. Impossible and grotesque. But at the time, we felt nothing but ease in his presence. 



Charlie and I settled onto the grass before him. We sat there and watched him work. He cradled a sketchpad in his arm, slashing a stick of charcoal across it with all the violence of a sword. It was hypnotic. By the time he had finished, the sun had shrunk and the moon hung lonely in the sky, drowning beneath an ocean of clouds. 



He turned his pad toward us then. Showed us an explosion of charcoal, a jagged cacophony of lines that bled toward the edge of the paper, that made my eyes burn and my pulse race. It looked like evil, only worse. It looked like nothing. Like the absence of all things, a portrait of emptiness. 



The Stranger never said so, but somehow Charlie both knew what that thing was. It was as if his sketch had burrowed into our minds, had shown us revelations that neither sight nor words could put across. It was a monster, that much we knew. A force more terrible than any that had ever been, and it lived in this wood. 



It was called the Beast. 



The Stranger’s portrait told us many things about it. It told us that he’d chained it here, deep in the trees, locked it away so that it may never escape because if it ever did, then all the brightness that ever was would dim and die, and so too would all life, until the universe shrank to nothing within its own shadow. 



It terrified Charlie. I remember his voice breaking, soiled with grief as he demanded to know what we might do to help stop this Beast. 



And I remember the awful truth the Stranger told him. 



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



‘Do you see it?’ 



I blinked, shaken from my reverie. The boy crouched in front of me, his hand parting the roof of the thicket to reveal a haunting horizon. ‘It’s amazing, isn’t it?’ he breathed. ‘Even after everything, there’s still magic here. Pretty sweet.’



A lump formed in my throat. 



The forest ahead looked surreal, like paintings from a mad artist’s unhinged gallery. They resembled skyscrapers. Towering, and needle-thin. Their tips carved the clouds that wove between them, causing them to distort in white swirls, like foaming rapids. 



‘This doesn’t look like the Crooked Wood,’ I choked out, my voice caught somewhere between awe and horror. 



The girl nodded, her expression detached and severe. ‘No, it doesn’t. But make no mistake, we haven’t left. It’s still the same nightmare, only we’re closer to the source now. See that?’



I followed her pointing finger, gazing through the walls of trees toward a blue light that did not seem to glow. It sat atop a tower. 

‘That’s the lighthouse,’ she told me. ‘It’s the source of all this corruption, the rot that’s infecting everything else. Like the boy said, that’s where the Brittle Man keeps his heart. Once we destroy it, we can finally put an end to this horror story, and free all the souls he’s chained to the land.’



I turned to her, expression pale with dread. ‘Are you saying that the children the Brittle Man kills… They don’t pass on? Their souls are still imprisoned in the Crooked Wood?’



‘That’s right,’ sang the boy, giving me a feather-light punch on the arm. ‘All of em. Every last one of the sorry suckers. Even that kid you knew. What was his name again?’



‘Charlie,’ I whispered. 



‘Right. Him too.’



My jaw tensed, teeth gnashing with barely contained fury. The Brittle Man. That sonnuvabitch. It wasn’t enough for him to just slaughter children. He had to make their souls suffer too.



‘It’s how he stays alive,’ the girl said solemnly, as though reading my rage. ‘The Brittle Man has no soul to call his own, so he consumes the children’s’ to keep him satiated, to keep him whole.’



The boy whistled. ‘It’s no wonder I’ve been feeling so weak.’



I narrowed my eyes, a thread of suspicion tugging at my mind. ‘Why would that make you weak? You’re not hanging off a tree. He doesn’t have your soul.’



His carefree demeanor cracked, and he gave a nervous chuckle. 



‘He was talking about our friends,’ offered the girl, paying him a look I couldn’t read. ‘It’s exhausting emotionally knowing that our classmates are hanging from trees, caught in a nightmare they can’t escape.’



‘Right,’ I muttered. ‘But I don’t that’s what he was—’



A crunch of branches stole my attention. My voice shriveled up, in my throat. I turned, looked back across that endless expanse of thorns.



‘You heard that too, huh?’ said the boy. 



‘It’s him,’ whispered the girl. ‘He’s caught our scent. He must know where we’re going.’



And there, perhaps a mile away near the edge of that Jagged Maze came a rustle of bramble, a guttural snort. Twigs cracked. Fingernails clacked. Its every creaking movement was growing faster and faster. 

  
  


‘Christ,’ I gasped, watching the maze part like the Red Sea. ‘How big is he?’



The girl gripped my arm, her eyes wide with panic.  ‘You don’t want to know.’



But my eyes were locked on the monster. My ears rang with the click-clack symphony of that creature barreling through the undergrowth, heaving with hungry desperation. 



‘Don’t look at it,’ said the boy, yanking on my arm. ‘Just run, man. Trust me. You look back, and we’re all dead.’



I nodded, absently, digging deep to find my lost courage. 



Then I ran. 



Just as he’d said, I kept my eyes ahead. Maybe that’s why I finally saw it—those markings circling the boy’s throat. They looked almost like a necklace, only they were too uneven, too tight against his skin, almost like they were part of him. 



Stitches. 



‘What happened to your neck?’ I asked, my gut telling me something was amiss. ‘It’s all stitched up. Why?’



The boy reached a hand round, covering up the marks, his cheeks burning red. 



‘It’s a long story,’ he sputtered, tripping over his words. ‘Had a car accident when I was little. That’s all. It knocked off my head, or just about.’ He gave another nervous laugh, practically his calling card. ‘They had to stitch it back on. My whole head. Can you believe it?’



No, I couldn’t.



Apparently, nor could the girl. She shot him a scathing glance over her shoulder. ‘Really? That’s the story you’re going with?’



That’s when I stopped running, the whole scenario feeling rotten bottom to top. The children were hiding something from. I’d felt it before when they’d skirted around talk of the Groundskeeper, and I felt it now in a way I could no longer ignore. 



‘Enough,’ I snapped. ‘What aren’t you telling me?’

  
  


The kids exchanged a look, the kind I’d seen before in my own son—back before I lost him. It was guilt. It was written in their downturned expressions, the way their feet shifted and their eyes darted. They’d been caught in a lie. One they could no longer fool me into believing. 



My thoughts spun. I’d heard of monsters using victims as bait. Is that what this was?



Were these children victims, or was the Brittle Man using them to lure me toward its lair? Was it hoping to finally catch the child that escaped him all those years ago, to finally add my own face to its coat of flesh?



Yes, that would certainly explain a lot. Like how the kids just happened to cross paths with me at the edge of the wood, offering to guide me toward a creature cloaked in myth and nightmares. It would explain how they knew the forest so well, why they wandered through the surreal landscape like it were familiar, like it were home. 



The children were his thralls. Pawns of the Brittle Man. 



‘You’re part of this,’ I spat, jabbing a finger at them. ‘Both of you. That’s why you didn’t want me to shoot him earlier. You’re some kind of followers of his, aren’t you?’



The girl slapped her forehead. ‘See what you’ve done?’ she hissed at the boy. ‘All you had to do was stop embellishing and—’



‘Lay off,’ the boy said. ‘Just tell him the truth, would you? He won’t freak out. No way. Even if he does, we’ve got bigger problems.’



I nodded fiercely. ‘Oh yes, the truth would be great. Feel free to share some of that, it’d make a wonderful change of pace.’



Behind us, the bramble snapped and broke within the Jagged Maze. The Brittle Man was still coming. 



‘We haven’t got time,’ said the girl. 



‘Make time.’



She shot me a glare like a bullet. Then sighed. She reached back and parted the hair from her shoulders, then lifted her jaw to reveal the same ring of stitches around her neck. ‘We’ve all got them,’ she explained. ‘Mementos from when the Brittle Man carved off our heads.’



My heart skipped a beat. ‘From when he…’



‘Carved off our heads,’ said the boy, wrenching back on his ballcap so that his head came off his neck, revealing a grotesque stirfry of tendons and torn flesh. He dropped it back down. ‘Why do you think we both want that Brittle asshole dead so badly? It’s payback. For what he did to us.’



I felt the color drain from my face. 



‘You both—’



‘Dead,’ finished the girl, voice terse. ‘Just like every other kid hanging in the Crooked Wood. It’s like we said, the Brittle Man doesn’t settle for taking lives. He takes souls.’



Jesus. I thought I had it bad losing Charlie, then losing my son, but these kids… They were ghosts, spirits lashed to an unending nightmare, with nothing but their hanging corpses and executioner to keep them company. 



‘I’m sorry,’ I stammered. ‘I didn’t realize.’



‘We don’t need your apology,’ the girl said, grabbing my arm and yanking. ‘We need your help. Now hurry up and move. That little interrogation might’ve just cost us everything.’



I didn’t think, just ran. 



The Brittle Man was behind us, I could hear him, but strangely his movements had begun to slow. It was as if he were taking his time, choosing his moment. Was he waiting until we were closer to the lighthouse? Was he saving himself the trouble of carting our corpses there himself?



‘We thought you’d freak out if you knew we were ghosts,’ the boy said, running at my side. ‘Would’ve told you sooner. I wanted to. She made me promise to keep quiet, though.’



Ghosts.



They were ghosts. 



‘How long have you been dead?’ I choked out. 



He screwed up his face in thought, and it occurred to me that even though we were both sprinting, the boy showed no sign of exhaustion. ‘Few years?’ he said. ‘Not sure, honestly. Time is funny here. Real talk? It sorta reminds me of purgatory, y’know. Like a world between worlds where souls get trapped.’

  


A shudder rippled through me. My fingers traced my own throat, half-expecting to feel the imprint of stitches on my skin, half-expecting to realize that I was no different than the children were—just another spirit masquerading as a living, breathing human, when the boy laughed.



‘Relax, man. You’re not dead. The only ghosts haunting the Crooked Wood are the ghosts of children.’



‘Exactly,’ called the girl from up ahead. ‘And that means you can do what we can’t.’



‘And what’s that?’



‘You can stop him. You can kill the Brittle Man and free all the souls he’s caged in this awful place. Your friend included.’



My stomach twisted. 



It was one thing to kill the Brittle Man, to make him hurt for the pain he’d caused me, but to save somebody… let alone a forest full of dead children? It felt impossible. Gigantic. I’d never saved a single person in my entire life. 



Not Charlie.



Not my son.



Hell, I’d even watched my own wife waste away, her body crumbling to nothing while I drank myself unconscious pretending the real world didn’t exist. In the end, I wasn’t even with her when she died. I was passed out on the floor of my workshop, rolling around in empty beer cans. 



‘You’ll help us, won’t you?’ the girl asked. ‘Put an end to all of this? For good?’



‘I’ll try.’ My eyes crinkled with shame, but it was the best I could offer her. 



Anything more would’ve felt like a lie. 



We kept on, rushing through the trees while the specter of the Brittle Man followed behind. Unseen. Unheard. A predator stalking its prey. Before long the pencil trees thinned out, giving way to an expanse of midnight sky, and a vast valley that plummeted toward the earth.



And there, hanging above it all was the moon.



Full. Bright. 



It looked like a spherical mountain, near enough that the tips of the trees cracked against its cratered surface. A scar split it down the middle, spilling a deluge of red into the valley below. 



‘The moon’s bleeding,’ I mumbled, as if somebody ought to know. 



‘Has been for years,’ said the girl. ‘Ever since the Brittle Man finished with the sun.’



A crow cried somewhere ahead, beckoning us deeper into the wood. We followed a spiraling path, one that wound the length of the valley, with walls of those colossal trees swaying at our sides. 



‘Is this even earth?’ I asked, my voice haunted.



The boy laughed. ‘What do you think?’



‘The Crooked Wood exists outside the earth,’ said the girl, always the more serious of the two. ‘It exists outside of time. That’s why you don’t find it. It finds you.’



Her words stirred a memory within me. 



I’d remembered bolting home, frantic and shaking, crying out for my mother. The wood took Charlie, I told them. A monster did. It murdered my best friend and there was nothing I could do. 



They followed me back to the wood—that little copse of trees that sat at the edge of our farm. We searched with me all evening, calling Charlie’s name. Before long, his mother joined. Then the sheriff. But it was all pointless because I could already tell these weren’t the same trees that had eaten my friend. 



This was just the wood. There was nothing crooked about it. 



‘They sent me to prison,’ I said, grief welling up inside of me. ‘It’s hard to remember details but… I remember they locked me up. Wouldn’t let me leave until I was a man. For twenty years. Maybe thirty. They all said I’d killed him—my own brother.’



‘Brother?’ said the boy. 



I shook my head violently. ‘No. Sorry. I meant Charlie—it’s just he was like a brother to me. The sheriff said I hid the evidence, that I was trying to pass the murder off on some boogeyman when the real monster was me.’



Tears stung my eyes, and I quickly wiped my sleeve across my face. ‘My whole family thought I was a murderer. That I’d killed my best friend.’



The girl was silent. So was the boy. They kept running, their faces unreadable beneath the dark of the twisting canopy, but I got the sense that they felt I was guilty too, that maybe they even knew I was but couldn’t bring themselves to admit it. 

‘There was man,’ I blurted out, half to fill the silence, and half to distract from the guilt in my gut.  ‘Charlie and I met him at the edge of the wood, that place where the forest becomes bent and wrong. We called him the Stranger.’



‘That so?’ said the girl. 



‘Yes. He drew us a picture—of a…a… Beast. He said he’d chained within this wood himself.’



‘Must’ve been talking about the Brittle Man,’ said the girl. ‘That’s the only Beast I’ve ever seen.’



The boy nodded hurriedly. ‘Oh yeah. Must’ve been.’



I frowned, feeling that same implacable sense of suspicion. The children had described the Brittle Man to me when we first met, hours ago at the border of the wood. They’d spoken of an abomination, a monster that crawled instead of walked, that wore faces like a coat, but the thing the Stranger had shown Charlie and I all those years ago…



I don’t think it matched the description. 



Biting down on my lip, I sifted through my memories, desperately searching for the thread that might lead me back to that night. I’d seen him, the Brittle Man. I’d seen him steal Charlie away into the trees, I know I had, so then why couldn’t I recall what he looked like?



There—



An image swam to the surface of my mind, rippling like a reflection in a storm. A memory. I saw the Stranger then, that man in the tophat who cast no shadow, whose mouth was full of thorns and ivy. I saw Charlie asking what he could do to help stop the Beast, and I saw the Stranger pull him aside, showing Charlie a sketch I wasn’t permitted to see. 



Afterward, I’d asked Charlie what the Stranger showed him, but he refused to say. 



‘It’s a secret,’ was all he said. ‘But you know what isn’t? Me. The fact that I’m going to save the world.’



I rolled my eyes at him, in the way boys do when we tease one another. I told him before he saved the world, he might start by finding us a way out of these trees because I was almost certain we were lost. 



And that was the first time I heard him. 



His fingernails, click-clacking along the skin of the trees. His breathing, shallow and laboured like a dying animal. Before I could ask Charlie if he heard it too, his eyes had already found the same thing mine had: a decrepit shadow, colossal and strange, creeping along the branches high above, its bones creaking with every swing of its scarecrow limbs. 



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



‘There it is!’ exclaimed the boy. His fist pumped at the sky. ‘We actually made it!’



The girl scoffed. ‘Of course we did. You think I’d have let us die back there?’



I jogged to a stop, keeling over with my hands on my knees, panting with exhaustion. I didn’t know how long we’d been running for. Might’ve been minutes. Might’ve been days. What I did know was that we’d found ourselves in a clearing surrounding by steepening trees, and there in the center was an anomaly that stole the breath from my lungs. 



A lighthouse. 



It rose up and up, a shambling tower of rotting wood. It was a travesty of planks criss-crossed atop each other, hammered in with crooked, rusted nails. It looked like it’d been assembled by a child, or a madman. Certainly nobody who’d ever held a hammer. And yet this swaying monstrosity reached dozens, even hundreds, of feet into the sky. 



And there at its apex was that ghostly flame I’d seen before. Winter blue. A light without a glow.



‘Crap,’ said the boy, emerging from behind the lighthouse. ‘It isn’t here.’



The girl bit down on her lip, worried. 



‘Wait,’ I said, stumbling forward. ‘What isn’t here?’



‘The door, man. We’ve got no way inside.’



 ‘It’s fine,’ said the girl, shuttering her eyes as though thinking of their next move. ‘We knew this might happen. He isn’t like he was the last time he was here. That means we’ll have to break in. The wards. They’re out back, down by the river. Break them and the door should appear.’



The boy cocked an eyebrow at her. ‘What about you?’



‘I’ll keep a lookout. If I spot the Brittle Man, I’ll—I don’t know, scream or something. Just go. I can already smell his putrid coat on the wind.’



I looked between the two of them, utterly lost as to what either was talking about. The boy waved me forward. ‘C’mon. I’ll fill you in on the way.’



He led me past the lighthouse, down a sloping field of yellowed grass that crinkled with our every step. Then we came upon a trail lined with dimming lanterns. Inside were bottled fireflies, though most looked to be dead, just like the Groundskeeper that once replaced them. 



We slipped past a jutting copse of trees. Through a cave that wept. Then found ourselves upon the bank of  a river, only the water didn’t look the shade it should have. It was red, not blue. It chugged, slow and viscous, like blood clotting in an artery. 



And there, in the distance was a waterfall greater than any on earth. It poured from the clouds themselves. Or so it seemed until those pale clouds shifted, and I saw the river pouring from the gaping wound of that fractured moon.



‘Jesus Christ,’ I whispered. 



‘Already tried that,’ said the boy, grunting behind me. ‘He won’t pick up. Pretty sure it’s just us down here. Wanna give me a hand with this?’



I turned to find him pushing against a slab of concrete sunk into the shore. It rested atop a great stone cylinder, ornate in a way the shambling lighthouse couldn’t compare to. Images had been chiseled into its surface. Creatures with wings like doves, wielding swords with six blades. 



‘They’re in here,’ the boy said as I pushed against the lid. ‘The wards, I mean. The Brittle Man hides em here to uh—look, it doesn’t matter. What’s important is we have to bust em apart.’



The lid fell to the stones with a deafening slam, cracking in two. I looked inside to find a collection of velvet bags, paler than the moon. They were all tied shut by cords that looked to be human hair. 



My stomach knotted. 



‘Bust em apart?’ I asked.



‘Yeah. Like, stomp on em. Shoot em. Whatever works.’



I reached down, plucking them out one by one. ‘What’s inside of them?’ I asked, a familiar sensation of unease crawling across my skin. ‘Anything I should know about?’



The boy opened his mouth to answer, but before he could get off a word a scream tore through the air. 



The girl.



She was raising the alarm. 



‘He’s here!’ she shrieked in the distance. ‘He’s coming for you!’



And I heard it then, too, even from all the way down by the river. That click-clack of yellowed fingernails, that graveyard wheeze. It was coming from above—up there, in that shifting abyss of leaves the moonlight couldn’t pierce. 



The Brittle Man. He’d found us. 



The boy, usually carefree to a fault, froze up with dread. His voice became a stammering mess. He shouted a slurry of directions, none of it making much sense, but I heard enough in that mash of words to understand his wish.



Stomp on the wards. Break them as fast as I can. 



If I didn’t, we would all die. 



He stood over one, his foot slamming down on it over and over, but as a spirit it seemed he couldn’t exert much force in the material realm. His shoes slid off the fabric as if it were woven titanium. 



My turn. 



I lifted my boot, then brought it down. It crashed through the velvet bag with a crunch that turned my stomach, and whatever I’d broken turned the bag a dark crimson. All the while, the boy cried out. The girl screamed. The Brittle Man’s fingernails click-clacked closer and closer, his putrid coat making my nostrils curl in disgust. 



I didn’t know what was inside the bags. 



There wasn’t time to check. 



It was life or death, and so I kept stomping, over and over. It was all I could do to protect the children, to save their souls from the mutilation that the Brittle Man would no doubt deliver upon them should we fail. I’d already let down everybody in my life. My wife. My son. 



Charlie.



I couldn’t let the boy down too. Or the girl. Not when we were so close to ending this nightmare for good. So I stomped and I stomped until the stones ran red and my chest burned with exhaustion, until the last bag of pale velvet lay before me.



And then I stomped again. 



This time as my heel cleaved through the sack, that knot of hair tying it tight came undone. The contents spilled out onto the riverbank, staring up at me with eyes I recognized. An entire face—or what remained of it. 



‘Charlie…’



The word fell from my lips as I fell to my knees. 



‘Charlie, what are doing here?’



I tried to scoop him up then, the head of my childhood friend, the bloody mulch that he’d become. That I’d made him into. I looked around at the other bags, each of them bleeding upon the shore. 



Heads.



All of them were heads. That’s what the Brittle Man used for his wards—the decapitated remains of the children he slaughtered. 



‘Oh god,’ I choked out, a sob breaking my voice. ‘Charlie. I’m so sorry.’



But the boy wrenched on my arm, desperate and stern. ‘Yeah, it’s real tragic. Believe me, I get it probably better than anyone, but now ain’t the time, dude. We gotta move.’



I looked down at the demolished face of my best friend, now little more then crimson mash dripping from my boot. Horror. Disgust. Shame. All of it cut through me like a butcher’s knife, and I collapsed onto my hands, hurling onto the stones. 



But the boy kept pleading.



The damn kid didn’t seem to get it. I’d failed everybody in my life—every last person that put their trust in me ended up dead, and these kids would be no different. Only for them, it’d be a fate beyond death. 



‘Oh, crap, crap, crap…’



The boy stumbled backwards, falling over onto the stones. His eyes were fixed on the swaying trees high above, voice caught in an revolving loop of terror. 



‘He’s here,’ he sputtered. ‘He’s here. He’s here. He’s here.’



And I heard it then, clear as the ache in my heart. The machine-gun rattle of fingernails rioting through the trees, the hee-haw breathing of a monster closing in, its every movement a rattle of bones and—



The riverbank exploded.



I lifted my arm on instinct, fast enough to feel what might have been a stone, or maybe a piece of some child’s shattered skull, cut across my palm. The whole shore rained pebbles and blood. The force of the impact threw me backward, slamming me against the concrete tomb. 



My ears rang. 



My world span. 



A grotesque, black shape materialized in the settling debris. A colossal shadow twice the size of a rhinoceros and narrower than a scarecrow. Its limps were like branches. Long. Crooked. And there, on the tips of those rake-like fingers, were a curled silhouette of fingernails I knew would be yellow and sharp.



The Brittle Man was here.
