This year, I hiked the Great Glen Way in Scotland. It was early September, so it was already pretty cold—the kind of cold where your tent has frost on it in the morning.

I started on the west side, in Fort William, with the goal of reaching Inverness. It’s roughly a 120-kilometer hike, so I planned to complete it in about five to six days. On the first day, everything went smoothly. I got off the train, stopped by a supermarket for food and toilet paper, and set off.

It was already fairly late, around 5 or 6 in the evening if I remember right, so my only goal was to find a suitable camping spot and get to bed. I found a quiet little grass paddock, set up my tent, and went to sleep around 9 p.m.

The next day was mostly spent following the canal until I reached Loch Lochy. From there, the trail veers away from the canal and heads up into the hills. That’s when I first heard the whistling—you know, like the sound wind makes during a storm when you’re safe indoors. But the weather was fine; just a bit of rain, and hardly any wind. I figured it was just because I was in a valley and maybe the wind was howling up on the mountain peaks. So, I pressed on and didn’t think much more of it.

Later that day, while I was filling my water bottle, I came across another hiker. We had a quick chat, and I asked him how long he’d been out there. He said nearly two months. I asked if he had any tips since it was my first time in Scotland. He said, “Never stray too far off the track.” I laughed, still looking down at my water filter, but when I looked up, his expression had changed—he was staring at me with a serious, almost warning look.

We said our goodbyes and went our separate ways. I didn’t know what to make of it.

That night, I set up camp about 50 meters up a hill, as it was the only spot with decent ground for my tent. The night was dead silent—not a single bird or animal sound. I was exhausted, though, so I didn’t mind. When I woke up the next morning, there was a layer of frost on my tent, thicker than I’d expected for the temperature.

As I was packing up, I went out to pee and then started breaking down my tent. That’s when I noticed a spot with no frost at all: a pair of handprints, right where my head had been under the tent. I definitely hadn’t touched it there, and the shape was too flat to have come from the inside. I rationalized it, thinking maybe there was some oil residue from my hands from a previous trip, which kept the frost from forming.

The next two days went by without any major incidents. My first campsite by Loch Ness was in a forest. I love camping in forests because, at night, you usually hear all the wildlife doing its thing, and otherwise, it’s peaceful. But not this night. Again, there was complete silence—no rustling branches, no distant animal calls. Still, it was what it was.

The next morning, as I brushed my teeth, I heard the whistling again. This time, it was louder and sounded deeper—not the high-pitched tone I’d heard before. And it seemed to move. I felt a little unnerved, but I packed my tent anyway.

When I lifted the groundsheet to roll it up, I got a very, very bad feeling. I don’t know why—I’m not superstitious. But I could swear someone was watching me, and all the while, the whistling grew louder. I hurried to finish packing, and suddenly, the whistling stopped.

On my last day of the hike, I needed a quick break, so I set down my pack near a tree and went up the slope to pee. As soon as I couldn’t see my pack anymore, the whistling started again. This time, I was too weirded out to ignore it. I followed the sound, and as I got closer, the pitch first grew louder, then softened—but you know how you can tell someone’s talking just as clearly when they’re close by speaking quietly as when they’re shouting from far away? It was like that. I could tell I was getting closer.

Around a particularly big tree, the whistling suddenly stopped. But no one was there. I must have walked 30 or 40 meters up the hill by then and was confused. I looked down and saw what looked like human footprints in the wet leaves. And then I heard someone breathing—right next to my ear.

I ran down that mountain, grabbed my bag, and didn’t stop running. Needless to say, the pee break was over on the run.

Scotland is beautiful, but I’m never coming back.
