The barking pierced the night again, slightly closer than the night before. It began each night around 2 a.m., seemingly from a small pack of dogs, and with each passing night, it grew closer.

Struggling against the suffocating heaviness of sleep, I reluctantly slipped out of bed and moved to the window. Half expecting to see the eerie glow of eyes or menacing figures, I was instead met by the dark, impenetrable forest bordering our home. The trees, swayed by a gentle wind, cast ghost-like shadows in the moonlight. With a deep sigh, I closed the blinds, a shiver of unease crawling up my spine.

Jen, stirred by the disturbance, sat up, her face etched with worry in the dim light.

“The dogs again?” she asked, her voice heavy with sleep.

“Yep,” I replied, my annoyance tinged with an underlying dread.

We had lived on this secluded property for nearly twenty years. Although our nearest neighbor was about three miles away, the place had always been a quiet haven. After our son moved to the city, the nights had grown even quieter, interrupted only occasionally by the distant hoot of owls.

The barking had begun just a week ago. Initially so faint, I had to strain to hear them. But like clockwork, at 2 a.m., their barking would fill the night, only to cease abruptly an hour later.

One night, convinced the source was right outside, I armed myself with my shotgun and turned on the powerful spotlights around our house, illuminating the yard as if it were daylight. Yet, nothing appeared; the barking was unrelenting. Listening closely, I could make out distinct sounds: one bark tinged with cruel laughter, another a low mournful howl, and yet another resembling a whimper. As I concentrated, the underbrush near the forest’s edge began shaking violently. I fired a warning shot, and the noises hesitated before fading into the forest's depths.

After ensuring the barking had stopped, I turned off the lights and headed back inside. Jen, peering through the blinds, jumped when she saw me.

“Damn it, Jack, you scared me!” she exclaimed, her voice a mix of relief and lingering fear.

“Sorry, love,” I apologized, securing my shotgun and embracing her. “I should have given you a heads-up. I know those dogs have got you on edge.”

She leaned into me, her grip tight. “How could they not? Why do they start at the same time each night, and why are they getting closer? It’s really starting to freak me out.”

I shared her concerns but tried to keep calm. “How about I check it out at dawn? Maybe I can find something,” I suggested, hoping to ease her worry.

She was hesitant but agreed, somewhat reassured by my resolve.

The next morning, I took my shotgun and headed toward the area where we had last heard the barking. These woods, a place where my son and I had spent countless hours hunting and exploring, felt different now. The familiar paths, slowly being reclaimed by nature, still bore the imprints of our past adventures.

Lost momentarily in the beauty of the forest and memories of days gone by, I was jolted back to reality by a putrid smell of decaying flesh. Unable to locate the source, I continued deeper. Soon, I discovered clumps of dark black fur in the brush, young trees bent and broken, and numerous scratches on older trees. But it was the tracks that stopped me cold, they resembled those of a dog, yet were aligned too perfectly, too methodically, as if mocking the natural gait of an animal.

Feeling watched, I hurried back home. Jen was waiting on the porch, her face written with concern.

I relayed my findings, the unsettling tracks, the fur, the smell. It all seemed bizarre.

“We should call animal control, Jack. Honestly, we should’ve done it sooner,” Jen suggested.

I nodded, and we called them. They promised to send someone the next day. Relieved, we prepared for bed, but exhaustion from the day's events quickly pulled me into a deep sleep.

I was abruptly awoken by loud snarls, growls, and the deep barking of dogs, this time inside our house. Jen and I bolted upright. I grabbed my shotgun as the sounds of barking and whimpering echoed off the wooden floors. I quickly turned the bedroom door lock, securing it with a decisive click. But no sooner had the lock clicked into place than scratching erupted on the other side. The sounds were frenzied and desperate, accompanied by intermittent barking that now mixed with wet, heavy panting and what sounded disturbingly like mocking laughter. The chilling cacophony pressed against the thin barrier of the door, sending shivers down my spine and setting my every nerve on edge.

I hurried to the bedroom window, peeking out and checking if the coast was clear before grabbing my keys.

“We’ve got to get out through the trellis and make a run for the truck!” I yelled over the noise, trying to keep my voice steady.

Jen, clearly terrified, nodded and climbed down the trellis first. I followed closely behind her. Just as I reached the bottom, a loud snap echoed from above. My heart raced, and I looked up instinctively towards our bedroom window. A dog's head peered down at us, silhouetted against the pale moonlight. Though unseen, its eyes felt as if they were boring into mine.

We dashed to the truck, our feet pounding against the gravel. As we peeled away from the house, the sounds of barking faded.

We drove silently until we reached a lone gas station miles from our home. Catching our breath, the reality of our escape began to sink in. Jen looked at me, her face pale, eyes wide with lingering fear.

"What kind of dogs were those, Jack? How did they get into our house?" she asked, her voice trembling with the weight of unspoken horrors.

As the events replayed in my mind, the sinister tracks, the grotesque silhouette of the dog head, and the chilling sounds behind the bedroom door, I realized the gravity of what we had witnessed. “Do you… do you know of any dogs that walk on two legs?” I asked slowly, the horror of the realization echoing in the silence that followed.
