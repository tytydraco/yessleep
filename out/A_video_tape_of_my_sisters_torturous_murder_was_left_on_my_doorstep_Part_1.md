Almost a decade later an old school video tape found itself on my doorstep. I don't know who left it, I do not have any cameras around the house. 

My sister, my beautiful beautiful sister was murdered in one of the most gruesome ways imaginable. I remember the day the police came to our doorstep like it was yesterday. I remember how my mom sobbed in dads arms, I remember the pain, the anger in my dad's face. I remember the hole that opened up in my chest, that still hasn't been filled to this day. 

These things are better forgotten, but not even alcohol could drown my sorrows over the tragic loss of my sister, trust me, I tried.

A brown, small unmarked box was left on my doorstep, to say I was creeped out would be an understatement. Who does that these days? I considered just leaving it there, throwing it out maybe, but as the old saying goes, curiosity killed the cat, so I brought the box in with me. I placed it on the dining table and began brewing another coffee.

I was out on very early morning errands, and by the time I was back the box had found itself on my doorstep. 

All the time, it felt like the box was stabbing daggers at my back. I was growing uneasy, something felt off.

Still, after my first sip of coffee, I pulled the box closer to me and stared back. Eventually my shaky fingers moved to grab a knife and undo the tape keeping it shut. I slid the knife into the gaps and cut it open. 

What was I so stressed for? It was just a box. A peculiar, unmarked box, but still just a box. After one deep breath, I opened it up and looked inside. A black, rectangular object laid at the bottom with nothing else there. It looked familiar, after a moment of thinking it finally hit me. It was an old school video tape. 

My mind began considering all the reasons on why someone would give me a video tape, and more importantly, what was on it. My curiosity only grew stronger, and after another sip of coffee I made my way to the basement, I knew I had a tape player somewhere, I just had to find it. 

After a couple of minutes, I found it, there it was, all dusty and covered in webs. I had begun thinking that I thrown it out a while back, but thankfully I hadn't. after taking it upstairs and plugging it in, I put the tape in and took a seat. 

At first there was just static. I waited patiently with my eyes glued to the screen. Then it flickered, and finally an image formed. I couldn't believe my eyes. It was my sister, adjusting the camera with a big smile on her face. What the fuck is this? I said under my breath. Was this some sort of message to me? A goodbye video? Then my disbelief and joy turned into fury. Right there, next to her was her murderer, her killer, the one they never found. Like he never even existed. Brad. 

They met in a bar, Brad approached Emily and offered to buy her a drink. She politely declined, but Brad was persistent. She loved telling us the story of how he didn't give up, and eventually, instead of being creeped out, Emily was smitten, and they went on their first date. 

My eyes finally returned to the screen. Emily was kissing Brad, and then she put her arms in the air and Brad began strapping her in, tying her up... I knew Emily was into some crazy shit, but I never expected to see this side of her. I felt sick seeing her trust this asshole so much. 

As soon as Emily was strapped in, Brad's expression changed. His lighthearted and all too friendly smile suddenly dropped to a frown, even the light in his eyes dimmed. He picked up one of the many torture tools on the side, and began using them on Emily. She giggled and laughed at first. But soon, her laughs turned into screams of pain. 

I couldn't stop watching him torture her. I watched as the first blood spilled, I watched as the first cut appeared on her cheek. I watched and I watched and I watched, frozen in place, my head was in deep turmoil. What was this tape? Who left it on my doorstep?

She begged him to stop, but all he'd do is hit her harder, cut her deeper. Eventually her squirming and cries became stifled, exhausted. 

The doorbell rang. It startled me. I looked around the living room. It was pitch black. Have I been watching this sinister tape all day long? I walked up to the tape player and clicked on stop, the image frozen on my sister's lifeless face. The doorbell rang again.

"I'm coming!" I yelled back in frustration. 

Who could it be this late into the evening? 

I looked through the peephole, and exhaled the breath I didn't know I was holding. It was just my Girlfriend, Ashley. 

"Well, are you going to let me in or what?" She asked impatiently. I unlocked the door in response, she gave me a kiss and walked right past me and into the kitchen, she was carrying a bag. 

"Why are you standing there like you've just seen a ghost? Come on, we're cooking dinner together."

I completely forgot today was dinner night. She had already emptied her bag onto the counter as I walked into the kitchen, and had began preparing. It looked like ingredients for a simple pasta dinner. 

But my mind was elsewhere. The tape. The video of my sisters murder. The pit in my stomach was deeper than ever before. I felt a thousand different emotions, all of them tormenting my mind and my soul. My hate for Brad only deepened. 

It's not like I didn't try finding him, searching for him. The police told us this person called Brad didn't even exist. It was a ghost. It's like he disappeared into thin air after murdering my sister. 

"Alex? Are you alright?" 

I felt Ashley's warm touch on my shoulder. She was looking right into my eyes with a worried expression. "What's wrong?" I felt a tear rolling down my face. And then another, and another. 

I broke down into her arms. I never truly healed from that loss, and now it felt fresh again. Like it had just happened yesterday. She held me and let me let it all out. 

After I calmed down, I tried explaining it to her. The tape, everything. She was horrified and disgusted. 

We skipped dinner and Ashley called the police explaining the situation, while I silently sat on the couch, staring at the tape player. Something told me to look at my phone, so I did. It was 11 PM already. But then I looked at the date, it was the 11th of January. It was the 10th year anniversary of when my sister died. 

Was it Brad? Had he left this tape to fuck with me? Remind me of what he had done a full decade later? 

I was going to find him, and I was going to fucking kill him with my own two hands for this. 

To my surprise, the police arrived rather quickly, and it wasn't just the police, with them, a detective and the forensics team arrived as well. They asked us to leave my house and find a hotel for the night. "For your own safety." They said. Yeah, right.

Instead of finding a hotel, we decided to go to Ashley's apartment. I could barely sleep that night. The gruesome images playing in my mind on repeat. In the morning, I made myself an extra strong coffee, and just before lunch, the detective that was at my house last night reached out to me and asked me to come down to the station. I obliged and made my way there. 

"It's nice to officially meet you, Mr. Culliver, I am Detective Jenkins." 

The older woman introduced herself.  "It's nice to meet you too." I shook her hand. 

"Please take a seat." 

My hands were sweaty, and my legs were shaky. It wasn't my first time in a station, and the last few times hadn't been fun, and something was telling me this wasn't going to be any different.

"How long did Emily know Brad for?" 

Detective Jenkins immediately jumped into the questioning. I scratched my head. "I'm not too sure, roughly two years, give or take." 

She wrote something down, nodding and continued. "And how did they meet?"

"In a bar." I answered impatiently. 

The questioning went on for what must've been close to an hour. Every question had to do with Brad and his relationship with Emily. It felt wrong answering all these questions, but I could only hope it would help them catch the bastard.

After I finally got a moment of silence from the detective, I took the opportunity to ask a question of my own.

"Are you reopening the case?" Jenkins looked at me, really looked at me and sighed, fidgeting with her glasses. "Yes, we are." 

"But I thought Brad doesn't exist? He isn't in any of your systems?" 

Jenkins looked around the room uncomfortably. "I strongly believe in telling people the truth, especially people involved in this case."

"People? There's more?" I said in shock.

Jenkins nodded. "Brad has many other names, it's not just one person. It's a serial killer." 

My heart dropped, the detective continued. "It enters your life as a friend, a mentor, a lover, he earns your trust, and then he puts you through the most unimaginable torture possible." 

"But- but how come you haven't caught him yet?" My heart was beating out of my chest. This bastard has done this before? Even after?

"I'm afraid I can't tell you anything else Mr. Culliver, I thank you for coming down to the station to have this conversation with me." She gestured for me to stand up and leave. 

"But detective-" She cut me off before I could finish. "If we have any more questions for you we will reach out, so please don't leave town in the coming weeks." 

I nodded. It was clear she wouldn't say anything else, hell, I was lucky she had even told me this much. 

"Mr. Culliver." She called out to me as I was half way down the hall, I looked back at her.

The detective smiled. "We will catch him." I nodded.

"Not if I catch him first." I thought to myself.
