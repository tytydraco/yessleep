My name is Boswaldo. I am the esteemed butler of this Manor, and I take my duties very seriously. I run quite the tight ship indeed. Every nook of every cranny is meticulously inspected, and subsequently polished to utter perfection, by myself. Everything. Silverware, swords, antiques, armours, and any other such masterfully procured accoutrements, those are my domain. 

That is, except for spider webs... 
I cannot -nay, I will not- under any circumstances, permit myself to interfere with any surface on which they reside. I simply won’t. There is a ghastly spider which resides within these walls, and I fear for my safety should I ever dust, disturb, or otherwise deface its home. Luckily for myself, my master went blind a good many years ago, and so he is left completely unaware of the webs that curse his home.  
Now normally, in the morning, I bring a wholesome breakfast of pastries, coffee, and cigarettes to my master, but today, at his chamber door, loomed the aforementioned spider. I froze where I stood. Terrified of what it might do to me, what it was planning. It was just a tiny little thing, no bigger than a button. But in that moment, it had total dominion over me. I was sure I felt my heart grow still.  
And that is when my master called out to me. 
“Boswaldo? Is that you?” He asked.  
I tried to reply but felt as though I might choke on my own breath. 
“Boswaldo!”  
“y-yes sir it- it- it's me!” I stammered back, all the while staring at this dark thing in the doorway.  
“I’m waiting...” he said, rather impatiently. He was of course waiting for his breakfast; however, I saw no path before me to make it through his door unscathed and was myself waiting to suddenly drop dead. 
“Sp- sp-p-p spider! There- theres a sp- a spider sir!” 
“Well then just squish the bloody thing!” 
As always, my duties as a butler meant I must obey my master. I felt my heart beating once more. I caught my breath. And with a newfound sense of courage, promptly crushed the spider beneath my boot.  

Relief washed over me and all the ills I had felt seemed to melt away. I lay my master’s breakfast on his bedside and began the rest of my day. That night I slept wonderfully, I had finally freed this house, and myself, from this gruesome spider’s grasp.  

Now, you can imagine my terror when the following morning, once again at my master’s door, it stood. Yet this time, the spider was twice its previous size. I scoffed. Suspecting my mind to be playing tricks on me. This time I killed the spider before my own anxiety even had a chance to paralyse me. 

This went on for some time. Every morning, the spider sat there. And every morning, my shoe came down upon it. As the days had passed, so too did my fear. But yesterday, when looking upon a truly monstrous arachnid did I process just how large it had become. It was now as big and hairy as a house cat! This confirmed that it truly had been getting larger and I had not, in fact, simply been misremembering its size each morning.  
Cautiously, I raised my leg... Tensions were high and to be quite honest, I had to look away. There was a moment of stillness. And then, like lightning, my foot came crashing down. 

But the spider was not slain! It recoiled and hurried into my master’s chamber. I gave chase. Once inside, I caught up to it and jumped upon its head. That had done the trick. As I stood there, soaked in sweat, staring down at the beast, a voice pierced the silence. My master. 
“Boswaldo? Is that you?” 
I wiped the sweat from my brow, fixed my jacket and took a deep breath. 
“Yes master. Your breakfast sir.” I retrieved his morning comestibles and quickly saw myself out. 

I marched through the halls with vigour, for I had preparations to make. Based on what just occurred, I knew what the morrow would bring. And I, had to be ready. I fetched a rapier from the dining room and donned a suit of armour.  
That night, I dared not to slumber. I sat in my chamber and clutched tightly to the sword. My eyes were pinned to the door. Sometime later, the moon still about the sky, I began to hear a tapping. Sharp, terrible tappings against the wall. I knew it to be the spider, bigger than before. I could hear it, clambering around, as if adjusting to its new hideous size. As the night drew on, it became more nimble. More precise.  

As I sat there entranced, almost hypnotised by its lumbering, I heard something that chilled me to the bone. 
“Boswaldo? Is that you?”  
It was then that I realised he was no longer alone in his room. Shaking I rose from my chair and stepped out from within my chamber.  
In the hallway, as I crept forward, I felt every fibre of my being urge me not to take another step. But I did. And every step was a battle. And every sound I made, every breath, every clinking of my armour, felt as loud as thunder.  
Finally, after what seemed like a lifetime, I reached his door. And for once, there was no spider.  

As I went for the handle, I again felt as though I couldn’t go on. But I did. I opened the door. And I saw it on the bed. Feasting upon my master. As the beast turned toward me, I was completely at its mercy. Captivated by its inky eyes. There was no malice behind them. No seeming of hatred for me, the man who had killed it so many times before. It was just looking. And finally, I realised, our feud was not our feud. It was my feud. Against a creature which had done nothing more than stand in a doorway. Its greatest crime was that I had been afraid of it. I tried to tell myself that this spider had killed my master, but I knew deep down, I was the reason he was dead.  

Carefully I backed away, and slowly closed the door.  

I will not leave this manor. But I will not cause any more death. I know that before long, it will come for me, and I will join my 
master. 

If you find this post, pray, stay far, far away from here. And do not come looking for the spider.
