After high school, I was unsure of what I wanted to do, and my parents pressured me to pursue a college degree.

However, lacking a clear passion, I decided not to continue my studies and ended up working part-time at a local supermarket to earn some money. But soon, I grew tired of the place.  
  
   With time, I became accustomed to the dull and monotonous routine of my supermarket job. My life turned into a series of repetitive days, attending to uninteresting customers and packing groceries without purpose. Though I still dreamed of adventures and challenges, I resigned myself to a life without them.  
  
One day, as I walked through the mall after my shift, I noticed a sign advertising a security guard position. Though the job didn't sound particularly exciting, I decided to give it a chance. The pay was decent, and I needed the money. I thought that maybe being a security guard at a shopping mall could bring some action and excitement.  
  
When I applied, strangely, they didn't ask for a resume or work experience. They only inquired about my age, and although I was 24, my appearance made me look like I was 16. However, I wasn't exactly friendly-looking, being of average height and not particularly robust. It was common for people to mistake me for a child.  
  
I got the job, and they told me I would work from 8:00 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. They handed me two manuals: one was brown with a ribbon that looked like a bookmark, and it had an inscription saying "Security Guard Manual." I opened it, and everything seemed normal, just a typical work manual with the usual boring rules like strict schedules, regular rounds, prohibition of electronic devices, and so on. I put it away and started watching the instructional training video. Then they gave me the uniform, and I prepared to work.  
  
I was paired with a teammate named Eric. He was a bit stubborn, but overall seemed like a good guy. We started our shift and made rounds every hour, then returned to the surveillance post. The room had a monitor displaying different parts of the shopping mall through security camerasâ€”staircases, warehouse corridors, and everything seemed normal. 

One of the cameras even captured us in the security room. At around 10:00 p.m., I was watching the cameras when one had some interference. I thought I saw a figure in it and said to Eric, "*Hey, look, camera 23 is malfunctioning, and I see something moving. I'll go check it out. You stay here and keep an eye on the cameras*." I looked at the map and found the camera's location before heading there.  
  
When I arrived, I couldn't find anything strange. Everything was calm and peaceful. That's when I looked towards the camera, and what I saw shocked me. *O SHIT,*  There was no camera. Instead, there was something resembling a fleshy tube with smooth skin, and in it was a hazel eye, human-sized like a tennis ball, complete with eyelashes. The tube moved, carrying the eye from side to side, and then it fixed its gaze on me.  
  
I ran back to the surveillance room as fast as I could, only to find Eric on the floor with his eyes rolled back, foaming at the mouth, having a seizure. "*What the hell, Eric!*!" I shouted, lifting his head to prevent him from choking on his saliva. Then, I looked at the camera with interference, and it was now showing static. I called the administration number and informed them about what happened. After about 30 minutes, they arrived and took Eric, who was still in a state of shock, and left another guy in his place.  
  
Later, the manager called me in. *"What the hell, don't they know how to read?*" I wanted to protest given the circumstances, but I just nodded my head. Nowhere in the manual did it mention anything about strange things or the giant eye I saw. After everyone left, only my colleague and I were there. The new guy wasn't that different from Eric in terms of demeanor.

He asked me some questions, but I remained silent, and he must have thought I was an odd one. Then, I took the manual and started going through it. Suddenly, a cloth envelope fell from the book. I picked it up and opened it, revealing a sepia-toned sheet that seemed to have been exposed to smoke. As I read it, I froze; the note contained a series of rules, and looking at them carefully, they were quite disturbing.  
  
The note read as follows:  
  
1- All guards must perform a security round at midnight, but they must do it in complete silence and without using flashlights. Any unusual noise or sight of shadows should be reported without mentioning the details of their origin.  
  
2- Guards must never work alone in the shopping mall after midnight. If a fellow guard is absent for their shift, the mall must immediately call for administration to be evacuated until a replacement is found.  
  
3- If a security camera starts having interference and spots something, turn it off immediately. If it cannot be turned off, take a piece of paper and cover the spot on the screen where the camera's view is disrupted. Guards should ignore them and never attempt to investigate their location.  
  
4- Occasionally, guards might see a shadowy figure on the security screens, even if no one is present in that area at the time. If this occurs, guards must remain calm and continue with their duties.  
  
5- If guards experience strange occurrences during their shift, they must record them in the security report without giving too many details. The report will be sent to an unknown address.  
  
6- Guards must not use the shopping mall's elevator under any circumstances. It has been reported that on some nights, the elevator stops at an unknown floor for no apparent reason.  
  
7- During the mall's closing process, guards must turn off all lights in an orderly manner. They must never leave unexplained dark areas and must never look directly at mannequins or statues that might be in the stores.  
  
8- If guards find personal items in unusual places, they must not touch them and must report it immediately to administration. These items might belong to visitors who are no longer present.  
  
9- If guards hear a whispering voice during the night, they must avoid following its origin and never respond to it. They must stay alert and report the incident.  
  
10- Guards might encounter another guard they do not recognize during their shift. They must not ask questions and simply continue with their work without interacting with them.  
  
11- If at any time you come across a mannequin that DOES NOT have a navel, you must keep your gaze fixed on it and walk to one of the information booths in the mall. Grope the cabinets until you find a pair of  
  
 rubber gloves with thick gold embroidery. DO NOT REMOVE YOUR GAZE FROM THE MANNEQUIN!! Then, approach it and grab its waist with the gloves on, making sure no other part of your body touches it. Then take it to the elevator, call it, put the mannequin inside, use the elevator mirror to press the number - 4, and close it.  
  
12- If between 3:00 and 5:00 in the morning, you receive a call from me, answer and listen to what I have to say. Do not say a single word or respond to any of my questions. When I bid farewell, you just reply, "Fall asleep."  
  
I seriously questioned whether I should continue working there, but I needed the money, and given the camera incident, I assumed that if the note told me to avoid it, it was there to help me, so I stayed. When midnight came, I set out to do the night shift with Frank. 

I told him that we should follow those rules without questioning how strange they might seem. We went on the rounds through the central corridors of the shopping mall as per the rules, without flashlights, moving in complete silence. The mall wasn't pitch dark since it had a glass roof spanning from one side to the other, and the light of the crescent moon provided some illumination. The mall was perhaps as long as a football field.  
  
We walked in complete silence, trying to avoid making any loud steps, but we were moving at a brisk pace, perhaps out of fear of being in the dark. Frank was on one side, and I was on the other, about 20 meters apart from each other. Then, I heard music that sounded like a distorted 1950s rock and roll, as if an old record player with a worn-out needle were trying to play an ancient vinyl.  
  
I glanced towards Frank, but it was dark, and I could only see his silhouette. I signaled him to look at me, but he didn't respond. The music gradually lowered, becoming deeper, and I signaled to Frank that we should turn back. That's when something touched my shoulder, and my heart skipped a beat. I mentally screamed, "*I'M DEAD*!" I turned around to see what had touched me, and then Frank whispered, *"We have to go back. I heard a child crying*." At that moment, I felt great relief but also great terror because the silhouette on the other side was not Frank; he was behind me.  
  
The rest of the night went by without any problems, and in the morning, I made a report of everything that had happened. The manager patted my back and said, *"Well done, kid. Follow the rules, and everything will be fine.*" I remembered that I had signed a contract to work here for a month, with a fine penalty if I quit. That was the last thing I needed right then.  
  
Tomorrow, I have to go back...
