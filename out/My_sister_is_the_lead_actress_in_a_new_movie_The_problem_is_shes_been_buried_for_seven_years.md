Me and Elise were never close. We had a five-year age gap, and while I was just a kid playing with my Nintendo DS, she was always this astonishingly beautiful, blonde girl.

But her gaze was always lost. Transparent.

Then, at a certain point, the drugs and the parties came along. My parents weren’t the best, but the fights were always Elise’s fault. I never really understood her—maybe I never even tried to. Obviously (and now, as an adult, I actually get that), she must have been crying for help. Maybe she was depressed. Maybe she had some personality disorder.

But I guess I’ll never know.

I need you to understand:

Elise didn’t “go missing” in a poetic, unsolved-mystery way.
She ran.
She left behind a note, a bag, and a house that hated her.

They found her weeks later in a drainage canal three towns over.
It was her.
DNA-confirmed.
Maybe it was suicide. Maybe she slipped.

But we never saw the body. “Closed casket,” they said.

Mom chose a white one, carved with flowers on the sides. It was so saddening, but so beautiful. It was perfect for a beautiful girl like her.

We buried her under a willow tree.

I was twelve.

And I never stopped wondering what her last minutes were like.

After years and years of therapy, I was left with a lot of grief. and an uncanny feeling of calmness when I watched horror movies. It was the one thing that still made me feel something. The anxiety, the dread, the small thrill of being hunted from the safety of my sofa. It made my heart beat faster.

It was better than nothing.

That night, I was on a horror Discord server. Bored out of my mind at 2AM, asking for fucked-up movie recs. Not slasher gore. I wanted weird. Something that felt wrong to watch.

Some guy with a pixelated anime PFP sent me a private link.
No context, just: “Watch alone. Use headphones.”

It was a .mkv file. No source. No upload date. Just one word:
Grievance.

The thumbnail? A blurry still of a girl half-submerged in water, eyes wide open like she’d just seen God.

I thought I’d found the perfect way to spend my night.
I guess, in a way, I was right.


The start was slow. It seemed like an eerie build-up, but also… it never seemed to start. It was weird. Clearly experimental.

The scene was set at night. You could hear someone breathing, and it seemed like a POV of the person breathing.

That someone was frantically looking around and their panic was increasing second by second, but they weren’t moving. On the corner of the screen, I could see their feet were tied up. You could hear someone getting closer. Step by step.

After maybe five full minutes of just faint footsteps approaching, the title appeared:

GRIEVANCE, in an outdated serif font.

Then, a man appeared in the frame, pacing through the grass.
Cut to black. Sound still on.

There was a really well-done scream. (At this point I was impressed.)

The screen was still black while in the background you could hear a man and a woman struggling.

When the camera finally turned toward them, I thought I was about to throw up.

I didn’t quite realize it at first. The woman had her back to the camera. But then, while struggling, her blonde hair shifted and revealed a badly done tattoo on her shoulder, right next to the strap of her tank top.

That was fucking Elise.

I was sure.

I remembered the huge fight she had with our parents when they found out she’d gotten that god-awful stick-and-poke.

And then I just sat there and watched the whole movie, helpless.

Typical revenge narrative: girl gets killed, resurrects as something else, haunts her killer.

What. The actual. Fuck.

I was shocked.
Actually, fuck that.
I was terrified.


The rest of my night was restless. I spent it scouring the internet for info about Grievance.

After some digging, I found it had great reviews on Reddit. People said it was a mysterious indie film, so underground that even the actors’ and director’s names weren’t known.

I found a post buried in r/ObscureHorror, like a hundred comments deep. Everyone talked about how “raw” the lead performance was.
“Too real,” someone wrote.
Then one guy said:
“That scene by the canal? Shit made me cry. How’d they get that performance?”

Canal.

I froze.

I hadn’t told anyone that detail. It wasn’t public. No articles ever mentioned the exact location.

I looked up the canal again. News archives. Police reports. I dug through everything I could find.

Then I found it—an old Facebook post from a kid at Elise’s high school. It was from the week she disappeared.

A blurry phone photo from a party. Elise was there. You could see the same tank top from the movie. Same hair.

But the fucked-up part?

In the background—barely visible—was a man. Standing in the dark behind the trees.

He looked like the guy from Grievance.


I shut my laptop.

The room felt too small.

I took a break from horror after that. For like a week. Then I caved.

I searched the link again. Gone. The Discord user? Deleted.

But the file was still in my downloads. Just sitting there.

I opened it again. Just to skim through. Just to be sure.

But this time, it was different.

There were no actors.
No screaming.
Just the canal.

Ten minutes. Uncut. Static camera. Wind moving the branches. Nothing else.

Then, at minute 7:23, Elise walks into frame.

Older. Pale. Soaked.

She looks up.

Not at the camera.

At me.

Like she could see through the screen.

She raises her hand, and—

The footage glitches.
Freezes.
Black screen.

Then one final frame:

A gravestone.

Mine.
Full name.
Birthdate.

No death date.

Just a countdown timer.
Starting from 72 hours.

I didn’t sleep.
Didn’t eat.

That was three days ago.

When the timer hit zero, nothing happened.

For a moment, I thought I’d made it all up. A stress hallucination. A weird ARG.

I took a shower. Got dressed. Started to laugh about it.

Then I got a text from my mom.

“Hey, sweetie. Have you visited your sister recently?  I had a weird dream and she was in it. So I finally decided to go to the tree today and I found fresh flowers. Was that you?”

She attached a photo of the willow tree. Our old backyard.
There was a bouquet of lilies on Elise’s grave.
We hadn’t been there in years.

I hadn’t told her anything.

I went to the mirror.

My reflection didn’t move with me.

Behind me—blurred, but there—was the canal. And a figure. Drenched. Blonde.

I turned.

Nothing.

I turned back to the mirror.

Closer.

Not smiling.
Just watching me.

It’s been happening more. I see her in reflections, in dreams, in the gaps between frames on my screen.

Last night, I saw myself sleeping from outside the window.
But I live on the third floor.

Tonight, I’m watching the video again. I don’t know why.
Maybe I want answers.
Maybe I want to see if it ends differently this time.

The file changed names. It’s no longer Grievance.

It’s called:
Reunion.mkv

I think this time, I’m not watching her.
She’s watching me.
