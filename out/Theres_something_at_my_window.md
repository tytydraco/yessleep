I have suffered from hallucinations for as long as i can remember. 

i’ve always seen things that aren’t there, or heard things that others couldn’t.

a psychiatrist told me and my family that it was due to a “severely overactive mind” and i was given medication for it and for the most part, it’s helped. 

this all happened a few nights ago and im still shaken about it. 

I’d been up way too late, a bad habit of mine i can’t seem to kick, and when i finally got into bed i heard scratches at my window. i didn’t think anything of it because it was a common auditory hallucination i’d have so i climbed into my bed and tried to ignore it. but i couldn’t. it was like someone was trying to open my locked window by lifting it up from the bottom and it was really beginning to get on my nerves. 

it had been like, fifteen minutes at this point, so i did something i’m not really meant to do, i reached across to my nightstand and took a few extra pills, more than im meant to, anything to get rid of that damn scratching. 

a common side effect of my medication is severe drowsiness, and because i’d already taken my daily dosage and some, it was hitting harder than normal, and quickly my vision got hazy and dark and i passed out. i woke up a few hours later to my cat hissing and scratching and practically screaming at something, my eyes were still adjusting and i was having trouble finding him in the dark room, but i saw him eventually, and when i did i realised, he was hissing at the window. the same window id heard the scratching from. 

i was struggling to move, my body was half asleep and i felt like i was hauling around 20 extra kilos, but eventually i pulled myself upright and stumbled to my window. and to my shock the scratching stopped, as if something was expecting me, i reached out to the white panel blinds and i pulled them up, and what i saw made me feel sick.

it looked like a person… but not, like you’d taken a person apart and put it back together with the wrong blueprint. it had every feature of a person, nose, mouth, eyes, i only got a good look at it for 30 seconds at most but the image is burned into my mind

i barley had any time to react before it reached up a gaunt, boney hand and smashed through the window, sending shards of glass everywhere, my cat immediately jumped at it, which didn’t end well for him, the thing grabbed him and bit into his stomach, spilling guts and blood all over itself, luckily for me, it was a good distraction and the creature wasn’t paying attention to me, i turned to run but my legs felt like they were made of wood, and i buckled and cut my hand open on a shard of glass from the broken window, i stifled a yell and i stumbled to the bathroom before locking the door. 

i sat there for a few minutes, trying to process what i saw, and then i heard something. a voice. the voice of my father

“come out daniel, please, i need to talk to you”

it sounded like my dad but wrong, like a recording playing backwards. 

i didn’t respond and the thing was getting angry. it started banging on the door and shouting, the facade of my fathers voice breaking to reveal a deep unearthly string of incoherent screams

the door started to splinter, chips of wood and paint flying off in different directions. 

BANG BANG BANG BANG

it was so loud, i could hear the wood and acres groaning under the pressure, and then a hand broke through. and i heard a sickening, disgusting voice call out. 

“LET.. ME… IN”

it sounded like it pained the creature to talk, it sounded like 100 crows all cawing in unison, creating twisted words that made my ears bleed

i knew i didn’t have much time, so i smashed the window and jumped out

that went as well as youd think it would, i landed on the ground and i heard my foot crack, but i couldn’t stop, i knew if i stopped it would get me, i kept telling myself this was just an episode and id wake up in my bed, and everything would be okay, but the longer it went on the more real it became, i hobbled to the main street before i finally felt safe and begged a stranger to call the police for me. 

i mean, who’s gonna ignore a distressed man covered in blood and with a mangled foot

the police swept the apartment. my front door had been kicked off its hinges and my cat (rest in peace) had been reduced to a pile of blood fur and bones that were picked clean. 

i’m currently at my parents, but i don’t feel safe at all. i have no way of telling if it knows where i am, but i can only pray it doesn’t. i pray to god it doesn’t.
