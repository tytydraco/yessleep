I was returning from school using the same path I always use but I saw something different, I always pass near a forest on the way, when I was passing I saw a book hidden under some tree leaves as if someone was trying to hide it I removed the leaves and took the book, It was a diary and it was covered in blood! I took the diary home when I arrived I went straight to my room and opened the diary and started to read. At first it looked like a normal diary, it was a 16-year-old boy named Ivan, he has 4 friends and is very popular at school, but that doesn't matter, what matters is knowing why the diary is covered in blood and hidden in a forest. I was trying to find more information but I was interrupted by my mother calling me to see a news on TV, 4 young people missing

after camping in the woods and the names were Ivan Jenny Sam and Lenny exactly the names that were in the diary. I ran to my back room and went back to Reading the diary it was a pretty big diary so I skipped through the pages until I found something interesting, after a while I finally found something interesting. Ivan was wanting to go camping with his friends the day after that record was written on 02/01/2023 2 days so he went camping yesterday it makes sense because I only saw the diary today, well I flipped through two more pages and found the entry for 03/01/2023 I will finally find the answers. their friends left the house in the afternoon they took a taxi and arrived at the campsite, it was normal until the night arrived and Ivan started to hear strange noises coming from the forest but he ignored them if

they had so much fun until it was time for bed then Ivan stopped writing I turned the page and more writing from Ivan but it was different his handwriting got worse like he was writing fast he said he woke up in the middle of the night to the noises of screaming it was his friends appeared 3 people with masks full of thorns and holding big axes they all ran and separated through the forest Ivar wrote this while he was hiding behind one of the trees covered in blood and counting his last records. He was trying to get out of that forest but he was just going deeper into it, he found a door in the ground hidden by leaves a kind of hiding place he went in and there were his friends being devoured by something and the murderers were there one of the murderers threw an ax in your

arm but he managed to escape his hiding place he ran a lot and saw the end of the forest but he had already lost a lot of blood he lay on the ground he wrote all this his last words were "If you found this diary don't call the police or something like that they they are possessed they are more than murderers there is something in that place it may look like i'm crazy but no i saw it and something grotesque i don't want other people to get hurt i'll hide this diary here and if you found it tell other people so they never go there forest"Well I don't know what I'm going to do maybe if I say this to someone no one will believe so I'm posting here give me suggestions on what to do do I call the police or do nothing?
