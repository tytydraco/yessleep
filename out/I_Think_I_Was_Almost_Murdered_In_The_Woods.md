When I lived in America, in Florida. A guy I'll refer to as T lived in a farmhouse at the back of a nearby field. I lived in a wooded area next to a creek that ran past both our places. The area was rural, the nearest shop of any kind was 10 miles away. He had been best friends with my roommate M until they were 13 and had a falling out.

T's sister P had been missing  for a handful of years and his parents were both dead. There were rumours that he killed his sister and it seemed to be common knowledge amongst the 100 or so people that lived in the area. 

M's parents and sister E lived near the road and we had to go through their garden/yard in order to get to the road. E told me 3 different stories about how and why T killed his sister P.  In every one of them, it seemed like she was trying to convince me that T was a great guy and the killing was an accident

I didn't know why she was trying so hard and why her story kept changing. Then one evening she started talking a LOT and I wanted to get home before it got fully dark out. To get to where I lived, I had to walk through her huge yard which was surrounded by woods, down a narrow wooded path and then into the clearing the house I was staying in was carved into. Woods all around it. 

But E kept talking and now it was dark out and she was talking about this guy T killing his sister P again. She said some things that made me feel like she was almost quizzing me to find out what I thought about him and if I trusted him. (He had been to my door a few times, knocking and looking for my roommate and I refused to answer it.)

I ended up saying something like his energy is so evil and dark that I can't be around him,and he carried the energy of death in his eyes. I said this as I was walking away from E's screened in porch where we had been outside talking. I was carrying a piece of birthday cake with me, to give my roommate who's birthday it was. He was asleep back at the house.

Less then a minute later I reached the wooded path to my house and suddenly heard a branch snap behind me. I stopped dead in my tracks and turned around. I saw a tall shadow entering the path and then heard T calling over to me "don't worry, it's just me, T"

WTF? He had to have been listening to me and E talking about him, from the woods near the creek and was now following me home. If I hadn't heard the branch snap would he have even sad anything? I felt a chill over my entire body. What do I do now. Run? My door was locked. He was tall and would catch me in the woods before I even made it to the clearing, let alone trying to get a key into the door lock.

I realised  then that he wanted E to ask me if I trusted him and believed he was innocent and that she had kept me after dark intentionally. I kept walking down the wooded path, and T came up beside me and when he saw the piece of birthday cake he said "today would have been my sisters birthday too." I hear my own voice come out like a squeak as I said "Oh.really?"

Then he said that she took off one day and never came back. I was positive that this guy was about to murder me in those woods. I really do believe that he was trying to decide whether or not to kill me and whether he would get away with it. It was like I could hear the scales of judgement creaking its gears inside his head.

Then, we got to the clearing, I started banging on my own door to wake my roommate up because I was too afraid to use a key and then get pushed inside and murdered by this guy. M came to the door and looked shocked and actually scared when he saw T.

I went inside and they talked outside for a while and then T left. About 15 minutes later we heard the sound of car after car whizzing by and a LOT of cop cars going past E's house out by the road. This was a rural area so even one was rare.

The next day we found out that P's body had been found a half mile away. There was an old cemetary in the woods, just off the road. and at 3am E was at T's house, in bed with him and woke up to a swat team with those red lasers coming from their rifles and trained on E and T.

Someone had reported the location of P's body and told the police T killed her. He for some reason knew or suspected he was about to get caught. Maybe someone gave him an anonymous warning. But because I was the only outsider not native to that area he must have thought it was me.

 E was quizzing me on that porch while he listened and she basically set me up to be potentially silenced on the way back through the woods with the birthday cake. She didn't even mention she was seeing him, and that she was going to be spending the night with him.

I'm guessing he had been hiding out by the creek, and E's house. Not wanting to be home and wanting to see if police cars went past. Then E called me to lure me over to pick up that piece of cake for my roommate. After I said T's energy was evil and dark he must have decided someone told me where the body was and I called it in.

After following me back through the woods he for some reason decided not to kill me and after talking to my roommate he kept walking all the way back to his farmhouse which was so far away from the road, he wouldn't have seen or heard those cars. M's sister E had to have been lurking along behind us on the path, waiting to assist him or distract her brother  (My roommate M)

Then she followed him back to his place, so they both missed seeing all the cop cars going past.

It turns out it was NOT T's sister P's birthday that day. He lied to me when he said that. Also, her cause of death was several gunshots to the face. In all of E's stories about accidental killings she said things like he pushed her and she hit her head. She also kept telling me where the body supposedly was. Places where it was not.

The weirdest part about this for me is that I feel like I was almost murdered for being suspected by the murderer of getting him caught. Just because I wasn't born there and have a different accent. But whoever really did turn him in had to have been really close to him because they knew what really happened and where P was buried.

So basically yeah, I think T almost murdered me, in the woods, a half mile from where his sisters body was. Fifteen minutes before she was found.
