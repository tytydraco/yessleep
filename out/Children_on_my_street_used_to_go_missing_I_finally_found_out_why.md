(TW: child abuse) Contrary to rumor, I hadn’t the slightest inkling about [the true source of the garbage smell](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/151cbuk/children_on_my_street_used_to_go_missing_i_found/) when I was growing up. I believed my father when he told me it was just the pipes in the walls. You see, I had a very ordinary girlhood, playing with other children in our quiet little cul-de-sac in our sleepy neighborhood shaded by oak and sycamore trees. There were whispers, of course, of a predator. And an undercurrent of fear. But like most children, I remained blissfully secure in my certainty that the adults in my life would protect me. Indeed, in all my wildest imaginings, I couldn’t have conceived that behind my father’s gentle smile was a man who could murder my playmates in cold blood, chop apart their bodies, and stash them behind the walls.

But there were signs.

He kept an axe downstairs in the basement—always sharp, yet we had no chimney or fireplace or any wood to chop.

Our home underwent frequent renovations to “fix” leaky pipes or add improvements like false walls. Strangely, it was often *after* these adjustments that a rank, rotting odor would permeate.

When my father finally confessed, I learned that the murders began long before my first memories of the disappearances. Began before I was born, in fact.

It was my mother who was afflicted.

\*\*\*

He never knew where the affliction came from. Just that after I was born—mere days after, in fact—she tried to strangle me. He saved me just in time, and she was hospitalized for postpartum psychosis. My father bottle-fed me, my sole caretaker during my mother’s intensive treatment.

She came back restored, and their lives returned to the normal joy of newlyweds with a cherished infant…

… until the evening he found her bleeding out in the bathtub, and me unresponsive, drowned beside her.

Frantic, he scooped me out and rushed to revive me. Wept when I finally coughed and drew breath. Screamed at my mother, while desperately trying to bind her wrists, but she grabbed hold of him and said, sobbing, “I tried… I tried… all I wanted was an ordinary, normal life…”  Then she whispered something to him that, in the moment, he assumed must have been a sign of her madness. She bled out before he could save her.

“What did she say?” I asked, sitting across from him in the cramped interview room where he confessed to me.

“That she was sorry, but it wouldn’t let her die without…” His next words were mumbled so quietly I missed them.

“’It’?” I echoed.

“*It* made me do all this. I had to or *it*… *it* wanted me to hurt you.”

“Dad, what is ‘it’? You’re saying you’re possessed? That it’s some kind of demon?”

He sighed. Ran his fingers, dark with blood from picking at the scabs on his arms, through his unwashed hair. It was strange to see him in such a filthy state. He was normally so well kept, almost effete. “A demon. Yes,” he said tiredly.

“So why didn’t you try an exorcism? Call a priest, or something?” The whole demon excuse sounded like bullshit.

“I *tried*!” he burst. “Don’t you think I tried? It started right after your mother died—these small, tiny urges. Almost insignificant. I’d see you, sleeping so soundly there, and I’d think… what if I put the pillow over her? What if I… squeezed her tiny little hand until it bled? What if instead of tickling those little toes, I just bit them off?”

“Dad!” I recoiled, disgusted.

“*I didn’t want these thoughts!*” he shouted, fingers curled into claws that he raked across the back of his neck. “I didn’t want them! They came in. And they got… *louder.* More *insistent…* I couldn’t tune them out. I don’t know what it was, or… I thought it was just a sickness in me. I went to doctors. Psychiatrists. I doped myself up. I tried priests, prayer. And yes, I did a *fucking exorcism*!” My father never swore. It was strange to hear coming from his mouth. “I tried all of it! But it wouldn’t stop… the only thing that made the voices still was…”

“Was what?” I asked, as he got this faraway, haunted look. And I knew he was reliving something. Reliving what though? Killing children? Taking apart their small bodies? Burying them in the walls? I shuddered, sickened. “Was *what*, Dad?”

“Giving in,” he said finally, eyelids fluttering closed. He dropped his head in his hands.

“Giving in,” I repeated. “So, what, you just started stalking children?”

“No! It… i-it was gradual… I… I started with animals…”

“The pig,” I said, color draining from my face as I remembered his first attempt to teach me butchery, at age seven.

“No… no, long before that. I started with chickens.” He sighed. “I discovered that killing—*any* kind of killing—left me free for a while. But… within a few months, the whispers would come back louder, and I’d have to escalate. Like… like upping a dosage.” He rubbed his eyes. “Finally I understood the strange, black moods that gripped your mother, brewing until she… she—”

“Don’t you blame her!” I growled, clenching my fists. “What happened to her was *tragic*. Don’t you dare pretend you’re like her!”

“Oh, Sadie...” He shook his head. “Of course I’m not like her. If I were, you’d be just another family secret, buried like your dead aunt or like what Uncle Rudy did to that girl, conveniently forgotten so your grandparents could pretend to have perfect families. Your dead mother was a pretty picture on your dresser, tragically ‘passed from illness,’ they always said. But it wasn’t like that when she was alive. She was funny, smart, charming—but also deeply, deeply difficult. Since you’re asking for a *confession*, Sadie… the murders in our family didn’t start with me. Everything began with her.”

\*\*\*

My father met my mother at an event at the Chinese Culture Center where both their families were occasionally involved. Neither my father nor my mother were much interested in the goings on, and the pair of them escaped together to spend the evening walking and chatting, lost in each other’s company. They fell very quickly in love, and conceived me out of wedlock—much to the chagrin of both their families. They married to appease the older generations. But by all accounts, they were happy.

Happy, that is, except for the shadow that descended over my mother.

One night, my father told me, as she lay in bed beside him, her belly round and heavy with me, she asked him if he was superstitious. Did he believe in spirits? Demons? What about the idea that twins could feel each other after death?

“No,” he said. “I don’t believe in any of those things. Why are you asking?”

“I bet,” she said, with a strange and strained smile, “you didn’t know I had a twin sister…”

He didn’t. In fact, he thought she was joking at first. He only confirmed the existence of her twin later, speaking with her grandmother, who admitted that the twin had drowned tragically at the age of twelve in the neighbor’s swimming pool. The family was devastated. How she’d drowned in relatively shallow water, with a floating pool toy nearby, when by all accounts she was a skilled swimmer, was a mystery. It was also strange she’d been found alone, given the twins were usually inseparable. As for my mother—to have her twin ripped away from her at such a young age was like losing half her soul. She burst into tears whenever her sister’s name was spoken to her. Yet, when she finally recovered, she blossomed like they’d never seen. And then she met my father.

“Dad… really?” I said. He never spoke much of my mother when I was growing up, and though I knew she’d died young after a struggle with mental illness, this was the first I’d heard of a sibling. “A *twin*? A twin you’ve never told me about, who you’re implying she fucking drowned?”

“Language, Sadie.”

I could’ve smacked him. I glared instead, enunciating each syllable: “Bull*shit*.” As his brow knit, I added, “Even if Mom had a sister, why would you assume there’s some deep dark secret here? You haven’t told me anything that would imply it wasn't an accident. Mom probably wound up with postpartum psychosis because she had unprocessed grief from losing her *twin*—”

“Not just hers,” he said, his voice suddenly devoid of inflection.

“What?” I blinked. When he did not explain, I demanded, “What do you mean? Who else has a…” I paused, blood running cold.

*Family secrets.*

His dark eyes leveled with mine.

“Dad,” I said, heart quickening. “Dad, who else has a—”

“Check your birth certificate.”

“You’re lying…” I would’ve known. He would’ve told me. *Someone* would’ve told me. This all had to be some… elaborate concoction, warping our family history to shift blame.

“She didn’t have postpartum psychosis,” he said. “I caught her just in time—to save you. Just you.”

“You’re lying!”

I don’t know why I fought so hard to discredit this particular part of his account. Especially when it could be so easily verified by a glance at my birth certificate, which I had at home. I suppose because it shattered the image (pre-children in the walls) that I’d had of our family. Like biting into a perfectly red and beautiful apple only to find that inside it’s black and rotten. Everything I knew about my parents was a lie—really, was a carefully curated image. And while I’d already given up on having a good father, I didn’t want to lose the ideal I held of my mother, too.

I couldn’t actually remember her, of course. There were only photographs of a beautiful young woman with an angelic smile, always with a flower in her long, glossy hair. Growing up I used to kiss her picture good-night, entranced by the tale of a young woman dead of a tragic illness. I suppose I imagined that she would have been the perfect parent had she lived. My father, who raised me with enough loving kindness to almost match my imaginary version of my mother, never disillusioned me about her perfection.

Until now.

His lips pursed, head cocked at my denial. Then he said, “Excuse me.” Turning away, he slammed his fist so hard into the table that I heard the crack of his knuckles as he broke them. I gasped, recoiling, as he hunched over his broken hand with his teeth clenched at the pain, eyes tearing, saliva and blood bubbling at his mouth. Then he sat up, cradling the broken hand, and said, “*It* was telling me to smash your face in.”

“Fuck,” I breathed.

“Now then. The children. Why did I start killing children. That’s what you really want to know?”

I didn’t. I didn’t want to know. But the officers who were monitoring our discussion would be appalled if I abandoned the interview now, just as he was approaching the critical point. So I told him I needed a bathroom break. I fled, and leaned over the bathroom sink, splashing cold water on my face from the faucet. I closed my eyes and put down my head, pretending for a few minutes that I was anywhere but here, interviewing my axe-murderer father about secrets I wished I’d never unearthed. Finally, I forced myself to look in the mirror. Into the face that had my mother’s high cheekbones and my father’s narrow eyes. The pair of them really had been a picture-perfect couple—what other rot would I expose if I dug deeper? Finally, I marched back out to the interview room to face the monster in my father.

\*\*\*

“I nearly suffocated you when you were five years old,” he said without preamble.

“What?” I had no memory of this.

“You were asking me a question. Just some innocent question. You had thousands of questions in those days. And sudden rage seized me and I just grabbed your face, cupped my hand over your nose and mouth, like this.” He mimed the action, his broken hand cradling the back of an invisible head and the other hand cupping over an imaginary mouth and nose. “The voices. They were *loud* that day. Deafening. Like… like church bells… They kept telling me to squeeze, so I held while you flailed and turned purple until you went limp.” His hands squeezed tighter.

In spite of myself, I felt my heart pounding. Felt myself counting the seconds. He kept squeezing, not looking at me, but at some distant memory. And then, abruptly, he let go. I exhaled, not even realizing I’d been holding my breath until his eyes flickered up to me again.

“You woke up in just a couple of minutes.”

“I… I don’t remember any of this…”

“Well… you *were* only five years old.” He paused. “… and I comforted you right afterwards and told you that you’d had a bad dream.”

“You *lied* to me,” I said, accusing.

He gave me a look. “Yes, Sweetie. I lied to you, rather than explain to you that Daddy was possessed and purposefully suffocated you.”

I glowered and crossed my arms. “Yeah sure. Good call I guess. Dad of the year.”

He actually laughed. Just a short little laugh, but it was the first spark I’d seen of the man I knew before he retreated into his shell again. “I didn’t trust myself with you after that, so I dropped you off with your grandparents. Then I tried to kill myself. A noose, a gun, sleeping pills. But *it* wouldn’t let me go through with it. I finally understood what your mother went through. Went back to your grandparents, and picked you up. Just like her, I was going to… to…” His voice cracked. He’d been numb telling me about the loss of my mother, but as he described his plans to end *my* life, emotion finally broke through. He put a hand over his mouth to hold in the sobs, and said, “Because of how I’d choked you, I was expecting you to be afraid, ready to have to coax you, but…”

He shook his head. “The moment I arrived, you just… flew into my arms. You were so *happy* to see me. ‘Daddy, Daddy!’ you said—so, so excited to be coming home with me! Beaming and smiling. And I just…” He blinked quickly. “I… I *knew* then that I was going to… to fight *it*. For a little while, just you were enough to keep away the darkness…”

He was crying now. I reached across, and he squeezed my hand, his fingers dirty and his nails crusted with blood. Then he let go, reached down and grabbed his shirt, pulled it up over his head.

I gaped, shrinking back. He’d always been so proper. Always in a button-down and, usually, a tie. I’d *never* seen him shirtless, not even at the beach.

His entire torso, front and back, was covered in crisscrossing scars, some deep, some shallow, some very fresh, but most quite old.

Hearing me suck in a breath, he pulled his shirt back on.

“I did try to fight it in all kinds of ways… but…” He shrugged. “It stopped working.”

And then… having finished the account of our family, he told me about how his own murders began.

\*\*\*

If you are here for all of the grisly specifics of each particular murder, which wall he tore open and which implements he used to take which bodies apart—you are in the wrong place. My goal isn’t to titillate with a gruesome recounting, but to understand *why*. Why in the walls? Why, specifically, children? In any case, my father spared me the worst of the details—that part of his confession he saved for the police. But as to the matter of *why,* I must begin with Mary Louis.

Her murder was unplanned.

“The voices were particularly loud that day,” he said of Mary. “I really did mean to send her straight home. But she… mentioned her mother was napping, how bored she was so she came over. I realized no one was likely to notice her missing just yet and… um…” He rubbed his face, unable to look at me. “I-I-I, um… I strangled her… hid her in the bushes behind the house until you were asleep, and then I, um… chopped her up and put her in the freezer… that’s when you caught me… when I was… cleaning…”

“Did you black out?” I interrupted, trying not to listen even as every detail burned into my mind.

“No,” he admitted. “No… no, it… It’s more like… a light switch turns off. A part of me just dims. While the voices turn up. Sometimes it’s hard to know what is me, and what isn’t. The fact I can’t distinguish… it makes it worse.”

This explanation didn’t inspire much comfort. Once the part of him that was himself switched back on, and the voices dimmed down, he panicked. Her body couldn’t remain forever in the freezer. Nor did he want to risk burying her in the yard and leaving freshly disturbed soil. But of course, my father was an architect. He was very, very good with compartments and compartmentalizing. As soon as I was back at school, he cleared out the closet under the stairs, walling it in so that the space was a foot shorter on the interior—a difference so subtle you couldn’t even see it with the usual boxes and bins stored under there. What he didn’t mention, but that I remember growing up, is he’d been genuinely fond of Mary. He kept drawings she’d made for him, and a little jar with feathers and some pretty stones she’d collected. I believed it was genuine when he sent flowers and letters of condolence to the family. But at the same time as he appeared to mourn her, he stepped over her body every night going up and down that staircase (as did I, unwittingly).

“Eventually… the horror faded,” he said. “I realized I wasn’t going to get caught. And I-I could almost pretend it was someone else who’d done it. For the first time… the very first time in *years…* I had… *quiet…*” He closed his eyes and lifted his face toward the ceiling. “The absolute perfection of that quiet… you have no idea, Sadie… how blessed that quiet was...”

I didn’t speak.

His eyelids fluttered open, and he returned his gaze to me. “Afterward… when the voices came back, I… started to plan the murders, whenever the voices got loud. The rest I think you can put together.”

I sat there, perfectly still. Now that he’d stopped talking, it hit me all at once—horror at the nature of his crimes, horror at the reason behind them. I couldn’t process it all. Not right then. There. In that room. And finally I said, “I need to go. I need to… I need to go…”

“Sadie!” He called after me as I stood up.

I looked back, sure that he was going to once again apologize. That he was going to tell me he loved me. That he was going to say he’d tried, and he was so sorry, and beg my forgiveness.

But he didn’t say any of that. He was *smiling.* And he said, with the most terrifying expression of anticipation that I have ever seen, “I was saving *you* for last.”

I gasped and fled.

\*\*\*

Despite his attorney’s insistence on a mental health evaluation, my father was declared competent by the courts. He entered a guilty plea and seemed unsurprised—relieved, even—when he was issued a death sentence. His time on death row was mostly spent in isolation. I was permitted occasional visits, but during these brief breaks from his solitude, we conversed very little. He’d ask how I was doing, trying to make sure I was keeping my grades up as I entered college—but then he’d go quiet. The rest of the time would just be the two of us sitting in silence while he bowed his head, slumped against the table.

On my last visit, my father asked me if I believed his account. I didn’t know what to say. I wasn’t in the habit of lying, and he almost always saw through me anyway. I just looked at him sadly. Finally I said, “I don’t know, Dad.”

“Am I just a monster?”

“Are you?” I wondered.

He sighed and whispered, “I don’t know either. But if it’s genetic you should probably go and get yourself regular visits with a psychiatrist, given the… affliction of both myself and your mother.”

“Already seeing someone.” Did he think I wasn’t, after all of this?

He rubbed his eyes. He seemed very tired. Finally he said, “You know Sadie, through everything your mother went through, and now me, the doctors told me demons can’t be real. That if there were ghouls, demons, spirits, ghosts, there’d be evidence. But murderers, child abusers, delusional psychopaths, serial killers—these are all *real*, and so, I must be one of these evil men. But…” He sighed. “It seems such hubris, to think that if we haven’t scientifically proven something that means it isn’t real. I mean, supposing there were… *things*… beyond our understanding? Things like I’ve told you? What do you think would happen when someone, who’s got what I’ve got, told the world? No one would ever believe them. And do you know, Sadie my love, that’s the worst part? That’s the worst part…” He put his head in his hands. It always distressed him very much when I didn’t believe him.

“Dad,” I sighed. “What is it you want? Redemption? Forgiveness?” It’s not like I could give him those things.

“You still don’t understand!” he burst. “You think this is about evil! This thing in me, it didn’t want those children!”

“Then why the fuck did you kill them? Dad, if it didn’t make you do it, then why? What do you—what does *it*—want?”

“The same thing,” he sobbed, “that I’ve wanted for years and years and years…”

As he spoke, for the first time in my entire life, I felt a chill in his presence. A chill that started at my nape and trickled down my spine like ice water. Deep. Gut-clenching. Heart-racing. *Fear.* Every instinct screamed.

I leaned back, and that’s what saved my life when he lunged, howling, “YOU!”

I fell over backwards, scrambling away while the guards rushed to restrain him. He writhed, screaming at me, spittle flecking his lips: “Get back here! Bitch! Fucking bitch! You’re a *terrible* daughter! Get back here RIGHT NOW!” He spewed invective, words that no man should say about his own daughter. In my last look at him, it almost appeared as if he was tearing himself apart, blood running down his face from where his hands tried to restrain his mouth. His fingers jabbed into his eyes, blinding him so that he couldn’t see me, so that when he shook the guards off (burly though they were), he groped sightlessly for me. I shrank against the wall as he just barely missed my foot, blood streaming from his eyes like tears until the guards caught hold of him again, and I fled.

\*\*\*

Victor Chen never completed his sentence. Nobody likes a child molester (which he wasn’t, but that was the prevailing assumption given the ages of his victims). He was found beaten to a pulp and his throat slit. Probably the guards looked the other way and let it happen.

To be honest, I think it was a mercy for him—his long ordeal was finally over.

But… I do think often about what he said at the end. If hauntings are confined only to the experiences of the haunted… how can we ever know? How can we tell the difference between a haunted man and a madman? I’m not sure you can. Certainly the courts and doctors couldn’t.

But whether “it” was real or not, I finally understand what he meant when he said *it* didn’t want those children. I should’ve figured it out sooner, simply based on what he told me of my mother. First she killed her twin sister. Then her own child—*my* twin. And very nearly me. All those she loved. As for why she never tried to kill my father—well, I think it’s because she did something much worse, cursing him with the most terrible fate of all. It was in her final words. The ones he mumbled so I couldn’t make them out at first. Her last words to him were, “I’m sorry. It wouldn’t let me die without *someone new*.”

\*\*\*

Which brings us to my father’s turn as host. All the children he killed. The ages ranged from 8-18. The last one had recently celebrated her 18th birthday—just as I’d been about to.

They were nearly always, in fact, girls my own age.

You see, this is what he meant when he said *it* didn’t want them. It wants what you love. It wouldn’t let him die. It wouldn’t let him rest. But, while he succumbed to its evil in every other sense, committing the most terrible of acts and becoming a quite literal monster… still, sometimes I think about the fact that, in the end, he managed never to give it what it really wanted. That in his own warped way, he continued protecting me. Because every one of my father’s victims was really just a stand-in, like stabbing a doll instead of the real thing—each murder just a substitute for me.

\*\*\*

I’d like to think he won. That he prevented it from getting what it wanted, *or* passing on to anybody else. That even though he couldn’t kill himself, it lost when his throat was slit, eliminating both him and it from the world.

But…

A couple weeks ago, I saw in the newspaper that a pastor from one of the local churches, a progressive-minded, goodhearted woman known for making prison visits and helping the most unfortunate in society, had been arrested for the abuse and murder of two elderly left in her care. When asked why she’d committed such a crime, this woman who for decades had served the community with kindness and charity, who by all accounts loved her clients very dearly, covered her face and said, with apparent confusion, a phrase that gave me chills in its terrible, intimate familiarity:

[“I had to.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)
