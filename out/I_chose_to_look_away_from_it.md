I would like to remain anonymous; I'll just call myself Josh. Anyways, I've lived in this house for about 19 years. It was built in the Early 1900s. There is just one thing that the house has that makes me want to not live in it anymore. That is...  


  
The basement, yeah, I said the basement, but there's just something about the basement that creeps me out. There is a bunker, I've tried to open it on multiple occasions, with guests, family members, and much more. They've tried to open the bunker in the basement as well, but it just doesn't seem to budge... That was until today. I went down to the basement to grab something when I realized something. The door was wide open for some odd, terrifying reason as if it was never locked close. Creepiest of all, the door was not just wide open, it had blood splatters all over it, even more on the floor when I came closer to it. I did not bother to look inside, but later did I know that would be a bad decision. I went back to grab my scarf quickly and headed right back upstairs. It was late that night and I decided to research about bunkers, nothing really surprising came up. So, I just decided to call it quits and lay down.   


  
Morning, I am up again, I am up earlier than usual, that's only because of what happened during the night. I had heard what had sounded like knocking, it was very faint, and it seemed to be coming from the basement. It also sounded like something was getting cut up, chopped into multiple pieces, and getting stomped on or eaten. Maybe it's my mind, but whatever is happening, it doesn't sound good.  
I have to go to work in a couple of minutes, so I'll update y'all when I come back from work.  


  
Evening, I am back from work, and the basement, it's still making that noise I heard from last night. I had just said "What the fuck. I'm done with this." I decided to shout, "WHOEVER IS DOWN THERE, LEAVE MY HOUSE OR FACE CONSEQUENCES."... That was a bad idea. It had stopped doing its things. I thought I heard footsteps; my stairs aren't too far from the basement bunker. Here's the thing though, whatever that was, it started full on sprinting towards the stairs, then I saw a glimpse of it. Whatever that was, it wasn't human like, then I looked away... I shouldn't have done that. It's now attached to me, it's like there is two versions of me now. Whenever I sleep, the harmful version of me wakes up, goes down to the bunker, and chops up bodies. I can't control it, it feels like sleepwalking, and I feel everything when it does certain things. The feelings of blood splatters, banging against the door, which is somehow locked during the second version of me being up.  


Please help, if anyone knows what the cause was or what the thing in my bunker was, how do I get it detached from me, if things escalate, I will update. For now, someone please help me...
