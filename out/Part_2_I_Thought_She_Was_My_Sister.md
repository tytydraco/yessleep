Hey guys, I ran into some trouble with the length while trying to get this posted. I had to split it into two parts. I hope you enjoy, and can hopefully help me to better understand this event. Here is a link to Part 1 in case you didn't see it already!

My Account (continued):  
  
The drive home was silent, between the hum of our car on the road and the darkness of the night around me I quickly fell asleep. As my mind slowed down, and I faded from reality, dreams filled my mind. I saw myself from the third person, sitting asleep in the middle row. I was nothing more than an observer now, confused but comfortable.  
  
I saw my grandpa driving the car, my grandma sitting next to him, an indiscernible conversation taking place between them. My younger brother was also fast asleep just a seat over from me sucking his thumb and as I brought my gaze back towards the front of the car I saw my sister.  
  
I could see her through the rear view mirror sitting straight up, having positioned herself in the middle of the car’s back row. She had one arm resting rigidly by her side, and the other arm was stiff and pointing straight up, bending at the wrist where her hand touched the roof. Her smile was wider than before, and there was drool dripping from the corners of her mouth.  
  
I watched in horror as she craned her head to the right, stopping when her gaze met my sleeping body. With one fluid motion she swung her arm in my direction and then grabbed my throat. I tried to scream at myself to wake up, but as she tightened her grip, I watched helplessly as my face and lips began to turn blue.  
  
She was now laughing, a deafening guttural laugh, my skin tone had now gone from blue to a dark violet shade of purple. Desperate to make it stop, I reached for my sister and pulled her shoulders towards me. She didn’t budge. I tried again, but to no avail. I was starting to panic now, pulling and tugging at her, watching as she only tightened the death grip she had on my throat.  
  
As far as I could tell, she didn’t see me or register that I was there. All she was focused on was my body asleep in the middle row. I need to wake myself up, it was now the only option that made sense to me. I positioned myself next to where I was sleeping and began to repeatedly hit my face.  
  
The sleeping version of me, didn't seem to register that he was being assaulted. Not only was my deranged sister choking me out, but in an almost theatrical performance I also was now punching myself hard enough to draw blood. My cheeks, forehead, and lips were purple, due to my lack of oxygen. My nose was broken and blood poured down my face and into my mouth.  
  
Horror spread itself through my body when my I saw my sister suddenly yank her hand back, her iron grip still trained on my throat. With a wet, soggy sound, my throat was ripped from my neck, blood spraying the car landing on my brother and grandparents. Though soaked in blood they didn’t seem to register what had just happened, and as I took in the crime scene before me that now looked like some sick version of modern art, my vision started to fade to black.  
  
I gasped violently as I sat up in my seat, goosebumps lining my small frame. I reached for my throat, afraid it was torn out, but realized that was silly as I had just gasped for air. My grandparents must not have realized I was having a bad dream, as my grandma turned slightly when I woke and formed a pleasant smile.  
  
"Hey grandma, how far are we from the house?" I asked, my mouth still dry from sleep, my heart still pounding from the disturbing dream beginning to fade into my subconscious.  
  
"We are almost home honey." Turning to my grandpa she said ,  
  
"Dan how much farther we got?"  
  
"Only about 5 minutes. Pat, can you wake your siblings? That amusement park musta been exhausting, you three slept the whole way home."  
  
"We were definitely very tired. I will wake them." I said, still apprehensive towards my sister who was fast asleep in the row behind me.  
  
I shook my brother away, his eyelids fluttering as he fought waking confusion. Before I reached for my sister, I instinctively glanced in the mirror, half expecting to see her chilling smile staring back at me. Thankfully she wasn't, and still looked to be peacefully sleeping. I shook my sister but she didn't wake. I shook her again, still no sign of her waking.  
  
"Grandma, Stace won't wake up." I said facing the front again. "I tried twice and she won't respond. Can you or grandpa wake her?"  
  
"Sure thing honey, I'll make sure she gets inside. Must have been an extra long day for her, she has never been a heavy sleeper."  
  
My grandma turned back to face the front and before long she announced that we had arrived home. I swung open my door and spilled out onto the half dirt half concrete driveway in front of the house. The sound of the ignition turning off amplified the already deafening silence, and the forest around me seemed to extend out towards infinity. My grandpa opened the door to the house, and ushered myself and my little brother inside.  
  
(I would like to take a quick moment to explain the layout of my grandparents house before I get into this part of my experience. My grandparents lived in a fairly large and spread out one story house, surrounded by the forest. They lived just on the edge of their small town and there were only a couple houses near them in their small neighborhood. The house itself was old, seeming somewhat outdated, but besides that it was a nice house. When you first enter the house through the front door, you are faced with a normal sized living room. To the left is a staircase leading to the basement and a hallway leading to four bedrooms. To the right is a doorway leading to the kitchen, and straight ahead is another doorway leading to the dining room with a view to the backyard and the forest surrounding it. Also in this room is the guest bathroom, just big enough for one person. With the house laid out in your mind, I will continue.)  
  
I walked straight through the living room and into the dining room, banking right towards the bathroom door. As I finished my business and turned to wash my hands, I heard the front door open, my grandma speaking to someone on the phone. I dried off my hands on a dark green towel hanging next to the sink and then opened the door, stepping back into the second living room. The house was awfully quiet when I exited the bathroom, confused as I no longer heard my grandmother’s voice coming from the conversation she was having on the phone just moments earlier. Where is everyone I thought as I slowly made my way back into the living room.  
  
The only light in the living room was a small lamp, resting on a stand next to the couch, providing just enough light for me to see my surroundings. Everyone must have gone to bed I thought as I turned towards the hallway lined with rooms, yawning as fatigue took hold of me. As I got closer, something in me told me to turn around. My gut was screaming at me, begging me to abandon the direction I was headed in. I stopped just before rounding the corner, taking a deep breath to steady myself, the warning my body was conferring to me stronger than ever.  
  
Prepared to face the unknown, I rounded the corner and came to an abrupt stop just shy of the hallway’s entrance. The light from the lamp behind me, cast a small sliver of light down the dark empty hall. As I scanned the long corridor, I noticed a figure standing by the back wall. They had their back to me and were motionless, resembling a mannequin you would see on display in a Sears department store. I stood still watching the figure as they remained motionless, but as I looked closer I realized it was a young girl. Her hair was dark and messy, hanging against her thin frame. She seemed awfully skinny, her limbs offset by the grey pajamas she was wearing.  
  
"He..hello who's there!" I said, raising my voice, but only enough for her to hear me. Silence was her response, no movement almost as if my words had fallen on deaf ears.  
  
I opened my mouth to repeat my question, when a quiet but high pitched giggle broke the silence reverberating off the walls of the hallway. The sound hit me and a wave of chills suddenly coursed through me. Instinctively I took a quick step backwards, resting my hand on the edge of the wall to stabilize my quivering legs. The ability to speak was now a notion of the past, as I helplessly watched the girl turn her shoulder towards me revealing half of her face-darkness obscuring her features.  
  
She gradually raised her arm in my direction, and as if this were some cruel joke with a single finger motioned me to come towards her. At that moment, I saw the image of my sister in the crowd, half turned and motioning me towards her with her finger. The girl at the end of the hall and my sister in the crowd were one and the same. A pitiful whine escaped my lips as I took another step backwards entering the threshold of the first living room. I kept my vision trained on who I now thought was my sister, fear boiling up inside me.  
  
Up until this point, my sister had never done anything strange or out of the ordinary. She was very grounded and mature for being only ten years old, so this behavior she displayed today was bone chilling. Her arm was still pointed in my direction, and as I looked closer I felt my body go numb. I tried to move but was frozen, unable to pull my sight from my sister. With no control of my body, I felt my foot lift and move me in the direction of the hallway. I no longer felt in control, slowly being drawn to the evil awaiting me at the end of the hall. Suddenly she spun to face the wall again, before she dropped her raised arm violently, bolting into the bedroom directly to the left of her. As soon as she disappeared from my view, I heard my grandmother’s voice.  
  
"Pat, could you come here real quick? I need some help in the kitchen."  
  
Now free from the grip that held me in place, I turned to face the entrance to the kitchen and called back,  
  
"Coming grandma, uh just give me one second!"  
  
No longer wishing to see what would unfold next, I started in the kitchen's direction, but stopped after a few steps, the sudden feeling of being watched to intense to shake. Turning around slower than I ever have, I looked back over my shoulder to the doorway my sister had ran into. In abject horror, I saw my sister peaking at me from around the corner of the door frame. Her horrific, stretched smile was on full display and her eyes were shrouded in all consuming darkness. There was blood pouring out of her nose, and her neck was bent at an unnatural angle, almost as if it was broken. I stumbled backwards, breaking from the trance-like state I had just found myself in. Practically falling into the kitchen, I saw my grandma washing the last of the dishes that were stacked in the sink. She turned to me, her hand outstretched a towel resting between her fingers.  
  
"Here Pat, could you dry these dishes quickly for me?"  
  
"Uh yes grandma, I think I can do that." I said, grabbing the towel and then standing next to her picking up the first plate from the soap soaked stack.  
  
As I dried the dishes, I couldn't help but imagine her still there, now farther up the hall peeking at me from another doorway. Any second now she was going to come bolting towards the kitchen on all fours, like the girl crawling out of the TV in the movie The Ring. As I set the fourth plate down though, I knew that she wasn't going to be coming any closer tonight.  
  
"Hey grandma, I have a question." I said hesitantly, the fear of her giving me an answer I didn't want to hear present in the silence that followed.  
  
"What's on your mind Pat? Something bothering you?" her eyes were trained on me, and I knew she could see the jumble of emotions proudly presenting themselves to her through my heavy eyes.  
  
"Did Stace come inside tonight? I know I couldn't get her to wake up when she was sleeping in the back of the car."  
  
"Your grandpa said he saw her walk past your brother's room, he assumes she went to her bed. The car is locked and I didn't see her when I looked through the front windshield. She should be inside now, Why do you ask?" Her voice seemed to trail off as she finished her sentence, as if she was suddenly much more interested in what I had to say.  
  
"It's probably nothing, but I swear I saw her smiling at me again from the end of the hall. It was the same face she made earlier in the crowd. It was dark though and I couldn't see very well. Maybe it was just the shadows playing tricks on me."  
  
"You know Pat, you've had a long stressful day. Don't let it bother you too much, I bet it was just your mind playing tricks on you. Let's finish these dishes so I can bring you to bed."  
  
I nodded my head to signal I understood, and then focused my attention on the dishes in front of me.  
  
After a little while I finished the dishes and followed my grandmother out of the kitchen towards the hallway I had just run from. I felt myself hesitating as we neared it, a cold sweat breaking out on the back of my neck. Reaching for my grandma’s hand, I grasped it and squeezed tightly in an attempt to stop the sudden onslaught of anxiety. I managed to keep my cool as my grandma brought me into my room and tucked me into bed. She then turned around and walked out the door, blowing me a kiss before disappearing back down the hall. I could just almost imagine my sister peeking through the small slit between the door and the door frame, her smile so wide it had split the skin at the corners of her mouth. Pulling the covers tight over my face, I hid myself from that thought, counting imaginary sheep jumping an imaginary fence, till a light sleep overtook me and my brain shut down for the night.  
  
The next morning I woke to find my door undisturbed, the terror from the night before now no more than a distant dream. As I left the bedroom and entered the living room, I was greeted by the smell of bacon and pancakes, as well as the distinct and strong acrid smell of fresh coffee. I had never had coffee, but with how much my dad drank swore by it, I assumed it must be pretty delicious. I entered the kitchen to see my parents, grandparents, and two siblings, all sitting at the table. I felt hesitant when I saw my sister, but fought the urge to distance myself from her, though to me it felt completely rational. They were conversing, going silent between bites of scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, and fluffy pancakes. Plopping into my chair my mom turned to me and said,  
  
"Morning sunshine, how did you sleep?"  
  
"I slept well enough, yesterday was interesting." I said, faking the cheery tone in my voice.  
  
"I'm so sorry we weren't there for you yesterday when you got lost. We still feel so awful."  
  
"Don't worry mama, I'm okay now I was just a little scared is all."  
  
"I know honey, but your papa and I still feel bad." She said as she turned back to eat her food.  
  
I picked up my fork ready to dig into the feast before me, when my grandmother touched my hand from where she sat across from me.  
  
"Pat, there is something I needed to tell you this morning when you woke up. Last night you asked if your sister made it inside. I told you she had, having been told by your grandpa that she went to her room. He was wrong though, and in turn so was I. Your sister never made it in the house last night."  
  
Inches from my mouth, my fork suddenly left my fingers and came crashing down on the ceramic plate that lay under it, the sound of metal on ceramic reverberating through the kitchen. Before I could truly process this information my grandma continued saying,  
  
"At around 3 AM last night your grandpa and I were awoken by the sound of someone pounding on the front door. Your grandpa left our bedroom quickly, grabbed his hand gun, then went to investigate the disturbance. I got up shortly after I heard him unlock the door, and welcome in the sobs of your sister. She was crying and shaking, barely making any sense, but after we brought her in and let her come to her senses we realized what had happened. After your grandpa let you and your brother into the house, I grabbed our belongings from the car and went inside the house. Turns out, the stress and exhaustion from our mishap at the amusement park had caused me to forget that your sister was asleep in the back seat. I assume she had lain down on her side, blocking her view from the front of the car. I should have checked to make sure she had made it inside but I believed your grandpa’s assurance that she was asleep in her room. Then you of course also asked me late yesterday if she was inside, because you swore you had seen her. Regardless, she never made it inside last night, it seems crazy, but we left her in the car.”  
  
I was overcome with the memories and visceral images of my sister smiling at me from behind the door frame of her guest bedroom. I no longer tried to hide the emotions I was feeling, horror awakening nausea in my empty stomach. This can't be true, God please don't let this be true. I saw her last night, I know I did. I'm not crazy right? Am I? Was she really not there?  
  
Thoughts came flying at me from all directions, as I closed my eyes tight, trying to make sense of this horrifying confession. I realized as I sat at the table, drawn far from reality, late last night as I stood at the threshold of the hallway, I had been moments from meeting evil itself. Whatever had taken hold of my sister craved my innocent soul, needing it for a reason still unbeknownst to me. It had entranced me and I knew that if my grandmother's voice hadn't broken its grip, I would have blindly followed the evil that gleefully awaited my demise.  
  
The rest of the trip was uneventful but far from peaceful. I chose not to say anything about it to my parents, aside from some small answers devoid of detail. I felt like reliving it and spreading the story would somehow give the evil more power, and a six year old didn't want to have that power lurking in his life. The events of that bone chilling night with time became distant, but they were not out of my mind.  
  
I couldn't help but see her everywhere I looked. She was always there, hiding in my peripherals, smiling and watching. Part of me felt like she was in on it, but the other part of me saw her as my sweet caring sister. Maybe there were two sides to her, the hidden side only shown to me and the sweet innocent side on display for the rest of society. Either way, I had decided I wouldn't mention it to her and instead let the nightmare fade away like every other memory that entered the dark recesses of my mind.  
  
Fifteen years later, I still feel the same as I did when I first saw her in the crowd of people at the amusement park. I have moved on from the fear of my sister, never having seen that smile again, but I still haven't shaken the terror that dug itself deep into me that night. Even now as I am writing this, a college graduate, fully immersed in the life of a 9-5 job, I still get chills when I let myself go back to the threshold of that hallway.  
  
I don't think I will ever understand what happened to my sister throughout that day. If her behavior in the hallway had been the only strange interaction I had with her during this day, I would have chalked it off as my mind playing tricks on me, forcing me to see things that weren't actually there. But the incident in the hall was the fourth time I had seen that unforgettable grin, and I know now that it wasn't a mistake, or a "figment" of my imagination like everyone else had tried to convince me it was.  
  
I wish I could figure out what had happened to her. Maybe that's why I am writing this, hoping someone can help me understand. Was something imitating her? Did my sister have a mental break? Had I succumbed to a mental break? These thoughts and many more are all trivial though, and don't bring the intense fear like the one question I asked myself the day after this all happened. To this day I still ask myself and those few who I have told the account to this question.  
  
***What was waiting for me at the end of the hall, and what would have happened if my grandmother hadn't called me into the kitchen?***
