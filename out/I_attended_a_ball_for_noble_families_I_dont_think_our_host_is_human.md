I'm not going to tell any real names nor my own. Not to protect anyone's privacy, but to favour my own safety.

I will need to put you into some important background first. I come from a rather comfortable family living in a southern European country. I'm the only child of a real estate owner and a lawyer. My grandparents were lawyers and real estate owners too. I also knew that all my four grandparents were born sort of wealthy, as it had always ran in all of their families.

They never mentioned much about my ancestors on my mother's or father's side, apart from some things here and there about the fact that they were a part of my country's aristocracy (mostly marquises), so I never gave it much thought. 

My parents absolutely repel any showiness or pretence, so this topic never fascinated them enough to make a family tree or anything related to that.

Two weeks ago, I was studying at the library when I received a sudden call from my mother in the middle of it.

She told me that they had received a citation from a notary upnorth. Apparently, my distant great-uncle (grandson of my great-grandparents' cousins), had passed away recently with no descendance and an ultimate death wish: to inherit the title of his marquisate and two palaces in the coast of Biarritz to the last descendant of the family line.

And that was me. A 19 year old history student.

I instantly thought of this as my time to shine: I would turn both palaces into AirBnbs and create my own sort of mini empire to assure a well-covered lifestyle. 

Oh boy, was I wrong.

Some days after receiving my rights to the marquisate, a strange email with an elegant but minimalist invitation in PDF attached to it was sent to me. 

It read like this:

>***Dear Lady \[my name\],***  
>  
>***We expect your attendance at this year's Annual Ball at (palace). It will be taking place next Saturday 25th of November at 19:00.***   
>  
>***Best regards,***  
>  
>***-\[well known woman in the fashion industry\]***

I thought I had heard of this event before, though. Some Vogue article, or Vanity Fair or something like that popped up on my screen a few weeks ago. It seemed like an old fashioned way to present young heirs and heiresses from extremely wealthy families all over the world to society, as a way for them to find a just-as-rich partner and enlarge their empire toghether (so lovely). In my country, some wealthy wannabes like to throw huge parties when their kid turns 18 just to show everyone that they will not throw a regular birthday party because “they are not poor”. 

But this… This was something else. Top tier aristocracy, the only few that made it out to the 21st century still as net-worthy as triple an imperial Fabergé egg, had also made it to the Annual Ball.

Why me, though? I was just new to this. I didn’t even want to get involved inside this social bubble, I just wanted to take up my luxury hotel managing fantasy and continue on with my life. I was just a teenage girl. What did this woman supposedly see on me? 

And *how* did she even get my email? 

When I told my mum I had accepted the invitation she was fuming. 

*“What do you even have to do with these people? For God’s sake, you don’t even know them, you cannot just go to a place like that all alone, this is surreal! Just go and study, that’s what you’re supposed to be doing right now!”*

But, hey, I am technically an adult, so my mother couldn’t beat me on that and finally gave in just by the condition that I would be accompanied by my friend Iñigo. Iñigo was born into a jesuit family and was also very well connected, so I thought he could make me feel more at home. He was Nico’s (my best friend since childhood) boyfriend. We shared common ideologies and had lots of things in common.

I didn't even own a gala dress, much less an Oscar de la Renta or Dior. I looked up and searched until I managed to thrift a John Galliano silk dress online that I would pay in installments (I'm literally a college student). It arrived in 3 days, and then I would be ready to take the plane next day and head to the ball with my dear friend Iñigo.

This almost sounds too good to be true, right? 

The big day came. Iñigo and I were staying at a hotel in Paris' 6ènne arrondissement . We ordered an Uber to the hotel and headed to the countryside. 

We were greeted by a giant metal gate with a Latin inscription at the top: *"ab hoc momento pendet aeternitas”*. 

The driver left us at the… porch? And then drove away. I wouldn’t know how to describe this magnificent piece of architecture. A Barroque façade stood in front of us with its inmense visual plasticity. A bald man in a tailcoat who presented himself as Bertrand, a service worker, lead us on to the ballroom.

I cannot emphasize enough the amazement I felt when I contemplated this whole masterpiece: Murano glass lamps, red marble skirting boards, agate panels, large mirrors (although they were all covered), a mysterious clock that presides over the room… The paintings on the vault represented godly dances, antique rituals that I didn’t even acknowledge. Classical music filled my ears, was this Prokofiev’s Nº13 Dance of the Knights?

Iñigo finally broke the silence between us. 

“I do not have words for this” he said.

“Me neither” I replied.

We decided to get a glass of bubbling champagne and pretend we were natural to these type of luxuries. 

The room was full of extremely well dressed people from the highest societal spheres: there were twenty-ish boys and girls between 16 and 22 years old, some of them accompanied by adults: I could recognise some well known faces of bankers, investors and European socialites.

Sitting on the sofa, surrounded by all of these powerful figures, was the famous woman who sent the email to me. She was in her 40's or 50's, grey hair, blue eyes and very beautiful appearance. I couldn’t help but stare at her hypnotic light coloured eyes that seemed to have a magnetic aura attached to them. We will call her Amelia de Rossi. She was wearing a long navy blue dress and navy blue gloves.

A redhead girl who was standing next to us was the first one to approach us. 

“Hey, I'm Carlotta. I'm new here and wanted to make some friends, and you seem nice enough and just as lost as me” she laughed.

Uhm, okay, thank you I guess?

“My dad told me that I should not be nervious at all for the *latria*.  Well, everyone has done it before, so it shouldn't be such a big deal, right?” said Carlotta with a big smile.

My friend and I both looked at each other frowning.

“What do you mean?” I asked her with curiosity.

She looked at me with confussion. And then looked at Iñigo. She then made an expression as if she had just realised something in her mind. 

“Oh, I didn't know you two were already engaged… Sorry, didn’t mean to bother you” she said.

Carlotta then turned around and walked to the opposite side of the room to get a wine glass served onto her glass.

Iñigo and I started laughing uncontrollably. I don't think we look like fiancées at all. 

“I don't want to lie to you, I feel like a little sheep in a house full of much bigger and stronger wolves” Iñigo finally said.

“What in the world is a *latria*?” I told him.

“I really wish we wouldn't, but I think we're going to find out soon” he laughed off "probably some Illuminati bullshit".

"Oh, fuck off" I replied rolling my eyes.

Then, Amelia stood up, and the server who was standing next to her started shaking a small ringing bell. The room became silent as everyone turned their attention onto her, looking like she was about to make an announcement.

“I am incredibly grateful for reuniting all of us here once again and being the director and manager of this year's edition once again, where you, daughters and sons, will find your lovable and prosperous futures and secure them forever” she started.

Everyone started clapping and Iñigo and I looked at each other once again. 

“Is this a Hunger Games fucking promo?” he whispered to me.

Amelia continued: “I would like all of the young aspirants to come to the center of the room and stand up”. 

All of the teenagers that I mentioned earlier, including Carlotta, did as told, surrounding Amelia, who stood located in the middle of it. 

"What the fuck?" I murmured.

"All of you, young participants, will be witnessing how loneliness turns into union; how silver turns into gold; how fortune turns into... more fortune" she announced.

I felt so much confussion and fear that I wanted to vomit. And it wasn't because of the overly sugar-coated discourse or the weird way in which all of the participants were trying not to look at her directly in her eyes.

It was because she took her right glove off, as her hand seemed to be itching very badly.

And, I shit you not,

She didn't have regular skin like a normal person,

Her hand was covered in *feathers.*

I was suddenly and misfortunately reminded of my late great-uncle's second last name: Rossi.
