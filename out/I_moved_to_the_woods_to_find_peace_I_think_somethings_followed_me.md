I moved here to get away.

Not from anything dramatic—just the noise, the deadlines, the constant press of bodies on the subway. I’d been saving for years, watching Zillow like it was a stock ticker, waiting for the right spot to open up somewhere far enough from town to finally feel quiet.

The house was modest. Two bedrooms, a weather-worn porch, surrounded by thick pine woods on all sides. The kind of place where the only traffic is deer trails and the loudest thing at night is the wind through the branches.

It was perfect.

At least, it was at first.

The first night, I barely slept—not from fear or anything, just that weird new-house feeling. Every board creak felt suspicious. Every thump in the walls had my attention. But it wasn’t anything I could put my finger on. No animal sounds. No wind. Just… stillness. Too much of it.

The kind that presses on your eardrums.

By the third night, I started hearing it.

At first, it was faint. Just my name, whispered from somewhere out in the trees. So quiet I thought it was in my head. Just—
“Chris…”

That’s my name. No one knew I’d moved. I hadn’t even updated my address yet.

I turned on the porch light. Nothing but fog and pine needles.

The next night, the whisper came again. Closer. Same voice. Like someone standing just beyond the tree line. I grabbed a flashlight and scanned the woods. The beam cut through fog and brambles, casting long shadows. I thought I saw movement—something ducking behind a tree—but I wasn’t sure.

I called out. “Who’s there?”

No response. Just silence, and then—again, softer—

“Chris…”

It wasn’t until I replayed the voice in my head that something felt wrong. It didn’t sound quite… human. It was my name, yeah. But the tone—like someone trying to sound friendly and failing. Like something mimicking friendliness without ever understanding what it really meant.

The following morning, I found footprints outside the window.

Bare feet. Long. Too long. And the toes were wrong—almost clawed, like they were pulled forward instead of splayed out.

I told myself it was just some animal. Probably a bear. Maybe a cougar. Something that wandered up close.

But I didn’t sleep that night.

Around 3 a.m., I heard the porch boards creak.

Then scratching on the siding. Slow. Deliberate. Like claws being dragged across the wood.

I didn’t move. Just lay there in bed, holding my breath, praying it would pass.

It did—but only after I heard it again.

“Chris. Come outside.”

That’s when I knew it wasn’t in my head.

I spent the next day locking everything down.

Every window got a plank of wood nailed across it. Not just for privacy, but because I couldn’t shake the feeling that whatever was out there wanted me to see it. To acknowledge it. To let it in.

I even boarded up the small bathroom window. The only one that faced the back woods directly. It always felt colder near that window, like the glass itself was holding something back.

By the time the sun dipped behind the ridge, the house looked like a bunker.

And I felt like a prisoner.

That night, I didn’t go to bed.

I made coffee—strong, black, burnt—and sat in the living room with a notebook in my lap and the hammer still in my hand. Not a gun. Just a hammer. I told myself that if I saw it, really saw it, I’d know what to do.

I just didn’t know if I’d survive knowing.

It came around 2:14 a.m.

I heard the crunch of pine needles first. Then the boards groaned on the front porch.

Then silence.

That same thick silence that presses in around your ears until your own heartbeat sounds too loud.

And then it spoke again.

But not from the woods.

From inside the walls.

“Chris. You locked me out.”

I stood up so fast the chair fell backward. The hammer felt like it weighed fifty pounds in my hand. I pressed my back to the wall and just listened.

No footsteps. No creaking. No sound of forced entry.

Just the voice—low, stretched like a rubber band pulled too tight.

“You looked at me. I know you saw me.”

That’s when it scraped the walls again. Not outside.

Inside.

Something long and sharp dragging across drywall, slow and wet, like it wasn’t just clawing—it was tasting the house.

I turned toward the sound and whispered, “What do you want?”

It didn’t answer. Not right away.

Instead, the hallway light—one of the only ones I hadn’t turned off—flickered. Once. Twice. Then died.

And something stepped into view at the end of the hall.

It looked like me.

Same shirt. Same jeans. Same tired eyes.

But its smile was wrong. Too wide. Too still. Its teeth were too clean, like they’d never been used to eat. And its fingers were too long, like they’d forgotten how to stop growing.

It tilted its head—and in my voice, it said,
“Let me back in, Chris. You brought me here.”

I ran.

Not outside. Just to the nearest room with a door I could lock—the laundry room.

I’ve been in here for almost an hour, scribbling all this into a notebook by flashlight. The thing hasn’t moved. I can hear it breathing just outside the door. Slow. Wet. Eager.

And I think it’s getting in soon.

Because it’s not saying my name anymore.

It’s saying something else now.
