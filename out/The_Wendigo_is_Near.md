This is a story which happened to me and my friend a few years back. I work in a national park as a park ranger. When my life was relatively normal, I had just landed a job at a national park, life was good as I was working with my buddy Rob.

  The second day was… Strange. We found bear traps on the ground, we never put them there. Other than that, another day in paradise, but throughout the night, I swear I heard a loud screech coming from the woods near my watch tower, I looked and saw nothing. I just shrugged it off after a little while.

   As of lately we have been finding small animal corpses around the woods, this is normal since we have bears all over, it’s just that these marks were too big to belong to a bear. What's even weirder is we found a tooth inside of a bloody deer, this tooth was too huge and sharp to belong to a bear, I think we have a new animal in these woods.

  Today we found a bear, hanging from a tree and gutted, I nearly threw up. No animal in the park could do this. Boss told us from now on to stay at the watchtowers. I kept being reassured that everything would be fine, but at this point I just couldn’t be too sure anymore.

  Lately the screeches have been more frequent, I’m having trouble focusing. When I was younger, I was told of a creature that fed off people and animals, it could also mimic voices. It was called a Wendigo, of course I don’t believe in that paranormal crap but, something was taking out animals throughout the park.

 I swear I heard Rob call me from outside of my watchtower. He yelled “Hey Trent you have got to come see this!” I nearly left, but I just felt that his voice was off, nearly distorted. I looked out of my watch tower, to see Rob, his insides dangling in the breeze. My boss ruled this out as an accident, that still didn’t stop the police from questioning me, I know I heard his voice!

  I saw something in the woods. Let me explain. This creature I saw had huge antlers, an animal skull as a mask and it was over 11 feet tall! The night began normally, until the screeches began again! I looked down, only to see this creature, eating my boss's lifeless body. I got a good look at it before it ran off and out of sight.

  The police have been very suspicious of me lately, how could they not be? Both of the people I worked with are dead. I tried to explain what I saw to the police, of course nobody believed me. It all led to me being terminated.

 I’ve decided I’m not going to let this creature ruin my life. I have done research on this "Wendigo". I plan to break into the park tonight. I will end this, I must,

   I’m in the park, I hear the screeches and I am following them. I hear the voices of my boss and Rob. They are telling me that they are ok and I should come meet them by my watchtower. I know from my research that the Wendigo creature is really good at tricking people.

I just kept wandering around the park. I was wondering, until I heard my mothers voice, she died when I was six. My instincts told me no, but I had missed her so much. “Don’t worry mom, I’m coming!”
