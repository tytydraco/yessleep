My dog was the sweetest dog you would have ever met. Every day after work when I walked through the door he would lick my hands and give me a toy so we could play fetch. I got him a year ago on the account of me not able to find a person to love me resorting to animals to give affection. His dark colored fur and white colored paws stood out to me. He was a very large  sized dog and had a calm temperament that made him very lovable. When I was choosing a dog I knew he was the one. I named him after my now deceased dad Alan. I thought I could handle him but I also thought he was a dog.


This all started two weeks ago when I got home from my job as a manager at a retail store. I was just pulling onto my street when I saw Alan sprinting down the road. I assumed my dog sitter accidentally left a gate unlocked or left the front door slightly ajar. I jumped out of my car leaving it in the middle of the street running after Alan. I caught him a few minutes later when I cornered him in someone’s fenced in backyard. When I got home I noticed there were some cuts on his belly and a little bit of string poking through looking like it was sewn. I thought he must have cut it while he was running although I didn’t see anything poking out while chasing him I just blamed it on not looking enough. Later that night there were police lights outside. Apparently someone had been killed and had his guts laid everywhere. I ignored it thinking it wouldn’t affect me. God I was so wrong.


I turned on the news and it talked about someone who escaped from prison and how increased amounts of people were being drugged. I quickly got bored and went to bed. Strangely Alan didn’t cuddle with me but I paid no mind to it chalking it up to him wanting to try out the new dog bed I got him. This happened for a few more days where Alan would get out and I would chase him and he would act more out of character. One day he growled at me which was already weird when I got near his belly but it also didn’t sound like a dog growl. It sounded human. That same day when I was petting him I looked into his eyes and they looked human as well. After the third day I invested in a tracker in case he got out and I couldn’t find him and also just see where he went. I also asked the dog sitter if they forgot to lock anything. They said no obviously and I asked them to double check next time. On Thursday I once again found myself chasing Alan. I caught him once again and decided to check his tracker. It seems like he left the house at around midday and went to the neighbors house. That made me happy and a little nervous at the same time. Happy because he didn’t leave the neighborhood. It made me nervous because the sitter didn’t come till 1:00 so now the way he gets out is unknown. Later that night the same neighbor he visited was found dead. Weird. I invested in taller fences just in case but for a whole week he kept getting out while murders on my street kept happening. I would have stayed at my moms but she had other family staying over. I decided to move across town but the night before I moved (last night) everything unraveled.

I had the whole thing set. I would take off work and have the moving guys move in the morning since I myself was on the weaker side for a guy. I went to sleep after feeding Alan when I awoke at around 2:00AM to the sound of creaking floor boards. I thought it was the murderer and I’d be damned if I was gonna die the night before moving. I peaked outside my door when something I could never have fathomed was possible happened. A man was stepping out of my dog like taking off a Halloween costume. He looked to only be around 5’0 and skinny. Suddenly it all made sense. The cuts, Alan’s weird behavior, and the string of murders. This guy was practically hiding out in my dog when I suddenly had a realization. No dog could live through that. This guy didn’t live in my dog. He pretended he was him. I was very quickly come over with a sense of rage over the death of my dog and the man in front of me who caused it. I charged at him bare handed at 5’6 and pinned him to the ground. I beat him way more times then required to incapacitate but a little less times then I should have. I called the police and he was very quickly arrested. I’m still mourning over the loss of my dog but you may be wondering why I’m typing this. It’s a warning. If someone you love is acting weird check up on them. They could not be who you think they are.
