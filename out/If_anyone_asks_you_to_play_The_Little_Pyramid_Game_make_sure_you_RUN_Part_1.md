What would you do to achieve the life of your dreams?

Probably more than you’d care to admit.

You may be tempted to have your wishes granted by a mysterious game, should you come across it—or should *it* come across you. And you may come to find, as I did, that temptation can do a lot worse than kill you.

The story of my ill-fated journey is long, and short, and neither. That will only make sense to you once you have finished reading every last post, and there will be many, so only proceed if you have the stomach for it. If you don’t, then simply do as I say before you leave:

If anyone asks you to play *The Little Pyramid Game*, don't answer.

RUN.

Life as I knew it ended during the summer of 2010, whilst I was honeymooning in Egypt with my wife, Nadine. Gazing at the horizon from the balcony of our hotel in Giza, we saw the pyramids jutting upwards like lower teeth—the sandy gum of the desert proudly brandished those brown fangs against the sky’s blue jaws above. I think anyone who has visited those monoliths knows that there is a raw, hidden power to them. Secrets lie beneath the desert.

And I know what must be its most terrifying one.

Nadine and I were twenty-nine at the time, desperate for a little fun before settling down and starting a family. Uncharacteristically, given our introverted natures, we put ourselves out there by making friends with a few other hotel guests. We made five friends over the course of the next two weeks. They would become five of the most important people in my life: Brenda, Gordon, Sigvard, Freja, and Dominga.

Late one night, the seven of us talked and drank by the pool, and we wound up playing *The Game of Life*—that classic board game in which players move around a board, travelling through each of life’s stages. In retrospect, I think that might have been the greatest evening of my life.

Perhaps due to it being our last night on Earth.

“I’ll have a Heineken,” Freja asked one of the waiters.

Sigvard scoffed audibly, which drew a laugh from the rest of us. The recently divorced man was enjoying a holiday with his daughter before she, as he put it, “ran off” to university.

“I’m eighteen now, Pappa,” Freja pointed out with an eye roll.

“Ah, to be eighteen again,” Dominga lamented, spinning the number wheel in the centre of the game board; the other adults at the table laughed at the twenty-year-old. “What? University has aged me! Freja will find that out for herself in September.”

The Swedish girl gulped. “I’m so nervous.”

“Don’t be,” Dominga replied, pushing her plastic car across the game squares. “It’s an amazing experience.”

“Then why did you run away from it?” asked Freja, not in a prodding manner, but with kind-natured concern.

Dominga motioned for Nadine to take her turn. “I just thought it would be wise to take, as the English say, ‘a gap year’. Reading about the world made me want to see it for myself, you know?”

A lovely, short American named Brenda laughed heartily at the girls’ exchange. “You’re both still babies! Golly, I’d love to be young—travelling the world, or heading to college. Gordon and I never got to do any of that, did we?”

Her husband, a grey-haired and stout man, shook his head, then pointed at the game board below us. “It’d be nice if life were this easy, right? Get handed a job on a plate. Get the kids you want, even if you ain’t got the—”

“— *Gordon*,” Brenda suddenly interjected, eyes welling a little as she squeezed his leg; she paused for a moment, then whispered. “We tried to have a kid, ‘bout twenty years ago. That ship’s sailed now, but God gave us a pretty good lot in life, so I ain’t complaining. And Gordon ain’t complaining either, when you catch him in a better temperament.”

“I ain’t got more than one temperament,” the man grouchily admitted, making her chuckle.

“I just need a quick toilet break,” Brenda said as she got out of her chair. “I’ll only be a *jiffy*, as you Brits like to say.”

Gordon chuckled, shaking his head as his wife sauntered away. “Lord, I love that woman.”

Then he leant against the table with folded arms and took a side glance at the waiting staff clearing away tables. When I looked the same way, I noted a woman in denim dungarees watching us. That in itself wouldn’t have been cause for concern, but my heart dropped, all the same, as I glimpsed something wrong—something that stung my head and churned my gut.

She’d already stepped backwards into the shadows, slipping out of sight, by the time I realised what had unsettled me so greatly, but I told myself I must’ve been seeing things. Still, I was certain that I’d seen eyes on her face which were far too large, misshapen, and off-coloured—a sort of luminous green shining momentarily in the shade, before she was gone.

I think about her a lot now. Think about lots of things. Things that make no sense, as we hadn’t even started playing *The Little Pyramid Game* at this point. But that time was absolutely upon us.

Gordon pulled my attention back to the table. “I was being a grump before, but life ain’t too bad. In fact, we *all* ought to be grateful. At least we ain’t slaving away like those chumps over there.”

Awkward silence returned to the table, and I immediately raised a hand for the American to stop—or, at the very least, quieten down. “Gordon, that’s—”

“— What are we playing?”

I was interrupted by that question, asked in a bouncy, engaging tone.

Then followed the slump of a behind hitting plastic, and heads snapped in shock towards Brenda’s seat, finding it occupied by a member of staff who had seemingly emerged from nowhere. The sweaty worker unbuttoned his white polo shirt, whilst the rest of us exchanged barely veiled smirks.

Dominga eventually answered, “This is *The Game of Life*.”

The hotel employee nodded, then continued speaking in impeccable English. “Yes, I think I’ve seen it before. You get a career and a family, then you die, correct?”

“*Retire*,” Sigvard corrected with a giggle. “But otherwise, yes; it’s just like real life.”

“Ah, but real life is a disappointment,” continued the slouching staff member. “As is this make-believe game. If reality could provide such an easy route to happiness and riches, I certainly wouldn’t be *‘slaving away’* as a hotel waiter.”

The employee parroted Gordon’s insulting comment, making it abundantly clear that he had overheard the oafish guest. The rest of us sat upright, and I saw mouths open and close, like ventriloquist’s dummies, as we searched for words.

“We’re really sorry, sir,” Dominga apologised in a mouse-like voice.

“*Sir?*” the worker repeated with a laugh. “Please. This humble worker tends to go by Bomani.”

“All right, pal,” Gordon sighed. “You’ve made your point. I’m sorry for offending you. Is that what you wanna hear?”

Bomani raised a hand. “I am not, and was not, offended. Though I must admit that, yes, I was eavesdropping on your conversation. I was fascinated to hear the seven of you discuss your hopes and dreams about life.

“I’m not here to, as Americans might say, ‘bust your chops’. In fact, I thought you might be interested in learning about a similar ‘game of life’ from ancient Egypt. What do you say?”

Gordon shrugged, clearly open to making amends, and the rest of us nodded with uncomfortable smiles on our faces.

Bomani nodded. “Firstly, you all seem to be educated people, so I’m sure you know that the Pharaohs, in particular, were eager to attain the perfect life—eager for the *eternal* life, which is why so many opted for mummification.

“However, there were those who did not share the polytheistic religious beliefs held by many in ancient Egypt. They wanted the perfect life too, but they didn’t want to rely on Gods to achieve it—so they *became* Gods.”

Gordon huffed. “Better not let my Brenda hear you talking like that, pal. She ain’t too keen on blasphemy.”

Bomani shook his head. “I am not blaspheming. I’m simply telling you *why* these elites made their own private game of life. Why they developed a sacred ritual that would give them the power to shape their own lives. Let’s call them the Creators.

“Now, this game’s was so prestigious that the Creators did not even share knowledge of it with the Pharaohs. Certainly not with scholars. There are few left on Earth who know about the game, and its rules, as I do. Even its name has been lost to the sands of time.

“All that truly remains of it, in any tangible sense, is *this*.”

Bomani then ceremoniously plucked an object from the pocket of his trousers, and held it up on his palm against the night sky.

It was a white pyramid, barely an inch in width and height. That handcrafted piece of what appeared to be polished stone was so small that it sat in the pit of his palm with room to spare. Still, Bomani made it seem far larger, in terms of our perspectives, by framing the minuscule thing amongst the three true pyramids on the horizon.

On the teensy polyhedron’s sides were images, but I didn’t manage to inspect them before the employee balled up the object and rolled it across the table towards Dominga.

“Neat,” the girl said, picking the pyramid up. “Is it a die?”

Bomani nodded. “I suppose so. This little pyramid *is* the game. The tool that offers a player absolute control over all facets of life. Offers wealth, happiness, or whatever else one desires.”

“Sounds like a pyramid scheme,” Sigvard joked, earning a groan from his daughter.

“The game is simple,” the hotel worker continued. “You make wishes with the intent of bettering your life. With each wish, you progress to the next stage of life. I suppose, in a way, you step to the next ‘game square’ on the board.

“However, each life is a finite cycle. After five wishes, you reach the end.”

Bomani paused at this point, then spoke pointedly, as if wanting his next words to be heard more clearly than any others. “Some Creators did find ways beyond the limits of the game. The end of life does not need to be the end of the game. But let’s not overcomplicate things, eh?

“In a basic sense, the game is played in a sacred chamber, and it involves only four moves:

“Firstly, you make a *feasible* wish that purely betters the life of you or other players in your group.

“Secondly, you roll the little pyramid—the die.

“Thirdly, you choose from one of its three visible faces.

“Fourthly, and finally, you walk through the triangular doorway.”

“The triangular doorway?” Dominga queried.

Bomani waved her off. “Let’s talk about the die’s four symbols, one per face: the sickle, the cross, the eye, and the sun. Each symbol will guarantee varying levels of success, regarding your wish, so you must trust your instinct. Your mind, heart, and soul combined will provide the answer you need.”

The French student, who seemed the most fascinated out of anyone, said, “You mentioned that the player chooses from the little pyramid’s three visible faces, but what about the fourth face—the one facing downwards, I presume?”

Bomani grinned, immensely pleased by her question. “You pick the fourth and final side if you wish to gamble. The hidden symbol promises the most rewarding result, but it is the only side which offers no guarantees. If you choose it, your wish may or may not be granted. The fourth symbol is chosen by chancers.”

Then the waiter looked up for a second, as if wanting to meet someone’s eyes but not quite having the strength to do so, before saying, “Or it is chosen by those with no other options.”

“Personally, I prefer fun games,” Gordon said gruffly. “Y’know, ones involving more than making a wish and hoping it comes true. But, hey, I’m sure this little pyramid game is a lot of fun for horoscope readers and magical thinkers, Bomani.”

“*Magic* is only that which we do not understand,” the Egyptian retorted in a slight hiss, before abruptly shooting out of the chair. “I must get back to work, but if you people are serious about this game—”

“We’re serious!” Dominga interjected eagerly on everyone’s behalf. “Right?”

Gordon shrugged, but did not refuse. And I found, though at the time I blamed it on drinking too much wine, that my head was nodding, despite my mind screaming at me not to accept Bomani's offer. It was an involuntary nod. I know that now.

“Very well,” Bomani said as he towered over us. “Meet me outside the hotel entrance at six o’clock tomorrow morning, and I shall take you to the sacred chamber by the Great Pyramids. I will, by then, having playing pyramids for each of you—including your wife, my American friend.”

Bomani started to walk away, but quickly stopped in his tracks. Then he looked over his shoulder and offered one final piece of wisdom.

“I must add that, once starting this game, there will be no going back to your old life,” he said.

\*\*\*

The next morning, as Bomani taxied our group to the Great Pyramids, he seemed a little disgruntled that we were simply marvelling at the mighty monuments to one side. And when we all clambered out of his large, white van, chattering excitably among ourselves, the hotel employee reminded us of the fantastic game we were all about to play.

We were sober. That was part of it. Of course seeing the big pyramids intrigued us more than seeing little ones.

As Bomani led us towards the Pyramid of Khufu, the greatest of the three, we shared our awe with one another in hushed whispers. That tower of dressed limestone, lit by rays of sun, still bore such a distinct and recognisable shape, even after centuries of being pilfered by opportunists. And by playing Bomani’s game, we were pilfering from ancient Egyptians too.

That was a lesson to come.

The waiter took us off the beaten path and around the edge of the Great Pyramid. He checked half a dozen times to ensure that there were no prying eyes upon us, then produced seven of those small, white pyramids from his pocket and handed one to each member of the group. I started to run my thumb over the grooves of its four indented symbols, but Bomani snapped his fingers to draw my attention.

“Keep a firm hold of your die,” he instructed me, then cast his eyes to the others. “Do so, and you’ll be *safe*.”

That was an odd thing to say.

Then the man knelt, plucked an eighth little pyramid from his pocket, and began to twist the white die a quarter-inch into the sand. I opened my mouth to ask something, which I’ve long forgotten, but there instead came a scream from my very core.

A half-moment later, I realised we were *falling*.

Seven horrified screams, mine among them, travelled up into the sunny sky above, which pulled rapidly away from us. Our group was plummeting into a mammoth sinkhole of sand, which drove below the surface of the desert. And my screaming only loudened as I realised the hole above us was beginning to close, sealing us away from the Earth’s surface.

In the darkness, I flailed my hands around me, failingly searching for Nadine within the sandy waterfall carrying us near-vertically downwards. I felt leather fabric slip away from me, along with the rubbery sole of a shoe; fortunately, Nadine’s shriek assured me that I wasn’t feeling her drowning, lifeless body beneath me.

As we cascaded down the black, I expected to die—expected the plummet to be brief, and our torment to be short-lived.

I know now that this would’ve been the lesser nightmare.

An underlayer of sand cushioned our falls, and the screams finally let up, descending into many stuttering sobs.

“Pappa…?” groaned Freja into the dark; her voice sounded intimate, ricocheting off the walls of an enclosed space.

“*FREJA!*” Sigvard yelled back, before crying something else in Swedish.

I took out my phone and turned on the torch, illuminating a square chamber of limestone. It was perhaps fifty by fifty metres and bedded with a hefty blanket of sand in which the eight of us were lying. I shuffled over to Nadine, who was firing her gaze in all directions with teary eyes, finally landing upon me; her eyes softened, as did her breathing.

Bomani climbed to his feet, activated a torch of his own, then took deep strides towards the chamber’s exit—a square archway that led onto a long tunnel, its walls decorated with shadows and a curving convoy of skittering roaches, like black bunting.

“Onwards,” the waiter said nonchalantly, as if we’d simply walked down a set of stairs, not tumbled an untold distance into the desert itself—could’ve been ten metres or a hundred. “We all made it down safely, as promised, didn’t we?”

“*AIN’T A DAMN THING ‘SAFE’ ABOUT THIS GAME OF YOURS!*” Gordon roared as he lumbered forwards, but Brenda grasped his arm, pulling him back into the sand.

“Honey, we need him… He’s the only one who knows the way out of here,” his wife whispered, before shouting, “Bomani, you’ve had your fun, and now we wanna go back to the surface.”

“You’re not in any danger,” Bomani continued calmly, shaking the sand off his shoes and pointing at the logo on his white polo shirt. “I work for the hotel, okay? I’m not a stranger.”

But he very much *was*, I realised, a stranger. We’d let our guards down, foolishly following a walking, talking, polo-shirted horror into the desert. And nobody knew we were down there.

We had no better option than to climb down the sandy slope. Nadine clung to my side, gazing at the sand-filled room we were leaving behind.

“You okay?” I asked her.

She nodded at the ceiling as we neared the exit. “We fell through a hole. *Where is it?*”

I looked behind me, seeing a little of my torch’s glow reveal the ceiling above, then I moved the torch around to cast it across every inch of the ceiling. My chest tightened as I realised what Nadine meant. We had undoubtedly fallen through the ceiling, yet there was no hole. And I’d heard no mechanism close above us. Any rational explanation escaped me.

*But there has to be one*, I decided.

“Probably some hidden mechanism,” I whispered to my girlfriend as we followed Bomani into a long, dark tunnel of limestone and granite, like the Great Pyramids above. “This is part of his game.”

“Listen, Bomani,” Gordon yelled from ahead. “I pissed you off last night, and I said I was sorry about that, didn’t I? You ain’t gonna get away with trying to kill us down here.”

“That isn’t what I’m trying to do,” the hotel worker whispered ominously, nodding ahead at the torch light revealing a room beyond the tunnel’s end. “This is the way out.

We entered a small, stone-walled chamber with a rectangular, three-feet-tall box made of lead or ancient wood—from the bronze colouring, it was hard to tell. Its heavy lid sat an inch or so askew, but Bomani hurriedly heaved it back into place; it was a movement so quick, nearly imperceptible, that I realised he hadn’t wanted anyone to notice—and that left me with a fearful ache in my skull.

At the end of the stone chamber was a triangular opening, six feet both high and wide, leading into blackness.

“Are there stairs through there?” Sigvard asked as the eight of us gathered in the room around the bronze box.

The Egyptian worker smiled, ignoring the question. “The game must always be played in here: the sacred chamber.”

“*WE DON’T WANNA PLAY YOUR FUCKING GAME!*” Gordon yelled, beetroot face dripping sweat and drawing a frightened look from Brenda. “Answer Sigvard’s question: will we find stairs leading back to the surface if we go through that doorway?”

Bomani shook his head, smile transforming into a frown. “The only way out is to play the game. Make an internal wish, roll the white pyramid across the bronze box, then choose the symbol you think will best fulfil your needs.”

“I’ve had just about enough of you too,” Sigvard said, balling his fists.

“Let’s just do it,” Freja said, attempting to calm her father. “He’ll let us out if we play. I’m sure of it.”

The gathering in that chamber was a powder keg. Neither Gordon nor Sigvard seemed convinced by Freja’s reasoning. I had a horrible feeling that someone would pummel Bomani to a pulp, given too many more moments of contemplation, so I clutched my die tightly in my right palm and closed my eyes.

*I want to write fiction full-time*, I wished internally, then corrected myself. *No, I want to be the most successful writer on the planet.*

And then I rolled my neat, polished, miniature pyramid across the mouldy table at the heart of the room. In turn, all voices were silenced, and every set of eyes was drawn towards the rolling die. It landed with the sickle facing downwards, which left three safe options, as I didn’t plan on taking a gamble.

The cross, the eye, or the sun.

Nadine smiled at me, encouragingly nodding her head for me to make a decision; I sensed that she believed Freja’s hypothesis about appeasing Bomani. Something about the sun spoke to me—it suggested the dawn of a new day. No more toiling away at the law firm. It was time to realise my dream as a successful writer.

*The game isn’t real, Asher*, I chided myself.

“I’ve chosen,” I told Bomani as I picked up my white pyramid and returned it to my pocket. “What do I do now?”

The man pointed his free hand at the triangular doorway of darkness. “Now, you head this way.”

I looked back at Nadine, not wanting to leave her alone, but she nodded at me eagerly. We’d been together for ten years, and you learn to read a person’s thoughts in their eyes and lips after that long together. She looked at me as if to say that I should run and seek help, and I knew that was the best option our group had; I certainly preferred that idea to my wife going off alone.

“Just wait a second,” Gordon said, holding up a hand to halt me, then he turned to Bomani. “Is Asher gonna be ‘safe’, as you like to say, once he walks through that doorway too?”

Meanwhile, Freja was nervously eyeing the tunnel behind us, and the hotel employee seemed to be paying attention to her, rather than the incensed American.

“What do you see?” Bomani asked in a low whisper.

“I don’t know,” the Swedish girl whimpered, closing her eyes and jiggling the die in her palms, “but I’m not waiting to find out.”

“Hey!” Gordon interrupted angrily. “Don’t ignore me. I’m talking to you, *Bomani*.”

The waiter smiled in response. “You ought to listen to the girl, *American*.”

Then the Egyptian hotel worker raised a finger to his lips, and in the silence that followed, there came a slight sound: the knocking of rubble against the stony floor of the tunnel. And though it could’ve been anything, from skittering rodents to foundations settling, it wasn’t anything. I knew what was coming, somehow. It was almost a relief, but mostly a nightmare, when the following sounds finally came.

Reverberating footsteps from deep within the tunnel.

“What is that?” Dominga croaked.

“*You don’t want to find out*,” Bomani whispered lowly, setting my hairs on end as he aimed his torch firmly at the tunnel behind us. “*Roll your dice*.”

As several little pyramids suddenly clattered against the bronze box, all at once, I kept my eyes on the tunnel behind, listening to quickening slaps against stone. And then shapes began to tickle the farthest reaches of the torch beam.

Into the light emerged the bony remains of a figure dressed in rags and blackened strips of bacteria-ridden flesh—an embalmed being, little more than a skeleton, that clearly had not known life for untold time. And the thing was hurtling towards us, eye sockets empty, save for the rage spilling out of them in oozing trickles of brown. If that horror weren’t enough, there was another emotion hidden within its pleading cry which felt familiar to me. And that left me moaning in fear.

A second later, the others had cast their gazes to the tunnel, and there came overlapping screams and roars of revulsion. We had all rolled our dice, of course, so I dashed across the threshold of the triangular archway, leading the way with the other guests hot on my heels.

My boot sole thudded roughly against a hard floor in a small room, and the screams from behind immediately vanished.

When I turned, the sacred chamber was gone.

In the dark was an oakwood door, the sight of which nauseated me—that worst kind of fear, triggered by an otherwise unresponsive body violently rejecting the unnatural danger ahead. But I lunged forwards and found myself running a hand across the wall almost instinctively, finally meeting a light switch and flicking it on.

Next came hot acid at the top of my throat as I finally processed my surroundings.

I had, impossibly, returned to the front hallway of my apartment *back in England*.

Mouth spluttering involuntary, terrified groans of disbelief, I staggered into the lounge. My eyes were fuzzing with brown specks of static, but I held to consciousness, no matter how desperately my body wished to collapse—wished to fall into a deep, unending slumber so as to escape the nightmare.

I peeked through the living room curtains at the skyline of London beyond my window. The light pollution coloured the black sky not with its familiar white glow, but dusty, yellowy brown. There was a sand-stained blanket across existence; the city, as a whole, appeared slightly sepia-hued. Appeared tangible, and so nearly recognisable, but ever so slightly off. And then I accepted the inevitable.

I was staring at a version of Earth, but not ours.

With sweaty palms, I pulled out my phone and rang Nadine, but there came no answer. And as I eyed the device, I noted the red bubble atop the *Mail* app—the white ‘1’ within. I knew it was absurd to waste a moment doing anything other than trying to find Nadine, but something about the notification intoxicated me.

I tapped on the app and read the latest email:

***Subject: Space crew horror story***

*I read your short sci-fi story on Reddit, and I think it would make for an excellent feature film. I was talking to a friend of mine at a sizeable studio, and he’s willing to fund the project.*

*If you’re interested, let me know, and we’ll hop on a call ASAP.*

I’ve removed parts of the message, such as the producer’s name and company, but suffice to say that this email was a life-changing offer. After five years of self-publishing stories on the internet, it seemed terribly convenient, and terribly forced, that the opportunity of a lifetime should present itself to me. Right after the wish I’d made.

Then I sharply refocused my mind on the far more unexplainable horror at hand: that I had stepped through a doorway connecting Egypt to this alternate version of England.

I decided that it had to be a dream, even after pinching myself incessantly and feeling several sharp stings against my flesh. But the denial ended with a thud and a wail from the entryway of my apartment.

I ran out into the well-lit front hallway to find Nadine lying against the hardwood floor. She was gazing down in wide-eyed, abject horror at the wriggling shape in her arms.
