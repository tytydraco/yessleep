My (34f) husband (44 m), Jonathan, and i got married three years ago, we had a normal big wedding, and everything was perfect. We met when we were in college through a mutual friend.

I was obsessed with him, I'd follow him home, watch him, and occasionally sneak into his house. 

Eventually he asked me out on a date and the rest is history. 

Last year he got a new job at spectrum and everything was going well until he met a girl named Alice. Alice was all over my husband, he'd bring her out to the bar with us, family dinners, the whole nine yards.

When i figured out that she had feelings for Jonathan i freaked out. I couldn't lose him. I found out where she lived and followed her home one night. 

Equipped with a gun, and only a gun. I was wearing a mask to hide my face, a black cloak, and gloves. When she was inside her house i opened a window, and climbed through, being as quiet as possible.

Alice had struggled with depression, and we all knew. So the best way for her to die was suicide. I went into her room where she sleeping and i pulled the gun out of the cloaks inner pocket.

With the gun pointed at her forehead i pulled the trigger. *Bang*

She was dead. I moved her arms in a way that the police would think she shot herself, and i put the gun in her hand. After that, i left her house and made my way home.

My husband was already asleep. I took a shower and went to bed.


Last night my husband and i were in the kitchen. He got drunk, and started talking about Alice, how her suicide effected him. 

That's when i stupidly said, "She doesn't matter anymore since i got rid of her." 

He stared at me, his face morphing from sadness to rage. He shouted at me, "You what!?" I stood up and stepped back. My back pressed against the counter.

"She wanted to take you from me!" I shouted back, he got more mad. "I would have turned her down! I don't want anyone else!" He screamed.

That's when it hit me. I did all that because i was insecure, but i couldn't accept that. "Why do you have to be so stupid! So fucking protective, so fucking crazy!!" 

I couldn't take it, everything thing was spinning. I turned around, grabbed a knife from the knife holder, whipped around and stabbed him in the neck.

"You want to see crazy!? I'll show you crazy!!" I shouted as Jonathan gripped his neck, gurgling sounds emitting from his mouth.

I shoved him to the ground and climbed on top of him, stabbing him repeatedly in the chest. "I did it to keep you!! I did it so i wouldn't lose you!!" I shouted. My heart was pounding, i wasn't myself anymore. 

Jonathan stopped moving, his body fell limp and all that was left was his corpse. I sat there, in a daze. "I'm sorry, but you made me do this" i mumbled.

I got up and walked into the bedroom and sat on the bed. Not knowing what to do. I decided to go to bed.

I didn't dream. When i woke up this morning i laid there.

Here i am now. Sitting in the kitchen, my husband's body still on the floor.

A gun Infront of me..

*Bang*
