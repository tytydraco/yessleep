I don’t expect anyone to believe me. Hell, I barely believe it myself most days. But every time I look into a mirror, I remember that house… and that thing in the glass.

This happened about six years ago. I had just moved to upstate New York after a rough breakup. Found this old duplex that was way too cheap to pass up—run-down, but livable. Hardwood floors that creaked like bones, plumbing that screamed when you ran hot water, and a constant draft no matter how tightly I shut the windows. But I was broke, alone, and tired of couch-surfing, so I signed the lease.

The bedroom had this full-length mirror bolted to the closet door. It looked antique—wooden frame, slightly warped glass. I liked the vintage vibe at first. But after a couple of nights, I started noticing small things. When I walked by the mirror, sometimes my reflection didn’t move exactly in sync. It was just a split-second delay, like a lag. Once or twice, I thought I saw something move in the background of the reflection, but nothing was there when I turned around.

I chalked it up to being overtired. I was still adjusting to the new place, new job, and honestly, I was drinking more than I should’ve. But one night… I woke up around 3 a.m. completely freezing. Like, I could see my breath kind of cold. The window was shut, but the room felt like a meat locker. I sat up in bed and instantly looked toward the mirror.

There was someone standing in it.

Not in my room. In the mirror.

It wasn’t me. This person—thing—was tall and thin, with sunken features and eyes that were just black voids. No whites, no pupils. Just black. And it was staring at me. Head slightly tilted, like it was trying to understand what it was looking at.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t even breathe. I just sat there staring back. Eventually, I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight—and just like that, the figure was gone. No one in the room. Mirror back to normal. I told myself it had to be a dream, some vivid nightmare. Maybe sleep paralysis.

The next day I took the mirror off the door and dragged it to the basement. Thought that would be the end of it.

It wasn’t.

A few days later, I noticed a handprint on the bathroom mirror after a shower. Nothing weird, except… it was inside the glass. Not on the surface—no amount of wiping would clean it. It was like it was behind the mirror somehow. The next day, it was back. Same print. Same position.

Then things got worse. I started avoiding mirrors altogether. But one night, brushing my teeth, I saw it again—my reflection was just… wrong. I was frozen, toothbrush in hand, but my reflection turned its head slightly. And then smiled.

A wide, slow, deliberate smile. One I wasn’t making.

I dropped the toothbrush and ran. Didn’t sleep in that house again. I called in sick the next day, rented a truck, and moved out that weekend. Left the mirror, the bed, half my clothes—didn’t care. I just wanted out.

To this day, I cover mirrors when I sleep. I avoid looking at my reflection for too long. Because sometimes, late at night, I swear I still catch a glimpse of something watching me. And every so often… I see that smile again.

And I know I didn’t make it.
