I miss my husband.
I sat crouched on the stairs peering out from behind the wall watching the man having breakfast at our dining room table. The man I married two years ago held a steaming coffee mug up to his lips taking slow short sips. On the other hand, he held a book, flipping a page occasionally. He didn't seem to notice I was there. 

He was just sitting there as if everything had been completely normal. The man gently set down his mug and brought his elbow to the table to rest his head on his hand, now looking away from me. 

The spread of food on the table was now cold. He had been waiting for me to come downstairs for almost 20 minutes. I narrowed my eyes at him and took a deep breath, careful to exhale slowly. I didn't want him to notice me. He lifted his head from his hand and set down the mug leaning back into the chair he shook his head, the layers in his black brown hair swayed side to side before setting back down at the nape of his neck. I stared for a while longer, unable to find any inconsistencies. 

He definitely looked like my husband. Everything about him was right. His choice of coffee and pancakes. The way his eyebrows formed a slight frown as he stared at the book, even down to his stupid hair flip. He always flipped his hair like that. I stretched my legs in front of me and pressed down on the step with my hands. Maybe I was imagining it. I stared down at my legs. I had been known to be suspicious at times. The feeling that something was wrong was not foreign to me. This feeling and the events surrounding it had been a recurring theme in my life for as long as I could remember.

When I was ten I fell from a tree. My brother and I had been playing outside all day and decided to race to the top of an oak tree at the edge of our property. My brother being older had gotten the lead and I being desperate to catch up decided I would leap from branch to branch. I was about halfway up the tree when I felt my foot slip and suddenly I fell forward almost 12 feet down and landed on my shoulder, my vision went dark. My mom stood over me when I woke up, shaking me lightly. I looked around but I was laying on my living room floor. Apparently, I had taken a nap on the couch and fell. I never climbed a tree, and my brother had been at his friend's house all day. That was my mom's story, but that's not what really happened. 

Similarly, when I was 14 we picked up the family car from the shop. I commented how it was possible that the paint had faded so much making the once-black car appear navy blue. Apparently, it had always been navy blue. Except it hadn’t. 

It wasn’t until the night of my senior prom that I put everything together. At the dance, my then-boyfriend and I had gotten into a fight. I decided to call my parents, my dad picked up the phone groggily having just been dead asleep, and agreed to come get me. 

When I climbed into the car with my father, who had not managed to make it out of his pajamas, he asked if I wanted to talk. I didn’t, so for a long time we drove home in complete silence. I watched the road as the car maneuvered through the winding back roads, the darkness being lit up only by the car's headlights and the occasional dim streetlight. Suddenly what looked like a dog flashed across the street in front of us and dashed into the woods. My dad slammed on the brakes and the car came to a screeching halt. He insisted he had to get out and check if the dog was okay. He got out and walked out of my sight, past the range of the headlights into the pitch blackness in front of us. I waited anxiously, my eyes locked on the area where I last saw him, and after what felt like an eternity a figure emerged and strode quickly to the car. It was a man, this man wore my dad's dress shirt and pants with his lanyard and ID card around his neck. He made his way to the driver's side and got in looking at me. " I guess it ran off, I didn't see it," he said. 

I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up, I wasn't sure how long or loud I screamed before realizing I could not breathe. My throat felt tight and I had to focus to take a deep breath. Throughout this, the man looked at me with a shocked expression holding his hands up trying to calm me, and finally he did. Once the initial shock wore off and I had a moment to compose myself, I realized what this meant. 

At some point in the day, I had made a choice either minor or major that had led me to swap realities. I was now in a dimension almost like my own where the only difference was that my father had worked late. I miss my dad. The real one anyway. I wondered, if I was with a fake dad, then was fake me with my real dad? Had she screamed seeing a man in pajamas climb into the car? Had she put the pieces together the same way I did? I hated this feeling.

It was this very very feeling that had motivated me to tell Alex of my fear of these alternate universes. The places that almost felt right if it weren’t for an unpleasant tinge of unease. I didn't know what caused these universe shifts and I was scared. The differences in these universes were never major. People always had the same jobs, same spouses, and same personalities. 

Usually, it was the placement of their furniture, a different mannerism, or a forgotten memory. A memory that should have been important enough to remain the same. Before we were married, I had explained to him my thoughts and together we established a way to determine whether one of us had shifted universes. 

A password of sorts, a sequence of numbers we would say to be sure we were still in the same place. Every morning sometime while getting ready for work I would call out the numbers to him and he would repeat them back to me. Every single morning, but as you can imagine today was the day our unofficial routine changed. 

When I woke up, he was already out of bed. I thought it was strange but heard him shifting downstairs and moving plates and silverware. I began dressing and fixing my hair in the mirror and called out to him. “Alex, one zero five two”, I paused and waited for his response “What?” Alex called back, except this wasn’t Alex. Alex wouldn't have said what he would have said one zero five two. A chill ran up my spine as my eyes began searching the bedroom. Everything seemed to be in its rightful place so I called the number a second time. The reply that came was a more high-pitched and drawn-out “what?” somehow stretching the word into two syllables. My heart sank into my chest and suddenly I felt very cold. Why was he downstairs anyway? We always made breakfast together. That was when I decided to tip-toe downstairs and look at who was in our kitchen. I’ve been sitting here since. 

My eyes shifted from my legs to my shoes. The black flats I wore to work every day had scrapes and scratches all down the sides. They hadn’t looked like that yesterday? I worked in an office … how would I even get so many scuffs-

“What are you doing?” I jolted backward as a gasp escaped my throat. I wanted to scream and run but I was frozen in place. I stared up at the man before me, unable to breathe, my heart racing in my chest. “What's wrong?” he said looking behind him and then back at me. His expression was somewhere between worried and confused.

“Why didn’t you say it back?” my voice came out shaky. He stared at me for a moment before frowning and lowering his chin. “Eleah?” he said while lowering himself to my eye level, “are you okay?”. 

His eyes scanned my face. “How do I know you're still you?” I said “If you don't say it back?” he tilted his head slightly and his eyes softened. “Is this about your reality shifting again?” he said, his mouth forming a slight smile. I studied his face, his pupils dilating as he stared back at me still smiling awaiting my response. 

This had to be Alex “What else would it be about” I said breaking eye contact. “Come on Eleah, I told you not to worry about that anymore. We are still here together in the same place we've always been.”

He rose slowly to his feet, still facing me “Now come and eat or we’ll both be late.” I forced myself to stand up, keeping my eyes on the floor.

That wasn’t the password, but at least fake Alex wasn't evil.

I could live with that.

I had to anyway.
