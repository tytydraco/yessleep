I didn’t think much of it at first. My mom was, weird. Not the fun kind of weird. The kind that makes you uneasy just by being in the room, like the floor might crack beneath you. When she was on hospice, she’d have her nurse cover every mirror. Every last one. I figured it was just her being difficult. People get strange at the end, right?

I took a couple of weeks off after she passed. I thought I’d clean the house, get it ready to sell, maybe donate some of her things. That’s when I noticed it.

Every mirror. Every shiny surface. Covered. And the canvases. Dozens of them, stacked in corners, leaning against walls, hidden behind furniture. Self-portraits. My mom. In oil, acrylic, charcoal, pastels. Some finished. Some, paused mid-stroke, as if they were waiting for answers.

I tried peeling one cloth back, just a sliver, to see. The instant I did, the air thickened, heavy, sluggish. Her face on the canvas didn’t look like her. Not really. The eyes, they weren’t hers.

I froze.

Not because of what I saw, but because of what it meant. How had she painted herself so many times without a single mirror in the house? And why so many abandoned mid-thought?

She’d always joked about her names. “Depends who I’m feeling today,” she said. Sometimes her middle name, sometimes her maiden, sometimes her first husband’s. I laughed along, but now it gnawed at me. Were these portraits fragments of who she’d been on different days? And if so, how recent? How many had been made in the last weeks, while I thought she was just resting?

I sank into a chair, shaking. Each canvas felt like a whisper. Each unfinished line a question I wasn’t meant to answer. The house wasn’t just a home, it was a record of her mind unraveling, painted layer by layer, secret by secret.

I needed coffee. The smell had always been grounding. But the kitchen had no modern maker, only that ancient percolator from the eighties, the kind with the tiny glass bubble on top.

I filled it, set it on the stove, and waited as the water gurgled. It should have been comforting, but the house felt heavier, like it was holding its breath.

On impulse, I peeled the sheet off the TV. Power on. Volume full blast. And my stomach dropped.

It was not the news.

It was us. My eleventh birthday. The living room. Cake. Balloons. Friends laughing. And her. My mom. But wrong. Movements deliberate, eyes darting where the camera didn’t follow. Too aware. Too present. And me, I remember noticing even then how different she was from other kids’ moms, how she spoke as if expecting me to notice things I shouldn’t.

I stumbled back. The coffee’s smell turned cloying. The percolator gurgled, wrong. Like it was straining to listen.

And the corners of the living room, on the TV, flickered with shadows. Small, fast, mimicking her. Not reflections, not real. Something between the room and the screen.

I ripped the cord. Darkness swallowed the living room. The percolator hissed, spilling a thin trail of coffee across the stove, as if it, too, had been watching.

I backed away, hands fumbling. The canvases loomed, whispering. For the first time, I realized, they weren’t half-finished. They were waiting. Waiting for me to see her, all the fragments she’d hidden.

I had to leave. Every step, every breath, I felt her watching. Not from the TV, not from the canvases, but from somewhere I hadn’t known existed.

I poured cold coffee and texted my wife I’d stay the night. I had to get a jump on cleaning, I told myself.

Morning came. Head pounding, weak, confused. I opened my eyes. The charcoal portrait was different. Finished.

Not completely, rough lines remained, but her face, younger. Decades younger, alive, mischievous.

I thought I’d imagined it. I poured a fresh coffee. Grounding. Then froze.

Charcoal smudges on the mug handle. Light, deliberate, like someone had pressed their fingers there while I wasn’t looking.

I hadn’t touched it. No one else had been here. And yet. There it was. Waiting.
