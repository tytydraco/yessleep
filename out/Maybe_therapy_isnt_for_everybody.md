"It's just that sometimes I feel... not great. Sad, I guess. Yeah, sometimes I feel sad."

I focused intently on my own hands, completely unable to look at Dr Melanie. My nails seemed too long. When did I last cut them? I needed to remember to trim them when I got home tonight. Wait, did I actually have nail scissors or had Alex taken them wh-

"You mourn," Dr Melanie replied though that certainly wasn't the way I'd phrased things, "that's understandable. What do you do when you feel that way? Do you have coping mechanisms such as talking to others or are you less happy with your response to these feelings?"

I laughed quietly and without humour before stopping myself. I didn't want to treat Dr Melanie disrespectfully. Melanie wasn't even her real name, her real name had another couple of letters in it. But I'd misheard her the first time and instead of being annoyed with me for getting it so wrong she'd simply clarified her actual name, an unfamiliar word with a p in it somewhere, and said that calling her Melanie was completely fine. She'd been so patient with the glacial pace I'd taken to even this surface layer of 'opening up.' All in all, she seemed nice, professional and understanding.

"I... no. I don't talk to people. I can't. I want to open up to friends but it seems like either they aren't ones to talk about their feelings or they are but their problems are so much bigger than mine, you know? I have a friend who lost his kid. I can't... So, anyway, I thought maybe I could talk to strangers online but that seems difficult. Not technologically, I can work a computer. It's just awkward. You're the first person I've really talked to."

My eyes flicked up to Dr Melanie, searching her for some sort of emotional response. I think I was looking for judgement. I'd told myself that I was finding myself a therapy session in order to work out how to feel better but I think that was a lie. It was a lie I'd believed, or least sort of believed, but part of me had wanted to see a therapist so that they could assess me, so they could tell me that I was making a big deal out of nothing and it would be objective, professional fact. Instead she was just watching me, patiently waiting for me to go on.

"Oh, the coping mechanism thing. Not really. Kind of. I have one but it isn't good. It isn't bad, it's just... weird."

"Go on." Dr Melanie encouraged.

"I don't live nearby, I live outside of town. And there are some woods nearby and if I walk into them I can keep walking until the closest person is maybe a mile away. Nobody can hear me out there. So I just... scream."

With that I was back to not looking being able to look Dr Melanie in the eye, my gaze burning away at the clock on the wall instead.

"Does it help?"

I was so ready to be ridiculed that it took me a second or two to process the question.

"Oh. Not really. It seems like it should beforehand but then I do it and it seems like it just isn't *enough*. It seems like I need to be able to scream louder or longer than I can or need a whole choir to scream with me or something. It doesn't make sense but it seems like it could help if only I was *more.*"

"You only have one mouth to scream with. More mouths would help."

I laughed again, but it felt a little less constrained than it had earlier.

"Yeah, more mouths would help."

By the time I exited my session I felt a little better but this improvement vanished almost as soon as I entered the waiting room. There was a woman there, pale and shaking with patches of wetness all over her long sleeved top. The woman could not stop crying. She was quiet but her eyes were constantly leaking tears that she dabbed away at with the cuffs of her sleeves.

*See,* I thought to myself, *she has real problems. Not like you.*

I realised that I'd been staring and hurried away out of the door. The drive home was miserable, a familiar pressure building inside me. Once I got home I only went inside for a moment before heading out to the woods. I walked so quickly it was almost a run in parts and listened for a second once I reached my destination. So far nobody had ever been out walking in the area when I'd decided to have a screaming session but every time I was struck with a slight feeling of paranoia.

The next thing I did was crazy, I know that. I'm not a crazy person it just felt right. It felt like it was going to work.

I took the pocket knife out from my jacket and unfolded the blade. I wasn't going to use it to hurt myself, not like that. I just thought that if I used it then it would make me better at screaming. I looked myself over for a suitable location and settled on my left forearm close to the elbow. Not the wrist, that's for self harm and suicides and it wasn't like that. I truly believed that what I was doing was different. I gritted my teeth and let the blade dig itself in.

When I pulled the knife away the result was confusing, to say the least. There was a lot less blood than I would've expected. I hadn't stopped at a shallow depth so I should have expected there to be a lot of blood but instead, I'd had papercuts that bled more.

The weirder thing though, was that I could see something white there. My initial thought was that I'd somehow cut deeply enough to reach a bone but then I saw the gaps and realised I was wrong. Well, partially wrong. Teeth are bones, right?

The wound gaped and then ungaped. *It's a mouth,* I realised, *but it's not quite...*

I ran my finger over the four visible teeth.

*It's not done.*

I let my knife widen the corners of this new mouth, stopping when I reached flesh. It's a ludicrous sentence because *the whole fucking thing* should have been flesh but there you have it. There was a point both ways where the blade would suddenly feel more resistance and pain would shoot from the area as if I was actually being cut and I knew that meant that the mouth was finished.

I just stared at it at first. There were no lips but the teeth looked normal and when it opened slightly I was sure I saw a tongue in there. But I didn't do all of this just to stare at the mouth, I realised. I took a deep breath that I felt in my arm as well as my throat and then I went for it.

Once the screaming had concluded I was shocked how much *better* it felt. Not how much better *I* felt, but the screaming itself felt so much closer to making me feel better today than it had any time previously. I walked back with my hand over my new mouth, worried that somebody would notice it if they somehow passed by. I would need a long sleeved shirt next time, I reasoned. Or perhaps I should pick a different part of myself to open.

The world was a little blurry for a while, as I followed my strange new form of self improvement. I don't think I'm ever going to remember what happened in that period aside from those moments that happened within the woods. I know, from the evidence I've collected since then, that I continued to work from home. I also know that this work was below my usual level, though thankfully not bad enough that it got me fired. There's something else I know about that time too, something I almost never realised at all.

It was a stupid game that first made me suspicious of Dr Melanie. It had had some big update that I didn't have room for on my phone so I went through to see what could be deleted. That's when I found the recordings. I'd always intended to record my sessions with Dr Melanie so I could play them back and write down any advice from them at a future date. It wasn't alarming to see one recording labelled 'Therapy' but what shocked me was that there were *eight* of them.

"That can't be right..." I muttered to myself, but the more I thought about it the more sense it made.

Some of the details of the sessions didn't make sense if there'd been only one. I thought I remembered looking at a clock during my 'only' session but I can also clearly recall entering that same room on my first session and being surprised that the only objects in the room were two chairs -- no clock, no desk, no tissues that I'm sure were there later...

The waiting room had had different people in too. I'd never seen more than one person waiting there but if that was true then how could I so clearly remember different figures? Hell, the more I thought about it the more I remember wondering why they had a waiting room that large when aside from the receptionist I'd only ever seen one person or nobody waiting whenever I'd left.

I opened one of the recordings at random, only avoiding the first one.

*"Do you mourn?" Dr Melanie's voice asked.*

*"I mourn." I'd apparently replied.*

*"When you scream, is it enough?"*

*"No."*

*"It will be soon. You need more mouths."*

That was the complete recording. It seemed like some of the earlier ones were longer but the more recent ones were all under a minute. What the hell? Also, did her comment mean that she knew about the mouths? Was she the one doing this somehow? Her voice had sounded wrong. It was the same voice I remembered but there was too much of it, almost as if there were multiple Dr Melanie's speaking at once.

A helpful alert on my phone informed me that I should leave for therapy in ten minutes, an alert that I had presumably set myself. A quick glance showed that I had also set myself alerts and reminders for the eight previous sessions. Perhaps the most concerning thing was that today's session was labelled 'Last therapy session.'

"Oh, fuck that." I told myself.

Who the hell would go to see Dr Melanie, knowing what I knew?

Unfortunately, wondering who'd be stupid enough to see her was the very thought that made me realise I had to go. I hadn't been the only person seeing Dr Melanie. She might not have many patients but I'd definitely seen others waiting for my session to be over so that they could go and talk about their own problems. Was she doing the same thing to them? If she was, would they be any more likely to remember it than I had been?

My new mouths didn't like to be covered but I switched my shorts and T-shirt for the most loose fitting items I could find that would hide them all. A glance at my watch told me that the time I had spent changing clothes and convincing myself to leave meant I was now running late for my session but it wasn't as if I was actually heading there to receive therapy. I had to protect Dr Melanie's other patients from whatever it was she'd been doing to us. I drove as fast as I could to her office.



\_\_\_\_\_



It was only when I left the car that I made another grim realisation about Dr Melanie's practice: she'd chosen somewhere so out of the way that it would be difficult to get any kind of help out to us quickly if I needed it. Dr Melanie hadn't chosen somewhere as isolated as my woods to set up office but a lot of the buildings nearby had closed their businesses long ago. When I'd first come out here I'd assumed the rent must just have been cheap but I was beginning to suspect the choice of location may have been driven by more sinister motives.

I wasn't even that close by when I began to hear it. It was just an orchestra of agony. There were screams but they didn't have the short panicked bursts of somebody in immediate danger and the closer I got the more I could hear other noises. There was sobbing, wailing, muttering. I don't know what point I'd broken into a sprint but I reached the doors almost breathless. I threw them open and there Dr Melanie was, surrounded by her other patients.

There were so many people. I don't actually know how many patients a therapist would usually see but the waiting room that had always seemed so large and empty was now as crowded as a concert. Every patient that I could see was like me. They didn't all have multiple mouths but all of them had changed in some way. At one point during my struggle to push forwards towards Dr Melanie I saw the crying woman I'd noticed after my first session. Now that she was wearing a sleeveless dress I realised why her top had been so wet when I'd first seen her that day -- her arms were covered in steadily crying eyes. Even through the chaos of the other noises I could hear the gentle noise as each tear hit the floor. I turned away from her and pushed ahead.

  
Dr Melanie was stood on the desk of the receptionist, a woman who was currently slumped silently forwards, her long hair a carpet beneath the therapist's feet.

"You came to me." Dr Melanie said.

Her voice was so soft that I shouldn't have been able to hear it but, like the sounds of the tears from before, it was perfectly clear. I could isolate every sound in the room, in fact. Outside it had been chaotic but now I was in the middle of it all every note of pain and sadness from the other patients was together but seperate in an overwhelming melody.

"Do you mourn?" she asked.

*What did you do to me?* I tried to yell.

"I mourn." came my actual response.

"I think you have enough mouths now."

*What are you?* I tried to ask.

But it was pointless. The pressure inside me had risen to an unbearable level with every step I'd taken and I could feel my new mouths open beneath the fabric of my clothes. I shook my head but I already knew there was nothing else to be done. I breathed in deeply like some sort of flute, air entering my body in impossible ways.

Then I screamed.

When I was younger I used to paint. I wasn't even particularly good but I used to adore that moment where I would add one final detail and be able to see that the work in front of me was now complete. The sound of my screaming was like that. I was the final instrument in her orchestra, my notes the only thing the melody that pressed around me could possibly have been missing.

I thought she'd kill me, now it was complete. That would have made both more and less sense than what actually happened, I suppose. Dr Melanie forced her fingertips into the fabric of her loose dress part way down her abdomen, just below her high belt. When her fingers were in as deeply as they could go she pulled them out to the sides and tore not just the fabric but herself. There was no skin below that dress, no blood when she ripped herself open. All I can remember seeing is a dim glow that got brighter and brighter as the sound was sucked from the room.

It felt like it was the silence that knocked me to the floor but really I suppose it was the effort from all of the screaming. Or maybe it was shock, I don't know. When I sat up I realised I was hardly in the minority and that more of us were lying or sitting than standing.

"Did...  you see where...  she went?" I croaked painfully at the man to my right.

He shook his head 'no' and I pulled myself more upright, then used the desk to help myself stand. There was a man stood behind the desk holding the receptionist's head in his hands. Like me, he had been covered with mouths moments ago. Now the only thing unusual about his appearance was the blood on his arms and it didn't seem like much of that was his.

"Alive?" I asked, my widened eyes on the receptionist's empty ones.

I didn't receive an answer but there was no real need for a reply. Now her head had been lifted I could see the slit across the receptionist's neck just as clearly as the man whose hand currently supported the woman's chin. He pulled away sharpy and her head slammed back to the desk with a clunk. From the other side of the room I heard the door open as someone left. It felt wrong but I couldn't blame them. Some hushed conversations took place and more left. I couldn't take my eyes off the dead woman.

Somebody tapped my shoulder and I turned to see the woman with the eyes. She only had a normal amount of eyes now though. Both her and the man by the desk had small cuts where their more unusual features had more recently been.

"You need to leave," the woman said, "both of you."

I didn't move.

"She's dead and none of us can explain this. Once everyone's gone I'll delete all of your contact details from the laptop and call somebody. I'll say I just came to my appointment and found her like this. They might not believe me but it's the best we've got s- hmm. Fuck. She is not logged in. Well, given that I am not a hacker and the police will definitely be able to get inside that one of you should just take it with you. Probably for the best anyway, a computer at a reception with no client details would look suspicious. No laptop could mean the killer stole it or something. Wait."

Her eyes scanned the room for something and then she ran to grab a blue cardigan that somebody had left on one of the chairs.

"You," she said at the man behind the desk, "use this to get the worst of the blood off you. It won't get it all off so don't touch anything until you're clean or far away. It will have both of your DNA on it so do something smart with it when you get home. Do not burn it unless you usually have regular fires, you're going to want your behaviour to be super normal for the next few days. Normal routine, normal internet history, normal purchases in shops. Thoroughly bleach anything you get her blood on but again, try and make everything look normal. All of this cleaning either needs to be somewhere you know nobody else can see you or be done in such a way that it looks normal. Do you understand all of that?"

The man nodded.

"Great. If you drove, leave now. If you didn't then I'll see if any of the other stragglers drove here because I think that jumper has wiped away all of the blood we can reasonably expect but you still have some on you and so public transport would be ill advised."

He left and the woman turned to me.

"Okay, so if you could just grab the laptop whilst touching everything as little as possible then that would be great. It would be great if it was wiped but since that's out of the question, do not send it to somebody else to be wiped. We wa-"

"I... Can..." I said, my throat protesting at the words.

"You can wipe it? That would be great. Probably not a good idea to sell it afterwards though. Wait, if you can wipe it then can you access it? Do not under any circumstance contact the other patients."

"But!" I protested and my voice finally gave out completely.

I pointed at the door to Dr Melanie's office and then to the exit. It took the woman a moment to understand what I meant but then she sighed.

"We aren't going to find her. Finding a human can be difficult but is possible for trained professionals with resources who don't need to lay low. That thing wasn't human. We know that, right?"

She was right. I pointed at her and gave my best questioning look.

"I don't know what specifically you're asking," she responded, "but I'll do my best. I'm telling you what to do because I think the things I've said are our best chance of most of us getting off unscathed. I'm staying here because somebody has to. I don't know what will happen to me but I'm hopeful that they won't believe I did anything either."

I couldn't tell if she was lying on this last point. Even if she was, there was nothing I could do about it. If I stayed here too then there would just be two of us arrested. I carefully unplugged the laptop and took it home.

  
\_\_\_\_\_



I considered contacting the other patients, despite what I'd been told. In the end though, I decided that the many-eyed woman had been right. Even if somebody in the room that day had seen what direction Dr Melanie had headed when she'd left, that wouldn't be enough to go on. I wiped it and kept hold of it, just as I'd been told to.

At first I thought somebody would come for me but that never happened. For a few months I was focussed on making sure that my life looked normal so that whoever investigated me would have nothing suspicious to find. I didn't miss any work and I met up with my friends when they asked to hang out so that I would look normal. Eventually I accepted that I wasn't a suspect. Cautious research doesn't confirm whether anybody was charged in relation to the receptionist's death but it doesn't seem anybody thinks I'm connected.

I tried to look Dr Melanie up but I couldn't figure much out. The website I'd initially used to request a therapy session, a website that never claimed to be connected to her personally but to connect people in our area with therapists, disappeared when she did. Searching the address of the office doesn't show any businesses being there in recent years, therapists or otherwise. I tried listening to the recordings on my phone to get a better idea of how to spell her surname but they're all wrong now. Every one of them only has my words, with spaces where I know for a fact she was replying to me.

It took months for the shock of it all to wear off and once it did I had a different problem. That old familiar pressure built up inside me again but now the thought of screaming disgusted me and terrified me. I couldn't go out and yell in the woods after the things that yelling had put me through. So, I tried something new. I poured myself a drink, a little whiskey for what's to come. I searched online for a community who might believe what I'd gone through, no matter how strange, and I found one. This community, in fact. I took a longer sip of my drink and stretched my wrists.
