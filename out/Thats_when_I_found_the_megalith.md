About a hundred meters from the shoreline, it stood; erect and stoic, shaded by a human-made canopy of large leaves and an entanglement of vines creating a natural, camouflaged temple.  The monument raised itself fifteen, maybe twenty feet above the brown earth's worn, stomped surface.  But only the gods and those who built the shrine knew how far into the ground it penetrated.

The top was rough and jagged, colored rocky grey with a peculiar shimmer to it, but the bottom eight or so feet was as smooth as marble to the touch and a dark, blackish, brownish red.  Nothing of this earth or any other grew within a ten foot radius of it; most likely a result of frequent foot traffic, from what I could tell.  Everything felt different within the circle.  The aged stone felt ancient and sacred, and the grounds, hallowed and dark.

"You shouldn't be here," a voice gruffly hissed from behind a thicket to the north.
Paradoxically, I jumped and my body froze at the same time, not knowing what to do or where to run.
"I, um, I like this... Monument you've built here," I said in a shaky voice that cracked with every other syllable I spoke.
"You know nothing of what this is or who built it.  Leave quickly and never return.  In time, you'll forget you were ever here and your unconscious brain will thank the gods you did."
I hastily left and made my way back to the beach where I had set down my belongings, but everything was gone.  Dark grey clouds loomed overhead; whether the hair on my arms stood as a result of my recent discovery and the subsequent encounter or from the static in the air was unknown, but I could smell the thunder approaching before I heard it or saw any lightning.

I couldn't sleep at all that evening.  Lightning cracked the sky half a second before thunder shook the walls of the tent.  Water leaked through the fabric, but everything had already been soaked.  I decided to go back to the temple I found earlier, assuming the weather would dissuade any possible visitors besides myself.  The path would be safer to navigate, but I felt it necessary to be more cautious than that.  As my mind debated whether my shoes were sinking into softened earth or thickened rain, the suction beneath my feet gripped my shoe, claiming it as its own. My body weight and momentum plunged my naked toes into the cold, blackened mess.  I couldn't count on the lightning to strike exactly when I needed it, so I left my shoe to sink into the thick, dark muck and kicked the other off, as well.  I made my way through the abysmally dark forest, barefoot, with only the lightning to assist my strained eyes.  I smelled fire as the megalith began to appear.  Encircled by torches, the fire illuminated the dark, glistening figures, highlighting their wet features.  Surrounding the stone, they took turns rubbing their hands in large circles over the monument while chanting in a language that I'm not positive is of this earth.  As they continued rubbing the pillar, it began to glisten in the same way the wet figures did and I immediately understood what caused the bottom half of the stone to be a dark blackish, brownish red.  The chanting grew louder.

Wet leaves and grass whipped my arms and legs as I ran through the forest back to my tent- our tent.  The rain plastered my hair to my face, making it difficult to see, despite the frequency of lightning that illuminated my path and my clothes were cold, soaked weights clinging to my body as I moved through the brush.  When I returned to my- our camp, there was something hanging in the tree.  Trying not to use my lantern, I picked up a stick and cautiously poked it, simultaneously jumping back as I made contact.  Nothing.  I poked it again and investigated closer with my hands.  Strung by their laces, hanging in the tree, were my shoes I lost to the hungry, soft earth while making my way to the megalith.  Someone was watching, following me.  And they wanted me to know that.

I was wide awake until dawn, and aware of every sound around me.  The following morning, I watched as the sun begin heating the inside of the tent and my knuckles were white from clutching my large metal flashlight, ready to use it as a weapon if I had to.

When I eventually emerged from my tent, unsure what may await me on the other side of the flap, the normalcy of it all was startling.  There was no crowd of people waiting to drag me away, no demon summoned from the depths of Hell, or creatures conjured from other dimensions, just my campsite exactly how I had left it, with the exception of my shoes hanging by a branch, which I still found unnerving.  Or at least at first glance.  When I took my shoes down to put them on, I noticed a sigil had been carved into the bark a few inches below the branch.

A voice interrupted my dissociative daze.
"But what does that have to do with my brother?" It said.

That's what I've been trying to explain; I was searching for himâ€¦ That's when I found the megalith.
