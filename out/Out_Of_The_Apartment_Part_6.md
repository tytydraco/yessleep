Things have become complicated recently and that’s saying something considering what we’ve been through up until now. We needed to set out early to avoid Mrs. Sheaver and her goons.  Before we did, we snuck over to Roscoe’s place. His apartment number was on his house key so it wasn’t hard to find. Upon stepping inside, we were greeted by the site of several hunting rifles resting by the couch.





“That checks out,” Van said.





I went to check Roscoe’s room while Drake went into the kitchen.





“He's got some leftover pizza. Wait, no never mind, it's gone bad.”





Over Roscoe's bed hung a painting of Donald Trump. This wasn't surprising. I went to his closet, opened it, and found several sleeping bags and camping packs there. I came back into the living room with them.





“Hey, I think we can use these,” I said, tossing one to Drake and another to Van.





The former caught it and the other fumbled, dropping it. He squatted to pick it up.





“Gus?”



“Yeah?”



“Have you seen the kitchen? Roscoe had a ton of bottled water for some reason.”



“Oh yeah, I think he mentioned one time that he heard water from the sink makes you gay. I can't lie. He was weird.”



“Yeah, so you want to grab some cases?”



“I can carry a few. Just keep an eye out for trouble.”





I stacked some and lifted them.  We also found some metal thermos cups that Van held onto. 





“I don't see anyone,” he said after stepping outside.





We followed him out, making our way to the Hummer. Drake had his gun in hand and was behind us constantly looking over his shoulder. We got to the Hummer and unlocked it. That's when a bullet whizzed past my temple and hit one of the tail lights.





“So you were holding out on us,” Mrs. Sheaver screamed from her kitchen window.





“Fuck, get inside now,” Drake yelled.





Yanking the doors open, we threw our stuff in before jumping inside ourselves. In the rearview, we could see the rest of our neighbors armed with bats and pipes chasing after us.





“Start the fucking car,” I urged, and then another hole formed in the back windshield.





Drake cranked the ignition and backed up. Then we were out of there like cows escaping a slaughterhouse. We didn't even slow down when we came to the gate. Drake crashed right through it as the screams of Mrs. Sheaver and the others became faint cries.





“Okay, so we're on track for the most part,” I said. “Do you think the convenience store is too close now? I don't want them coming after us.”



“Guys?” We heard Van interject.





We glanced in the rearview again to see several cars gaining on us. The one at the front was a van being driven by Mrs. Sheaver.





“Oh my God,” Drake said. “Gus, lock and load.”



“Already on it. Be mindful of the tires.”





I loaded a rifle and got ready. The sound of metal on metal echoed throughout the car as we were being fired at. Drake tried taking several turns to lose them, but they stayed on our tail. I took a deep breath, then aimed out of one of the windows and shot at one car's tires. I made my mark, resulting in it swerving and crashing into another vehicle. 





Both spun out of control until it was only Mrs. Sheaver left.





“Hold still,” she yelled over the rushing wind. “My eyes aren't what they used to be.”





Unfortunately for her, there was a pothole in the road. It damaged her front tire, causing her to swerve and plow straight into a tree at full speed. We stopped just in time to see it come crashing down, breaking through her windshield.





“God damn,” Drake said.



“I mean, she might still be alright,” I commented.





The tree had gone through some wires. One of them fell on a branch, setting it ablaze.





“Well, at least it was quick.”



“Oh Christ, I'm burning,” Mrs. Sheaver shrieked.





We sat there in silence listening before her cries died down.





“Drake, what time is it?” I asked.



“About twelve till six.”





Today was going to be a long day. We got back on track with our plan and proceeded to the convenience store. We got out and surveyed the damage.



“This thing's tough,” I said.



“Does anyone want to talk about how messed up that all was?” Van asked.



“Yeah, it was pretty fucked,” Drake replied, “but what's done is done. Let's grab what we can and get out of here.”





We tried the door, finding it was unlocked. Inside, a far-from-pretty sight was waiting for us. Blood stains covered the wall behind the counter. Out of morbid curiosity, I peeked over it, seeing only a hand and a shoe with the foot still attached.  A shudder ran through me.





“Hey, Gus, what do you see back there?” Van asked.



“You don’t want to know.”





We started surveying what would be best to bring with us.





“I think we should focus on protein,” I said.



“Like trail mix?” Drake replied. “It’s got fruit too.”



“I hate trail mix, too many raisins,” Van complained.



“What about these?” I asked, cocking a thumb to some protein bars.





Something else caught my eye.





“Hang on,” I said, bending over and picking something up. “We can’t be caught dead without this.”





I held up a pack of toilet paper.





“Good thinking,” Drake said, “Van, grab some, will you?”





Van stared down at it with a grimace.





“I bet it feels like sandpaper,” he grumbled but began gathering as many as he could anyway.





While he did, we filled our three bags with what we could.  Then we took everything back to the Hummer and got back on the road.





“Hey, Drake?” I said as he was closing the trunk.



“What?”



“I’ve been thinking. If this works and we make it out of here, we’re not exactly going to be well off afterward. Do you think maybe we should see if a store happens to have some loose change lying around if you catch my drift?”





I gestured to the convenience store. About six minutes later, we were driving down the road.





“So there was about six hundred bucks in the register which makes two hundred for each of us,” I said, “and there’s more in the safe if we can get it open.





The safe was in the back next to Van.





“I can’t believe you guys stole this from the store.”





“It’s not like anyone’s using it,” Drake said. “Besides, the guy who ran the place was stingy as hell. One time, he tried to charge me double on something. I had to argue with him about it for two minutes straight so we aren’t beating ourselves up about this.”



“How do you think we should get it open?” I asked.



“I don’t know. We’ll figure something out.”.





We guessed that there were blockades set up at every exit out of town. We also assumed that there would be more people active where we tried to get out last time. Instead of going there, we went to the woods on the opposite side of town.





“Remember, there’s no turning back after this,” Drake said, “so only take the necessities. I still want to see about opening the safe, though.”





While he was talking, I was glancing among the trees. One of them seemed odd to me and swayed strangely in the wind. Then I realized with a chill that it was moving.





“Lanker,” I choked out.





Drake and Van turned in time to see it sprinting out of the woods. In a flash, it was to us. We got out of the way as it swiped at us with one of its clawed hands. Its nails dug into the Hummer’s back door, yanking it out. I was thinking maybe if we kept still and tried to keep from shitting ourselves, it would go away.





Drake, thankfully seemed to be on the same wavelength as me. Van, however, was not. He screamed, darting away. The lanker pursued him, giving us time to arm ourselves.  As Van was circling back around, we raised our weapons, squeezing the triggers. As soon as it was focused on us, we knew to split up to divert its attention.





Drake managed to get some shots into it before he had to retreat. While the lanker went after him, I aimed at its legs. This appeared effective as it let out a cry of pain that sounded like when a microphone is held up to a speaker. The good news was it was no longer after Drake. The bad news was I was now its target.





“Drake, shoot it in the back of its knees,” I yelled, sprinting as fast as I could.





I slid under the Hummer and came out the other side.  In spur-of-the-moment planning on my part,  I opened the back door and slammed it shut. This succeeded in fooling the lanker as I snuck behind it, getting its weak spot point blank. Unfortunately, I misjudged the distance. The next thing I knew, it was swinging at me with an object in hand.





I managed to raise my gun to block it and if I hadn’t, I wouldn’t be writing this. Wood splintered as it was broken in half. I observed the world doing several cartwheels as I was rolling along the ground before coming to a stop at the base of a tree.





“Gus,” Drake yelled.





The pain was so immense I couldn’t even get a breath out. The Lanker was about to rip into me until Drake distracted it.





“Guys,” Van cried out in alarm.





I tilted my head up, seeing a metric shit load of zombies racing towards us. 





“Welp, we're fucked,” I thought.





In an unexpected turn of events, though, the lanker was now shrieking at them.  It went after them, grabbing two by their heads, crushing them like watermelons under a hydraulic press. I took the opportunity to examine where I'd been struck. Touching my abdomen yielded pain. Thankfully, nothing seemed to be broken, just some bruising I would need to deal with later. 







Guess I got lucky in that I was knocked away instead of grabbed. If the lanker was smarter, this would be a different story. The other zombies were crawling all over it, gnawing as they did. A crawler saw me in a vulnerable state and tried capitalizing on the opportunity. It pounced and my butt clenched. Then a bullet went through its head. Drake rushed over, helping me up.





“Thanks again, man.”



“No problem.”



“Let's run into the woods while they're occupied,” Van said.



“But our stuff is over there,” I told him. “We won't last long without it.”





We both looked at Drake.





“Let's see how this plays out a little longer,” he said.





For a while, it seemed that the lanker would be the victor. Then its knees buckled as they were chewed through. We watched on, mouths agape. In a move of desperation, it picked the safe back up, swinging it wildly. The zombies previously all over the lanker were now a red paste and it was crawling feebly on the ground.





“I got this,” Drake said.





He went over to it and shot at its legs, blowing them off.  It tried swiping at him, but he'd already backed away. It attempted to stand on its stumps. When it lifted its head, Drake jammed the barrel of his gun down its throat, pulling the trigger. With a last twitch, it was no longer a threat.





“Are you sure it's dead?” Van asked.



“I blew out the back of its head. Of course, it's dead,” Drake replied, then threw a rock at the lanker to be sure.





“Yep, as a doornail.”





Drake came over and helped me up.





“Are you alright?” he asked.



“I'll live.”



“Good, let's get our things.”





Van was already doing that.





“My God is this heavy,” he grunted as he pulled it onto his back.



“Get used to it,” Drake told him.





I glanced around in case we'd have to deal with any more unexpected threats and that's when I noticed the dented-to-shit safe lying on its side with the door open. It didn't take long to count the money inside. There was a little over eight thousand in cash that we divided among the three of us. Thus, our hike began at last. We walked for eight hours, encountering zombies along the way.





Most of the time it was simple to pick them off. The biggest problem came when some tried attacking us from above. I am so glad me and Drake's reflexes are on point. Something unusual we stumbled upon is that whatever has been zombifying people has spread to animals. Long story short, there was a zombie grizzly bear ripping into another bear and its cubs. We thought we would have to deal with this monstrosity.





Luckily, it didn't appear to find us appetizing. That said, it was emitting a deep growl after it noticed us so we got the message to steer clear of it. Eventually, Van told us his feet were aching and suggested we should rest.





“I guess we can stop for a bit,” I said. “Right, Drake?”



“Sure, I was getting hungry anyway.”





We sat down, setting up our packs to rest against. Me and Drake took out some trail mix while Van unwrapped a protein bar.





“Hey,” he said to us, “I got some of these if you want to add them to your water.”





He held up some flavoring packets.





“Hell yeah,” Drake replied, “Toss them here.”



“Actually, I was thinking I could take care of it for you while you guys set up camp since it's going to be dark in a couple of hours.”



“Good point. Gus, help me gather some firewood.”





We did so and threw them into a pile. Van came back up to us with our thermos cups.





“Drake, yours is blue raspberry and Gus, yours is green apple.”





We thanked him and enjoyed the rest of our meal. Halfway through my drink, I was feeling lightheaded.





“Hey, Drake, do I look alright?” I turned to him and noticed he too was in the same condition as me.



“I don't…” he replied with his voice trailing off.





We passed out. When we awoke it was dark and Drake was cussing up a storm.





“What happened?” I asked, shaking off my fatigue.



“That son of a bitch robbed us,” Drake replied. “Look.”





He showed me our wallets which were stripped of cash.





“And he left this.”





I was handed a crumpled piece of paper with this message crudely written on it.





“Sorry to do this. Years working for the mayor have taught me people can be bribed so that's what I'm doing. You won't find me again, but I wish you the best of luck.”





I clenched my fist around it.





“He robbed us.”



“Yeah, I just said that.”



“Well, what do we do now?”



“Get moving, I guess. Can't believe this. How do we get our shit stolen twice in two days?”





We wondered how Van would survive on his own. Then again, he did have a snack for avoiding trouble as he was able to before we bumped into him. After walking for some time, we saw an orange light in the distance.





“I think that's a campfire,” I exclaimed. “Do you think it might be Van?”



“If it is, I'm going to have some words for him,” Drake replied, patting his holstered handgun.





We stepped into the clearing to find a bunch of people standing around a bonfire. They were wearing hooded white robes and turned when they heard us.





“Oh shit, it's the fucking Klan. Drake, get behind me,” I urged, stepping in front of me.





One of them stepped forward, revealing the face of a grinning man.





“Worry not, friends. You have no reason to fear us.”





He explained that his name was Jeff and he founded their group, cult really, of survivors and they called themselves The Uplagued. Every one of them smiled from ear to ear and asked us if we wanted to stay.





“No disrespect, we'd love to, but we need to keep moving,” Drake told them.



“That's a shame,” Jeff responded. “We were about to pass around the calumet.”





For those who don't know, that's another word for the peace pipe used by the natives. Drake and I exchanged a look. Ten minutes later, we were sitting in a smoke circle. When Drake's turn came, he took a rip from it worthy of a dragon about to breathe fire. I got in a good one when my turn came.





Now, I'm high as the moon typing this on my phone.  After what we've been through today, it's nice to have something to take the edge off. I'm not sure what we're going to do about our financial situation if we make it out. Hopefully, we come up with something. For now, the munchies are [calling ](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/)my [name.](https://www.threads.net/@rose_black2222)
