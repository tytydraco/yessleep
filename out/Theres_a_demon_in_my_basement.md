I've been saving up money for a house. I was about halfway to my goal when my roommates decided to ditch me with the rent. With no other choice, I had to look for cheaper housing, and that's when I saw it: a one-story house with a basement for $25k total.
I was shocked but not stupid, so I looked into it. The listing didn't go into much detail, but it said previous owners had either gone missing, gone insane, or both. The weirder part, though, was that local churches considered it a private reliquary—a place to hold religious relics.

Some might say, "Just go live with your parents or something," but I actually aged out of the system three years ago and haven't been very social—never was. I went into a union right away and have just kept my eyes ahead. I don't really care about my parents; they're most likely just some deadbeats who couldn't afford a kid. Honestly, religion was never my thing either, so I went to check it out.

After getting the appointment set up, I met my realtor, Rachel, a brunette woman in business casual attire with two crosses: one small one around her neck and one in her hand.

"Hello! Daniel, right? Nice to see you in person. Welcome to hopefully your new home! May I ask you to put this on?" she said swiftly, with all the cheer of a salesperson.
"Um, do I have to? I'll take care of the house as needed, but I don't really believe in the big man," I stated, rubbing the back of my head, already starting to regret my decision.

"It's fine as long as you have it on your person. It helps, trust me," she said, still filled with joy, but there was some pleading in her voice. I sighed and nodded, taking it and holding it in my hand, caressing my finger against the metal now in my hand.

We walked in, and it was nothing like the pictures. It was a pretty simple layout: two doorways. The left one led to the living room, which was connected to the kitchen, and the other led to a long hallway with a closet for jackets, two bedrooms, and a bathroom at the very end. To the left of the bathroom was the basement door, connecting the kitchen and hallway.

It all looked brand new, fully furnished, and had every basic appliance someone would need. I should have been delighted to find such a steal of a house, but this concerned me more. And then we went to the basement door.

I went to reach for the handle, but Rachel quickly slapped my hand. "What the hell was that for?!" I said, confusion at the forefront.

"Sir, please don't use that language, and I did that for your safety. I don't want to think you're stupid, but you have to assume there's a reason why the house is cheap, correct?" I went a bit quiet. We were basically the same age, but I felt like I was back in high school getting talked to by the principal.

"This door..." she spoke softly, as she rubbed her cross gently. "There's a demon behind it, a creature that is nothing but the evils of the world, and wants to taint every single one of us."

I was shocked. How were you supposed to respond to someone with such conviction or belief in what they say? This sounded serious, way too serious for ordinary people. So if it was real, why was it a house?
"So this world-ending threat is just behind a door? Why isn't this a government building or, I don't know, some kind of holy protected space?" I did my best to be nonchalant, clutching the cross in my hand tighter.

"People have tried. This once was a church, then a government building, and now it is a home." She had to think for a moment before continuing. "Think of it like a game. It likes this game of tempting people to open the door, to pull your strings till you're its puppet. But because of that, it stays in the basement, and anytime we try to deal with it..." She stammered at the end, still trying to find the words, "It resets the area? Whatever was here disappears, and a new game is set to play."

My body tensed; this all seemed ludicrous. "So what? I'm the next victim? Sending a lamb to the slaughter?"
"It has stayed as a house for decades now. If you need a home and have faith and conviction, then it should be easy."

Faith I had none to little, but conviction I had. I worked from nothing, and I won't have that ripped from me by some demon or asshole roommates.
"...Okay, so what do I have to do? Put salt and water on the ground or something?"

"Even easier: one line of safety is that cross you're holding. Bearing it gives us some protection; for instance, there is no whispering. But in the end, just don't listen or take anything from it. If you see something, just throw it away or walk the other way."

I listened. Then we sat down and wrote some of the key rules, which all boiled down to one thing: don't touch the door.

I'm pretty confident about this. Stupid or cocky, whatever you want to call me, go ahead. But once I have a nice home, I earned it. It just sucks I don't have a good roommate.

Honestly, I wasn't going to write anything until last night. I got up from bed to use the bathroom and get a glass of water. Business as usual, but as I turned to the kitchen, into the doorway of the kitchen, I kicked something. It made a sloshing noise as the moonlight illuminated a bottle of water. It was just the right temperature, pleasantly wrapped, and looked like the purest water I had ever seen.

I was looking at it before I jumped a little, realizing what I had in my hand. I threw it away without a second thought and just went back to bed, not thirsty anymore.
If anything else happens, I'll probably post again, but maybe the demon will tempt me, haha.
