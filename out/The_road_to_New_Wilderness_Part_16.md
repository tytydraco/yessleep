*Splash.*

Ice cold water ripped me from the merciful arms of sleep, and I jerked awake with a gasp.

“On your feet.” Boatswain Emilia leered at me with a wicked grin and threw a sharp kick into my hip for added measure. “You’ve got work to do, scum.”

It was dark in the hold, as the solitary lantern had burned out, but a third hovered over us, held by one of the younger pirates. They flanked the boatswain, who stared down her crooked nose with a gleeful delight in our appearance, the empty water bucket in her hands. My throat ached, dry and hot, and I wondered how long we’d been asleep. All my limbs were stiff, a tight spot had formed in my lower back, and every bruise from the previous day’s abuse throbbed under my skin. The water stank like it had been sitting for a while, and slimy patches of green algae dotted my uniform shirt, which told me they’d drawn the pail from a stagnant place just for us.

I barely had time to move, before the boatswain picked up a second bucket, and hurled it into our beleaguered faces.

*I really hate this girl.*

Cackling in amusement, she rammed the toe of her knee-high sailing boots into my ribs, and pain exploded in my chest.

In a blur of motion, Chris dove between us, and caught the full force of her next attack in the gut with a muffled grunt.

“Oh, we have a hero! There’s always one like you.” Emelia’s eyes twinkled with hateful delight, and she brought her heel down on Chris’s torso again and again, spitting the words between gritted teeth. “You’re. Not. Saving. *Anyone.*”

Despite the cold water that dripped down the back of my shirt, and the ache in my sore ribs, rage took hold of my mind like a waterfall of red and every rational thought left my mind.

“Leave him alone!” I lunged at the boatswain, but a swift hand flashed at my face, and sent me reeling to the floor.

“Shut it, princess.” Emelia gripped one of her swords, daring us to rise again, and turned her attention back to Chris. “Get up, tough guy. Anyone who can’t work feeds the sharks.”

Jamie scowled at the boatswain and dragged Chris back from the reach of the pirate’s boot. “He hurt his leg on shore. Just give us a second, and—”

“He can scrub and crawl all the same.” A smirk crossed Emelia’s face, and she shrugged an indifferent shoulder at Jamie. “You can too. I figure you’re right at home on your knees, aren’t you, pretty one?”

Jamie bristled, and I saw her fingers twitch toward her back pocket, as if to reach for something.

Chris’s hand came up and caught her wrist, his face stoic despite the taunts of our captor. “It’s not worth it, Jamie. I’m fine.”

“Yeah, Jamie.” Emelia sneered and arched her foot back for another kick at Chris. “He’s a big boy. He can take it.”

*I’ll kill her.*

My pulse surged, and I pulled both feet under me for another pounce, ready to sink my teeth into her throat if I had to.

“Enough.”

From the shadows, a figure strode forward, a boarding axe stuck in his belt, a pistol on his opposite hip. He had long black hair under a bandana and wore a coat similar to the captain’s but with a regular T-shirt under it instead of a fancy white button-down. On his black shirt, a white skull-an-crossbones grinned back, weathered, and sun-dried. The boy seemed around the same age as the captain, perhaps somewhat younger on closer inspection, but the arms crossed in front of him rippled with muscle, and I could tell he’d seen his fair share of hard work.

A frown slithered over Emelia’s sour face. “It’s the boatswain’s duty to deal with prisoners.”

“You’re to obey the first mate in the absence of the captain.” The boy with the axe stared right back into her eyes, his own muted grey irises showing no hint of fear. “And I said *enough*.”

Emelia seethed, and she stepped closer to him with one hand on the hilt of her right-side saber.

Unmoved, the first mate watched her with his own stern expression, but I noticed his hand rest on the steel head of his axe with deft ease. The other two pirates took a few steps back, their eyes darting in nervous flits between the boatswain and the first mate.

Jamie glanced at me, and I could sense her unease, Chris eyeing the two with a patient, yet calculating gaze. What was this? No one among the crew had stood up for us before.

Emelia narrowed her eyes at the first mate, but took her hand off her sword, and pushed past him with a disgruntled huff. “Fine. You babysit them. I’ve got better things to do anyway.”

She stormed to the steps leading to the ship’s upper decks, and her hard, angry footfalls echoed overhead like thunderclaps.

Turning to us, the first mate took in our wet clothes and pale faces with a sympathetic frown. “You said his ankle is broken?”

“Sprained.” Chris shrugged it off, his wary eyes on the pirate. “Like I said, I’ll manage.”

“All the same, we should have it seen to.” The first mate turned to the two guards and jerked his head toward the nearby steps. “Phillip, go find Anita and tell her to bring her things. Carl, get these three some water, and a pack of those little crackers from the food locker.”

They both gaped at him in surprise, but trotted off without another word, and left the four of us alone in the gloom, with the first mate holding the lantern.

He crouched down, and locked eyes with me. “You should be careful around the boatswain. She’s a lot like the others; they think causing pain is good sport. No point in getting yourselves beaten to a pulp.”

Hesitant, I eyed Jamie and Chris, but nodded to our new-found protector. “Thank you.”

“Don’t thank me yet.” Standing, the first mate watched as Carl came running back with three bottles of water and a plastic sleeve of saltine crackers. “You’ve still got a full day’s work ahead of you. Just try to keep your heads down, and hopefully they’ll get bored with tormenting you.”

He wasn’t wrong. After being kind enough to let each of us use the one modern convenience the old sailing ship had, (a bathroom with a composting toilet and a privacy curtain in one corner of the gun deck) we were looked over by a quiet curly-haired girl with a medical bag. She bound Chris’s ankle, as well as Jamie’s shoulder, and put some ointment on our superficial cuts and bruises, enough to where I didn’t feel quite so miserable. However, the water and crackers barely did anything to stave off the rumbling in my stomach, but I didn’t dare to ask for more. After all, we were lucky anyone had shown us this much kindness, and it would have been foolish for me to push my luck.

With the niceties out of the way, we were marched up the steps to the main deck, into a blinding aura of warm sunlight.

In the daylight, it struck me just how massive this new body of water was. Glittering blue waves rolled from one end of the skyline to the other, with thin strips of green to our north and south, nothing but water to the northwest and southeast. Seagulls screeched overhead, the rigging creaked, and the huge white sails snapped taught in the cool morning breeze. The sun rose over the eastern edge of the water, with long rays of red, orange, pink and gold that kissed my face in happy swathes. Wind ruffled my hair, the air sweet and clean unlike the claustrophobic brig, and waves hushed against the wooden sides of the hull with rhythmic splashes.

“Since you two are crippled, you can scrub the deck.” The first mate pointed Jamie and Chris to a set of nearby wooden pails, with rags and two gritty square stones next to them. “Should be enough to keep you busy for a while.”

To me, he handed a mop and bucket. “You swab behind them. Be thorough; the crew will be watching.”

*Great.*

I took the mop with a glum sigh, and the three of us got to work.

Minutes stretched into hours, the sun rising to become a hot beacon of misery overhead. The water turned into a bright mirror at midday to reflect heat and humidity like an oven, and I dripped with sweat in my black uniform shirt. Chris and Jamie labored on their hands and knees over the hot deck, scrubbing each plank down with the sandstones and wet rags. Occasionally, the first mate would step in from his careful watch over us and lend a hand, but he mostly just watched from where he leaned on the nearby railing. All around me, the rest of the crew was hard at work too, a carpentry team of the older children sawing at a replacement pole for a damaged section of the rigging, several younger ones sitting in a line to stich up torn sailcloth, with the littlest daubing some kind of lacquer over the ship’s rails with paintbrushes. At the helm on the opposite end of the ship, I could make out Captain Grapeshot and Tarren huddled around a small table, her standing on a box while he steadied her so she wouldn’t fall. They were both smiling as they scribbled on some unseen piece of paper, and the captain had taken his long coat off to reveal his lanky torso and a sweat-soaked red T-shirt. Without the murk of night, and the flash of steel in their hands, they all looked that much more like misplaced school kids, not bloodthirsty criminals.

“You missed a spot.”

The first mate nodded at a bare patch of deck, and I swished the mop over it, doing my best not to say something rash. I was in no position to be mouthy, no matter how much I wanted to throw the mop bucket at them all.

“I admit, I’m rather impressed that anyone is still left up north.” He scratched his stubble, and the first mate eyed me with curious appraisal, lapsing into the Caribbean-styled accent they all tried to speak with in between broken modern vernacular. “With how many of the monsters there are on shore, I’d have wagered you lot were all wiped out by now.”

“We could say the same for you.” Jamie paused from pushing her sandstone block and wiped a bead of sweat from her brow. “How’d you guys end up way out here?”

The first mate grinned and shut his eyes to bask in the sun as it rose higher. “Long story, mate. Short of it is, we won this tub fair and square from a geezer who should have cut and run when he had the chance. Captain took us out into the deep water to stay clear of all the mess on shore, and we’ve been here ever since.”

Stretching with a few sore grimaces, Chris gestured to the boarding axe in the first mate’s belt. “You kill freaks with those things?”

“Course we do.” The first mate winked, and pointed to a boy who worked on tying knots nearby with his back to us. “Jack here brought down a giant crawfish, big as a bus, with naught but a pike and his wits.”

Jack turned from the rail to beam at the sound of his name, and I stared at the stump of his left hand, only scarred flesh left where the wrist should have been. A crude iron hook had been strapped to the side of his arm to allow him to work, but it was a far cry from any modern prosthetic. To see it on a kid, who could have been fourteen at the oldest, made my brain reel.

“You killed a mutant with only one hand?” Jamie raised an incredulous eyebrow.

Jack fixed her with a proud, defiant stare. “I had both when I started.”

Her face fell, much like mine, and Jamie went back to her scrubbing without another word. Chris did the same, and we threw ourselves into the silent routine of work, our thoughts weighing us down like chains. How long had these children been out here, on their own, fending for themselves against nightmares that would frighten Navy Seals?

The more I looked around, the more I noticed missing hands, stubby half-fingers, a few peg legs, and even some scattered eye patches that didn’t appear to be only cosmetic. These kids should have been in school, playing at recess, complaining about math homework, but instead they were fighting for their lives, and losing pieces of themselves every day.

My eyes traveled to Boatswain Emelia, who manned the ship’s wheel, and I ducked my head down before she could spot me, the bruises on my body still aching from her last visit.

*Okay, so they’ve had it rough, I’ll give them that. But why do they hate us so much?*

“Captain!” A sharp cry from the crow’s nest jerked me from my musings, and I joined nearly everyone else on deck who craned their heads skyward. “Speedboat, port side, a hundred yards out!”

Excited shouts rippled through the crew, and everyone crowded to the left-side rail, save for Jamie, Chris, the first mate, and myself.

Horrified, I squinted out over the shiny water.

It skimmed along the surface of the lake at moderate speed, a white boat with no sails, humming along toward the north. A few people stood on the deck, but none of them wore any uniforms, and they scrambled to hide behind the rails as the boat veered away from the pirate ship.

The crew let out a cheer of delight, and the ship started to turn for a broadside, the gun crews running to their cannons on the second deck.

*Maybe they can outrun us? I mean, I don’t think this ship has a motor. If they can get away, they can tell someone and . . . and what, Hannah? No one is coming to save you.*

My dismal thoughts hurt worse than the boatswain’s boot, and I grimaced, waiting for the cannon fire that would slam into the fleeing boat full of hapless civilians.

*Boom.*

The sound came not from the ship’s guns, but from somewhere down below, deep in the water, and sent a shudder throughout the entire lake. It traveled up through the ship, into my chest, like a shockwave, and as one, the entire pirate crew fell silent.

“Down.” Appearing behind me, the first mate yanked the mop from my hands and pushed me to one knee, waving at Chris and Jamie to do the same. “Stay down, and don’t look up until I say so.”

Startled, I obeyed without question, and noticed out of the corner of my eye that the rest of the pirates did the exact same thing, everyone kneeling with their heads bowed, eyes either shut, or on the deck. Many of them had gone pale, clutching weapons to their chests in trembling fists, and some of the younger ones sniffled as if ready to cry. Captain Grapeshot climbed down from the helm to kneel with his crew on the deck, Tarren hidden behind him, and the way they all kept so still, so quiet, sent a chill through my blood.

They weren’t trying to pursue the motorboat; no one had so much as fired a shot.

Why?

*Boom.*

Another ripple vibrated through the hull, and as I was close enough to the rail, I dared to peek through a hole made for the rigging.

In the greenish-blue water under the ship, a massive shadow slid through the depths. Far down enough that I couldn’t see much in the way of detail, the creature glided by with the ease of a shark, though it was easily three times the length of the pirate vessel and four flipper-like limbs swept back and forth on each side of its body. A long tail trailed swished from side-to-side, making the *boom* sound every time it smashed a sunken farmhouse or barn, and the way it moved rang with eerie familiarity inside my head.

*Please don’t be that, please don’t be that, please don’t be that . . .*

Disappearing into the murky waves, the shadow moved out of sight.

A long minute passed, and the motorboat hummed further into the distance.

*Whoosh.*

Unable to keep still, everyone looked up at the eruption of water, as a massive head pierced the waves around the white speedboat.

I stifled a gasp, my eyes locked on the sight. It wasn’t a crocodile.

It was much, much worse.

Gray and white scales were drawn tight over a long snout, patterned much in the same way as tree bark, but without the typical fringe around the base of its head like many of the land-dwelling mutants. Water spilled from the dinosaurian jaws as they rose with row after row of dagger-shaped teeth, wide enough to swallow a semi-truck whole. Speckles of black dotted its armored hide, as if the beast were shedding some kind of greasy coat in the morning sunshine, and two eyes lined each side of its skull, all four closed in the momentum of its attack. Birds scattered in the sky, the ship rocked in the waves, and from deep within the beast’s throat, a triumphant roar cut through the air.

Muffled screams echoed for just a moment, the white speedboat tumbling end over end between a huge set of jaws, and then the teeth came together in a dull *crunch* that rattled my ribcage, the boat smashed to splinters in an instant.

Down it went into the water, and a tidal wave lifted the ship in its wake, rocking us from side to side like a toy in a bathtub.

“What the . . .” Jamie breathed to my left, her face sheet white.

I shook from head to toe, and Chris took the opportunity to slide his hand into mine.

“Stay calm.” He whispered, though I doubted he honestly felt that way from how his hand gripped mine like a vise. “If it comes for us, jump when I jump. Just don’t let go, alright?”

Squeezing his palm so hard that my knuckles turned white, I bored into his eyes with my own, hoping beyond hope that this wasn’t the last day of my life.

Other murmurs picked up around the deck, nervous whispers, and a few muffled sobs.

Captain Grapeshot raised his head and scanned the water with his eyes. “Quiet, all of you! It’s coming back.”

A fresh ripple cut though the choppy waves, and a shadow rose beside the ship.

*I’m about to die. We’re all going to die here, on this boat, in the middle of nowhere.*

“Eyes down!” The first mate called, and I lowered my gaze to the wood at my knees just as the top of the creature’s head broke through the water.
