Now before I get on to my experience I promise I’m not making this up or at the time came across anything that is related to the creepypasta I seriously never even knew that it existed. So I remember when I was like 13 (currently 18) I’d get this repeating nightmare from time to time. But it would start off with me being in some movie theater I’d go to and I would be in the bathroom washing my hands and then look at the mirror and see some creepy ass face that was smiling and when I’d stare at it from the reflection it’s like the lights would go out then come back on and it would get closer and closer until I woke up. I would then see the same face again in a few nightmares but one day I remember watching some horror videos and those horror story videos and they used a picture that had the same exact face that I’d see in my nightmares (keep in mind I never came across that picture anywhere and would only see the face in my nightmares). I never knew any backstory to the picture until last year I was trying to look for it and it was based off a creepypasta called “no mires a mandu” translated to English “don’t look at mandu”, and the same way the creepypasta would go would be the same way my nightmare went. I never knew it was based off a creepypasta or knew anything about its existence, I decided to just post this here to see if anyone had a similar experience or anything because I’m still confused and creeped tf out about the whole situation I had. And I truly apologize if I posted this on the wrong subreddit I just don’t know where else to ask this on.
