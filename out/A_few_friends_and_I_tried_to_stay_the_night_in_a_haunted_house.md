The four of us snuck out that night. The weather was everyone’s favorite H words: hot, hazy, and humid. You know, the kind of weather that makes it a pain in the ass to get some sleep. That’s why we were out sharing a bottle of vodka Tommy swiped from his parents’ cabinet. He drank most of it while Rebecca, Amanda, and I only got a few sips. For us, any amount of alcohol was brag worthy. We got “wicked drunk” on the way to that house and stayed the whole night.

Every small town must have *that* abandoned house. No one lived in it for years and the happy neighbors trim and tidy their lawns right up to the chain-link fence as if compelled by the force of juxtaposition to announce “Thems ghosts in theah!” The kids in the area naturally come up with rumors about the place: It’s haunted, there’s a witch inside, your favorite slasher flick character uses it in the off-season, etc. We lucky four will find out tonight.

“Fucking finally.” Amanda said, pulling on her shirt to fan herself. I doubt it was effective, but I didn't argue with the view.

“Wha? You think it’s going to be cooler inside?” I said.

“It’d be a lot cooler without you.” Rebecca said, eager to pull out one of our favorite cliches.

“Ladies, please,” Tommy addressed all three of us, “We can catfight inside.” He opened the door and walked inside like he owned the place .

The liquid courage might have helped, but stupidity and hormones fuel Tommy’s fearlessness. Spending a night in this house was his idea. “Booze and scary stories drive women crazy, John. You could be balls deep in Rebecca in no time at all. Trust me.” I don’t know how he talked the other two into this, but I refused to let him lose his virginity in a threesome with two soccer players.

Rebecca and I hesitated. The childish tales of vampires, murders, and zombies became real. We immediately forgot them upon crossing the threshold where you could feel the stale air hit you. You felt like you were the first human to breathe this air in God knows how many years. Once my eyes adjusted to the dark, the floral design furniture and wallpaper I saw would make grandmas everywhere proud.

“Feels just like home, guys!” Tommy was reclining on a couch in the living room.

“Grandma’s going to be wicked pissed with your shoes up on the cushion.” I said.

“Tell grandma to suck a fat one.” He tried to look cool taking a swig from the empty bottle. “Ya scared yet, girls?”

“Fuck no.” Amanda said, taking the bottle from him. She sat in his lap, tried to take a sip and threw the bottle in a corner.

“No.” Rebecca said. She was standing close to me with her arms crossed. She was still feeling the kid stories.

Tommy went on and on about how great we are for spending the night in the “haunted” house. Not only our classmates, but the whole town will never forget us. Women will drop their panties and say “Hey, Tommy. Spend a night in here.” Amanda and I laughed at the exaggerated reception of our heroism while Rebecca was doing her best to smile. She was the only one paying attention to the other noises in the house.

“I’m tired!” Amanda interrupted.

“Hell, yeah. Let’s find a bedroom and get you out of these clothes.” He pulled on her gym short’s waistband to get a peek at her ass. All he got was a slap and a smile.

“Don’t think I didn’t feel you, but I don’t want a fucking audience.”

She stood up and revealed Tommy’s excitement. Rebecca finally lightened up and laughed. Tommy stood up, clearly at full mast. His brain ran on marathons of porn where the actresses lost all sense of reason just because a well-endowed man existed. It didn’t embarrass him in the slightest.

Amanda led Tommy out of the room like she held an invisible chain around his neck. Their footfalls echoed through the house as Rebecca and my laughter died out into an awkward silence. We tried not to look at one another until she broke the silence.

“Take me home.”

“What?”

“It’s too creepy here and I’m not as easy as Amanda.”

“You don’t want to stay the whole night?”

“No. I’m only here because she talked me into it and I don’t like it here. I swear I heard something breathing since we walked in.”

“Okay, I’m sure the happy couple won’t notice if we…”

Something loud stomped above us on the second floor. Rebecca hugged me while I was still coming to grips with losing my shot with her tonight. I wanted to tell a joke about Tommy doing an ape mating dance, but a scream interrupted me. Actually, it was two. First, Amanda. Then Rebecca screamed in return.

At least Rebecca stopped. Amanda only paused to inhale and scream some more. Rebecca and I forced our legs to obey and check on the banshee. We followed her voice up the stairs and found her topless on the floor in the hallway, pointing into a bedroom.

Rebecca tried to soothe her while I looked over the room. Tommy was lying on his back next to Amanda’s shirt. I took a step inside the room to try to wake him and Amanda yelled at me to stop. I did. From here, I could see the streetlights reflecting off of a pool of blood. His neck was bent at a weird angle and looked like something took a chunk out of it.

“No! Amanda, wait!” Rebecca yelled.

I turned around in time to see Amanda run down the hall toward the stairs. She wasn’t staying here any longer. She turned the corner and went down a single step before screaming again. It jumped up the stairs and pounced on her. That thing looked like a small chitinous raptor. Its two powerful legs pinned Amanda to the floor while it bent down and tore out chunks of her throat.

Rebecca screamed. I think I did too. It’s hard to tell when you’re in the moment.

That thing lifted its head up from Amanda and turned toward us with razor-sharp teeth dripping blood and bits of flesh. It was relishing in our fear as we backed away. We were cornered prey ripe for the taking. Its claws clicked on the floor as it walked toward us.

The next move came from the house itself. The floor gave out beneath us, and we fell into the hallway below. Next thing I remember was picking myself off the splintered mess we made. The cuts and scratches would tell you differently, but I didn’t feel any pain. Rebecca tried to stand and fell. Her ankle was bent at a bad angle.

The thing was coming down the stairs. I looked at Rebecca and made a terrible decision I feel awful for. I ducked into a room and hid behind the door. She yelled for help. Yelled for me to come back. I held my breath as the monster walked past and took his third meal.

“John! You fucking bastard!” was the last thing I heard Rebecca say.

Once I heard the sounds of the feast, I booked it to the front door. My mind was so focused on getting out that I didn’t even care when it noticed me. I got out of the house and slammed the front door shut in time to feel its body hit the door.

I can barely remember walking home. I woke up the next day hoping it was all a dream and all the cuts and bruises were hallucinations. Tommy, Amanda, and Rebecca were reported missing. They never looked in the house as far as I know. Eventually, rumors spread that they ran away to California or Florida. I didn’t say anything. They wouldn’t believe me.
