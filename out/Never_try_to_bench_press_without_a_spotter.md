  As I dropped my phone on the worn, gray, formerly black rubberized floor, I noted the time as 1:22 in the morning. One of the few perks of working the closing shift was that once I got off work at midnight, I had the entire gym facility for myself. If it weren’t for my ritual of procrastinating, doom-scrolling, and halfhearted warmups, I would already be 30 minutes into my workout. After throwing a few plates on the bar, I slid onto the cool, smooth faux leather of the bench and lay my head back. The familiar wobble side to side as I got settled was like the embrace of an old friend.

The secluded, worn-down old Smith machine was by far my favorite in the 24/7 gym. All the brand logos appeared to be rubbed off by the incessant use of sweaty bodies. But to me, it was special. Using it reminded me of the old, creaking pull-up station my father had taught me to use in his garage many years ago. It made me feel nostalgic.

Disengaging the safety mechanism on the Smith machine, I slowly lowered the weight until it just barely touched my chest, before forcing it back up with ease, the barbell making a satisfying metal-on-metal sound against the guide rails. A lot of people may find working a night shift to be lonely or depressing, but I always thrived when I could live with the independence that comes with being alone, especially at the gym, a place that was bursting at the seams with the sounds and smells of people pushing their bodies to the limits. At least, that was how the gym felt during normal business hours. But at night, what would normally be a minefield of self-deprecating comparisons and distractions turned into a playground for me and, rarely, a few other individuals.

I continued with another set after increasing my weight slightly. It was challenging, but I had no struggle pushing the weight every time I allowed it to lower. The buzz of fluorescent lights, the hum of the HVAC, and the rhythmic up and down motion and sounds lulled me into a meditative state. I was rudely awakened by a sudden flash of pain. With a sickening pop and what I imagined a drumstick being torn from a chicken would feel like, my right shoulder gave out under the 100 kilograms of metal crashing towards me like a semi-truck on ice.

My good arm buckled, despite its valiant attempts to keep the weight up. For a second, I panicked. As cliché as it sounded, my life flashed before my eyes, but mostly I thought of how my family would react. I could imagine my parents, fiancé, and some distant relatives gathered around a headstone reading simply “He died like an idiot.” Or even worse, I could be found by some fellow gym-goer, who would only laugh at my corpse crumpled beneath such a meager weight, I would die from embarrassment if I wasn't already dead.

Fortunately, I had the presence of mind to twist my wrists, despite the screaming pain from my right arm, and felt the bar click into a fixed position, directly pressing on my sternum. My heart pounded in my chest, seeming to reverberate against the cold steel pushing back on it. My breaths came in short, wheezing gasps, exhausted from the exertion and pain. I began to scold myself internally, as my breathing became shallow due to the obstacle preventing my chest from fully expanding. 

I should know better than to bench without a spotter, my internal critic monologued. I knew that, but arrogance had clearly gotten the better of my self-preservation instinct. Since the bar rotated hooks, allowing it to stop before the weight could fall on you, I assumed that the machine would be safe enough to use alone. However, now the pressure sitting like a rock on my chest, forcing my small crucifix to dig painfully into my skin, convinced me that this was not as risk-free as I had imagined.

Pushing aside the nagging voice, I began to shimmy with my feet, sliding my butt down the surface of the bench. Slowly, painfully, my chest slipped out from under the metal vice it had been held in. I gasped as I could feel the warm trickle of blood underneath my hoodie, from where the wooden charm I wore had sloughed off a few layers of skin that were stretched over my rising and falling chest. I took a few seconds, just reveling in the newfound freedom to breathe, before I gritted my teeth and tried to pull my head out from under the bar. But no matter how I twisted, turned, or maneuvered my head, an ear, jawbone, or my skull itself halted my progress. 

I started to sob in desperation, kicking my feet like an impudent child. The barbell simply hovered with a menacing stillness, mere inches from my exposed windpipe. Despite my predicament, I began to laugh uncontrollably. I knew I would survive this after all, but the embarrassment of being found in such a compromising position seemed suddenly amusing. 

So, I simply lay there, unable to reach my phone, with no one around to help. I hoped that soon, some other lonely night shifter would wander in and find my predicament. I felt dizzy, dehydrated, and completely alone. The fluorescent lights seemed more like the blazing orange sun of a desert, ready to bleach my bones white after the circling vultures had their fill. Rather than continue to ponder my uncomfortable position and my own stupidity, I decided to shut my eyes and rest until help arrived. I jolted awake sometime later when I heard the doors clatter open.

“Hello?” I called out, voice strained, “Please help me out here!”

I heard footsteps squeaking across the floor as I began to babble some half-hearted explanation of my status, all while blinking bleary eyes against the incessant clinical brightness of the gym. After finishing my speech, I took a pause to breathe, only then realizing that the stranger had stopped a few feet away from my head, and they continued to stand there in silence.

“Would you mind giving me a hand?”

My pitiful cry seemed to echo in the quiet and stillness, the only answer being ragged, raspy breathing that came from the figure. I strained to look back and see this not-so-good Samaritan, but could only make out a pair of legs and a torso wearing long, black clothes. Some small, primeval side of my brain told me to be very still and very silent, as my breathing grew panicked and shallow, matching the crescendo of the stranger’s excited, husky gasps. With a sudden lurch of movement, the hulking, hooded shape lunged past me and lifted a plate off the nearby rack. I gritted my teeth together, screwing my eyes shut for the impending blow, but instead heard the familiar metallic click of weight being loaded onto the bar.

I watched in sheer horror as the masked and hooded man began to eagerly place weight after weight on each side of the fixed bar, until the frame of the machine began to groan in protest. With cold certainty, I knew this assailant was going to try to crush me under over half a ton of weight, with my neck perfectly lined up for the modern-day guillotine. With renewed desperation, I slammed my chin and face into the unmoving barrier preventing my escape. I tried in desperation to cry out for help, praying that some unlikely passerby would save me, or more realistically, just be a witness to my horrific fate. With a burst of speed, a large, calloused hand wrapped around my mouth, as the other reached towards the barbell, twisting slowly.

To no surprise, the masked killer was trying to release the creaking metal pole from the safety clip, and I had a feeling he wasn’t trying to help me set a new PR. In an animal attempt to survive, I scratched and punched at the tree trunks of forearms above me, and bit down on the tough leather of his hand, filling my mouth with the bitter, tangy taste of blood. To my increasing horror and revulsion, the man only made a soft, chuckling groan, halfway between pain, exertion, and arousal. I could feel and taste how his unwashed skin glistened with sweat, and feel his rapid heartbeat on his wrists. This sick freak was enjoying this. Then, with a snap that made my stomach drop, the bar was freed from its safeguards and began to press down with insurmountable pressure.

In the instant before the impending death could shatter my fragile throat, I decided to try a desperate move I had not considered before. Hooking my feet around the old, unreliable at best bench frame, I jerked my bodyweight suddenly to the left side. As the weight came down, so did the bench. I flipped over onto my side, faceplanting directly into the frame of the machine. Stars burst in my vision, as a warm geyser shot from what remained of my nose. With a resounding explosion of sound, the barbell finally stopped, impacting hard with the floor. But due to the width of the plates and my face-down position slumped underneath the toppled bench, I had barely escaped near-certain death.

Giving myself no time to feel relieved, I sprang up, striking my head on a different part of the frame as I went, filling my vision with a new constellation of stars. Blinking through the pain, I was both glad and frightened to see that my attacker had vanished. My thoughts raced around my head, which was being racked by wave after wave of fresh pain. My cell phone was nowhere to be found, and I glanced around uneasily, each of the once familiar weight stations and machines now turning into an arsenal of death traps for this madman.

Grabbing a small kettlebell, I began to quietly creep between the rows, intimately aware of every sound. The silence lay unbroken, excluding the shuffle of my feet and the steady pitter-patter of scarlet dripping from my busted face. My right arm dangled uselessly, each step sending a shockwave of pain through it from the fingertip all the way up, as my left arm brandished the kettlebell overhead. 

I tried to shuffle back to the front entrance of the facility, when I was stopped dead in my tracks with fresh fear. The killer was standing, silhouetted against the glass doors and windows, his frame going up past the exit sign. Taking it in now, I could see that he stood at least 7 feet tall, with his shoulders alone being too wide to fit through any average door frame. His head was turned down, and out from under his surgical-style mask, thick layers of drool were pooling onto the tile below him. He continued to grunt, a deeply unnerving sound as he lumbered towards me, oven mitt-sized hands clenched into fists.

I started to step back, compelled by terror to just run away from the inhuman mass of muscle and loathing coming towards me, but then my eyes caught the corner of a small sticker proudly emblazoned on the double, glass, magnetically locked doors of the entrance. I remember from passively observing it day after day, the sign reads “Protected by Safeguard Systems LLC”.

With the last reserves of strength left in my body, I raise and hurl the 8 KG hunk of iron from my left hand. The stranger ducks his head and raises his arms defensively, clearly surprised at my last-ditch effort to survive. But the projectile flies true and shatters the glass on impact, causing the shrill scream of alarms to echo throughout the almost empty building. I know with grim satisfaction that help is on the way, and I saw the hooded figure stop and consider this. To my shock, he simply turned and exited through the ruined doors, broad shoulders slumped in disappointment. When I could no longer feel the impact of his massive footfalls through the ground, I sank to my knees and collapsed from the agony throughout my whole body.

When I gave this whole story to the mildly interested, overweight cop who stood at my hospital bedside, it sounded far less horrifying and mostly plain absurd. Improbably, the DNA the attacker left behind at the scene matched no known criminal in their database, and soon the whole case went cold and was shuffled to some folder in the back of an office, no doubt. By the time I was discharged from the hospital, I was told it was basically hopeless, but I was too glad to be alive to care.

Despite destroying a very expensive piece of equipment and a literal door, the gym even offered me a lifetime free membership as consolation for my near-death ordeal. But due to the months of physical therapy I knew lay ahead of me, I politely declined their generous offer. Besides, I think calisthenics will be more my style now. Weightlifting can be dangerous after all.
