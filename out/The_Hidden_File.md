Day 1 – The File

I still don’t know why I opened it.

The file just appeared in our system one morning, no sender, no description. It was only 4 KB, yet every time someone tried to open it, the system crashed. At first, we assumed it was a corrupted file or some kind of network interference.

Dr. Rivas, the head of tech, insisted on figuring it out. He was always the kind of person who had to see things through, no matter the risk. After hours of attempts, the file finally opened.

It contained nothing—just a black screen.

I remember Rivas frowning at it, clicking aimlessly. Then, for the briefest second, I thought I saw something shift in the blackness, like a shadow that shouldn’t have been there. The lights flickered. A whisper—too faint to make out—came from the speakers.

Rivas shut the laptop.

Three hours later, he was gone.

Security footage showed him staring at the screen, frozen in place. Then… nothing. One second he was there, the next, he wasn’t. No movement, no struggle—just gone.


Day 3 – The Deletions

I tried looking up Rivas in our personnel records. He wasn’t there.

No emails. No ID badge. No projects, no security footage before today. It was as if he had never existed.

I asked the team if they remembered him. They just gave me blank stares. Even people who had worked with him for years didn’t recognize the name.

Only Dr. Langley and I still remembered.

Langley, the file manager, reopened the black screen. This time, names appeared. Thousands of them. Staff members, past and present. Some names I recognized. Some I didn’t.

At the very bottom of the list was Rivas’s name.

Directly below it… Langley’s.

The screen flickered. The system crashed.

An hour later, Langley was gone.

I tried telling the others. They looked at me like I was crazy. By the next morning, I was the only one who even knew Langley had existed.

Day 7 – The Whispers

It started with whispers.

Faint at first, just at the edge of hearing. I ignored them. Stress, I told myself. Sleep deprivation. But then I started hearing them in places that shouldn’t have sound. The static of a powered-down monitor. A file that refused to delete. The empty space in a corrupted database entry.

They whispered my name.

Dr. Hamilton was the first to break. He locked himself in his office, scratching symbols into the walls. He kept muttering about the file. About something inside it. Something formless. Something waiting.

Before he took his own life, he left a note:

"It’s not a file. It’s an entrance. And something is stepping through."


Day 12 – The Breach

That was the day I realized it wasn’t just affecting us.

Our systems failed. Not just ours—the entire facility’s. Every server, every backup, wiped clean. Security doors unlocked on their own.

And then I saw it.

Not in the file. Not on a screen. It was in the hallway. A shadow with no source.

It didn’t move like a person. It shifted, flickered, like a corrupted video skipping frames. And I swear… I swear I saw faces in it. Faces I recognized.

Rivas. Langley. Hamilton.

They weren’t dead. They were inside it.


Day 21 – The Darkness

There’s no one left.

No records, no logs, no sign this place ever existed. It erased everything. The facility is silent. The lights don’t work anymore. Every screen is just the black file now.

I can hear them whispering behind me.

I don’t know if I’ll disappear like the others. Or if I’ll become part of it.

If anyone finds this… burn it. Do not open the file. Do not search for me.

If you see my name on the list… it’s already too late.
