We broke into a *Menchie’s Yogurt* because why not. 

The **infinite mall** never generated one [before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jglces/our_first_date_started_in_a_mall_we_havent_seen/)

It was Rav's idea to get everyone some fro-yo, and frankly, It was a good call. We barely got any healthy snacks because the mall preferred to generate options like *Pizza Hut* or *Panda Express.*

“Some fruit feels refreshing on the belly, huh?” 

Rav patted his stomach, and we all nodded in agreement. Sitting down at a *Menchie’s* was a nice reward after reaching the 30 mile mark. 

That’s right, thirty miles.

It's pretty impressive for exploring an endlessly generating mall for only a week. If it weren’t for the complete darkness, we probably could have been moving even faster.

We’re currently mapping the northeast sections, then sending our findings to groups B and C via our phones (who were exploring opposite sides of the mall). Our hope is for *someone,* *somewhere,* at *some point* to finally find an exit out of this fucking interminable, god-forsaken endless forever maze. 

But so far it just keeps going. And the further we go, the more details we spot. 

Like in the decoration.

“Do you notice the decor getting a little worse the further we go?” Rav gulped a big spoonful of yogurt.

“What do you mean?”

“I mean that *Starbucks* across from us doesn’t even have the usual mermaid logo. Look.”

I used my flashlight to glance across the dark food court. Rav was right. The logo was missing. And so was the ‘ucks’. It just said *Starbs.*

“Hmmmm,” Clayton exhaled loudly from his vape, making it clear to the rest of us that he was thinking. “It’s like the mall’s rendering objects with more mistakes the further we go. The more information created, the noisier it gets.”

Clayton, Rav, Professor Ed and I were all from the same local University. Except the three of them all pretty high level mathematicians with varying levels of degrees… whereas I was in first year philosophy.

“That probably explains it, yeah.” Rav agreed. “The mall’s generation becomes fuzzier as we go further. Do you think that means it’ll make the food taste worse? Or perhaps in the case of *Pizza Hut…* better?”

I laughed. I couldn’t help myself. Rav had a knack for keeping things light, and I gave his left hand a squeeze.

We were still technically dating.

Rav was the one who invited me on a date here in the first place (back when the mall was still normal), and even though it's been seven days of trying to survive in a very \*un-\*normal mall, I still considered Rav my boyfriend.

He squeezed my hand back.

“Depending on how Mall-Dimension interprets Shannon Entropy,” Clayton said, exhaling more vape smoke, “I believe the food is going to start tasting worse and worse. Just look at what I found here.”

He lifted a jar of nuts he found at *Menchie’s.* Almonds.

He turned the jar and pointed at one almond that appeared to be totally stuck, *halfway between the glass of the jar.* Like a log poking through ice.

“I posit that this dimension’s perpetual ability to ‘generate mall aesthetic’ will get sloppier. And I predict that our food is going to be more and more blended with surrounding matter.”

I checked the blueberry tub I was eating from a second ago. It thankfully appeared normal.

Rav glanced at his tub of strawberries and found something strange. A white strawberry made of *plastic.*  

“Huh,” Rav said. “So this could mean the further we travel, the more food’s going to mix with nearby material…  and become less edible?”

“Interesting, interesting.” Prof Ed always found ideas he liked *interesting.* “It could also mean the surrounding environment will become less, and less *stable* too… Which means maybe the mall will start showing its cracks—which could lead us to an exit out of this Escher World.”

**Escher World**. **Mall-Dimension.** We all had different names.

I just called it **infinite mall.** 

“Well, I guess we should start logging suspicious tastes in food.” Rav eyed his bowl carefully as he finished his meal. “Metal and plaster usually doesn’t sit too well in the ol’ belly.”

\*\*\*

When we sent our selfies to Groups B and C, there was much jealousy in the group chat about finding fresh fruit. It was a rarer commodity than expected. 

In fact, I packed some of the whole oranges and lemons into my bags, because some tingle in my gut reminded me that “scurvy” was a thing. A disease formerly exclusive to 17th century sailors could actually become a concern in this forever mall.

Weird.

We travelled in our usual close, four-person formation of flashlights, illuminating not only our front, but both our sides. Prof Ed brought up the rear with the iPad, and slowly sketched out the route for posterity.

Our exploration after lunch took us by *Old Navy, Gap, Zara* and *H&M.*

I hated clothing shops.

I did my best to avoid looking at the mannequins in the windows—who all stared with faceless intensity. It was something about the uncanniness of their human shape that always creeped me out.

*H&M* had the creepiest mannequins near the end. There were these black, shroud-like dresses on display that made the last couple of figures look like straight up *grim reapers.*

Thankfully, the fashion strip was short and spit us out into a wide, octagonal plaza. Our flashlights picked up benches, indoor ficus trees, and we heard the gentle streaming of water.

Another mall fountain.

*Great place to fill up our water,* I thought.

I was halfway through getting my canteen out when Rav’s flashlight swirled around something that was standing by a ficus.

“Hey! Over there! What’s that!” 

Our lights converged on the still shape and revealed a person. And not just any person.

Indrek.

Ice shot down my back. Instinctively, I made sure my swiss army knife was in my right pocket.

Indrek was the cause of all this.

He was keynote speaker of the math convention held at the center of this mall. It was his twisted, balding head that solved Gödel’s unprovable theorem in front of all our eyes… and trapped us inside this infinite mess.

“Enjoying our mall’s latest self-expression?” The bald professor gestured to the fountain’s statue between us. “Always impressive to find new sculptures, no?”

Rav pulled out his *Cabela’s* hunting knife, and pointed it right at Indrek. “What are you doing here? Are there more of you?”

Indrek lifted his palms up, and walked closer. “There are *always* more of me. But this time they’re all very far away I assure you. I come in peace.”

We all swapped furrowed glances. 

*He comes in peace?* 

None of us were buying it.

“If by peace, you mean you’d like to show us a way out,” Rav motioned to the next hallway, “then please lead the way.” 

The old man's misty, grey-blue eyes widened. “A way out? Yes. That is *exactly* what I am offering. Master Pythagoras would like you all to see him. He has access to the true exit. A return to life outside.”

My stomach twisted at the word ‘Pythagoras’. The last glimpse I got of the ancient mathematician was when he was riding a palanquin, *draining someone’s mind essence.* 

“No, Indrek.” Rav said. “We don’t want anything to do with your ‘master’.”

“With all due respect.” Clayton cautiously vaped. “You wrote an equation that shifted us into this Mall-Dimension. You must have the counter-equation to get us out.”

Indrek laughed. 

“It's a lot easier to drop inside a maze—than to find your way out.” He hung his fingers outside the pockets of his old tweed jacket. “I’m afraid there is no *counter-equation.* Only Master has the exit formula. Only Master can let you out.”

Rav grit his teeth,, “we’re not going *anywhere* near your fucking ‘*Master’.*”

Indrek took another step closer and rested his foot on the fountain's perimeter. “You all mustn’t be so afraid, Master has long been satiated now, he has drunk enough minds. He *will* offer you an exit.”

“And what if we don't believe you?”  Clayton asked.

Indrek chuckled again. “Well then I suppose you can keep wandering these halls for all eternity. The algorithm I sequenced is truly infinite. There is no way out.”

I didn't like the smug look on Indrek’s face. 

For seven days we’ve been trapped in this mall. Our families in the real world have been worried sick. We’re missing lectures, classes, birthdays, day-jobs… We all just wanted to GTFO.

“You have no right to trap us here!” I yelled, standing just ahead of Rav. 

Rav channelled my energy and approached even closer with his hunting knife. 

Indrek didn’t like this. 

Our visitor backed away, slowly pulling out a cue card and pen. “Now, now... No need for hysterics…” 

With small, deft movements he scribbled something on the paper card. Suddenly there came a reflection of Indrek. As if a mirror was summoned by his left side.

Only it wasn’t a mirror. 

It was another Indrek. 

A living copy.

“Let’s stop for a second.” Both Indreks smiled. “Let’s have a discussion here peacefully.”

We all stared at the duplicates.

In unison, both Indreks pulled out another set of cue cards and pens. The second Indrek spoke. “Does our discussion require a larger group in attendance?”

*Fuck,* I thought. *Was he just going to multiply himself into a horde?* 

Before I could vocalize the concern, there came a gunshot.

A bloody hole appeared in the second Indrek. The duplicate clutched his chest, and then collapsed. 

The remaining Estonian stared in shock. And before he could react—two more shots rang out.

I backed away and shielded my face, watching Clayton come out with a revolver, pointing at the two crumpled Indreks.

They both lay lifeless on the floor.

Smoke drifted from the barrel. The gunshot reverberated across the mall. It felt like a whole minute passed before anyone spoke.

“Clayton… ?” Rav stared at the weapon with surprise.

Clayton put the safety back on and placed the gun inside his vest pocket. “What? we're just supposed to stand and watch him multiply? So he can outnumber us?”

We had agreed on *no guns* several days ago. It was meant to be a show of solidarity and safety. 

Clayton shrugged. “We were at a *Cabela's*. I grabbed a gun.”

Slowly, Rav turned to Prof Ed and myself. “Did… anyone else grab a firearm?”

No one said anything. Rav sighed.

“I know we voted as a group or whatever,” Clayton sucked on his vape again. “But my dad used to take me to the range. I *know* how to use guns.”

Rav stared at the dead duplicates. None of us knew what to say.

“When we link up with the other groups,” Clayton exhaled. “We can vote again or whatever. As far as I’m concerned, I just saved our lives.”

I took a step toward the dead Estonian professors on the floor. The blood was pooling around their heads.  *If both of them were copies, did it mean they were never truly ‘alive’ in the first place?*

Professor Ed ambled through the awkward silence and fished the cue cards from both of the clones’ dead hands. 

“Interesting, interesting. Look at what we have here.”

It was our first time getting a hold of *any* of the math-work by Indrek. I could see a glimmer of hope suddenly arise in Rav, in Clayton, and especially Prof Ed. We were all thinking the same thing. 

“Could we use it to work out the escape formula?”

Professor Ed held the cards close to his eyes. “Or will it *duplicate* us?”

“Or will it… what?” 

“Well the equations Indrek wrote here were for duplication, right?” Ed held out the cue cards for us all to see. 

The equations looked smudged, but mostly visible

∀x(Ex↔(x=β))

“I think we should be very careful with what we write on those cards,” Rav said. “In fact. We should take photos and send them to B and C. So we could all study them.”

\*\*\*

For the next little while, we decompressed and chilled (I certainly needed to). The three mathies crowded the cards and considered all options. I stood nearby, scanning the dark edges of the mall with my flashlight, keeping watch.

“So if we are the co-factors in the equation,” Clayton waggled one of the cue cards high,  “we can change this 1 into a 4, and the result will account for all *four* of us. Let me show you.”

Rav pulled the card away before Clay could start writing. “Hold on, hold on.”

“What?”

“I just… I think we should slow down before we write anything. I think there are other answers to write.”

Clayton firmly grabbed the card back. “It’s Indrek’s math that got us stuck in here, and It's going to be *Indrek’s math* that gets us out. We’re going to have to try multiple answers. Let’s just get the first guess out of the way.”

“First *guess*?”

“You know what I mean. The first *valid solution* that I stand by. They are all *guesses* in a sense.”

Professor Ed tapped Rav’s shoulder. “We’ve just spent the last week taking showers with restaurant sinks. I think we can afford to try writing one answer and see what happens.”

I cleared my throat. “But Clayton … do you *actually* have a solution for the math?” 

Clayton gave me a patronizing look. “Yes. I can make epsilon equate to a specific value. I have an answer that will work.”

“But there’s still other ways to interpret the work.” Rav said. “That could still be wrong.”

“Listen, we can hold an entire congressional caucus and vote on an answer.” Clayton waved the cue card back and forth. “Or we could just write an answer that gets us the fuck out of here.” 

Prof Ed clapped. “Yes, let’s try something that could get us out.” 

Rav turned to me for support. 

I could tell both Clayton and Ed didn’t really care what I thought—even though I preferred Rav’s approach. But I’d be lying if I didn’t admit there was a large part of me screaming: *let’s just try something to get out!*

“We should write at least one answer,” I said. “To see what happens.”

Rav looked disappointed.

Clayton grabbed a pen. “Majority rules. Let’s go.”

He went over to use a bench as a writing surface. Rav and Ed rushed over and joined him, whispering suggestions as he began to write. I could only watch as their backs hunched and blocked my view. I was fulfilling my role as the math-dyslexic philosophy student standing in the back.

“Claudia, You should come over here,” Rav waved. “ If we do create a portal, or exit, or whatever happens, you should be close by so it affects you too.”

*And that’s why we were dating.*

I came over and put a hand on his shoulder.

We watched as Clayton lowered his pen one more time to write a big letter…

**E**

“ And the answer is… epsilon!”

The cue card glowed very bright for a half-second. 

We all felt it. 

A little reverberation in the air

“So did that… Do anything?”

We kept quiet. And looked around with our flashlights… Nothing.

The mall was unnaturally quiet without our sounds. Just a faint buzzing, like the sound of distant fluorescents somewhere. 

And then, like a bat out of hell—a **scream.**

Loud. 

Pained.

Clayton’ s self-righteous posture deflated, and even Rav looked startled, eyes stretching wide.

“Is that one of ours?… Is someone hurt?”  Professor Ed investigated his iPad quickly, scanning our chats with Group B and C. 

Another scream.

Louder this time.

It was coming toward us.

We formed a tight huddle, throwing our light in every direction of the sound.

There came this bizarre rhythm of slapping footsteps.

*Splick* — *splick splick* — *splick splick splick!*

“Hello?” Rav aimed his light at the center of the fashion hall. 

The mannequins stared back as if they held a secret. *H&M’s* grim reapers looked more menacing than ever.

“Is anyone there?”

*Splick splick splick!*

Then, from behind a trash can. We saw it.

A crawling thing.

A fast moving, sweating mass, wrapped in a familiar brown tweed jacket.

It was Indrek. Or rather. Half of Indrek. Or rather… *Two halves of Indrek?*

They were connected together at the waist. A bald head on each opposite side, commanding a pair of bleeding, scampering arms.

We all retreated with our backs towards the fountain, horrified by this freak of nature.

“Jesus Christ.”

“What the fuck.”

The malformed thing didn’t seem to like our reaction. Both its heads turned to our direction and screamed frenzied, animalistic screams.

Clayton drew his gun. The monster lunged for his legs.

*BLAM! BLAM!* 

I turned away to cover my ears. When I looked back, I could see Clayton clicking his pistol over and over. The four armed creature pinned him down. 

One of the Indrek heads clamped down on Clay’s throat

“AUGH!!!”

Rav swooped in with his hunting knife, but the other Indrek half was alert—it swiped defensively  and hissed at Rav’s advances.

It was like fighting a rabid dog on both ends.

We couldn’t move in to save Clayton without dealing with the hissing other half. So I unzipped my backpack, looking for projectiles. 

I emptied out a pile of “anti-scurvy” oranges.

“Quick!” I yelled, and Prof Ed got the idea.

We armed ourselves and started hucking the fruits.

The defensive Indrek half shielded its face from our tosses. Rav moved in and hacked.

Within two swipes, the Indrek was mortally wounded. Its neck started bleeding profusely. When the other half of the creature turned to face us, Rav wasn’t messing around. He kept stabbing

The wanton gore was brutal. The monster fought back and clawed, but Rav just grit his teeth.

Very soon we ran out of oranges. 

The double-Indrek was dead. 

Rav kept stabbing into the lifeless creature until he finally took a step back and focused on his breathing. He looked totally overwhelmed with adrenaline.

Prof Ed ran over and pulled the thoroughly dead thing off of Clayton, checking for vital signs of the young university student.

“Christ on a cross…” Ed said.

Clayton’s throat had been totally *shredded.* You could practically see the neck vertebrae beyond the throat. It was Imagery even to this day I could never wipe from my brain.

“Oh boy.” Professor Ed tugged at his goatee reflexively. He looked even more devastated than Rav. “…Oh no…Oh Clayton …. Oh no…”

\*\*\*

We washed our blood-stained faces and hands in the fountain.

Three marble cherubs continually spat out the water and cleansed us of the ample violence surrounding the plaza. There were now two dead clone Indreks, one dead Clayton, and one dead double-Indrek freak circling the marble pool.

We waited to see if something else would come screaming towards us, some other malformed unholy from the depths. But it appeared Clayton’s math guess had only formed one monster.

After ten minutes of silence, we finished up our washing. 

Rav snagged a couple replacement pants and shirts from the nearby *H&M,* while Ed and I procured several large duvet covers. We had not anticipated a sudden death among our ranks, and none of us were quite sure how to go about it.

We wrapped up Clayton’s body in three sets of covers, then bound the whole thing with rope and duct tape.

There was no way we could carry Clayton for very long, and our splinter groups were almost sixty miles in the opposite direction—so we weren’t about to reconvene for a funeral either. 

So we did the next most sensible thing.

\*\*\*

We carried Clayton’s remains into the back of a *Sleep Country*, where he was laid down on a king-size mattress. There was even an angel figure carved into the headboard.

As his former instructor, Professor Ed gave a small eulogy.

“Clayton, I only knew you for two terms. Your first essays showed me lots of potential, and your most recent ones conveyed a strong understanding of classical physics. You had a full life ahead of you. And though you may have been young, naive and maybe stubborn—you were also brave. Let us not waste your bravery. Let’s keep moving. We will honor you by finding our own way freedom from this … god-forsaken mall. Amen.”

Probably because he knew Clayton pretty well, Ed wanted to be alone for a while and went to lie on a distant mattress.

I felt the same vibe.

My heart was in my throat, vibrating from all the leftover panic.  Rav and I laid on a queen size mattress and held each other for a small eternity.

“Are we going to die here?” I eventually asked.

Rav held his breath. The delay in his response was all I needed to hear.

“No. We'll keep going. We’ll find a way out, don’t worry.”

“Be honest with me though. Do you really think there is a way out?”

Again. That delay in his response.

“I think now that we’ve sent the formula we found to groups B and C… someone will figure it out. We will find the exit equation one way or another.”

I gave his arm a squeeze.

“And it's like Professor Ed says. The further we travel, the less stable the environment will become… So we’re going to find *some* kind of crack. There will be an escape.”

I didn’t like the sound of the **infinite mall** becoming less stable, but if it meant that we could find a way out, I’d have to accept it.

“You’re really good at clinging to the bright side.” I said.

“I am?” He seemed genuinely surprised.

“Yeah. It helps.”

“Well, between being stupidly optimistic versus brutally realistic. I’d rather edge on being stupid.”

“You’re the right amount of stupid then.”

He managed to laugh. “Thank god. I thought I was the wrong amount.”

I held tighter and gave his ear a kiss. 

We lay still for a time. I closed my eyes and tried to pretend I was just laying on my dorm bed. That I would wake up and see the university outside my window.

\*\*\*

Because Prof. Ed was feeling morose, I took over the iPad duties. 

I sent a full report to Groups B and C, detailing the account with the Indreks, and Clayton's death.

I included my own amateur drawing of the [double-Indrek](https://imgur.com/a/Sj7OibI), so they could actually grasp what we were dealing with. We all decided to be very careful when writing the next answer to Indrek’s equation.

The chat bounced ideas back and forth, but no one would write anything until everyone felt *very* convinced by a proposed new solution. 

They even started to swap little mini academic theses about how the physics in this mall world worked. It would have been cute if it wasn't so dire.

Our full team of survivors was on high alert now. Everyone was told to stock up.

Although we left Clayton lying on that bed with his own backpack of supplies, the one thing we did bring with us was his revolver. 

A six barrel Smith and Wesson. Twenty four bullets left. 

It would have to do for now, until we find the next hunting store.

None of us considered the **infinite mall** safe and empty [anymore.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EclosionK2/comments/1g0837r/welcome/)
