Last summer, my family went on a trip to Acadia National Park in Maine. On our last night in the area, my step-dad and I decided to go try to get some photos of the stars. Something happened out there. I can't make sense of it. 

From what I can remember, the night had been warm with a sappy heat that came down from the mountain and crawled through the cabin doorframe, the canopy of spruce, cedar, and hemlock holding back what little it could. A shrill, desolate darkness spread like nightshade over the setting July sun, a warning. With my mom and my sisters sound asleep, the three of them red with exhaustion after the steep climb up and the subsequent climb down from Cadillac Mountain, only my step-dad, Tom, and I were left awake, camera shutters fixating on different edges of the shore just down the gravel path of the KOA. The park was just across the western bay from the park, the endless expanse of the wooded peninsula a phantom within the fog that had swept over the water, and our cameras could hardly focus on the shoreline, long gone dark from the headlights on the park loop. Sat alongside the window, Tom peeked through the blinds, fidgeting with a wide-aperture lens. “I bet we could catch some great shots of the stars tonight. City has a mandate not allowing streetlights after dark- light pollution and the animals or something,” he mumbled. 

“You think?” I wondered, peering back to their bedroom where Mom had long since begun snoring, the prospect sifting in my thoughts. My legs were beaten from the hike; the long day still stung my neck, where the camera strap striped me in a pattern of red and ivory. I estimated the idea in my head. I was not quite tired but unsure, without an aperture lens of my own, if it would do me any good to try. Then again, I considered when I would be in Maine again. “Alright,” I nodded, “let’s do it.”

With careful steps, Tom lifted the car keys from the round dining table, the surface littered with postcards, souvenirs, and a pair of stuffed otters that the girls had demanded and eventually forgotten about, while I filled my backpack with my camera and flashlight. We both knew the mosquitoes would be in a united garrison that night. Before we slipped out into the darkness, we buckled our jeans. We rolled down our sleeves before leaving without another word. Outside, the belligerent heat of the day was already waning in excess, a serene Atlantic breeze instead rustling the dreary trees and polyester tents that were scattered throughout the park. The sleepy little coastal site had already put out its fires, and only the indistinct muttering of sleepless campers polluted the air outside the whistle of the night. As I tested whether the camera could focus on a thing in this blackness, Tom guardedly locked the sleeping half of our family snugly and soundly in the paltry cabin. Parked just next to the short staircase from the porch, the rental minivan softly sputtered awake in a groan. Too late to turn back now. 

As we turned onto the back road from the campsite that would take us straight to the park loop entrance, the only light beyond our headlights was the dash, the time illuminated in a pale lime color at half past nine. “Let’s keep the cabin keys in the car. Your mother will lose her mind if we lose these.”

“That’ll or we’ll be locked out until we wake her up to let us in.” I chuckled, my eyes scanning ahead to the road, revealing itself out of the void as we sped down towards the park. 

Up ahead, Tom spotted the long, rotted, and vacant derelict barn in a rare empty field devoid of towering forest that we’d passed after dinner in town that evening. “There’s that barn. So eerie at night. We should also get some shots of you in there later, with our red lights.” He pointed, the barn suddenly in and lost to the black again before I could even focus on it. 

“Yeah. Let’s absolutely hang out in the creepy barn,” I huffed, “I have never seen this kind of darkness before.”

“Makes you appreciate streetlights, huh?” Tom chuckled, focused ahead on the road. 

From the passenger seat, the edge of the woods that swallowed up either side of us was less of a certainty than an assertion of instinct and memory, and it was an uneasy one. The only thing I could make out between the passing trees was my reflection. Just us and the dark. “Yeah.”

There was a complete absence of life as we rolled through the open park gates; there were no parked cars along the curb or sudden hikers on the road for us to jump at. Just nothing, us, the road, a son, a father, and a peninsula possessed by the blanket of night. Up ahead, the darkness was absorbed into the amorphous mist that had settled over the New England hardwoods, the car slowing to a crawl at thirty miles an hour, for at this point, it was simply too dark to drive any faster safely. Any animal, whether a family of campers or starving coyotes, would not need to lurch in front of the car to catch us off guard; we could hardly see a thing. 

“Where to first?” I pulled the map up on my phone, the blue flash from its screen blinding me as my eyes adjusted slowly to the natural light. 

“Any parking lots nearby? Probably our best bet to get a good clearing.”

“Yeah. Yeah, this one should be in about a mile or so here.”

As the drive progressed, the familiarity of the park we had spent the last three days exploring and photographing became an increasingly distant memory, some abstract idea of a place it did not feel like we were in anymore. Under the dim lamp of the moon, the valleys and mountains that made up the peninsula were a stranger. One that, as I saw less and less of civilization just a few miles out, I was so sure was welcoming us with open arms. No longer were we the nuclear family braving the highly regulated, densely populated trails on a summer vacation. Now, we were just two strangers, *trespassers*, entering the arms and jaws of the wild. We were out past curfew, and the forest knew. 

“Here’ll do,” Tom said, driving the gear into the park and pulling the keys out, dropping the spool of Swiss army knives he had attached and keys far from their locks beside the cabin keys—10 pm. 

On the floor beside my shoes, the soles of which were torn from use, a park pamphlet lay dirty and ripped. *Experience through Knowledge* adorned the brochure. Some use it was, I had thought, my sisters, in all their adventures and potential knowledge, could hardly make it past the first mile before all knowledge was left behind for the comfort of air conditioning. They were young; I could hardly blame them for not sharing my recent obsession with the outdoors that had brought us here. Little legs and all that. Tom had already begun preparing his camera, turning the lens into place, unzipping his camera bag that had drifted aimlessly in the backseat during the drive through the winding park loop road. His bald head was a spotlight from the interior lights, drowning out the outside in its entirety. All that could be seen from inside the car were two photographers prepared to capture the Milky Way if the clouds held up. “Got your light?” He motioned to my bag, and I nodded. 

“Yeah,” I reached down into my backpack, the assortment of crinkled road trip snacks murmuring from the caverns of the canvas bag, blinding myself as I pulled out the light already lit. Before I could even unclip my seatbelt, Tom poured out of the driver’s seat, his headlamp fluttering about in manic darts. He could hardly contain his excitement to be out here, no kids begging to return to the car, just his son along for the ride, someone who learned to love photography from him. He got to work immediately, and it was undoubtedly a particular process; the framing and exposure had to be right to pick up the number of stars that even our own eyes couldn’t see. 

How they couldn’t see all of it, I’ll never know. Above our heads was a galaxy, a great band stretching in a thunderbolt of orange and purple, all the light we would need. The luster of life, of the universe, infinite. It was God, or as close as I had come to know it. Standing in an empty parking lot, the ocean just a few hundred feet beneath us, down a rocky cliffside of shrubs and dirt, I looked up and saw only a torch- a lightning bolt candle in the dark resting on the window into our world. It was the sight that made you understand what it all must be for, that surely, before we had a word for a star, why we looked up. Tom whooped and hollered, his body flat against the concrete ground beneath us, rolling onto his back to watch as the camera captured everything we couldn’t pick out in the boundless sea of *everything,* and eventually, I did too, laying back to the ground, camera off but rapt entirely by what I’d never seen. He could capture it as he pleased. I could not help but marvel. To wonder. Around us, dogday cicadas whistled between the howling wind to the world above the world, the ceaseless glory of the whole shooting match. Then, the cicadas stopped. 

It had taken me a moment to notice the sudden end of the familiar soundscape of a midsummer night, but when I did, I pulled away from the universe and remembered the forest. The parking lot, unnecessarily large as it was, was bordered by the inevitable tree line of untouched fauna and Greenwood, and the cicadas that resided there had gone silent all at once. I could not help but stare; my flashlight pointed towards it, a pool of turbid nothing, but there was something out there. It was a National Park, after all; anything could be watching, confused or annoyed at the humans who disturbed their sleep. Yet, as the wind grew sharp and blaring, I could not take my eyes away from the edge. I wasn’t scared, no. I wasn’t my sisters. I had outgrown a fear of the dark. There was celestial light above me, the superhero nightlight of the galaxy, and yet, there it was- the roaring silence of watching, ears focused, waiting for something to prove me wrong. A twig snapped, and I sat up instantly, eyes fixed on the giant tree trunks and what little I could make of the spaces between them. Tom either hadn’t noticed or cared as he had begun cycling through the photos he had shot, calling me over to his part of the parking lot. I was glad to take my mind off it, whatever had shaken me, and as my ears listened intently for another, a confirmation of the rising anxiety in my chest, I began to feel silly. There's nothing out here but deer and foxes. My eyes glazed over at the sight of the countless stars, back to where the parking lot ended, as a siren whispered imperceptibly just for me. In its sobbing, the wind begged us to leave, and I could feel my unease rise. 

“Want to move on to the next place?”

“What, Nick? Yeah, just a sec. Want to try one more with one of the red lights.”

“Ok,” I said, and the dark and I contested, daring each other to look away.

Next on Tom’s list was Thunder Hole, a great rock inlet that spewed sea foam with an awful, thunderous crash, so fitting the name. Each powerful blow into the rock from the tireless Atlantic rang out before we could even see it, the car humming between the immense sound of the wind and the waves. Tom parked the car beside the road, with no parking lot to leave the minivan. He hopped out happily, jimmied open the sliding back door, and switched lenses, carefully clicking the lens into place and dropping the lens cap back into his black camera bag—10:30 pm. 

“Wonder what we can get from the rocks.” He tossed the camera tactfully over his shoulder, clicking his light back on, while I pulled my bag back onto my arm. I’d heard him but couldn’t break my contest with it. Whatever it was about these woods that unnerved me. I nodded and clicked on my flashlight, scanning the peripheries of the forest while the rocky shore pounded against the deep chasm of swirling tide. It was all at once beautiful and troubling—the sullenness of the spruce, the complete absence of humanity in the manmade light. Tom went down the slick granite steps and vaulted over the iron handrail to lay again on the rocks to look up. There I was, listening to the screech of the wind and the hammer of the cove, frozen in place, not in definable fear but a mounting curiosity. Were we being toyed with by some bored campers? No, I had thought that wouldn’t make sense. The drive from the parking lot to Thunder Hole was ten minutes on the park loop, the single accessible road, and no other cars were in sight. Tom again called me for help, the wind rattling the camera, and I decided to push the thought of it entirely out of my mind. I wasn't here for the woods tonight; I was here for the stars. 

Down the steps of Thunder Hole, the ocean was a punching drum, and I looked out to the horizon, trying to capture my shots. Leaning against the safety rail, Tom decided to ignore it. Just down the coastline, north of us, though entirely shrouded, was Cobble Beach, where earlier that day, we’d seen a couple get married along the rocks, and the day before, I was sure a bat or owl had swooped down and attacked my head when we watched the sunset, though now I was embarrassingly confident it was my backpack hitting me in the head when I bent down to toy with a long strand of emerald seaweed that was lying against the muddy sand. It was hard to contrast the two, the root of my discomfort and the park under the sanctity of sunlight. So, I did my best to ignore it by taking photos of the ocean with my camera, using a long aperture and positioning the camera body between the holes in the grated post. Steadiness was essential: any movement would ruin the intake, leaving it a grainy, indiscernible mess. Tom had years of experience with me, and while I was earnestly catching up, using his photos as free lessons in composition, graduating from aligning the focus in the center of the grid to the holy rule of thirds. The focus needed to get anything at all took my mind off the noise and the silence of the parking lot, and soon enough, I had forgotten about it entirely and chalked it up to lingering adolescent fears. Above us, rain clouds were fast approaching and beginning to obscure the only natural illumination save the waning crescent. 

“Shit. Clouds are coming in quick. Want to try the road up to Cadillac? The top will probably be closed off, but we can beat them with the elevation.” Tom stood up, wiping the wetness of his back, the sea foam soaking the back of his body. 

Lowering my camera, I turned my flashlight towards him, standing above me on the jagged rocks, and nodded, “Let’s do it.”

As Tom leaped back to the slicked platform, he hurriedly skipped back up the main road, the cove some fifty feet downhill from where the van parked, married by a steep staircase. I began following him when my foot squished against something. At my feet were dozens of squirming earwigs, attracted to the moist ground and sending me flooring up the stairs. If there was one part of nature that I never made peace with in nineteen years, it was bugs. When I returned to the car, Tom had already restarted the engine, the sliding door closed again, and headlights showing the path ahead— the same winding road we’d been on for nearly an hour—the ticket in and out. Park Loop Road. 

We drove for another fifteen or so minutes, the analog hue of the dash and warm headlights, the time passing slowly as we reached the road up the mountain we had visited the day before. When we reached the top of the hill, the curving path was blocked off by rusting yellow gates. The clouds had long caught up, and I stayed in the van while Tom tried to catch what we could. Defeated, he returned to the back of the truck and slid the door open, prepared to call it a night. The clips of his bag snapped as he unwound the lens from his camera when he paused. 

“What’s up?” I craned my neck, watching him sift through his bag, his brow furrowing with each swipe. 

“My lens cap. Did I take it out of the bag at the parking lot?”

“No, no, I remember you dropping it in. Why? Is it not there?”

“No. Did I drop it here? I don’t remember ever taking it out.”

As we both began to scan the road and grass, what was strange to us was not so much that it had been misplaced; things happened, but that it was nowhere in sight. The car was picked clean; it was a rental and had no place to hide that we could have missed, nowhere to hide. It couldn’t have just walked off, not when we both remembered leaving it exactly where we always had; the small, important things were not something we just haphazardly left strewn about. They protected our lenses. It was in the name. But, as we poured over every inch of the car and the surrounding area, it was simply not there. Gone. 

“Let’s recheck the parking lot. Maybe it fell out?”

And so we did. We drove back around the park, speculating when or how it could have vanished until we looped around to the parking lot. The puddle in the concrete was still visible from the air conditioning, so little time had passed since we were first there that the cicadas were still silent. Without another word, we traced each step of our short time there, scrutinizing each pebble and rock that made up the lot. Not a cap in sight. At this point, Tom was becoming increasingly agitated and stupefied, pacing back and forth from the treelike to the van while I stood still, darting the flashlight to and from where we’d been. Tom may not have noticed in his focus, but I couldn’t help but remember the stillness of the woods and stopped. Whatever had hushed the cicadas had done so now with the wind. In our mumbling, only our echoes now remained. 

“Come on. It has to be at the hole. I must have dropped it.”

Again, we mounted up and tore down the road, my thoughts not on the lens cap but on the feeling I got when I stood in that parking lot, looking out to the forest. Alone. Small. Not alone. Watched and toyed with. The words jumbled around as we approached Thunder Hole again. It was already 11 pm, and the search continued in an excruciating silence, save the call and response of “Anything?” and “No.” I stuck to the edge of the forest that sat against the road, thinking it must be near the car, the same puddle from the air conditioning still wet from our last round through here. 

“Nick.”

It had come from behind me, and I turned back, expecting Tom to have the cap in his hands, laughing to put this whole debacle to rest. But, as I turned to the staircase where Tom should have been, there was nothing. No one. My heart sank. I quickly flung my head and flashlight to either side of me, the strangling darkness filling in around me as I spun in circles, scanning for what had said my name, only tearing through the darkness to find more nothing, more absence, more of not Tom, dread filling into my lungs as I began to stumble around the road, the wind picking up again, screaming, howling out like a shrieking fox, the uncanny cry piercing my ears, the trees violently swaying from the sudden downburst. I ran for the stairs, to where I knew Tom had been, where he must have called, tripping on the uneven steps, gripping the handrail. There, hands grabbed onto my arm, and I flung back, my balance gone as I crashed to the stairs hard on my back, pushing back whatever had caught me— 

“Nick. Nick, Jesus Christ, stop.”

I had been screaming. Tom pulled me up to my feet by my arm and flashed his light in my face, my eyes wild. 

“Nick. What the hell was that?”

“I—“What words could even describe the frenzy my name had sent me into? When my heart dialed back from its beating in my throat, I tried to laugh. “Sorry. I slipped.”

His eyes wide and unnerved, Tom shook his head and tried disregarding whatever he thought had come over me. “Ok. Well. I can’t find the cap. Let’s go home and try it in the morning.”

I could hardly contain my desire to leave, “Okay,” I stammered, nodding madly. Tom walked up the stairs without a second thought, and I followed close behind him, staring down at the earwigs on the steps, drowning in my paranoia. Tom settled into the driver’s seat at the van, and I hastily shut the passenger door. As we settled in to drive again, now in a blistering void of conversation, he reached down to where he’d repeatedly placed the car keys, only to stop again. 

“Do you have the cabin keys?”

My blood began to squirm. “What?”

“The cabin keys. Do you have them?”

“N-no. They’re…” I reached into the tray and felt nothing. They were gone. “They were right there. Why would I have…”

“Jesus Christ. Where the hell are they?” Tom had grown uneasy as well, his hands frantically feeling in the dim interior for the exact keys we’d placed in the car so we wouldn’t lose them. “Your mother’s going to kill me. You’re sure you didn’t take the keys by accident?”

“No. No, I wouldn’t. There would be no reason. Did you?”

“No. So where the hell is it?” He had grown angry. 

“I don’t know. Did we…” I couldn’t even guess. 

“It has to be at the road up the mountain. Maybe it fell out when we were looking for the cap.”

*No*. *Please*. *Please let us just leave and pay whatever fine we need to.* I wanted to scream it, but I couldn’t. The words, as hard as I was trying to force them out of my throat, were lodged in my beating chest. All I could do was stare. Please. The car lurched forward, and we vaulted down the road back towards the mountain. All the while, the forest squealed with the wind. 

My thoughts raced as he tore through the road, over and over and over again. First, the gate to the mountain, then the parking lot, then the cove again, and again, not daring to step out or listen to anything other than my heartbeat. I couldn’t bear the thought of what I might hear, what thing might call if I opened the car door, so I sat there, useless, staring out into the darkness, waiting for the trees to burst to life and swallow us whole. The Park Loop road became an agonizing spiral, each time as Tom frantically searched for the keys only to find nothing, trapped in a cycle of searching for a glimmering metal in the expanse of nothing. It was so dark. So empty. I wanted it to be over, to let whatever had happened, whatever we had disturbed, leave us be. The Forest, these woods, they were alive, and they were angry. Each loop drove us to a desperate merry-go-round that forced me outside the car to join the search effort. My feet froze to the ground as I saw only the trees, and I knew they were staring back. The long arms of the cedars were bending now, contorting in crackling laughter that paralyzed me at each place: the parking lot, the cove, the gate, the parking lot, the road, the cove, back and forth and over and over until Tom too was afraid, truly afraid, trying to call my mom but the service was too weak, too insignificant to the emptiness of the peninsula, the prison of it, the isolating life of its jaws devouring our minds as we circled aimlessly around back to the beginning- back to the voice- back to Thunder Hole. 

The car lurched to a thrashing stop as Tom opened the car door, both of our flashlights on him as he paced along the road, muttering to himself, before retaking the steps, the sweat on my head trickling into my eyes, the rain beginning rain down the frigid cold onto the earth. Alone again, I clung to the car's light, the park looking the same everywhere I turned, nothing but a winding, snakelike road and trees, oh god, the trees. They never ended. It was all trees and silence, and screaming. I wanted to cry. I am sure I had already, but maybe I was in my own loop— panting, crying, watching the tree line, waiting for something out in the dark, being driven mad so we would be easier to take, the energy lilted from our aching, frantic bodies so that we would be easier to be had when the peninsula had enough of its fun. Was any of this real? Was it all a dream? I wanted to wake up, back in that cabin, back in my lumpy pull-out couch bed, and never see this fucking park again. Something stirred in the woods again, the foliage crunching beneath it. I was frozen. Paralyzed. I want to go home. Please, I pleaded to the sky. I looked up, and the rain burned my eyes, but the light was gone. The universe had closed its window. We were alone. I closed my eyes and shook, clutching my camera tightly. It would do nothing. Sticks snapped, and I crawled out of my skin. It was getting closer, louder, but I couldn’t see. Tom had the lights. I did the only thing I could think of: I pulled the camera close to my chest, switched the dial on, and held tight to the trigger. A violent flash ripped across the woods like lightning, holding it down to be an endless stream of flickering white to blind it, force it back, and live. 

“Tom! Tom!” I cried out, trying to break through the storm’s wail, desperately trying to win back a chance to escape. 

From behind me, hard footsteps ran back up the stairs of the cove, matched with dragging, awful rustles of leaves from ahead of me, “Nick! What!? Oh— oh my god.” Both footsteps stopped. For a moment, I stood still, shivering from the cold terror. “Nick.”

“W-what?” I called out, unmoved, teeth clamoring between the water spilling into my mouth. 

Tom breathed heavily behind me and rested his arm on my shoulder. “Look.”

Slowly, I turned and opened my eyes. He motioned to the stairs, and with each slow, careful step, he led me to the base of the staircase. There, neatly sprawled out with its leather band, the keys rested against the base of the stairs in the center rock of the step. There was no reason to it. It just was. Tom looked at me and said nothing. 

“How…How many times did we walk up these stairs?”

I only stared. There was no explanation. It wasn’t there, and it was. Adorned in earwigs. 

Tom picked up the keys, and we broke to life, sprinting to the van, slamming it to life, and veering down the road. My hands shook in my lap as Tom screamed. “There’s no way. There’s no way. It wasn’t there, Nick. It wasn’t there.”

“I know. I know.”

The car slowed to the exit of the park loop, the entrance sign where it had welcomed us. We were freezing, panting, and utterly distraught. “When… When we were looking for the cap… at the cove… before I started screaming… did you… did you call my name?”

Tom stared ahead at the road for a moment before turning to face me, pale and gaunt. “No.”

It was nearly five in the morning when we returned to the campsite. We’d been in those woods for eight hours, running in circles. Back on the backroad, I began filing through the photos from the night, the serene pictures of the ocean, the stars as best I could capture them- then the trees. The photos I’d taken, nothing could be made out. There were hundreds of them. Had I taken that many? It had felt like a moment. But, in the hundreds of photos, the rain had started, stopped, and begun again. I didn’t remember the rain stopping. In each picture, there was nothing but the forest. And it. We never remembered passing the old barn on the way back. In the morning, we packed up and left, and we lied. Said we’d done all we could out here. Went to see family in Vermont. I never showed anyone the photos. I can’t forget it. Every night, I see the dark and what’s out there in the dark. I need to know. I need to know what happened. I need to know what I saw. I need to know what saw me. But every time I look at that photo, I see myself looking back. There is no God in that park, but there is something else. I need to know.
