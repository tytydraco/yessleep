I live alone in a quiet apartment building on the edge of town. Two floors, twelve units, and a laundry room that smells like mildew and regret. Nothing ever happens here. People keep to themselves. No one knocks unless something’s burning.

That’s why the first photo shook me.

I got home from work—late shift at a diner—and there it was, taped dead center on my door: a Polaroid photo of my door. My exact door. Same dent near the bottom, same old sticker from the previous tenant half-scraped off the peephole. It had clearly been taken from the hallway, just a few feet away.

No note. Just the photo.

Weird, right? Maybe a prank. I pulled it down and tossed it in the trash.

The next night, there was another.

Same size, same angle—but this time closer. The frame was tighter. It filled more of the photo. The peephole was larger, more defined.

I paused this time. Stared down the hallway. Nothing. Silent. My skin felt tight, like it was being stretched over my bones. I peeled the photo off the door and kept it. Slid it into a drawer. Just in case.

By the third night, the photo was just inches from the peephole—so close I could see the tiny chips in the brass. I hadn’t heard anything. No footsteps. No tape peeling. Nothing.

I asked my neighbors. One guy laughed. The older woman down the hall told me, “Maybe someone’s sweet on you.” No one had seen a thing.

I bought a cheap doorbell cam off Amazon. Set it up that afternoon.

The fourth night, it recorded everything—until 2:13 AM. Then it glitched. Froze. When it started again at 2:17 AM, the new Polaroid was already on the door.

Closer still.

At that point, I started double-locking my door. Pushed furniture in front of it, too. Left the lights on. Kept a hammer by the bed. Tried to stay awake, but sleep always crept in when I wasn’t looking.

On the seventh night, the photo was different.

It was taken inside my apartment.

It showed my living room, lamp on, blanket tossed over the armrest. I was in it—lying on the couch, eyes closed. It had been taken from behind me. Someone had been in my apartment while I slept.

I tore the place apart. Closets. Cabinets. Under the bed. Nothing. I called the police. They did a full walkthrough, found no signs of forced entry, no footprints, no prints at all.

They were polite, but you could see it in their faces—they didn’t believe me. One of them actually asked if I had a history of “stress-related hallucinations.”

I bought a crowbar that night. Big, heavy, black steel. Slept with it next to me on the couch. I kept every light in the apartment on.

I must’ve fallen asleep again.

Because when I opened my eyes the next morning, the crowbar was across my lap—and a Polaroid was resting on top of it.

This one was different.

It showed me, asleep on the couch, exactly as I had been moments earlier. Same clothes. Same blanket. Same crowbar.

But I wasn’t alone.

There was a man in the photo. Pale. Tall. Kneeling beside me, his face inches from mine. He was grinning—huge smile, all teeth—and his eyes were solid black, glossy like tar.

One hand was on my shoulder.

The other was wrapped around the crowbar.
