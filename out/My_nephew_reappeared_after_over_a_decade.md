As I write this, I'm nursing a glass of whiskey on my back porch. I don't know how to describe what I'm feeling right now. 

It's been eleven years since he disappeared. That kid has been my whole world since the day he was born. His mother hasn't been in his life since he was a baby, it's a long and frankly traumatic story so I won't tell it here. But to condense it, she's an addict and only god knows where, so I've been Ozzies legal guardian since he was 2. 

October 31st 2014. 

Ozzie told me he was going out with his friends for the night. I remember it so vividly, his face, with brown freckles like his mother, the mole on his neck that I have too. I've played that day in my mind a thousand times, every detail in fucking technicolor again and again just to have something to hold onto. His mop of curly dark hair, the red hockey jersey he was wearing, his jeans, his mother's ring he wore on a chain around his neck. All of it. 

I didn't know at the time, but him and his friends had actually planned to explore, party, and spend the night in the old abandoned house a few kilometres from town. That house always gave me the creeps, even after years of being a sheriff and having my fair share of unexplained experiences...it just makes my skin crawl. Even more so now...after all this. 

That damn house has a sorted history. In the 30s, the man who owned it threw a dinner party/family gathering. He then proceeded to chain the doors shut from the outside, climb back in through a window and slaughter everyone inside. People have told stories about it being haunted since I was a child back in the 70s, it's become a local legend. 

People took to calling it 'The Redfinch Manor' and it's been a long standing dare among teens to stay in there overnight. Most don't make it past midnight before they call it quits and hoof it back up the old road back to town. I can't even tell you how many times I've had to drive tipsy teenagers back home in my black and white off that road at absolutely ungodly hours. 

Ozzie grabbed his stuff and left around 7pm. I wished I had listened to the pit in my guts and grabbed him by the arm, and told him no. 

I was the one to report him missing around 4am when he hadn't come home. I didn't sleep that night despite having work at 6 in the damn morning. Maybe it was intuition, maybe it was god warning me or whatever the fuck is in that house calling out to me that it had taken my little boy. I was sitting on my couch, my phone in my lap with my thumb hovering over the button. 

I didn't call 9-1-1, I called my boss, Frank. he would've gotten there faster anyways. 

The line rung a few times before his groggy voice answered. 

"Jesus, Joey...this better be good. It's four fucking AM." 

I felt sick, like at a moments notice I was going to hurl onto the hardwood floors of my living room. 

"Frank get over here, please. It's an emergency...Ozzie- Fuck...Frank the kids gone." I said, my voice shaking more than I had ever heard it. It felt like my entire world was already crashing down even though a logical person would've been able to rationalize, come up with explanations. But for some reason I just knew. I knew. 

Frank didn't say much else, and he was in my kitchen with me in less than five minutes. I vaguely remember crying...at that time I hadn't cried in probably years, at least not like that. I was in fucking hysterics, pacing in my kitchen insisting that something terrible happened. 

We searched for hours, trekking through the woods, knocking on doors, looking everywhere. 

Something pulled me to that god forsaken house. Some otherworldly tether drew me there that night. Myself, a few deputies, Frank, and over a dozen volunteers walked the two or so clicks down the dirt road. The sky was turning from the dark black of night to a deep blue as daybreak approached. The manor came into view and I had this horrible, soul crushing dread. 

19 people swept that house with flashlights, and we didn't find a trace of the kids who went missing that night.

Those five kids got headstones a few years back. 

For three years I practically drowned myself in whiskey. I lost myself in grief. I had constant nightmares, dreams about all the horrible possibilities of what could've happened to my nephew. I'm better now, but I can't say I had healed. Ozzie was my only family at the time, though I've since gotten married. 

His grandfather and grandmother passed in 1991 and 2008 respectively. My sister has been way off the deep end and not in speaking terms with me since 2000 when I took custody of Ozzie. 

Fast forward to a week ago. 

December 7th, 2025. 

I'm still working as a sheriff, and admittedly still mourning on some level. I hadn't thought I'd ever fully get past losing him. 

I was on duty, sitting in my patrol car eating cheap fried fast food when my radio crackled to life. 

"10-32, this is Deputy Ross I need another unit at 762 County Road 144...and call forensics...." The abandoned house. That same abandoned house that the less rational part of my brain insisted had stolen Ozzie. 

I pressed the button and spoke. "10-04 this is Sheriff McKinney, ETA three minutes." I flicked on my lights and sirens and peeled out of that parking lot like a bat out of hell. 

They say death has a smell, something specific that can't be replicated and I can assure you that's very true. Like rotting meat sprayed with a sickly sweet perfume. It was faint, but I could still smell it despite the fact the freezing cold had practically frozen the body lying in the snow solid

I didn't need to look long to know the body belonged to one of those missing kids. 

I'll say that again...we found a body. A dead *body* not bones. 

After eleven. Fucking. Years. A body. 

How the hell wasn't this kid just scattered bones we would dig up after the spring thaw? And what the hell happened to him? Because he was cut up pretty bad. I'll save you the gory details...but it was bad. Really bad. Coroner said he'd been dead less a few days. December 2nd, she told me. Stabbed to death, poor kid bled out right there in the snowbank. 

That's crazy enough, finding someone freshly dead after over a decade...but the part that left us with even more questions was...

Why the hell did he still look 17? He should've been 28 so why the fuck did he still look the exact same as the missing persons posters we plastered all over the city a few clicks away? Christ he looked exactly like he did in the senior photos I helped his mom take. 

This was fucked. This was so fucked up. 

Did some sick bastard...preserve him? Keep him alive for 11 years and he just aged insanely well? What was this...?

I didn't sleep that night either. My wife Winona sat up with me. I had too many questions to relax enough to sleep. 

I was jittery, on edge. 

December 14th 2025

Tonight Winona was at her sister's house and I was alone. The place feels empty without her, almost eerie, like some strange isolationist dream where I was the only man left alive. 

Then, something changed. I felt that same feeling I did the night Ozzie disappeared, except in reverse. I can't describe it any other way, it was like I just had this sudden lump in my throat and I just...I don't know. Whatever the opposite of dread is. Like when you remember something you'd forgotten years ago, and the memory comes rushing back and suddenly everything makes sense and everything is right again. Don't get me wrong, it still freaked me out. 

But, I suppose the lord wasn't done with me because I thought I was having a stoke when I heard something I hadn't heard in over ten years echo from my back yard. 

"...hello? Uncle Joey?"

I didn't even think. Not a single thought went through my head as I jumped off my couch, across my kitchen and crashed out my back door still in my gym shorts and tank top despite the freezing temperature. 

There...in the foot deep snow...was my boy. There was Ozzie, still in the same clothes, slowly cutting through the shining powder snow. It felt like time stopped. His jersey was ripped, he was covered in blood and I'm still not sure how much of it was his. The lab hasn't called me back yet. 

Had I died in my sleep? Was this some kind of afterlife? It took a minute for my brain to turn back on and actually process what the hell I was seeing...

"Kiddo...?" I called out, my voice uneasy "I- Shit-" I cut myself off, bounding off my back porch and into the snow. Who knows how long he's been out in the cold, it's December in northern ontario for fucks sake. It was damn near 30 below it didn't matter how the hell he was alive all that mattered was that he didn't freeze to death. 

When I managed to haul Ozzie inside he just cried. I held him in my lap on my kitchen floor like he was a toddler again until Frank and an ambulance got here. My mind was elsewhere...what the hell was I supposed to do? What am I supposed to do now? That I'm in the middle of all this? 

The rest was kind of a blur, Frank called forensics again to go look at the house, test the blood on Ozzies clothes. I don't really remember much up until I got home about two hours ago. 

It's 4am. And I'm bundled in about five layers drinking a glass of the strongest whiskey I had in the house. 

He's still 17. 

Ozzie didn't have much to say other than frantically asking about his friends and the house, about...a man. One specific man. 

Remember how I mentioned the house's history? The massacre in the 30s?

Yeah. 

I don't really know what to make of it either. All I know, is that according to Ozzie...whatever the hell is in that house bleeds. 

And if it bleeds I can kill it. 

I've got a 12 gauge in my lap right now. It's taking every ounce of fucking restraint in me to not march over there with as many slugs as money can buy and as much gasoline as I can carry to burn that place in holy fire. 

If I do, I'll let you know if I can wipe that god forsaken place off the face of this planet. If not just for Ozzie, if at least for the other three kids whose bodies we haven't found yet. 

This is me signing off. I need put down the whiskey and go get some sleep before I do something stupid.
