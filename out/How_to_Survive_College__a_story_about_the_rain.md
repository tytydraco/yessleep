I was knee deep in a swamp.  The sky overhead was a flat matte gray, the sort of inoffensive color you paint the walls when you don’t know what else to do with a room.  It was raining, the water neither hot nor cold, but the exact temperature to be unnoticeable against my skin.  There were high points of ground, swells in the terrain where the water thinned and I could see gray grass underneath the surface of the water.  There was nothing above the water level.  The rain fell steadily, just as it did on campus, and perhaps this was the reason why the town hadn’t flooded yet.

It was all coming here.  The rain released from its tormenter, falling incessantly, and flooding into the gray world.

I supposed that I could plant the seed and then try to find a way out, but something told me that this wasn’t the right spot for it.  I was seeing the effects of the rain, but it didn’t feel like this was anything other than the fringes of the rain’s influence.  I had to get this right.  I’d only get one chance, otherwise, the seed would be wasted and it’d do nothing but eat away at Grayson in bits and pieces.  Or worse, it would do nothing at all.

And when the gray world could no longer contain the rain, when things twisted and shifted beyond tolerance, then it would overflow onto campus.  I’d heard stories back home about what happened when a malevolent ancient claimed a parcel of land.  Slowly, person by person, the town would dwindle into nothingness.  People would either leave, unable to tolerate the oppression in the air, or they would die.  This sort of thing didn’t happen often… but it did happen.

Oh, we’d call it due to an economic downturn or something like that, but a ghost town is aptly named.

I began slogging my way through the water.  Seek the highest hill was the way to escape the gray world, but I wasn’t certain that was what I was looking for.  I was looking for *anything* at all, anything that would help me understand what I was to do with the seed.  It burned when it touched my bare skin so I carried it swaddled in my shirt, tucked against my chest.  

I walked for what felt like a very short time and a very long distance.  I could feel the world turning underneath my feet, rotating on its axis, but the scenery never changed.  I walked through the water, skirting the areas where I couldn’t gauge the depth, trying to stay on the swells where there were only a few inches of water.  The rain soaked through my clothing but I wasn’t cold, not with the stone radiating heat through my shirt.  Its presence felt comforting.  Somehow, it made me feel like I was doing the right thing.

Then I saw something up ahead.  A person.  I sloshed through the water towards it, nervously, because this *was* the gray world and I couldn’t trust that anything here was safe.  But they didn’t move, just stood there and stared at their feet, and as I grew closer I realized that I recognized who it was.  I broke into a run with a cry, my heels kicking up sprays of water, and I ran as hard as I could to where Maria stood all alone.

She raised her head and stared through me as I approached.  I came to a stop in front of her, panting, and wrapped both arms around the stone at my chest to shield it from her.  It was already covered up, but I didn’t dare let her touch it.  I couldn’t let it pull her inside as it’d almost done to James.

“Maria?” I asked.  “It’s me.  It’s Ashley.”

Her gaze sharpened.  She stared at me for a moment and then she smiled, a tentative, trembling gesture.

“I was waiting for you,” she said.  “I knew you’d come for me.”

For a moment I was speechless.  Then I began to cry, in relief, and with the heavy weight of her words.  She’d waited for *me*.  Because she knew I would come.  And I wanted to tell her that I didn’t know what I was doing here, that I was scared and confused, but I didn’t say anything at all.  Because she already knew all that and she’d waited for me anyway.

“I’m here now,” I said instead.  “You’re not alone.  I’m here.  We can go home together.”

“Go?” she asked, puzzled.  “But I stayed right here.”

Her words didn’t make sense to me, but that was to be expected.  She was caught between life and death and all of her focus was on holding onto herself.  I had to be patient.

“Right,” I said. “You didn't want to wander. That's smart. But we need to find the highest hill if we're going to get out of here.”

I grabbed her hand. It was reassuringly warm. She was alive. I just needed to get her back into her body. I tugged, trying to pull her with me so we could keep walking in any direction, searching for any change in terrain. Any at all.

“I found a hill”, she whispered. “There was something there.  It was… a bird?  But also the sky.  Yes, I think it was the sky.  It told me I could go with it and it’d keep me safe from everything.”

The master of the gray world.  She’d met it and she’d chosen to wait for me instead. I nervously licked my lips. Somehow, it felt worse now that it wasn't just me I needed to save. I had to plant the seed and then get us both out. I took a deep breath. Maria was still talking.

“It sent me here,” she said. “Even though it’s not safe.  That’s what the sky said.  But there’s not many things around here anymore, so I suppose it didn’t need to worry about me.”

Maria was rambling.  I looked around us, trying to figure out what was special about this particular spot.  It was no different from everything around us, as far as I could see.  Just another swell of land, the soggy grass swaying underneath a few inches of water.  Beside me, Maria fell silent.  I glanced at her and noticed that she was looking at something, her gaze unfocused, her lips half-parted.  She was looking down at our feet.

So that’s where I looked as well.

And all around us the water was black instead of silver, the gray sheen was gone and so was the ground, there was nothing but the dark depths below us as far as I could see, like spilled ink directly below my feet -

I gasped and tore my gaze away.  I stared at the sky instead and at the raindrops covering the lenses of my glasses.  

“Is this… where you entered the gray world?” I finally asked, trying to keep my voice even.

“Entered?  I - I was pulled -”

Yes.  It was.

“But I fell for so long, through so much darkness,” Maria said and there was an edge of wild panic in her voice.

I squeezed her hand, distracting her from wherever her thoughts were veering.  She couldn’t lose herself.  Not when we were so close.

Then I looked down again and this time, I didn’t stare into the depths of the water.  I stared at my ankles, at where the water formed a silver ring, and then I swept my gaze out from that and I looked at the surface of the water, searching for a reflection, searching for something to ground myself on.

And I saw a shape, a person, except it wasn’t me.  It wasn’t me at all.

It was Professor Monotone.

I admit my brain short-circuited a bit at that.  I mean, of all the things I would have expected to see in the water of the gray world, that was not it.  But after a moment my brain kicked in again and I realized his back was to my point of view and he was speaking, he was gesturing, and then I saw who he was speaking *to*.

It was Cassie.  She faced him with her arms crossed, scowling bitterly.  Behind her was Josh and James… and Grayson.  Josh and James were holding onto Grayson’s arms, one to either side of him.  His eyes were wide with terror and I realized he couldn’t stop them.  He was in a human body, inside dying flesh, and there was no rain inside the power plant basement.  They were dragging him closer to the edge of the pool, dragging him closer to where I waited on the other side.

“I’d rather die!” he shrieked at them.  His voice was muffled, almost inaudible, like he was deep underwater.  “I’d rather be undone entirely than be *trapped* like this!”

No.  This wasn’t what I wanted.

“Let's go,” I said to Maria, my voice right with urgency. “I think we're in the right spot.”

I tried not to think about what I was doing.  Any hesitation and I might freeze up entirely, but I’d figured that out and I knew the trick to get around.  Just don’t think.  Get that first step out of the way and everything else would follow.

I took a deep breath and I jumped.  A short hop, enough to get my feet out of the swamp, and when my feet hit the water again they kept going.  There was no more ground.  I was falling, plunging straight into water, and I recognized this place.  I knew it, for I’d seen it in Grayson’s terror.  This was his realm, this was where all the water went, an empty void where he was alone, stretched across the entirety of the ocean, existing only from moment to moment as each raindrop fell and was absorbed into the earth.

I looked up.  I could see, far above us, my friends.  Their faces were blurred from the water, but I still recognized Josh and James and Grayson, leaning over the surface of the pool.  Cassie wasn’t visible.  No doubt she was tying up Professor Monotone and keeping him from stopping them.  I felt a little bad for pitting him against Cassie.  That wasn’t a fight he could win.

Then they threw Grayson in.  

He struggled, trying to swim up, but it was like the water was sucking him in and he twisted, thrashing, flailing with his hands as if he was trying to knock it away from him.  As if it had grabbed hold and was pulling him down.

Then James, in Maria’s body, jumped in.

Maria’s body went limp.  And James drifted out of it and I saw him as he once was, as he looked in Professor Monotone’s photo.  He began to swim down, chasing Grayson, leaving Maria’s body to drift.  I looked beside me.  Maria was staring upwards, that distant look gone from her eyes and she was focused and I knew she realized what she had to do.  I let go of her hand, shoving her upwards as I did.  And she started to swim.  Towards her body, towards the surface, towards everything that would give her her life back.

All that left was the seed.  I wrenched my gaze away from Grayson’s sinking body.  I didn’t know how to save him.  I didn’t think he *should* be saved, not like this.  James deserved to live and Grayson… I unwrapped the seed from my shirt.  This was all I could do for him.

I let go of the seed.  It floated in the water and from the crack I watched as a pale sprout emerged.  The first tip of a root.  I turned away, towards the surface.  I had to get out of here before I ran out of oxygen.  I began to swim upwards and the air in my lungs carried me up faster than I expected.  This was all going to work.  I was going to escape, the seed was where it needed to be and Grayson-

I paused.  He drifted in the water, no longer fighting, back arched, eyes wide and his mouth open.  His chest rose and fell, breathing the water as easily as if it were air.  

And then I glanced down, towards the seed.  It turned over in the water, drifting faintly along a weak current, and as I watched the root shriveled, broke off, and floated away.

It wasn’t sprouting.  All of this was for nothing.  It felt like a hand was squeezing my chest, crushing the hope that I’d dared allow to blossom, and replacing it with an icy terror that froze my muscles.  I was going to save Maria and James, but Grayson would be trapped inside the manifestation of all his fears.  For one brief, wild moment I thought I could swim over to him, grab his hand, and let him consume me and we’d be together, just as he wanted, and maybe it would be okay in the end -

My body wouldn’t move.  I couldn’t force myself to go to him.  This was my life to do with as I wanted and I didn’t want that.

I felt a hand grab my shoulder.  I turned myself around in the water and stared into James’s eyes.  His gaze tracked past me, towards Grayson, towards his body, and then down to the seed.

He knew.  He understood what I was trying to do.  And he knew why it wasn’t working.

Then he looked at me again and his eyes were wide with desperation.  He wanted to live.  He wanted to live *so bad* but then his face tightened with a hopeless resolve and I knew he’d decided.  It wasn’t fair, it wasn’t right, and everything he was rebelled against giving in, but this was going to be all the time he got in life.  

He let go of my hand and linked his hands together, placed them underneath my foot, and shoved me upwards. 

Then he dove, down to the seed, to the heart, and he wrapped his hands around it and let it pull him in.

I felt a hand grab the back of my shirt.  I was wrenched upwards, my head broke through the water, and then there was an arm around my chest and hands on my arms and my friends were pulling me out of the water.

“I’m sorry,” I sobbed, sucking air into my lungs.  “I’m so sorry.  I’ll bring you back.  I promise.  I’ll bring you back as yourself.”

They dragged me clear.  And I sat there, crying, and watched as the water in the pool began to recede.  It dropped lower and lower and just underneath that glistening surface I saw branches forming.  Buds appeared on the tips and then they sprouted into leaves and the water dropped lower and lower as the tree drank it up, until it was gone from sight, and all that was left was a rectangle where the concrete was an inch lower than the floor around it.

“James… isn’t coming out,” Cassie said and she sounded… confused.  Like she couldn’t accept that this hadn’t worked exactly as she wanted.

“No,” I said.  “And neither is Grayson.”

It was over.  The pool was gone.  No one else would be pushed in and be left to linger for as long as they could hold on, while their body decayed and died without them.  I should be happy by this, but I only sat there and cried, and my friends sat with me for as long as I needed.

It rained for one more day before the weather finally cleared.  I didn’t see much of Maria.  She desperately needed to catch up on her classes if she was going to pass finals at the end of the year.  She did make time to talk about what happened, though.  From her perspective, almost no time at all had passed.  She wound up in the gray world and then I was there to take her out.  She didn’t remember anything of her conversation with the master of the gray world and honestly, I feel that’s for the best.  Her quasi-death experience has hopefully dampened her enthusiasm for the inhuman, but I don’t want to risk rekindling it.

Because there are still creatures out there.  The rain is still an ancient thing.  I know that from a very reliable source.

“See?” a regrettably familiar voice said from behind my right shoulder, as I walked to my first exam of finals week.  “Didn’t I promise you’d graduate?”

The devil fell in step beside me.  He seemed utterly at ease now, which was understandable considering the rain wasn’t able to get rid of him anymore.  I felt a stab of bitterness at that.

“It wasn’t worth it,” I said tersely.  “I wish I’d never taken your damn bargain.”

“Oh, don’t be like that.  You knew that the rain couldn’t continue on like it had been.  Everything was unraveling.  Grayson had no backup plan for the end of the year.  If he couldn’t share your body and soul, then his current one would have simply fallen apart and he’d have no replacement.”

“But I left him trapped in that place.”

He stepped in front of me so that I was forced to stop and look directly at him.  He spread his arms out and there was no smile on his face.  No mockery.  He locked eyes with me, his gaze bright.

“It’s still raining, isn’t it?” he said intently.  “Are you really so arrogant as to think you could destroy - or even *trap* - an ancient thing?  No, the rain is still here.  It’s just… contained now.  Not trapped.  Contained.”

“But he doesn’t have a body anymore -”

“I told you to kill the tree so you could *change* things.  So go change them again, if you don’t like the results.”

Then he spun, putting his back to me, and walked away whistling, his hands in his pockets.  I watched him go until he veered to tail a student, getting in close to whisper something in their ear.  They didn’t seem to notice his presence at all, but when the devil was done talking they stopped cold and pulled out their phone and started urgently texting.  I averted my gaze and kept walking.  That felt like a whole lot of drama starting up that *was not my problem.*

Ancient things don’t really die.  Inhuman things don’t always die either.  They just vanish for a little while and then come back, perhaps as something different, or exactly as they were, if the stories around them are strong enough.  If enough people know what they *should* be.

And… well.  The other day Cassie found her freshly laundered bras sitting on her desk when she walked into class.

Yes.  Her desk.  It was awkward, she said.

The devil said to change things again, if I didn’t like how it turned out.

I’m not done here.  I’m going to make good on that promise to the rain.  I’ve got one more year and after that I’m going to apply for the graduate program.  Professor Monotone has already agreed to be my advisor.  I’m not doing this just for Grayson, though.  I want to stay here.  I don’t quite know what to do after graduation yet and maybe this is just a stalling measure to delay that decision, but on some level the thought of getting an advanced degree appeals to me.  Like I spent all this time in undergrad figuring out who I am and now I have a foundation I can start building on.  Leaving my hometown and going to college was the first decision I made solely for myself and I’m ready to make some more of those choices.

This could be a mistake.  I might regret it.

But I won’t know that until I try.

One more year until everything changes again.  I don’t feel ready for it… but somehow, I’m okay with that.

Because being human is to change.

I think that’s why rules don’t work so well on us.  They chafe at our very nature.  Humanity just doesn’t like being told what to do.

But rules are great at changing the inhuman.

I’m keeping in touch with the Folklore Society.  We’re going to start spreading a new rule about the rain.  It’s not accurate.  Not *yet*.

Don’t go outside when it rains.  But if you find yourself caught in it, look for the student walking alone with no umbrella and no raincoat.  Walk with them, and they’ll make sure you get home safely.

We’ll make it real.   

And I do mean ‘we’.  Not ‘we’ as in Cassie, Maria, Josh and I, but you and me and everyone else.  Because rules are only one part of this.  

Stories shape the inhuman as well.

I’ve told this story to you now, the good and the bad, the things you hated about Grayson and the things you loved.  I told you about him, about what he wanted more than anything.  And that’s what you’ll remember.  Not the rain.  Not something formless and scattered.  You’ll remember Grayson, just as I remember him.

We’ll give the rain the freedom it wants.  It’ll be able to walk among us, not trapped inside dying, stolen flesh, but as something that can exist on its own, something that isn’t caught up in the demands of a long-dead ritual, but something that exists for its own sake.  I don’t know what that will look like… but I’m excited to find out.

Together we can make the rain into something new.
