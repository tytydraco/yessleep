In my last post, I detailed my experience in being tricked by my ex-best friend and forced into her family’s psychotic game. 

I didn’t tell you what  happened in the [game](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12s6mfu/three_years_ago_i_was_murdered_at_my_best_friends/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and the after effects of it which started to bleed back into real life once we escaped. 

I can confidently say I am safe now, and I’m in a position to be able to write down my full experience. I didn’t know it yet, but Astrid and her family weren’t finished with us. In fact, they were just getting started.

…

No matter how much I washed and scrubbed at my hands, they were always covered in blood, always stained the brightest crimson shade, slick and wet and permanently stained, almost like a reminder that I was no longer human. 

The red on my hands was old, and I was sure it wasn’t fully real. It couldn’t be. I had showered and bathed four times a day since escaping Astrid’s game, scrubbing myself over and over again until my skin was red and raw—and somehow I still felt filthy. I still felt disgusting.

They were always red. Always dripping. 

And no matter how many times I told myself it wasn’t real, that it was just one of many, many side-effects I was going through after being diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, I believed it. I didn’t have full clarity of how many people had died at my hand, and then came back multiple times to die all over again—or the amount of times I died myself. 

But the stains on my hands told me everything I needed to know. 

Two months after escaping my ex best friend’s game and enduring what I can only describe as hell on earth, I was standing in my therapist’s office’s bathroom, bent over his faucet slicing my arms open. For one, I hated the color of his bathroom; a deep shade of coral, which had been Astrid’s wedding dress on the night she murdered me and turned me into a fucking monster. I hated that everything was so… clean. So put together. The tiles on the walls in front of me were perfectly clinical white. 

The stream of water I was running my hands through was perfectly warm. Not too hot, and not too cold. But it was too clean. 

I didn’t remember a lot from the game, but I do remember cleaning my wounds in murky brown water which helped me blend into the wildlife. 

Inside my therapist’s bathroom, there was nowhere to hide. There was nowhere to run or duck or crouch under. It’s like my mind was still trapped in fight or flight, and nothing was more familiar, more comforting, than finally seeing my own blood in beads of red dripping down my arm. It wasn’t old red, the stains from the games. New red. I had successfully sliced two layers into my flesh with a piece of broken mirror I had found in the trash, to look for trackers. But, staring into water diffused bright red, I started to realize that doing this in a therapist’s office was probably a bad idea. 

No sign of trackers, I thought, forcing the shard of glass through another layer of skin, biting my lips against a cry. To satisfy the paranoia driving me insane, I opened up the wound as best as I could using the edges of the shard, delving deeper and deeper through sharp red. Nope. 

No trackers.

I told myself I would never look at the state of my hands, or at least the memory of my hands—for too long. Because when I did, when I really focused on the phantom filth under my nails, and rivulets of red staining my palms, I started to go back. Back to moments where I wasn’t conscious, but my body was. Back to when Astrid’s voice was whispering into my head, and the sounds of gunfire filled the air, damp grass under my feet and the stink of rotting flesh choking the back of my nose and throat. 

Slowly, the memory began to bleed into me, brutally slamming into my skull once my hands tightened into fists around the faucet. I needed to hold onto something, something to anchor my mind to a reality I knew. Dr. Carson’s office.

When screams started to fill my mind, screams of pain and mercy, those of us begging to die and others begging to live, I thrust my bleeding arms into warm water, focusing on the feel of it swimming around my elbows, and when I looked up, the flickering bulb above. The pop song coming out in vicious spurts on the radio. But it wasn’t enough. Because the  screams were echoing in my mind, I was chasing that memory, one which I had never looked for in the first place. I wasn’t human for those three years stuck in captivity. I did not have a mind to think with. I did not have senses which worked. And yet that part of me still had memories. All at once, the light flickering above me became brighter suddenly before it wasn’t a light at all. 

It was the late afternoon sun poking through thick canopies of trees. My mind knew sunset was when the others began their hunt, and when Astrid decided to use me to take them out. 

It didn’t matter how many times they came back, I was the one who took them down one by one. That was if I could catch them. 

The thought filled my mind. Not one I could remember. And when I clung onto it, tried to make sense of my own words, I was violently pulled back. Initially, it felt like a physical pull in my mind. But really, it was my body’s visceral reaction to a memory I had both consciously and unconsciously tried to suppress. I could sense the panic attack brewing, the ache in my chest, the curl of pain and nausea twisting my gut and filling my mouth with my breakfast. 

The clinical white of the bathroom, and the faucet I was clinging onto for dear life, morphed into woodland suffocating me, and the tiles beneath my converse, the ones I had been feverishly counting since walking into the bathroom, became thick, wet grass and dirt tickling the bare soles of my feet. I remember trying to scream for help. But my body was incapable of moving. All I could do was standing there, shivering, choking back vomit, as my mind yanked me back inside deep crevices I thought I had left behind.  

There was something metallic melded into my hand as I strode through trees, my body no longer mine, more of a robot. It was a gun.

I knew it was a gun, or at least this version of me did. I knew the exact make of it, and the feel of it felt familiar and comforting pressed into my hand. Ahead of me, the body of a girl hung upside down from a tree, while another wearing a feral smile gutted her like a pig with the teeth of a blade held expertly between her fingers. I didn’t look at the dead girl’s guts splattering the ground. I didn’t flinch when I mindlessly kicked at a decapitated head on the forest floor. I kept going, motivated by her voice murmuring into my skull. “Keep going, Penn. It’s just this way. Go slowly, remember."

I followed her voice, treading through the river’s shallows. A shadow bound in front of me, a guy with a leather satchel, a machete tucked into a makeshift pouch. 

He was making too much noise, throwing himself through the trees. I could sense his fear, and I knew he was one of them. He was awake.  I raised my gun to shoot, but Astrid told me not to. She wanted me to keep going, so I did.

There was something I noticed, being there in the memory. 

Something my other self didn’t, while her mind had been purged, her body turned into a playable character. The wood’s weren’t as quiet as I remembered. They felt… alive. 

Ducking under branches and treading through dirt, there was a certain buzz in the air, a bitter breeze which played with my hair, but was then far too strong to be just that of a breeze. It was almost sentient, tickling across my cheeks, like prodding fingers. And if I really focused and strained my ears, the air sounded like it was… singing. Giggling. It wasn’t until I came to a clearing, did I stop. She made me stop. 

Coming to an abrupt halt, I turned left and then right, scanning my surroundings. The sky was starting to darken, trees bleeding into shadows, while human-like ones joined the darkness. I smelled it when I took a step further. Fire. Not just that. Something else. “Go slowly, Penn,” Astrid whispered. “I don’t like this, and I don’t want you to die again.” She emphasised, “again” with an exaggerated sigh.

I took another step, snapping a branch under my foot. Something sharp stabbed into my toe, a piece of glass or a thorn. 

There was pain, but I didn’t feel it. Astrid shrieked before pulling me back with a laugh. There was a small fire made up of wood and bracken, smoke swirling in the air. 

“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.” Adam’s voice drifted through, choked with a laugh. “Wait. Get closer. I want to see this. Holy fuck. Let me get a photo.”  The smell became stronger, no longer just the stink of burning. It was something else, something which turned my gut. The closer I got, taking slow steps, angling my head just right so I could get the perfect shot, I glimpsed a figure kneeling in the dirt.

I saw the spear first, lying on the ground. The sharp end was stained with blood, pieces of flesh still clinging on. There was no identity, except what was left of a light pink shirt which was shredded, hanging off of him, and a crown of flowers where each one was in startling bloom despite the state of him. Clashing with a thing of beauty, however, was something more sinister, what looked like an animal skull threaded through the crown of flowers. 

It didn’t make sense to me. How the blossoms entangled in bedraggled curls could be alive, while the boy was  barely holding onto his humanity. I could sense it in the way he was raking at the dirt and grass like an animal. He was… digging. Astrid told me to step back, and I did. Adam was laughing. Hyena laughing. Like even he, watching something so inhuman and wrong, wasn’t human himself.  

The boy continued to dig until he was grasping at something, and I could sense his desperation. He was pulling something from the ground, his fingers tip-toeing, then his hands grasping onto what looked like a hand, which became an elbow. I stood frozen, while Astrid and Adam watched the boy pull a body from under the ground, before setting it in front of him. It wasn’t one of ours. Because we didn’t die. And when we did, we came back minutes later. Instead, the corpse was from the outside world. Astrid started squealing when the boy dug into the back of his pants, pulling out a knife, before kneeling over the body. 

It was fresh. I could tell it had just been buried, maybe a few days before. From the look on his face, illuminated by the orange blur of the fire, the boy had no expression. He was feeling everything around him. Because he was awake.

I watched his trembling hand holding the knife, slice into the arm of the body, cutting off a chunk of flesh, and without hesitation, putting it into his mouth, chewing, and swallowing. But he didn’t stop. He continued, hacking away at the arm, and then dropping his knife all together, using his fingers, and then much sharper teeth, to strip flesh off emaciated bone. Adam let out an incredulous laugh. “Come on, Spence, I was rooting for you, man. And you join the freaks? You really know how to let a friend down, huh.”

“Are you surprised?” Astrid scoffed. “Didn’t you say he was your… lesser off friend? He’s the guy whose dad went broke, right? He owned half of London, and then… didn’t.”

“Well yeah,” He chuckled. “Actually, it does make sense that he would be one of the first to lose it completely. Spence was always on the edge, anyway.”

“Shoot him.” Astrid’s voice was a shrill hiss in my head. “Shoot that disgusting freak. And shoot him again when he comes back,” she let out a sigh. “I don’t understand how he thinks he’s going to win through these methods. The aim of the game is to survive, not lose your marbles.”

“But he is surviving.”  Adam hummed. “I knew fucking with the food supply would make things a bit more interesting for the awake ones, and I told you leading him to the body would be a good idea. He was showing signs a few days ago and now I’m sure of it. Our boy’s going feral.”

“Shoot him.”

Astrid was speaking to me this time. “What are you waiting for, Penn? Shoot him!”

Crouching into the dirt, I took aim, but the boy was already twisting around, his frenzied eyes scanning the darkness. He met my gaze, and I expected him to run like the others. Instead, though, his lips split into a bloody grin of gnashing teeth and stringy pieces of flesh and fat caught between his incisors. I realized, a twist in my gut, that the boy wasn’t scared. 

I wasn’t seeing desperation and pain in his trembling hands as he struggled to dig through the dirt. I was seeing excitement. He turned back to his meal, using his fingers to slowly peel away another chunk of bloodied fat, and sticking it into his mouth. I knew what they meant by awake. Unlike me, who followed Astrid’s every command, shooting and killing everyone I came across to win a never-ending game, the ones who were awake didn’t care about winning. They didn’t care about anything but surviving—and it was the so-called ‘mercy’ of being fully aware and conscious of the reality they were in, which was sending them spiralling.

When Astrid screamed into my skull, I squeezed the trigger, and the boy dropped onto the ground with a gentle thud. She made me drive the blade of my knife into his skull so he would stay dead a little longer, and crouched over his body, beads of his blood dripping down my fingers cinched around my blade, the wind once again giggled, playing with my hair. I didn’t stay around and wait for the boy to come back. Astrid led me to the lake, told me to clean my hands in water I couldn’t see through, and then insisted I washed my hair too. “You haven’t washed your hair in weeks, Penn,” she groaned, while I dumped my head into freezing cold water, massaging my scalp. 

I stayed alert for pursuers lurking in the dark while she started ranting about the rising price of her favorite shampoo.

“Do you have lice, Penny?”

Her words were somehow familiar, and part of me remembered the time in middle school when she pulled me aside and told me secretly that she had picked one off of my sweater in math class. “*But don’t worry!”* Her little self’s voice reverberated in my skull, “*My mommy said lice only go on dirty hair.. Which means your hair is dirty and we need to clean it. Because, no offence, but I really don’t want to play with you if your hair is full of lice. Besides, you’re my best friend!”*

Her present voice, meanwhile, embodied her younger self. “Oh my god, I can see them crawling in your hair even from here! That’s so gross! How did you get lice?"

Astrid’s laugh was still clanging around in my skull when I screamed into my hands, shaking, trembling, against clinical white. 

My hands were pressed over my ears, my mouth filled with the taste of rusty coins from biting into my tongue. The sounds of screams tangled with my best friend’s giggles bled into the pop-song still sputtering on the radio, and the darkness choking me, suffocating me, became the blinding white light overhead.  It took me  second to realize I wasn’t in the game, and my hands, drenched in red and curled into fists in my lap, were stained with my own blood—and not Spencer’s. 

The overwhelming aroma of my own perfume I’d drenched myself in wasn’t enough to mask the phantom stink of rotting flesh and smoulder still clinging to the back of my nose. Twisting around, I emptied my stomach as curtly as I could without making a big deal out of it. “Elena?” Dr. Carson’s voice floated in from his office, when I was doing my best to wash away the sharp smears of scarlet decorating the faucet. The name confused me for a moment before it sunk in that Elena was my fake name. There was no way I was using my real one.  “Are you okay? You have been in there for a while.” He paused. “I heard you throwing up. Do you need help?”

I managed to find my voice, struggling to staple myself in my reality. “No, I’m fine,” I said through a strangled cry, stuffing the bloody shard into my jeans pocket. “I’ll be there in a second.”

Running my stinging arms under a fresh stream of water, I wrapped them up in toilet paper and threw on my sweater, tugging the sleeves over my wrists to hide tell-tale splashes of red. 

I made it back into my therapist’s office with what I hoped was a wide smile and making sure to fold my arms across my chest to avoid exposing the obvious spatters of blood all over my sleeves. When I sat down, I immediately wanted to get back up. My body was vibrating with a constant urge to be on my feet and ready to run. I couldn’t stop fidgeting, sitting and then standing, and then pulling my knees to my chest. I could never find a position I was comfortable with. But Dr. Carson didn’t seem fazed. Instead of questioning my inability to sit still, and my sudden interest in the door I kept eyeing, ready to make my escape if needed, he leaned forward with a friendly smile. The man looked to be my dad’s age with greying hair and caterpillar eyebrows. “Now. What we were talking about during your last session, do you want to go back to it?” His voice was soothing, like warm water coming over me, enveloping my mind.

“No.”

The word came out of my mouth before I could stop it, and before he could speak, a whiff of something entering my nostrils instantly turned my gut.

“Elena, it would be helpful if we talk about your trauma—"

I cut him off, resisting the urge to cover my nose. I could smell it from across the room. McDonald’s. The stink was on his breath, and if I really concentrated, I could see chilli stains on his desk, and the wrappers were still covered in mayonnaise and caramelised onions.  “I want to skip it.”

Dr. Carson’s lips formed a patient smile. 

“Of course.” He cleared his throat. “Now. You told me during your last session that you are scared of the moon. Would you be able to… elaborate on that?” Before I could shake my head, he cleared his throat. “Elena, you went through a very traumatic experience. You were held by your ex-partner for three years. I must say, you are quite well put together, and strong enough to get out of bed and come and see me. You might think you are in a bad place, but getting into your car and actively wanting to find a solution for your trauma is a step forward.” Again, I tried to speak, but he was cutting me off again. “The moon, Elena."

He leaned further towards me. “You told me last week that you are suffering from gaps in your memory, which is a side-effect of PTSD. Your mind is trying to protect you and block certain things out.” He cocked his head, frowning a little. “Do you think, perhaps, the moon may have played a part in that? For example, did things ever get physical during your captivity? Did your partner lay his hands on you when you saw the moon in the sky one particular night? Finding association with normal every-day things and relating them to your trauma is a very common side-effect people have.”

When my eyes started to sting, he handed me a tissue, and I shooed it away with a half-hearted scoff. “I’m okay.”

His question was hard to answer, considering I couldn’t exactly tell this therapist the truth. 

I had to make several things up with the dregs of what really happened. 

But I did fear the moon. 

Every full moon, I stayed in my apartment with every curtain shut. “I don’t know,” I said. “I haven’t really thought about it.” That was a lie. I had thought about it. I wanted to know why I was terrified of the moon more than the fact that I couldn’t die. Again, something I couldn’t just spew to the therapist. So, instead, I told him half of the truth. Leaning back on the comfortable couch, I held in a breath before exhaling out. “I don’t remember anything of what happened during my… captivity.” I had always called them, “The games”. But for my therapist’s sake, I had to fashion my experience into something more realistic which didn’t involve coming back to life, and a magic barrier trapping us inside a forest of hell. 

Or maybe he would just think I really, really, liked The Hunger Games. 

Looking my therapist dead in the eye, I told the truth. Because being in the dark while being haunted by flashes which didn’t make sense, just like in the bathroom, triggered by my scarlet hands, was driving me crazy. “I want to see what happened,” I whispered. “I don’t want to be in the dark anymore because it’s..” my hands formed fists, my blood started to boil at the thought of Astrid knowing where I was. “It’s killing me not knowing what happened to me."

Dr. Carson nodded. “I think I may have a solution.” He jumped to his feet and gestured for me to. “Miss Lucas, if you would like to make yourself comfortable on the bed,” he patted a hospital-like bed at the other end of the office that I thought was there for decoration. Still though, I did, lying down on soft linen sheets while he loomed over me. “Have you ever heard of hypnotherapy?” He asked in a low voice.

I had. Though I had always imagined a swinging pendulum.

“Will it… hurt?”

“No, it will not hurt. I can assure you. Think of it like dreaming but this time I will be coaxing you through.”

When the lights flickered off, my body instantly went into panic mode, and I tried to dive off of the bed, my heart in my throat. But his hands were gentle, coaxing me back into a lying down position. “Relax. What we’re going to do today is attempt to delve into your subconscious mind and visit what your mind has told you to forget.” 

He squeezed my hand. “Don’t worry, I will be with you every step of the way, and if you want to stop, we will stop.” I tried to protest with a cry, because the last thing I wanted to do was be forced back into that hell—a hell I could  only remember the backend of, after abruptly waking up three years later surrounded by two opposing tribes. The ones who played the game, and the ones who had lost their minds. 

“Usually, I tell patients to stay where they are on the couch, but today I will be using the lying down method with you. It will help you to calm down and relax your body enough so we can begin to explore what you have suppressed.”

Dr. Carson held up a ticker. “I want you to focus on this, okay? Just… close your eyes and push out all of your thoughts. Imagine you are standing on a beach,” his murmur sounded like ocean waves as I closed my eyes and forced myself to relax. “All of the bad thoughts and memories you are having are being washed away by a wave, and all that is left… is… you.” 

I didn’t imagine a beach. What came to mind, instead, was an impossible wall of glass in front of my face, and my own reflection, my hands becoming fists pounding against it before I was once again standing deep inside the forest.  

My therapist’s  voice collapsed into a low murmur inside my mind. “Can you hear me, Elena?”

I took a slow step, my feet snapping branches before I started to run. I glimpsed the shadow ahead of me flitting through the trees.

“Yes. I can… I can hear you.”

“Where are you right now?”

“I’m… in a clearing.”

“Mmm hmm. And what is around you? Can you describe what you can see for me?”

Drinking in my surroundings, I saw twitching bodies which were either dead, or coming back to life, and a startling shade of red pooling across the forest floor. But seeing that only brought flashes of the night of the wedding. I remember not being able to move, stumbling and staggering over bodies—and those same ones littered the forest floor. I could see parts of them which had been severed and chopped off, shot at and sliced into pieces, while others throats had been slit. While some of them trembled, life still clinging onto them, others began to rot away, flesh peeling from bone, before the cycle began again, wounds disappearing, blood seeping into the dirt like it was a personal sacrifice to mother nature; skin stitching back together and heads finding torso’s. 

Skin became stars before fading all together, while outlines began in dirt, their exact same position, their clothes, even the expression they died with—all of it coming back to life in startling, horrifying clarity. The way they came back was cruel, almost like an invisible presence was forcing it, plunging free souls back inside recycled corpses. “The… dead.” I managed to choke out. “Everyone is dead.”

“Everyone?”

My therapist cleared his throat. “Elana, can you go deeper? Tell me what you mean by everyone. Are they there with you?"

This time I stumbled back, before rough hands were grasping hold of me and twisting me around.

“Penny!”

His voice drowned that of my therapist, and the more I found it, clinging onto it, I was thrust deeper into the memory, no longer surface level with Dr. Carson’s voice as an anchor. The British accent sounded familiar. Half of his face was lit up in moonlight, the other cast in darkness. Immediately, I knew this memory was much older. This must have been at the start. 

Spencer looked dishevelled in a  blood spattered shirt, and he’d tugged off his flower crown at some point. The sherpa jacket wrapped around his waist wasn’t his, and I could tell by the bloodied sleeves that he’d been in a fight to get a hold of it. This Spencer looked human. Still with expression and eyes ignited with fear, lips twisted into a cry I think he was struggling to maintain. But looking closer, he looked malnourished and pale, his cheeks gaunt and sticking out. I don’t even think dying and coming back could save him from wasting away. “Snap out of it.” 

He shoved me onto my knees, before following suit, his trembling hands coming down on my shoulders. There was a shriek, followed by a loud laugh behind us, and Spencer’s frightened eyes flashed to the darkness before meeting my gaze once again. “Please.” His voice broke into a sob. “Penny, I know you’re in there. I know you’re fucking in there, alright? You need to snap the fuck out of it because I—” He turned his head again, scanning for lurkers. 

“I think I’m losing my… my mind.” His grip tightened. “They’ve stopped feeding us. And sure, you don’t care because… because there’s nothing in there,” he let out a hollow laugh. “I don’t think you even need food.” Spencer spluttered. “But..” He shuffled back on his knees, heaving in sharp breaths and exhaling. 

“I need to eat, Penny." He whispered. “It’s been days. Fucking days, Penny. Everyone around me has lost their fucking minds, and not even… not even dying helps. I still come back… starving.” His lips curled into a feral snarl. “I come back and I’m.. I’m so fucking hungry.”

I didn’t flinch when he slapped me across the face. Up close, I could see the tears in his eyes and glistening on his cheeks, and he was right—an animalistic desperation beginning to blossom in his expression. And all the while, the wind tugged at his hair, invisible hands poking his cheeks. “Penny! Jesus, fuck, snap out of it! Do you hear me?” He tipped his head back, screaming at the sky illuminated in moonlight, which reminded me of the night of his death, and then I guessed it was the night of his rebirth too.  “Adam! You fucking cunt! Let me out!"

No reply. But I wasn’t expecting it.

“Is this… punishment?” He demanded in a cry. “Because of what happened in school? Because I almost got you kicked out?”

He paused, screaming again, this time breaking down and grasping at clumps of his hair. “Let me out. Please. Just stop this! Whatever you're doing, this sick game, please. Just let us out."

Silence.

Only the chirp of insects, and the sound of someone close slipping through darkness, careful not to make too much sound.

Astrid was alert in my mind, telling me to back down when my wrist twitched and went to where my gun was poking from my jeans.

Turning to me, Spencer swiped at his eyes. 

“I’m fucking scared,” he whispered. “I’m scared of what I’m going to do next.” He paused, a darkness swirling in his eyes I recognise from Astrid’s; a dark which hadn’t quite rooted itself and taken full bloom. He was still scared, still human. “Can you… feel that? It’s there, Penny. It’s creeping up my spine, and in my gut, my chest, it’s a… hunger.” He grasped my shoulders again, shaking me violently. I could see and hear and feel exactly what he was taking about. A presence in the air which wasn’t the wind. The wind didn’t laugh. 

The wind wasn’t made up of tiny little invisible fingers prodding and poking and pulling at my hair, stabbing at my mouth, trying to gag me. 

“Well?” Spencer’s lips broke out into a hopeful smile, the ghost of hope, when my head twitched slightly, my gaze finding a shadow bounding from the tree’s. 

I knew who it was from the whirlwind of golden curls spiralling in the breeze picking up around us. Her expression was just like mine, as she knelt onto the ground, aimed, and squeezed the trigger. The gunshot slammed into me, and I swore, at that moment, I could have sworn my mind was mind for a fraction of a second. 

Miss. 

She missed, the bullet ricocheting from the tree behind us. 

Like a solider, Evie jumped to her feet, and in two strides, she was dropping her gun and reaching for her knife. Spencer, to my confusion, didn’t move, didn’t stop shaking me. 

He knew she was there, but he wasn’t moving. Instead, he kept repeating the same thing, pleading for me to listen, until the teeth of her dagger were slicing into his throat with a jerk of her wrist. I didn’t see him die. I felt the warmth of his blood spatter my face and my neck, drowning my vision. And it was the sensation of Spencer’s blood dripping down my cheeks and tingeing my tongue, which sent me flying into a sitting position, my vision blurring out of focus. 

White. White tiles, white flooring, and the white of my therapist’s coat. Choking back barf, I struggled to catch a hold of myself. As if my memory had followed me back into the real world, bleeding into reality, that same presence in the air was back, playing with my hair.

It wasn’t real, I told myself.

“I want to stop.” I managed to choke out, spitting up barfy saliva. “Can we… Can we stop?”

The therapist didn’t answer, and when I turned my head, I caught him on the other side of the room, pacing back and forth, a phone to his ear.

It only took me glimpsing something, what looked like a shot, filled with ruby red liquid, for me to know something was… wrong.  My suspicions were confirmed when my therapist didn’t answer, but he did hiss into his phone. “Hurry up. And I want double. I don’t do this for free.”

Sure, I could have been fucking hallucinating that my therapist was working with Astrid and her family. It could  have been the subject of paranoid delusions.

But then he was coming over in three strides, holding the shot like a goddamn knife. I don’t think he knew what he was doing with it. He was  therapist, after all. I wasn’t sure he had proper medical knowledge. When he got closer, smiling at me that fake ass smile, for once I was glad for the reflexes I had developed in the game. Slipping my fingers into my jeans, I pulled out the shard, and when time stopped, and he grabbed my arm in an attempt to give me a shot, I lashed out. 

I didn’t mean to make a mess. In my mind, I was still working on the mindless state I had been in during the games. Though as a mindless player controlled by Astrid, I didn’t have emotions to feel when blood hit me in the face, when corpses dropped to the ground, spiling their innards. This time I was fully aware and too awake when the shard of glass slid almost effortlessly into my therapist’s neck. I wasn’t expecting the geyser of sharp red showering me, but his position looming over me, while I lay in a half sitting up stance, was completely my fault. I’m not sure if I ever felt horror when killing in the game. Astrid didn’t let me. 

But after yanking out the shard from the man’s neck, while he choked on his own blood, gurgling on beads of intense red slipping from his lips, I froze up. I could feel everything. Hear everything. The wet fleshy sound of the teeth sliding from his punctured throat, and his gasps sputtering for breath. When the man dropped to the ground, dead, I bent over and threw up for the second time that day. My gaze snapped to the window. I had maybe a few minutes before the check-in girl came in to see if everything was okay, and the window was the perfect get-away.

But…

My eyes scanned the office, zeroing in on his desk where he had been meandering around when I came to. Before I could second guess myself, I jumped to my feet, almost slipping on rapidly growing red pooling around the man’s corpse. My body was used to this kind of thing, but my brain had been asleep, stuck in Astrid’s trance. I knew how to clean up and dispose of the bodies. I knew how to sever them and burn the remains, and I knew how to dump them in the lake without catching attention. But I didn’t know about bodies in the real world. 

Searching my therapist's desk, I found several things which rang alarm bells; a scrap piece of paper with my name on, and when I buried deeper into his desk drawers, a pile of folders, three of which caught my eye. 

The survivors, or escapee’s, of Astrid and Adam’s psychotic game.

**Evangeline Castor.**

**Penny Soren.**

The last name had my stomach catapulting into my throat.

Along with our names, a list of locations and coordinates. I almost laughed. No matter how hard we had tried to hide, of course they found us.

I grabbed the folders, stuffing them under my shirt, and making my way over to the window.

Fifteen minutes later, my hands, once again slick with my own blood after ripping through my arms for the second time that day, were wrapped around the steering wheel of a car which wasn’t mine. Still no sign of a tracker.

Which didn’t make sense because they knew exactly where we were. 

Slicing into my arms and searching for trackers was putting a toll on me. I couldn’t die permanently, sure, but the last thing I needed was to attract attention. Dying in the game was considered normal, I could do it anywhere. 

Real life, however, was a lot different.

“Slow down! Jeez, do you want to kill us again?"

I wasn’t expecting Evie to almost run me over in a hummer which she had definitely stolen. The last thing I wanted to do was reunite with the survivors, but if that meant avoiding being forced into another death game, I could put up with Evangeline’s shit for as long as it took. Trying not to focus on my blurring vision from blood loss, I focused on the road. With one hand, I reached for a bottle of water on the passenger seat, downing the bottle. 

“Where did you get this car?” I managed to hiss out in a shriek.

It was the first time I had spoken to her since the three of us had gone our separate ways. Evie hadn’t changed. Or maybe she had and was too… Evie for me to notice. 

The girl, playing a Nintendo DS lite in the back, didn’t look up at me. She had happily surrendered the wheel over  after admitting she couldn’t drive properly and had slumped in the backseat with her feet up, clutching a DS I was sure, once again, did not belong to her.  I wasn’t going to question why the screen was black. I had done my best not to question a lot of things the girl had done after we escaped. 

I was 100% sure she was the most fucked up out of all of us, but Evie was putting up one hell of a show to tell us the exact opposite.

Evie didn’t look up at me, but she did pause, sticking the stylus in her mouth, and scraping her loose blonde curls into a ponytail. “Just some guy called Bob," she said through a mouthful of stylus. 

“And how did you find me?” I blinked rapidly, frowning at traffic in front of me starting to blur into one. The location scribbled in blue pen was in front of me, but I could barely make sense of it.

“We’re connected through vibes,” Evie hummed, kicking my seat. “Duh.”

“Vibes.” I twisted around to shoot her a look. “You mean you were stalking me.”

“Counter question, babe,” Evie murmured, her eyes glued to the DS’s black screen. Why are you covered in blood?”

“That’s…” I had to swallow a mouthful of water my stomach had decided to reject. “That’s my business.”

“Mmm. But you’re, like, bleeding all over my car. Which makes it my business because its fucking gross, and you’re like, going to give me some weird disease.”

“This isn’t your car.” I said through my teeth, and when I could practically hear her eyes rolling, I sighed. “I was trying to find a tracker which I thought was in my arm.”

She made a mocking gasping noise. “And did you?”

Evie made herself comfortable. “You think we have trackers on us,” she giggled. “That’s cute, Sweetie. You think they’re tracking us with like, CIA level shit, when we have literal vibes bringing us together.” I could tell she was either high, drunk, or maybe just being a fucking psycho as usual. She peeked over my seat. I think it’s kinda hot, you know? Me, you and the reject. Like… undead polyamory. I mean, I wouldn’t be totally against it. We can get Astrid and Adam to join, and they can call off the death game, y’know? Then we can all live happily ever after, and it'll be cute."

I couldn’t resist a sputtered laugh.

She was giving them way too much credit.

When I parked the hummer outside the shadiest looking club I had ever seen hiding behind a busy street, I jumped out of the car, turning back to Evie. “Stay in the car. “ I threw a blanket over her head, and she made a huffing noise, but didn’t move. “Do not, and I mean DO NOT get out of the car. Keep your head under the blanket.” When the girl didn’t reply, I bit back a frustrated yell. “You have to stay here, okay?”

The lump under the blanket shrugged. “Whatever. I never said I was going to move.” She paused. “Why exactly are we here again?”

I didn’t reply, because even I wasn’t sure.

What I was sure of, however, was the location on the piece of scrap paper.

Seelie.

Interesting name for a club…

When I knocked on the door, which I was surprised to be shut, unlike normal club’s which were open to the public, I found myself facing a “password” situation.

“Password, sweetie.”

A girl’s voice came from the other side, souring my mood.

“Let me in.” I said through my teeth, speaking before I could help myself, a feral snarl escaping my lips. “If you don’t let me in, I will fucking kill you.”

“That’s not the password,” the girl said after a pause. The door opened, revealing a pretty pixie haired woman. “But nice try. Bye now!”

She started to close the door, but I lunged forward, forcing myself between the door and her.  Before I could control what I was doing, I was back inside the game—and a girl was standing in front of me holding her knife to my throat. Just like in the memory, I lunged out, gripping the girl by her neck and squeezing. 

I couldn’t control my limbs, my hands, as they cinched around her throat, ready to wring her neck given the command. “I said I need to talk to someone,” I said stiffly. I could sense Astrid’s voice in my mind ordering me to snap her neck. 

I didn’t. 

I let her go and pasted a smile on my face.

“Please.”
