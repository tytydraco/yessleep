My name is James. I’m writing this because enough time has passed, and I’m finally ready to talk about what happened that awful night on Halloween in 2012 — a night carved into my memory like a twisted Jack o’ lantern. For thirteen years, it’s haunted me. And honestly, I’m too tired to carry that weight anymore.

Not that you’ll believe what I’m about to tell you. Hell, there was a time I wouldn’t have believed it myself.

Most small towns have a local legend — a story meant to keep kids out of the woods after dark. My town’s legend was The Tale of the Tattered Man.

According to the story, years ago a cruel man murdered a Haitian seamstress in a fit of rage. As she lay dying, she clutched a square of cloth — soaked in her own blood. She looked at it, pointed a trembling finger at him, and whispered her final words in defiance: “This is you.” The next morning, the man was found dead in the woods by two police officers. His skin had been perfectly removed — cut into dozens of small, square patches.

They say her curse gave those patches a life of their own. Now, a swarm of sentient, fleshy squares haunt the woods, each one with a tiny, hungry mouth. They hunt together, swarming their victims, biting and latching on until they completely envelop them. The victim dies in shock, consumed — becoming the next host. When you see the Tattered Man walking, you’re not looking at a man at all. You’re looking at the most recent victim — a hollowed-out body wearing a patchwork suit of living, breathing flesh. To see him is to know that someone has just died — and that you’re next.

Everyone in town knew the story. We all laughed about it at least once. Believing in the Tattered Man was seen as childish, kind of like believing in vampires and zombies, or Santa Claus. I used to mock the people who claimed they’d seen him. That is, until that damned Halloween Night in 2012.

To properly explain what happened that night, you’d have to have known Leo.

Leo and I were inseparable since middle school. Leo was the funniest kid I had ever met; he could own any conversation by turning it into a stand-up routine, like the time he gave a report while doing the chicken gag from Super Troopers, “and gmo foods are destroying your health right meow.”

We were both fans of The X-Files. While I watched for entertainment, Leo was taking notes, developing stats for the creatures, and planning how hard it would be to find proof of their existence. This ritual, especially our X-Files marathon on Halloween, became a tradition. That is until the one year we didn’t chill in his room ripping bongs and watching X-Files. And I’ve spent every day since regretting that decision.

It was the summer of 2012 when Leo told me he saw the Tattered Man for the first time. I thought it was a joke. He’d always dismissed the Tattered Man, saying, “it’s no Jersey Devil or Moth man.” But this time, he was serious.

He called me frantically and invited me over. When I walked into his apartment, I could have sworn there had been an actual fire by how cloudy it was. The TV was off, which wasn’t like Leo. I only found him because I saw the orange glow of four lit blunts in his mouth, like a Halloween-themed Audi logo. When I asked him why it was so smoky, it was far too smoky for a few blunts. He pulled the blunts out, smiled crookedly with eyes that looked demonically red, and said, “It was way more than four blunts.”

I laughed so hard at this that his house got me high. When Leo suddenly stopped laughing, I knew the joke was over. He looked at me in a deadpan way and told me that during his free period he went exploring the woods we avoided as children, and he swore he saw the Tattered Man stumbling around. He said the smell coming off of it was so disgusting, he believes it’s as old as the legend suggests.

He asked me if I believed him, and I told him I did, but deep down I thought he was full of shit. He then looked at me with complete sincerity: “Bro, I know all of the stats, I can study this thing. I think this Halloween instead of watching The X-Files again, you and I should try and hunt down the Tattered Man, and if we can’t catch him, at least get solid evidence of his existence.”

What kind of skeptic turns down chasing a monster with their best friend? At the time, I didn’t think it could be dangerous. In my mind, chasing shadows was a fun new twist on a tradition.

The next four months were a blur of classes and preparation. We didn’t watch The X-Files anymore; we studied the Tattered Man, getting high while devising battle plans, armor, and weapons. We spent so much time on the hunt that we both fell behind in classes. I felt the need to help him. These were some of the best days of my life, a bittersweet memory considering what happened next.

On Halloween, Leo wanted to start early. It was bright and sunny when we first got to the woods. We walked the perimeter, scouting and setting traps, stopping only for sandwiches and a joint. We watched over each other as we smoked, getting “fake scared” and having an absolute blast.

It was getting dark the first time Leo told me he saw it, but I didn’t see anything. I was sure he was trying to prank me. After the third or fourth time I looked up to his flashlight beaming at nothing but trees, I stopped looking up when he said he saw it.

I was getting increasingly irritated, certain we were going to leave empty-handed. If I could have seen it once, just one of the times that he saw it, we wouldn’t have even been in the woods anymore.

When Leo told me he saw it again, I snapped. “You know, it’s pretty fucked up that we made this armor and all of these plans just to get out here and the whole time it’s just you trying to scare me.”

I regretted it as soon as I said it, and I know I’m going to regret it for the rest of my life, because it’s the last thing I ever got to say to Leo. At least, I’m pretty sure it’s the last thing he ever heard me say. I could tell by the look he gave me that he not only thought I was an asshole, but he knew I didn’t believe him, that I had never believed him.

He said, “I’ll prove it to you, asshole, I think it’s stuck in one of my traps. Follow me!” and walked off. I followed, but only because I wanted to apologize.

I was trailing behind him when I caught a whiff of the most disgusting smell I’d ever smelled, like rotting meat forgotten for a year. I yelled up to him, and as he turned toward me I expected to see a face full of contempt but what I saw in his eyes was sheer terror as he screamed at me to run.

Then, I felt a pain rush through my arm. It felt like my whole arm had been hit by a hammer that was driving a truck, before a tiny mouth tore into my skin. I looked down and saw a squirming slab of rotten flesh ripping through my armor and boring into my arm.

I ran screaming toward Leo, ripping the nasty square of meat off my arm. As I passed him, I saw that he wasn’t running; he was preparing his camera. I turned around just in time to see the camera flash, which illuminated the monstrous flying swarm of meat that was the Tattered Man. Leo was right. He had finally gotten his proof, but it cost him everything.

I watched, unable to move, as the Tattered Man tore into Leo. His screams will haunt me for the rest of my life. I watched as the swarm covered Leo entirely. To my horror, it walked straight by me, using his body. It was content with him, so it ignored me completely as I stood locked in fear like a deer in headlights.

As I watched the Tattered Man unnaturally jerk past me, I noticed Leo’s camera still swaying on his neck. I decided far too late that it was time to act. I noticed one of Leo’s weapons on the ground: a super soaker full of acid, marked lethal. I sprayed the monster with it from behind, but other than a sizzling sound, it had no effect. I sprayed at it until the gun was dry, but nothing I did could save Leo.

I felt so defeated. Leo and I came to the woods that day to hunt the Tattered Man, but the Tattered Man ended up hunting us both. I called the police, but as I was about to explain everything, I realized how it sounded. I told them he was lost. A search party was launched, and I even went with them, secretly hoping we would find the Tattered Man as a group and somehow overpower it. We never did.

For a while after, life was unbearable, hearing all the theories about what people think happened to Leo. They all hurt because no matter how crazy the theories were, I knew what happened, and knew nobody would ever believe me.

A few years after it happened, I realized that not every year, but once in a while, on Halloween night at around 4 or 5 pm, if I flick on The X-Files by a window, I might catch a short glimpse of the Tattered Man. Multiple times I’ve seen him out there, watching The X-Files with me. Leo was always a good friend, and I guess even in death he still is.

I’m writing this down because I think it will make the next part easier. Tonight is Halloween night, and I’ve had X-Files on for hours. I didn’t feel his presence at all today, but I just caught a whiff of the worst smell I’ve ever smelled in my life, that rotting meat scent, coming from right outside my window.

I think I’m finally ready to step outside.
