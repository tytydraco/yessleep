My name is Jack.

I didn't want to write any of this. I still don't. But it's like something's *making* me. Like every hour I resist, something in the walls presses closer, wet and breathing. The drywall behind me crackles like cartilage. I don't sleep anymore. I just sit at this desk and scrawl down every thought that pours out of my decaying brain. The air is heavier now, like syrup in my lungs. My windows reflect too much, and sometimes I catch forms in them that aren't my own. Maybe it's guilt. Maybe it's mold. Maybe it's him. Watching. Smiling. Whispering something that I can hardly hear unless the house is completely silent.

It started with the tapes.

Six of them. Old VHS tapes strewn like corpses on my porch in a drooping cardboard box smelling of mildew and copper. The kind of smell that clings to old basements or murder scenes—abhorrent, sweet, remembering. I did not even recognize what I was smelling until it hit me later, blood. Not fresh, not red. Old. Oxidized. The kind of smell you do not forget once you have smelled it. And I have. Once.

The labels were handwritten, smeared with a substance that looked like grease but was the color of rust, or dried bile. Each tape bore a single word:

**Ethan.**

Nothing else. In ink that had bled through the label, as though the name had been sweating.

The name hit me like a swallowed stone. Heavy and sharp. Ethan, our Ethan. The one who vanished a year ago like a stain soaking into the floorboards. No one questioned it too much when he did. Hell, some of us were relieved. There was always something \*wrong\* with him. Not in the "he's quiet" way. Not in the "he's just weird" way. In the way that your instincts are yelling at you to get out of the room before the lights go out. He had a way of getting past your defenses, asking you things you didn't know were personal until after you'd already replied. Smiling all the time like he knew a joke you didn't. Like he *was* the joke.

I hated him. Not noisily. Not even in a manner I fully understood then. I just knew that when he was present, I felt my skin didn't fit right. Like I was being flayed. Like if I turned my back, he'd slide into me some way.

There were six of us, then. Me, Ethan, Sydney, Mike, Jason, and Lily. Friends by proximity, not by choice. Strangers who circled each other in the shallow end of some nowhere town with too many churches and not enough room to scream. I suppose we all clung to each other because no one else would. Ethan was the glue, I suppose. Or the rot. He kept us together by knowing just enough to make everyone squirm. It was like he *fed* off that. Secrets, shame, old wounds torn open by some thoughtless comment.

So when he vanished? We didn't look too hard. We didn't burn candles or hang flyers. We just breathed.

And then the tapes came.

The first one played like a memory I never wanted. The screen was full of static that seemed to breathe. No introduction, no time stamp, just \*there.\* A camera. A room. Ethan—just sitting in a chair, not stirring, looking ahead like somebody had nailed his soul down. I don't even want to tell you what else I saw. I'll just say… there was another screen. Someone he knew. Someone we all knew. Someone bound and gagged. And something was waiting to happen, something \*nasty\*. The camera didn't look away. It just waited. It wanted me to see what I wasn't supposed to.

And there was a voice. Not Ethan's. Not human. I turned the tape off before it finished.

But I still catch glimpses of its end. In dreams. In the silence between my heartbeat and the next. Sometimes when I close my eyes I see movement where my eyelids should be dark. I still haven't looked at the other five. They're stacked beside the TV, like bones waiting to be assembled. Mike. Jason. Lily. Sydney. Me.

Yeah. One of them has *my* name on it. I haven't touched it. I'm pretty sure I know what happens if I do. But it's like they *breathe* now. Like they pulse when I'm not looking. Sometimes I swear they're rearranged on the table when I wake up. I haven't left the apartment in three days. I unplugged the TV, but I still hear static sometimes. My reflection doesn't always move when I do.

And this writing—God, this writing. I started with notes, like I was going to tell someone, describe what I found. Now it's a habit. I write without meaning to. My fingers twitch when I'm asleep. I woke up this morning with ink under my fingernails and bruised knuckles like I'd been gripping the pen too hard. Some of the pages in this journal—I don't remember writing them. And the handwriting isn't quite mine. There's something in the corners of my vision now. Watching. Close. Too close.

I think Ethan's in the tape.

And I think he's hungry.

Look, I know how this sounds. If you’re reading this, it means I actually hit "post," which I wasn’t planning to do. But I need someone to see this. To *know*. Just in case. I don’t know what’s happening to me, and I don’t trust my own memory anymore. So I’m putting it here. Maybe it’s a warning. Maybe it’s bait. Maybe it doesn’t matter.

If anyone has questions… I’ll try to answer. Just don’t ask too much. Don’t ask about the *smell.* And if you hear static when you read this, stop reading. I mean it.

I think it notices when you *look too closely.*
