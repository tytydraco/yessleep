You’ve most likely heard of shadow people. Hell, you’ve probably seen them. Maybe you didn’t know what it was but you saw some dark movement out of the corner of your eye. There’s plenty of speculation as to what these things are and even more regarding where they come from. Some say they’re the souls of the dead that refused to go into the light and thus have been plunged into eternal darkness. Others believe they may be extradimensional folk who are native to an entirely different plane of existence. Well, I’m here to set the record straight. There are indeed dark spirits that resemble human shadows and they are the remnants of people who died, but what if I told you that some of them are very much alive? I can sense your disbelief. I understand that, but I’m one of them. Let me explain.

Some of my earliest memories go as far back to my infancy. I’m not sure if it’s just a side effect of what I am or perhaps maybe my ability to do so is what made me susceptible in the first place. That doesn’t matter. Regardless, ever since the earliest of years after I was born, I could see them. Now, I know it is believed that children are able to see much more than meets the more mature eye, but believe me when I say it’s only ever been the shadow people I’ve seen. Maybe once or twice I’ve thought I’d seen an apparition or experienced some other paranormal occurrence. However, I had never considered them part of the same category. To me, they were just a normal part of life as I’d come to know it. I would see them mostly at night when the light in my nursery was just enough to allow my eyes to adjust.

I’m sure you’ve experienced something similar to what I’m about to describe. You stare into the darkest corner of your room at night and the longer you stare, things begin to happen. You’ll feel as if the darkness is growing larger or coming closer while simultaneously, the world in your periphery grows darker as if it’s spreading… or maybe you’re being drawn into it. It’s hard to tell which is which because it’s such a fascinating yet anxious feeling. It feels like you can’t decide whether it’s just your eyes trying to adjust fully or if you’re drifting into a different place altogether. If you know what I’m talking about then you’re going to be better prepared for what I’m about to share. You’re about to learn what happens if a certain set of conditions are met at the same time concerning those dark spots. They’re not just areas that are the most absent of light, oh no. They are something much more than that and yet… they’re nothing at all. Well, at least not as far as reality is concerned.

Imagine if you will that you are laying in your bed. You’re having trouble sleeping to the point where your mind is just so restless that you find it hard to close your eyes. You look around your dark room and you see it. In the corner of your room is what appears to be a small black mass of shadow. It look as if that section of your walls and ceiling were just erased to reveal nothing but an endless, lightless void beyond. These thoughts enter your mind because you realize you’re staring into something that resembles nonexistence. You feel the world around you darken. You can feel a change but you aren’t sure whether it’s all in your head or if you’ve tapped into something you should try to look away from. You feel the urge to look somewhere else so you do. Your eyes wander away and you look at the door of your closet. You think to yourself, “I should probably not do that again,” but it’s too late. You’re staring into it again. This time it’s stronger and you can’t look away no matter how hard you might try. This time it feels as if you’re being pulled towards it, however, you can feel your body remain where it is.

It’s not you that’s being beckoned but something within you that won’t let you sleep because it’s awake now. It has been asleep for far too long and it’s tired of watching you waste your life on interactions with the rest of the world. At least these are the thoughts that enter your mind as you stare into the abyss. Or are you entering the thoughts? Are they even your own thoughts? Are you the one looking into it or are you the one being looked into? Were you ever real or is this all just some sort of series of fleeting thoughts in an infinite maelstrom of potentialities where all that is certain is the realization that nothing has even been manifested into reality yet and you are nothing more than a fragment of something that is somehow conscious enough to think? It doesn’t matter. Nothing matters. Nothing has ever mattered because nothing is real except the knowledge that reality is nothing and always has been and never will be.
