I’ve been wanting to get this off my chest for a while. This seems a welcoming environment for me to share this information with, so here goes.

Last month, I killed my neighbor. I tried to keep it as clean as I could, so that he didn’t suffer. I keep him in a large freezer I used to keep my deer meat in. I’ve been debating for a long time what to do with the body.

You see, I never really hated him. He just happened to be in the wrong place, in the wrong time. He has very little connections, lives nearly off-the-grid, and lives within walking distance to me. I don’t normally invite people over, so he was a little curious when I asked him. Ah well, that’s all over now. My knife is long gone.

The question now is: What do I do? I’ve done it, I’ve gotten away with it, but he’s not dead. He’s here! In my freezer!

Although, I keep wondering just how dead he really is.

When I pop open the freezer to check on him, sometimes I’ll find his eyes wide open staring at me. I hate that. It makes it feel like worms are pouring out of them and crawling up my arm. So, I’ll quickly just shut them again and close the lid. That’s one of my questions for you all. Is that a normal thing about human bodies? They can open their eyes after death? I know about rigor mortis and all, but it really freaks me out.

One time I went in the garage and I found the freezer lid open. That made my heart thump. I was worried his body would be ruined!

But when I checked, he was still there. His clothes were messy though, like he had shifted in his sleep. I fixed them up and closed the lid again, relieved that the body was still in my freezer.

Now that I’m thinking about it, there was another weird thing that happened. I think it was a dream, but one time I saw him standing. He was just outside the back door to the garage. He was facing wherever his house is beyond the trees and the hills, up the road. I called his name but he didn’t answer me. Not vocally.

He shambled around to face me, falling against the door frame before he steadied himself up again. I peered into those glassy, unblinking eyes curiously. We just stood there watching each other. “Greg?” I called his name.

That name apparently meant nothing to him, for he didn’t budge at all. I offered him the glass of water, a glass I forgot I was carrying. He took it, but I don’t really know what was wrong with him, because when he took it the glass shattered onto the floor. He had cuts all over his hand. I went and got some paper towels to press on his hand before I got some bandages. He stood still and watched me work on him. His lips kept opening and closing, like he was thinking about saying something. Or he was hungry. I don't know, I was trying not to look at him too much. His yellowing skin and loose flesh were making me feel uncomfortable.

So, not long after, I gave him the leftovers I hadn’t yet thrown away from my dinner. He ate the plate too.

Eventually I left because I felt woozy and went back to bed. The next day, I found glass on the floor and when I checked on him in the freezer his hands were still bandaged.

I don’t know if I was sleepwalking. Maybe he was? I’m not sure, I just needed to get this out of my chest. I’m sure someone could understand my plight, and help me find something to do with this body.
