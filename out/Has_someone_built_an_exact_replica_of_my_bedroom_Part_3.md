I nearly crushed the plastic bottle in my fist, choking on my own spit. It was only a single soft knock, but in the heavy silence, it sounded like a sledgehammer. I sat frozen, eyes glued to the door, barely daring to breathe.

A second knock, just as soft. Then a third, and a fourth—and then it just kept going. I dropped the bottle on the nightstand, mind spinning.

The knocking grew more intense by the second, soon making the door rattle in its frame. I was off the bed now, frantically searching for anything I could use to defend myself, but I came up empty. There just wasn't anything in this stupid room!

My panic spiked with every booming thud. In blind terror, I yanked a drawer out of the dresser, sending socks flying everywhere. I held it up like a protest sign, facing the door, trembling and whimpering.

The knocking stopped. Deafening silence swallowed the room. Then a fist exploded through the door, splinters and chips of wood spraying in all directions.

I yelped and dropped the drawer, missing my foot by a hair. I scuttled into the corner, barely registering the cut I picked up on the way.

The fist just hovered there, everything beyond the elbow lost in darkness. It looked like a normal human hand—except it was scorched and peeling like overcooked meat.

I tried to fuse myself into the corner, to *become* the damn corner. Anything to escape whatever was behind that door. It took every ounce of willpower not to black out. And still, the fist lingered there. It must’ve stayed that way for at least a minute before I finally let some of the tension slip from my body. I wiped a trickle of sweat off my brow.

Just as I was about to peel myself off the wall, the fist opened and reached for the doorknob.

In a mindless surge of panic, I lunged forward, snatched the dresser drawer from where I’d dropped it, lifted it high, and slammed it down on the hand with all the force I could muster. The drawer shattered into pieces, leaving me clutching a lonely chunk of wood.

Whoever the hand belonged to didn’t seem the least bit impressed. Unbothered, it kept twisting the doorknob—and then the door flew open.

I barely had time to process the figure in front of me before its hand shot out and clamped around my neck. I was hoisted off my feet, my windpipe squeezed shut, not one gasp of air going in or out.

I dropped the remains of the drawer and clawed at the vise-like fingers around my throat, unable to loosen their grip. I kicked out wildly and even landed a few hits, but I might as well have been kicking a streetlamp. All the while, I stared into the lifeless eyes of my clone. Its face was blistered, charred, and bizarrely stretched in places—yet unmistakably my own.

My vision was going black around the edges, but my clone didn’t seem inclined to let me slip into unconsciousness. Its mouth gaped open, wider and wider—impossibly wide, like a grotesque, humanoid snake.

I heard sickening cracks as the vertebrae in its neck snapped and contorted, stretching its head closer to mine. Its jaws spread wider still, until I could feel the warmth of its breath on my cheeks. I lost control of my bladder then.

Its head surged forward, and suddenly everything went dark. A wet maw sealed over my face. Saliva trickled down my cheeks, a probing tongue slithering across my nose and lips.

The creature pressed harder, its lips slowly wrapping around my skull. I felt teeth scraping across my scalp, then digging into my neck. Pain spiked through me and snapped me back from the brink of oblivion.

And then, just as my clone seemed ready to bite clean through, it vanished into thin air.

With nothing left to hold me up, I crumpled to the floor, gasping for air. I rubbed frantically at my neck, half-convinced it was gone, sobbing and blubbering like an infant. I had never been this terrified in my life. I couldn’t take any more.

It's genuinely amazing the kind of shit you *can* take given enough time, because at some point the tears dried up, and I was able to pick myself up from the floor. I felt utterly drained, both physically and mentally.

I staggered back to my bed and collapsed. I was asleep in seconds.

Incredibly enough, my tormentor let me wake up at my own pace. I opened my eyes, gazing at the ceiling and savouring a brief moment of peace. But not even sleep’s reprieve could convince me that I’d dreamed it all. This wasn’t over.

I sat up and calmly took in the disaster scattered across the floor. I felt a bit steadier now, though not just because I’d been granted some shuteye. In my mind, the simple fact that I wasn’t dead yet had one cheerful implication: I wasn’t *meant* to die. The flaw in that logic wouldn’t hit me until much later, but for the time being, I reveled in the fragile sense of relief.

When I set my feet on the ground, I hissed through my teeth. I checked my soles and found several cuts on both, streaked with dried blood. No glass shards embedded, thankfully. It didn’t look like it ought to hurt as much as it did, but I figured I’d be fine.

My piss-soaked pants had dried, but there was no way I’d walk around in them a minute longer. I stripped down and pulled on another set of fresh clothes, cringing at the smell. It couldn’t be helped. Wasting water on hygiene didn’t seem smart.

The bedroom door stood open, splinters jutting from the hole punched through it. The corridor still yawned, clearly beckoning me. I reached for my phone on the bed, switched on the torch, and aimed it down the hallway. Part of me was almost disappointed to find nothing out of the ordinary. I paused for only a second, then started walking again.

After learning the hard way that my bedroom wasn’t a safe zone anymore, I had zero interest in sitting around waiting for the next act of this cosmic shitshow. I’d rather meet it head-on, even if it meant risking a heart attack. If that makes me sound uncharacteristically badass, don’t be fooled. I was still shivering with fear.

My poor heart did jump into my throat the instant I stepped into the corridor, when the door slammed shut behind me.

I spun around—only to find a dead end. The door to my bedroom had disappeared, replaced by more of those smug-ass flowers.

Okay, fuck it, I thought wildly. No turning back then. Not that I’d planned to, anyway.

I kept moving at a brisk pace. Focusing on the rapid rhythm of my steps helped steady my nerves and kept the pain in my feet to a low, even throb. With my attention thus diverted, it took me a while to realise I’d been subtly leaning back—as if walking down a gentle decline.

Was the corridor slanting downward? Everything around me still looked perfectly level. What the hell was going on?

I stopped cold. It was barely noticeable, but the entire corridor was gradually tilting forward, even as I stood still.

A fresh wave of panic swept over me. What if it didn’t stop? I’d go tumbling down the corridor like a kid leaning too far into a dried-up well, smashing every bone in my body.

I scanned the walls for something to grab, fully aware of how pointless that was. I fought the urge to run back towards my nonexistent bedroom, knowing it’d only increase my distance from whatever was about to become the bottom. So I skidded and stumbled ahead, but once the slope grew steep enough to knock me off my feet, any shred of logic left me. I scrambled back on my butt, only managing a few metres before I started slipping forward.

I screamed and wailed as I was dragged inexorably into the abyss. My phone slipped out of my hand, and I watched in horror as it went tumbling through the air, bouncing off the floor and walls. I kept sliding in complete darkness, which was so much fucking worse.

By sheer luck, I wasn’t dead center in the corridor but closer to the left-hand wall. Otherwise, it might’ve been the end of me. Just as the slope tipped forward enough to leave me airborne, my feet slammed into something solid, sending lightning bolts of pain up my legs.

I howled and lurched sideways, my foot landing on nothing. With a desperate gasp, I twisted as I fell, crashing my upper body into the far side of the doorway I’d burst through earlier. My legs dangled, kicking wildly as I scrabbled for anything to hold onto along the narrow stretch of wall beside the doorframe. More than once, my grip nearly failed me, but by some miracle I managed to haul myself up.

My phone had fallen through the doorway, so I was left in pitch blackness. At least the damn rotation seemed to have stopped. I stood there with my back jammed against the wall, panting like a dog, afraid to move for fear of taking a wrong step. My ankles hurt like a mother, but they still carried my weight, so I guessed they weren’t broken.

What the fuck was I supposed to do now? I felt utterly helpless, squirming under the thumb of whoever was pulling the strings here. How much longer was this nightmare going to drag on? I wanted it over so badly—one way or another. Just let it be over already.

A faint glow started creeping up from below. I was still too scared to move, so I just stood there, waiting for whatever fresh hell was on the way. It wasn’t like I could do shit about it anyway.

Finally, something floated through the door. It kept rising until it was a metre or two overhead, then hung there as if tied to an invisible string.

I squinted up against the glare and realised it was my bloody phone, torch pointing straight down into the doorway. I let out a snort of contempt. Apparently, whatever was up next wouldn’t hit as hard if I couldn’t see it properly.

A distant sound drifted up through the hole, turning my blood to ice. It was that same horrifying keening I’d heard during my first encounter with my clone. My brain screamed at me to ignore it, to stay right where I was, but my body refused to listen. Moving slowly, I leaned forward, palms pressed to the wall as if that might somehow keep me anchored. Then I peeked over the edge of the doorframe.

Despite everything that had already happened, I could not believe what I was seeing.

It was my demonic twin again. Only its distorted face was visible, glaring up at me from far below and unleashing those godawful noises. Its charred flesh was crammed against the corridor walls—top to bottom, left to right—mouth stretched open as wide as it would go. The creature’s head took up so much space that the surrounding walls cracked and splintered under its bulk. 

It was slowly hauling itself upwards, laying waste to the corridor as it climbed.

One of its bulging eyes was skewered on a jagged chunk of plaster. I gagged as the eyeball split open, oozing gunk down its blistered face.

I kept gawking at the monstrous face coming at me, unable to retreat, unable even to squeeze my eyes shut. Something compelled me to take in every detail of my impending demise, every second of my clone inching closer. It was climbing faster now, like a piranha zeroing in on fresh meat, its shrieks battling with the sound of the walls exploding apart.

And then, with one final, tremendous lurch, it was upon me. It crashed through the doorway, hurling me into the air, my limbs flailing wildly.

I screamed in terror. It felt like ages before gravity finally caught up, sending me tumbling towards the gaping maw.

I smacked face-first onto the creature’s enormous, writhing tongue, soaking me in saliva. It curled inwards, shoving me deeper down its throat. Teeth snapped shut behind me with a nauseating crack. Everything went black again, and searing heat pressed in around me. The creature kept pushing me with its tongue, its gullet working in revolting, wet gulps.

My mind went blank. I’m pretty sure something inside me snapped right then—something no shrink on earth could ever put back together. Maybe that’s for the best, because I have no memory of what happened next. Safe to say I wasn’t actually devoured, though, as the next thing I remember is staring up at the ceiling from my bed… back in my bedroom again.
