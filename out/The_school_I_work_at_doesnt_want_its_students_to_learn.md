I started working at a small private school in a tiny town this year. So tiny, in fact, that when you look up the school online, it lists the neighboring town instead. At first, everything seemed perfect. The students were polite, the funding was generous, and parents donated more than you could possibly imagine. I kept telling myself I’d finally found a good job - steady, safe, normal.

I know I should be grateful for this opportunity, and I probably shouldn't even be writing this, but something just feels off.

The drive to work is the first sign something's wrong. There's this long, narrow road with thick trees on either side. Every morning I pass under these branches that twist together and almost form eye shapes. It sounds silly, but it feels like they're watching me. I know that doesn't make sense. They're just trees. But there's never anyone else around, and in that silence, those shapes start to feel deliberate.

When I finally arrive on campus after that unnerving drive, the school itself doesn't offer much relief. Even with all the money pouring into this place, the buildings feel run down. The hallways are chipped and scuffed, there are cobwebs in the corners, and the floors stick in odd spots. It’s like a school full of children from families who could buy anything, but somehow it’s slowly being forgotten.

The isolation doesn't stop at the tree line, either. There's no cell reception anywhere on campus, inside or out, so the only way to stay connected is through the school's network. It makes everything feel cut off, like we exist in our own little world that the rest of society can't reach.

What bothers me more than the buildings or the dead zones, though, are the students themselves. They're amazing athletes, near-prodigies in the arts, and could debate with a grown adult without even breaking a sweat. But they can't read a basic sentence, and when I talk about history, they either have no idea what I'm saying or get the facts completely wrong. The longer I stay here, the more it feels like the school is designed to keep them talented and obedient but mostly uneducated.

It sounds crazy, I know. A school deliberately keeping its students in the dark? Surely someone would have said something years ago.

That's when I started noticing the pattern. Most of the staff are alumni, and most of the students are children of alumni. I'm sure the adults know exactly what's going on. And yet somehow, here I am, a music teacher with no connections to the school, feeling like I stepped into something I shouldn't have.

Maybe it's the isolation getting to me, or maybe I'm finally seeing clearly, but there are things happening here that I can't explain. The students sometimes know things about me they shouldn't. They whisper in corners and stop when I walk by. Sometimes I swear I hear footsteps behind me in empty hallways, or see shadows moving just outside the classroom windows, but when I look, there's nothing there.

I keep thinking about how powerful these kids' families are, not just politically but across the state, controlling land and businesses and whatever else. It's like the school is their little playground, and no one else is allowed to understand how it really works.

Last week, I started noticing my classroom door open when I was sure I’d locked it. I keep telling myself I’m being paranoid. And today, one of my students left a drawing on my desk after class. It was a picture of me, sitting at my kitchen table. The details were too accurate. The crack in the wall behind me, the specific mug I use for coffee, even the way my curtains hang.

I live alone. My address isn't listed anywhere public.

And my kitchen window faces the woods.
