I’m going to start this by saying I really have no idea what’s going to happen now. I’m not even sure why I’m telling you all this, but here I am, writing down the most insane shit I’ve ever experienced. Maybe it’s to warn you, or maybe it’s because at this point, it’s the only thing I can do to hold on to what’s left of my sanity. Either way, you need to know. So, buckle up. If you think this is going to be some neat little tech story about some gadgets or breakthrough devices, you’re in for a surprise. This is not that. 

I’m in a nightmare. And I am the one who created it.

Let’s rewind to where it all started. You’ve probably heard of NeuroSync, right? If you haven’t, you’ve been living under a rock, or you’ve been too busy binge-watching reality TV. NeuroSync isn’t just a company; it’s a revolution in the making, at least, that’s what they kept telling us. I wasn’t just some cog in the wheel—no, I was part of something that could change the world. You know the type of hype that gets you all hot and bothered, like some kind of Steve Jobs-level prophecy. And yeah, I drank the Kool-Aid. I had to, or I wouldn’t have been hired in the first place.

NeuroSync’s latest project was called **NeuroLink**. They weren’t just creating another app that syncs with your phone to remind you when to breathe or drink water. No, they were creating something that could actually tap into the deepest parts of your mind. Imagine this: a set of earbuds, but they’re not just for music. These bad boys connect to your subconscious. Your *dreams*. They were marketed as a tool for lucid dreaming, where you could literally control your dreams. Think about that for a second. No more of those weird, nonsensical dreams where you’re naked in public or getting chased by someone you don’t even know. You could *choose* the dream, shape it, direct it.

At first, it seemed like a joke. Sure, we could do all that with our minds, but tech and dreams? That’s like trying to program your brain to be a computer, right? But then, I saw it. I saw the first prototype, and it didn’t just work. It *worked*—like, really well. The dreamscape wasn’t just a controlled environment; it was almost...real. The sensations, the colors, the *feelings*...it was like entering another world. At first, we tested it on ourselves, naturally. I mean, I had to. It was my project, my baby. 

Max Harris, the guy who’s about to change the world of human consciousness.

We went through the usual "first tests are always glitchy" phase. It was clunky, sure, but not unexpected. Some people couldn’t get the device to connect properly. Others, like me, found the experience jarring at first. It wasn’t just controlling your dreams; it was controlling *everything* your mind could create. But as the weeks went by, it started to get smoother. And then...well, that’s when things started to go south.

There was this one guy, Greg. He was one of the beta testers, just some random guy who signed up for the program. He was a photographer, into the whole deep-dive, inner-exploration thing. He was excited about the possibilities—maybe even more than I was. He hit me up after a couple of days, all enthusiastic, talking about how the dreamscape was incredible. He said he was having lucid dreams like he’d never had before, and he was controlling every little thing. It seemed pretty standard. Everyone else had the same thing to say. Until he didn’t.

I’ll never forget the voicemail he sent. He wrote it like it was just another check-in, but you could feel it in his words. There was something off. Something was gnawing at him. 

"Max." I could sense that he was shivering through his voice. "There’s something weird going on with these dreams. I thought I was controlling everything, but there's this...shadow. It's been following me for the last two nights. It’s not part of the dream, man. It’s real. I can’t get rid of it. Let me know if this is I should be worried about, man. Call me when you can."

At first, I thought it was just an anomaly. A glitch. Or maybe some kind of weird personal anxiety playing out in his subconscious. But Greg wasn’t the only one. More people started coming in with the same thing: a dark, faceless figure that just *hung around* in the periphery of their dreams. And that’s when the red flags started popping up like fireworks on the Fourth of July.

I don’t even know how to explain this part, because I’m not even sure I believe it myself. But I’ll tell you what happened anyway. I connected to the NeuroLink system for the first time in weeks. I hadn’t really needed to—everything seemed to be running fine, so why mess with something that wasn’t broken? But when I logged in, the atmosphere was different. Almost oppressive. It was like I was walking into a room where everyone had just been fighting. 

And then, I saw *it*. That figure. 

It was there, just standing in the corner of my dream. Not moving, but it felt like it was staring straight at me, like it knew me. And in that moment, I felt something I had never felt before. A cold, creeping terror.

I tried to shake it off, like, *Come on, Max, it’s just a dream, right? You’re in control.* But I wasn’t. The longer I stared at that thing, the more *real* it became. I tried to move, tried to wake up, but nothing happened. My heart was pounding in my chest, but my body refused to respond. And that’s when I heard it. A voice, low and raspy, like it was coming from the very fabric of the dream itself.

"Max…"

It wasn’t my voice. I didn’t say it. But I felt it in my bones. I could feel the weight of those words pressing down on me, like they were carved into the back of my mind. The thing—this *entity*, whatever it was—stepped closer, slowly, and then everything went black.

I woke up, my heart hammering, sweat drenched in fear, but I wasn’t in control. I was still *there*. Stuck in the dream.

I know this sounds crazy. I know it. But I *felt* it. That thing, that shadow, was aware. And worse, it was *me*. I didn’t know it then, but that’s the only way I can describe it now. There was this sudden shift, like my dream had turned against me. I tried to wake up, but I couldn’t. My mind was *stuck*. I thought it was just a glitch in the system. A problem with the device. But the testers weren’t experiencing glitches anymore. They were experiencing *things*. And they weren’t the good things.

That’s when I started to panic. I mean, I had always been the guy in control, right? The one who fixed things. The guy who had all the answers. But now? I was just another freaked-out tester, stuck in the system. Worse, I wasn’t alone. The other testers were experiencing the same thing, and they were scared. The feedbacks were flooding in, each one more desperate than the last. Greg’s? He had stopped responding to our emails and calls altogether. 

And that’s when I realized something. I wasn’t just creating the dreamscape. I was *living* it. And I wasn’t the only one.

I couldn’t stop thinking about how we’d built NeuroLink. We had studied lucid dreaming techniques, sure, but we also dug into the deep subconscious. We didn’t just want people to control their dreams—we wanted to *tap* into the places that were beyond consciousness, the places where your mind goes when you’re not aware of it. And in doing so, we might have opened something we couldn’t close.

I didn’t realize it at first, but the more I started to think about the dreamscape and the more I dug into the device, the more I realized I wasn’t just designing tech that let people "control" their dreams. I wasn’t just tinkering with how the mind works, I was *breaking into it*. And there’s a difference between the two. Breaking into something isn’t the same as controlling it. When you break into something, you risk disturbing things you aren’t meant to touch. You risk opening doors that should remain closed.

Let me tell you about a moment that changed everything for me. I was in the middle of a meeting with the team, still trying to act like everything was fine. They were asking me about the latest round of feedback, the general performance of the device, whether we’d ironed out all the bugs. It was just another normal day—or at least it *should* have been. But I couldn’t stop thinking about what I’d seen. That figure. That *thing* that was always there, lurking in the corners of my dream. It wasn’t just haunting me anymore. It was haunting everyone.

"Max," Greg had said in his last voicemail, "It’s not just a glitch. It’s not just a bug. I feel like something's *watching me*. I’m scared, man."

And that scared me. Because it was *exactly* what I had been feeling. The thing had been watching me too. But worse, it felt like it knew me, like it was hunting me. Like it was calling to me, trying to drag me deeper into whatever this place was.

Anyway, so there I was, sitting in the meeting room, trying to ignore the fact that I was still tethered to this nightmare world. "Max," Lila, one of the project leads, called me out. "Did you hear me?"

I blinked, momentarily startled. "Uh, sorry. I was just... lost in thought."

Lila raised an eyebrow. She wasn’t fooled. "What’s going on, Max? You’re distracted. More than usual."

I forced a smile, but it felt more like a grimace. "Nothing. Just...thinking about the best way for us to be dealing with that bug. No big deal."

I had to keep it together, right? I couldn’t let the team see what was happening. If they figured out that this was more than just a bug, they’d pull the plug on everything. No one would understand that this wasn’t just some technical glitch. This was...*something else*. Something that was breaking into the very fabric of reality itself.

But that’s when it hit me. I couldn’t shake the thought. The more I thought about the entity, about that cold, faceless shadow that stalked the edges of my dreams, the more I realized something. The entity *wasn’t* just a mistake. It wasn’t some freak accident. It was a manifestation of my *own* mind, or at least, that’s what I started to believe. This was my *brain’s* way of telling me that I’d gone too far.

I know how this sounds, but stick with me for a second. I had always assumed that dreams were just... random, right? I mean, they didn’t make sense. They were supposed to be a mishmash of everything that happened during the day, our brain’s way of sorting through all the junk we didn’t need. But the more I thought about it, the more it became clear: Dreams weren’t random. *They had a purpose*. And maybe, just maybe, they were our brain’s way of creating boundaries, of keeping us from *breaking* our own consciousness.

You see, I started to realize that the dreamscape wasn’t just some shared space. It wasn’t like we were all in different rooms or using separate VR headsets. No. We were all in *the same place*. Our minds, our subconscious, all bleeding into one another. I don’t know how or why, but the more people I talked to, the more I began to see the same thing. The dreamscape was not a personal, individual space—it was a shared dimension. And that’s when I had the thought that scared the shit out of me: What if this isn’t just a lucid dream? What if dreams are *another dimension* altogether? A place our conscious minds can’t comprehend because they’re too tied to the laws of reality we live in. But when we sleep... when we dream... that’s when we step into a different world. One where time doesn’t work the same way, where the rules of reality are completely thrown out the window.

And this entity? The one I kept seeing in the corners of my mind? It wasn’t just some figment of imagination. It was *our subconscious mind* trying to warn us. It was our brain’s way of telling us, "Don’t go too far. Don’t dig too deep, or you’ll break something."

I should’ve figured it out sooner. I should’ve paid more attention to the warnings in the feedbacks by my testers. The first test subject to reach out to me after they started seeing the entity was Greg. He’d been in the dream longer than most of us, exploring, pushing the limits. And that’s when I realized: The deeper we went into the dreamscape, the more powerful the entity became. It was growing, feeding on our fear and confusion. It wasn’t just trying to scare us—it was trying to *protect* us. From ourselves.

I don’t know when it happened, but at some point, I stopped caring about whether or not I was in control of my dreams. I stopped caring about being the one to fix the bugs. All I could think about was getting out. Getting *away*. But the more I tried to escape, the more the thing followed me. Every corner, every turn—it was always there. Watching. Waiting. And the worst part? It felt like it knew me. Like it was me.

I think I’ve figured it out now. I’ve pieced it together, but it’s too late. I was the one who went too far. I pushed the boundaries of human consciousness, thinking I could control it, thinking I could unlock something incredible. But now, every time I close my eyes, I’m trapped in that endless, terrifying void. I don’t even need the NeuroLink device anymore to send me to that hellscape. The connection, the gateway—it’s permanent. And once it passes all the regulations, once it becomes accessible to you all, whatever monstrosity I’m facing will be waiting for you too. There’s no escaping it.

I’m doing everything I can to stop it, trying to cause enough disruption, enough problems, to make my company pull the plug on this damnable project. But I’m starting to realize the truth—I'm going to fail. I can feel it in my bones. No one would believe me, and even if they did, they’d just label me a madman. So I’m stuck, alone in this nightmare I’ve helped create. 

I honestly don’t know how long I’ve been writing this. Time has become a blur, and to be honest, I’m not even sure if I’m still awake. But there’s one thing I know for certain: if I don’t find a way to end this, I’ll be stuck here forever. And one day, maybe... I won’t wake up at all. And neither will any of you. Because if this place is truly another dimension—if dreams are a separate world of their own—then we’re all connected now, trapped together in this endless loop. And I’m starting to believe that none of us will ever make it out.

I don’t know what the fuck to do, and that’s the scariest part. I’m still not sure what’s happening, or if I’ll make it out of this vicious cycle. So, here’s my warning to you: If you ever get the chance to use something like NeuroLink, to step into that dreamscape—*don’t*. Because once you cross that line, there’s no going back. You’ll be lost in a world you can’t escape. And when you try to run...that thing, that entity, it will be right behind you, always. Watching. Waiting. For you to finally crack.

So, let’s see what happens. Maybe you’ll know what to do when this post goes live. Or maybe you’ll just think I’m another crazy tech guy who couldn’t handle the pressure. Either way, this is the story of how I created a nightmare, and I don’t know how to wake up from it.

But I’ll try.
