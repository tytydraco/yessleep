Hey everyone.  
It’s Matteo again.  
Or what’s left of me, anyway.

If you read my last post about the “research mission” in Sweden, you know most of it already.   
You know what I saw under the ice. You know about the thing that, at minimum, remembers being an angel. I thought the worst part was over when I got back to Rome. I was wrong.

\---

Two days ago, shortly after I made my previous post, I received a hand-delivered letter.

Same red wax seal, same Vatican crest, except this time there was another mark pressed beneath it, as if it had been stamped before the Vatican crest was stamped over it: a faint triangle inside a circle.

***“Return immediately for debriefing regarding the disappearance of Sister Lucia.”***

No signature.  
When I arrived, they didn’t take me to any office; I was led through a maze of corridors I had never seen before, and down a spiral staircase that delved deep beneath the city. I was brought into a dimly lit room. Within the room were two other people, one whom I recognized as my Bishop, and another man that I did not recognize, but seemed to be wearing a lab coat. My blood froze in my veins when I noticed the now familiar insignia emblazoned on the left breast pocket of the lab coat-wearing man. A triangle, with a circle surrounding it, touching at the three points.

"Sit, Matteo. We have much to discuss," my Bishop began, a grave look on his face, "This is Dr. Kruger, he oversees the facility where you were sent recently, and has brought some disturbing allegations against you." He finished.  
  
Dr. Kruger smiled slyly and turned a laptop to face me.  "We have evidence to suggest that you were directly involved in Lucia's disappearance," he said, poison dripping from every word.

They showed me camera footage, presumably from the morning of my departure from Sweden. It showed the van that had picked us up from and dropped us back off at the airport, dropping *three* people back off, instead of just two. The camera feed switched to show another angle. This time, I could see the three figures walking down an otherwise empty terminal before the two on the outside grabbed the one in the middle and pulled them into a maintenance service door. The footage fast-forwarded, showing only two figures walking out.

In the video, it looked like Father Gabriel and I were responsible for Lucia’s disappearance.

I was unable to speak. The rage building in me had almost reached a fever pitch when the Dr. continued.

"The other person of interest, whom you may know as Father Gabriel, has already agreed to cooperate with us in this 'investigation,'” he said, “It would be in your best interest to do the same. If you refuse, your Church will denounce you publicly. You’ll spend the rest of your life in a prison cell. Or worse, in one of ours.” 

I looked to my Bishop for any sign of understanding, instead, I saw him looking at the floor, seemingly unable to make eye contact with me.

Then Dr. Kruger slid a folder across the table. Inside: a plane ticket north, and a single phrase typed on Vatican letterhead, with a wall of blacked-out text beneath it.

***“Theta-7 - Reactivation phase.”***

The Dr. and I departed that night.

\---

***"It looks like I'm headed back to Heaven."***

 I thought to myself. I told myself I accepted because I wanted answers, but the truth is, I accepted because I was afraid; I had no doubt that they would be capable of framing me with the disappearance, and even less doubt that they would dispose of me at a moment's notice, if I didn't comply.

They flew me in under the same gray sky and drove me down the same road back to that same blasphemous mountain.

The sign on the road was still there, but this time it read slightly differently:

***“Welcome to Heaven, permanent population: 3.”***

The gate, which had already looked foreboding, now had a guard stationed on either side of it. Each guard was holding a rifle, and at their hip hung something that looked similar to the small metal detectors that one would see in an airport, being used by security, only these were seemingly coated in a shiny silver paint.

Inside, the chapel was rebuilt. The ice beneath the glass had been fully refrozen, and additional metal rings and wiring were installed within it. In the center of the chapel, surrounding the podiums where Gabriel, Lucia, and I once stood, was a snake of thick black wires, trailing out into the center of each wall of the room except the one that the door was on. Beyond the glass, I could see what appeared to be three metallic spheres, pulsating gently in a familiar pattern... Three pulses, a pause, then three pulses.

Erik met me in the hallway, thermos in hand. He looked thinner than before, eyes sunken, movements slower, as if the air itself weighed down upon him.

“Didn’t think they’d send you back,” he said.

“Didn’t think I had a choice,” I replied.

A familiar voice came from behind me. “None of us did, kid.”

I turned and saw that Father Gabriel was standing at the end of the corridor, wearing the same threadbare coat as before, chewing away at his gum as usual. He looked worse than I remembered—hair gone gray, eyes sharp but hollow.

“They brought you back too?” I asked.

“Apparently the prodigal sons get round-trip tickets now, but I'm sure you know it wasn't a first-class seat.” he said with a bitter laugh.

Erik sighed. “Both of you, keep your voices down. The mountains have ears, you know, and we're inside of one right now.”

He led us deeper into the facility, towards what I knew would be our new homes.

\---

Our quarters were in the same wing as before, though locks on the outside of the doors had been installed since our last visit. I guess what Gabriel said the first time we saw this place wasn't as far off as we had originally thought. Like before, the wing had three doors. Our two doors were open, but the third one was closed.

We were locked in our *cells* for the night. A lone guard patrolled outside our rooms, carrying an identical loadout to the ones guarding the front gate. My mind lingered on the strange silver device slung similar to how a nightstick would be on a police officer's belt. I thought to ask, but I doubt I would have received a proper answer.

That night, a folded slip of paper appeared under both our doors. No signature, just a symbol drawn in graphite: three concentric circles crossed vertically to the middle by a single line, with a solid circle in the very center.

And four words written beneath it:

***“The First Has Heard."***

\---

The next morning, Dr. Kruger assembled everyone in the rebuilt chapel. He stood on the balcony like a general surveying a battlefield. Erik watched from a console below, expression unreadable. A sphere, similar to the ones embedded in the walls but smaller, sat alongside us in the center of the floor, pulsing the same pattern as the others.

“Today we resume resonance testing,” Kruger announced. “Fathers Matteo and Gabriel, as well as RDC-L-A will serve as focal conduits.”



Gabriel muttered, “Guess that’s our fancy new job title. Could have just labeled us 'bait.'”

They handed us printed sheets of meaningless syllables; vocal tones arranged like chants with no language.

Kruger called it a “Phase-Lock Chant.”

Gabriel squinted at the page. “So… we're speaking in tongues for science now?”

Kruger smiled thinly. “I suppose, if you prefer that terminology.”

They dimmed the lights, and we began to recite. The hum beneath the floor shifted with each line, syncing to our voices. Then a whisper surfaced under the noise:



***"Be not afraid."***



It wasn't the same voice from before. It was a feminine voice, soft, far away, as if I were hearing it from underwater. Gabriel stopped reading, visibly trembling.

"Keep cadence!” Kruger snapped.

We continued to recite from the page, but nothing else happened. It was as if the facility itself held its breath after that whisper.

Even Kruger looked uneasy, though he tried to hide it behind a professional scowl. Erik avoided my gaze, typing something rapidly into his console before shutting it off. 

We were dismissed for “observation rest.”

Whatever that meant.



Back in the corridor, Gabriel leaned against the wall, his usual sarcasm gone.

“You heard it too, didn’t you?” he asked.

I nodded.

“Female voice. Calm, like she was teaching, not warning.”

“Yeah,” I said quietly. “It didn’t feel… hostile.”

Gabriel laughed once, bitterly. “Good. Maybe our guardian angel finally showed up to apologize.”

Before I could answer, Erik appeared at the end of the hall, thermos in hand, face pale.

He motioned for us to follow him to a maintenance room.

Once the door shut, he locked it from the inside and leaned against a panel.

“You two need to forget that voice,” he said. “Pretend it never happened.”

Gabriel frowned. “You heard it too, didn’t you?”

Erik didn’t answer right away. He took a slow sip of coffee, staring at the floor.

“Yeah,” he said finally. “I’ve heard her before. Most of us who’ve been here long enough have. We just don’t talk about it.”



He rubbed his eyes, looking suddenly old.



“We call her the First Witness. The name isn’t official. It’s… Purist folklore, really. They say she was the first person to ever be assimilated into the Field, long before Theta-7 was even built. Before the schism, even. Some think she’s still in there, a permanent part of it now.”

Gabriel crossed his arms. “And you believe that?”

Erik looked at him. “Some part of me wants to. The alternative is even more terrifying... That it is *her* voice, but it isn't *her* speaking with it.”

Later that night, I found a small notebook slid under my door. There was no symbol on it this time, but someone had written one sentence in English, with careful handwriting:



***“Her name is Anja.”***



Inside were dozens of entries, scrawled in different inks and styles. Half were impossible to read; just equations, sketches of circles, triangles, or strings of numbers.

But one line, three sentences, repeated over and over, stood out:



***"The First Has Heard. The Second Has Spoken. We Await His Arrival"***



I showed it to Gabriel the next morning.

He flipped through a few pages and sighed. “Looks like we’re officially prophets in a madhouse.”

\---

Kruger called us to the chapel again before lunch. He didn’t mention yesterday’s voice. No one did. This time, the sphere in the center glowed brighter, the rhythm faster; three pulses, pause, three again, like breathing.

I could feel it in my chest.

We began the chant. Halfway through, Erik’s monitor emitted a shrill tone. He shouted something to the technicians, but they didn’t move fast enough. The hum deepened, vibrating through the floor, the walls, the marrow in my bones.

Then I heard it again. Not the soft, feminine voice from yesterday, but the booming, thunderous voice from our first stay in Sweden.



***“The light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.”***



Everyone froze.

Kruger screamed, “Maintain cadence!” but his voice was drowned out by the thundering of the entity's, and the screaming of alarms. The glass under our feet rippled like water. A figure took shape in the reflection; six wings of light and shadow, eyes scattered across them like stars.

Gabriel whispered, “Christ have mercy…”

The moment he spoke, the reflection looked up.



The Confession



The alarms didn’t go off this time.

Instead, every light turned blood-red.

Erik grabbed Kruger by the collar.



“Shut it down! You’re feeding it directly!”



Kruger gasped, “It’s answering! Don’t you see? It’s intelligent!”



“So’s a hurricane!” Erik shouted, throwing him aside and running for the emergency panel.



The hum fractured into words again.

A woman’s voice, soft but powerful, filled the room:



“Fear not, for I am with thee.”



It wasn’t the same tone as before.

There was sadness now—like someone mourning a memory that no longer belonged to them.



The walls began to crack.

Sparks rained from the ceiling.



Erik hit the override.

The power cut.

Silence.



We stood there, panting.

The only sound was dripping water from a burst pipe.



Gabriel was the first to speak.

“She said Fear not. That’s… Isaiah, right?”



I nodded. “Isaiah forty-three. I think.”



Erik leaned heavily against the wall.



“She quoted scripture last time too, didn’t she?”



“Yeah,” I said. “Always the same tone. Like she’s trying to remind us of something.”



He ran a hand through his hair.



“Then it’s definitely her. Anja. The First Witness. She’s been in the Field since before the Schism—before even Penumbra went public. I’ve heard recordings. The same voice, same phrasing.”

He looked at me with tired eyes.

“Whatever you heard under the ice—it wasn’t the first. It was the echo of her conversation.”



Gabriel exhaled. “So what now?”



“Now,” Erik said quietly, “we try not to answer back.”



That night, the radios in our rooms turned on by themselves.

The same pattern of static pulsed through the speakers—three, pause, three again.

Then a whisper, faint but unmistakable:



“Heaven is breaking.”



Gabriel and I looked at each other through the open doorway.

Neither of us slept.
