[*It’s been at least 20 minutes*](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/14ehssc/when_she_trapped_us_in_that_pit_she_thought_she/)*. Now I am certain this isn't some kind of sick joke.* I looked at the rest of the group, all sitting in our small circle. Ryan was holding Alice, who had her head pushed into his chest. Tanner was just poking at his shoe, expressionless. I checked my cell phone again. Still no service. "Maybe the other side has an exit" I said as I stood up. "I'm going to go check it out". Ryan nodded his head and Tanner stood up too, signifying that he would go with me. We started walking down the hallway. I've never been claustrophobic but I certainly was at that moment. "What was Megan saying about her sister as she closed the entrance?" "I don't even know, she just kept apologizing and then said we can 'kill it'. Something about how we will save her sister... or something". I kicked a small pebble down the hall and it echoed as it rolled into the darkness. "What is that supposed to mean?" "No clue. She's freaking crazy."

After walking for a moment in silence, we came across Megan's backpack on the ground. I had no idea someone could crack like that. We walked past it and the end I had seen before came into view. "That's a door, and it has to lead somewhere," Tanner said as he started running. He stopped when he reached the end, and at first I wondered why he wasn't trying the handle, but then I saw it - there was no handle. In fact, it wasn’t even a door, it looked like… a set of elevator doors. Old, cracked elevator doors.  
  
Tanner knocked on the door, but it didn’t sound metal, it sounded solid. "It’s… stone. I think?” I knocked too. *Definitely stone, or at least something similar.* I felt my hand along the wall next to it and sure enough, there was a panel with a button. It blended into the wall so well that I probably wouldn't have noticed it if I hadn't run my hand along, and instinctively I pushed my finger against it. It wouldn’t budge. In fact, it was completely flat, like it's also stone, just part of the wall. "How is an elevator down here? We're in the middle of a freaking cave that's in the middle of nowhere" Tanner asked.  
  
The button wasn’t lighting up. *Isn't the button supposed to light up when you click it?* I tried to press it again and then pushed my ear against the door to see if I could hear the elevator moving. "Michael?" he said, trying to get me to answer his question. "I don't know man, I just want it to go up so we can get out of this place" I replied. I wasn’t hearing any movement on the other side. *Damn it. Thing must be broken.* "I don't hear anything. I don't think it works." Tanner pushed his thumb into the button and then placed his second thumb on top to give it more force. "It's just stuck," he said. He fidgeted with the button for a moment, and then with the doors, trying to pry them open. I examined it as he did so, and began to realize that this probably isn't even a real elevator, it seemed to just be an etched out shape of elevator doors into the stone. *But the lines are cut so straight... It seemed like a real elevator from down the hall.*  
  
After a while we saw two flashlights coming from the entrance, and then Alice and Ryan came into view. Ryan squinted and asked if that's an elevator, and Tanner walked him over to it while explaining it isn't real. "How are you holding up Alice?" She stood there for a moment, smudges of mascara around her eyes. She was wearing Megan's backpack. "I'm okay. I'm just so confused why my best friend would do this to us, we haven't done anything to hurt her." "I'm not sure Alice. I'm sorry, we're going to find some way out of this place." She nodded her head in agreement and then walked over to the other two.  
  
I knelt down and unzipped my backpack. *I didn't bring much, better see how much water we have. And food if it comes to that.* I laid everything out and began counting. One loaf of bread, one jar of peanut butter, one jar of jelly, 5 Cliff bars, 4 trail mix packets, 5 full plastic water bottles. There was also my small pocket knife, 2 empty water bottles, my cell phone charger, a couple of pencils, napkins and chapstick. "Hey Alice, when you have a second can you see what Megan's backpack has in it? I want to see how much food we have... just in case." "Sure." Alice knelt down, opened the backpack, and immediately gasped and raised her hands out to the side as if to say 'I didn't do it'. "Holy shit I'm not touching that".  
  
We ran over and she held the backpack open for us to see a handheld gun laying inside. Just as my heart had finally settled down, it suddenly jumped back to its rapid pace. We all stared at it, too shocked to say anything. “I ain’t touching it” Ryan said. My mind began racing. *Did she really plan all of this? Did she bring us here planning to kill us? But she doesn’t even own a gun, where did she get it from?* Alice then started crying again and walked by the elevator, placing her head into the corner.  
  
“She really… wants us dead?” Tanner wondered in disbelief. There was a short pause. Ryan broke the silence. “It doesn’t mean that. My dad carries his gun around sometimes. You know, for self defense. Maybe she always carries it in her backpack, or maybe she brought it in case we ran into a bear?” “You bring bear spray for bears, not a gun!” “Well maybe she didn’t want to buy bear spray and she already owned a gun so she just decided to bring it instead?” “That’s bullshit man, and you know it!” I chimed in. “Why didn’t she shoot us then? Why just leave us down here?” “Because she didn’t have the freaking guts, you said it yourself that she kept apologizing! She couldn’t bring herself to do it so that bitch just decided to lock us down here instead!”  
  
“And not bring her backpack?” Ryan asks. The two continued to bicker back and forth. *He’s right, if she wanted us dead why would she leave her backpack? Someone would come looking for us eventually, and if they found our bodies and her backpack they would ask her how she got out and what the story was. Maybe she left it here by accident when she ran out and locked us in? But those words she said to me as she was closing the entrance… She said we could ‘kill it’. What was she talking about?*  
  
“So what do you think we should do?! Shoot ourselves?!?!” *These two are starting to get heated, I better break it up.* “Let’s just check for some food, who cares why she left it. All that matters is she left us down here. Nobody touch the gun.” “I’ve held a gun before” Ryan quietly said as I took it out and set it next to the wall. The backpack was full with stuff, I was surprised she was carrying it alone the entire hike. Three flashlights, a can of bug spray, three large knives, one round of ammunition, a small can of pepper spray, a lighter, two bottles of water, some bags of chips, a ton of granola bars, some oranges and an envelope that says ‘***READ THIS AS A GROUP, OUT LOUD***’.  
  
Tanner started opening some snacks and sat on the ground. “Oh great, she even wrote us a love letter before killing us.” I began opening the letter. Alice walked over sniffling and then says “I think the gun is her dads. She doesn’t own one but I remember her telling me he does.” I took a sheet of paper out of the envelope and unfolded it, and started reading it out loud.  
  
***Dear friends,***  
  
***ego dekhomai tēn proklēsē.***  
  
Suddenly, without warning, illumination filled the entire paper. Everyone gasped except for Alice, who screamed in panic. I looked up and saw that every torch in the hallway had been spontaneously ignited. In fact, I could see all the way to the entrance now. Alice ran over to Ryan and held him. We were all in shock as to what just occurred. A few seconds passed, and nothing else happened. “Must be electronic, that must mean there’s someone close by?” Ryan said. I looked at the ceiling corners. No cameras. I shook my head and continued reading.  
  
***I’ve spent many nights thinking about going through with this, and if you’re reading this letter it means I actually did it and for that I’m truly, truly sorry. I deserve whatever punishment lays in store for me, but I will do whatever it takes to save my little sister. I led you all to this cave to help me save her. What I’m about to tell you will seem crazy and you won’t want to believe it but YOU NEED TO, because your lives currently depend on it.***  
  
***Back in high school, I was obsessed with Ancient Greece, captivated by its tales. But as time went on, I let go of that fascination, focusing on other things. Yet, when Emma was diagnosed...everything changed. I scoured the depths of the internet, desperately seeking a way to save her. And then it struck me, the story of the Elixir hidden within the labyrinth. It’s basically one of the many versions in Greek mythology of what happened to the famous labyrinth after Theseus killed the Minotaur inside. The story goes that Zeus had been a spectator as Theseus ventured through the labyrinth amused by the man. Once Theseus managed to kill the beast in their fierce battle, the thunder God decided that he enjoyed watching what happened so much that once Theseus died, he resurrected the beast and placed a prize on its head. The prize was a remedy that would cure any ailment or illness, the blood of the centaur Chiron. Warriors from all over the world would come to face the beast, either dying in the maze or gaining their prize and saving themselves or their family members. That's where the legends end.***  
  
***I know it sounds mad that such a thing could be real, but I wouldn't have done this to you unless I were sure. I spent all of my free time researching, hours upon hours, finding rumors and stories online of the labyrinth's existence. I found some forums claiming it to be real, with one person saying there was only a single entrance that their grandfather had found and two others saying they had read of several entrances. Eventually, I came across an article in a small, local newspaper about a man claiming he found what he thought to be the entrance only a few hours away from where we live. The article was around 20 years old, and when I found his phone number and called it had been disconnected. But I knew the general area and came out here to find it. I knew it was in a cave in these woods, and eventually I took the trail that had been closed off. Sure enough I found the cave… which was also closed off, with a sign saying there were bats inside that could be infectious. I scoured the cave and found the pit. Against all odds, I found the entrance. It was as if it was calling to me, telling me where it was.***  
  
***This is where you are now. I have given you weapons to kill that thing down there. If they could kill it back then with swords and spears then you’ll be able to kill it easily with a gun. I really wouldn’t have put you down there if I didn’t think you could easily kill it, and I have stayed out because someone needs to watch over Emma in case you don’t survive. Again, I’m truly sorry. In the end, it’ll be worth it.***  
  
At this point I couldn't hold back my frustration or rage any longer. “There’s no way she can do this to us. She’s crazy, just absolutely freaking nuts! She seriously trapped us down here because she thinks we can fight some monster and save Emma? This is such…” I glanced over at Tanner, whose eyes were now fixed on the elevator. The doors… were open. Tanner immediately started walking over and stepped inside of it while saying “It’s about freaking time!! I’m tired of this shit” The rest of us grabbed our things and silently agreed by following suit. It seemed like any old elevator, with a red carpeted floor, red laminated walls with mirrors taking up the top half. Two buttons… an up arrow that looked stone and a down arrow that looked like any regular button, lit up. Above the buttons is a small elevator map:  
  
\+-------------------------------------+  
\+----| Hall of Victors (5) |  
| +-------------------------------+

\+-------------------+  
  
When I clicked the up arrow I ran into the same issue as beforehand. It wouldn’t budge, as if it was sealed into the elevator plane itself. Tanner let out an audible sigh. “Of course the up button doesn’t work.” I took in a deep breath, and pressed the down button. "Better to go find someone than stay in this abandoned hallway until we starve."  
  
The elevator started its descent. I peered at the illuminated floor number which read "6" and I fixated on it. The usual sounds of an elevator slipping down its cables softly groaned from outside of the elevator. It wasn’t long before I realized something was wrong. Normally, it takes mere seconds to drop just one floor. I realized that a sensation of weightlessness was coming over my body, causing my fingers to instinctively latch onto the safety rail, seeking stability. *This elevator is accelerating its descent, way too fast, as if it is... DROPPING*. A surge of panic coursed through the confined space as Tanner's voice pierced the air yelling "Oh shit, this thing is broken!". I looked at the group and everyone gripped onto the lone handrail, knuckles white with tension.  
  
The lone light in the ceiling began flickering. Glancing at my friends between flashes of light, I observed their faces contorted with terror, their bodies slightly crouched, each struggling to maintain balance as the elevator hurtled downward. My gaze darted around, searching frantically for any sign of a lifesaving mechanism—an emergency button, perhaps—but other than the two buttons the elevator pad is empty. Without hesitation, I resorted to pressing the up and down buttons repeatedly, hoping by some miracle that it might slow down or come to a halt at one of the floors we pass. Nothing. The entire elevator rattled violently, and I closed my eyes. *We made a mistake getting on this thing*. Time was stretching unbearably, each passing second feeling like an eternity, as I clung to the rail with my eyes tightly shut, bracing for an inevitable crash at the bottom, and I found the only thought going through my head was the hope that it would be quick and painless.  
  
The shaking stopped, and with my eyes still closed I could tell that the flickering had stopped. My weight was starting to return. *The elevator must be slowing down.* I opened my eyes and looked at the floor number. \**DING*\*. The six flashed into a five, and the doors opened. Another torchlit hallway stretched out before us, its expanse wider than the previous one. Lining the walls were an array of statues, each depicting a distinct figure. We all continued crouching while motionless, trying to recover from whatever free fall we had just endured. Ryan slowly straightened up to his full height. “Well that was fun. Is this heaven? Because it sure doesn’t look like the heaven I was taught.” He stepped forward into the corridor. Although still in shock, I couldn’t help but admire the statues. *I better not stay on this thing anyway*. I grabbed a flashlight and followed suit.  
  
My eyes were drawn to the intricate craftsmanship. Each statue held a weapon, showcasing a variety of stances, armors, and facial features. A towering, muscular man donned in formidable armor grasps a spear and shield. Beside him, a similar figure possesses a bow and arrow, exuding an air of agility and precision. Another statue, slightly shorter and less robust, stands with a sword and shield, without a helmet. Each figure boasts unique builds, facial features, stances, and armor, brought to life in stone.  
  
As I continued walking past the statues, I noticed that most of them are men, but I do catch two women amongst them. Their forms are just as intricately sculpted, each displaying their own grace and power. Adorning the base of every statue was a Greek inscription.  
  
"These are incredible, so realistic," Ryan marveled, breaking the silence with admiration in his voice. Alice agreed softly behind me, her continuous recovery from the earlier bizarre incident evident in her tone. I found myself drawn to a particular statue a few steps beyond Ryan's position, catching my eye with its unconventional depiction. It portrayed a man clutching what appeared to be a gun, a World War II Russian soldier armed with a recognizable PPSH machine gun. At least, that's what the gun looked like from when I used to play call of duty. However, even though the statue depicted a soldier from a relatively modern era, the inscription was still in Greek.  
  
I shook my head. "I'm sure there's a way out of here somewhere, let's find it. There must be a door," I said to the others. Ryan replied "Sounds good to me, after just about dying I think I'm ready to go home and call the freaking cops.” I picked up the pace, darting my eyes on the statues as I walked past them. A large man with two swords, a guy holding nothing but a shield with a helmet that you think would entirely block your vision, a guy with armor that looks more medieval than the others, another guy with a sword and shield. "This is starting to creep me out because of Megan's letter. These guys all look like they enjoy fighting to me". No one responded to Alice’s comment. I picked up the pace. *I don't know what is going on or what these statues are for, but there's no way what Megan said in her little fairytale can be true. Either she's lying or she has gone completely delusional and thinks it's real.* I shined my flashlight straight down the hall and saw that there was an opening at the very end.  
  
As we drew nearer, the threshold revealed an expansive chamber that stretched out before us. Adorning the walls were a mesmerizing display of trophies on stands and coins scattered everywhere that would glisten in the soft, ethereal glow from the torches. In the middle of the room, towering above us, stood a colossal monument. It portrayed a resolute figure, a man's face bearing an expression of determination and struggle. In his hands he holds a large spear, which is thrusted into the abdomen of... a minotaur. The beast possesses a fearsome countenance with its horns curved, its brawny frame locked with its muscles straining in defiance. It holds a single, extremely large ax in its right hand.  
  
Shadows danced across the sculpture. It's so unnerving. Megan's letter resonates in my mind. *There’s just no way it can be true… but the elevator, the statues, the whole feeling of this insane place just feels so off. Maybe I’m dreaming? It certainly feels like a dream.* I pinch myself and sure enough it hurts. I walked past the centerpiece and saw that there were three more paths that lead out of the chamber, but they were almost pitch black with only a few, scattered torches inside. Tanner walked over to one of the trophies, smiled, and held it up. “I have no idea where we are or what is going on, but I actually think this place is pretty cool. Do you guys think this stuff is worth something? Or does this mean Megan was telling the truth?” Ryan shrugged his shoulders and held his hands out, signaling for Tanner to throw the trophy over. Tanner tossed it… and missed Ryan by about 4 feet. \**CLANK CLANK CLANK clank clank*\* The loud metal sound reverberated through the room, rattling the silence with what felt like a deafening roar. A chill coursed through my veins, raising goosebumps on my skin, and a rush of panic flashed through me like a bolt of lightning.  
  
I hadn’t yet admitted to myself that this could be real, that it really could be a death trap with some undead monster, but as I felt my body go stiff I realized deep down that there was a possibility. I turned around at the others, who were all frozen like me. I held my breath. My only focus was now on any sounds from outside of the chamber, anything that could've heard that. I waited and tried to listen but my heartbeat thumped in my ears, blocking my only ability to know if something was coming for us. *This isn’t real, it’s just some place she found and she made up some freakish story to scare us. Some kind of joke as an act of revenge for something we did. I can feel beads of sweat begin to form on my forehead. Why am I freaking out?*  
  
"Nice one," Ryan murmured, followed by a small, awkward chuckle. I let out a shaky breath, a sigh of relief. "What are you guys freaking out about? Okay, so we found a bunch of statues and trophies, so what?" Tanners replies. "So what?" Alice's voice quivered with a mixture of fear and frustration. "So what if it is f-r-e-a-k-i-n-g real?" Tanner's face turned sarcastic, scrunched up in the way that has always annoyed me. "Oh yeah, there's a minotaur that we have to fight and kill. And then we're going to save Megan's sister, you know, after she decided to TRAP US DOWN HERE!" I could feel the irritation burning in my eyes as I glared at him while mouthing the words, "Keep your voice DOWN."  
  
"You guys are idiots," Tanner snapped. I could tell he was scared too, his nerves unraveling. "She told us a stupid lie. This place may be a thousand years old or a week old, but there obviously isn't anyone down here right now. The story she told is F-A-K-E. Monsters.. aren't.. real" he said, pausing deliberately between each word. "Listen, I'm not saying they are, but we don't know where we are, or what is down here, or how we're going to get out of here." “There’s nothing down here! Haven’t you noticed, uhhh, I don’t know, the cobwebs and twenty layers of dust on everything?” Alice interjected. “She could’ve been telling the truth, so you should really just shut up.” Tanner shook his head. “I don’t know if you are going crazy or have just seen too many movies, but you see that thing right there?” He pointed to the minotaur statue. “It is called a MYTH. Myths, legends, monsters… NOT REAL!” he shouted. Ryan interjects and joins the bickering to defend Alice, calling Tanner an asshole. I rolled my eyes and took a breath.  
  
And then I heard it.  
  
It was very faint, coming from one of the tunnels. For the first few moments, I prayed it was just my imagination, myself finally losing it and going insane. But unmistakably, and gradually growing louder, I could hear whispering echoing from the distance. “SHHHHHH!” The others stopped and stared at me. Their eyes grew wide as they began to hear it too.  
  
I grabbed my flashlight and ran to the first tunnel, slightly rolling my feet instead of stomping. I shot my flashlight into the darkness. It seemed empty. The whispers were getting louder. I ran to the next and pointed it down, terrified of what I might see. Still nothing. As I ran towards the third tunnel, I heard distant footsteps… the whispers even louder now. They sounded muddled, impossible to understand as if it’s several voices speaking all at once, as if whispering about some evil act they are keeping secret. This isn’t real, this isn’t real, this cannot be fucking real. In anticipation of whatever this thing was, I stood back even farther from the tunnel and pointed my flashlight.  
  
Deep down the tunnel, just far enough where I can barely make out its features, was a figure moving in the darkness.  
  
I was petrified as I stared at it. With each measured step, it emerged from the darkness, briefly revealed by a flickering torch, only to retreat back into the abyss.  
  
The creature that materialized was monstrous, towering at least 7 feet tall, but it had a grotesque manifestation of decaying skin hanging loosely from its frame. Its face is that of a bull with a single long, twisted horn on the side of its head. Its mouth was slightly moving, creating the soft whispering. Patches of exposed bone were peeking through the tattered remnants of its flesh, the left side of its face resembling a grotesque skull with the empty eye socket gazing out with a vacant, hollow stare. The torso boasted an enormous, muscular chest enveloped in coarse, black fur soaked with the stain of old blood. The legs also seemed to be that of a mans, but over-sized and with chipped hooves. As it trudged forward, occasionally pieces of itself would tear away with a sickening squelch behind it. In its right hand was a large stick with a jagged piece of metal coming out of the side at the top.  
  
This was not the minotaur depicted in the stone monument. This beast looked wraithlike… zombified even.  
  
Frozen in place, I did nothing.  
  
It then unleashed a piercing cry, like a scream from a person actively being devoured mixed with the yell of an enraged animal. [So I started running.](https://www.reddit.com/user/UnderdonetoastHorror)
