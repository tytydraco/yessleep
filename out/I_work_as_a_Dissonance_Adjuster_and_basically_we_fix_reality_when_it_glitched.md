I took the job because I was desperate and sleep-deprived enough to think a glitchy job listing wasn’t a red flag. It just said: “Seeking: Dissonance Adjuster. No prior experience. Must not ask questions.” I was scrolling through an old dark web archive forum, half-dead on instant noodles and dread, when the page refreshed itself and the ad appeared—like it had been waiting for me. No salary listed, no company name. Just coordinates. I thought it was a scam or some immersive ARG. The interview wasn’t really an interview. I showed up to a half-empty building outside the city. A man in a lab coat with one blue lens in his glasses held up a photo of me sleeping in my apartment—taken from inside. “You’re already qualified,” he said. “Sign here.” The paper was blank. The pen felt too warm. The moment I scribbled my name, something behind my left eye began to \*itch\*, like a memory trying to get out.

Being a Dissonance Adjuster means handling moments when reality fumbles, like it tripped over its own code. We don’t fix things—we patch perception. If someone sees something they shouldn’t—like a plane freezing mid-air, or their reflection blinking twice while they only blink once—we’re deployed to smooth it over. Delete the memory. Redirect their attention. Rewrite just enough to keep the person glued to this version of the world. Sometimes it’s as simple as swapping the batteries in their smoke alarm. Other times, we have to burn an object. The worst ones involve mirrors. The first case I got was an old woman who remembered dying. Twice. Same hospital, same nurse, same heart monitor flatline. I was instructed to remove her curtains and dispose of a mirror in her attic wrapped in breathing plastic. Once I did, she started calling me by her son’s name. She didn’t \*have\* a son. HQ said, “Good. Means it worked.”

The job has rules, unspoken but enforced. You learn them quickly if you want to keep your skin fitting right. If a stranger calls you by your full name on the bus, do \*not\* respond. If your calendar suddenly skips a day and no one else notices, mark it with black ink and move on. If your shadow starts facing the wrong direction, take sick leave. Once a week, we’re told to write our names backward on our bathroom mirrors. If the handwriting doesn’t match what we remember, we’re supposed to file a resignation request and wait. Not resign—just \*wait.\* I broke that rule once. My name came out as “AARYA” both ways. I stared for a long time before realizing it was a palindrome. It shouldn’t have been. When I checked my ID later, my name had never changed. But my mother began calling me “Saanvi” on accident, and when I corrected her, she looked scared. Not startled—\*terrified\*, like she was about to scream.

Last night was the last straw. I was assigned to adjust a child who remembered being \*born\*. Not in the poetic, spiritual sense—he remembered the folds of flesh, the medical instruments, the red wire around his neck. He remembered being told “This one isn’t ready,” and then being pulled anyway. When I got to the house, his parents were frozen mid-laugh at the dinner table, forks raised but unmoving. The boy was gone. There was a single note on the fridge, in handwriting that looked like mine but just slightly... sharper. It said, “You’re not adjusting anomalies. You’re absorbing them.” I’m not sure what that means. The birds outside my window don’t blink anymore. I see my reflection watching me even when I’m not looking in a mirror. The last message I received from HQ wasn’t a mission. It was a sentence: \*\*“Welcome to the misalignment layer.” And the worst part is, when I looked back at my old contract—it was never blank. It just says: \*"Reality belongs to the last one who remembers it wasn’t always like this."\* I think I’m that person now. But I don’t want to be. I think if you’re reading this, I just passed the itch to you. Let it settle behind your eye. Don’t scratch it. That’s how the cracks form.
