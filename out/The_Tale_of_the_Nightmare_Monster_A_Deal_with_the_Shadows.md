In the remote and forgotten town of Aokigahara, where the air was thick with fog and the shadows seemed to move of their own accord, there stood a cursed relic of a bygone era: Deal Corner. The building, crumbling with age and disrepair, was a place shunned by the few who still dared to live nearby. Its name, scrawled in faded blood-red paint, was a warning as much as a label. Those who entered were seldom seen again, and those who spoke of it did so in hushed, fearful tones.

Aokigahara was no ordinary town; it was a place steeped in dark history, built atop the ruins of an ancient shrine dedicated to yokai, the malevolent spirits that once roamed freely in the shadows. The shrine had long since burned to the ground, but its cursed energy remained, seeping into the town's foundations and warping the very fabric of reality. The town was a trap, a labyrinth of shifting streets and dead-end alleys that ensnared the lost and the damned.

One night, during a storm that tore through the town like the wrath of a vengeful god, a traveler found himself stranded in Aokigahara. The town was a ghostly maze, its buildings twisted and decayed, as if the very earth sought to swallow them whole. As lightning split the sky, the traveler caught sight of a dim light flickering in the distance—Deal Corner, the only sign of life in the otherwise dead town.

Desperate for shelter, he pushed open the creaking door and stepped inside. The interior was as unwelcoming as the town itself, a claustrophobic space filled with bizarre trinkets and artifacts that seemed to pulse with a life of their own. The air was stale, thick with the scent of rot and something far more insidious.

His eyes were drawn to the back wall, where a painting hung in a frame that looked as old as the building itself. It was the Nightmare Monster, a chilling piece of art that depicted a creature of unimaginable horror. The monster, with its glowing red eyes and exaggerated features, seemed to leer at the traveler, its gaze filled with malice. The words "NIGHTMARE, NIGHTMARE" and "Trapped in the shadows" were scrawled across the painting in a haphazard fashion, as if written in a frenzy. Red tape marked with "DEAL CORNER" crisscrossed the design, and faint, ghostly footprints trailed off into the inky darkness of the scene.

As the traveler stared at the painting, an overwhelming sense of dread washed over him. It was as if the painting was alive, its imagery writhing and twisting just beyond the edge of perception. He felt a compulsion to touch it, an urge that defied all reason. The moment his fingers brushed the surface, the room plunged into darkness, and the temperature dropped so suddenly that his breath misted in the air.

A low, guttural growl rumbled from the shadows, growing louder until it reverberated through his bones. The traveler spun around, but there was nothing—only the suffocating darkness that now pressed in on all sides. The air grew thick, heavy with the stench of decay and something far worse.

Then, from the blackness, a pair of glowing red eyes appeared, staring directly at him. The Nightmare Monster emerged, its form grotesque and twisted, a mass of sinew and shadow that defied description. Its claws were long and sharp, dragging across the floor with a sound that set the traveler’s teeth on edge. It spoke in a voice that was both a whisper and a roar, filling the room with a dreadful resonance.

"You have made a deal with the shadows," it hissed, each word dripping with malice. "And now you are bound to the nightmare."

Panic seized the traveler as he tried to flee, but the shadows seemed to close in around him, their touch cold and clammy. The monster lunged, and in an instant, the world went black.

The storm raged on through the night, its fury unabated. When morning came, Aokigahara was as silent and empty as ever, the storm's violence leaving no trace but for the unsettling stillness that followed.

Days passed, then weeks, but the traveler was never seen again. Those who had known of his presence in the town whispered about his fate, but no one dared to investigate. Deal Corner remained as it always had, its door slightly ajar, the painting still hanging on the wall. Yet something about the painting had changed, though none who saw it could quite put their finger on what.

Some said the red eyes in the painting now glowed with a darker, more sinister light, while others swore they saw movement within the shadows of the image, as if something—or someone—was trapped inside. But no one could be sure, and no one dared to look too closely.

As the years passed, the town of Aokigahara grew quieter, more forgotten, its streets sinking further into disrepair. Deal Corner stood as a relic of a time long past, a monument to the horrors that lurked in the shadows. The fate of those who vanished within its walls remained a mystery, lost to time and fear.

But at night, when the wind howled through the empty streets and the shadows grew long, some claimed they could hear the faint echo of footsteps, trailing off into the darkness—footsteps that seemed to lead back to Deal Corner, and to the nightmare that awaited within.
