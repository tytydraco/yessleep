I'm writing this, I suppose, as some proof I’m not insane. Ever since the incident at my workplace, I've been second guessing every damn thing I do because of what that man said to me.  
It started at work, it had been a very slow day so I had been spending it how I usually spend my off hours at work. Staying by the coffee machine, with a cup of coffee avoiding my boss. But today of all days the coffee machine was broken, so I figured the next best thing to do was to hide out in the elevator. I walked over to the large, metal doors and pressed the button. In an instant, the doors slid open as the scent of smoke and an undertone of rotten eggs.  
I walked into the cramped elevator, not noticing the man sitting in the corner. He wore a pin-striped suit, with a rose embroidered on the collar. While his suit lacked a tie, his gold cufflinks and expensive looking haircut more than made up for it. He took a drag of a cigarette before speaking in a gravelly tone, slurred with a heavy southern accent.  
“Sam, right? Figured you’d show up here eventually. How are you today?” The man spoke with a voice haunting yet oddly soothing.  
The man was unfamiliar to me, and had an aura of mistrust around him. The elevator doors closed as he continued  
“Listen Sam, you ain’t gonna believe a lick of what I’m boutta say to you. But well that ain’t my problem, now is it?” the man continued.  
I interrupted him, calling out. “Hey man, how do you know me? I’ve never seen you here before, and what do you mean I won’t believe what you say? As a matter of fact, who let you in the building?”  
The man chuckled slightly, letting a puff of smoke escape his mouth. “Hell, what’d I say? Okay, before you freak out, I’ll just come out and say it. You’re gonna die in the next month.”  
I was floored from disbelief, thinking this stranger was joking with me. But he gave me an expression of a hunter staring at his prey, contorted with a healthy dose of pity.  
“What the hell? Do you want me to call security?” I say, reaching for my phone. The man chuckles to himself as I check my phone. Oddly enough, I don’t get any service, which is extremely out of the ordinary.  
The man hissed out, “Them gadgets ain’t gonna do nothin for ya here, and I’m not so sure Marcus from security has enough firepower to deal with me. So lemme try my hand at explaining the unexplainable. For starters, I’m the devil. Well, more accurately I am a devil. A manifestation of one of the many aspects of the devil. My particular poison is gambling, deal making, that sort of shtick.”  
By this point I was in a strange state of disbelief, astonishment, and dread. With my fear mounting and no exit in sight, I decided to play along with this guy’s games. “Okay, well since you’re a devil, and one of deals at that, is there some sort of deal or contract I’m supposed to sign?”  
The man laughed, “now you’re speaking my language! So here’s the deal, as far as I’m concerned I don’t need your damn soul. What I care about is making sure nobody else gets to your soul before me. So I figure we can make a little arrangement..”  
The elevator groaned to a halt as the doors opened to an unfamiliar scene. A cigar lounge lay before me, with all sorts of unsavory characters filling the booths and chairs. A miasma of smoke hung low, creeping into my lungs. I felt eyes on the back of my head as I followed the man to the center of the room. There, in the center, was a poker table with two stacks of white chips at either side. The man gestured to one of the empty seats as he moved to his own.  
“Now we’re playing Texas hold ‘em,” the man started to explain. “And by the way, you can call me Jack. No need for anonymity and all… in any case, as you can see we aren't betting money or any normal chip. We're betting the quality, quantity, and stipulations of the rest of your life and your soon to be afterlife."  
I slowly nodded in a limited understanding and gestured for him to deal my cards. He grinned and slid two cards my way, pulling a cigar out of his coat pocket after and lighting it.  
I looked at my cards with concealed glee, a queen and ace tucked under my hand. Yet I stifled my happiness, because what are the chances I get a good hand like this? Little to none if I'm playing against the devil.  
"The ante for this round is your death. My ante is your death will be long, painful, and exhausting. And your ante will be a quick, painless death." Jack announced, cigar smoke billowing as he spoke.  
This was meant to give me time to play into his hand, either way I've lost the right to a peaceful death. so through bated breath, I said "I fold" shoving my cards back towards him.  
   
For the first time since I met him, Jack's facade faded for a second. What was there was a face warped with frustration and genuine malice, and I was terrified beyond reproach. Just as quick, his facade slipped back as he chuckled.   
He dealt the flop, turn, the river, and revealed his cards. He would have had me with a full suit of 7's to my two pairs of queens and aces. I breathed a sigh of relief as the next hand was dealt.  
We went on like this for what seemed like forever. I had gambled my way into a life of comfort, won back the love of the woman I lost, and could live peacefully for the rest of how long my life would be. But my afterlife would be plagued with strife, suffering and torment before I could even see the light of heaven.   
All things considered, I was winning a lot more than Jack thought I would and I could tell his persona was melting away. His face barely kept the facade up, but his eyes showed his true nature. A hate came from his eyes that burned its way to my very soul.  
"Alright Sam, double or nothing. Beat my hand and you get your free ticket to heaven. Lose, and you gotta answer to Mr. Smiley before you get through them pearly gates."  
Although unexplainable, the mere mention of this name sent hot bile rushing up my throat. It took every ounce of my strength to force it down. It never occurred to me then, but the room did lull itself into an eerie abandoned silence. Jack tossed a single chip into the pot and it warped into a grotesque face. Pale and gaunt with skin stretched out, unfilled eyes stared back at me with a toothy grin in perpetuity. The chip thudded with an artificial weight gained only from the dread that the face on this chip commands.  
“I’m all in sammy, so you gonna call my bluff or walk away from a deal of a lifetime?” Jack hissed out in desperation.  
To this day, I don’t know what made me do it. Maybe it was because I was already so deep into my earnings. Maybe that was his plan, fatten up his swine before he brought down the cleaver. Or maybe I was delusional enough to think that I could literally beat the devil at his own game.  
Whatever the reason, I made the worst decision of my life and shoved my chips to match his. His grin stretched from ear to ear as he revealed what, deep down, I already knew.  
"Sorry Sam, full house beats your high card. I'll be nice and still grant you all your winnings and your fast pass to heaven. But you've still got a toll to pay with Mr. Smiley. And for what it's worth, I'm sorry it had to be you and not someone that deserved it, but this is nothing personal. We all have to answer to someone, even me." Jack solemnly spoke, genuinely remorseful from what I could perceive.  
I could only nod, holding back more vomit from spilling out. He showed me back to the elevator and escorted me back to the floor I stopped on. Once I got off, the elevator slowly closed, taking the thing named Jack with it.  
After that, I quit my job and started a family with my now wife. Yet I cannot find happiness, because of that fuckin face. That goddamn smiling face with a gaunt, emaciated body to match. Every day, the thing known as Mr Smiley gets a little closer to me. And lately, I've started to hear it whisper to me. Lord only knows what it says but I have a sinking feeling I'll find out soon. It grows closer as my date of death grows closer, and I don't have the heart to tell anybody but strangers on the internet.  
And although I have won so much, the debt I have incurred because of it might be too much to bear. All I know is my ticket to heaven is not free, and I may wish to have been sent to hell instead.
