Every night, the creature with the bulging, black eyes and skin like white marble would appear in my dreams. No matter what kind of dream or nightmare it was, the abomination would inevitably intrude with its grinning mouth and poisoned words. At first, I didn’t know what it wanted with me, but I quite rightly assumed it was nothing good. However, I could never have imagined the amount of evil and horror it would bring to my life, not even in my wildest nightmare.  
  
It had no hair on its body. Two small, reptilian holes marked its nasal passages. Its bone-white arms and legs appeared unnaturally thin and long. Its hands nearly reached down to its knees, reminding me of a circus performer with arm stilts. At the end, it had tapering, dagger-like fingers that cracked with many extra joints. Sharp, bat-like wings slowly beat the air on both sides of its body. They extended far out, dwarfing the creature’s body. Its skin seemed like smooth, glistening bone; its skull had a slightly pointed shape.  
  
“Leave me alone!” I screamed. Whenever it appeared, I felt myself awaken somehow, coming to full consciousness while still trapped within the dream-state, as if the creature’s presence alone caused lucid dreaming. I turned, trying to run away into the rolling, green hills surrounding my childhood home. But the creature stood on all sides of me, seemingly able to teleport in an instant in this unreal, dissociated world. Wherever I looked, it would be there, blocking my path with its insane, reptilian grin. It would slowly float up and down over the ground, hovering like a buoy dancing in the waves of the ocean.  
  
The creature raised its hand, snapping its eerie, sharp fingers together. I heard the click of bones all around me, as if the snapping sound of its alien fingers was simultaneously being blared on thousands of hidden speakers. Instantly, everything changed. The sunny, blue sky overhead winked out. There was a sound like rushing water, a cacophony of white noise and powerful currents that roared through everything for a couple seconds.   
  
In place of the sky I knew stood a flat expanse of nothingness the dark purple color of an old bruise. The rolling hills flickered like a mirage, becoming translucent and shadowy then solid again. The colors began to suck out of them as the world faded into a ghostly negative. I found myself standing on an endless desert with fine grains of black sand that blew like specks of shadow toward the horizon. Mountainous dunes rose all around us, piling up in great, scintillating heaps.  
  
“We have returned,” the creature hissed, revealing pulsating fangs beneath a smile of pure bloodlust and sadism. It had teeth like those of a rattlesnake. As its grin widened, dozens of sharp, curving fangs lowered out its mouth like hypodermic needles on hinges. Clear venom dripped from their hollow ends, dribbling down its lipless, chalky mouth. “We have returned to the wastelands, as all beings will in the end. I am from the alpha, formed perfectly with God himself. I am a true angel. Have you done what I wanted, Son of Adam?”  
  
“No!” I screamed, thinking back to its demands from the previous night. It had wanted me to let it in. The whipping desert wind seemed to suck my words out of my mouth, flinging them across the black sands of this dead world. “I will never do what you want!” My defiance shriveled up like a slug under the sun as the creature flew forwards in a blur. Its black eyes stood only inches from my face, lidless and alien. They seemed to take up the entire universe. It felt like looking into the eyes of a venomous snake. I feared the strike would come at any moment. My heart palpitated in my chest, hammering in rapid, thready beats as I looked into the face of Hell itself.  
  
I remembered when I had first seen the creature. I had thought that trying out occult practices was an interesting idea at the time. I felt a sense of power as I performed the ritual, reading from the Necronomicon and calling on the ancient ones to come and give me knowledge. The next night, the angel had first appeared like the rising patches of a cancer spreading across my mind.  
  
“I can keep you here for as long as I want,” it gurgled, putting one of its razor-sharp fingers on my cheek, directly below my right eye. I whimpered slightly, trying to pull away, but it put its other hand on the back of my skull. Its skin felt like burning ice. It sent waves of repulsion flitting through my body, as if I had plunged my face into the suppurating, dripping sore of some rotten corpse.   
  
“Do you need more convincing, Son of Adam?” it asked. I remembered the last time the creature had tortured me in my dreams, only twenty-fours previously. I had woken up screaming in my bed, covered in blood. The deep gashes on my back, chest and stomach still hadn’t healed. Neither had the burn mark in the shape of a skeletal, sharp-fingered hand seared over my heart.   
  
“Perhaps I have been too kind to you. Perhaps I should start by cutting out your eyes and making you eat them. Would you like that?” It cooed the words in a slithery, reptilian voice. I felt drops of its venom dribbling from its open, grinning mouth onto the front of my shirt. They felt burning hot, like drops of lava.  
  
“Who are you?” I asked. “Why are you doing this to me?” Its smile evaporated like dew under a blazing summer sun. It scowled at me. Its ragged, ominous wings continued to beat the air in slow, lazy undulations.  
  
“I am no fool, Patrick,” it hissed at me, pulling its scalpel-like finger back from my eye. “I don’t reveal my name to mortals. Names are powerful things. With a name, you can control the essence of a being. The true name of a being has a deep connection to its soul, and knowing that true name gives the knower great power.  
  
“However, if you have to call me something, you can call me…” The creature looked up at the flat, violet void of a sky, its enormous black eyes flashing with intelligence and cunning. “You can call me Friend.”  
  
\*\*\*  
  
I heard a voice like God shouting from the infinite, empty sky above. It boomed through the dream-world. The creature’s face contorted into a shriek of rage and fury as the words echoed through my soul.  
  
“Wake up,” someone said, shaking my shoulder. “You’re having another nightmare. Hey, bud, can you hear me?” I jumped up in bed, sweating heavily, my eyes wild and rolling. I saw light streaming in from the hallway through my open door. My roommate, Tommy, stood next to my bed, his fat, round moon-face looking down on me in concern.  
  
“Oh God, Tommy,” I said, almost weeping in joy, “thank God. Thank God. You took me out of there.” I shook my head, nearly frantic with relief. “I’m never going to sleep again. That thing is never going to trap me again.” Tommy took a step back, his face showing concern. He had big, brown eyes like those of a cow. They gazed at me with confusion and discomfort.  
  
“Umm… I don’t know what’s going on here, but I’m gonna…” Tommy started to say, backpedaling slowly away from me as if I were a ticking time bomb getting ready to explode. I jumped out of bed wearing only my boxers.   
  
“Look,” I said, pointing at my chest. I showed him the slash marks and the burnt outline of a demonic hand tattooed over my heart.   
  
“What the hell, bro?” Tommy said, taking a good look at the marks. “How does something like that even happen? I hope it’s not some weird BDSM shit.” He glanced over his shoulder at the door, as if trying to reassure himself that he still had a path to escape the raving lunatic standing in front of him.   
  
“I’m not fucking crazy, Tommy,” I screamed in a lunatic voice. “This happened last night. I was having a dream… a nice dream. I saw my grandmother again. She was cooking breakfast and I was sitting at the table at her house, just a happy, innocent child waiting for his French toast. My grandmother has been dead for over ten years, so it felt real nice to see her again. Real nice.” I blinked fast, trying to clear the tears that threatened to rush out. “I was so happy, until she turned around with the plate. And I saw it wasn’t my grandmother at all, and it wasn’t French toast anymore, either.  
  
“It was that thing, the thing with the lidless, black eyes and chalk-white skin. It calls itself an angel, it says its name is Friend, but it looks like something dreamed up in the pits of Hell. Its wings are pointed and black like those of a bat. They’re enormous, looming over both sides of its body. Necrotic, rotten holes are eaten into their dark flesh, and when it comes near, I can smell it, even in my dreams. The creature reeks like fresh leather and old skin.” The odor of the angel seemed to hover all around me in the room, mixing with the scent of old cigarette smoke and cologne.  
  
“The room began to close in around me then, the walls moving in as if they were on rollers,” I continued, feeling a building pressure in my chest. I needed to get it all out to someone. Tommy just continued to stand there stupidly, his mouth agape, his fat body as still as a statue’s. “As the creature walked towards me, the room shrunk. Soon, it felt like my grandma’s kitchen was only the size of a coffin- a coffin just large enough to fit me and the monster inside.  
  
“‘I brought you breakfast, my sweetie,’ it gurgled, still wearing my grandma’s clothes. It put out a bowl of stew in front of me. I looked down, seeing a bright crimson broth with carrots, celery and potatoes floating in it. Mixed in with the vegetables, I saw dismembered human fingers and eyeballs. One of the swollen, cooked eyes spun in the liquid, flopping like a fish until it looked straight up at me, the filmy, blue iris gleaming in the bloody stew. ‘Eat it. Eat it all so you can become a big boy,’ the creature cooed as I gazed down in disbelief at the bowl of horrors. It grinned, showing off fangs that flicked out like switchblades. It reminded me of a rattlesnake, how its fangs swing out…”  
  
“Look, bud, this is all really interesting and everything,” Tommy said, starting to take slow, tentative steps towards the door, “but I don’t think it has anything to do with me. I only came in here because you were screaming in your sleep and woke me up. Whatever’s going on with you is your business. If you’re cutting yourself in your sleep, though, you should probably talk to, like, a doctor or someone, I don’t know. But I do have work in the morning, so…” He turned away quickly and walked out the door, slowly pulling it closed behind him. As he left, I saw a single brown eye peering in, wide and glistening with concern, as if he were a spectator looking into the prison cell of an unstable murderer.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
I sat up in the kitchen that night, drinking cup after cup of coffee. I was not working at the time. I had recently made quite a sizable profit trading stock options and was just relaxing and working on some novels I hoped to publish.   
  
“Maybe I should get some meth,” I thought to myself. Meth or amphetamine pills like Adderall or Dexedrine seemed like a good idea at first glance. They would certainly keep sleep away for a long time, maybe even nine or ten days at a time. Hell, they worked well enough for the Blitzkrieg.   
  
But I knew that they also caused psychotic breakdowns and paranoid hallucinations. I feared that in those shattered pieces of reality, the monstrous creature who called itself an angel would come pouring out into my waking life. I quickly dismissed the idea of powerful stimulants.  
  
I knew there were various legal stimulants based on alterations to caffeine that one could purchase online, such as theacrine or methylliberine. But, like caffeine themselves, these had the drawback of being somewhat weak as well as rapidly building up a tolerance with excessive use. They might help keep sleep away for a couple days, but they would quickly become useless with extended sleep deprivation.  
  
“Shit,” I said, taking another sip of coffee as the sun started to peek above the hills outside. Red streaks like rivers of blood covered the shadowy clouds.  
  
I didn’t know it at the time, but I was seeing the beginning of what would become the worst day of my entire life.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
I went into the bathroom as the sun rose outside, yawning, my eyes tearing. I hadn’t slept well for the last week, ever since I had first glimpsed that nightmarish figure’s face in my dream. Like a rapidly-growing tumor, it had taken over more and more of my life with every passing encounter.  
  
I looked in the mirror, expecting to see myself- a pale, thin man with dark bags under his eyes. But I saw Friend looming there instead. It stood exactly where I did, reflecting my every movement. Friend’s skeletal, bony face contorted into human expressions of shock and fear. Then it abruptly broke off the charade, grinning at me, unhinging its jaw like a snake. I backed up suddenly, but its head ratcheted toward me in a blur as if its neck had gears and wheels instead of muscle. It raised its arms and reached through the mirror, wrapping its arms around my chest and pulling me forward.  
  
I screamed and thrashed against the abomination, fighting it as it drove its rattlesnake fangs into my neck. I felt a burning explosion of pain radiating out through my body. Everything felt cold, and then I felt myself spinning backwards as if out of a tunnel.  
  
Friend crawled out, pushing its skeletal hand against the burnt mark on my chest. Then it vanished, shimmering out of existence like an evaporating mirage. I was pushed backwards into the dark pits of my mind, but I could still see through my eyes as Friend took over my body.  
  
Friend looked in the mirror. In a strange, split way, both of us saw out of the same pair of eyes. My true reflection had returned. An insane, sadistic smile broke out across my lips. It was an expression I had never imagined seeing on my own face. In the prison within my mind, I screamed, but the angel had all the power now.  
  
I watched helplessly as it dressed my body and grabbed the pistol and car keys from my bedroom. I tried to fight it with every ounce of my being, but it felt like a toddler fighting a professional boxer. Friend easily pushed me back down as it walked confidently out into a beautiful, sunny day, showing off its new body proudly.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
I beat and fought as Friend drove through town in my car, the pistol gripped firmly in my hand, the knuckles white with tension. When I saw Friend pull into my parents’ house, I shuddered. A freezing sensation seemed to come over me.  
  
I had to watch as Friend went through, murdering every person I knew and loved over the course of the next twelve hours. I still remember the gaping bullet holes in their foreheads, the shocked and confused expressions frozen forever on their pale, dead faces.  
  
By the time that day had ended, I had seen over a dozen of my closest friends and family murdered in horrible ways. The police and media were all over the area by now, and though Friend was savvy enough to get us both out of there without getting caught, he abandoned my body as the sun started to set. I found myself standing in the middle of the deep woods, far off any trail, watching the darkness close in like a descending curtain. The crickets hummed their musical tunes all around me. My mind felt shattered, seeing these final moments of beauty after such scarring visions.  
  
I know the cops are looking for me and that I have nothing to go back to now. Friend took everything from me. I have the pistol here. It seems to glare up at me. The angel has left me all alone for the last act. Whatever that thing that calls itself Friend is, I think it feeds off the suffering and death it causes. It shatters people’s lives and then flees, grinning like a blood fiend at a fatal car wreck.  
  
I just wanted someone to know the truth before the end, though, even if it’s only one other person who reads this. I never intended to hurt anyone. It was all the fault of that thing- the creature with the rotted wings and the black, lidless eyes.
