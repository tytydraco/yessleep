“What do you mean there are *houses* in there?” Chet asked as he and Billy walked back to the car, purchases from the gas station in hand.

“I mean there’s houses,” Billy answered, tearing the wrapper off of his brownie and stuffing half of it into his mouth immediately.  “Like, real houses.”

“Just in the park?”

“Just in the park.”

“Like,” Chet started as he put the car in reverse and opened up a Slim Jim at the same time, “Like, I’m just walking down a trail in the Smokies, and then I turn a corner, and, BOOM, there’s a two story house around the bend?”

Billy smacked Chet on the back of the head.

“No, not like that, you dumbfuck.  It’s its own section of the park.  You have to drive down a couple of roads to get there, but once you’re there, it’s like a little town that’s all by itself in the middle of nowhere.  There’s, like, eight or ten of them, plus a clubhouse.  I guess a bunch of rich people bought land near the park and built these little getaway houses down there, but then they all died and the park bought them, so now they’re just empty.”

“And we can go into them?”

“Sure.”

“So why don’t we go into them while they’re open?  Like, during the day?”

Billy sighed dramatically.  “I’m not going to call you a dumbfuck *again*, but you’re really acting like one today, Chet.  Haven’t you ever done anything fun?”

“Well, there was the time we went to Dollywood…”

“DUMBFUCK!”

“I thought you weren’t going to call me that anymore…”

“Sorry, man,” Billy said, “but sometimes…”

“Okay, okay, I’ll stop asking questions.”

“Good.”

“Right after this one:”

Billy groaned.

“If these houses are so cool,” Chet continued over the theatrics, “then why are we going to go into them at night, when it’s dark, and no one’s around and…”  He trailed off.

Billy grinned, “I think you just answered your own question.”

Chet smiled in returned as Billy finished with:

“You dumbfuck.”

“Come on, dude,” Chet said as he turned a corner and punched Billy lightly on the arm, “Call Mercy and Janey and tell them to meet us at my place.  I’m not going into this place alone with you at night.”

“*Sure*,” Billy said, getting out his phone and punching in a text, “you’re in a gay panic over me, that’s why you want the two cutest girls we know to come with us into the dark, mysterious, forbidden park tonight to have fun.  It’s got nothing to do with--”

“Shut up, dumbfuck,” Chet replied, trying his best to hold back a smile and failing miserably.

The boys killed some time in Chet’s basement for a few hours before Mercy and Janey finally arrived, Mercy carrying a large backpack that was clearly taking some effort to lift.  As she descended the steps into the basement, Chet jumped up and took the bag off of her shoulders.

“My hero,” Mercy quipped, rolling her eyes affectionately.

“Hey, always the knight in shining armor,” Chet replied, adjusting the backpack to get a more comfortable grip.  “What the hell do you have in here, anyway, rocks?”

“Better than that.  Put it on the table and let’s all take a look.” Chet got it to the kids’ table that had traveled with him and his family to Tennessee (even though he’d outgrown it years ago) and unshouldered the pack with the lightest groan he could muster.   Mercy elbowed him out of the way, her long brown hair briefly falling over her shoulder and brushing against Chet’s arm as she began pulling supplies out of the backpack.

“Spray Paint.  Stink bombs.  Spray paint.  Crowbar…”

“A crowbar?” Chet yelped.

“Fireworks, Tent, Chairs, Spray paint…”

“Wait, why are we bringing a crowbar?”

Mercy paused, looking annoyed.  

“Why are we bringing a crowbar, Chet?”

“Yeah,” Chet replied, looking a little sheepish under Mercy’s stare.  “I mean, I thought all the houses were open.”

“They are,” Billy said from across the basement as he and Janey kept their heads bent over a map of the park, “but…”

“*But*” continued Mercy, “there are parts of them that are sealed off.  There are rooms in the cabins that you normally can’t get to…”

“How big are these cabins anyway?  Sometimes you guys make it sound like they’re huts and sometimes it sounds like they’re mansions.”

“They’re houses, but they’re not huge.  I think all of them are one story, right, Janey?”

“Yeah,” yelled Janey, still not looking up from the map “But the clubhouse might be more than one level.  I can’t be sure.  My folks took me out there years ago, but it’s been a long time…”

“And a lot of tokes in between” finished Billy, chuckling as Janey cuffed him on the back of the head, then pulled him in for a quick kiss.

“Fuck you, Billy,” she said as they broke apart.  “But, yeah, Chet, there’s a clubhouse.  I’m not sure if we’re going to be able to make it in there in time…”

“No, fuck that,” Billy said, “I’ve been around all the other houses when I’ve visited during the day, but I’ve never been in the clubhouse.  We’re *definitely* getting in there tonight.”  He walked over to the play table, moved some of the cans of spray paint out of the way, and put the map down.  Janey followed.

“We’ll need to go into the park and stash our car here,” he said, pointing to a picnic area on the map, “Then we can…”

“No,” Mercy countered, quickly overtaking the conversation, “we’re not parking there.”

“Why not?  It’s a short walk,” asked Billy, with a whine in his voice.

“Be*cause*,” Mercy continued, “it’s *too* short of a walk.  If we get caught…”

“We’re not gonna,” both Janey and Billy interjected, only to be stopped by an upraised hand from Mercy.

“*If* we get caught--*if* we get caught, we don’t want the car to be too close--the rangers and whoever else is down there in the middle of night, the first place they’re going to look is that picnic area parking lot.  If we park here,” she punctuated the last word by laying a black-polished fingernail down on the map at a campground, “not only will we *still* be close, but we’ll have plausible deniability.”

“What’s that?” asked Chet, even though he knew--he just liked to hear Mercy talk.

“It means it’ll be easier to say ‘It couldn’t have been us,Mr. Ranger, we’ve been here all night,’” Mercy said, batting her eyelashes dramatically and innocently for effect, “and the tents and other camping stuff in our car will back that up.  *Plus*, it’s much easier to believe a car parked all night at a campsite as opposed to a picnic area,”  she said then, she pointedly looked at her sister and Billy, and finished, “*Isn’t* it?”

“Yeah, yeah,” said Janey.

“Of course, all that’s *if* we get caught, which we won’t as long as you two shut up and listen to me.”

“Okay” sulked Billy.

“Good.  Now let’s get something to eat.  It’s going to be a long night.”

After a quick stop at Taco Bell (resulting in a small mess in Chet’s car that he didn’t mind so much, given Mercy’s role in making it and helping him clean it up), the quartet drove into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and made their way past the Sugarlands Visitor Center and down the winding, painfully low speed limit road to the Elkmont Campground, where they were lucky enough to find a parking spot.  They pulled in and Mercy distributed backpacks to the group.

“Why’d you give me the heaviest one?” Billy whined as he hoisted the backpack onto his shoulders.  

“They’re all the same weight,” Mercy explained as she almost effortlessly picked up her pack.  “I put the same amount of stuff in each one…” she paused.  “Give or take.”

“Yeah, feels like a lot of fucking ‘give’ on my pack,” Billy whined as he started up the trail.  Janey sidled along next to him.

“Come on, big guy.  You stay with me and I’ll make sure to keep you…occupied while we kill time before dark.”

Janey and Billy, whose backpack now appeared to be much lighter, sprinted to the trailhead and started off on their own, leaving Chet and Mercy to start the hike to their hiding place together.

“So, how are you feeling?” Mercy asked as they kept a much more leisurely pace than their partners.

“What do you mean?”

“Come on, Chet, ever since we got over to your house, you’ve been on edge.  Don’t tell me you’re going to chicken out tonight.”

Chet looked at Mercy, then quickly down at the trail, then back to straight ahead before he answered.

“What?  Me?  Chicken out?  No way…”

“Hey, Chet,” she tried to reassure him as she punched him on the arm, “it’s okay.  We’ve--me and Billy and Janey--we’ve all gone out doing graffiti and stuff like this before…”

“Oh, I know--Billy’s told me *all* about that stuff.  I’m sorry my family hadn’t moved here yet when you guys went and spraypainted the train in Knoxville.  That sounded wild.”

Mercy giggled, which made both her and Chet blush.  “It really was.  And, think about it--now those train cars will have our art on them for the whole country to see!”

“Yeah--someone stuck at a railroad crossing in Ohio somewhere will get to see Billy’s spraypaint portrait of a dick with three balls!”

Mercy’s giggle grew, now in danger of becoming a full throated laugh.  “Okay, maybe *art* is overstating it, but it was still pretty cool.”

“How did you guys manage not to get caught?”

“It’s easy if you plan it out.  For the train yard, we just made sure there was always a lookout and then we all took turns spraypainting the freight cars.  You pack plenty of supplies, get a schedule, and then plan for anything that can go wrong.”

“Is that what you’ve done for tonight?”

“Pretty much.  We’ve got tons of supplies, we should be able to go into a bunch of these houses and have some fun before we get tired or get caught.”

“You don’t think we’re going to get caught, do you?”

Mercy shrugged, her shoulder brushing up against an errant lock of hair.

“Always the risk.”  Then she gave Chet a smile that made him stumble on the trail “But where’s the fun if there’s no risk?”

“I don’t know--I’ve never done anything like this before…”

“Jesus, Chet,” Mercy said, coming close enough to punch him on the shoulder again, “didn’t your mother ever have any kids that lived?”

“Ha ha.  But, seriously, is there a plan other than chaos and vandalism?  And is there a plan in case we get caught?”

Another shrug.  “I mean, as far as Billy’s concerned,” at this they heard an unmistakable yelp from up ahead on the trail as if he’d heard his name and answered, “the only plan is graffiti, stink bombs, stuff like that.”

“What about as far as you’re concerned?”

“Why are you interested in *my* concerns, Chet?”

Chet turned bright red and focused on his feet, walking one in front of the other, on the trail.  “Oh, you know, no reason, none at all, except…”  He stopped when he felt Mercy’s hand on his arm, bringing them both to a halt on the packed dirt.

“Listen, Chet, you’re cute.  Get a little confidence--starting tonight--and maybe we can spend some time together *outside* of vandalism.”  At this, she hurried ahead of him, even though it wasn’t quite fast enough to catch up with Janey and Billy.

“Wait--” Chet said, hurrying to match Mercy’s pace. “So you’re saying that if I show you some guts tonight, we could maybe do something together without those two?”

Up ahead on the trail, they could hear Billy and Janey shrieking over something.

Mercy looked directly at Chet.  “I said maybe.  There’s a lot to do tonight.  Show me that you’re up for this, that I can count on you, and maybe…”

“Hey are you two making out yet????” Billy yelled from up around a bend in the trail.

“Or are we the only ones who know how to live?” Janey added as they both cackled.

“Maybe,” Mercy finished as she dashed away and around the same bend from which Chet could still hear Billy and Janey laughing.  

Even the kissing noises that Billy and Janey were making couldn’t dampen Chet’s spirits as he moved up to join the group.

They stayed near a viewpoint for the next few hours, sitting on some benches, and taking turns to keep an ear out for the ranger and an eye on potential hiding spots in case they were joined by that ranger or anyone else.  Billy and Janey had brought along a forty and some joints, both of which were passed around liberally, but seemed to be only really enjoyed by their owners.  After the third or fourth pass of the joint that she’d refused, Mercy finally said “Someone needs to have their head on straight.”

Chet, who was in the process of taking a small sip (the only kind he’d allowed himself after he’d seen Mercy pass once), nodded.  “Yeah, guys, maybe we ought to cool it.”

“Fuck off, *guy*,” Billy said playfully as he took another puff.  “We’re out here to have a good time, and this is the best way to get the party started.”

“Yeah, and when we get down there and actually start doing shit, you two are going to be so blitzed that a ranger won’t have any trouble finding us--and our spray paint, and our stink bombs, and our…”

“Okay, okay,” Janey said mid puff as she butted the joint, then dug a hole in the dirt and buried it.  “No more, okay?”

“But--” Billy began, trying to get up before Janey not very forcefully pushed him back down into his seat.

“No, no, the Girl Scout’s right, for once…”

“For ONCE?” 

Janey held up a hand.  “For once.  Let’s all settle down and keep it clear--or clearer.  Besides,” she said as she sat down on Billy’s lap, “I can think of other ways we can have fun.”

As the dark settled in and Chet and Mercy tried desperately to do anything to not look at Billy and Janey making out, the sounds of the park got quieter around them.  They could hear families going to their cars (some with children crying, some with children laughing, some with children just talking--but there were plenty of children making noise), hikers returning to the campground, the sounds of ranger footsteps moving through Elkmont, both on foot and by car, and then, silence.  

After five minutes, Janey got off Billy’s lap, allowing him to get up as well.  They both started to get off the trail and go back towards the park.

“Wait!”

“*What*, Mercy?”

“Ten more minutes.”

Janey pouted.  

“Fine.”

“And stay quiet,” Mercy warned, pointing a finger towards her and Billy.

“And what are we supposed to do to pass the time?  Our phones don’t work out here” Billy pouted

“Count to six hundred.”

Chet smiled, but only for a second; he thought he could hear noises from the parking lot.  Was it human footsteps?  Or was it just a chipmunk moving through on its way back to the woods?  Either way, the skittering sound persisted for a few minutes (until Chet, even though the instructions weren’t for him specifically, was about halfway through his count to six hundred), then faded off into the distance.  After that, there was as much silence as one usually gets in nature.  Chet looked at Billy and Janey, and saw that they were looking at Mercy expectantly.  Almost instantly, Chet found himself doing the same.  Mercy looked at them and nodded.

“Let’s go.”

They moved out of their hiding spot, Mercy in the lead, with several feet in between each of them per her instructions, Chet in second position.  As he entered the parking lot, he saw that, just as they’d heard, all the cars had exited and the parking lot was empty.

“Whoa,” Chet said without thinking, before being quickly shushed by all three of the other members of his party.

Mercy motioned to him to follow her and they walked down a small bend in the road and entered Daisy Town.

Chet had to admit that it was almost exactly as Billy and Mercy had described.  There was a large avenue in between two equal rows of houses.  Even in the dark, Chet could see that, while the houses were all similar in size and design, there was a variety of colors, from standard white or brown to deep blues and reds.  The houses had no second floors, and it looked as though most had multiple points of access.

“They don’t lock these at night?” Chet asked in a low whisper as he finally got close to Mercy.

“We’re about to find out,” she replied as she grabbed his arm and pulled him towards the first house and tried the door, which opened with no resistance.  Mercy turned and gave Billy and Janey a silent thumbs up, which was returned as they entered the house across the street, surprisingly staying relatively silent.

“Hey, check this out,” Mercy said, shining a flashlight to light their way as they explored what looked to be the living area of the house.  The moonlight illuminated parts of the house, but her artificial light was still helpful; there was a fireplace, and in a connected room Chet could see a sink and counter tops.  Mercy’s light was shining on a wall near the fireplace.

“Are those electrical outlets?” he asked.

“Yeah, they’re in most of these places.”

“I thought that these guys bought the houses to get away from everything…”

“I guess there were things they couldn’t live without, even when they were on vacation.”

There was a pause as they both looked around the abandoned house, trying to imagine what it was like with a family, vacationing, enjoying nature just outside of their doors.  As he gazed around the room, Chet even saw height marks on the kitchen wall, which led him to a question he’d been meaning to ask for awhile.

“Hey, Mercy, this is going to sound weird, but…”

The hesitation in his question hung in the air like mist after a rainstorm.

“Where are the bathrooms?”

“Why, do you have to break the seal after *all* that Mickey’s?”

“Shut up.”

She giggled quietly in response and gestured towards a room past the kitchen.

“This way.”

“I’m sure Billy and Janey have already found one in their house by now, but it’s something I haven’t been able to stop thinking abo--”

Chet paused as he rounded the corner and nearly ran into a frame of plexiglass, behind which sat a simple toilet and faucet.  Mercy giggled.

“They block them off?  Why do they do that?”

“Well, for one thing, a lot of kids…”

“*We’re* kids, Mercy.”

“Yeah, but, like, *kid* kids, come in here on tours and shit, you know?  So what happens when Junior has to take a leak and…”

“And there’s a bathroom right here, I get you.  What’s the other thing?” Chet asked as Mercy got a spray paint can out of her backpack and started looking for an appropriate graffiti spot.

“Huh?”

“The other thing that means you’d put a bathroom behind glass.”

“Oh, that. Have you met Billy?”

Suddenly, almost as if on cue, there was an explosion of banging from the house across the street.

“He wants to take a shit in one of these toilets so badly.  Ever since he started dating Janey, I’ve heard about it at least once a week,” Mercy said as she pulled her phone out of her pocket, immediately trying to text, then putting it back with an annoyed grunt.  “No service,” she said, almost to herself more than to Chet, “I forget that that happens when you come into the park.  Come with me,” she said, taking Chet’s hand and running out of the house and toward the banging.

“You didn’t think to bring walkie talkies?”

“A girl can’t be expected to think of *everything*, can she?” Mercy replied as they mounted the steps to another house and entered, the banging sound getting louder as Mercy led Chet to the back room.

“Will you knock that shit of--” Mercy began in an outraged whisper as they saw Janey attempting in vain to haul Billy away from the glassed in bathroom.  It was at that moment that the quartet saw a splash of headlights across the walls of the room and heard the low purr of an SUV come down the road.

“Oh, shit,” Janey said in a voice just above a whisper; she would have said more, but she was shushed with a motion from Mercy, who was glaring daggers at Billy.  He looked slightly embarrassed.  Mercy pulled out her phone and typed a message, then turned the screen around so that Billy and the rest could see it:

“I TOLD YOU TO BE CAREFUL AND QUIET AND YOU COULDN’T EVEN DO THAT!  NOW WE MIGHT GET CAUGHT BECAUSE YOU’RE SO FUCKING STUPID!!!!”

Billy opened his mouth to respond, but Chet grabbed his arm and shook his head.  The engine slowed down outside, eventually coming to a complete stop.  The four teens crouched down, waiting to hear the door open, but that sound never came.  The engine started back up again and the SUV rolled down the road, its sound dwindling eventually to nothing.  The group let out a collectively held breath.

“Mercy, I’m sorry, but I wasn’t…”

“Shut the fuck up, Billy.  If you’d just listened to me, everything would be fine.”

“Everything *is* fine, Mercy, the ranger didn’t even get out of her--”

“Yeah, she didn’t this time, Billy, but what happens next time?  You know that they do check-ins all the time.  We’ve got to get moving.  If you want to visit the club house so fucking bad, we need to go.  *Now*.”

Janey held up  a spraypaint can.  

“What about tagging the houses?”

Mercy rolled her eyes.  

“Do the outsides on the way.  Just one picture or a few words on each.  We need to get moving.”

The walk from the houses to the clubhouse would have taken two minutes at a brisk walk on a normal tour of Daisy Town.  With the stops to tag houses, and between Billy and Janey’s arguing about whether to add an an extra testicle or breast to their pictures, it wound up taking about five.  Once the four teens gathered at the wooden porch that housed the entrance to the clubhouse, Billy reached into his backpack and pulled out a crowbar, then, after one look at Mercy, lowered the tool.

“Good call,” she said with a smirk as she readied her own crowbar.  “This is something that requires a woman’s touch.  Stand back.” 

Everyone else did as she asked, and, with minimal effort, Mercy popped her crowbar into the small gap between the door and its frame, and with only a tiny crack, popped the door open.

“Nice work, sis,” Janey tittered as the group entered the Appalachian Clubhouse.

“Holy shit,” Billy whispered.

“You can say that again,” Chet replied in an equally hushed voice.

“Holy shit,” said Billy, a little louder this time and with no rebuke from Mercy as he and Janey giggled nervously and began to enter the ballroom.

The large ballroom smelled empty, as though it hadn’t been used by a large group of people in many years.  And yet, there was the sense that it had been occupied by large groups for most of its existence.  The tables were spaced out evenly, and even though the park was covered in a blanket of darkness, there was still a vibrant shine to the parquet floor.  The tables were covered with shimmering white tablecloths, and although there were no utensils or glassware on them, it was easy to imagine the simple white plate, the glasses for water and wine, and the expertly placed forks for each course.  The one piece of decoration each of them possessed was a simple wide brimmed straw hat with a plain black hat band.  The simple wooden folding chairs attempted to add an air of rustic simplicity that was offset by the rest of the room, particularly the wall sconces and lighting fixtures.

The ceiling was high, higher than it seemed from outside, with several open skylights allowing starlight into the ballroom.  Chet and Mercy could see multiple points of entry for servants, waiters, and busboys, as well as a large stone fireplace.  Even though they all knew that the building was only one story, they still looked around for stairs, convinced that there was another level, something above them, because a building that housed a room like this felt as if it could go on forever, continuing to offer sights and sounds for its guests.

“Let’s go--get your spray paint cans out,” Billy commanded as he unshouldered his backpack and began unzipping it.   “Let’s make sure we leave a mark in here.”

“Billy, hold on,” Chet said, moving forward and pointing at the tables.  “Are we sure we want to tag this place?  It’s…it’s really cool in here, man.”

“Are you fucking kidding me, dude?  Look,” Billy replied, gesturing with his spray paint can, “we’ve been down here more times than I can count, planning on just getting into Daisytown.  I didn’t think in a million fucking years that I’d actually get into this Clubhouse.  And now that I *am* here, you can bet your ass that I’m--”

“Okay, okay,” Janey intervened, stepping between the two boys.  “I know it looks cool in here, Chet, but Billy’s right.  We’ve wanted to do this *forever*, and now looks like our best chance.”

“Yeah, usually these two don’t display the best critical thinking skills, but I’m going to have to go along with them this time,” Mercy added.  “We’ve never made it this far, and, yeah, you’re right, this room is beautiful, but there’s no way we leave here without committing some light vandalism.  You can do what you want, Chet, but remember what we talked about on the way in…”

“Okay, okay,” Chet conceded, “let’s go for it, but let’s *also*,”

“Move quickly,” Mercy finished for him, “because we don’t have much time.”

Her last few words were cut off by the hiss of paint from Billy’s can as he moved from table to table.

Chet sighed, pulled out his own spray paint can, and looked around the room for something to tag.  It was difficult.  He didn’t want to make any damage to the facility, even though he knew that any mark that he made would likely be cleaned up in less than twenty four hours.  But watching Billy, Janey, and Mercy all enjoying themselves as moved around the room was beginning to become infectious.  He finally settled on an out of the way wall sconce, but paused on his way over to look at a picture that was hanging over the mantle.  

It was, not surprisingly, a black and white portrait of several families taken just outside of the Appalachian Clubhouse.  Normally, he would have passed right by it, but Chet’s attention was caught by the fact that all of the men in the picture were wearing the same hat: a straw, wide brimmed hat with a black band. None of the children or the women were wearing any kind of head covering--no bonnets for the little girls, no kerchiefs for the women.  Only the men.  While normally he wouldn’t have looked at the picture twice, the hats caused him to stop and study it, then took one step closer to the picture just to make sure, and turned back to the dining room to confirm: the hats the men in the picture were wearing were the same as the ones that were at the center of each table.  He looked back at the picture.  The faces of the past peered out at him.  No one was smiling, they were all staring straight ahead, their mouths set; they didn’t look as though they were anticipating entering the clubhouse and enjoying an evening together.  The picture held no warmth or joy.  They were all simply present. 

There was a small placard under the picture that read “The Chappies, 1928”

 Chet was still staring back at the men in hats when he felt a hand on his shoulder.  He jumped in surprise.

“Hey, what are you planning on--” Mercy started, but she didn’t get a chance to finish her sentence.  Chet had tripped over his own feet and went tumbling toward the fireplace.  The spraypaint can went flying out of his hands and clattered to the ground, the cap flying off and twirling on the parquet floor.  Chet splayed his hands out in front of himself to catch his fall, and as he tumbled toward the wall, he blindly grabbed onto a protruding wall sconce in a last ditch effort to brace his fall.  Seizing onto it, he felt the wall decoration yield ever so slightly, and heard a small click as the sconce supported his weight.  As he recalibrated himself, Chet heard a grinding sound emanating from the floor near the front door.  He turned, not believing what he was seeing, and observing similar looks from the rest of the group as a hatch opened in the floor, revealing a spiral staircase.
