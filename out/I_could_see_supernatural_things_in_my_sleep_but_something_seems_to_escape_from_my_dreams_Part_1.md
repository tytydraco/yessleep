This nightmare was awful; it felt too real. Almost like it was warning me against this thing... but let me start from the beginning.

I have been seeing visions of the future for almost a decade in my dreams, but also in supernatural situations like talking to dead relatives. I have a few dead relatives, but I remember four occurrences: two supernatural and two that imply the future.:

1st time was my uncle. When my aunt and uncle came to visit, they slept in the house with us. I believe that all of those dreams were started by me, so when I went to sleep, I said hi to my uncle and realized I was lucid dreaming, which means I can move and talk freely. So does my uncle. I started walking with my uncle and we were just talking when suddenly his dad, who had died just a month prior from prostate cancer, appeared out of nowhere and started speaking. He sounded just like he did in real life, looked just like him, acted, and cracked jokes just like he did. My uncle was tearing up and went for a hug. I shook his hand since I didn't know him well. After ten minutes of talking, his father said he needed to go, my uncle said "thank you for this conversation" and when my uncle and I turned around, we woke up, at the same time. I thought it was strange but I ignored it.

The second time was the same situation, but it was my dad and my grandpa I never met. When we met, my dad broke out in tears and gave him the biggest hug in the world, and I gave him a very formal handshake. My dad told him stories about what happened in life and stuff he wanted to tell him, about his wife, my mom, and a whole lot of other stuff. This time he was able to talk his heart out, and it was a long time. I really didn't mind it, it was his father, and when the time has come, he said "well, this was absolutely necessary for me, thank you" and walked back. We both woke up. After my dad woke up, he got up from the bed, went to the living room, sat on the couch, and cried. I joined him since I was in the dream with him. I told him that I saw and heard the dream he was in and that we can remember this story together. He hugged me and we watched TV to cheer up. Now, this is the part of the story where I found out I can see the future and when I found this out

This happened in late 2020 when my mom had Covid. I had a vision of my mom sitting in a blank hospital room under negative pressure, surrounded by books with a message "treat her better, or else" on the book she was reading. She was born 27 weeks early, which caused her health issues. But the positive is that she has a condition that allows her to have an enriched imagination, which caused her to become an avid reader.

Since that situation in 2020, I have had no vision of anything. When this happened, I was confused and scared.

So this dream started with me getting up from bed, taking my medication, and eating a pre-made panini in my fridge. Then I got a call from my dad, which made me confused. The first thing that made me confused is my phone actually worked in my dream, which doesn't happen normally. But I picked it up and my dad was in a tow truck from work, he asked me to check the tax letter to see if he forgot anything. After telling my dad that everything was in order, he said okay, but then I heard him yell "SHIT" followed by a loud impact and a phone being thrown against something, which caused a deaf tone.

"CRAP," I thought to myself since it was 10 PM and this was my fear. I sat on my bed and cried, but 10 minutes later the doorbell rang, so I opened the door, and there my dad was. He looked... off…

One thing I neglected to mention is that I feel a certain way around strangers, and this feeling was present around my dad. I asked him "who is that behind you" so he looked back and I closed the door.

He started banging on it, not like a "bang bang bang bang bang" but pounding, Mike Tyson punches that were completely unlike him. Thank you, gut, for saving me.

I heard my phone ring, so I picked it up and my dad was not on this number. It was a random number. When I answered, he told me to open the door. Most of the conversation is lost by me, but at the end, I heard what sounded like a banshee screech, then the lights and what little visibility was left outside disappeared, and It looked like a black curtain was placed in front of the windows. When this happened, I sat in the corner of the living room and cried. Luckily, I woke up.

But what can this mean? What can this thing be? And most importantly, what does this predict?

Unfortunately, I discovered it 1 month ago, and its not a pretty story…

I don’t have much time left, but whatever you do, don’t pick up the phone, or whatever device you use for phone calls in your dreams.
