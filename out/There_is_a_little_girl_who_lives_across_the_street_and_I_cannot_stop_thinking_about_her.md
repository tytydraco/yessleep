Sophia was a magnetic child.  
  
With her long, delicate curls and chestnut brown eyes, Sophia was an enigma. I would often catch her staring at me from her window upstairs while I watered the plants, her piercing gaze traveling with my every movement, yet her eyes were unmoving. Like she was in a portrait. Her eyes were at once pools of innocence and pain—deep, tragic pain that she wordlessly begged to be rescued from.  
  
Or so I thought.  
  
“Don’t you see it? She looks so… sad.” I told my husband while we sipped coffee one evening in our balcony.  
  
Sanjay bit into a biscuit and shrugged. “Who knows,” he said, with an air of nonchalance. “You’re reading too much into this.”  
  
Of course, Sanjay had neither the time nor patience to be vested in the affairs of our neighborhood. His hours at the hospital greatly occupied his mental faculties, with frequent midnight calls for emergency surgery.  
  
I, on the other hand had decided to take a break from my engineering career, after suffering another panic attack during a work presentation. When I wasn’t baking cakes or transforming our balcony into a mini nursery, I would stare at the house across our street, a dilapidated leaden-blue house with paint peeling off in the corners. The house had been barren for the longest time until Sophia and her father, a reticent single parent who responded to my chirpy greetings in monosyllables, moved in the beginning of summer.  
  
There was no moving truck, no commotion, just an old, battered van that rolled up into the driveway one day and was emptied in a few hours.  
  
Sophia was a quiet, withdrawn kid. I never found her to participate in the colony’s various festivities—the summer movie nights in Mandira’s house, the evening games and ice cream runs, not even when the kids would sit by the road and chat. Of course, they were unperturbed by her absence, perhaps using it as initial fodder for their gossip before they grew oblivious to her existence.  
  
Mandira and I had become friends over the past couple of months. She was the only other married woman on our street who didn’t have children, but unlike me, reveled in surrounding herself with them. She shared my love for dessert and my unabashed delight for gossip, which melded perfectly for our evening conversations.  
  
“Do you even know his name?” I asked her over chai.  
  
“My husband introduced himself when they moved here.” she began. “He said his name was Pradeep. He seemed introverted. Manish tried inviting him and his daughter over, but we never heard back from them.”  
  
“Strange.”  
  
“I know. But I also noticed that his daughter is pretty shy. It's that awkward age, you know. She's probably 8, 9 years old? And I think she takes after her father. Or maybe he just doesn’t want to pressure her.”  
  
“Maybe.”  
  
“Listen, why don’t you stay back for dinner? I know you said Sanjay’s working late tonight, anyway.”  
  
I left Mandira’s house at 11pm that night. It was a cool summer night with a delicate breeze cradling the trees. Manish insisted he’d walk me home, but I wanted to have a quiet stroll, all by myself.  
  
As I approached my house, a pair of dim headlights inched up the street. I watched as the silhouette of a sedan rolled up the curb and stalled. Around me, the breeze quietened to a blanket of warm, still air. I shuffled home quickly but not before peering into the windshield of the car, hoping for a glimpse of the driver.  
  
For a split second, I stared into a pair of dark, vacant eyes that could only belong to Pradeep.  
  
I would never forget that stare.  
  
The news of an unidentified body occupied an obscure corner of the newspaper a few days later. She had been found in the outskirts of the city in a state of undress, marks of strangulation visible across her neck. A cyclist had noticed her body splayed in a thicket by the side of the road. Poor woman, I thought to myself. I was trying to ignore the news these days—when the media was not pouncing on stories of burgeoning crime and unemployment, they were fervently composing thought-pieces connecting the two.  
  
My therapist had advised me over the last few months to reduce consumption of any triggering content, but on days like these, when Sanjay was immersed in 40-hour shifts, news and crime podcasts kept me company.  
  
I wandered into the balcony, watching early signs of monsoon tease the grass. Sophia was absent from her usual position by her window. In fact, the whole street was gray, dreary, and desolate -- rain had started to play spoilsport too soon. Maybe all those reports of global warming arriving earlier than our expectations were true after all.  
  
My thoughts were interrupted by the phone ringing.  
  
“Amrita!” I exclaimed. We’d been in touch over text since our college days, but neither one of us was much of a caller.  
  
“Kavi, listen,” the alarm in her voice was worryingly palpable. “I spoke to Shreya’s mother this morning.”  
  
“Ok?”  
  
“She’s apparently been missing for a few days now. Has she contacted you at all?”  
  
“What? No,” I lowered myself into a chair, heart racing. “You know we hardly…you know she does go off the radar a lot, right?”  
  
“No, this time it’s fishy.” Amrita whispered. “Look, I’ll call you back in a sec. I don’t know any more details but let Aunty know if you hear something.”  
  
Fear surged through my veins. Shreya, Amrita, and I had been inseparable through college, but Shreya and I had grown apart afterward. She had a troubled relationship with her parents which often led to her withdrawing from everyone until her parents would persuade me to counsel her. The cycle continued until I grew anxious and exhausted with the vagaries in her behavior before I eventually distanced myself from her.  
It couldn’t be, could it? I ran my fingers across the news snippet I read earlier. A part of me had occasionally feared the worst for Shreya over the years, but I always chalked it up to my overly paranoid mind.  
  
Amrita’s name flashed across my phone screen.  
  
“Kavi,” she panted, “I think… I think they found her.”  
  
My stomach lurched as I heard her speak. I could barely register the words as a cold wave of shock swept through my limbs.  
  
“They’re going to start an investigation now,” she sobbed.  
  
The funeral was held a few days later. It was a small, somber gathering of a few neighbors trying to placate her inconsolable parents. Amrita and I watched helplessly as Aunty’s shoulders heaved in desperation; her kurta soaked in tears. Uncle sat slumped in a corner; his face wrought with defeat. My eyes wandered from him to the crowd of guests, hoping to see someone from our class.  
  
Standing to the edge of the crowd, dressed in all white, was Pradeep.  
  
A swift chill rushed down my spine.  
  
The police arrived at Pradeep’s house nearly a week later. Apparently, he had been going out with Shreya for a while, until their parents began to vehemently oppose their relationship, sparking differences between them.  
  
“Sir, what will happen to Sophia?” I asked one of the officers.  
  
Sophia tiptoed out of the house, the long sleeves of her dress drooping off her seemingly slender arms. Her eyes were bereft of emotion and fixated in the distance.  
  
“We have a social worker to take her in.” he responded before gesturing to me to move out of the way.  
  
I watched as a middle-aged woman escorted Sophia to one of the cars parked by the street.  
  
“Miss, can I ask you where you’ll be taking her?” I asked the lady, following her to the car.  
  
She pursed her lips and sighed. “Who are you?”  
  
“I live across the street. I am just… really concerned about her.”  
  
“We will be taking her in for a check-up first.” she nodded curtly and ascended the car.  
  
Checkup. Checkup. Was it medical? Psychological? A host of questions swarmed in my head as I watched the car peel away from the curb. The last few weeks had been disturbing to process, to say the least. I had lost my best friend. I was living across the street from a murderer. Added to the mix was the tragedy of this little girl, whose entire existence seemed to be mired with danger, and yet, none of us in the community paid attention. Did Sophia have anyone who really cared for her? Tears flooded my cheeks. I could really use Sanjay at a time like this, I thought.  
  
As if on cue, my phone started to vibrate.  
  
“Sanju?” I sobbed, my shoulders shaking. “Sanju, can you come home?”  
  
“I’m so sorry, Kavi.” Sanju said gravely. “I know how tough this week has been for you. I don’t want you to be alone at home. Can you spend the night at Mandira’s house?”  
  
“You’re not coming home?” I cried louder.  
  
“Kavi,” I could sense the hesitation in his voice to answer further. “They brought Sophia in here. She has some injuries.”  
  
“I want to see her!” I pleaded. “Please let me see her.”  
  
“Kavi...”  
  
“Please,” I begged between convulsive sobs. “You have to let me see her.”  
  
Sanjay drew me into a tight hug as I entered the surgical wing in the hospital. I sunk my head in his shoulder, erupting into sobs. “How…how is she?” I whispered.  
  
He draped his hand around my waist and walked me to the nearest doorway. Sophia lay in the hospital bed motionless. For the first time since I had seen her, her eyes were closed.  
  
“What’s really going on?” I turned to Sanjay.  
  
“Pradeep was an abusive father. He consistently beat her up, even belted her. She has welts all over her arms and legs. She even has a few broken ribs, perhaps from her last encounter with him.”  
  
“Broken…ribs?” I felt sick to my stomach.  
  
“Sadly, yes. To say he had severe anger issues is an understatement. We suspect the fractures are recent. Maybe when he realized he was going to be caught, although it’s uncertain right now.”  
  
I collapsed into a chair.  
  
“Kavi, why don’t you spend the night at Mandira’s house?” Sanjay said gently. “This is a very delicate situation.”  
  
“I don’t want to go anywhere.”  
  
Sanjay sighed. “Ok, why don’t you stay here and… take a few deep breaths, ok?”  
  
“Ok.”  
  
Maybe it was the weariness brought on by the day’s events or all the crying, but I fell asleep. When I woke up, it was almost 4 in the morning.  
  
Sanju walked by with a cup of coffee. “Hey Kavi, were you able to sleep well?”  
  
“I think so,” I yawned. “How is Sophia doing?”  
  
“She’s stable. We’re letting her rest before visitors are allowed.”  
  
“Right, I understand.”  
  
“You know,” Sanjay began grimly, “from what I have learned, the police were able to arrest Pradeep because he was wanted for another murder. He changed his name and identity before he moved here. His actual name is Antony D’Costa.”  
  
“Another murder?”  
  
“Yes. Sophia’s mother. He killed her six months ago and was on the move ever since.”  
  
“Oh my God,” I clutched my stomach. “No wonder that poor girl looked so forlorn all the time.”  
  
“Yes. And do you notice how she’s always so quiet?”  
  
“Uh-huh?”  
  
“The police believe that Pradeep realized that Sophia saw him kill her mother.”  
  
“And?” My heart pounded.  
  
“He cut off her tongue.”
