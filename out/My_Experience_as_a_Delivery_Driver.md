Hey y’all! As the title says, I‘m a delivery driver. I can’t say specifically for which company but you have definitely heard of them. I’ve been working here for roughly 5 months now. This may not seem like a long time, but in an industry with extremely high turnover, I’m closing in on veteran status. Anyways, as you can imagine, I drive quite a bit; roughly anywhere that's maximum an hour 's distance from my warehouse station. The warehouse I operate out of is located in the middle of a forested area many miles from any major city. A lot of people out here rely on us to deliver things they normally would have to commit a lot of time to obtain. I‘m usually out there for 9 hours a day and sometimes close to 12 depending on the time of year. Holidays are generally peak for deliveries. Since I’ve spent so much time driving around anywhere from industrial cities to the boonies, I have a few stories I’d like to share. I hope you enjoy!

- To start off, I thought I’d share a story that was told to me on my first day. After 2 days of classes at the station, I passed my tests and continued onto the next step to becoming a delivery driver; the ride along. My trainer (I’ll call him H since I don’t want to give out names) has worked as a delivery driver for three years now. We had just finished our route and stopped at a nearby corner store in the middle of the boonies for energy drinks. My dumbass emptied the whole can into my metal bottle, causing any future water I drank from it to taste like watermelon monster. When we had exited the store and walked back to our van, I decided to make some small talk.

“Hey H. Has anyone ever seen anything creepy while working here?”

“Ahh… well personally I haven’t,” (I later learned he most definitely lied to me. He didn’t want to scare me off. I had done a good job my first day and he wanted me to stay on the team. Thanks, H!) “But I do know a couple guys who’ve seen some things.”

He then went on to share this. Several of our drivers claim to have seen eyes  hidden behind the trees at night in the boonies. They are always green, and they are always big. Too big to belong to any ‘normal sized head’, as H described. The ‘eyes’ always appear static, as if whatever they belong refuses to move an inch. A few people have claimed to watch them move before they noticed the observer and fixed themselves behind fields of trees, but most who claim to have witnessed them say they don’t move an inch. H told me he saw them. Not just one pair, but multiple pairs concealed behind the thicket of the woods. 

They’re always astonishing when they appear because 1. It’s always at night and 2. They’re unnaturally bright, which can be a dangerous when driving. One theory the drivers have is that they’re goblins but most refused to believe it because goblins are, obviously, small. Another theory is that they are just distant flood lights attached to homes for security purposes. But that wouldn’t explain why they’re green, or why some folks have seen them in plots of land where they know not a single building is located there. Personally, I have never seen them. But I still hear stories from other drivers, sometimes right after they return from their routes, that they had seen them.

- Another story I have comes from myself. Kind of a sad one, actually, so be warned. This was during my early weeks on the job. I had pulled up to a house to deliver an envelope when a little blur ran past my driver's side door. I thought I was seeing things, it had been several hours into my shift, but not dark out yet. I cautiously stepped out of the vehicle and observed my surroundings. There wasn’t anything out of order. Normal house, normal lawn, normal stop. So I began approaching the front door of the home. That’s when I felt something jab into my ankle, almost pushing me over. I looked down. It was a little pitbull puppy and he was playing with my shoes. 

I can’t lie, he was very cute. But the little guy would absolutely refuse to stop biting my shoes. It didn’t hurt or anything, I just wanted to avoid stepping on the snarling puff ball. Closing the 30 foot distance toward the door was difficult. I raised my knees into the air as if I was in a marching band. I decided I would distract the playful pup by dangling the package in front of his face. This was extremely stupid on my part, because the little puppy leaped into the air and snagged it out of my hands. I was dumbfounded, trying to equate in my mind how I was supposed to deliver a package if I had no package to deliver. After standing in a strangers lawn for a few minutes like an idiot I decided to knock on the front door to explain what had happened. A middle aged woman with long brown hair and a tired expression answered.

“Hi! Sorry to disturb you, but I just wanted to let you know, your dog… ugh… stole your package. He ran around to your backyard last time I saw him. Again, I apologize.” I had said.

 The woman looked at me blankly.

“I don’t have a dog.” She said with a blunt tone.

This made everything a million times worse for me.

“Are you sure?” I stupidly asked.

“Yes, I think I would know if I had a dog.”

“Well, he was a puppy,  little pitbull, and he wouldn’t stop biting at my shoes so I tried distract-”

“You said he wouldn’t stop biting your shoes?” She interrupted me, a jolt of energy evolved her demeanor entirely.

“Ah, yeah, you know the fella?” 

I was hoping that maybe she knew who the dog belonged to. That way she could retrieve her package, at least.

“Pinky.” She said while tears abruptly fell down her cheeks.

I learned from the lady that Pinky was her recently deceased dog. Coincidentally, he also loved wrestling with people's shoes. She didn’t go into detail as to what happened to him, but she mentioned that her and her husband had to put the poor guy down for medical reasons. I couldn’t stand to see her cry, so I attempted to lighten up the mood by saying maybe his brother was out running around and carrying his legacy. 

I don’t think it landed, because she made an excuse about putting out her candles and cleaning up the floor of her living room before promptly shutting the door on me. That night when I received my review sheet for the week I had big fat 1 next to the ‘package not received’ statistic.

- Lastly, I’ll share with you all one that still kinda sticks with me since it occurred. It was the dead of night. I was heading toward one of my last stops, driving on a dirt road surrounded by trees. Their limbs leaned over the vehicle, seemingly wanting to yank the van into their dense shrubbery at any moment. 

By now I was familiar with the lay of the land. I knew what street led to what house with such and such quirks that led them to stand out in my mind. But my GPS was taking me to a house where I never remembered there being one. The driveway entrance was supposedly on a 55 mph road that was treated more as a land bridge surrounded by nothing but overgrown grass and trees. But somewhere among that ocean of daunting greenery was a house.

Whenever I feel anxious about something that prevents me from delivering to a stop, I remember what is always chanted by the station managers before we’re sent out after loading up our vans.

‘Strive to finish!’ (If you come back with packages we will be mad and fire you!)

So I sucked it up and made my way to where the GPS took me. The driveway was curvy and uneven, made up of dirt and gravel, and looooong. Roughly a quarter mile. This isn’t unusual out here, but the heaviness in my gut made the trek along this snake-like path seem endless. Actually seeing the house made the weight in my gut fall out my ass and through the grimy polyester seating.

Imagine a late 19th century home that suffered a volcanic earthquake and the fires and smoldered remains were put out with a 100 foot tsunami. Nobody could possibly live here. But someone must have, because I’m the one delivering a package to what was left of their hole and rot ridden front porch. This was a house I had to pause my podcast and remove my earbuds for. I turned on my work phone’s flashlight and proceeded toward the front door, cardboard box in hand. 

The homes’ sullen second story windows loomed over me with each step I took, staring at me as if the front door would open and I would be swallowed into its bowels as its next meal. I set the package down quietly and snapped a quick photo, hauling ass back to the van. I made it. I was safe. Until the front door slowly opened.

It barely hung by its bottom hinge. Admittedly, I waited. I wanted to see who the hell lives here. I probably should’ve just left and finished my route but there are always those quirky houses that make you wonder what type of person lives there. I was about to have my question answered. The homeowner  was exactly what I hadn’t expected. The first thing I noticed was the clean polo shirt, which shined like a beacon against the vans headlights. He had a inoffensive crew cut and wore khakis that hugged his legs tightly.

I watched him approach the package I had just delivered with a robotic walk. He paused for a moment, then bent his legs slowly to pick it up. I was about to throw my van in drive until I heard him speak.

“Hello!” He said enthusiastically.

It quite honestly caught me off guard. Nobody should have the social energy for introductions this late in the day. Expecting a quick conversation, I rolled down my window as he approached with that odd walk if his. It seriously looked like his legs moved on their own. His face locked onto mine his entire journey from the door and to my drivers side window, never breaking his gaze.

“Hello, you enjoying the night time breeze?” I asked casually.

“Hello!” He responded, this time right in my ear.

It made me jolt a little.

“Yeah… hi?” I said. Maybe he didn’t hear me.

“Thank you for delivering my beverage. The package is in excellent condition and I expect its contents will be just as well cared for!” He spoke with assertion.

I then watched him open the package and unwrap what was in it. It was a bottle of children’s shampoo, tear free and everything. My default customer service expression turned to concern as I watched him open the cap and chug the contents of the bottle. It didn’t even look enjoyable for him. His nostrils flared and his eyes turned more and more bloodshot with each gulp. 

I decided, albeit a little too late, to turn my van and leave. I watched him in the side mirror walk back into his collapsed home, empty shampoo bottle in hand. I learned from this experience that there are a lot of weird people, especially in the boonies. I’ve meet a few dozen like him that I feel deserve a future mention.

Regardless, that’s all I got for today. Writing this helped me remember some more stuff I experienced while on the job that I definitely want to share soon. Although, it’s still hard for me to believe what I went through. Anyways, I hope this was interesting to hear about. If anyone has any questions I’d be more than happy to answer them or touch on them in a later update. I’m gonna head to bed. Remember to tip your driver!
