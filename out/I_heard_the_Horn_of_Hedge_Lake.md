My three best friends have been killed.

Alexander, Luke, Emily and I went on a camping trip two weeks ago. Alex knew this spot out at Hedge Lake, a few hours from the apartment the three of them share. I didn’t have much in terms of camping supplies, but Alex and Luke said they had us covered. We packed the gear into Luke’s truck and headed out.

I was so excited. And now they’re gone.

The drive to Hedge Lake wasn’t bad- and the only sign that things would get worse is only really understandable after the fact.

We started realizing all the little things we left or forgot- roasting sticks, coffee filters, sunblock, and we were a bit bummed. As we were going up the little mountain road, winding back and forth nauseatingly, we saw a building appear through the trees. It was one of those almost abandoned gas stations, a flickering red open sign on the door, a single pump and an owner you have to assume carries at least three guns at all times. There weren’t any towns marked closer to Hedge Lake, so we stopped to see if we could get what we needed.

A rusty bell dinged as we entered from the cracked and faded parking lot, and Luke made a face of surprise as the door actually opened.

“Damn, who runs this place?” he muttered.

The teller wasn’t visible, but I could hear the sound of pen scratching against paper from a small office behind the smokes.

We found the supplies we needed, and after a small fight between Alex and Luke on the ideal chip shape, managed to get to the counter in one piece. The teller was still writing in the office. Luke unceremoniously tapped the service bell, and the writing immediately stopped. A chair was shoved back roughly, and very quickly we got a look at the type of person who would own a place like this.

Stringy and weathered, an old man with a scowl so developed that it directed the flow of all the wrinkles on his aged face appeared.

He fidgeted with his pen as he approached the counter, and in silence began to ring up our items.

“How much for the stick lighters?” Luke asked.

The man stared at him in shock, cataracts covering pale eyes and a wide, dumbfounded expression on his face. His jaw snapped shut and posture straightened rigidly, like a tethered puppet held by invisible strings.

“13.50,” a whispered voice croaked from the man.

“The green one, please.”

“Have you heard the Horn?”

“What?”

The clerk extended our receipt in a clammy hand.

“No need to listen for it,” he said with a perverse smile. “The Horn sounds through your bones and your flesh, a silent cacophony of yourself.”

“Let’s get the fuck out, babe” Emily said, pulling Luke from the counter. Alex reached for the receipt, but the clerk kept it gripped in his hand, and the paper was torn in two.

“It calls and calls, but you should not answer. The Horn must be the only song. The only song. The only song worth sing-”

We hurried out of there, convinced of his drug problems and insanity, not giving his words any credit. After these events, I tried to locate him to see what he knows, but I can’t. I’ve driven that road several times in the last week, and searched on satellite, and there is no evidence of there ever being a gas station out there.

The campsite was empty- not abandoned, Alex ensured, but it only had five firepits, and the actual Hedge Lake was an hour hike out from the site. On our first night we set up the tent and investigated around our camp. Nobody else was there, and it was relatively simple. We reached the trailhead to Hedge Lake that we were supposed to take the next day, but went no further. Emily found a few chanterelles, which we sauteed and served on top of the cheeseburgers Luke grilled.

The sounds of the forest really came alive after dark, and we realized just how far out we were. There was nothing but wilderness for miles around.

“This is all mostly BLM property,” Alex explained. “Not sure what they use it for, but it’s protected.”

“Probably some animal reservation, there’s a lot of land set up just to keep the ecosystem normal.” Luke had a smear of marshmallow he was cleaning off of his finger as he said this.

“Usually they say what the land’s for at campsites, though,” Emily said, stoking the fire.

“Yeah, there aren’t many markers at all around here,” I noted. “Let’s make sure not to get lost.”

“I got you guys covered,” Luke said, reaching into his backpack and pulling out a -frankly huge- satellite phone. “Just stay with me, and we can go anywhere. This thing’s got GPS, can call across the world, all kinds of survival shit. I’ve got a solar charger, too!”

“Great, so we’re stuck with you,” I teased.

Luke flipped me off, and I smiled mockingly.

Like the hand of death, a jolting, negative pain erupted from my spine. My back screamed in agony and I dropped my hot tea into my lap, burning myself. I fell off my chair, and couldn’t see for several seconds. A low-pitched, drowning hum and a piercing ring clouded my ears. For those brief few moments I was locked in a blind, senseless, painful prison. I came to with Alex checking on me, and though I was shocked and confused, the pain left after a moment, and everything returned to normal. Except for my tea-burned legs, I was unharmed.

Maybe I’d gone overboard lifting the ice chest, or tweaked my back somehow during the day, but the sudden pain and the damn *ringing* drove me insane. 

Emily was the next to feel it- doubling over in pain as she got a drink from the cooler. She described the same pain I had felt, the same resounding sound that had disturbed me. Only then did we revisit the clerk’s words. 

I was convinced we had heard the Horn he had mentioned. Easy to say, I’m the most superstitious of my friends. Some tweaked out old man rambling about a Horn is one thing- but as soon as I experience that thing? I was ready to pack up that night and drive home. 

I was outvoted, even by Emily, who conceded that it was weird, but was more worried about if the mushrooms she had picked were *actually* chanterelles.

Luke didn’t hear it until we had all gone to bed- shooting straight up in his sleeping bag and shouting out in pain, waking all of us. He said that he had seen something in his dream- before the pain. I took a voice recording on my phone, and I’ve transcribed that here:

“I was here- in the forest. Running fast- running toward something. I remember being drawn towards it, pulled faster than my legs could keep up but I kept running.”

“Did you get there?”

“No. She stopped me.”

*Luke was shaking, rough hands trembling like he was severely dehydrated.*

“Who stopped you?”

“I don’t know- a woman. I was running, and she jumped out in front of me. I think I ran into her. 

Then I woke up and… and I felt it.”

“The Horn.”

*Luke nodded. Alex rolled his eyes.*

“Oh my god, Willow, it’s not a fucking ghost.”

“No, but it’s *something,* Alex! Don’t be dense.”

*Alex shook his head and began to leave.*

“What are you doing? Don’t-don’t go outside!”

Alex left the tent, while Emily, Luke and I commiserated. He came back about fifteen minutes later, sliding into his sleeping bag quietly. When I asked him what he’d been doing, he whispered that he had forced himself to throw up the mushrooms, but didn’t want Emily to feel bad. He had an odd look in his eyes, but I didn’t press him about it. 

We all managed to fall back asleep after a time, but I woke up to hear Emily calling out for Luke, and Alex groggily joining her search. At first we reasoned that he had walked out of sight for an early-morning piss, but when he didn’t come back by the time Alex had a fire going, we got concerned. 

We searched around the campsite, and Emily found some footprints in the muddy camp road nearby. They weren’t from Luke’s boots though, which were missing from the front of our tent. They were bare, human feet that trailed out from the woods and stopped about twenty feet from our campsite. The last set of tracks were pointed directly at our tent, and there was no trail leading away from our site.

I started freaking out, certain that someone or something had come and taken Luke. I think I made Emily even more worried, because she rapidly began throwing things into her backpack.

“Where are you going?” Alex asked her.

“Into the woods- where the footprints came from.” Emily wasn’t giving herself time to feel anything, only focusing on action.

“He could be anywhere, Em. The best plan is to stay here and wait for him to come back. He has the sat phone, right?”

Emily’s face grew paler, and she shot a nervous glance at Luke’s backpack, which still rested inside our tent.

After a tense search, Emily revealed the large phone from his bag. That further convinced me that he had been taken. Luke was a level-headed guy. If he’d meant to go any significant distance from us, he would have both told someone and also taken that phone. 

Alex convinced Emily to not run off and search for him, and I hid my desire to get in his truck and drive off right then and there. I feel guilty about abandoning him so quickly, but honestly, that might have been the right call.

As the sun began to set that night, and Luke still hadn’t returned, a new level of fear kicked in. Every passing moment was a torment of unknowing, and Emily and I had dried up our tear ducts hours ago. We sat in painful silence near an absent fire as Alex paced anxiously near the truck.

“Hello!?” a distant voice called out. It came from the west- towards the trail to Hedge Lake.

“Luke?” Emily cried out.

“Guys? … Hellooo?” The voice echoed in the woods, and we all rushed in its direction.

Emily had placed the sat phone in her bag, which she left by her chair as she ran towards the voice. I had a sixth sense that we were running into trouble, like a bead of sweat down my spine, and grabbed the bag as I ran after her.

“Luke, we’re coming!” Emily called as she reached the trailhead. “Where are you?”

We paused for a moment, waiting for a response.

“Hello!?” the voice called out again, further into the wooded trail. 

Emily, oblivious to my fear, clicked on her flashlight and entered the trail at a jog.

“Where the fuck is he,” Alex muttered as he turned on the flashlight of his iphone.

Emily did cross-country, and was used to running on shitty trails, but Alex and I had trouble keeping up with her, with only his short phone light to guide our ever-darker steps. She kept calling out to him, and he kept answering, but the voice only grew slightly closer. Then, maybe ten minutes after he first called out, Emily stopped dead in her tracks. As Alex and I caught up, she stood perfectly still with her back to us. The shadows from her flashlight shook from the soft trembling of her hand.

“Luke?” Alex called out, waiting for the response. None came.

I walked up to Emily and placed my hand on her shoulder. She didn’t react.

“You alright, Em?” I asked.

Her lip quivered, and her cold teary eyes turned to look at me without shifting her head.

“I hear him,” she whispered. Tears slid down her cheek. “He’s in pain. He needs help.”

Before I could question her on this, a scream pierced the damp forest air around us. It was incredibly close, and though I couldn’t place a direction on it, Emily snapped her neck to the left and darted off the trail into the woods. She moved so quickly that I couldn’t grab her, only cry out as her light danced into the trees. Alex and I stood for a moment, uncertain. 

He shot me a wary glance and asked; “We have to go, right?”

I swallowed in my dry throat, guilty and afraid of my answer. “We don’t have to. But I can’t leave her here. I’m going. You got the car keys?”

“Yep. You got the phone?”

“Yeah.” I took a deep breath. “Fuck it,” I said, and moved into the woods after Emily.

The screaming continued intermittently for several minutes; wordless, excruciating pain. As I write this, I cannot say with any confidence that it was even Luke’s voice crying out. I hadn’t heard anyone scream like this before, and I don’t dare to imagine what would be done to prompt those noises from someone. 

As we trudged through the woods, the ringing of the Horn returned. I don’t know if Alex heard it, because both of us were too serious about chasing down Emily to mention it. The low bass and high ring permeated the trees around us, as if the woods were singing to us. 

The cries went silent, and Alex and I closed in on the shaky, dim light that was our only sign of where Emily was. 

She had fallen to her knees on some branches, the flashlight shining an eerie spotlight into the darkness. It had fallen beside her, and her fingers dug into the forest floor. 

She was crying, but silently, and without convulsing. Just silent tears down her face, as she stared into the woods with glazed eyes. We could hear her mumbling to herself as we approached.

“He’s not gone, he’s not gone, he’s not gone,” she repeated. “I can hear him singing. He’s calling for me. He’s not gone- he’s singing to me. He’s not gone, he’s not!”

“Emily, we have to get back to the trail,” I said. “He can follow our voices, we shouldn’t get lost trying to find him.”

She shook her head. “That’s not where he is! I know where he is! I just… I need to hear him again.”

I heard the crack of a branch, and looked up just in time to see something move out of Emily’s light into the darkness. I couldn’t make out the shape, only a dark, hairlike blur as it rustled away into the night.

“What the fuck was that?” Alex whispered. He looked terrified, shining his light towards the movement. From his pants Alex procured a full tang knife, which was more of a safety blanket than any real protection. 

The Horn rang out- louder this time, and I doubled over in pain. My spine felt like it was being welded together, and my arm flung itself out like a punch against my will. It felt like a sick puppet master was lacing hooks into my flesh and attempting to pull my body around. When I regained my eyesight and my composure, the bleary chaos I saw was hard to comprehend.

Emily must have lunged for the woods again, but Alex had caught her. I saw her latch onto his torso like a constrictor, and I think she bit him because he cried out in pain. Still, he didn’t release her, and wrestled her down to the forest floor. I stumbled back to my feet and tried to head towards them, to help Alex calm her down, but my body froze as I locked eyes with another observer of their fight. 

A woman, old, with leathery, weathered brown skin stood in the ferns illuminated by Emily’s fallen flashlight. She was naked, with mad black hair that cascaded from her shoulders like a gross bird’s nest. Her black, soulless eyes stared at me, and her cracked lips formed a smile which made my insides writhe in fear.

The Horn was still singing, though the pain had receded slightly. Alex had gotten control of Emily’s limbs and was holding her to the ground, keeping his attention focused on Emily, who continued to thrash and bite at him. 

The woman opened her mouth, and began to sing a warm, harmonious note. It blended with the Horn’s dissonance, finding a middle ground between the low and high extremes of it. It formed a weirdly pleasant chord, but the strength of the woman’s voice made my heart tremble. There was a venomous feeling behind the song, a hidden threat in the composition of the chord.

The singing startled Alex, even more so when Emily joined in, singing the same note as the woman. She slashed at Alex’s face, and his grip loosened. Emily sprung from his grasp like an untethered beast, leaping into the woods singing her song.

Alex turned to look at me, still immobile with fear. He ran at me, wrapping me up in his arms and pulling me back the way we had come. 

“You have to run, Willow!” he screamed at me. My brain finally turned back on, and I clumsily grabbed Emily’s flashlight and followed him.

Behind us, the woman and her song followed. I heard her crash through the underbrush of the forest, an unimpeded hunter chasing after me. Terror filled my heart, and the ringing of the Horn formed a migraine in my head. Every leaping step I took sent reverberations of pain up my bones into my skull. Tears flowed from my cheeks from the pain, but I couldn’t stop. Alex struggled in front of me; the only light we had now was the flashlight in my hands, and he was maybe ten feet in the darkness ahead of me.

Alex’s foot caught on something, and he fell. I helped pull him up, and I took the lead with the light. It felt like we’d been running for hours. I don’t know how long it actually was, but I had the conscious understanding that we should’ve hit the trail again by now. Alex fumbled with something in his pocket- the car keys. He pulled them out, hitting the alarm button as many times in as many directions as he could. Wherever the truck was, the signal didn’t reach.

I felt the woman close in on me, a presence behind my back that I was too terrified to turn and see. Her song went uninterrupted by her run, as if she didn’t need to inhale to keep moving. Just a long, discordant note joining the Horn’s touch in my head.

The Horn was taking control of my legs. I could feel my muscles stiffen, resisting my movement as some alien influence tried to force me to stop. If you’ve ever run with a weight belt, the feeling was similar, except the weight was tied to my thighs and my ankles. Alex was faster than me, but he was matching my speed to stay by my side. Since I’ve known him, he’s always taken care of me, and I suppose this wasn’t any different. 

He shot a glance behind us and urged me forward anxiously. 

I don’t remember any other details of our run. So much of my awareness was focused on not giving in to the Horn that everything else was a blur. If we’d passed the trail in our frenzy, I was certainly not turning around.

In the end, I didn’t get a choice.

Something grabbed the backpack I still had slung around my shoulders and pulled me back with terrifying strength. The woman’s skeletal hand closed around my throat, and I began to black out.

The Horn was overwhelming now, my body convulsing and thrashing around- not against her grip but within it. I had no control over my motor function, and the small part of my mind that had not been closed away watched in terror.

I felt my lungs begin to swell, a breath of air summoned into my chest by my puppetmaster. I began to sing.

Alex plunged his knife into the naked woman’s throat. My weak eyes could barely make out his movements in the dark, but I know he saved my life. The woman’s song was cut short, and her control over my body stopped. Alex was hitting her, beating her face and back to a pulp. He got a good few licks in, until she grabbed his arm and snapped it like a branch. The ease and quickness of this action was horrifying, and I saw that same sickening smile on her face as blood poured from her neck.

I grasped around for any weapon I could find. Emily’s bag had been torn open by the woman’s grasp, and its contents were spilled around me.

My hand landed on a dense plastic rectangle. I grabbed it and scrambled forward towards the wrestling pair. The woman had dug fingers into Alex’s stomach, and he was screaming. I slammed my weapon into the side of the woman’s head with all the weight and force I could put behind it, and two things happened. I felt the woman’s skull crack under what I now realized was our satellite phone, and I heard the blaring alarm from it be triggered by the impact. 

It was one of those sirens designed to blast out miles, for Search and Rescue teams to find you. In close proximity, it was as loud as the Horn, though not as painful. As I pulled back for another strike, I saw the woman grab her ears and shriek in pain. She had hardly reacted to any of our blows, or the knife, but this sound seemed to break her. 

She kicked me in the chest and knocked the wind out of me. I didn’t have time to grab Alex. I just saw his look of terror as she grabbed him and ran back into the woods. Bless him, though, because he did one final thing that saved me before he was pulled into darkness.

With his right arm limp and broken at his side, he reached across his body with his left and pulled the car keys from his pocket.

“GO!” he cried, and he threw them towards me.

And the coward that I am, I did. I know it’s the guilt of that choice that’s driven me to where I am now, chasing ghost stories for closure. If anyone believed me, this would all be easier. But it’s like everyone would prefer to pretend like the woods around Hedge Lake don’t exist. Luke, Emily, and Alex are all considered missing persons, but no searches have been put out, and the police treat me as a suspect.

I don’t remember finding the trail, or our campsite again, or getting into Luke’s truck and driving away. I’ve somehow blacked out hours of driving, because when my memory returns again, I’m hours away on a highway nowhere near Hedge Lake. Of course, I reported them missing, but I still had Alex’s blood on my clothes. The police figured I’d done something to them, and at least Emily’s parents believe that story too. I’m not allowed to leave the state, and all of their investigation seems to be about me having a mental breakdown. I’ve been threatened with an asylum if I don’t “admit what I did”.

I’m tired of their accusations. I’m tired of nobody caring about what happened up there. I need answers. Please, if anyone knows about the Horn, Hedge Lake, or what that thing might have been… it would help me a lot. 

My life now is full of anxiety and repressed memories. If there’s a trial, the best I can hope for is to be called batshit insane. The worst.. I’m found guilty of killing my best friends. I know I didn’t, and I hope that the jury believes at least that. I can’t have the weight of what I didn’t do be added to what I did. 

The woman’s song has stayed with me, terrorizing my daily life. I hear the Horn in everything- cars on the street, the hum of a lamppost, even in the ocean. I’m afraid that one day I will truly hear it again, and the woman will come to finish what she started. 

Would that be so bad, to hear her song and be with my friends again? I’m not sure. I’d rather be dead and with them than locked up and alone. I’d rather be terrified and right than wrong and insane. When all you have is your friends, what do you do when they’re gone?
