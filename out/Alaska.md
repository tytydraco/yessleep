i am human

living in the desolate wilderness of Alaska. I had always embraced the solitude and harsh conditions that came with living in this remote region. It was a frigid morning when I arrived at the isolated mining site nestled deep within the Alaskan mountains. The biting winds and endless stretches of snow were all to familiar to me, but there was a calmness in the air as if the wilderness itself held its breath. I joined a small maintenence crew tasked with maintaining the mining equipment   
Days turned into weeks as we battled against the elements. The work was hard yet fun.  
One evening, as I settled down in my cabin after a particularly taxing day a muffled, distant scream, carried by the wind ran thrugh my ears. I chamberd my pistol knowing id be fired if i used it but id still be alive. as the nights wore on, the haunting sounds grew louder and more persistent. I felt an unshakable sense of being watched as if unseen eyes bore into my very soul. I held my pistol close making sure that if anything non-human that came within 50 yards did't think much longer  
Paranoia gripped me tightly. The other mechanics were not immune to the growing unease either.

I am weak

On that fateful night, I woke to a putrid stench that assaulted my senses. The foul odor lingered in the air, a bastardly mixture of decay and sickening sweetness, oh the sweetness. adrenalin coursed through me as I discovered an odd bulge on my arm. panic washed over me as I witnessed my own flesh warping and distorting into what looked like an eye. In my sleepienes, I stumbled toward the cabin's solitary mirror. My reflection revealed a twisted face, bloated and discolored. My face and arm pulsed with a sickening rhythm as if it had taken on a life of its own. I called medical, asked them to be carfull. They came days later with the CDC, oh what a bad choice. Days turned into weeks, and the body horror that had befallen me worsened. My arm elongated, bending at unnatural angles. Pulsating growths sprouted it, oozing a viscous red substance. As my condition deteriorated, so did my sanity. Hallucinations and delusions soon plagued me. Whispers filled the air, tormenting me both day and night. It felt as if the fabric of reality had been torn apart, exposing me to cosmic horrors beyond comprehension. 

I think therefore I am  
Alone and haunted, I embarked on a desperate quest for answers. The depths of my and its mind revealed ancient secrets and dark forces at play. I delved deeper into the frozen heart of this far-gone monstrosity, my mind teetering on the precipice of insanity. This malevolent entity fed on fear, twisting the very fabric of my being. It sought to consume not just my body but my soul as well. I realized that I was merely a pawn in its sickening game, the survivor who had somehow managed to evade its grasp.  
one arm better than none

I fought, it seemed like days maby months, some days I was lucid, but those were far in between. what I saw when I was asleep was so far from sanity that the depths of hell would be a heavnly resting place. The monstrosity had slowly created a labyrinth with it in the center. The icy labyrinth tested my resolve as I made my way deeper into its frozen depths. The air grew colder, and the walls seemed to pulse with malevolent energy. Whispers echoed around me, urging me to turn back, to surrender to the inevitable. But I pressed on, determined to face my tormentor head-on. Finally, I reached the heart of the cave, a chamber where the ancient creature lay in wait. It was a grotesque amalgamation of tentacles, eyes, and writhing flesh. The sight alone threatened to shatter what remained of my sanity. With a surge of desperation, I unleashed the last remnants of my strength. I fought against the tendrils that ensnared me, slashing and hacking with reckless abandon. Blood and ichor mixed in a macabre dance as I struck blow after blow. The creature thrashed and writhed, its unearthly screams reverberating through the cavern. Its grip weakened, and I seized the opportunity to deliver a final, decisive strike. With a mighty swing, I cleaved through its core, severing the source of its power. As the creature let out a final death rattle, its presence receded, and the cave fell silent once more. I emerged from the darkness, battered and broken, but victorious. The whispers had dissipated. I found my way out of that hell. My face and arm recovered but not for months. I'm working as an auto-mechanic now. I still to this day now hear whispers.
