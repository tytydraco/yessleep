The Carnival

When I woke, the sickly sweet scent of cotton candy was hanging in the air of the tent. I pried my gritty eyes open to the look at the garish patterns above. Highlighter pink, blaze orange and pukey green paisley fabric cut into strips, alternating with vibrant red and sky blue striped fabric. Rather than a typical red-white alternating pattern some other, more normal, tent might have. And the orange had a discomforting feeling of bile to it. The red was maybe a bit too deep to be just dye, maybe even more of a brownish color than a red, almost like dried blood. And the green held perhaps a grey-like pallor and a texture like poorly tanned leather... 
        
It'd been like this for the past three nights. Sometimes it's different. I'd wake and the fabric would have changed. But always colors and patterns were too bright and ugly and clashing to be even vaguely comforting. And always with the vague notion of something wrong, like I needed to look *just a bit* closer to realize that indeed, I did have reason to be horrified.    
Sometimes the tent would be too brightly lit, painfully so, sometimes too dark. Eerie and foreboding. Never comfortable.     
      
And always the cloying cotton candy scent, like fibers of the sticky pink sweetness, were growing in my lungs with every breath. Like some fetid swamp fungus consuming a once proud and tall tree, now fallen low.    Sometimes the faint whiff of wood ash would seep in from the fires outside, always stale like the wood is mildewed and wet, but I'd tested it once. A log as big around as my forearm crumbled in my fists like paper. Dry as desert sand and maggots had fallen from it. Dead and dry and they rattled as they hit the dusty ground. As if even a maggot were too much life in this wretched place and how dare it try to live and grow and one day fly buzzing around a midden heap.    
     
I rolled out of the uncomfortable cot, lumpy with old stuffing and straw that'd gone rank and stale from countless nights of terrified sweat. The cot's frame is too low to the ground and getting up every night is an awkward affair. As though the very first thing that this place needed to do to me each night was have me on my knees, as a supplicant. A reminder of just how much power I had.   
    
As always, the moment my feet hit the soil I was greeted with the snap of the tent's draping fabric door opening.    
   
Tonight the door is black with neon yellow skulls. Unsettling, misshapen skulls. From the corner of the eye it seemed like they were moving, twisting and laughing cruelly. I tried to ignore them, feeling like they wanted my attention and not wanting to give them the satisfaction.   
   
Into the tent stepped Giggles and Tears.   
   
Tears stepped in sideways, too wide to fit through the opening, he was more than twice as wide as the slit in the tent. His costume far too tight. The shirt lifting to expose his pale, greasy looking stomach, free of belly button. No evidence of any sort of mammalian gestation present. His smudged makeup showed a terrible rictus grin as he turned to face the newly awoken man. Looking up to meet his eyes, so short the strange being's pants cuffs always drug behind him, tattered and muddy in spite of the dryness that pervaded this place.   
   
But it wasn't really the makeup that was unsettling, it was his face.    
His face split into an awful, painful looking grin that didn't fall as he spoke. As you looked, you'd realize the make-up was just outlining his actual mouth, stretched into a painful looking curve upwards that turned his cheeks to bunched up knots of muscle perched atop bone. Those lips just stayed pulled back to expose toothless gums as he spoke, giving him a strange sort of lisp.   
    
"1 hour til show time Boss." His wet, thick voice danced with a glee his eyes could never reflect. Because in spite of the grin over his face and in his voice, his eyes were always bloodshot and filled with a pain and sorrow so deep it seemed to have a gravity to it. Like the emotions in his eyes could pull you right in. Forever. Those eyes. They cried out for someone to recognize the sorrow in them, but that grin. That crazy grin always stopped him short of saying something comforting.    
    
Giggles folded themself into the tent as Tears spoke. They were an unnerving duo of opposites, these two clowns.    
Giggles had to almost crawl into the tent like a spider and then stand up. And they seemed to stand up for far far too long. Taking just ...an uncomfortable amount of time to unfold their lanky limbs, even though they weren't moving slowly. Giggles' height seemed to change, always filling the room they were in so that they were almost brushing the ceiling. Always taller than everyone else. And so thin she or he could damn near turn sideways to hide in plain sight. I still wasn't sure of their gender. Because Giggles was so thin it made any distinguishing features wither away. He'd tried calling them both male and female, no reaction or correction. Giggles didn't seem to care. Was skeleton a valid gender? In this place…..   
     
Giggles makeup was overly done sorrow. A matched set to Tears'. But again, it was really just accentuating their visage, because Giggles' face was always drawn tight and pinched in sorrow. Thin lips pursed around too-sharp teeth, clenched against sobs that seemed overwhelming. Forever on the brink of bursting into tears. But the eyes told a different tale.    
Unrivaled mirth overflowed, insane and stuttering out in the rapid flick of those pupils, those inhuman, almost goat-like pupils. Giggles always sent a shiver down my spine. Those eyes belonged to someone that enjoyed skinning animals alive.   
      
It was like someone or something had switched the eyes right out of their heads. Maybe that was exactly what had happened. Maybe I didn't really want to find out.   
Without a word Giggles reached over to where the coat hung. Six feet away. And their arms didn't even come close to the ground. So standing at least seven feet tall right now.   
    
It wasn't actually possible. See, when they left the tent, if Giggles had already gone before him, he could usually touch the ceiling, if he stretched. And he was barely six foot. But there Giggles stood, only slightly hunched to avoid the ugly canvas of the tent.
There were a lot of impossible things here at The Carnival.   
    
"Right... Must make the rounds in the crowds." I agreed absently and stepped towards Giggles, adjusting the wide suspenders into place from where they'd drooped by my sides as I'd slept. Then, giving the horrible creatures my back even though every nerve in me screamed not to. I could feel their delighted eyes glaring into my spine. Perhaps pondering what shade of white my skull would be after they pulled off my skin.   
    
"Boots Tears! My boots!" I demanded suddenly as I rubbed my hands together in a washing motion, in anticipation. I made them drop to my sides as soon as I noticed, on the brink of telling the fat man-creature to forget the damn boots! But I kept silent behind gritted teeth. Hating that I had slipped a little. That I'd played my part, even for just a few seconds.   
   
They settled the jacket over my shoulders, red as blood and heavy as murder. Shabby gold rope trim frayed at every seam. Buttons gleamed dully in the flickering lantern light. Licking my lips, I adjusted the sleeves and cuffs. Wide cuffs, banded in black at the wrists that felt like manacles every single night. I never got used to this jacket, always felt too heavy. Suffocating. And it smelled. Like my favorite meal. A faint whiff of cooking food. And some sort of pleasant plant scent floral or earthy. Some combo of comforting, homey and nostalgic. And that made me distrust the absolute shit out of the coat, more than anything else here.   
     
"The show must go on!" I declared in soft excitement, hands suddenly caressing each other again eager, it was like an involuntary tic that crept up, even as I'd been pondering how much I hated the outfit. I could almost hear the Carnival whisper, 'Must play the part'.    
    
"Yes. It must." Giggles' voice was forlorn and soft and made my heart skip in empathy. I wanted to comfort that voice. In spite of the terror the thin beast festered in him. But those wretched, wretched eyes...   
    
Tears passed over the black top hat. Musty and tattered, gold and red plumes of some long dead bird swayed obscenely with the motion.      
     
He could feel it starting. Now that the jacket was in place. It always started in the center of his gut, like a pressure, swelling. Or like a tide, sweeping him away. He twirled the hat and placed it on his head with a flourish and he could see and feel both clowns relax slightly. It was going to be an easy night. For them.   
"Come!" I intoned in a showman's voice. "Our public needs us!" Then swirled around and strode between them out of the tent, taking a cane in hand. Black, polished wood, with a demon's skull carved into the top. Just the right size to fit into my palm. Dark red gems for eyes. Or clear, or black or green. Tonight they were red. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason. And other nights the skull would be different. A different depiction of the devil. Didn't matter it seemed. So long as it was different enough to breed a suspicious feeling of unfamiliarity. The familiar could have fostered contentment after a fashion, and that just wouldn't do. Not here.   
    
There were already crowds everywhere. There always were. People walking to and fro. Playing games, unwinnable games. Feats of strength. Street shows. Waiting in lines for snacks or to see the freak-show tent.   
But this whole place was a freak-show. In every direction as far as the eye could see. There was The Carnival. Without end.   
    
"Ringmaster." Snake Charmer purred and inclined her head slightly. The many snakes that coiled and curled around her frame tasting the air with their forked tongues. She was pretty, gorgeous even. At first glance. But her eyes were as alien and cold-blooded as the snakes and in the right light, when she spoke, sometimes he thought her tongue was forked as well.    
If you looked past her 'pets' she was littered with bruising where they had maybe clung on just a bit too tightly. And scratches, like maybe she'd been trying to pull them off and couldn't get her nails under them.   
    
She danced away, seductive and at the same time, too nervous to be still. As if by dancing, maybe she could be rid of the serpents.
He grinned, couldn't help it. Literally. It was forced on his face. Music followed her, tambourines and bells and drums just echoed around her. She danced through the crowd. Some shrieking at the sight of her and her pets, others enthralled.    
It was good. Entertaining the crowds. The crowds that never ever saw anything amiss or wrong, that were never creeped out. That never raised hew and cry of protesting terror at the things that went on here. The countless number of unfamiliar people who'd seen death and murder and monsters. They never called for help.   
    
***
"Mommy Daddy look! The Ringmaster!" A child's voice cut through the chilly, moist air.   
   
"Hello little girl!" I enthused to her, bending down. "How are you enjoying my Carnival?"
    
"Gee! I just think it's goddamned great Mister Ringmaster!" She chirped, passersby laughed, Mom and Dad grinned.   
   
I too chuckled, unable to express the slight shock I felt at the far too adult vocabulary from the young girl before me. But grateful that so far, this was all the effect The Carnival was having on her. I pulled a quarter out from behind her ear, giving it to her. A simple magic trick, slight of hand, but I didn't have any quarters. I didn't have any money. And I had never learned such a trick.     Protesting the logic of a thing was useless here. It was just one of the many impossible things that happened at Carnival.   
    
Sometimes the crowds were normal, other times not. You never knew what was going to happen. If they'd act like this was a normal show in spite of what happened, or if they'd also rush forward to partake in whatever madness was to happen. You just never knew.   
  
So I made the rounds. Up and down endless pathways, always pleasant, mysterious  and charming as the situation deemed fit.   
   
All the while, energy grew inside me. Frantic and buzzing. Arcing energy that I almost couldn't contain, like lightning. Every interaction with Carnival staff or customers was like pouring another bit of pressure into an already overburdened system.    
I felt feverish, my head spinning, fit to burst with energy. Like the worst high, I couldn't come down from. A horrible drunken night that never ended.   
   
A brass marching band, the kind that carried the dead to cemeteries in New Orleans swept through the pathway and I was drawn to the head. Cane twirling like a baton and high stepping as behind me a symphony of ghouls and skeletons jazzed along with just enough discordant and creepy notes to leave uneasy sweat soaking through the heavy red jacket.   
     
There had never been a marching band before tonight. The stench of decay almost overpowered the rancid popped corn and pervading linger of smoke from the many burn barrels. But not the sickly aroma of cotton candy. That just layered with the rot so that his stomach roiled.   
    
The band members lurched along around and behind, crowding close to my back. A horde of undead that pawed at me, tugging backwards ever so slightly in-between keeping up their cacophonous beat. My eyes wide in terror, I knew all they wanted was to pull me down and devour me alive. But the Carnival kept them in check, for now. The Carnival wanted me around. And I just wanted to run, as far as my legs would carry me, but instead kept pace with the band. Always in the thick of them.   
    
"Delicious…" one of the creatures groaned, head lolling forward on my shoulder as they shimmed in time, steps in sync as the band's music seamlessly merged into an exaggerated waltz. The creature pressed tightly against my back as we swayed together in a coarse caricature of love making that brought good natured laughs from the crowd around them. But the laughter always had that tinge of desperation. The way it sounded when people got involved in an uncomfortable situation, but the crowds seemed oblivious otherwise.   
   
I could feel a thick, putrid line of drool sliding down my neck and shoulder and l shuddered in revulsion. My Ringmaster smile was frozen in place on my lips, wide and wild.
 "...ssso hungry…" the creature spoke with all the longing of a lover reunited as teeth brushed my skin and a scream ripped out of my throat.  
   
It didn't come out as a scream, it never did when I was in the thick of the crowds. Even such a helpless expression of frustration and terror was denied to to me.   
   
"Ladies and gentlemen! Boy and girls!" My voice burst out as I sprang forward, breaking free from the clutches of the starving dead. Cane twirling like a baton once again. I couldn't get enough air into my lungs, but still my voice boomed out over the sound of the music which had livened back up. As if it weren't my terrified, breathless lungs that gave voice.   
"Step right up, don't be shy! Join the dance as we pass by!    
Delights of which you cannot dream! Amazing sights you've never seen!
Rid yourself of the daily pall! And come with me to Carnival!! ".  
The words roared out of me in a well rehearsed flow but I knew I had never spoken them before, never even had them cross my mind.   
They just flowed from me, like blood from an opened vein.   
    
The raucous stream of people flowed from all directions towards the red and white striped big top, tattered flags fluttering. Lit up from within by countless torches and lanterns, it was a beacon in the darkness of the night that drew the eye. It seemed to pulsate, crouched low at the edge of the horizon. Just tall enough to see over the other haphazardly constructed attractions.   
    
The discordant trill of music continued as they entered the tent, the marching band went round and round the wide center ring. Faster and faster until they were running, and still somehow dancing. My terrified steps a skip and a jump in time with the big bass drum. Each revolution of the ring filled more and more of the bleachers, until there was standing room only and then not even that.   
    
The band music died like a switch had been flicked, the sudden eerie silence roared so loud that his ears rang with a high pitched buzz. A bright white spotlight flicked and flowed over the crowd, which sat still as statues, expressionless, all eyes forward and backs upright. No one fidgeted or shifted.    The light finally swiveled to land on me, bright enough and hot enough to be electric. Though there was no electricity here.    Nothing that familiar and convenient existed here.    
    
"Welcome welcome one and all!" I choked and gasped out, exhausted from running but still drawn to perform against my will. My voice carried easily in the odd and abrupt silence; as around me the undead band moved away in total silence, not a sound from any instrument or any shambling footfall. Quiet as the grave they'd crawled from.    
    
"Oh my friends, my friends what a show we have for you tonight. What. A. Show!" I gestured with the cane broadly and the crowd roared like a chained beast. "Without further ado…"   
     
And the show went on, for hours. Act after increasingly horrible act. Every part of it some shade of horrifying and unsettling. And if the energy that had begun to build at the start of the night had been like lightning coiled in his torso before, now he felt like he was trying to grasp the sun. His mouth was so dry his lips had split and he tasted blood while rivers of sweat poured off of him, soaking the red jacket thoroughly. His voice was hoarse and broken yet the volume never wavered as he tangled the crowd in a spell. Announcements flew from his blood-flecked lips like knives for acts he hadn't even known were coming until he vomited out the words. Emaciated elephants, abused and beaten. A woman sawn in half, no magic tricks here. Both halves of her were still writhing as they wheeled her away. And on and on and on.    
    
Every act made the pressure pulse harder in his chest, filling every cell until he thought for certain the energy must spill forth from his eyes brighter than the vaguely remembered sun. All building towards a terrible and wonderful final release.    
    
"...and so good people the Carnival bids you all...goodnight !" He took a bow and the audience exploded in applause, screaming and whistling. And out from him flowed all the energy raised that night. It was an audible pulse, like a deep boom of thunder.    Like what he imagined the blast of a supernova would be like, all white-hot heat and a rushing flow of wind like someone had suddenly unbottled a tornado. Bits of trash and dust were blown outwards from where he stood but the monstrous staff were the only ones that noticed the suddenly shrieking winds. Some of them fell over, some took a step back to catch themselves, misshapen arms raised to ward off the gales that whipped violently around the tent.
The crowd did nothing to protect themselves, instead they were rooted where they stood. And the crowd's enthusiasm dimmed and they lost their excitement, seeming to age almost. Like some terrible illness was taking its toll on them all at once, before his very eyes. Their skin paled and shoulders slumped as they shuffled forward listlessly, filing towards the exits as the cheery music started up again. "Great show." They said to each other. "One of the best." others agreed softly. Completely drained of emotion, exhausted they meandered away. Leaving. Something I could never do.    
     
If the crowds were exhausted, he was something completely beyond that. He slumped down right where he stood, like a marionette with the strings cut. He could barely make his lungs continue to take in air with all his limbs splayed out at awkward angles.    
     
"Time for breakfast Ringmaster!" Tears' thick wet voice cut through the black spots in my vision and he grabbed me with dough-like hands. Hauling me up and dragging me away, my useless legs flopping along the dusty ground.    
    
The private, behind the scenes life of the Carnival was an entirely different sort of torment.    
    
Even though it had only been a couple minutes since the show ended, the huge crowds were already gone by the time we made it outside.    
"Excellent show as always Ringmaster." Giggles' weepy voice laid heavy on me and my reply was that of someone who'd suffered a massive stroke. Guttural and thick with spittle I couldn't swallow properly. "Of course Ringmaster." The morose monster agreed with the nonsense the bubbled out of me.   
   
I felt devoured, and I knew something of what that felt like. I was hollowed out by all the Carnival took from me at the show's end. An empty husk waiting to be filled. And every night I was. The "breakfast" would revive me, no matter how disgusting it was. And I always ate it. Sometimes by myself, sometimes by force. Sometimes Cook would inject whatever came from the stew pot, straight into my skin, old fashioned metal syringe full just stabbed into whatever part Cook could get a grip on. Sometimes they slid a tube down my throat and funneled it.   
And every time it felt like some few cells of mine, some final bit that was still "me" were taken over. Replaced with some bit of whatever eldritch nightmare made this place.  
    
Cook was the last person … thing ...you'd want making your food. Disease ridden, she looked like she had leprosy. Always armed with a huge wooden spoon that she used to met out punishment in a perverse parody of motherly affection. These were no love taps, she broke bone.    
    
"Are ya goin' to be a good boy ta'day an' eat your porridge?" She demanded in something like a British accent as the clown Tears roughly tossed me to a bench and propped me against the rough wooden table.   
    
My head dangled forward and I drooled on myself as my uncoordinated hands fumbled for the spoon on the table top.   
   
"That's my lil' lad." She crooned and plopped food before me. The rancid stew turned my stomach and I spied a sequin. It was the same color as what the woman who'd been sawn in half had been wearing. But just the scent of it cleared my head and made my limbs easier to control.   
   
"It has been a while since our Ringmaster gave us any real trouble over breakfast." Giggles' sounded somewhat displeased. Tears was silent.   
    
I swallowed around my first bite of the vile stew and cleared my throat raggedly. With a trembling and broken voice, like a child asking if bed-monsters were real I replied
"The show must go on."   
      
((Let me know what y'all think))
