We’ve all received a chain message, I’m sure. The ones that say something along the lines of, “send this to ten people or your worst day starts now”. No one seems to question who they’ve come from. They circulate from phone to phone, computer to computer. I pride myself on my ability to ignore them; I’ve lived a lot of life, received plenty of these messages, and, of course, I’ve experienced none of the horrors they promised. Despite the tragedies of my life, none of them can be attributed to a chain message. The people who write them are simply sick, twisted individuals who thrive on fear. I was devastated to discover that my daughter, Katherine, was one of the culprits. I’m not sure what to do now that it’s gotten so out of hand. 

A month or so ago, I received a phone call from Cindy Heller, our neighbor. She claimed that her daughter, Emily, had gotten a strange message that urged her to pass it along or there would be consequences. Emily had disclosed that the message came directly from my daughter, and that she had never seen anything like it. I asked what the message said, and Cindy explained that she felt uncomfortable sharing the contents, but that it was unsettling and concerning. I apologized to her, told her that I would speak to Katherine about it, and hung up. 

Whether Katherine wrote it herself or simply passed it on from another source was far from the issue. She had frightened a neighbor. Cindy is a lovely woman, and I think of her fondly. I hold her to a standard of intelligence that would be too high to believe a chain message or the threats within, but I could never expect that of Emily. 

I told my daughter that messages like that were harmful. They could do irreparable damage to an already anxious soul, which I presumed Emily was. Katherine didn’t respond. After a moment, I asked her if she had written the message herself. She shook her head. Guilty silence, I suppose. But, like I mentioned, this was a month ago. Even with a good scolding, she didn’t stop. 

She sent her next “message of terror” to a group chat. Multiple neighbors, including the already paranoid Emily. I received a plethora of exasperated messages from exasperated parents, and spent the evening consoling them… not an easy feat. Cindy pried a tad bit more than the others, though. She refused to share the contents of Katherine’s messages, but threatened to call the police if the “insanity”, as she called it, continued. A far reach, but I hadn’t seen the messages myself. Maybe they were that frightening. 

To explain my parental stances more clearly, I never bought my daughter a phone. I don’t trust her to make good choices online, and thirteen is simply too young to be exposed to the wide web. I did, however, give her my computer from ages ago. The computer is terribly old, and our WiFi is low-tier, so the connection is too poor to make calls on its software. How Katherine managed to download some sort of message-sharing application is beyond me, but no one will disclose what software she is using. Cindy, above most other parents, has expressed concern for Katherine’s social life. The world of technology is moving quickly, and Cindy feels that Katherine should be able to keep up. This is where our views on parenting differ, clearly. 

What the parents did share with me, however, was that Katherine’s messages urged the recipients to continue the chain; Katherine was encouraging the neighborhood kids to spread along her dark mystery sentiments. I was ashamed and confused, and promptly told Katherine to delete her messaging software — and cease her reign of terror — or there would be consequences. 

She’s a good girl, generally well behaved, troubled in only minor aspects. I’ve chalked up the behavior to some sort of coping mechanism. Her mother, Eveline, passed a few years ago, and I’ve done what I can to parent alone, but I see my shortcomings in Katherine as she grows up. Budding teenagers are hard to manage, especially those in perpetual mourning. 

The third message, from this morning, only came to my attention when a service agent arrived at my house. He informed me that a “concerned parent” (Cindy, no doubt) had reported a series of unnerving messages from a child in my home. I told him that I, too, was concerned about my daughter’s new habit, but that chain messages were far from grounds to interrogate a person’s family. Additionally, I asked him what the messages said. He wouldn’t tell. All he said was that he wished to speak with my daughter. Protocol, he said. I was astounded, and told him so. We had a sort of back-and-forth, and, by some grace of God or charm, I managed to calm his worries. I promised to speak to my daughter, and he relented. A reasonable person will always understand a reasonable perspective. 

An hour or so after the ordeal with the service agent, I decided to speak with my daughter. A last plea for reason. I told her that an officer had shown up, and that her antics had gone too far. She must have recognized the severity, because her eyes widened. Her face went white. I told her not to worry, the agent was long gone. That being said, I’d promised a consequence, and that was a promise I’d hold up. I unplugged her computer, hitched it under my arm, and left her silent and defeated in her room. No apology, no admission of wrongdoing. She was silent. 

I set up the computer at the kitchen table and began to scramble for a password. It was a four digit code with endless potential combinations. While I pondered the answer, I phoned Cindy. She was curt, clearly distressed by what my daughter had put Emily through. I asked her again to divulge the contents of Katherine’s chain messages, what it was that had everyone so out of sorts, but she reiterated that she was not comfortable repeating them. All she said was that the messages were circulating, and more and more children were growing concerned. “The talk of the neighborhood”, she called it. In frustration, I hung up, and resumed my mental search for Katherine’s password. 

Then I tried Eveline’s birthday. The computer unlocked. Poor Katherine. So caught up over her mother that she made her birthday a permanent marker. 

I poured over the computer’s contents, scrolling over a few standard digital games that I had downloaded to keep Katherine entertained. Then I spotted an icon with a speech bubble. I clicked it and watched the colorful loading wheel spin. The damned thing really was old. 

When the application opened, I saw a series of conversations, all sent this morning, and all starting with the same few words. “Send this to as many people as you can…” and so on. I scrolled down through the contacts before clicking the one labeled “Emily”.

Now I am staring at the message, reading it over and over, a deep hole in my stomach. That’s where I am at the moment. I feel as though time has stopped. I should have known. I’ll insert the message below, given that I won’t have much time before the service agent is reported missing. 

From Katherine, to Emily: 
“Send this to as many people as you can, or bad things will happen to me. The man downstairs took my mother. There isn’t much time. Share this or the man might get you, too.”

I see now why Katherine’s messages had everyone so undone. I think a more severe consequence is in order. There is still time to teach her a lesson, but, perhaps, I’m wrong for being so hard on her. I’m a good father. The police, the neighborhood, they will understand. She’s caused them too much pain, too much fear. The chain will end.
