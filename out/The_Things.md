Sixteen-year-old Jessica zipped up her jacket and gave herself a final once-over in the hallway mirror before heading out; her dark hair was soft and shiny as silk, and her shimmery gold eyeshadow perfectly complemented her rich brown eyes. The peach lip gloss she had purchased at the mall the previous weekend left her lips with a soft sheen. With a confident smile, she knew she was ready for whatever the night had in store.

The door closed quietly behind her as she slipped out into the night. The air was thick with the scent of pine and mystery, the mixture of dried leaves and gravel crunching softly beneath her shoes as she walked to the end of the driveway to wait for her ride.

With no explanation given, her parents ordered her to stay home tonight as they prepared to leave for their dinner date. The party out at Serpent River Bridge was too tempting to pass up. The night held endless possibilities. Colorful leaves swirled at her feet as thoughts raced through her mind. Dan would be there; he sat two desks away from her in math class, and sometimes, she'd catch him looking at her from the corner of her eye. He was quite, possibly the best-looking guy in the entire school, and tonight, she would summon up the courage to approach him. The bridge was located near Elderwood Park. Tonight it would be deserted except for the small crowd of partygoers, and the darkness provided the perfect backdrop for uninterrupted party bliss.

\---

It was a moonless night, but the stars remained visible. This rural stretch of country road was quiet and peaceful, broken only by the occasional distant barking of dogs. For the first few minutes, things were calm. Nothing stirred, not even the trees—one of the few perks Jessica enjoyed about living in a rural area. But in that moment, she felt a sudden sense of unease, a feeling of being watched.

And then, out of nowhere, it began. Click. Click. Click. Click. The sound was rhythmic, like the ticking of a clock. It was coming from out of the darkness on the road. Julie's heart leaped as she stared into the darkness, her eyes straining to find the source of the sound.  

A dark shape moved through the shadows, pacing back and forth, back and forth across the deserted stretch of road. Two beige paws provided the only clue that it was an animal—a canine. Click. Click. The creature continued its restless pacing, and the tension in the air was palpable as if it were anxiously waiting for something to happen. As Jessica's eyes adjusted further to the darkness, she could see more clearly and, to her horror, realized that there were not just one but two large beings walking upright on their hind legs.. Their vague, shadowy silhouettes loomed against the wall of night. She gasped and quickly covered her mouth, stifling the instinct to scream. She shivered as fear and realization gripped her like icy fingers. The things weren't human or animal. Slowly, she slid her hand into her coat pocket for her phone but realized it wasn't there; she remembered she'd forgotten it back in the house.

Right at that moment, her phone lit up on the kitchen table with a notification:

**Mimi:** hey, I can't make it tonight. I got a flat. Sawrry! :("

Jessica's legs felt as if they might give way at any moment. She needed to get back to the house without being spotted. Slowly, carefully, She took one shaky step back, then another and another, careful not to draw attention. Just a few more steps, and she'd be home free.

The sound of an approaching vehicle, its engine roaring, made her stop in her tracks. Perhaps it was morbid curiosity, but she just had to see once and for all what the things were. As the headlights neared, she saw something extraordinary: the two things seemed to dissolve in the oncoming lights. Stumbling back in disbelief, Julie realized they had just vanished into thin air.

Panicked, she rushed up the wooden porch steps and stopped abruptly at the top. The front door was partially ajar, and no light was on. Puzzled, she recalled leaving a lamp on and locking the door behind her—hadn't she? With a deep breath, Jessica pushed the door open, her palms sweaty with perspiration, and peered inside.

The house was eerily quiet. The familiar scent of her mother's potpourri blend clung to the air. But, it did little to comfort her. She slipped inside and slowly closed the door behind him, wincing at the creak of door hinges.

"Someone here?" she called out, but her voice was cracking and raspy, and only silence answered. The absence of voices amplified every scrape and shuffle of her movements, and she felt the weight of the night pressing in on her.

Instinct told her to grab the nearest lamp and flood every room with light, but she didn't want to alert the would-be perpetrator to her exact location.

A rustling sound came from upstairs, and Jessica jumped with a start. That hadn't sounded like the house settling. Her gaze landed on the table, searching for her phone, but it was nowhere in sight. She grabbed a large kitchen knife and a small emergency flashlight from the closet, her thumb clicking on the flashlight switch, using it to guide her; the small light cut through the darkness as she inched her way up the stairs, her light scanning every shadowy corner. She wasn't sure what to look for, but she was almost sure it was probably something altogether bad.

The clicking sounds from the road replayed in her mind, a reminder that something unnatural had been lurking outside moments earlier and could now be hiding in the house.

Suddenly, she heard the creaking of a door opening upstairs, followed by a low, guttural growl. A wave of fear swept through her, and every instinct urged her to turn and run! But the rational part of her mind wanted to believe it was just a coyote that wandered in from outside. The woods surrounding their community were full of them. The door had been left unlocked. Either way, she had to know.

Steeling herself, Jessica noiselessly made her way up the steps; she knew every inch of these stairs like the back of her hand.

She felt for the light switch at the top of the stairs, flicking it on and off with her thumb, but no lights poured down from the ceiling lamps. Meandering her way down the dark corridor of bedroom doors, she held her flashlight in one hand and trembling blade in the other, ready to slash out at anything that moved.

Just as she got halfway to her parent's room at the end of the hall, one of the floorboards groaned underneath the Navajo design rug. A bedroom door flew open behind her, and an arm was pressed against the front of her body like a steel bar. In the randomness of the moment she had dropped her flashlight-only weapon, they fell with dull thuds against the carpeted floor.

A dark shape burst from the gloom of her parents' room. It was massive and feral, with glowing yellow eyes.

Werewolf.

A scream welled up in Jessica's throat, but it lodged there, unable to escape. Her captor held her in a merciless grip, a knife with a wicked edge aimed at the monstrous creature before them. Slowly, they inched backward, Jessica a helpless human shield as they retreated toward the stairs.

The werewolf advanced, its eyes glowing with a yellow predatory light. Jessica's hand scrabbled wildly over the wall, her fingers gripping the door; she clutched it with desperate strength. A sudden, guttural snarl erupted from the stairs behind them, catching her attacker off guard. His grip faltered, loosening just enough for her to wrench free and stumble into the safety of a nearby room, slamming the door shut behind her behind her.

There was a loud scuffle outside the door, followed by a hard thud of something heavy hitting the floor, and an unnerving moment of silence lingered.

Jessica's eyes scanned frantically, her mind racing. This was one of the guest rooms. A glint of silver from the bedside drawer drew her attention. She knew from legends that werewolves couldn't stand silver.

She was across the room in a flash, yanking the drawer open. A silver letter opened and sat atop the jumble of paperwork and pens. With a surge of relief, Jessica grabbed the weapon—

A growl came from the doorway.

Whirling, she found the door opened, eyes narrowed at her. Feral snarls curled their lips. Two large werewolves entered the room and closed in around her like a trapped animal. She scrambled onto the bed, holding the letter opener out at point range.

She braced herself, her hand trembling. Okay. She could do this. They eyed her with instinctual curiosity for a heartbeat, their heads tilting in bewilderment. Frozen in place, her anxiety grew. Then, without warning, the lights flickered on, casting erratic shadows across the walls.

"Jessica". At that moment, the two figures standing before her were no longer the creatures from outside. Jess immediately recognized her mother's voice, though it sounded deeper like she had a bad cold. "Mom? Is that you?" she asked, her voice uncertain.

As the figures stepped closer, the familiar sight of her father melted the icy fear within her. Yet, there was something different about his expression—something fractured and off-balance about them both.

"Why didn't you stay home?" her mother asked, her voice brimming with concern. "You weren't supposed to be out this late." The door behind Jess creaked open again, the fear that had nearly vanished creeping back into her chest as she turned to see what lay beyond.

It was the man who held her at knifepoint. Their neighbor, Stan, stood in the doorway, and he appeared alive and unscathed.

"What's going on? What *are* you guys? She asked, bewildered, the letter opener lowered to her lap.

Standing at the foot of the bed, her parents gazed at her, with a mixture of sympathy and admiration. Her mother came around to sit at the end of the bed, facing her. "We're sorry, sweety, we know tonight must have been a harrowing experience for you, but this was a test we had to make sure you were prepared. We had to know."

"And guess what? You passed honey, with flying colours!" While her dad was grinning, a tooth jutted out slightly over his bottom lip. Jessica's expression dropped slightly at the unsightly display.

"Oh, oops." Her dad raised his thumb and push the tooth back in, looking slightly embarrased.  

She gasped in exasperation, her thoughts racing, trying to piece things together. "Wait, let me get this straight, so the world is full of werewolves?"

All three nodded in unison. "Then that was you guys outside on the road?" Again, they nodded in agreement.

"Uh, except for me," Stan said, "I was already waiting in the house." He raised his blade in the air, then instantly lowered it, feeling regretful. "Sorry."

"Now it all makes sense," she dropped the letter opener and relaxed her posture on the bed, "that's why you guys are never home during a full moon." She reflected on all the times growing up when her parents would disappear for an entire night, at least once a month, leaving her in the care of her aunt. It was always when the moon was at its fullest.

"We come from a long line of werewolves, Jessica," her dad replied. "It's passed down from generation to generation."

But not everyone can become one of us, her mom intercepted.

Stan cleared his throat and stepped into the room, placing his blade on the dresser. "To become a werewolf, a person has to prove their worthiness by demonstrating courage."

"We're so proud of you, dear." Her mom's eyes were on the verge of tears as she came to lovingly rest a hand on her shoulder.

Jessica's heart dropped, realizing some nights held more than just adventure; they held secrets. And the party at Serpent River Bridge started to feel very far away as shadows danced at the edge of the world she once knew.
