“*Be safe,* niño. California is a dangerous place.”

I met her fierce gaze. A stern sincerity was written across her countenance.

“Abuelita, I’ll be fine. It’s only about a four-hour drive from Reno. I’ll be okay.”

“Promise me you’ll be cautious, Juan. My heart couldn’t bear it if something were to happen to you,” she said as tears brimmed in her eyes.

“I promise. Dame un beso. Andrew está aquí.”

She kissed me on the cheek and wrapped her arms around me.

“Te amo, mi nieto.”

“Yo también te quiero.”

She released me, and I hoisted my bag onto my back.

“Let me get one of those. That’s too much for you to carry.”

“I’m fine, Grandma, really,” I said as I struggled out to Andrew’s awaiting Tahoe.

“Alright. Have fun!”

“I will. See you in a few days.”

I hopped into the passenger seat. Andrew greeted me with a fist bump.

“Sup, dude. You ready for this? San Jose, let’s go!”

“Yeah, man. I’m stoked.”

I stared longingly at my grandmother waving from the porch as we pulled away. I returned the gesture and smiled.

“What’s wrong, bro? Miss your Grammy already?”

“Just shut up and focus on the road.”

After around four hours of traffic and non-stop chatter from Andrew, we arrived at our destination. A grin inched its way across my face as the luxurious beachfront hotel came into view. The pictures didn’t do it justice. We rolled to a stop in the parking lot as I scanned our surroundings.

“When are the girls supposed to get here?”

“Right about now,” Andrew smirked, pointing to a white SUV, trying to find an empty space.

“Nice.”

“Yeah, dude, I think Julia has a crush on you,” he teased, shaking my shoulder.

Color blossomed into my face.

“Yeah right, man. A girl like her? She’s *way* out of my league.”

“Don’t count yourself out like that. You’d be surprised.”

“Who’s ready to partay?!” a petite blonde girl yelled as she leapt down from the SUV.

“Hell yeah, I am!” Andrew screamed as she jumped into his arms.

“I missed you, babe.”

“I missed you too, honeybun.”

They gazed endearingly into each other's eyes.

“Gross. Get a room, ya floozies,” I interjected.

“Floozies are girls, dipshit,” Andrew retorted sharply.

“I know what I said.”

He scowled at me as Julia tentatively shuffled up to us. Her long brown hair fluttered in the breeze, and the evening light kissed her golden skin in just the right way. Her ocean blue eyes shimmered like a twinkling star. She caught me gaping at her. I quickly averted my gaze.

“How about we drop our stuff off after check in and we go exploring a bit?” Andrew suggested.

The girls nodded feverishly.

“Awesome. I’ll head to the front desk. Juan, can you help Stacey and Julia with their stuff?”

“On it.”

After lugging the girls’ wildly over packed suitcases to the room and returning for our own, we set off on our adventure. We visited shops and a local Mexican restaurant before we found ourselves striding along the coast, guided by the beams from our flashlights as the waves licked at our bare feet.

“This is so peaceful. I think I really needed this,” I admitted, breathing in the cool night air.

“Me too, man. Me too,” Andrew said, arm wrapped around Stacey’s waist.

“This is nice. Thanks for inviting me, you guys,” Julia remarked.

“Take my dream vacation without my best friend? Not in a million years,” Stacey said, smiling softly at Julia.

We continued walking, and after a while, the fancy resorts and beachfront hotels were just specks on the moonlit horizon. The sand gradually grew coarser. I stubbed my toe more than once on a protruding rock.

“We’ve gone pretty far. I think it might be time to head back. We’ve got a long walk ahead of us,” Andrew sighed.

“I think you’re right, dude. My feet are going to be *killing* me by the time we get to the hotel.”

Truth be told, I was ready to turn around much before that, but I could tell the others had wanted to push onward.

“‘Wait, what’s that?” Stay asked curiously as her torchlight fell upon what appeared to be the mouth of a cave.

“Creepy as shit. That’s what it is,” I retorted.

Julia giggled, much to my delight.

“Come on, Juan. Where’s your sense of adventure? Let’s go explore it!” Stacey hollered as she tore in the direction of the cavernous pit.

I glanced at Andrew. He shrugged and began to chase after her.

“Hey, babe, wait up!”

Left with no other option, Julia and I followed suit. We joined Stacey and Andrew at the entrance. They stared at it in wonder.

“This is so cool,” Stacey muttered.

“Yeah, agreed,” Andrew said.

We began our trek into the unknown. Light illuminated the cavern, and we trudged forward, gawking at every tiny stalactite glimmering above our heads.

“Hey, guys, where’s Andrew?”

“Stace, I thought he was with you,” I said, panic crashing over me like a tidal wave.

“Boo!”

Andrew leapt from behind a massive stalagmite, nearly causing me to jump out of my skin. Julia screamed and threw herself into my arms. I gladly cradled her quivering frame.

“Andrew, you fucking dick! You scared the shit out of me, man.”

He was doubled over in stitches.

“You two should’ve seen yourselves!” he wheezed, struggling to regain his composure.

“Asshole,” Julia mumbled.

“Maybe I should, um, hold your hand. You know, just to make sure you’re safe,” I told Julia.

She slipped her hand into mine, interlacing our fingers.

“Yeah, just to be safe.”

Once Andrew recovered from his laughing fit, we continued on our escapade. The temperature dipped the deeper we went. We rounded a corner, and I froze, tugging Julia’s hand. The beam of my flashlight revealed faded yet still clearly visible cave paintings. Though some of them were difficult to discern, it soon became evident that they told a story.

“Hey, you guys, come look at this,” I implored the others.

They eagerly joined me as I gently ran my fingers over the first portrait. It depicted a group of stick men pointing and throwing objects in what appeared to be disgust at a lone figure. The next illustrated a great journey, with the man traveling through mountains, forests, and plains, ultimately settling in a cave. The third painting was smudged beyond recognition, but a name was distinctly etched underneath. Malsumis. My heart sank as I realized that I would probably never uncover its meaning.

“What do you think it means? And who is Malsumis?” Julia asked, shattering our silent reverie.

“I think it shows someone being exiled from his tribe. And maybe Malsumis is his name,” I suggested.

“Whatever it is, I don’t want to know. This place is starting to give me the creeps,” Stacey said as a chill tremored her body.

She was right. A deep dread began bubbling in my gut. I suddenly didn’t feel safe anymore.

“Yeah, me too. Let’s get out of here,” Andrew insisted.

We all agreed. We followed the same path we entered through, and eventually found the entrance. I released a sigh of relief upon our exit. I loosened my grasp on Julia’s hand, which I hadn’t realized I’d been squeezing like a nearly empty ketchup bottle.

We made the arduous trip back to the hotel. Once we’d returned to our temporary sanctum, I collapsed onto the bed. Julia flopped down beside me, exhausted. We watched subpar reality TV for a while, Stacey and Andrew claiming the bed beside us, before Stacey spoke. I briefly caught Julia winking at her out of the corner of my eye.

“So, Andrew and I are going to hang out in the lobby for a little bit.”

“We are?”

She jabbed him in the ribs.

“Ouch, I mean, yeah we’ll see you guys in a bit,” he grumbled as his girlfriend dragged him out of the room.

I watched Stacey hurriedly leave, Andrew in tow.

“You didn’t have to poke me so hard,” Andrew hissed as the door creaked closed.

I turned to Julia. Her shirt and shorts lay discarded on the floor. I reflexively bit my lower lip, a big goofy smile plastering itself across my face.

She cooed in a bashful yet seductive timbre, “So, I heard you have a bit of a crush on me.”

Julia and I made passionate love in that hotel room. I won’t get into the messy details, but by the time we were through, both of us lay panting beside one another on the bed. By the time Andrew and Stacey returned, Julia was snoozing, peacefully cuddled in my arms.

“Looks like you two had a good time,” Andrew smirked.

“You got that right,” I whispered, careful not to wake the girl in my amorous embrace.

“Juan. Juan, wake up!”

Julia fervently shook my arm, tearing me from my slumber. I groggily rubbed my eyes and glanced at the alarm clock on the bedside table. 2:03 A.M.

“Hey, hey, calm down. What’s wrong?”

“Juan, it’s Stacey and Andrew. They’re gone.”
