When I was a child, I had an imaginary friend named Tommy. He was always with me, playing in the backyard, going on adventures, and keeping me company when I was alone. I never questioned his existence, and my parents never seemed to think it was strange. But as I got older, I started to forget about Tommy and eventually, I stopped talking to him altogether.

It wasn’t until I was in my twenties that I started to remember Tommy again. I was going through a rough time and I felt like something was missing in my life. I started to have vivid dreams about him and I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was trying to tell me something.

That’s when I started to do some digging. I talked to my parents and they told me that they had never heard of Tommy. I asked my childhood friends and they looked at me like I was crazy. I even went to a therapist, but she couldn’t provide any answers.

Eventually, I stumbled upon an old police report from my hometown. The report described a string of murders that had occurred around the time I was a child. The victims were all young boys, and they had all been killed in the same way: strangled and left in the woods. And then I saw a picture of his face, he was the vivid image of Tommy. Later on I found out that he committed suicide after he was put under arrest.

I couldn’t believe it. My imaginary friend, the one who had been by my side for so many years, was a killer. I couldn’t understand how this could be possible.

At first, I tried to ignore the feeling that Tommy was with me, that he was going to kill me like with those children. But as time passed, I started to see him everywhere. In the shadows, in my dreams, in my own reflection. I started to have visions of the murders he had committed, the boys he had killed. I could see him in my mind, strangling them, their eyes wide with terror.

I began to feel like I was losing my mind. I couldn’t tell the difference between what was real and what wasn’t. Was I seeing things or was Tommy really there? I couldn’t be sure.

And then, one night, he came to me. In my dream, I saw him standing in front of me, with that twisted smile on his face. He told me that he had never left, that he was always with me, he was willing to possess me and end his job. I was his unfinished job.

I woke up screaming, my heart pounding in my chest. I knew then that I had to get out, to run as far away as I could. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was still with me, that he was still watching, still waiting.

I still have nightmares about Tommy and the crimes he committed. But what’s even more terrifying is that I know deep down that my memories that I have of him, of our friendship, aren’t real. And now, I fear that he is not just a figment of my imagination, but a dangerous entity that has latched onto my mind and won’t let go.

I have tried to reach out to people, to tell them what’s happening to me, but they think I’m crazy. They can’t see or feel what I feel. I’m alone in this, and it’s driving me to the brink of insanity.

I can feel myself slipping away, becoming more and more like Tommy. I can feel his thoughts and desires infiltrating my own. I can’t tell if what I’m thinking, or feeling is mine or his. It’s like I’m losing myself to him.

I have to find a way to stop him, to get him out of my mind before it’s too late. But how do you fight something that’s only in your head? I am desperate for help, for anyone to believe me, to stop this. I am posting this in the hope that someone can reach out to me, to guide me out of this nightmare before it’s too late. I fear for my life and for my sanity, I fear that soon, there will be no difference between me and Tommy, and he will be the one in control.
