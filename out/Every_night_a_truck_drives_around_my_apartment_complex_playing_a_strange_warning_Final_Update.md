Sick.

That's how I felt watching the truck crawl across the parking lot of the motel.

I wanted to vomit, scream. And then the anger. A million needles pricking my skin, white flames licking at the corners of my vision as the intruder stomped through my solace.

Lex stayed asleep, breathing softly under the ringing in my ears. I didn't care anymore, I was done.

Shooting out of bed, I grabbed the car keys out of a wooden bowl perched atop a door-side table. It was your basic motel, our second story room just another in a row of doors alongside an elevated walkway. 

Without thinking, caring, I flung the door open and dashed out onto the walkway, down wooden stairs. I was parked a few yards away, across a wide stretch of asphalt.

I made it halfway before I felt it.

A mild heat erupted across the top of my head, spreading rapidly until my whole body was ablaze. My arteries were volcanoes, pumping thick molten rock through my veins. 

Bright light flooded my vision, engulfed my body, it's source so indistinct I could've been glowing. My body went tense, the magma instantly cooling to stone. My head snapped back, a blanket of twinkling pinpricks swallowing my sight.

It's magnificence overwhelmed my body which fell to its knees in pure religious ecstasy. It would show me, it would make me understand that which could not be understood. 

My shepherd. 

My glorious god.

Lead us from our pastures which enclose our souls! 

A trillion fingers wriggled around my flesh, felt their way into my nostrils, my throat, my eyes. Burrowed deep into my being like starving worms.

I didn't hear the car door open behind me, didn't feel the hands which grabbed my body. 

I wasn't *there*.

And then the door to the white F-150 slammed shut and I was me, here, there. Laying across a dreadfully fuzzy backseat as the Shadow of a man calmly climbed into the driver's seat.

I was hyperventilating, I know that. I couldn't hear or see properly I don't think, but it's hard to describe. My stomach was doing flips, it's acid was boiling, my internal organs felt bruised, violated.

Through blurry eyes I watched him buckle his seatbelt, check the rearview, throw it in drive, and pull out of the motel into sparse traffic.

Finally, all at once, I processed my surroundings, my self, and the truck driver is spent the last month obsessing over. I sat up slowly.

"What the FUCK is going on!?' I screamed. My voice came out gurgly, wrong. 

"That's a bad word" the man responded, and made a clicking sound. "That's bad" He clicked again, his head twitching silently with each one. "We use good words" Another click. He sounded as though I had insulted him, sad.

I swallowed a ball of anger that lodged itself in my throat. 

"I'm sorry" I grumbled "please tell me what is going on. I mean, what happened to me? Who are you? Why are you here?"

He hesitated, twitching silently behind the wheel as he turned down an intersecting road, perhaps trying to figure out which question to answer first. 

"I- You were at location 147." He twitched, glanced back at me. "That's its third stop now. You're its third stop now" He smiled, huge. "I know where it stops! I follow its path! It's not good but I'm good. I'm Uriel!" 

We stopped at a red light and he turned around to face me. 

His smile was genuine, endearing. 

"It learns as it teaches" he said strongly, As if that would make everything add up. The light turned green. "I just stop it from teaching". He turned back around, took off from the light smoothly.

"Where are you taking me?" I asked, calming down to match his energy.

He laughed. "It taught you!" He said, as if this was an obvious thing. "Or it started to. Either way you need to forget."

"I don't know what that means" I retorted, trying my best not to get annoyed.

He sighed deeply. "The seed is planted. We have to stop it from growing." 

My blood ran cold. Everything felt ethereal, dreamlike. I kept expecting to wake up.

I tried to call lex three times as "Uriel" wove through traffic, down side roads and past bars still writhing with patrons, though all calls went unanswered. She was a hard sleeper, so I just left her a text saying to call when she woke up. 

Maybe it was for the best I didn't talk to her, what even was there to say? Nothing made sense yet.

We eventually pulled into a downtrodden trailer park, it's gravel roads and driveways rife with weeds which swayed in the gentle night's breeze, dancing under the yellow light from the sporadically placed street lamps. 

We drove past dozens of mobile homes, each one a near exact replica of the last, until finally we pulled into the only unique one around.

A handful of satellite dishes and antennae protruded from the trailers flat roof, a river of cables cascading down the side disappearing into an open window.

The trailer itself had been painted a matte jet black, seperating itself from the whites and browns of every other one. Uriel, as if reading my mind, said:

"EMF paint." *click* "keeps the signals out" *twitch* "it messes with technology, breaks things."

He opened the driver door and stepped out, motioning for me to follow. I obliged. Up a short staircase we went, the porch piled high with boxes and trash bags. I tried to wait patiently as he unlocked the door, suddenly feeling very exposed outside.

I followed him inside and immediately wanted to leave. It was a hoarders paradise; various tubs and boxes lined the wall across from the entrance, a recliner off to the side piled high with dirty clothes and blankets. The floor had a layer of trash and mouse droppings draped across it like a blanket.

A doorway to the left led to an equally cluttered kitchen, the stove and countertops invisible beneath an avalanche if dishes and take-out containers. To the right was a moderately clean bedroom/office which he quickly walked over to.

The entire far wall was a desk, seemingly two large 'L' desks in each corner with a regular one connecting the them. At least a dozen monitors ranging in age covered every inch, each with their own keyboard and mouse. 

I counted eight computers in total, some with two monitors, some with one. Each screen displayed a different reading; graphs, maps, live satellite feeds, scrolling numbers straight out of the matrix. This was utter insanity. 

Uriel walked over to a monitor on the left and waved me over, clicking. He was looking at a map, a satellite feed, and pointed specifically to a spot in the middle. 

"Motel" he said simply, and nodded to himself. He then reached over and taped another nearby screen. This one was full of numbers: 0's, 1's, and 2's covered the screen. He once again pointed to the screens middle where I immediately noticed a difference. Seemingly random letters formed a small circle in the center of the sea of numbers. 

"Shepherd" He said and clicked.

I watched in awe as the circle slowly moved downwards, each number below ticking into a letter as it slid. Turning back to the satellite, the screen appeared unchanged, still.

Uriel laughed. 

"I can see youuuu" he said, waving at the letters.

"-and so you just follow the anomaly every night?" I asked, taking a bite of spaghetti-o's from the can. Uriel nodded excitedly. 

Shortly after arriving, an intense hunger had taken over, unrelenting. Uriel seemed unconcerned and simply took me to his kitchen where he opened a cabinet to reveal: spaghetti-o's. Just spaghetti-o's. At least a hundred cans lined each shelf of the cupboard, and I didn't dare look in the other ones.

I accepted graciously and wolfed down a can before throwing another on the stove. I had taken the opportunity while eating to ask Uriel more questions.

For instance, the name Uriel; that was the angel of knowledge and wisdom, and since he had knowledge that no one else had, he adopted the moniker himself.

"How'd you figure out the anomaly was bad, was "teaching" people things?" I asked cautiously after  another bite.

"When I found it," he started, twitching slightly, "I saw it had a pattern. Stayed still for a long time before moving." *click* "so I just went to where the computer said it was." *twitch*

"But there's nothing there? Whatever it is, it's invisible." I quickly responded, confused.

"The body wasn't." *click*

"Abandoned construction site. It was at the bottom. Had a note on him." *click*

"Jesus"

"So I followed it, found more bodies over time. Pattern." *twitch* "Had to warn people."

I shook my head. I felt insane. Stuff like this didn't happen, wasn't real. On top of everything, I still had no explanation for my apartment complex, the fake tenets, the manager, the owner. 

Uriel continued, "Most places are empty, low-traffic." *click* "but I play the warning anyways. My job now." *twitch*

"Your apartment was different." *click* "The 147th location. Abandoned. Empty." *twitch* Then one day BOOM!" He clapped his hands. "Tons of cars, looks like everybody lives there." *click* He leaned in close to me. "But I watch while I play the warning." *twitch* "No one lives there."

I waited, knowing what he would say next.

"Like they wanted to make it look normal, fine, get actual people to move in." *twitch* "Like they want it to teach people." *click* "Like they want to see what happens when it teaches people. But not too many people. Testing?" *twitch* "I don't know." *click*

But who? It wasn't the owner or his son at the helm, if all of this is true then they were victims as well. Seeing that I was deep in thought, Uriel offered a theory:

"I think someone," *click* an investor or something *twitch* told the complex's owner a plan to get tenets again and he accepted, didn't know the true offer."

I shook my head. Couldn't believe I was discussing real life conspiracy theories in an EMF-shielded trailer at 2am on a Thursday. 

Someone wanted to analyze the anomaly and how it affected people, that much was certain. 

Uriel suddenly stood up.

"You need to forget now." *click* "Forget what it taught you." He said while walking into the trailer's closet-sized bathroom. "You're still you so it should be easy." *twitch* "When the brain goes, it's too late to forget. Damage is done."

"Okay, how do I forget?" I asked cautiously.

In the bathroom now, he opened the medicine cabinet above the sink and I heard the rattling of various pill bottles. The occasional 'pop' of lids told me he was taking some out of multiple bottles. Finally, he stepped back out and walked over to where I was on his couch.

"Take these." *click*

"That's- that's it?" I asked, stunned. "What is it?"

"A combination of benzodiazepines," *twitch* "anticholinergics, some sedatives, and a couple anti-depressants." *click* He smiled and held out his hand to give them to me.

"Is it... safe?" I asked, hesitating.

"Safer than the alternative." *twitch*

"And what exactly is the alternative?"

"Remember your neighbor?" *click*

I shivered. 

He continued.

"The seed blooms in your mind," *twitch* "expands. Becomes too much for the brain to process." *click* "Days, hours, it's random. But it all ends the same."

"Doug didn't take the pills then?"

"He did"

Silence. I didn't know what to say.

"The anomaly had more time with him than with you." *click* "Dug deeper before I could intervene. He lasted long though, longer than most." *twitch* He lowered his hand closer to me. 

I accepted.

I'm writing this now, a small pile of pills perched atop Uriel's rickety table in front of me. I figure if I forget the experience from the motel, I'll forget the events of this night as well. Hopefully my transcription of the events will be enough to keep me on track, remind me of what I now know.

I've done some basic Googling on some of these pills and I've discovered that you're not supposed to mix, well, any of them.

Uriel says it will just be a deep sleep.

Lex still isn't answering her phone, but she doesn't have to be up for work for another few hours. I'll fill her in when I come to. Hopefully she's not too worried.

I instructed Uriel to give her this in the event I don't wake up. 

I'll post this when I wake up.

Wish me luck. 

~

I'm alone now.

Alone.

I wasn't going to finish writing this, wasn't going to give a conclusion to a story that didn't deserve it. 

But why not. 

Why not fill you in on the dispicle series of events which unraveled my very being, unspoiled the threads of my life and left them a tangled mess upon the pavement. 

You deserve to know. 

You deserve a chance.

I awoke on Uriel's disgusting couch a week after downing the handful of pills. 

A fucking week. 

He said something about an overdose, a coma, but I wasn't listening. My brain was focused on the screen of my phone, the thirteen missed calls from Lex, the twenty-seven texts.

I tried to call her, and tried to text after that went unanswered. Over and over I pressed call. Over and over it rang.

I ripped the homemade IV out of my arm and jumped to my feet.

Too fast.

I hit the floor hard, the clutter of trash and papers not doing much to break my fall. My vision strobed in flashes of white and black. Before even recovering, I climbed to my feet and pushed the front door open. 

Uriel told me to stop, and offered to drive when I didn't. The sunlight blinded me as we drove through the city, penetrating my eyes even when I closed them tight. 

The drive felt monumentous, sprawling.

I kept calling, kept thinking of ways to apologize and explain everything. I felt awful disappearing like that. There was probably a missing persons report out for me.

Uriel nervously explained that he couldn't unlock my phone to contact anyone, and he had no idea who to contact if he forced his way in. He was focused on keeping me breathing anyways.

We finally pulled into the motel and I sighed with relief when I saw the car was still there. Then I realized that I had the key and she had no way to move it even if she left.

Having no other choice, I walked up the stairs to our room and knocked.

No answer.

I checked the time. She should be off work.

I desperately opened my wallet and almost cried with relief when I spotted a motel keycard peeking out from behind my debit. I swiped it.

The door opened. 

I looked down to Uriel, still sat in the truck, and took a deep breath before walking in.

The room was still, almost silent aside from a slight hum which reverberated around me. I recognized our suitcases immediately, still sat in the far corner atop the luggage rack. I didn't really remember the room, but it felt familiar. 

Accepting that Lex wasn't here, I turned to leave. 

My blood froze.

She sat, completely frozen in place at the desk. So still she seemed part of the room itself.

"Babe?" I asked softly, taking a couple steps towards her.

I suddenly realized that the hum, wasn't. It was a whisper. Words spoken lightning fast, intelligible.

"Babe!" I yelled.

The whispers stopped. She turned, smiling.

"I saw him." her voice was nearly imperceptible, weak.

"And he was... glorious."

I stood in place, my body not processing the words she spoke.

"HE BRINGS WITH HIM THAT WHICH CANNOT BE AND WE RUN!?"

"Lex" I said, my voice wavering. 

"WE SHUN HIS HOLY PRESCENCE SO THAT WE MAY DANCE AMONG OUR PLASTIC PALACE! US DRAWINGS! US ETCHINGS! MERE BAS-RELIEFS ALONG A WALL WHILE THE CAVE STRETCHES INTO INFINITY!"

I ran to her, wrapped her up in my arms.

"It's okay baby. You're okay." I sobbed.

"AND THOSE WHO DWELL WITHIN THE MAW OF ITS INFINITY SING THEIR BLASPHEMOUS SONGS WHICH ECHO THROUGHOUT AND RING IN THE EARS OF THOSE WHO CANNOT HEAR IT!"

She began ripping clumps of her hair out, clawing at her face.

I fought her as gently as I could, wrestled her into the small bathroom. Her muffled screams continued.

"HARK! THE ANGELS SCREAM! THEY SHUDDER AND PULSE BENEATH THE BLACK-"

I walked out to Uriel's truck, my face and shirt soaked through with tears. Upon seeing me, Uriel got out and dashed past, straight up to the room. 

I fell to my knees in the lot, praying to unutterable gods. My body quaked, heaved.

After an unknowable amount of time, I felt a hand on my shoulder. Uriel looked down, solemn.

"Too late" he said, twitching, before getting in his truck and driving away. 

There was nothing else for him to do.

~

The screaming stopped after a couple of hours, her vocal cords shredded. Her voice, reduced to a gutteral growl, continued raving and ranting for the next two days. I slid food through the cracked door multiple times, though it sits there untouched, rotting.

Then the growls stopped.

Then the smell started.

~

I haven't opened the door again.

I won't. 

I sit here, unmoving, not eating, alive yet not living.

I haven't slept since I awoke, can't, don't want to. 

Utter silence has surrounded me, engulfed me, become my companion. Except for each night, around 1 A.M., when a familiar warning makes it's way around the motel.

I think tonight.

I'll meet the warning in the air above this blasted motel.

I'll use the service ladder out back to climb up to the roof.

I'll sit there, patiently.

I'll see what's so glorious about God.
