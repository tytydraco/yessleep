Two months ago, around three in the morning, someone knocked on our townhouse door. Thudding a strange yet deliberate pattern. Four rapid pounds. Two slow thumps. Pause. Repeat. Again.

Again.

The noise awakened my roommate and I as we emerged from our lightless rooms at the same time and hurried downstairs. Naturally, I had my phone in hand to call the cops as Lin (my roommate) approached the front door and peered through the peephole. She held up a finger and whispered for me to wait, *it’s just Em who lives next door*.

Our neighbor Em occasionally hung out with our friend group, and I might’ve had a class or two with her, but we weren’t late-night emergency buddies. Nevertheless, Lin opened the door and Em stumbled nearly inside, breathing heavily and hunched forward in an odd half-crouch as she placed her arm against the door’s frame. The details of our conversation may seem unimportant, but there’s a reason I’m attempting to recount everything as precisely as I remember it.

“Can I come in?” Em asked. “They’re outside.”

“Of course,” Lin replied, quietly. “… Are you okay?”

When Em didn’t answer, Lin grabbed her arm and pulled her inside. I shut the door, locked it, and followed them into the living room, flipping on every light I could find as Lin sat Em on our couch and flopped down beside her. 

There I saw something red staining Em’s chest. Her fingers created scarlet lines as she dragged them across her tattered shirt, muttering something like *can I come in? They’re outside. Please let me in. It’s outside*. Obviously, I called nine-one-one. Then, the two of us attempted to extract answers from Em as to what had left her in such a state, but she remained incoherent. Babbling about how they were inside, *and I* *can’t get it out but thank you so much for letting me in, Lin.*

At the time, I wondered if this was a one-night stand gone wrong (though I was certain she had a boyfriend). I recall opening the living room curtains and looking outside. No one stood there in the pale streetlights of our quiet neighborhood.

Then, I turned to see Em eyes closed, stretched across our couch as if sleeping as Lin told her *everything will be okay. An ambulance will be here soon.* We’d found that couch by a dumpster right before moving in, deep cleaned it, and set it inside our living room with pride. Sofas were expensive and we’d already been stretched thin renting a townhouse within walking distance of campus instead of staying in dorms. Despite the fact it was coming undone, the couch was comfortable, and it was ours. Now, it was stained with blood and would need another cleaning.

These details seem unimportant. Boring even but I feel an urge to be as specific as possible about what I still remember.

The ambulance arrived and Lin accompanied Em to the hospital while I stayed home and cleaned our couch. When Lin returned just as the sun rose, she informed me Em had woken up mid-ride with no recollection of coming to our house, nor trying to claw her own heart out with a butter knife in front of her boyfriend who had been frantically driving all over town in search of her. The police took Lin’s statement and would later take mine though by then Em had already confessed to stabbing herself.

*A panic attack,* *or something* *stupid* Lin had called it. I know this sounds callous, or dumb, but I dismissed the whole thing as an exceptionally bad acid trip or lie. Either Em’s boyfriend hurt her, or she’d gotten blazed past the point of stupidity and harmed herself. Plus, her apology two days later, accompanied with a bag of chocolate covered salted caramels and an assurance her boyfriend had never so much as killed a spider, made me forget the entire affair.

Lin fell violently ill a few weeks later, skipping three days of class after vomiting all over our kitchen floor. Thrice. On the third day of her recovery, I came home to find she’d rearranged our townhouse. It was a two-bedroom, one-bathroom home with a small living room, and an even smaller kitchen. But she’d moved the couch in front of the oven, somehow dragged her entire bed and frame downstairs into the living room, and was eating apple pie on it with the tips of her fingers. In the three years I’d lived with Lin, she’d raged against pie with fruit because she hated its mushy texture.

However, her new taste buds were the least bizarre of her actions over the coming nights. Constantly pacing around the living room or kitchen, she would look me right in the eyes and repeat my name.

Again and again and again.

Not just mine, but her parents and brothers’ names too. These oddities were woven between normal behavior like going to class or cooking us dinner, so I brushed them off as a product of habitual drug use. School and work rendered me too exhausted to ask her if everything was okay… or had it? 

Looking back, I wonder if even then something had gotten to me. Why hadn’t I contacted her parents, boyfriend, or anyone? Why didn’t I confront Lin directly? Had I truly been too tired?

Or had something already gripped me?

Eventually, I suspected whatever befell Lin was related to Em’s crash out. So, I paid her a visit intent on discovering what drugs she used and why she’d introduced Lin to them. However, Em insisted she’d never even touched weed in her entire life.

“Are you lying? Because Lin is really unwell,” I asked, standing on her front stoop. “She got sick right after you came to our house.”

Em scowled. “I don’t take drugs. My breakdown caused me to hallucinate or something. My mental breakdown, that is. It caused me to hallucinate or something and act rashly. Very rashly. It was just a panic attack. If Lin is having a mental breakdown too, she should go to the hospital or wait for it to pass, but like don’t call an ambulance because I’m never paying off that bill. The ambulance bill, that is. It’s too expensive.”

An odd conversation, right?

However, Em ended up being correct. The next morning, Lin transformed into her usual bubbly self, returning our abode to its former state and ordering “sorry-about-that” pizza. 

Granted, there were two notable differences in Lin’s behavior throughout the following days. Foods formerly loathed she consumed animalistically, eating things like steak or meatloaf with her bare hands despite being a vegetarian. Daily, she moved things around her room as if piecing together a puzzle only she saw. Her behavior was annoying, but not worth starting a fight over.

And homework and waitressing left me burned out. A recent break up from my cheating boyfriend of four years left me lonely and depressed, and my mother was divorcing my father after years of a violent, abusive marriage. I had few friends beyond Lin, and even so her own partner caused us to naturally drift apart this year, leaving me in a perpetual state of ennui. Simply put, I lacked the desire to confront her directly.

And I couldn’t pay rent solo anyway, so kicking her out was not an option.

Anyway, Lin spent the following days apologizing for being weird instead of generating income. So, I spoke with the landlord about what to do if she failed to make rent. He told me to figure it out, and I returned home dejected. I could barely afford my half of rent, let alone foot the bill for both of us. Details that seem mundane, but I cherish once holding a normal conversation about something as trivial as unpaid rent.

The date isn’t important, but it was September 1^(st) when I returned home from work to find Lin sitting on our couch with an envelope clutched between her fingers as she called my name. She handed it to me as I sat beside her. This month’s rent.

“I’m sorry I’ve been so weird lately,” she said. “I don’t know what’s gotten into me, but I know it’s giving Wednesday Adams. Whatever has gotten into me, that is. Like I’m just so strange.”

“That’s an understatement.” I gave her a once over because she somehow appeared different. Her bright hazel eyes had dulled, and she wore an unreadably blank expression. But I accepted the apology because what else was I to do?

I’m boring you. I know. But I hope this is proof that at one point I remembered feelings so vividly and conversations with such clarity I wrote them down. Already, my memory of the last several months fades. However, I remember the night someone knocked on my bedroom door. Two slow thumps. Pause. Repeat. Again.

Again.

Now, my bedroom is never locked, and it was three in the damn morning. Thinking an intruder stood on the other side, I picked up my phone and a shoe and stupidly approached the door.

“Hello?” I said. “Who’s there?”

“Hey!” Lin said.

I jerked open the door and dropped the shoe, feeling ridiculous. “What’s wrong?”

“Can I come in? I want to talk to you about something. Only if now is a good time for me to come in. Then, we can talk.”

I scoffed. “Are you aware of the time? Like can’t this wait until tomorrow when we’re both actually awake?”

“It really can’t. It can’t wait until… tomorrow. Waiting until tomorrow is not an option.” Lin leaned a shoulder against the door frame. “Can I come in?”

Even then, I recall thinking it odd. *Can I come in? Like biddy, you live here.* Lin and I were not above barging into each other’s room at any time of day, but I let her in and asked what was wrong.

“I want to apologize again. For acting so strangely. I don’t know what’s gotten into me.” Lin stretched across my bed and sighed. “I know I’ve been acting so strange, and I want to say I’m sorry for that.”

I shrugged. “It’s fine.”

“I know, but it’s like… it’s like something’s inside of me. I can’t get it out.”

“What?”

“What… what?” Lin looked at me, brows furrowed.

“I mean what… what did you just say? Something’s inside of you?”

Lin tilted her head slightly as she stared up at the ceiling. “You must be hearing things, love.”

“Well, I accept your apology but only halfway because I’m pissed you woke me up for this. This seriously could’ve waited until tomorrow.”

Lin gave me a Cheshire cat like smile that sent a shiver up my spine. Then, she left. When I awoke the next morning, something pressed against my chest almost like a weighted vest, and I had a strong urge to consume white chocolate. I hate white chocolate.

Nevertheless, this craving intensified throughout the day until I found myself at the grocery store after class. I couldn’t remember what I’d been doing before discovering a bag of white chocolate kisses clutched between my hands as I stood in the self-checkout line. Nor did I recall driving to the store.

Since then, I’ve done all sorts of things. Things most would consider positive. Those around me say I’ve changed.

But it’s not me anymore.

It’s the Mimic.

Something happened the night I let Lin inside my room. Something that first saw us when we let Em into our house, and it’s growing, blossoming, blooming like a flower within me. Whispering things. Urging me to do things.

This Mimic — it seeks to go unnoticed. This Mimic – it’s grown craftier with each host. I didn’t claw my heart out, nor rearrange the furniture. However, I find myself repeating myself. Especially when I talk about it. The words come out garbled and incoherent, and I say the same thing again and again. Again and again and again. Even writing a note to pass along – somehow it disappears. Or maybe I never write anything at all? Perhaps, all of this exists only inside my head never to be read by anyone.

This submission is kinda my last attempt at finding an answer. While there’s plenty of information online about mimicry and doppelgangers online, none of it describes what I’m experiencing and I need to know if anyone else has managed to fight this thing. This Mimic is duplicating me. Or maybe it’s becoming me. I don’t really understand what it is or what it’s goal is, but I know what it is because it told me.

How long do I have left before I forget everything?

For Lin and Em, it wasn’t long at all. I can see it in the way they greet me now. My friends are no longer there. 

I see *it* in the way Lin stares at me with eyes that aren’t hers. The way Em watches me as I leave my house every morning. I see *it* everywhere. My boss. My American Literature professor. Em’s boyfriend. The barista at my favorite coffee shop. 

It’s in the eyes and I can’t explain it, but have you seen it? The way it studies you –waiting, watching, copying, copying, copying me until I’m no longer here at all?

So, has anyone heard about the Mimic?
