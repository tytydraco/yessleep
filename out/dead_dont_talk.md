My eyes opened to the foggy evening, the sunset hitting my eyes as the smell of mildew hit my small nose. I looked around me, a forest? I was in the woods? When did I end up here? Only thing I remember was going on a date with a boy- what was his name… wait why can’t I remember his name? Weird, you like a guy for a long time but forget their name.

I was laying on the ground sprawled out in the wet soil, leafs covering my clothes and in my long matted blonde hair, which is weird, I remember brushing my hair, straightening it, putting as many products in my hair as I could so that it would smell nice for him.

I sat up and looked around, I was so cold oh my god, so cold where I could see my breath, it was only October though, it felt like winter. I looked down at my hands and I was pale, l looked at them in confusion, I just got a spray tan not too long ago, it was for the homecoming dance.

My outfit was ruined, low rise denim blue jeans with a no shoulder top that ended where my waist was, showing off my belly button piercing. My jeans were ripped for some reason, the button was snagged off and the zipper was down and stuck when I tried to pull it up.

I stood up, I felt weak, as if I hadn’t eaten in weeks, I felt like I was dying, I needed to go home, my parents must be worried sick, plus I need to have a talk with my date.

All I remember was walking around, felt like days but it could’ve been hours… maybe three? I didn’t have my phone on me, so I didn’t know. I kept trying to scream for help but nothing would come out of my mouth, it was as if my voice was just gone. I was so cold, my hands were frozen and my lips were probably blue.

I heard a crunch, as if you were to be eating a bag of chips, then footsteps, more of them.

I looked up to see a bright light flashing into my eyes, I then heard voices.

“There she is!” Someone said in a male voice.

I smiled when I realized it was police officers, oh thank god! I knew someone would find me!

I tried to yell but nothing came out, so I just raised my arms into the air and started running towards them.

But they just… ran right past me? As if they couldn’t see me, ouch, that hurt?

I looked behind me to watch them running towards the direction I woke up from, why would they look right there? I’m right here! Can’t they see me.

I started to run with them, as fast as I could, I was out of breath even though it didn’t feel like it, I didn’t really feel anything at all besides being cold.

Once the officers came to a stop, I slowed down, bending over and putting my hands on my knees and breathing.

Then I saw an officer kneel down, onto the ground, I recognized this place, it was where I woke up! He took off his hat and placed it onto his chest and so did other officers.

I looked at all of them and started pushing past them, but for some reason they didn’t say anything.

I looked down towards the leaves I woke up from only to find… me?

But, I was…

Dead. 

My eyes were closed and I saw blood on my face and purple finger prints imprinted in my skin, my skin was pale and grey and lips blue and bleeding, my hands and wrists were tied together as they laid behind my back, I looked ugly. Why was I caring about my looks? I’m dead.

I heard a scream, I looked behind me only to find mom covering her hands over her face and sobbing, screaming my name. I forgot my name, I guess my name was Syd? Why would I be named Syd? 

I watched as my mother ran towards my dead body, she sat down and started to cradle me in her arms, touching my face.

I just stood there, mouth closed as a tear went down my face. I knelt down with her and started holding her, kissing her on the head as I stared at myself.

Why did I have to be the one to die, I had so much to live for. I’m beautiful, I’m a star, I don’t wanna go yet.

As I saw the paramedics come, I just sat there and watched them take me into their arms and put me into a body bag, as if I was a piece of trash.

I wasn’t though, I should be in a golden bag, I’m- well was a good person, smart, funny, virgin, nice to people.

“Who did it?” An officer asked.

“Some kid named Derek Anderson, kid took her on a date, assaulted her, strangled her, then did other stuff with the body.” Another officer explained. “She didn’t even see it coming.”

I stood there and listened to what they said, I looked down at my hands then down my legs. I sat on the ground and put my knees to my chest, starting to sob.

But nothing came out of my mouth, cause the dead don’t talk.
