I wish I never came here, to the town of Fredericksburg. The roads are like ebony in the night, and the town doesn’t operate like a town should.

Thankfully, I managed to obtain the book before the moon rose and became my world. It details dos and don’ts — what I need to do before the moon blinks and pitch blackness falls upon the town.

My mind was still on the close call with the smiling deer I almost didn’t notice the red light that was fast approaching on the road. Slamming on the breaks, I could hear the sicking crunching of the brake on metal emanating from my wheels. Looked to my left, no one, looked to my right, no one, confidently I looked forward ready to run the light only to be met with a police cruiser, and a cop standing outside of it. I sighed waiting, I wasn’t going to deal with this town’s cops today, especially when I could see that he, it, was staring directly at me.

Sending a shiver down my spine, I still can’t get used to the glowing orbs every cop in this town have, the jagged teeth smiles, the tattered police uniforms, and their muscles flexing as if waiting for me to mess up. But who cares, all I had to do was wait for this light to turn green and I’d be back on my way into town to find the church.

Pulling open the book, I started reading on the directions to the church, right at the stop sign, left, left, right, right at the light, go straight, left left left left left. The directions were obviously..flawed, yet despite each time I went into town, I couldn’t find the church. The book describes it as a tall building, a church of “hope” in this moon filled night. Time ticked by, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and yet the light still shown a bright red.

My book was then illuminated by a bright white light.

“shit, fuck, dammit” I said, sinking low in my car. “The moon is exploring again” I whispered to myself, watching the white light move over my car like there was a spotlight coming from the sky and down the street. A smiling deer came bursting out of the tree line up ahead directly into the glow on the moon. Silence, only to be sharply interrupted by a loud laughing from the sky above. I watched as the smiling deer’s hide was flayed off, it’s hands ripped from it’s sockets, it screaming as chunks of it’s body were torn off and thrown to the sides of the road. The laughing continued until all that was left of the deer were chunks of flesh on the sides the road, and a large blood stain in the center. As if content, the bright white light of the moon dissipated, leaving me once again in the darkness of the night, only illuminated by the stoplight….still red.

Sighing and shivering, I cranked up the heat, then cranked it up some more, then slammed it all the way to the right. It was freezing in my car, why was it getting so cold. Looking up, red light, to then to my right, my heart froze like the air around me. There was a family outside, smiling with grins far to wide, eyes bulging open, and facing towards me on the side of the road. I looked to my left, more people, all staring at me in normal clothing. There was a milkman, a maid, a man in a suit, and more, all their eyes staring at my car, smiling and breathing in the freezing night.

I put my hands in front of the heater vent, now freezing, and that’s when I began to notice, frost was starting to appear around my car. I looked up, red still red, looked left, more people, looked right even more people were starting to surround me, looked forward, the cop was still there, waiting for me to break the law. I started to hear a soft cracking noise as my windows began to freeze, my breath coming out as mist as the temperature of the car began to drop. Looked up, still a red light, fuck I’m so fucking cold. Looked right, the it was now easily a crowd of a fifty people, all smiling, all staring, eyes bulging from their eye sockets. Before I could even look left I heard a loud tapping noise. Shaking from the cold and the fear, I saw a finger digging into the glass, one of them approached my car.

Thinking quickly, I opened the book, I remember a chapter that explained this, it’s somewhere in this book’s pages. I sifted frantically through the pages, my fingers growing colder and colder, the tapping getting louder and louder until I found it. My solution, my answer, how to get out of here. I rolled down my window, being greeted by a disheveled old man, frowning. Looking behind him, the crowd that formed were doing the same, frowning and still staring.

“M-m-my ba-a-ad” I said, my teeth chattering from the freezing cold. I pulled out a dollar from my pocket, giving it to the old man. His face was then illuminated by a bright green, looking up, the light was finally going to let me go. My tires crackled as they broke free from the frost as I drove into the entrance of the town.
