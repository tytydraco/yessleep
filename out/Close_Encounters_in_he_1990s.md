***The title should be in the 1990s****

This is a CORE memory as it caused me to distrust my parents at a young age. When I was 5 we lived in this house in upstate NY and my room was at the front with a large window in it that faced our driveway.

I woke up one night out of a dead sleep to see my room full of purple light. It was like daytime only everything was bright and purple. 

And in the window of my room my mom stood there looking out and up with no emotion or concern. 

I knew something was wrong I could feel it so I asked her softly what was happening. She ignored me and I walked up to her getting out of my bed and she just stood there.

So I ran down the hall to go get my dad and I saw our front door was open so I walked slowly and there was my dad on the front porch. He was in his underwear and socks, emotionless and just staring up in the sky.

It was much brighter outside and I said to him what was going on and that I was afraid. He then looked at me with this evil look and told me to go inside, and when I asked another question he yelled to go back in the effing house.

As I did I saw my mom now in the living room on both knees on the couch looking out the window behind it.
I finally started crying and asked her what was happening?

Without saying a word she got up without looking at me, and guided me by my hand to my room. And shut the door but the lights didn't stop and I looked out and saw that they were now flashing in a large ring.

I got back in my bed and layed there until I fell asleep and in the morning I asked my parents about what had happened last night. So I described what happened and they both told me they didn't remember.

I insisted they were up and one was in my room and one was outside. They grew irritated and insisted I was dreaming but I told my dad that I was outside with him, and what he was wearing. 

He grew panicked and was fixed that I went outside in the middle of the night.

I did a lot of research about this and came to different conclusions. My mom in 2013 told me that she remembers me telling her about it. And insisted that it wasn't her I saw and she told me what she would have done.

Which was to put me in her room and had locked all the doors and windows. While my dad had guns and other weapons to keep my sister and I safe. 

While this made me feel better it really made more concerned that if those weren't my parents that I saw that night. Who were they?
