Iâ€™ve liked a guy for a while but I know he doesnâ€™t like me back. Everything about him I find perfect. His eyes and his nose are cute. When he gets in trouble with the teacher. Or when he laughs and comments during class. The way he looks at me and does a little nod and says hi to me in class or in the hallway always makes me smile. Even when I try not to those small moments make me happy. Heâ€™s a nice guy and heâ€™s funny. I even found out his favorite marvel character is spider man, which is mine too!! We havenâ€™t had a lot of talks because Iâ€™m a shy person(I have social anxiety) but something about him that just keeps bringing me back to him every time I try to move on. The thing is.. he will never look at me that way. A few months ago I met this guy (letâ€™s call him x) and we started talking. After a week he confessed things started going bad. He would on and off leave saying we shouldnâ€™t be together. I had a very hard time because of it. I know it sounds bad because I shouldnâ€™t go for his friend but thatâ€™s not what happened. While I tried getting over it I started noticing his friend (the guy I like). Everytime I felt down during the day just a simple hi or fist bump from him would make me happy. Obviously I got over x and just tried to stay away from guys or relationships. The fact that they are friends I knew he would never like me back. 

A few weeks ago x started texting me again. I didnâ€™t really want to but I tend to try and be nice and texted back. We had some conversations and I decided to ask him about his friend.. immediately he asked if I liked him. I ended up saying yes. He gave me his Snapchat and I added him. Not even a few minutes later he added me back. I was so excited and happy but at the same time told myself I had no expectations it would go anywhere and Iâ€™d just try and be friends. We would send eachother snaps and even had a streak. Some days later x texted me again saying I shouldnâ€™t go for him cause he was already talking to someone. I was so sad but decided to act like it wasnâ€™t a big deal. We stopped sending eachother things and out of attachment I unadded him quick. I canâ€™t lie that even know I think about him and hope maybe heâ€™ll see me the way I see him.
