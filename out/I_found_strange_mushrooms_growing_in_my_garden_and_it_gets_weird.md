As I was watering the flowers in my garden I noticed small bumps in the ground, at first I couldn't understand what they were but upon looking closer, I realized they were mushrooms but very weird.

I am no mushroom expert and I haven't seen mushrooms like the one's growing in my garden before, they were bright purple with bright yellow stems, it felt like as if they were taken directly from a kids drawing.

I snapped a picture and posted it on an online forum seeking advice, I hoped there would be mushroom experts who could guide me what to do with these mushrooms but the forum members were as confused as I was.

They told me they had never seen anything like that before but adviced me to not eat them and even avoid touching them, I was told that the bright color of mushrooms indicated that they were poisonous.

For a week I left them untouched but when I saw them again, they had grown a bit more, they had longer stems and the stems looked a shade brighter than before and had pink spots all over them.

I searched online but found nothing close to what was growing in my garden, no website or forum could explain what they were or how to handle them.

All sorts of horrid thoughts occupied my mind, I was scared the mushrooms would release poisonous spores, that would end up killing me, I went even as far as to think that the mushrooms would grow all over my house and even all over my body!

I had sleepless nights and resolved to do something about the mushrooms, I got a pair of rubber gloves and pulled out the mushrooms. Surprisingly, they were easy to pull out and came into my hands without any resistance.

I wore a mask and sliced the mushrooms down from the middle, they were completely white inside, I put them inside a glass jar and left them there for a week.

Nothing grew back in their place, I checked back the mushrooms in the jar, they hadn't gone bad, they were as it is. A strange thought struck my mind, I know you all would think I am an idiot for doing it and I admit I was an idiot but at that time I had started to think maybe the mushrooms had some kind of healing or even magical properties.

I boiled the mushrooms in the water, the water turned dark purple and I strained it and drank it, I expected it to taste bitter but it was surprisingly sweet like candy. 

Nothing happened in the first few days and then I started feeling stronger and more energetic than ever before, I thought maybe my guess was right, these were indeed magical mushrooms!

But a month later it all started to get worse, I started vomiting like never before, I couldn't eat anything, there was a strange bitter taste in my mouth and I had severe abdominal pain.

I went to the doctor but all my results came back fine, I wasn't ill, the doctor thought I was perhaps having an anxiety attack and I was referred to a therapist who prescribed me anti-anxiety medication.

The medicine did seem to work and I dismissed my symptoms as anxiety until my skin was run over with light purple spots, I was terrified and was about to visit the doctor when they suddenly disappeared, I was shocked, I couldn't make out what was happening.

My fingers turned purple and I felt the muscles in my arm go rigid, it was extremely painful to move them but the sensation as well the color in my fingers went away soon, my symptoms were intense but they would go away in a few minutes.

I woke up with blurry vision the next week and was terrified that I was going to go blind, my mind tried to process how I would live with sight loss but soon my vision cleared but then my nose started bleeding, so much that I thought I was going to pass out but it stopped on it's own.

I got all the tests done again but nothing came up in them, I was healthy like before, no disorder, no disease, my symptoms were assigned to severe anxiety attacks and I was adviced to not discontinue the medication.

I followed all the instructions but my symptoms did not ease, they wouldn't last long but still it has disrupted my life and I am terrified what would happen next.

Sometimes my ears bleed, other times I feel a strange sensation taking over my body, I feel my body go rigid, so rigid that I can't even move my eyelids, I even get abdominal pains, so intense that I feel a monster is chewing up my intestines!

I know I am an idiot and I feel really stupid to reveal this but please don't judge me for it, I accidentally ended up deleting the photos of the mushrooms on my phone and I can't find it on the forum too, after boiling the mushrooms I had thrown them away because I saw no use for them, so I don't have any evidence of them and no one is believing me when I tell them that I got all those symptoms from the mushrooms.

My life hasn't been the same ever since, my tests don't show anything weird and I am dismissed as paranoid, I can't predict what would happen with my body next and how long it will last, I am plagued by a fear that the symptoms may never go, I am trying to adapt to this new life but it's very hard. My advice to everyone else is that please don't eat anything strange growing in your garden.
