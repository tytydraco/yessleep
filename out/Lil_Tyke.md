Nearly a month ago, my friend Randy went missing. He just kinda disappeared without a trace, not so much as a note. I had talked to him the day it happened, and he seemed just fine. I’ve read that this type of thing happens suddenly. I just don’t know.

I knew Randy since fifth grade, we were best friends for five years. I went to his house all the time; his mom was nice, even if his dad was a deadbeat who ran off. Randy was a good student, he had friends, he was happy. The cops say it's pretty common for someone to seem happy. I think they were hinting that Randy went off and killed himself, but I don’t buy it. That’s just something cops say so they don’t have to try as hard. 

I went to Randy’s house a few days after he was gone. His mom was shut in her room, so I just slipped into his room. If she heard me, then she didn’t care. His room was just as it was before he went away. It was a messy sort of organized, all of Randy’s junk was sectioned into corners of the room by type. I poked around, hoping to find some note or clue the police skimmed over. I knew Randy better than they did; I would know if something was off.

After sifting through some trash and clothes, I made my way to his electronics corner. I untangled wires and tossed consoles aside until I heard something clatter on the floor. I jumped back, startled, hoping Randy’s mom wouldn’t come and ask me what I was doing. I held my breath until I was satisfied she would get up, then I looked down. 

A large lilac cube rested at my feet. It was dusty and smooth; it looked like it was made for little kids. I picked it up and gave it a once-over. There were random lines all around it, something that people in the 2000s thought looked futuristic. On one side was one of those old screens, the kind that Tamagotchi used. The message “To Randal - From Dad” was written on the other side in sloppy Sharpie. Other than that, it was smooth, no buttons or battery port. It looked cheap and clunky, something you’d see at Walmart. It must’ve been about a foot across on all sides; my head probably could’ve fit in it.

Randy’s shitty dad must’ve got Randy some cheap toy from Goodwill before he ditched his kid. Classy. I tossed the cube on Randy’s bed and sighed. There was nothing here. Either the cops took all the good evidence, or Randy didn’t want to be found. I put my hands in my pockets and spun to leave the room. I was halfway to the door when I heard a little noise from the cube. I sighed harder and spun back around to turn off the stupid kids' toy. I didn’t want some stupid box to bother Randy’s mom with “Mary Had a Little Lamb” or some such.

I picked up the cube and looked at the screen. A little chime played out of an unseen speaker while the words “Lil’ Tyke” flashed in that classic greenish-black pixel style. The chime died, and a face faded onto the screen. Thanks to the cube’s surprising size the face on it had impressive resolution. It had big eyes with cute highlights, a small cartoonish nose, and a large grin. 

“Howdy! I’m Tyke!” Sang the cube. The mouth morphed into different shapes to imitate speech, although it lagged behind the words. The voice was surprisingly expressive, although it still sounded like Microsoft SAM. Imagine a childlike text-to-speech with a hint of emotion. Pretty advanced for a clunky toy. 

I turned the cube over in my hands, looking for some sort of off switch. As I turned, it felt like something inside the cube was sliding around, and the speakers gave a soft whine. After finding nothing, I dropped the box on the bed in frustration. To my surprise, the cube let out a muffled squeak. 

I hesitated before picking it back up. Looking at the screen, I could see the face again, but it had its eyes replaced with a simple animation of spirals. After a few seconds, the face shook its head, by which I mean it blinked left and right, before returning to normal. 

“Jeez, you sure play rough!” Giggled the cube. Noticing his pupils looking at mine, I tilted my head to the right. After a second, the pupils of the face slowly faded to follow my head. 

“Damn, you’re pretty advanced,” I said. I was thinking out loud, not to the cube, but it didn’t seem to get the memo. 

“Oh, please don’t use bad words! I’m a good boy, so bad words make me sad…” The cube shifted into a frown with furrowed eyebrows while it played its rudimentary animation. 

“Right, uhhhh, sorry?”

“It’s a-ok! Say, you look pretty down in the dumps! What’s the matter?” The cube chirped, replacing the sad face with concern. I was not about to have therapy with a baby toy, but maybe its little electronic brain knew something about Randy. 

“Say, you wanna come to my house? I got some questions.” I said softly to the box, remembering the grieving woman down the hall. The box put up a cheerful smile and excitedly whispered back.

“Oh yes. This is gonna be so much fun.”

\---

I put the thing on my dresser and sat across from it on my bed, about eye level with it. I felt pretty stupid about questioning a baby’s toy, but it was the best I had. I figured I’d ease into it with some simple questions before getting to Randy.

“Well… Do you have a name?” I asked sheepishly.

“Why, of course! My name is Timothy Tyke, but all my best friends just call me Tyke!” Beamed ‘Tyke’. I still couldn’t pinpoint any controls or interface on the walk to my house. No camera or charging port, or anything.

“Well, Tyke, where is your speaker?” 

“Silly, I don’t have a speaker,” Tyke replied, the pixeled grin plastered to the screen. I guess it would make sense not to program your toy to know where its speaker is. What is some kid asked, then shoved Play-Doh into it.

“Well, do you have a creator? Like a company or production code?” 

“Oh, of course! I was made by Dallas Martin Hartwell on the eighth of August, 2008!” Tyke said, beaming with pride. That is really weird. Dallas Hartwell was Randy’s dad, and Randy would’ve been around six in ‘08. 

“Did Dallas make you for Randy?” I asked. Tyke’s simple face dissolved from surprise to fear to anger and then to nervousness. A little bead of pixelated sweat, really just a small U, formed on Tyke’s cheek. For the first time, Tyke didn’t want to look me in the eyes. 

“Haha, how do you know Randy?” Chuckled Tyke, trying to change the subject. 

“I’m his best friend… Until he disappeared…” I said, peering at Tyke. Tyke still wouldn’t meet my line of sight. Tyke nervously twisted his eyes in every direction before calming back down to his default grin.

“Wow, what luck! Randy was my best friend, too! Since he’s gone, we can be each other’s best friends now!” Tyke cheered. I didn’t like how he used past tense. I scooted back away from the cube sitting across from me. I felt a tingle up my spine that danced to my scalp. 

“Since y’all were such good friends, do you know what happened?” I asked. Tyke’s face flashed with a few frames of anger before fading into a deep frown. He looked down and sighed.

“Me and Randy were good friends when he was a good boy like me. We had so much fun! For a while…” Tyke’s face dropped more. A few pixels on the corners of his eyes signified growing tears.

“Then Randy must’ve lost me, and I was so sad… It was dark and scary in there… But then Randy found me! We were going to be buddies again!” Tyke got chipper again, staring past me and into nothing. I waited for a minute, but Tyke didn’t continue.

“So, do you know what happened to Randy?” I asked, backing up further. I knew it was stupid, but Tyke was making me crawl in my skin. I started slowly, trailing my hand towards my nightstand, looking for a weapon. 

“Well, he didn’t wanna be my friend anymore! After all I did for him, all we did, he wanted to put me away!” Tyke quickly went back to looking miserable. He was getting louder and louder, the speakers starting to lose quality as it peaked. My hand reached the corner of my nightstand and felt something heavy. I gripped it tightly. 

“Well, Tyke, what did you do to Randy?” I asked, hesitantly. This worked Tyke into a hysterical fervor. 

“I had to make sure we would be together! Dallas wanted to leave me, and I fixed him! I fixed Randy! We’re gonna stay friends forever and ever!” Tyke screeched. His voice went too high sometimes and looped back around to be deep, causing a distortion that hurt my ears. Tyke huffed and puffed, the sides of the cube bulging ever so slightly. 

“Uh huh… Ok Tyke… Well, we can be friends…” I said softly, slowly inching my way back to the front of the bed. The object in my hand felt solid enough, but I was too anxious to glance back and see what it was. Tyke’s expression softened as he looked back at me. 

“R-really?.. Forever?” Tyke asked pitifully. I finally reached the front of the bed, my mind racing with possibilities. It shouldn’t be too hard to hit a large, stationary cube, but it didn’t feel safe. I thought I could descalate. 

“Oh sure, forever! But, I’ve got to turn you off sometimes, you know? Do you have an off button, maybe?” I asked, trying to sound as understanding and sweet as possible. Tyke didn’t buy it. He looked at me blankly before his pixels twisted into sorrow. 

“You wanna get rid of me! Just like them! You wanna lose me! I don’t wanna! You can’t do it!” Wailed Tyke. Low-resolution tears streamed steadily down Tyke’s screen. He sobbed in a high and low pitch encompassing each other, making my head throb. The sides of the smooth cube bulged harder, flexing out against invisible seams. 

I wasn’t going to wait to see what Tyke was planning. I sprang from the bed and swung as hard as I could into the side of Tyke. The object, a hefty flashlight, cracked loudly against the cheap plastic. A bright flash came from the screen when it connected before all the momentum of my arm transferred into the cube. The cube flew off the dresser and tumbled across the floor with a loud clattering. It sounded heavier than before, like someone filled with water. 

I dropped the flashlight and glanced at Tyke. The box was on the floor, one side cracked slightly. A dark red ooze frothed forth from the crack and surrounding edges. The screen was starting to go dark, fluid filling up behind it. I didn’t wait much longer. I ripped a pillow from my bed and shook it out of the case. Carefully, I picked Tyke up in the case and held it away from my body. The ooze was starting to soak the case, so I ran outside onto my driveway. 

I spent a few minutes slamming the pillowcase into the driveway. The first few slams were like throwing a safe into concrete before the thuds got wetter and wetter. I could feel Tyke break up against the ground, his moist parts shifting around when I raised the case back up. The pillowcase dripped with red, and a nasty, stagnant pool had formed on the driveway. I ran out back and threw the case into a nice pile of dead limbs. I doused it in lighter fluid and watched it all burn for an hour. 

Now I’m here. I buried the shell of Tyke out in the woods about an hour away, six feet down. I’m not sure what that thing was, or what happened to Dallas and Randy. I’m not sure I want to know. They’re gone, I can feel it in my bones. They aren’t coming back. At least Dallas and Randy aren’t. Now and then, I get a jolt up my back and feel to comfortable buzz of an analog speaker in my ear. It happens in my bed or while walking down the street, any time I feel like I’m safe. I’ve just got a horrid feeling that Tyke doesn’t abandon his friends so easily.
