Hi Reddit,

I don’t exactly know how to start this, but I am a recently single father with two kids, John and Jane. They’re twins (placeholder names, not their actual names). I’m working over 40 hours a week to provide for my children, but no matter what, I always put them first. When their mother passed, I promised her that I would take care of them and never put them in harm’s way.

After she passed, my children, who were 7 at the time, didn’t take it well, which is perfectly normal. My family, who live a few states away, took time out of their schedules to come over and help me and my kids during this time. My parents even stayed with us for close to a year. Sadly, my son took it the worst. No matter how much I tried to lift his spirits and make him smile, he wouldn’t budge. The doctors told me he has traumatic mutism.

I’ve done everything the doctors advised. I’ve taken him to cognitive behavioral therapy, play therapy, family therapy, speech therapy—every therapy you can imagine. The one thing that has helped me understand him more and his emotions has been his diary.

We didn’t start the diary method until he was almost 9, but he would write in it fairly often, giving me a rare glimpse into his emotions. Recently, though, I’ve been seeing some entries that are deeply concerning. I showed them to his therapist, but they told me he has created an imaginary friend as a coping mechanism for comfort and safety. Yet, I can’t shake this feeling of dread these entries give me.

His words, his descriptions—something isn’t right. I feel an icy hand gripping my heart every time I read them. I wanted to share a few excerpts with you, I rewrote them so you can actually read what they say. I didn’t change anything he wrote either, I’m hoping someone can help me understand. Am I just being paranoid, or is there something more sinister at play here?

Sorry for the long backstory; I just wanted to clear up some information so everyone can have a better idea of my situation. All comments are welcome; just please don’t be creepy. Thank you, and I hope you all can help me.

Dear Diary,

Hi Diary, I had a good day. Nancy took us to the park and we got ice cream. I got a SpongeBob popsicle. I love the gum it comes with. It’s like a double treat. The park had a clown. I tried to show Jane, but she said, “What am I looking at?” Guess girls really do go to Jupiter. Ok, bye Diary.

Dear Diary,

Hi Diary, I had a fun day. Nancy took us to the park, and I went on my favorite slide. It’s the red slide. I like it because I can ride it all the time since kids never go to it. Today was fun because on the slide, I found a SpongeBob popsicle. I showed Jane, but she just screamed at Nancy, asking why I got ice cream and not her. Nancy was confused because I already ate my SpongeBob, so she bought us more ice cream. Double ice cream is always fun. Dad came home early, and we watched Adventure Time. Ok, bye Diary.

Dear Diary,

Hi Diary, I saw Mr. Clown last night. I was playing with my toys by the window, and I saw him. He was in our woods with a big black bag. Maybe it has his clown stuff like shoes and chickens. He looked at me, and I knew he saw me. We looked at each other for a long time. He honked his red nose at me, and I honked my nose back. Mr. Clown walked away. Mr. Clown is funny. Bye, Diary.

Dear Diary,

Hi Diary, Nancy took me to Miss Clair. She’s a doctor who plays games with me and makes me write to you. Miss Clair is nice. Nancy then took us to Ryan’s house today. I don’t like Ryan. He just plays with Jane. I like walking around the woods and looking for sword sticks. Nancy yelled at me because I was playing there. Nancy never yells at Jane, only me. Ok, bye Diary.

Dear Diary,

Hi Diary, Jane hit me. We were at the park, and I saw Mr. Clown again. He honked his red nose, and I honked mine. I laughed, and he laughed. I wanted Jane to laugh, so I went over to get her. She didn’t want to see and told me to leave her alone. But she likes laughing, so I tried to pull her to show her Mr. Clown, but she kept saying no and hit me. I cried, and Nancy hugged me and said Jane just didn’t want to play. I wish Jane knew she was going to Jupiter, and I was going to Mars. Ok, bye Diary.

Dear Diary,

Hi Diary, Dad came home early, and we went to the park. I took him to the red slide, and we found a SpongeBob popsicle on the slide. I was so happy, but he said we don’t eat things that aren’t ours. But I’m the only one who goes to the red slide, so it’s mine. It’s ok, though. He got us new popsicles. I asked for SpongeBob, but they said they ran out? How? You’re the ice cream man. You sell ice cream? I wasn’t very happy, but at least the Ninja Turtle one is also good. Bye, Diary.

Dear Diary,

Hi Diary, today Dad took us to Ryan’s house. I don’t like Ryan’s house, but I saw Mr. Clown in the woods. I gave him a sword stick, and we played. He stopped playing and looked at me. He looked for a long time doing nothing. I thought he was done, so I walked away, but then he pulled out a SpongeBob popsicle. I tried to grab it, but he moved back. He wagged his finger and pointed to the house. He started to run like a dog into the forest. Mr. Clown is funny. I went back to the house, and I found the SpongeBob popsicle on the slide. Mr. Clown is nice. I like Mr. Clown.
