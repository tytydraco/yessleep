Within the span of 30 days, my life was completely turned upside down by an unforeseen event. I should admit, had I followed the rules, this event may not have had such a terrible, life-changing ending. Regrettably, like many others in similar circumstances, I chose not to comply.

It all began with a knock on my apartment door one day. Standing before me was a man dressed in a suit and tie, the epitome of a typical salesman I encountered regularly on the streets. Naturally, he introduced himself as such, which came as no surprise.

However, what astounded me was the product he claimed to be selling.

"Life," declared the man, "I'm selling life."

He proved to be the most foolish salesman I had ever encountered. Who in their right mind would believe such a thing?

I was on the verge of abruptly closing the door, but he prevented it from shutting completely. "I'm not imposing anything, but perhaps you could spare a moment to listen," he suggested. "If you're still uninterested by the time I finish speaking, I'll leave." He delivered this with an amiable smile. "However, I'm confident you'll be intrigued. This product is truly one of a kind," he continued.

Strangely enough, his manner of speaking managed to convince me to lend an ear. "Alright, go ahead. If I find myself uninterested, regardless of whether you've concluded or not, I'll slam this door shut," I informed him.

The man proceeded to explain his product. According to him, he had the ability to sell me any kind of life I desired. If I grew dissatisfied with my current existence, I could purchase an entirely different life from him—one that could be drastically divergent. For instance, if I were a lonesome 9-to-5 employee discontent with my situation, I could acquire the life of a successful, carefree CEO of a major corporation. I could transition to this new life as soon as the following morning.

It sounded fantastical, and to some extent, intriguing, but it made no logical sense. Could my life truly transform 180 degrees overnight? I questioned the process behind such a claim.

"Seriously? How much does that cost?" I chuckled, posing the question in a jesting manner.

"Only $999,999 per year, sir. However, you can only purchase it with the money you possess in your current life; you cannot utilize funds from the newly acquired life," he responded.

"Absurd! I don't possess that kind of money. So, no thank you!" I exclaimed, slamming the door shut. Yet, I heard his voice from the other side, "We offer a 30-day free trial feature."

His explanation may have seemed incredible, implausible, and utterly nonsensical, but a part of me felt intrigued, yearning to learn more. As a destitute and solitary 9-to-5 worker, my discontentment with life surpassed mere dissatisfaction—I despised it. Thus, I reopened the door and inquired further.

"Here's the proposition," the man elucidated. "The lives we sell once belonged to individuals who have passed away. They sell their lives to us after death, in exchange for financial support for their families. I presume that is where you'd like me to begin," he initiated his explanation as I invited him to sit on my couch.

"You can purchase and live these lives as if they were your own, through an annual subscription fee. Naturally, since this product has no physical form, there is no way to ascertain its suitability for you, right? Hence, we offer a 30-day free trial feature."

"If, after the trial period, you decide our product isn't to your liking, no problem. We will reclaim it, restoring your original life without any payment required. It's completely free," he assured me.

"Wait a moment. A subscription? What if..." I trailed off. "Let's say I have enough money to pay for the subscription. But then, after a few years, I run out of funds. I can no longer afford it. What would happen to me?"

"An excellent question, sir," the salesman replied, brimming with excitement.

"In such a scenario," he continued, "I would pay you another visit to inform you that the life you are currently living, the life you purchased, will be reclaimed. By the following morning, you will be returned to your previous life."

"Don't worry, the entire process incurs no additional cost. It's completely free of charge," he added.

I found it rather intriguing.

"All you have to do, sir, is sign your name right here," the salesman said, producing a sheet of paper and pointing at the bottom, where it read 'customer's signature.' "Is there any risk?" I inquired, seeking reassurance.

"No, sir. No risk at all. Trust me, there's no need to worry," he replied, maintaining a friendly smile.

"Unless, of course, you were to harm the salesman offering you the trial—namely, me," he added.

"Why would I do that? I don't think I would kill anyone for something like this," I laughed, considering it a silly jest.

"Well, people differ from one another, sir. You may not, but someone else might. It's merely a precaution. Unexpected occurrences do happen, sir. Therefore, I see no harm in being prepared," he responded calmly, his amiable smile unwavering.

I informed the salesman that I desired a life of wealth, handsomeness, and playboy-like charisma. I wanted to possess everything I desired—a glamorous existence perpetually surrounded by alluring women.

"Of course, sir," he acknowledged, jotting down my request on the paper.

With a swift stroke, I affixed my signature at the bottom of the document, and shortly thereafter, the salesman departed from my apartment. "I will process your request promptly, and I assure you it will be ready when you awaken tomorrow morning," he declared before stepping out the door.

"And remember, sir, it's a 30-day trial," he reminded me as he traversed the building's corridor.

After closing my apartment door, I immediately found myself contemplating, "What have I done?"

The entire event was undeniably peculiar, yet I disregarded such thoughts. Regardless of its veracity, it was free, and thus, I had nothing to lose.

Or so I believed.

The following morning, I roused from my slumber and found myself gazing at a different-looking ceiling. Sitting up in bed, I surveyed the room I was in, realizing it was a luxurious space that clearly wasn't mine.

Suddenly, the memory of the life-selling salesman flooded back to me, prompting me to leap out of bed and rush toward the mirror. To my relief, it was still my face staring back at me. I hadn't been transformed into someone else. But had I truly begun living the life I had requested? Judging by the opulent room I woke up in, it certainly seemed so.

"Hi, baby. Are you awake?" I heard a seductive and enticing voice from behind me.

Turning my head, excitement surged through me as I laid eyes on two stunning women, resembling the ones I had seen in Playboy magazine, clad only in lingerie, making their way toward me.

As unbelievable as it sounded, the salesman was real! He had actually sold me a new life!

Later that day, I discovered that I was now the CEO of a recently IPO'd IT company. My life overflowed with wealth, desirable women, extravagant possessions, and all the glamour I had ever yearned for. It was the life I had always dreamed of!

For the next 30 days, I indulged in a captivating existence that never grew dull. Money, women, and all the things I cherished and longed for became mine. I live a luxurious life at my glamorous mansion, surrounded by alluring women gracing my bed. I go travel around the world wherever and whenever I want. I buy literally anything I wanted, when I want it. Money is never an issue. Not even the slightest. Neither do power, strength, influence, and anything in-between.

In my 36 years of living prior to this life-altering moment, nothing came close to those extraordinary 30 days. They were the most exhilarating days I had ever experienced.

I even found myself wishing that the salesman would never reappear to take away this magnificent life from me.

But I was mistaken.

Exactly at 11:59 PM, in the dead of night on the 30th day, I heard a ring at my door. I hadn't anticipated the salesman's return, but when I opened the door, there he stood—the salesman of life.

"How did you get here? There are security personnel at the gate!" I exclaimed to the salesman.

"How I arrived shouldn’t be your concern," he responded. "I'm simply here to remind you that the free trial has come to an end," he explained. "Would you like to purchase this life or revert back to your original existence?" the salesman inquired.

After experiencing 30 days of the perfect, breathtaking life I had always yearned for, was I now expected to surrender it and return to my sad and pathetic old life?

No! Absolutely not! No way in hell!

"Sure, please come in and have a seat. Explain to me how I can proceed with purchasing this life. I genuinely adore it," I declared, welcoming the salesman and offering him a spot on the couch.

"You have a truly beautiful life here," he remarked, surveying the living room.

As soon as he turned his back against me, I swiftly seized the small metallic statue from the nearby shelf and struck the salesman's head with it. Blow after blow, I relentlessly attacked him, even as he fell to the ground, bleeding.

"This beautiful life is mine, and I'll never give it up!" I shouted as I drag his lifeless body to the backyard and bury it there.

Once I finished, I promptly cleaned myself up and ascended the stairs, joining two sleeping, naked women on my enormous bed.

"This perfect and beautiful life is now mine! Forever!" I shouted to myself.

DING-A-LING!

Once again, I heard a ring at my door.

"Who the hell is that again?!" I thought, as I walked toward the door. My security personnel should’ve been guarding the gate; no one should have been able to reach the door to ring the bell except for my security personnel himself. And he shouldn’t have to, as he also has the key to the door.

When I opened the door, I saw a man standing behind it with his back against me. As the man turned around to face me, I immediately saw the face I recognize. The face I would never expect to ever see again.

The face of the salesman of life.

The man I had just killed and buried in my backyard a few minutes ago.

"WHAT THE FUCK?! NO! NO WAY! NO WAY! NOOO!!" I screamed in horror, collapsing to the floor and instinctively crawled my ass back inside. My jaw dropped, and my eyes widened in terror.

“Good evening, my good sir,” he greeted me with a strange and creepy smile on his face.

"It… It can’t be… I… I… I just… I just…," I stuttered, pointing shakily at him and then toward the backyard.

“You just killed me. Yes. Correct,” he responded, with a creepy smile still on his face as if nothing had happened.

“You ARE SUPPOSE to be there!” I yelled in horror, pointing my finger again at my backyard. “I am, sir,” he said, “I am.” He paused for a moment before continuing. “But there are thousands of me. Scattered around the globe. Selling life. There’s no point in trying to kill me, because I’ll send another me to continue where the job left off.”

“I am here, sir, just to inform you about the procedure,” the salesman began explaining himself. Something he hadn’t had the chance to do earlier because I struck him dead before he even could speak.

“Our system is mostly automated, however it needs to be triggered by the final statement being disclosed. If you really had to kill me again, sir, I will have to send three guys back here. All of them, of course, being myself, in which the two would pin you down on the floor while the last one discloses the statement. So, please, don’t make this difficult for either of us, as killing me, no matter how many times, is pointless. Do I make myself clear?”

The salesman stared at me in silence for a few seconds that felt like a week.

I didn’t say a word.

“I take that as a ‘yes,’” he said.

“So, sir,” the salesman continued his explanation, “there are two ways this may go. And since you already tried to kill me once, I assumed you refuse to return to your original life. I am deeply apologize, sir, but you can’t just get away with killing the salesman. If you think I’ll just revoke you life, and that’s it. You’re mistaken. If you think the punishment would be for me to kill you in return… Again, sir, you’re also mistaken. That would also be considered as ‘getting away with murder.’ That’s not gonna happen.”

“What would happen to me then?” I asked, out of curiosity, shivering from head to toe.

"As I mentioned when I first paid you a visit, sir, you can return the life you took during the 30-day trial for free, without any payment," the salesman began speaking. "Unless, of course, you killed the salesman who offered you that life. In that case, your original life, the entire life you were born into, becomes the payment."

"The price for such an act is that we will take away your life—the new life, that was in trial version, as well as the life you’re born into. Then, we will thrust you into another existence much worse than the one you had before," he explained. "By 'worse,' it could mean anything, for instance, a helpless existence where a terrible accident had happened to you and left your entire body paralyzed. The life where you’re confined to a hospital bed, unable to do anything but sleep and regret everything you've done. For the rest of your life. That you and I wouldn’t know for how long," the salesman continued his unsettling explanation.

I couldn’t imagine the life he had just explained to me to be actually happening. It was extremely horrifying to even think of.

“That’s… That’s horrible,” I muttered, “Is there… Is there anything I can do… To… To… Change this… Whatever that means…”

“I am deeply apologize, sir,” the salesman responded, “but, no.”

“The version of life I explained to you, sir, was just an example. It could be any other way. Could be worse. Can’t be better— not even slightly.”

“You have a chance to keep this version of life you have right now, though,” the salesman said again. What I just heard coming out from his mouth was something I would never expect, considering that I had killed him once.

“I have? For real?”

“Yes, sir. The downgrade of your life started when you wake up from your first sleep after hearing the statement. As long as you remain awake from this moment onward, this life you have right now, will remain yours.”

“OH! FUCK YOU! AND YOU EXPECT ME TO STAY AWAKE FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS??”

The salesman laughed uncontrollably.

“You can try, sir,” he said while trying to hold his laughter. “You can try.”

“You’re not our first customer who tried to kill the salesman. It should come to no surprise to you,” the salesman spoke again, tidying up his suit and tie as he blurted out word by word. The longest our previous customer tried to hold off their sleep is a month.”

“Well, 28 days,” he corrected himself.

“Let us all see if you can break the record and outlive our record-breaker customer.” Once again, I heard the salesman laughing maniacally as he started to turn his back against me and walked toward the door. That time, I wasn’t just hearing the sound of laughter of a one man. I felt like I heard the sound of countless of people laughing around me.

It felt like I was being mocked and laughed at by countless of invisible people.

The second that strange and creepy salesman of life walked three steps away from where he originally stood, I started seeing him fading and then vanished into thin air.

I was left trembling.

Now, it has been one and a half weeks without sleep for me since the final statement from the salesman of life, and I can’t stand it anymore.

I feel myself dozing off…

I could fall asleep any second now…
