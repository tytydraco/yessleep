I'm not here to create drama or seek attention. My story is painfully real, and what I'm going through is something I never imagined. It all started abruptly and brutally: my father and brother died in a car accident, my wife left me and took my children, and all my friends distanced themselves from me. I tried to reconnect with my children, but my ex-wife won't allow it. Her new husband doesn't want them to have any contact with me. I went to court to resolve this situation, but the waiting time is six months.

During this time, I tried to follow all the advice on self-love and self-awareness. I started new hobbies, watched all the series on my list, learned to cook, and created a routine to keep myself busy. But none of this diminishes the fact that we are social beings and need human contact to survive.

The silence in my house is almost deafening. Each room seems to echo the absence of the voices that once filled the space. At night, the hallways turn into long tunnels of darkness, where shadows dance in the flickering light of the lamps. There are moments when I almost feel the presence of my family beside me, but when I reach out, all I find is emptiness.

At first, the changes were subtle. A door I was sure I had closed was open when I returned home. I thought it was just my mind playing tricks on me. But then, I started noticing more things. Objects moved without explanation. One day, the TV remote was in the kitchen, although I clearly remembered leaving it in the living room.

As the weeks went by, the occurrences became more frequent. I heard whispers at night, indistinct words coming from the dark hallway. I stayed up late, trying to discern if they were real or a product of my exhausted imagination. The whispers became clearer but always unintelligible, carrying a sense of urgency and despair.

My dreams became disturbing. I saw my family, but they were distant, as if an invisible barrier separated us. I woke up in a cold sweat, feeling that something was watching me from the corner of the room. I started avoiding mirrors because I was scared of my own reflection. It seemed like there was something else in the mirrors, a shadow that moved independently of me.

I tried to maintain my routine, but the feeling of being watched never left me. In the kitchen, while chopping vegetables, I felt a chill run up my spine. I looked around but saw nothing. However, the knife in my hand felt heavier, as if it carried a silent threat.

One night, while trying to sleep, I felt a presence at the foot of my bed. My heart raced, and a cold sweat ran down my forehead. I slowly opened my eyes, and in the dim light, I saw a tall, indistinct shadow. I couldn't move a muscle. The shadow seemed to lean over me, and a feeling of absolute terror took over my being. I tried to scream, but no sound came from my throat.

When the morning light finally entered through the window, the shadow disappeared, leaving me exhausted and questioning my own sanity. Am I going insane? Or is there something darker, something that feeds on my loneliness and despair?

The constant terror began to affect my perception of reality. Gradually, everyone turned into those indistinct shadows from my nightmares. In the supermarket, the cashiers were shadows. At the bank, the tellers were shadows. My mind was crumbling, unable to distinguish between reality and illusion.

The shadows began to multiply. At first, they were just distant presences, something I could ignore if I concentrated hard enough. But then, they started to get closer, becoming more persistent. Every time I left the house, I felt their empty gazes following me, their indistinct forms moving at the edges of my vision.

One afternoon, while trying to shop, I realized that all the people around me had transformed. Their faces were black blurs, their bodies walking shadows. I felt an overwhelming panic consume me. I let go of the shopping cart and ran to the exit, my heart pounding in my chest. The shadows followed me, whispering unintelligible things, filling my ears with a terrifying buzz.

I arrived home trembling, my hands barely able to turn the key in the lock. I closed all the windows and locked the doors, trying to create a barrier between me and those entities. But they didn't stop. Soft knocks on the gate and continuous whispers kept tormenting me. There was no rest, not even a moment of peace.

Days blended into nights. Sleep was a distant illusion, interrupted by nightmares and the constant feeling of being watched. Every time I looked out the window, the shadows were there, surrounding my house, a constant and threatening presence.

One night, I was awakened by a different sound. Someone was knocking insistently on the gate. Feeling a cold chill in my chest, I slowly got up and went to the door. There it was, the same indistinct shadow that haunted me in my dreams and nightmares. This time, however, it was closer, more real. Its words were a whirlwind of disconnected sounds, each syllable piercing my mind like a needle.

I slammed the door shut, trying to block out the sound and sight of that thing. But the feeling of despair only increased. I looked out the window and saw that the entire street was full of these creatures. They moved slowly, as if looking for somethingâ€”or someone. Every time one of them saw me, I quickly closed the curtains, trying to hide from those oppressive presences.

Isolation consumed me. I started avoiding contact with the outside world, fearing what I would find out there. Reality and nightmare intertwined in a way that I could no longer distinguish one from the other. Were those shadows real, or was my mind playing a cruel trick on me? The doubt gnawed at my sanity.

Today, the shadows invaded my house. They knocked on the windows, forced the doors. I hid in the bathroom, locking the door and curling up in the farthest corner. My phone was in my pocket, and that's when I decided to write this. Maybe it's my last attempt to reach someone, to make them understand the psychological horror I'm going through.

I no longer know what is real. I only know that loneliness and despair have opened the door to something indescribable, something that has trapped me in a never-ending nightmare. I hear the shadows approaching, their whispers growing louder. If anyone is reading this, know that isolation can be a terrible prison, and there are things in the shadows that none of us understand. Now, all I can do is wait and write, hoping that someone, somewhere, understands my cry of despair.
