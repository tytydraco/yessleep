# Oct. 3rd, 1964

Morning has been rough for me, utterly. Truthfully, a part of me fears that the vision I spoke of earlier might indeed have been a product of restlessness affecting my mind. I've asked around to see if anyone perhaps brought any sort of sleeping medications, to which they all replied they hadn't. Such things were prohibited, something I was admittedly unaware of, but at the same time wasn't altogether unexpectant of. Perhaps I was right then about how extensive the pre-screening process was for the others.

I also took the liberty of asking Ambrose if he'd ever heard of the strange growled phrases and/or perhaps knew their meaning or what dialect it was even in -- as well as if it were even *human*. A bit to my surprise, he claimed he actually *had* heard of the phrase before, though couldn't say as to the dialect it was or it's translation to any familiar language, other than his speculation that some part of the phrase meant "Rebirth". When he asked me why I was questioning such a thing, after brief hesitation, I told him of my earlier vision.

The look he gave me still perplexes me to a degree. It was a look that dictated that, while he may not have known what it was I was speaking of, he wasn't entirely disregarding it either. Though I believe him when he told me otherwise, I still wonder if he, or perhaps another, either from the Tri-Nexus crew themselves or from the expedition crew, may have some kind of research on the phrases, the people in the vision, or the obelisk itself. If so, it's a matter I hesitate to press too hard upon with them.

In any event, I fear this is something that won't go away until more definitive answers are found. I only hope it doesn't cost me as severely as the poor bastard on the plane.

Another vision came to me last night. This one was of a tall, imposing pharaoh standing atop the largest pyramid as subjects gathered at the base of it all knelt in reverence and called out to him. Again, the phrase was uttered, though this time mixed with several other phrases. All of it was in that same growling dialect.

**"Addish Forlaac Aoudin! Tangor Kaos Eelik Khaa! Adrayok melioss!"**

Following this, I heard the pharaoh himself call out in a voice so thunderously deep that I knew couldn't have been human,

**"Urall Khaa! Adrayok Ralik Ga'an, tosh Jehovak! Adrayok melioss!"**

For reasons all unclear to me, hearing these words once more triggered something inside of me, something innate. Primal. Ancestral perhaps even...

What was more was when I watched the congregation then turn to one another before brutalizing one another viciously. Using staves, chisels, hammers, and soon even their own nails and teeth, I watched them tear each other to shreds. What suddenly provoked them to such savagery and/or what purpose it was meant to serve is something I hesitate to think of. I can only infer that it had something to do with the mysterious pharaoh's speech.

I didn't get to see if there were any survivors to the brutality. I was shaken awake by Mr. Benson and two of the other Tri-Nexus representatives. Evidently this vision had an unconscious effect on my physical body as I was revealed to have been thrashing about wildly as well as caused minor injury to one of the other expedition members by allegedly striking them in the face. Following this, I was forced to isolate from the other members by switching vehicles in our convoy to one that wasn't as populated with others. Benson informed me that, in the next week or so, we should be arriving at the site. Somewhere along the way, however, he will require that I undergo another screening exam.

In truth, despite what I'd said earlier, I'm not sure if I *want* to pass this second examination or not. Ever since that particular vision, I can't shake away the feeling that this expedition is seeking something that was perhaps lost to time for a distinct reason.

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

# Oct. 7th, 1964

We've stopped in another city for the night. I'm told that it should only be another two to three days, God willing, before we reach the site. For the reasons mentioned before, I was isolated to a room of my own at the hotel we've stopped at for the night. I believe my second examination is tomorrow.

Though I haven't had any further visions or episodes -- yet -- I can't stop hearing certain parts of the phrases uttered from the last dream repeat in the back of my mind.

**"Adrayok Khaa! Adrayok Khaa!"**

Over and over, both in the collective applauds of the congregation of the hooded disciples gathered at the pyramid's base, as well as the thunderous echo of the shadowed pharaoh at its peak. Unable to stand the mystery for long, I found an opportunity to question Ambrose again if he may know at least what *these* two phrases meant. His guess was about as scarce as before, though he did speculate that the phrase "*Khaa*" may be in reference to the ancient Kemetic term "*Ka"*, referring to one's spirit. To a degree, I suppose this could make sense, though that still leaves the question of exactly *who's* spirit?

At this time, I can only guess that the particular vision I witnessed was of some sort of ritualistic sabbath. The only problem with this conclusion is that I can't tell exactly what civilization it is, one whose religious practices apparently involve genocide. While I'm aware certain middle eastern cultures of the time practiced human sacrifice rituals, somehow I felt this was something different altogether. Something perhaps as a means of judgement, akin to the biblical rapture perhaps.

I think I should mention that this matter isn't necessarily one I feel comfortable dwelling on, but rather one I can't force myself to cease thinking of. For now, the last thing I'll say is that this pharaoh, perched atop the pyramid, is no mortal being. Somehow, through whatever means it has at its command, this pharaoh had the capability to bend the minds of men to its will, seemingly effortlessly.

\*\*\*

# Oct 8th, 1964

I was screened again by Mr. Benson and two of the others again an hour ago. To put it plainly, I've convinced them of my mental stability, at least for the time being. They asked me again if I'd had any history, either personal or familial, with mental illness or sleep abnormalities, both of which I replied that I hadn't. I explained to them that the incident from the convoy was only an isolated incident, one that I was certain was unlikely to happen again.

Truthfully, I said this more as a comfort to myself than anything else. God only knows now whether it'll remain true. More and more, though, I get the sickening feeling that what I'd witnessed was only the beginning of a far larger, far more gruesome, and far more haunting puzzle. Regardless, they found this answer more or less satisfactory and cleared me to continue the journey.

We've hit the road again now. According to Benson, at our current pace, we may be able to arrive by nightfall tomorrow so long as we continue moving through the rest of the day today and tomorrow. I've debated having the gumption to ask him about the obelisk and what its value was, and yet I've thought better of it. Regardless of the fact that I'd just barely managed to convince him to let me continue with the rest of the expedition crew, I also realize that I'm still not entirely sure that really is what he's after here. What's the use of stirring a hornet's nest without at least a concrete purpose for doing so?

That said, that hasn't kept me from wanting to look into this obelisk myself. For the time being, I've asked to borrow a few of Ambrose's textbooks of ancient kemetic culture. Being that he was the one to suggest it to me in the first place, it stood to reason for me that, for now, he'd be my most reliable source to learn more of it. Despite so far finding nothing suggestive of the subject, I figured he had to have learned about the obelisk *somewhere*, yes?

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

# Oct. 9th, 1964

We arrived at the site just before the sun began to set. The site itself is remarkable, I must say, despite not having been in any sort of condition, mentally or physically, to marvel at it like the others had. I was exhausted, therefore electing to make for the pre-prepared shelters designated to the expedition crew.

The others weren't far behind with this. Due to being cleared through the psych evaluation, I was once again designated to bunk with Ambrose. I also decided against joining the others for chow. I wasn't hungry, plus I was by that point far too engrossed in Ambrose's textbook, still trying to find *any* mention of the obelisk or of the peoples I saw in the visions.

I have yet to find either, however. It's late and I think exhaustion alone may force my body asleep any second now. If so, my hope is that my mind is able to rest as well.

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

# Oct. 10th, 1964

My wish was almost granted. My sleep had been restful for at least a few hours, perhaps the most peaceful hours I'd experienced since leaving Saigon. No visions or sounds plagued me.

Then, however, I began to hear the shadowed pharaoh's thunderous voice again. As before, the two words repeated themselves.

**"Adrayok Khaa! Adrayok Khaa! Adrayok Khaa!"**

No scenery or hallucinations accompanied this. No, it was merely the voice, the booming, unknown tongue of the pharaoh. It was then that I noticed, too, that the repetition of the words occurred at a rhythm, a cadence almost. They seemed to pause in between each utterance.

**"Adrayok. Khaa."**

**"Adrayok. Khaa."**

**"Adrayok. Khaa."**

The closer I listened, the less it sounded to me as an invocation or incantation, but rather as... as... Well, perhaps as a *heartbeat*. A lone palpitation, a fierce, yet steady rhythm. It's perhaps the closest to hearing the heartbeat of the Earth and of the cosmos itself. It was amazing. It was cerebral.

*It terrified me!*

So much power, it seemed, carried by a single rhythm, as conveyed through those two single words.

**"Adrayok Khaa!"**

This afternoon was largely spent examining once more at the site itself. The site comprised of three pyramids, two of which were smaller in height, though considerably wider at the bases. These beset the tallest one in the center. This one was estimated by Benson himself to stand at least 50 to perhaps 60 feet tall, jutting to the sky as a spear to penetrate the bounds to heaven.

Obviously, I was considerably less enthralled by the sight of this marvel and more so anxious because if it, the realization of its resemblance to the same pyramid found in my visions. I remember looking up at its peak, half expecting the shadowed pharaoh himself to be looming over us, declaring his alien sermon in his frightening dialect. It was all I could do to not begin losing myself then in front of the rest of the expedition.

Much discussion was made as to exactly what we were supposed to do. This is when I finally broke the question of the expedition's purpose to Benson, to which he replied that the purpose laid within this terrifying pyramid. Some ancient artifact, he claimed, which was interred somewhere deep within its recesses, perhaps even entombed with the pharaoh within.

What this so-called "treasure" is, or what its value is to them or to anyone for that matter, he wouldn't say. I didn't push him, either, still holding to the delusion that I was overreacting. That this pyramid *wasn't* the same as what I'd seen before and that the hallucinations themselves were just that; hallucinations, perhaps spurred by a troubled and stressed mind. Such as mine is.

As much as I told myself this, I can't help but counter the optimism with the sense that reality is far darker than this. That I'm convincing myself of an illusion of safety.

The only sort of comfort I had today was the illusion of Pvt. Elroy's face looking down from Heaven and smiling that I'd pursued this journey, the journey of uncovering man's lost secrets. I fear, though, even this will soon lose its appeal to me.

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

# Oct 11th, 1964

I'm writing this now, having been involved in an intensive deliberation session on how to enter the pyramid itself. Benson and the others seek to breach through the pyramid through drilling beneath it. The question has been brought up of if such action would even be permissible by the Egyptian government, to which Benson assured that we needn't worry about any such repercussions from them. Of this, I am admittedly skeptical.

The plan as of now is to have a commercial drilling crew, comprised apparently of underpaid construction crew begin drilling an underground tunnel by first light tomorrow morning. With luck, Benson claimed, we should have a viable tunnel entrance in only another week's time, at which point, we'll be able to enter through and seek out this apparent tapestry, this obelisk. All I can say to this is, I feel sorry, both for the construction crew Benson seeks to swindle into this operation and, to perhaps a lesser degree, for the rest of us on the expedition crew, having already, I fear, been swindled by him into something truly frightening.

The longer I look at this accursed pyramid, it seems, the louder and the more pronounced I can hear the phrase repeat in my head. The more I hear it, the farther my mind reaches to figure out its significance and meaning. The only question is, who can I ask that would have such an answer?

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

# Oct 13th, 1964

Like clockwork, the drilling crew arrived at dawn yesterday morning and commenced drilling. That was how I was woken up, though I had already faced trouble yet again sleeping. The crew itself consisted of about 12 to 15 men, all worn and exhausted Egyptians who I can tell have essentially broken themselves in two to three different ways for most, if not all, their lives simply to make money to get by in a day to day basis. I can only imagine, and hope, that Benson promised them a handsome compensation for this effort. Should this not be the case however, I may not be entirely surprised.

More and more, I've come to hold a certain distrust for Ronald Benson. From even the beginning, in the meeting back in Vietnam, he never ceased to hold information from myself and others. Information that he and I would both know was important to share among the rest of us. I may not know what it is and/or his purpose for evading questioning of it, but I know that it could likely affect the outcome of this venture. Not only this, but I'm beginning to wonder if he, too, is experiencing certain visions as what I've described as well.

Yes, I'd almost be willing to bet on it. For one thing, I've begun to notice signs of fatigue on his own face that remind me much of the young man from the plane. For another, how and why else, when so much information on this supposed obelisk seems so sparse -- bordering on nonexistent -- could he even know about it? More than this, there remains the question of exactly what the hell his purpose for finding it is in the first place?

As much as I want to press this with him, I know that wouldn't be wise. Even if I thought there'd be a chance he'd give me an honest answer to this question, I fear he'd have me removed from the project, perhaps as a method of silencing me. Thinking about this, though, I can't help but worry again about my purpose exactly for even being here. If such things as my silence would be of concern to him, then why did he adamantly insist that I join this expedition in the first place?

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

# Oct 16th, 1964

Word has it that the drilling crew has breached the halfway point into the tomb beneath the pyramid. Another three days, according to Benson, and we should be able to enter. The man has had these poor souls working day and night. I've come to one conclusion; liar or not, Ronald Benson is truly a blunt, shrewd, and frankly loathsome man in my eyes.

In one of the very seldom occasions I saw any of them given a break period, typically during the day only and for no longer than two hours, I took it upon myself to ask one of them, a middle aged Egyptian by the name of Rashaad Emahl, what he may or may not know about what lays within the tomb. His reaction at first was one I recognized as fear, anxiety, as though I'd asked him the name of an ancient evil. When finally he did speak, he informed me that no man has ever truly known what laid within this particular tomb.

According to Emahl, this pyramid had been one reputed to be even spoken of "Only by infidels, fools, and traitors", as he put it. I attempted to push for further explanation, but found myself quickly losing his favor. I remember he told me that the lord of this tomb was a vile, savage retch that delighted in the spilling of blood in his name. I once more foolishly asked Emahl for the name of this infamous pharaoh, for which I was again denied an answer, this time resulting in his insistence that our conversation end then and there.

The last thing I can remember Emahl saying to me is "I pray only that your God can protect you from the might of him within. Others long ago were never as fortunate. If any of you had any sense of reason or any sense of the preservation of life itself, you will go back to your little shelter and kneel beside your bed and then pray that the sense comes to you and the rest to leave this accursed place."

Dramatic as I found this statement to be, it's one I cannot seem to write off as sheer paranoia. Perhaps because much of what he told me appears to correlate hauntingly well with what I've told of thus far. Already, I was sure this was the towering pyramid from the vision and now, I'm certain that it serves as the resting place of that long deceased pharaoh. And above all, I now know that the very sand I stand upon is stained by the blood of an entire civilization that enacted a brutal genocide upon themselves simply in the pharaoh's name!

It was yesterday when I spoke to Emahl. Since then, sleep has been an almost scientific impossibility for me. Though I've experienced no further visions as before as of yet, I still sometimes hear, in the farthest recesses of my mind, the screams of millions as they fall one by one, mutilated, to spill their carnage into the sand beneath them and behind this, in his infamously thunderous voice, the pharaoh repeats his declaration.

**"Adrayok Khaa!"**

\*\*\*

# Oct 17th, 1964

Another vision came to me this afternoon. It was just after I'd eaten lunch that I saw it. This, however was something different altogether from the ones from before. These visions didn't take place within the pyramids. As a matter of fact, they weren't of Earth at all.

What world, or rather planetoid, this particular scene took place on, I can't for the life of me say. It was a dingy, gray, lifeless looking place with bricked monuments that looked to blend renaissance styled structures with that of a more Arabesque tone. It reminded me a bit of the fabled buildings told in the fabled "*Arabian Nights"*; Large, imposing structures that curve outward toward their peaks. At their peaks were raised long needlelike spires that attempted to stab at the vast outer dark itself.

I wondered at first who could've built such magnificent structures, structures that would have made even the most talented of artists, architects, and visionaries sick with envy. Then, gathered at what I inferred to be either a village square or perhaps the center of the planetoid itself, were strange beings that, at the same time, immediately filled me to the brim with fright and disgust. Long, albino, writhing figures they were, each of them impossibly slender, clad in long robes as depressingly lifeless in color as the actual terrain they stood on.

I saw how they appeared to gather at predestined points around a large hole at the center. Eight of them stood around a ninth one, which stood next to the devouring pit in the center. Something of note with this, ironically enough, I suppose, despite the fact that I've remarked how depressing the terrain is, I saw that there were three suns that would orbit this world. Each of them were of varying color and cast a different aura over the land. It was when the second sun, the violet one, had reached its peak height, that I watched the figures gathered around the crater raise their arms.

I hesitate to call them arms, though, as they were more like tendrils. Like the rest of their oblong shaped  bodies, their "arms" swayed and writhed in the air. I caught a brief closer glimpse of one of the being's appendages, where I was horrified to see that, on each of them -- of which each being had at least five -- they all bore a long, elongated mouth! While the other eight stood with their appendages raised, the one in the center next to the hole began slithering out of its robe. Then, from everywhere, I heard what I can only describe to be the most ear splitting, most gut wrenching, and single most painful collection of high pitched shrieks ever conceivable as the being in the center then cast himself into the hole in the center.

It was after this that I came back to reality, albeit dazed and scarred horribly. It was so nerve racking for me that I was forced to immediately vomit in the sand where I stood. Fortunately, I was alone so no one would ask any questions. Unfortunately, however, I became very lightheaded and my head pounds miserably, even now. What's worse is that, as I write this right now, laying ill in my bed, I still can't stop hearing their shrieks, ringing in the far corners of my ears.

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

# Oct. 19th, 1964

My headache has only minimally subsided since yesterday. At least the sound no longer sounds in my ears. The headache alone was enough to cause me to lose the entire night's sleep. Like that has been anything new, though, the insomnia is beginning to worry me majorly.

Though I am becoming more and more certain that what I'm seeing is more than just a dream, there's still a part of me, a reasonable sense within me, that still holds doubts. It could stand to reason that the lack of sleep is affecting me more and more each day, however, at the same time, how can I be sure it really *is* merely the product of insomnia? How can I be certain that it's an effect of restlessness and not the cause itself?

After all, had not the man on the plane seen similar, if not the *same* hallucinations I've been? And aside from this, if these visions *were* only phantasm, then what caused Emahl such fright to even speak of or be in the presence of this pyramid? All of this has led me each time back to one central question, what is this obelisk and what is its purpose to Benson?

Speaking of Benson, I must note how much more noticeable the signs of fatigue are on his face as of late. How irritable he's become as well. I saw just yesterday how, for simply asking for a brief intermission from the day's drilling (having been working for 12 straight hours on that day alone, mind you), he all but ripped the poor bastard's head off, claiming that he was "daring to impede the excavation when we were so close to success." Whether suffering from hallucinations or suffering from swelled pride, I'm certain no good can come from any further unnecessary contact with him. I intend to avoid him as much as possible, being perfectly honest.

The last word from him to the rest of us expedition crew is that we'll have breached entry into the tomb by noon tomorrow. Then, we may all see what was lost to time, the horrible secrets that we've broken natural law to pursue, and God himself can only tell what price may be paid for doing so...

\----

Something has happened again. Rashaad Emahl was found murdered only minutes ago. The entire company is in an uproar!

There were no sounds or signals of any trouble before, plus I remembered seeing Emahl perfectly alive and well only an hour or so before he was found! What could have happened? Who could've done it and why? All of these are questions that are currently being passed around the camp, none of which anyone has a real viable explanation for. I, however have a different question of my own, one that strangely seems to have passed right over the heads of the others, where is Ronald Benson?

He wasn't there when Emahl's body was discovered, nor has he been seen since. The others, likely due to the shock of the situation itself, haven't seemed to notice this. The thing that bothers me most about his absence, though, is the fact that the last time I saw Emahl working on the tunnel, he was there, eyeing him with a noticeable anxiety. It was a crazed, almost rabid look in his eye, as though he thought that the tunnel's progress was his life dependency.

I say all of this to say that my primary question has only one feasible conclusion, one that I only pray isn't true; Ronald Benson has graduated from a shrewd and lying scoundrel to a full-fledged *murderer!*

I have not shared this conclusion with anyone else as of yet. For starters, there's no way yet to prove that, and secondly, if it *was* him, it's highly likely his associates may make an attempt on my life to silence me, should they be in on his scheme. As that stands, I already don't feel safe any longer setting foot outside the quarters. As well as this, I've resolved to make sure that my bowie knife from back in Saigon is within quick reach.

I will say, to their credit, the other Tri-Nexus staff appear to be equally shocked at the discovery of Emahl as any of the rest of us. I wonder then if *they* actually know that Benson is missing as well. If not, then I can only wonder what's going through his mind that's made him go rogue like this. In any event, I am thoroughly afraid now.

\*\*\*

# Oct 20th, 1964

All through the night, all of us of the expedition crew were ordered to remain inside of the quarters while the digging crew was ordered to remain for questioning. For over an hour, this lockdown was in effect. Afterwards, word was released that the expedition crew was to report outside for an announcement. When we all came out, two of Benson's advisors announced that each of us would undergo questioning, both to the possible events of Emahl's murder as well as the whereabouts of Benson himself.

We were all then isolated by different Tri-Nexus advisors and interrogated. I told them the truth as I understood it, that I had seen Emahl working only a short time before he was found, and that Benson was supervising him at the time. Obviously I kept my suspicions to myself. It wasn't long, maybe only three or four minutes, before I was cleared of suspicion. Others took even less time.

Once this was finished, it was declared by one of the advisors that, in spite of the panic last night, which had halted the progress of the dig, the tunnel had mysteriously been finished and breached into the catacombs within. Immediately, the dots connected in my head. Benson, having lost himself to whatever ambition that drove him to seek this treasure, this obelisk, murdered Emahl in cold blood before completing the dig himself. Realizing this, I spoke up.

Noting that I'd told them about seeing Benson at the dig site earlier, I told them that it was likely that Benson was now inside the tomb himself. This was met initially with skepticism from the other members of the expedition crew, but I could see validity from the advisors. For a moment, everything was silent as the three advisors quietly discussed among themselves. In this moment, I remember looking up to the pyramid again, again picturing the pharaoh lording from its peak and the carcasses littering the ground around.

Faintly, even now, I heard their screams echoing again, buried under his declaration.

**"Adrayok Khaa!"**

At this time, no official direction has been given yet. The advisors dismissed the rest of us once again before meeting to conference among themselves. This was all two hours ago. It's nearly 8:00 in the evening, and they've still delivered no news. I suspect that plans for a search and rescue attempt for Benson are being made. What method or personnel they'd utilize for any such thing out here, far removed from society and with no present personnel trained for that, is beyond me.

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

# Oct. 21st, 1964

We've been awakened and it's still early. The sun has only just begun to peak above the horizon. The advisor informed us to be ready in an hour. He wouldn't share as to why.

I've gotten dressed and am ready to go or do whatever it is they apparently have planned for us, however, I feel that this time should be spent writing here of the vision I experienced late last night. This time, I saw again the pyramid, with the crowd gathered at its base as before. This time, however, the crowd was different. Instead of the disciples and villagers that'd gathered before, there were an all new crowd of monks or druids, each of them clad in deep red cloaks that concealed their features entirely.

They stood for a moment amid the mess of gore that'd once been the congregation from before. All was quiet for a prolonged moment until I watched one of the monks overturn a few of the bodies to find, horrifyingly, that a small child had survived the massacre. The child, having evidently gone feral, was found gnawing on the shredded meat of one of the bodies. His eyes were pitch black, excreting some sort of ichor and growling like a wild dog. I saw the child look up to see the monk above him, drop his present morsel, and attempt to lunge for the monk, only to be caught and seized by the latter before being carried off.

With the child held firm, I watched the monks depart from the pyramid with the child screeching and howling madly. This time, I did not hear the voice of that horrible pharaoh, but instead, the heartbeat I spoke of before. A steady, omnipotent rhythm, beating forever and ever to the end of days. When the monks departed from the pyramid, the heartbeat quickened its pulse and I watched the sky begin to wash with a scarlet overcast. The ground started to rumble and I could see the landscape start to change, transforming into... into...

It sickens me to recall, but I saw the terrain transform into an undulating mass of *flesh!*

Everything, everywhere, all across the horizon, was all comprised now of living sinew. Pink, slimy and repulsive, the flesh soil reverberated seemingly in accordance with the omnipotent heartbeat. I then heard the voice again, the alien tongue of the pharaoh, declare,

**"Addish allok aoudin, Adikan Aoudin Adrayok! Adrayok melioss!"**

Beneath this, in hushed whispers from an unclear source, I heard these words,

***"What had begun with blood and flesh, so too shall it end, and be reborn in the image of flesh."***

Following this, I heard the collective wailing of the slain once more and the repetition of the phrase *"Adrayok Khaa"* while the flesh soil reformed itself into the familiar desert terrain. I was shaken awake from my trance once again by Ambrose, who had evidently found me in a trancelike state and believed I'd suffered a seizure. Since then, I've been doing my best to avoid both physical and visual contact with the pyramid itself. I don't know how much longer, though, that I can continue with this expedition. I fear now more than ever that I've been glimpsing things, secrets or omens, that I was never meant to, and may well cost me dearly.

\----

Dear God, they're actually doing it! They're going to have us -- *all* of us -- enter the pyramid! The advisors stated that we will have to act as a search and rescue party for Benson as they're unable to scrounge together a rescue team that'd make to the site in a timely manner. They further stated that this was part of the contractual clause that "Should an emergency arise, advisory procedures go into effect, including, but not limited to, aiding in any recue attempts for wounded or missing personnel."

This was something I'd never given much thought to when I signed, though, I likewise had no clue of how severe the situation would ever get. Who really could've been? Who would've thought, signing up for an expedition such as this, that the circumstances would ever become so bizarre? Well, I know I didn't, and I can see by their equally anxious faces that none of the others had either.

In any sense, expectant or not, *prepared* or not, we've been told that in an hour and a half, we'll be entering that blasted tomb in search for Benson. It would be a welcome miracle to find that Benson wasn't in the tomb after all, and that it *wasn't* he who murdered Emahl. Callous as it may be to say, though, a part of me honestly hopes he has met his fate within that tomb, whatever that may be.

\*\*\*
