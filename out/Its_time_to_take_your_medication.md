My resting body was lowered into the casket, rocking side to side due to the uneven weight spreaded across the soft mattress I was layed upon. Silent tears falling down the cheeks of my loved ones, lips quivering in disbelief.

I "passed away", quite painlessly. Heart attacks aren't that bad when you're brain shuts off throughout most of it. 

God I wish they saved me.

As the roof to my casket was sealed tight, the darkness engolfed me like a bath. While my body was completely lifeless, my... consciousness? Not sure, but it continued to live on. 

Nothing like the movies, I can't move from my body, it's been lying here for a while now.

Months, years?

Decades?

Time doesn't feel relevant to me anymore, I can see but it's so dark I only see a silhouette on my corpse. It's definitely rotten away by now, moulded into the caskets blood-coated blanket.

You may be asking, why am I warning you of this? There's no way to stop death, it is inevitable in the end.

Well, there is something here with me.


While I can't see it, I can hear it. It's a deep, hoarse voice, I don't know what it wants but I feel it keeps my soul alive with it. Each time I hear it, it will begin to beg for me to do inhumane acts, not that that matters to me as I'm not alive, but it doesn't sound like it's talking to ME.

It's almost like I can hear it talking to someone else, trying to tempt them into doing the things I hear, and I'm merely a spectator, only I can't view the movie.

Why do I feel it's keeping me here? Well, who... or what... is able to do this?

It's torture, I can still feel my body being fed on by maggots, each twitch, felt.

Every. Single. Moment. 

What else can I blame? Maybe my soul was a 50/50? Hell and Heaven are real? I went to neither.

The voice, it has a name. Voice. I don't understand why it told me it has a name, or who named it. I believe it to be some sort of... God? 

Nothing like the religious kind of God, more like an all powerful entity that has control and abuses it's privilege.

Constant. Pain. 

You may be asking, what are these "inhumane things" it asks me to do? Well, one was "You need to take your medication." Sounds like it is forcing someone to take intoxicants. Concerning.

Constant. Pain.

My vision is suddenly filled with florescent lights. As my vision adjusted, I came to see white padded walls, a small crooked steel table and a man in a trench coat.

Is this voice?

My heart began to pound again my ribcage, I backed away to the corner of the room, afraid of what it might do.

I began to choke on my own tears as I came to my senses and noticed that IT is a HE.

A human?

"It's time to take your medication."
