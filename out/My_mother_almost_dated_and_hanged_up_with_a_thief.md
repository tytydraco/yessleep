So we had a family of 3 it included my mom dad and me and we have a business that my father used to run and my mom used to deal with clients and etc. It was property related business. Fast-forward to 2023 due to illness my father passed away and my mother became the only person to run the business and I used to help her sometimes. As my father passed away I lived with my mom for some months but I was originally studying in another city so I went back there after some time. As my mother was only 43 years old when my father died it somewhat affected her life socially as it's not a very age to be a widow. So till April 2024 everything was fine but when I came home during my summer vacations my mom and I were having some general chat about my studies and my dating life etc. Our family I very much chill to such conversations so it's not a thing to worry about. My mom casually said to me that she too feels very lonely in her life these days. I replied to her in a very sarcastic manner that why don't you move on in your life and should make new friends and should date if you want to. She took this thing very seriously maybe because she was genuinely alone nd was craving for love. So after some days she came to me and asked me to help her in making her tinder/bumble etc dating profile. I firse asked her that is she serious about it and she said yes so I helped her the way she wanted.

So after some time ofc females get alot of matches easily she made some friends and after around some months she met them and everything was fine. My mom too moved on in her life and everything seemed fine. In September my mother was in club with her friends she was chilling then a man approached her. He had a very good physique and was very good in talking etc. He approached my mom and she's a quiet friendly person so soon they shared some drinks in club and exchanged their numbers. I knew this whole situation as my mom shared it to me at the same day it happened.

But the different thing that was happening was their friendship was growing much faster than the other friendships of my mom has ever got into. They used to roam around often and used to go on a date. By now he totally got aware about our financial conditions etc. So last December they both went on too a date and he dropped off my mom very late. It was around 11:30 pm so I opened the door of my house and let her in. After some 15-20 mins he called my mom and confessed her that he was feeling very lonely and he wants to spend the night with her. I was in my room and when he came he didn't knew that I was there in my room as my mom opened the door and she didn't told him about me as it could spoil some romantic things between them. But I knew he was coming as my mom told me earlier only.

After some time I noticed that there was a sudden silence in our house as ofc we all know two drunk lovers can never remain so silent after a date night. I didn't thought so much and just let it go thinking that they might have slept. After some time I heard a strange banging from my mom's room out of the sudden. That was him trying to break into her closet which has money and jewellery. I rushed to her room and slightly peeped inside and I saw that my mom was lying on the bed and was sleeping like a child and he was vigorously slamming her closet. I straight outta called police calmly as the door was closed he wasn't able to listen to me. In about 10-15 minutes guards of our society arrived and after some time police too arrived and they caught him red handed until then he had robbed some cash but wasn't able to break the lock of the closet. Later we came to know that he mixed some anesthesia in her drinks as he had some good knowledge in pharmacy and drugs.

So the creepy thief Let's not meet ever again
