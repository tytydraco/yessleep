I’ve never told this story publicly. Not because I’m afraid people won’t believe me — I already know most won’t. But because the memory has faded over the years. Parts of it feel like fragments now, scattered and half-erased. And the pieces I do remember? They still scare the hell out of me.

But there’s one part I’ve never forgotten — not in the slightest. The two figures at the door with glowing red eyes.

I was 15 or 16 when it happened. My dad worked late nights, so most evenings it was just me and my mom at home. That night felt normal. We were hanging out, playing video games in the living room. Curtains drawn. Lights dimmed. I remember the way the screen lit up the room — just us, the game, and the hum of quiet comfort.

Then — knock, knock, knock.

Not aggressive. Just a sharp, solid knock. I paused the game, got up, and went to the door.

I looked through the peephole.

Nothing. No one.

I stood there for a few seconds, waiting, then figured it was someone at the wrong house or maybe a neighbor’s door I heard through the walls. I sat back down.

My mom had stepped into the kitchen — I think to check on dinner or maybe clean something up. And then — knock, knock, knock.

Same pattern. But louder this time. And then a voice, clear and firm:

“It’s the police. Please open the door.”

That stopped me cold.

I got up again, slower this time. Something felt off, but I couldn’t put my finger on it. I peeked through the peephole again.

That’s when I saw them.

Two figures standing on our porch. But they weren’t normal officers. In fact, they didn’t look human at all.

Their bodies were completely black — not clothing, not shadow, just blackness. Like voids. The porch light should have lit their faces, but it didn’t. There were no facial features. No eyes. No mouths. No badges. No shapes. Nothing.

Except for the glowing red eyes.

Two sets, staring straight ahead. Burning through the peephole like they knew I was there.

I felt something twist in my stomach. Panic. I backed away from the door and went to my mom.

“It’s the police,” I said. “But… something’s wrong.”

She came to the door, called out: “Hello? Who is it?”

And again — knock, knock, knock.

“It’s the police.”

Same voice. Same flat, unnatural tone. Like a recording. No emotion. No variation.

She looked through the peephole.

Her face drained instantly. Her expression shifted in a way I’d never seen before. She turned to me and whispered, “Get down. Now.”

I dropped to the floor.

“What do you want?” she called again, louder this time. Her voice was steady, but I could hear the tension under it.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

“The police. Please open the door.”

She pressed her body against the door and, as quietly as she could, turned the deadbolt and locked the bottom latch. Then she backed away, grabbed her phone, and started dialing.

Me? I couldn’t help myself. I peeked again.

They were closer.

Their glowing red eyes seemed even brighter now, like they were feeding off something. The porch light was gone — not broken, just gone. Replaced by blackness. It felt like they were right there, just a breath away.

I screamed.

My mom came rushing back, knife in hand, panic in her eyes. “Hide behind the couch,” she said. She was already on the phone with my dad, trying to explain. He didn’t believe her — thought she was overreacting, maybe dreaming. But he said he was on his way.

Then she dialed the actual police.

And that’s when the knocking got violent.

BANG. BANG. BANG.

“It’s the police. Please open up.”

She shouted, “Leave! I have a gun!”

She didn’t. Just the knife. And me? I grabbed one too, thinking I was being brave. She noticed and shoved it away, telling me to stay down.

It all gets hazy after that. I remember her looking again. Me trying not to cry. Then… nothing.

They were gone.

Just like that. No more knocking. No red eyes. No voices. Just silence.

Minutes later, my dad got home. He checked outside. No one. No footprints. No car. Just darkness.

The real police arrived a while later. We told them what happened. They said no officers were dispatched to our address. Nothing on record. No calls. No activity near our street at all.

To this day, we don’t know who — or what — those figures were.

All I know is this: I’ll never forget those eyes. And neither will my mom.

We don’t talk about it anymore. Not because we don’t believe it happened — but because we do.
