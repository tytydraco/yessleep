This event has no scary history. I didn't get this thing from some weird garage sale either. I bought the TV from a regular store. For God's sake, it was just sitting there on the shelf like any ordinary thing. It was also cheap. Nothing about its appearance gave the slightest clue as to what this thing really was.

My new TV shows programs and shows that shouldn't exist. Or at least, things I've never seen before on a regular TV.

When I brought him home in the afternoon, I spent some free time with him. It's like someone buying a new electronic item. Like connecting cables, checking if the firestick is working normally. But there was something that caught my eye.

You know, the Sources menu that every television has, where everything such as varia, AUX, USB, HDMI 1, HDMI 2 is listed. But in addition, there was a source that I had never heard of or seen before. 

This right was neither mentioned in the user manual nor shared anything about it on the internet. This resource was not named. It was simply called 5I on the television menu. 

The first time I clicked on the 5I option it took me to something that looked like a normal television broadcast. But this was no ordinary television broadcast. 

Yes, there were channels, but I'm not talking about channels like TNT or TLC. I don't think anything broadcast on 5I channels will be allowed to be broadcast on regular television. Let me explain.

&#x200B;

Channel 32. As soon as I hit 5I, something like a normal family comedy opened. By leaving the channel open, I was searching for this channel on Google, trying to understand that maybe it was a manufacturer's fault or something like that.

I was immersed in the phone when I suddenly heard something on the television that made me turn my attention back to the television. "Where the hell were you?". In the comedy that aired, a father sneaked into the kitchen and scolded a young boy. 

When his father said this, the audience in the studio laughed. The boy's top was a little messy. Probably came from a party. “Well, me,” the boy began, but his father cut him off. 

"I've been waiting for you all night. Where the hell were you?". The audience in the studio laughed again. "What the hell is this? What kind of show is this?" I put the phone aside, thinking to myself. The tall and bearded father took a step towards the boy. 

The boy instinctively took a step back. "A party," said the father, "were you at a party?" “Yes, Dad, I am,” he said, but at that moment the tall man slapped so hard that it made a loud noise. The boy fell to the ground, screaming in pain. 

The father angrily walked towards the boy. The studio audience laughed for the third time. "Sorry, please don't," said the boy, but his father continued to kick him stubbornly. At that moment, the scene changed to cheerful music.

The boy was lying on a sofa, bloodied and injured. A young girl, possibly the boy's sister, was sitting next to him. "You know you can't sneak out of the house like that," said the girl. "My father is angry about this". 

"It hurts a lot," said the boy. Tears were coming from his wounded eyes. The studio audience laughed again, and applauded. What the hell was I watching? 

At that moment, I sat down and watched that episode of the show to the end. 5 minutes before the end of the episode, everything had turned into a situation where the two brothers expressed their desire to escape from their father. 

With the sad confessions from the two characters and each sobbing cry, the studio audience was laughing again. The ending music started playing. It was happy and energetic music, like the soundtrack to a comedy show about a family that enjoys dangerous things, not a family that abuses itself.

Channel 61. It was a white-haired old woman who smiled brightly at the camera. Graphics and prices appeared on the screen, showing the phone number at the top and bottom of the screen, painting a perfect small portrait of capitalism. 

My wife would watch broadcasts like this one, admiring the jewelry we usually can't afford. But this was something different. Very badly different. In publications like this they often sell jewelry or clothing and use models to try on products. 

This channel did the same. But instead of wearing a necklace or dress, this mannequin wore a leather collar that was tied incredibly tightly around her neck. The old woman grabbed the end of the leash. "As you can see here, the leash is strong around the neck. 

It provides direct obedience to what you have. After all, nothing is more convincing than a ripped throat," she was saying and chuckling. "I see we have a buyer named Emily from Wisconsin. 

A very fast call, sir. We hope you enjoy your new killer collar," said the old woman. A woman over the speaker said: "Thanks Amy. I love the collar and can't wait to try it out". "Glad to hear that, honey. 

Yes, now we move on to our special offer for tonight." That old woman walked to the right and the cameras followed her. The camera showed a young woman chained to the floor and gagged with a metal block tied to her face. She was in her twenties.

She was a girl who wanted to scream out of fear but groaned because her mouth was gagged. She seemed like a nice girl, but she had been treated so cruelly and badly that it was impossible to tell to her face. 

"Our next offer will be a one-time offer. What you're getting is not just the product this time. We'll send you this young mannequin as well as your choice of models in a variety of colors and patterns. 

Call now and take advantage of this incredible offer." A number appeared on the screen. But this trick was not like the tricks we know. It consisted of strange symbols. Amy suddenly exclaimed, "Wow, that was fast. It's Ted from Brooklyn." 

A low, rustling voice came from the speaker: "She looks like my ex-girlfriend. I thought I could have some fun with her." At that time, two men dressed in black masks entered the camera angle, unchained the woman and took her away. 

Despite the thing in her mouth, the woman was yelling so loudly it was like it was right next to you. I was quite disturbed. I just changed the channel. 

Channel 104. This time, there was an advertisement for a fitness program. The before and after state of a woman who bought this exercise program called Puremotive was shown. She was quite overweight before. But in a few months she had lost about 80 kg. 

The woman in the pictures spoke to the camera for the interview: "This is the only method that works! If you want to lose weight fast, this is for you!" It was the same woman on the screen. She was running on the treadmill. 

His face was beet red. Behind the woman, a bandit-looking man holding a shotgun was looking at her without putting a cigarette in his mouth. Again, a before and after picture appeared on the screen. This time the person in the photo was an obese male. 

And yet another rogue-looking man standing behind him was pointing a revolver at the poor man. "This is the only way that works," said the man, trying to look happy.

Then came a montage with terrible recordings. Woman exercising and someone standing behind her all the time with snarling dogs. A group of people practicing jumping with men with rifles around. And finally, footage of an incredibly overweight man trying to do push-ups. 

The man was struggling. All of a sudden the man started to cry. A dreadful voice suddenly interrupted: "There's no room for laziness in puremotivation." The man could not resist gravity and fell face down. As she fell she started screaming in fear "No, no please don't". 

4 people wearing scary clothes entered the shooting area and started kicking the man hard. Although 30 seconds passed while watching the footage, it was as if 30 years had passed. They kicked the overweight man until blood gushed from his mouth and his teeth fell out. 

One person went out of sight, and came back with a large, sharp-looking machete. "No, please don't!" shouted the overweight man. The man with the machete slammed his machete on the overweight man's head, just like a medieval executioner. As soon as the machete reached its target, I changed the channel.

Channel 11. A new hamburger ad was airing in a restaurant that I hadn't heard of before. I soon realized that this hamburger was made from humans, especially human limbs. For dessert, they served human ears in a large bowl. When I changed the channel, both actors in the commercial were staring hungrily at their bowls and dipping their spoons.

&#x200B;

I kept changing channels even though I was terribly annoyed by all this stuff. My curiosity increased. Part of me said these things had zero probability of being real, and part of me said they were real. And if that was the case, what I experienced was literally experiencing the impossible.

&#x200B;

Channel 9. A rock concert was airing. The soloist shouted, "ARE YOU READY?" he had asked. Then he took a small switchblade from his pocket. The blade popped out of its slot with a single touch. And the soloist began to stab the knife in his face. And again, again, again, again. The crowd was all doing the same thing. Some with knives, some with shards of glass.

&#x200B;

Channel 88. It was a game show that used catapults to throw terrified people against a brick wall. It was appalling. I immediately changed the channel.

&#x200B;

Channel 202. I passed Channel 202 pretty quickly because I was so scared. There was a young woman in the middle of the room. And she was staring blankly at the camera. But it was as if he was looking directly at my soul, not at the camera.

&#x200B;

Channel 76. A wildlife documentary was broadcast on this channel. But none of the creatures shown were from this planet. Tall dogs were attacking a slug as big as a car. "As you can see, this useless creature has no chance now," said the man who voiced the documentary. But his voice was cut off by the terrible sound of these creatures. This sound bothered me a lot. I just changed the channel

&#x200B;

Channel 132. Another commercial. This ad was literally for a product that was just chocolate-covered human excrement. I had to run to the bathroom to throw up when I saw an actor happily taking a bite and sighing as if enjoying what he ate. 

I was gagging in the toilet bowl and throwing up at the same time. At that moment, I heard a voice from the TV "Hey!" I immediately ran into the living room. The ad was over. I was sure I hadn't touched the remote, but the TV was now showing Channel 345. 

This particular program had only one actor: Ben. Or at least a terrible copy of me that looks impossibly like me. My copy was in the room with the woman on channel 202. That woman was gone, and my copy was in her place. But my copy was crying. 

"Help me. Please help me." he said, and put a prickly black thing in his hand into his mouth. Sharp thorns had cut into my replica's lips, and you could see from his facial expression that his mouth was in that state, too.

&#x200B;

The channel changed itself again. Channel 5I. Suddenly I came across a broadcast of rotating colors. Blue, yellow, green, red. I couldn't feel anything. It was as if I had melted and my body was a cloud of color. The individual colors are left.

&#x200B;

Then I came across the room I saw on Channel 202 and Channel 345. My copy was still there. His face was covered in blood. But this time my copy wasn't alone. The woman I felt was looking into my soul was also there. 

Dozens of shattered men, women and children. "Watch with us!" The people on the screen were shouting in unison, as if it were part of a sermon, "Watch with us!" The tranquility of the colors gave way to fear. 

I immediately unplugged the power cord. Looking at the clock, I realized that it was almost five hours since I first turned on the TV. Those channels were the scariest things I've ever seen on a screen. 

At the same time, those colors were the most beautiful thing I've ever seen on a screen. I plugged in the power cord. But I didn't turn on the TV. I'm playing with the remote. Beautiful colors a few scary channels away. Watch with us huh? Actually, I thought maybe.
