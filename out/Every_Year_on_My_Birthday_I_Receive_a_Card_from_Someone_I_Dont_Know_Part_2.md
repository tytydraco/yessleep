I showed the desk officer the live video.

He didn’t interrupt me. He just watched the screen, jaw clenched, hands folded on the counter like he was bracing himself.

When it ended, he asked if this was live or a recording.

I handed him my phone and told him it was live and explained the situation as quickly as I could. They dispatched units immediately to my house.

They took me into a small interview room after that. No windows. Just a table, two chairs, and a faint humming sound I couldn’t place. A detective came in not long after, older, calm, the kind of guy who speaks slowly like he’s careful not to spook you.

I told him everything.

Not just what happened that night, but everything that led up to it. Every card. Every birthday. How long it had been going on. How I never told anyone because it always felt… harmless. Strange, sure. But harmless.

He asked why I hadn’t reported it sooner.

I told him my mother did once but nothing came of it. Other than that I didn’t have a good answer.

At some point it stopped feeling like something that happened to me and started feeling like something that had always just been there. Like background noise.

I remember sitting alone in that room, trying not to imagine someone walking through my front door.

When the detective came back, he closed the door behind him before he spoke.

“They didn’t find anything.” He said. “If it weren’t for that video it would be impossible to tell if anyone was there.”

No signs of forced entry. No disturbed ground outside. No footprints around the house, even near the door where the man had been standing. The officers checked the yard, the side of the house, the area near the fence line.

Nothing.

Inside, it was the same.

No fingerprints that didn’t belong there. No signs anyone had been inside recently. No evidence of tampering with the locks. 

One of the officers mentioned how clean it all was.

That word stuck with me.

Clean.

The detective told me that without anything physical to go on, there wasn’t much they could do right now. He said they’d file a report, keep it on record, and to call immediately if anything else happened.

I asked him if he thought I was in danger.

He paused longer than I liked before answering.

He said it was good I wasn’t going back to the house.

When I left the station, it was already getting light out.

I sat in my car for a minute before starting it, just breathing, letting the adrenaline burn itself out. That was when it really hit me that if I hadn’t checked my phone when I did… if I hadn’t seen the notification…

I called my girlfriend as soon as I pulled onto the road.

I told her everything. The video. The police. I didn’t try to downplay it this time. I told her exactly how scared I was.

She started crying before I finished.

I told her to stay where she was. She’d already gone to her parents’ place after I called her the night it happened. I told her not to come back to our place, not yet. I promised I’d explain everything again later, in person, somewhere safe.

Then I told her I was going to my mom’s house.

She asked me if I wanted her to come with me.

I told her no.

I didn’t want anyone else walking into whatever this was.

After I hung up, I tried calling my mom.

No answer.

I told myself she was asleep. It was early. Too early. I called again.

Still nothing.

I sent a text asking if she was home.

No response.

I don’t know how long I drove like that, one hand on the wheel, the other gripping my phone like it might start ringing if I held it hard enough. Every red light felt too long. Every car behind me felt too close.

Somewhere between the station and my mom’s house, it occurred to me that I hadn’t told the detectives everything.

Not because I was hiding anything.

But because there were things I’d never thought to question until people started asking.

I pulled into my mom’s driveway just as the sun was coming up.

Her car was there. Lights off. Curtains drawn.

I don’t remember knocking. I just remember standing on the porch, listening, suddenly aware of how quiet everything was. No TV. No footsteps. No movement inside.

I knocked again, harder this time.

After a few seconds, the door opened just enough for her to look out at me, eyes squinting like she was trying to place me somewhere she hadn’t expected.

She said my name before I could say hers.

The relief hit me all at once.

She asked what I was doing there so early. I told her I needed to come in. I told her something happened.

She stepped aside without asking questions.

She noticed my hands shaking before I did.

We sat at the kitchen table. She poured coffee I didn’t think I would touch. I told her about the man at the door. About the deliveries. About the key.

I expected surprise.

What I got was something else.

She didn’t interrupt me. She didn’t question me. She didn’t ask for details. She just listened, eyes fixed on the table, hands folded tightly in front of her.

When I finished, she let out a long breath, like she’d been holding it in for years.

She tried to remember when the first card arrived but couldn’t so she asked me.

I told her.

She nodded slowly.

She asked me if I’d ever thought about who it could be.

I told her what people were saying. About family. About my dad.

Her head snapped up at that.

She said his name quietly, like she didn’t want it to linger.

Then she said, “You know your father died before that, right?”

I told her I knew.

But the truth was, I’d never really thought about the timing.

He died when I was young. An accident. That’s all I ever remembered it being called. Something sudden. Something tragic. Something that happened and then stopped being talked about.

She confirmed it again, gently, like she was afraid I might argue.

He wasn’t around for my birthdays after that. He wasn’t sending cards. He wasn’t watching me grow up.

Whatever this was, it wasn’t him.

She reached across the table and took my hand. Her grip was tighter than usual.

She told me she didn’t think I should go back to the house yet.

I told her the detective had said the same thing.

That made her pause.

She asked what the police had said.

I told her everything they’d found.

Or rather, everything they hadn’t.

She went quiet again after that. Not panicked. Not emotional. Just… guarded.

I asked her if there was anything she wasn’t telling me.

She looked at me for a long time before answering.

She said no.

But she also said she didn’t think this was random.

I stayed at her place for a while. Long enough for the caffeine to kick in. Long enough for the adrenaline to wear off.

Eventually, reality crept back in.

I needed clothes. My work laptop. My charger. Things I hadn’t thought to grab when I left the house in the middle of the night.

My mom offered to come with me.

I told her I’d be fine.

I don’t know why I said that.

On the drive back, I kept thinking about the way the officers described the house.

Clean.

I parked down the block instead of in the driveway.

The house looked exactly the same as I’d left it. No lights on. No movement. No sign anyone had been there at all.

For a moment, I wondered if I’d imagined the whole thing.

I walked up the path, eyes scanning the yard, the porch, the door.

The welcome mat was slightly crooked.

I know that doesn’t sound like much.

But I always kept it straight.

I knelt down to fix it.

That’s when I saw what was underneath.

I stood there for a second, hand still on the edge of the welcome mat.

The house was quiet. No cars passing. No neighbors outside.

I crouched down and straightened the mat.

It resisted slightly.

That’s when I lifted it.

There was a folded piece of paper underneath, pressed flat against the concrete. It wasn’t damp. It wasn’t curled at the edges. It hadn’t been there long enough to collect dirt or moisture.

It had been placed.

My first thought was that the police had missed it, but that didn’t make sense. They’d stood on this porch. One of them had leaned against the door while the other checked the frame. If it had been there earlier, someone would’ve seen it.

Which meant it had been put there after.

I unfolded it just enough to see my name.

My phone rang.

The sound startled me so badly I nearly dropped both the note and the phone. I didn’t check the screen. I assumed it was my mom, or my girlfriend calling to ask if I’d made it inside okay.

I answered immediately.

“Hello?”

There was nothing on the other end.

No static. No background noise. Just an open line.

For a second, I thought the call had dropped.

I pulled the phone away from my ear and looked at the screen. The call was still connected but it was an unknown number.

I raised it back to my ear.

Still nothing.

Then he spoke.

“I see you found it.”

The voice was calm. Older. Male. Not rushed. Not excited. Like he’d waited until he knew I was listening.

I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t. My mouth felt dry, like it had been stuffed with cotton.

There was a pause after that, long enough to feel deliberate.

“You shouldn’t have involved anyone else” he said.

Not angry. Not threatening. Just… corrective. The way someone talks when you’ve made a mistake they expected you to know better than to make.

“That complicates things.”

My heart was pounding hard enough that I could feel it in my throat. I asked him who he was, but the words came out weak, like I wasn’t sure I was allowed to ask.

He didn’t answer.

Instead, he said, “You won’t do that again.”

It wasn’t framed as a warning. He didn’t raise his voice. He didn’t tell me what would happen if I did.

He said it the way someone states a fact they consider settled.

There was another pause.

I waited for him to say more. For an explanation. For anything that would make this make sense.

He didn’t.

The call ended.

No click. No dial tone. Just gone.

I stood there on the porch with my phone still pressed to my ear, staring at the note in my other hand, suddenly aware of how exposed I was. How long I’d been standing there. How easy it would’ve been for someone to watch me without being seen.

I didn’t read the rest of the note.

I didn’t go inside.

I got back in my car and drove.


That was days ago.

Since then, I haven’t gone back to the house. I’ve been bouncing between hotels, sleeping with the lights on, keeping my phone on silent unless I’m expecting a call. I’ve turned off anything that tracks my location. I haven’t told anyone where I am unless I absolutely had to.

I keep replaying the call in my head.

Not what he said.

But how certain he sounded.

I went to the police because I thought that’s what you’re supposed to do when someone crosses a line.

Now I’m not sure there ever was one.

That’s why I’m writing this now.

Because whatever this is didn’t end that night.

And I don’t think it’s ever been as far in the past as I convinced myself it was.
