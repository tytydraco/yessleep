It was a little past 11 PM when my phone rang. I wasn’t expecting any calls, but when I saw the caller ID, my stomach dropped. It was my younger brother, Danny. We hadn’t spoken in years—not since that night.

I hesitated, staring at his name flashing on the screen. My heart was racing. Finally, I answered.

“Hello?” My voice came out more anxious than I intended.

For a moment, there was nothing but static. Then, his voice came through, faint and trembling. “Mark… I need your help.”

I hadn’t heard that voice in so long, but it was unmistakably Danny. “Where are you? What’s going on?” I demanded.

“I messed up, Mark. I messed up bad,” he whispered.

A flood of memories rushed back. Danny had always been the reckless one, always getting into trouble. But this was different. There was something in his voice that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

“Where are you?” I repeated.

“I’m at the old house,” he said, his voice barely audible.

The old house. Our childhood home. The one we’d left after our parents died in that car crash. We hadn’t been back in over a decade. I swallowed hard. 

“Why are you there?” I asked, already dreading the answer.

“I needed to know, Mark. I needed to see if it was real,” Danny said, his voice cracking.

“What was real?” I asked, though a part of me already knew.

“The whispers,” he said. “The ones we used to hear at night. The ones Mom and Dad said weren’t real.”

I felt a cold chill creep down my spine. As kids, we used to hear strange noises in that house—whispers in the walls, like someone was talking just out of earshot. Our parents always told us it was our imagination, but Danny had never believed them. He was obsessed with finding out where the whispers came from.

“You shouldn’t have gone back there, Danny,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady.

“I know,” he said, his voice shaking. “But I had to. And now… now I can’t leave.”

“What do you mean you can’t leave?” I asked, panic rising in my chest.

“They won’t let me,” he whispered.

“Who won’t let you?” I demanded.

“The voices,” he said, barely audible. “They’re louder now, Mark. So much louder. They know I’m here. They’ve been waiting.”

“Get out of the house, Danny!” I shouted. “Just run, get out of there!”

“I tried,” he said, and the fear in his voice was palpable. “But every time I get to the door, I hear them… right behind me. If I turn around, they’ll be there. I know it.”

I didn’t know what to say. This wasn’t possible. Danny was losing it, but his fear was contagious. My heart was pounding in my chest.

“Just close your eyes and run,” I said. “Don’t look back, don’t listen to anything. Just run.”

There was a long pause. I could hear his shaky breathing on the other end.

“I’m scared, Mark,” he said finally. “What if they catch me?”

“They won’t,” I lied. “Just go. Now.”

I heard him take a deep breath. Then there was silence. 

“Danny? Are you there?” I asked, my voice trembling.

I heard a sound then, something like a door creaking open, followed by footsteps—soft, cautious footsteps. 

“I’m almost there,” Danny whispered. 

“Good,” I said, gripping the phone tightly. “Just keep going.”

There was another creak, and then… a sound I’ll never forget. It was a voice, but not Danny’s. It was low, raspy, and it sent a jolt of pure terror through me.

“Mark,” it said, dragging out my name like it was savoring it.

I froze, my blood turning to ice.

“Danny, get out of there!” I shouted into the phone.

But there was no answer. Just the sound of that voice, and then, the phone went dead.

I tried calling him back, over and over, but there was no answer. I even tried to convince myself it was some sick joke. But I knew my brother—he wouldn’t do that.

I haven’t heard from Danny since that night. I drove out to the old house the next morning, but it was empty. Just an abandoned, decaying wreck. No sign of Danny, no sign of anyone.

The police said he probably just ran off, but I know better. I know what I heard.

Every night since then, I’ve been having nightmares. Dreams of that house, of those voices. They whisper to me now, too, and I can feel them getting closer. 

I’m scared to sleep, scared to answer the phone. But I keep it by my bed every night, just in case Danny calls again.

And when it rings, I don’t know if I’ll be able to answer.
