If you want to hear Violet’s side of the story, read the post linked above.

If you want to hear mine, keep going…

Lauren here. Some people call me a bully. I prefer extra-cocky.

It’s not that I’m cruel. I just don’t like people who are weaker than me.

I see my role as someone who helps others prepare for the harshness of life. Sure…I can be mean. But I won’t apologize for it.

I’m just gonna tell you what happened...because it changed my life. It has everything to do with Violet, the weirdest girl at our school.

It happened one month ago.

Violet showed up to class wearing black garbage bags all over her body. Like, big ones that covered every inch of her skin.

She had a black hoodie on, a mask over her face, and sunglasses. You couldn’t see any part of her.

She reminded me of one of those Ebola doctors, who covered themselves in plastic bags when supplies ran tight.

Obviously…everyone was freaking out. Mrs. Kinsley asked Violet what she was doing. When she didn’t respond, Kinsley sent her to the principal’s office.

We were all so confused, wondering: What the hell?

I knew Violet was strange. But dressing up in black garbage bags? That was new.

I decided to check it out. So a few minutes after Violet left, I raised my hand. Asked to use the restroom.

I made it halfway through the hall when I heard a door slam. Then, the sound of plastic rubbing together. I turned the corner to see the bathroom door open, then close.

Gut-wrenching sobs exploded from inside. I figured Violet was in there.

The crying grew more intense as I crept in. The sobs turned into lung-emptying wails. I started to feel sorry for her.  

“Violet? Is that you?”

The sobbing stopped. My shoes clacked against the floor as I passed each stall, heading for the last one.

“What are you doing in here, Violet?”

“Go away!”

I yanked out my phone. Ready to make a video for my socials. I wasn’t going to pass this opportunity up.

“Please… leave me alone.”

“I’m not leaving.”

“Go away!”

Her voice sounded harsh…yet beautiful. I’d always thought she came off whiny and pathetic. But this time, her voice seemed musical and…intriguing.

“I know we’ve had our differences. And I’ve been mean in the past.”

“Leave now!”

“I just want to help—”

“No one can help me!”

“I’m not going until you come out!”

I reached the final stall.

I heard the sound of plastic rubbing together. Then the CLINK of her door opening.

Violet stepped out.

The mask around her face was pulled down and her sunglasses removed. I could see her unusually pale face. But what astounded me most were her beautiful rose-colored eyes. They were stunning.

“Your eyes.” I gasped. “What’s wrong with them—”

She sprinted past me. Jolted out the door. Moving so fast I didn’t even have time to register what was happening.

I stared at the exit. Mulling it over, What was going on?

I had an idea…

…But it sounded crazy...

You see, in our town there’s this legend. Supposedly, something lives at the old bridge past the dairy farm. Our parents used to tell us that if we stayed up late or did drugs, whatever lived out there would come get us.

I didn’t believe any of it. Until now.

Why? Because according to reports…the thing that lived out there had rose-colored eyes…and if it ever bit you, you’d turn into something just like it.

Well, I couldn’t have Violet hogging all the glory. So I went out there with David one day after gym class.

By the time we reached the bridge, the sun had settled behind the mountains.

David glanced around as I parked.

“This is where you wanted to go?”

“Yep.” I looked around. This was the place, alright.

“We should’ve stayed and watched the game.”

I rolled my eyes. All he ever talked about was basketball. “If you want to leave, leave. I’m staying here until I find out what happened to Violet.”

David grunted. Stepped out to relieve himself.

A buzz from my phone alerted me to a text from my parents: “Where r u?”

“At the library studying.” I responded. “Be home soon.”

I slid my phone back into my pocket. Waited.

It was then I realized David was missing.

“David?”

I rolled down my window.  

“David!”

I got out. Hugged my shoulders. Felt the temperature drop several degrees.

For the first time, I felt uneasy. Like I had done something wrong…coming here. Then —

— something slammed against the car.

“Gotcha!”

It was David. Laughing.  

“That’s not funny!” I said.

He wandered into the middle of the bridge. Cupped his hands over his mouth, shouted, “Hey! If any monsters are out here, come say hi. My girlfriend wants to meet you!”

His voice echoed in the woods. The stillness of the night staring back at us. I almost expected something to leap out and devour him, but nothing did.

“See? Nothing’s here. This place is lame.”  

Over his shoulder, I noticed —

— a shadowy figure, perched on the railing. Dressed in a long black trench coat.

I screamed.

David shoved me back to the car. Flipped the figure off.

“Hey! Freak! What’s your problem?”

The figure just watched us. It was so skinny. Like a creature that hadn’t eaten in decades.

“I’m talking to you!”

Something brushed past me. Grabbed my arm. Shoved me against the vehicle.

It was a tall figure with pointy ears. Same clothes as the first. Its eyes were unlike Violet’s. They were cold and lacked beauty.

“You shouldn’t be here.” It hissed.

“David!”

I glanced around.

He was gone.

“David!”

Agonized screams erupted from the darkness.

I was so scared. I wanted to break free and sprint for the road.

But I was held still in that inhuman grip. Unable to move.

David, I thought, hearing his screams grow louder.

I’m so sorry, David…

***

The cops found me the next day wandering along the interstate. They said I was in such a daze that I couldn’t even remember my name.

They brought me to the hospital. Tried to console me. Even my parents couldn’t help.

It’s been three weeks, and I’m still recovering at home.

The detectives told me David’s body hasn’t been found. They’re investigating it as a runaway, but wonder if a serial killer was involved.

I was so shocked that I couldn’t even react to his news.

All I know is the legends are real. Terrible things live out there. One of them bit Violet…and another took David.

I just wanted to warn you…if you ever go out there after dark…

…you’d better have a damn good reason…

…and a shit-ton of holy water…
