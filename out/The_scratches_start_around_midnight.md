It’s just the flysheet crinkling in the wind. I hope. Pray. But that isn’t quite what a scratch sounds like. A scratch is more aggressive. More intentional.

“Bobby! I swear to God if that’s you I’m gonna—” 

Bobby’s rudely awakened reply comes from the other side of camp. He’s nowhere near my tent. I shiver. Among my friends, Bobby is the resident prankster. Chris and Francesca value their sleep too much to care, and Riley would be too damn stoned.

So who, or what the hell was out there?

Silence.

I sit, bolt upright in my tent, listening. The flysheet crinkles again, zippers jingle, the forest beyond creaks and groans. Not a scratch to be heard. The illusive sound was making a fool out of me. Worse still, paranoid. Did I imagine it? Maybe everyone’s right—maybe I have been in the woods too long. 

Sleep no longer an option, I steel my nerves, grab a flashlight, unzip the tent door, and crawl out into the night.

Name’s Jessie. Jessie McElroy. I’ve been on the trail for almost a year. Out here they call me “Journey” cause I don’t give a shit about where I’m going. There’s nothing back home for me apart from memories. Good and bad. All painful. That’s why my friends joined me, you see. I’ve been thru-hiking in honour of my big brother, Flynn, and today would’ve been his thirty-first birthday. His trail name was “Doots” after the root core of an apple tree. Like the nickname suggests, he was an anchor to anyone and everyone he came into contact with. 

Especially me.

I was born May ’03. Flynn, September ’94 (I guess our folks’ needed a break after their firstborn). Nearly a decade between us, but as siblings, we couldn’t have been closer. Flynn looked after me. I looked up to him. Aspired to be just like him. A generous, adventurous free spirit with charisma to burn.
 
Or so it seemed.

Like our grandfather before him, Flynn was blessed with the gift of the gab, but cursed with an addictive personality. I was too young to see it at the time, but Flynn spent his late teens and early twenties wrestling with the bottle. His burgeoning addiction derailed his career path, got him kicked out of college and stuck in a dead-end job. Then, one fateful midday beer, Flynn got talking to a guy who told him all about the Appalachian Trail and thru-hiking.

It’s been nearly ten years since Flynn disappeared. It was as if the wilderness just swallowed him whole. His body was never found. No foul play sus—scratch that—none was ever proven due to a piss poor investigation. Stupid bastards. As you can imagine, the tragedy tore our family apart. You don’t get over it. You just learn to live with the onslaught. 

Some people drink.

Others smoke.

I walk.

Francesca claims she and the others surprised me on the summit earlier cause they didn’t want me spending tonight, of all nights, in the woods alone. I believe them. I also believe they’re in cahoots with my mom and she sent them out here with one goal: 

Bring. Jessie. Back. 
 
A spool of LED lights hooked from Riley and Bobby’s tarp/hammock setups to Chris and Francesca’s tent, bathes the campsite in jack o’lantern orange. Smoke wafts from the cindering campfire and billows into the forest. My flashlight must look like a lonely star in deep, dark space from afar. Our campsite an isolated outpost.
  
The thought gives me the creeps. 

I check my tent first, make sure there’s nothing sinister hiding behind it. Coast clear, I turn my attention to the others: everyone’s sound asleep. The night amplifies rustling foliage, clinking mess tins, sizzling embers... 

Not a single scratch.

I shine my flashlight into the trees above. The beam—a roving spotlight in the smoky air—illuminates one small, concentrated area of darkness at a time. Firelight is comforting. Moonlight soothing. Battery powered torchlight? Terrifying. I brace myself, prepared to see something. Exhale, relieved, when there’s nothing. I lower my flashlight and turn around to face the other side of camp. 

The side where there are no tents, tarps or hammocks. 

No illusions of boundary.

Just pitch-black, anxiety-inducing forest.

I grip my flashlight, sweat building on my palm, and aim it into the abyss as though it has the power to ward off evil spirits. Heart racing, ears tuned to inhumanly low frequencies, I take a few steps away from my tent, thinking along the same lines as a kid who hides underneath the covers when they’re scared.

If I see something scary, I can dive back into my tent and I’ll be just fine.

Right?

It’s a different world out there, in the dark. As still as it is foreboding. My flashlight casts the drifting, elongated shadows of trees and branches upon the forest floor as I pan the beam from left to right. 

My heart drops.

A scream swells in my lungs.

For a split second, I see a nightmare figure creeping through the woods. Freakishly tall, oversized limbs, stick thin, prancing from one tree to another.

The scream almost escapes before I realise the nightmare figure is just an illusion. A classic case of one’s eyes playing tricks on them. A monstrous shadow puppet of my own, flashlight-wielding creation. 

I laugh, relieved.

Turn back toward my tent— 

Scraaatch…
 
The sound comes from somewhere in camp. I freeze, terrified. Flashlight trembling in hand. I whip the beam all over the place, desperately trying to find The Scratcher before whoever—or whatever it is—attacks. I attempt to shout, but fear holds my voice hostage.
  
Scraaatch... 

This one narrows down the source: my tent. The only thing I can’t figure out is if the scratches are coming from inside or out. Logic dictates that I shouldn’t, under any circumstances, take one step closer. Thing is, I’d rather know what I’m up against. The thought of running away from an ambiguous threat deep in the woods, in the dead of night, isn’t an option. Besides, I can’t muster a syllable right now, which means I can’t warn my friends about the potential danger they’re in. 
 
I’m a depressed, OCD, aimless drifter, not a coward. 

Scraaatch…
 
The scratches are definitely coming from outside my tent. Specifically around the back. No, not either side I can see clearly; all the way around the freakin’ back. Karma’s a suspenseful bitch. Here’s hoping it’s just a curious little wild animal gnawing at the flysheet (emphasis on little). I grip my flashlight so that it doubles as a baton. Take a deep breath. MOVE—the momentum unleashes that scream fear was choking—everyone wakes in a panic.
 
“What is it? What’s wrong?”

“Jessie? You okay?”

“What the hell’s going on out there?”

“Goddammit, Jessie, you scared the shit outta me!”

I stare, dumbfounded, at the back of my tent where a loose line-tensioner, curled up like an emaciated snake, scratches against the flysheet. How did I miss this? I guess when you’re scared you’re not really paying attention. Bobby must’ve tripped over the line-tensioner en route to taking a leak or something.

Francesca is about to get out of her tent to check on me when I finally regain the ability to speak, “Don’t get up. I’m alright, it’s nothing. Just freaked myself out. Sorry, guys.”

Embarrassed, and still a little unsettled, I slip my boots off and crawl back into my tent. I take one last look out into the cool, calm, ghoul free night before I zip the door closed. Cocooned inside my paper-thin, illogically comforting shelter, I straighten out my air mattress and shuffle back into my sleeping bag. 

Far too wired to fall asleep naturally, I put my wireless earbuds on and choose a pre-downloaded sleep meditation on my smartphone. A relaxing melody precedes Sergio’s dulcet narration, “It’s time for sleep. Lets slow down and clear the mind…”

While Sergio speaks, I drop my smartphone into the storage pouch attached to the inner, pull a sleep mask over my eyes and lie down. My inflatable pillow squeaks under head like a balloon while I get comfortable. Sergio continues, “Make sure you’re lying on your back and keep your spine as straight as possible…”

I do exactly as Sergio says, “Take a deep breath in... hold it… and exhale…” We repeat the process three more times. After the last exhale I’m completely tuned into Sergio’s narration and the gentle music that accompanies it. 

There’s also, at a much lower level in the mix, an ambient underscore. The more I relax, the more I hear the sounds of a picturesque white sand beach:
 
Marram grass rustles in the breeze, seagulls caw overhead, waves lap at the shore.

Sweet slumber is inevitable.

When—

Scraaatch…

I freeze as if a ghost just caressed my neck. I’m too scared to move. Perhaps it’s just another sound effect layered deep within the sleep meditation. Any number of things can make a “scratching” sound at the beach:

Windswept sand, a scuttling crab, a surfer dragging their board back to shore.
  
Scraaatch…
 
It’s definitely NOT part of the audio mix. It’s a real sound coming from somewhere inside my tent.  

“What the fuck is that?!” 

I rip my eye mask off, earbuds out, sit up in a frenzy— 

Where the fuck is my flashlight when I need it?! I search my pockets—sleeping bag—gear scattered around me. Nothing. Shit! The scratches grow louder and louder. I’m on the brink of a full-blown panic attack when I remember my smartphone is in the storage pouch. I grab it—BOOM—the lumens are blinding. I squint until my eyes adjust. Whip the light all over the place, searching for the source of the scratches. 
 
“Where the fuck is that coming from?!”
 
Cue the Dolly Zoom of Horrifying Realisation.
  
I don’t just hear the scratches.

I FEEL them. 
 
The scratches aren’t coming from inside or out.
  
They’re coming from BENEATH my tent.
  
I jump off my air mattress—rip it off the floor—the unmistakable shape of fingertips press up against the groundsheet, clawing, scratching, writhing, desperate to break through.
 
“Ohmygooaaahhh!”
 
I fret for the door—fumble with the zip, “Come on, come on, come on…” Finally get a hold of it and PULL—the zip slides a few inches—jams, “No, no, no! Help! Francesca! Bobby!” I try to wriggle the zip free, but it won’t budge. I freak out. Can’t breathe. The confined space becomes suffocating.  

The Scratcher touches me through the groundsheet, “Aaahhh! No! Get off me!  

I rip the tent door from its seams and spill into camp. 
 
“Jessie?! What is it? What’s wrong?” yells Francesca as she runs toward me. Behind her, Chris scrambles out of their tent. Beyond him, Bobby and Riley jump out of their hammocks.
  
Everyone surrounds me, worried, confused.

“Something—there’s something under—oh god, it touched me!” I back up into a tree, eyes fixed on my tent, mind conjuring the horror that lurks beneath.

“Bobby, get back! It’s not safe, there’s something under there!” 

“The hell you talking about, Jessie?” 

Francesca kneels beside me, “It’s okay, honey, you’re gonna be okay. You just had a bad dream, that’s all.” 

“No! You’re not listening to me. There is something underneath my fucking tent!”
 
Francesca stares at me in sympathetic disbelief. Chris and Riley pace, unsure what to say or do. Bobby isn’t so understanding, “Screw this, I’m going back to bed.”

Francesca takes my hands in hers, “I know you’re hurting right now, honey. It’s a tough night. But we’re here for ya. We’ve got—”

“Aaaahhhh! What the?!”

Bobby screams as he falls to the ground— 

A thin, dirty lacerated hand protrudes from under my tent, grabbing at his ankles.
 
A contagious scream ricochets around camp. For a split second, nobody—not even the ever resourceful Francesca—knows what to do. Everyone just stares at the disembodied hand thrashing out of the earth like a freshly caught fish.

“Holy shit,” whispers Francesca as she steps closer, “that’s a per—there’s someone under there!” 

Francesca MOVES—

“Come on, guys! Quick! Hurry!”

Everyone springs into action: Riley de-stakes my tent—Chris and Bobby pull it off to the side—Francesca claws into the premature burial ground, “DIG!”

I watch the excavation unfold in shock-induced paralysis. How is this possible? Who the hell is under there? What if it’s some kind of demented zombie version of Flynn?

(Spoiler: it isn’t).

Dirt flies while my mind races. The guys scrape, claw, rake their way into the earth with bare hands. Nails break, knuckles bleed. The grubby, gasping face of a young woman gradually appears like a fossil during an archaeological dig.
 
Only difference is, she’s alive.

Barely.

“Water! We need water!” yells Francesca.

Riley makes a beeline for her rucksack. Chris, Bobby and Francesca grab the young woman—heave her out of the shallow grave—lay her down beside the dormant campfire.

“Get the fire lit!” orders Francesca as she darts off without explanation, “Wait, what? Where are you going?”

“Just light the fire, Chris, I’m going to get the first aid kit!”
 
Riley returns with a flask. Pours water over the young woman’s face wiping away as much blood, sweat and grime as possible. The poor girl coughs and splutters. Gasps like a free-diver breaching the surface. She must be no older than twenty-one.
 
That’s the same age Flynn was when he disappeared.
 
She reminds me of him. Has that same fiery look in her eye—a ravenous hunger for life—which probably means she also harbours a demon or two. God only knows what she’s been through. I’m sure she’ll tell us when she’s ready. I bet fresh air never tasted so good. She’s definitely on a trail diet. Has that athletic, albeit slightly malnourished appearance only us thru-hikers can achieve.

I know what you’re thinking. How the hell did we set up camp in the exact spot where a young woman is buried alive? In a forest this size, the chances are beyond slim if not straight-up impossible.

Thing is, we didn’t choose this spot.

We were led here.

After the guys surprised me on the summit earlier, we dropped back down onto the trail. We must’ve hiked a few miles or so before this stray dog—a German Shepherd—burst out of nowhere, barking like crazy. 

It seemed aggressive at first, so we kept our distance. Then it took off into the trees and I couldn’t shake this feeling it was trying to tell us something.
 
So I chased after it, everyone chased after me, and we wound up in this very clearing.
The dog ran around, sniffing and pawing at the ground, but nowhere in particular for too long. I thought nothing of it, nothing looked out of place.
 
Whoever buried the girl alive is a pro.

They didn’t leave a trace.

Bobby detonated a bear-banger, scaring the dog off. Haven’t seen nor heard from it since, poor thing.
 
At first, everyone was pissed off that I dragged them out here for no reason. Francesca—quick to come to my social rescue—pointed out it wasn’t a half bad place to camp. We were only a few miles shy of where we were supposed to camp anyway, so we’d only be adding an extra hour or so to our hike out in the morning.

Little did we know, huh? Hindsight’s a foresight and foresight’s a gobshite, as Flynn used to say. 

Riley helps the young woman take a much-needed sip of water, “What’s your name?” The young woman tries to speak, but her mouth is too dry. She takes another sip. Just about musters, “An… Anna… my name’s Anna.”

Whoosh! The campfire flares back to life. Bobby wields a camping stove like a flamethrower. Chris feeds the fire with sticks.

Francesca runs toward Riley and Anna with the first aid kit. Clocks me cowering on the sidelines, “Jessie! Don’t just sit there for Christ’s sake! Do something—call 911!”

“No! You can’t—you can’t do that. If you call 911 they’ll know,” frets Anna, “they’ll know you’ve found me.”

Silence. Everyone stops. All eyes on Anna.

“They’ll know you’ve found me…”

The statement lingers like a bad smell. A terrifying scent that prompts so many questions: 

Who are They?

Why did They bury Anna alive?

And most disturbingly of all, where are They right now?

The forest has never been more threatening.

I can’t take my eyes off her. The girl who crawled out from underneath MY tent. Fate? Destiny? Divine intervention? 

Who knows. All I know is she’s a fighter. A survivor. Resurrected. Reborn. The victim of an unspeakable crime offered one of life’s rarest gifts: a second chance. 

You don’t claw your way out of the earth if you don’t want it. Anna’s got something to live for. It’s written all over her. Family, I bet. Maybe just a boyfriend. Or a dog. Someone that would miss her if she never came home. 

Our eyes meet across the campfire, and at that moment, there’s a telepathic spark between us. 

An undeniable connection.

A silent understanding.

Anna’s life, is my fight.
