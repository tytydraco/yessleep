Growing up as a kid I had always wanted to play the piano for the longest time I remember constantly being my parents to get me piano lessons but they never agreed they said it was too expensive and they don't have the money for it.

But one day they came to me and said they had managed to find me a piano teacher who gives lessons for extremely cheap prices the moment they told me I was extadic and eagerly awaited to meet my teacher when we arrived at the address he'd given us we saw and old brick five storie apartment complex and siting on the front stairs was a tall man he wore a black three peac suite and sported a red bow tie. 

A small pair of spectacles rested on his eyes and had a thick head of silver hair that was slicked back he introduced himself as Isac he said that he was a retired musician and spent his free time teaching other kids like me how to play the piano Isac wore a kind and patient demeanor he invited us into his home he lived on the first floor the elevator was broken so we didn't have to climbed any flights of stairs thankfully.

When I entered his apartment I immediately noticed how weird it smelt his home had a strong chemical smell to it like bleach or laundry detergent my parents didn't say anything though so I just chose to ignore it after he finished explaining to my parents what my schedule would be like and how much the lessons would cost I was set they left and told me they'd be back to pick me up.

Thus began my weekly routine every day after school my parents would drop me off at Isac's and he wold teach me piano and it was amazing I loved Isac and how he taught me he was always patient with me and if there was something I didn't understand he always maed sure to take it one step at a time until I figured it out it was great... until somthig happened.

It was like any other day until Isac told me he needed to go take care of something and left he was gone for what seemed like hours I got tired of waiting so I went to go look for him I searched almost every where but couldn't find him until I heard a noise coming from his bedroom it sounded like a loud thud I went to investigate when I got there I found his bedroom door ajar and when I looked inside I saw that hid bed was completely moved to the other sied of the room and what appeared to be underneath his bed was a black trap door I walked closer to the door it had a old rustic look to it as I was about to open it I heard something coming up twards it that's when I saw the door open only to reavel Isac with his head popped out of the trap door.

He looked disheveled and shocked as he laid eyes on mehe than began to speak
"What are you doing here? I thought I told you to live in the living room."
I told him I had gotten woried beacus I heard a loud thud Isac looked as pale as a ghost gone was his kind,patience and cool demeanor in it's place was a look of paranoia,fear and anger
"Go back to the living room and wait at the piano now!" 
Not wanting to anger him further I obeyed.

When he got back to continue the lesson he was back to his kind and patient attitude it was like Isac was a completely different person from the man in that room when I tried to talk about what had  happened in there and what he was doing he just went silent and ignored me that's when Isac began to change he started to be more strict with me at first it was subtle he would watch my hands acasinoly and if I played a wrong note he would scold me and said to play it again but then it had gotten to the point where he was always watching my hands and if I maed the slightest mistake he would grab my hands and physically make me play the right note he would grab me so hard to the point where it started to hurt.

He would start to tell me how my hands were so perfect yet I wasted them so carlesly I was starting to get scared of Isac and the way he constantly looked at my hands he looked as though he wanted them for him self I tried telling my parents about it but they didn't believe me every time they picked me up Isac would always turn on his relaxed demeanor and wear a fake smile across his face so they wouldn't get suspicious when I mentioned how he would look at and grab my hands they chalked it up to me trying to get out of my lessons so I was trapped I couldn't do anything my parents wouldn't believe  me so all I could do was just bear through his lessons but one day everything changed I would get to know what Isac was hiding and what a monster he truly was.

I remembered the day vividly it was a warm spring day school was starting to close up for the summer and I was at Isac's apartment and I was practicing some scales but suddenly with out warning Isac got up from the seat and said
"Come with me I want to show you somthing"
I was confused but curious so I fallowed him he guided me to his bed room and there I saw the bed moved to the other sied of the room reveling that same old metal black trap door but this time it was wild open Isac then placed his hand on my shoulder 
"This is my special prize room I maed it specifically for my best students the reason I was so upset was beacus you weren't ready yet you needed more practice until you were ready but now you are finally ready."

Isac leand down to my level and pointed to the door "I want you to go down there and pick out a prize."
Most kids would have been excited about this and I normally would have been but not this time even I new somthing was suspicious for starters the way he talked seemed like there was know emotion or soul behind his words he seemed completely and utterly desensitized but the main thing that kept me from going down there was the smell unlike before we're his house mostly wreaked of chemicals the trap door seemed to have let off a different smell that I can only describe as somthing roting but Isac began to notice my fear as he begun to tighten his grip on my shoulder
"Get in there now."

The moment he said those words that was the final straw I kicked Isac's knee causing him to let go of me as he clutched his leg I tried to run out off the house but house but I only managed to get to the livingroom before he grabbed me he tried to resle me to the ground but using all the strength I had I some how managed to pushe him off of me as he fell his head slamed into the piano keys causing a loud thud mixed with the sounds of the piano I ran out the door to one of his neighbor's who lucky had heard the comotin I told him everything about the trap door and how Isac had tried to force me insied it the neighbor ended up calling the cops they aressted Isac and surched his place and found the trap door.

What I am about to share is what they found in that room but I'm warning you now if you are squeamish or are faint of heart when it comes to gore stop reading now you have been warned.

When the police went down the trap door they found the bodies of 6 other dead children exactly my age there faces were mutilated to the point beyond recognition there bodies were hung up on meat hooks and the floor was completely soked in blood some of it fresh and some of it old black and crusty there was a metal table in the middle of the room and on it was a bloody butchers knife and bone saw all of the dead children were missing there hands and off at the right hand side of the room was a shelf containing the children's hands slead in jars of formaldehyde later on in the search the police would also uncover the skeletons of two other children inside the floor boards beneath the piano in between the two skeletons was a old dirty hamer with remnants of dried blood on it.

Isac wold be put on trail and sentenced to life in prison but would later be killed by a prisoner only two years into his life sentence when my parents first heard the news they were terrified they try to help me get through it I've been going to therapy lately but I don't think it's working even now that Isac is dead he still hunts me I always think back to that evening wondering what could have happened to me had I not been able to get away I have constant nightmares about him catching up to me and making me one of his victims and honestly I don't think I'll ever be able to recover from this.
