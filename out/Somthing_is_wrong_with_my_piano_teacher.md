Growing up as a kid, I had always wanted to play the piano for the longest time. I remember constantly being my parents to get me piano lessons, but they never agreed they said it was too expensive and they don't have the money for it.

But one day they came to me and said they had managed to find me a piano teacher who gives lessons for extremely cheap prices. The moment they told me I was extadic and eagerly awaited to meet my teacher. When we arrived at the address he'd given us we saw an old brick five storie apartment complex. Sitting on the front stairs was a tall man he wore a black three peac suite and sported a red bow tie. 

A small pair of spectacles rested on his eyes and had a thick head of silver hair that was slicked back. He introduced himself as Isac. He said that he was a retired musician and spent his free time teaching other kids like me how to play the piano. Isac wore a kind and patient demeanor he invited us into his home, and he lived on the first floor. The elevator was broken, so we didn't have to climb any flights of stairs.

When I entered his apartment I immediately noticed how weird it smelt. His home had a strong chemical smell to it like bleach or laundry detergent. My parents didn't say anything, though, so I just chose to ignore it. After he finished explaining to my parents what my schedule would be like and how much the lessons would cost I was set, they left and told me they'd be back to pick me up.

Thus began my weekly routine every day after school. My parents would drop me off at Isac's, and he would teach me piano. It was amazing I loved Isac and how he taught me. He was always patient with me, and if there was something I didn't understand, he always made sure to take it one step at a time until I figured it out it was great... until something happened.

It was like any other day until Isac told me he needed to go take care of something. He left and was gone for what seemed like hours. I got tired of waiting so I went to go look for him. I searched almost everywhere but couldn't find him. Until I heard a noise coming from his bedroom, it sounded like a loud thud. When I went to investigate I found his bedroom door ajar. When I looked inside, I saw that his bed was completely moved to the other side of the room. There was what appeared to be a black trap door underneath his bed. I walked closer to the door it had an old rustic look to it as I was about to open it. I heard something coming up toward it. That's when I saw the door open only to reavel Isac with his head popped out of the trap door.

He looked disheveled and shocked as he laid eyes on me he then began to speak.
"What are you doing here? I thought I told you to stay in the living room."

I told him I had gotten worried because I heard a loud thud. Isac looked as pale as a ghost gone was his kind,patience and cool demeanor. In its place was a look of paranoia,fear, and anger.

"Go back to the living room and wait at the piano now!" 
Not wanting to anger him further, I obeyed.

When he got back to continue the lesson, he was back to his kind and patient attitude. It was like Isac was a completely different person. When I tried to talk about what had  happened in there and asked what he was doing he just went silent and ignored me. That's when Isac began to change he started to be more strict with me. At first, it was subtle he would watch my hands acasinoly, and if I played a wrong note, he would scold me and would say to play it again. But then it had gotten to the point where he was always watching my hands and if I maed the slightest mistake he would grab my hands and physically make me play the right note. He would grab me so hard to the point where it started to hurt.

He would start to tell me how my hands were so perfect, yet I wasted them so carlesly. I was starting to get scared of Isac. The way he constantly looked at my hands he looked as though he wanted them for him self. I tried telling my parents about it but they didn't believe me. Every time they picked me up, Isac would always turn on his relaxed demeanor and wear a fake smile across his face. so they wouldn't get suspicious when I mentioned how he would look at and grab my hands they chalked it up to me trying to get out of my lessons. So I was trapped. I couldn't do anything. My parents wouldn't believe  me, so all I could do was just bear through his lessons. But one day, everything changed. I would get to know what Isac was hiding and what a monster he truly was.

I remembered the day vividly. It was a warm spring day. School was starting to close up for the summer. I was at Isac's apartment, and I was practicing some scales, but suddenly, without warning, Isac got up from the seat and said

"Come with me. I want to show you something."
I was confused but curious, so I fallowed him. 

He guided me to his bedroom, and there I saw the bed moved to the other side of the room, reveling that same old metal black trap door. But this time, it was wied open. Isac then placed his hand on my shoulder.

"This is my special prize room. I made it specifically for my best students. the reason I was so upset was because you weren't ready yet. You needed more practice until you were prepared. But now you are finally ready."

Isac leand down to my level and pointed to the door. 

"I want you to go down there and pick out a prize."

Most kids would have been excited about this, and I normally would have been. but not this time, even I knew something was suspicious. for starters the way he talked seemed like there was know emotion or soul behind his words. He seemed completely and utterly desensitized. 

But the main thing that kept me from going down there was the smell. Unlike before we're his house mostly wreaked of chemicals. The trap door seemed to have let off a different smell that I could only describe as puetred, but Isac began to notice my fear as he began to tighten his grip on my shoulder.

"Get in there now."

The moment he said those words, that was the final straw. I kicked Isac's knee, causing him to let go of me as he clutched his leg. I tried to run out off the house. I only managed to get to the living room before he grabbed me. 

He tried to pin me to the ground, but using all the strength I had, I somehow managed to push him off of me. As he fell, his head slamed into the piano keys. causing a loud thud mixed with the sounds of the piano. 

I quickly ran out the door to one of his neighbor's who lucky had heard the comotin. I told him everything about the trap door and how Isac had tried to force me to go inside it. the neighbor ended up calling the cops they aressted Isac and surched his place and found the trap door.

What I am about to share is what they found in that room. But I'm warning you now that if you are squeamish or are faint of heart when it comes to gore, stop reading now you have been warned.

When the police went down the trap door they found the bodies of 6 other dead children exactly my age. Their faces were mutilated to the point beyond recognition. Their bodies were hung up on meat hooks, and the floor was completely soked in blood. 

Some of it fresh and some of it old black and crusty there was a metal table in the middle of the room. On it was a bloody butchers knife and bone saw. All of the dead children were missing there hands. Off at the right-hand side of the room was a shelf containing the children's hands slead in jars of formaldehyde. Later on in the search, the police would also uncover the skeletons of two other children inside the floor boards Beneath the piano. In between the two skeletons was an old dirty hamer with remnants of dried blood on it.

Isac would be put on trail and sentenced to life in prison. But he was later killed by a prisoner only two years into his life sentence. When my parents first heard the news they were terrified. They try to help me get through it. I've been going to therapy lately, but I don't think it's working. Even now that Isac is dead he still hunts me. I always think back to that evening, wondering what could have happened to me had I not been able to get away. I have constant nightmares about him catching up to me and making me one of his victims. Honestly, I don't think I'll ever be able to recover from this.
