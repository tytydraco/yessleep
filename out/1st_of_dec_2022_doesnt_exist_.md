 Ok idk if you guys have noticed it or not but 1st dec 2022 just doesn't exist..it never came to be, my roommate n i just had this conversation n m writing it all down cause we both feel so creeped out t's 2nd dec Friday 1:10 am right now n lemme explain how we came to this conclusion

So i am a (f20) University student n i live with my roommate in a hostel. Both of us go to the same uni but have opted for different majors so obviously we have different classes... so last Wednesday I and some of my friends from my class decided to go watch a movie we were all talking about how it was already 29th (november) almost the end of the month and we have thursdays as off day plus our exam's starting from the first week of dec so we should take a break n go for movies to really set ourselves for the exam prep (just keep this in mind that 1st of dec wasn't an easy date to forget as it set's the time for the start of our final exam prep) my roomy wasn't joining us as she had other classes to attend

So we went to movies as decided and came back home at night. Next day was Thursday (supposedly 30th of nov) i didn't pay much attention to the date as it was an off day for me n i stated home all day but my roomy did had her classes. After dinner one of our other friend who's again is in the same uni and in the same hostel with us but has her own room came to hang out, it was sort of a routine for us. While we were talking i got a call from my bf n i decided to go out to the balcony attached to our room to talk to him in private but when i came back from the balcony everything felt a bit different...the room felt a bit different, the way my roomy n our friend were sitting on the bed felt different like the environment of the whole room has somehow shifted honestly the whole night felt a bit different after that  but i didn't pay much attention to it back the....

The night went on n it was soon past midnight n it was time to go to bed our friend went to her room to dose off n we also made our beds n tucked into our blankets...n that's when my rommy noticed it...it was some how 2nd dec 12:40am. She was shock n asked me if i had noticed when 1st dec ended or even if it started at all i was shocked too 

 wasn't it supposed to be the 30th today i said how is it already 2nd n she was like yeah i mean it's past midnight so it was suppose to be the 1st December right now but idk what happened .... My voice toned down from the chills that i was getting my mind was trying to make sense of the whole thing n i said Didn't u feel like our friend stay a bit too long today sje agreed with a nod n i continued i mean yeah she always hang out with us past midnight but it felt a bit too long today .... I felt it too for some reason i felt like she came to our room twice today but logically it was just once after dinner she added ...i told her about how i felt like the night has somehow shifted after i came back from the balcony....we were both so creeped out n were silent for a while...n then she said it .. didn't u go to the movies yesterday which was 29th right ...i agreed n tried to find the date on the movie ticket but i couldn't find it n my calendar said it was the 30th instead 
 
....but the creepiest part is that my roomy clearly remembers that the day i went for movies (Wednesday) she had a class with this one teacher who only has classes once a week n she remembered him asking what date is it n she look at her phone and confirmed it was the 29th of Nov and was so sure of this that it sent chills all over our body we turned on all the lights , sat together and said it togather why does it feel like the night if 30th of nov and 1st of dec just merged...1st dec never came to be

Please share if u felt like this too
