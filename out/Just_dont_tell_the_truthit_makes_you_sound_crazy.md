Okay...okay....I need to settle down my thoughts. I need this to get out because I am not crazy.

This mess all started on a random night two weeks ago. I was out on a holiday with a group of friends. On an island not to far from the Spanish coast I think? I don't remember, I hit my head pretty hard while running away from those god awful things. 

We arrived well and settled into a camp. It had cabins and the vibe and the atmosphere was nice. The camp had like 6 cabins on a semi circle positioned in front of a mountain that had a beautiful view of the river in front of us down below the mountain. 

When we arrived in the village we bought some knick knacks and headed to their local pub. There, we met a gentleman that was a bit strange. He asked where we were coming from and J who was my bolder friend responded with England. 

The old man stopped starring down his pint of beer and fixed his grey soulless eyes on us all. 

"You are the lads going to that camp they re opened for tourists?"

"Yeah, we are." I chimed in all smiley. 

The old man with his long grey beard and beige fedora hat did not share my enthusiasm. 

"There is a reason that things are closed around here." His tone cutting off all joy and excitement that we could keep up. 

The bartender cut him off and gestured us to stay away. 
Before I could go he turned to me specifically and said:

"Truth will make men seem crazy. If you want to keep you and your friends alive. Do not venture in their territory. People here like to ignore it but such things cannot be ignored. That camp extends to their territory. Pass it at your own peril. And don't overstay your welcome out there."

I shook it off and I decided to just go back to my friends. We drank all night and ventured back to our camp. 

The first week was not eventful fortunately so I put the strange old man in the back of my mind for awhile. Then on Sunday night something strange happened. 

There was a strange smell in the wind, metallic like the smell of blood but it was very strong. I started going to the other cabins to ask my friends about it. As soon as I existed my cabin a strange tension was hanging in the air. As if I was someone's prey and I was being stalked. I tried to ignore it and hurried to my friend J and Axel's cabin. 
They welcomed me in and closed the door and locked it behind me. 

"Why did you do that?" I asked. 

"Did you not hear the howl and growls?" Axel snapped back. 

"We couldn't catch any sleep afterwards. We just took these bats and locked the doors." Said J. 

"I came here because I could smell blood in my cabin and wanted to ask if you guys smelled anything. Or saw something strange. " I explained. 

"We saw Sabrina and Loyd leaving their cabin but we can't really put a stop to their fun I guess." Said Axel while chuckling. 

"They went away like 2 hours ago now." Said J in a worried tone. 

Before I could answer we heard a bang on the door. It was Ella. She was banging at the door and crying hysterically to be let in. 

We let her inside the cabin and she was screaming and crying in a state of full shock. She was bloody and scratched up. 

We tried to settle her down until she was just quietly sobbing in Axel's arms. 

"What happened?" Asked Axel. 

"I was sleeping and I heard some giggles. I thought it was Sabrina but that was not her. That was so so not her. It wasn't here whatsoever." She said before breaking down again and crying. 

"What is going on here?" Said J now fully alarmed gripping his baseball bat. 

"Maybe it has to do with what that old man told me? Maybe Loud amd Sabrina found something they shouldn't have?" I responded. 

"Bullshit." Snapped Axel. "There is no territory or whatever fairy tales that old fuck was blabbering about."

I wanted to argue but our door received a very loud bang. The door was shaking and the handle was twisting and turning. The hinger on the door looked like they were about to give up. Ella was screaming and shouting that "they are here, help me". 

J looked at the window and just as he did a large black hand with claws as long as 50 cm gripped his head tightly and twisted it's head off from his body. His carcass dropping down on the floor with blood shooting up from his now headless corpse. Ella was in full panic mode and so was Axel. 

The beasts were beginning to shake the entire cabin confirming that their prey was inside. The lights gave out and soon our cabin was flooded in darkness so thick that you could cut it with a knife. 

We were scared, tired and desperate. I decided that we should bolt outside and make a run out of the camp and contact the police on the pay phone. Axel agreed. Ella was in a state of shock and could not even talk. Axel decided to carry Ella away. I took the baseball bat and we decided to move out as soon as the shaking stopped. We waited for a full hour before whatever was out there decided to leave us. Or so we thought. 

I led the charge. Opened the door and got out with Axel and Ella in his arms right behind me. 

We walked for two minutes before it reveled itself. Followed by another one. And another one. And another one. 

They were tall. Dark. Very muscular and covered by thick fur. Their eyes were dark blood red. Empty. Their heads were adorned by a bone structure that looked like antlers and they were dirty with blood. They looked very intricate as if they were a piece of art. But their terrifying purpose was taking all their magic away. Their legs were loke a spiders. So long and sharp like spears. Their hands the same big claws adorned with dried blood from a good night of hunting. They did not have noses or any other discernable face structures. They seemed to communicate between themselves in a strange language as they were slowly approaching us. We decided to run away between them. Axel was shouting behind me as we were cutting through the thick forest trying to find the clearing through the road. 
After a few minuted Axel and Ella went quiet. I didn't hear anything. I was alone. All alone in this empty dark forest. Even the moon did not dare to light this place up. The clear sky was covered by dark, puffy clouds. My sinuses were invaded by the same metallic smell of blood. 

I turned around to a growl. And I saw it. Standing...no...towering above me. I closed my eyes and waited for my demise. A sharp pain struck my skin. So deep. It felt like a tattoo. I opened my eyes afterwards and the figure was gone. I only had an X symbol carved on my chest. I started running through the forest before I slipped down a ledge and hit my head hard on a tree's branches. I woke up the next morning next to the road. Hearing ambulance sirens from the distance. I fell asleep again and woke up here now in the hospital. 

The doctors told me that I had a minor concussion and my injury on my stomach was a bit infected but it wasn't untreatable. 

At the hospital there I had a visitor. The old man. 

He brought me a pack of crisps and some water. He just looked at me and said in a very cold tone. 

"They always leave one to tell the story." He said before lifting his button up shirt to reveal on his belly the scars of the same X symbol that was on my chest. 

"You are a lucky lad. Just don't tell the truth of what happened...after all, the truth makes you sound crazy, right?"
