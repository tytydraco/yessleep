December is that special time of year, when people decorate and sing songs. It's the season of lights, when people gather with loved ones to feast and exchange gifts by a warm fire.  At least that's what it's like for other people. 

  
While other people are hanging their stockings with care, I'm waiting for the annual phone call from my cousin Alan. Part of me wishes we would abandon this tradition. After all we're grownups now. Still, year after year we keep it going. 

  
My windows are fogging up as the temperature drops outside. Christmas lights join the usual urban glow to stand in defiance of the night; but the shadows still grow longer as the sky darkens from a dull gray to the color of a darkened bruise.  

  
I wouldn't call myself a city person per se. It's not the night life or the culture that made me choose my metropolitan lifestyle. I'm here because it's the furthest thing from a forest. 

  
There are botanic gardens and arboretums all around this city and in its outlying suburbs. People tell me they're wonderful, but I'll never visit them. 

  
Whenever people hear that, they think I'm crazy. I can't bear to be around too many trees though.  Just like I can't stand to watch movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger. People probably think I'm unhinged. Perhaps they're right. It doesn't matter though. 

  
This year I needed to speak my piece. While I wait for Alan's call, I'm going to write down this winter's tale. As I pour my whiskey, the deep scars that line my forearm remind me what happened on that cold December night, when my childhood ended. 

  
\--  
**December 5th, 1986**  
My dad's side of the family always did Christmas on the first weekend of December. His two sisters and their families would travel in from out of state, then we would all meet up at his brother's down state. 

  
Aunt Shelly and Uncle George were always cool. She was an airline stewardess, and he was a carpenter. They always flew in free because of her job. I was always glad to see them, because they never pinched my cheeks or asked me how school was. Plus, I always got good presents from them. 

  
Their son Alan was, and still is, my favorite cousin. Alan was a few years older than me, so I looked up to him. Most of the time he didn't treat me like some annoying kid tagging along. That year he was thirteen to my nine. 

  
Aunt Cindy and Uncle Michael were okay. He was a boring accountant, and she was a stay-at-home mom.  They gave okay presents, and he called me things like sport and champ. Aunt Cindy kind of seemed overwhelmed all the time.  They're had my cousins Michelle and Danny. 

  
Michelle was okay, but we never bonded the way Alan and I had. She was way older, having turned eighteen the previous August. Her brother Danny (the Whoops Baby) was only two years old at the time. He sells Toyotas and has an unhealthy obsession with sports now.  


  
My Uncle Jerry was alright, but my Aunt Rebecca was a real bitch. She often complained about the food my other aunts would bring. Her favorite hobby was belittling the other women's appearances and parenting skills. 

  
"Your hair is getting too long Shelly," and "You know Cindy, I've got a great exercise tape that will help you burn off those pregnancy pounds," were for the Moms. "I think I saw Alan take some candy, he'll spoil his dinner," and "Michelle looks a bit, well that's a LOT of make up," were for the kids.  

  
Aunt Rebecca had no business dishing out advice though. Her daughter Abby was the queen of little shits everywhere. On December 5th, 1986, she taught a master class in being a terror. 

  
Everyone made the usual pleasantries and greetings in Uncle Jerry's living room. After all the "hello" and "my how you've grown", we dispearsed. 

  
Dad and my uncles would retreat to the den to drink Old Style and Special Export while they discussed everything from the Bears and the Packers to Reaganomics. 

  
Mom and the aunts would hold babies and drink Lancers in the kitchen as they caught up. Well, all of them except Rebecca, who would dish out insults disguised as advice. 

  
Kids went to the basement or played outside. There was a pool table in the basement, but there were no balls or cues. There was a large coffee table behind it where we would play board games.  That day we played Candy Land. Michelle had set up the game, but as she went to take the first turn, we heard a familiar phrase.

  
"ABBY'S TURN!"

  
She dragged the board across the table and snatched the card from Michelle's hand. Sure, officially the youngest player was supposed to start, but not steal someone else's cards. 

  
"PURPLE! No, I'm green!"

  
Abby snatched the green piece from Michelle and moved it to the closest purple spot. It was never any fun playing with Abby. Regardless of what game she played, Abby always cheated.

&#x200B;

Rules changed when it suited her. If she lost a turn or had to draw cards, she would throw a tantrum or keep playing as though it didn't happen. 

  
Sometimes we used her own bent rules against her. That day, Michelle had worked out Abby's system and used it to win. 

  
"I win!"

  
"No fair you cheated!"

  
"How did I cheat?"

  
"You used the short cuts wrong!"

  
"I used them the same as you!"

  
"Did not!"

  
"Did too! I was playing by YOUR rules. And anyways you ignored the licorice".

  
Abby folded her arm and made a pouty face. It was her, "you better give me what I want" expression.

  
"Not fair you cheated," Abby said with a mopey tone. 

  
"Nope. You're just upset because I played by your made-up rules and still won".

  
Abby lunged forward and scratched Michelle's face.

  
"What the Hell you little brat!"

  
Abby ran up the stairs and out of the basement. 

  
"Mommy, Mommy! Michelle cheated at Candy Land and she and she a swore!"

  
Blood trickled down Michelle's nose from the scratches on her forehead. 

  
"Are you okay," Alan said with a worried tone as I went to the basement bathroom to find bandages.   


  
After tending to Michelle, we went upstairs. 

  
Abby had her arms wrapped around Uncle Jerry's legs as she pressed her sobbing face into his thighs.   


  
I could hear Dad talking to my uncles from the den.   


  
"You can't be a winner if you can't handle losing," Dad said.

  
"Rebecca's delusional if she thinks Abby's going to be some gold medal gymnast when the kid has no discipline. Or balance," Uncle Michael said. 

  
"She's so God damned spoiled," Uncle George replied.

  
Aunt Rebecca gave us all a look of disdain. 

  
"You need to learn how to play fair with you cousin. After all she's only six. And Michelle, you need to watch your language around her".

  
"Maybe you need to have her de-clawed," Michelle retorted. 

  
"Oh my God what happened," Aunt Cindy asked as she rocked Danny in her arms. 

  
"Abby scratched me because I won at Candy Land".

  
"I'm sure she didn't mean to," Rebecca said. 

  
That was always the response. Abby didn't MEAN to. It was an accident. She never meant to cut in front, or break something, or hurt anyone. Every instance was an isolated lapse in judgement. 

  
Even though the other grown-ups consoled us after Abby's misdeeds, they never called Uncle Jerry and his family out on it. Part of it was we met at their house around the holidays. 

&#x200B;

The other part was Grandmother loved Jerry's family best, despite the fact Rebecca convinced her husband to put her in an old folk's home. That's where she spent that fateful night in fact. 

  
"It smells like the cookies are almost done," Aunt Shelly said. "Who's turn is it to lick the beaters?"

  
"Abby's turn," the little imp screamed as she plucked both beaters from Aunt Shelly's hands. 

  
She licked them with sloppy glee, getting chocolate into her perfect, curly, blonde hair. Her face looked like it was covered in shit. 

  
"Abby," her mom said in an exasperated tone, "you're going to ruin your hair".

  
Aunt Rebecca made no attempt to correct her daughter's gluttony. Why would she? Future champions don't need to apologize. She spent the next ten minutes trying get the chocolate out of Abby's hair with a damp paper towel. 

  
Once the cookies had cooled, Abby pushed the rest of us out of the way of course.

  
"She really likes those cookies," Aunt Rebecca said with a smile on her face.

  
Abby wasn't going to eat all those cookies. She just wanted to take a bite out of each of them. 

  
My cousins and I sat down in the living room to enjoy our cookies and cocoa. Outside, day was turning into night. Snow covered Uncle Jerry's backyard and the wooded hills that laid beyond.  

  
Abby pounced onto Alan, spilling cocoa all over his sweater.

  
"Abby what the heck?"

  
"Let's play".

  
"We're having our cookies and cocoa now. We can play later".

  
"No, let's play now," she said with a big smile. 

  
"Later".

  
"Let's play outside".

  
"It's getting dark out Abby," Michelle said coming to Alan's defense. 

  
"Hey Abby," Aunt Rebecca said, "did you show the cousins your sledding hill?"

  
"Rebecca," Mom said trying to plead. 

  
At that moment Noah, Abby's three-year-old brother, came stumbling in. 

  
"Oh, geez not again," Aunt Rebecca said. "Now I need to clean you all up".

  
Noah had haphazardly applied lipstick and compound all over his face. It was a common occurrence apparently. 

  
"How are you going to be QB for the Midshipmen looking like that? Say you kids get your jackets on. Abby will take you to her sledding hill".

  
"I can go with them," Mom said. 

  
Aunt Rebecca put a hand on Mom's forearm. 

  
"Let the kids have some cousin time. Plus, it's a bit of a hike if you don't exercise much". 

  
My Mom looked like she was about to clock Aunt Rebecca. Then she looked at me. 

  
"I'll warm the cocoa up when you get back".  
\--  


**Sleigh Bells Ring. Are Ya Listenin'?** 

  
Ten minutes later we were trudging through the snow. Alan was dragging an inflatable toboggan and I was dragging Uncle Jerry's old sled. Abby was sitting on the toboggan telling Alan to go faster.

  
"Santa's gonna bring you coal you know," Alan said. 

  
"No he's not! I'm gonna tell on you! Santa's gonna bring me presents! More presents than you!"

  
"Y'know," Michelle said, "Santa's not".

  
Alan made a stopping motion with his hand. He wanted Abby to be put in her place, but he didn't want Michelle to say anything that would ruin Christmas. Michelle shrugged.

  
"Yep," Alan continued. "Won't be a cold night this winter. You're gonna get a big ol' pile of coal".

  
"Shut up Alan! Shut up," Abby shouted. 

  
Shut up. The Fuck You of childhood. 

  
Uncle Jerry had strung up a long line of white Christmas lights that lit the way to the sled hill. I don't know if Aunt Rebecca forced him to buy hundreds of feet of lights or if he decided to himself. At least we could see. It was almost night time. 

  
"STOP!"

  
Abby uncrossed her arms and ditched her frowny face. Alan turned around, a disgruntled look on his face. 

  
"What?"

  
"This, is my sledding hill," Abby said. She tried to sound like she was at finishing school or something. 

  
When Aunt Rebecca talked about the sledding hill, we all figured it was where all the kids in the area went. Instead, we found ourselves alone at the top of a steep hill. 

  
There were hay bales that lined the right side of the hill. Wooden stakes kept them in place. The hill bottom was shrouded in darkness.

  
I put Uncle Jerry's sled down so I could get some snow out of my boot. There was a loud crack off in the distance. It was hard to tell the exact location. The sound of a tree limb crashing to the ground followed. 

  
As I was putting my boots on, I heard a swishing sound accompanied by footfalls. 

  
"ABBY'S TURN!!!"

  
Abby took Uncle Jerry's sled and went face first down the hill alone. Her weeeeeee turned into a scream.   
"Come on you two," Michelle said as she dragged to toboggan over. 

  
The three of us got on and followed Abby to the bottom. When we got there, we found her sobbing on top of the sled. 

  
"Why did you do that Abby," Michelle asked. "That's not safe to do".

  
There was a snapping sound of to our left. I scanned the tree line, but there was nothing there. After a few minutes of consoling Abby, we made the long trek to the top of the hill. We managed to convince Abby that she should ride with one of us on the sled, or two of us on the toboggan. 

  
My cousins and I started to have a good time, despite the darkness and Abby's initial behavior. Getting up the hill was a pain, but going down was a blast. 

  
When I went down on the sled face first, I rocketed down the hill. One time I thought I wasn't going to stop. I rolled of off the sled right before it crashed into a tall pine. Fortunate enough, the sled and I both seemed unscathed. After I picked it up, I saw something off in the distance. 

  
It looked like the roots of a fallen tree. There were two large branches that jutted out like spears. My kid mind saw this and immediately thought of horns. I backed away and started up the hill.    


  
"Why do YOU get to ride down face first on Daddy's sled?"

  
Michelle shook her head and Alan rolled his eyes. 

  
"Because Abby, I know how to be safe".

  
"You almost crashed last time!"

  
"Yeah, but I rolled off because I know how to be safe".

&#x200B;

  
For a moment, Abby seemed to back off.

  
"Maybe you're right. Daddy's sled isn't safe for me to go alone".

  
Then an impish grin grew on her face. 

  
"The Toe Boggan is safe though".

  
"Abby No!"

  
There was the swish of her stupid, pink snow suit as she ran towards the toboggan. She started to go downhill, but never bothered to grab the rope or handles to steer. The toboggan went this way and that as it sped down the hill. 

  
Without skipping a beat, Alan jumped onto the sled and went down face first. For a second we thought he would catch up to Abby because he knew to steer. 

  
Alan started to veer off towards the hay bales. Michelle and I shouted to him to slow down but it was no use. A moment later, Alan had crashed into one of the hay bales. Down at the bottom of the hill, Abby had crashed somewhere into the trees. 

  
Michelle and I rolled down the hill. Running would be too difficult in this depth of snow. She rolled down to Abby while I rolled down to Alan. Both of us were dizzy by the time we got to them. 

  
Alan was going back and forth, clutching his right ankle and right wrist. His wrist was bent at an odd angle. 

  
"Are you okay," I asked. 

  
"What the fuck do you think," Alan snapped. 

  
"I know, I'm sorry. Stupid question. Do you think you can walk?"

  
He tried to stand up, but howled in pain before he crashed back to the ground. 

  
"What can I do," I asked him. 

  
"Go down, check on Michelle and Abby. You guys can drag me on the toboggan on the way back".  
"I can't leave you!" 

  
"I'm not going anywhere!"

  
I rolled down the hill to find Michelle trying to comfort Abby. My little cousin was beside herself. There was a hissing sound coming from the toboggan. A large, pointy branch had impaled it eat. Air was leaking out. We weren't going to be dragging Alan back on the toboggan after all. 

  
There was a jingling sound of in the sound coming from the trees. The two large branches I spied before seemed to shift. Steam curled up from the mass below them. 

  
"Come on, we need to get back to Alan".

  
"But what about the Toe Boggan?"

  
"Abby, we can grab it tomorrow. It's dark out and Alan is really hurt".

  
"What's wrong," Michelle asked as she rubbed Abby's back with one hand. 

  
"It's definitely his wrist. But I think it's his ankle too".

  
"Oh shit".

  
"Michelle, you swore!"

  
"Shut the fuck up you brat! Alan's hurt because of you! We said not to go down the hill alone and you did anyway. Now the toboggans wrecked, and Alan probably needs an ambulance. We have to walk back, guided by the longest string of Christmas lights because of you and your mom!"

  
"Michelle, you said the eff word! Shame on you Michelle! I want my toboggan, I wanna go home. NOW!"

  
"We're not taking the toboggan tonight", Michelle said. 

  
I stopped Abby before she could shout any more. 

  
"Maybe, we can still drag Alan on it. Even if there's no air". 

  
Michelle gave me a look, but knew there was no sense in arguing. My idea was somewhat stupid, but it wasn't unreasonable. It would shut Abby up and maybe help Alan as well. 

  
There was another jingling sound back in the trees, accompanied by a grunt. I went to look for the two branches again, but they seemed to have disappeared. 

  
I dragged the toboggan up the hill by its rope. It was heavier than a sack of bricks, but Abby was quiet for now. Alan was moaning when we approached. 

  
"Holy shit, Alan are you okay?" 

  
This time Alan didn't snap at the question. He was too miserable. Abby went to say something about Michelle cursing, but I shook my head. Abby scowled at me. 

  
"Here let's try to get you on the toboggan," I said. 

  
Michelle set Abby down on the ground, then helped me to lift Alan on to the deflated craft. Snowflakes started to drift down so Abby stuck out her tongue to catch them. 

  
I dragged Alan to the top of the hill, while Michelle dragged the sled and with Abby on her shoulders. Abby refused to walk. Michelle looked saintly managing the two burdens. There was more jingling, coming from behind us.

  
"You hear that," I asked.

  
"Hear what," Michelle replied.

  
"I don't hear anything" Abby shouted. 

  
Michelle winced and Alan moaned, telling Abby to stop. 

  
"Let's just get moving," Michelle said. 

  
I looked back but could find the source of the sound. 

  
After a little way down the path, Alan slid off of the toboggan. Michelle and I tried to drag him back on without causing too much pain.

  
"Come on Alan, chop chop! We have to go, NOW!" 

  
"Jesus, Abby can't you give it a rest?"

  
There was a loud grunt, then a growl coming from the shadows about a hundred feet behind us. Then, it sounded like a horse or a bull sprinting towards us from the dark. The sound of jingling bells filled the air. 

  
"Run!"

  
Michelle ditched the sled and grabbed Abby in her arms. I wrapped the rope around my forearm and ran as fast as I could while dragging Alan. We made it about thirty feet when there was a loud cracking noise in the air. 

&#x200B;

Overhead, some sort of cord or rope wrapped around a tree limb. There was another crack, but not like the last one. The limb overhead broke of, landing in our path. The ground shook.

&#x200B;

What turned out to be a whip snapped backwards in the air. Alan was screaming. Abby was sobbing, and Michelle tried desperately to shush her. Then she started to scream too. I turned around to see what frightened them. 

  
A large form, about nine feet tall, strode out of the snow and shadow. Its legs bent backwards like any animal's. Each step caused the earth to shake, and jingle to sound.

&#x200B;

The creature was furry, but I could tell it had a strong frame. The arms were long and muscular, ending with large, clawed hands. Chains hung from the wrists. 

  
What I had mistaken for branches were actual horns, probably two feet long. Something writhed in the shadows. As it drew closer, I could see it was blood red and much like a snake's tongue. It danced in front of a bearded mouth that was filled with large fangs. 

  
Yellow eyes examined us with malevolent joy and a jutting nose sniffed at us. Pointed ears framed the horrible face. The creature smiled at us, it's tongue dancing like a cobra. Its jaw started to move. 

  
The clawed hands coiled a whip. For a moment I thought the creature was wearing a backpack, but it was a basket. The straps reminded me of lederhosen. It threw the whip in the basket. The creature's accessories were strange, but not as strange as what happened next. 

  
The long line of Christmas lights revealed the creature in all its horror. We went silent as it looked us over. I thought the creature was about to hiss at us. 

  
"Guten Abend," the creature said. 

  
\--  
**Have You Been Naughty Or Nice?**

  
The creature's voice resonated in my chest, creating the type of hum you feel instead of hear.  I was terrified by the voice, plus it reminded me of something.  A couple years before, Dad took me to the cinema to see The Neverending Story. 

&#x200B;

One scene that stuck out is when Atreyu talks to Gmork, servant of The Nothing. Gmork was a large wolf with green eyes that shone from the dark cave as he threatened the hero.

  
"How did you like it," Dad asked me as we walked out of Theater 1. 

  


  
"I liked it, I was just".  
"Scared? Was it the two statues with the laser eyes? Or was it the big wolf thing in the cave?"

  
"The big wolf thing," I said with a little shame. 

  
"Well," Dad said clapping my back, "it's okay to be scared. Sometimes it can be fun". 

  
"Really?"

  
Dad stopped in his tracks.

  
"You know, Mom is home sick. She really needs her rest. How about another movie?"

  
"Really?"

  
"Really".

  
Dad took me to the concession stand to get more snacks. He got back before I made it to the front. Lucky for me, because I couldn't really carry everything. 

  
The second movie we watched that afternoon was The Terminator. Arnold Schwarzenegger was imposing enough, but then it turned out he was a robot skeleton with glowing red eyes. Mom was pissed at Dad for a solid week when she found out.

  
"No wonder he's scared. That movie scared ME. Full of senseless violence. And he's too young to be seeing.....boobs".

  
The creature's voice sounded like Arnold Schwarzenegger doing his best Gmork. 

  
"Well, well, well. What have we here? Four children. Some little, some big. All of them out here, shouting on this cold winter's night. I have a question for you. Have you been naughty or nice?"

  
The creature smiled as it examined us with its frightening, yellow eyes. None of us spoke up. 

  
"No one will speak up," it teased. "Hmm."

  
It stroked its beard with a clawed hand. The chains rattled a bit as it did. 

  
"Please," Alan said with a meek voice. "Let us go. We're uh, nice".

  
The creature stepped forward, stooping down to get close to Alan's face. 

  
"Really boy? Then perhaps you and I share a difference in opinion. You see, I happen to know about a certain Biology test. An A+ if I'm not mistaken. Your mother has it on display for all to see. She's so proud of you. But how proud would she be if she knew that the only reason you got that A+ is because YOU CHEATED OFF OF COLLEEN MCKENZIE?"

  
The creature's voice escalated, from calmly explaining the facts to angrily calling out the lie. Alan shivered with fright and cold. 

  
"My Mom won't shut up about that stupid A," Michelle muttered under her breath. 

  
"You," the creature said as pointed a claw at Michelle. 

  
"You have good enough grades girl? Going off to college soon? Yes, but you are not without fault. I know why you like that lotion bottle. I know why you like the shower head. I know they are why you end up late GOING TO MASS! THAT IS A SIN!" 

  
Michelle hung her head and I looked away from the creature. Something sharp brushed my chin. A claw turned my head, putting me face to face with the creature. 

  
"You like comic books," the creature asked with a gentle voice.

  
Hot tears started to stream down my cheeks as I nodded. 

  
"Ya. The Batman and The Spiderman and all the heroes. There are some good morals in those comic books. Not as good as your schoolbooks or the Good Book. But you study for your tests, and you make it to church on time".

  


  
I nodded again, but the claw pushed against my chin to stop me.   
"Then tell me boy, why is it that a boy who studies, gets to church on time, and loves superheroes, thinks it's okay, to go to the store AND STEAL THE COMICS!!"

  
"Leave him alone," Michelle said. 

  
"It's just comic books," Alan said. 

  
With lightning-fast reflex, the creature produced a switch from its basket and struck both cousins with one fluid motion. Drops of blood dotted the snow as it swung the switch back into the basket. They clutched their bleeding cheeks. 

  
"You are naughty children," the creature said. 

  
Abby had been surprisingly quiet during the whole encounter, but finally decided to break her silence. 

  
"Pwease, I want to go home," she said, adding a little tremble to the lip to sell it. 

  
The creature approached her, examining her with a skeptical gaze. 

  
"Do you think I believe this ruse child? Are you cleverer than me?"

  
Somehow the creature's laughter was as frightening as its accusations.

  
"Your youth, your size, they mean nothing to me. I punish all children, regardless of their age or size".

  
Despite Michelle's best efforts, Abby managed to wriggle out of her cousin's arms. She stood in front of the creature. 

  
"You don't punish children you stupid, poopy head. Santa Claus does. He leaves you coal if you're bad, and I'm GOOD!"

  
The creature stepped back and laughed a horrible laugh. It then placed a hoof on Alan's chest and with another blurred motion, cracked its whip, wrapping it around Michelle. She and Alan struggled to get free.  


  
"You couldn't stop me if you wanted children, but I thought perhaps I would make it easier for you".

  
The creature grinned, its restless tongue dancing. It grabbed Abby and me by the forearms. Claws tore through our sleeves and into our flesh. Blood ran down our arms to our shoulder blades. 

  
"I'm leaving with at least one of you children, maybe both. The question remains, who will come with me?" 

  
Searing pain shot through my arm. It took all of my effort to stay conscious. I thought of every issue of Batman and Spiderman I stole. I thought about the packed lunches I'd thrown out, and the borrowed toys I never returned. I envisioned the library books collecting dust God knows where because I never returned them. 

  
"I'M SORRY!"

  
The words roared out of me like a force of nature. I fell to the ground. Hot blood melted the snow under my hand. When I looked up, I saw the creature looking at Abby with anticipation. 

  
"LET ME GO! LET ME GO! YOU'RE JUST A BIG STUPID GOAT WITH A BACKPACK! YOU CAN TAKE ALL OF MY COUSINS!"

  
"No child," the creature said with a smile. "It's Abby's Turn".

  
With another fluid motion, the creature pulled a burlap sack out of its basket and threw Abby in. She started to squeal in terror and insult the creature, so it swung the burlap sack hard into a nearby tree. When she squealed again, the creature swung the sack into the tree three more times. 

  
The sack had darkened red when the creature threw it over its shoulder and into the basket. Abby's squealing was a faint moan now. My cousins were still trapped, and I was woozy from my loss of blood. The creature turned its back on us but looked over its shoulder one last time. 

  
"Remember children. Be good." the creature said as he released the whip.

  
It grinned a devilish grin and took off down the path. As it ran into the night, we saw just how fast it moved. The creature could've easily overtaken us before. There was never any chance of outrunning it. It was just toying with us. 

  
Michelle collapsed sobbing to the ground. Her free arms sprawled out she wept into the earth. Tiny rivulets of blood parted the pure white snow. Puffs of steam shot up from Alan's mouth as he struggled to breathe. A pool of blood had formed under me. Then I lost consciousness. 

  
\--

  
**Blue Christmas**

  
Our parents came and got us when they came to check out the downed Christmas lights. When they asked about Michelle and Alan's faces, they both said it must have been a tree branch. Mom nearly lost it when she saw my arm. Dad ran back to Uncle Jerry's to call 911. 

  
Aunt Rebecca lost her mind when she couldn't find Abby. She tried to blame us for Abby's disappearance, saying that we were jealous and wanted to get rid of her. Our moms told her that was insane, that we would never hurt Abby. 

&#x200B;

Years later, Mom said Abby wouldn't have disappeared if Aunt Rebecca hadn't insisted on "Cousin Time" being unsupervised. She never blamed us though.

  
A parade of flashing lights came to Uncle Jerry's. We were taken to the hospital to be treated. Cops and rescue workers searched the woods for Abby. They searched for a week, but never found her. Hoof prints are all that they found.  

  
All of this was explained to me when I woke up in the hospital. I had to undergo a massive blood transfusion. My arms were stitched up so much I looked like Frankenstein's monster. Later on, a deputy asked me what happened in the woods. 

  
"We were attacked".

  
"Attacked by what?"

  
"An animal. It chased us all the way from the bottom of the sledding hill. It was hiding in the woods, watching us".

  
"What kind of animal was it?"

  
"It was big, with black fur. It had claws and fangs. Yellow eyes. Yellow eyes."

  
"Was it a wolf or a big cat?"

  
I hesitated.

  
"A wolf, I think. It took Abby. Michelle tried to save her".

  
The deputy eyed me with a skeptical look. I looked down.

  
"Will that be all deputy," Dad asked. 

  
"For now".

  
I never saw the deputy again. 

  
When we headed back to Uncle Jerry's, Aunt Rebecca was chucking suitcases and presents onto the driveway.

  
"You people aren't family! You're animals! My baby is missing and you're just sitting there at the fucking hospital doing nothing!"

  
An argument ensued among the grown-ups. After a ten-minute shouting match, Uncle Jerry ushered Aunt Rebecca inside. The other adults picked everything up off the driveway and packed it into our cars. That was the last time we were invited to Uncle Jerry's.

  
A few weeks later it was Christmas Eve. No one was in the spirit. We didn't drink cocoa or eat cookies. Despite our Christmas tree, bubble lights, and candles, the darkness seemed to seep in from outside. When I went to sleep that night, I heard a rata tat tat on my bedroom window. I was too terrified to look. 

  
That Christmas, my parents and Ol' Saint Nick brought me even more presents than usual. I liked them, but I didn't have the feeling of a "kid on Christmas morning". As I cleaned up, I noticed a package wrapped in black paper with a silver ribbon. It was for my parents from K. 

  
I took the package to them. My parents gave each other a puzzled look. Dad pulled away the silver ribbon and tore at the paper. Inside was a bundle of birch rods wrapped in another silver ribbon. A small black envelope was fastened to the top. Inside there was a note addressed to my parents. The note read:

&#x200B;

  
Frohe Weihnachten,

  
If your son is ever dishonest, rowdy, disrespectful, or worst of all THEIVING, I invite you to employ the use of these fine birch rods I have gifted you. They are especially effective on the knuckles or backside. In cases of severe mischief use sparingly on the face. While your son's behavior may not reflect the values you impart him, remember the old Proverb. "Spare the rod, spoil the child".

  
Grüße,

  
Krampus

It took us a couple of Christmases before anyone felt the joy of the holiday again. Nobody cared for Abby really, but what happened was a tragedy all the same. 

  
My aunts and uncles had received birch bundles just like my parents. When Aunt Rebecca called to accuse us of stealing Abby's Christmas presents, she was accused of sending out the rods. It was the last we heard from Aunt Rebecca.  

  
I still get together with my parents for Christmas. My wife passed, but I've got a son in college who joins us. Every few years Aunt Shelly and Uncle George fly in to celebrate with us. We often go to holiday parties for The Chicago Public Library Foundation. I make a sizable donation every year, even though I don't read really. 

&#x200B;

  
Michelle is out of contact. She never did go to college. Instead, she joined a convent and became a nun. Nobody heard much after that. Danny doesn't talk to her, and Aunt Cindy and Uncle Michael died in a car crash back in 93. Michael's brother adopted Danny.

  
Uncle Jerry still sends Christmas cards. He and Dad do lunch in secret sometimes. Aunt Rebecca would be furious. She always blamed the rest of us for losing Abby. We were disowned that December. 

  
Noah reaches out from time to time. He joined the Navy, but he was never the QB for the Midshipmen. Instead, Noah started dating the QB. His parents didn't take that well, so Noah and his boyfriend moved out to Portland, Oregon. 

  
It seems the childhood makeup mistakes were anything but. Noah is part of a Drag troupe that does two shows daily, three on weekends. He has a great sense of humor. It probably helps he didn't have all the details of Abby's story.  

  
Alan is a tenured professor at Columbia University. He's well respected in the field of Biology. Both his colleagues and his students admire his work ethic and intellect.  His wife left him, but he spends Christmas with his son and daughter. Sometimes he visits me in the summer. Never near the holidays. He wouldn't dare.

  
The city is aglow with the holiday spirit. Families line the streets around Marshall Fields (forgive me, Macy's) to see holiday window displays. They aren't as good as they once were, but people go all the same. 

  
Shoppers walk down Michigan Avenue, clutching their bags and talking on phones, almost too occupied to notice the twinkling lights above them. 

  
Salvation Army Santas ring along with the landmark churches in a bid to inspire pedestrians to join in with the giving spirit of the season. 

  
People skate, marvel at the city's tree, and visit the wreathed lion statues at the Art Institute of Chicago. 

  
In Daley Plaza, people from all over squeeze into the Yule clusterfuck that is Christkindlmarket. The smells of cinnamon and meatballs fight against the acrid odors of city life. Little German style huts fill the plaza, offering glass ornaments, steins, and pretzels. 

  
Among the wares you will see the frightening visage of a horned best with a basket on its back. Children scream from inside, begging to get out. That is, if the artisan hasn't made the monster cute. 

  
In recent years everything from Christkindlmarket to Hollywood, marketers have done their best to inject the creature into modern culture. They're unaware it's already here. 

&#x200B;

They make it funny or darling.  It stars in movies that range from hilarious to tacky. Its image is printed upon everything from artwork, to mugs and greeting cards. 

&#x200B;

The creature has been a part lore throughout Europe for centuries. They too, have commercialized the beast.

  
If they knew what I knew, they wouldn't try to make this ancient terror a part of our modern zeitgeist. They wouldn't trivialize it to sell beer or DVD's. To them it's all make believe. 

  
They've never felt its claws tear through their flesh. Nor have they seen a screaming child in a burlap sack beaten against a tree and spirited away. 

  
Alan knows and when he calls, we'll skirt the subject. We'll exchange pleasantries, ask about the kids, talk about work. Then we'll drift on to Abby. 

  
The little brat who laughed when she ruined my birthday by stretching my brand-new Stretch Armstrong so much, his neck was permanently lop-sided. The girl who ruined Michelles graduation dress and poured a full TAB on to Alan's NES. 

  
We'll complain, then we'll go quiet. We remember every, gory detail. 

  
Marketing agencies can laugh all they want. They never saw what we did that cold winter's night back in 1986. They'll never feel that chill down their spine, when Christmas Eve rolls around. The rata tat tat I heard on the second story of my childhood home has somehow managed to visit the window of my apartment on the twenty third floor. 

  
I'm not saying you should lose the spirit of Christmas. No, keep it in your heart if you can, every bit of it. 

&#x200B;

I say if you find yourself in the woods on the night of December 5th, you better watch out.
