Hey Guys,   
  
I need to share something bizarre that happened to me, which I've been unable to get out of my head! I was also thinking if I should post this or not. I experienced a time slip, and it's as puzzling today as it was then. 

I was parked outside my parents' house with my sister. She left the car to head inside, and as she did, I took a look at the car dashboard and it was EXACTLY 1AM.  
  
That's the last normal moment I remember because what happened next is something I still don't have an explanation for till this day! 

  
I AM SUDDENLY in my street where I live, which is about a 25-minute drive from my parents' house. I wasn't right in front of my house, but close enough to see it.  I could hear people cheering loudly in the background, like im being in the middle of a live World Cup soccer game!  
  
To my left, there was this orange, energy-like orb floating near the ground, almost as if it was going to to race me. and on my right side im looking and im seeing an old man in a huge, long weird some kind of magician looking robe.  He was counting down loudly, starting from five... down to one. and I swear on everything that is dear to me, I still remember when he was counting down!  
5 ... 4 .... 3.... 2.... 



and when he came to 1 

and said it .. 

1 .. ...... BAMM !!!  


I HEAR THIS LOUD BANG ON MY CAR WINDOW AND IM LOOKING AROUND AND I SEE A COP POINTING HIS FLASHLIGHT AT MY FACE AND SHOUTING:  
  
ARE YOU SLEEPING BEHIND THE WHEEL?  
GET OUT OF THE CAR !! NOW !!  
  
Now, I’m looking at this police officer and realizing that I’m literally in front of a police station, right on the road, with my car still in drive mode (D). This is about 25 minutes from my parents' place and maybe 5 minutes away from where I live. I looked at my dashboard and it was 5 AM—  
  
4 HOURS JUST DISAPPEARED LIKE THAT !! 

  
And there I was, standing there, just shocked!  
Looking at the officer that is asking me all these questions! why am I here? where are you going ? did you sleep? are u on drugs ? etc ...  
  
and I am Just completely FLABBERGASTED !!  
  
im looking around at the officer, and looking around me! and as if I noticed that There were no cars, no people, nobody in sight,  I was literally standing on the road in the middle exactly in front of the police station !!  
  
4 hours LATER !!   
  
That thing I saw with the old man and the orb lasted only maybe 5 seconds, at least in my head or how I experienced it. So I don't know how I got to slip 4 hours ?  
  
I look at my phone and see that I got like a 100  missed calls from my wife, maybe another 100 from my parents, and various other calls from friends that my wife had woken up in the middle of the night to ask if they know anything! 

I don’t know if I should go on or ?  
  
I’ve been thinking about this every single day and this happened to me 10 months ago ! and till this day I still can't find an answer to what happened.  
  
Whenever I tell someone, they look at me like I’m crazy or possessed! If anybody knows anything or how, PLEASE tell me as im dying to get answers !!  
  
Thank you guys !  
  
Anybody tell me what happened, please? I'm dying to get any answers!
