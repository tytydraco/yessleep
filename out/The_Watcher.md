Washington state greeted me with gray skies and a biting chill that crept through my uniform no matter how many layers I wore. My first duty station: a naval base tucked deep into the trees near Puget Sound. It was remote. Quiet. Important.

Our job was to guard the submarines. Not just any subs—nuclear ones. The kind that could end the world a few times over if given the chance. That reality weighed on me, but we didn’t talk about it. We just patrolled.

The base was massive, but one place stood out above the rest: the pier.

A steel giant that jutted out into the bay, bristling with cranes, lights, and mooring gear. It was a vital artery of the base. But something about it always felt wrong, especially when night fell. Like it was watching us

At first, the pier seemed like any other part of the base—just more concrete, more noise. During the day, it was chaos. Civilian contractors bustled around in hard hats and reflective vests. Forklifts beeped as they carted supplies. Sparks flew from welders. Boats groaned as they were loaded and unloaded. There was a rhythm to it all, a predictable hum.

But once the sun dipped below the horizon, everything changed.

The workers vanished like they were never there. The machinery fell silent. And the only sound left was the distant lapping of water against the pilings. The lights overhead buzzed faintly, barely strong enough to push back the thick fog that rolled in from the bay.

That’s when the pier revealed its true self.

I hated drawing night duty out there. The silence wasn’t peaceful—it was oppressive. It pressed in on you, made your heart beat louder, your senses sharper. You’d catch yourself turning around suddenly, sure you’d heard footsteps or whispers. But there was never anyone there.



I’d only been at the base a few weeks when they brought it up. We were sitting in the back of a Humvee, killing time between shifts. The team leader leaned in with a grin.

“You heard about the tunnels under the pier?”

I shook my head.

He exchanged a look with the other guy—Corporal Reyes. “It’s tradition. Every new guy goes down there and writes his name on the wall. Right of passage.”

I didn’t ask questions. You don’t when you’re the new guy. You just nod and play along.

That night, around 0200, we parked the Humvee near the far edge of the pier—where the concrete cracked and weeds pushed through the seams. The others moved with practiced ease, brushing aside an old tarp covering a rusted manhole cover.

Reyes grabbed a crowbar and popped it open with a grunt. Cold air whooshed up from the dark.

“Ready?” he asked, handing me a flashlight and a Sharpie.

Not really. But I nodded anyway.

The ladder groaned under our weight as we climbed down, one by one, into the narrow shaft. The air grew colder with every rung. Damp. Heavy. It smelled like rust and rot, oil and old seawater.

The tunnel at the bottom was barely tall enough to stand in. Pipes ran along the ceiling, dripping occasionally. Stray wires dangled in places, and a series of yellowed bulbs lined the corridor—most of them dead, a few barely flickering.

Our footsteps echoed far too loud. Water puddled underfoot. The deeper we went, the less I could hear from above. The surface world seemed to vanish, replaced by this buried underworld of concrete and silence.

Finally, we reached a section where the tunnel opened slightly—a wall ahead covered in layers of names. Dozens of them. Some scratched in with knives, others written with markers, faded by time and water.

The guys laughed and pointed out old buddies’ names. I crouched near an empty corner of the wall and uncapped my marker.

That’s when I saw him.


A figure stood at the far end of the tunnel.

Half in shadow. Still. Watching.

He wore a reflective vest and a hard hat. A civilian worker, it seemed. But something felt off. His clothes looked wrong—too clean. Too still. Like they weren’t affected by the cold draft that was brushing against my own skin.

I stared at him for what felt like a full minute. He didn’t move. Didn’t speak. Just stood there, motionless, like a statue.

“Do you guys see that?” I whispered.

The laughter stopped. I turned and saw that my seniors were still facing the wall, oblivious.

When I looked back, he was gone.

I blinked. Scanned the darkness. Nothing. Just a stretch of tunnel and the flicker of a dying light.

I scribbled my name quickly, heart hammering in my chest, and followed the others back toward the ladder.


Back in the vehicle, I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

The silence. The way he just stood there. 

I waited until we were driving off before I asked. “Hey… I thought nobody was allowed in the tunnels?”

Reyes gave me a confused look. “They’re sealed off. Only way in is that manhole.”

I hesitated. “Then… who was the guy watching us?”

He didn’t answer. The team leader turned in his seat slowly. His expression was blank, pale.

“You saw him too?” he asked quietly.

I nodded.

The Humvee was dead silent for the rest of the ride.

Later, I heard rumors. About a civilian who fell during construction. Crushed by a pipe. Another who drowned when the pump system failed. Nothing official. Nothing confirmed. But people talked—quietly, always at night.

I never went near that manhole again.
