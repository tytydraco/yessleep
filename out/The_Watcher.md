“Please open your books to page 317”, the psychology teacher shouted over the chattering class. “Today we will be learning about the different types of mental illnesses and the history of each one”.

The talking died down as the teacher rambled on. I looked out the second story window. Most of the trees were bare like dark skeletons, much of their leaves being rounded up by the school maintenance crew. The earlier students were already leaving classes and were starting to assemble outside. The last rays of the sun shined down on them. Moms and dads showed up and the school buses were rolling in. In the distance an odd man in a top hat and a black trench coat pushed through the kids toward the school. I couldn’t see his face. No one seemed to notice him as he patted a few kids on their heads.

“A strange fellow”, I exclaimed.

Unfortunately, I spoke too loudly because Ms. Tagmire shouted, “Theresa! Perhaps you would like to start us off on our first disorder or is my lecture too boring for you that you continue to gaze out that window”. I remained silent, breaking my gaze from the window and avoiding her eyes. “Schizophrenia is our first topic, so pay attention”. She continued, “…psychotic…hallucinations…cognitive impairment…”. I shyly peered back out the window, but the man was gone. The sky had darkened and there was murmuring outside the classroom. There were still 10 minutes left until the end of class. The noise died down outside the classroom and Ms. Tagmire seemed a little less agitated about any additional distractions for her students when a silhouette appeared in the blurry classroom door window. It looked like a bird, but with a beak too large for its head.

DRRRRRrrrrrrr!

That was the classroom bell. The sound to pack up. I gathered my things and made my way out into the hallway. It felt darker than usual. No matter, I made my way down the stairs and into the courtyard where I found it empty.

“Huh!?” I murmured, as I made my way to the gate.

The street was dark, except for a lamp post at the end of each block. I made my way home down the sidewalk listening to the clickity clack of my hard soled school shoes. I could be a tap dancer I thought as I tapped my shoes faster in a flurry. I continued to walk listening to my shoes when I picked up a thudding sound that matched each step of my feet. I turned around and stopped, peering into the eerie light of the lamp post on the far corner of the street. The thudding also stopped, but just one step later than mine. The houses around me were all dark just like the sky. I could barely make out their silhouettes as they blended into the night. Not a soul in sight, except for the trench coat man… I stared at him, and he stared back. Pitch black was his color beneath the light from the lamp post. He had a dark mask of a bird and a top hat to match. A plague doctor I thought. I stood there for a second too long as he cut the distance between us in half. His stride was wide, and the thudding of his boots no longer matched mine. As I ran and started to lose my breath, I spoke, “Shortcut! You need to take a shortcut”. I cut into an alley two blocks away from my house. It was dark. There were no lights.

“What the hell?” I exclaimed.

I had been down this alley before. It just didn’t feel the same. Using my hands to feel each trash can and car I encountered, I suddenly smacked my face against a wall. The pain seared through me, and I could taste copper off my lip. I picked myself up off the ground.

“No… no… no…” I whispered.

To think I had gone down the wrong alleyway. The thudding got louder and closer. I hid behind a trash can. I could almost feel the pounding sound of his boots in my skull. My head started to ache with each beat of my heart. A shiver went down my spine, and I felt a pat on my head.

“NOOO! GET AWAY!” I screamed at the top of my lungs.

“Theresa! Is that you?”.

I looked up. It was my neighbor Bill, with his pet Pomeranian. He was dressed in a coat and had rain boots on. With his flashlight in my face, he said, “Look at you. You’re bleeding and all wet. Let us get you home. Thank goodness me and Fido here decided to delay our walk today”. He lifted his jacket over me to keep me out of the rain. I hadn’t even noticed it had started raining. We made our way home. I could see the lights on at my house. Mom was probably making something to eat, since the aroma of cabbage and sausage made its way out the side window that she always opened to air out her cooking. Bill led me to the door and looked back until I shut the door after myself. Mom was in the kitchen and heard me come in.

“How was your day, honey? You’re a little late today”.

“Sorry, Mom. It was all dark and I must have gotten lost” I exclaimed.

“Yeah, changing back from daylight savings time will do that. It gets darker quicker now. Go freshen up. Dinner is almost ready”.

I made my way to the bathroom to clean up. I didn’t want to show mom that I had gotten hurt. Closing the door behind me, I turned on the faucet and rinsed my hands. They were so dirty. While reaching for the soap, the light turned off. Annoyed, I felt my way toward the door and opened it.

“Mom?... Mom?... Why are the lights off?”

No answer. It was quiet outside the bathroom, and it was dark. I closed the door and turned around feeling for the faucet to turn off the water. Steadying my gaze before the sink, the lights abruptly turned on. I looked into the mirror and stared at the trench coat man. His eyes a scarlet red behind the goggles of the mask. His beak glistening under the bathroom light. A red teardrop hanging off its pointed end. He reached out with a black gloved hand as I reached out with my hand. I shouted and pounded the mirror with my palm. First with one, then with both. I hit and hit and hit until I felt a weakness in my arms. I stepped back and slumped down against the wall behind me. Looking up, the mirror was shattered to pieces. The trench coat man was gone and there was silence. The lights flickered and I gazed at the splinters of the mirror embedded in my wrists. Blood was oozing down my fingers and pooling on the tiles where I sat. I pressed my eyes closed and heard thudding coming closer and getting louder from the other side of the bathroom door. The door swung open. I looked up and opened my teary eyes.

“Theresa!” Ms. Tagmire shouted. “What the hell is wrong with you?”

“You have been screaming and scratching yourself for the better part of ten minutes. Thank God you finally calmed down” she exclaimed.

I peered around to see myself back in the classroom. Everyone’s gaze fixed upon me. Some faces even had a look of disgust. Embarrassed, I looked down at my scratched wrists laid upon my book. I shifted my arms and saw the image of a plague doctor. On the next page in bold black words,

“Schizophrenia is a mental illness in which you can’t tell what’s real from what’s imagined.”
