There is a man, or more so a creature, that stands on the edge of reality. He would always appear in your peripheral vision, always remaining out of focus. He was the watcher.

He was a chubby, pale creature not much was known about him in our local lore. He always carried around an umbrella; the kids theorized he was a vampire. Some said they would spot him with the most beautiful butterfly ever seen on his hand. The stories always ended the same way. Once he was seen and the person took a double take at him, he would be gone. No reason ,no purpose to his existence.

Many feared the watcher; some said he was a peaceful being. I always found the stories childish and stupid.  I thought people were just begging for attention by telling them. That was, of course, until I was 17 years old.


At the time, I was in 11th grade and living in a small town in Oregon. It was an ordinary sunny day. I got onto the school bus and was instantly hit in the face by a paper ball. It came from my best friend Tyler.

“Fuck you, Tyler,” I said as he chuckled.

“When,” he responded sarcastically.

“When I'm done with your mom, bitch,” we both laughed.

I sat next to Tyler and he started telling me about how he was going to ask out Sara after 4th period today. I told him, as the great friend I am, that she was going to reject him and he was stupid.

“4th period is PE, bro. You're going to be musty as hell.”

“Well, she will get the natural Tye.”

“I don’t think she wants that, bro.” I responded. “Plus she has a lot going on man. She found a homeless guy OD’d on her porch like 3 days ago. That type of shit is traumatizing man.”

She tried to resuscitate the man when she found him. He threw up blood on her and then died. His blood was stained on her hands and arms for days.


“I’ve talked to her since then she seems fine” Tyler confidently said 


“What ever bro ,just seems like horrible timing. With dead bodies and your gonna be smelling like one after a whole period of basketball ,Ik your ass don’t wear no deodorant”

He punched me in the shoulder and told me to stop being a hater. He punched me pretty hard. I turned towards the bus window and just looked out and watched as we passed. I was always fascinated watching objects as we passed them by in a moving vehicle. The whole world blurred. I felt as if I was in a rocket ship passing through the world. At times I would imagine there was a monster running alongside, but of course, I knew monsters weren’t real. Well, I thought they weren’t.


As we continued to drive, we turned onto a long road. The last road before school. We drove on this road for about 15 minutes. It was a long, straight, and narrow road. No turns, no curves. Completely surrounded by trees on all sides. These were huge trees. They were so tall they created a sort of canopy over the road from where their tops touched over the road.

This road scared me. Even as an older teen, I would get freaked out about this road. I imagined what would happen if we broke down. There was no service out here on phones. My mind would then wander and scare myself. I convinced myself if we broke down people that lived in the woods would come and hunt us down. I probably just watched “The Wrong Turn” too many times.

After driving about halfway down the road and me still staring out the window is when I saw something out of the corner of my eye up ahead. It looked like a black blob from a distance. As we got closer, I noticed it was holding something. An umbrella. I turned to get Tye’s attention.

“Bro, look,” I pointed up ahead.

“What am I looking at?”

“The watcher.”

“There is nothing there, dude, you're crazy.”

I turned around and looked, and there was nothing where I saw him. I thought maybe I convinced myself I saw something that wasn’t there. It did make sense. I was already freaked out about that road, and I recently overheard kids talking about him. So I calmed myself down. As I did, it started raining, which was weird because it had been completely sunny with no signs of bad weather. The bus pulled into the school and we all went about our day.

After school ended, I got back on the bus. There was a weird energy in the bus. Seats which are usually full of life and loud teenagers cussing and screaming were now filled with frowning, gloomy, soulless-looking kids. As Tye got on the bus, he shared the same expression as the other kids. I asked him what was going on.

“After gym, when I went to go meet with Sara, she never showed up.”

“That’s it? The whole bus is sad because you got stood up?”

“No, let me finish, you idiot. She never showed up to meet me. She never showed up to 5th period. The school called her parents and she isn’t home. Mr. Keller (our principal) checked the security cameras; she went to her locker, grabbed everything out of it, and put an object wrapped in a garbage bag into it then left the school. Like she just walked out the front door, went down that creepy fucking road, and just vanished into the woods. When they went to check her locker, all that was in there was a torn-up trash bag with an umbrella inside.”

 When he said the umbrella, my heart dropped, and I felt a type of fear I never felt before. Something in me told me to look out the window. We were now on that road. It was storming heavily. Winds were shifting the bus. All I saw was water hitting the window. I couldn’t even respond to Tyler. I was at a loss for words. Suddenly, I heard a loud screech and was thrust into the seat in front of me. Tyler landing on top of my lap. We all looked up to see why Mrs. Patterson slammed on the brakes so suddenly. There was Sara. Standing in the middle of the road. She was pale, emotionless, just standing there in the storm not moving a muscle. I looked back towards my side window and as I did, the rain stopped, and the most beautiful blue butterfly I had ever seen landed on the window. He wasn’t just watching anymore. 


The butterfly flew away and haphazardly drifted in the winds towards the tree-line. That’s when I noticed the trees were shaking as if something large was coming. Time stood still ,I then felt the embodiment of dread. He appeared out of the tree and reached his hand out ,straight and stiff as a cadaver. The butterfly landed on the back of his hand as he stroke down the side of his umbrella. I finally got a clear look of him. He was grotesque ,extremely pale ,and obese human looking creature. He had a face the resembled a baby ,but with solid pale blue beady eyes. He had no noise and a long crooked smile that stretched around his entire face.  He wore a dark black trench coat. 

The rain had now stopped ,the sun was now up and the heat beat was beating on us through the windows. In an instant it from a hurricane to the sky being complete clear accept the rain continued over him. He had a dark cloud over his head ,even on a sunny day. What must of been merely seconds felt like an eternity. I couldn’t take my eyes off of him. I swear I must of blinked ,but in that fraction of a second he was gone. I don’t know if anyone else noticed him ,but I did. I was disturbed. I looked back to the front of the bus and I saw Mrs. Patterson walking back in with Sara. She looked normal. She was confused and claimed to not rember anything. She just blacked out and woke up here. 
        

I was afraid to ask anyone if they saw him. I still am ,but I know what I saw. I am not crazy. We all continued home normally. All the other kids were trying to get information from Sara. I sat quiet with my head buried into the seat in front of me. I was too afraid to even catch a glimpse out of the window. I went home and told my mother everything that happened with Sara that day. I did not mention him. I was too afraid to even say his name. I didn’t want to think about him ,but he engraved himself into my thoughts. Every thought I had he found himself sneaking in. I was afraid to look out of windows. I was afraid to look into mirrors. I was a nervous wreck. The school concluded Sara had an anxiety attack. I didn’t buy that for one second. 

 

As some time passed and no sightings happened and stories about him were slowly weeded out of life. We were young adults becoming real adults. I don’t know what I saw ,but as months went by I was able to return to my normal mental state. Ty and Sara were dating through all this. Ty invited me to his house for a dinner with him and Sara. His mom was a fantastic cook ,so I obliged knowing I’d have to third wheel. We all arrived around 7:00 PM. His mom cooked shrimp scampi. We were all eating joking and having a good time. Until out of no wheres Sara stood up. She twitched her eyes turned a solid blue pale.

“Do you love me Ty” she asked in a deep raspy almost shout.

“Of of of course I do” Tyler muttered nervously. His voice was felt with fear.

“You have one chance to confess your sins” Sara demanded. Her voice turning deeper. “5……4……3”
  
“Baby ,what are you talking about” Tyler was able to say in a deflating tone. 


Sara kept counting “2….1……you had your chance to confess your sins to the messenger. He knows. I know. And now she knows. He is always watching “

Sara then proceeded to grab a fork from the table and plunge it at her face. Right before the moment the fork made contact with eye ,her eyes flickered back to normal. Blood splattered all over Tyler. Tyler’s parents rushed Sara to the nearest hospital. She refused to see Tyler or let him near her. She got security to escort him out of the hospital. 

“Man i don’t know what is happening” Tyler cried to me on the ride home. “She snapped” 

I didn’t know what to say. I patted him on the shoulder and looked out the window. My stomach dropped. There was a blue butterfly on the glass of the window. I heard Ty’s mom scream.



SKRRRT

I woke up upside down ,everything was fuzzy ,all I could smell and taste was smoke. There was blood. A lot of blood. I don’t know if it was mine or not. I turned to see Tyler with the same blue eyes as I seen Sara and him with before. I looked out through the broken glass and saw what I saw months ago. Him ,watching. The same smile. The same pose. Stroking his umbrella with the butterfly on his hand. I passed out. 



When I woke up I saw the inside of a hospital room. I later found out that the blood from before wasn’t mine. It was Tyler’s. His mom said a man just appeared in the road. She could only describe him as pale and overweight. I large piece of glass that shattered from the impact flew into Tyler’s groin area. Slicing his scrotum in half. He was put into a wheelchair.  



 Now this is where I must confess my sins. When I woke up I saw a hospital room. I was not inside said hospital room. I was trapped and was going to die in the accident ,but he saved me. He explained everything to me. He is The Watcher. He is always Watching. He knows are sins. Sara actually saw that homeless man before that. He begged and begged for her to call 911. She locked the door out of fear and did nothing to save him. She did not make any sort of contact until her was already dead. She saw everything. That’s why she lost her eyes. Unfortunately ,that wasn’t any ordinary homeless man. He was a messenger. He has dozens of them everywhere watching and relaying info back to him. You become a messenger by coming in contact with the blood of one. Sara became one. She gave Tyler the chance to confess his sins. Tyler was unfaithful. So ,he lost his penis. The watcher showed Sara every woman Tyler has sex with. When her eyes flickered the messenger took over that’s all she could see. Her blood splattered on Tyler. So when the car accident occurred and his blood got on me I became one. He took me to where he lives. I got to confess my sins and make them right. All those months ago when I saw him. I should have said something. I should have warned people. I let my fear consume me. This is my repentance. He is coming. More of us are coming everyday. Save yourself and confess to him. My sins were my cocoon. I have freed from them like many others have not and become his butterfly. I am him. He is us. We are always watching.
