I know everyone at school will make fun of me for this if they find out, but I have to tell someo- something. I have always struggled with sleep paralysis, I have talked to countless doctors and therapists but nothing seems to prevent/stop it. Recently it got worse. Every night I wake up between the hours of 1 AM and 3AM and have sleep paralysis. I have always had a wide variety of sleep "monsters"

&#x200B;

but recently I have only been seeing the same one. He, or well It...appears to be a human wearing all black at first glance, but upon further inspection he- it only has one eye. His eye is glowing white. When I first saw it in my episodes of sleep paralysis, it would only stand in the corner of my room, staring at me, as still as a statue. Not unusual. But as time went on, I saw him even more. Always getting an inch or two closer to me laying in my bed. I last saw him about a week ago, in my last sleep paralysis episode. But now I have started seeing him in the outside world. In the mirror, on the bus, in busy crowds and in school...Maybe I'm just on edge, but I stopped seeing him in my dreams altogether, but started seeing him outside of my dreams? I'm not sure what's going on, But I'll just have to wait and see

&#x200B;

Until Next Time, If there is one.

Today while my family and I were eating dinner, I looked down at my phone for merely a second, and then I looked up, and he was there, at the other end of our dinner table, starring at me. Holding a fork, He was holding it but was still maintaining perfect eye contact with me. It felt like an eternity, when it broke eye contact and looked at the fork. The next moment he stabbed himself in his eye. I fell out of my chair because of blood splattering all over me. The next moment I woke up in my bed. I'm not sure if I am going crazy or something, I can't take this anymore.

&#x200B;

Goodbye, For now.

Remember when he stabbed himself in the eye? Yeah, well, I saw him again. This time his eye was glowing, like usual but yellow and there was blood running out of his eye. Why Me. I really can't take this anymore. He follows me. He watches me. He is always there. In the shadows. In your closet and under your bed. The Watcher always watches.

Dear diary

This is my last entry in this, During my latest episode, he started talking, some of it was inaudible, but I could still make out most of the spoken words. It's speech is as follows: (Sobbing) (inaudible) I am Always there, In the shadows, In your closet, (inaudible) The Watcher. Always. Watches.
