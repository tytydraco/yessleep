The Watcher’s eyes are always on me. I don’t know where he came from, and I don’t know why he chose me, but I see him everywhere. He’s in the dark corners of my room at night, in the reflections in my window, sometimes even in the hollow, empty eyes of my own reflection. There’s nowhere I can hide from him. He’s there, and he wants something. He says he’s only trying to save us. I’ve tried to argue. I’ve tried reasoning with him, pleading, explaining that I can’t do these things. But he just laughs, a low, guttural sound that slithers into my bones.

“*It’s already coming apart, can’t you see?*” he whispered the first time. He told me the world was fractured, like glass ready to shatter, and only I could keep it from breaking. But his price—it’s too much. I never wanted to hurt anyone, never wanted to feel this...this sickness creeping up my spine, burning through my veins like poison. But The Watcher tells me it’s the only way to keep the cracks from spreading.

And so, I did what he said. But after, when it was done, the shame was like a weight pressing on my chest, crushing the air out of my lungs. It felt like a terrible fever breaking. My hands still shook as I looked down at Claire, her lifeless body sprawled beneath me on the pavement, her open eyes staring through me, empty. I don’t even remember how I did it—my hands had moved on their own, guided by his commands. I’d barely known her, just a classmate, someone who’d smiled at me in passing, and yet he’d chosen her as if she were important. As if her life, taken by my hands, was part of some greater purpose I couldn’t understand. And when it was done, he said nothing. Just watched, a cold satisfaction lingering in his shadowed face.

The worst part is how right he always sounds. Every time he speaks, it’s like he’s showing me a hidden truth, pulling away the blindfold to reveal the ugly, crawling mess beneath the surface of reality. And he knows things, things he couldn’t know. He knew about Claire. He knew things no one else knew. I try to tell myself it’s just coincidence, or maybe he’s something...someone...my mind’s conjured to give me an excuse for what I’ve done. But it doesn’t explain the way his voice slides into my thoughts, slick and venomous, pressing me with details I couldn’t know otherwise.

The Watcher never shows himself clearly. He’s always just out of reach, shrouded in shadows. But his eyes—they’re like two pinpricks in the dark, catching the light and burning into me. Sometimes, I wonder if he even has a body. Or if he’s just a spirit, some twisted shadow I can never escape. When he looks at me, it’s like he’s staring straight through me, peeling back layers of my mind, showing me things I’ve tried to forget. And I can feel him, like a sickness gnawing at the edges of my sanity, unraveling me piece by piece.

After Claire, he left me alone for a while, as if he were waiting, watching, letting the guilt fester. I thought I was free of him, that maybe I’d imagined the whole thing. But then Michael was next. My brother, who’d spent years looking after me, standing guard whenever I felt myself slipping. He thought he could keep me safe, thought he could protect me from whatever darkness lurked in my mind. But The Watcher didn’t care about that.

The night it happened, I saw him standing in the doorway, watching as Michael sat in his chair, his back to me, a worried frown on his face as he typed on his laptop. The Watcher whispered, soft as a breath, “*If he knew the truth, he’d have turned you in by now. He’s going to stop you. You have to act first.*”

I was trembling as I picked up the knife. My brother, my own flesh and blood, and there I was, standing behind him, holding the blade to his throat because *he told me to.* I could feel The Watcher’s icy gaze burning into me, urging me on, promising it was the only way to keep the world intact. And as the knife slid across his skin, as his blood poured over my hands, I felt the weight of it, the crushing horror of what I’d done. Michael’s body twitched and shuddered, his eyes locking on mine, wide and pleading. I tried to look away, tried to block out the gurgling sound he made as he gasped for air, but The Watcher held me there, forcing me to watch as the life drained from his eyes.

And then he was gone. Just a heap of cooling flesh in my arms, a twisted, broken reminder of everything I’ve lost. The worst part was the emptiness that followed, a hollow ache that clawed at my insides as I cleaned up, disposing of the evidence like some mindless machine. The Watcher had told me it was necessary, and I believed him. I had to. If I didn’t believe him, then that meant...I was responsible. And I can’t be. I can’t be the monster he’s making me into.

But he doesn’t stop. He’s never satisfied. Each life I take feels like a piece of my soul slipping away, leaving only him in its place. Sometimes, I wake in the middle of the night, drenched in sweat, my mind reeling as I try to piece together what’s real and what’s not. I can’t shake the feeling that The Watcher is just...there, lurking in the dark, biding his time, waiting to pull me down again.

Tonight, I tried to ignore him. I even took my meds, hoping to drown out his voice, to silence him if only for a moment. But his voice cut through the haze, louder than before, more insistent. He’s furious now, saying I’ve delayed him long enough. The world, he says, is fraying at the edges, coming apart like threads in a rotting tapestry, and he needs me to make the next move. There’s a new name, a face I recognize, someone I’ve known since childhood.

The Watcher’s voice is a low hiss as he tells me what he wants this time. My pulse races, and my blood feels like ice. I can barely breathe as he speaks. I try to close my eyes, to shut out the image he’s seared into my mind. But it’s no use. He’s there, whispering, *You have to do it, or everything ends.*

The Watcher wants more, and this time...it’s something I don’t think I can give. Because no human could even think what he asked of me.

I don't know what to do, but I can't let the world end. But... can I do that? Can I REALLY, do... that?
