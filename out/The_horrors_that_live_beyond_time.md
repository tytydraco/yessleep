I write this from my bedroom, shivering in fear. I can still picture those creatures I saw, very clearly. They were far scarier than even my worst nightmares. I’m posting this online just to let people know of my experience, though I know most of you won’t believe me, but hey it’s worth a try.

My bloodline has been blessed….. Or now that I think about it, cursed, with **the ability to stop time** . Well technically, it’s not exactly stopping time, hold up I’ll just start from the beginning.

“ Jessica listen to me! “ I yelled, while using all my willpower to hold back tears. “What is it, Micheal?! Let me leave!” Jessica replied in frustration. “Atleast tell me why you’re leaving me, what did I do wrong, maybe we can make it right again!” She ignored me and started walking out of the café

“Don’t ignore me Jessica atleast answer before leavi-“ “People drift apart micheal!” She yelled, cutting me off mid sentence. “You’re not my type anymore, what’s the point of staying together when I don’t even like you…” “Well then what is your type?”. I asked, with a lump forming in my throat.

“I am, kiddo”. I saw a guy, maybe around 25 years old, interrupt our conversation “Who are you?” I asked. “Hmm let’s see, how do I put it? I’m her new boyfriend” My heart sank after hearing those words. “Come on jess, we should leave” He began leaving with Jessica in his car, while they silently chuckled, looking at my now teary face.

I didn’t realize when the tears started flowing, but I couldn’t stop them, not anymore. At that moment I felt a surge of 50 different emotions pumping all over my body. Ranging from gut wrenching sadness to blood boiling anger.

Unfortunately, the anger that took over me at that moment is the reason I’m here right now. I ran towards the car, tears still flowing, the adrenaline made me forgot that I’m a skinny teenager running towards a muscular tall guy. I punched him right in the face.

And before I knew it, I was on the ground, getting my face punched, at some point I went numb, I started feeling nothing. All I saw was Jessica, begging that guy to stop it, or I’ll die. Before leaving, he spat on my face. “Don’t ever try to mess with me loser”

It took me 15 minutes to get up, I saw myself through the reflection in café’s window, covered up all in blood. I booked a cab home. What happened after this is a bit of a blur, since I was consumed by rage and sadness and was barely in my senses. On reaching home I jolted straight towards my room, leaving droplets of blood in my path. My parents saw me and started asking what happened.

I locked my door and just let it all out, I started crying uncontrollably, this was my first relationship, and probably the last one too after this experience. I loved her with all I had, I gave my everything but in return, all I got was betrayal, and some punches to the face of course.

**KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!** “What happened sweetheart, at least tell us!” My mom screamed while banging loudly at the door. “Just leave me alone I’m fine!!” I spoke, in my ‘obviously not so fine’ voice “HEY KID, YOU KNOW I’M HERE FOR YOU RIGHT? JUST TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED!” my dad yelled from the other side of the door.

The constant knocking along with the thousand voices in my head, made me go insane, I shivered from the overwhelming emotions flowing through me. And just when I was on the brink of losing my sanity. It all stopped.

The deafening screams of my parents, the cars honking outside, the ticking of my clock…… it all stopped. It was just me now. At that time I wasn’t in the state to question it, I just assumed they gave up and went back. Now that I was alone, I let it all out.

Hours passed before I finally regained my composure and stood up from the bed. I opened the door and went downstairs to finally talk to my parents. Though something wasn’t right, the whole house had a yellowish tint to it, and a very putrid smell, like it hasn’t been cleaned in years. The air was thick, making it hard to breathe. And a faint clicking noise in the background, almost like a TV static. I don’t know how to describe it, but it was as if the place was stripped of its purpose, the once lively house, seemed lifeless.

I opened the door to my parent’s bedroom, hoping to find them asleep, but it was empty. And so was my sister’s room. Then it dawned on me, **I’m on the other side.**

The other side, though this is not an official name, this is at least what we call it. All I know is that “it was given to our ancestors for something important”. The order side is an exact 1 to 1 replica of our world, note that it is not our world, but a replica. Though in our family, we mostly use it for work. Whenever I have an essay due, and haven’t started it, I just go to the other side and start writing, with unlimited availability of time.

When you’re inside here…. No time passes in the real world. This has granted our family massive success, in every field. That’s why we’re fairly rich……I guess that’s the reason Jessica started dating me, but hey never mind that, we have bigger problems to deal with now. When you come back to the real world, all the things you did on the other side also appear in the real world.

To access this place we have to perform a certain ritual. Basically, you have to sit still, close your eyes and go into a sort of meditative trance. Once your soul and body are perfectly calm, observe your surroundings, not through your eyes, but through your mind….. Now whatever you observed, start playing it perfectly backwards in your head, which I guess…. Cancels out time? I don’t know, I just know how it’s done.

And no, don’t try it, chances are you won’t be able to do it, no one apart from my bloodline can do it.

When I was bawling my eyes out, I must have accidentally performed the ritual, subconsciously. That explains the lack of life here. But then suddenly, My heart tore through the ground and plummeted to the bottom of the world after realising what I had done. You see….there are certain rules that come with this “power”. Which shouldn’t be broken, what happens when we break them? I don’t know, but I guess we’ll find out soon.

**Rule 1-** Only one person can access the place at a time

**Rule 2-** A person can’t access the place more than once a day

**Rule 3-** Absolutely no link should be present between the real world and the other side, this wasn’t an official rule but the one we made, after my uncle jack went in their with his cellphone and someone called him during that time. He never came back. We still continued using that place tho, success is one hell of a drug I guess, of course being even more careful of the rules now. And now the most important one.

**Rule 4-** Do not ever, perform the ritual in an open area. It has to always be performed in a closed room, with all doors and windows locked tightly while performing the ritual, as well as on the other side. You might’ve guessed it by now, I broke rule no. 4. Panic started to rise in heart as I thought about what I should do next. Should I run back to my room? Should I hide here? What am I gonna do? What happened to uncle Jack?

**THUD** My important discussion with myself was interrupted by a noise from upstairs, my sister’s room, it was like a box falling. “Oh god this is my end, isn’t it?”. I heard more rumbling from upstairs, until it wasn’t from upstairs anymore.

“The bathroom!” I think to myself, I run towards the bathroom and hide inside. I hear footsteps, It’s searching for me downstairs. And it’s angry, I hear furniture being thrown around. “if only I was able to control my anger back then, now I’m in the jaws of some monster, I fucking hate myself”

I think to myself in anger. Though the lost hope is suddenly reignited as I hear the monster going upstairs again. “This is my only chance to get back to my room and to my world” after a bit of a mental tug of war, I finally decide to slowly open the bathroom door.

I decide to go to the kitchen first, to grab a knife, no way I’m gonna survive without one. While in the kitchen, I look outside through the window. The world was quiet, quiet as if…… as if the concept of sound never existed.

Footsteps again. This time even louder, I turn off all the lights and hide under the dining table, with 2 knifes in my hand. I suddenly hear a loud bang from my mother’s bedroom, it snapped the bedframe in half to see if I’m under the bed. And then thing entered the kitchen. I saw it’s legs, they were….gross, for the lack of a better word. They were unusually thin, with veins all over the leg, and long sharp nails. As the nails touched the ground it made a sharp screeching noise. Almost making me shiver due to irritation.

I did my best to hold my breath, while hearing his. It was like there was something stuck in his throat forcing him to breath in unusual intervals. Saliva dropped from his mouth onto the floor. I suddenly banged my head on the kitchen table, it noticed me. I quickly got up and backed away, I couldn’t see much because I turned off the lights, but I saw it’s eyes. It looked like he was holding in the anger from 1000 years, the eyes reflected it, so much so that I almost dropped to the ground in fear after making eye contact with it.

It had long horns on it’s head, and a sharp beak. It was tall but very slender, veins were visible throughout it’s body. Before thinking twice I lodged both my knives straight into its chest, it roared in a very high pitch almost making my ears bleed. The knives got stuck inside of him, I decided to leave them and run.

I ran without thinking anything, I climbed the stairs and ran in the upstairs corridor towards my room. I looked back to see not one not two but six heads staring at me from my sister’s room. They ran after me on all fours.

Then it dawned on me, this isn’t a place made for work or to do your homework in, this is a prison, for those creatures. Our ancestors captured them and sent them to this place, and expected us to do same. I sprained my ankle while running but the sheer amount of adrenaline in my body didn’t let me stop, I felt teeth at the back of my neck for a second but I ignored it and ran, the hallway seemed longer than usual.

I heard loud chuckles from behind, they were laughing at me as I tried to run for my life, just as I was about to lose hope I saw the door to my room. With every last ounce of strength I had I threw myself in and slammed the door shut. The moment I closed it, all the noises disappeared.

The way to get to your world was to perform the same ritual, but backwards. After I performed the ritual and got back to my world, I quickly fell unconscious as I felt the adrenaline leaving my body. I woke up, it was 2 AM . I felt a sigh of relief, everyone was obviously asleep so I sat on my bed. And writing this was the first thing that came to my mind, just to calm myself down.

Though there’s a problem, I’ve been writing this for an hour and……**the clock still says it’s 2 AM.**
