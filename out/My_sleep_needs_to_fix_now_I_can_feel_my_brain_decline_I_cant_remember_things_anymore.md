Lately, my sleep has been completely out of control, and no matter what I do, I can’t seem to fix it. I’ve tried everything I can think of, but nothing seems to work. My body just shuts down at around 6 PM, and I end up fainting into sleep, no matter how hard I try to stay awake. Then, I wake up around 11 or 12 at night, completely disoriented and frustrated. It’s not just a one-time thing either—it keeps happening every single day, and it’s ruining my entire routine.

I’ve made every effort to fix this. I’ve forced myself to stay awake longer, thinking that if I push through the exhaustion, I’ll be able to reset my sleep schedule. But no matter how hard I fight it, my body always gives in. It’s like I physically can’t keep my eyes open past that point. And once I do wake up in the middle of the night, I find myself stuck in this weird limbo—too awake to go back to sleep, but too tired to function properly.

I’ve tried adjusting my daily habits, thinking maybe something in my routine is throwing things off. I’ve looked at my diet, my exercise, my screen time—nothing seems to make a difference. I’ve tried cutting out naps, drinking more water, and even changing my room’s lighting to make it more comfortable for sleep. I’ve even tried melatonin and other sleep aids, hoping they would help regulate my cycle, but they either don’t work at all or leave me feeling groggy and even more exhausted.

The worst part is how much this is affecting everything else in my life. I feel like I’m completely out of sync with the world. I wake up when everyone else is asleep and end up missing out on so much during the day. My energy levels are all over the place, and I never feel truly rested. Even when I do sleep for what should be enough hours, it never feels like quality sleep. I just wake up feeling drained and stuck in this cycle all over again.

I don’t know what else to do. I’ve genuinely tried my hardest to fix this, but it’s like my body just won’t cooperate. I’m frustrated, exhausted, and honestly, a little desperate at this point. I don’t want to live like this, constantly feeling like I’m fighting against my own body just to have a normal day. But no matter what I try, I always end up back in the same situation.

I just want to sleep at a normal time, wake up in the morning like everyone else, and feel rested instead of constantly exhausted. But I have no idea how to actually make that happen, and it feels like I’m running out of options.
