I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m scared all the time. I can’t sleep, I can’t think, I can’t even look at the TV without feeling like my chest is about to cave in. Please, if anyone knows what this is or what I should do, I need help. I’m writing this because I don’t know where else to turn. It feels like I’m being hunted inside my own home, and the worst part is I can’t prove it — no matter how many times I try.

That night the broadcast was waiting for me the second I turned the TV on. The static didn’t roll or hiss like normal; it snapped into place like it had teeth of its own, then parted to reveal the pulpit again. The preacher’s voice rang through the speakers in broken waves, words stretched and bent until they no longer sounded like words at all. My grandmother was in the front pew, her hands folded tight, her head lowered in perfect stillness. I leaned closer without meaning to, my stomach sinking before I even knew why.

The lights in the living room began to flicker in rhythm with the television — one long blink, one short, again and again, syncing with the distortions on the screen. Behind her, something moved. At first just a shadow, a wrongness draped in human shape, but then it stepped forward and the wrongness sharpened into detail. It was tall enough to bow the ceiling beams, its skin a shifting film of gray and black that pulsed like rot on water. Its eyes were two spirals burning inward, pulling all the light around them. Its arms hung too long, fingers dragging along the pews until the wood groaned under their weight.

It leaned over her. My grandmother’s head tilted back, her jaw hanging slack as though her strings had been cut. No sound came out, just the bubbling hiss of static pouring from her throat in sync with the speakers. Then the creature smiled at me. Not at her, not at the preacher — at me. Its mouth split open and kept splitting, lips peeling back until there was no face, only rows upon rows of teeth packed like glass needles into flesh that quivered when it grinned. The lights above me flickered faster, buzzing until I thought they might burst, and for one moment I swore I heard its breath rattling not from the TV, but from the corner of my living room.

When it ended, I scrambled for my phone. I tried to record it — I needed proof, I needed something to show anyone else that this wasn’t just in my head. But when I played it back, it wasn’t there. No pulpit. No preacher. No demon. Just a still image of static, frozen in place no matter how many times I replayed it. I recorded again and again until my hands cramped, but every single time it was the same — the broadcast erased itself, leaving me with nothing. That was the worst part. I couldn’t share it, couldn’t convince anyone, couldn’t even look at it afterward to prove to myself it had really happened.

I barely slept that night. Every shadow across the walls seemed to ripple if I stared too long, like the picture tube glow was bleeding out of the screen into the corners of my house. The flicker of the streetlight outside sent me bracing for the hum of the broadcast to start on its own. My phone would light up with nothing, the air would feel thick and heavy, and for a few seconds at a time I swore I could hear the faint hiss of static coming from somewhere behind me. By the next evening I was a wreck, but I still turned the TV back on. I told myself I wouldn’t, that I’d leave it off and try to pretend none of this was real, but I couldn’t stop. I needed to know what the fuck was happening. Some part of me felt like if I didn’t watch, whatever it was would simply step closer in the dark, where I couldn’t see.

And it did.

The static broke cleanly, the pulpit swimming into view, the preacher’s hands slamming against the wood as his voice thundered about blood and fire and the trumpets of heaven. But this time the thing wasn’t behind my grandmother. It was standing directly behind him.

It loomed over the pulpit, its body twisted so that every limb bent at an angle it shouldn’t. Its spine jutted in sharp ridges, like it was wearing a crown of bones down its back. The skin across its chest rippled and split as though something underneath was clawing to get out. Its head hung just over the preacher’s shoulder, those spiral eyes locked not on him, but on me. The preacher’s voice droned on, oblivious, his mouth working soundlessly while the creature breathed against his ear. Every flick of its tongue, every twitch of its jaw, made its teeth glisten — layer after layer, tens of rows stretching back into a black pit where a throat should have been.

It didn’t smile this time. It only stared, unblinking, its entire body angled toward me like it was waiting for me to understand something. The preacher’s words had become nothing but low vibrations under the sound of my heartbeat. The flicker of the lights above me synced again with the television until the whole house seemed to pulse with it. The longer I sat there, the more I was sure it wasn’t behind the preacher at all. The edges of the frame seemed closer, as if the camera itself had taken a step forward. The spirals in its eyes spun inward, and for a heartbeat I felt that same slow drag inside my chest — like something leaning closer to my ear, like something waiting to see if I would blink first.
