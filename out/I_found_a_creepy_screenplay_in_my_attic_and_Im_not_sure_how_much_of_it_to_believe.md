*I've lived in the middle of bumfuck nowhere for my entire sixteen years of life. I'm used to it, honestly, but I'm always looking for something interesting to do, especially during the long summer days. It sounds horrible, but when my grandmother died, I was a little bit excited. She was a deeply unpleasant woman, but rich as could be, and her house was the quintessential hoarders den. I couldn't wait to get my hands on whatever shiny things were contained in her house. Unfortunately, there wasn't much but trash and dirt.* 

*The only thing that at all held my interest was this play.* 

LOGLINE

June has just begun a job recovering corpses from rivers. At Ferrum River, a place notorious for leaving more swimmers dead than alive, strange things start happening, all seemingly connected to a little girl in a red dress.

&#x200B;

CHARACTERS

June: June a young woman who has just begun a job maintaining waterways, which for her mainly consists of search and recovery for dead bodies. 

Cora: a girl around ten years old who is often found in or near Ferrum River, and has never appeared to June without wearing the same red dress.

Austin: Austin is June’s boss. He is a veteran diver, having had his job for over twenty years. 

&#x200B;

SETTING

Set in the 1990s, somewhere in the rural counties of the costal United States. The main focus is on Ferrum River, a place notorious for being dangerous to anyone who tries to swim in it because of its speed, quick turns, and the jagged rocks on the riverbed.

&#x200B;

INT. DRIVING IN A CAR—NIGHT

JUNE and AUSTIN are both dressed in official-looking diving suits, sitting in a truck. AUSTIN is driving. JUNE is wearing a necklace with a star made out of clay on it. 

&#x200B;

JUNE

Could we maybe listen to some music, Austin?

&#x200B;

AUSTIN

Sure, I guess. Just keep it down. 

&#x200B;

JUNE fiddles with the buttons on the radio before finding a station that blares heavy metal music.

&#x200B;

AUSTIN

(laughing)

Does that sound like keeping it down to you?

&#x200B;

JUNE quickly turns the music off.

&#x200B;

JUNE

(nervously)

Oh! Sorry, sir.

&#x200B;

AUSTIN

It’s fine, just not so loud, okay? My old ears can’t take it. 

&#x200B;

JUNE

(awkwardly)

Sorry, sir! Yes, sir, um, Mr. Austin. Sir. Sorry.

&#x200B;

JUNE cringes away from Austin.

&#x200B;

AUSTIN

Christ, June, I’m not going to bite you. Calm down. And stop apologizing. 

&#x200B;

JUNE

Sorry! I mean, ah. I just really need this job. Sorry—I mean, yeah. I’m not sorry? 

&#x200B;

JUNE covers her face with her hands and AUSTIN grins. 

&#x200B;

AUSTIN

Well, yeah. Pretty much everyone who comes our way is desperate to work. Hunting for corpses in a river isn’t exactly most people’s idea of a good time. We’ve got a high turnover rate. 

&#x200B;

JUNE peaks out through her hands. 

&#x200B;

JUNE

It has to be done, though. It’s like a civil service thing! I’m serving my country. 

&#x200B;

AUSTIN

If you want to look at it that way, sure. 

&#x200B;

AUSTIN brings the car to a halt and turns off the engine. 

&#x200B;

AUSTIN (CONT’D)

We’re here. 

&#x200B;

The headlights face the river, lighting up a small strip of water. Even from that, it is obvious that the river is violent, with large rocks lining the shores and fast currents. There is a short dock stretching out over the water near where they are parked. The opposite bank features a small cliff with thick trees at the top. 

&#x200B;

AUSTIN

(suddenly serious)

We’re going to be working in the Ferrum River today, there was another drowning report and we’re still looking for that kid from last week. I know you’ve done this at least couple times before, during your training, but Ferrum is a whole different beast, so I’ve got some important things you need to know. Okay? 

&#x200B;

AUSTIN opens the truck door and slams it behind him. JUNE scrambles after him. 

&#x200B;

JUNE

Uh, okay! Got it. 

&#x200B;

She starts to give him a salute, then falters, embarrassed. 

&#x200B;

JUNE (CONT’D)

…Yes. Sorry. 

&#x200B;

AUSTIN sighs, then starts getting equipment out of the back of the truck and distributing it between them.

&#x200B;

AUSTIN

(quickly and brusquely)

The most important thing is that we never go in the water. I don’t care what you think you see, you stay on the banks. We do this at night because during the day, the current pushes everything under the water, where we can’t see. Keep hold of your flashlight, and stay close. Got it? 

&#x200B;

JUNE fiddles idly with her necklace.

&#x200B;

JUNE

Yep. Sure.

&#x200B;

AUSTIN points at the necklace. 

&#x200B;

AUSTIN

And take that off. 

&#x200B;

JUNE

Um. Do I have to? I’ve always worn it. Like a good luck charm?

&#x200B;

AUSTIN

Unless you want it to catch on something and choke you to death, yeah, you need to take it off. 

&#x200B;

AUSTIN gives JUNE a quick smile and strides off towards the water. JUNE throws her necklace on the seat inside the truck, then goes to follow him. There are several shrines with flowers and crosses visible on the bank. 

&#x200B;

JUNE

Austin? What are those flowers?

&#x200B;

AUSTIN looks back. 

&#x200B;

AUSTIN

Those are shrines. For all the people who have died here. 

&#x200B;

JUNE

Oh. I didn’t realize it was so deadly. 

&#x200B;

AUSTIN

That’s why we don’t go in the water. 

&#x200B;

AUSTIN walks away, but JUNE hesitates. She looks across the river, to the opposite bank, where CORA is visible, shadowed by the darkness. CORA raises a finger to her lips in a shushing motion, then disappears back into the trees. 

&#x200B;

INT. IN THE SHOWER—NIGHT

&#x200B;

JUNE is alone in her shower, washing her hair. The news is playing in the background. 

&#x200B;

RADIO (O.S.)

Cora Jones, a young girl from Ruchest county has now been missing for two weeks. She was last seen near the deadly Ferrum River, wearing a red dress. Her family is looking for any information. And now, our classical music hour. 

&#x200B;

The radio switches to slow classical music. As she continues to shower, the sound of the water gets louder and louder, drowning out the music. JUNE looks down and sees brackish seawater coming out of the drain around her ankles. 

&#x200B;

JUNE

What…?

&#x200B;

JUNE turns towards the shower door, but it’s gone—she is hemmed in on all sides by tile walls. The sound of falling water thunders around her as the dirty water at her feet rises around her. She splutters and fights against the water, but soon her head goes under, there is silence. We see her underwater, trying sluggishly to swim. Just as it seems that she’s about to drown, she bursts above the surface of the water. JUNE is seemingly in the middle of the ocean, with no land in sight. She spends several moments coughing and trying to stay afloat, before she is pulled under the water again and everything goes black.

&#x200B;

FADE IN:

INT. IN THE SHOWER—DAY

JUNE wakes up, lying on the shower floor, with no immediately visible sign that anything has happened. A phone is ringing in another room. JUNE stumbles to her feet, wraps a towel around herself, and goes to answer the phone. 

&#x200B;

JUNE

(tiredly)

Yeah?

&#x200B;

AUSTIN (O.S)

(angrily)

Why the hell aren’t you here? You’re two hours late, I’ve already called you twice. I was this close to coming to your house to make sure you hadn’t been murdered in your bed! I expect at least two more weeks before you die. 

&#x200B;

JUNE leans against the wall.

&#x200B;

JUNE

I’m…not murdered. Sorry, I guess I overslept. 

&#x200B;

AUSTIN

Just get here. 

&#x200B;

JUNE winces and steps forward, off the wall. 

&#x200B;

JUNE

Wait, uh, where am I supposed to go again?

&#x200B;

AUSTIN

I told you that yesterday. 

&#x200B;

JUNE

Yeah. It’s been a long night. 

&#x200B;

JUNE closes her eyes and rests her forehead on the wall.

&#x200B;

AUSTIN

(annoyed)

We’re at Ferrum River again. 

&#x200B;

JUNE

Thanks—

&#x200B;

AUSTIN hangs up before JUNE can finish. JUNE sighs and combs her fingers through her hair. She looks confused and pulls her hand back in front of her. She is holding a piece of seaweed that had been stuck in her hair. 

&#x200B;

EXT. ON THE BANK OF FERRUM RIVER—DAY

JUNE is walking through the forest alongside the river bank, on her way to meet up with Austin. She is wearing her necklace. CORA steps in front of her, out of the shadows in the trees, and JUNE, walking quickly with her head down, runs into CORA.

&#x200B;

JUNE

Woah! Uh, sorry. 

&#x200B;

CORA puts her hands on her hips and tilts her head. 

&#x200B;

CORA

Are you the new zombie woman?

&#x200B;

JUNE laughs nervously.

&#x200B;

JUNE

I’m pretty sure I’ve never been a zombie before. 

&#x200B;

CORA

(sulkily)

No, silly! Of course you aren’t a zombie. You just find them. 

&#x200B;

JUNE

Oh, well, I look for the corpses of people who died in the water. 

&#x200B;

JUNE pauses momentarily and takes in CORA’S very young appearance. 

&#x200B;

JUNE (CONT’D)

Shit, you’re like ten. Um, I mean, I try to take care of people who fall asleep. In the water. And forget to get out. Yeah.

&#x200B;

JUNE shakes her head and looks hard at CORA. 

&#x200B;

JUNE (CONT’D)

I’m sorry, who are you? Shouldn’t you be in school?

&#x200B;

CORA

(brightly)

&#x200B;

Oh, I’m Cora! And I don’t like school, so I don’t go. 

&#x200B;

CORA frowns. 

&#x200B;

CORA (CONT’D)

And shit is a bad word.

&#x200B;

JUNE tries to edge past CORA on the riverbank, but CORA moves to block her way. Trees and underbrush rustle in the background, and move gently, like there are hundreds of things moving slowly through them, but nothing is visible. 

&#x200B;

JUNE

That’s great. I really need to get going, though, so could you move please?

&#x200B;

JUNE makes a shooing motion at CORA’S face. 

&#x200B;

CORA

(pouting)

But I really want to get to know you better, June. 

&#x200B;

JUNE frowns, disturbed. There is movement behind her again, closer this time, and bigger. There are things that might be faces visible in the shadows of the nearest trees. 

&#x200B;

JUNE

How do you know my name? 

&#x200B;

CORA shrugs. 

&#x200B;

CORA

You went in the river. I went in the river too, you know. 

&#x200B;

Dozens of people step out of the forest silently, out of June’s eyesight. She doesn’t see them. Some look normal, but the vast majority are desiccated and skeletal, bloated by water. 

&#x200B;

JUNE

That’s cool. Maybe don’t, though, in the future. It can get pretty dangerous. 

&#x200B;

CORA smiles widely. 

&#x200B;

CORA

Oh, I know. 

&#x200B;

JUNE, seeing movement out of the corner of eye, spins around and sees the ranks of the dead around her. She gasps and stumbles backwards. 

&#x200B;

CORA(CONT’D)

We’re all very well aware of that, actually. 

&#x200B;

JUNE turns towards the river, where there seems to be a space clear of bodies, but more people start crawling out of the river, crowding her in. 

&#x200B;

JUNE

(panicky)

What—nope, no. Fuck this. What the fuck. 

&#x200B;

JUNE runs. CORA screams and darts forwards, unnaturally fast, and grasps the necklace that JUNE is wearing. She twists it in her grasp, cutting off JUNE’S air. JUNE trips, then chokes on the ground, grappling at CORA’S hand and trying to push it away. The other people surround JUNE, leering down at her. Then, from down the path, comes AUSTIN’S voice. 

&#x200B;

AUSTIN

June? Are you here?

&#x200B;

CORA scowls and releases the necklace. When JUNE looks up again, CORA and the rest of the dead are gone, leaving her hyperventilating on the ground. AUSTIN rounds the corner, seeing JUNE. 

&#x200B;

AUSTIN

What the hell—are you okay? 

&#x200B;

AUSTIN rushes forward and crouches by JUNE. 

&#x200B;

JUNE

(shakily)

There was a girl. And, and. I don’t even know. I don’t even know. 

&#x200B;

Austin touches the mark on JUNE’S neck, from her being choked with the necklace, drawing away when JUNE flinches. 

&#x200B;

AUSTIN

(quietly)

Tell me what happened. 

&#x200B;

JUNE

There was a girl. At least, I think she was a girl. 

&#x200B;

AUSTIN

Calm down June, you’re okay.

&#x200B;

AUSTIN sits beside her, guiding her to lean against his shoulder.

&#x200B;

AUSTIN

We’ll figure it out. Here, want a piece of jerky?

&#x200B;

AUSTIN fishes a piece of jerky out of his pocket and holds it in front of JUNE’S nose. 

&#x200B;

JUNE

Where did you even…? No, I’m good, thanks. 

&#x200B;

AUSTIN

Your loss. 

&#x200B;

JUNE

Sure. 

&#x200B;

AUSTIN gets to his feet. 

&#x200B;

AUSTIN

I’m going to call my boss and let her know that you were attacked and ask what we should do. I’m just going to be over by the truck, don’t go anywhere.

&#x200B;

AUSTIN steps away, towards the truck but still in eyeshot, and takes out his phone. JUNE lays on the ground for a moment, arm covering her eyes, then stands up. She looks around and her eyes catch on something moving in the water. 

&#x200B;

JUNE

(scared)

Austin? Do you see that?

&#x200B;

AUSTIN continues talking on the phone, obviously not having heard her. JUNE looks closer, and steps towards the banks. The light shifts, and a small form with bedraggled hair and a muddy dress are suddenly visible in the water. 

JUNE

Austin! I think there’s someone in the river!

&#x200B;

AUSTIN still doesn’t hear. The person in the water is struggling, clawing at the air, obviously drowning. JUNE looks around, then yells to Austin. 

JUNE

I’m going in the river! There’s a kid in there! 

&#x200B;

AUSTIN finally turns around.

&#x200B;

AUSTIN

June, Wait!

&#x200B;

JUNE doesn’t wait. She just runs for the river. As she hits the water, ghostly figures appear, lining the banks. They watch her silently. JUNE swims towards the struggling girl, the water pushing her around. She hits a rock, spinning around hard. She gasps for air, things spinning faster and faster, leaving her disoriented and the air spinning. 

&#x200B;

EXT. FERRUM RIVER

AUSTIN stands near a shrine on the river bank, a colorful thing with dozens of flowers and a simple cross. He has a bouquet of flowers in her arms. He puts it down, then walks away slowly. We move closer, and see the name engraved on the cross— it says *June*. As AUSTIN turns away, a girl in a red dress crawls slowly out of the river, with JUNE right behind her. 

END

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*I think it must have been one of my relatives who wrote this. Ferrum River is the river near my house; it's got a bit of a reputation for haunting and misfortune, so we all steer well clear of it. Strangely, my great-aunt was named June. June died when she was twenty-five. She drowned in the river. I don't know why anyone would have written something about her as horrible as this, but I guess that people do weird things because of grief. I* did *go down to the river yesterday, though, and there* is *a shrine there to June, so this must have at least some truth to it. Reading this must have disturbed me more than I thought, though, because when I was in the shower this morning, there was a second where I thought the water went murky. There was dirt and seaweed caked over all the walls and I couldn't breathe. Of course, a second later the feeling was gone and the shower was completely clean. I know that I just made it up, but still, I don't think I'm going back to Ferrum River any time soon.*
