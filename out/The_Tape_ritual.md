Have you ever heard of the Tape Ritual?  
I hadn’t either. The risks are extremely high, but anyone willing to take them is promised ten years of luck, success, love, and money.

For the ritual, take a roll of tape—extra adhesive if possible—and a pair of scissors. You will need these once the tape has entered the Tape Man’s universe. Personalize the tape. Write briefly about your favorite things, your hobbies, your family, any health issues, and your name. Add a circled photo of a loved one. Attach photos of money, objects you want, or the job you desire. You can even include a wish for excellent exam grades.

After preparing the totem, attach it firmly to the tape. Then make sure the tape is tightly stuck to the wall, forming a square large enough for your body to pass through. Once it’s ready, say:

**“This wall can’t stop me right now. Wall, open, let’s see.”**

If the Tape Man accepts your challenge, the square will open into a door leading to his parallel universe. Make sure you can pass through without removing or loosening any tape. I repeat: **MAKE SURE YOU CAN PASS.**  
If even one piece of tape comes off, the door will close behind you, and the Tape Man will most likely find and kill you—or you will die of starvation.

If nothing comes loose, consider yourself lucky.  
You are now in the Tape Man’s universe, and you must be extremely careful.

If you remembered to bring the scissors, you can try to attack the Tape Man, but you have to be strategic. In the parallel universe, gravity may be reversed, causing you to walk on the ceiling. This is why you should perform this ritual in a place without ceiling doors, LED lights, or hanging lamps. You will be running a lot in the Tape Man’s world, and if you trip or fall, the consequences will be severe.

First rule: **don’t run.**  
The later he notices you, the longer you delay the most dangerous part.

The Tape Man has very sensitive hearing. He can hear almost anything, so move quietly. The first thing you need to do is take the photos and objects you taped to the wall in your own world. If you wrote down your illness, take the diagnosis report as well. Place all the items so they touch the same wall you taped them to originally.

Then, offer yourself to the Tape Man.  
This is the most dangerous part of the ritual and the one where almost everyone fails. Be careful—use your intelligence rather than your strength. Don’t rush. Wait for the right moment to attack. If you’re lucky, you will cut the tapes binding him and release his soul.

If you’re unlucky, he will hear you, and you will suffer the consequences.

After you free the Tape Man’s soul, say:

**“Tape Man, Tape Man, you’re free of all those tapes.**  
**Hey Tape Man, can you make everything I want happen?”**

Thank him.

Then move as fast as you can toward the wall where your tape square is. Imagine the totem you created is right in front of you. Once you reach the wall, you will be granted health, money, and luck for ten years. The objects you wished for will appear in your room.

Now, let’s talk about what happens to those who fail the ritual—those who fall, trip, or leave without thanking the Tape Man.

The result is always the same: **certain death.**  
Usually suicide, paralysis, or coma.  
Sometimes a punishment even worse than death: blindness, deafness, loss of taste, or nerve damage so severe that the person can no longer fully perceive reality.
