I appreciate the kindness on my last post. Posting about my guests is one thing, but sharing about myself feels like exposure. I hope, if anything, you all understand now that I am not exposing another’s pain just to do so; I have been where many of them are. 

After I hit “post” I quite immediately turned off my computer and let Charles hold my hand. We have done this since the first morning he stayed here - it’s how we keep each other grounded. It’s how he tells me he’s doing what he can, and it’s how I tell him I see his humanity. 

I wallowed for a bit. I spent time in my pain. Normally I’d go out in the garden and bury my feelings with the plants in the dirt, but the ground is frozen. It is, indeed, December in Maine. I considered baking or cooking, I considered eating my feelings - but that will only delay or transfer my pain. 

So, I wallowed. 

Regardless of how deep one might wish to bathe in their misery, life goes on. In my case, that means that The Cottage is still open. When The Cottage is open, that means I will host guests.

This is that guest’s story.

December 18th, 2025

I was in bed. It wasn’t very late at night and I wasn’t very tired, but I was in bed. 

I was scrolling on my phone in that mindless way that we do in this modern era, taking in all the information and also none of it, trying to escape the images and memories in my mind. Charlie had left me hours ago - at my request - all of the variants of his face riddled with concern and care and something I did not want to label. 

Something a bit too close to pity. 

The headlights made me groan. Of all times to get an arrival, of course it would be when I was unprepared, both physically and emotionally. Still, I pulled on my blazer and straightened my hair and made sure my breath wasn’t offensive and readied myself to greet the newcomer.

The person I saw on the other side of the door was not who I was expecting. They rarely are, to be entirely fair to the work, but this young woman could barely be called that.

This young woman was barely this side of girlhood, with baby fat still clinging to her jawline and the glow of teenagedom still warming her cheeks. Her brown eyes were red from crying and her chin still trembled, but she kept herself steady and maintained eye contact with me.

Her dense black hair was pulled into a bun that sagged low on the back of her head, and it bobbed slightly when she asked, in a voice that just barely wobbled, “Any vacancy?”

I nodded and guided her to my desk while trying to measure her, while trying and failing to get some inkling of what new variation of pain and choice I was about to bear witness too. “Fifty bucks a night. I don’t hold for incidentals. If you stay an extra night, we do this again tomorrow. Breakfast is at 8am.” 

Breakfast is not mandatory, I wanted to add. I wanted to opt out myself, to not have to think about cooking and carrying someone else’s burden. 

Except breakfast was mandatory. The Cottage made sure it was. 

She handed me her ID and card silently, not meeting my eyes. I frowned slightly and read her name - Julia M. She had turned eighteen three months ago. I assessed her, trying to see if I could find any signs of abuse or assault, and found none. I would not get anymore clues until I dreamed. 

I fought against sleep. I wanted to stay up and feel my misery a little longer, I wanted to be my own center of attention for just a few more minutes. It was a losing battle. The fight was against The Cottage, too, and The Cottage always won. 

I dreamed of Julia, of the poverty she came from, of single-wide trailers and cigarette smoke and alcoholism in her single mother. I dreamed of a father who only showed up to fight against paying child support until he stopped showing up altogether. I dreamed of pancakes with butter and nothing else.

I dreamed of Julia raising her four-year-old sister because her mom was still searching for a future at the bottom of a bottle of vodka. I dreamed of visits from Child Protective Services where Julia cleaned until her fingers bled and hid all the bottles and excused every sign of neglect they worried about. I dreamed about her sister being placed somewhere else, in a home with the child’s paternal grandparents where Julia was not welcome. 

I dreamed of Julia’s impeccable grades, of her innate genius at math. I dreamed of early graduation from high school. I dreamed of scholarships awarded for more money than she had ever even thought about, of acceptances to schools that were fighting for her. I dreamed of a future filled with opportunities she couldn’t imagine. 

I dreamed of acceptances to MIT and UCLA. I dreamed of acceptances to Harvard and Princeton and Stanford. I dreamed of the shock from Julia’s counselors, of those middle-aged education workers who had never seen a student get accepted to one Ivy League, let alone multiple. 

I dreamed of full ride scholarships. I dreamed of a future outside of single-wide trailers and vodka bottles and secondhand smoke. 

I dreamed of intense internal conflict. I dreamed of Julia trying to connect with her baby sister. I dreamed of a maternal force of nature.

I woke up feeling only sorrow for the young woman in my first suite. I made her pancakes, I set out sides I knew she wouldn’t eat and coffee she probably wouldn’t drink and I waited as I always did. 

She didn’t come downstairs until quarter past eight, and she didn’t have her bags with her like I’d expected. Most of my guests try to leave before breakfast. Most try to never come back. 

“I made you pancakes,” I offered gently. Julia took in the spread and sat down in the wooden dining chair across from me, the weight of her sounding heavier than she could possibly be. 

Julia shoveled the pancakes down like she hadn’t eaten in weeks, all while I picked at my breakfast, trying to decide if I should speak first or wait for her. When her plate emptied, I refilled it, and I finally decided that I would speak. 

“I’ve never had a future Harvard student as a guest.” She paused mid bite and stared at me, her dark eyes wide with shock. Maybe with a bit of anger, or pain, too. “MIT is probably a better school for math, but you’re right to prefer post-undergrad there, I think. What do I know, though, I only went to the University of Iowa.” 

The shock stayed on her face, but her expression relaxed, melting into one that seemed more resigned. Julia put her fork down. “It’s not far,” she said quietly, her voice wobbling a touch as it had the night before. “Six hours. An easy bus trip from Bangor. I could come visit often. But Olivia…” 

She stared out the window behind me, the one that looked into the wintery garden. “She’s basically mine. I was only fourteen when she was born, but I raised her. I accidentally called her my baby instead of my baby sister before she was six months old. She only got taken because I couldn’t bring her to doctors appointments alone, and when I tried… mandatory reports.” 

Julia sighed. “I kept them at bay for three years. Made sure my mother was just sober enough, that the house was clean. All that time I was only thinking about her. So was CPS, even though I was a kid, too. I was looking at apartments when her grandparents showed up.” 

Her face shifted to a scowl. “They’re rich. They live in Bar Harbor near the water and can give her everything I can’t. They’ve let me visit twice but think that I’m a bad influence. I was accepted to fucking Harvard, for gods sake. I’m a god damn genius. And a bad influence.” 

She took the angriest bite of pancakes I’d ever seen and I took that as my turn to speak. “Why not just leave? Blossom, and then fight for her when you are more settled?” 

“It will be too late then,” she snapped, then frowned apologetically. “Sorry. If she grows up, if she remembers that I could have fought harder and didn’t, if she becomes established in a school system with family… what chance would I have? I’d be taking a little girl away from stability for my own gain. At the same time, she is my baby. I changed her diapers. I took pictures at every milestone. I made sure she was clean and fed. I missed school when she was sick. How could I leave her behind?” 

She was crying now, tears falling freely down her cheeks and spilling off her jaw onto her shirt. “If I leave, if I go to an Ivy League school and then a prestigious post graduate program and then whatever takes me beyond, how could I forgive myself for not fighting harder for her?” 

My heart did a flip in my chest as I realized the weight of her choice. It was not about her sister’s future, or about life and death, or about good and evil. 

It was about if she could forgive herself later. I couldn’t answer that for her, even though I knew the choice she would make. She knew the choice she would make, too, or else she wouldn’t be crying at my dining room table. 

“Stay another night,” I offered, my voice kind. I had made a choice, too, one that I didn’t expect to be making. “On the house. Today, we can make a plan for whatever you decide.” 

——

I probably don’t have to tell you, but she chose her own future. She chose to nurture her own genius to offer a better life for herself.

I helped her write a letter to her little sister, one that explained why she made the choice she made and that she was always going to be there when she needed to be. I wrote Julia one of my own, promising to house her on vacations, promising to help her fight to see Olivia when she came home, and promising to help her with whatever she needed in between. 

Julia is still here, and will be until the spring semester starts. She is sleeping off years of hypervigilance and neglect. I’m going to pay for her to go to the dentist and the doctor before she leaves for school in the spring, because MaineCare really never gave her a chance. 

I am still grieving for my daughter. I will be grieving for her for as long as I live and then possibly beyond because she was made from my flesh and blood and she was taken from me in front of my very eyes. 

But Julia never had a mom. She probably would never have had a chance, except she is exceptionally gifted and exceptionally passionate. Her future is blooming in front of her in ways that she doesn’t even know yet, and she needs a loving hand at her back. 

I am realizing that as I progress in my ownership of The Cottage, I am collecting a village. Julia is a normal teenage girl who needs someone to love her with maternal fierceness. Charlie is an extramortal creature who needs someone to ground him to humanity. 

I am a lost soul looking for peace in a world that has already stolen it from me, but I’m finding bits of it. Shreds. Fragments. So, I’ve decided to keep searching. I’ve decided that if I must, I will become a mosaic of love and kindness and peace and hope. 

Maybe that’s why The Cottage chose me.
