Sara and I talked for years about going to Mexico. Our college years were behind us, but we felt we had missed out. We focused on our studies. Looking back, we both regretted not accepting those invitations. Best friends and boyfriends begged, but we felt a duty to stay. To tell the truth, we felt superior; it felt good pretending to be more scholarly than the rest. But working through our twenties, we felt the dreaded three-zero looming on the horizon.

We both had a hell of a time getting the same week off work at the end of March, but we managed it. I called in all the favors I had left. The time leading up to the trip dragged; every working hour felt like two. Sara wasn’t much of a planner, so in my free time, I plotted out an itinerary that would recapture our youth. Looking at it now, I see how delusional it was—drinking, clubbing, drinking, touring, snorkeling, drinking. My dread of aging had me on the edge of psychosis.

From planning to sitting on the plane felt like a dream. Sitting next to each other was essential. Sara was terrified of flying, so we drank enough to forget the possibility of falling out of the sky. We were both single at the time, so we had secret dreams of finding a mysterious man, rich and handsome, to swoop in at the resort. At least I did. Maybe she was more tethered to reality, but I doubt it.

We hit turbulence on the way down; thick fog blocked our view. We had enough to exchange nervous laughter rather than panic as we made contact with the landing strip. Once we landed, the fog felt more comforting—it limited the extent of the world. Being drunk in a new city in a foreign country was not ideal, but we made it to the resort. I think we took a cab, but I can’t remember. Sara was holding me up by the time we finally got to our room.

I woke up feeling like a railroad spike was through my forehead, my lips dry, and my guts churning. My body reminded me I wasn’t 21 anymore. Sara was already up, making eggs and toast. I didn’t deserve her. We chatted about our hangovers and plans for the first day. I had originally planned for bars, but that no longer seemed like a good idea. We looked online for tours or attractions nearby. It was noon by the time we sorted the wheat from the chaff and booked a tour of an Aztec pyramid a few hours outside of the city.

More cabs and a long bus ride later, we were standing at the foot of the structure with our guide, a short Mexican man who spoke English better than most people back home. The fog was still hanging in the air, but the pyramid was still imposing, even more so partially obscured behind the haze. Sara grabbed my hand as we looked up. The distant past felt alive. There was something romantic about it—time, sacrifice, human striving, aging. I felt her hand, and my heart fluttered.

The guide was going on and on about climate shifts and human sacrifices. We were absorbed in our own fantasies about the past and the people who built this. We had walked around the entire structure twice before he stopped talking. I think he picked up on being ignored because he was gone when I looked back over my shoulder. 

There was no one else in sight. Just Sara and me, laughing and dreaming together in the fog. I don’t remember who came up with the idea to scale the steps. I can’t handle thinking it was me, but I can’t bring myself to blame her. There was something about the fog, finally being in Mexico, together; we were at the top of the steps looking out—gray fog and vague trees were the only things visible. I felt like I was living five years in the past. Sara put her hand around my waist.

I experienced a flood of emotions that made me feel like I was floating three inches off the ground. Her hand was holding me tightly. I let myself go, I turned to kiss her. Only it wasn’t her. Whoever I was before that moment is dead.

Holding me was a squat, muscular man. His dark skin stood in contrast with the white robes and head covering. He looked and felt ancient—not just old, but from another time. He spoke, and his words meant nothing to me, despite my years of Spanish.
I pushed away and just barely broke free from his grasp. 

Standing at the edge of the main platform, I could see it all. The central plinth was slick with blood. A body lay on top. Her body. The man stood, his white clothes stained with blood. He held a thick piece of viscera in his left hand. Sara’s heart. It might as well have been mine. He smiled and brought the flesh to his mouth.

I let out a shriek and ran down the stairs. Too fast. I made it halfway down before my feet failed me, and the ground caught me, my hands softening the blow enough to keep me from blacking out.

I scrambled to my feet and took one last look up. The man stood triumphant, blood running down his chin. I felt my brain starved for oxygen as I sobbed and ran.

They found me heaving as I shuffled down the side of the road. I was taken to the hospital; blood ruined my dress where he had held me. I told them what happened. I begged them to go and find Sara, to find the man. The police came hours later while I was hooked up to an IV drip. They told me in broken English that there was no blood, no man, and no Sara.

They won’t let me leave the hospital. They say I am unwell and that they need to continue their search for Sara, but I know they won’t find her and that I won’t ever see her again.
