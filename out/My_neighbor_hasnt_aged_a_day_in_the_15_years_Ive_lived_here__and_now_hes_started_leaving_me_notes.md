My neighbor hasn’t aged a day in the 15 years I’ve lived here — and now he’s started leaving me notes

I moved into this street when I was 22. Fresh out of university, excited and broke, I found a small two-bed rental that let me cobble together a life with cheap pizza and late-night coding sprints. Nobody really talked about the guy across the road—he was quiet, curtains always drawn, lawn trimmed to perfection. I assumed he worked weird hours and just kept to himself.

Fast forward to now: I’m 37, with a receding hairline, an achy back, and a half-empty bottle of anti-wrinkle cream on my dresser. My friends joke I’ve aged like milk. Yet every time I cross the street to grab my mail, I catch his reflection in his window: same hair, same posture, same bored expression. No gray. No wrinkles. No sign he’s even turned a single birthday candle.

Last week, I finally noticed his lawn was exactly the same height as it was when I moved in—all fifteen years of clippings gone. It was too consistent to be a coincidence. The street sweeper never caught him working, and I never saw a lawnmower. He just… existed, day in, day out, untouched by time.

I tried to shrug it off. Probably some weird glitch in my head. But Thursday night, I came back from a late dinner with friends and saw something stuck to my front door: a small, pale yellow sticky note. Scripted in neat block letters:

> “You’re starting to notice. Don’t.”

No signature. No duck tape—just slapped on like someone was in a hurry. I stared at it for a full minute before ripping it off and tossing it in my bin. My heart thumped so loud I was sure the neighbors heard.

Saturday morning, I peeked through my blinds before heading out. His curtains were half-open. I thought about marching across and demanding answers, but every time I tried, something pulled me back. That afternoon, I was at my desk when my phone lit up with a notification: another note, this time stuck to my car windshield.

> “You’ll want to ignore this. But you can’t. That’s how it starts.”

The handwriting was the same—no flourish, no personality. Just instructions. My palms sweated. It wasn’t a prank; I don’t know anyone who’d go to this trouble. I rubbed my eyes and wondered if my brain had finally had enough sleep deprivation from late-night work.

Today—I’ve barely eaten. I noticed his porch light flicked on at noon. I stared at it for ten minutes, convinced it would turn off, but it stayed lit. When I finally looked away, I saw him standing at his window, watching me. Not waving. Not talking on the phone. Just… watching, like he’d been waiting for me to catch him in the act.

I tried calling a friend to talk it through, but my words came out jumbled. How do you explain your unaging neighbor sending you cryptic threats and staring at you all day? I even checked my ring doorbell footage—nothing. No snow-white hands sticking notes, no silhouette sneaking around. It’s like the universe blinked and rewrote reality around him.

I don’t know what this is, but I can’t sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see his face pressed against the glass. My phone battery’s dying, and I’m not sure if I should email work tomorrow or just take the day off to figure this out. I’ve never believed in the supernatural or conspiracy theories, but… something is very, very wrong here.

I’ll update soon—provided I survive the night without one more note. If you don’t hear from me, well, maybe time really did catch up with me after all.
