Since I was a child, the veil between our plane and the supernatural has been thin. Over the years, I've found ways to block my "gift" but every now and again I unintentionally open that door.

The night before Halloween, I turned on "Late Night With The Devil". Its that new movie where a late night TV host accidentally unleashes a demon into the cable network of American. Anyway,I tend to stay away from any movie dealing with contacting the dead, or dealing with demonic entities. Its not that I necessarily believe in those things, its just that when I let those thoughts into my head, it tends to be a beacon of light in whatever plane lays parallel to ours. Its like they are alerted to my presence.

Foolishly, I finished the movie and went to our bedroom to read and wind down for bed. After about fifteen minutes, my dog sits straight up on the bed and makes a little whimper. I assume it was a bad dream, but then I watch his eyes move from the doorway and track all the way to the top corner of our bedroom. Rationally, I believe this to be a bug or dust...something just catching his eye, but then I feel the feeling, the telltale sign I have a visitor.

Imagine walking into a large stadium full of people cheering, then they all stop...dead silent and just look at you. That is the best way I can describe it. I get this feeling no matter the spirit/entity/anomaly (whatever you want to call it)

The hairs on my arms stand straight up and I get this intense feeling of dread and sadness. This is the warning...this is how I know a malevolent energy is close to me. I quickly put the book down and take ten deep breaths to clear my head and think rationally. I probably just scared myself and I'm reading too far into it.

To bring myself some comfort, I go into my supplies and pull out a white candle. I carve my purifying sigil into the wax and anoint it with my mixture of oils. I ask for cleansing energy and to guide any sinister forces from my living space and my mind. With the candle lit and placed into a neat pile of salt, I turn to walk away. I get a strong urge to turn around and just as I make eye contact with the candle, I see it snuff out...like someone blew it out.

This is obviously concerning. I take another deep breath and recite the lines again, lighting the candle. I vocally tell the entity that it is not welcome in this home, and command it to leave immediately. To my surprise, the candle flame makes a large "whoosh" and burns twice as high as it was before returning to a normalized state.

Just to be safe, I burned a candle the next two nights. I donâ€™t want to let any other entity think they are welcome or allow them entry. I wonder what I accidently let into my home...
