It’s been four months since she died, but I still wake up every morning with the same image: her standing in our kitchen, making tea. She almost always had coffee in the morning, so it was odd enough that I noticed. I was sitting at the table, half-awake, just watching her hum along to some song I didn’t recognize as sunlight filtered through the window. She looked up, caught me staring, and laughed.

“See you later, alligator,” she said, with that little smirk I loved, and leaned down to brush a kiss against my cheek.

The memory feels like it’s been carved into me, sharp as a knife, catching in my chest every time I breathe. I never saw her again. A few hours later, while I was at work, her car collided head-on with a drunk driver. He died instantly, but she held on for a few minutes. I don’t know exactly what happened in those final moments, but the paramedics said she was trapped—broken and alone in that twisted mess of metal.

She tried to call me. I know that because when I finally checked my phone, there was a missed call. I’d left my phone on silent, buried in my pocket while I sat through some mind-numbing meeting, completely oblivious. I wasn’t there for her. I missed her call.

Since then, I can’t shake this obsession. Every night when I close my eyes, I imagine what she would have said if I’d answered. Would she have called my name? Would she have told me she loved me, or would she have begged me to help her? Every possible answer just… eats at me. It’s like that missed call is stuck in my mind, a voice I can’t escape, dragging me down into something so dark I’m not sure I’ll ever climb back out.

When her funeral finally came, I barely remember it. Everything felt like a blur—faces, voices, people patting my shoulder. Friends told me I looked like a ghost, just staring blankly at her casket, not really seeing anything. I was gone too. Whatever part of me was left was buried with her that day.

I thought I would eventually find a way to keep going, but I haven’t. I can’t. Our apartment is exactly as she left it. Her clothes are still in the closet, her toothbrush next to mine, her favorite mug sitting by the sink. I’ve left everything untouched, like she’s going to walk through the door any second. I can even still smell her faintly on the sheets. Every time I’m home, I feel her lingering, just out of reach.

And then there’s her cat, Milo. He was never really mine. She had rescued him from a shelter years ago. He was this scrappy, one-eyed thing, and she used to call him a survivor, like he’d been through hell and back before she found him. He was her shadow, curling up on her lap, always ignoring me. But now, he won’t leave me alone. It’s like he’s watching me constantly, following me from room to room, his one good eye tracking every move. Sometimes I catch him staring at the wall, his gaze so focused, so intense, like he’s watching something only he can see. It gives me this weird chill, like she’s there, watching me through him somehow.

Or maybe I’m just losing it.

About a month after the funeral, I decided—well, tried—to sort through her things. Everyone said it would help me “move on,” whatever that means. But it was like every item was a piece of her, some shard of our life together, and I couldn't let go of a single thing. I was sitting on the floor with her sketchbooks, trying to tell myself I’d just look through them, maybe find a few to keep, when I noticed something strange.

There, buried under a pile of her old notebooks, was a small journal. I recognized it immediately. She used to keep it by the bed, jotting down little notes or random sketches before she’d fall asleep. But when I flipped it open, something caught my eye. It was a note—her handwriting, but… dated two days after her death.

I thought it had to be a mistake, that I was reading it wrong. But her handwriting was unmistakable. I read the note, once, twice, then a third time, the words hammering into my mind, stranger each time:

*“Love, I don’t have much time. I know you’re hurting, and I’m sorry. But please, don’t let me go. I’m here, somewhere dark, somewhere terrible. And I need you. There’s a way to bring me back. I know you can do it. Just don’t forget me. I’ll guide you. Trust me.”*

Her handwriting was a mess, like she’d written it in a rush. The letters were shaky, slanted. It didn’t make sense—none of it did. She’d been dead for days by the date on that note, and yet… I was staring at her handwriting, feeling her voice in my mind, hearing her words as clear as if she were there beside me.

I tried to tell myself it was impossible. Grief does things to people, right? They see signs, they hear voices, they try to hold on to anything that keeps the person they lost close. But this didn’t feel like some illusion my mind was conjuring up. It felt real. Tangible. I read that note a dozen times, each line sending chills through me, deeper each time. I couldn’t shake the feeling that she was right there with me, close enough to touch.

Then, two nights later, I got an email.

It was from her account. I’d left it open on my computer because… well, I couldn’t bring myself to close it. Seeing her name there in my inbox was a way to hold on, a way to keep her close, even if it was just digital traces. But that night, her name popped up with a new message. The subject line just read, “I’m still here.”

I stared at the screen, my heart pounding. My first thought was that it had to be a glitch. Or maybe someone was playing some sick joke, hacking her account to mess with me. But when I opened the email, the message was a garbled mess, full of typos and half-finished sentences that didn’t make sense. Still, her voice was so clear in my mind as I read it.

*“It’s dark here. So dark. I don’t know how long I can hold on. Please, you have to help me. Find something of mine, something precious. Bring me back. I’m waiting.”*

It felt like the air had been sucked from the room, like my chest was about to cave in. I should have told myself it was some kind of trick, maybe some spam or error. But it sounded like her, the way she’d phrase things, the way she’d talk to me. Who would go through the trouble of faking that? And why?

I closed my laptop, tried to delete the email, but my hands were shaking too much. I found myself reading it over and over again, her words burrowing into my brain, filling me with this desperate, aching need to bring her back. Because what if she was there? What if she was trapped somewhere, waiting for me? If there was even a tiny chance… how could I ignore that?

I went to bed that night feeling like I was half in a dream, her voice echoing in my mind. And when I closed my eyes, I swear I felt her, like a faint warmth beside me, almost like the weight of her body lying next to mine. Even Milo was acting strange, sitting at the edge of the bed, staring at some empty space in the room with that one intense, unblinking eye.

The email was just the beginning.

After that first email, the messages didn’t stop. They’d come at random times—early in the morning, late at night—just a few lines, sometimes a single, desperate sentence. They were all from her account, and every message was more frantic than the last. Each one painted a picture of… well, of somewhere horrible.

One night, I found a note folded up in her favorite book on the shelf. I hadn’t touched it since she died, hadn’t even opened it. But there it was, right there on a slip of paper that looked fresh, like someone had just put it there.

*“Please, don’t let me fade. It’s endless here, just darkness and pain. I can feel myself slipping. I know it’s hard, but there’s a way—a ritual. It’s the only way I can be free.”*

I read the note again and again, my hands going numb. Her handwriting was there, clear as day, even down to the little flourish she’d put at the end of her letters. It was her. And the words… they were different from her usual tone—almost frantic, like she was trapped somewhere, fighting to stay connected to this world.

I wanted to tell myself that I was going crazy, that maybe I’d written it myself and forgotten, or maybe I was imagining things because of the grief. But the details—the little things that only she would say, the way she’d phrase things, her shorthand—it was all too familiar.

Then, a few nights later, another email arrived. This time, there were no words, just an image attached. My hands shook as I clicked on it, half-expecting something terrifying, but it was just a photo of her and Milo from last year, sitting on the couch, her hand resting on his head. I hadn’t taken that picture; she’d sent it to me one day while I was at work.

Below the photo was a single line of text: *“I’m so cold, love. So cold. I need you to help me.”*

By now, my nights were haunted by her presence. It was subtle at first—a faint hint of her perfume lingering in the air, the quiet creak of the floorboards in our room as if she were moving around. Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I’d feel a warmth beside me, like she was lying next to me, her arm draped over me the way she used to do when she was still alive.

Milo would sit at the foot of the bed, his gaze fixed on something I couldn’t see. His one yellow eye would follow whatever it was around the room, and every so often, he’d make a low, almost guttural sound that sent a shiver down my spine. I felt her there with us—so close I could almost hear her breathing.

The next message came the following evening, slipped beneath a photograph on our dresser. I hadn’t moved that picture in months; it was one of us on a hike, taken the summer before. And there, on another piece of paper, her handwriting stared back at me:

*“Gather something of mine—my ring, a lock of hair, anything with my essence. Place them together. I’ll tell you the rest soon.”*

The message ended there, but I didn’t need any more. I found myself nodding, barely thinking as I opened the drawer beside the bed, pulling out her favorite necklace, a hairbrush with a few strands of her hair still tangled in it. I gathered the items slowly, with a kind of reverence, feeling like each piece was a tiny fragment of her, a part of her spirit waiting to come back.

I laid everything out on the table, my hands shaking. I could feel her so clearly, like she was just inches away, urging me forward. There was something powerful building inside me, a need to complete whatever she was asking, to bring her back, no matter what it took.

And then, just as I was beginning to feel some kind of twisted hope, the final email came through.

The instructions were clear, but there was one thing she was asking for that sent a chill straight through my core:

*“A vessel,”* she wrote, *“young and pure, a soul untouched. The younger, the better.”*

I recoiled, my mind racing, that one word echoing in my head. But even as I felt the horror of what she was asking, her emails kept coming, each one a desperate plea, reminding me of the darkness she was trapped in, the suffering she was enduring.

*“I know it’s hard, love, but you’re the only one who can help me. Don’t let me suffer alone. Please, hurry.”*

I shut off the laptop, my hands trembling. I tried to sleep that night, but every time I closed my eyes, I saw her face, twisted in agony, reaching out to me, begging me to free her.

And I knew, in that moment, that if I had to go through with it… I would.

For days, I tried to push her last message out of my mind. I wandered the apartment, staring at the things I’d gathered for the ritual, trying to convince myself I’d misunderstood. But the emails kept coming, each one more frantic, more desperate. Her words were filled with a kind of agony I’d never heard from her before, descriptions of a place I couldn’t even imagine.

*“It’s like fire, but deeper. There’s no end here, no light, just… emptiness. Please, love, I can’t do this alone.”*

I felt her slipping away, each message more frantic, like she was running out of time. And every time I hesitated, every time I tried to push it out of my mind, I felt her presence fade a little more. I began to avoid being home, haunted by her voice, the weight of her request. I wandered the streets late at night, letting the exhaustion numb my thoughts, anything to escape the pressure of her words.

One evening, on one of those late-night walks, I saw her—the little girl next door. She was playing alone in her front yard, a small ring of wildflowers in her hair, twirling around in the grass with the carefree innocence of childhood. She laughed, a soft, bright sound that made my heart ache.

I turned to leave, to go back inside, but then her laughter drifted through the air, sweet and clear, a reminder of everything I’d lost. I could feel her—the woman I loved—her presence growing weaker with each passing second, her voice becoming an echo. And as I stood there, caught between the fading memory of her and the vibrant life in front of me, the emails echoed in my mind, those last desperate words she’d written:

*“The younger, the better. You’re the only one who can save me.”*

The girl looked up, catching my gaze, and gave me a small, innocent wave. She trusted me; she’d seen me her whole life, watched me talk to her parents, helped me feed Milo once when we were out of town. I was just a friendly face, the nice neighbor from next door. As she looked at me with a smile, I could feel something inside me shift, my grief and desperation twisting into a dark, singular need.

Before I even realized what I was doing, I’d taken a step toward her. The words came out in a quiet, steady voice, like they belonged to someone else.

“Would you like to come meet Milo?”

Her face lit up, and she nodded eagerly, skipping over to me with a trust that nearly shattered me. But by now, I was too far gone, my mind filled with her voice, urging me on, pleading with me to save her.

As I led her inside, the apartment felt darker, heavier, like it was holding its breath. The items I’d gathered for the ritual lay arranged in a careful circle on the floor, each one glinting softly in the dim light. Milo sat at the edge of the circle, his one yellow eye fixed on me, unblinking, as if he could see the weight of what I was about to do.

I led the girl to the center of the circle, her small hands still clutching a stuffed animal, her eyes wide and curious as she looked around. Her innocence felt like a knife in my chest, a part of me screaming to stop, to turn back. But then, I felt it—her presence, my wife’s spirit, so close I could almost feel her hand on my shoulder.

“Are we going to play a game?” the girl asked, her voice trembling slightly, a hint of nervousness in her smile.

“Yes,” I whispered, barely able to speak. “A very special game. But you have to be very quiet.”

She nodded, trusting me completely, and that trust burned through me like acid. But I couldn’t stop. Not now. I took the shoelace I’d prepared, my hands trembling as I looped it around her small neck as gently as I could, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might burst.

Her eyes widened in fear, her small hands reaching up to grasp mine, her voice barely a whisper as she realized what was happening. “Please… please don’t.”

In that moment, something inside me broke. I felt my heart splinter, but I told myself this was for her—for the woman I loved. Her letters, her voice, they were all I had left, and they’d pushed me this far. I tightened the shoelace, feeling her struggles grow weaker, her breaths shallow and desperate, until finally… silence.

I let go, stumbling back, staring at her still form in the center of the circle, her wide, lifeless eyes staring back at me, frozen in terror. The room felt suffocating, the weight of what I’d done crashing over me like a wave. But I reminded myself it was worth it. This was for her.

I waited, barely breathing, my hands shaking as I watched the circle, expecting something—anything—to happen. I could still feel her presence, stronger than ever, just out of reach, waiting to cross over.

Any moment now…

I waited in that dark, suffocating silence for hours. My eyes never left the circle, the little girl’s body lying still, her eyes wide and empty, staring up at nothing. I whispered her name—my wife’s name—again and again, as if calling out would somehow bring her closer, pull her across whatever barrier separated us.

But nothing happened.

The air felt thick, heavy, pressing down on me from all sides. I was frozen there, watching, waiting, the quiet so absolute it felt like it was choking me. I told myself to be patient, that the ritual must take time, that she was adjusting, coming back slowly. But as dawn began to creep through the windows, casting pale light over the room, a creeping sense of dread began to coil in my stomach.

Something was wrong.

The girl’s body hadn’t moved, hadn’t changed in any way. Her eyes were still open, her small mouth slightly parted, frozen in an expression of horror and betrayal. I reached out, my fingers trembling as they hovered over her, searching for any sign of life, of her presence, of… anything. But there was nothing. Just the cold, lifeless body of a child.

And then the smell began.

It was faint at first, just a hint of something off, something wrong. But as the hours passed, it grew stronger, filling the room with a thick, sickly odor that clung to everything. I tried to ignore it, to tell myself it was just part of the process, but the smell became unbearable, a constant, nauseating reminder of what I had done.

Days passed, each one stretching on endlessly as I clung to the hope that she would return. I kept the girl’s body hidden, wrapping it in plastic and shoving it into the bathroom, desperately trying to contain the smell, but nothing helped. I’d wake up in the middle of the night, gagging on the stench, feeling her presence fading more and more with each passing day.

Finally, on the fifth day, reality started to sink in, cold and cruel. She wasn’t coming back. The ritual had failed, and I was left with nothing but the rotting remains of an innocent child. My mind reeled, spiraling with the horror of it, the enormity of what I had done crashing over me, suffocating me.

With numb, trembling hands, I gathered every plastic container I could find, trying to erase the evidence of my crime, to bury the nightmare that had become my reality. I sawed through the small, broken body, each movement mechanical, my mind blank as I forced myself to go through with it. The sounds were unbearable—the snap of bones, the wet, sickening give of flesh—and each cut felt like it was tearing through my own soul.

There was one moment that will haunt me forever. Her head wouldn’t fit into the container, and in a blind, frenzied panic, I found myself slamming it against the edge of the tub, my hands slick and shaking, my stomach twisting as the sound echoed through the empty apartment.

Once I’d packed everything away, I drove far out of town, taking the containers to an abandoned factory on the outskirts. The silence of the night was thick, oppressive, pressing down on me as I dug a shallow grave, covering each container with dirt, my heart pounding with the sick, twisted hope that maybe, just maybe, burying the evidence would bury the memories too.

But as I stood there in the dark, staring down at the freshly turned earth, I knew—deep down—that nothing would ever bury what I’d done. This was my reality now, a weight that would follow me to the end of my days, a stain that would never wash away.

I drove back to the apartment, numb and hollow, every room filled with the shadow of her absence. Milo was waiting for me, his one yellow eye glinting in the dim light as he watched me with a strange, unblinking intensity, like he knew. I could barely look at him, the weight of my guilt pressing down on me, crushing me under its weight.

That night, I sat alone in the darkness, the silence suffocating, pressing down on me like the walls were closing in. And then, in that endless, empty quiet, my phone buzzed.

An email.

The sender was unknown, the subject line blank. My hands shook as I opened it, my breath catching in my chest as I read the words on the screen.

*“Did you really think she was waiting for you? Did you really believe? She’s gone. There’s nothing left for you now. Only darkness.”*

And below that, a name. Her name.

It felt like the world had tilted, the horror of it sinking in slowly, like ice creeping through my veins. I’d been deceived. Manipulated. Whatever had been sending those messages, those letters… it wasn’t her. It had never been her.

I stared at the screen, the words blurring as tears filled my eyes. She was gone—truly gone—and I was left with nothing but the weight of what I had done, an act so monstrous that I knew, in that moment, there would be no redemption. No forgiveness.

Only darkness.

Milo watched from his usual spot, his gaze unblinking, almost… pitying. I looked into his eye, and for a fleeting moment, I could almost see her, her face, her smile, all the moments we’d shared. It was a painful, gut-wrenching image, gone as quickly as it came, leaving me with nothing but the crushing reality of what I’d become.

In the silence that followed, a strange calm washed over me. I knew what I had to do. There was no forgiveness for what I’d done, no undoing the horror I’d committed. The only way out was one final, irreversible act.

I walked to the bedroom, my footsteps echoing in the silence, each one heavy with the weight of my decision. I reached for the gun I’d bought weeks before, the cold metal a final comfort, a dark promise that would end the suffering that had consumed me. I held it in my hand, feeling its weight, the barrel gleaming in the dim light, a promise of release.

I sat down on the bed, Milo curling up beside me, his presence a strange comfort in those last moments.
