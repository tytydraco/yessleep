I'm an art student at UNI, currently enrolled in a photography class. Few weeks ago, we've been given the task to document a person, place, or thing. For me, I chose to focus on car rust and wear. For my classmate, Ima, it was the Green Goddesses and the building they perch on.

Ima was a very passionate artist, got into an internship her Freshman year. I had a few classes in the past with her, but we never really talked much. Photography class was pretty much the same: we knew of each other, but not much about. That is, until I heard about the statues.

The Green Goddesses struck my interest, as I carry an infatuation with statues (credit to The Monument Mythos for this affinity). So, when Ima discussed them in class I was hooked.

Her initial photo was taken outside looking in. Reflections abstracted the space, but the contents within the building were already nonsensical: scattered chairs, artworks hung in an odd composition, and an open vault. It was one photo pinned to the wall, class huddled around for closer observation. My professor, Ohan,  found them very compelling, interested in the charm of the inside the building.

"Is there any way you can get in?" Professor Ohan's question pointed to Ima but his eyes remained on the picture. "Not that I encourage trespassing, but there might be a way to get in contact with the current owner." He added quickly, now turned to face the class again.

"The owner is from New York, rarely comes over." Ima had the answer loaded and ready.

"You think you can get a good front view of them?" Professor Ohan's curiosity matched mine, only he had the courage to voice it.

She explained that the building itself was the old county courthouse, then it was a YMCA, and now a time capsule with seldom visitors. The Goddesses sit at the edge of the roof, looking over the river. To come face-to-face with the statues is to stand on the edge of a drop-off straight into the water.

I was in awe, but this new information was subsided as class continued. Soon enough the whole conversation was left to the storage room in my brain, forgotten until weeks later.

The following classes were uneventful due to most of our time being dedicated to progress on the documentary project. These work days were quite pointless when it's a night class, as natural light is preferable.

However, there was something peculiar I did notice: Ima had not been showing up to class.

Obviously college students like to skip classes, but Ima was like me when it came to attendance. We both valued college as an opportunity that should not be taken for granted. Ima herself was dedicated to her craft, which is how she got an internship in her Freshman year. Long story short: Ima is not one to skip class, especially for several weeks.

Nobody else paid mind to this. Professor Ohan would call her name during attendance, but not spending much time pondering her whereabouts. When I asked some classmates who knew her well if they knew where Ima was, they replied with shrugs and passive uncertainty.

Though I don't know her much, I have a bad feeling. My gut says it has something to do with the statues. Something about the way she talked about them...

I'll be back with more research. Hopefully a lead.
