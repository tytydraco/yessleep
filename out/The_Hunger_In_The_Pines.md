Hey everyone, this is my first ever written scary story about 10 buddies and a wendigo, to be blunt. Let me know what you all think as if this gets enough upvotes, ill be putting this on my new YT channel!

# The Hunger in the Pines

*They say time heals all wounds. They're wrong. Some wounds—the ones that run soul-deep—just scab over, waiting for the slightest touch to tear them open again. It's been three years since that weekend in the Blackwood Forest, and I still wake up screaming, tasting pine needles and copper in my mouth.*

# Chapter 1: The Beginning of the End

The Facebook message from Marcus seemed innocent enough: "10 of us. 7 days. One epic camping trip before real life kicks in." We were all about to scatter across the country for college, and this was supposed to be our last hurrah. If I'd known it would be the last time I'd see seven of my friends alive, I would have blocked him right then and clicked away.

But I didn't.

Instead, I found myself cramped in Marcus's dad's old Suburban on a humid August morning, wedged between Sarah's camping gear and Mike's oversized backpack. The AC was barely working, and the radio kept cutting out as we wound our way deeper into the mountains. Ten of us packed in like sardines: Marcus and Jenny up front, Mike, Sarah, and me in the middle row, and Kai, Ashley, Dylan, Rachel, and Tom sprawled across the back with our gear.

"Dude, Tyler, your elbow is literally becoming one with my ribs," Sarah complained, shoving my arm away. Her dark curls were already frizzing in the humidity, forming a wild halo around her head. I'd had a crush on her since sophomore year, but she'd always been Dylan's girl. Now they were heading to different colleges, and the tension between them was thick enough to cut with a knife.

"Sorry," I mumbled, trying to make myself smaller. It didn't help that Mike was built like a linebacker and took up half the seat by himself. He was busy showing Kai something on his phone, probably another one of his conspiracy theory videos. Mike was obsessed with cryptids and local legends, which was why he'd been so excited when Marcus chose this particular spot for our trip.

"You guys are gonna love this place," Marcus called from the driver's seat, his eyes meeting mine in the rearview mirror. "My uncle used to hunt here before they closed this section of the forest. Said it was the most pristine wilderness he'd ever seen."

"Why'd they close it?" Rachel piped up from the back. She was the youngest of our group, having skipped a grade, and probably the smartest. She'd already been accepted to MIT on a full ride.

Marcus shrugged. "Some accidents a few years back. Probably bears or something. But don't worry, we've got permits, and I know what I'm doing."

Jenny, his girlfriend, squeezed his shoulder. They'd been together since freshman year and were that annoying couple who finished each other's sentences. "Marcus has been camping here loads of times with his family," she assured us. "It's perfectly safe."

That's when Mike decided to pipe up with his usual poorly-timed enthusiasm. "Hey, you know this area is famous for Wendigo sightings, right?" He was already pulling up something on his phone. "Native American legends say—"

"Oh God, not this again," Ashley groaned from the back. "Can we ban cryptid talk for this trip? I want to actually sleep at night."

But Mike was undeterred. "No, seriously, listen to this. The Algonquian-speaking tribes believed that humans who practiced cannibalism would transform into these creatures. They're supposed to be these tall, emaciated things with antlers and—"

"Mike," Tom interrupted, "if you don't shut up about monsters, I'm going to eat you first when we run out of food."

Everyone laughed, but something about Mike's words sent a chill down my spine. Maybe it was the way the forest seemed to press in against the windows, getting thicker and darker as we drove, or maybe it was the fact that my phone had lost signal about twenty minutes ago. Either way, I couldn't shake the feeling that we were being watched.

The road narrowed to little more than a dirt track, branches scraping against the sides of the Suburban like fingernails. The temperature seemed to drop several degrees, despite the August heat.

"Almost there," Marcus announced, but his voice had lost some of its earlier confidence. "Just gotta find the... there it is."

He turned onto an even smaller path, the vehicle bouncing so violently that Rachel yelped as her head hit the roof. After what felt like an eternity of being jostled around, we emerged into a small clearing. The trees here were ancient, their trunks wider than cars, their branches forming a cathedral ceiling far above us. The air felt different here—heavier, older somehow.

As we piled out of the car, stretching cramped muscles and breathing in the pine-scented air, I noticed something odd. Despite the summer season, there were no birds singing. No insects buzzing. Just a profound, pressing silence that made every snapping twig under our feet sound like a gunshot.

"Home sweet home for the next week," Marcus declared, but his words seemed to be swallowed by the forest, leaving barely an echo.

None of us knew then that for seven of us, this clearing would become exactly that—a final resting place, marked only by the ancient pines and the hungry thing that dwelled among them.

*If only we'd listened to the silence.*
