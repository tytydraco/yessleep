Hey everyone, this is my first ever written scary story about 10 buddies and a wendigo, to be blunt. Let me know what you all think as if this gets enough upvotes, ill be putting this on my new YT channel!

# The Hunger in the Pines

*They say time heals all wounds. They're wrong. Some wounds—the ones that run soul-deep—just scab over, waiting for the slightest touch to tear them open again. It's been three years since that weekend in the Blackwood Forest, and I still wake up screaming, tasting pine needles and copper in my mouth.*

# Chapter 1: The Beginning of the End

The Facebook message from Marcus seemed innocent enough: "10 of us. 7 days. One epic camping trip before real life kicks in." We were all about to scatter across the country for college, and this was supposed to be our last hurrah. If I'd known it would be the last time I'd see seven of my friends alive, I would have blocked him right then and clicked away.

But I didn't.

Instead, I found myself cramped in Marcus's dad's old Suburban on a humid August morning, wedged between Sarah's camping gear and Mike's oversized backpack. The AC was barely working, and the radio kept cutting out as we wound our way deeper into the mountains. Ten of us packed in like sardines: Marcus and Jenny up front, Mike, Sarah, and me in the middle row, and Kai, Ashley, Dylan, Rachel, and Tom sprawled across the back with our gear.

"Dude, Tyler, your elbow is literally becoming one with my ribs," Sarah complained, shoving my arm away. Her dark curls were already frizzing in the humidity, forming a wild halo around her head. I'd had a crush on her since sophomore year, but she'd always been Dylan's girl. Now they were heading to different colleges, and the tension between them was thick enough to cut with a knife.

"Sorry," I mumbled, trying to make myself smaller. It didn't help that Mike was built like a linebacker and took up half the seat by himself. He was busy showing Kai something on his phone, probably another one of his conspiracy theory videos. Mike was obsessed with cryptids and local legends, which was why he'd been so excited when Marcus chose this particular spot for our trip.

"You guys are gonna love this place," Marcus called from the driver's seat, his eyes meeting mine in the rearview mirror. "My uncle used to hunt here before they closed this section of the forest. Said it was the most pristine wilderness he'd ever seen."

"Why'd they close it?" Rachel piped up from the back. She was the youngest of our group, having skipped a grade, and probably the smartest. She'd already been accepted to MIT on a full ride.

Marcus shrugged. "Some accidents a few years back. Probably bears or something. But don't worry, we've got permits, and I know what I'm doing."

Jenny, his girlfriend, squeezed his shoulder. They'd been together since freshman year and were that annoying couple who finished each other's sentences. "Marcus has been camping here loads of times with his family," she assured us. "It's perfectly safe."

That's when Mike decided to pipe up with his usual poorly-timed enthusiasm. "Hey, you know this area is famous for Wendigo sightings, right?" He was already pulling up something on his phone. "Native American legends say—"

"Oh God, not this again," Ashley groaned from the back. "Can we ban cryptid talk for this trip? I want to actually sleep at night."

But Mike was undeterred. "No, seriously, listen to this. The Algonquian-speaking tribes believed that humans who practiced cannibalism would transform into these creatures. They're supposed to be these tall, emaciated things with antlers and—"

"Mike," Tom interrupted, "if you don't shut up about monsters, I'm going to eat you first when we run out of food."

Everyone laughed, but something about Mike's words sent a chill down my spine. Maybe it was the way the forest seemed to press in against the windows, getting thicker and darker as we drove, or maybe it was the fact that my phone had lost signal about twenty minutes ago. Either way, I couldn't shake the feeling that we were being watched.

The road narrowed to little more than a dirt track, branches scraping against the sides of the Suburban like fingernails. The temperature seemed to drop several degrees, despite the August heat.

"Almost there," Marcus announced, but his voice had lost some of its earlier confidence. "Just gotta find the... there it is."

He turned onto an even smaller path, the vehicle bouncing so violently that Rachel yelped as her head hit the roof. After what felt like an eternity of being jostled around, we emerged into a small clearing. The trees here were ancient, their trunks wider than cars, their branches forming a cathedral ceiling far above us. The air felt different here—heavier, older somehow.

As we piled out of the car, stretching cramped muscles and breathing in the pine-scented air, I noticed something odd. Despite the summer season, there were no birds singing. No insects buzzing. Just a profound, pressing silence that made every snapping twig under our feet sound like a gunshot.

"Home sweet home for the next week," Marcus declared, but his words seemed to be swallowed by the forest, leaving barely an echo.

None of us knew then that for seven of us, this clearing would become exactly that—a final resting place, marked only by the ancient pines and the hungry thing that dwelled among them.

*If only we'd listened to the silence.*



Chapter 2: The First Night

Setting up camp felt wrong from the start. The tents kept collapsing as if the ground itself was rejecting our stakes, and our cellphones—all ten of them—showed the same ominous "No Service" message. Even Marcus's satellite phone, the one his dad insisted he bring "just in case," couldn't get a signal.

"It's probably just the trees," Rachel said, but her voice wavered as she glanced up at the towering pines. "The canopy must be blocking the signals."

I watched as Dylan and Sarah argued over how to set up their tent. They'd planned to share one, back when they'd signed up for this trip as a couple. Now they were barely speaking, but neither wanted to admit they should switch arrangements.

"You're doing it wrong," Sarah snapped, yanking the pole from Dylan's hands. "It goes through the blue sleeve first."

"Since when are you the camping expert?" Dylan shot back. The tension between them felt like a living thing, writhing in the spaces between our group.

Mike was the first to notice something odd about the clearing. He'd wandered to its edge while collecting firewood and called out to us, his voice tight with excitement—or fear. "Guys, you need to see this."

We gathered around him, staring at what he'd found: claw marks, deep and deliberate, scored into the trunk of a massive pine. They started at about eight feet up and ran all the way to the ground, each groove wide enough to fit my thumb.

"Bear marks," Marcus said quickly—too quickly. "They do this to mark their territory."

"Bears don't mark trees this high," Rachel countered, her MIT-bound brain already calculating. "And these marks... they're too uniform. Too purposeful."

Jenny wrapped her arms around herself, though the temperature hadn't dropped. "Maybe we should find another spot."

"There isn't another spot," Marcus replied, but I caught the slight tremor in his voice. "The permit's for this clearing specifically. We're fine. It's just... old bear marks."

Tom tried to lighten the mood by suggesting we get a fire going before dark. It worked, temporarily. Soon we were all busy with camp tasks: gathering wood, setting up the cooking area, arranging our sleeping arrangements. Ashley and Rachel took one tent, Kai and Tom another, Mike bunked with Marcus and Jenny (being the eternal third wheel he was), and I ended up sharing with Dylan after Sarah decided to join the girls.

As darkness fell, we huddled around the campfire, but something felt off about the flames. They didn't dance like normal fire—they seemed to burn straight up, unnaturally still in the windless air. The heat barely reached us, even though we sat close enough to risk singeing our eyebrows.

"Who's up for some ghost stories?" Mike asked, pulling out a flashlight to illuminate his face from below.

"Read the room, Mike," Ashley muttered, but we all knew none of us would be sleeping much anyway. The forest's silence had become oppressive, broken only by the occasional crack of wood that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once.

That's when we heard it—a sound that didn't belong in any forest I knew. A high, keening wail that started as something like a woman's scream and ended in what could have been either laughter or sobbing. It echoed through the trees, bouncing back at us until it seemed to come from all directions.

"Probably just a mountain lion," Marcus said, but he was already reaching for Jenny's hand.

Rachel shook her head slowly. "Mountain lions don't—"

"It's a mountain lion," Marcus insisted, his voice sharp with fear poorly disguised as authority. "Everyone should get some sleep. Tomorrow we'll hike to the lake, do some swimming, it'll be great."

None of us moved toward our tents. We sat there, frozen, as the fire continued its strange, vertical dance. In the darkness beyond our camp, something moved through the trees—something large enough to shake the branches thirty feet up.

I looked across the fire at Sarah, seeing my own terror reflected in her eyes. She mouthed something at me, but I couldn't make it out. Later, when I replayed that moment in my therapy sessions, I realized what she'd been trying to say:

*"We need to leave."*

But we didn't leave. We couldn't leave. The thing in the forest had already marked us, and like flies in a spider's web, we were exactly where it wanted us to be.

That night, as I lay awake listening to Dylan's uneasy breathing in our tent, I heard something else: a soft, rhythmic sound, like antlers scraping against bark, circling our camp. Over and over. Waiting.

# Chapter 3: The Vanishing

The morning began with Ashley's scream—a gut-wrenching sound that sliced through the fog-laden air like a blade. I stumbled out of the tent, heart pounding in my chest, as if I'd been yanked from a nightmare into another.

Ashley stood frozen at the edge of camp, her face pale, eyes wide with an unfocused terror. "She's gone," she choked out, pointing toward Rachel's tent.

We all rushed over, the chill of the morning suddenly forgotten. Rachel's tent lay in tatters, as if some unseen force had decided to unravel it thread by thread. The stakes were still neatly in place, the fabric shredded around them. But Rachel was nowhere to be seen.

"She wouldn't just leave," Ashley kept repeating, her voice a crescendo of panic. "She wouldn't just leave."

Marcus, trying to assert control, clapped his hands loudly. "Okay, okay, everyone calm down. She probably just went for a walk or to use the bathroom." But his hands were trembling, betraying his facade of calm.

We split into search parties, calling Rachel's name until our voices were hoarse. The forest swallowed our cries, returning only echoes and the rustling of leaves. We found nothing—no footprints, no signs of struggle. It was as if the earth had simply opened and swallowed her whole.

Then Dylan, who'd wandered farther than the rest of us, let out a low, horrified whistle. We gathered around him, each step toward him feeling like walking into a nightmare.

There, at the base of an ancient pine, lay Rachel's shoes, arranged with meticulous care. The laces were tied in perfect bows, the shoes aligned with an eerie precision. Above them, clawed into the bark with a chilling exactness, was a single line: *SEVEN MORE*.

We stood there, rooted to the spot, the implications of those words sinking in like a cold knife. Seven more? What did that mean? Seven more of us? Seven more days?

"We need to get out of here," Sarah said, her voice barely above a whisper, but carrying the weight of unspoken fears.

Marcus nodded, his earlier bravado crumbling. "Let's head back to camp," he said, urgency tightening his words. "We need a plan."

As we retreated to our camp, the forest seemed to close in around us, the trees whispering secrets we couldn't hear. We were left with the stark realization that we were not alone, and whatever was with us in the Blackwood Forest knew us, marked us, and was playing a game we couldn't yet comprehend.

The morning fog lifted, but the oppressive weight of dread settled over us, thicker and more suffocating than any mist. And somewhere, just beyond our sight, something watched—and waited.

# Chapter 4: Daylight Terrors

The sun climbed higher in the sky, but its warmth never seemed to reach the forest floor. We huddled around the remnants of our impossible fire, its ashes cold and arranged in a perfect circle despite the wind that had picked up overnight. No one wanted to say what we were all thinking: that Rachel was gone, really gone, and we might be next.

Marcus paced the clearing's perimeter, his satellite phone held high like some technological divining rod. "There has to be a signal somewhere," he muttered, more to himself than to us. The device's screen remained stubbornly dark, its battery inexplicably drained despite being fully charged the night before.

Jenny followed him, her usual confidence shattered. I caught fragments of their whispered argument: "...should have checked the warnings..." and "...your fault we're here..." Each time they completed a circuit, they seemed to walk faster, as if something was nipping at their heels.

Sarah sat cross-legged by Rachel's shredded tent, methodically sorting through the remaining contents. Her hands trembled as she unfolded Rachel's MIT acceptance letter, now creased and dampened by the morning dew. "Look at this," she called out, her voice tight with tension.

We gathered around her—all except Marcus, who was still desperately searching for a signal. The letter's text had changed. Where there had once been congratulatory words about academic achievement, now there were just three words, repeated over and over in Rachel's neat handwriting:

*THEY NEVER SLEEP*  
*THEY NEVER SLEEP*  
*THEY NEVER SLEEP*

"That's impossible," Ashley whispered, snatching the paper from Sarah's hands. "I watched her pack this yesterday. It was normal then. It was normal."

Dylan ran his fingers through his hair, a nervous habit I'd noticed more frequently since we'd arrived. "We need to leave. Now. Whatever's happening here—"

"The car won't start," Marcus interrupted, finally rejoining our group. His face was ashen. "Battery's dead. Everything electronic is dead. Even the emergency radio."

Mike, who had been unusually quiet since Rachel's disappearance, suddenly spoke up. "I found something in my research last night, before my phone died." He pulled a crumpled printout from his pocket—he'd always been old-school about keeping paper copies. "There's a pattern to the disappearances in these woods. They come in cycles."

Tom rolled his eyes, but there was fear behind the gesture. "Man, this isn't the time for your cryptid theories—"

"Shut up and listen," Mike snapped, his voice carrying an authority none of us had heard before. "Every seven years, hikers go missing in these woods. Always in groups. Always in this clearing. The article mentions a camping trip in 2018—ten college students, just like us. They found their camp intact, except for strange markings on the trees. Sound familiar?"

A heavy silence fell over the group, broken only by the whisper of wind through the pines. The trees seemed to lean in closer, as if listening to our revelation.

"That's why they closed this section," Jenny said slowly. "Not because of bears. Because of... whatever this is."

I watched as understanding dawned on each face, followed quickly by terror. We weren't just lost in the woods. We were caught in something's web, something that had been waiting for us, perhaps even calling to us through Marcus's memories of this place.

Sarah stood abruptly, brushing dirt from her jeans with shaking hands. "We need to get out of here. We can walk if we have to. The ranger station can't be more than twenty miles—"

"No one's going anywhere," Marcus cut in, his voice carrying a sharp edge of hysteria. "We stay together. That's how we survive this."

"Survive what, exactly?" Dylan challenged, stepping toward Marcus. The tension between them had been building since Rachel's disappearance, fueled by Marcus's insistence on taking charge despite his obvious fear. "You're the one who brought us here. You're the one who said it was safe!"

Their argument was interrupted by Ashley's gasp. She pointed toward the tree line, her hand shaking. We all turned to look, and my blood ran cold.

Rachel's shoes—the ones we'd found perfectly placed at the base of the pine tree—were now hanging from a branch thirty feet up, swaying gently despite the lack of wind. As we watched, frozen in horror, dark liquid began to drip from them, staining the bark below.

Jenny was the first to break, her composure crumbling like autumn leaves. She ran to the Suburban, yanking frantically at the door handle. "We have to go, we have to go, we have to—"

The vehicle's alarm suddenly blared to life, making us all jump. But the sound that came from it wasn't the usual electronic wail—it was Rachel's voice, distorted and wrong, repeating the words from her letter: "THEY NEVER SLEEP, THEY NEVER SLEEP, THEY NEVER SLEEP."

Marcus slammed his hand against the hood, and the sound cut off abruptly, leaving us in suffocating silence. We stood there, hearts pounding, as the implications of what we'd just witnessed sank in. Whatever had taken Rachel wasn't just hunting us—it was playing with us.

The day stretched on, each hour marked by new horrors. We found Rachel's hairbrush, its bristles filled with pine needles instead of hair. Her textbooks appeared in different places around camp, their pages replaced with bark. Her favorite sweater, the red one she'd been wearing in the car, was found shredded and wrapped around a tree branch, spelling out words we couldn't bring ourselves to read aloud.

Tom suggested building a signal fire, but every time we tried to light one, the flames burned black and gave off no smoke. The matches would light normally in our hands but turn to twigs when they touched the kindling. Even the emergency flares in Marcus's kit had been transformed into twisted branches that leaked a sap that smelled like copper.

By late afternoon, the clearing had become our prison. Every attempt to leave ended with us somehow walking in circles, emerging back at camp from impossible directions. The trees seemed to shift when we weren't looking directly at them, their branches reaching lower, their shadows stretching longer than they should.

Mike spent hours copying his research notes onto spare pieces of paper, afraid they too would transform if he didn't preserve them somehow. "The patterns," he kept saying, "there are patterns we're not seeing." But every time he got close to explaining his theories, his words would become jumbled, as if something was actively preventing him from sharing what he'd learned.

Sarah and Dylan had given up their pretense of distance, clinging to each other as if their proximity could ward off whatever stalked us. I caught them whispering about regrets, about wasted time, about things left unsaid. It made my heart ache, watching them find each other again in what might be their final hours.

As dusk approached, Ashley discovered something that shattered what remained of our composure. In Rachel's diary, which had appeared on her pillow while she wasn't looking, the last entry was dated today—hours after she'd disappeared. The handwriting was perfect, unmistakably Rachel's, but the words were wrong:

*"I can see them all now, watching from between the trees. They're so beautiful in their hunger, so patient in their violence. They've been waiting so long for us, for all of us. Seven more to join their dance, seven more to feed their endless hunger. Time moves differently here, in the spaces between moments. I understand now why they chose this place, why they chose us. We're not the first, and we won't be the last. The forest remembers, and so will I."*

The entry ended with a series of symbols that made our eyes hurt to look at them, like hieroglyphs carved by something that had never known human hands.

That night, as the sun began to set, we made our final attempt at normalcy. We gathered our remaining supplies in the center of camp, built a circle of salt that we knew wouldn't hold, and tried to prepare for whatever darkness would bring. Jenny distributed the emergency protein bars, but they crumbled to dirt in our mouths. The water in our bottles had turned thick and dark, though none of us dared to examine it too closely.

Marcus finally broke down, admitting that his uncle had never actually hunted here—the memory had been planted somehow, a lure to bring us to this exact spot. The revelation should have angered us, but we were too exhausted, too terrified to waste energy on blame.

As darkness crept in, we could hear them moving in the forest. Not just one creature, but many, their footsteps a symphony of different rhythms. Sometimes they sounded like hooves, sometimes like bare feet, sometimes like something dragging itself across the ground. The sounds would come from one direction, then suddenly switch to another, as if they were testing our defenses, probing for weaknesses.

And all the while, Rachel's shoes continued to drip their dark message from above, marking the hours until dawn—if dawn ever came in this place where time itself seemed to have lost its meaning.

We huddled together, nine bodies pressed close, trying to draw comfort from each other's warmth. But we all knew the truth that Rachel's diary had revealed: we were never meant to leave this clearing. We were chosen, marked, and delivered here by forces we couldn't comprehend.

Seven more to go.

The night had only begun.

# Chapter 5: The Long Night

Time stopped making sense that night. The darkness seemed to breathe, pulsing with a life of its own, and our watches began spinning wildly—sometimes forward, sometimes backward, as if even the seconds themselves were trying to escape whatever lurked in the shadows.

Tom disappeared first.

We heard him scream at what our phones—before they died completely—said was 9:47 PM. But that couldn't be right, because the sun had just set moments ago, and yet the forest floor was already carpeted with a thick layer of dead leaves that hadn't been there an hour before. The leaves whispered as we ran toward the sound, our flashlights cutting useless arcs through the darkness. The beams seemed to bend around the trees, illuminating everything except what we needed to see.

"Tom!" Marcus called out, his voice cracking. "Tom, where are you?"

The only answer was the soft rustling of leaves beneath our feet and a sound like distant laughter—or maybe crying. It was impossible to tell anymore.

We found his flashlight first, still on, pointing at another message carved into a tree: *SIX*. The beam illuminated something else too—a series of photographs, pinned to the bark with what looked like thorns. They showed Tom at different ages: as a child on his first bike, at his high school graduation, and finally, one that made Ashley vomit into the underbrush—Tom as he was now, but wrong somehow. In the photo, his skin was pale as milk, his eyes completely black, and his smile stretched too wide, filled with teeth that looked like pine needles.

"That's not possible," Jenny whispered, reaching for the photos. But when her fingers touched the paper, they crumbled to ash, leaving only dark stains on the bark that looked disturbingly like handprints... 

TBC...
