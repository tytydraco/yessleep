The nightmares are why I went to therapy.  Usually my dreams weren’t scary. Maybe a little messy and Freudian, sure, but I was relatively nightmare free. When they started, I didn’t even know what was happening. It took weeks of waking up disoriented and with my heart pounding, feeling sick to my stomach, unable to think straight, like I had swallowed adrenaline in bed. A girl I slept with said I started screaming in the middle of the night. She asked if I had any trauma I hadn’t dealt with and then never messaged me back when I asked if she wanted to hang out later. 

Then at some point, I started to remember the nightmares. 

I say them, but it’s really only one. The same nightmare, night after night. 

I was in an enormous house, one I had never seen, although in the dream it was somehow my childhood home. It was nothing like where I actually grew up, which was an unremarkable three bedroom home in a planned neighborhood filled with identical tract housing. The dream house was different. The building seemed infinite, unending hallways and innumerable doors. Spiral staircases and the smell of rot. Marble floors stained with blood, rugs running down hallways that were impossibly long. 

In the dream I was running from room to room, up and down stairs, constantly moving but everywhere i went I could hear her. Footsteps behind me. A deep laugh from a smoker’s lungs, raspy and baritone, echoing at the edge of the room.

Ha.

Ha. 

Ha. 

“Where are you,” the voice called, sounding like a finger tracing my spine. “I want to show you something.” She drew out the words and they crawled all around me. 

What did she want to show me? I didn’t want to know. 

The dream ended the same way. I took the steps into the attic. I don’t want to go to the attic. I want to stop. I opened the door. I don’t want to go in. They say some people can control their dreams.  I’m helpless in mine, always pulled toward the inevitable ending.

The attic was dark and spilling over with children’s toys: broken tricycles, rotting stuffed animals, and old plastic cars. There were so many I walked over them, decapitated action figures cracking under my feet. Step on a crack, break your mother’s back. Rocking horses with too long of manes made enigmatic noises, not quite whinnies, more like human whining. Lightbulbs glowed from bare fixtures and I could sense her behind me. 

“Found you,” she laughed. “Tag.”

I didn’t want to turn but I had no choice. When I did I immediately recognized her. The terrible fast fashion mall clothes she was always wearing the first two seasons, a faded t-shirt and low rise jeans. She had the hood from her hoodie down and her hair spilled over her shoulders. She hadn’t had a recent dye job and black roots clawed from her scalp, invading the washed out blonde strands that inelegantly framed her face. Her long acrylic nails were the color of florescent day glow swamps. 

Something else was behind her. I couldn’t see what it was.

“I missed you,” Jasmine said. Her accent was Florida trash, parking lot amphetamines and probation officers. “You want to see?”

She started to lift up her shirt and I saw her stomach, swollen, large, pulsing. Something under the skin wiggled. She was laughing and then whatever was in her ripped her the taut skin apart, like curtains opening in a theater. 

She screamed, arcing animal noise, wild and inarticulate. Her eyes went milk white and a horrible wet sound started to come from the open wound of her stomach. A terrible hand, red and wet with blood, began to emerge from her ruined abdomen.

That was when I would wake up. The dream always stopped there.

In the therapist’s expensive office in Echo Park, they listened to me, nodded at all the appropriate points, and then explained how dreams are an attempt to process external life using internal logic. 

The house that was/was not my family home? This represented my new condo in L.A., where I had been living for seven months at that point. 

The sense of disarray? The chaos of attempting to adjust to a new world. 

The crushed childhood toys? The transition from the childhood of my career (where I edited a dumb reality show about pregnant teen girls) to the adult version of my career (editing an actual real, feature film). 

Finally, there was Jasmine herself. 

The therapist said she was the symbol of my fear that my old life was chasing me down. That the success I had was only temporary. This phantasm of her in my dream, the therapist said, was my unconscious anxiety over my new career, my new life. I had to acknowledge and confront this and, when I did, I could move on. 

Two months later, I was still having the nightmare and I stopped seeing the therapist. They weren’t helping. 

Sleeping pills got rid of the nightmares — or at least my memory of them — but I didn’t like the muddy feeling they gave me in the morning. I took to staying up late, mindlessly browsing the internet, trying to avoid why I knew was coming. At one point, bored, I mindlessly looked her up. 

Jasmine Bowers. Reality star, best known for her role as an original cast member on the unbelievable trashy and exploitative ITV network reality show, Pregnant Teens. She was born in Florida, which was also her current location, and had recently been fired from the show after being arrested in a road rage incident where she was filmed spewing homophobic and racist profanities. In a relationship with Alden, an unpredictable wannabe influencer and (terrible) white trap rapper with a predilection for inhalants who had served time for multiple misdemeanors. Their relationship was volatile at best. She was twenty six years old. Three kids. One with Alden. Two with different men.  

That was where I paused. Three kids? Didn’t she have another? 

I ran through her run in the show. There was season one, where she had her first child, Davison. The baby daddy left her immediately, didn’t even show up at the hospital, and then later died of an overdose in between seasons three and four. ITV ran a memorial episode where they brought in a hack tv doctor to talk about addition and the dangers of fentanyl. She had her second kid in season three with Brian, an unemployed grifter with a history of domestic violence and petty theft. They broke up in season four and then she was pregnant in season five, or at least I thought she was. Season six she got with Alden and immediately got pregnant, then had an abortion, then got pregnant again. So those were her three kids, but I could have sworn she was pregnant in season five. 

It was bothering me so much I texted Ian. It was four in the morning in California but seven AM on the east coast, so I was hoping he was up and near his phone. He responded quickly, which told me he was at work, killing time at his desk, trying to avoid doing anything. 

What’s up man, he texted back. 

Not much, I replied. Just had a quick question. You’re still at ITV right?

Ugh, yeah. It’s a fucking tragedy. I hate it here 

Ian was the only friend I had at that place. Both of us stuck together for hours at the office, holed up on our laptops, doing that stupid job. We had started an impossible project:  trying to cut the unbelievably trashy footage into something interesting. Our whole idea was we would create a long form movie out of the unused, non-dramatic scenes filmed. We would add extemporaneous footage and outtakes, long shots and quiet moments, like we were attempting to create a cinema verite film out of reality trash. We called it Gimme Kelter, after Gimme Shelter, the legendary documentary, and Kelter, the name of one of the girl’s kids. 

Come to LA, bro, I texted. We can hang 

You know I’d miss the bagels too much. So what’s up? 

I have a weird question. I’ve had a nightmare about Jasmine and I googled her. Do you know how many kids she has? 

Hahahaha you’re having Jasmine nightmares. Shes like a sleep paralysis demon 

I know I know. I’m sure it’s common. But for real, how many kids?

Ugh, let me see. Davidson, Jules, and then what’s her name. Brynn 

Just three? Wasn’t she pregnant in season five 

Ummm idk man. I don’t think so? 

Can you do me a favor? 

Fuck you. Sure 

Can you look at season five footage? Like anything extra? See if maybe she had a miscarriage or something? 

I feel like we’d remember that 

I do too but idk. Weirder things have happened? 

Bubbles and then — 

Yeah sure thing man. I’m slammed right now but I’ll try to hunt something down in the next few days

Bro, thanks so much 

Np. Just hype me up if you ever see Sabrina carpenter. 

*******

I was in a coffee place down the street from my condo when he texted me two days later.

Do you have a second to talk? 

I called him and we made very brief small talk and then he said he had to tell me some stuff. 

“I pulled up season five and looked through her scenes. She’s not pregnant in any of them.”

“Oh, ok, thanks for trying —“ I started to say and then he cut me off. 

“Hang on, I’m not done. After I looked through all the shows I went through the extra stuff. There’s nothing there.” 

“What do you mean?” I asked. I felt like the room had dropped ten degrees. 

“I couldn’t find any outtakes and unused footage of Jasmine for season five. The only stuff we have is just the stuff that was on the show.”

“That’s — dude, that’s really weird. Did they not back it up? Did they somehow lose it?”

“I don’t know, but everything else was there for all the episodes. Nothing missing for any of the other cast members. Just her. The whole season.” 

“Maybe she’s suing or something? Asked for it to be deleted?”

“Yeah, maybe, but there’s more shit.” I could hear the wind coming through the phone. Some of it obscured what he was saying. 

“Are you outside? It sounds crazy windy.”

“Yeah, I am. I wanted to get out of the office to call you. See, i searched for her this morning. Went through all the back ups. And then, after I came back from lunch, this guy was at my desk.”

“What do you mean? Some dude?”

“Some dude. He said he worked for ITV. Some kind of internal capacity, he said. I didn’t quite catch what he said, or what his name was, but he asked me why I was looking at old footage.”

“Umm, that’s weird as fuck,” I said, drumming my hand against the table. 

“Yeah, that’s what I thought too. I said I was just going through stuff for our project.”

“Gimme Kelter?”

“Yup. Gimme fucking Kelter.”

“I told you making that was a good idea,”
I pressed my hand against my forehead, closed my eyes.

“You’re right about one thing in your life and you’re taking a victory lap.” Traffic noises, horns and crosswalk telling pedestrians they can walk cut through his speech. “But, yeah, he seemed to buy it. Said we can’t release it or anything and I said I wasn’t interested in selling it. It was just a project. A way for me to practice editing. That’s all. He said it was cool, and left but uh, it was kind of weird, bro.”

“It sounds really weird. Creepy, actually.” The guys in the coffee shop with laptops — there are always guys in the coffeeshop with laptops; it’s L.A.— glanced at me while I was talking and I realized I was saying too many cryptic things. I got up and stepped outside as Ian kept talking. 

“Anyway, I wanted to update you on this, uh, for lack of a better term, strange development.”

“Thanks, dude. I appreciate all of this.” 

“The things I do for you. You gotta give me all the Kelter when I’m done with this.”

“You got it,” I said and terminated the call in the bright California sunshine. 


****** 

When I got home I looked all over my laptop to see if I had a copy of Gimme Kelter saved anywhere. I thought I had taken a copy when I left ITV but it wasn’t in my files anywhere. Finally a dim memory surfaced of saving a million things on a flash dive at some point and, after still not finding the flash drive anywhere, I realized i still had some boxes stashed at my mom’s house in Michigan. Impulsively, I booked a flight and was at LAX the next morning. The plane was packed and a baby cried the whole time. I stared out the window into the clouds and thought about how it would feel to fall from that height. Would it, for one second, almost feel like flying?

After airport terminal food and renting a mid-size SUV (which still felt absolutely enormous), I drove the forty minutes to my mom’s townhouse. She was on a cruise and I still had a key. I let myself in and watered the cacti, helped myself to a glass of Chardonnay and hunted through my four boxes helpfully labeled “stuff”. 

It was in the last place I looked, which I guess is true about everything. I poured a second glass of wine and plugged the flash drive into my laptop.  

The funniest thing about Gimme Kelter, I thought as I watched, was how not funny it was. Getting the actual emotions, the off camera conversations, the stillness in their eyes, all contrasted with the laughter of their children, or their endless cries, it was all terribly affecting. I watched fascinated as what looked like real life flowed on my computer screen. Of course it wasn’t real: just filmed moments pressed into a sort of reality. If dreams are our unconscious trying to make sense of reality, films are our consciousness trying to make reality into dreams. 

One hundred and three minutes in I refilled my glass of wine and one hundred and four minutes in is when i paused. There was Jasmine in season five, wearing a low cut shirt, talking to Rachelle, an old friend back home.

“Dude,” she said. “I don’t know what I’m going to do with this.” 

Rachelle looked like she always did, hungover or strung out, her pupils pinned. 

“Dude, I don’t know what you’re going to do.”

“For real,” Jasmine sighed, overdramatic as always.

“Do you know who the father is?” 

Jasmine’s face went dead as the camera tracked down to show her swollen stomach. “I have no idea at all.” 


******

So, more weird shit, I texted Ian. 

Bubbles on his end, then, can you FaceTime? 

I called him. He was in his apartment. An Under the Silver Lake poster on the wall behind him. I could see the white door with the three locks. His eyes were red and he hadn’t shaved that day, maybe the day before.

“Hey, you OK?”

“I’m good, man. You say you’ve got weird shit to talk about. You have no idea,” he said, talking in a rush. 

“Really? Because she was pregnant in season five,” I said. Ian slapped the table. 

“Holy shit. They covered it up!”

“They did! Why would they do that?”

“I don’t know but that’s not the only thing.” He leaned closer to the screen. “At work, I left my desk today. There were donuts in the breakroom. Somebody’s birthday.”

“Whose birthday?”

“Camden’s.”

“I don’t know him.”

“He started after you left, but the donuts aren’t the important part. The important part is when  I came back to my desk, I realized I had left my phone there. I went to grab it and I noticed someone had fucked with it.”

“Are you sure?”

“Yeah. I always leave my phone screen down. Every single time. But it was face up.”

“You think someone was trying to get into it?”

“I don’t know, but someone was doing something with it. I was worried you might have texted and there could have been something on the front screen …” 

“No, I hadn’t.”

“From here on, we shouldn’t text about this. Just phone calls.”

“From here on? You’re still into this?”

“Of course I am.” His face broke out into a relived smile. “When do I get to do something that actually feels exciting? The last time I did anything impulsive was when I went home with that girl with a neck tattoo and she robbed my apartment.” 

“I thought she just stole your MetroCard?”

“That story sounds so much more incredible if I don’t get bogged down in specifics,” he said. “But yeah, I’m in. I still want to figure what the fuck is happening here.”

“Me too,” I said.

“So what’s the next step?”

“I think I’m going to talk to the only person who can answer these questions.” 


********

I landed in Florida the next day. It was hot and sticky and I watched a guy have an epileptic seizure near the luggage return. I got an Uber to a hotel near the airport. My credit cards were getting killed on the trip and I thought I could save some money on rideshares.  

The hotel was the kind of hotel that lurks around airports. Generic rooms for people on business trips. A crowded bar at night. Guys away from their families, using apps to get escorts to come over so they can have depressing economic transactions. I took a shower and when I got out the room felt like a jungle, humid and wet, the mirror completely fogged over. I was on the fourth floor, overlooking a parking lot. You could hear the traffic from the interstate bleeding in. Outside, vegetation ran at the edges of everything, an overwhelming supernatural green. 

When I walked back into the bathroom I saw the mirror had unclouded, but left behind a faded patch of fog in the center of the glass, a circle at the top with a long straight line below it, like a balloon ascending up into the skies.  
. 

*****

“So why you going out there?” Marcus, my four and a half star rated driver, asked me. It was later that afternoon, and I was in his silver four door economy car, headed for Jasmine’s place. The sun was too hot in spite of the blaring air conditioning, pulsing through the windows in waves as it played hide and seek in between the tree-line. 

 “If you don’t mind me asking,” he added, in the pause where I was trying to decide what to say. “I’m not trying to violate your sense of privacy. It’s just this address is, uh, well it’s a bit of an infamous local area. I got warned about it from other drivers when I moved down here.” 

“Where are you from?”

“The old country,” he said, then, making eye contact in the mirror, he smiled. “The Bronx.” 

“This place must be a lot different,” I said as we drove past the familiar generic Hell America strip mall/gas station/nightmare vista. 

“You could say that,” he laughed. “It’s quieter, for sure. I moved down here during the pandemic. Shit got too weird in the city for me, man. I needed some space.”

“Yeah, those were weird times.” The pandemic still seemed blurry to me. It was hard to recall parts of it. There was a fuzziness to the days that felt difficult to recall. It still seemed unreal any of it had happened.

“So, are you from ITV? Trying to re-hire her?”

“I’m from there, but no, I don’t want to hire her. Just need to talk to her.” My phone buzzed:, a text from someone. 

“She’s not great at talking. Last time I took someone out there, she wouldn’t open the fort and then her crazy ass husband fired a warning shot.”

“Jesus Christ,” I muttered, slumping into my seat. 

“She’s crazy, man. Why do you want to talk with her?”

“I’m working on a project. Wanted to see if she was interested in participating.” I freed my phone from my pocket. The text was from Ian. Why was he texting? We said no texting.  

“So you are making a new show with her, even after that shit she said?”

“No, I’m an editor,” i said, wondering why I was explaining so much. “I’ve put together some old footage of her. Stuff that wasn’t on the show. I think if I want to do anything with it, I’d need her being ok with it.” 

“Hey, that’s cool,” he said, putting on his turn signal and pausing at a red light. “Almost there.” 

“Great,” I said, looking at my messages. The text was just one word. Mondostro. 


********

“This is it,” he said. I looked out the window at Jasmine’s large, unremarkable house. They had built it in the middle of nowhere, in the middle
of her heyday with the show, when she had endorsements and money was flowing in. Now, there was nothing like that at all and rumors of bankruptcy and troubles with the IRS followed her online. 

“Do you want me to hang here or anything, man? In case it gets weird.”

“No,” I said, eyeing up the home, staring at the way the late afternoon sun hit the windows and made them look like glowing portals. “I’ll be fine. Thanks, though. I appreciate everything.“ 

I got out of the car and heard its doors lock behind me, the scrape of gravel under its wheels as it drove off, leaving me to walk toward the closed door, my long shadow getting there first in the hazy magic hour. 

Before I could knock, the doorbell speaker came
alive.

“Who the fuck are you?” The voice was raspy and southern, immediately familiar to me from the show and (although I tried to not think of it) my nightmares. 

“Hi, jasmine? You don’t know me, but I’m from ITV and I just want —“

I wasn’t able to complete my sentence. 

“Fuck you, motherfucker, and fuck I-mother-T-fucking-V! Y’all assholes fired me! Get off my property or I’ll shoot your ass!”

“Jasmine,” I shouted into the speaker. “I’m not really with ITV! I was, but they fired me! I want to talk to you!”

A pause. I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my chest, my temples. 

“They fired you?”

“They did,” I said, then added. “The fuckers.”

No response. I stood there, unsure if she had stopped talking and was preparing to shoot me when the door opened and there she was.

She looked like she did in my nightmares, minus the swollen stomach. Her face was screwed tightly into a mask of anger and frustration, her eyes glittering. She was wearing cheap plastic flip flops and a hoodie over a logo emblazoned tank top. 

“Who the fuck are you?”

“I used to work at ITV,” I started saying and then I heard a low, deep pulsing behind me. 

“What is that?” I said turning around. The noise was getting louder, closer.

“Shit,” Jasmine hissed.  “Not fucking now, dude!” 

“Are you talking to me?” I asked, facing her, but she was furiously shaking her head.

“Dude, get the fuck out of here! This is not a good time!”

“How am I supposed to get out of here? I don’t have a car?”

“How the fuck did your ass get here without a car? You’re just some kind of super pedestrian?” She was shouting at me, spit spraying out of her mouth, like some kind of rabid animal, then her face went blank and her shoulders slumped. “Fuck me. It’s too late.”  The noise was louder and I heard car tires. 

I turned around to see someone jumping out of a red SUV with a cracked windshield. A guy in camo cargo shorts and a backward hat, holding an energy drink in one hand and his phone in the other, obviously filming. He had a cigarette in his mouth and took a furious last drag, then spat  the still smoldering cigarette into the dirt. 

It was Alden. Jasmine’s boyfriend or ex husband or baby daddy or legal adversary or whatever role he currently occupied in her life. 

“Jasmine, who the fuck is this?” Alden pointed at me, his lip curled into a snarl. 

“I don’t know who the fuck he is! He just showed up!”

“Oh, I get it. He just showed up right? Did he just show up to FUCK YOU!” He screamed the last part and then turned to me. “Why the fuck are you here, dude? Who the fuck are you?”

“Hey,” I lifted my hands up in the air, trying to make the universal gesture for “calm down” but also, perhaps more importantly in this suddenly extremely violate situation, to show I wasn’t holding a weapon. “I’m not trying to upset anyone. I can leave.” 

“Fuck right, you can leave. I don’t even know why you’re here,” Jasmine said. She was standing in the doorway. One of her kids was visible behind her, wearing an oversized shirt and holding an iPad. They were thin with oversized anime eyes and  acted like none of this was surprising at all. 

“You heard her, dude. Get the fuck out.” Alden stepped closer to me. He smelled like body spray and sweat. 

“Yeah, of course. I didn’t mean to be a problem for anyone,” I said. I was trying to back away, but he kept getting closer to me. 

“This is unbelievable,” Jasmine said. “This ITV asshole comes here —“

“You work for them?” Alden stopped advancing, lowered his phone. “You guys are hiring her back! I knew it! I told you, Jasmine, I said those sunuvabitches are going to come crawling back to you, didn’t I?”

“He ain’t working there anymore,” Jasmine said. She was calling someone on her phone. 

“Then why the fuck are you here, dude?” He jabbed an index finger toward me. 

“Yes, I’m having an emergency,” Jasmine said into her phone. “I have a PFA on my ex and he is here right now, violating it.”

“Jasmine!” Alden shouted. “I had to take to you! It’s important! How the fuck else am I supposed to talk to you? You blocked me on facebook!” 

“Goodbye,” she mouthed and began closing the door. An enraged Alden let out an inchoate wail and hurled his phone at the door. It missed, breaking the glass beside the door instead. Jasmine spun toward him. “You’re going to pay for that, you asshole!” 

“Make me!” Alden screamed back. Jasmine stepped forward, her hands clenched into fists, and brushed against me as she advanced toward him. She pulled back at our contact like it had electrified her. “Dude, what was that?”  

“What was what?” Alden shouted at her. She rolled her eyes. 

“I. Am. Not. Talking. To. You,” she said to Alden, patronizingly over-enunciating each word. Then she turned back to me. 

“Who are you,” she asked again, and her voice was strange sounding,  confused and hurt. 

Before I could answer, a car horn sounded. 

All three of us looked toward the noise, I think each of us expecting the worst, only to see a silver, four door economy car. The driver waved. 

“Marcus, holy shit, thank God,” I breathed and took off running across the yard. 

“You better run, you bitch,” Alden shouted at my retreating figure. I grabbed the back door and pulled it open, hurling myself into the car. 

“Go!” I shouted and the car took off. I looked backward to see Alden pulling up his shirt, a tattooed gothic script across his non-existent abs reading KOUNTRYLIFE, the handle of a silver handgun tucked into the waistband of his jeans. Jasmine stood beside him, her long hair damp and unmoving in the endless humidity, her face frozen and distant, her eyes unblinking. Above them heavy grey clouds gathered, a storm coming on. 

I was panting in the back of the car, watching her fade out into the distance, when Marcus cleared his throat. 

“I warned you shit could get a little weird out here, man.” 

We made eye contact in the mirror and both began to laugh, slowly at first and then loud and wild and unending, the echoes of it audible outside the car, rolling out into the coming night.
