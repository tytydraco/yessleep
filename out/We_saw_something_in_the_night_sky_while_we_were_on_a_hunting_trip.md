When I was a teenager, my dad, my sister and myself all drove to Northern New Mexico to a spot called Coyote (Coy Oh Teh) Canyon. My dads best friend had purchased roughly a dozen acres along with his two other brothers up there, and they gave us permission to go up and use it as a base camp for elk hunting. 

The location up there is filled with generation upon generation of old ranching families. A lot of them live by themselves in their grandparents original homes with minimal electricity, some no indoor plumbing, and using old strip irrigation to water their fields. It was really impressive!

It would have been late September or early October sometime during the beginning of the Elk hunting season, and the three of us (my dad, my sister and myself) got to my dad’s friends land. It had a brick and steel building there with a patio on it that acted just as a basic shelter pretty much for a few people. It was brand new but was just a literal concrete floor, brick wall and steel roof shack. 

We pitch our pop-up camper (my dad didn't want to use their shack) in front of the building about ten feet away and head out on the evening hunt. This area is so incredibly dark at night due to no real neighborhoods anywhere, and the land sits inside of a large canyon where no sound from outside it gets in. You’re basically on the dark side of the moon out there. We finish up the evening hunt, and get back to camp right at dusk. We made a point to NOT light a campfire so that we wouldn’t smell like smoke for the morning hunt, (animals notice the smell very easily).

 We sit outside the camper in complete darkness, listening for elk bugling to each other across the canyon. It was incredible. This area is not only dark, but we’ve all heard strange howls and whoops from the woods on occasion, so although the elk and coyotes around us was exciting to listen to, we always kept part of our ears peeled for the strange sounds we’d sometimes hear. My dad’s friends even hid in the shelter one time after they heard something down at the bottom of the land screaming. We all hoped that their story was about a bobcat, but knowing that these guys were experienced woodsmen, we just agreed to not freak out about it since this was such a great hunting spot.

Anyways, we’re all staring up at the sky looking at the stars, trying to point out any possible planets, when all of the sudden, the entire sky lights up completely white. I’m talking from horizon to horizon, in 2 or 3 quick flashes. Kind of like a camera flash. The entire sky lights up as if it’s the middle of the freaking day, but only for a half-second at a time. Think if a massive lightning bolt flashed where there was zero light pollution, except, it was an absolutely clear night! Hence why we were all staring up at the stars. We get super weirded out by this, and are talking amongst each other trying to figure out if some sort of rainstorm is rolling up from somewhere when all three of us (coincidentally looking at the same exact “satellite” at the same exact time) notice that this small red dot that was slowly moving across the sky suddenly stops in its tracks mid-air. 

We all fall silent for a second and my dad asks “do you guys see that satellite?” As soon as my sister and I respond “yes”, this thing starts turning from its previous red color to pure white, and slowly starts coming straight towards us from way off in the sky, getting bigger and bigger as it gets closer. Imagine a single motorcycle headlight in the night, slowly coming closer to you. We all sit up in our lawn chairs, now truly freaking the hell out, when it suddenly stops maybe the distance of a high flying jet away from the ground. You know like those ones that leave the trails across the sky? It came from a orbiting satellite level to an atmosphere level within maybe 5 to 10 seconds. It than makes a direct left, than right, than back to the left, and then freezes again. It stays there for a second or two before going backwards in the direction it came from. 

Keep in mind, it looks like a single car headlight out in the sky, and was impossible to miss at this point. We all just stare in silence as we watch this thing go further back than we had originally seen it, as if it was in outer space now, and slowly gets dimmer and dimmer, and then disappears. 

We all get up, go straight into the camper, and just lay there for a bit in our sleeping bags until we just sort of accept the fact that IF that was a satellite, that it must’ve been falling from the sky and burning up in the atmosphere, but that it wouldn’t have changed directions so many times. We eventually fell silent and went to sleep (somehow, because I was terrified).

To this day, my dad still gets goosebumps telling this story. Him not being able to explain to us what we were seeing that night was genuinely something I'll never forget. I don't know if I want to believe it was aliens, but the general vibe of that dark and old area, the flashing sky and the weird movements this light made are something I still think about regularly.
