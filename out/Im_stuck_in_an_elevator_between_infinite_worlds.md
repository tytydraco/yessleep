Hi reddit! Just a warning, my grammar may not be tip top but... You know what, it doesn't matter right now.  What does matter is the fact I'm stuck in an elevator that's putting me in different dimensions/different places. 

So a little context: I was getting home from shopping, and my apartment's on the fourth floor and I didn't feel like taking the stairs considering I had groceries, So yeah, elevator. 

It hit the third floor and broke. I wasn't too worried, because my building is pretty old and this does happen from time to time, but it is annoying to just be in the dark. My phone was dead at the time, so no flashlight.

Yeah, I know, how can I possibly be on my phone if it's dead? Simple, dear reader: I carry a battery.

Speaking of it's only got three green dots of power left, s,o let's hope I can find a way back before not being able to contact anyone. 

When the elevator came back on, I didn't really immediately notice any changes until I heard the music. Because this place has elevator music, and my apartment elevator doesn't.  I was pretty confused, so I payed more attention, and it was cleaner, too. No carpet stains. No graffiti, none of that. So of course I wondered if I'd fallen asleep, but nope! Pinched myself.

So then the doors open, and I go to walk out on instinct, but what stops me is the fact the apartment door facing the elevator doesn't open. On my floor, the elevator is sat on the opposite wall of an apartment. The lady who lives there opens the door and glares whenever anyone comes up. It's not a delay, either, it's like she just waits at the door, because it opens the moment the elevator makes that dinging noise. And she doesn't open the door. I just kind of waited there until the door closed, and I felt it go down.

I had a bad feeling at this point, because this was not the right elevator and that was not my floor. So I push the button for my floor again. It doesn't even stop, it just keeps going down. So at least that's normal.

The next time, I was in a different place. There was a window in front of me, which seemed... Fine? I don't know. The sky was green. I still didn't get out, and I hope to god that I'm just hallucinating. Maybe the mold finally got to me, and I'm just collapsed in my apartment building Speaking of which, how the hell do I leave?

I know it seems like I'm not panicking here, but I'm barely keeping it together. I do have my groceries, which is just a thing if bananas, a couple of clementines, and a frozen pizza along with some soda. I'm writing this while the elevator is moving, no idea what crap's going to be there when it stops. I've dabbled in the backrooms, so I at least have some sort of liminal spaces, plus have been trying to contact people, but I can't text anyone and there's only cell service when the doors open. I don't know if the cell service is going to send this to my reality or whatever reality the doors show, but I'm going to send it and hope I can get replies.

Reddit, I will update if and when I can, but your ideas and comments would be greatly appreciated.
