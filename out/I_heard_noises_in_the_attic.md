“Did you hear that?” My wife asked, poking her head into the office.

“Hear what?” I glanced up from my computer.

“That. It sounded like a bird trapped in our attic.”

I got up and went to the living room. All I could hear were distant cars and dogs barking outside.

“I don’t hear anything.”

“I swear it’s a bird. It was whistling.”

I moved to the kitchen, trying to discern the noise. “If it makes you feel better, I’ll go up there and shoot whatever’s bothering you.”

“No, don’t kill it! Just go up and see what it is.”

“Ugh. Fine.”

I made my way toward the garage. Ruffled my toddler’s hair as I passed by in the dining room.

“Doing good, buddy?”

“Yes, Daddy."

I wrenched the door open, finding myself in our garage. Right above my head was the attic door.

*Ugh.* I shuddered. I hated going up there. Ever since we’d moved, the space felt spooky, like another world was living above our heads.

“Careful, Daddy.”

I spun to the kitchen doorway. My toddler was watching me with a fearful expression.

“Hey, sweetie. Didn’t see you there.”

“It’s not safe.”

“Why not?”

“That’s where the kitty lives.”

*The kitty?* “What kitty?”

“The kitty that speaks to me. Sometimes it whispers in my ears while I sleep. It’s not nice.”

I locked eyes with him for a moment. “Remember, those are dreams and dreams aren’t real.”

“Okay, Daddy.”

I sighed wearily as I ascended the ladder. The thing was narrow. I could barely haul myself up without falling off.

*Next house we buy, I’m installing a bigger one.*

I reached the empty space and shined my phone’s flashlight into the darkness. The area felt cold for the middle of summer, like it was harboring a wintry climate.

“Any birds up here?" I shouted. "If you are, it’s time to leave.”

I pumped my fist against a slanted beam, half-expecting a robin or a titmouse to come fluttering out.

But there were no signs of anything.

I started back down. As soon as my left foot hit the lowest rung…

… a sharp whistle crashed into my ears.

“Did you hear that?!” My wife shouted from the kitchen.

The whistle grew in volume, mixed with a twinge of insanity.

“It’s the kitty!” My son’s voice drifted in from the house.

I climbed back up and hoisted myself onto the attic’s floor. I searched the rafters, hoping to catch sight of some deranged bird.

The volume increased and I doubled over, a burning sensation hitting my ears.

*Oh god. It hurts.*

Finally, the noises stopped. I glanced up into the rafters, noticing…

… something watching me.

Whatever it was slinked down and landed next to me. It slipped past, soundless, like a predatory cat, and headed for the ladder, moving its dark form with effortless grace.

“Honey! What’s going on?!”

*Kathryn.* I wanted to scream. My voice refused. *Get out. Take Joey and run.*

I tried to move, but my muscles disobeyed. I was paralyzed and mute, watching this panther-like entity creep toward the exit.  

“Honey! I’m getting concerned. Should I call your uncle?!”

*Jesus, Kathryn! Just go! Someone… please… help…*

I managed to reach out. Pull myself up by a beam. And swing a hand out toward the creature.

The thing turned and focused its yellow eyes on me. Its slimy lips pursed and emitted the most unholy sound…

… then I passed out…

An hour later, the EMTs found me sprawled on the garage floor. My nose and two ribs were broken. My ears were bleeding and I had two gashes on my chest.

The paramedics lifted me carefully and carried me out on a stretcher.

I’m not sure when I arrived at the hospital. It’s been maybe two days. I still can’t speak. Every time I open my mouth, a painful wheeze comes out. And my ears… they work on and off, so I miss half of everything that’s said.

At least I have control over my arms and legs again. And thankfully, Kathryn and Joey are safe. They’re at my dad’s, trying to wrap their brains around what happened.

My uncle checked the attic. He said there’s nothing up there but a few scratch marks in the wood.

All I can do is rest in this hospital room and type this experience on my phone. I can’t sleep. All I can think about is, *What was that thing? How’d it get up there? And will it ever come back?*
