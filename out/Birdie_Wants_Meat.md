The Outback is not our world. It never was. Its beauty is the beauty of the tiger, ever so graceful, but only meant to be admired from afar. Its secrets were never meant for us.  And maybe, it should stay that way, but I didn’t know that, not until it was too late to rewrite the decisions of the past.



The most absurd thing is that I never thought I would lay my head to rest under the endless Australian sky, and especially not in the land of emptiness. But life tends to dance to its own music, and so, it happened.



I met Victoria at the university, back in the UK. I don’t even remember which class we shared, but I remember my first impression of her honey hair forming a glory around the perfect, round face. When I was in middle school, I had an aquarium, and one single neon tetra, adopted into a school of other fish. She reminded me of that tetra, the way its brilliant scales glowed through the dull grey of the other fish, was similar to how she shined out of the crowd of broken dreams and failed exams. The world would be a much better place if neon tetras lived longer.



After we graduated, we moved to a small apartment in London, and started settling into our hamster wheel of a life, designed just for us, fogged by the dripping English rain. That was until the job offer. It wasn’t particularly good or outstanding, but at that point, we felt so ill of our life, that it caused me and my five months pregnant wife to leave behind everything, from our pigeon poop-stained window frames to our lemon-sour relatives.



After we arrived in Alice Springs, two things quickly became clear. First was that the place is in the middle of bloody nowhere, and second is that although the job was administration for a cattle farm (with a surprisingly good salary, for what it was), it could be done mostly from home office, as the main thing was organizing their documentations about the cows, which honestly felt like tracking through the labyrinth of the minotaur without the golden thread. 



Settling into our new life wasn’t easy. The breaking point came when after we found out that both our jobs were mostly done from home, we started looking for houses. It was Victoria’s idea. She wanted to see the stars illuminating a path through the desert, and wake to the flocks of wild budgies chirping on the roof, while passing by. I said that we could find all of that in Alice Springs, but she was adamant that it isn’t the same. Despite everything, I understand her now.



I loved our house from the moment I saw it. The cube shaped building stood at the end of the red dirt road like a reminder of a species in the vast plains, its yellow walls softening the red dust, the bottlebrushes shielding it from the wilderness. It wasn’t modern by any means, the floor creaked, and the third stair leading to the floor was weirdly unstable, but these things made the house breathe.



And so, we lived there, in the middle of nowhere, only getting company from the bearded dragons sunbathing on the fenceposts, and the birds flying through. The city was a one-and-a-half-hour drive, and the nearest neighbour was half an hour. It was truly peaceful. Just me, and my shining little tetra. And when Victoria was by my side, even the Eden wouldn’t have been able to compete with the Outback.



Life went on for a while. After four months, our son was born. I remember holding him in my hands for the first time, feeling the life racing in every cell of his little body. Johnny was followed by Rusty, the cat, who we found on the road one day, ginger fur stained by the blood red dust. He became inseparable from Johnny, following him on all his adventures like a dog. Johnny grew up to be six years old this way. Rusty by his side, catching thorny devils, racing with the bearded dragons, climbing after the budgies, and howling with the dingos in the distance.



But it wasn’t only Johnny that changed. Sometimes we left him with one of the two babysitters in the town, and went out for the night. Victoria loved to dance. It was a beautiful sight, her golden hair flying after her, trying to keep up. But on these evenings, we also heard tales. Tales from the old folk, dry like the desert around us. They knew the Outback, and listening to them would save your life. So, we listened. We learned not to look directly at the tall, lanky figures walking on the edge of the horizon. We learned to draw the curtains if the bearded dragons suddenly all hid, leaving behind their fence posts standing in the desert, like ribcages of a long-forgotten being. We learned to listen to the wind, when it raced through the bushes, howling about memories of the ocean. We learned how to pick up the venomous snakes so they would curl around our arm like a smooth, shiny bracelet, and never bite. And after a while, we thought that there wasn’t anything to learn anymore.



The cancer came silent, slithering in the red dust, scaring away life. I watched as my wife, and with her my soul slowly faded, leaving behind nothing, but fading memories. The desert lost its blossom with her. The budgies never stopped on the roof again, and the bottlebrushes didn’t raise new flowers.



But it wasn’t only my world that shattered. Johnny lost his mother at an age no one should, and for a long time, he was but a mere husk of himself. He stopped playing around the house, and would only lay in his bed the whole day, accompanied by Rusty, who grieved in his own way as well. And after he walked out into the red plains one day, never to return, I seriously thought that it would be too much, and I would lose my son to the emotional dread which no six years were to experience in an ideal world.



That’s while I was so surprised, when one day I head him speaking in a somewhat cheerful voice as I walked past his room. So, I stopped, and knocked on his door. I wanted to know what happened.

\-You can come in. -he answered.

\-Who did you talk to? -I asked as I opened the door.

\-Birdie. He climbed up to the window.

\-Who is birdie?

\-He is an animal. I saw him outside sometimes, and whistled to him, and he came here. He is funny. He has a crest like a cockatoo.

\-That’s great sweetie! I hope he’ll come back.

\-Me too. I want to play with him more.

And that was that. At first, I thought that Johnny created an imaginary friend to cope with the loss, and honestly, I couldn’t blame him at all. It was until he started stealing met from the freezer.



Working at the cattle farm had the benefit of them often sending huge quantities of unused meat as a bonus, so we never really had to buy anything of the sort, as we were always stocked with high quality beef. But now I started noticing pieces going missing. For a time, I didn’t care. I had seen weirder things in the Outback, so I figured we unknowingly make our offerings to it this way. That was until I caught Johnny sneaking a frozen chunk upstairs, his little hands gripping to it like his life depended on that piece.

\-What are you doing? -I asked as I stepped in front of him.

\-It’s for Birdie. He wants meat. -he answered with the self confidence that only kids around that age have.

\-And can Birdie eat it? -I asked, still thinking it was an imaginary friend, and already picturing rotting piles of flesh under my son’s bed.

\-Yeah, of course he can, silly. Come, I’ll show you!

And so, I followed him to his room, where he placed the quickly defrosting beef in front of the open window. A few minutes passed, and a head appeared, quickly followed by the body. My first thought when I saw Birdie was that he looked like a roadrunner. Just a bit bigger, around the size of a large dog. But as far as I knew, roadrunners don’t live here, and when I looked closer, I noticed some differences. His beak was a lot bigger than a roadrunner’s and he held his wings weird, rather letting them hang under his chest than tucked to his sides. Large talons shined on his legs, like two half moons rising over an alien landscape.



He chirped as he saw Johnny, then jumped over to him, and let my son pet his head. That was the moment he noticed me. The moment that happened, he froze, only his crest rising up. Then he hissed and me, and proceeded to turn and jump out of the window. Johnny looked up at me, and I felt the spark leaving his eyes.

\-You scared him. -he said it in a voice so numb, that I knew I couldn’t let this happen again unless I want to lose the only thing left of the world I once loved.

\-I’m sorry Johnny. I’m so sorry. I promise I won’t come in when he is here, okay?

He didn’t say a word, just wiped a single little diamond tear from his eye, and nodded.

Now you might think I was stupid for letting an unknown creature play with my son unattended, but you have to understand that I couldn’t do anything else if I wanted to see my son happy ever again. I thought that Birdie was one of the things of the Outback, that are just there without question. And Victoria belonged here. My little neon tetra became the colour of the desert, breaking the red with her shining rainbow. So, I believed my son could be the same. And I still do. But I was wrong about the purpose of Birdie. Maybe his species belonged to the Outback, or maybe it didn’t, but they definitely weren’t one of the gentle spirits floating through the plains.



After our unfortunate first meeting, Birdie’s visits became more and more common. And even though I never went into Johnny’s room after the event, I started seeing him as well. A long, feathered tail disappearing into a bush by the side of the road. One single feather, brown like the depths of the earth, in front of the door. Birdie sitting on a fencepost, a bearded dragon hanging from his mouth, his yellow eyes meeting mine, as he maintained eye contact, while gulping down the poor little reptile. And then, one day while Johnny was in school, laughter came from his room. My son’s sweet giggles. I tore the door open, and was greeted by Birdie. He was standing on a teddy bear, the large claw piercing through the hearth of the plushie. Around them was a drawing, tore to pieces. Birdie looked up, crest rising, teeth bared, then jumped out of the open window, taking a shred of paper with him. It only hit me later that birds usually don’t have teeth.



After he left, I stepped into the room, and sat on the floor, to collect the pieces. It was a drawing of us. I remembered it. Johnny made it before his mother was gone, and ever since the red desert dust started making its way into our hearts, he kept it on his little desk. The drawing showed me hugging Victoria, and Johnny squeezed between us, with Rusty at his legs. It was the quality you would expect from a six years old, but he put so much of his little soul in it that you could particularly feel it shine through the paper. Only now, the drawing was thorn to two halves. Victoria, Rusty, and half of Johnny were missing, with only the torso of my son remaining, while the other parts stuck between the sharp teeth of a bird. The remaining half was also thorn. My body was split into two parts, and pieces of my arm and legs were missing. Johnny lost half his face, making the drawing look like some messed up fanart of The Walking Dead. I carefully put the pieces together, then arranged them on Johnny’s desk.



When we arrived home, he was heartbroken, but wanted to see Birdie again. He hoped he bought back the piece he stole. But, of course, he didn’t, and the drawing soon disappeared. Johnny couldn’t bear to look at the remaining pieces anymore. And to be honest, neither could I.



But still, I wouldn’t be writing this, if today hadn't come. It started innocently enough, when Johnny yelled from his room in excitement.

\-Birdie brought his friends!

I was concerned. By this point, I didn’t like whatever creature Birdie was at all. But my son’s happiness still mattered more. If I chased off that damn thing, I wouldn’t have been able to look in the mirror afterwards. So, I kept silent. That was until the next scream.

\-Daddy, please come here! Make them leave! I don’t want to play with them anymore!

I got up so fast that the chair fell to the floor like a bird struck by lightning.

Johnny’s room was a total mess. Bookshelves on the ground, books spread out on the floor, their colourful covers like a flowerbed. Boxes and toys pulled out from the wardrobes, torn to shreds by the claws and teeth of the creatures. There were six of them in the room, backing up my son to the door. They bared their teeth, their front limbs reaching to Johnny, with their long, clawed fingers appearing under the plumage, the large claws on their legs pulled backwards like triggers. Birdie was in the middle of them, needle pupils sinking into Johnny, as I scooped him up from the floor, hugging him tight like the day I first held him.



With my crying son in my arms, I bolted down the stairs, to the front door, only stopping to catch the keys of the trusty old jeep, waiting right outside. Screams erupted from the rooms around, filling everything. I heard the cries of a cat, mixed with the ear-pinning danger signal of budgies. I heard Johnny laugh and cry at the same time, while calling my name from the third direction. I heard my hopeless cries, which echoed in the garden, late at nights after Victoria was gone. I heard my wife laugh.



And with tears blurring my vision, I reached the front door, while the crying, screaming, laughing birds, which weren’t really birds, swarmed from the rooms, lunging at me and the life carried in my arms. Then I started the jeep, and as the stubborn old motor roared to life, we left behind our home, speeding by the ribcages of the empty fenceposts, red dust clouding everything, followed by the gaze of the unseen eyes of the figures on the horizon.



The things busted out from the house we once called home, led by the one that once bought joy to my son. Others joined in from the desert, stained by the dust-blood of the Outback, knocking into the sides of the car, only to bounce back to the ground, like fallen angels. But after a while, they slowly disappeared, one by one, into the place they emerged from. And by the time we reached Alice Springs, covered in dust and scratches, there were none left.



I wrote this from the car. We’re in a parking lot and Johnny is asleep on the back seat, dreaming of a world, which he deserves. Tomorrow, we will leave behind this town. I will drive where the road takes us. And I know it will lead to safety.



There’s one single pet shop in Alise Springs, right after the point where we arrived into the city, and as we left it, a sign caught my eyes. “Attention, Aquarists! New Tropical Fish Arrived!” it read, and above the text, a picture of a neon tetra.
