The first time I saw the lamp, I was six years old. It stood in the corner of my grandmother’s parlor, tall and regal, as if it had always been there. I remember tracing my fingers over its gilded frame, mesmerized by the way the glass sphere caught the light, each fragment glowing like a captured star. It was always bright and alive in her home, giving the sense that time there was gentler.

My grandmother had laughed, and told me it was a family heirloom, a piece of history passed down through generations.

My grandmother had always been a difficult woman, exacting in her expectations, sharp in both mind and tongue. Even in old age, she carried herself with an air of authority, as though the world itself bent to accommodate her. She was always impeccably groomed—her silver hair never straying from its perfect set, her nails manicured to a soft shine, her clothing rich in fabric but never ostentatious. Though time had creased her skin, it retained an almost unnatural glow, untouched by the frailty that plagued others her age. And, unlike the rest of the family, she had never been sick a day in her life.

I was her favorite. The golden child, the one she paraded before the rest of the family with pride. "You have something special in you," she would say, her eyes gleaming with something I couldn't quite place. "A spark. A promise."

Back then, I didn't question it. I basked in her warmth, in the gifts and whispered praises that set me apart from my cousins. But things changed. I grew up. I made mistakes. A tattoo here, a failed class there, a cigarette between my lips that she caught me with one evening on the back porch. And with every misstep, her warmth faded. By the time I was in my twenties, we barely spoke.

Then she died.

It was sudden—too sudden. One day she was fine, and the next, she was confined to her bed, her body wasting away as if something unseen was devouring her from within. The doctors were baffled. I was terrified.

She left everything to me.

The house, the land, her vast fortune. The will surprised no one, though my relatives made sure I felt their resentment. In the end, I let them have the money, keeping only the estate. I told myself it was guilt—guilt for being her favorite, guilt for disappointing her, guilt for not being there at the end.

But the truth was, I couldn’t bear to part with the house. With its grand Victorian structure nestled against the thick woods, it was the only place where I had ever felt truly at home.

I should have left it behind.

Soon though, I came to the grim realisation that without my grandmother’s fortune, maintaining the estate was impossible,  so I planned to sell it. But before I let go, I wanted one last thing. One piece of her to keep.

The lamp.

The house loomed ahead, its dark silhouette stark against the moonlit sky. It had been years since I’d last set foot on the estate, and yet it felt as though it had been waiting for me, untouched by time. It should have been comforting—familiar—but something about its stillness unsettled me.

The lamp stood exactly where I remembered, unchanged. Not a speck of dust clung to its surface, as if some unseen force kept it perpetually pristine. Its body, wrought from iron and bathed in a golden hue, carried the whisper of a mystery—perhaps gilded, perhaps truly gold. Three curved legs supported its weight, each one adorned with delicate embellishments, a dance of european victorian refinement entwined with eastern opulence.

But it was the glass sphere that truly captured the eye, a mesmerizing orb suspended from the ornate iron frame, cradling the light within. This was no ordinary glass. It was a kaleidoscope of hues, so rich, so intricate, that to name them all would be impossible. The lower half resembled the mosaic lanterns of the East, fragments of jewel-toned glass pieced together like a celestial puzzle. Yet as the gaze ascended, the colors shifted, the patterns evolved. What were once mere shards of color became luminous stained-glass windows, each row unveiling a tale.

The first row told of boundless forests, giving way to cultivated fields, where figures toiled under the golden sun. The second row grew darker—those same people now suffered, their crops withered, their faces gaunt with hunger and disease. Desperation etched itself into the glass, sorrow held captive in color. But then, a transformation: from the depths of the forest, ethereal beings emerged, tall and graceful, their presence otherworldly. A silent accord was struck, and among the mortals, one figure, a woman, followed the beautiful beings into the trees.

The final row, smallest and closest to the top, was a vision of prosperity. Those who once suffered now thrived, abundance spilling from their hands, their lands reborn in splendor. The lamp, in its quiet brilliance, did not merely illuminate a room—it told a story, woven in light and shadow, a testament to hope, sacrifice, and the unseen forces that shape fate.

Getting it out of the house was harder than I expected. It was heavier than it looked, delicate in ways that made me afraid to touch it too harshly. My ex-boyfriend helped me. We hadn’t spoken much since the breakup, but he offered without hesitation, lifting it into my car with a teasing remark about my taste in antiques.

It had been beautiful in my grandmother’s house. But in my own tiny, cramped apartment, it was suffocating. The light was always on me, its presence oppressive. 

At first, I let it glow, its warmth a quiet echo of the home I had left behind. But soon, it became unbearable. The migraines crept in—not sudden or sharp, but a dull, relentless pressure that settled behind my eyes. And though it made little sense, though I couldn't even explain it now, I blamed the lamp. It felt absurd. The light had always been so gentle, so pure. And yet, I begun to resent it, to blame it for the unease I felt creeping into my life. I tucked it away, its heavy frame shoved into the corner of my closet, its glass hidden beneath a dust-cloaked sheet.

Then, the nightmares began.

I dreamed of my ex first—his car crushed, his body twisted at unnatural angles, blood seeping into the pavement. I woke up gasping, my chest tight. When I checked my phone, the screen was flooded with messages.

He had been in an accident. Just like in my dream. And he wasn’t waking up. A coincidence, I told myself.

I tried to shake the feeling, but it clung to me, thick and suffocating. 

Then came the second misfortune: the sale of the house fell through. A last-minute complication, something about the deed, something no lawyer could quite explain.

And then, the third: my apartment. The place I had carefully curated into my sanctuary, was suddenly unlivable. Toxic mold, spreading fast, a health hazard so severe that I had no choice but to leave. My landlord’s apologies were drowned beneath the urgent need to vacate. I had nowhere to go. The house, my grandmother’s house, was waiting.

So, I returned to the estate.

I told myself it was temporary. That I would find another buyer, another place. But the moment I stepped inside, I had the unsettling feeling that I wouldn’t be leaving.

The lamp now back in its rightful place, casting its golden glow across the parlor. As if it had never left. I told myself I wouldn’t use that room often. I wouldn’t have to look at it.

But as I was setting it down, that was when I saw it—the new glass panel. I could not remember if it had always been there. Now I'm certain it hadn't.

At the very top, where before there had been only light, there was now something more. A place bathed in unnatural brilliance. A scene that hadn’t been there before. A world, filled with golden light and vibrant flowers. Two figures stood at the center, hands clasped, a child between them. Around them, others danced in celebration, their faces eerily familiar.

Something deep inside me whispered that I had seen this place before. That I had been there.

And I knew, with a bone-deep certainty, that I would see it again.

The nightmares returned, soon after my move.

In them, I was always walking, bare feet pressing into damp earth, my breath visible in the cold air. The forest stretched endlessly ahead, a living tunnel of whispering leaves. And always, just beyond reach, a figure waited. Cloaked in shadow, neither welcoming nor hostile. It was terrifying. It was comforting. It was familiar.

Then the sickness came slowly, creeping in the way rot takes hold of wood—silent at first, unnoticed, until it was too deep to ignore.

It started with the migraines. The same relentless, pounding ache that had started in my apartment. But now, it was worse. It wasn’t just my head—my body ached, my limbs grew heavy, like I was wading through water, my joints stiff, as if I had run miles in my sleep. Some mornings, I woke up drenched in sweat, the sheets tangled around my legs. Other times, I found dirt beneath my fingernails, a thin layer of soil smeared across my bare feet.

I started sleeping with the door locked.

The dreams did not stop.

The forest called to me.

It was a pull, subtle at first, like a thought lingering at the back of my mind. But as the days passed, it became stronger. I would catch myself staring out the window, toward the treeline, my breath slowing, my pulse steadying, as if my body knew something my mind refused to grasp. 

Initially, my dreams were only glimpses—the silhouette in the trees, the feeling of damp moss beneath my feet. But then, they stretched longer. I saw more.

The figure was not a stranger.

The realization came slowly, seeping in through the cracks of my mind like water through fractured stone. I had been there before. I had followed before.

The first time I had wandered into the woods, I must have been no older than five. My grandmother had been distracted, entertaining guests, and I had slipped away unnoticed. I remembered the feeling of the earth beneath my bare feet, cool and damp. I remembered the way the air smelled—green, rich, humming with something I couldn't name. I remembered hearing laughter, soft and lilting, just ahead of me.

And then—nothing.

I must have made it back to the house. I must have, because no one ever spoke of it. But now, in the dead of night, I could almost recall hands—cool, slender fingers brushing against my skin. A voice, distant yet familiar, whispering my name.

"You were meant to return."

Why had I forgotten?

My grandmother’s words echoed in my  skull, overlapping with the voice in the dream.  
*"You have something special in you. A spark. A promise."*

A promise.

My stomach turned.

Why did it feel like there was something I had to do?

I stumbled to the parlor, my breath uneven, my skin clammy with sweat. The lamp stood waiting, its light unwavering, casting shifting colors across the darkened room.

My family’s fortune. My grandmother’s impossible health. The whispers of bad luck that seemed to follow us when we strayed too far from this land. Everything made sense now. The lamp had been telling the story all along.

It had never been luck. Not for my grandmother, nor for the generations before her. The wealth, the health, the unshakable prosperity of our bloodline—it had all come at a cost. A pact sealed long ago, binding our family to something ancient and merciless. A promised daughter in marriage to the one who dwelled beneath the trees. Not stolen. Not sacrificed. Given. A bride, to bind our family to theirs, to maintain the balance, to ensure their blood remained strong. In return, our family thrived. Wealth, health, prosperity—it was never a gift. It was a contract, that demanded balance. And I—I had unknowingly broken it. I was meant to go to them. To step willingly into the woods, just as some of my ancestors once had. But I hadn’t. I had left, abandoned the house, the quiet pull of the forest. And so, the debt had to be paid another way. My grandmother—no longer protected, no longer untouchable—had withered in my place. A life for a life. But the contract is still unfinished. The forest is still waiting. And it will take what is owed.

The glass has changed again.

The fields are gone. The celebrations, the dancing figures—gone.

The only image left is the forest. And at its center, a waiting figure cloaked in shadow.

I do not need to see their face to know who it is.

I have already met my groom.

I can hear something now—soft laughter, the rustling of leaves, the whisper of my name.

The fae do not take kindly to broken promises.

And I was always meant to return.
