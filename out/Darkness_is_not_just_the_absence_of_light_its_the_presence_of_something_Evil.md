Darkness is not just the absence of light; it’s the presence of something that is sinister.

Jason’s Journal

My apartment was dark as a cave, the walls madly scribbled with drawings that could only be read by me. The room was full of the smell of drying coffee mixed with a slight odor of fungus. The dim light from a flickering bulb cast shadows playing around the walls, making my scrawls appear alive.

“You’ve got to listen,” I said, looking around the room, my voice booming in the silent night like a continuous stream of mumbling and whispering. “They’re coming after you guys; they know your past.”

The voices grew louder in my head, mixing into chaos. Clutching my head and trying to block out any noise proved futile as the whispers intensified. Shadows crawled up the walls, twisting and writhing like snakes, closing in as if they were trying to tie me up.

“Who’re you talking to?” asked a voice from the dark. I turned quickly, my heart racing as I faced her, only to see her back turned toward me in a corner of darkness, absorbing all the scant light in the room, making it dimmer than ever.

At the rear corner lurked a figure wrapped in shadows, an unseeable face engulfing every bit of light and deepening the darkness.

My eyes widened with terror. “No one?” he whispered, then louder, “I’m talking to no one,” trying to convince himself. He felt powerless as the words failed to quell his growing fears.

The figure moved forward, bringing with it an almost tangible sense of dread. “Liar,” it hissed. “You can’t escape me! I know everything. My  thoughts echoed, amplifying the  panic.

I stumbled back, my  path impeded by rubble—empty cans, scattered papers, and broken furniture. “Leave me alone,” I  begged, but the only response was a cold, lifeless laugh that chilled him to the core.

“You did this to yourself,” the figure whispered, making Jason shiver. “You cannot run away from reality.”

The idea of impending doom as the ghostly figure closed in made Jason panic. It felt like the walls were closing in on him, and the drawings on them twisted into mocking shapes. Shadows reached out as if to pull him into the abyss.

I dropped to my  knees, weeping noisily, his cries echoing through the apartment. The walls throbbed, taunting him.

“Stop it!!” I  cried, straining his voice. But there was no escape from the engulfing darkness. Above him stood the figure with glowing, evil eyes.

“You cannot escape from yourself,” it muttered with a sadistic tone. “You are the one who hurt yourself the most.” These words were the final blow that shattered my  sanity.

With an anguished roar, everything went black for Jason one last time. The apartment fell silent, devoid of murmurs or shadows.

I woke up in a cold sweat, terror pounding in his chest. As I  sat up and took stock of his surroundings, I  realized he was lying on a sterile hospital bed. Bright fluorescent lights illuminated the room, and a soft melody extracted from his heavy head, echoing through the darkness like a lullaby.

“Jason , you’re safe now,” said a nurse soothingly. “You had a bad episode, but you’ll get help.” Her words were a balm on my  frayed nerves.

My breath rose and fell. The terrible nightmare had vanished like an illusion, replaced by the comforting reality of the hospital room.
