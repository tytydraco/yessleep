My name is Digbar. I’m posting this story here as a last-ditch effort to prepare everyone for this year’s Halloween. 

Before you ask- yes, I’ve already told my parents and the police everything about what happened last Halloween. My parents thought I was losing it, and the cops thought I was playing a bad prank. If only they were there that fateful night. 

That leaves this Reddit community as my only hope to warn people about the coming storm. On Halloween, something terrifying stalks the streets and picks off trick-or-treaters. Last year, my friends and I became its targets.

It started out like our last three Halloweens at BDSU (Big Dih State University); me and my friends Alex and Will met up in my dorm, decked out in stupid costumes and ready for a fun night of drinking and free candy. This year, we all decided to dress up as James Bond and to wear purple bandanas on our heads. Don’t ask me why we wore the bandanas, I couldn’t tell you. Then we formulated our plan- we’d pregame, go trick-or-treating in the nearby neighborhood, and then go clubbing. You’re never too old for trick-or-treating, and you’re never too buzzed either. At least, that’s what we thought when we set off for the neighborhood, candy buckets in our hands and booze in our systems. Sure, we were smart enough to never drive after drinking, but we weren’t smart or sober enough to watch out backs. As we walked across the moonlit DSU campus and towards the nearby neighborhood, something malevolent was watching us. 

I’m sure it wasn’t fun for a tired parent to see three college students knock on their door and yell “TRICK OR TREAT!” in a fake British accent. Luckily, all the houses we came across were still happy to give us candy. By the time we’d completely filled out candy buckets, it was already 10:30. The tall oak trees of the neighborhood blocked any moonlight from reaching us, keeping the whole street dark and gloomy. At that point, it was too dark out and we felt too drunk to walk all the way to the club, so I got us an uber. The app told me it’d arrive in 15 minutes. Looking to pass the time, me and Alex sat down on the sidewalk and began to gorge on our sugary loot. Will didn’t sit down with us. Instead, he stood straight as a plank, looking down the dark road before us. “Will? You good man?” I asked. Will didn’t respond. Me and Alex exchanged confused looks- maybe Will had more to drink than we thought. Alex stood up and lightly pushed Will to get his attention. 

That’s when Will snapped.

“DON’T- look I’m sorry man. But I could’ve sworn someone was fucking staring at us from behind that tree.” He pointed at one of the oaks about a hundred feet down the road. Alex, obviously a little shaken, nervously laughed. “Chill the fuck out man, you’re just drunk. We’re the only ones out here right now.” No sooner did Alex finish his sentence before something darted behind that same damn tree. 

All the blood drained from Alex’s face. I felt a shiver run down my spine. I bolted up and stood next to my two friends. We were all pretty athletic and we knew how to fight, so not too much scared us. But something felt so wrong about that thing spying on us from behind that tree. It didn’t feel like we were being watched by a person, it felt like we were bring watched by an animal, a predator. “Hey you creep! We can see you!” I shouted, hoping to draw out or scare off our stalker. “If you don’t stop hiding right now, we’re gonna come over there and-“ 

Just then, it stepped out from behind the oak tree. It looked… like a grandma. Imagine the most stereotypical grandma you can think of. Frizzy hair, glasses, floral dress, hunched over a cane- the full combo. All three of us sighed in relief; it was just some poor old woman who’d gotten lost. She began to hobble over to us, and I began to think of how to apologize. After all, this poor little lady had probably been just as scared and confused as we were. But as she got closer, I started to feel weirded out again. 

She was hobbling over to us way too quickly, like she didn’t even need her cane. Hell, it looked like she was faking the hobble too. She also wasn’t as little as I thought; hunched, sure, but big and broad-shouldered like a goddamn linebacker. Her hair looked like a wig, and her glasses were actually just cheap sunglasses. “What the fuck?” Will muttered under his breath. In a matter of seconds, she’d covered half of the distance between us. All three of us started backing up, and then we started running. All of a sudden, “she” stood up straight, threw her cane down, and began to sprint. 

The thing charging at us was no grandma. It was a grown-ass man. He couldn’t have been shorter than 6’5, and he looked like 300 pounds of pure muscle. His “skin,” if you could call it that, looked like it was made of shadows; it was black and gooey like tar and had wisps of black and red smoke coming off of it. But the scariest part of this guy wasn’t his size, his speed, or his appearance. It was the fucking elephant trunk of a dick sticking out from beneath his fake granny dress. Despite the literal log between his legs, he caught up to us in a single second. He knocked us all to the ground one by one, and then he spoke. 

“MY NAME IS BIG DICK RANDY!” he yelled. “I WANT YOUR BOOTY AND YOUR CANDY!” He then scooped our candy buckets off the ground with his left hand and demanded that we stand up and turn away from him. Me, Alex, and Will were so scared that we complied. Big Dick Randy then let out what I can only describe as a moan before slapping our bootycheeks so hard it felt like our booties were ripped off our bones. We fell to the sidewalk in agony; another Randy booty slap like that, and we’d be completely cooked. But just then, the street was illuminated by a pair of LED headlights. Our Uber arrived just in time. “NOOOOOOOOOO!” Randy yelled. “NO MORE BOOTY FOR TONIGHT! BUT NEXT YEAR… HAHA… I’LL GET EVERYONE’S BOOTY AND CANDY! EVERYONE’S! HAHAHAHAHA!”

Then the giant monster-man sprinted down the street at full speed. Alex, Will and I silently got up from the sidewalk and watched as Big Dick Randy vanished into the night, cackling all the way. Without saying a word, we got into the Uber. Our driver saw Randy too, judging from how pale his face was when we entered his Chevy Tahoe. “So, uh… you still want a ride to the club, or…” he began. “Thanks man, but can you just drop us off at BDSU’s front gates?” I replied. “Of course, of course” he quickly responded, “I think I’m gonna need the night off too after seeing that… thing.” 

When we were safely back on Campus, we immediately went to the campus police to report what happened to us. Though they were concerned that someone was going around slapping booties, they assumed we’d just been pranked by another student and freaked out. To be fair, we all smelled like booze, sounded loopy, and looked completely out of it. We were in no state to be trusted by police who’d seen plenty of confused students like us on Halloween. We then tried calling our parents. Alex’s parents accused him of being high, Will’s parents accused him of being drunk, and my parents accused me of being both. 

In the end, Alex, Will, and I decided to just go to bed and see if we wake up with additional, sober insight the next morning. Though we did wake up sober, we didn’t wake up with any revelations about what we saw (or any alternate explanations as to why our bootycheeks were sore). It’s been many months since that fateful night, but we still remember Big Dick Randy’s warning well: he’s coming back this Halloween, and he’s coming to slap everyone’s booty and eat everyone’s candy. However, Reddit and the NoSleep community alone won’t be enough to warn people about Randy’s dastardly plan as such, I’ve taken to Spotify as well to make a song about it. Look up my nam, Digbar, on Spotify and search for my song “BIG DICK RANDY.” Listening to it might be the only way to stay safe this Halloween. Your booty better be ready, because Big Dick Randy’s coming back, and he’s coming to slap your backsides…
