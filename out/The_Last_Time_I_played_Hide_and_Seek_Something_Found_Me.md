When I was eleven, my parents started leaving me at home to watch my little brother, George whenever they were out. During the school year, this was on occasional Saturday nights when they had a date or some event to attend. In the summer, it was from about 7:00 AM until 5:00 PM Monday-Friday. 



As a kid, all I wanted to do was play video games or read books, but George was six years younger than me and at that age where he was equally curious, smart, and ignorant to the fact that his actions had consequences. If I let him run free for even a few minutes, I’d find him eating ice cream straight out of the carton or trying to color on the TV screen. And when he did one of these things and either got sick or ruined the TV, guess who got grounded? Not him.



So George required pretty much constant attention, meaning it was hard for me to find time to do the things I enjoyed. It was about halfway through the summer of 2017 when I found some relief to the curse of my little brother: Hide and Seek.



I’d suggested the game one day when George was complaining nonstop about how bored he was. For the rest of the summer, it became my go to game whenever I needed George to shut up. Sometimes I even had fun. Most of the time, it gave me a few minutes away from him in a day filled with constant annoyances.



It was during the very last week of summer vacation that something happened that made me swear I would never play Hide and Seek again.



It was George’s turn to hide and I could hear him giggling in our shared bedroom upstairs. I didn’t need the sound–I already knew all of his hiding places. He’d already used the one where he hid behind my mom’s clothes in the back of her closet, the one where he climbed under the sink in the bathroom, and the one where he squeezed into the space behind the couch. I knew that he was going to be under the covers in the top bunk, but I didn’t feel like finding him yet.



I thought about sitting down on the couch and reading for a few minutes before going to tag him. I’d been hooked on the latest book of the Percy Jackson series, and Annabeth had just gotten kidnapped. I really wanted to see if Percy could rescue her, but I knew that if George raced for the base (the dining room table adjacent to the living room), he’d see me and start throwing a fit over the fact that I wasn’t trying hard enough.



So I settled for walking around upstairs calling, “I’m gonna find you!” which resulted in muffled giggles as he kicked around the sheets and buried his head into the pillow. I remember being so annoyed about how dumb he was. 



I was biding my time sitting on my parents’ bed when I heard a loud *knock knock knock* on the wall separating the two rooms. My eyes immediately turned to the door where I could clearly see the stairs. I hated to let George win, but I wasn’t worried. I knew that if I saw him cross the threshold toward the stairs that I was fast enough to chase him down and tag him before he got to base.



I was watching the stairs for about fifteen seconds when I heard George’s voice call, “Safeeeee!”



“What?” I shouted as I jogged down the stairs. “How?”



I got to the dining room table to see George dancing in place as he held one hand against the table. “I beat you! I beat you!”



“You were *just* in our room,” I said. “How’d you get here?”



“Nuh-uh,” he replied between shrieks of laughter, his bare feet slapping against the floor. “I was in the pantry!”



“You weren’t in our room at all? I *swear* I heard you up there. Did you really hide in the pantry?”



“I was in the pantry,” George said smiling. “I knew you wouldn’t check there.”



“But I know that I heard you…”



“I’m too tricky! My turn to hide again! Start counting to 30 Mississippi, and no peeking!”



I decided to just believe him. It seemed the house was always making some kind of weird noise, and it wasn’t like he teleported downstairs. I was *definitely* going to catch him in the next round.



When I was finished counting, I checked every room downstairs, then worked my way upstairs calling “Here I come!” and “I’m gonna get you!” until I heard George giggle in our room. This time I *knew* he was in there. 



As I walked into the room, I heard kicking in the sheets on the top bunk. I think I even saw them move a little. “Really,” I said. “So predictable.”



I had one foot on the ladder when George darted out of the closet and out of our bedroom door. I chased him on instinct, and tagged him just as he was reaching the stairs. It wasn’t until then that I realized what had just happened.



While George was pouting about how it was “no fair” that I’d caught him, I walked back into the room.



“Is someone there?” I called. 



Nothing.



“I have a gun,” I said. “And I’ll shoot if you don’t come out right now!”



When whatever was under the sheets didn’t listen, I walked up and stood on the edge of the bottom bunk so that I could grip both the blanket and sheets without climbing the ladder and getting too close. I ripped everything off the bed as I jumped backwards and screamed.



But nothing was there.



I thought about calling my dad and telling him that something was in the house. But how many times had I woken him up in the middle of the night, sure that there was a monster under my bed, only to get yelled at when he checked to find nothing there? Surely I was being ridiculous. Everyone knows that monsters only come out at night.



We played for a while longer, and the more I got bored with the game the more George seemed to love it. His laughs only got louder and his dances only got more ecstatic each time he managed to tag me.



It seemed that, if it were up to George, we might play hide and seek for the rest of our lives, growing old as we counted Missisipis that were never long enough. I tried in vain several times to get him to do something else: watch TV or draw pictures, anything that would allow me some peace and quiet. 



Eventually, I had a great idea: a hiding spot where George would never find me. A place where I could read my book uninterrupted all while keeping him entertained.



“Okay,” I said to George when it was my turn to hide. “Count to 30 Mississippi. I have a *really* special hiding spot. You’ll never find me once I get there.”



“You can’t go outside!” George said adamantly. “And you can’t lock doors or go in the bathroom.”



“I won’t,” I promised. “Now go count.”



When he was counting, I raced to my bed and grabbed my book, then ran out into the hallway under the attic. I reached up and took the string with both hands, then, as quietly as I could, I pulled it down until the door was opening and the stairs were coming down. By the time I was halfway up the stairs, George was counting, “25!” and  by the time I gently shut the attic door behind me, he was calling, “ready or not, here I come!”



I tried my best to hold in laughter as George stomped around the house, opening doors and pulling open curtains. I knew that he was never going to find me. What kind of  kid would go up to the attic? It was a place where even adults only ventured once or twice a year, and only when absolutely necessary. It was a place for darkness and monsters–even if George thought I was in the attic, he would never try to come up.



With a proud smile on my face, I opened my book and continued reading. I knew I’d have to come down eventually when George started crying or whatever, but in that moment I was in pure bliss. I had found my sanctuary.



Over the next ten minutes or so, occasionally George would scream “Under the bed!” or “I’m coming!”



I was just finishing another chapter of my book when there was a loud *thump thump thump* against the attic door, like someone was hitting it with a blunt object.



My heart started beating so hard that I pressed both of my hands to my chest, as if I could hold it in place. I scooted backwards on my butt until I was pressed up against a stack of boxes, still less than an arm's length (if it was a long arm) away from the attic door.



There was no possible way that it could have been George. There was no way he could have figured that I was in the attic. Even if he did, he wasn’t near tall enough to knock on the door. He’d most certainly have to jump just to reach the rope. Maybe if he was standing on a chair while holding a broom? But no, that was ridiculous. *Something else* was knocking on the attic door.



“I found you!” It was George’s voice, unmistakable. 



“What?” I called. “No way!”



“In the closet!” It was George’s voice again, this time from much further away.



I put a hand over my mouth while one stayed on my chest, desperate to contain every decibel of noise. Maybe whatever it was would just leave.



“I found you! Time to come out,” this time the voice was deeper. Still George’s, but it was like he was trying to imitate the pitch of a grown man.



I turned to my side as best as I could in the small space, then used all my strength to push the boxes forward so that they were on top of the door. If someone were to open it, the boxes would come crashing down and crush them. I laid on my back and closed my eyes. All I had to do was wait for Mom and Dad to get home and everything would be okay.



Then, I heard a voice that shocked me to my core. A voice that shocked me because it never should have been possible.



It was my voice, laughing and calling, “Safeeee! George, you can come back now. I beat you!”



I should’ve screamed. I should’ve done something–anything, to let George know that I had not beat him and that he could not come back. I should’ve screamed as loud as I could for George to lock himself in the bathroom and not come out no matter what he heard–not until Mom and Dad got home. But I didn’t. I only sat and listened, too worried about myself to think about the little kid, barely five years old–my brother, who I was supposed to be protecting.



I only worried about myself as George shouted, “Dangit! How’d you find me?”



What I didn’t think about when I put the boxes over the attic door was how hard they’d make it to get out of the attic quickly. When George let out a sharp cry of pain I started frantically pushing the boxes away, my love and worry for him finally bringing me back to what was important.



It must’ve taken me thirty seconds to move the boxes, all the while George was shouting “Stop it!” and “Help!” There was the clattering of dining room chairs falling to the floor, and finally a growl, loud and animalistic. Then George was screaming the most piercing sound I’d ever heard. 



By the time I got out of the attic, down the stairs, and into the dining room, they were gone–George and whatever took him. I ran to the back door to see that it was open. In the distance something was moving in the woods. I couldn’t make it out between the branches and leaves, but it was making no effort to conceal itself. I ran halfway out to the woods before I heard a mix of low growls and something like the tearing of leather. 



I didn’t go to check it out. I turned around and walked back inside, then called my parents. George was gone. Something took him. A monster.



Neither my parents nor the police believed me. They said someone broke in. A person, not a monster, ran off with George. Our whole community came together to search for him, but I knew that he’d never be found.



After a while I came to believe the police’s story. It was just a man that could play tricks. He probably would’ve taken me too if I hadn’t been in the attic.



I believed that for a long time. Until now, seven years later.



My parents are gone. I’m home alone and it’s nearing midnight. My door is locked, but outside I can hear the voice of a little boy calling my name.



 “Come out,” he’s saying. [“I found you."](http://reddit.com/r/connorshauntedhouse)
