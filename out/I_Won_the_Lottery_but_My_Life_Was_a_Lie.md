It all started with a man in a suit.

I was at a gas station, counting the crumpled bills in my wallet, when a man tapped me on the shoulder. He looked completely out of place—clean-cut, polished, and far too refined for the dingy convenience store.

“Take this,” he said, holding out a lottery ticket.

I frowned. “Why? What’s the catch?”

“No catch,” he replied, smiling in a way that felt too perfect, too calculated. “Think of it as a gift.”

I hesitated for a moment but eventually took the ticket. “Thanks,” I said, though the word felt strange in my mouth.

He nodded, almost approvingly, and walked out the door without another word.

The next day, I checked the numbers. My hands shook as they lit up, one by one. It wasn’t a small win. It was the jackpot—$20 million.

My life changed overnight.

I quit my job, moved into a beautiful house in the suburbs, and started living a life I’d only dreamed of. For the first time, everything felt like it was falling into place.

But the cracks started to show almost immediately.

At the bank, the teller greeted me by name before I even introduced myself. The salesman at the car dealership seemed to know exactly what I wanted, down to the color of the interior. Even my barista at the local coffee shop slid me a free drink with a knowing smile.

“Lucky guy,” she said. “Things always go your way, don’t they?”

At first, it felt nice. Who wouldn’t enjoy a little extra luck? But the more it happened, the more uneasy I became.

One morning, I realized that every traffic light turned green as I approached. Not just once, but every single time I drove anywhere.

Then, there were the people. Conversations felt rehearsed, like everyone knew exactly what I was going to say. Once, I overheard two men in the park talking about me.

“Did you see his new car?” one of them asked.

“Yeah,” the other replied. “It’s perfect for his character arc.”

I stopped in my tracks. Who talks like that?

Emily came into my life not long after.

We met at the grocery store, where our carts collided. She was gorgeous, charming, and everything I’d ever dreamed of in a partner. By the end of the week, we were practically inseparable.

It was all too perfect. Too easy.

One night, as we sat on the couch watching TV, she turned to me and said, “I can’t wait to see how it ends.”

I froze. “What ends?”

Her eyes widened for a moment before she laughed nervously. “Oh, nothing. I was talking about the show.”

I wanted to believe her, but something about her answer stuck with me.

It got worse after that.

One day, I was running errands when I noticed a black van following me. No matter where I went, it stayed close behind. I tried losing it by taking random turns, but it didn’t work.

Panicked, I turned onto a back road and ended up in front of a massive warehouse. The black van pulled into the lot and disappeared inside.

Something about the place felt wrong. Against my better judgment, I parked my car a block away and crept toward the building. Through a grimy window, I saw rows of monitors, each one showing live feeds of places I recognized: my house, my car, the park, even my bedroom.

Pinned to a corkboard in the center of the room was a stack of papers labeled “PROJECT WINNER.” Beneath it were detailed scripts describing events from my life—winning the lottery, meeting Emily, even smaller moments like ordering coffee.

At the bottom, in bold red letters, were the words: “SEASON FINALE IN TWO WEEKS.”

I confronted Emily when I got home.

“What the hell is this?” I demanded, slamming the script onto the table.

She stared at the papers, her face pale. “You weren’t supposed to find that,” she said quietly.

“Is any of this real? Are you real?”

She didn’t answer. Instead, she grabbed her phone and walked into the other room. That night, she packed her things and left without saying a word.

The next morning, I found a new script on my bedside table.

It was titled: “Sam’s Final Scene.”

My stomach turned as I flipped through it. It described everything that had happened to me in perfect detail—the man at the gas station, the lottery win, the warehouse. But it didn’t stop there. It outlined my next steps: run outside, confront the black van, and be taken away.

Before I could process what I was reading, I heard the rumble of an engine outside.

The van was waiting for me.

I stepped outside, script in hand, and walked toward the van. The back doors opened, revealing a brightly lit interior filled with monitors and cameras.

On every screen was me—eating breakfast, walking my dog, staring blankly out the window. My entire life, playing out like episodes of a show.

At the far end of the van, a man in a director’s chair turned to face me.

He smiled. “Welcome, Sam. You’ve done well. The audience loves you.”

I stumbled back. “Audience? What audience?”

He gestured toward a monitor, and the screen changed to show a massive auditorium filled with people. They were cheering, clapping, some even crying as scenes from my life played out on the big screen.

“You’ve been part of something special,” he said. “The Project Winner series has been our most successful show to date. But all good things must come to an end.”

I shook my head, the truth crashing down around me. “My life—it’s not real? None of it?”

The director shrugged. “Does it matter? The audience believed it. That’s what counts.”

I tried to run, but the van doors slammed shut behind me. The lights flared, and everything faded to black.

When I woke up, I was sitting in my living room. Everything looked normal—my furniture, my pictures, even the coffee cup on the table.

But I knew it wasn’t real.

The cameras were still there, hidden in the corners, their lenses trained on me. My life is a script, and I’m still playing my role. Somewhere out there, they’re watching, waiting for me to entertain them.

I don’t know how this ends. But I know one thing: it’s not my story anymore.
