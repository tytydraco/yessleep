Coming back home has always been something I had looked forward to ever since I’d moved overseas for work. Seeing my family, catching up with close friends and hearing how everyone was getting along in life was always a joy, akin to living a missed life here vicariously through that of others.


However this visit felt different. It had been a while since I or anyone it seemed, last heard from Ben. We were childhood friends growing up in the same neighbourhood before my parents moved in my late teens. We had always kept in contact but on a lesser frequency since I moved overseas for work. 


To be frank and he wouldn’t mind me saying this anyway, Ben was someone who wasn’t too particularly bright and at times, a tad too overzealous when it came to money-making opportunities. 


I had known Ben since young and while he was not a bad person, he never seemed to have any qualms about breaking the law for money. He had brushes with the law while we were teens with his smuggling and selling of contraband cigarettes before moving on to illegal gambling businesses. You may say I’m biased as it gets but I know that he always had big dreams of retiring his mother, having seen her juggle 2 jobs ever since his dad passed away while he was barely 1. Yet somehow, it never quite dawned on him that his mother’s greatest wish as she got on in years was for him to live a quiet and crime-free life.


I was happy for him when he mentioned he had opened a pub with a couple of other partners. No funny business and everything was above board, he promised me as my skeptical self joked about not wanting to see his pub in the news for being the target of a drug bust.
 

However before I flew back, I heard from our mutual friends that Ben had been uncontactable for some time. The pub was now shuttered with everyone wondering if this was another repeated case of running from the loan sharks. I tried calling him number of times when I had arrived but each time his phone was turned off.


I was in 2 minds about dropping by his mother’s place. After all, she was in poor health and the last thing she probably needed was to find out that her son was in trouble once again. However as much as it was not unheard of for Ben to disappear like this, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that something was amiss this time. Business was supposedly good and everything pointed to a fresh start for him. He mentioned that his past loans were paid up and he was now looking for a bigger apartment.


Heading to her block felt like a trip back to the past. Nothing much had changed and it almost felt like it was just yesterday when Ben and I hung out at the void deck, playing ball games till the sun set and his mum called out to him to get back for dinner. 


To be honest, I was almost half expecting to see Ben in the living room as his mother opened the door. While he had his own place, this was somewhere he would hide when he could not repay his loans or had people coming after him. 


“Oh it’s you.” 


“Hello Auntie! Wah, you’re going to make me stand outside here?”


She sighed with her reluctance to invite me in both surprising and odd. After all, she and Ben were practically family to me.


“Ben’s not here.”


I couldn’t quite put her finger to it but it was apparent that she wasn’t the same. Ben had always been a source of worry for her especially as she got older, but she never had this tone of resignation when it came to him, until today.


“Oh when did you last see him?” 


“Couple of days ago. Ben had actually moved back recently but he was rarely at home.”


I could see her eyes darting around as she hesitated.


“I think you should go. I’ll tell Ben to call you if I see him.” 


I felt there was more than meets the eye, especially with the urgency she started nudging me towards the door. I shot a couple of quick looks around the house and I think she saw what I had caught on to.


“Auntie please. If he has any problems, let me know and I’ll do what I can.”


She shook her head as she hurried me towards the door.


“Those. Ben’s dabbling in that now?” 


I felt my heart sink as she bit her lip and gently nodded. This was not good. I’d recognize those signs from anywhere. The half open yakult bottles, little toy cars around the house.


Back then, we had a neighbour, Mr Lim who owned a successful hair salon chain business. I remember our parents warned us against interacting with him with rumours abound about the true terrifying source of his success. 


He was married with no children but everyone could attest to the sound of children playing from his apartment late at night and he would shrug off any questions about that. As time passed, he became more erratic and withdrawn with the quarrels with his wife becoming commonplace. 


I remember heading back up with Ben to his house after school one day only to see police officers cordoning off our neighbour’s apartment. Curious as we were, we couldn’t help but snuck under the tape to catch a peek of what lay inside. Bloodstains covered the floor and at the time, I never quite understood why there were numerous children's toys strewn all over the living room along with opened snack packets.


I also vividly remember both our parents yelling at us and forcefully dragging us back home. Mine insisted on bringing me to the nearby temple for prayers while Ben apparently was dragged to a tang-ki (a local shaman of sorts) for cleansing. 


Mr Lim had apparently killed his wife after a quarrel and had apparently went insane. It was an open neighbourhood secret that he had engaged or ‘reared’ child spirits (or kumantong as we called it locally) to aid his business. They were supposedly souls of aborted fetuses or those who died as children before gaining new life after unspeakable rituals. While it was not unheard of back in the day, dabbling in the occult was as taboo back then as it is today. Many spoke in hushed tones in the years after, of Mr Lim slowly losing control of his ‘children’ before that tragedy.


Ben and I never talked about what we saw again but I’d have thought he’d known better than to get into all these after what we had both seen. “Your karmic debt always comes due.” The temple priest reminded me after I was cleansed and warned me never to get into things I know little about. 


“I have no idea why he would ever do that.”


I sighed as she started sobbing.


“I thought things were getting better. He told me his new pub was making money.”


“Do you know when he started all these?”


She shook her head.


“He moved back all of a sudden with several large suitcases. I didn’t think much of it but things started going missing around the house. And I thought it was just me being old, but I heard the sounds of children in his room at night.”


“There always seemed to be shadows darting around the house after he moved back. I confronted him one day. I told him to get everything out or I’d get a priest here. He scolded me with words he’d never used on me before and he moved out the next day.”


As she broke down, I found myself almost as exasperated as her. Oh Ben, what the fuck did you get yourself into now? I never saw myself as someone religious but what I had seen that day had always given me a fear of the supernatural that never quite went away. I struggled to think about what to do next as I even wondered how I would go about explaining to any of his friends. 


It was late before I finally calmed Ben’s mother down as we reminisced about old times and I promised to seek help for Ben. I got back home and looked at the police guidelines for filing a missing person’s report, unsure of how I should even begin. 


“Hello, my friend’s been missing for days now. We’re worried because erm…hmmm.” Really? 


Just then, my phone rang. A call from Ben, no less.


“Hey dude, seriously where the fuck have you been?”


“That’s not very polite!”


I froze and almost dropped my phone as the child’s voice on the other end sent chills down my spine. I could hear the background sounds of children running and playing as if they were in a playground, only that it was in the middle of the night.


“Ben told me to tell you he is very busy now so you don’t have to find him alright? Hehe bye bye!”


I swear I could almost hear his voice break off into a sinister chuckle.
