*My first mistake was coming here at all.*

I saw my uncle’s cabin silhouetted in the setting sun as my old, beat-up Chevy rattled along the dusty dirt road toward the lake. It rolled up the graveled driveway and made its signature squeal as I hit the brakes and put it in park. As I stepped out the vehicle, I was chilled by a piercing October breeze. I still had hope that this weekend getaway would be a good use of my paid time off, but I admit, that hope was dwindling.

A scene from a movie: a young man takes his girlfriend up to the mountains, to a lakeside cabin—just when all the leaves have faded to lush tones of crimson, amber, and gold—and when the moment is just right, when the sun is real low and the water is all aglow at that magical hour of twilight, the boy gets on one knee and pops the question, diamond ring in-hand. That’s what I had in mind when I begged my uncle to let me stay a few days at his secluded “summer getaway” cabin he’d bought cheap the year prior. He was a grumpy old man, but he still had a heart.

It should’ve been perfect. It should’ve been one of the happiest weekends of both our lives—which is why I was so unbelievably baffled when she dumped me. Maybe the writing on the wall was too obvious. Maybe she didn’t want to marry me. Maybe there was someone else. Who knows? Who cares, really? Somehow I found myself single just a day before we were meant to head up to a remote spot in the mountains of Utah. And, for some reason, I found myself up there alone. I don’t know, it seemed like it’d be a nice place to brood, to feel sorry for myself. I didn’t much care to tell anyone about our breakup. As far as my family was concerned, I’d be coming down the mountain a few days later with my new fiancé. I didn’t know what I’d tell them. I hardly understood it myself. A weekend at Uncle Rob’s cabin would give me plenty of time to mull it all over, or so went my thinking.

I filled my lungs with fresh, crisp air. It felt good. I was lucky in getting to the spot before the sun set entirely. It had been a long drive, and all I wanted was to lay down in a soft bed. An old set of keys jingled and jangled as I twirled them around my index finger. I whistled a chipper tune on my way to the front door, trying to act happier than I was. The key turned, the door opened. The musky smell of wood filled my nostrils as I stepped inside.

It was dark. I turned on my phone’s flashlight in search of a light switch. “Aha!” I said upon my discovery of one. I flipped it, and nothing happened. I flipped it a few more times, as if it’d make a difference. I found another, and tried flipping it another two or three times as well. There was no power. I set down my backpack that housed all my effects. I half-considered getting back in my truck and driving away right then and there, but figured I should at least give my uncle a call first.

The phone rang, and it rang some more. “This is Rob Ward. Leave a message.”

I sighed. The phone rang again. Once. Twice. Three times. “Hal? Hal, honey, how’s it going?”

The question was an emotional gut-punch. *Not so good, Mom. You ever lose the love of your life without even knowing why?* I took a deep breath. “Hey, yeah, it’s going great. We’re up here at the cabin—just getting settled in. I just had a quick question for Rob, but he’s not picking up his phone.”

“Oh that’s great honey, I’m glad you made it up there safe. How’s Jessica? Is she in a good mood? Make sure she’s in a good mood before, well, you know… I’m not on speaker, am I?”

“What? No, she’s fine, I’m not…” *I’m not proposing to her at all, Mom. She’s not here. In fact, she doesn’t want anything to do with me. I’m all by myself in the middle of nowhere. What a great idea. I’m a genius, Mom.* “I’m waiting till tomorrow. I—I just had a question for Rob and wondered if you could try getting ahold of him.”

“Oh, that’s great sweetie. And yes—you’ve called at a good time. He’s over here, actually. He and Dad are watching the game right now, but I think it’s gone to commercials. I’ll bring him the phone.”

A moment passed. I heard the sound of a phone changing hands. “Yeah?” Rob’s gruff voice came over the speaker.

“Hey, Rob. Uh, who’s—who’s winning?”

For a few seconds there was nothing but the sound of TV in the background. “What do you need?” he said in his habitual growly monotone.

“So… there’s no power up here. Seems like. I tried turning on the lights.” Talking to Rob always made me uncomfortable. Could never tell what he’s thinking, and he made no effort in the realm of niceties.

“Generator. In the back.” And with that, he handed the phone back to my mother.

“It’s me again, Hal. Make sure when you do it you—”

“Yep, thanks, Mom. I have to go now, okay?”

“Okay, sweetie. I love you! Tell Jessica I said—”

“Love you too. I’ll tell her you said hi.” I hit the *end call* button hastily. I didn’t like lying to my mother. Nor did I want to talk any more about Jessica.

“Of course there’s a generator. Obviously,” I muttered to myself as I made my way out the back door. This place was way too far out to be hooked up to any grid. I was downright lucky there was cell service at all.

All that was left of the sun were the last mauve tones of dusk that silhouetted the pine trees on the horizon as clusters of black, needly branches. My phone’s flashlight illuminated the way down the back deck, casting long, stark shadows as the radius of light hit overgrown grass, large rocks, and the like; nearly rolling my ankle as I clambered over the uneven terrain. I looked up and saw a thick wire extending from the cabin to the inside of an old tool shed at the edge of the property. I made my way to it, but the door was locked. I fumbled through my pocket and found the keys Rob had given me. There were three in total. I tried the first. No dice. I didn’t try the second, it was way too big. The third unlocked the door, which swung open with a sickening creak. Inside the small wooden shed was the generator, along with all the tools one would need to maintain a place like this. All sorts of pliers, wrenches, drills, a box cutter, and a hefty axe.

The generator had a recoil starter like a lawn mower. I pulled it, but there was nothing except the short-lived whirring sound of an attempt at revving up. The tank of propane attached was probably empty. Thankfully, there were no less than three more of them next to it. Once the fresh tank was attached, it finally it started with a roar. The cabin flickered to life like a beacon in the pitch-dark forest. *We’re in business,* I thought.

As I exited the shed, the generator seemed to start making an odd sound—a feral screeching sort of noise, harsh against the ears, for sure. I’d never been mechanically savvy, but it looked to be running alright from what I could tell. The sound continued as I made my way back to the cabin. In fact, it got a bit louder. I looked out over the back deck. Was it coming from the generator? Or was it coming from the forest behind it?

I put away the thought. It creeped me out. I shut the door and locked it behind me. I locked the front door, too—just for good measure.

In the new light I saw that the cabin was in worse condition than I thought it would be. What little paint there was was peeling. The wood was practically rotting. Dirt and dust caked nearly every inch of the place. *What a letdown. Maybe it’s good I didn’t bring Jessica here.*

*Jessica.* The name made my heart hurt. I needed to get my mind off her.

The wind was howling, probably blowing through all sorts of holes in the cabin’s exterior. I had to wear my jacket at all times. I looked at my phone and saw it was only a little past 7 P.M. Too early to drown my sorrows in sleep. It was time to start thinking about the way in which I’d spend the rest of my evening. Internet wasn’t an option, of course, so I figured I’d try something new and *actually* read a book I’d been meaning to for years.

After a while the generator suddenly stopped making the horrible shrieking sound it had been. Or, at least, whatever had been making it stopped. *Glad that sorted itself out,* I thought.

A few chapters of *Pet Sematary* later and I needed to take a leak. The bathroom was just as dingy, cramped, and outdated as the rest of the house. After doing my duty, on my way back to the living area, I caught a glimpse of something in the window in the top of the back door. I didn’t want to think it, but my stomach sank. It looked like the top of someone’s shaved head. I froze. Was someone really there? If it was a person, they were standing perfectly still, facing the door; but I couldn’t be sure. They’d have to be intimidatingly tall for me to be able to see the tip of their head. I tried to steady my breathing. There was no need to panic. As I took a step toward the door, the shape darted to the right. I ran to the door. There was no easy locking mechanism on the inside, I had to use the key. After struggling to fit the correct key into the hole in my adrenaline-induced zeal, I flung open the old wooden door and looked in the direction it went. I saw nothing but dark shapes, all still in the quiet of night, except the steady silhouetted swaying of branches in the wind.

I called out. “Hello?” My voice was tentative. I wasn’t sure I wanted whatever it was to hear me. I took a deep breath. I called again, louder this time. “Hello?!” Nothing. No one. I turned on my phone’s flashlight. At the edge of my vision, I could see it. The door of the toolshed was wide open.

I muttered an expletive to myself. What if it was in there? Was it a person? It must’ve been—a bald man, tall, with pasty white skin.

I approached the shed. One step at a time. I could feel my heart pounding wildly inside my chest. I spoke again; a whisper this time. “Is someone in there?” Surely not. Surely there wasn’t a stranger inside the shed. What would they be doing there? What reason could they have?

Flashlight in-hand, I peered inside the shed. Nothing. For a moment, relief spread over me. I even felt myself smile. I poked my head inside, and looked to the left, where the generator was. It was there, too. It towered over me. Naked and pale. It just stood there, with its… “face” pointed in my direction.

I ran.

If I hadn’t just pissed, I’d have done it then. I wasn’t looking where I was going. I tripped over a rock and hit the ground hard. I yelled in frustration. I didn’t feel a thing. My only concern was getting inside the cabin. But my back was turned. My back was turned and that thing was somewhere behind me. The thing without a face. No eyes, no mouth. I scrambled to my feet and didn’t look back.

Into the light. I made it, I was inside. But I wasn’t going to stick around.

Where were my car keys? On the couch. I took them into my hand and threw on my backpack. I was out the front door in thirty seconds. Getting myself to take another step into the dark was like pulling teeth, but I managed. I sprinted to the car. My hands were shaking so much I dropped the keys. It was right behind me, I could feel it. Or, at least, I imagined it. I didn’t dare look to find out. “Come on!” I screamed as I picked the keys up off the ground. I unlocked the door. I jumped inside. I turned the key. The engine stalled. “No! No, no, no!” Expletives flew out my mouth at a pace they never before had. I tried again, and gave it some gas. My old Chevy roared to life.

When the headlights came on, I was sure I’d see him standing there, but whatever it was was nowhere to be seen. It was only a small comfort. I put her in reverse, and was soon on my way down that lonely dirt road. I hoped, downright prayed, that I was heading in the right direction, but I couldn’t think. All that occupied my mind was what I saw in that shed.

It was then I saw something that should’ve scared me more than the man without a face. A single snowflake hit my windshield.

The snow fell heavier and heavier by the second. The windshield wipers were on full-blast. The radio turned to static. I didn’t understand how the weather could’ve changed so drastically so quickly, and so early in the year. I felt like God was punishing me. *Why now?*

A couple miles down the dirt path, I merged onto a narrow asphalt road. This was where I had come from. I was going the right way. All was pitch dark except for my car’s headlights. I couldn’t see more than fifteen feet in front of me. The snow was starting to stick on the ground, but I didn’t slow down. I had to get away from there.

It was a mistake. It was all such a mistake.

The road made a sharp turn left down the mountain. I very nearly went off the side of a cliff. My heart was pounding, my head ached. I went to wipe the sweat from off my brow. I didn’t see the creature that leapt in front of my car.

The impact was hard. I hit the brakes and spun the wheel more than I should’ve as the thing flew over my cracked windshield. A second impact. I had rammed my poor old Chevy right into a tree.

It was all a blur, I must’ve hit my head on the wheel. I was lucky I didn’t go flying out the windshield. The car was totaled, and my leg hurt. I opened the car door and fell onto the snowy ground. I couldn’t see a thing. I could feel myself losing consciousness. I just wanted to go to sleep, and so I did.

It was some time before I awoke with a start. I was freezing cold, and covered in a thick blanket of snow, which was still falling just as hard. The white-white snow at least reflected what little moonlight pierced the veil of clouds above, making it possible to see the landscape around me. The deer that I had hit laid dormant nearby, as stiff as could be.

How long had I been out? I tried sitting up. My leg. It was *so* painful. I brought out my phone and turned on the flashlight. The snow was red with blood from a deep gash in my left shin. It made me nauseous to look at. It was 11 P.M., and I had 13 missed calls from my mother. I could guess why; the storm had blanketed everything in six inches of snow.

I tried calling her back. No service. I tried calling 911. Not a chance.

*Am I going to die out here?* I didn’t want to die. I really, really didn’t want to die. *Then get up, Hal.* I heard my uncle Rob’s voice in my head, of all people. I thought of my mom and dad. I thought of Jessica.

I forced myself to my feet. I took a step forward. Searing pain shot through my leg. I was shivering in the cold. I didn’t know what I was going to do, except that I was going to survive. Somehow.

I can hardly remember what happened next, but I can guess. Hours of uphill shuffling in the dark, gritting my teeth through the pain. It didn’t make sense how I ended up back at that cabin, but that’s exactly what happened.

The sun was close to rising, I could see the world brighten a bit; but the clouds overhead were still loath to let the sunlight through. The cabin’s bright lights led me to it, like a lighthouse on the shore. It was the only thing for miles around, and my only hope of survival.

The place looked so different in the fog, buried in snow. Gone was the beauty of autumn, replaced with the biting dreariness of a cold, lonely winter. And somewhere in the woods, whether near or far, was the man whose face was skinned over.

The front door was wide open.

I went inside. It wasn’t much warmer, but at least I was sheltered from the heavy snowfall. I checked my phone again. Still no service. I wondered how long it would be before rescue arrived, or if it would arrive at all. With no car, no cell service, a dwindling phone battery, and a gaping wound… things looked grim. My best hope was to wait for the storm to clear enough that I could get a call through.

My leg was still bleeding. The cold, I imagine, numbed the pain; but that was hardly a good thing. I limped to the bedroom and tore the sheets off the bed into several thin strips, which I used to tightly bandage the gash after cleaning it with tap water. It was all I could do. I bundled myself into the remaining blankets and drifted to sleep. I was absolutely exhausted.

I have no idea how long it was before a sudden clattering woke me up. I didn’t have to wonder what had caused it. I knew it was that thing again. A lump formed in my throat. I felt so safe and warm in those blankets, and I could hardly move my legs without burning pain scorching my nervous system. But I was in mortal danger. I heaved myself up on my aching feet and peeked out the door of the bedroom. All was still.

The cabin was small, consisting of a living area, a tiny kitchen, a bathroom, and a bedroom. I could see nearly the whole house from my position in the doorway.

Another crash. This time, I heard where it had come from—beneath me. *How could it be beneath me?*

I was absolutely defenseless. *The tool shed.* I remembered the axe resting against the wall. I limped as fast as I could out the back door. The snow reached halfway up my calves. I paused at the doorway. I remembered seeing the creature in that shed. I had caught only a flash in the stark light from my phone, but the image was burned into memory. A tall, hairless man wearing nothing at all, pasty white except blue veins. Smooth skin where his face should’ve been. I didn’t want to look. I looked anyway. It wasn’t there. I let out a sigh of relief, but the anxiety returned tenfold. *It isn’t in the shed. It’s under the house.*

I grabbed the axe. As I turned around, I realized where the sound had come from. Next to the cabin was an open hatch leading to a basement that I hadn’t noticed before. *He’s in there.*

I gathered my courage. I’d finish this, once and for all. *I’m coming for you, you bastard.*

Adrenaline pumped through my veins. I hardly felt the wound in my leg as I limped down those steep concrete stairs. The air was rank, and all was dark. “Come out!” I shouted. “Come out, you freak!”  
I couldn’t see a thing except the dark silhouettes of various effects. Boxes, shelves, and the like. Various objects were scattered along the ground, surely the source of the crashing noises I heard.

“I know you’re in here,” I said.

For all my macho energy in that moment, I still fell backwards in horror when I saw him stand from his hunched position in the corner. I dropped the axe, I couldn’t breathe. It was just a shadow, a thin, ghostly image staring at me from the other side of the room.

Imagine my surprise when he raised his hands in surrender.

“W-What?” I stuttered.

He maintained the pose.

“Don’t come any closer,” I said. I meant for it to sound threatening, but only the sounds of desperate fear escaped my mouth. “Tell me what you are!” I grabbed the axe again and used it to push myself up off the ground.

He remained silent and motionless.

I scanned the room for a light source of some kind. There was a pull-chain in the center of the room. “Don’t move!” I said as I shuffled my way there. “I mean it!” I pulled the chain, and a single bulb lit up the cellar.

Standing before me in the dim light was a thin man, probably 6’5. He was totally naked, but he had no sexual organs. Everything was smooth, like a ken doll. I could hear strained, muffled breathing coming from where his mouth should’ve been. His raised arms conveyed a message: “I mean you no harm.”

“Do you… do you need help?” I asked.

He nodded his head.

The man was sat on the old sofa. I sat across from him on a chair. Just looking him over, again and again. I didn’t understand how any of this was possible. I had a boxcutter in my hand.

“I’m going to cut open the skin covering your mouth so you can breathe,” I said.

He tensed up, but nodded again.

I moved closer to him and raised the blade. *This is disgusting,* I thought. I plunged the shallow blade into his face. Blood spurt out onto my own. The man clenched his fists. Clearly, it hurt. Breath passed through the hole I made. I cut more, until a somewhat mouth-shaped hole adorned him, caked in blood. He heaved in a great breath and tried coughing, but something was still wrong. I looked into his mouth. There was no tongue, no teeth, no red or pink flesh. It was all that same smooth, clammy skin, extending all the way down his esophagus. “My God,” I whispered.

The man shook, probably in pain. He raised a trembling finger to his face, gesturing to the spot where his eyes should be. That’s where I cut next. A single, wild eye emerged from the bloody gash I inflicted on his flesh. It was bloodshot and full of fear.

I moved on to the next, put the triangular blade of the boxcutter into the bleeding skin, and carved a slit into his smooth face. But I cut too deeply, the blade scraped across his eye. Blood sprayed out of the wound like a fountain. He jerked back in pain, and held his hand to his now blind left eye. He knocked the boxcutter out of my hand, it clattered to the floor.

“I’m sorry!” I shot out.

The man emitted a choked, gagged, muffled noise that must have been cries of pain. He hunched himself into a ball on the couch and trembled.

What was going on? What in the world had happened to this man? My head throbbed, as did my leg. Cold sweat dripped down my face. This was a nightmare.

I didn’t know how much worse things could be.

I heard a sound coming from outside the cabin. It was like a moan; deep and long, almost like a whale’s call.

The man’s head perked up. His good eye stared out the front window. He looked to me.

“What is that?” Dread filled my soul’s every pore.

The sound came again.

The man leapt to his feet and dashed out the back door into the forest, into the fog and the snow.

I stood and limped to the window. I saw something emerge from the lake. It saw me, too. A great amorphous shape obscured in the fog. It moaned as it moved towards the cabin.

I hunched down and desperately gasped. I had been holding my breath. *What do I do? What do I do?*

The window darkened. I looked up. Pressed against the glass was a wall of skin. My mouth opened in horror. The glass cracked.

I scrambled out the back door, the same way the man had gone. *The axe!* I thought—like an axe would make a difference.

The window broke, and that awful moan came again; but I didn’t look back. I rushed down the stairs of the deck and into the cellar. I held the axe in my hands, but I didn’t feel any safer.

The creature was right behind me. Down the steep stairs, the pulsating blob moved with the sound of wet meat slapping against stone. It was made entirely of saggy, fatty skin. What resembled human limbs were bent out at odd angles all over its body. It was so large it scraped the ceiling. On its head—I thought it looked like a head of sorts—was no face. It was a long tube of wrinkly skin, like an elephant’s trunk, wide enough to swallow a man whole.

In a final act of desperate defiance, I swung the axe into its side. When I tried pulling it out, I quickly realized it was stuck. Skin moved from the creature to the axe, swallowing it into itself.

The thing’s proboscis swung towards me and caught me in the face. It clasped over my head. The air was sucked out around me. I couldn’t breathe. The tube of pulsating skin wrapped all around my body and began swallowing me into the greater mass of the monster. I felt flabby, cold skin surround me, caress me, become a part of me. I opened my mouth to scream, and the skin coated the inside of me. Inside my mouth, inside my throat, my lungs, my stomach, all lined with new skin. It all tightened around me, melded with my own nervous system and blood vessels. It was my skin now as much as it was the creature’s.

I understand now what the sound I heard the night prior was, the sound I thought I heard from the forest behind my uncle Rob’s cabin. It was screaming, shrieking, soul-piercing cries. I understand because those are the sounds I found myself making as the thing made me a part of itself before returning again to the bottom of that lake. I screamed and screamed till my vocal cords gave out. I wished that someone would hear me, I wished that someone would help. But no help would come until the snow on that mountain was cleared.

Until then, I was left to myself. Blind, starving, hardly able to breathe. Skinned over.
