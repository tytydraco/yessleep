My name is Emma. Not Charlotte. Not Sean, and obviously not a celebrity like Emma Watson. Emma—the name is awkwardly sandwiched between two siblings, whose names blend together like a complete unit, while mine stands alone, like something added later and crammed in. Even as a child, I understood what this meant. Charlotte and Sean. C and S. And I was the interlude, the spoiler, the odd one out.



Of course, my mother never said it outright. She didn't need to. It was all evident in how she smoothed Charlotte's hair with one hand and adjusted Sean's collar with the other, her attention perfectly focused on them, while I stood outside that invisible circle. It was also evident in the Christmas photos, where Charlotte and Sean wore matching deep burgundy and forest green outfits, while I wore bright yellow—the one Charlotte insisted on buying last year, vibrant, cheerful, yet utterly out of place.



I understood early on that the easiest way was to compromise. Charlotte wanted my new dress for Christmas—the blue lace-collar dress I'd been longing for for a year—and I gave it to her without hesitation. As compensation, Dad bought me a toy train; I was twelve then. After all, she was older than me, and she deserved nice things.



 Sean was only five, but he wanted my dollhouse, not to play with it like a traditional toy, but to take it apart and examine it like a little architect. I didn't object either. What good would objecting do? Mom would definitely suggest I share. Dad would look up from his newspaper, mutter "Don't be selfish," and then continue reading.



So, I became the giver, the accommodator, the one who never said "no."



It's not that I was weak or incompetent. Perhaps it was, but I'd been justifying myself for so many years that I couldn't see the truth. I told myself that what I was doing was kind, generous, and easier. Avoiding conflict is a kind of wisdom. But deep down, in the places where we hide those truths we don't want to face, I knew: I was afraid of what would happen if I refused.



This pattern continued into adolescence and adulthood. I studied college majors approved by my parents: accounting, practical, career-oriented. I dated people who seemed to fit their standards. I molded myself into the perfect image. When Matt proposed, I said yes because saying no was impossible for me.



Matt was handsome, conforming to conventional beauty standards. He was tall, broad-shouldered, with dark hair, and deep-set eyes that seemed to hold an unfathomable depth. He worked in finance, wore expensive suits, and spoke with unwavering confidence, as if he had never questioned whether he deserved his place in the world. He possessed everything I lacked.



"You're perfect," he told me at our engagement, but his tone sounded more like an assessment than a compliment. "Well-educated, but not aggressive. Beautiful, but not vain. You'll be a good wife."



I should have heard a warning in those words. I should have realized that he wasn't seeing me, Emma, ​​but rather the concept of Emma, ​​the undefined role of Emma. But I was twenty-six, weary of my mother's scathing comments about Charlotte's happy marriage and two beautiful children, and Matt seemed to be the answer to a question I didn't want to address.



We got married in the fall, and the wedding was less of a celebration and more of a performance. Charlotte was my bridesmaid, and her carefully chosen dress was radiant; somehow, she overshadowed me. Sean's toast was incredibly awkward, but everyone pretended to be charming. Matt's family crowded the other side of the church: his mother just stared at me, his father was present but distracted, and his three brothers looked at me with what, in hindsight, a mocking tolerance, as if I were some particularly amusing "prey."



My first miscarriage occurred four months after the wedding. That night, I was awakened by spasms and bleeding, and by morning, the budding life had vanished. Matt drove me to the hospital, his teeth clenched, saying nothing. In the stark white hospital room, the doctor confirmed what I already knew. Matt stood by the window, his back to me.



“We’ll try again,” he said flatly, as if discussing a failed business deal.



We did try again. The second pregnancy lasted a longer twelve weeks, enough for me to start dreaming about the future, enough for me to whisper the baby’s name in the dark. I wanted to call her Pearl; Matt said Brooklyn, because it was during our business trip to New York, which he said happened on our anniversary vacation. Then, that child too slipped away, taking not only that hope but all the possibilities of the future with her. The doctors used terms like “complications,” “tissue damage,” and “unlikely to be a full-term pregnancy,” but their meaning was simple: I wouldn’t be a mother.



His occasional, manageable outbursts of anger now cast a persistent shadow over our home. He didn’t hit me, at least not initially, but his words were like precise weapons. I was a defective product. Broken. A waste of his feelings. He often reminded me that any other man would have left me long ago, but he stayed and slept with me once a month. Didn't I understand how lucky I was? Shouldn't I be grateful?



Because I had never learned to say "no," I agreed with him. Yes, I was lucky. Yes, I should be grateful. Yes, I would work harder to be the wife he deserved.



At his insistence, we moved to the countryside, to a large house at the end of a winding road, surrounded by dense woods that seemed to be closing in on me every day. It was secluded and quiet. In a place like this, even if I screamed, no one would hear me, although Matt was careful not to leave any trace in plain sight.



I found a remote accounting job, working in a small office upstairs, while Matt commuted to the city three days a week. On the days he came home, I walked on eggshells, carefully trying to gauge his emotions and preventing the increasingly frequent outbursts. If I failed—for example, if I overcooked dinner, forgot to pick up his dry cleaners, or simply did something that annoyed him—the consequences were always swift and certain.



A shove. A grab of my wrist, a slight twist. And another time, his hand gripped my neck, not forcefully, but tightly, a promise, a threat. And his voice was always so loud: “Emma, ​​if you leave me, I’ll find you. I’ll kill you. Do you understand?”



I said I understood. Because I was never good at refusing people’s requests.



It was a Tuesday in late October when Matt called. I was at my desk, reviewing a particularly tedious spreadsheet for a client, when my phone buzzed. His name appeared on the screen, and my stomach involuntarily tightened. For years, I’d never known whether his calls meant annoyance, anger, or rage; it had become a conditioned reflex.



“Emma.” His voice was strange. Not angry, not calm. There was an indescribable sharpness in it. “You have to come to the police station. Now.”



A series of possibilities flashed through my mind. Had something happened to him? Was he arrested? Was he injured? “What’s wrong? You—”



“They’ve found our daughter.” He interrupted me.



These words sounded nonsensical. I repeated them over and over in my mind, trying to put them in a meaningful order. Our daughter. We don’t have a daughter. We have no children. My deteriorating health, and Matt’s resentment because of it, was ample proof of that.



“Matt, I—”



“Come straight to the police station. The one on Mercer Street. Detective Holloway.”



Before I could respond, he hung up.



I sat there, phone still to my ear, silent for a long time. Then, I did what I always did: obey. I closed my laptop, grabbed my wallet, drove to the police station, my mind racing with impossible scenarios.



Maybe it was a mistake. Maybe someone else’s daughter had been found, and they’d mistakenly contacted Matt. Perhaps this was a meticulously designed test, another way for him to prove my incompetence. Perhaps I really had gone mad; years of suppressing my words and concealing my emotions had finally shattered the most fundamental things within me.



The police station was a low, brick building, seemingly built in the 1970s and never renovated. Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed overhead, and the air reeked of stale coffee and industrial cleaning agents. A bored officer at the front desk led me to a room at the end of the corridor.



Matt stood there, arms crossed, talking to a man I guessed was Detective Holloway. He was older, with gray hair and a weary face that bore the weariness of someone who had seen the ugliest aspects of humanity. A girl sat in a plastic chair against the wall.



She looked seven or eight. Black hair, pale skin, and large eyes that seemed somewhat disproportionate to her face. She wore a blue dress that looked expensive but was dirty, as if she had worn it for days. She looked directly at me, her eyes filled with such intense recognition that I held my breath.



“Mrs. Harrison,” Detective Holloway said, his voice professionally calm. “Thank you for coming. This morning, we found this young lady on Miller Road, about three miles from your house. She said her name is Lily Harrison, and you are her mother.”



The room tilted slightly. I gripped the edge of the table tightly to steady myself. “This can’t be. We don’t have a daughter.”



Matt’s hand suddenly landed on my shoulder, the pressure so sharp it hurt. “Emma’s been under a lot of stress lately,” he said calmly. “We’ve had two miscarriages; it’s been tough on her. Sometimes she gets confused.”



Before I could protest, his fingers dug deeper into my shoulder blade. It was a warning.



“Mommy,” the girl said. Her voice was clear and firm. “Don’t you remember me?”



I looked at her, really looked closely. There was no trace of familiarity on her face. I had never seen this child before. But her large, watery eyes stared directly at me, and I felt something deep inside me crumble. What if I was wrong? What if my memory was faulty? What if the trauma of the miscarriage had created some kind of rupture, leaving a blank in my memory?



“We need to get to the bottom of this,” Detective Holloway said. “This girl looks… she’s healthy, but she won’t tell us where she’s been or how she ended up here. She only asks about her parents, about the two of you.”



Matt’s voice was sweet and gentle. “We’ll take her home, of course. If she says she’s our daughter, then she must be. Right, Emma?”



His hand was still on my shoulder. What would happen if I said no, if I denied the child? What would Matt do to me in the dark, in that secluded house?



I looked at the girl, looked at Lily, and she smiled at me. It was a strange smile.



“Yes,” I heard myself say. “Of course. Let’s take her home.”



The drive home was silent. Lily sat in the back seat, her hands clasped on her knees, watching the trees rushing past the window with interest. Matt clenched his teeth, his knuckles white, gripping the steering wheel tightly. I sat frozen in the passenger seat, trying to recall everything that had just happened.



After the car pulled into the driveway, Matt finally spoke. “Don’t tell anyone about this. Understand?”



“I don’t understand—”



“You. Understand.?” Each word was like a knife, harsh and sharp.



“Understood,” I said.



After entering the house, Matt immediately went back to his office and closed the door. Lily and I, this difficult child, stood there in the hallway, at a loss.



“Would you like something to eat?” I finally asked.



She thought for a moment. “Okay, thank you.”



I led her to the kitchen and made her a sandwich. My hands mechanically repeated familiar movements, while my mind was a complete mess. She ate meticulously, her movements methodical, watching me the entire time. After finishing, she said, "I'm tired."



"Of course. You can sleep in the guest room. I'll get you some clean clothes."



I found an old T-shirt, perfect for her petite frame as pajamas. She changed in the bathroom and came out looking younger, more fragile. But her eyes, those eyes, were still beautiful.



"Goodnight, mama," she said, climbing into the guest room bed.



"Goodnight, Lily."



I closed the door, stood in the hallway, trembling. Then I went downstairs, poured myself a large glass of wine, and tried to think. But thinking became impossible. Every time I tried to understand what had happened, my thoughts drifted away, like trying to grasp water in my fist.



The next morning, I woke to find Lily standing by the bed, staring at me. Like some fledgling waiting to be fed, I sat bolt upright, gasping.



"I'm hungry," she said simply.



I made breakfast—pancakes with syrup—and she seemed to enjoy it. Matt went downstairs, poured coffee, and then went to work without a word. After his car drove away, I felt a sense of relief in my chest.



“So,” I said to Lily, sitting across from her at the kitchen table, “tell me about yourself.”



She tilted her head like a bird. “What do you want to know?”



“Everything. Where you’ve been. You…how you became like this.”



“I’ve been waiting,” she said. “Now I’m finally here. With you.”



“But I don’t remember…”



“That’s okay. You’ll remember eventually. Or you never will. It doesn’t matter.”



Her words puzzled me, but I found myself unable to press her further. It was as if something in my head refused to break through this wall.



Later that morning, Detective Hollo called. He said the child protective agency thought Lily needed a checkup. Just a routine checkup to make sure she was healthy. I agreed and took her to see a doctor, a kind old gentleman named Peter, who examined her carefully.



“Everything looks fine,” he said afterwards. “No signs of abuse or malnutrition. She’s a little thin, but nothing serious. I suggest she stay home for a few months, away from school for now. Let her adjust and regain her strength. Maintain a regular diet and rest.”



I nodded, accepting the arrangement, just as I accepted everything else. Everyone assumed we had a daughter who had been missing for who knows how many years—the police said three, then the child protection agency said five, and one teacher insisted she had seen her a year ago.



But back home, I realized I had absolutely no idea how to care for a child for two months. I rarely had any contact with children before. I always thought Charlotte’s children were only brought out for holiday photoshoots, otherwise cared for by nannies. My maternal instincts, if they existed, had vanished along with my fertility.



But Lily made things much easier for me. She was full of curiosity. She always followed me around the house, constantly asking questions. "What's this?" she'd ask, pointing to the antique clock in the hallway, or the one Matt insisted on buying  strange painting, or perhaps that basement door I never had the key to, asked me, "What is this?"



A few days later, I set up a makeshift classroom in the sunroom. If I was going to homeschool her, I had to take it seriously. I ordered textbooks online, printed out worksheets, and created a timetable. This gave me something to focus on besides worrying about whether she even existed.



"Let's start with science," I said on the first morning, opening a workbook suitable for second graders.



But Lily's questions quickly revealed that the standard curriculum was completely inadequate for her. She asked me what parents were, not what they did or how they did it. Their words and actions were important, but what were they essentially? The true meaning of parenthood.



"Well," I said slowly, "parents are the ones who created you. They brought you into this world and cared for you as you grew."



"Are you my parents?"



"I..." I hesitated. Am I? In what sense? I didn't give birth to her. Even three days ago, I had no memory of her existence. But she's sitting in my house now, calling me Mom, and I'm teaching her fractions. "Yes, I think I am."



She nodded contentedly. "And the other one? Matt?"



I noticed she never called him Dad or Father. Just Matt, and sometimes "the other one."



"He's your parent too."



"Really?" I almost laughed out loud at the skepticism in her voice.



Our lessons became a little strange. I taught her multiplication, which she grasped quickly, and then she'd ask me about the concept of change. Not physical change—she understood chemistry better than I did—but metaphysical change. What happens when something becomes something else? Is it still the same thing? If a caterpillar becomes a butterfly, which one is real?



We did experiments. I taught her to mix vinegar and baking soda to make a volcano model. She asked if we could try other combinations. Soon, the sunroom was filled with beakers and test tubes I'd ordered online. We made our own pH indicator from red cabbage. We extracted strawberry seeds from strawberries to cultivate. We built a model train from scratch. She not only made me explain how the motor works, but also why humans would want to move from one place to another.



These were some of the happiest times of my life in years. Lily was always so captivating; her mind was sharp and peculiar, switching freely between the concrete and the abstract. She seemed tireless and never complained. She absorbed information like a sponge, then posed questions that made me rethink everything I thought I understood.



Matt basically ignored us, treating us like air. He'd go home, have dinner, and then go back to his office. Sometimes I'd see him looking at Lily with a look I couldn't decipher—definitely not love, but not hostility either. Perhaps it was wariness. As if she were a puzzle he couldn't solve.



These two months went by faster than I expected. I felt a pang of loss when the doctors and other organizations allowed Lily to return to school. The house would be empty again. I'd have to face my spreadsheets, my thoughts, and my fear of Matt's emotions alone again.



"Do I have to go?" Lily asked the night before school started. “This is important,” I said. “You need to be with other kids. To learn social skills, to make friends.”



“I prefer studying with you.”



“I do too,” I admitted. “But this is the best option.”



She accepted it without objection. I noticed that she almost always silently accepted everything. Not because she was passive, but because she seemed to understand that certain forms had to be followed, certain rituals had to be completed.



School turned out to be an unexpected enlightenment for Lily. She came home every day with new information unrelated to the formal curriculum. She learned about different family structures. She learned that some children had two fathers, two mothers, some had only one parent, and some had divorced parents. She learned that fathers could be gentle and caring, not cold and irritable.



“Sarah’s dad is her soccer coach,” she told me thoughtfully one evening, “and Mia’s dad makes her pancakes every Sunday with fruit shaped into various faces. Does Matt make those too?”



I felt a tightness in my chest. “He…he’s done his best, Lily.”



“Really?”



It was a simple question, yet it felt like a hidden door had opened beneath my feet.



About six months later, Matt’s tolerance for Lily began to wane. His initial wariness gradually turned into annoyance. She was too quiet, he said; the next day he said she was too noisy. She left her shoes in the hallway. Her breathing was too loud at meals. The criticisms were endless and baseless, something I’d long since grown accustomed to.



One evening, he yelled at Lily because she’d used the wrong cup—apparently his, even though there had never been such a rule between them, or in our house. Lily just stared straight at him, unblinking, and said, “I don’t know. I’ll get a different one next time.”



Her calmness seemed to infuriate him even more. “You’re not allowed to talk back!”



“I didn’t, talking back means…”



He raised his hand. Without thinking, I stepped between them. “Matt, don’t be like that. She didn’t mean any….”



He was furious, his face turning purple, the veins in his neck bulging. In that moment, I thought he was going to hit us both. Then he lowered his hand, turned, and slammed out of the house. I heard his car roar off the driveway.



Lily gently touched my arm. “Thank you, mama.”



That night, after Lily went to sleep, I sat in the dark living room, trying to recall how I had gotten to where I was. But life before Lily came into my life felt distant.



A few weeks later, Lily asked a question that would change everything.



We were in the kitchen. I was making dinner, and she was doing her homework at the table. Matt would be home in an hour. The tension of his impending return made me tremble, my shoulders tense, and my hands clumsy.



“Mom,” Lily said without looking up, her eyes still fixed on her math worksheet, “can parents be replaced?”



I froze, a knife hovering over the cutting board. “What do you mean?”



“In school, we learned about divorce. After parents separate, the child lives with one of them. Sometimes the child gets new parents. Stepparents. Can that happen?”



I carefully put down the knife. “Yes. But it’s complicated.”



“Will that happen in our family?”



The question hung in the air. I should say no immediately. I should explain that Matt would never allow it, and the consequences would be dire. But I was too tired. So very tired. The thought of life without him, without his anger, threats, and meticulously planned cruelty, was intoxicating.



“If parents divorce,” I said slowly, choosing my words carefully, “there will be custody arrangements. The court will decide where the child lives and when visitation rights are granted. It depends on many factors.”



“What if one parent is bad? What if one parent has hurt someone else?”



My hands trembled, pressing tightly against the chicken I was cutting. “Then the court will try its best to protect the child. But it’s not always that simple. Sometimes, parents who hurt others will say they won’t hurt anyone again. Sometimes their words are very convincing. Sometimes…” I stopped, unable to continue.



“Sometimes what?”



“Sometimes, the parents who have been hurt are too scared to leave.”



Lily put down her pencil and looked at me with her innocent eyes. “Mommy, are you scared?”



I couldn’t lie to her. I couldn’t deceive myself anymore. “Yes.”



She nodded slowly, as if confirming something she already knew. “Do you want to leave? If you’re not scared?”



This was the first time someone had asked me what I wanted. Not what I should do, not what was appropriate, not what others expected of me. Just what I wanted.



“Yes,” I whispered. “God help me, yes.”



Lily continued with her homework, as if we had only been discussing the weather. But the atmosphere in the room seemed to have changed, some fundamental shift in reality that I couldn’t comprehend.



That evening, after dinner, Lily asked Matt if she could see a jigsaw puzzle she'd been working on. It was a complex three-dimensional puzzle, with pieces connected in seemingly impossible ways. She'd been racking her brains over it for weeks.



“I finally solved it!” she exclaimed excitedly, her voice still childlike. “Can I show it to you?”



Matt was in a good mood. He'd just closed a big deal, had a few bourbons, and was now in high spirits and unusually magnanimous. “Of course, son. Let me see.”



She led him to the sunroom. I followed, and for some reason, I felt a pang of guilt that they should be alone for even a moment. She showed him the puzzle and explained how she'd solved it. He nodded, unusually interested.



“Very clever,” he said.



Lily gave him a bright smile. Then, she deliberately knocked the puzzle to the floor, scattering pieces everywhere.



Matt's face instantly changed. The good mood brought on by the alcohol vanished, replaced by a chilling rage. “What’s wrong with you?”



“It was an accident,” Lily said, but her tone sounded neither sad nor apologetic. She sounded curious, as if conducting an experiment.



He lunged forward, raising his hands. I grabbed his arm. “Matt, stop! She didn’t mean to—”



He yanked me away, and I stumbled.



“Never mind that,” he said fiercely.



But he didn’t hit her. Something on her face, perhaps that calm, scrutinizing look, made him stop. He lowered his hands and walked out, panting.



Later, after I had put Lily to sleep, I sat on the edge of the bed. “You did it on purpose.”



“Yes.”



“Why?”



“I wanted to see what he would do.”



“Lily, that was dangerous. He could have hurt you.”



“But he didn’t. He wanted to hit me, but he didn’t. Why?”



I thought about it. “I don’t know. Maybe it’s because you were a child. Maybe it’s because I was there. Maybe it was just luck.”



She nodded, seemingly processing my words. “Mom, if you could change all of this. If you could make Matt disappear, would you?”



The question terrified me because the answer was direct and certain. “Yes.”



“Even if it means doing something bad?”



I should say no. I should explain the moral, ethical, and legal consequences to her. But I was too tired, years of fear and compliance suffocating me, and I just wanted it all to end.



“I don’t know,” I said honestly. “But you shouldn’t do it.”



She reached out and took my hand. Her fingers were cold. “What if I asked a friend for help? What if my friend could change him?”



I should say no. Everything inside me screamed rejection, wanted to end this conversation, wanted to realize the danger in her words. But I had never been so used to refusing requests. This pattern was deeply ingrained, a habit etched into my bones over decades.



“Lily—”



“Will you stop me?”



I looked at this strange child who had suddenly appeared in my life. Her question seemed to defy reality. She looked at me with an expression I couldn't understand. I realized I was more afraid of disappointing her than of the consequences.



“No,” I whispered. “I don’t actually know how to …”



She smiled. It was a warm, loving smile. In that moment, she seemed like an ordinary child, happy that something she wanted had been allowed.



“Thank you, Mom. It’ll be alright soon, I promise.”



She quickly fell asleep, her breathing deep and even. I sat there for a long time, watching her, wondering what I had just done. Finally, I went back to my room. Matt was already in bed, his back to me, snoring softly. I lay down beside him, staring at the ceiling, waiting to see what would happen next.



On Tuesday, Matt didn't come home from work.



At first, I thought he was just working overtime, or that he sometimes had a few drinks with colleagues, but he usually texted me. By seven o'clock, I started to worry, so I called his cell phone. It went straight to voicemail.



At nine o'clock, I called his office. The security guard who answered said Matt had left around 5:30 as usual. I called his brother Daniel, who said he hadn't been able to contact Matt for weeks.



At eleven o'clock, I called the police.



The officer who answered sounded impatient. He said it was common for adult men to go missing. They usually reappear within forty-eight hours. Had we had a fight? Did he just need some personal space?



"No," I said, which was the truth. We hadn't really fought lately. Matt was ……barely speaking to me these days, which somehow better than a fight.



"I'll open a case," the officer said. "If you get in touch with him, call us."



I hung up and found Lily standing in the living room doorway, watching me.



"He's not coming back," she said.



My stomach clenched. “How did you know?”



“I asked a friend for help. Like I promised.”



I slumped heavily onto the sofa. From the moment Matt’s car didn’t pull into the driveway as usual, I had a feeling this would happen. But knowing and accepting are two different things.



“Where is he?”



Lily came over and sat on the sofa beside me. She took my hands in hers, and I was touched again by her cold skin.



“He went somewhere, where he can’t hurt anyone anymore. A place more suitable for him than here. That’s all you need to know.”



“Lily, if you, or anyone, hurt him, we have to call the police.”



“No one hurt him, Mom. He just… changed. Like a caterpillar turning into a butterfly, remember? We talked about that. Things can completely change. He’s not Matt anymore. He’s become something else.something doesn’t remember you, doesn’t remember me, and doesn’t remember this house.”



I wanted to press for details, to understand what she meant. But there seemed to be a hint of impatience in her tone, as if she didn’t want to tell me the answer. Some knowledge was too heavy for me to bear.



“You promised you wouldn’t do it,” I said weakly.



“No, I didn’t. You asked if I would tell you if I planned to do something, and I did. I asked if you would stop me from getting help, and you said no. I kept my promise.”



She was right, of course. The logic was flawless. My silence, my powerless refusal, was tantamount to acquiescence.



“The police will investigate. They will find him.”



“They will look. They won’t find anything. They won’t find anything at all.”



“Lily, I need you to promise me one thing.”



She waited.



“Never do this again. Never… change anyone. For whatever reason. ok?”



She gazed at my face for a long time. Then she nodded. “I promise you, Mom. Only for you. Because you made me do this.



The investigation into Matt’s disappearance was perfunctory.  Holloway, the one who was at the police station the day Lily appeared. He came to my house twice  He asked a few questions about our marriage, Matt's habits, and whether I had noticed anything unusual in the weeks before his disappearance.



I answered all the questions truthfully. Yes, our marriage was indeed in trouble. No, Matt hadn't seemed any different lately. No, I didn't know where he went.



"Is it possible he committed suicide?" Holloway asked softly.



To be honest, I hadn't even thought about that. "I...I don't know. Maybe."



"We found his abandoned car in the state forest about sixty miles from here. There were no signs of murder. There was no evidence he met with anyone. It's as if he just left and moved on."



"Will police continue the search?"



Holloway sighed. "We'll do our best, Mrs. Harrison. But there's no evidence of a crime, and our resources are limited. I'm sorry." "



After he left, Lily and I sat in the kitchen. She was drawing,  intricate geometric patterns that seemed to change when I didn't look at them directly.



She finally looked up, and in the drawing, I saw something vast, strange, and incredibly ancient. It should have terrified me. Perhaps it had. But I didn't, so we spent the whole afternoon playing with coloring books.





Weeks passed. Matt's disappearance briefly made the local news, then vanished. His family was initially agitated; his mother called several times, her tone sharp and accusatory, as if I had orchestrated his disappearance. But the police found nothing. No     body. No signs of violence. No clues. Eventually, even his mother's calls stopped.





Charlotte contacted me once; her message was brief and perfunctory. 'I'm sorry to hear about Matt. Let me know if you need anything.'" I didn't reply.



Life became unusually quiet. I continued my accounting work. Lily went to school. We cooked dinner together, helped her with her homework, cuddled on the sofa watching movies. She joined the soccer team, losing more often than winning. She went to a friend's house and spent the night in her pajamas with some friends, but crying to me to pick her up at midnight.



 I took her to see a therapist a few times.They all said she was under too much pressure and was imagining friends to cope, or that she simply had her own system of logic. In short, they all agreed that Matt might just have disappeared. We did a few more family therapy sessions to ease the pressure on both of us.



But I couldn't escape what had happened. I couldn't escape what I had allowed to happen. In quiet moments, usually late at night after Lily had fallen asleep, I would think of Matt. Not the man who hurt me, but the man I dated and used love . I would wonder where Lily's "friends" had taken him, whether he had suffered, whether he was still conscious, whether he understood what he had become.



And, am I a... A murderer.



Because I am a murderer, aren't I? Even though I didn't do it myself, even though I didn't understand why he disappeared, I condoned it all. I should have said "No, Lily," and spent half an hour explaining to her why it was wrong. For the first time in my life, this acquiescence had irreversible consequences.



One evening, about three months after Matt disappeared, I found Lily in the sunroom. She was looking out at the woods, her face pressed against the glass. The setting sun painted the sky a vibrant orange-purple, almost unreal.



"I don't know what to do," I confessed. But at that moment, I wasn't sure if I meant the spreadsheets that had been bothering me for a week, or Matt.



Lily came to me and wrapped her little arms around my waist. I hugged her, this incredible child, her body pressed against mine, cold and icy, yet her embrace was incredibly tender.



"You don't have to do anything," her voice muffled against my stomach. "Just stay here, Mommy." I try not to think about it, but I still don't know how to say "no."



I'll never know what to do.
