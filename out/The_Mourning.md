“Christ Jed, what the hell is that?”

I stood looking at the wall of Jed’s barn, at his newest attraction. Something straight out of one of those sci-fi or horror mags was nailed to the old wood.

“Don’t rightly know,” Jed replied.

I had to admit, the hoax this year was impressive. Last year it was a giant’s bones he had “dug up” on his property. Bones we weren’t allowed to touch, lest we discover the plaster of paris it was made with. He probably had a lot of that stuff left over from the sasquatch footprint he did the year before that. And before that was the mermaid he fished up in the lake on his property. He was able to charge people to fish in his lake that year, and all it took was some creative taxidermy with a fish and a shaved cat.

But the thing this year...it looked almost beyond his capabilities. All the years of making hoaxes had done their work, and developed his craft excellently. The thing looked as if it had leapt out of a Hollywood movie. Jed could probably sell his property and work in some effects shop somewhere if he really wanted to with this kinda work.

“Dollar if you wanna hear the story.” Jed’s rocking chair creaked forward as he leaned in and slid a large glass jar forward. Coins littered the bottom, and a layer of crunched up bills laid on top of them.

I sighed and reached for my pocket. Hell, he deserved it this time. It was an impressive dummy. I took out a rubber-banded roll of cash and pulled a dollar out, dropping it in Jed’s jar with one hand while returning the roll to my pocket with the other.

“Thank ye kindly,” Jed said, a smile on his face.

“Only a dollar? You charged people ten to fish at the lake those years back. And it was five to look at them bones last year.”

“Well,” he looked around side to side, “Between you and me, Jack, aint no secret that those were…less than true.”

“Aint no secret at all,” I smiled.

“Shut it.” he said sharply. “Point is, I put in less work this year round. Didn’t have to make no big monster dummy. All I had to do was kill the fucker.” He smiled and leaned back in his chair, creaking as it went.

I scoffed. “You tryin’ to tell me Mr. Halloween-City up there is real? Like that mermaid and pixie you had before?”

“No damn it, I’m tellin’ ya it’s real this year.” Annoyance flashed across his face, his brow furrowing. I don’t know what he expected after years of hoaxes, but belief shouldn’t have been it. “Listen, ya paid yer dollar, you wanna hear the damn story or not?”

“Sure, Jed, sure.” I said. Why not; I came here to be entertained after all. Jed’s yearly pranks were well known in town, and everyone always stopped by if only to see what he cooked up. He actually had the news show up the year he had the jarred pixies. The town actually had tourists that summer. To this day, some businesses in town still sell merchandise with pixies on ‘em; cookies shaped like the things, t-shirts, keychains. Say what you will about Jed and his hoaxes, it’s worked out for the town before.

“Alright,” He relaxed a bit. The chair creaked. “Was last Thursday. Was driving my truck back from Macky’s late at night. Takin’ Howard road, ya know, the one that goes near them trails? With that canopy of trees that blocks the sky?”

“I know the road Jed, I been here a long time.” The part of the road he was describing was well known to me. There was a nice trail entrance nearby where people could walk and enjoy the woods. Right off that trail was an open area the Boy Scouts camped at yearly around Earth Day. The river was also a popular spot for kids to sift for shark teeth. Not just the kids, it seemed.

I squinted at the thing on the wall. Looked like Jed had gone there recently, too. The thing had a human-like face, though gray and misshapen. What caught my eye was the mouth. It hung open, stretching longer than a human’s jaw should. The corners of the mouth were ripped open, long slashes going to the middle of the cheeks which allowed the jaw to drop unnaturally low. And inside the mouth lay those teeth, the same as the shark teeth that could be found in the river. Jed must have made a trip.

“I was driving on the road,” he continued, “When I heard a *THUMP-*” He slapped an open hand on the table hard for effect. “Coming from above me. Somethin’ had landed on my truck’s roof. With all the damn trees on that road, I had assumed that a branch had hit me or somethin’. Wasn’t the first time. I kept driving home. I don’t know if that was a mistake or not.”

“I thought I’d check the damage once I was home. It was late and I was tired, and the last thing I wanted to do was stop. Plus, there wasn’t exactly a lotta light out. Would be pretty hard to check the roof of my car out there. I’d do it in the comfort of my own garage. It was only once I pulled in that I realized something was wrong.”	“I drove up my driveway, used my clicker to open the garage door, and pulled in. I turned to get something out of the backseat. Something was off. I couldn’t place it, but something just didn’t feel right. Was I forgetting something? Leftovers from Macky’s were in the passenger seat. Still had my wallet in the cupholder. Now just what the hell was wro-.” Jed stopped mid story and leaned in closer.

“The roof of my car was pierced. Two land holes in it, one slightly behind the driver seat, back and to the left, and one slightly back and to the right of the passenger’s seat. The thing that made the holes was still there, and it wasn’t no branch. Long claws.” He nodded up at the thing on the wall.

It had remarkably long arms, with legs only half the size. At the end of each arm was a three digit hand with long nails (or, more accurately, claws) stretching out. Jed pinched his thumb, index, and middle finger together and held it up to me.

“It had its fingers together like this and pierced my car roof with ‘em,” he said. “Musta dropped down from the trees and hooked itself onto my car. Was riding with me for miles. Lord knows what it wanted to do to me.”

“I hadn’t moved for a while. I was terrified. The car roof began to creak under the thing’s impatience. I had one shot; the door to my house was right next to me, ‘bout ten feet from the car. One lucky swipe from the thing on my car roof was all it needed to get me. I’d need a distraction. Then I remembered my clicker, my garage door opener.”

“I held it in one hand while I wrapped my other against the door handle. I pressed the button. The whole car shook as the thing turned to the now closing door. In that second, I pushed the car door open as fast as I could and ran to the house door. I could feel the thing turn back to me, feel its eyes staring daggers into my back. I heard it shuffle, pry its talons loose from my car. I could hear the metal creaking under it as it prepared to pounce. *SLAM!”* Jed whacked the table again.

“I threw my door shut and a second later it slammed against it. Took all my strength to keep it shut. I locked it and stayed leaning on it for a while. The slams against the door got weaker. Tired itself out I think. Was able to grab a chair and stick it under the knob.”

“So you locked the thing in your garage,” I said. “Great. Then how’d you get around to killin’ it? I don’t see any bullet holes in it, no wounds or no-” I stopped mid sentence, realizing something. Jed grinned.

“Figured it out?”  
“You never turned your car off.”  
“Nope.”  
“And that worked?”

“Seems to have. Monster or not, it’s a living creature, same as us. Same kinda things should kill it. Just had to let the exhaust choke ‘em out. I grabbed my shotgun just in case and left my house through the front door. Didn’t get a lick of sleep that night. Just stood outside, watching the closed garage door, aiming my gun at it. Just in case…” Jed trailed off.

“That it?” I said.

“Just about. Cracked the big garage door open in the morning, waited a few for that toxic shit to clear. Truck was outta gas, buncha stuff got all messed up from havin’ it on all night. Nothin’ I couldn’t fix up though.” He looked up at the creature hanging on the wall. “Found it on the ground, staring up at the ceiling, limbs splayed out. Poked that thing with my gun. Checked for a pulse. Was cold as ice. Its limbs had started to stiff, and the blood in its body started to pool in the back. Signs of death I seen before.”

“And then you just nailed it to your barn wall for people to gawk at?” I asked. “No calling the police, nothing?”

“I sure as shit did.” replied Jed. “Figured I’d show it off. Figured I’d make a little money off it. Let the word spread. It’ll be like that pixie stuff from years back, you’ll see. Only this time, it’s real. When the news shows up, they’ll bring their scientists and study it. Tourists will show. Should be a good little bit of business for our small town, all thanks to ol’ Jed.” He smiled.

I shook my head and stood up. “Well, it’s a fun story, I’ll give you that, but I don’t know if  your dummy here is gonna fool any scientists.” Jed scoffed. “And I’m not sure how many tourists something so monstrous lookin’ would bring in.”

“Ahh hell with you.” Jed swatted a hand at the air. “It’s popular enough already. Past two nights I had teenagers try to steal it. Or just get a closer look or somethin’, I don’t know. Them messin’ with the barn door wakes me up sometimes, the rattlin’ of the chains I use to lock it up. They stop when they hear me open the window though to yell at ‘em.”

I chuckled at him. “Well Jed, you have fun with your monster. I’m heading to Macky’s for food. Might suggest they add a Monster Burger to the menu, for all the tourists we’ll get from that ugly thing.”

\_\_\_\_\_

“You here again tonight?” I asked Jim, the bartender at Macky’s.

“Yeah,” said Jim. “Don’t you know, I have the EFD shift.”

“What’s that?”

“The Every Fucking Day shift.”

I chuckled. “Just get me a turkey club and whatever wheat you have on tap.”

“Sure thing, Jack. I’ll put the food in now.”

I glanced around the bar. Full as always, despite its dinginess. The indoor smoking areas and the late operating hours were probably two large reasons it remained so popular among the working men. Jim came back with my beer, placing it on a tiny coaster napkin.

“So,” he began, resting a hand on the bar counter. “You go by Jed’s yet? See this year’s creature?”

“Yeah, Jim, I did. Real freaky shit this year. How long you think it took him to make it?”

“No idea. Impressive craftsmanship, I’ll give him that, though.” Jim looked at me, a grin forming on his face. “You think it’s gonna go big? Like with the pixie shit? Could never sell my last five or so t-shirts from that boom.”

I shrugged. “I don’t know, man…The mermaid, the pixie, hell, even the sasquatch. Those were all…safer? More marketable?” I struggled to find the word. “They aint as freaky as that thing on the wall. That was nasty looking. Too nasty looking. I don’t know if it’ll have the same appeal as a Mothman or something. Might need to wait a while longer for something to bring in that tourist boom.”

It *was* freaky. Too freaky. I didn’t like to admit it, but after seeing that thing and hearing Jed’s story…I *knew* it was fake. I knew it was all bullshit, just a small town prank meant for fun like the countless before it. But the details in that creature, the smaller details in the story…

“I told him to bury it.” A voice a few seats down interrupted. I looked over. Sitting a few seats to my left was Father Cunningham, the local pastor.

“Pardon, Father?” I replied.

“I told Jed to bury that thing. Or burn it. Or hell, just leave it out for its kin to collect. Might not be one of God’s creatures, but it was a living creature and deserves some respect in death, at least.”

“Father Cunningham, you believed that yarn Jed was spinning?” Jim had interrupted. He slid the plate with my food on it in front of me. “I mean, excuse my language,” he continued, “But that was all just bullshit, wasn’t it? Like all the other stuff he had before. I mean, come on. Monsters in our woods?”

The Father shook his head. “I know what I saw. I was one of the first to see the dead thing. It wasn’t made by him; it was a living creature. I know it.” Jim shook his head, and turned, moving on to conversations with other customers. Father Cunningham switched to me. “I told him to bury it,” he said, “No good comes from keeping that around and treating it like some attraction. He thinks there's just one? Most likely to be more; something had to birth it. Imagine how upset you’d be if someone killed your kid, Jack. And then imagine how you’d feel if the killer paraded the corpse around for entertainment. It’s just wrong.”

I was taken aback by this outburst from the Father. “You really do believe Jed’s story.” I said, amazed. It was all too crazy.

“I saw Jed’s creature before he hung it up. When I passed his house during my morning walk on Friday, I saw his garage was open so I went to let him know. As I got closer, I saw him inside with his shotgun. And I saw the thing. Jack, I went back today and saw it and I’m telling you *it’s decomposing.* The stomach’s become more bloated, the eyes have become glazed over, and the hint of cherry-red in its face has gone a full gray. Notes of the sewer-sweet smell of decay have begun to rise. Jed’s story was true; *that thing was alive!”*

I didn’t know what to say. The pastor had gone completely mad. Or Jed had put him up to it. Try to get more people convinced? It was far to go for a hoax, even for Jed. I muttered something about getting back to my food and turned to eat. I found myself, however, taking a different route home that night, one that avoided Howard’s Road. It would still take me past Jed’s place.

\_\_\_

Something was wrong. I saw from the road that Jed’s barn door was wide open. As I got close, I noticed it was smashed in. Large, splintered chunks of wood were splayed out from the center of the left door and the right was missing the upper hinge. The lights were on in Jed’s house, and his front door was wide open. I continued on into the barn, standing inside of it for the second time that night. And I stared at the empty wall.

Jed had disappeared. Like he turned into smoke. Police weren’t able to find anything that night; only other thing missing was Jed’s shotgun. Nothing else was out of the ordinary. Leading theory that night was that a group of burglars had broken into the barn and taken Jed’s creature. They had also kidnapped Jed, perhaps using his own gun. No blood was found at the scene, so he had to have been taken somewhere.

He was found a couple days later. It was Boy Scouts out by the camping area near Howard’s Road who had found him. In a clearing was a disturbed patch of dirt in the middle of the grass, about 3 feet by 6 feet. Jed’s shotgun was shoved vertically into the disturbed dirt, and at the fulcrum lay a pile of gore. Unidentifiable meat that had been cooking in the sun for the past two days, putrefying. Impaled on the top of the shotgun was Jed’s head, tilting at an angle. The jaw was hang-swung open, his bloating, slug-like tongue lolled out. The eyes were glazed over, and the flesh on him was beginning to naturally slough off. No scavengers had touched his flesh, only natural decomposition.

The whole town had heard of it. Hell, half of us went to see it. Police closed off the area. Fenced it off. Hasn’t been officially open in months. But there are those of us in town that still go. They leave that gate unlocked; it’s for keeping out-of-towners out, mostly. We keep it open and we take our weekly pilgrimage to pay our respects. They never cleaned Jed up, they knew better than to do that.

The area wasn’t cleaned up for the same reason we went to see it every week; because we knew that the things in the woods were watching us. We didn’t pay respects to Jed, we paid our respects to whatever was buried in the grave Jed now acted as a headstone for. And we prayed it would be enough.
