Hi everyone, I'm Alex, just a random guy that likes reading stories on here, I never thought I'd have a story worth sharing since my life is boring, the highlights of it being family time with my grandpa, and him telling me his hunting stories.

Sadly, my world crumbled as my grandpa died last month, that's why I haven't been active on Reddit, nor other social media. But going through his stuff, since I'm the last relative he has, I found an interesting story in his journal which i decided to share with you all, to show gratitude to the community that kept me thrilled for all these years. Anyways, I'll type this thing as is, some parts of the journal are worn out, it being old, but my grandpa took good care of his things, as much as I wanna fill them and try my hand at writing stories on here, I don't want to taint the authenticity of the story, so here is the story I found as is:

I had always loved the woods. The peacefulness, the serenity, the way the sun shone through the trees, it was my escape. But that all changed when I went on a hunting trip with my friends. We had been walking for hours, tracking a large buck. As the sun began to set, we realized we were lost. We decided to make camp for the night and continue our search in the morning. That's when we heard it. A faint rustling in the bushes. We assumed it was the buck we had been tracking, but as we turned to face the noise, we saw something that chilled us to the bone.

A figure, tall and menacing, stood before us. Its eyes glowed in the darkness, and its body was covered in fur. We stood frozen in fear as it let out a terrifying roar. We ran as fast as we could, but it was no use. The creature was faster and stronger. It was hunting us. 

Hours passed as we desperately tried to outrun the monster. Our group dwindled with every passing moment until it was just me and a friend's friend, Josh, as we reached a clearing. We thought we had lost it, but then the creature emerged from the shadows, and we realized that it was not hunting us. It was leading us. As it dashed towards us, we had no choice but to enter the cabin in the middle of the woods. We hesitated, but there was no time. It was do or die, and we were desperate. As we entered, we realized our mistake. Whatever it could do to us was incomparable to the fate we had set stepping in there. 

The cabin was empty, save for a few scattered belongings. The door slammed shut behind us, and we were trapped. As I frantically searched the cabin with my fellow survivor, I stumbled upon an old book with strange symbols etched into the cover. My heart raced as I opened the book and realized that the curse was not meant for us. It was meant for the creature, a spell that would trap it in the cabin, unable to escape. We would use the creature's fear of the curse to our advantage. We drew the symbols from the book onto the walls of the cabin, creating a makeshift prison for the creature. As we finished the last symbol, the creature let out a blood-curdling scream. It was trapped, unable to escape. My heart pounded with relief as we fled the cabin, thinking we had finally escaped the curse.

But as we emerged to the woods, we realized the true horror of what we had done. The curse was not meant for the creature but for whoever entered the cabin. We had inadvertently passed the curse onto ourselves, and now we were doomed to be trapped in the cabin forever, trapped with it.

I can feel my heart racing. The fear was unlike anything I had ever experienced before. As we fled back into the cabin, I couldn't help but feel a sense of dread wash over me. We had thought we were safe by completing the strange symbols from the book, but the curse had taken hold of us. We were trapped in that cabin. And we were not alone.

The creature, now trapped within the walls of the cabin, let out a low growl. It was as if it knew what we had done, and it was angry. We tried everything our panicked selves could think of in order to escape the cabin, but every attempt was met with failure. The curse was unbreakable, and we were doomed to whatever fate the creature would force onto us.

And then, the last thing we expected to happen happened. The cabin was filled with silence, deafening silence. We couldn't move a step, let alone utter a word to one another, and the silence wasn't broken for hours, which turned into days. We survived on whatever we could forage in the massive cabin, living in terror and fear, sleepless and malnourished. The presence of the creature was less torturous than the unknown we were currently being subjected to. Its sinister presence was, in a way, merciful. Our fear turned to madness as we began to turn on each other, our sanity slipping away as we were forced to confront the horrifying reality of our situation, but the worst was yet to come.

One night, as we sat huddled together in the darkness, slipping through the cracks of sanity, we heard a strange noise. It was a whisper, a voice that seemed to be coming from within the cabin itself. We ignored it, as we had been ignoring all of our hallucinations, but the voice grew louder, consistent, and insistent. It was calling out to us, beckoning us deeper into the cabin, to depths we dared not breach. And then we saw it. A figure, shrouded in darkness, standing at the end of the hallway. I couldn't make out its features, but its malevolent presence needed no introduction. Fatigued as we were, we tried to run, to no avail. It stepped forward, revealing its form.

It certainly was the creature, its form was shadowy, undefined, but standing on all fours. As it stepped into our sight, its features started to clarify. It was the large buck that caused us to be lost in these cursed woods. It was laughing, a buck was laughing, a cold, heartless laugh that echoed through the cabin. I know not if I slipped too far into insanity's embrace, I know not if I trust my senses anymore, I only know of the last hope I was holding onto, shattering with the glass-breaking laughter, the laughter of a buck.

As it laughed, forcing me back onto my feet, I finally got it. This creature is insane, it didn't get trapped in here, this creature was never forced into anything, it chose this, it orchestrated this. It put the book there for us to find and trap ourselves. I can't begin to fathom how it thinks. It entertained itself with our despair, the fear of us trapped in here with it, the helplessness and the despondence, the sickness of having trapped ourselves. We were not its prey. Far worse, we were toys. Our hopelessness was its pastime, and it would go as far as trapping itself to maximize it, or will it? Is it even trapped with us? There is no light for us, forever trapped in a nightmare from which there was no escape. I felt a surge of anger and disgust towards the creature, emotions I grew distant from, realizing that it had toyed with our lives for its amusement. How could it be so heartless? So cruel? But then again, it was not human. It knew not of compassion or empathy.

The creature approached us slowly, its eyes glinting in the darkness. We were paralyzed with fear, knowing that there was no escape from this nightmare. And then it spoke. Its voice was low and raspy, sending shivers down our spines. It taunted us, telling us how it had planned everything from the start, how it had led us into this cursed cabin and trapped us there for eternity. As it spoke, I could feel my mind slipping away, my sanity fraying at the edges. I was trapped in a nightmare, unable to wake up. It was like being stuck in a never-ending horror movie, with no hope of salvation.

And then the creature, I don't know how to explain it, but, it shaped into a human form. Its eyes were still glowing, but now it wore a twisted grin on its face. It approached us slowly, its footsteps echoing through the cabin. And then it lunged. I could feel its sharp claws digging into my flesh, tearing at my skin. I screamed, but the creature only laughed, reveling in my pain and terror.

And then everything went black. I woke up in a cold sweat, realizing that it had all been a nightmare. But as I looked around, I saw that I was still in the cursed cabin. The creature was still there, lurking in the shadows, waiting to strike. I knew then that I was truly trapped, with no hope of escape. The curse had taken hold of me, and I was doomed to spend eternity in this nightmare. The creature approached me again, its eyes gleaming with malice. And then it spoke, its voice echoing through the cabin."

This is me again, sorry for interrupting the story but this part here is torn out. Anyways, I'll continue onto the next part I can read.

I'm finally out of here, I regret what I did, it should have been me alone, God please forgive me. If you read to this part, it means you've read the story, what comes next is very important, do exactly as I tell you, this is a serious matter, the story I wrote here is true, I had made a deal with that creature, unlike Josh who refused and paid dearly, the creature would let me leave the cabin, and in return, I allow it to attach itself to my bloodline, and it would haunt me for life, me and all those I love and if I were to ever tell anyone about it, it had ways to make me regret it. Now, since I haven't told anyone and since it never reacted to my journal, knowing what I had written in it, I believe reading the story wouldn't incur its wrath.

And if you read this, Blair, know that I believe in God, you may have forced me into unholy acts in the cabin, you may have tainted my soul, but I shall never..."

And it stops here again, I tried to transcribe it to the last word and that was it. Reading this though, this spooked the hell out of me, my girlfriend's middle name is Blair, and she's the only Blair I ever known personally.. and, she, oh god, she always had excuses to avoid meeting my grandpa.
