The end of the world has always and will always be a controversial topic. Some people say it will happen when the sun explodes, some when humans destroy it and some belive in judgment day. 

My story begins on a dark and quiet night. It was very calm. I was outside in the woods playing my guitar. It was very relaxing, sitting on the forest ground, playing guitar surrounded by nature. 

I was getting ready to pack up and go back home when I heard a noise. It was a crack of a branch. It wasn't abnormal to hear this but usually it meant a predator so I prepared myself. I grabbed my guitar and held the neck, holding it as a sort of bat. 

Admittedly I must've looked stupid but either way I knew first hand a guitar to the face hurts. There was another crack of a branch. I felt my ankles and feet all of a sudden become very cold. I looked down and saw that the ground had been covered in a thick mist so thick that I couldn't see my ankles. 

I looked back up. I couldn't see anything so I turned around. I dropped my guitar in shock. Stood infront of me was a dark creature that stood about a head taller than me. It had dark antlers that stood up multiple feet above the thing, it had 6 pale grey eyes that stared deep unto me.

It's face looked like one of those skulls that you see on western films in the desert just without the horns. It was clothed with a black cloak that reached the ground. 

It took a step over towards me. It looked down at me and nodded it's head. Inside my head I heard a voice. 

"Hello, human. I have come to your plain of existence to warn your race of its eventual demise and the end of your existence. I am what is known as an estrian and I roam earth but in another plain of existence. My race has advanced way beyond yours but because of your races actions during your existence the shayk race will destroy yours soon. However, due to how your race has been built up and developed, your race could fend of the skayk if warned previously. That is my job." 

I stood there in shock. Who was this thing? Why did it want to warn me? What is the estrians? What is the shayk? 

I was then transported. I felt myself floating through the air as I saw visions. I saw bodies of humans who's faces had been ripped off lined in huge rows that spanned miles. I saw buildings being destroyed. I saw airplanes fall down back to earth. I saw a man have his throat ripped out. I saw a woman have their legs torn off. I saw a person have their eyeballs torn out.

I felt myself start to cry. I saw a boat sink whilst people scremed for help aboard. I saw houses on fire, people running through streets screaming. 

Just as quick as it started, it stopped. I felt myself fall back to the ground as I fell to my knees. I started to break down, what had I seen? Was that what awaited humans? 

I stayed there and sobbed for a while. I looked back up at the thing that had told me. It looked back at me with those pale black eyes. I heard another voice in my head. 

"Spread the word, before it is too late. I must leave now. Good luck."
