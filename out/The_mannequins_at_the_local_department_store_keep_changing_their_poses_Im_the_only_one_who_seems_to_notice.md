I live in a small town, the kind where everyone knows everyone, and nothing much ever happens. The biggest attraction in town is our local department store, a multi-story building filled with clothes, toys, and everything in between. The store is also home to a collection of mannequins, used to showcase the latest fashion trends.


I visit the store almost every day, a routine formed out of sheer boredom. It was on one of these visits that I first noticed something odd. The mannequins, which usually stood in generic, static poses, were different. Their positions had changed, their plastic hands gesturing, their stiff bodies leaning towards each other as if in conversation.


I brushed it off, assuming the staff had moved them. However, the next day, they had changed again. This time, their poses were more elaborate. They were no longer just standing; they seemed to be interacting, their plastic faces turned towards each other, their arms extended as if frozen mid-action.


Days turned into weeks, and the mannequins kept changing. No two days saw them in the same pose. They started mirroring everyday activities – one day, they'd be huddled around like they were at a party; another day, they'd be positioned as if playing a game of charades.


Then, the mannequins started to get personal.


One day, I walked into the store to find them mimicking a scene eerily similar to my morning routine. The mannequins were gathered around a mock kitchen, one pouring a nonexistent cup of coffee, another reading a paper. It was unnervingly similar to what I had done just hours before.


The following day, they were mimicking my office environment – mannequins sat behind a desk, others stood as if discussing a project. Each day that passed, they got more accurate, more detailed, as if someone was watching my life and directing the mannequins to copy it.


I tried telling people – friends, family, even the store's staff. They laughed it off, attributing it to coincidence or an overactive imagination. But I knew what I was seeing.


Things took a terrifying turn when the mannequins started to mimic not just my past, but my future.


I walked into the store one day to find the mannequins gathered around a hospital bed. I laughed at the absurdity of it until I got a call later that evening. My mother had been rushed to the hospital.


Since then, every scene the mannequins pose for happens in real life. A birthday party. A car accident. Even a funeral.


I'm scared. I don't know how this is happening, or why. I don't know who's orchestrating this or what they want. I don't know if I'm being warned or threatened.


But the worst part is the uncertainty. Walking into that store each day, not knowing what I'll find, what glimpse of the future I'll get. Not knowing if I'll see a scene of normalcy or a premonition of disaster.


I'm terrified of the mannequins, of their silent, frozen figures. I'm terrified of what they might show next.


But most of all, I'm terrified of the future they predict. Because today, I walked into the store to find the mannequins mimicking a scene of someone being murdered, and the victim looked disturbingly like me.
