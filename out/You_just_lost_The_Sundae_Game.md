And for that, I am sorry.

“I beg your pardon?” I asked after being told the same thing. “Is that some new version of *The Game*? Just, you know, on a Sunday?”

There came no immediate answer from the gaunt, grey-haired stranger in Fenchurch Street railway station. He was hopping from one foot to the other, as if the platform were burning through his soles, and his eyes burrowed into me. Sand-coloured pupils that seemed to melt; slip down the whites. An impossibility explained, as far as I was concerned, by the late day’s golden hour bathing his face in gilded rays.

The man certainly didn’t alarm me at first. In fact, I found him and his game quite amusing.

“It’s Thursday,” he eventually corrected, light-brown eyes looking over my shoulder at the approaching train.

*In my defence, you don’t strike me as the sort of man who knows the day of the week*, I inwardly replied, restraining a chortle.

“I’m also not talking about that kind of Sunday,” continued the stranger. “I’m talking about, you know, the ice cream.”

I laughed — brayed like a horse, actually, until I noticed that the man maintained that deep column of folds on his brow. That unamused expression.

*Ah. Not a funny man, just a mad one*, I realised.

“What are the rules of this game?” I asked, hoping to keep at least one of us entertained.

“Rules?” the stranger repeated incredulously.

“You know…” I began, muffling a second chuckle. “No feeding vanilla to the gremlin after midnight. That sort of thing.”

He peered past me, as if willing the approaching train to hurry up. “Well, you have to avoid them. And if you make it through the white door, you’ll get all you ever wanted.”

“Wow!” I gasped, as if feigning excitement at a child’s story. “Sounds like one heck of a prize.”

The man quickly shook his head, and his neck made the oddest sound; like a muffled squeak in water-clogged ears. “There is no winning.”

He was tugging irritably at the sleeves of his leather jacket, seemingly discontent with the cuffs stopping at his knuckles; he was trying to conceal the very tips of his fingers. Most curiously of all, the barmy gentleman was clearly in a hurry to escape. Baffling, given that he had started the conversation — *I* was supposed to be the one eager to get away. For that reason alone, I didn’t immediately dismiss The Sundae Gamer as a run-of-the-mill, best-avoided, lager-fuelled Londoner.

Actually, I was beginning to view him as something worse; beginning to lose that grin on my face. And, like him, I was simply facing the train in the distance, hoping that the conversation would end.

“The game is a lie,” the man whimpered between staggering, fearful breaths. “A trap designed to lure you to *them*. Get it?”

*Sure, crackpot*, I thought, nodding and smiled politely.

“You don’t,” he mumbled. “Look, I’d rather you get the next train.”

I raised an eyebrow. “Oh, aye, would you?”

The stranger scratched the back of his head, then frowned at something on his fingers. “I need to get as far away from you as possible.”

“Sure,” I said calmly, not wanting to antagonise this unstable man.

“I know you don’t believe me,” he panted as the train started to chug to a stop. “I was the same. But, look, *you* should kick the can down the road too. There isn’t time to figure out how to beat this. Just pass it along like I did, okay? You have to wait until you’re soft.”

*Please don’t talk about me being soft*, I thought, side-stepping to put a little more distance between us.

Then came the hiss of air brakes, and the train doors slid apart. Within a moment, I was swallowed by tides of departing and boarding passengers. The stranger vanished into the crowd; presumably scurried onto the train ahead. And if I could go back and do things differently, I’d join him. Talk to him. Ask him what it all meant.

But he was right. I didn’t believe, so I stayed on the platform.

*I’m fine with staying far away from you, Mr Manic Sundae*, I decided.

I stood in the midst of the thinning crowd until I was the only remaining person on the platform. Then I watched the train pull away, struggling to find the face of the stranger in the well-packed metal box. Not that I cared too greatly — I could already feel my chest unknotting; could already feel myself forgetting him.

Once the train had moved out of sight, however, I saw something beyond the two sets of tracks before me.

“Oh, you have *got* to be kidding me,” I muttered under my breath.

On the opposite platform, there stood a man in all white: pristine tuxedo and an angular diner hat. A vendor missing only red pinstripes on his jacket. He was facing away from me. Of course, I cackled with laughter, looking for the hidden cameras as I convinced myself that the stranger had been pranking me all along.

“Very funny!” I yelled at the man across the way.

I’d barely finished the second word when the white-suited vendor started to turn. Swivelled with precision, moving only his feet — keeping his legs and arms eerily sharp and straight as he twisted. Firstly, I recognised the brand logo on his jacket’s lapel. It belonged to a popular chain of dessert cafés. I won’t reveal it to you, in case you’ve eaten there.

I felt a scream brewing in my throat, and it came as soon as the man finished turning to face me.

Below his retro hat, The Vendor stared at me with a *mouth*. A wide, smiling mouth sitting in the middle of a strangely-textured face. A face with no eyes and no nose. Just thin, red lips on bumpy, creamy skin that did not look like flesh. The smile widened painfully, swirling the texture of his face. And when those lips finally drew apart, The Vendor revealed something other than rows of teeth.

A hallway led into his throat. A rectangular, gum-walled, blood-stained corridor with a single white door at the end. After only revealing that potential prize for a second, the thing closed its lips, resumed smiling awfully, and began to walk forwards at a brisk pace; brisker than even its swivel, which had happened within a blink. The Vendor stepped down from his platform and took well-measured strides across the two sets of tracks; all without peeling its lips, forming some wretched eye, away from me.

I shrieked a second time and stumbled backwards, scraping my neck against the sharp, protruding edge of a schedule board behind me. I winced in pain and tapped the wet skin. Then I brought my fingers around to my eyes and saw not red, but *creamy white*.

Before untangling this impossibility, I realised that The Vendor had started to clamber onto my platform, so I focused, rather, on dashing through the unsettlingly deserted station. Dashing to the exit and fleeing into the darkening stomach of the city.

I vaguely remember passing frowning Londoners. Vaguely remember sprinting until I reached a bus stop roughly a mile from Fenchurch Street. I drew more than a few stares from folk standing under the bus shelter as I twitched erratically, casting my eyes in all directions — that might’ve been another reason for their discomfort.

When the bus finally arrived, the sun had set, and I was glad to escape from the cold, black streets of the city — the strangely *lifeless* streets of the city. I didn’t know what I’d seen in that station. Certainly didn’t believe in things beyond earthly reasoning, but I was struggling to come up with a comfy explanation. I berated myself every time I considered, for even a moment, that the crazy old man’s story had been true. That he’d doomed me to play some Satanic game.

Whatever the case, I was simply happy to be on a moving vehicle. To be heading home.

“You’re bleeding,” came a slight whisper beside me.

My heart slipped out of rhythm for a moment, and I cast my eyes to the left of the bus; saw a young, blonde woman smiling at me softly. The passenger nodded at my neck, and my skin tightened as I recalled my injury. Recalled the white clump I’d scratched away from my nape and wiped on my jacket.

Unwillingly, I dabbed my fingers against that wound once again and felt liquid against my flesh. Felt my legs buckle as I brought my trembling fingers around to my eyes. And when I saw a few drops of blood on my hand, rather than white mush, I grinned; felt like dancing with joy.

The woman giggled lightly. “Strange to smile at blood, isn’t it?”

I laughed along, averting my gaze awkwardly. “Yes. Sorry, it’s been a weird evening. I think I might have been seeing things. You ever had a night like that?”

The woman, surprisingly, brushed her fingers against the back of my palm. “No, Flynn. I see only what is truly there.”

My soul stalled; checked out as I viewed my petrified body from above.

When I returned to my physical form, moments later, I looked at the woman beside me. She was wide-mouthed, licking something with the tip of her tongue; a white clump melting against her giddily quivering fingers. I looked down at the back of my palm, which felt cold and fresh, and screeched.

Screeched upon seeing a curved hole in my skin. Screeched until my vocal cords snapped.

There was no blood in the wound. It was a canyon of taut skin, revealing a missing clump that the bus passenger had spooned out of me. A scoop of pale, discoloured flesh with the inexplicable consistency of a vanilla sundae.

What frightened me above all else was that I found myself unable to move my legs. As if I had been shelved in a freezer, and the ice were taking hold; moving from my toes to my head.

“*You almost taste ready*,” she mumbled through mouthfuls as my eyes started to well up.

In horror, I tilted my head downwards to see not tears, but sloppy, brown gunk dripping onto the bus floor. Then, mouth stunned into silence, I looked at the other passengers for help. But they had their heads cranked forwards — all were sleeping soundly.

And when I shot my head towards the rear-view mirror, hoping for help from the driver, my brain flared painfully. Behind the wheel, there sat a carbon copy of the smiling woman standing beside me.

The clone snorted erratically, letting tears, snot, and dribble pour from her facial orifices in relentless, inhuman streams. “*Did you want us to play too?*”

Then came a sharper sting of pain, and I rolled my squeaking, near-frozen eyeballs towards the floor. Rolled them towards the horrifying sight of that woman digging her fingers, once again, into the back of my hand — *scooping* through to the other side, leaving a hole through my palm.

As I attempted to wail, producing only a near-silent gasp, the passenger shovelled the entire fleshy mound into her mouth and started to moan in ecstasy; moan with lips hanging open to reveal my mutilated quarter-pound of flesh melting on her tongue. I stared directly through the pristine tunnel bored through my hand; sealed with not an ounce of blood, but discoloured flesh. Flesh of soft consistency.

“Oh, you’re scrumptious, Flynn,” she mumbled whilst swirling my flesh around in her stuffed cheeks. “He’s going to want to put you on the top shelf. You just need a little more time to soften.”

Vomit bubbled to the top of my throat as I thought of the recognisable brand on The Vendor’s jacket. Thought of the countless sundaes I’d bought from that popular London chain throughout my life.

I wrestled to lift my shoe soles from the bus floor, then I began to scream, “YOU JUST LOST THE—”

But my lips shut of their own accord, and the woman’s face became very stern. Her lips started to straighten, and her wet munching began to slow — the bus began to slow. Once those lips had curled fully downwards, the vehicle came to a halt.

“You still want to play?” the woman whispered, lips twitching upwards into a smile, for a fleeting second, before sharply returning to a frown.

I preferred the grin. Something about it felt safer, somehow, than the frown. Than the possibility of this inhuman thing being *angry*. And then she waved a hand, bringing the bus doors open; bringing my feet, most importantly, back to life.

I pushed my unfrozen body out of the exit, finding myself at a bus stop two miles from home, then looked back at the bus as it drove away. Looked at the several passengers who were awake again; who were each looking at me with cloned faces of the blonde woman.

Most unnervingly, without group synchronicity, each passenger fluctuated between smiling and frowning; a wave of taunting, ever-changing faces. And their heads turned to follow me as the vehicle slowly pulled away.

“Was that the last bus of the night?” asked a timid voice from behind me.

I turned to see nobody, and there followed an awful gnaw in my gut as I peered around the edge of the bus shelter — peered into an alleyway to see walls made not of bricks, but gums. And not a dead end, but a white door standing open.

Within the blackened opening of that doorway, there stood a white-suited man, all lips, smiling at me.

He roared with laughter, lips barely parting a few centimetres, and the sound somehow carried loudly into that empty street. That thing and I seemed to be the only souls left in London.

Then The Vendor began to sprint towards me, arms remaining stiff and unmoving by his sides as his legs swung rapidly. I thought of skirting around the bus stop and manoeuvring past the horrifying thing. Thought of gunning towards the open white door and, hopefully, finding all I’d ever wanted.

*Winning is impossible*, the stranger told me.

Pursued by the haunting, lip-faced demon, I fled. Fled and screamed into the empty London streets for help, but none came. I saw his reflection in the pearlescent surfaces of parked cars and the reflective panes of bus stops. Heard his greedy chuckle following me.

And I felt my limbs turn to jelly. Felt myself *soften*.

I realised, of course, that there was only one other option.

When I reached my home, I turned to see the white-suited man strolling at unthinkable speed. I realised he could’ve caught me if he’d continued running. Given the large grin on his otherwise-featureless face, I understood that he was *relishing* in the chase.

In letting his future flavour soften.

I locked myself inside, drew all of the curtains, and ignored the banging on the front door. Ignored the giddy giggling as I began to type away. See, I found no souls out and about at that hour, but there are other ways to connect.

And this may just work.

You just lost The Sundae Game.

Well, you lost it the moment you read the title of this post. And, as I said, I’m sorry. So, so sorry. I’m just kicking the can down the road. I don’t know how to bring an end to this game; only how to end it for me.

Look, you might be okay. Maybe you’ll make it through the white door and be the first to win. Maybe, like the stranger and me, you’ll simply make it someone else’s problem.

I’m just sorry for those of you who are too kind-hearted to do what must be done. Those who, once soft and creamy enough, will be boxed upon The Vendor’s shelves, ready to be served to the fine citizens of London — or some other city, perhaps. Who knows how far this nightmare reaches?

Knowing what I know, I think it would be best to never eat ice cream [again](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
