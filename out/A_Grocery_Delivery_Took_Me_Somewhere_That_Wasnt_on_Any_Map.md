I started working for a local grocery delivery app last December in northern California—somewhere between Redding and the national forest, where small towns blend into redwoods and forgotten roads. The job was perfect for someone like me—introverted, broke, and needing flexible hours.

Most orders were within town limits. Easy. Drop the bags, snap a photo, move on. But the app had a program called GreenReach that offered bonuses for delivering to rural customers—elderly, off-grid types who couldn’t make the drive in winter.

That’s how I ended up accepting an order late one Tuesday night to a house I’d never heard of: 11751 Wren Hollow Lane.

Two bags—milk, bread, soup cans, tissues. Basic stuff. A $20 tip came attached before I even left the store. I hesitated. Wren Hollow didn’t ring any bells, and when I looked it up, the road wasn’t even marked on my map—just a narrow gray line between forest ridges.

But the money was good, and I told myself it’d probably just be an older couple living off the highway. I’d drop the stuff and be home in an hour.

I pulled out of town around 9:40 PM. The app’s turn-by-turn directions stopped working ten minutes in. I kept going based on the blue dot and my gut.

The road narrowed into a single lane lined with pine and redwood, twisting like something half-carved into the hillside. No lights. No driveways. Just thick trees pressing in, and the occasional flicker of moonlight off frost-covered branches.

By the time I found a rusted sign reading Wren Hollow, my signal was gone completely.

Still, the address was printed clearly on the paper bag tags, so I followed the road until my headlights picked up a house.

If you could call it that.

The structure was low, squat, and oddly sunken into the earth—like someone had pressed it into the hillside rather than built it. The siding was old, flaking, the windows boarded or completely black. Only the porch light glowed.

Everything else was silent.

I turned off my car and sat for a second, engine ticking as it cooled. Something about the air felt… wrong. Heavy. Like stepping into a room someone just left—but the scent and warmth still linger.

I grabbed the grocery bags and headed up the path.

There was no doorbell, just a single wooden door with a tarnished handle. I knocked once. Waited. Then again, louder.

Footsteps inside.

But they weren’t normal. Slow. Uneven. Like something dragging its feet in a wide circle.

Then a voice.

“Leave it.”

It came through the door—muffled, but distinct. Low. Almost staticky.

The name on the order was Karen Marks. This voice didn’t sound like a Karen. It sounded like someone gargling water in their throat. Male. Old. Off.

“I need a signature,” I said, lying. “It’s your first delivery through the app.”

The footsteps stopped.

Then, more of them. Four… no, five separate sets. Moving independently, circling each other, bumping into walls. Like someone dropped a box of wind-up toys in a quiet room.

“Leave it,” the voice said again. But this time… it didn’t come from the door.

It came from behind me.

I spun around, but no one was there. My breath fogged in the cold, and I could see my car just ten feet away.

But the driver’s door was open.

I was sure I’d shut it.

I took a step back toward the porch. The light above flickered. The door opened.

Just a crack.

I couldn’t see inside. Couldn’t smell anything. Couldn’t hear movement.

But the bags I’d left by the door—they were gone.

Swallowed by the dark.

I didn’t hear anyone take them.

Then, faintly, a whisper echoed through the woods.

“Come inside.”

I turned. And froze.

There was a figure standing in the tree line. Not in shadow, not hidden—just standing. Like it had been waiting there the whole time.

Tall. Pale. Wrapped in a black coat or tarp. It didn’t move. Didn’t blink.

And somehow… I could hear its breathing from across the yard.

My legs started moving before my brain caught up. I sprinted toward my car—but there was someone in the passenger seat. Slumped forward. Motionless.

I veered and ran toward the road instead, branches slapping my arms, lungs burning.

Behind me, I heard footsteps that didn’t match mine. Fast. Many.

And voices—my voice—screaming my name from different directions.

“Alex!”

“Alex, wait!”

“Come back inside!”

They all sounded like me. Same inflection. Same tone. Same panic.

But they were laughing.

I didn’t know where I was going. The trees closed in. The dark thickened. But I found a path—a narrow trail cutting through the brush. No lights. No markers.

But I kept running.

Then I tripped.

My phone flew from my pocket and skidded into the undergrowth. When I reached for it, the screen lit up with a message.

“Order accepted. Route recalculating…”

The app was still open.

And the map now showed a blinking red dot moving toward me.

Estimated time of arrival: NOW.

I killed the app. Pocketed the phone. Kept running.

Soon the trail opened into a clearing—if you could call it that. It was a wide, unnatural space filled with old junk. Rusted-out vans. Grocery bags. Tattered uniforms. Even a broken-down delivery bike half-buried in snow.

It wasn’t just my company.

It was all of them.

Amazon. FedEx. GrubHub. UPS.

All different brands, colors, logos—scattered like the aftermath of a delivery war.

Something moved behind a rusted van.

I ducked behind a dead tree, heart pounding. Then I saw it—one of the “things” from the house.

Close up, it looked like it had skin, but not its own. It was draped over the bones wrong—folded and creased like plastic wrap over wet meat. No face. Just a slit for a mouth and blank, white sockets.

It sniffed the air.

Then, without warning, it spoke in my voice again.

“Delivery complete.”

The others joined it. Five… six… maybe more.

They all looked similar. Like bad copies of bad copies. Some with torn clothes. Some barefoot. All of them moving like puppets on slack strings.

I stayed low. Waited for a gap. Then bolted through a break in the treeline.

They didn’t run after me.

They mimicked the sound of me running.

Exactly. Same pace. Same panicked gasps. Like they were rehearsing it.

I ran until I found a fire road—gravel crunching underfoot, moonlight reflecting off puddles. A white pickup rounded the bend, headlights sweeping the dark.

I flailed my arms.

The driver—a woman in her fifties—slammed the brakes and rolled her window down halfway.

“You okay?” she asked, eyes wide.

“No,” I gasped. “Please. I just—can you call the cops? There’s something back—there’s a house—”

Her face went pale.

“You saw the porch light, didn’t you?”

I froze.

She didn’t wait for an answer. “Get in.”

We drove ten minutes before I had enough breath to explain everything. She didn’t say much—just kept her eyes on the road, knuckles white on the wheel.

Eventually, she pulled over near a ranger station. Told me to go inside and report what I saw. Then she handed me something from her glove box.

A badge.

U.S. Forest Service.

She looked tired.

“We’ve been trying to get that address removed from the grid for years,” she said. “But it keeps showing up. Every time someone deletes it, it finds a new way in. Delivery apps, GPS databases, even USPS records.”

“But the house—” I started.

“Wasn’t always there,” she said. “But once you deliver to it… it remembers you.”

She didn’t say goodbye. Just turned the truck around and drove back the way we came.

I called my dispatcher. They had no record of the delivery. Claimed the tip must’ve been a glitch. The app removed the address after I sent a report. But I still get emails sometimes.

“New Order Available – Wren Hollow Lane.”

Always with a tip too good to be true.

Always marked time sensitive.

I don’t accept them.

But I wonder who will.
