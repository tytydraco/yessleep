I barely finished my breakfast before bolting out the door and running over to Mikey’s house.  Wrapping at his front door, I felt that queasy pit erode my nerves again.  I pushed it back with my selfish desire to get this over with.  Mikey’s dad greeted me at the door before ushering his son over.  Mikey timidly walked under the doorway. “Hi.”

“Hi,”  I responded, “you wanna come over?”

He stared at the brick landing, mulling it over as I fidgeted back and forth, barely able to contain myself.  

“Sure.”  He muttered finally.  I sighed in relief and gave him a quick, reassuring hug before leading him back to my house.  He warmed up as we walked.  I talked about how excited I was to show him my new “pet” and how even my parents don’t know about him yet.  I told him it would be a secret between the two of us and made him pinky swear he wouldn’t talk about anything he was about to see in my room.  We entered the house with a rekindled joy in each other’s company.  We giddily ran up the stairs to my bedroom after a dismissive hello to my mom as she cleaned the kitchen of the morning’s routine.  

Slamming the door behind us, I locked it, laughing as we shushed each other.  I finally showed him the space console I had hidden in my closet.  His face dropped, and a returning glum covered posture.  

“What’s wrong?” I asked.

“I heard about it from the others… they were talking about how they all got to see it last week…”  He replied, head down.  

Guilt seeped into my heart.  Mikey and I were always the closest in the neighborhood.  And I had shunned him from my excitement for a whole week.  A week he had spent hearing second-hand about how fun and cool my console was from the others.  

I finally felt remorse for my behavior and gave him an embarrassed apology.  “I’m sorry.  You should have been the first to see it…But you are the first to see my new pet!”  I said, hoping to win back his good graces.  

He perked up and a grin spread across his face, “Really? Awesome, where is it?”  

I zipped under the bed and pulled out the spacedog, holding him up in the air triumphantly.  After several Lion King jokes, I handed the dog to Mikey, who laughed.  The spacedog yipped happily, wagging its tail, as Mikey held it.  

It felt good laughing together again.  We sat petting the spandex dog, commenting on its weird skin and catching up on a week of being apart.  I was about to see if we could play fetch with it when I heard a creak on the steps outside my bedroom door.  I told him to shush the dog as I thought my mom was coming up the stairs.  He went to tuck it back under the bed before I could stop him.  

He had pulled the blanket up, revealing the flying saucer sitting under my bed.  I froze, waiting for a reaction from either him or the starman, who was not in sight.  Mikey turned to me, “Is this from the crater?”  

I knew he had to see it sooner or later; I had just hoped to prepare a little better.

 “Yeah, I nabbed it when I went for my pack.”  I lied.  

He looked for a second before looking down at the dog in his arms.  I felt a surge of fear as I saw he was putting the dots together.  I tried to cut off any questions by moving the conversation on, “Do you wanna see it? I like to get under the bed and look at it.  You should try it.” Another, more pathetic, lie.  My heart began racing.  Obscure anxiety coated my brain.  I did not see the starman, but I figured the sooner Mikey was under the bed, the sooner this would be over with.  

Mikey replied finally, “Uh… what about the radiation?”  

My mind burned as I tried to think of a way to blow off my initial lie about the saucer, “It's uh… It's low… I think it's fine.  It's been under my bed for a week and I haven’t grown any extra limbs or nothing.”

He looked unconvinced as he shuffled away from my bed, putting the dog down.  I remember glancing at the spacedog while my mind churned.  It was quiet.  It just stood still and mute.  It was watching us.  

My attention returned to Mikey, who began to get up from the floor, “I think I should leave.  I don’t feel good.”  He said, hands gripping his shirt.  

I stood up, “No! Come on, please just check it out, I promise its ok!  I’ll go first and show you it's ok to get close to!”  I desperately crawled under the bed, holding the blanket curtain up to reveal the docile saucer.  

He took another step toward the door, “Ima go home now.  Thanks for showing me the dog.”

I got out and ran to the door.  I stood, arms outstretched, “No, I want you to look.” Was all I could muster.

Poor Mikey.  He was flustered, clearly conflicted.  I saw it hurt him to upset me.  He must have felt it too, then.  That vague feeling of wrong.  That he shouldn’t have seen what he did.  He stood there helplessly fidgeting with the hem of his shirt.  “I wanna go.”  He looked at the floor.  

Now I remember why I suppressed so many of these memories.  I was awful.  Being a kid is no excuse to me, I was… I am awful.  I grabbed Mikey by his shoulders and tried dragging him over to my bed.  Shock stunned him for a moment, but then he saw the bed and began resisting.  We wrestled on the ground for a couple of seconds, muffled grunts as I tried dragging him over, all while covering his mouth to keep him from screaming for my parents.  He flailed widely, kicking and dragging his feet.  Looking back on it, he never hit me.  With every step closer to the bed, his panic increased, but he never struck me.  I didn’t deserve a friend like Mikey.  

With a shove, I crammed his head under the bed.  A piercing yell was now freely able to escape his mouth.  It was cut short.  With a sudden jolt of his body, he went quiet.  I stood over him, his lower half sticking out from under the bed.  Then I saw the green light turn on.  A soft humming began.  I stared at Mikey’s limp half, expecting the starman to walk out and explain that Mikey had hit his head or something and was knocked out cold.  My thoughts were cut short by the hurried footsteps of a concerned parent marching up the stairs.  

I bolted to the door, pulling it open and slamming it behind me.  I guarded my bedroom as I was greeted by my mom, a clear face of concern painted on her.  “Was that Mikey?”  She questioned.

“Yeah, sorry, I threw a Lego at him while we were playing, and it hit his eye.  He doesn’t want to be seen crying, so I’m guarding the door.  He’s ok, just cranky.”  I lied through a reassuring smile.  

She stood at the top of the stairway now, “Does he need ice?”  

Happy for a reason to make her leave, I replied, “Yes, please! I think it was swelling a little.”

The look of her face assured me that a scolding was coming later, but she scurried back downstairs to fill a bag with ice.  

I returned to the room, anxious for Mikey to wake up from whatever trance he was in.  I crouched down and patted his back, “Mikey, are you ok?”  

“He’s fine.”  the starman echoed from below the bed.  The spacedog slipped under the bed at the sound of his voice.  

Before I could protest further, Mikey seemingly returned to life.  He groggily pulled his head out from under the bed.  He swayed, hands on his forehead, as he stood up and leaned against my bed.  Fully expecting him to hate me and leave after harsh words, I began, “I am really sorry, it just needed something simple to re-fue-”

“What happened?”  He cut me off.

“Huh?”

“What happened? When did we get to your place?”

“Uh… maybe an hour ago?”  I replied.

“...Ok.  My head hurts.  Do you mind if I go home?”

I stood mouth agape as he stumbled over to the door.  My mom entered, almost ramming into Mikey, “Oop, so sorry, sweety.” She said,  “Here, let me see your eye.” 

“My head hurts.” Was all Mikey said in response.

I interjected, “Uh, I think I must have hit his head more than his eye.”  I said, hoping that would cover my bases.

My mom shot me an impatient look of disapproval as she began escorting my closest friend out of my room, “Come on, sweety, let me put some ice on your head and take you home.”

I numbly waved goodbye to Mikey, and he blurrily waved back, eyes vacant.  Before the door closed, I saw it.  I know I saw it, and I didn’t understand it at the time, but I sure as hell do now.  As my mom closed the door, I watched Mikey turn to leave.  I witnessed it through the last crack of the door before it shut.  Blood leaked out of his ear.  And hidden in his hair just above that ear, dangled a little antenna.  It's red ball blinking softly.  It retracted into his skull.  The door shut.
