The restaurant buzzed with life, yet somehow there was no scent in the air to prefer, as if someone had erased that part of reality. The man sitting across from me watched quietly, waiting for me to pick up the strangely intense conversation we were both forcing ourselves through.

My attention drifted, and out of the corner of my eye I noticed something impossible. A messy, unmade bed sitting right in the middle of the lobby. The staff stepped over it with practiced ease, balancing trays piled with lobster and steak for the prestigious guests who all looked like my classmates.

That’s when it hit me, I was dreaming.

I turned back to my date, expecting a familiar face to snap into focus. But when I met his gaze, there were no eyes to meet. I stared harder, trying to force the shapes to form, but it was like my brain refused to render them — a blank space where something important should have been. Where a soul should have been.

I pinch myself and the absence of pain shooting to the curve of my finger, confirms my suspicion and I subconsciously say, “I’m dreaming.” Silence. Pure, unbothered silence. I couldn't see his eyes, but I felt anger. The emotion was thrown over me like a weighted blanket. His voice first came with a forced calmness, like someone trying to tame an angry dog.

“Please don't leave.” He starts to get antsy. “Don't leave me.” Then the deafening silence is broken when he starts to wail pleas and profanities at me standing up at his chair knocking the assortment of untouched food. “DON”T YOU DARE LEAVE ME BITC-”

I woke up. My fingers gripping the sweat soaked blanket clinging to every inch of my body. My chest falls up and down in a rapid, motion as I sit up wrapping my arms around my chest, soothing my shaking body. My entire leg was numb and I rip away from my imprint on the bed and yanked the lamp tassel down the light engulfing my room. I did not sleep for the rest of the night. 

I have developed chronic insomnia. Tossing and turning, my brain is in constant activity. The temperature is never perfect. It was either too hot or too cold and my clothes were always uncomfortable. I tried everything, therapy, medication, diet changes, but I could never achieve a perfect night's sleep.

Though when my body does show me mercy I only see him. Never his eyes, just him. It stood like a mannequin, just flesh, no soul. His lips always curved up, taunting me. It was like he was punishing me for leaving the date. 

Though one day the setting changed. I was sitting in the same restaurant, the luxurious setting coming in the focus, the lack of smell reeked of familiarity. The seat across from me starved of a presence. Then suddenly a man appeared and my mouth moved without thinking, as a started a typical first date conversation. As I spoke to him I realized this is the longest I’ve slept in months, I was desperate for a time like this and I was not going to pass up this opportunity. So when he started looking around and shifting in his seat I got nervous, and then when he started looking at the other restaurant tenets with familiarity. I got agitated. Then when he turned to me and said

“I think I am dreaming.” I got angry. So when he started to disappear I knew that meant that this perfect sleep would be tarnished.



“Wait, don't leave.” I got up and my feet felt heavy. “Please do not leave.” I started to melt into the ground; it was almost like my voice held no significance in this realm. “YOU BETTER NOT LEAVE ME.”
