An introduction...

 

I’ve sat staring at this blank page for hours, wondering what to say and how to say it. My dad was the writer, not me. At least he wanted to be. Life got in the way of that. Me and my little brother Sam came along. He put all that on hold for us, didn’t even talk about it most days. Just another dream dashed due to circumstance.

 

He died last month. I don’t know if it made it better or worse that we all knew it was coming. Even still, it didn’t hit me for a long time that he was really gone. It only hit when I had to go through his things. Those little things that sat in the same spot for my whole life, now taken away to be repurposed. In their place, just a little shape cut out from the dust - waiting to be filled in. There was no money, no inheritance, and few noteworthy possessions. Unsurprising, as we never had much to begin with. All that’s really left of him is in our memories. That, and this book.

 

I found it amongst his things, a big stack of papers. A whole completed novella, but never published. I knew he wrote about what happened, but I never knew he finished it, and I never saw a page of what he wrote.

 

Much of what happened back in the winter of 2015 was lost on me. I knew lots of pieces, but they never fit together, and dad wouldn’t talk about them. I knew about the basement – I saw it. I knew about the voices – I heard them. I remember being afraid. I remember The Sharp Man. I remember when Sam disappeared. But how it ended? That I never knew.

 

After 10 years your brain tries to coat those memories with rationales. I did my best. I almost convinced myself it was all explainable. Then this stack of papers got in my hands.

 

It was a while before I sat down and read it. I couldn’t bear a snapshot into a life that didn’t exist anymore. But given everything that happened, I knew I had to. For my answers and, more importantly, for his memory.

 

That’s also why I’m sharing this with you now. I don’t want what happened to be forgotten, like so much else has.

 

CHAPTER 1: The Basement

 

I’ve lived in this house for 17 years more or less. Steph and I moved in while she was pregnant with our daughter Madison, and five years ago we added Sammy to the mix. Steph left not long after – not dead, just gone – so its been the three of us here for the past four and a half years.

 

It’s rugged, it’s small, it’s out in the middle of nowhere, but it’s ours. Our driveway lies amongst a dense line of trees, easy to miss, off a long dirt road. The nearest neighbour is a 30 minute hike down that road. I’ve never met them. Even more trees surround our property. The woods behind our house stretches on for kilometers. Our own little slice of wilderness.

 

Entering the house you’d be faced with the living room, with the kitchen and dining area behind it, fairly open concept. All of the rooms - the three bedrooms, single bathroom, and door to the basement - lie tucked away in a long, narrow 7-shaped hallway beginning at the far end of the right wall. And that’s it, that’s our house.

 

We keep up with it okay, we do what we have to, we can even make it look presentable sometimes – which is where the basement comes in.

 

Our basement was unfinished. There was really nothing to it. Just a big open space with a cold concrete floor. Wooden beams and insulation pattern the walls and ceilings. It was freezing, it smelled, it was dark, and we just didn’t go down there much. It became a place to haphazardly store all the stuff we weren’t using but didn’t want to get rid of.

 

I thought about getting it finished, but I never had the money. Now I didn’t have the money or the time. The two of us raising one kid was hard; me raising two kids alone was objectively impossible. But that’s what you do when you’re a parent. You hurt, you cry, you reach your limit, you go insane, and then you do it.

 

Things were going okay. Maddy was all grown up, independent and doing well; and Sammy was developing into an actual human being and not just a screaming badger. Because of this I was able to work more hours and not have to budget for a babysitter. Our lives were never easy, but we were in a nice period of calm and relative stability. Something I didn’t know I could value this much. That soon started to change.

 

I didn’t believe in ghosts. I didn’t believe in demons or haunted houses, and in the 17 years I lived here, I was never challenged on that. The house creaked, like any old house. There were noises, but none that wouldn’t be expected from living so close to the woods. We got critters, not ghosts. I doubt we would even be able to hear anything a ghost would do over the cicadas.

 

Winter was different though. All those noises went away. It could be eerie, the silence of it. When the wind was calm, when it was late at night, you could hear a pin drop. I chose to find it peaceful. But this winter, the winter of 2015, had other plans.

 

I can’t remember when it really first started. Like a lot of these tales, it began with a whisper. Little oddities, forgotten almost as soon as they occurred because they didn’t merit additional thought. I had more pressing concerns. Work, bills, food, fixing the pipes, fixing my brakes, keeping Sammy away from sharp objects, and generally surviving the brutal Canadian winter - that and the hundred other things on my plate were more than enough to keep my mind occupied. If a door was closed when it should have been opened, I paid it no mind, I simply opened the door.

 

That doesn’t mean I didn’t notice it, though. When it was 2 am and I saw someone that looked like Sammy run past my door, only to check and find him still asleep in bed... I noticed that. I remembered that.

 

When I washed my hands in the bathroom sink and a little shard of the mirror dropped into the basin and down the drain, only for me to look at the mirror and see no missing piece whatsoever... I noticed that.

 

When I turned the corner into that long, dark hallway and I swore I saw the figure of a man standing in the shadows at the very end, only for him to be gone when I turned the light on... I definitely remembered that.

 

But I didn’t think there was a ghost. It was a trick of the shadows. It was my exhaustion. It was nothing. I lived in this house for 17 years and nothing has ever happened, why would there be a “haunting” now? How can a house just suddenly BECOME haunted?

 

Well, I would get my answer soon enough, along with so many more questions... Two days later, Friday night. The night I couldn’t pass it off anymore.

 

I got home from work at around 7. It was deep into the cold months now so it was well after dark – and ‘dark’ where we live is DARK. No light pollution, no bustling night life, barely even street lamps. You can’t even see the trees in the woods, it’s just black on black. You can see the stars though, that’s why we moved here.

 

The cold was ruthlessly brisk against my face. The snow was beginning to pile up and I was praying that it would stop soon. So many exhausting hours wasted shovelling this damn driveway already, I didn’t want to go through it again this soon.

 

I futzed with my keys in the dark and opened the door, happy to feel the moderate warmth. After that time our heater broke two winters ago, I still get a little nervous every now and then. Safe for the moment, though. I could also smell the cold pizza Maddy ordered. That is usually the scene. Maddy cooks sometimes, and I cook on weekends, but for the most part I just give her some money and she orders whatever for the two of them and I eat what’s left.

 

“Left side has mushrooms.” Maddy’s voice called out from her room down the hall.

 

“Gross.” I replied.

 

I walked over to the kitchen and opened the box to grab a fungus-less slice, but then I heard her call out again.

 

“Oh – by the way, what did you do to the basement door?”

 

“What do you mean?” I closed the box and walked into the narrow hallway. Maddy was standing in her doorway.

 

“Did you repaint it or something?” She asked.

 

I scrunched my brow, “Why the hell would I repaint a door?”

 

“Well…” Maddy responded then led me further down the hall to the basement door. “Look at it.”

 

I scanned the door briefly, “It looks the same.”

 

“No it doesn’t, look. It used to be all scuffed up around the knob, right? And there was that big scratch from when I let Sammy have the umbrella.”

 

I looked to the door again… She was right. There were no marks. It didn’t look freshly painted though; in some ways it looked older. It was still worn, just worn in different ways.

 

“What the fuck?” I responded incredulously.

 

“Bad word, dad.” Said Sammy, now joining the conversation and giving me a hug.

 

“How’s it goin’ Sammy?” I greeted, while not taking my eyes off the door.

 

“Good. I’m bisexual.” Sammy responded.

 

Immediately I looked at Maddy who was snickering.

 

“I can explain.” Maddy muttered through her laughter.

 

“Why? Why did you do this?” I asked, exaggerating my exhaustion.

 

“He heard me on the phone! He asked what it meant. I told him it’s when you like guys and girls, that’s it! And then he just started saying it!” Maddy explained.

 

“I’m bisexual.” Sammy repeated.

 

“Sammy you’re not bisexual.” I stated, wearily.

 

“Yes I am!”

 

“I mean he might be.” Maddy interjected.

 

“He’s five.” I rebuked.

 

“Everyone’s journey is different.” Maddy said, still snickering.

 

I rubbed my temples and let out a deep sigh “Okay buddy, you’re bisexual. Just don’t say it at school, okay? I don’t want more phone calls... Maddy, what the hell happened to the door?”

 

“I don’t know, I was asking you!”

 

“Did you open it?” I asked, seeing that as the next logical course of action.

 

“No, not yet.”

 

I gingerly grasped the doorknob and began to turn it... it instantly felt different… Every door has a unique feeling to it. A specific smoothness and level of resistance when you turn the knob and pull it open. This door used to be snug, it used to take a bit of force but now… it was buttery smooth.

 

“…This is a completely different door.” I said in disbelief. “No one came over or anything today, right?”

 

“It could’ve been while we were at school?” Maddy hypothesized.

 

“Why would someone break into our house and replace one door – it’s just this door right?”

 

“Yeah, I think so.” Maddy answered.

 

“Someone broke in?” Asked Sammy. I almost forgot he was listening.

 

“No, no, of course not.” I said, only to quell his fears. I stood pondering for a minute before I continued. “I’m gonna go down there and see if there’s anything weird.”

 

“I’ll come!” Sammy offered enthusiastically.

 

“No Sammy, stay up here with your sister.” I answered. As I looked over, I noticed Maddy was already holding his arm so he didn’t run ahead as I opened the door.

 

As I looked back, I was met with the pitch black abyss. I could only see about three steps down before they were engulfed. Unfortunately, the only light switch was at the bottom but I knew these stairs well enough.

 

I made my way down, unsure of what I expected to find. The stairs creaked and I was faced with utter blackness. I almost lost my balance on the last step as I miscounted the number of stairs, but I recovered.

 

I blindly reached for the light switch on the right wall. I missed at first, I figured my muscle memory was thrown off, but I reached a little bit further and found them. I flicked the switch up and… nothing. Still pitch black. I flicked the switch up and down a few more times, no luck.

 

“Light’s not working.” I called up. “Grab the flashlight for me?”

 

I heard two sets of footsteps walk away. Suddenly I felt a bit of unease creeping in. I couldn’t put my finger on it though. Something just felt off. Like I’m not supposed to be here. The cold began to give me goosebumps and the smell… It was worse than usual.

 

“Got it!” Maddy called down, startling me out of that weird headspace.

 

“Toss it down.” I said, turning and cupping my hands.

 

I could just barely see the silhouette of the flashlight coming down against the upstairs light, but I was able to catch it.

 

I turned back to the curtain of blackness and clicked on the button. The beam shot out and I gasped. Louder than I was expecting to.

 

“What is it!?” Maddy called down, clearly noticing the alarm in my voice.

 

“What the f-“ I stopped myself, less because I was concerned about swearing and more because my voice was taken away.

 

“All our shit’s gone!” I eventually exclaimed. I moved the flashlight all around and, sure enough, the basement was completely empty. All those years of clutter were gone, it was just bare wooden studs and insulation all around. The floor, a completely barren concrete slab. Nothing was left.

 

“What do you mean?” Maddy asked. I started to hear footsteps creaking down the stairs. I turned and ushered them back upstairs along with myself.

 

“Don’t come down here right now. I’m gonna… I’m calling 911.” I said, trying to remain calm as I reached the top of the stairs and closed the door behind me.

 

“What happened? Are we gonna die?” Sammy asked.

 

“What? No. Jesus Christ, Sammy. We’re fine. Just… chill. Maddy, take him and go to your room.”

 

“Okay, but what do you mean it’s all gone? That doesn’t make sense.” Maddy asked incredulously.

 

I struggled to explain it any better, “It’s all gone. Literally all of it. I don’t know. Someone just… I don’t know.”

 

Maddy continued, attempting to wrap her brain around it. “Someone… took all our old junk? Didn’t feel like taking the TV or the computers or anything?”

 

“Yeah? Maybe? I don’t know what to tell you, I guess... they were pretty stupid. Still though, just stay in your room for now. Double check nothing else was taken and… don’t teach Sammy any new words, please.”

 

“Uh, Sure… Alright Sammy, let’s go play in my room. We can explore your identity further.” Maddy said as she walked him away.

 

I tried to keep things light and not let on the gravity of the situation. I didn’t want them to worry or panic. I wanted to manage this as much as I could. If I could make the kids believe it was just some idiot and they have nothing to worry about, that’s what I would do.

 

But I didn’t think that was the case. Sure, what they did was peculiar, but they still got in and out without a trace. They knew when we wouldn’t be home. They covered their tracks. There was a method to this.

 

I called the police. I knew there wasn’t much they could do. I honestly didn’t care about recovering all our stuff. Like Maddy said, it was all junk. 90% of it wouldn’t be missed. I just needed them to make sure we were safe.

 

While I waited for someone to arrive, I checked all the windows and doors. We’re a small, single floor house, so there’s not that many points of entry. Everything was locked up as it should be. I also managed to squeeze in a slice of cold pizza while I looked.

 

There was a spare key under a rock on the walkway for the kids since I’m not always around, that was the only explanation I could think of. If this person was watching us, then they might have seen the kids use it… That thought deeply unsettled me.

 

A single officer showed up at the door. Predictably, he didn’t give much in the way of answers or solutions. He seemed as perplexed as I did. He checked out the basement a little bit, checked the windows and doors, took a little walk around the perimeter, then said to call if anything else happened.

 

That was about what I expected, but it put my mind a little at ease that he didn’t turn up anything alarming. He said the house seemed to be secure. So I just won’t do the spare key thing anymore.

 

He left and I went back to check in on the kids. Sammy was asleep in Maddy’s bed and she was sitting up next to him scrolling on her phone. It made me both proud and sad to see Maddy be so good with her brother like that. She was truly a great kid. She always stepped up. I just wish she didn’t have to.

 

“He’s out, huh?” I said quietly.

 

“Yup. I used his dragon book. Always works.” Maddy replied.

 

“Alright I’ll get him outta your hair.” I said, walking over and picking up his limp 40 pound frame.

 

“So what happened? What are they gonna do?” She asked.

 

“Uh. Nothing… But hey, if anything this guy did us a favor - clearing that basement out.”

 

“I bet it was mom, coming back to get an old dress for a date or something. Then covering her tracks by taking everything else.” She barbed.

 

I laughed, “That would be interesting. I heard she was in Hawaii though, with her second family.”

 

“Really? I thought it was Cancun.”

 

“No that’s her third family.”

 

“Wow, how many families does she have again?”

 

“I don’t know but she is VERY happy. She sends me voicemails specifically telling me how much she loves all her other kids more than you.”

 

“Oh good for her!”

 

“I know right? You love to see it. You love to see people thrive.” I joked as I walked out with Sammy.

 

I acknowledge that this was maybe not the healthiest coping mechanism to impart upon a child whose mother left her, but sometimes you just have to make fun where you can. There’s only so much you can let it hurt, and it hurt for a long time. In reality, she wasn’t a bad person. We both knew that, deep down. It was just easier to pretend that she was, and make a game of it.

 

“Are we safe though?” Maddy asked, with a seriousness returning to her tone.

 

“Yeah. We’re safe. We’re locked up tight. I got rid of the spare key just in case… We’re good. I imagine they got whatever they were looking for anyway.” I still tried my best to sound convincingly nonchalant.

 

I put Sammy to bed, not bothering to be super delicate. That kid could sleep through Armageddon. Then I went to bed myself, indulging my ritual of watching an hour or two of TV on my old 90s box before passing out. I always liked the classic tube TVs, so when we finally upgraded our living room one to a slim fella, I kept the old one for me.

 

The TV provided a decent distraction for a while, but I couldn’t help thinking about all the weirdness of today. Nevermind the past week. I could deny it to the kids, but I couldn’t deny it to myself that I was spooked. Every now and then I’d mute the TV, thinking I heard something that was clearly just the house settling. I just had this feeling deep in my gut that something was very wrong, and that this wasn’t over…

 

Sleep didn’t come easy that night, I habitually checked on the kids at least half a dozen times and quadruple checked the locks. Eventually I allowed myself to calm down and drift off to sleep. I wish it lasted. Unfortunately, the night wasn’t done with me.

 

I woke up around 3 am to the sound of the phone ringing. Not my cellphone but, our landline out in the living room. Yeah, we still had a landline. Cell reception out here was spotty sometimes so it helped, but it very rarely got any use anymore. I can’t remember the last time I heard it ring. I don’t even know how many people still had the number. Let alone who would have the number that would call this late at night.

 

I hesitantly walked over and picked it up, instantly overcome by the loud sounds of audio distortion and crackling.

 

“Hello?” I asked quietly. “Who is this?”

 

There was no immediate response amidst the noise, so I gave it one more, loader attempt.

 

“Hello?”

 

After about 20 seconds of dead air, an old and sickly voice simply uttered:

 

“I remember.”

 

Then the call cut off. I stood there in the dark, petrified, listening to the dial tone. What the hell did that mean? Was this a threat? Was this the person who robbed us? I thought maybe it was at first, but when I really analyzed the voice... it didn’t seem right. They sounded bad. They sounded like they were on death’s door. And the way they said it... It didn’t sound threatening. It didn’t even sound like they were talking to me.

 

I had no idea what to make of it. I chalked it up to a wrong number but the timing of it was just... too freaky. I had an even harder time getting back to sleep after that. It was a race to fall asleep before the sun rose. I just barely was able to.

 

Most Saturdays would begin with Sammy waking me up unceremoniously at around 6 or 7 am for one thing or another. These days he at least whispers instead of screaming and jumping on my chest. This morning though, no Sammy. I woke up by myself around 8:30. I couldn’t help but feel relieved. It’s exceptionally rare that my sleep gets to end naturally, so I decided to savor it… Until a thought crept into my head.

 

Everything from the night before was lagging behind my consciousness, but it all came back to me in a rush. Sammy didn’t always wake me up, but for him to not wake me up today… I had to go check on him.

 

I rushed out of bed and down the hallway. I peeked into Maddy’s room. She was there. Good. One sigh of relief. Then I reached Sammy’s room and…

 

Gone.

 

I felt the urge to panic but I talked myself down. He could be up playing in the living room or something. So I moved quickly to the living room but still no Sammy.

 

I moved to the bathroom. No Sammy. I went to the kitchen. I double checked Maddy’s room. I double checked my room. I looked in the front yard. The back yard. The damn linen closet… Nothing.

 

My heart raced. I couldn’t breathe. Fear and guilt swirled like a hurricane in my head. Why did I let him sleep alone after all this? Why didn’t I keep watch all night? No, this can’t be happening…

 

Then it hit me… One place I forgot to check. The basement.

 

A chill ran down my spine as I thought of it. But why though? Why would this thought fill me with dread? It was just our basement. I couldn’t understand it.

 

I walked to the basement door, with its subtle unfamiliarities. The knob turned easy and the door gave no resistance. Like it was begging to be opened.

 

This time, the basement wasn’t a pitch black void. The early morning sun shone its light through the small window on the far end and generously illuminated the space I was descending into.

 

I could see all the stairs now and yet even so, I still almost tripped at the end. That was odd, but I couldn’t dwell on it. In the middle of the grey concrete, I saw my boy lying there on his side in his jammies. I was so relieved, I wanted to rush over and squeeze the life out of him, but I resisted the impulse and instead gently lifted his face off the cold floor. He began to stir as I did.

 

“Dad?” He muttered weakly.

 

I breathed one more sigh of relief. “Holy shit Sammy, you scared me to death. What are you doing here?”

 

“Bad word.” He responded.

 

“I know. I’m working on it, I really am.”

 

“Where am I?”

 

“You’re… In the basement, buddy. You don’t remember coming down here?”

 

“No… But I was dreaming about it I think…”

 

That answer creeped me out a little bit, Sammy had never sleepwalked before. “God you’re a weird kid. Okay let’s get you out of here, it’s freezing. You could have frozen your damn face off on his concrete.”

 

I hoisted Sammy up and put him on my back and started to walk out… But then I began to really take in my surroundings. This was the first time I could actually see the basement in decent enough light since the incident and it was… wrong.

 

The stairs... I didn’t miscount them. There were one too many. The light switch really was a few inches further from the corner than it should be. Not only that: the wooden beams across the ceiling, the studs across the walls, they were spaced a little too far apart. The insulation, the pipes, the wiring, it all looked off. Even the ceiling hung ever so slightly higher.

 

It wasn’t just the door that was different now... Everything was different.

 

This... was not our basement.
