"The Prince Charming"

These words have fascinated me since I was little.

Fueled by Disney movies where the prince is always handsome, attractive, and brave, someone who always takes care of his appearance, I dreamed that one day I would meet my own Prince Charming, and together we would live happily ever after.

This dream was supported by my parents, who constantly told me phrases like, "One day you'll meet your Prince Charming," and sometimes they would say this when I was going through a breakup.

But all of that changed when I met Charlie.

When I went out with Charlie for the first time, I immediately knew he was the one for me. He was my Prince Charming.

His voice, his face, his gentlemanly manners, and his body… A lean, athletic, perfect body. He was a sportsman, and it showed in every part of him.

He was the most handsome guy I had ever met in my university life. And now, after three years together, I can proudly say we’re still a couple.

But everything changed when he moved in with me and my parents. Charlie began neglecting his appearance. His once shiny, golden hair—so soft to the touch—became dry and filthy. His sparkling blue eyes, like diamonds, now looked hollow, surrounded by dark circles that made them seem like empty sockets.

His flawless, snow-white skin turned yellowish and pale, riddled with imperfections. And his smell… oh, his smell… It was unbearable, like something rotting.

Each day, things got worse. My parents noticed it, too, but I reassured them it was just a rough patch, maybe depression from leaving his home. I truly believed we could fix things.

I was so naive.

When I tried to get close to him one night, seeking intimacy, I noticed something that made my skin crawl. White maggots fell to the floor as I helped him take off his shirt. Then I saw it—his body, the body I had once adored, was full of holes, cavities where insects crawled freely. His skin oozed fluids, dripping from his decaying flesh.

I cried. I cried harder than I ever had, confronted with the reality of what had become of Charlie and our relationship. Through my sobs, I screamed:

“Why, Charlie? Why did you let yourself go? Is it because you don’t love me anymore?”

But there was no response. Charlie just lay on my bed, silent, unmoving, not even looking at me.

My cries woke my parents. They entered my room and found me in tears. I told them Charlie didn’t love me anymore, that something had changed. And, like they always do when boys no longer want to stay with me, they took care of it.

Without a word, they carried Charlie to the car, loaded him into the trunk, and drove to the nearby woods. I stayed on the couch, sobbing, waiting for them to return.

When they came back the next morning, my father gave me a look of pity before heading upstairs to put on his sheriff’s uniform. My mother sat beside me, wrapping me in her arms.

“That’s just how boys are, sweetheart. Don’t worry. You’ll meet your real Prince Charming soon,” she whispered gently.

Later, my father came downstairs, fully dressed for work. He hugged me before leaving.

“Don’t worry,” he said with a calm smile. “One day, you’ll find the right one.”

Now, I can only hope they’re right. Maybe someday I’ll meet someone just as handsome as Charlie… only someone who won’t neglect their appearance over time.
