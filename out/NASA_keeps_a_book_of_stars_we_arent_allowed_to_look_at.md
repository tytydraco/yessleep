I've always been interested in astrology. Not necessarily the equations and procedures of launching rockets into the sky, or the tall green men supposedly camping on mars. No, my enjoyment of the stars began on my 10th birthday, when my grandfather handed me down an old, antique brass telescope that he had used as a boy. He was an astronaut in his youth. He never reached the stars or broke from the Earth, but he looked up at the same sky I did.I dreamt each night of everything just out of sight, the hypothetical planets not yet discovered. At some point, the fridge was covered in a layer of crayon drawings. Each one was a different planet I made up. One was entirely green, a thick layer of grass over the sphere like a blanket. One was a deep blue, composed only of water held in perfect waves. A large, poorly drawn whale took up the center.

One Christmas, when my grandparents visited, my grandfather took notice. He commented on how large my imagination was, and gave me his telescope that year. I raced out of the house, barefoot in the cold snow to set it up. It creaked as I opened the support stands and propped them up behind the house, against our fence. I shoved an eye into the looking glass, only to be blinded by the golden sunrays high in the sky. I probably wouldn't see that much in the daylight.

After dinner, I ran out again, now that the sky was dark. Stars scattered the sky like pinpricks made with a needle against black cardboard. This time, I was reluctantly bundled up in a thick coat and a handknitted scarf. That was my grandmother's present for me.

I stood on my tippy toes once more, looking into the slightly smudged glass of the eyepiece.

The moon took up the majority of my scope, blocking me from seeing the smaller stars. I shifted the telescope slightly, away from the moon and to the North. Now I could see each tiny, glowing sprinkle. I spotted the pole star, following its descending loop into the little dipper. I never thought it looked like a ladle, more like a funny hat. I always pretended that some atmospheric giant ran across the sky, hiding behind the sun and waiting to wear it once it became night.

I pivoted the telescope tripod once more, a little further East, still avoiding the moon's overwhelming presence and ignoring the Big Dipper. This time, I spotted something I didn't recognize. It was a constellation, stars jumbled closely together in an unusual shape. I always paid attention in science class, and could name every star alphabetically. From Perseus to Draco, Libra to Lupus. But this one- I didn't understand. It was a sort of concentric swirl, like a snake coiled and ready to pounce. I pressed my face closer into the glass, trying to absorb the entire image. 

Later that night, after my mother tucked me in, I quietly sat up. I reached for the pack of crayons under my pillow, grabbed a discarded piece of wrapping paper, and drew the recollection. It didn't look fantastic, but it felt accurate.

I showed my family in the morning, and was given mild praise. My mother was giddy, snatching it from my hands to hold it under the light and gawk at it further. My grandfather was silent, picking at a plate of scrambled eggs. He and my grandmother had already planned to drive back home that evening, but my grandfather was in a sudden rush. He put on his coat and took my grandmother's hand, making up some excuse about “leaving before the roads froze over”. It wasn't even snowing.

My mom told me not to worry about it, that grandpa's arthritis must have been acting up in the cold weather. She put my constellation drawing on the fridge, high above the other pretend planets. 

Fast forward to the present. I'm thirty now, and my grandparents passed away simultaneously within the same month. They were old, achy and groaning with old age. I hadn't visited them in a few years, and moved too far away to make the eight hour drive regularly. That's what I told myself at least, in all honesty, I just didn't want to be reminded of their withering bodies and my own mortality. I didn't even go to the funeral, made up some contradicting work excuse and apologized to my mother for not supporting her more. She was still the same understanding and loving woman as she had always been, living quietly in a retirement village back in my hometown. 

I was surprised when I got a call from the family lawyer about my grandfather's will. We hadn't been very close in the end, so I didn't expect to get anything. The man said simply I had been left an old journal of his and that it would be privately sent through the mail, at his last request. I waited anxiously for the next week, expecting some old leather bound journal, maybe recounting his life, maybe ramblings of a dementia patient. 

That's right, I remember now. I stopped going to visit them because he had practically forgotten who I was. The last time I had seen him he had just waved me off and told me he wasn't interested in whatever I was selling. 

The journal arrived late in the morning, around noon. I signed for the package and thanked the courier before I took it inside and sat down on my sofa.

Peeling away at the thick layer of tape, I opened the box. The contents were wrapped in thick layers of protective parchment paper, and I was almost expecting some sort of glass to be beneath. I pulled out a thick, hardcover book. It was black and covered in a sheen of dust I blew away with a few coughs. 

A few doodles of cartoonish planets and stars were on the front in white stencil markers, faded but still visible. I opened the book and relished in the vintage paper smell for a moment.

The first page was yellowed with age, and written in the center was “June 28th, 1956.”
He must've been only a teenager when he wrote it, when he was studying astrology but not quite a professional. I flipped to the next page.

My heart jumped like I had been electrocuted.

In an unsteady sketch, was the exact constellation I had seen. It was better drawn than mine, with neat lines and crisp corners. But it was my constellation, the same tornado of stars winding into a snake's tail. Beneath it was this:

“Constellation Viper. Don't let them fool you. I swear to God it's real.”
