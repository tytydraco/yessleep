Yesterday evening, a tornado hit my small town. I wish I had been better prepared. I’ve lived here my whole life, and at this time of year we receive tornado alerts practically every week, without one ever happening. My only real option in case of an actual emergency is to hide in my bathroom and wait it out, which seems like a great plan until you’re caught in the middle of a category 5 cyclone. 

The sight of the room around me being torn up and whisked away while I desperately fought the pull is one that I know I will never forget.

Yesterday afternoon, I had a strange encounter immediately before the tornado watch started. I was shopping in a grocery store across town when I nearly ran into an old lady as I was leaving the frozen food aisle. She would have t-boned me with her shopping cart if I hadn’t jolted to a stop. The woman, who looked like she was in her eighties, had frizzled gray hair and was wearing a faded red blouse. She ran over to me, and apologized profusely, to the point that it became uncomfortable. I told her everything was okay, but she kept talking.

Eventually she began just babbling nonsense. I tried to walk out of the aisle, but she grabbed my arm and held me in place. Her grip was surprisingly strong for such an old woman. I was about to use all of my strength to wrench my arm free, but I didn’t have to. She let go of my arm and grabbed her ears, crumpling to the ground. I tried to ask her what was wrong, but she became hysterical, yelling gibberish and crying. Before long, an employee heard the outburst and came over to investigate, and I booked it away from the woman.

As I walked further away, I looked back to see the employee trying to restrain her. She looked like she was fighting him, trying to run after me, using one arm to claw at the grocer’s face and the other one to cover her right ear. Finally, she was able to scream two coherent sentences.

“The storm is coming! The day is upon us, Jesse!”

I felt a chill. *How did she know my name?* I had never seen her in my life. 

I bought my groceries and left, with a lingering feeling of dread somewhere in my mind. In the parking lot, I received an alert on my phone, telling me that a tornado watch had started. Hopefully this whole experience was just a coincidence, a senile old woman guessing my name and a fairly common storm warning coinciding with her words.

I had more errands to run, so I completed those and began the drive home. It had been a few hours since my encounter at the store, and the dread had long since dissipated. The next set of strange events took place as soon as the warning sounded.

Hearing a loud sound coming from my phone, I instinctively looked down and read, *TORNADO WARNING FOR THE RESIDENTS OF BELL COUNTY ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE. TAKE SHELTER AND AWAIT FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS.*

I looked back up at the road. This wasn’t the first time in my life we’d had a full-blown warning. Usually, if there even is one, the tornado is spotted a few towns over and lasts a few minutes without coming near us. I wasn’t worried, but I figured it was safest to get back home anyway.

I was stopped at an intersection, waiting for the light to turn green. When it did, I accelerated quickly to get through; technically, a bit faster than was probably safe. If my car had sped up any slower, though, I probably would have been killed. A pickup truck had run the red light and was hurtling down the intersection. It missed my vehicle by a distance of only a few feet and continued flying down the road. I swore and nearly let the car spin out of control. There was nothing I could do about it now, so I regained my grip on the wheel and kept driving.

As I grew closer to my house, I noticed an abnormal number of car accidents on the side of the road. Several people had swerved off the road, totaling their vehicles. One motorcycle was lodged in a tree, its rider doubled over in the bushes. 

Due to the lack of police presence, I figured that these wrecks had probably just happened. I called 911 to report at least three different car crashes. Maybe I should have stopped to help, but I’m not medically trained or anything. Nobody looked to be in immediate danger. I could see the drivers of the wrecked cars wandering around on the side of the road.

At the entrance to my neighborhood I almost died again. When I turned to enter the neighborhood, both a car leaving the neighborhood and a car coming from up ahead flew in my direction. They were both going at least twenty over the limit. I slammed on the brakes and just managed to miss the two cars. They weren’t so lucky, though–the cars collided and sent tires and chards of glass flying. Some piece of debris dented my passenger’s side door and fractured my windshield.

I knew at that speed the likelihood of the drivers still being alive was slim, but I pulled over and left the car to see if I could help. I was already dialing 911. I ran up to the car nearest me and peered into the window. The driver, who looked like a young man, was clutching his hands over his ears, like he was trying to block out a loud sound. The other driver, a middle-aged woman, was doing the same thing. I was reminded of the lady at the grocery store, and wondered if the incidents were connected. They had all covered their ears like a sudden loud noise was forcing them to. If most of the drivers on the road went through that, it could explain all of the collisions.

I tried to pull the two people out of their cars, but I wasn’t able to completely pry them from the wreckage. Law enforcement and paramedics arrived a few minutes later. The drivers were rushed to the hospital and I finally climbed back in my car and started for home.

I had nearly forgotten about the tornado warning in all the chaos on the road. The sky was coated in dark clouds and strong winds blew, but I didn’t see this as a sign of a full blown tornado coming our way. I pulled into my driveway at last and checked my phone for any news. The warnings issued by the national weather service seemed only to apply to my county.

I was surprised when I read the warnings and saw that a tornado had actually touched down a few miles away. I knew I had to actually reach safety and rushed to put my groceries in the house. As I was running between my kitchen and the car, I noticed how dead my small neighborhood looked. The only sounds were the wind rushing by, my own footsteps, and my own ragged breathing.

As I was making my last trip, I noticed that my next door neighbor was standing in his yard. He seemed to be watching me with a blank expression on his face. His white hair fell down on his face, obscuring his eyes and adding a bizarre mysticism to his appearance. I didn’t know the man well. All I was sure of was that his name was Brian and he lived with his wife in the house next door. I rarely saw him, and when I did, he didn’t usually make much conversation with me.

I walked over to him with a full bag of groceries in my arms. “Are you doing alright?”

He shook his head. “Something strange is going on. And it’s not the storm.”

“What do you mean?” I asked. My mind flashed back to all the bizarre experiences I’d had over the last few hours. They had all happened at the time of the warnings, but they didn’t seem connected to the storm itself.

“My wife is in pain,” said Brian. “She fell over earlier. Covered her ears. She said her ears were ringing and that she just wanted it to stop.”

“But you couldn’t hear anything?”

“No. She went on like that for a while, but I couldn’t hear the sound. Then she grabbed me and started talking about a storm. She told me that the storm was not normal. I tried to ask her what she was talking about, but she wouldn’t answer. She started crying when the warning started. A few minutes ago, she started drawing pictures of it.”

Seeing my puzzled expression, Brian pulled out two folded up pieces of paper and handed them to me. “She's probably drawn about twenty now. I don’t know what’s wrong with her.”

The winds picked up as he said this, and I told him to stay safe before rushing inside, holding my groceries and the drawings. My neighbor didn’t move from his yard—he just kept staring blankly at my driveway. The whole exchange was weird, but it did answer some of my questions. Somehow a decent percentage of our town’s small population was hit with this strange dog-whistle-like sensation that the rest of us couldn’t hear. As far as I could tell, no one knew where it was coming from. I checked the news again, and the phenomenon wasn’t being reported on by any outlet that I was aware of. 

As I was checking the news on my phone, another warning appeared. This one said, *F4* *TORNADO SPOTTED HALF A MILE EAST OF GREENBURG. IF YOU ARE INSIDE, SEEK REFUGE IN A WINDOWLESS ROOM AT GROUND LEVEL. IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE, MOVE TO THE CLOSEST AVAILABLE COVER. EXIT ANY VEHICLES AND DO NOT LEAVE YOUR SHELTER.*

The alert startled me. I read it over again. The F5 detail was the scariest. That couldn’t be right. That’s a five out of five on the tornado intensity scale. That would make this extraordinarily rare, and extraordinarily devastating.

Like I mentioned earlier, my only real plan in case of a disaster like this is to take refuge in my bathroom until it blows over. It was as safe a spot as any that I know of, but it definitely wasn’t ideal. I wished more than anything that I had a reinforced underground bunker to hide in. Even as I entered the bathroom and closed the door, I could hear the wind blowing outside, louder than I’d ever heard it. The next few minutes passed in nervous silence. I found myself constantly refreshing the news page for updates, but there weren’t any. Eventually I gave up and leaned against the wall. My breaths had become shallow and shaky. The threat seemed so close, and a hundred images flashed through my mind of a massive windstorm tearing through my house, ending my life in seconds. 

I looked down and saw two folded up pieces of paper on the floor. I must have completely forgotten about my neighbor's drawings and dropped them on the floor. I picked up the first one and unfolded it. I’m not sure what I expected to see on that torn piece of lined paper, but I know that I won’t forget what I saw.

It’s difficult to describe the picture in a way that encapsulates the disturbing nature of it. All it showed were a bunch of scribbles that barely formed a coherent image. A massive tornado tore across a basic landscape. A couple of poorly drawn houses were being tossed in the wind. The wind was portrayed with squiggly lines, and it had a face. The face of the storm was far more sophisticated, drawing-wise, than the rest of the picture. It looked old and wrinkled, and had large, out-of-proportion eyes. Its thin lips were stretched into a sort of smile, like it was enjoying the destruction it was causing. 

I set the picture down and was reaching for the second one when a sudden, painful sensation overwhelmed me. I felt myself being shoved to the floor by some unseen force, and my eyes filled with tears from the pain. A second later a loud, high pitched sound rang in my ears. I felt my blood run cold. I clasped my hands over my ears to block it out, but it made no difference. I knew what was happening to me, and I knew that there was nothing I could do to stop it. 

For what felt like several minutes, I writhed in pain on the floor of my bathroom. Images passed through my mind in a whirl of colors, too fast to make out. The ringing grew louder. The pain grew more intense.

An image began to surface in front of all the noise. I saw myself being engulfed in a raging whirlwind. Then I felt myself hitting something hard, and I realized that what I was seeing was real. I was laying on my back, staring at a monster, a hungry beast that was devouring my house and my possessions. The tornado stretched all the way into the sky, and its winds had to be moving at least a hundred miles an hour.

I’m not sure why I was still on the ground, but for a few seconds, I watched everything around me being drawn into the vortex of the storm.

The ringing increased in volume, but I barely noticed it. I didn’t even feel pain as the tornado’s winds picked me up and launched me at breakneck speeds out of my house. When I landed on the grass across the street, I didn’t stand back up. Instead I watched the storm, swirling impossibly fast, consuming the earth around it in a fury. As the world began to grow dark and I finally began to lose consciousness, I saw in the dark storm clear shapes forming into the same face I had seen in my neighbor’s drawing.

When I awoke, I was laying in the wreckage of a house that was not mine. I blinked and sat up, taking in my surroundings. I felt like I had entered another world. No structures were still standing, as far as I could see. Every house had been torn to the ground. I could see figures searching the piles of rubble for survivors. Shakily, I got to my feet.

How I was still alive, I don’t know. The speed I was thrown at should have killed me, or at least broken my ribs. I felt fine, albeit shaken up. I looked around, trying to locate my house amid the destruction. Eventually I saw my car, overturned and completely destroyed, about fifty yards away. I stumbled toward it, and sat down next to it, my head in my hands. I still wasn’t able to fully grasp what had happened or what I had lost. 

There was so much on my mind that I hadn’t even realized there was no more ringing in my ears. The pain had subsided except for a light aching in my legs and midsection. Whatever had come over me earlier had passed.

At some point, I noticed soft sobs cooking from nearby. I looked over and saw Brian’s wife sitting in the ruins that were once her house. I walked over and examined the wreckage. It didn’t look like much could be salvaged from their house, but that wasn’t why she was crying. 

I sat down next to her and she said, “He’s gone. Brian’s gone.”

His body was nowhere in sight. I wanted to comfort her, but I didn’t know what to say.

“I wished it had been him instead of me. I...” the old woman couldn’t bring herself to say what was on her mind out loud. I held her for a while and let her cry, then stood up to look through my own ruined house.

There wasn’t much I could save. The storm had broken just about everything in its rage. After a few minutes, I glimpsed something lying in the middle of the wreckage that looked relatively untouched. I made my way over to it and picked it up. It was a piece of paper, turned face over so that I couldn’t see what was on it. When I saw the crease marks, though, I knew exactly what it was.

I flipped it over and looked at the picture. Strangely enough, the crude pencil drawing filled me with anger. I walked over to Brian’s wife and said, “Did you draw this?”

When I showed her the picture, she burst into tears and refused to respond. Coming to my senses, I backed off. I shouldn’t blame her. This wasn’t her fault.

The drawing showed the ruins of a town. Standing on a basic landscape, a poorly scribbled version of me surveyed the rubble. Hovering over me was the face of the tornado, and under that was written the word “*SPARED”* in large, messy red letters.

At least 200 people are either missing or confirmed dead, based on the information I’ve been able to gather. No one in my town will ever be the same. I know we will all live to regret being spared. In some ways I envy the ones who never heard the noise, and were never subjected to the pain that came over me yesterday. I don’t know what became of them, since their bodies haven't been found. That’s what really drives me insane. 

I don’t care about my house or my car. [I just want to know what happened to the ones who didn’t hear the ring.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Low-Buy-1233/comments/o5u4t1/notify_me/)
