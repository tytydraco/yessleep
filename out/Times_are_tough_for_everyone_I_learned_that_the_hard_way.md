Her eyes, pitch-black yet bizarrely luminous, scanned my body in search of what I'd taken. I tried to keep still, praying she'd see that the jewels weren't on me; that she'd notice - without me having to move and risk misinterpretation - the backpack hanging from the tree branch overhead.


With my arms kept at my sides and my legs pressed together, I looked up into hers, and intently turned my gaze to the bag just inches above her. She'd pounced on me from some perch in the trees, knocking the bag loose from my hand. She’d apparently tracked my progress out of the earthen cavity – out of her den. How could I have known that I was stealing from a horror of the wood?


She met my fear-widened gaze for a moment, the two *regularly situated* eyes glaring, a hatred inhuman and unreal practically emanating from them. The third eye, embedded in her forehead and undeniably, repulsively *dead*, stared with milky lifelessness to my right.


Finally, just when it seemed as if she'd collapse my skull with a horned headbutt, she tilted her head skyward; freeing dead leaves from her sylvan hide. Her glare landed on the bag, and her rigid, animalistic posture relaxed somewhat. The still-vestigial tail she'd grown whipped almost playfully behind her; the stench that had been falling from her body changed, becoming almost sweet; no longer bearing the rancid notes of extreme decay. Her whole demeanor became almost enchanting, and the black terror I'd felt only moments before was replaced with...affection, adoration, even. As if I'd somehow fallen in love with this twisted fae-woman.


Rising from her crouched position, she reached out with a leaf-gloved hand and retrieved the bag, delicately pulling it away from the branch. With a grace that was the polar physical opposite of the savagery she'd displayed mere moments before, she crawled away from me with the bag cradled in her arms.


Chancing my safety, I sat up and leaned against a tree. She paid the movement no mind, all her focus remaining on the bag. She spent a second examining it, then deftly tore it open. Upon seeing its contents, her body language relaxed even further, and my strange attraction towards her doubled. 

 
I felt a sudden urge to embrace her, enchanted as I was. But my remaining reason - however depleted - kept me seated. I knew that there was some sort of manipulation at work, some disarming pheromonal effect – if not actual sorcery. 


Delicately, she scooped up the white, perfectly ovoid objects and held them up to the sunlight. Dumbfounded, I watched as life came to the third eye in her forehead. A pupil and cornea appeared, both burning with that black brilliance, like the corona and core of some nightmare sun. The eye peered at the jewels, plainly mesmerized by them.


The bony horns atop her head lost some of their jaggedness and rigidity, drooping down harmlessly; and the tail she'd started to grow again receded into her spine. The leaves that had acted as a hide curled inward, no longer bearing their sharp edges. I found myself thinking, "Wow, how could I ever have feared this creature? She's beautiful..."


But before I could further ruminate on the idea, she spoke in a voice that was – despite her inhumanity – immaculately articulate: "I wonder, should I peel open that stomach of yours and inject my poison right into your gut, so you suffer slowly? Or, should I carve out your heart -  whilst keeping you alive, of course - and roast it on an open fire right in front of you?"


Even as I heard these horrific contemplations, I found myself succumbing to an even deeper spell of infatuation. I couldn't remember a time when I'd felt so utterly enthralled by a regular woman, and yet here I was - spellbound by some she-creature of the forest, from whom I'd taken precious jewels or artifacts of some kind.


I hadn't intended to *steal*, I’d stumbled upon a massive, peculiarly warm hole in the earth, wherein was buried a handful of pearlescent objects. Who wouldn't have thrown them in their backpack?


Helpless, rendered immobile by the gravity of my inexplicable love for her, I watched as she placed the bundle into a steamy orifice that had soundlessly opened up in her abdomen. She then rose to her full height - no less than seven feet - and pointed a knife-point nail at me.


In the same uncannily articulate speech she'd used before, she said, "I will not harm you, human. But the next time you enter my woods, I will do just as I'd said. You and your kind have trespassed enough, and your attempted theft of my property was reason enough for me to kill you. But I won't. Go now."


As if a weight had been lifted from me, I felt my body slacken, and the air around me lost some of the tension that had stealthily accumulated around me. I tested my limbs, and found that I could move them. Scrambling to my feet I sputtered out my apologies, to which she responded with narrowed eyes and low, almost insectile chittering. 


Regaining a little of my composure as I brushed away the last of the leaves, I met her gaze and said, "I'm sorry for stealing your jewels."


She laughed, a cackle as of some long-mad crypt keeper conversing with a corpse. A hand went to her stomach, and the sweltering orifice re-opened. Showing no sign of discomfort, she reached inside and removed one of the glimmering ivory objects. 


"These are no jewels, child. They're eggs. Quite expensive. I wasn't just going to let you run off with them. I paid too much.”


Her grip tightened, crushing the egg. Yolk, sickly purple, fell from the shell; sliding down her wrist. With a forked grey tongue she licked up the juices, letting not even a single drop go to waste. She then flicked away the debris of the shell and closed the orifice, ending the gruesome demonstration. 
Had I not still been under the effects of her enchantment, I probably would've puked. 


"Ahhh, fresh from the aerie. They’re organic dragon eggs, you see. None of those caged, sweatshop wyvern eggs the harpies eat. Terribly, evilly expensive."

Her third eye winked at me, and I was finally instilled with enough disgust and terror to turn away and flee.
