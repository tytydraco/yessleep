Church's usually the place where humans usually go when they're scared of demon's right?...well not that church exactly.


An old almost ancient church ,it was build before ww2, big and had a nice Catholic design, had it's peak in the 30's ,in the war though it got abandoned for a long long while since it was in a pretty active area

Years after, it got reconstructed again yet as we know humans aren't very...active around churchs these days ,practically this one, Well because usually it didn't lead you back to your god ,it led to something else

The father of the church let's call him "father John" ,an old man in his 60's already witnessed......more than "holy" things there....

The nuns repeated complains of never having a moment of privacy without maddening fleeting moments that leave them whipping their heads around and never finding anything, a shadow behind them in the mirror yet nothing is there when they look up, a voice in the night ,marks on their body ,flashes and images of things in their memories that never happened. The thing that stood out the most was one day when two nuns were taking a shower in the shared bathrooms each in a stall....they heard splashing sounds in one of the stalls across from them...but the bathrooms were empty a second ago and they didn't heard the door open....when they looked they noticed there's a shadow there....it doesn't look female...a man...a man's back turned to them...muscular body and dark short hair, seemingly also taking a shower like nothing is wrong, the two poor nuns ran out of the baths screaming and calling for the priests ,when the priests came it disappeared....followed by faint yet undeniable deep sinister laughter echoing around baths ,the women baths were locked for weeks after that....as if it'll stop all of this mess.


The priests didn't have it any easier....temptations, voices ,whispers ,sometimes even lipstick stamps where they **really** shouldn't be, phantom touches, feminine perfume scents in certain spots, fleeting flashes of bodies or skin in the mirror but when they focus there's nothing there ,dreams...

one of the reoccurring event that happened to almost every priest was when a woman in a dress enters the church (although they never really see her coming through the door she just appears in the pews when they look back) she'd request one of the priests to "confess her sins" and when they get in the confession booth she pours her "sins" out....as pure the priests were and as experienced they were with hearing different sins from people this one wasn't like any other they had....the "sins" she confess sounded almost like tempting words and description of acts and stories perfectly ploted and told in a way to lure any man's imaginations untill the priests left gripping their crosses and praying for strengths as they leaned against the booth wall between them helplessly ,and when the "confession" ends and the priests are finally able to get out of the booth....no one comes out from the other side....as they whip the curtains open the booth is empty like there was no one really there*


one of the events that stuck with the poor old father john was one of the boys that were soon-to-be-priests ,tommy was the "golden boy" of the church ,the poor babyboy was religious since childhood ,he was an atlar boy and soon decided to be a priest.....what hurt father john the most that he never knew what happened to the boy ,from his perspective the boy just disappeared one night....

In reality it started since tommy started to be something like a student for the priest and he start to live in the dorms around becoming 18 , it started with fleeting things that left him more confused than anything, flashes in the mirror just before he focus on them , smells soft perfumes where they shouldn't be, weird strong laziness when he wants to pray or practice songs, slowly it started messing with him, and the very thing that he would try to turn back to when those things scared him felt so hard to do ,and even when he forced himself to pray ,the words would die on his tongue and a terrible throbbing headache stops him everytime.....

one night around 11 to 12am he was walking through the halls of the church to clear his mind.... after all the events lately he needed some quiet time to try and think of it all.....it was his dream to become of the church and "serve the lord" now it all feels like a nightmare he blames himself for ,being "too lazy" to pray or even recite the bible or his studies.

as he stands near one of the stained glass window with nothing to illuminate the halls but the moonlight and the light coming from his small candle he heard a faint whisper calling for him, a soft soothing feminine sound "tommy?"....he tired to ignore it chalking it up to him being tired and needs sleep....
***"Sweetheart?"***
....yet he couldn't bring himself to just walk back to his room....

***"come on~"***
......as eerie as the situation felt there's just something soothing in the voice that lulled him in....

***"Don't worry~"***

.....he found himself curiously following it ,his footsteps the only sound in the sleeping church....untill it led him out of the church and to the woods that were to the back of it....untill he reached a clearing....the sight made the poor boy fall to his knees.
Just like a Renaissance painting....bodies...women...green trees and soft pouring water.....it's like if eden was made by demons, it was so beautiful....unrealistically perfect....he could never think they were demons....

***"come on boy~ you deserve it~"*** 

.....the boy's body moved him before his mind could even think and he fell in their hands.....their soft hands....he was in a haze, brainwashed....whispers of praise and soft nothings in his ear as hands massaged his back....

***"your god would never treat you like this ,would he?~"***

.....kisses on his nape, hands played with his hair and felt all over him....easing his tight priest clothing away, the soft scents....the warm voices and touches made him feel like a baby again....

***"let it go~ it'll never work anyway~ you'll never be enough for him~"***

....even though when he tried to focus to make sense of it all it distorted....almost glitched....and even though when he tried to look in the women's faces....there was no faces...usually it would terrify him but it's like he was drugged....it's like he was in a dream....and in the very end of the this eden he saw faces....in silent screams of agony....

"is it a dream?" He thought ...did he become an angel?.....entered heaven maybe?....only it was heaven by demons....a heaven that ends with hell
,he didn't care though....he ***couldn't*** care.
and just like that the church never saw the young priest again.


And that was one of the victims of this church~
