i couldnt believe it was Liam i was just listening to. He is alive!! he is not gone forever! After 2 months of merely existing, 2 months of thinking i cannot live without Liam and its over for me , i finally had hope. Things can get better. i can meet Liam again and we can get married and start a family. I couldnt contain my nerves, my excitement, i went straight to Lynn's room and banged on the door telling her to come out.Few seconds later she opened the door and hugged me tried to calm me down asking what happened. i told her everything, She looked happy to hear that Liam was alive , she smiled and said everything is going to be alright now, we will find Liam and save him. We talked for some time and decided to call the police in the morning informing them about the phone call. Meanwhile i kept my phone in my hand the whole time , anticipating another call from Liam. i didnt realise when i dozed off, i woke up at 8 in the morning. The first thing i did was informing the police about it. Just when i was about to go wake Lynn up i got a call from an unknown number. i picked it up and it clearly was Liam again. He sounded much calm now and he told me , He is alive and he isnt hurt. He told me i needed to know something and i needed to come free him. He gave me an address and told me to not take the police with me. He told me to hurry and said he loves me and he'll do anything to save me. Then the call just disconnected abruptly. Save me? what does that mean? i was left with more questions than answers. i hurriedly called Lynn and told her about everything and informed her i was leaving to go get Liam. She was absolutely against it. She wasnt letting me go by myself, she told me to atleast let her come with me . Eventually i agreed because i knew she won't let me go alone at all. We got into my car and drove to the address that Liam gave me. It was middle of nowhere, a woody area with no sign of life anywhere near. When we got to the adress , there was just an abandoned building and nothing else. Lynn told me to reconsider going inside all on our own but i wasnt letting Liam just die , i couldnt risk it either. He specifically told me to not bring the police along. This was the only option i had. We eventually got out of the car and started approaching the building when all of a sudden i felt something hard hitting my head from the back and through my dizzy vision i saw Lynn standing there with a baseball bat in her hands. She looked apologetic and with a painful expression, She said, " Sorry baby but i need to save you from what's coming, i need to protect you and i will do so at any cost", and within seconds i lost my consciousness.
