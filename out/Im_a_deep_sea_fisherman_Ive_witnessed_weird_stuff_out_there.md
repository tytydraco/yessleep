**Deep Sea**

 

I’m a deep sea fisherman. It’s exactly like it sounds, I go out with a few other men and catch fish in the middle of the ocean. We have 2 boats, 1 smaller for fishing closer to land, and a boat for the deep sea. It’s got everything you could ever need on a boat for long voyages, from a microwave to a medical room where you can do basic surgery.

I’ve been in this field for 6 years now and I love it. I came from a horticulture/agriculture background working on farms to now working on a fishing boat. I always loved working outdoors and in harsh weather and wanted a job that isn’t you’re common 9 to 5 office job so I became a fisherman.

It takes a while to get used to the job, most jobs you get to go home each night with the kids and wife. This job though, you’re out at sea for weeks to months. Very long hours and brutal work that requires a lot of physical and mental strength, but it has become one of the most rewarding and interesting jobs I’ve ever done.

This particular time I was going on a voyage from east Melbourne Australia, down to the bottom of new zealand out to the southern pacific down towards the Antarctic circle before voyaging back to Melbourne to unload at the harbour. Total trip was estimated to take around 6 to 8 months.

Once I and the crew of 7 other men were ready, we each boarded the ship. Russel was the captain of the ship. He had been on the water for a long time, he was you’re classic sailor. Big white beard, cigar in mouth and beanie on his bald head.

We started on top deck as we embarked from the marina. I had pre checked that we had everything, and we did. “Weather’s good”, “lets set out now” Russel said over the intercom.

The first day was just getting out there, monitoring weather and getting the nets ready and other basic tasks. The real fun of the job starts when you get further out. Or at least that’s what I assumed.

We made it offshore of new Zealand about 460km. The first few days we had some good catches and nothing unusual. It was when we about 1450km away from nearest land, in the middle of the ocean. We were very isolated and the water out here was deep and freezing cold.

The first week was tough, we were battling a storm with big waves and bad currents. I was out on deck when a big wave crashed, water everywhere, drenched and cold but dry from our PVC overalls.

“duck” Russel announced over the radio, ‘whoosh’ the big wave went as a it crashed on the floor overhead as we sheltered in the hull. We were on our last net before the end of the day, it was already cold and we were tired ready for dinner and a shower. It was just me and Randell on the deck as the others were putting the fish in the lower deck and tying up the ropes on the crane.

“Ya ready” Russel said over the radio, We gave a thumbs up and he hoisted the crane pulling in the cray pot to the deck, we opened the gate and crabs went into the tub before putting them in the ice tank below deck. After, I went around to make sure the pots were secure as we finished up for the day.

By this time it was still rough. A week went by, everything was normal. Get up, eat, work for 12 hours and breaks in between then another 4 hours, break and another load of time, load up and go down for dinner, shower and go to bed. This was mostly the routine for life on the water. Making jokes in between and trying to work hard and enjoy it while we can.

The work was hard and long. Weather was unpredictable, timezones were weird. The sun only shined for a few hours a day and most of the time it was dark, cold and rough. The only thing you could see was the endless ocean and the bright lights of the ship. It felt like us were the only one on earth, far from civilization.

It happened when we were 300km off the arctic circle, after another hard day, we were all very tired and ready for a meal. The weather was clear skies as we watched the sun go down, the water was finally calm as we had been battling storms for a few weeks. I ate my food, as we talked around the table, it felt like now I could breath and actually talk to the others.

After a chat and eat I went to the shower to clean off before getting to bed. The others went to bed early before the next day. Once I got out of the shower, I changed into clean clothes and decided to go to the bridge where Russel drove the boat, you know, just to see what may be out there in the dark abyss of the seemingly endless ocean.

I got up there. It was quiet and peaceful, which was rare. The faint glow of the lights on the control panels and the slow rocking of the boat. A rare chance of tranquility and peace away from the world.

I was probably asleep for a good 2 hours, I woke startled a bit, and a little bit disorientated from sleeping, I was still in the captains chair and everything was still silent. Very faitly out of my vision I could see dim light moving from far away, and without thinking much of it I kept a lookout.

Suddenly a large flash in the sky, bright as day and only for a split second, it made me jump and gave me goosebumps when for a second I could see a large round super dark object just “there“ floating, I quickly went to grab the search light and go outside to see what it was. Once out there, the sound of the water against the hull and a weird low humming sound emitted from the distance, I was scared. I looked behind me and nothing but the light from the flashing red beacon on the roof where the captain tower was.

I got up onto the hull ladder near where the crane was and turned the light on, the beam pierced through the air and I saw nothing but the endless ocean. I got chills. I went to walk back when a humming got louder but it wasn’t the engine. I was shaking a bit. Nothing but the black abyss of the ocean and the light of the beacons in the middle of the ocean deep in the night.

I was tired and figured I was just hearing things from the lack of sleep. I went down to the quarters where we sleep and got into bed, it was way past bedtime being 1:15am showing on the clock, and we were meant to wake up at 7:00am.

I had a weird dream, there was this virus that spread around called “laughing down pass” where at a random time someone would have uncontrollable laughter and then end up jumping out the boat out to sea, and it didn’t end there. They would end up into a room where figures with black gowns would surround them and they would get “surgery” before falling out the sky, on a boat and then being fine with full memory of what happened.

“knock, knock” I heard on my door. I woke up rubbing my eyes stumbling through the dark. I opened up and it was Russel, “hey buddy how are ya’ll doing?” he said “Yea, not bad mate” I replied. “have you seen it yet?” Russel asked, “No, what do you mean” I asked back, “we found a strange black sticky liquid out deck” Russel said, “I did see some weird stuff last night, I saw a flash and heard some weird noises late last night” I said.

“look, what ever you do, be carful outa here, it’s dangerous and there’s lots of weird stuff that happens out here”, “never go out after midnight” Russel said, “why though” I asked back, “look, I’ve been out here for a long time as you know, I’ve seen some weird stuff at night and the ocean gets scary, if you don’t watch you’re back, you go places you don’t want to go” Russel said.

“okay” I replied. I walked out to the kitchen/eating area and got some food and talked with the other guys for a while. Once I mentioned the stuff I saw last night thing’s only got weirder.

Over the days, I’d see stuff out at sea in the corner of my eye, dark figures, mutant animals and weird flashing lights from the sky.

The following night after dinner, we went to bed early and had finished the fishing for the trip. It had been long and exhausting. Everyone was tired and homesick, missing kids and family. I’d been awake for 18 hours.

I had my shower as usual and had a cup of tea after. I went to bed because I was very tired. I fell asleep very quick and the boat was quiet. I woke up in a dark room, pitch black and silent with a tiny red glow in the distance, what felt like forever I became fixated on this tiny light, I felt lost yet a sense of peace that I had never felt before.

Round, small and far away. Sat still. Suddenly covered the entire room in a flick, everything was this deep bright pure red colour. I felt every emotion in a matter of 10 seconds and it ended with the feeling of waiting for something to happen.

I suddenly felt a cold, like really cold wind and could hear it was loud. Then out of nowhere I saw specs like stars before falling into water. Cold, dark and quiet. Again but I feel like I was sinking fast, then I could see huge animals. Fish were huge and had lights on a stem sticking out of it’s head and giant squid. The body the size of a small building and tentacles thick as anything and long.     

I blacked out as I felt like I was in a dark room again and the water not there. I woke up, sweaty and hot. I turned the light on in the room and looked around for a while. It was a dream. A dream that felt like years, and felt as real as, real life.

I got out and went out to the deck. Then I checked my watch, 12:32am. Something about the time seemed funny. I started to laugh, and more. “hahaha” I laughed, and louder. I felt amazing.

Then I saw my kids in the water as the fait moon light lit the surface of the ocean, I laughed and they did as well, I then went to the edge of the boat and jumped off. Just as I did I heard a yell “STOP”. Then everything went cold and dark.

I woke up which felt like hours later and I was in the medical room of the ship. Then I realized why.
