It was finaly over and  tomorrow was gonna be my last schoolday. I pu my alarm at 6 am woke up, dressed up nicely and was ready to go out.
On my way to school I saw multiple of my classmates, they said hi and asked me how I felt and normal things u know.


As I got to class my teacher welcomed everybody and started talking about how good we all were in school and she would miss us really much.
Some students gave her hugs and presents, I gave her a hug.

When we got out to shake the principles hand we heard the fire alarm go of, since it was the last day there wasn't supposed to be a drill so we knew it was real.

Everyone started to panic and rushed outside.
The principal told everyone to get out and make sure everyone is fine.

We went out and waited buy after a while we saw the whole school outside along with the principal.

The fire was apparently so big they had to call the emergency services. 

I was sad at that point, I mean this was supposed to be a happy last day but instead we the school had to call 911!

When the fire finally went out and everything was normal again the fire department told us that someone started the fire but can't identify who.

So after a while we did the sermony outside and although it didn't feel great it was something.

As I went home I saw something strange...
There was a man at the back of the school looking at me with chilling eyes, I couldn't see him but he pointed for me to come.
 I didn't respond at first since he was a stranger and went home but that was a misstake.

When I got home I immediately got a text message from an unknown number telling me
 *come back* 
I didn't know what to do but then he sent me a picture of my front door.

I panicked and immediately went out to confront him.
But when I got out I saw just a note saying meet me at (53'56'13.O'N 18'49 39 0'E) I looked it up but turned out it was in Poland so I sent him "sorry i can't go there but who are u btw"
He responded with

I'll burn ur house down if u don't meet me.

I panicked and immediately called the police because I got threatened.
They told me they would come and find him so I went to my room and tried to sleep...which was a misstake.

I suddenly woke up tied to a chair and a knive on me.
Before I could react the man that I saw earlier took away the knive and told me that I had 29 seconds until he will burn down my house.

I told him to please spare me and I will give him whatever he needed but he didn't care.

I had five seconds left until

He took out a lighter took some gasoline and spilled it around the house!
He took out a lighter and was about to light the house on fire but suddenly the door got knocked down and 12 cops came rushing at the man!
They knocked him down untied me and took us out if the house.
They put him in the car and took to the hospital bcuz I had deep scars all over me that he gave me while trying to wake me up.

When I woke up in the hospital a cop came in with my parents, he told me that the strange man was a gang from Mexico that hang people and came for me to hang me.

I was scared but my parents were there for me and as they rushed to hug my I only had three questions: who exactly was that man, why did he burn down my school and why did he come after me?
