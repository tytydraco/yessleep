I used to work as a flight attendant back in 1994 but I had to quit after three months on the job 

I'd like to share with you the reason why I quit because I need your help, so please, let me tell my story...

It was the summer of 94 when I was hired as a flight attendant for a major airline.

I was ecstatic as this was my dream job.

During my first week there, I made friends with the other flight attendants. I had become especially close to 2 of the flight attendants, Mandy and Tasha.

On our layovers, we'd often shared a hotel room for safety reasons. Mandy was the social one while Tasha was more reserved and I, was in between. The 3 of us became inseparable.

My 2nd month there, when Tasha went missing. The police were called in and her parents even hired a private investigator but to no avail.

After Tasha went missing though, inexplicable things began to happen on the plane.

Like one time during a red-eye flight to Los Angeles, a passenger claimed that after a brief nap, he awoke to find a dark-haired flight attendant sitting in the seat next to him.

Thinking she was taking a break, he tried to have a conversation only to have her vanish right in front of him, and of course, this freaked him out 

Another passenger was using the bathroom when she claimed she saw a hideous face in the mirror. She was hysterical and It took us 3 hours to finally calm her down.

Even the cleaning crew claimed to see a flight attendant inside the plane while cleaning late at night.

Soon the rumors began to swirl that the plane was haunted and afterward some of the employees quit their jobs.

It all came crashing down on the night of August 9th, 1994.

After experiencing some major turbulence, the passengers and crew finally settled down with most of them asleep at that time.

It was around 11 PM when an ear-piercing scream broke the silence. The screams were then followed by the sound of someone pounding the hull of the plane that reverberated throughout the plane. The passengers then began to scream, as the lights began to flicker.

It wasn't long before I spotted what looked like Tasha walking towards us while dragging her foot. Gone was her beautiful face replaced now, by something hideous.

As she got near me, I called out to her.

"Tasha?" 

She ignored me though and continued dragging her foot towards the cockpit almost like she was on a mission.

When she finally reached the door of the cockpit, she began to wail as if in pain causing me to cover my ears.

John, one of the pilots opened the door. He turned pale as he came face-to-face with her.

"Tasha?"

Without warning, she lunged at him.

That's when the plane began to free fall.

You could hear all the passengers as they began to pray.

Tasha began to lift John off the ground.

 "I"m sorry!" he shouted.

I knew then that he murdered Tasha.

After the co-pilot managed to safely land the plane, John was arrested.

During his trial, it was revealed that he was having an affair with Tasha.

The night she was murdered, she revealed to him that she was pregnant. Tasha threatened to tell his wife about the affair and so, he murdered Tasha in a fit of rage.

As the police were hauling John off I spotted Tasha standing near the front of the plane. Soon enough though, she faded away.

I quit the following day.

Eventually, the plane was retired and then used for scraps.

That was 29 years ago and her body was never found and later, declared dead.

While in prison, John died of lung cancer, never revealing to authorities where he hid her body taking the secret to his grave.

Over the years though, Mandy and I remained good friends seeing each other when we could.

Now, the anniversary of Tasha's death is in a few days and, Mandy and I have been seeing her everywhere.

I think she's trying to hurt us and I wish I knew why...

Please, help me.
