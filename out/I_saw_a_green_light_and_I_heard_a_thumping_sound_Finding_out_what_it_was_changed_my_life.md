It was the sound of scratching that almost woke me up. My first thought was that it was snowing outside. But it was my half-asleep, stupid mind talking. It never snows in my town. Through my half-closed eyelids, I saw shapes shifting against the window. My vision was hazy, and I wasn’t sure what was out there. But I could see the green light flooding through the window of my room, dancing across the ceiling.

I remember thinking: *Someone is scratching against the window.* But that didn’t make any sense either. It terrified me. *They must be leaves*, I thought. *Dead leaves.*

I tried to move my arms and legs, but they seemed to have gained weight overnight. At that moment, they were at least ten times heavier.

My eyelids were opening and closing of their own will. It felt like I had lost control of them. But still, the world wasn’t completely cut off from me. I remembered the wind had been rustling before, but now it was *howling*. *This must be a dream,* I thought. *It has to be.* For a moment, there was darkness, and the next, the room seemed to swim before me in slow motion. Still, I tried not to close my eyes, anyway.

I tried to turn my head to the left to look at the digital clock on my desk. But my neck felt tight, like a cork in a bottle of wine. I tried to move my arms and legs again. They didn’t move an inch. My heart started pounding in my chest. It felt like even if I got back up, I was doomed to fall back into my bed.

The back of my T-shirt was drenched in sweat, and beads of sweat were forming on my forehead. My attempt to turn my head to the left succeeded after what seemed like a really long time. I’m not sure if it was seconds, minutes, or hours, though, as the sense of time in sleep is skewed, just like near a black hole.

That was when I saw the numbers of my digital clock racing through all the combinations of numbers, like a stopwatch. A lump was forming in my throat, and I remember reassuring myself: *It’s just a dream. I will wake up soon. I will wake—*

The green light from the window started flashing on the wall above my desk. But that’s not what made me try to scream. It wasn’t the numbers on the clock racing, either. It was the sight of my digital clock rattling on my desk. Then I heard a loud, rumbling noise.

I remember opening my mouth to scream, but all that came out was a weak groan. My heart was beating with an unusual slowness. I could feel the muscles around it tightening. The green light kept flashing on the wall, and my body seemed to sink deeper into the mattress. The terror of it all must have been the reason I drifted off to sleep.

Or maybe I just *passed out*.

**\*   \*   \***

When I woke up the next morning, it was still dark outside. I ran the palm of my hand over my forehead, expecting a fever or something. But my skin was as cold and dead as a corpse. When I touched my feet, a chill ran down my spine. They were damp. I must have been sweating profusely the night before. The dizziness was gone, but my shoulders ached a little.

Then the images came flashing through my mind, in bits and pieces: the green light; my digital clock rattling on the desk as if an earthquake were shaking it; and the numbers racing like—

I jerked my head to my left, looking for my digital clock. There it was, glowing at 5:30 AM in red against its black screen. Almost exactly where it had been last night. Well, I’m not sure. Maybe it had slid across the desk a little. Maybe I hallucinated it. Maybe I hallucinated all of it. At that moment, it felt like everything that had happened was born out of my imagination.

I jumped out of bed, rushed to my desk, and yanked open the drawer. Lying on top of a mess of coins, pens, and crumpled slips was my mobile phone. I keep it there every night so that I don’t waste my time staying up late. I clicked the power button. The clock on my lock screen was ticking at 5:31 AM. I glanced at my digital clock and back at my mobile phone. Both were ticking at 5:31 AM.

*Well, maybe it was just a dream*, I thought. Suddenly, the numbers on the clock vanished. I smacked it, hoping it would start working again. But it didn’t. *Maybe it wasn’t a dream. Maybe what I saw was real.*

I swiped open the lock screen of my phone, and this warning popped up on the screen:

**Shutdown warning**

**Warning! Battery temperature**

**too low, your device will be shut**

**down.**

As far as I can remember, I had never seen a warning about battery temperature on my phone before. The battery icon in the top right corner of the screen was no longer green. It was red. My phone’s battery was 2%. But here’s the thing. I have a habit of fully charging my phone before going to bed. When I used it last night, it was 95%.

I searched for my phone charger and found it. When I was about to plug it in, the screen went blank. The battery was dead. I tossed my phone on the bed in frustration. I turned the switches on in my room. The ends of the tube light shimmered for a few seconds. It made a popping sound, and then it was dead, too.

I looked at the window of my bedroom. There was no green light that I could see. I didn’t hear any scratching noises. Droplets of water were streaming down the windowpanes. I reached under the bed, grabbed my torch, and lurched toward the window. I swung it open and shone the light outside. It was drizzling, and one word described perfectly what I saw: chaos.

A branch of the oak tree across from my house was dangling; the dense undergrowth in front of my house, across the road, was beaten down; the shingles of the roof of my house lay on the ground. I looked to my right and saw that the roof of my pickup truck's shed was gone. It lay a few meters left of my house, covered in litter.

*It’s real. I was not hallucinating.* I left the bedroom with my torch and hurried downstairs.

**\*   \*   \***

I was squinting, still in a daze, trying to come back to my senses. The hallway was quiet, except for the sound of raindrops pattering outside. But that wasn’t all. There was a thumping, which seemed to emanate from deep within my house. I couldn’t hear it, but I could *feel* it, you know? I could feel it in my chest. I could feel it in my feet, too. I walked toward the door, and the oak floor creaked beneath my feet. I took my raincoat from the hanger and put it on.

When I was on the porch, a gentle breeze was blowing, slanting down the course of the rain. The sweet smell of grass was in the air. There was another smell, too. A familiar one. *Where did I smell that before?* I thought. The wind blew stronger this time, filling my nostrils with an unmistakable stink. *Petrol*, I thought. *Diesel, maybe. But it's still different, though.*

I stepped off the porch and onto the wet soil. The torch started flickering too, so I smacked it and it began working again. I began scanning the ground with my torch. Then I saw something. It was a blue liquid. When the light hit it, it glittered like something I’d never seen before. I let out a deep sigh and didn’t like the sound of it. I could feel the veins on my forehead pulsing.

I kept walking, and I saw patches of it all over my path. The only sounds were my footsteps and the rain drumming inside my ears. I felt an urge to look over my shoulder, but I didn’t. *I’ll only scare myself more*, I thought. I quickened my pace, following the trail. I felt the ground beneath me ripple a little in perfect beats. The trail of the liquid finally led me to the back of my house, where the door to the basement was.

As I got closer to the basement door, I could feel the ripples intensify. I figured it must be the same thumping I’d felt earlier in the hallway. I had kept the basement door locked up all these years, but now I could see it was open. The lock was on the ground, broken. *Someone is inside*, I thought. *Who could have done this? A burglar?* I pointed the torch at the stairs leading down to the basement. The blue liquid was on them.

My instinct told me to go back to bed and sleep tight, but my curiosity was stronger. I started to descend the steps one at a time, clearing the cobwebs with my hand. I was careful not to step on the liquid.

When I was on the basement floor, I saw faint ripples of blue light coming toward me in widening circles. It wasn’t just light. It had a strange, solid quality to it. A baseball bat was leaning on the wall to my left at the end of the stairs. I grabbed it, my fingers tightening around the grip. I tried the switches, but the lights didn’t work here either.

I began walking toward the source of the ripples thumping beneath my feet. There was a lot of stuff down here in the basement, mostly cardboard boxes and old furniture. A musty smell mixed with a faint, oily scent hung in the air. Taking cover behind the boxes, I walked a little further. That was when I heard a metallic noise.

I peered over the cardboard box and saw a device that was similar to a tripod. It was the length of my palm. Its legs looked like those of a spider, ending in sharp points. At its center, it held a small cylinder that was sliding up and down. It emitted a blue light from a sapphire-like stone. Dust puffed into the air as it slid up and down, emitting ripples of deep blue.

My eyes bulged in their sockets as I stared in horror. *Someone is here!* I gulped, and my throat made a clicking sound. There was a coppery taste in my mouth. I peered a little more, and I saw the thing next to the device.

The cardboard box I was peeking over fell, and I gasped. I raised my baseball bat at the thing, clenching my fingers tightly around the grip, and yelled, “WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU?” I shuddered in disbelief.

It suddenly clasped its right arm with its left hand and pressed something with its index finger. The deep blue ripples shifted to a faint green. I dropped my baseball bat and stood there frozen, like a moth caught in a spider web.

My body, which was in a fight-or-flight mode just moments ago, began to relax. My racing heart calmed down. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, then let out a sigh. When I opened my eyes and looked at the device, I knew it was the green ripples that had done this to me.

And there it was, right before my eyes, leaning against the wall.

It had a round, helmet-like head with a black visor. It had arms, legs, and a torso, just like a human. It was made of metal and had a white paint job, by the look of it. The white paint was scraped in many places as if it had been in use for a long time.

“I am E7-Delta from the planet TRON-12b,” it said in a weak, robotic voice. “There’s no need to worry. I won’t harm you.”

“I—I don’t believe this is happening,” I said. “So, you’re an alien? An alien robot?”

“You call us robots?”

Faint white lines scrolled across its black visor. Beep. Beep. Beep. The lines vanished.

“Such a machine built to resemble a human being or animal in appearance and behavior,” it said. “Merriam-Webster.” It turned its head away from me and looked to its right as if it were thinking. Then it looked at me again. “No, you are mistaken. We have a life of our own.”

I felt a strong urge to raise my torch and peer into the deep blackness of its visor. I pointed my torch at it, expecting it would turn out to be nothing but a con artist trying to fool around with me. The light couldn't pass through it. It didn’t flinch like normal humans do when a bright light hits their eyes. There were no eyes behind it. I couldn’t see any face either.

I glanced at the device next to it for a few moments and understood that it was beyond the capacity of humans to make. I looked at the blue liquid leaking from its back onto the wall, then back at it. Not taking my eyes off of it, I placed the torch upright on the concrete floor. The whole basement lit up in a faint glow.

By then, any suspicions I had that it was human were gone.

“How can you speak my language?” I asked, bewildered.

“My life support accessed the databases on your planet and fed me over 7,000 languages,” it said, pointing at the device. The ripples were more intense here compared to what I had experienced in front of the basement door before. Every time it spoke, white lines scrolled across its visor. I guessed they were letters.

“How did you get here? And *why* are you here?”There was a bitter taste in my mouth.

“On a spaceship. I was abandoned here. There’s not much I can do here. I’m... terminating,” it said in a fragile voice. “Your heart rate is rising again. But it will stabilize soon. There’s nothing to fear.”

I understood that it was talking about death. One look at it, and you could tell it was at its end. But wouldn’t analyzing my heart rate without permission only scare me more?

Suddenly, it slumped against the wall and sat back on its haunches, making a low-frequency hum. I dropped to my knees and watched it closely.

“Are you okay?” I asked, a little concerned. “What's happening?”

“My life force energy is leaking out,” it said. “I can't do anything now.”

I figured the liquid must be its fuel. The oily stink was overpowering. I couldn't help but feel sorry for it. “Can I do anything to stop this from happening?” I asked.

“No. You can't. My time has come.”

*No one can stop death when it comes*, I thought. *Even stars die when it's time*.“Who abandoned you?” I asked.

“The overlords of TRON-12b,” it said. “I’m a worker on my planet, by your definition. Mining industry. But they call us ‘Diggers.’ The overlords are on a hunt for other planets with rare elements. I was on their spaceship, serving food to one of them. He didn’t like it. So, he kicked me out.”

I saw a dent in its chest metal plate. *Only metal can dent metal*, I thought. By the look of the dent, I tried to imagine how massive the foot of its overlord must be. My mouth went dry.

“The green light,” I said, looking at it. “I thought I was dreaming or something. I thought maybe it was a storm that did it,” I said, pointing toward the mess in front of my house. I still couldn’t believe all of this was happening. I couldn’t believe it at all.

“I’m sorry about that.”

“Never mind. It wasn’t your fault,” I said matter-of-factly.“I'm sorry about what happened to you.”

It nodded. I’m not sure if it got that from the database or not. The nod seemed genuinely human.

“I tried to use my life support to draw in life force from nearby energy sources if I could detect any,” it said. The energy here is just not enough to revive me.”

I remembered the dead battery of my phone and the tube light in my room. *Electric charge driving life?* It must have consumed all of it. I wondered if my phone was alive, too.

“When were you made?” I asked, assuming it wasn’t *born*. At least to my eyes, it didn’t look like the work of nature.

“Cycle 5, phase 4,” it said. “In other words, twelve Earth years.”

Whatever it was—sitting in front of me—it was thirteen years younger than me. A twelve-year-old in the mining industry?

Suddenly, the hydraulic pump-like tubes from its back, connecting to its neck, started hissing. I jerked, got on my feet, and took a few steps back. It pressed a small button on its thigh. The hissing subsided significantly, but it didn’t stop.

“I’ve got nine minutes till termination. You can ask me anything if you like,” it said. “I’m just glad I’m with a fellow being in my last moments.”*Fellow being*, it said. Not *alien* or something else.

I was hesitant to walk forward because of the hissing. It noticed and said, “It’s safe.”  
I stepped back to where I had been before.

“Aren’t you scared of death?” I asked. “Aren’t you scared of what comes after?”

“Death? What’s that?”

Beep. Beep. Beep. The lines scrolled and disappeared.

“Oh, I get it now,” it said. “No, I am not scared of it. Because I know there’s no such thing as death. My Spark will be transferred to another living being in this universe when they are born or created in another world. I’ll forget what I did in this life for a long time. But I’ll remember—again.”

“Spark?”My eyes widened as I heard it. I realized it was talking about what we humans call “Soul.” I had read about the afterlife many times before, but I never truly believed in it.

“What about the others?” I asked. “Beings like you?”

“The same thing happens to them,” it said.

I was trying to process what it had told me. My jaw dropped as something clicked in my mind. “Are you telling me that you can talk to people from your previous world again?”I asked.“Is that possible?”My mouth was shivering a little.

“Yes. But my Spark has passed through 316247 lives. I’ve got exactly 3794964 friends. Acquaintances included. It would be 3794965, including you,” it said. “Most of them have forgotten me, I guess. They don’t talk to me anymore.”

My stomach turned up as I heard it. 316247 lives. 316247 worlds. Unbelievable. I had gotten the answer to one of the biggest mysteries of the universe.

“Hurry up, time’s running out,” it said.

I didn’t have to think a lot to ask the most important question any human being on the planet would ask an alien if it were friendly. “Is there any threat to Earth from your planet?”

“As of now, no. But I’m not certain. You must never disclose what happened here. If the people of Earth find out about me, it could be dangerous for Earth.”

I nodded.

The blue liquid was pooling around my feet. E7-Deltatried to move its legs, but it settled back into the same position as if it were in pain.

“Two minutes to go,” it said. “Any more questions?”

“Can I do anything for you in exchange for revealing one of the biggest mysteries of the universe to me?” I chuckled, but there was a dull pain in my throat. It felt stupid to ask if I could do something for a being from a civilization far more advanced than Earth.

“Just don’t forget me,” it said. “Like the others.”

I was holding back tears. “I won’t,” I replied.

It looked at me and uncurled its fingers. I understood immediately and clasped its hand in mine. The cold touch of its metal fingers sent a chill down my spine.

“Ninety seconds to go,” it said. “I’ve got nothing much to say. But if death smiles at you, don’t be afraid of it. Smile back. It’s peaceful. I know, because you and I are not so different, after all.”

I nodded, my eyes welling up with tears.

Its metallic chest let out a deep whirring sound, and fumes began to rise from it. I knew that this was it. It was dying.

“Get away from me. Now!” E7-Delta shouted.

I turned away from it and lurched toward a big table. Taking cover behind it, I peeked over it. Its metallic hands and legs were trembling, and it raised its hand into the air as if to say it was okay. I raised my hand back at it, too. That was our final goodbye.

BOOM!

I shielded myself with my hands. The blast was so loud that my ears began to ring. I felt the heat coming off in waves. A few seconds later, the ringing stopped.

When I looked back again, the white fumes had turned black. I could see the smoke charring the ceiling. A deep humming sound came from it, and the white lines on its black visor flickered, then vanished. Its head lolled to the right and finally came to rest against the wall.

The green light of the device—its life support—glimmered, then winked out like a dying star. The spider-like legs curled inward, the cylinder holding the sapphire-like stone slid back, and the whole thing turned into a compact cylinder. Then it rolled towards me.

I picked it up and marveled at it. It was a deep silver. I slipped it into my pocket. The fumes had stopped, and it looked like it was all over.

*What should I do now?* I thought. Metal plates lay scattered all over the basement floor, revealing a mesh of black wires in his chest. It seemed so fragile in that position, lying there in my basement. It was a shame it had to meet its end like this. Here, in another world. But I guess I was by its side.

I looked at the dent in his chest again. *Who could do that to a twelve-year-old?* I thought maybe age didn’t matter in their world.

Would I bury an abandoned twelve-year-old kid who had no one in the world, and died like this in my basement? I guess I would. So, I did.

**\*   \*   \***

I covered it with a tarp I had found in the basement. I carried it in my arms and started climbing the stairs. It was unbelievably light. I have no idea what element or metal it was made of. I saw the faint blue glow of the morning sky as I reached the basement door. The rain had stopped. Everything was quiet except for the soft twittering of birds.

I placed it on the cargo bed of my pickup truck. Then I grabbed a shovel from the basement, set it beside E7-Delta, and drove to the woods.

I walked into the pines. Sunlight passed through the dust motes, forming golden beams. Crickets chirped steadily in the background. I chose a spot where no one would ever find it. I dug about six feet into the soil, laid it to rest, and shoveled the soil back.

“Goodbye, fellow being,” I said in the quiet wilderness of the woods.

I lit a cigarette and started driving back home. The sun was low in the sky, glowing yellow, and the grass along the road swayed gently in the wind. I thought about all that had happened as I cruised down the road. Lines from a poem by Dylan Thomas came to my mind.

I was thinking about many other things too. Oh, yes. I had a lot to think about.

  
\*   \*   \*  


It’s been twenty-five years since that incident. The life support device I kept with me began glowing again four years after I buried it. But I didn’t know what it meant. So, I stayed silent.

In the meantime, I started teaching physics at the local college in town. I have two kids, a boy and a girl. Most of my students are around twenty-one years old.

Today, as the bell rang, the students began to leave the classroom. Only one of them stayed behind. He had that dead look about his blue eyes.

He raised his hand as if he had a question. “Sir, can I ask you something?”

“Yes?” I said.

He walked up to me and held out his hand.

“E7-Delta. Does that ring a bell?” he said, smiling almost puppet-like.
