I wasn’t always like this. A year ago, I was just another teenager trying to survive high school. Sure, I had a secret—a strange ability I couldn’t explain—but I kept it buried deep. I didn’t use it unless I had to.

My mom always said I was "too sensitive," that I could "read people." She didn’t know how right she was. I could really read them. Their thoughts, their fears, their memories—they were all there, like books I could flip through if I focused hard enough. I didn’t ask for it. I didn’t want it. But I had it, and I learned the hard way that some books are better left unopened.

For years, I practiced control. I’d only dip into someone’s thoughts when I felt threatened, like the time a boy in my math class started following me home. I saw what he was planning before he could act, and I took a different route that day. Small things like that kept me safe and that gave me some comfort.

But then, I met him.

It was a Tuesday, and I was at the park near my house. I liked to sit on the swings and pretend I was normal, just another kid enjoying the breeze and the sunlight. That’s when I saw him. He was sitting on a bench near the playground, sipping coffee from a paper cup.

At first, he looked harmless—just another guy killing time. But something about him didn’t sit right. He wasn’t watching the joggers or the pigeons. He was watching the children. His gaze lingered too long, his fingers tapping an erratic rhythm on his cup.

I told myself not to do it. Not to look. I could feel the itch in the back of my mind, the way his thoughts brushed against mine like static electricity. But I knew better. Reading minds is a lot like opening doors: once you go in, you don’t always like what you find.

Still, I couldn’t stop myself. It was like an instinct, a compulsion. I reached out gently, just to skim the surface.

And then I fell.

His mind wasn’t like the others I’d read. It was dark, tangled, chaotic. Images slammed into me like waves: a blood-streaked floor, a child’s shoe lying abandoned, a locked basement door. I heard faint screams, felt the damp chill of a concrete room. And I saw her—a little girl, maybe six, with blond curls and wide, terrified eyes. He was planning to take her. He’d already chosen her. Her name was Stephanie.

I yanked myself out of his thoughts, my chest heaving, my head spinning. That’s when he turned. His eyes, hidden behind dark sunglasses, locked onto mine. He smiled. Not the friendly kind of smile, but the kind that sent chills crawling down my spine.

“You shouldn’t have done that,” he said softly. His voice carried across the playground, low and deliberate.

I froze, my legs trembling as I tried to look away. But I couldn’t. His gaze pinned me there, like a predator sizing up his prey.

I stumbled off the swing and ran. I didn’t stop until I was home, locking every door, closing every curtain. My mind was racing. I wanted to tell someone, anyone, but what could I say? “Hi, I think this guy I met at the park is a killer. Oh, and I know this because I can read minds.” Yeah, that would go over well.

For a while, I thought I was safe. Days passed without any sign of him. But I recieved a note on my windowsill, written in neat, slanted handwriting: Stay out of my head.

Now, every time I close my eyes, I feel him there, just on the edge of my thoughts. He’s not just watching me. He’s inside me, clawing at my mind, unraveling me from the inside out.

I don’t know how much longer I can hold on. But one thing’s for sure: I should never have looked.
