Every night, as I drift off, droplets settle on my eyelids. They don’t wake me — just a faint touch, both soothing and unsettling.

When I finally sink into sleep, I find myself in lands I never wished to know. Pale phantoms crawl into the corners of my mind like smoke. Their faces, twisted in mute suffering, accuse me without a word. What have I done to them?

The harder I search for answers, the more reality slips through my fingers.

Last night something broke.

When one of those translucent shapes brushed my shoulder, I felt a burning cold — like ice pressed to my skin. I bolted upright with a scream. On the floor, just beside the bed, a puddle gleamed. In its dark depths, long, dark hair floated.

Not mine.

For months I’ve lived in a voluntary cage. Contact with people became so exhausting that I walled myself inside four walls, reducing the world to the bare minimum.

And yet, that hair is real. When I lean over, I see a face in the water.

Not mine.

The same face that haunts my dreams. Her eyes, endless pools of grief, bore into me. Her lips move in sync with my name, which I don’t hear — I feel it vibrate through my bones.

I recoil.

Then droplets begin to fall from the ceiling.

This time, not just onto my eyelids.

Since that night, nothing extraordinary has happened. Sometimes I think that if I tried to run, the door would refuse to obey. Or that the same face from the puddle would wait for me in the corridor.

This riddle holds me here like a fly trapped in a spider’s web.

Two weeks passed. Today, something equally strange occurred.

Leaving for the store, I passed my neighbor. I tried to greet her, if only for appearances — but my words passed through her like glass. She didn’t react. Didn’t even blink.

As if I were a ghost.

At the store, the cashier scanned my groceries, looking right through me. When I reached for my change, her fingers passed through my wrist.

She didn’t touch me.

Because she couldn’t.

Back home, I stood before the mirror.

My reflection blinked out of sync.

Then the droplets appeared again.

They ran down the glass, blurring it like watercolor. In their wake, hair coiled — the same as before, now twisted into a loop.

Like a noose.

I heard a whisper:

“You won’t escape. Because you’re already dead.”

The words came from my mouth.

But I did not speak them.

I stood, watching my reflection lose its rhythm. Droplets streaked the glass, and in their trails, writhing hair appeared — like kelp from the depths.

“This is not your home,” the voice whispered. “This is your coffin.”

I turned. On the bed lay a man. Wet. His face blue, mouth full of water. His fingers clenched the sheet.

My fingers.

The droplets on my eyelids? Still the same water. The water that filled my lungs when I drowned in solitude, and the world didn’t even notice my absence.

A droplet fell onto my hand. Heavy as mercury. Before I could shake it off, the skin beneath grew transparent — a wet veil. I saw bone, dissolving too, like sugar in hot tea.

I tried to scream, but my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth. My mouth tasted of a pond — rotting leaves and algae. In the mirror, my face slid down my neck, leaving a bare skull crusted with the puddle’s hair.

The last sound I heard was the splash of a thousand bodies rippling the surface. All of them — with my eyes. All asking the same question:

“Are you not alone now?”

Then — only water. Always water.
