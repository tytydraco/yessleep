The first time I ventured to the abandoned railroad bridge, both my mind and the night were wreathed in fog.

I’d taken a girl along, Kendall--I waited tables with her. It was a late, humid, summer night; our path scored by humming unseen insects and the rumble of planes landing and departing nearby Eppley Airfield.   

“I can’t hear anything over my own heartbeat,” she said.

I was 19 at the time and knew that feeling quite well.

That she’d not considered me to be a serial killer was a minor miracle in retrospect.

I’d parked the car maybe a half-mile away from the bridge, in a clearing of low weeds near a decomposing “No Trespassing” sign on a rotting fence, which may or may not have still signaled a breach of private property. For all I knew, the sign had originated for literate dinosaurs. It was pocked with bullet holes; because America. I’d shut my door quietly, observing the makeshift pair of parking spots created by tires from previous vehicles. We weren’t the first teens to check this place out.

As Kendall exited the car, she swatted at a large insect.

“Bundle up,” I said, hoping she wouldn’t. “Might be chilly over the Missouri River.”

I pronounced Missouri more like “misery,” emphasizing the first syllable in jest, though I’d hoped that night’s experience with her to be the word’s antonym.

She tugged a sweatshirt down over her head, but still was wearing shorts, which flattered her legs.

“This is sorta scary,” she said. We chatted in fast whispers, both to avoid detection and winged creatures flying into open mouth cavities. “Couldn’t we…get arrested?”

“Not if we don’t get caught. You’re not afraid of heights, right?”

“Heights? You never said anything about heights. I don’t know.”

“You’d know if you were. That’s good, because I *am*.”

I double checked my pockets for keys, wallet, and condoms before ushering us on.

She caught my deep exhale and we left together.

We hadn’t trekked twenty feet when I tripped and nearly fell over a blanket of tree roots. She covered her mouth, stifling a laugh. I smiled back. I mostly remembered my friends’ directions. We rounded a small grove of trees. 

Sure enough, we approached a gravel incline up to the railroad tracks. The worn, weeded path beneath our feet shifted into chalky chunks of gravel. She stopped to remove a small stone wedged into the crevice of her sneakers’ tread. The breeze fattened as we reached the plateau of railroad ties. A few planes now visible in the distance, framed just beyond the tall, chained link fence, topped with a froth of barbed wire. To the immediate left, less than fifty yards away, more barbed wire fence, and a sign:

“Keep out! Dept. of Omaha Corrections Facility.” 

“Corrections facility?” she admonished with a whisper. “Lemme get this straight. We’re trespassing on maybe airport and definitely creepy correctional facility property…in order to trespass on some sawed-in-half, bridge gone wrong over a deep, cold river? Is this where you take all your first dates or only the girls you plan to mutilate?”

“I deserve that. Look, we totally leave once we reach the bridge if we start freaking out.”

Above the sharp fencing, a halo of airport lights ushered in a faint glow to the sky, revealing deepening clouds. In the distance, long black runways like tongues of tar studded by diamonds of white light outlined the borders of the runway, where green threshold lights indicated safe-to-land zones. A luggage carrier slithered down an endless tarmac, its frog-eye bulging. The lit-up control tower resembled a lighthouse beacon. Farther away, the glass windows of the terminals absorbed the last of the distant horizon with their black, expressionless, gaze of tinted glass.

I carried a small, thin flashlight in my pocket, just in case. But for now, there was enough light to see by without it. Wildflowers, hay, and an unknown odor permeated my nose—the earthy footwear of river, wet wood, muddy foliage, and expiring vegetation. I smelled it before I saw it, the river. It ran parallel to our right, beyond a bank of bordering cottonwoods. Suddenly I noticed spaces opening up beneath me, anywhere from three to six inches between railroad ties and ground, as the latter landscape slowly lowered beneath us. We’d reached the trestle. 

“Careful,” I said. “Watch your step. It gets trickier now.”

Kendall stayed silent, her eyes concentrated on the ground. She latched onto my arm and leaned into me as we continued.

A railroad tie creaked as we gave our weight to it. Kendall bore her fingernails into the flesh of my arm, the scarlet of her nails perhaps the fill line of my own blood. I worried a bit about the upturned fangs of rusty nails within the splintered wood of eroding ties and rotted tie plates, but it was too late to turn back now.

Why? Because it felt inevitable. All of it.

A static of crickets as Kendall swiped at Asian beetles or moths or something landing on her clothes. I swatted at a mosquito on my neck. Ahead, the railroad tracks hooked right, with the gradual curve of a deformed spine and the narrowing of stenosis; the ties its vertebrae. Did I hear the beginning of the river’s broadcast or just the breeze through cottonwood trees? I could taste my adrenaline. It tasted like the pennies me and my friends would leave on railroad tracks as kids to later observe flattened by mighty trains.

“The tall weeds are tickly on my legs,” she said.

Soon the steel and timber trestle supplanted the solid earth below.

“I don’t like this,” she said. I didn’t either and my heart fluttered, but…

“We can still turn around,” I said, though I never believed that, not even then.

“Well…we’ve already made it this far…”

At a height roughly equal to the tallest of the treetops, I saw the corner of the massive bridge, jutting out maybe a hundred feet away.

She stopped. “Jesus it really exists.”

My thoughts exactly. “Hold on a second.”

Carefully, I dug into my hoodie pocket for my flashlight. I was shaking, and didn’t want to drop it. I dimmed the light as low as I dared, just enough to focus on our footing.

“Hold onto my arm,” I said. “Concentrate on your feet as you walk. Don’t…look down…through the gaps.”

“How can I look down at my feet but not look at the gaps?”

Good point. She was shaking or shivering, or both.

We passed the next milestone my friends had described; the defunct signal. It was mounted to a single post, faded paint scaling its length, vines twined around its wooden body like a vise, coiled around its dead eyeball lights. The first thing I noticed about the bridge was its large size. Secondly, its rust. Thirdly, how the Nebraska end of the structure we stood upon stretched out over the river halfway, while the Iowa end on the other side was turned parallel to the shore.

Here’s the extent of what I knew about the bridge at that time: it was an old swing span bridge, which meant it contained two spans or draws, half operated from the Iowa side and half from the Nebraska side. The two rotating spans swung on a vertical axis, allowing boats and ships to pass through an otherwise blocked waterway. When built, it’d been the longest double swing span bridge in the world. It’d been unused for decades; the Iowa (eastern) span left open permanently--its faint trace of ribs barely visible in the ragged moonlight. I wanted to convince Kendall to venture far enough over the river to see the impressive view of Omaha’s modest skyline. And if sex happened, well, so much the better.

The bridge itself resembled the prehistoric exoskeleton of a lumbering brontosaurus. Cables clung to an outside fence, braided with the texture of spider webs. The structure seemed to feed upon surrounding vegetation.

A metal plate attached to the main structure of bridge, just before it spiraled upward, read:

Dedicated by Waddell and Hedrick.

Controlling Engineers. Kansas City, MO.

Built by American Bridge Co. of NY. 1903.

Everything holding the dilapidated, abandoned bridge together sounded like verbs for what I wanted to do to her: nail, screw, rail.

Once on the bridge, I’d been advised to choose the side of the bridge route over venturing down the middle. The middle contained the most corroded railroad ties. Taking the side route meant using the iron slats against the very side of the bridge. This meant fewer gaps—meaning less likely to fall and plummet to the river below.

“Wh…what do you think?” I asked her. “Side, or…head back to the car?”

I felt bad dragging her there. I at least wanted to grant her the illusion of a choice.

“Side,” she said. “I guess.”

The water rushed below us, louder now than the faint hum of aircraft. I felt unsteady. I’m glad we’d decided against smoking a joint after we’d parked. My brain was foggy enough as is.

I stared at the abrupt end of the bridge span, where it swiveled into a T-shape. Below, I knew the bridge was supported by a central concrete pier that plunged deep into the riverbed. Halfway across the bridge, a thin, corroded ladder rose to a platform. A rusty chair sat perched atop the platform, like a throne for some god of mud and rust.

Concentrating on each slice of wood, I inched us forward, one arm around hers, and the other hand brushing against the cable for navigation.

The bad news about the side was when the slats *did* end, the gaps were as long as two feet, which would force us to use railroad ties, which were, fortunately, at least more trustworthy on the edges than in the middle. This meant shifting our feet to our plant leg and sort of hopping from the tie to the next slat. The maneuver required confidence and balance, neither of which we had in abundance. If we overshot the hop, only a cable--no thicker than a telephone wire—would protect us from Ms. Missouri, unless we happened to be near one of the structure’s bracing beams. Additionally, the side path’s woozy view provided tangible proof of the awaiting plunge below. The wind blew strong out over the river.

I felt something crawl over my far hand. I yelped. I removed my grip from the cable and shook my hand. I returned my hand to the swaying cable.

“Are we gonna fall?” she asked, alarmed.

“No, sorry,” I replied, embarrassed. “Spider.”

I felt my hand on the cable glide over something the texture of dried birdshot.

“Okay I see part of the downtown skyline now,” she said. “It’s cool. Really. But can we go the hell home now?”

It was true. Omaha’s skyline didn’t wow, especially still partially hidden by the curve of river, but its lights impressed.

I was no longer thinking of sex on the treacherous bridge, only survival.

“Yeah, let’s go.”

My answer surprised her. But I didn’t feel like being responsible for her death, and I didn’t particularly want to die either. We could always fool around somewhere safer after, like the car. Her arm in the moonlight was pimpled with goosebumps.

We were at least twenty feet out over the river before we turned around.

Suddenly my arm jerked downward. Kendall had stumbled over an extracted spike. She bumped into me, and I started to sway, losing my balance.

“Fuck!” She yelled, startled.

I reached for the cable mid-stumble but failed to snag it. Gravity sent her jerking into me, and I could only retain my balance—*our* balance—by clamping my free hand down on a jagged post edge. I felt a sharp pinch as we fell to our knees on the iron slat. The flesh of my inner hand caught on a nail as we yanked downward. The hinges of her wrists bore into my inner thighs, which bore the brunt of her weight.

“Jesus,” I said.

Once we realized we were safe we stood silent for a moment, catching our breaths, and waiting for our racing hearts to subside a little.

She noticed my hand. “Oh man, that looks bad.”

“Nothing a tetanus shot can’t cure,” I said. The nail had unzipped some of the flesh from the palm of my hand. “You okay?”

She nodded, still looking down. “Y…yes. Jesus, my legs feel like noodles.”

“I mean, at some point this bridge actually supported real-life trains. I won’t let you fall. Promise.” I corralled her with my non-injured hand just above her waist, aiding her from one slat to another, carefully maneuvering her spindly frame as if we were dancing.  

Finally we made our way off the bridge and returned to solid gravel beneath our feet. We didn’t speak for a while. No sound other than her heavy breathing layered over my own, just the exertions of our lungs and hearts and the imagined plots of other sounds. We made our way back to my car in silence.

What I didn’t tell her, what I never told her…was at the moment we almost fell, I caught something out of the corner of my eye; a figure. A skinny man or creature crouched at the far end of our span. They appeared to be wearing a conductor’s hat. When I’d looked again, they’d vanished. But after we left the bridge, before we rounded the turn to the trestle, I looked back one more time. I saw them again. They appeared…to wave…at me.

So I waved back.
