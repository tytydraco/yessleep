I don’t know what to do. This is going to sound completely, batshit insane. But I have to tell someone.

About a week ago, I saw a jogger on my way home from work. We live in a small town with a lot of sidewalks, so it’s pretty common to see joggers or people walking their dogs after dark. Sometimes they’ll get creative with the lights—I’ve seen dog leashes strung with LEDs, people wearing headlamps. This is especially common now, in winter, when the sun sets before 5 pm.

So, I thought nothing of it. A pinprick of light, bobbing up and down the sidewalk, about thirty yards ahead of me. Just another jogger.

But then I got closer. And I realized the way the light was bobbing was… strange. I couldn’t really put my finger on why it was strange; it just was. Something in my brain clicked—*it doesn’t look like it should.*

And then, as I passed him, my entire body froze.

He had no head.

I know. I couldn’t be sure; I only saw him for a second. As soon as my brain registered it, he’d already passed. I glanced at the rearview mirror and saw the bobbing light receding, but it was too dark to see whether he had a head or not.

As I drove home, I struggled to find a reasonable explanation for what I’d seen. Maybe he’d been wearing a balaclava—it was pretty cold out. That would render his face nearly invisible in the darkness. *Wouldn’t I still see his eyes, though? Or, something?* Or could he have been wearing some sort of costume, some sort of mask? But why? It wasn’t anywhere near Halloween.

Well, whatever it was—there was no way he was actually headless.

It’s easy to see things. Not hallucinations, but little glitches in your brain, misinterpreting reality. Like when a bit of hair falls in front of your eyes, and you think it’s a shadow person for a second. Or when you see a misshapen tree stump by the road, and think it’s a deer. I remember the time I convinced myself Santa was real, even though I was too old to believe, because I’d seen a shadow in the neighbor’s front yard on Christmas Eve. When it was probably just a bush, or a deer, or even a piece of my hair in my peripheral vision.

By the time I was at the front door, I’d completely convinced myself that it wasn’t a headless jogger.

“I scared myself so bad tonight,” I told my husband over dinner. “On the way home, I saw this jogger, and I thought—I thought he didn’t have a head.”

My husband laughed. “The Headless Horseman trying to lose a little weight, huh?”

I chuckled.

“Maybe you’ll see him at Dawn Yoga next. Doing a downward-facing dog.” He took a bite of garlic bread. “Or, hey, movie idea. *The Headless Horseman* for 2024. Ichabod Crane goes on TikTok and finds a headless fitness guru. They could call it… *The Headless Influencer.”*

“Oh my gosh,” I laughed, rolling my eyes.

But that was before things got worse.

On Tuesday night, I took our dog out for a walk after work. And about halfway down the street, I saw it: a light, in the distance, bobbing up and down. I crossed to the other side of the street, to get out of his way.

Something felt wrong about it, though. That same sense of wrong I couldn’t place when I saw the light on the headless jogger. But I continued down the street as he grew closer.

And that’s when Sadie started to growl.

She stared at the light. Ears pinned back, teeth bared, growling. My stomach dropped. “It’s okay, girl,” I said, but the pit in my stomach grew.

I tried to walk forward, but Sadie wouldn’t budge. So I stood there, phone in hand, pressed against the curb as the light got closer. And closer, and closer…

Until he came into view.

The jogger’s pale arms swung with each step. His feet hit the pavement with a rhythmic *thump, thump, thump.* The light shone from something strapped to his wrist, erratically bouncing off the asphalt.

*Thump, thump, thump.* Closer.

I held my breath, staring at the spot above his shoulders. Fifteen feet away, now… ten…

*No.*

He had no head.

It was obvious this time. Absolutely clear. There was nothing above his shoulders but thin air. Yet his body was still pumping away, his feet pounding the asphalt. I stared at him, petrified with fear, not even understanding what I was seeing. Sadie let out a snarl.

Then he passed me.

And I saw something else.

The muscles in his exposed shoulder. In the short, smooth stump of his neck. They *moved.* As if…

*He was turning to look at me.*

I yanked on Sadie’s leash, and this time she had no problem running. We sprinted back to the house, both of us panting, terrified. As soon as I got inside I locked every lock we had, even the deadbolt we rarely used.

“Steven!” I screamed.

I told him what happened, tripping over my own words, blabbering, barely coherent. Not knowing what else to do, he called the police. They came over and searched the neighborhood; but they didn’t find any headless jogger.

Of course they didn’t.

The three of us packed up and went to my sister’s for the night, just an hour away. I couldn’t sleep at home. *It was on our street.* Maybe it even followed me home, knew where we lived. I knew that sounded crazy. But I had seen it, and I would swear on my own life that there was a headless man running around out there.

As I stared at the ceiling, trying to fall asleep, a childhood memory popped in my head. A lesser known Dr. Seuss story that I had loved as a kid. *What was I scared of?,* it was called. A pair of “pale green pants, with nobody inside them” follows and torments the main character. It has a happy ending, of course, but the biting unease of seeing something that’s so empty, that doesn’t have a head or any place to put intelligence or a brain or a soul—yet is moving, acting like something sentient—stuck with me.

It felt oddly similar the feeling I had now, dialed up to 100.

We spent two nights at my sister’s place, but after that, we had to get home. The extra commute time was wearing on both of us, and my sister’s one-year-old was waking us up at night. So we headed back home, and I tried to pretend like I’d never seen the headless jogger. Maybe that was the last time I’d ever see him.

It wasn’t.

Because at 3 AM that night, I woke with a start. And when I rolled over, I saw a light twinkling in through the blinds.

*What the hell…*

Without thinking, I pulled up the blinds.

*No.*

My blood ran cold. I stood there, frozen, my feet stuck to the floor. I couldn’t move. Couldn’t think.

I was face-to-face—or rather face-to-nothing—with the headless jogger.

It was just *standing there,* six feet outside my window. Still as a statue.

The blinds clattered shut. When I finally had the courage to peer through them, it was gone.

I’m terrified. I don’t know what this thing wants, or what it wants to do to me. I don’t even know how it’s *thinking.* How it’s moving. I went to the police again, but no one will believe me. My husband is suggesting a vacation, just the two of us. He thinks I’m going crazy.

I’m not.

So, please—if you ever see a jogger at night, and you think for a second they don’t have a head—

Don’t brush it off as a brain glitch.

Run the other way, and don’t look [back.](http://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels)
