In the year 1960, at Rajshahi University, a tale of spine-tingling proportions unfolded, and trust me, it's not your typical ghost story. Picture this: a university campus in the division of Rajshahi, Bangladesh, where our main character, an orphan student, decided to spend his Eid-ul-Fitr vacation. Now, let me set the scene for you. In those days, communication in Bangladesh was about as reliable as a broken rickshaw, which is crucial for what's to come.  
  
So, there he was, the lone orphan, with no relatives around, and a hunger that only biryani from the big town/bazaar area could satisfy. His plan? Grab some food, catch a late-night movie, and then head to the university around midnight. Simple, right? Well, not in this story.  
  
He watched the movie, and when the credits rolled, it was dark, really dark. Midnight dark. So, he decided to grab a rickshaw to get back to the university. Here's where things get crazy. What should have been a two-hour rickshaw ride turned into a ten-minute nightmare. That's right, ten minutes to cover a distance that should have taken hours.  
  
When he finally reached his destination, he was ready to pay the rickshaw-wala. But hold on to your seats because this is where it gets downright freaky. The rickshaw-wala had hands that looked more like furry hooves, and his face? It resembled a horse. I kid you not, a horse-faced rickshaw-wala. Now, if that doesn't send shivers down your spine, I don't know what will.  
  
Panicking, our student fled to a nearby tea stall, where he spilled his tale of horror to the stall owner. But here's the kicker â€“ the stall owner actually acknowledged the bizarre transformation and pointed out that our student's hands and feet had also turned into hooves. Can you imagine? Hooves!  
  
Terrified out of his wits, he sprinted back to his university hall and begged the guard for help, convinced that the horse-faced creature was out to get him. The guard tried to calm him down, and for a moment, it seemed like he might be safe. But then, he passed out.  
  
When he finally came to, his roommate was there, and he began recounting the nightmare he'd just experienced. To his shock, his roommate was already familiar with the horse man. Even more shocking? His roommate's hands and feet had turned into hooves too, and the malevolent horse-faced entity was taunting him.  
  
Just before slipping into unconsciousness for the final time, the elder brother whispered to his sibling, "That horse showed me its true bloody face." And with that, he was gone.  
  
When they examined his body, it was a gruesome sight. His internal organs had turned into mush, his eyes were completely white, and his heart had liquefied, with the liver nowhere to be found. It was a death straight out of a horror movie.  
  
But that's not the end of it. The story takes an even more chilling turn when they discover a pattern. A total of 19 individuals had met violent ends, all sharing a common belief that "Bikrompur's horse man will kill me" before their untimely deaths.  
  
Fast forward to 1980, after the liberation war, and the nightmare resurfaces. A student named Rakib and his friends experience a similar horror after visiting Rahmania Hotel in Kolhapur. They too encounter the horse man and try to banish it with holy scriptures.  
  
But the story doesn't end there. Efforts to expel the malevolent presence lead to more gruesome deaths, with messages like "I left" chillingly scrawled on the victims. The horse man's legend lives on, still haunting the country and seeking its next victim.  
  
So, my friends, this tale of "Bikrompur's horse man" is not your run-of-the-mill ghost story. It's a rollercoaster of terror and mystery that continues to send shivers down spines and make you question the line between reality and the supernatural. ask me any question (and yes ppl of bangladesh can write like this )
