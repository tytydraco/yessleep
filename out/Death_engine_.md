Note :this story is part 1 


The people of my city are scared of a murder that happened in an abandoned workshop 2 days ago and no one knows how that happened.The police did everything to evidence but the killer take everything and leave the place,leaving the dead body to the ground.Until the police found a camera sticked to a monitor which were working,the policeman opened the monitor and he heard a creepy message from a guy saying "hey dave you probably don't know who am i or where are you but tonight you will die in this room after what you have done to me".the message ends and the monitor shows the person who killed here being chained and a pendulum going to cut him in pieces.The police were shocked what did they saw and take every evidence and leave the place go to the police station to process more the body.

Today i wake up peacefully and went to my job to work.While i was working the director came and said "good morning Jonny uhm i just want let you know that there was an mail came to me and it was for you here take"gives me the mail, i open it,and i see nothing that much suprise just the bills and some others offers of a bunch products and a weird paper saying"you are my second Jonny" not gonna lie i was curious to see who sent me.Somithing that i forgot to say is that i live in a city where everyone is unfair and the job im doing is outside of the city.The municipal of my city doesn't care about everyone and we are living like everyone is an enemy.The time went 16:30 it was time to leave from work and then go home.As i arrived at home i saw an unknown mail saying"open your door Johnny"when i opened it i was completely shocked and sad with what I saw.My wife was dead,she was hanged by a rope"oh my god what happened"i said while being confused and crying" and there was message saying" i had enough of you"then someone grabbed me and drugged me to faint.

I woke up and i saw myself being hanged by iron bars,i was scared and confused.Something that i saw too was the monitor that the police found was looking exactly same as this,then it opens and starts talking."Hello Jonny you don't know me but I know you the city you live is the worst but today i collect over 10 or more people of your city and you are the second victim of me,there's no escape,you will die". After i heard the message a big saw was coming to cut me in a half,but thank god there was a small space to leave and i escaped within 2 seconds before be cutted open.I was trying to find the exit but nothing.

I saw a different door,i opened it and inside it was my childhood bully and my ex being hanged by rope and on them there was stuck one c4 each of them."JONNY"both said surprised "what are you doing here" my ex said " the kidnapper got you too" the bully said.Each bomb had 70 seconds timer till explode and the timer started without knowing it."Jonny help us" both said and i started by trying to defuse the bully's bomb.It was hard and it last 40 seconds.I got him out of the bomb fast as possible and i ran to my ex to save her but there where only 10 seconds till the bomb explodes.The bully grab me and throws me away before the bomb explodes.The bomb explodes and my ex starts screaming in pain and dies,i get up while watching her burning in fire,the bully he puts his hand on my the shoulder and says "the reason why i pushed you away is because you saved my life"."Thanks i appreciate it" i respond to him back.

"ok lets go find the exit out here".We are trying to find the exit but still nothing until we see a another door.They open it and they see more captured people but luckily there are only seven."Holy Christ there are more people captured,help me to get them out"the bully says shocked."No,there is an alarm placed up the hatch" i pointed on the alarm."ahh goddamnit"."hey there is a vent,we can crawl to find the exit" i said to the bully"you are right".We crawled in and we started to find the exit until we heard something coming from a room.It was the killer,he was wearing a brown cape, brown to black boots, brown gloves,a mask white mask covering his face with red eyes and wearing deer horns.We were crawling in piping and trying to do not make a noise.Unfortunately the vent cap was closed,we pushed it and hoped the killer didn't heard anything."ohh jesus we are out"the bully said very happily."shhh be quiet he's gonna hear us" i told him back."sorry" laughing with a little laugh,"wait there,there is my motorbike lets get in to it" he said while pointing at it and we run away from there."So what's your name because i forgot it"i told him."Mike and you are Jonny right?" he responded back."Yes,yes i am".We where driving to our homes with no danger"should we go first to the police and then to our homes?" mike said,"yeah and quick".

We arrived to the police station and we told them everything about what happened to us and the others plus with the killer's appearance."Ok mr Jonny and mike an colleague will come to talk with both of you"the policeman said."Of course" both we responded and went to a room with the colleague waiting us."alright gentlemen tell me everything about what happened to both of you"the colleague said.Mike starts talking"so we were trapped in a place unknown but luckily we found a way to come back"."Do you remember how that place was looked like"the policeman asked both."Yeah i remember,it was kinda messy,full stuff of different torture machines, tools and more and captured people in capsules"i gave him everything that i remembered."ok and one last thing my colleague said you guys saw the killer right?"."Yes"both we responded."He was wearing a deer horns, white mask, red eyes, brown gloves,black to brown boots,a cape and a lot of weapons on his body.Thats only what i remembered"mike explained to the policeman with every detail."ok you can to go now"the policeman told us.

Me and mike exchanged our numbers to talk together and then we went to our homes and then go to sleep.Next day i went to work i everyone was outside waiting to go inside the building."What happened" i said to one employee."the principal didn't come to open the doors because she has the keys, we called her and no answer" the employee responded to me."okay i guess the principal never get late that much" i said to myself and to clarify the time i came was 10:30 and the time passed and went 13:45.So i went home and cooked some food, opened the tv and went straight to news.

"over 17 people died in an abandoned hospital by dangerous machines with engines,the place didn't have much enough evidence to see much more about the murder but the police is doing their best" the presentation said and i was terrified as much as could i ever be."jesus Christ i hope the killer to be found quickly before is too late" i said to myself again and the phone started ringing.It was mike,i picked it up and started talking."hey Mike how you doing today" "hello to you too Jonny,uhm i just wanted to go on walk together,are you in ?"."Yes i am sure,what time"."At 16:30,it is okay?"." Yeah why not","ok see you"."bye" i closed the phone and started watching videos on my phone.

The time passed and it was 16:15,i was ready and leave the house.By the time we were walking me and mike and we saw inside from the hospital, director's son waiting inside."Are you my director son"i asked him,"yes i am and im waiting because the nurses said so"he said so worried about his mom."Where is your mothers room to visit her"mike said to the boy,"right there" he pointed at the room.

As we went at the door there was a sticked note that was saying "only employees can come to see the patient" i told mike to wait here and i went inside the room."mrs director are you ok;" i asked her " yes i am,its just my belly that was stabbed" i see her belly as she pulls out her shirt and saw the rapes on her belly."Jesus i hope by the week you are gonna recover soon" i wished her in passing,"thank you Jonny"she responded back to me."Can you tell me how that happened" i asked her because i wanted to know."i was in a place unknown i did not have idea how i ended here.i was driving to my house and when i parked the car all of the sudden a man drugged me till i fainted.then i see myself trapped and handcuffed and a big vacuum machine with blades was coming to suck my organs but i don't remember how i got off and survived.The only thing that i remember it was the machine almost sucked my intestines and started screaming loudly that even someone heard me and called the police".

"sigh ok i heard enough goodbye principal see you next week or month" "mike we are going to make a license for having a gun only for you because i already have before when i was a cop and we are going end that nasty murderer ok?" i told him "yes" he responded.me and mike went to a gun store to buy guns to find the killer and kill him."ok mike we got the licences to have guns and everything right?" I asked him."yes everything" he responded, we went inside,buy assault rifles, bullets and get ready to go again and find him.

When we arrived we saw him carrying a dead body and started shooting at him.We hit him a couple times but no blood was spilled on the ground,it looks like he was wearing an body armour.As we went inside the place he was trying to climb up to try shoot us but with a marksman rifle.We were reloading our guns as fast as possible before the killer go up there."reload, reload" mike said loudly and anxious but where to know both of us that there were small pistol guns on the ceiling and started shooting us not bullets but bullets with anesthetic to make us faint.

Me and mike woke up in a room chained and a c4 was on the center of the room and paper saying "this time both of you are not getting away".The bomb had a timer of 10 minutes and we were at 8 minutes,me and mike were scared to die but thank God i found a sledgehammer on the wall"a sledgehammer yes,yes"i said surprised and i started hitting the chains,free myself and went straight to mike to free him too"ohh man thanks" mike thanked me.

The door was open which actually make me and mike think that the killer left the door open on purpose that confused us.We were trying to find our weapons and kill him and thank god again we found them but the bullets were empty "fuck,fuck i can't believe this" mike said and i was worried and sad that was the end for us but luckily we found the killers handmade marksman rifle."mike look we can get this" i showed him and the good thing is there were bullets inside"yeah man let's go" i was happy and we went to the killers workshop"Wait Jonny we need a plan and i have one" mike said "yeah sure what's it" "ok listen the gun has 100 bullets and im gonna get the 80 of them and you are gonna get the 20 because you bought an m16 and i bought an m4 and because as i saw the gun of the killer's has a little knife on it you are get as an melee got it" imke told me if have the plan on my mind "got it" responded back to him.

As we arrived at the killers workshop we saw him sitting and creating something and around him there were many more deadly machines."Hey you murder with ugly deer horns get over here"mike shouted forcefully at him,"huh what the,how are you came here"the killer saw us surprised and angry."We have come to end you once for all after what you have done to those people.Why are killing them" i asked him."Do you really wanna know why huh.Im killing them because everyone treated me like an idiot.Everyone in this god damn city is a piece of shit, everything is unfair here.I tried to go away from the city but they didn't let me because im from this and i deserve to live here.The company that you working is very rich because of you Jonny.Before you come to work here you i was working in your in your position and the company was poor because i trying to make it rich and everyone was calling me Kyle badluckson,kyle the no money generator and more when my actual name is Kyle Jamesson and do you how much it make me depressed and when i was fired my last words were i will make you pay for what you have done i said this to the business director and left with pain and angry".

"Oh i didn't know that"i said to him,but from nowhere Kyle runs with a machete on me to stab me but i dodge the hit and the my hand was and it was almost cuted off until Kyle pushed me to the ground and started hitting me and my hand got off "i will make pay for what you have done" kyle siad angry.

I started screaming in pain very much but mike saved by shooting at him making Kyle bleed but kyle was not over for him.He take a chainsaw and starts chasing mike,but mike tries to run as fast as he can and he sees a siryge with anesthetic,hides it on his pocket and when kyle tries to stab him mike pulls fast the syringe and taps it on his shoulder making him paralyzed him down.But at the same time when mike goes away to help me Kyle pulls out a small remote that controls a machine that throws saws and it was aiming at me.It starts to shoot and the first saw shot went to my sides,i started screaming in pain very much but mike grabs me and we go to the exit but then i see Kyle pressing another button and but fast enough i shoot his hand with a small pistol that i have in my pocket.

The button was already pressed and the big door that we entered started closing and Kyle started laughing like a psycho"oh god damn it,Jonny on 3,1,2,3 and mike throws me outside while he tries to do not let the door close.But sadly the door closes and smashes mike to death"oh no why,why mike but thanks mike for saving" i started crying in so much hard because i having great time with him even though he's my childhood bully.

I get up with one hand and went to his motorbike and i was driving with difficulty with one hand,i drived all the way to the hospital and rested here till I'll be ok with my hand.After 3 months my life was pretty normal even though i lost two lovely people,my wife and my bully/new friend mike and i will always keep them in my heart.
