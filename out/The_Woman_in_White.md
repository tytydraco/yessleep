Let me start with the backstory. I grew up on a small farm with my grandparents. The house was towards the back of the property, and we had a longish driveway to get to the road. There was a barn at the end and a horse trailer about 30 feet in front of it. My grandparents had lived there for at least 15 years and something always stuck out: all the women in my family would occasionally see a woman in white near the barn. It was only the women, both ones born into the family or married in. She never did anything so we never worried, it was just a weird thing that we all accepted. I vividly remember being 7 and seeing her standing by the horse trailer. She wore a long white dress and was unbelievably pale with long blond hair. I started running, never taking my eyes off her, barely blinking. She walked behind the trailer where the only option to go out of view fully would be to go inside it but when I got down there she was just gone. Not in the trailer, not in the barn, just gone. The last time I saw her for a while was the day after my mom passed away, just standing at the end of the driveway before disappearing.



That brings us to now, two weeks ago, anyway. It's been 11 years since anyone last saw her. I was getting ready to go for a walk with my baby, struggling to get her stroller outside. I don't live in that old house anymore, not even in the same state but I saw her standing at the end of the road, staring at us before yet again disappearing into someone's backyard. I didn't want to seem crazy to my husband so I just took an alternate route for my walk and kept it to myself and avoided going out unnecessarily for a few days. I did eventually have to go out again because I normally take at least 3 walks a week. I got her ready and headed out, nervous that I'd see her again. Of course I did, but not before I left though, about halfway there, closer than I'd ever seen her. She was just on the other side of the road from me, I could make out her facial features. She had piercing green eyes and no color to her at all otherwise, almost as if she had completely painted herself with white paint. It's her facial expression though that made me freeze. It wasn't kind like I always imagined. It looked evil, as if she was planning something. I was stuck in place, gripping the stroller handle as I watched her turn and walk behind the fence she was standing near.



I don't talk to my family anymore so I can't really ask if they're seeing her too but I'm absolutely terrified. I'm starting to wonder if maybe she had something to do with my mom's passing. I'm a fairly spiritual person so I'm taking some admittedly weird precautions, salting the windows/doors, burning specific scented and colored candles and even burning incense and trying to cleanse the house. I haven't been on a walk in a few days and still don't know how to explain this to my husband without sounding absolutely insane. She only shows up when I'm alone and on foot, never when I'm driving or with my friends or husband and I don't know what to do. Any help or ideas would be appreciated.
