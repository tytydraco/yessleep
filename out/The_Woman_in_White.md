✨Every house has its secrets✨

On Halloween  night, Christian and his four friends Logan, Kyle, Wesley and Stuart were at a party celebrating them all making it into college. They were all playing beer pong and listening to music having the time of their lives. As time went on the party got louder and louder which lead to the neighbours complaining. 

At 03:30am Christian noticed flashing red and blue lights outside the house. His body started trembling as he was under age drinking but most importantly him and all his friends snuck out to go to this party. Christian screams “COPS!” and everyone dispersed into the back garden and jumped over the fence. The house they were at was just at the entrance of a forest, so Christian and the rest of his friends jumped over the fence and ran into the forest with no clue where they were going. After they got deep into the forest, one of Christians friends fell over and they all stop to catch their breath. 

Christian not wanting to stop starts overthinking about what his parents will say if they find out he snuck out, but as he traces back and forth he notices something carved out in a tree which said “ theres darkness deep inside all of us.” As he was reading this he heard a woman scream in the background, this scares him and makes him jump. His friends notice this and ask him what is wrong and what he is doing, but Christian turned to them looking like he saw a ghost. 

As he caught his breath he asks them if they all heard that scream, they all gave a wired expression and said that none of them heard anything, Christian starts thinking that it was just his mind playing tricks on him, and tells them all to come and look at the carving in the tree. Logan was the first to get up but his face got even more confused, Kyle, Wesley, and stuart got up and looked but there was nothing carved into the tree. They all looked at Christian and Stuart asked if he took anything while at that party, Christian got annoyed and said that he didnt and there was definetely something carved into the tree, after 5 minutes of them all arguing a random thunderstorm appeared out of no where, all 5 of them start to run off heading deeper into the forest. 

They cut through all the trees and bushes and enter a opening where they are now standing in front of a old broken down abandoned building. The building was made out of wood and most of it was covered in ash, and it had holes scaling from gun shots to huge chunks out of the wood. 

They all looked at eachother as to say “should we go in.” As lightning struck again, They took off running towards the front door, Wesley got close to the door and tried to open it but it wouldnt open, Stuart being impatient got annoyed about the rain and said “dude… the wood’s burned, its damp, and its god knows how old, the slightest touch could put a hole through it.” He then told Wesley to move and puched the door near the handle, and to everyone’s suprise he punched a hole right through it, he then looked at Wesley and said “told you.” 

As he unlocked the door, he slowly pushed it open, the door annoyingly creaked open which made everyone cover their hands over their ears. Stuart was the first to walk in, and everyone else followed slowly behind. The interior of the house was worse then the exterior, there was ash all over the floor, huge cobwebs in near enough in every corner of each room. Large cockroaches crawling through all the cracks in the floors and the walls, almost all the furniture and decorations in the house were burned, and what creeped the 5 boys out the most… 

There was blood slowly dripping from the floorboards in the ceiling creating a puddle of blood on the sofa, seeing this Logan Wesley and Kyle instantly changed their mind about staying in the house, they all said they don’t want to stay here but Stuart and Christian said they weren’t going back out in that rain. After 10 minutes of constant bickering, Kyle, Logan, and Wesley all took off running out the house, while Stuart and Christian stayed and explored. 

They were confused staring at all these wierd carvings in the wall, they were all sketches of a woman dressed in white, Christian made a joke about how the woman burned the house down and both of them started laughing, they laughed until the next drop of blood landed but this time it sent a cold shiver down both of their spines. They were both confused as to where the blood was coming from but most importantly what it was coming from. They both began to scale up the creepy/crooked staircase and as they got to the top, they approached the door to the room that the blood was dripping down from. Christian slowly reached for the handle and slowly opened the door…
