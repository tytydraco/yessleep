There's something of an urban legend in my town about a creature called Mara'Kaboo, The Smiling Man. There are multiple different explanations for him. Some say he's an alien. Others believe him to be a demon or a creature from another dimension or the ghost of a convict hung in town many years ago. The most widely accepted story is that he's simply a homeless man living in the woods. I thought it was all just crap...until last night.

I love horror. I love being scared and thought it would be a good idea to go looking for the smiling man with a few friends. The most recent sighting was the woods surrounding a local tourist trap call Picnic Point. My town, Toowoomba, is built upon a dormant volcano surrounded by forest. Picnic Point is the very edge of the town and provides a beautiful view of the surrounding area. This is where I told my friends to meet me.

I arrived there around 10pm. Aiden was already there-he like to arrive places at least a half hour early. I went over and found him rummaging through his boot. He was putting together a survival kit. 

"You know we're only exploring the surrounding woods, right?" I mocked.

He pointed a stern finger at me, "Survival is no joke."

I left him to his rummaging and await the others. They arrived together a few minutes later.

"What up?" Kyle said. "Who's ready to look for ghosts?"

I don't remember much of the conversation after this. I do know we hung around talking while Aiden fixed the rest of his supplies. When we were ready we headed out, following the main hiking trail down, guided by torchlight. We walked the most trail, finding nothing. I suggested going off trail but was reminded that off trail is a pretty steep decent.

"Maybe we should just go home," Aiden said as he applied more bug spray to his arms. 

I was about to reply when a rustling ahead of me caught my attention. I directed my beam forward. Something dashed away from it and up a nearby tree. I clicked my fingers at my friends and pointed towards the tree where my beam was. Something sat upon one of the branches, obscured by the foliage. It moved again and a possum emerged from the leaves. I remember sighing. 

It was then that something burst through the bushes in front of us. It scared me so much i dropped my torch. I saw little in what moonlight there was so i quickly scooped up my torch and directed the beam towards the shape. It looked like a man, although the limbs were disproportionate. The arms looked too long and gangly. His face was very pale and the skin seem too smooth, like it was stretched too tightly over his face. his eyes were big and his smile was so wide it looked as if it would split his face in two. 

We all simply stood there, staring at each other. I couldn't believe he was real. I took out my phone and was about to press record when he moved. He broke into a sprint, right at us. I didn't think. I ran. We all did. I don't think I've ever run so fast in my life. Blood thundered in my ears and branches whipped against my arms and face. I heard Aiden yelling "no no no no." Then suddenly go quiet. 

We reached the parking lot and made for the safety of our cars. We reached them and turned. Nobody was there. My heart threatened to burst out my chest and my lungs were burning. "Are you guys alright?" I asked the others. 

"Where's Aiden?" Peter asked. It was then i noticed he wasn't with us. 

"We have to go find him," Kyle said.

I'm ashamed to admit that i didn't join the search-although the search only went as far as the start of the trail. After an hour of calling his phone and waiting, we finally called the police. They arrived shortly after and took our statements as others searched the woods. They took us down to the station where they interviewed us properly. They all thought we were crazy. Then sent us home. 

I was unable to sleep that night and after calling the station this morning i discovered that they still haven't found any trace of Aiden. I feel so guilty as it was my idea to go looking. I'll remember that smile for as long as i live.
