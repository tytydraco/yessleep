When I approached the human-sized doll, I did so carefully. The lights in the nursing lab flickered above me, with lightbulbs that probably hadn’t been replaced in years. The doll had only an upper half, cut off at the hips so it slouched in the sheets. My friend claimed her stethoscope had been accidentally discarded on the bed beside it. I couldn’t fight the scrapping feeling in my stomach like a mouse trying to escape from within me. Still, I pressed on, finally allowing my sneaker to bump the edge of the forgotten cot.

In a past life, the nursing building was once a hospital, and to some degree still functioned as such. I imagined that, to save some money, these beds were probably the same beds used by actual patients 20 years ago. The thought of a real human being taking their last breath in these beds made my stomach turn. How much blood had stained this metal? How many lives had been claimed in this room alone?

I quickly scanned for the stethoscope, snatching it up from the side of the bed. Its pink color stood out against the white sheets laid down for the practicing nurses. An idea came to me as I collected it. 

I reached around to turn on the doll.

Suddenly the chest began to rise and fall under the cotton gown. The eyes seemed to squint at the light above. Something about it was nearly human. Though I knew it was only motor parts, it almost felt too convincing of a breath, like if I held a finger under the nose, I would feel a rush of air. 

I put on the stethoscope, placing the metal on its chest. After the rustle of fabric had ceased, I heard a faint beat within the chest. The doll made a slight grunt, as I tried to recall how my friend practiced doing it on me the day before. The more I moved, the more sounds erupted from the speaker within. To some degree, I understood the intent. To mimic real patients surely. But the sounds that emerged sounded raw. They grated against my ears and clawed their way through my head. How did anyone deal with this?

As I placed the metal over the heart, there was a silent cry. But the strange thing was I could feel the vibrations ripple in the chest. I paused. Did I just not understand how these things worked? Of course, if there was some kind of speaker…

I lean back, laying the back of my hand gently on the rubber skin. I waited for another noise, some kind of a grunt. It remained silent. I put back down the metal to its heart.   
  
  
  


I felt.

  


I felt the rumblings of a voice in its throat. Long and inconsistent, like a person letting out a final scream for help. 

I threw my hands up, accidentally letting the stethoscope bang against the side of the cot. 

"AH!” I cry ripping it out of my ears. 

The only sound was the rapid breaths emerging from my mouth. 

My phone vibrated against my thigh repeatedly, a warning that I had been gone too long. 

The eyeballs of the doll crept down to meet my gaze. They rolled just under the rubber of the fake skin, sunken down, and fused into the crevices. 

I reached out to touch their face.   
  
  


I knock on my friend's door. 

“Oh hey, thanks.” She said as she opened the door. “I was getting worried-”

Looking at my face, her smile flickered out. 

“What?”

I plastered a smile onto my face, making it too wide and too caring. “Nothing. Sorry, here’s your stethoscope.”

She took her wet stethoscope, and I turned to leave.

A mixture of blood and water dripped off my hands and onto the floor.
