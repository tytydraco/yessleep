I tried talking to the poltergeist last night, and I think it worked.

I went online and looked up some stuff about seances. Not really sure about any of its validity, but I know it had something to do with lighting a candle. I found a few in the basement next to a bunch of old paint cans and two decrepit sawhorses. The candle sat lit on my nightstand as I said some mumbo jumbo about spirits and waited.

At midnight, the stairs started creaking. I counted as the presence made its way up to me. Through the open door, no shadows passed through the slight moonlight reflecting on the wall, yet I felt the presence on the stairs. When it entered the room, the candle flame danced and flickered. My eyes got dry as all the moisture and heat were sucked from the room.

The presence paused in front of the wall. An invisible gaze fell upon me, and as I mustered up the courage to look in its eyes, blood rushed to my head. My heart beat deafened my ears. I met it’s gaze and asked, “What do you want?”

The presence turned away from me and wrote on the wall. Time morphed and when hours, minutes, or seconds had passed, I stared at the three new words: SAVE YOUR BREATH.

For once, Harris said something smart. “That was stupid.”

“He’s so screwed,”’ said Isaac.

“Yeah, dude’s like, ‘Oh this ghost told me to get out, what if I talk to it?’” Harris said in a voice that made me sound like I hadn’t passed the first grade. “I’m waiting for the twist, dude. At this point, the author’s just dragging the story on. I’m hoping for some more escalation in the next part.”

“If there’s anything we’ve learned from this author it’s that he lulls you into a false sense of security and then drops an anvil on your head,” said Isaac.

“He’s Will.E Coyote?”

“I was thinking more Looney Tunes, Elmer Fudd type.”

Harris then did an impression of Elmer Fudd talking about scary stories and threatening a copyright claim that left Isaac in a fit of laughter. Through giggling, Isaac said, “Warner Bros is gonna copyright strike us for that.”

“Yeah, bunch of dicks.” Harris laughed.

“Totally, dude!” said Isaac. “Oh seriously, now I’m gonna rant.” He proceeded to tell a long story about how some production company that owned the rights to a story they had read had struck their most successful upload for copyright.

This has had my brain churning all night. They reference popular media and stuff like Warner Bros, so I wonder if they actually existed. I can’t find anything online, but maybe I can figure out who they were for real. In the meantime, I’m going to try and figure out how to get out of this house. Little did Harris and Isaac realize, the real villain of this house isn’t the poltergeist. It’s my mortgage company.
