Since my wife's tragic death, my life has become a mess. Everything reminded me of her and the way her existence stopped. Before I knew it, I was an alcoholic with no job , no friends and no happiness. She was pregnant. My eyes filled with tears of joy when she announced it. I was gonna be a dad, I was gonna have a kid. Weeks later, we discovered it was a boy. I was gonna raise him, teach him, and bring him in my little adventures.

The day it happened all that was lost. When the police officer knocked at my door and told me what happened, I just saw him pulling out his gun and shooting me in the chest. I know it wasn't anyone's fault and that never happened. Then, the second later, I thought about my son. The bullet went directly through my skull this time. I would have prefered for it to be a real bullet than a metaphorical one. My life ended since that day, it used to. That was until I met Alexis.

My life was falling apart and there was something I could do. Something I did. I found this little house in Oregon, in a small rural neighborhood. I found a job at a construction company in the area. It was the perfect opportunity to leave my past behind and move on. Finally turn the page.

I got along with my new coworkers, really well in fact. After work, we had the tendency to go to the bar together and drink a cold beer while chatting. That was when I saw him, sitting alone in a corner, drinking beer after beer, with an angry and sad look on his face. He must have been in his fifties. His name was Alexis.

I don't remember how and why we started talking but we did. We realized we both lived in the same neighborhood. I didn't have the time to meet everyone since I was still pretty occupied with the furniture and the boxes lying around in my almost empty house and that is probably why I hadn't met him yet.

He seemed happy to have a friend. I never noticed him really interacting with anyone except me. At that time, I was still pretty shook with my wife's death and I was surprised to know Alexis had a similar experience. His wife and kids had been victims of a burglary 3 years ago. He had found them dead when he got back from a long day at work. From the missing items and blood all over, it was determined that they had been the victims of a burglary. The burglar supposedly stabbed his wife multiple times in the chest after she noticed him. Then, he did the same thing to his two kids. I felt deeply sorry for him. That explained why he didn't look like he was having a great time.

The months passed and I got to know Alexis pretty well. He invited me to his barbecues to talk and grill meat. I found it very odd the fact that nobody was there except the two of us most of the time. His or my neighbors would occasionally join in but it wasn't common. He lived in this medium two story house with a basement. It was nice but I could see him looking at the empty rooms his wife and kids used to live in with a great pain in his eyes. That was part of why I moved to another state.

One day, while we were chatting in his backyard on two typical white plastic chairs, we ran out of our cold alcoholic beverages. Alexis told me that there was some left in the basement fridge. He asked me if I could get them while he prepared some meat for the barbecue. The entrance to his basement was a trapdoor on the floor of a small closet. I went down and immediately noticed his basement was very cold. I know hot air goes to the top and cold air sinks so it was pretty normal but I didn't imagine it could be this intense. The temperature must have been 10 degrees celsius below the temperature of his house.

He told me the fridge was behind the stairs, close to the washing machine and that I shouldn't go into the dark room in the corner because there was the water heater and all sorts of pipes. I felt like I was being watched, like a bad energy was infiltrating my skin the more I had my back turned. I grabbed the pack of beers and got out of there as quickly as I could. Right when I was about to close the trapdoor, I swear I heard something coming from the basement. It was almost inaudible but I was sure I heard a faint whisper. I may have simply been an illusion, noise coming from the pipes.

Life continued like that for a few years. Me and Alexis would hang out at his place, at my place. One unusual thing I noticed is that, whenever he would come to my house on the weekend, the coworkers that I invited had the tendency to come up with an excuse to not go. I knew something was up but didn't want to accuse my coworkers of being liars and trying to escape me, or him.

I remember in September, I asked him for help with my car because it was not working properly. Alexis was a mechanic. I knew I could get some help from him for a low price, possibly even for free. He told me he had to go visit someone for the weekend and that it wasn't possible. The next few days, his house seemed to be empty like he said it would be because he was supposed to be out of town but his car was there. His car had not moved an inch. When I asked him about that when he got back he told me he used his bike because it wasn't far from our little town. I believed him. Alexis was like that, sometimes, there were little odd details with him that weren't important but very strange.

5 years after I moved in, Alexis died. The police found his body rotting in his basement after they got a complaint of a horrible smell coming from his house. I was sad after that. He wasn't my only friend but he was the only one I could trust and the only one that could really understand me. He commited suicide. He was hanging from a rope when they found him. That made it even worse. I thought I had restored his happiness by giving him company. Apparently it wasn't the case.

After I saw the lights coming from the police cars, I went to investigate. That's when I heard the news. The police officers asked me all kinds of questions. I was pretty much the only one to interrogate since I was Alexis's only friend.

The police concluded it was a suicide pretty quickly. He was in a state of decomposition when they found him but there were visible marks on his body. A mark on his neck from the rope but also cuts on his stomach and arms, deep cuts. The police didn't pay attention to this crucial piece of information. They didn't seem to want to find the cause of his death. Two days later, it was declared he had killed himself, almost like the police wanted to move on and forget that case. My sense of hearing caught something truly bizarre when the police were asking me questions. I heard the detective say "I don't understand, the cuts on his chest are the same his wife had when they found her, the exact same, I'm not sure if I want to understand after all."

Because he had no family and no friends, I got everything he had. His money, car and house. I sold everything except the house. I wanted to inspect it and renovate it before selling it. That's what I did. I hired someone to inspect everything and to make sure the house is clean. Everything was going fine until he told me there was a strange smell coming from the basement. I went in there with him to find the source of that odor. It didn't take long. The horrible scent guided us to the corner room where there were pipes and the water heater.

The door was wide open, I never went to the basement after his death so it was a surprise. It was more than wide open, the door was barely attached and the wood was broken. There was a big hole on the side of it and a part of the wall had been damaged too. The light in the room was broken. There were glass shards everywhere. I brought a f;ashlight and we started looking around. To my surprise, there were no pipes and certainly no water heater. There was debris on the floor, a plate with a brown substance and chains. The smell probably came from the plate. I grabbed it and threw it in the trash before washing my hands.

After the inspection, I used the money I got from selling all Alexis's belongings to renovate the whole house. I could do it by myself since I'm a construction worker but I was seriously overwhelmed with a sense of danger in that house. I paid a good friend of mine that worked at the construction company to do the job with me. Everything went well until we got to the basement.

It was old and dirty, it smelled like cat piss if I'm gonna be honest. Alexis clearly did a bad job at cleaning it but I can't blame him. He had to endure so much. We demolished the walls of the room to create a big one room basement. My coworker looked very stressed out.During the basement renovation, he had a weird look on his face and was shaking. He would sometimes drop his tools or spill his water. Eventually he left and never came back, claiming he was sick and needed a break. 

I decided it was best to sell the house like it was at that moment. Nobody was gonna help me with it anyway. People seemed to never talk about Alexis, even when he was alive, I would mention him in conversations and people would find excuses to get out and leave. They were certainly not gonna go into his house. I sold it as a finished two story house with an unfinished basement. A young couple with a 3 months old daughter moved in quickly enough. They seemed happy to get this house for such a small price. Because of the unfinished basement, I lowered the price quite a bit. Johnny Roger, the young dad, said it wasn’t a problem and that he would find time to renovate it himself and transform it into a storage basement for his hunting equipment. 

One thing I have to mention is that our street was surrounded by woods and Alexis’s property had a big part of the forest. It was perfect for the couple, one reason why they moved in so quickly. 

After a month had passed, I was woken up by a knock on the door. It was Johnny. He asked me if people normally went on Alexis’s property. I told him it was very rare and he explained that he saw a man in the forest while he was setting up a tent. The man was far away and the trees were hiding him so it could have been anyone, Johnny tried to call out the person but he ran away. I reassured him by telling him it was probably just teens trying to make a bad joke by trying to scare him.

The next week, it continued, he would come to my house at random hours of the day while I wasn't working and complain about noises or dark figures in the woods. I was fed up with this disturbance so I told him to meet up at his house at 11PM.

He greeted me with the weirdest smile ever. I could sense something wasn’t right by looking at his watery eyes. We sat on plastic chairs and looked at the forest from his backyard. That reminded me of the time I spent with Alexis. I tried to not get overcome with sadness and nostalgia and got up and told Johnny to go into the woods to check if anything is out of the ordinary. He clearly didn’t want to but agreed anyway since he needed answers. It was calm, a bit too calm. I wasn’t hearing any crickets or any birds. The tall dark trees stood there like silent observers watching us venture into the forest. Then, it became even more quiet. Johnny had stopped moving. I didn’t hear the branches breaking under his feet anymore. I called out his name then I turned around and saw him. He was frozen in place looking at the distance without making a sound. I silently joined him and looked at where he was staring. 

-It’s not a man, he whispered  
-What do you mean ?

There was a small clearing 200 feets away from us. The moon shined at the moss and what was standing on the moss. It must have been 8 feet tall. I think we made too much noise because it turned its head and looked at us. Its body was hairy and his face covered in scars. Its eyes were two black spots illuminated by the gentle light. It had enormous teeth coming out of its mouth. It had claws and I could see a dark substance on them. The thing that surprised me the most were the broken chains at its wrists. Just like the ones in Alexis’s basement.
