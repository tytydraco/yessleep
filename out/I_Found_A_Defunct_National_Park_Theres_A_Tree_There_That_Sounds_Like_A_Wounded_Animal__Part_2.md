Part 2

I tend to think of this situation in terms of how our brains will sometimes forcibly hide certain memories to keep the conscious mind safe from its trauma. Similarly, when faced with something as unnatural and unholy as the tree, the human soul is at first mesmerized by it, but then utterly rejects its existence, like how an ant instinctively buries its peers if they smell the pheromones of death on them. 

And those soul-instincts served me well for the better part of a year. Yet still, something continued to stir in the back of my mind. Call it my relentless, self-destructive curiosity, or perhaps the subtle influences of whatever attached to my mind, I don’t really know. There were a few times during that period when I would go down a rabbit hole about defunct National Parks, looking for signs of any such parks that closed under suspicious circumstances. I never found anything of course, just like Harbinger had claimed. 

On a few occasions, I even tried to explain my experiences to Karah in a way that didn’t make me look completely insane. It happened when she would come over to my place and ask why all my windows were so thickly covered, or why I was so against going out with her at night. To say the least, I quickly learned that explaining it in a sane sounding way was an impossibility. She would inevitably ask for proof, but there’s no way I can dig that up again, and absolutely no way in a billion years would I take her to the tree itself. My very soul wouldn’t let me.  

I think that’s why, almost a year after my trip to Crying Tree National Park, I’d had enough of waiting. I think I felt that my mind had healed up to the point that I could face the Powers once more, and find the closure I knew I needed. After eleven months of sleeping and working in the corner of my room as far away from that window as I could get, one night at around midnight, I tore off the blankets and sheets obscuring my view after having heard the first words from that ‘tree’ in English:

“Come back to the window. We miss you.” 

And there they were, unmoved, and unchanging, and continuing to stare directly at me from the depths of the cosmos. All at once, those unspeakable emotions from that day eleven months ago flooded back into my subconscious from the dam I had built from deliberate distraction and medication. 

I whimpered softly at first, “What…is…that…tree?”

They remained still as ever, and no form of communication, verbal or otherwise, issued from them whatsoever. 

I was infuriated…all the torment I had been suppressing, for months, all for them to say nothing. I then screamed at them in rage:

“WHAT IS IT? WHAT IS THE TREE? WHAT ARE YOU? DO YOU ENJOY MY SUFFERING?”

Almost immediately, I saw a blue glow down the hall behind me, followed by a monotonous, feminine voice. It was my alexa.

“The Crying Tree first appeared in Shawnee oral tradition in the earliest days of their existence, suggesting that it’s been there for much longer.”

I had seen too much at this point to be surprised, but I at least understood how this was going to work. And honestly, I was insulted by their answer, I effectively knew this already. In any case, I went to grab my alexa and brought it to my room, setting it on my bed. Again I reverently approached the window and inquired again:

“I already know about that. I mean…what actually is it?”

The alexa promptly spoke up again:

“The Crying Tree is a branch of your world’s Knowledge Seed. ”

Intrigued, I probed, “Knowledge Seed?”

“Every world holding sentient life appears to have one. They are the reason why their civilizations exist.”

I remembered that the tree had told me something similar to that when it attached to my mind, but I had long forgotten it at that point. I continued:

“How many are there…I mean…those things…like the Crying Tree? Like, on Earth?”

The Powers paused, seeming to consider the question. Then alexa came back to life:

“Your civilization began with a branch located in Mesopotamia, now at the bottom of the Persian Gulf. Your ancestors ate from it, and became wise, as you have, even if now you have tried to reject it.”

Okay…? That wasn’t really my question, but interesting…I guess.

I persisted, “So…why can I see you now?”

They were silent for a long while, and there was a charge in the air, a potential, like they were discussing something in thoughts deeper than words. And the alexa pinged once more:

“Unknown” Quickly followed up by, “We know not where they come from.”
Still probing for a clear answer to my questions, I posed:

“So then…what are you?”

And they never responded to that inquiry. The alexa went silent, and the Powers remained still, frozen as ever, like pillars holding up the universe itself. I made sure to take notes of everything they said, and spent the next several hours just thinking about what it could all mean. But eventually, I came to this realization: that whatever was going on here, it became clear that I would be infinitely powerless to stop it or change its course, so why worry about it? Why risk my own mind again for the pursuit of greater knowledge. I think I understood what the Powers were talking about when mentioning my ‘ancestors’ who ‘became wise’, and that’s exactly why I wasn’t going to continue down this path. The absolute best place it could lead me is to a place of utter despair at my sheer insignificance in this vast cosmos.

So that’s exactly what I did. I kept the notebook where I wrote the words of the Powers, as well as things that I heard from the tree, or whatever part of it had attached to my mind. For several months, I didn’t try burying my knowledge of it all like I had done before, but at the same time, I wasn’t going to actively pursue it. 

But… that’s not where this story ends. Of course it isn’t. For in the fourth month after my communion with the Powers, I stumbled upon a news story about an event that had taken place the day before.

A marine biologist from North Carolina, who was in critical condition after coming into contact with what she believed to be deep-sea mushrooms found in a reef a few miles off the Outer Banks. Physically it seemed she was fine. But inexplicably, she went to psychological rehab after the encounter in her own laboratory. I had a hypothesis of my own, and I don’t think I need to explain what I was thinking. 

About a month later, I went searching for her. Apparently, she worked as a professor at UNC, so she was actually fairly easy to find. I simply set up an appointment, disguised as a professional inquiry about some niche detail from a paper written by her a few years ago.

Her office was in a rather plain building, literally down the hall from where the incident supposedly happened. Dr. Vale herself was a shorter woman in her mid 40s, with long, fading brown hair and squared glasses. She sat there in her office, frantically sorting through papers and inputting information into her desktop. It took a few seconds for her to notice me, but when she did, she promptly adjusted her glasses and greeted me. 

“Ah, Mr. Hasting, was it?” 

“Yes,” I responded, “it’s a pleasure to finally meet you, doctor.”

She shrunk in her chair, clearly not liking to be called by titles like that, and she continued promptly:

“Please…have a seat! So I hear you’re interested in the cell-wall microprotein issue, yes?”

I responded to that slowly, “Actually, if you don’t mind, there’s something I want to ask you about first.”

“For sure! What have you got?”

I got straight to the point, “After the event…you know…did you see them? You know…in the sky?” 

She paused mid-pen stroke, and stayed there for a few seconds, not answering me. To fill the silence, I continued:

“I…found this tree out in Kentucky where I live. I touched it and, well, I think it attached to me somehow–”

She looked up, still staring off into space with an almost elated expression and spoke enthusiastically:

“It wasn’t a mental break…I’m…actually seeing them?”

She turned to the window, promptly raised up from her chair, and opened the thick blinds. She stared out into the open daylight, and shook her head slightly in disbelief. She pointed and said:

“So…you can see them too?”

I joined her at the window and admitted:

“No, I can only see them at night, I guess my eyes are just bad.”

That wasn’t a lie. I know my eyes have always been suboptimal, but I guess I could never be bothered to get that fixed. 

“Try focusing for a second or two.” She suggested.

I did, and it turned out that I could just barely make out the vaguest sillhouette of the closest of the Powers, just a slight discoloration in the expanse of the sky.

“Yeah, I can kind of see it when I focus.”

“It’s fascinating, isn’t it?” She continued, “They appear to reflect visible light, yet no one else can see them.”

“What do you think they are?” I inquired just to see if she got any further than I did.

“No idea…” she sighed defeatedly, “...but it feels like they’re constantly…just…staring at me. Like they’re trying to tell me something. Do you feel that?”

That felt familiar, “They can’t, or at least don’t, communicate directly. I think they use the physical world to speak for them–”

“So you’ve spoken with them?” She asked in fascination.

“Yeah…kind of. They’re extremely vague, though.”

She continued her line of inquiry, “Well…how did you do it?”

“You…just ask them.” I explained carefully, trying hard not to insult her intelligence.

She blushed, realizing the obviousness of my answer, and apparently, she hadn’t tried that. I don’t blame her though. It was an interesting line of conversation, but I really wanted to know more about her contact with the Knowledge Seed. 

Changing the subject, I asked, “So, this all happened after your contact with the fungus at the bottom of the ocean, right? What do you think they have to do with those things outside?” 

She pondered for a second, then pointed down the hall and said softly, “Just…follow me.”

From that point, it was clear where she was going to take me…to the laboratory where the ‘mushrooms’ were being stored. I hesitated for several seconds in her office as she walked out. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to see one of those things again. If it was another thing like the tree, I knew there was a chance that I could easily undo all the healing that I gained over the past year…all in a moment. But I also assumed that, if she was comfortable unveiling this thing again for herself, it would probably be fine for me as well.

We walked together to a door at the very end of the hall to the right. First, there was a sanitation room where I was decontaminated and given some safety glasses, gloves, and a mask to keep everything sterile. When we were both equipped, she confidently punched her code into the door’s keypad, and I heard an automatic lock unlatch, and the door opened. 

The inside of the lab was more plain than I anticipated, it looked more like a doctor’s office, shelves everywhere with a few mundane pieces of equipment on the table. But the one thing that immediately caught my eye as odd was a large, metal plate on the wall. It appeared that there was a grid of circles on the plate, like a morgue composed of miniature samples. I wasn’t too far off. In reality, it was a storage area for core samples. She explained:

“We used an ROV to collect a core sample from the inside of the fungus, and we’re now storing it here. Hold on just a second.”

She produced a key, which unlocked one of the core samples close to the center of the grid. She pulled it out, a foot-long, cylindrical tube filled with tan-grey, porous matter, similar to a mushroom, but much larger.

With almost reverent caution, she carried it to one of the tables, and began making some observations:

“It looked dead at first glance, like you would expect. I mean, it’s been cored out of the organism, but look here–” She pulled up a large magnifying lens, which made her concern abundantly clear. The sample was made up of thousands of intertwining fibers, and they were all twitching in microscopic movements, almost like a mass of worms. She shook her head slowly:

“Whatever it is, it’s not a fungus by any metric other than visible. I haven’t quite pinpointed its means of digestion, but it keeps eating through the tempered glass core holder, even in this mutilated state. Just…look at this.”

She led me to another table, where there was a microscope with a thin sample from the core already on the stage. She turned it on, focused on the sample, and asked me to look. 

What I saw was a microscopic field of hollow circles of different sizes, there were smaller specks moving between them, forming a chain of transport between them.

“Are these it’s cells or something?” I asked

“That’s just the problem: they look like cells, just not fungus cells. They look more similar to animal cells or some kind of archaea or protist. But even then, they don’t match perfectly to any known species on earth. But…look at this.” She trailed off in a shaky tone.

She grabbed a test tube containing some kind of yellow powder suspended in oil, placed a miniscule drop of it on the sample, and bid me to look again saying:

“This is a high-concentration solution of A. Campestris spores, the fungus that this sample is ‘supposed’ to look like. Now look at what happens to the sample’s cells.”

When I looked down the microscope, there was nothing at first, just the spores interspersed between the thing’s cells. But then suddenly, the nano-scale ‘messengers’, I called them, broke formation in their unending transport between the cells, surrounding the spores and breaking them apart. They carried what looked like tangled knots of stringy material from the spores like a colony of ants moving food back to their home. These strings were absorbed by the parent cells, and they immediately began changing shape, all of them. The thing’s cells elongated and seemed to connect to each other in rigid tunnels of fleshy biomaterial. Then, out of nowhere, all the movement ceased, and when I looked back at the sample outside of the microscope, it was no longer twitching, but completely still and firm like any slice of mushroom I had ever seen.

Without having time to process what I had just seen, she pulled the slide off the microscope stage and, throwing it in the biohazard containment, grabbed another slide containing a sample of the not-fungus and grabbed a new phial from the adjoining table. It was a container just like the previous one, but it appeared to contain darkly-tinted blood. Then she told me:

“You might want to brace yourself if you’re squeamish.”

I thought as much, seeing clearly where this was going. She took a new dropper and, placing a drop of the blood on the slide, again gestured for me to look under the microscope. At first, there was a similar effect. The nano-messengers left their course and attached onto the blood cells, and extracted a stringy material from the center of each cell, carrying it back to the parent cells. It took longer to process the material, which at this point I assumed to be genetic material. But this time, the cells began expanding, first slowly, then rapidly. Not replicating like normal cells, just…expanding to unnatural sizes without bursting. Dr. Vale pulled me away from the microscope forcefully as I gazed upon the grotesque spectacle taking place outside of the microscope. The sample bulged into a fleshy, fizzing orb about the size of a grape, which formed itself into the shape of a tiny, hairless mouse which tried to move on the table using worm-like filaments attached to its body like a puppet, but being controlled from the inside. It twitched like the tree and the fungus did, but then suddenly went still and lifeless. 

Dr. Vale then grabbed a scalpel, and cut its tail off, which caused me to tense up violently at first, until I realized what I was actually looking at. The inside of the tail didn’t appear to be made up of muscle, but mushroom flesh. Then, dissecting the rest of the poor thing, she demonstrated in detail that I don’t want to recall here that the inside of the thing was a strange mixture of mouse parts and mushroom parts. Then she spoke up at last:

“It’s like the organism can copy the outer phenotypes of creatures it comes into contact with…and remember them, even across distances and between different samples. Clearly, it gets confused, though, when it comes to its understanding of internal structures and relationships between different organisms. Almost like an AI trying to understand and interact with its surroundings. 

I was never scientifically inclined, but I think I understood enough about the situation to start putting things together about what I had seen. I started:

“That…that’s–”

“But there’s one other thing.” she interjected, “I performed a mass spectroscopy test on the organism. Or, at least, that’s what I called it at first. According to the tests, it’s composed of…well…65% Silicon, 18% Antimony, 15% Boron…and only 1% carbon, with some other trace elements.”

I felt a chill course down my back as I realized what that could mean. I heard the words repeat in my mind…65% Silicon. Silicon, as in…no.

“You mean…it’s not really alive?”

“Yes,” she said solemnly, “by all physical accounts, it’s a machine. Artificial, but technologically on a scale unprecedented by any human achievements. This discovery…it could upend everything we know about the world we live in, about history, about…everything!” She almost became giddy when she spoke. No longer terrified, but enthralled by the thing. 

She continued on about the implications of the discovery, but I tuned her out about halfway through, because there was something…some single note of dissonance in this whole orchestra of thought. Then it came to me:

“Wait…you said all it needs to do is come into contact with an organism to copy or, at least, attempt to copy its appearance. But…you touched it, right?…why didn’t it try to copy you?”

She paused, inhaled sharply, then admitted:

“It did.”

She made her way to another door on the opposite side of the lab where we entered. This time, she swiped a keycard and entered the room, beckoning me to enter. There was another sanitation room, but this room evidently required even greater protection. There were six hazmat suits hanging in the sanitation room, and we both covered ourselves with them, sealing us off entirely from the outside world. Our suits were sterilized with powerful UV light, then we were permitted to enter. The room was pitch dark and appeared, ironically, much less sanitary than the main lab, stains on every surface and smelling strongly of chlorine even through the thick suit. And that’s when I noticed that the majority of the room’s floor area was occupied by a large, circular pool in the middle of the concrete, windowless room. Dr. Vale turned on a portable work light in the corner, which illuminated the reason why she brought me into this room. There was something floating, face down, in the water. 

Its silhouette looked identical to Dr. Vale, but it was just wrong enough to know it wasn’t her. Its hair was replaced by a few strands of what looked like rotting plant matter, and its skin looked more akin to whale blubber than actual skin…and it wasn’t twitching. Then she explained herself:

“I managed to unintentionally capture it after my return to the office from rehab. It was already long dead, but apparently it was just wandering in this room for days, scratching at different surfaces…trying to find a way out. I assumed it was unintelligent on account of the fruitless attempts to scratch through the concrete constantly until it died, but…then I realized something. The scratches follow a pattern…”

She pointed to a table where the thing had scratched at.

“They’re not random…it’s some kind of script, but it doesn’t map to any language I could find.”

She was right. Looking down at the table, even my untrained eyes could tell the repeating patterns were meant to convey some kind of meaning. There were combinations of circles and two-dimensional shapes I had no words to name, repeating and recombining in ways that felt logical, but the meanings of which were far past me. Despite that, I took vigorous notes, detailing every pattern, every combination, everything. Even if I couldn’t translate this, I could still try. She didn’t want me taking any pictures (fair enough), so this was the next best thing I could do. 

We spent the next several hours discussing details of our respective encounters with the Knowledge Seed. I shared everything I knew with her, and she shared all the rest of her research with me. The rest of her information wasn’t vitally important, just interesting corroborating details. She spoke about vague reports of similar events from both ancient history and the modern day, and it became clear to us that we weren’t the first ones to encounter this new reality. Though, by this point, I had gathered as much from Harbinger.

When the time came to say goodbye, it was already past dark, and having exhausted all of our collective knowledge, we went our separate ways and promised to stay in touch and share any potential breakthroughs. 

It was around 9:00 PM when I began my five hour drive back home. Somehow, I managed to make it back despite being desperately tired and constantly distracted by the incomprehensible silhouettes in the heavens above. That is, until, at one point, I was about halfway back home and it was almost midnight. The area was much like the area near my home, but more winding and dark for lack of development. The road on this part of the drive had clearly not been refreshed this decade, and it was starting to look more like a cobblestone path than asphalt. The area was completely devoid of any other people at this hour, but it felt oddly claustrophobic because of the towering trees and steep cliffs that would appear and sink back throughout the drive. Then suddenly, as I turned a corner, someone was in the middle of the road, walking not across it, but toward me. I swerved violently toward the cliffside of the road, not wanting to risk falling off the steep drop on the other side. 

I think I scratched my left rear-view mirror slightly, but nothing terrible. I didn’t get a good look at the person, but looking intently back in my mirrors, they appeared to stop, turn around, and start walking in the direction I was going. Then I turned a corner, and lost it. I thought it was just some strange hitchhiker or backpacker who got lost in the endless woods of this area. It would be miles before that person would find any kind of civilization.

As soon as I thought that, I stopped, precariously turned around, and went back to find the person to see if they needed any help, it would only be  responsible of me to do that.

I covered the several hundred feet I had previously driven in search of the strange person, but there was no sign of them anywhere. Since I could be fairly confident no one else would be driving this path, and so I wouldn’t be in the way, I stopped for a moment to examine my surroundings for any sign of where the guy went. 

I even got out of my car, and called out, hoping to hear something back. I was tired, and by all accounts should not have been driving in the first place, so my better judgement was clouded, and I didn’t fully realize the sheer stupidity of what I was doing. I probably stood outside in the mellow summer’s night air for a good few minutes…until I got a call from Dr. Vale. 

I didn’t expect her to contact me again so quickly, maybe I forgot something important at her office, or she had some amazing development that she couldn’t wait until morning to tell me. So, slightly annoyed, but happy to hear from another human being after two hours of nothing, I picked up the phone. She didn’t even give me time to greet her, and she started promptly with a panicked tone:

“The tree…you touched it. You told me you touched it, right?”

I knew what she was getting at as soon as she said the first two words. I was such an idiot, why didn’t I think about the tree? If these two things, these ‘machines’, are connected, did that mean there was another thing like what Dr. Vale found in that room? She then instructed me: 

“You can’t go home. You have to get as far away from Kentucky as you can right now.” She slowed down as she spoke as if to articulate the point, then sped back up, hyperventilating as if she had just run a good mile, “These things…they connected to our minds…they know where we are at all times. The markings…in the buoyancy room… they all were concentrated in the exact direction of the rehab center…where I was for weeks after the encounter. I don’t think they’re just trying to mimic us…they’re trying to find us.”

And that’s when I heard, down in the shallow valley on the side of the road, and behind a tree a hundred feet or so from my car, the familiar sound of elk crying…just wrong enough to be real.
