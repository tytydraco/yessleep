“What’s so special about ceiling paint?” Laurie wondered, wandering through aisles of Lowe’s. “Wasn’t it just white paint? And for that matter, what was so special about primer? Wasn’t that also essentially white paint?” She parked her cart on the edge of the aisle so she couldn’t possibly obstruct anybody who might wander down the aisle browsing rollers or putty knives before pressing the home button, unlocking her phone. Her search of paints and their specificities pulled her into a world of viscosity and the gradient of sheens available.

“Can I help you find something?” Tibor asked. He had lumbered down the aisle taskless toward Laurie and stopped, just as Laurie had hoped he wouldn’t.

“Thank you so much, but I think I’m all set,” she said, meeting his dark eyes. Tibor’s eyelashes were wet and bold, adding a deer-like sense of youth to his retail-stressed body, belly unsuccessfully shuttered by his red and blue vest and poking over the top of his workpants, like a large pumpkin atop  a tiny bucket.

“What are you painting?” Tibor asked.

“Oh, um, just trying to freshen up the house.”

“Okay. Well if you need help finding anything, I’ll be close by.”

“Thank you. I appreciate it.” Tibor continued down the aisle with uneven steps, as if his right leg were two inches shorter than the left one. A man whirled around the corner and halted, joining them in the paint aisle. The man whistled what sounded like the refrain of Fergie’s *London Bridge* as he tossed a contractor pack of blue painters’ tape into his cart. Tibor disappeared around the corner without acknowledging him. Laurie quickly grabbed a gallon of white primer, a gallon of white ceiling paint, and headed back to the service counter, hoping the attendant had finished mixing her requested color.

As well as her specific can of paint, the attendant handed her the small chip of the wall that she had provided as the color sample. “Thank you so much,” she said, remembering that she also needed some spackling and sandpaper in order to fix the little hole she had chiseled out with a butter knife that morning. She grabbed the last items, checked out, and hurried to her car. The sooner she could get to work, the better.

Laurie didn’t have a tarp, so she cut up some plastic shopping bags and placed them on the floor to protect the carpet from paint. She stirred the primer and tested it out on one of the stains. The blood was still very visible through the coat of primer as it dried, so she worked at the splattered dots, grinding them down with some of the sandpaper. Much better. She finished painting quickly, leaving two hours to dry between coats of primer and paint.

“Not bad,” she said aloud six hours later, admiring the now clean wall. She washed and put away her tools, storing them along with the remainder of the paint. She retrieved a glass of cold water from her kitchen then sat on the floor with her legs crossed in a minute of rest. Now it was time for the hard part. Mark was draped over the toilet, his neck bleeding into the bowl. Laurie had flushed the toilet quite a few times, but it just seemed to fill up again and again. At least he’d be a little lighter to lift once the sun had set and she could transfer his body to the car.

Laurie knew where Mark could go. The landscaping at 3345 Orvis Way was so fresh, so manicured, that nobody would notice that the dark and earthy mulch blanketing the new rose garden was just a couple inches higher than it was the day before. Mark could rest under the roses. Romantic.
