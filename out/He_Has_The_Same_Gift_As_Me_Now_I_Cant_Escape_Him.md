Most of us try and think of ourselves in the best light. We justify our actions, bury the darkest things we’ve done, and choose to remember the good instead. In my experience of seeing people, if I were to place humanity on a scale of black and white (white representing purity and light, black representing chaos and darkness), I would say that most are various shades of grey. You have your light greys- the ones that mostly try and do good, but still fuck up from time to time. You even have the dark greys- the ones that are more self serving and careless, but still have elements of that light in them. 

Very, very rarely do I see the extreme side of the spectrum. You don’t tend to see many true light workers, or even humans that are true dark. 

How do I know this? I have a gift. I can see people’s “shadows” and psychically communicate with them. It takes concentration, of course. I usually have to put myself in a meditative trance and picture their essence. Most of the time, they look like themselves, but perhaps a little distorted with their shadows peeking through. Usually this stems from past trauma, unresolved anger and hurt, jealousy, insecurity… Underneath though, is that *good* that shines through. The part, that deep down, just wants to be loved and understood. For years, I’ve encountered my shades of grey 

There were times where I’ve encountered *dark* though. I’ve encountered people that didn’t have much good in them at all. Only one time, however, did I encounter pitch black. He just so happened to have the same gift as me 

When I first met him, he masked it pretty well. He was charming, caring, and compassionate. He was intelligent and friendly to everyone. He was respected by most. Looking back, he even reeled me in at first. We connected on a special level. I think back to those times and I still feel like I’ve never connected with anyone like I have with him. I just felt *so* drawn to him- like some sort of magnetic pull. We could talk for hours about anything: religion, philosophy, the deeper meaning of everything. I loved his mind and how he seemed above the  surface level and mundane. He was poetic and beautiful. To this day, I still find myself romanticizing his mind. I’ve never met anyone like him, and I doubt that I ever will.  I’ll admit..I even started to become a little obsessed and hooked on his energy. I always felt something a little *off*, but he pulled to me like nobody ever has. 

One day, we became separated in the physical life. We both switched jobs and before I knew it, that was the last I had saw him in person. As much as I tried to move on, that strange pull to him was always in my mind. I missed him *so much*, that I decided to take matters into my own hands as a way to get one last conversation with him. Or at least that’s what I told myself 

I decided to use my gift one day. I started thinking about him and wanted to get a deeper look into him. I wanted to truly understand him on another level. I felt like I had encountered a rare, beautiful, and complex human being. I closed my eyes, put myself in that meditative state, and imagined that he was in front of me 

I immediately saw a version of him that felt very wrong. His eyes were narrowed like a serpent’s, shining almost with a yellow tone. His smile was vicious and cold. Surrounding him was the darkest energy that I’ve ever encountered. He stood over me in an almost predatory stance, like he was waiting for an attack 

He gave me one of his charming smiles. “I thought you would come snooping around eventually.”

I thought nothing of this. In fact, when I see people’s shadows, I tend to communicate with their subconscious level. They’re never usually aware of this, or my intrusion, on a conscious level. 

I confessed my feelings for him. I told him how beautiful I thought he was; how much I enjoyed our talks and his companionship. He gave me a small, amused smirk, but didn’t say much. My concentration broke off and I was disappointed that I couldn’t seem to get very far with him, but I went about my day and tried to get him off my mind 

I attempted again to contact him in that realm. This time, he seemed rather annoyed by my intrusion. Again, I didn’t think much of this. I certainly didn’t think he was *aware* of my creeping into his mind. We chatted like we normally did, until at the end when he stared at me. His gaze became cold, unblinking, and predatory. He slowly gave me that knowing smirk, and everything in me was at full alarm. It just felt *wrong*. All I wanted to do at that moment was break the connection…so I did. After that, I promised myself that I would not further look into his psyche. As intrigued (and possibly obsessed) as I was with him, I couldn’t shake the feeling that he had a very dark layer to him. 

I intended to go about my business and leave him alone… *I really did*. But god…that *pull*. I have never felt anything like it before. My mind slowly became consumed by him. My every thought revolved around him. All I wanted was *him*. His energy and essence became addictive to me. I found myself going back more and more in that trance to get pieces of him. To understand him more, as well as to take whatever I could get of him. Each time I came back, he seemed more and more amused…but also more aggressive. 

The sinister smirks became taunting. The predatory gaze kept creeping closer and closer in his eyes. At times, I would envision myself in his embrace, basking in the feeling of our combined energies…when all of a sudden I’d get a flash of him drawing out a knife to stab me in the back. I would pull away from him, puzzled, but then he would just give me that playful smirk and charm again

My mind was in shambles. I was utterly hooked on him. He was wrapped in my mind, soul, and body. I would touch myself to the thought of only him. I swear I could feel his touch on my body as I orgasmed… 

I realized that I was losing my mind. I knew that I needed to get away from whatever *influence* he had on me. I had never, ever experienced this before in my gifts. Was this some sort of limerence? Was I imagining all of this with my gift? Was it all in my mind? 

I forced myself to stop thinking about him. Like an intrusion, he would creep back into my mind. Uninvited. I would push him out again. That strong *pull* was ever so persistent, but I convinced myself that it was all in my mind and that none of it was real. Somehow, some way, I had confused my gift with some sort of sick fantasy/limerence. 

The further I pushed him out, the *angrier* he became. The visions I had of him became more violent. I would be in the middle of working, and I would get a vision in my mind of him viciously attacking me. I felt a tug at my energy stronger than ever. He began to creep in my mind uninvited, wherever I was. I began to dream about him. In one dream I had, I saw my sleeping body. I was aware that I was in bed asleep, but in the corner of the room was *him*. He was a form of pure, black essence, like the color of midnight. The room seemed to shrink and warp around him. I got an immense feeling of dread, then pure terror as he crept closer. I woke up trembling, trying to convince myself it was only a dream…but the dreams kept coming. Each getting more and more disturbing  

I tried telling myself it was all in my head and I was imagining things. Things just kept on progressing and getting more strange. I was in a constant state of anxiety and fear. Why was this happening to me? 

One day, he crept up uninvited in my mind again. He looked at me with his cold stare, his barely simmering anger just underneath the surface: “You think you’re the only one who can do this? You think you can just creep into my space, then leave and ignore me? You started this”. 

I felt like cold water was dumped all over me. I ran from him again, and I saw him in my mind morphing into some demonic creature laughing behind me. 

I’m still trying to learn to fight him off. I began to envision a shield around me. When he creeps in my mind, I envision a physical barrier and block between us. When he invades my dreams, I try my hardest to not panic and wake up. Sometimes I’m successful, other times I’m not. He successfully strangled me to death in one of my dreams. It’s been years at this point. It’s getting better with time…but he still haunts me to this day. 

Perhaps this is my fault for looking too deep for answers I shouldn’t know. Perhaps it’s my fault for that initial invasion of privacy. I’ve pleaded with him to stop. I’ve begged for forgiveness and expressed my remorse for starting this all those years ago. He only smirks at me with those empty, cruel eyes. 

I once asked him why he’s continuing to do this after all these years. He simply looked at me, with a smile, and said “Because I can”. I don’t know when, and if, he’ll ever leave me alone. I can only hope he’ll lose amusement after some time. In the meantime, I’ve learned to live with it as best as I can.

Until recently. The pull became strong again, almost with as more urgency as ever. I can feel his anger at me attempting to ignore him. It seems as if he’s been getting stronger too, and only more determined…
