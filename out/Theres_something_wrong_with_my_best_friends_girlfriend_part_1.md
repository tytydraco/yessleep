Let me start by giving some context. I met Ryan when we were in high school, and to put it lightly he didn't have many friends. I'd always see him sitting alone and even though I'd join him when I could I knew that that's how he spent most of his time. Needless to say, he didn't have much luck in the dating world and that didn't change after we graduated. 

So,you can imagine my surprise when he told me that he met someone, and they'd been dating. Now, I was suspicious at this. I don't want to say that Ryan is some un-dateable person, but he spent most of his time either at work or holed up in his apartment. 

He told me that he wanted us to meet, and the next time we met up the girl tagged along. I had gotten us a booth at a local restaurant and when they slid into their seat I was a bit worried. She wasn't ugly by any means, but for lack of a better word she looked..sickly. 

She was thin, and looked like she hadn't eaten in days. Her skin stretched over her sharp cheekbones and her eyes looked sunken in. She had this haunting beauty to her, almost like she was more of a ghost than a person. Her hair was long and thick and hung over the sides of her face like curtains. 

She introduced herself as Lily and when she shook my hand she felt frail. Still, there was something about her that made me feel uncomfortable. 

I shot Ryan a look, and he continued talking like he hadn't seen it. Lily spoke few words and mostly nodded along. After a few minutes she excused herself to use the bathroom. 

"Dude, is she okay? She looks sick." 

"What are you talking about? She seems fine to me." 

I scoffed in disbelief. "Are you serious right now? Did you not even look at her?" 

Ryan's eyes darkened and he balled his fists. 

"Don't talk about my girlfriend like that. Are you trying to call her ugly? Leave her alone." 

"What? I never never said that. Chill out." 

Ryan's face relaxed slightly, and he took a sip of his drink. 

"Just don't talk about my girlfriend." 

That's when Lily rejoined us. Now her hair was tucked behind her ears, and her face was still pretty despite the rest. 

"What were you guys talking about while I was gone?" 

"Oh, nothing." I replied, still thinking about the conversation we had just had. Lilys eyebrows furrowed slightly. She spent the next hour staring at me while I tried to avoid her gaze. 

Eventually I made up an excuse to leave. I felt her eyes boring into the back of my head until I reached my car. 

I spent a large chunk of my afternoon thinking about our interaction. I'd never seen Ryan angry, and for him to freak out like that was usually beyond him. Still, I assumed that he just became very attached to her seeing as she was his first girlfriend. That's when I got the text. 

Ryan: we can't talk anymore


Me: what?


Ryan: Lily doesn't approve of you. Sorry. 

I spammed his phone for about an hour with calls and texts, but that was the last message I got. 

I could barely sleep that night. I couldn't believe Ryan would ditch me for a girl he had just met. I'd even tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. 

For the next few days I checked my phone obsessively, hoping for an apology text saying that he was wrong and that they'd broken up. Still, nothing. Eventually I decided to pay him a visit at his apartment. 

I took a deep breath and knocked on his door. After a few minutes had passed I sighed and was turning to go home when I heard the door creak open. Ryan opened the door just a crack and peered out at me. All of the lights in the house were off. 

"Hey, are you okay?" I asked. "What was that text about?" 

"I told you. We can't be friends anymore. Lily said you're a bad influence." His voice sounded tired,like he hadn't slept in days. 

"What the hell are you talking about? We've been friends for years!" I couldn't hide the desperation in my voice. Ryan replied in a monotone voice. 

"It's out of my hands. Sorry." 

Ryan tried to shut the door but I stuck my shoe in the gap, and shoved the door open. He didn't even flinch. 

"You can't just say that after all.." My voice trailed off when I saw the state of him. His hair was a mess and he'd lost more than a few pounds. His eyes had dark circles surrounding them. His face was stuck in this blank expression, like he hadn't heard a word I said. 

That's when Lily appeared from the shadows, hugging her arms around his neck. She looked healthier than when I had first seen her. Her cheeks were now rosy and she looked to be at a healthier weight. Even hair was shinier, like she was in a shampoo commercial. The only indication it was the same girl was her dark, piercing eyes. 

"Baby, what did I say about having guests over?" Her now bright smile almost lit up the dark apartment. I could barely believe she was the same woman I'd met just a week before. 

"Sorry babe." Ryan's eyes never left me, but he looked like he was staring past me, like he was finding something in the distance. Lily's face hardened when I met her piercing gaze. She let go of Ryan to slam the door in my face. 

I stood there for a while, stunned. How could he let her control his life like that? And after everything we'd been through together? 

Then I remembered his distant eyes and frail frame. Had he been eating? I shook my head in disbelief and made my way down to the parking lot. Could he be taking drugs again? When I met him he used to be an addict, but I thought those days had long since passed. I shook my head and made my way downstairs to the parking lot. 

I was just about to unlock my car door when I felt a familiar feeling of being stared at. I whipped my head around, only to be greeted with those dark eyes again. 

"Lily?!" 

She didn't react at all. Lily was standing a few yards away from me, and her whole body twitched slightly, like she could barely contain herself. I shuddered. 

She approached me in long strides and stopped right in front of me. 

"Don't come back here again. Don't speak to Ryan." Her cheerful facade had dissolved, and underneath she felt imposing despite her actual size. 

I couldn't tell you why, but I felt an intense urge to get into my car and drive far away. The more I stared at her face the more I wanted to drop everything and run. 

She stood there for a while, just staring. I didn't dare move. Then, she walked away. I was frozen until I saw her dissappear into the apartment complex. The second I couldn't see her anymore I was gripping my chest. I hadn't even realized I was holding my breath. 

I grabbed my door handle like a lifeline while I tried to catch my breath. I don't even remember the drive home. Next thing I knew I was back in my apartment, and my muscles finally relaxed. 

After a few minutes I wanted to laugh at myself. How did I let a woman almost half my size scare my like that? The whole thing felt so ridiculous that I might have actually started laughing, until the image of Ryan's gaunt face reentered my mind. 

Did he actually relapse? I didn't want to believe it but it seemed like the only viable option. Still, he'd spent years getting out of the behavoirs that were causing his addiction. He almost died back then. It seemed unbelievable that he'd go back to it after so long. 

That's when I heard a notification ding on my phone. I practically jumped on it to check. Sadly, it wasn't Ryan. It was my sister, Reina. 

Reina: come over tomorrow?

Me: sure 

I was a bit excited to vent about the whole thing to somebody I could trust. What I didn't know was that she was going to help me way more than I expected.
