I often go to my local library, it was one of the most relaxing places I can think of, lately something really odd has been happening. I need clarity, I want to know if anyone else has seen what I have. A few days ago on a rainy afternoon I decided I would go to the library, read some old books. There was this woman there, she looked almost like she wasn't a human, something about the proportions of her face and her aura just looked, unreal ? I don't know how else to describe it. Have you ever heard of the Uncanny Valley ? That's what it felt like to me. She stood between the book cases smiling and intermittently looking at me with very few instances of blinking, it's almost like her eyes didn't dry up or become irritated. She was dressed in black with grey hair. I was very puzzled because she just stood there and slowly walked at seemingly random times for over an hour. The Library had a decent number of people but I sat in a quiet and relatively empty area near the back. I picked out a few books, about Bollywood, gardening, cooking and various other things. I was walking back home on that cloudy day and thinking about what that Lady was doing, was it dementia ? I tried to take my mind off of it, looking at the Doves flying around the town. 

The next day I went again, I brought a few books to return, the librarian woman greeted me with a smile and told me about how she hates the rain. Sorry if this sounds insignificant, I really want to remember the details of the past week well. To my suprise, I saw the old lady standing there again in a slightly different spot, it seemed like her smile got bigger. We made eye contact and she pointed at a book beside her. Pulled it out of it's place slightly, she was trying to tell me to get this book. I realized what she was trying to communicate fairly quickly. I stood up and approached her she handed me the book, keeping the same face the whole time and then walked away at a brisk pace. This book has no library tag on it or barcode, I have it in front of me now. It is a very ancient looking red book. There isn't an author listed anywhere on the cover. I read through some of it, I think it's very strange, it says to go to my local church, it gives some confusing steps to summon what it calls the "Giant Inferno". Curiosity killed the cat as they say, I'm going to that Church first thing tomorrow morning and I will continue writing this when I do the ritual. 

The book says the ritual requires me to speak some strange phrases such as "rebirth to the savior of this wicked land", really creepy, bring some paint or ink to write some kind of phrases that seemed like gibberish to me paper and place it next to lit candles. I am going now and when I get back I will tell you how it went and what this is. An update, guys I'm terrified, I don't know how to describe this in a way where you will believe me but I regret reading those poems, I finished the ritual and a portal opened all the way down in between the seats, please don't doubt me, a large deep crimson demon crawled out, I froze for a few seconds, I couldn't move, it had horns, chains, it moaned in a sinister way, I built the courage to run, I don't know what I did, did I create or resurrect some type of curse, I didn't see what happened, the skies have been extra dark lately. I'm trying to find that old lady again and ask her what happened, what was that creature that ascended from that purple portal in the ground. I went to the library and she wasn't there. I looked around town desperately searching for her to get answers, was that dangerous ? Where did it go when I left the building ? I didn't look back until I ran a few blocks, if anyone has any information on this please tell me.
