Today started like any other day—a peaceful awakening and a rare day off from work. By noon, though, I developed the worst migraine of my life. It wasn’t just pain; it felt like pressure, as if something sinister were burrowing into my skull. Seeking relief, I retreated to my room, closing the curtains to create a cold, dark sanctuary. Sleep wouldn’t come. Every time I closed my eyes, a strange awareness stirred in my mind—an eerie sensation that I wasn’t alone.

The silence felt unnatural, too complete, as if the house itself were holding its breath. The shadows on the walls seemed thicker, their shapes too distinct, too deliberate. Every creak of the floorboards made my heart race, though I knew no one should have been moving. I stayed there for what felt like hours, my mind circling between the pain and the unshakable feeling that something was watching me.

When the migraine finally broke, I joined my partner and brother in the living room. Their voices, calm and familiar, grounded me. We watched TV, the flickering light and mindless dialogue offering some comfort. Later, I dozed off on the couch, exhaustion finally overtaking me.

It wasn’t a deep sleep. I hovered in a strange limbo, slipping in and out of awareness. At some point, I felt arms wrap around me, holding me tightly. The embrace was warm, tender even. I almost smiled, thinking it was my partner comforting me. But then, a sound cut through the haze—voices in the kitchen. My partner and brother were chatting, their tones casual and light.

I froze. My breath caught in my throat. If they were in the kitchen, who—or what—was holding me?

The realization hit me like ice water, and as it did, the arms vanished. The warmth turned to a chill that seemed to sink into my very bones. My body tensed as dread crept through me. The room felt heavier, darker, as if something unseen had filled the space around me.

Heart pounding, I called out to my partner, who hurried into the room. He looked at me, confused and concerned. I tried to explain what had just happened, but the words refused to form. It felt as though something had gripped my throat, squeezing the air and the truth from me.

I clawed at my neck, panic rising, but it wasn’t enough. A pressure invaded my mind, like icy tendrils crawling through my thoughts, twisting and pulling. My vision blurred, and my body betrayed me. My eyes rolled back, and the last thing I registered was the cold, hard impact of my head hitting the floor.

In that moment, I wasn’t just afraid—I was certain. Whatever this was, it wasn’t just a presence. It was a warning, a threat.

Then, I woke up.

I bolted upright, gasping for air. The living room was quiet, but the shadows seemed to linger, watching. Shaking, I stumbled into the kitchen, where my partner and brother were still chatting, their conversation unchanged. It was as if no time had passed.

Trembling, I asked my partner, “Were you just in the living room with me?”

“No,” he replied, his brow furrowing. “What’s going on? Are you okay?”

I hesitated. My throat ached as if it remembered the unseen hands that had gripped me. My mind replayed the suffocating darkness, the weight of death pressing down on me, and the cold that seemed to seep into my soul.

“Yeah,” I lied, forcing a shaky smile. “Just a nightmare."
