Hey guys, so I posted part 1 earlier [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/EsvtXW9wxe)

There's been some updates, so I thought I'd leave them here, too.

His apartment felt unnervingly empty. It had been weeks since I’d last visited, and the silence pressed down on me like a weight. The paintings on the walls whispered of passion, and the well-worn furniture held traces of his presence, but everything felt hollow—like the place was waiting for him to come back. I couldn’t help but wonder: had he left, or had something else happened? For a brief, sickening moment, I feared he’d ended it all.

Sitting on his bed, I tried to shake the feeling. The room was quiet, too quiet, and I felt like a trespasser. I flipped through his journal again, hoping to distract myself. The last entry I’d read was dated October 3rd, but it wasn’t the final one. A newer entry was scrawled on the pages—Halloween night. The words were jumbled, almost incoherent, as if he’d written them in a frenzy.

He was still fixated on the streamer. The notes mentioned some kind of riddle, but they didn’t make much sense to me. My stomach churned as I wondered if he’d left to meet her. I’d assumed he met people through his art galleries, but this felt… different. Dangerous.

When I showed the journal to Mom, she suggested calling the police. They came by, took a quick look around, and asked a few questions. They weren’t worried. He was an adult, they said, and adults sometimes disappear for a while. I told them this wasn’t like him, but their reassurances felt hollow.

After they left, I was alone again, surrounded by my brother’s absence. It hit me, then, how heavy this all was. No one else would fix this. If I wanted answers, I’d have to find them myself.

I took his journal and his laptop back to my apartment. The laptop was ancient, slow to boot up, but I hoped it might hold some clue. While I waited, I turned back to the journal, flipping to an entry written two days after his last text to me.

How does she keep me interested for thirty minutes talking about her cat? I don’t even like cats. But it’s her. She’s so genuine, so real. I’ve never seen anyone like her."
>"She posed a riddle during the stream:
‘I dance on the wind, but I have no feet.
I’m bright as the sun, yet I bring no heat.
I vanish at dawn, but return with the night.
What am I, a mystery cloaked in light?’"
>"The answer came to me instinctively, and I typed it into the chat. My heart raced, thinking she wouldn’t notice. But she did. Caitlin smiled and read my name aloud, congratulating me for being the first to get it right. She asked for my real name, and I told her. She repeated it back, and for a moment, it felt like she was speaking directly to me."

I slammed the journal shut, uneasy. He’d always been a little eccentric, but this sounded like obsession. Caitlin seemed to have him wrapped around her finger. What kind of streamer asks for someone’s real name in front of thousands of viewers?

The laptop finally booted up, its ancient fan whirring like it might give out at any moment. While it struggled to load, I flipped forward in the journal to another entry.

>"My mind is on fire. Caitlin reminds me of the joy I wanted to capture as a child—the moments that made me feel alive. I can feel those memories again, and now I know what I need to do.She mentioned on stream that she’s opening a P.O. Box for gifts. She asked for something meaningful. The chat was ridiculous—people suggesting flowers, candies, meaningless trinkets. But her riddle made it clear what she really wanted:
>‘I fade with the sun, yet I’m bright as the day.
I’m held in your heart, but I can’t stay.
I’m found in laughter, in dreams that ignite.
What am I that dances and takes to flight?’"
>"The answer came to me immediately. I searched through old boxes Mom gave me and found it—the perfect gift. The original. She’ll love it."

I sat back, staring at the page. “The original?” What the hell was that supposed to mean? I had no idea what he’d sent her, but I felt a growing dread in my chest.

I rummaged through my own boxes, digging for answers. Mom had kept the usual childhood trinkets: a blanket, a teddy bear, some baby teeth in a jar (why does every mom do that?), but nothing stood out. Whatever my brother had sent Caitlin, it was something special to him.

And something told me I wasn’t going to like it.
