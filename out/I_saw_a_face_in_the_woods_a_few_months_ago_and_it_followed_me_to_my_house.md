To start off, i'm not one of those professional joggers. You'll never see me in spandex with a water bottle running laps. I only do a few miles down a path behind my house a few nights a week for the fresh air, it's peaceful and I usually won't see another person the whole time.

The path behind my house is one of those worn down, dirt paths surrounded by trees that outlines the town. It's got a few benched here and there, in the day it even has a few kids cycling down and people walking their dogs. 

The first occurance was a few months ago, after a frustrating day I tried to clear my head with a good jog. I was about halfway through listening to spotify on shuffle when I saw them, an outline by the edge of the trees, just standing there. At first I thought maybe it was a junkie, as I got closer I started to make out more details about them, they wore nothing too unsual, a black hoodie and cargos but what really caught my attention was their face.

 Or rather, what was covering it.

They wore a mask, it faintly glowed in the dark. Before I got to them I watched the outline move into the trees and I lost them. A bit unnerved I decided to cut the jog short and head back home.

  


I went back the next night, a stupid decision looking back I know. 

But I wanted to proove to myself that I was over-reacting, just paranoid. I even did the shorter trail and brought a flashlight. 

What good that did. 

At first nothing out of the ordinary, I actually convinced myself i'd just seen a crazy person and I'd be fine. About halfway down the trail though, my flashlight started flickering and cut out completely, I gave it a few short whacks with my hand but it didn't turn on. 

Then, in the dark I heard a laugh. The kind of laugh that comes from a creepy old man that you'd expect to hear in a dark alleyway, raspy and low. I couldn't place where it was coming from, then I saw it.

 Just behind the tree line watching me. Barely visible if not for the faint glow. As my flashlight flickered back to life I bolted. I don't think I've ever ran so fast in my life and I didn't stop until I got home.

 I slammed the door and didn't sleep at all.

I stopped jogging for a few weeks after that, I tried to convince myself nothing happened. Whenever I mentioned it to my friends they just made jokes about me being stoned or paranoid.

To keep in shape I started going to the gym instead, I thought if I just didn't walk the trail for a while I could forget about it and be done with this. 

I thought I was fine, until a few nights ago.

 I'd woken up around 1am for no apparent reason...

  


 It wasn't until I heard that same laugh that I went from being half-asleep to wide awake in an instant. 

It wasn't coming from outside.

I sat still and silent in the dark of my room for what felt like hours, it wasn't until I heard the quiet sound of scraping outside my bedroom door that I flicked the lights on.

  


 It stopped instantly.

But I didn't sleep, I spent the rest of the night staring at the door, convincing myself it's in my head. I finally got the courage to leave my room not long before lunch time, as I turned to see my door I saw deep scratch marks stretching the length of it.

After searching my house, I found nothing. A breathed a sigh of relief and this time made sure to lock every door and window. 

When I got home from work I was horrified, laid under my door were a pile of dead birds. They had been mutilated, like roadkill picked up and put in a pile. I swore that if anything else happened i'd call the cops. That night I slept with a kitchen knife under my pillow.

I say slept, I really just waited in fear...

This time, around 4am something changed. In the air, it was faint at first, the smell of something burning. As it got stronger it was overwhelming, burnt hair. I hadn't even realised my bedroom door opened until it was too late. Before I know it I couldn't breathe, something was ontop of me. In the dark of my room all I could see was the face, I felt a shredding fire through my neck as I grabbed my knife and sliced blindly in the air desperate. More burning spread down my chest and arms before a violent hit to the head knocked me out.

I woke up in the hospital yesterday where I'm writing this. The doctors called it a "rabid animal attack" even when I told them what I saw they claimed it was just me mis-remembering it.

 I have these nasty claw marks down my arm and chest.

I don't know how I survived, I must have hit it. My brother says I can stay with him for a while.
