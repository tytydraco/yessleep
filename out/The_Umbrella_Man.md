You run as fast as your shoes will propel you, trying to escape the rain. It happened so suddenly. Well, not so sudden, actually. You knew it was going to rain, but you played video games at your best friend’s just a little longer than you were supposed to. You should’ve brought that umbrella your mom told you to take. You didn’t listen.

Now, as the rain comes down in sheets, thick enough to obscure your vision, you think you see a silhouette. Maybe it’s someone you know. Maybe they’re calling out to you. You push through the wall of rain in front of you, heading toward the figure. But as you approach, you realize it’s not who you thought it was at all.

This person—an old man—is holding an enormous umbrella. It has an old-money look to it, like a fancy antique. The red canopy of the umbrella almost encapsulates him, keeping his fragile frame, covered in a trench coat, bone dry. Not a drop of rain has touched him, which should be impossible with the way the rain is pouring down. But here he is.

The rain pounds against you, soaking you to the bone, like a stray dog with nowhere to hide. The old man reaches out his arm, his skeletal fingers gesturing for you to come in, underneath his umbrella. Out of the cold, wet rain. You shiver. It would be nice to get out of this downpour. He is so dry. You could be too. He’s just an innocent old man offering to share his umbrella.

So you step under its protection. Safe from the rain, but stepping further from safety than you realize.

The Umbrella Man walks away, down the street, as the rain dies down. Water pours into the gutter with a reddish tint, and sitting in the street is a single shoe, filling with rain.

I pause to let the tension build, then give Jason a slight nod at the back of the classroom. I watch as he releases his thick history textbook, letting it fall through the air and impact the ground with a loud slapping sound. Everyone in the room jumps, and two girls in the front of the class let out simultaneous screams.

Mrs. Henry’s eyes shoot over toward Jason, but before she starts, I continue my essay. “Every kid in Cloudridge has heard of the Umbrella Man, and if you hadn’t before, then you have now. I don’t know where the story originated, but it is part of this town’s history—or should I say mystery.” I can’t help but chuckle. I thought I was pretty clever when I wrote that. “So, to end, don’t forget your umbrella. And if you do, and you find yourself face to face with an old man holding a red umbrella, you’re better off just running home in the rain!”

I look over to Mrs. Henry as I finish. She is sitting back in her chair, not at all amused. “The report was supposed to be on the history of the town, Matthew. This Umbrella Man has nothing to do with that, and as for you, Jason, not funny.” She pauses. “I will give it to you, though. It was very creative.”

She gestures me back to my seat, and as I turn toward Jason, he’s rocking two thumbs up and chuckling lightly.

“Dude, that was perfect,” he says as I sit down, and we high-five.

Thunder booms outside, rattling the windows. I look out to see, as no surprise, that it’s raining. It’s always raining in Cloudridge—probably where the name came from. The rain is really coming down, and as I go to turn away from the window, I think I see a glimpse of red following a dark silhouette. But when I turn back, there’s nothing. I jump in my seat, startled as Jason’s hand slugs my shoulder.

“Matt, did you hear a thing I said?”

I snap myself out of the ridiculous paranoia. “No, man, I’m sorry. What’s up?” I ask, turning to Jason, but I can’t shake the weird feeling I have.
