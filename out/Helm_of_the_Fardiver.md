Helm of the Far-Diver

‘Aisling, have you actually listened to a single fucking thing she’s said?’

Aisling’s friend Orla asked her the question with all the thinly veiled cattiness of her new friends - the girls that she was slowly but surely ditching Aisling for. They congregated at the other side of the mob of classmates, squashed up against the exhibit on human evolution deep within the varnished wooden halls of the Scáth Gleann Museum.

It had been happening for quite some time now, these moments of cattiness. Orla had been Aisling’s only friend since they had started secondary school together, and the two had felt as if they could take on whatever school could throw at them, followed by college and life itself beyond. The two would daydream, making grandiose plans for the things they would accomplish. Idle teenage fancies of success and fame, with no true thought put into them, daydreams which would become painfully clear had no place in the real world. Worlds away from expectant teachers, strict parents and judgmental classmates.

It used to be easy to daydream like that around Orla. In a world that seemed fake and disappointing, their dreams were as real to them as the air they breathed.

Orla didn’t daydream anymore. She had been stricken with the dream-killing disease: the fear of missing out. She never took her eyes away from the more popular girls for fear of missing even a fleeting opportunity to curry favour with them with vapid bloviations on Love Island or whatever other shite they were into that week.

Between needful glances in their direction, Orla had been picking fights over the most asinine things, things which they both knew were just excuses for Orla to eventually jump ship once she had worked up the nerve.

‘Take a guess, Orla.’

Unable to stomach Orla’s anxious glances, she turned her gaze towards the museum exhibits before them.

‘That one’s a… caveman.’ she said, as she pointed lazily at a Neanderthal. ‘And that one’s… also a caveman.’ She turned to look at Orla with a chipper smile that did not reach her eyes. ‘Not sure on the names but all of them are as fake and boring as your cool new friends. So why don’t you go and be fake and boring with them, and leave me the fuck alone, yeah?’

Orla looked at her with an expression that was at once deeply hurt, but also relieved. She considered responding, but walked away wordlessly with heavy steps.

‘Go get em, whoo!’ cheered Aisling in a whisper, her venom felt by those within earshot as they grimaced with second-hand embarrassment.

Aisling turned and allowed her smile to fade, while the popular girls cast judgmental glances and mocking smiles. She stood and looked into the eyes of humanity’s ancestors, their murky eyes uneven and their hair as bristly as a discount store brush.

*Fake and boring.*

She began to drift away again, dreaming of what it must have been like to live in ancient times. Would she have been valued then? Would she have had a place? Even now the school tour sauntered away and left her behind, either not realising or caring that she was absent.

‘Boring, isn’t it?’ came a voice from beside her.

A well-dressed man in his late thirties stood beside her, hands clasped as he stared idly at the exhibit with her. She didn’t hear him approach while she was lost in her reverie.

‘I tried to make it as interesting as possible to look at but… the youth of today are seldom interested in what came before us.’

He seemed to snap himself out of a daydream of his own, before offering his hand to her.

‘I’m the owner, pleased to meet you.’

Aisling shook his hand.

‘Aisling, nice to meet you. It’s not that bad honestly - I’m just having a bad day.’ she gave a weak smile as she realised briefly that she could not recall the last good day she had had.

‘No need to be so polite - it’s an awful exhibit, I know. They can never quite get the eyes right, can they?’

He asked those words with a strange sincerity and an amused exhale, referring to the eyes as if they were the subject of some private joke.

‘As I said, the youth of today are seldom interested in what has been before us humans… they are more so interested in what *could* have been.’

‘What could have been? I’m not quite sure I follow.’ inquired Aisling.

‘For all these exhibits we have… in every museum on the planet… all our collective knowledge and theories on the origin of our species… it’s all just a drop in the ocean.’ His eyes glazed over as he stared into space, before rapidly refocusing and turning to her with a mischievous grin. ‘Would you like to see something not boring?’

Aisling studied the man with narrowed eyes, trying to discern his intention. He seemed genuine enough, and certainly looked the part. Whether this was a prank or not, seeing what this man had to offer was certainly leagues more appealing than enduring another moment with her class and traitorous ex-friend.

‘Alright, lead on.’ she said with a less-than-chipper sweep of her hand.

‘Right this way madam.’ he replied with a sparkling grin.

He led her through exhibits she had seen already, towards a fire exit door and down some concrete stairs. After three full flights, Aisling reckoned they were deep underground.

The museum owner produced a ring of keys, and unlocked the door first with a key, followed then by a long key code.

‘This is the retired exhibits room.’ he said as he opened the door into darkness. He flicked a switch, and old yellowed lights flooded the room that looked as if it was built right into a natural cave formation.

‘We keep all the exhibits that we no longer display here. What people don’t know is that we also keep items that are not fit for display. I like to think of it as Scáth Gleann’s second museum.’

‘What makes an item not fit for display?’ inquired Aisling, as she ran her hands along the chipped paint of a model pachycephalosaurus.

‘Not boring enough I suspect.’ replied the man with a charming wrinkle of his nose.

Aisling gave a half-hearted laugh as she wandered around, peeking under sheets of tarp as she went.

‘Where do you get them all?’ she asked.

‘For the model displays, we usually commission artists with government funds. It pays to have models that are aesthetically pleasing as well as scientifically and historically accurate. Well… as accurate as we *think* we know them to be.’

‘You make it sound like it’s all made up.’

‘That’s because… it is. Almost every book, every theory, every artefact… all just a snug little blanket of ignorance.’

‘And you know this for a fact?’

‘Mmmm, partially. Many avenues of truth have been lost to time, and others kept under lock and key. Except for one, that is.’

He approached a sheet of tarp which was draped over a small pillar-shaped object half his height.

‘Not all of the items in this room are for the museum. Certain items are part of my own private collection. In fact - I acquired a very special one today… one that might show you just how made-up things *really* are.’

He took hold of the sheet of tarp, and gently lifted it away.

There was a plinth of basalt carved into a hexagonal shape. It looked as if it could have been lifted straight from the Giant’s Causeway on the coast of Antrim. Sitting on the plinth was what appeared at first to be a helmet of a suit of armour. As Aisling drew nearer, she began to see that it was entirely different from any armour she had ever seen.

It was a bizarre thing, an oblate dome of bone ridges and a number of resinous lenses that gave the impression of eyeholes, but far too many to be practical for human eyes. Between the bone ridges were desiccated bundles of what she thought might have been lacquered wood, reddish-black and pressed into ovoid divots in the bone. Upon closer inspection, they seemed to be knots of striated muscle, though long since withered and dried solid, but remained somehow undecayed. She gave a hollow laugh as she was curiously reminded of beef jerky.

Aisling had once been to salt mines in Poland during another of her dreaded school trips, and had seen timber beams preserved by the salty air of the mines. They were as hard as stone to the touch. The ridges of this helmet reminded Aisling of those beams now, as she traced her finger along the brown bone which made up the helmet’s forehead.

‘It was found in a salt mine not far from here - just down the coast in fact. Reckon it’s organic, and the salt preserved it, stopping any bacteria from having their way with it after however long it was down there.’ said the man, studying Aisling’s reaction to the strange artefact.

‘How old is it?’ she asked, unable to take her eyes from it.

‘We don’t know. We don’t even know if it was just an ancient art piece made by us humans, or if it belonged to something else. As of this moment, you know as much as I do.’

Aisling stooped and looked into the helmet’s lenses, wondering what sights those eyes must have seen - if they ever saw anything at all, assuming it wasn’t some bizarre ornament or totem piece.

‘I need to take care of a few things. I won’t ask you to endure the rest of what my museum above has to offer, so you may stay here in this one if you wish. Judging by where your class left off, I’d imagine there is around half an hour left, so I’ll return by then. Enjoy.’ he said with a polite bow, and left at a brisk pace.

Once she was sure he had left, Aisling lifted the helmet from it’s plinth, holding it up in the light to study it closely. Motes of dust danced in the light and settled into the finest pores in the bone ridges, and the lenses possessed a curious iridescent quality as the light caught them at certain angles. They reminded Aisling of a pair of night vision binoculars her uncle showed her once, the eyes glinting red under certain lighting like the eyeshine of a cat.

She turned it around and, with only a second of hesitation, decided to place the helmet over her own head.

It did not sit comfortably. It’s width was nearly twice her own, and it wobbled awkwardly as it rested on her scalp.

*Definitely not designed for humans… so what was it for?*

As she began to muse on what the helmet’s purpose may have been, she suddenly felt a series of sharp pricks all across her scalp and neck.

She gave a yelp of shock, and immediately attempted to cast the helmet aside. To her horror, she discovered that the helmet was now anchored to her head via the same needles she felt pierce her. The ones in her neck undulated like a wasp’s sting, and she screamed in disgust as she tried in vain to pull the helmet free which even now, was closing around her neck like some predatory plant.

Frenzied thoughts of betrayal ran though her mind, that the museum owner was some human trafficker or abductor that was using some weird new device to inject her with poison. A more wishful thought ran through her mind that this was all some cruel, elaborate prank, and that she would be left with nothing but prick marks afterwards.

But the needles were in her neck, *they were in her fucking brain*. She did not feel pain or faintness beyond what had already befallen her, but as she clawed at the helmet, she could feel it grow warmer, softer and suppler. With that, her frenzy was renewed as she realised the needles in her neck were not injecting her - *they were drinking from her.*

Curious visions began to dance across her own, sights and colours which did not match what little she could see through the alien lenses of the exhibit room around her.

A part of her began to wonder if she were suffering delusions. If she had finally gone insane due to this ordeal on top of her already frail mental state following the loss of her only friend after years of judgement and ennui. Any thoughts on the state of her mind were washed away by the visions that followed; for it was no longer her mind alone.

Another’s mind pressed against hers, crushing it against the inside of the helmet with the vastness of its alien intellect, a sentience that fought for room inside the synapses of her already overworked brain.

Her vision filled with bizarre sights like spilled paint on a canvas. It bled across her consciousness until she was merely an observer in another’s body.

She was no longer in the museum. She was no longer in Scáth Gleann. She wasn’t even on Earth anymore.

She stood on the precipice of another world’s mountains, observing the far-flung vistas below. Vast mountains that dwarfed anything seen on Earth spread across the world, their peaks crested by clouds of floating purple gel. The gravity of this world allowed them to float, and each cloud was like an ecosystem in itself. The peach-coloured sunlight caught the gel clouds and cast dancing caustics across the planes below where the distant forms of spindly bovines grazed.

Glints of amethyst could be seen darting between clouds. They were like dolphins, with much longer fins and iridescent feathers of silver scales. They belched small gusts of gas from secondary gills, the spitting action serving as propulsion through the air between clouds. They danced between clouds in pods of five, their expulsions filling the air with flecks of gel like cherry blossom leaves falling in the breeze.

*I can join them.*

Aisling’s thoughts were her own, but they were not. They were the thoughts of another that ran through her mind, the alien thought processes and language as compatible with her own as opposing computer operating systems and hardware. Only the barest meaning could be discerned, along with certain emotions that most closely aligned with human experience. In that regard her mind was flooded with boundless wonder and curiosity. All fear and panic that her human mind felt was washed away by the vastness of the alien’s joy.

She ached to swim with the amethyst dolphins, and the means with which she would do so were revealed to her as she looked down with many more eyes than she was used to.

Her form was arachnoid, with four legs attached to a rotund thorax, and four more limbs that would be used in the same manner as arms. Encasing this alien form was the armour that formed the complete set along with the helmet she wore. She flexed her arms, assured by the coiled strength contained within the dense bundles of artificial muscle and tendons of elastic metal. A quick mental impulse summoned an alien rune along one of the eye lenses, a confirmation that the jump jets and actuating sub-jets adorning the limbs and thorax were in perfect condition, ready to send her soaring through the low-gravity skies where other worlds would allow only brief jumps and aquatic propulsion.

She leapt from the mountain, a split-second burst of propulsion sending her into a gel cloud hundreds of meters ahead.

She darted through the cloud, every sub-jet firing in sequence until she swam as dexterously as she would with her own human limbs.

The lenses of her helm recorded every moment as organic memories, the very same memories that she watched now through the medium of her own brain in the museum that felt as if it were a million miles away.

Locking pace with a pod of amethyst dolphins, she darted between clouds, watching as they lapped up small golden fish that frantically darted towards the safety of towering anemones.

This alien she shared a mind with now was a being living a life of pure self-actualisation. It existed for this one purpose – to dive into a sea of stars. She searched its alien memories for anything resembling a name, some hint at the alien’s identity. It’s name was a concept that took time for her mind to digest, to find the right words for. The absolute barest meaning was made clear, devoid of alien culture or context.

FAR-DIVER.

The feelings of exhilaration and boundless curiosity were suddenly shot through with emotions more difficult to process, as her vision became blurred and the world bled away into a glitched impression of its former beauty.

Now dominating her sight was an ocean of toxic sump, the remnants of a species that squandered their time on a once-breathtaking oceanic paradise. Waves of sooty sludge crashed against the rusted skeletons of towering industrial factories, and the sky was a grey-green soup of radioactive smog.

She felt the boundless curiosity of the Far-Diver extend to all oceans, regardless of beauty and purity. The secrets of the deep places would not remain so for the Far-Diver, so long as it was blessed with long life and vitality afforded by its wondrous armour. Beside the ocean of its curiosity, humanity's own was a mere shallow puddle by comparison.

She dove into the murky depths, the artificial muscle and jets working all the harder to power through the sump. The suit’s lights activated, piercing the dark. A fleeting glimpse of brackish scales was seen, stirring on the edge of her light’s radius. A surge of adrenaline coursed through her body, fear and excitement flooding her mind in equal measure.

She activated a weapon on her right arm, a flute of bone connected to a small network of muscle bundles and chemical sacs.

The creature darted for her, it’s milky eyes and grimy teeth telling of a tortured existence in the caustic waters of this world.

She fired a barrage of bone flechettes, the muscles spasming them forth like a sneeze while the chemical sacs imbued each flechette with a chemical charge, enough to power their trajectory through the sump like miniscule torpedoes.

The creature fled, its face made into a pin cushion as it leaked half-clotted blood into the gloom.

Over a ridge lay the sunken remains of an old facility detected by the suit’s scanner arrays. Each rusted husk was picked out as a three-dimensional map overlaid on the helmet's lenses in a ghostly green.

The scene faded before Aisling could uncover the facility’s secrets as another scene came into view, heralded by the same visual glitch as before.

Many more sights were revealed to Aisling then, more than she could count.

She watched the Far-Diver travel the stars, diving into the oceans and lakes of worlds uncounted. Protected by its armour, and kept vital by its ageless mechanisms, it spent the centuries sating its boundless thirst for sights unseen.

Fluorescent gas nebulae. The crushing depths of high-pressure worlds. Turquoise waters with cities of coral, their inhabitants hospitable, and passionate about diving as the Far-Diver was. Entire oceans held within freezing asteroids.

It never remained in one place for long, ever seeking the next thrill, the next grand sight to add to its mental galleries of wonder. She watched the last world fall away beneath her through the viewing port of the Far-Diver’s ship as she set sail for the next. Stars drifted by like snow as decade-long journeys flew by like a film on fast forward.

She stood now on the viewing port again, her tedious journey at an end. Below her was an oceanic world, a storm-afflicted sphere of blue and green. One colossal continent dominated the face of the planet.

The part of her that retained dim awareness through the dominance of the Far-Diver’s consciousness was stricken with the sudden realisation that the world was none other than Earth, as it had been in the deep past.

With a swift input to the command console, the ship began descending towards the south-west coast of Pangaea, the viewing port soon covered in heavy sheets of rain.

Impossible sights assailed her mind when the ship broke through the clouds.

Hundreds of miles of dense forest, broken up by massive stone citadels. They looked like castles from medieval times, only miles long and hundreds of meters high. They loomed over walled cities that dwarfed even the capitals of modern Earth. Surface scans revealed heat signatures of several forms of predatory wildlife, with some defying any of the scanner’s attempts at classification. Smaller forms battled them frantically within the depths of the forests, with smaller groups breaking away to flee to the safety of the walled cities.

Lightning illuminated the silhouettes of what Aisling thought were mountains in the distance. Another flash of sheet lightning, longer this time, revealed the outline of many branches reaching into the clouds. They were trees, mountain-sized and indomitable against the endless storms. Entire towns and woodlands nestled between roots so vast that they reached into the foundations of the planet.

The mind of the Far-Diver was taken aback at the sheer size, impossible even among all the worlds it had been to. Aisling’s mind reeled at the sight of the apparently human architecture of the giant castle.

*Surely there were no humans back then? Was it some other species? Another race of aliens not unlike the Far-Diver?*

Her own mind and the memories of the Far-Diver competed for her brain’s resources, and she felt her head throb with the mental strain. She cast the thoughts aside and watched, her own curiosity overcoming her shock.

She set the ship down on a beach of black sand, surrounded by towering rain-slicked cliffs beneath clouds black with rain.

A flash of lightning revealed the scales of a massive serpent breaching the water, visible from miles away even through the driving rain.

A deep sense of trepidation filled the mind of the Far-Diver, as it wondered for the first time in its existence if the exploration of this world would be worth the risk. Aisling felt that something was profoundly wrong with the world, even beyond the revelation that its history was not what Aisling knew it to be.

Steeling her will, she waded into the crashing waves, the stabilisers in the Far-Diver’s legs bracing against the crashing foam.

Down she dove, into the oceans of a world all too familiar and yet, completely unrecognisable.

Forms swam into view that bore distant resemblances to the ocean life of Aisling’s time, the proto-forms of things that would one day become sharks and turtles. As she dove deeper, forms made themselves known that were more bizarre and unsettling, dark cephaloid things whose forms radiated and shifted in ways that caused Aisling’s eyes to ache.

Many frightening scenes were committed to the Far-Diver’s memory in those stygian depths. Flooded civilisations. Titanic creatures lying dreaming in the furthest places from all light and heat. Legions of disturbing aquatic forms, which more than once attempted to assail the Far-Diver. They were narrowly driven off by the armour’s weapons, but ammunition and energy were beginning to dwindle.

Exhausted and frightened, Aisling considered turning back. Just then, a signature was detected, a doorway to another place. Driven on by the Far-Diver’s timeless curiosity, she swam onwards towards the source of the signature.

Jutting out from a rocky cliff overlooking a black trench was a massive stone portal. It was made of a glassy black crystal, etched with hieroglyphics that the armour’s memory had no recollection of. Unable to restrain herself, she swam through against her better judgement.

Whereas the oceans of ancient Earth were filled with the ambient sounds of sea life and drifting currents, the water surrounding her now were possessed of a profound and unnatural silence. A blackness surrounded her that was nothing short of endless. The portal above her connected with rock that faded into nothing, and all around her was an inscrutable abyss.

The armour began to shiver and hum as its metabolism began to kick into overdrive, a warning rune on a lens showing temperatures of extreme cold.

*Just a few seconds. There must be something. I must know.*

She swam forward, extending the scanning range in a bid to find something, *anything* in this strange abyss.

*Surely the portal must serve some purpose?*

Against the backdrop of impenetrable black, Aisling felt her vision suddenly strain. Glitches crackled across the vision of the Far-Diver as it noticed something in the black. A sudden surge of frenzy overcame the Far-Diver, its alien heart hammering as it saw something so horrifying that it’s curiosity was blasted away, replaced by an atavistic panic for pure survival. Aisling felt herself grow faint, though she could only experience a diluted fraction of the Far-Diver’s true fear through the imperfect connection to her human brain.

In her haste to escape, she activated an emergency release of buoyancy gel, flooding the armour in specialised pockets that, when coupled with the thorax jets, could allow rapid ascent while the armour guarded against the sudden change in pressure.

She flew towards the portal, feeling her escape just within reach.

A brief and sudden spike of agony stole Aisling’s breath, and her sight began to wobble uncontrollably. As her sight tilted to one side, she saw the brief image of her body as it was taken away by some great aquatic thing, a momentary flash of dozens of silvery eyes being the only sight she ever saw of it.

Emergency seals preserved the Far-Diver’s head from the pressure of re-entering Earth’s oceans, and Aisling watched all the horrific sights she had seen before fly by her as the helmet of the Far-Diver rocketed towards the surface.

The helmet used the fading consciousness of the Far-Diver to record its last moments, its alien metabolism cursing it to retain consciousness for a significant time after decapitation.

The time it spent bobbing on the turbulent oceans went by in a series of glitchy blurs.

Finally, the beach of black sand where she had left her spacecraft came into view, surrounded by dark figures. One of them pointed towards the water as the helmet washed ashore.

The figures drew closer; dark, osseous things of bone plates and sinuous muscle. Silvery eyes were seen in the dark through the rain, eyes so very much like those terrible eyes seen in the unknown black. A flash of lightning revealed the thing’s face - the face of a human man, exhausted but stoic.

Aisling watched the scene breathlessly as the man lifted the helmet, examining it closely. His eyes were stern, and as he stared intently into the many eye lenses of the helmet, a curious light formed on his forehead. A silvery tattoo-like pattern formed, not unlike a Celtic knot, four-cornered and glowing softly. Aisling felt a third mind now, a human mind press against her’s and the Far-Diver’s, but with the gentleness of a nurse assessing injury.

A sadness hung over the eyes of the man as he seemed to understand the Far-Diver’s fate. He handed the helmet to one of his men, ordering him to do something with it. He spoke with a language that sounded like Gaelic, but was possessed of a syntax and vocabulary that Aisling did not recognise from any variant she had ever learned of during the course of her education. She could discern no meaning from the words.

The scene began to bleed away now as the Far-Diver’s consciousness ceased completely.

The knowledge of what became of the helmet, of where it travelled during the course of deep time and how it ended up in the museum so well-preserved, was lost to the eons.

Aisling’s mind expanded as her brain suddenly felt relieved of a massive burden, her mind now her own once again. She ripped the helmet from her head, gasping and shuddering with fear. Her nose was drenched in blood, and her head felt as if she had been bludgeoned.

No longer caring about attendance of her school trip, she ran out of the room, up the stairs and straight out of the building, clutching her nose as she went.

As she cast fleeting glances at the exhibits she passed on her way, a thought kept repeating itself with frantic insistence.

*Fake. Fake. Fake. Fake.*

\-

Three days later, Aisling sat by a jetty, looking out to sea. It was a clear night, serene and cool, illuminated in silver by the light of a full moon.

Aisling had been thinking deeply on the things she had seen through the eyes of the Far-Diver. It had taken her days to process it all, to try and find some semblance of sense in those alien vistas, both wondrous and terrifying in equal measure.

She had no way of knowing how much of it was real beyond what she felt was real - that was to say, all of what she had seen. The powers that be saw fit to cover up Earth’s true history with lies about our evolution. Lies about life on earth and beyond. Lies about everything, the very foundations of all that is known. As to why was completely unknown to her. She had no idea on where to even begin her search.

Aisling had always felt that she was born in the wrong time, the wrong place. That she was not long for this world. A part of her mind was irreversibly changed by her experience with the helm of the Far-Diver. She was stricken with a deep and gnawing curiosity, cursed with an insatiable need to know and explore everything.

But alas, she was born too late to live through the dark and wondrous struggles of humanity's true history. Born far too early to have the means of exploring the stars in the way the Far-Diver did.

Land-locked on modern Earth, and with no way to sate her curiosity, she turned to the mysterious museum owner, in the hopes that she could experience the visions of the Far-Diver once again.

When Aisling told the museum staff of her experience with the owner and the helmet in his private collection in the retired exhibits room, she was regarded with the same judgmental gaze and mocking tone that she had endured for her whole life.

‘The owner is a man in his seventies, and he’s been residing in his holiday home in Spain for the past year.’ said the receptionist, as if she were a teacher explaining something to a hated student. ‘And we certainly don’t have a retired exhibits room, nor do we have any helmet matching your description.’

‘I hate to ask but could I please just take a look-’

The receptionist answered a phone call, ending the conversation.

*I’ll just find out myself so.*

Aisling entered the museum, loitering around the exhibits closest to the fire exit door where the supposed owner had taken her. They would likely have CCTV. Someone would surely see her. But if she could get to the bottom, if she could just get a glimpse or find some other way in…

She walked briskly, trying to appear as if she were simply looking for a restroom, but she was too anxious to maintain the façade. The second she touched the door, she ran, bounding down the stairs three at a time.

She reached the door of the retired exhibit room, locked tight.

‘Hey! Come back up here now or I’m calling the guards!’

The security guard would be there in seconds. The door was locked tight, with no other avenues of access. Peering through the dusty window in the door, Aisling was met with the sight of the retired exhibit room as she knew it. This time however, the room was drenched in the harsh light of several floodlights. They were focused on a central point, and she recognised the basalt plinth that held the helm of the Far-Diver. Milling about the room were official-looking men, adorned in dark green suits and wielding scientific-looking instruments and tools that she did not recognise.

Before she could observe any further, she was seized roughly by the security guard and dragged up the stairs by her forearm.

‘Who were they? Who were they!?’ she demanded, desperate to know what other secrets she had now stumbled into. Her demands were met only with silence.

The guard marched her to the front door, and with a simple statement of ‘You’re barred, leave now or I’ll call the Gardaí.’ left her standing in the rain-soaked street.

Her mind reeled with what she had seen. She had sought answers in coming to the museum, but now she was left with more questions than ever before.

Who were the men in the dark green suits? What did they want with the helm? And why were the museum staff being so secretive about it all?

As she walked in the rain, she observed the town all about her. She looked to the nearby sea, to the cliffs around the town’s valley, into the blackness of the Scáth Gleann wilderness.

Not for the first time, and certainly not for the last, she began to wonder just how much of it all was truly real.
