Throughout my life I've always been able to lucid dream. For those who don't know, lucid dreaming is the act of being able to control your dreams, and what happens in them. In all of my dreams I've always been in total control, and able to do whatever I want in them. Things like flying, teleporting, and anything else you can think of have always been possible for me in my dreams.

Not only that, I believe my dreams have been affecting reality. Sometimes when dreaming of things that are possible in reality I've had those things happen to me in real life. This doesn't happen very often, but when they do it feels too convenient to be a coincidence. A few years ago I had a dream I was extremely wealthy, I had a large house, and lived in the lap of luxury, having anything I could ever want for. The next day, I found a $100 bill on the ground. Another time I dreamed I was in a loving relationship with my crush, and the day after that I finally asked her out, and she said yes. 

Recently however, I've started to lose control of my dreams, and what I can do in them. Last month I dreamed I was stuck in a burning building with no way out as I slowly succumbed to smoke inhalation in the dream, I woke up. The next day the apartment building next to mine burned down in an accident. Last week I dreamed I was being chased by a man wielding an axe, he was always right behind me, and I was never able to lose him. When he finally caught me, kicked me down, and slammed the axe into my chest, then I woke up. 

The day after I heard on the news that a man in my area was killed by someone who murdered him with an axe in the same fashion as my dream. Last night I had a dream where I was sitting in a dark room, with nothing in it other than a man who sat across from me in an identical chair. He was wearing a black pinstripe suit, with short blonde hair, and bright blue eyes. He looked to be middle aged from the wrinkles around his face. He told me that he was a demon here to punish me for all the evils I've done in my life, and my life would become a living hell before I woke up. The next day this exact man walked into the store where I work. I live in a small town, new folk coming through isn't very common, so everyone knew this person was here. While we don't wear name tags at work, he somehow knew me by name. When I asked him how he knew my name he simply smiled, and walked away. I'm not sure what to do now. I donâ€™t know who he was, or if I will dream of him again soon.
