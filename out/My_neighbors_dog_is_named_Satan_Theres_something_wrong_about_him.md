“Hey, don’t let Satan out,” she yelled as I opened my apartment door, arms full of groceries.

That’s when I saw him there in the hallway. A skinny mutt with that sad, shelter-dog look in his eyes. He walked slowly, curious.

Then the neighbor, this woman in her seventies who walked with a limp, came rushing over and gently scolded him for sneaking out.

“Your dog’s name is Satan?” I asked, without even thinking if it sounded rude.

She laughed and said yeah. Said she knew it made people raise their eyebrows but that was the name on his tag.

The building’s superintendent had found him about a week earlier wandering around the street. He tried to track down the original owner since there was a collar, but no luck. So he asked if she wanted to take him in.

After telling me the whole story, she tugged his leash and led him back inside. But the dog kept looking at me. Wouldn’t stop staring.

Over the next few days, I saw Satan here and there. When she walked him, or when she accidentally left her door open and he wandered the hallway again. Every time I ran into him, he came right up to me like he wanted something. His eyes were wide and sad, too sad. Something about them felt... off. 

One morning, I left early for the gym before work. As I stepped out of my apartment, I heard a sound. Like a scream, but weird. It was low and drawn out, like someone running out of breath.
It was coming from the neighbor’s place.

I knocked on her door and asked if everything was okay. No answer. The sound kept going. I tried the handle and it burned my hand. That’s when I saw smoke coming from the cracks.

The noise woke up the rest of the floor and a few of us busted the door open.

We found her in the living room, sitting in her chair. On fire. But not like a house fire. The flames weren’t spreading. They were only on her. Burning her skin away while she just sat there, silent now. The smell hit me hard. I still gag when I think about it.

Satan wasn’t anywhere in the apartment.

No one could explain how the fire started. The cops said something about her phone and the chair being super flammable, but no one really bought it.

I kept wondering where the dog had gone, even though I figured that was the end of it. But two days later, coming home from work, I heard the sound of paws heading my way. I turned around and there was Satan. Standing right next to me with the same eyes as before.

Right behind him, holding his leash, was this middle-aged accountant I kind of knew by sight. He lived alone on the second floor, and was a short guy, who was always squinting like his glasses weren’t doing their job. Bit of an oddball.

I asked how he found the dog and he said the super had found him a couple days ago, curled up by a thrash can outside. Scared and starving.
“And do you still call him Satan?” I asked, eyeing the tag still hanging from his collar.

“Of course. That’s his name,” he said with a shrug.
That bugged me. Not gonna lie. Just change the damn name.

I didn’t dwell on it too much, and got on with my life. Until a few days later, at lunch, some coworkers started talking about a horrible accident that happened the day before. 

Some guy’s car exploded the moment he turned the keys on. Fire engulfed the whole thing for nearly half an hour, even with firefighters on the scene.

One of them showed me a video someone had taken on their phone while walking past it and you can’t imagine the shock I felt when I realized it was the accountant in that car. 

Flames wrapped the car completely and inside the man let out a low, endless scream just like the neighbor.

I spent the whole day trying to make sense of what happened and what the dog had to do with it but nothing fit. 

That night, when I went down to take out the trash, I was stunned to see a teenage girl holding Satan on a leash with her father behind her.

“We named him Duke. The super gave him to us today, said the owner abandoned him,” the father explained. “It’s always been her dream to have a dog.”

She looked so happy and at least they’d changed the name. But after what I’d seen I couldn’t leave that dog in their hands. 

I pretended to be his real owner, said I demanded they give it to me and even threatened to call the cops. The girl started crying and I hated doing it but it was for her own good.

I left with the dog and brought him into my apartment. I’ll be honest, I was scared as hell I’d end up like the others. But the second he walked in, he just sat in a corner, staring at me with those same sad eyes.

At first I was afraid, then I started feeling sorry for him. Then I had an idea: maybe the super knew more about the dog since he was the one who found him.

I left Satan alone and went to knock on the super’s door. Knocked three times and nothing. Then I heard it. That same weird scream, low and constant, I’d heard at my neighbor’s place, and again in that video. 

I grabbed the doorknob and opened it, surprised it wasn’t locked. But the apartment was empty, and the noise stopped. There wasn’t even any furniture in the place, just a desk by the window with a couple of pens and this big old book open on it.

Something about it pulled me in, and I walked over to look at the page. It was just names. One after another. The last two I recognized as the old woman and the accountant.

I was about to flip the page when I heard a noise behind me and nearly jumped out of my skin. The super was standing at the door, staring me down.

"What do you think you're doing?" he asked.

I tried to explain, said I heard something and got worried. Said I came because of the dog.

"As far as I know, he's your problem now," he said. And his tone made it clear the father called him in a not-so-nice way. "So get out of my apartment.”

I nodded and started walking out. But right as I got into the hallway, he called out again, laughing.

"Everyone thinks it's the dog's name," he said, between chuckles.

"What?" I asked, confused.

"The tag on the collar. That's not the dog's name,” he continued. “It's the owner's."

Then he slammed the door in my face.

That was yesterday, and I barely slept last night. 

I stayed up for hours digging through forums, random videos, anything I could find online that might explain what this dog is or what I'm supposed to do with him.

But the thing that's really messing with my head is how he keeps staring at me. All the time. And I'm starting to notice weird stuff now.

Like the way he limps just like the old lady did. Or the way he sometimes wrinkles his nose like he’s squinting to see better just like the accountant.

Maybe I’m losing it from the lack of sleep. But I swear to God, when I look into his eyes, I see someone begging for help.

It’s the same look I saw in the neighbor’s burning eyes when I [burst through her door.](https://www.reddit.com/u/Accomplished_Low7889/s/iA2TC80nax).
