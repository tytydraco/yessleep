By all means, I consider myself a friendly, easy-going person with a generally casual approach to life. I’m usually quite forgiving of others too—I’m certainly not the type to hold long-term grudges against people who have offended me. 

But, when it comes to my next-door neighbour Ben, I just couldn’t find it within me to even say a proper ‘hello’ to him whenever we cross paths. Ever since he moved into my apartment block two years ago, I have tried to avoid him as much as I possibly could. If I saw him waiting for the lift at the lobby, I would choose to take the stairs instead. If I happened to meet him in the common corridor, I would avert my eyes and quickly walk past while mumbling a perfunctory greeting. 

It’s not that I hated his guts or something…but Ben just has a weird ‘vibe’ to him that puts me off. I’m sure that I am not the only person who feels this way—none of the other neighbours seem to like his presence in the apartment block, and there were a few times when people angrily confronted him out in the open. It’s hard to tell what is exactly off with him, but if I were to guess, I would say that it is probably the freakish way he stares at people—always looking not at them, but something invisible behind their shoulder. It was as though he could see things no one else could.

Ben had gotten into more trouble than I can keep count of with the landlord too; mostly, they were due to the complaints of other residents: a pungent smell coming from his apartment; loud noises throughout the night; as well as the ridiculous amount of incense he burns by his window, just to name a few. I myself had been an unfortunate victim of his strange behaviour, though I tried to tolerate them if possible, because confronting him would be a worse alternative for me. 

However, no matter how many times people complained or the landlord threatened to evict him, Ben never seemed to change his ways. The landlord also never carried out his threats in the end, and from what I had heard, the reason was because the landlord feels sorry for Ben. I never knew why he would feel sorry for a person like Ben, however. Not until a month ago. 

I live in a place with a climate that is considered close to tropical, so we don’t get snowfall even in the winter. It does get quite rainy and cold, however. If you don’t own a dryer, you either have to slowly dry your laundry indoors, or carry your washed laundry to the laundromat nearby. I used to have an electric heater in my bedroom to dry my clothes , but after finally saving up enough money to buy a dryer, my life has gotten much easier. 

It was one of those cold and rainy nights, while I was finishing up drafting my emails on my work laptop with a hot mug of Milo by my side, when I suddenly heard a loud bang and a crashing noise against the wall separating my apartment from my neighbour. It sounded like someone had thrown a heavy object against the other side of the wall, and I was quickly worried that Ben was up to something weird again. 

However, there were no other noises coming from his apartment. After a tense few seconds, I breathed a sigh of relief and resumed my work. That was when I heard a soft but unmistakable knock on my front door. 

Was that from Ben? I hesitated, then thought that it was more likely from one of the other neighbours instead coming to ask me what the noise was. It had happened before, after all.

My apartment door didn’t have a peephole, so I unlocked it and pulled it open. On the off chance that it was actually him, I didn’t unlatch the metal grille gate as I opened the door. 

Surprisingly, a woman who I had never met before was standing outside my doorstep. She saw me and her taut expression visibly eased. 

“Uh, hello?” I said, opening the door fully and unlatching the grille gate. “How can I help you?”

She didn’t say anything, but pointed her finger at something down the corridor. 

“Did you lock yourself out of your apartment?” I asked, since I thought she might be pointing at her own apartment. “I think only the landlord can help you with that, but if you don’t mind, you can spend the night in my place.” 

As if she didn’t hear what I had just said, the woman continued standing silently while pointing her finger down the corridor. She was seriously starting to give off a creepy vibe similar to my neighbour. I cautiously stepped out of the threshold to look at where she was pointing at. 

Ben’s apartment. 

“...” I didn’t know what to say at that moment, so I simply shook my head and slammed the grille gate shut in her face. If she wanted to confront him, she could do so herself. I wasn’t going to involve myself in unnecessary trouble. 

Before I could close the door fully, however, the woman suddenly stopped me by holding onto the door edge. Now, normally I wouldn’t even get annoyed by such a gesture. I would probably stop and politely ask her what she wanted me to do with my neighbour, at the very least. 

But all I could focus on was the alarming fact that her arm had just magically passed through the grille gate with ease. Because of a past incident of wild monkeys entering the apartment of another resident and causing a huge mess, I had specially ordered a scissor grille with gaps so narrow you have to twist your hand in a tight angle to slide it though. Yet this woman had somehow grabbed my door through the grille gate in a split second; she certainly didn’t squeeze her hand through like a normal person would have. 

On a second, closer look, a dreadful chill ran down my spine. Her arm looked exactly like one of those glitches in video games where a part of your character is phasing through a solid object—the metal bars that should have prevented her movement were now going through her arm as if it was air. 

My mind froze, and I simply stood facing her with my mouth hung open. 

Hell, if this woman’s arm could just phase though stainless steel like it was nothing, did it matter if I had closed the door or not? I had left my phone next to my laptop in the living room, and I doubt I had the time to grab it and call for help before this woman grabbed me instead. There were no other people in my apartment too, and shouting to alert the other neighbours seemed too risky a move. 

For a long time neither of us made a move. It was probably the creepiest staring contest I had ever done in my lifetime; her pale glassy eyes, which I now noticed looked eerily fake, seemed to peer into my very soul. 

Finally, her lips quivered and moved, slowly spreading into a wide unnatural grin that was both horrifying and captivating at the same time. I was already mentally prepared to die a grisly death when she suddenly opened her mouth in a stretched ‘O’ shape.

Though she made no sound, I finally realised that she was trying to mouth something to me. 

*Go.* 

*Now.*

Then, she let go of my door and pointed again at my neighbour’s apartment, looking at me with expectant eyes. 

I didn’t even realise that I had been holding my breath this entire time. Trying to calm my nerves down, I figured whether I listened to her or not, I was fucked either way. Interacting with Ben definitely felt better than being haunted by a ghost though, so I opened the grille gate and hesitantly approached Ben’s apartment. 

“H-hello?” I knocked on his door. “I-I’m, uh, I’m your neighbour. From Apartment 301. We met a few times before, do you remember me?” 

No reply.

I knocked again while glancing nervously at the woman, who was slowly gliding towards me like a damn ghost. “U-uh, please open the door…there’s this gh…” She was quite literally inches away from my face, and I didn’t think it would be a good idea to say something potentially offensive. “...this l-lady who I think knows you…” 

Still, no reply. The silence perturbed me. I gave up knocking on the door and tried the handle instead, which turned with a click and opened the door. 

The interior was pitch-black, and there was a stale, musty smell in the air. It didn’t seem like Ben had opened his windows in weeks, probably because of the constant rain. 

“Hello?” I found the light switch next to the door and flicked it. The lights took a while to finally turn on, and when I saw a pool of bright crimson-red on the grimy floor, I nearly screamed my head off. 

Ben was slumped against the wall, blood dripping from a nasty gash on his forehead. Beside his feet was an overturned metal stand, the kind used to support bamboo poles from which you would hang your laundry to dry. 

I wasn’t anything close to a medic, but even I knew that his situation wasn’t looking good. “H-hold on, I’ll call an ambulance!” I shouted to the woman, momentarily forgetting that she was probably not human, and rushed back to my apartment to get my phone.

Eventually, the EMTs arrived and whisked Ben to the A&E. In the chaos that resulted from everyone being rudely awoken by the ambulance sirens, the woman had vanished without a trace. I even forgot about her until more than two weeks later, when Ben was finally discharged and allowed to return home. He knocked on my door out of the blue one rainy night, and when I apprehensively opened the door, he passed me a wrapped box of chocolates with an uncharacteristic, shy smile. 

“Sorry for disturbing you, erm…” He paused and glanced at something behind my back, causing me to stiffen. “May wanted me to give you this as thanks…for your help the other day. She told me that you saved my life.” 

I swallowed. “...May?” 

“Erm…she’s my girlfriend…” he mumbled. “She’s hovering behind you right now, but I’m not sure if you…can see.”

It sounded like a bad prank, but when I suddenly felt something icy cold press against my back, I didn’t bother turning around to check. 

“W-well, thank you for the chocolates…” I began to close the door when he suddenly stopped me—not by holding onto my door through the grille gate, thankfully. 

“Oh, right, there’s something else,” he said hurriedly. “May wants to have a Christmas dinner this year, and she hopes that you can…join us on the Eve.” 

She’s…*hoping*? Judging by the chills running wildly up and down my spine at her touch, I doubted I would be able to refuse Ben’s invitation without being murdered by a ghost. 

After he had left and the awful sensation on my back disappeared, I closed the door and turned around…to see the woman standing right in front of me. I violently recoiled and probably yelped a little too loudly, because she gave me a look that conveyed disappointment before gliding right through the wall into Ben’s apartment. 

That wasn’t the last time May scared the absolute crap out of me—in fact, since that day, she would ‘haunt’ my apartment on an almost daily basis. I even received a complaint saying that I woke up the downstairs neighbours with my late-night screams. 

“May has taken a liking to you,” Ben told me after I desperately begged him to stop her. “She’s overjoyed that someone else can see her.” 

“How did you even…?!” I didn’t get to finish my question, because she suddenly appeared between me and Ben and clung onto my neck like an oversized ice-cold feline. 

Before I know it, today is Christmas Eve. While you all may be enjoying a good Christmas dinner with family and friends, it looks like I’m going to spend the night with my weird neighbour and [his equally weird girlfriend.](https://www.reddit.com/r/killwrites/)
