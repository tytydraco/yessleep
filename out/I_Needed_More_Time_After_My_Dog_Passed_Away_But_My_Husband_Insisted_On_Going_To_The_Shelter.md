Our dog of nine years died. My husband swore he didn’t want another dog, but three months later we were at the shelter.

My husband loved a hopeless case. The one dog he set his eyes on was the one I didn’t want. I couldn’t explain it, just a feeling.

He was a lab mix. Five or six. He had lost a lot of hair due to some skin condition and had milky eyes from cataracts; almost blind. The people at the shelter said he had been wandering by the creek just outside of town. 

He looked sad. His tail never wagged. There was a small window on the wall in the shelter and he wouldn’t take his eyes off of it.

My husband named him Louis.

We kept him inside. We wouldn’t let him outside unless he was on a leash and when he did go outside, he would always stare in the same direction, down at the hollow behind our house. Lots of birds and squirrels in there; we just thought he heard them. He never fought us on the leash.

Louis stayed by the back door all the time. We could pet him, but he wouldn’t stop looking out the back sliding glass door.

He was blind, but I swear he was looking at something. His mouth was always closed. He never panted. I never saw him clean himself.

He would only eat if his bowl was next to the door, but even then, between each dip into his bowl, he would look back through the window.

My husband felt some raised skin on his back, and parted the hair. A scar. My husband said it looked like writing.

He took his beard trimmer and shaved a patch of hair away from the scar tissue. There was a brand that had been burned into his skin. A weird design, like words from some kind of old that wrapped around an eye. The numbers 396 underneath it.

I wanted to take the dog back. Louis gave me the creeps, but my husband was insistent that we keep him. The dog just needed time, he said. He’d clearly been abused. He needed love.

We argued about it one night in front of Louis. I wanted him gone, but somehow my husband sweet talked me out of it. That damn dog pulled his attention away from the window and just stared at me. He stared at me through the whole argument. When it was done, he turned his attention back to the door.

Two weeks. After every day by that damn glass door staring down at the hollow, he turned away. But the dog began watching us. He still stayed by the door, but he never took his eyes off of us. Even when my husband would pet the thing, it would just stare at him with those white eyes. His eyes weren’t just following the sounds we made, I watched them move with us. My husband thought I was nuts.

When I would come down to make coffee in the morning and turn on the lights, Louis was already staring at me. I’d swear he hadn’t moved all night.

Two nights ago, Louis turned his attention back to the door. He started howling and he just wouldn’t stop.

Last night I went out with some friends. I needed a break and some quiet.

Around nine, my ring camera went off. A tall skinny man limped up to our back door and kicked it in. A long ragged black coat and a dirty frayed strip of cloth was tied around his head, covering his eyes.

I called my husband.

Nothing.

I called the cops.

Three minutes later, I saw the man amble out the back door. Louis was happily walking in front of him wagging his tail, leading the sallow man out into the dark. Louis’s muzzle was bloody.

We live a ways out of town, so it took the cops twenty minutes to get there. I had been driving back, going out of my mind, dialing my husband's number over and over. I pulled into our driveway just after the cops. We found my husband’s body in the kitchen.

His legs were broken and his throat had been torn to shreds. Bloody footprints and paw prints were all over the linoleum floor. There was something drawn on the wall next to the back door.

It was the same symbol that had been branded into Louis’s skin, but without the numbers underneath.

The police found tracks all the way down to the hollow, but then they just stopped. They’ve been searching for the last few hours with dogs.
