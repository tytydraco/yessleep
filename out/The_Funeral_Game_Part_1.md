We knew we weren’t supposed to play games in the graveyard, but that just made it more fun. We didn’t go there to play hide and seek or anything like that. It wouldn’t be worth the risk of getting caught. Kids took the game seriously, and so did the adults. If they found us out there in the dark with candles and shovels, we’d be in deep trouble. That didn’t stop us, though, and whenever the old iron key resurfaced, somebody would always take their chances and play the Funeral Game.

It didn’t happen often. I was in grade school the first time I heard about the game, and the old key didn’t turn up again until my senior year. My friend Joel got his hands on it—he wouldn’t say how—and called a group to his house to go over the rules. We’d all heard them before, but he insisted that we plan out each step before we got there.

There’s a cemetery at the edge of town, and at the center stands an old stone mausoleum. It’s always locked, and whoever has the key must knock before opening the huge iron door. Inside, there’s a long, wooden coffin on a slab. It’s empty, and whoever’s “it” must knock three times before opening the lid and climbing in. The rest of the players close the lid, step outside, and circle the mausoleum three times. They go back in, knock on the lid, and if their friend answers, they let them out.

That only happens if the game *doesn’t* work. If they knock on the lid and there’s no answer, it worked, and the coffin is empty. They must all search the cemetery for a candle burning over a grave. The players dig up the grave, open the coffin, and pull their friend out. They’ve supposedly seen the afterlife.

“You can only play on nights when the moon is half-full,” Joel said, “and you should never play if it’s raining.”

I knew it was just a snipe hunt, but I still felt a little jolt of electricity through my veins when Joel pulled the heavy iron key from his pocket. It was rusted and black with age, wide-toothed with the vaguest impression of a vulture on either side.

Joel invited me, Abby, and Collin to play the Funeral Game with him. Collin was the closest thing to a troublemaker in our little clique, mostly harmless, but he needed no convincing to go trespassing in a cemetery when Joel called. I admit I was more sheepish. College was just around the corner and I didn’t want anything suspicious on my record.

When I heard Abby was going, I decided to join in. We wouldn’t see each other much after graduation, so I couldn’t miss the chance to make one more memory with her. I didn’t know which college she would end up going to, but in all likelihood, it would be a much nicer one than I could get into. She was sharp, and I knew she was going places I couldn’t imagine.

We were huddled in a circle in Joel’s basement.

“Only one person goes in the coffin, but we’ll need everybody else to dig ‘em up,” he said.  

“How do we pick who goes inside?” Abby asked.

“We’ll let the key decide,” Joel answered. He set it down in the middle of our circle and spun it like a bottle. For all its weight, the key spun surprisingly well, and as I watched the vulture swirl on the floor, I felt for the first time as if it could be me going in the coffin. The key seemed to growl against the concrete as it slowed, again and again pointing its toothed tip at me, ready to bite.  

We each held our breath while the key made its final pass, Joel grinning ear to ear, Abby clinching her firsts until the knuckles shone. I tensed as it came to me, finally lost all momentum, then rested squarely at Collin’s feet. My shoulders slacked and I sighed with relief. Abby exhaled as well, sounding more disappointed than anything. 

“Congrats, buddy, you’re going in the box!” Joel snatched up the key and slapped Collin on the back.

Collin laughed, “Don’t take too long to dig me up, alright everybody?” Then he was on his feet and the first up the stairs.

\*\*\*

Joel drove us out to the cemetery in a pickup truck passed down from his brother. Collin sat up front, leaving the cramped rear seats for Abby and me. I don’t think he was trying to bring us closer together—he had a pretty wide frame and he never took the back row if he could help it. I appreciated it either way.  

The open gate was pale as bones in the half moon glow, and as the sea of headstones parted around us, I couldn’t help but shiver. Abby could probably feel the tremor and nudged me in the dark.

“You ready?” she whispered. Her voice had a little shake to it, too.

“Ready for anything,” I answered way louder than I intended to. 

“That’s good to know,” Collin turned around. “We can’t have you chicken out tonight.”

“Hey, it’s your funeral.”

Joel reached the end of the trail and turned the truck around to face the gate. If someone found us in the cemetery, we’d have to haul ass out of here, and he didn’t want to maneuver that giant truck in a panic.

A grassy hill rose beyond the trail, with tiers of ornate grave markers leading to the top. Crowing the hill was the mausoleum. Sharp pinnacles jutted upward like stalagmites—or horns. I’d seen it from a distance before, but in the dark, with nothing more than a flashlight’s beam, it seemed entirely out of place.

The gothic design didn’t match anything else in the cemetery, even the towering obelisks of the wealthier families. I’ve heard that the mausoleum belonged to an earl or duke or whatever who left his old country only to die here. It didn’t really matter since he wasn’t supposed to be in the tomb anyway.

I held a flashlight for Joel as he produced the key from his pocket, then he found the massive iron lock and drove it in.

Abby reminded him, “Knock first. Don’t be rude.”

And so he did. One, two, three. The sturdy door boomed with each impact, then rumbled as Joel struggled to turn the key. It growled, and finally with an echoing clank, the lock yielded.

“Help me push,” he said.

Collin braced the door with Joel and the two bore against it until it slowly gave way. A suffocating wave of musty air washed over us when the door was clear, as if the tomb had held its breath for ages until someone came knocking again.

Dust drifted through our beams of light as we explored the mausoleum. The interior was far more sparse than I had imagined. We saw none of the imposing stone flourishes from the exterior, no inscriptions, no crosses. There was only the long, wooden coffin on a long, cold slab.

We gathered around the coffin and exchanged uneasy glances. Collin shrugged, eyed the coffin up and down, and looked across the dark for Joel.

“Are we really going to open this thing?” Collin’s voice echoed all around.

“That’s the plan,” Joel said.

Collin stretched out a fist to knock on the lid, but froze.

“And we’re sure it’s empty, right?”

“We won’t be the first to open it,” Joel’s voice was slow and unsure. “If there’s something in there, somebody else has seen it before. I think we would have heard about it.”

Collin knocked. One, two, three. Resounding, hollow cracks. For what it’s worth, nobody answered.

“Alright, you know what’s next,” Joel said. We each set down our flashlights and gripped the lid. “Ok, ready?” He was nearly shouting. “Here… we… go!”

It didn’t happen all at once. We moved the lid a few inches at first, just enough to open a small gap in the coffin. I want to believe it was my eyes playing tricks on me, but to this day, I’m afraid I saw something in that coffin. It had been dead for a very long time, and it looked delighted to be awake again.

The lid shifted away and the coffin was empty. We set the lid aside and took our flashlights in hand. No one else seemed to have noticed the thing in the coffin, so I didn’t mention it. This didn’t look like the final resting place of an old-world noble, just a plain, wooden box filled with dust and spiderwebs.

Collin stared into the empty box for a long while before finally hoisting himself up on the slab.

“Don’t you leave me out here,” he said, then he climbed in.

A black, wiry spider skittered away as he leaned back and rested his head against the hard wood. Collin crossed his hands over his chest and let his jaw fall slack like a corpse.

“He looks so natural,” Abby laughed.    

Finally, it was time to close him up. The three of us slid the lid back into place. Collin was bold, but as the shadow enveloped him, his brow narrowed, the last light of his eyes glinting with fear of the dark.

“Alright,” Joel said. “Let’s take a few laps outside.”

A low, uneasy wind passed over the hilltop. We breathed deep of the cool night air and gazed out over the field of headstones, half-hidden under the half moon. The game had never seemed real before now, but to be there playing it, I wasn’t sure what to think. There, outside the mausoleum, I didn’t want to see the other half still left in the shadows.

Slowly, methodically, we circled the mausoleum. I wanted to quicken the pace and get the night over with, but Joel insisted on taking it slow to give Collin plenty of time inside. On the third circle, we came around the corner and the wind stopped. All at once, the air was as still as inside the tomb.

The others seemed to notice.

“Well,” Joel said. “Let’s see what happened.”

Back inside the mausoleum, we gathered around the coffin. Joel knocked. One, two, three.

Nothing.

After a beat, Abby smirked and knocked again.

“Wake up, it’s time to go!”

Collin was still silent.

“Do you think he passed out in there?” I asked.

“Who knows?” Joel said. “Let’s see.”

The lid was harder to move without Collin’s help, but we managed to shift it aside. The coffin was empty.

Joel took a second to take in the sight.

“Where’d he go?” he laughed.

We swept our lights around the tomb, but there was no sign of him. No footprints, no back door, no Collin. Abby went to the door and scanned the cemetery while Joel reached into the coffin and searched for a trap door. I asked him to help me lift up the box only to find that the slab itself was solid marble.

Abby shot a sincere look my way and whispered, “Are you in on this?”

I assured her I had no idea what happened to Collin.

“We’re stumped, Joel,” I said. “What’s going on?”

“I wish I knew,” he said, a nervous, involuntary smile made obvious by the harsh light.

“We can’t leave without him,” I said.

“You’re right,” Joel sighed. “But he’s not in here anymore. Let’s get out there and get him.”

When we stepped outside, the first thing I noticed was the sound. The wind was gone, but I could still hear it—a ceaseless, low moan hovering over the cemetery. I wanted desperately to get out of there. Between the dead, grinning face in the coffin and the groaning night, I’d had enough of these graveyard games.

We split up to find Collin. Joel and Abby started at the top of the hill while I searched the cemetery below. My whole body ached with tension, certain that at any moment, Collin would leap out from behind a gravestone and give my heart a spontaneous stress test.

Then I saw it. Deep within the cemetery, a faint, flickering light. I rushed toward its source to find a tall, yellow candle burning atop a weather-worn headstone. I looked all around it, for Collin, for Joel and Abby, and for anyone out here who could have helped pull off this sorry prank. It was just me and the dead underneath, so I went back up the hill to fetch my friends.

“Any sign of him?” Abby asked.

“I found a candle.”

“A lit candle?” Joel perked up. “Come on!”

He hurried down the hill and leaped into the truck bed. When Abby and I made it to the truck, he handed out shovels.

“Are you serious?” Abby protested.

“I didn’t expect the night to go this way either, but here we are.” Joel hopped down, then I led them to the candlelit grave.

“We’re not really about to dig somebody up, are we, Joel?” I said, hoping he’d drop whatever ruse he’d kept going so long.

“Look. I don’t know where he is. I didn’t think he’d just disappear, and I didn’t think we’d find a lit candle in the middle of the cemetery tonight. I do know that coffins don’t have a ton of air inside, so if he’s down there, we’d better start digging now.”

My ears rang. I had thought that at worst, we’d end up holding down the lid on somebody so they’d think they were stuck. We’d all have a good laugh and get home in time for a late-night creature feature. I tried to think of an explanation that didn’t involve us breaking ground, but then I heard a shovel pierce the earth. Abby had already started digging.

At this point, nobody was joking. Joel followed without a word, then I dug my shovel into the soft ground. Even in the cool weather, sweat soaked my scalp and dripped down my nose as I heaved dirt out of the way. We dug in a frenzy, and little by little, the grave opened up underneath us. I expected us to strike the top of the grave vault, but there was nothing but earth all the way down.

And there, well before we reached six feet, was the lid of a wooden coffin, just like the one Collin climbed into. I reached to brush the dirt off the lid, and then the whole box rattled with heavy, frantic knocking.

“He’s in there!” Joel shouted.

The sound inside was muffled, but I could hear Collin’s voice. He was screaming.

“Let’s get him out of there,” I said, scrambling to clear the last of the dirt.

The three of us hunkered around the coffin, dug our hands under the lid, and exhumed our friend.

Collin gasped for air, eyes bloodshot and distant. His face had drained of color, and he trembled all over. We let him catch his breath, then Abby and I took him by the hands and raised him out of the coffin. He sat in silence as we filled in the grave. In the distance, the tree line glowed with the first colors of sunrise.

When we all climbed back into the truck, Joel asked Collin what happened to him.

Collin shook his head, started to answer several times, then finally spoke.

“I went down somewhere.”

Abby and I leaned in from the back seat.

“Down? Like through the slab?” she asked breathlessly. “Or to hell or what?”

“Easy,” I chided.

“I don’t know what it was,” Collin said. “It was closer to hell than heaven. I was in the coffin for a little while after you closed the lid, then it felt like sinking. Almost like falling asleep, then being pulled down. I couldn’t breathe.”

“What did you see?” Abby asked.

“I couldn’t see anything,” he said. “It was dark all the way down. It seemed like I would sink forever, like the dark had no end to it, then I was somewhere else. Underground. I followed a light, and next thing I realized, I was lying on my back again, I could hear my breath echo in the coffin, but I couldn’t move the lid.”

“Are you alright now?” I asked.

“That was the worst night of my life,” Collin said. “The whole time, I felt like I wasn’t alone.”

He stopped answering after that. 

I never saw Collin again after the night he played the Funeral Game. He dropped out of school, wouldn’t answer the phone, and would hardly leave his house. It’s weird losing someone while they’re still alive. They’re still out there, but now all you’ve got are the memories, and you don’t get to make new ones. The things you once loved in common are just painful reminders that you’re out wandering beyond a dead end, and you can’t go back.

Letting go of Collin was hard. It was terrifying to realize we still had so much more to lose.
