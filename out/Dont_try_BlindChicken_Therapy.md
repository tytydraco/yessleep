We sat in a circle and shared our innermost thoughts. Torturous, asinine, intrusive thoughts.

A fear of contamination from a strand of her hair. A fear that one day, in a fit of insanity, he might murder his loved ones. A fear of cheating on her partner whilst sleepwalking. Each OCD sufferer had a unique theme, but we were all the same.

We all feared the unknown.

“And what about you, Zeke?” Denny asked.

Denny was the facilitator for the OCD support group, and I felt an unwilling resentment towards him. I loathed myself for that, given that he was such a lovely bloke, but I couldn’t help it. He was a sufferer like the rest of us. Except he wasn’t like the rest of us. Denny had successfully controlled his disorder. Something that the rest of us had yet to achieve.

I shrugged. “Same as always.”

“Don’t feel like talking today?” Denny pressed.

I sighed, swallowing my aggression and speaking through gritted teeth. “Why bore everyone? I have nothing new to say. Existential dread rules my daily life. I still find myself not wanting to wake up. I still perform magical compulsions because I fear an unknown deity that puppeteers my every move – though the logical part of my brain knows that “deity” to be no more than my mental illness. But being self-aware doesn’t mean shit, does it? We’re all self-aware. And yet, we’re all still sick. Exposure and Response-Prevention only seems to work for you, Denny.”

“It’s an uphill battle, Zeke, but you can do this,” Denny assured me. “You’re fighting really hard. But you don’t have to push yourself beyond your ability, you know? Most of the people here are just trying to cope on a daily basis. It’s okay to–”

“– not be okay,” I finished, sighing. “I appreciate the sentiment, Denny, but I’m tired. Tired of living with this disorder. I don’t want to do compulsions anymore. I don’t want to just “cope”. I want to be like you. I want to get better. But how? How did you do it, Denny?”

The ever-kind, ever-robotic facilitator placated me with platitudes, and I felt unheard, as always. The rest of the two hours ticked by painfully slowly. And, at the end of the session, I slumped towards the doorway with my disheartened companions. But before I left, Denny surprised me.

“Zeke… Will you give me a minute of your time?” He asked.

I stepped to the side, allowing the last of the support group attendees to leave. Denny closed the door behind them.

“Let’s sit down for a second,” He said, motioning towards the empty chairs.

I raised an uneasy eyebrow, but followed the unusually-sombre facilitator to the circle of seats. If anything, I found myself staying out of curiosity. I’d never seen the man without a smile on his face. He looked as if he were about to deliver the worst news of my life. And, as it would happen, that wasn’t too far from the truth.

“What’s up?” I asked.

“You’re really determined,” He said. “The others just want an easy fix. A plaster for the wound. They don’t want to even try Exposure and Response-Prevention. But you’ve tried ERP, haven’t you? You’ve tried exposing yourself to your fears and preventing responses?”

I nodded. “Every day. The fear just morphs its face. There’s always a new existential dread. There’s always another unknown.”

“ERP is the gold-standard treatment,” Denny continued. “But that doesn’t mean it works for everyone. It didn’t work for me either. And I tried. Oh, I really tried. It was another route that led me to… Well, how desperate are you, Zeke?”

I frowned. “I’m desperate. But what… What did you do, Denny?”

“Something that changed me forever. Blind-Chicken Therapy.”

I tried to stifle a laugh. “Sorry, what?”

“You know the game, Chicken?” Denny asked. “Running across a road. Trying not to get flattened by a car. Yeah?”

“Yeah…” I started.

“Blind-Chicken Therapy involves doing that blindfolded,” He said.

I stopped smirking. “That doesn’t really seem like something a facilitator should be recommending to a sufferer at a support group.”

“No. It doesn’t,” Denny said.

“You shouldn’t be recommending any kind of medical treatment. So… Maybe we forget this conversation, and I go home?” I said, standing up.

Denny abruptly stood up too. “I was in a dark place, Zeke. A very dark place. And I know you’ve tried ending things. Well, so did I. And maybe part of me thought that playing Chicken might end with me… But it didn’t. And something amazing happened, Zeke. But something terrible at the same time… It worked. I mean, it really worked. My fears stopped taking hold.”

“I’m gonna go,” I said slowly.

At this point, worrying for the man’s state of wellness. And I’m ashamed to say that it gave me a little satisfaction to see him squirming for once. Not so perfect, after all, are you? I thought.

“It’s real, Zeke,” He said. “And I don’t want you to reach the end of your tether. I want you to survive.”

“Then why the fuck would you suggest something as horrible as Chicken?” I exasperatedly asked. “People die playing that game.”

“I know,” Denny hoarsely croaked. “But if you play Blind-Chicken… If you do it properly… It changes you, Zeke. I don’t know how to… I still have intrusive thoughts, but they come and go with the wind. My OCD doesn’t even exist anymore.”

“That’s impossible,” I said. “There is no cure for this illness. Therapy and treatment, sure, but no cure.”

“Well, I found one,” He said. “And it worked. Don’t you want to at least try? Better to meet your end trying to find a way to the light.”

I felt deeply sickened by that final sentence. What a disgusting notion. Perhaps what sickened me the most was that I was swayed by it.

“Running across a road blindfolded,” I said. “That cures all fear?”

“Yes,” Denny said.

“And how did you discover this miracle treatment?” I asked.

“A sufferer who did the same thing,” He said. “I called him crazy too. But, like you, I had nothing left to lose.”

“That’s a cruel thing to say,” I scoffed.

“It’s not a lie, though, is it?” Denny asked.

I didn’t reply.

“Listen…” He started, appearing serious and sullen once more. “It’s not… It’s not some placebo effect. It’s not about achieving euphoria through an adrenaline rush. Something… happens.”

I sighed, still believing the man to be crazy. “What do you mean, Denny?”

“I mean… Things happened afterwards. Things I couldn’t– still can’t explain.”

“Like what?” I asked.

“I just… I don’t know, Zeke,” He sighed, turning paler by the second. “No, this was wrong. I shouldn’t have suggested anything.”

“Is this reverse psychology?” I asked. “All part of the therapy?”

Denny shook his head. “I try to forget about what happened. And it’s all over now. As long as I live in my bubble… Look, just go home, Zeke.”

“Fuck you,” I said. “You don’t get to mess with my head. You of all people should know that I already have a scrambled mind. I’m doing it.”

Why did I decide to do it? Was it out of spite? Perhaps. But I think I might have felt it calling to me. The prospect of a way out. A life without Existential OCD. A life of certainty.

But that isn’t what I found.

“Zeke, please…” Denny pleaded.

The man followed me out of the building, and we walked through the busy town on a bitter, autumnal evening. He anxiously watched as I fashioned a blindfold out of the scarf in my coat pocket.

“This is your fault, Denny,” I said. “You were right. I’m a desperate man.”

The man floundered. “I’m sorry, okay? I’m sorry I screwed with your head, Zeke. But I was lying. It’s not real. There is no such thing as Blind-Chicken Therapy. I'm sick. I’m still sick, okay?”

“No, you’re not,” I said, more certain than I’d ever been before.

I stepped towards the edge of the main road, and I theatrically tightened the scarf around my head, secretly relishing in Denny’s panic. Screw that guy. Dangling a carrot before snatching it away. Well, I wouldn’t let him.

Once I’d blinded myself, the late-night traffic somehow sounded louder – more fearsome to my attuned ears. There was a constant roar of mindless machinery that threatened to grind my guts into the asphalt. Terror filled my body like a poisoned balloon.

“Fuck!” Denny cried. “Okay… You’re really going to do it, aren’t you?”

“I really am,” I replied. “Are you allowed to guide me?

“No, you have to face your fear blind… It’s about embracing uncertainty. And look, you need to do it properly…” He said. “In order for Blind-Chicken to work, it must be a busy road – a dangerous road. I think we’ve found one of those… And, perhaps most importantly, you need to focus on your theme of fear – your existential anxiety. Really focus on it.”

“This is sounding like superstitious nonsense, Denny…” I said.

“Good, then don’t fucking do it!” The man screamed.

The rational part of my brain told me that Denny simply feared for my physical safety in the face of oncoming traffic. But some other part of me – a primal, unthinking part – told me that something else lay at the heart of his frightened voice.

“For a man that has overcome his fear, you sure sound afraid,” I said, stalling for time.

“I’m not afraid of my intrusive thoughts,” He whimpered. “I’m afraid of… Something you see when you reach the other side of the road. There’s a price to pay. And you can move past it, but…”

“– Stop being so cryptic,” I said. “Just tell me what happens, Denny.”

“I can’t,” He cried. “It’s… Just believe me, Zeke. I shouldn’t have told you about this. It was a moment of madness. I was being selfish. I was thinking about how good my life has become. I was thinking about the now. But horrible things happened for me to get here, Zeke. I just… Don't make me say it. You don’t want to endure what I endured.”

“I want what you have, Denny,” I said.

My body moved without command. Even if I had wanted to stop, I don’t think I could have willed my way back to the pavement. After taking a couple of steps into the road, a deafening truck horn sounded. I quickened my pace, tuning out the sound of tyres scorching the road beneath my feet. I had never felt such fear – a very real fear, unlike the kind that usually plagued my ill mind.

Every metre felt like a mile. And the truck horn was swiftly joined by a cacophony of equally-deafening car horns. I heard the sound of metal biting into metal. A guilt that I carry with me to this day. And though I know it only took seconds for me to reach the other side of the road, it was a journey longer than words can describe. A darkened journey only of sound. But my ears told the story.

And when I removed my blindfold, I was faced with the scene of carnage. Fortunately, the driver of the delivery truck and the partially-crumpled BMW were both fine – though it could quite easily have been a different tale. But they had abandoned their vehicles and were beelining towards me.

Denny had vanished, and I was left to contend with the consequences of my actions. Did I feel fearless? A brave new man? Not at all. I sprinted from my victims, heart thumping rapidly. I managed to outrun them, and – half an hour later – found that I’d somehow travelled the entire way home on foot. I was severely winded once the adrenaline wore off, and I deeply regretted the events of the evening.

My illness had taken me to a new low. I was no longer only endangering myself. I had endangered others. And as I slumped into bed, wracked with shame, I thought I might never fall asleep. But I somehow found myself enveloped by a swift wave of blackness.

The superstition of a madman.

That’s what I told myself. I’d been conned. When I woke the next morning, I was furious. I’d nearly thrown away my life and the lives of many others. It wasn’t until I got to work that I realised something.

My thoughts weren’t sticking.

I’d already experienced a thousand existential thoughts by 10am. Thoughts that would usually instil me with a deep fear. And it wasn’t the adrenaline. No, I’ve experienced trauma before. My mother dying. A vicious beating in my youth. Stress exacerbates OCD. It makes one susceptible to intrusive thoughts. But I found myself viewing them as funny noises.

Tap 8 times to save yourself from an eternal hellscape.

Touch that wall in the right way to stop your girlfriend from dying.

Go through your safety mantras.

Thoughts that would usually rattle around in my brain for hours – thoughts that would either go away after I’d performed a compulsion or been distracted by a new thought. And yet, that wasn’t happening. My brain was different. It wasn’t interested in the thoughts. It wasn’t anxious. This was no placebo effect. Denny had been telling the truth, just as I’d suspected in the pit of my gut.

Blind-Chicken Therapy worked.

I rang him, half expecting the man not to answer, but he surprised me yet again.

“Feels good, doesn’t it?” He whispered before I had a chance to speak.

I gasped, tears forming in my eyes. “It’s… I can’t believe… Is this how normal people feel?”

“I don’t know, Zeke. But I think you need to–”

“– Boss is coming over,” I muttered, hanging up abruptly.

“No calls, please, Zeke,” Randy sighed. “Or was it one of your… compulsions?”

The short, rotund man squinted at me with beady, uncaring eyes. I regretted disclosing my illness, but I did so under the impression that the company would make reasonable adjustments for my disability. You’d love to fire me, wouldn’t you? I thought. You’re just waiting for an excuse that won’t be viewed as discrimination.

“It was somebody from my support group, actually,” I said.

Randy nodded, looking visibly disgusted by me. “Wait for your lunch break next time, please. No calls to the psych ward during work hours.”

A co-worker audibly gasped from across the room, and I found myself tightly gripping the edges of my desk in barely-veiled rage. Got you now, you fucker, I thought. Straight to HR. But I didn’t say that aloud. I just nodded my head and continued working. And yet, the room felt strange after that. Colder. Darker.

I glanced up from my screen, feeling the hairs on the back of my neck stand upright. Something wasn’t right. I eyeballed Randy through his office window.

And that was when I saw it.

A shadow hung over my barbaric boss. It painted the walls of his office. And for a flicker of a moment, it looked like a man – slender, ever-growing arms reaching towards Randy. In one hand, what looked like a syringe. And in the other hand, a phone.

I opened my mouth to screech, but I was too horrified to utter a sound. And a second later, Randy had looked up from his desk to see the shadow detaching itself from the wall. A blackened spectre, in the shape of a doctor, stood in the middle of the room. Body too large. Movement crooked and unnatural. My boss screamed piercingly as the entity raised the syringe and rapidly plunged it into the man’s forehead. And as Randy started to convulse, the wretched thing held out the phone in its other hand. I could hear it ringing.

Every worker in the room shot their eyes to the office window, but the spectre was gone. Randy was sitting with his head lolling from side to side on the back of his chair. Tongue hanging lazily from his mouth. Eyes wide and unseeing.

Paramedics arrived to take him away, and Randy was babbling incoherently.

“Work hours. No calls to the ward. No. No. No.”

My throat closed. I watched, pale-faced, as our unhinged boss was taken away. And after a brief stint in hospital, he was committed to a local psychiatric ward. Sickened doesn’t even begin to describe how I felt. I had ignored Denny. He’d warned me that I would pay a price for cheating Fear itself, and I ignored him. Well, he started to ignore me after that. No answering my calls. And we ended up with a new facilitator at our support group. I stopped going, eventually. Not just due to the fact that I’d overcome OCD.

Something else happened.

“I washed my hands,” Dad said.

“Huh?” I asked, absent-mindedly eyeballing the motorway ahead.

“Before touching the sandwich… I know you used to reject food if I’d touched it with unclean hands,” He continued. “But you’re driving, so…”

“No, it’s… fine,” I said, taking the sandwich with a spare hand.. “And I stopped caring about contamination a long time ago, Dad.”

“Right, right,” Dad said. “It’s, er, a fear of God now, right?”

“Well… Existential dread,” I said.

“Yes, that,” He nodded.

“I’m actually… better,” I whispered, almost choking on the words.

“Really? Therapy’s working, eh?” Dad gasped. “Wow, I’m glad to hear that, kiddo. You’ve come so far. You know… I remember when you were six. That time you threw up. Remember that?”

“Yeah… Lovely story, Dad,” I said.

“Well, that was how it started, wasn’t it?” He asked. “You became so scared of becoming sick after that. Emetophobia, right? Fear of throwing up? I remember. You were always washing your hands. And then it progressed to other fears. Weirder fears.”

“Dad…” I pleaded.

“I’m just saying,” He chuckled. “Look, I’m proud of you. And Mum would be proud of you too.”

“Thanks, Dad,” I said. “Let’s drop it.”

“Okay,” He smiled. “Here’s to not fearing vomit, eh?”

It all happened so quickly. My father made an unearthly sound. As if he were choking on something sharp and painful. I glanced over at him.

“You okay?” I asked.

My dad shook his head. He couldn’t speak. He was clutching his throat – no, clawing at his throat.

“Dad?” I cried.

Skin and blood collected under his fingernails, but it hadn’t started yet. I swerved in the road, and then I cast my gaze back to the road. Unwilling to endanger anyone again, I quickly pulled onto the hard shoulder.

And then it truly started. My father projectile-vomited a dark, unidentifiable substance. A never-ending substance. My eyes widened, and I found myself, once again, unable to voice my horror – unable to move or do anything to help him. I could only watch in silent horror as my father unleashed a never-ending stream of black bile onto the dashboard, his face turning redder and redder.

He turned his teary eyes to face me, unable to respond, as the life faded from his body. Unable to breathe, body clogged with vomit, he eventually collapsed forwards. The stream of bile ceased.

“Dad!” I cried again, finally able to speak.

I unclipped my seatbelt and ran around to the passenger side. Whatever force had gripped me, it finally released me – once it was too late. Not that I could have saved him anyway. Denny’s words of warning made sense at long last. And as I stood at the side of the motorway, staring at my dead father, ignored by passers-by, I was consumed by uncontainable rage.

Denny did this, I thought.

I didn’t call emergency services. I called my old facilitator yet again. And though he didn’t answer, I left a voicemail.

“You ruined my fucking life,” I muttered, growling. “And you can blame me, but you did this to me.”

I hung up the phone, slumped onto the grass, and tried to cry. But I was empty. Devoid of feeling. Stripped clean of all emotion by Blind-Chicken. Sitting at the end of the world. Nothing left to lose, Denny had said. Well, it seemed that was finally true.

And, after all of that, what I did not expect was for my phone to suddenly ring.

“Play it again,” Denny said. “If you want it to stop, you need to play it again.”

“I’ll fucking kill you,” I whispered.

“Okay,” He said. “But it’ll never stop.”

“What is it? What is this thing?” I screamed.

“I don’t have the answers for you, Zeke,” Denny cried. “But the only way to undo it is to repeat what caused it.”

“So my dad would die for nothing,” I spat. “And I’d go back to having OCD? No. To honour him, it needs to have meant something. Besides, it’s… got to be over now, right? You said it ended eventually.”

“I lied. It doesn’t stop. It’ll always hurt those around you. I only made things better by living life carefully – by not talking about my OCD. That’s what feeds it. Why do you think I was always so chipper at the support groups?” He said. “But I… I haven’t been brave enough to truly stop it. And I don’t want you to live a terrible life like mine. Isolated. Alone.”

“You don’t want me to live a terrible life…” I laughed. “This is Déjà vu. That’s exactly what you said before.”

“I’ve told you what you need to do. I’m sorry, Zeke.”

He hung up before I could say anything else. And I was left at the beginning again. Standing at the side of a busy road with a choice. But I’d already made my decision. And, bandaging my eyes with my scarf, I found myself ready to try Blind-Chicken again. But this time, haunted by my mistakes, I truly wished that I wouldn't make it to the other side – that a car would end my misery for good.

As I stepped forwards, blind to the world, I heard the screeching of tyres, the blare of horns, and the thump of metal bodies colliding – I broke my promise to myself, selfishly endangering others. I reached the barrier in the middle, almost tripping forwards, and I gently clambered over it, traversing the other side of the motorway. Further tyre screeches and horns sounded, as I pressed onwards as quickly as possible – trying desperately to endanger as few drivers as possible.

I was, in equal measure, relieved and disappointed to find my feet reaching the sturdiness of a grassy embankment at the other side of the road. I’d made it. I’d succeeded twice at Blind-Chicken.

As I removed the blindfold, I felt a weight descend upon my shoulders. Intrusive thoughts swarmed my mind, and an old enemy had returned – anxiety. But I was surprised to find that I embraced it with open arms. Finally. After thirty years of fighting.

Fear isn't something I’ll ever conquer. But I don’t have to conquer it. I just have to let it be. Learn to coexist. Desensitise myself to it. And after being cursed by an entity I’ll never hope to understand, I’ve learnt something about my particular theme of existential, supernatural fear.

Unknowns are okay.

I don’t know what cursed me, and I’ll likely never know. Yet, I still beat it – I still came out the other side.

So, no matter what my brain tells me, maybe I *can* survive fear.
