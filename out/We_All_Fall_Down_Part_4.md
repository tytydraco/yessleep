The ride back to my apartment was suffocating, the darkness outside pressing against the windows as if the night itself wanted to devour me. The laptop sat in the passenger seat, its screen dark but still radiating an ominous presence. My mind raced, replaying the events at St. Stephens Academy. I knew I had to uncover the connection between these cursed laptops and the monstrous figure that haunted me.

I arrived home, the silence of my apartment starkly contrasted to the chaos in my mind. The crucifix felt heavy in my pocket, a cold reminder of the thin line between reality and the supernatural that I had crossed. I placed the laptop on my desk and hesitated before opening it. My hand shook as I pressed the power button, the screen flickering to life.

The familiar desktop background appeared, but something was wrong. The icons seemed to shift and pulsate as if they were alive. My breath caught in my throat as the timestamp appeared again: 3:33 AM. The screen then filled with static, and through the distortion, I could make out shapes moving, writhing as if trapped in the digital ether.

Suddenly, the screen cleared, revealing a live video feed of a dark room. My heart skipped a beat as I recognized it—my apartment. The camera was positioned behind me, showing my hunched form, staring at the laptop. I whipped around, but the room was empty. Panic gripped me as I realized I was being watched, but by what?

I turned back to the screen, and the image had changed. The camera now panned to the bedroom door, which creaked open. A shadowy figure stood in the doorway, its eyes glowing red, the same malevolent presence that had tormented me since this nightmare began. It started to move toward me, slow, deliberate, savouring the terror that consumed me.

Desperation took over. I grabbed the crucifix, lighting the flame as Lady Lanter had shown me, and held it to the screen. The laptop hissed, the image distorting again, but the figure didn’t retreat this time. Instead, it leaned closer, its face filling the screen, a grotesque smile stretching across its features.

“Jack,” it whispered, the sound slithering into my mind, “you can’t escape. You belong to us now.”

The room began to warp, the walls bending inward like the space around me was collapsing. I staggered back, my vision blurring. The air grew thick, suffocating, as a chorus of children’s voices filled the room, singing that cursed rhyme:

“Ring around the Rosie…”

I clutched my head, trying to drown out the voices, but they only grew louder, more insistent.

“Ashes, ashes…”

I fell to my knees, the weight of the darkness crushing down on me, forcing me to the ground.

“We all fall down…”

The lights in the room flickered and died, plunging me into darkness. I could feel the presence closing in, its breath hot on my neck. I had to end this—somehow, I had to break free.

Summoning every ounce of strength, I dragged myself to the laptop and yanked the USB stick from its port. The screen went black, the voices silencing instantly. For a moment, there was nothing but the sound of my ragged breathing.

But then, slowly, the laptop screen flickered back to life, displaying a single line of text:

“It’s too late, Jack.”

Before I could react, the screen shattered, and from the fragments, the shadowy figure began to emerge, no longer confined to the digital world. My heart pounded in my chest as I fumbled for the crucifix, but this time, instead of holding it out in fear, I gripped it with determination. I remembered Lady Lanter’s words: “Hold it to this open flame to reveal the truth.”

I reignited the lighter, the flame burning brighter than before and thrust the crucifix into the blaze. The shadowy figure recoiled, hissing as the light from the crucifix intensified, filling the room with a blinding glow. The darkness around me seemed to waver, the malevolent force losing its grip.

"Not today," I whispered through clenched teeth, forcing myself to stand.

With the crucifix in one hand and the USB stick in the other, I knew what I had to do. I turned and ran toward the bedroom door, the light from the crucifix carving a path through the darkness. The figure screamed in rage, its form dissipating as I fled.

I raced through the hallway, the walls of my apartment warping and twisting as I passed, the malevolent force struggling to hold on to me. But with each step, the light from the crucifix grew stronger, burning away the darkness that sought to consume me.

Bursting out of my apartment, I sprinted down the stairs and into the street, the early morning light casting long shadows across the pavement. The figure’s screams faded into the distance as I finally broke free, collapsing onto the sidewalk, gasping for breath.
