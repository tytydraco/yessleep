Night 1 – Friday

I’ve been having trouble sleeping in my new apartment. After years of hard work, I finally landed a job that pays well enough for a nice place downtown—a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment on the third floor. I’ve been dreaming of this for so long, and now that I’m here, I should feel accomplished. Instead, I feel unsettled.

The apartment is fully furnished. My television sits on my new dresser. Outside, the first night of spring is crisp, and my large window overlooks Main Street, letting in the glow of streetlights and neon signs. To relax, I put on my comfort show, Grey’s Anatomy. The clock reads 10:30 p.m. I figure I can get through a few episodes before bed.

When I check the time again, it’s 1:45 a.m. I’m still wide awake, but my TV is off. Strange. I don’t remember turning it off. The city outside is still alive—cars passing, laughter, the occasional clatter of something falling over. I decide to take a look.

From my window, I have a clear view straight down Crowley Street. My apartment sits at the intersection of Main and Lewis, like the center bar of a capital H. Across the street, a couple stumbles out of a bar, calling for a cab. Further down, a group of college students leaves another bar, their voices loud and carefree.

I open my window to let the night air in. I don’t know why I suddenly feel the urge to people-watch, but here I am, sitting at my desk, observing the street below.

Then I see it.

At the far end of the street, a figure. Too far to make out any details, but something about it sends a chill down my spine. I tell myself it’s just a shadow or a trick of the light, but when I glance back, the figure hasn’t moved.

No, that’s not right. It has moved—just slightly. And it’s facing me.

I let out a small gasp, heart pounding. The blinds are down but slightly open, just enough for me to see out without anyone seeing in. Even so, I feel watched.

I slam the window shut, pull the blinds closed, and force myself into bed, trying to push the image out of my mind.

Night 2 – Saturday

I’m out with friends at the bar I saw last night. The memory of the figure has faded into the background, replaced by drinks, laughter, and music. By 11:30 p.m., I’m ready to call it a night. I offer my apartment to anyone who wants to crash, but everyone declines.

As I cross the street to my building, an eerie sensation creeps over me. The feeling of being watched. I pause, glance over my shoulder—nothing.

I hurry inside, locking the door behind me. My nightly routine is almost automatic now—change, brush my teeth, turn on Netflix. Grey’s Anatomy plays as I settle in, waiting for sleep to take over.

Then, a noise outside.

I glance at the clock. 1:45 a.m.

Pushing aside my hesitation, I walk to the window and peek through the blinds. The same homeless man with the shopping cart is there, just like last night. A drunken couple stumbles toward Crowley Street.

And then, the figure.

It’s closer this time.

My breath catches. The figure isn’t just a shadow—it’s a shape. A humanoid mass, flickering like old TV static. It doesn’t move, yet I know it sees me. I can’t explain how, but I feel its gaze.

I check the people walking nearby. No one reacts. No one even seems aware of it.

The figure lingers for a moment before slowly floating back into the alley, vanishing from sight.

Night 3 – Sunday

I convince my friend Bernie to stay the night.

“You were so excited about this place,” he reminds me. “You waited for this since college. You love the location, the view. And now you’re scared of the dark?”

I don’t argue. I just need someone else to be here.

We watch a movie in the living room, and I make him promise to stay awake until 1:45 a.m. I check the clock religiously.

9:30.
9:45.
10:25.
11:00.
12:10.
1:12.

When it finally hits 1:45, I nudge Bernie awake and pull him to the window.

At first, there’s nothing. Then, out of the alley, the figure emerges.

It’s closer. Only half a block away now. The static effect is fading, replaced by faint features, like a signal coming into focus.

I point. “There! Do you see it?”

Bernie squints. “See what?”

He sees nothing. But I do.

And then, at the edge of my vision, I notice something else—the homeless man. He’s frozen in place, staring down the street. His face is locked in an expression of pure terror.

He sees it too.

At 1:50, the figure vanishes again.

Night 4 – Monday

I go to a 24-hour diner at the corner of Crowley and Main, determined to get answers. I order a milkshake and watch the window.

At 1:30 a.m., I brace myself. Any minute now, it’ll appear.

But before I see anything, there’s a loud crash. The homeless man—Simon, as the cook calls him—has dropped a bag of cans. He looks rattled.

I get up to talk to him, but then—

Beep

My watch hits 1:45 a.m.

I whip around to the alley.

Nothing.

I turn back, nearly jumping out of my skin—Simon is sitting right in front of me. Silent. Staring.

“You saw that thing too,” I whisper.

Simon doesn’t answer. He just stands and leaves.

That night, I sleep soundly.

But below, in the street, the figure has moved even closer. It’s almost fully human now.

Night 5 – Tuesday

I invite my friends over for a late housewarming party—Taco Tuesday, drinks, Cards Against Humanity. Everything feels normal again.

Until Bernie brings it up.

“He was shaking the other night,” he tells everyone. “Said someone was outside his window.”

“It’s nothing,” I lie. But my watch beeps. 1:45.

And just like before, I start trembling.

Bernie notices. “Yeah, that happened the other night too.”

“Fine,” I say. “Follow me.”

We go to the window.

I see it immediately.

It’s right below us.

Frozen in fear, I realize—it doesn’t look like a shadow anymore. It looks like a person.

“Greg… Greg… Greg.”

My friends call my name, trying to pull me out of my trance.

I break free, gasping. My nose is bleeding.

Bernie shrugs. “I’m going home.”

Then—Naomi screams.

“Don’t open the door.”

A crash outside. A high-pitched, inhuman screech.

And then—silence.

Night 6 – Wednesday

Naomi stayed. She demands answers.

A knock at the door interrupts us.

I step in front of her, peering through the peephole.

It’s Simon.

I hesitate before opening it.

“…Hello?”

Simon steps inside like he belongs there. His orange shirt is riddled with holes, his jeans caked in grime. The stench is overwhelming.

Naomi backs away.

Simon meets my eyes. “You saw it,” he says.

I swallow hard.

“…Yes.”

“What is it?”

Simon’s expression darkens.

“You don’t wanna know.”

Before I could ask more of a demand. My watch beeps… 

1:45 am

Confused, how 5 hours had passed we all make our way to the window…

We all look and look then Naomi says “there” 

The thing looked 

I tremble… like 
Me…

Naomi looks at me then Simon and then down… the thing is moving… not away… up..

We close the blinds in a panic.then a knock at the door.
