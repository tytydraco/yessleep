Fatal Insomnia 

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1gnb1t1/broken_by_one_night_mdma/) is the real-life story of a bed becoming a death bed. 

It all started after one Friday night out mixing party drugs. 

My case may rank among the most adverse, life-changing neurotoxic drug reactions of all time. I know I’m the exception to the rule, not the rule.

But I also know I’m not alone. I’m not the only one.

If I had any idea I was playing the lottery that night, even at one in a billion odds, even a trillion, I would never have taken the pill handed to me. I loved my life too much to risk it. What hit my brain, eventually took away the best parts of me. I can’t make sense of why it happened, nor will I ever. It’s too crushing.

I’ll also always wonder what good was waiting just around the corner in life if only I’d dropped the pill in my hand. It’s too much to think about now. I made the wrong choice and it’s done. I can’t explain fate. I wasn’t perfect, but I didn’t deserve this. No one does.

For 999,999 people out there, this reaction will never occur, and, since the chances are slim, you’ll probably not read this story. I would have too. Before that night, I never worried. I didn’t know the first thing about medicine, the brain, or drugs. I never stressed. I was living a charmed life and got lucky at each turn. Everything just worked and was good. I was living. That was me and many of you. I hope all of you. I’m jealous you’re still in that world, the one I had for 43 unforgettable years.

But for the next one-in-a-million out there, just maybe, [my story](https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1gnb1t1/broken_by_one_night_mdma/) gives pause before plugging chemicals into your brain with the power to reshape it in unforeseen ways. Each of us makes our own choices, but from where I stand now, life is too precious to gamble toying with its supercomputer. Our mind is our universe and because it surrounds us, it feels like it will always be the same. But the truth is we don’t understand this universe, let alone what can throw off its axis and rotation for good. I learned too late.

I was once the luckiest. Those who saw, saw pure happiness. I had it all, in my hands, the best parts of a life in the making. But from dreamland to dreamlessness, it slipped away, piece by piece, ripped from my fingers, stripped bare, carried off, a thief in the night, night after night, every night, endlessly, until it all vanished, the ruins of insomnia.

Sleep is like true love. It finds you when you’re not looking. It fills you with dreams. Its melody is a nocturne. And when you lose it, you lose everything.

There is one difference. Everyone knows sleep. Few ever know true love. I could never have known it then, but I lost both that same night.

I wish I never had this story to tell. I’d give up anything to go back in time. It’s a “what-if” moment I’ve replayed ten thousand times, what feels like every hour, sometimes every minute. I can’t change the past, but I hope my story makes this journey useful to another’s future.

Here it is…
