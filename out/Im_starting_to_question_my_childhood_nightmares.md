My mom has always been great. My father died when I was little, and ever since then, it always felt like my mom was constantly doing something at home, always cleaning or cooking or dusting or decorating, like she was practically in two places at once. So when she called to ask me to come home and take care of the dogs for a week while she was away, I was obliged to say yes. I was excited to come home, eager to see my old pets. 

Unfortunately, due to my work schedule and the timing of her flights, I wasn’t able to see her when I arrived home. She just left a key under the doormat and a usual note typical of a mom making lunch for her small kid. Walking inside, I felt a warmth wash over my mind and body, both literally and emotionally with the weight of being home after a long time away. The first day being home was fun. Wandering around the halls and rooms of our large home reminiscing of time well spent, and playing with my two dogs, Steely and Dan.

Once night had fallen, I did a final walk around the house, making sure all the doors were locked. At my mother’s request, I put both Steely and Dan in their respective cages in the living room, and I turned out all the lights. I walked down the long hallway of family photos to the two doors at the end that split into my room and my brother’s room, separated by just a thin wall. My bedroom is painted with bright green walls and covered in old posters for movies I liked as a kid, with all my old clothes and toys still in my closet, with its two swinging doors hanging open. 

When I was a child, I had a very active imagination. I would see and hear things that weren’t really there. I was often terrified to walk through my house or my backyard at night, fearing what may rest just beyond my vision. If you had asked my mom, she would have attributed my temperament to the ghost shows I’d watch on TV when I was little. 

There are a couple memories that stand out to me in particular. One night when I was seven or eight, I had a vivid nightmare. In the dream, I woke up in my bed in the middle of the night, and I got up and crept into the hallway, trying to be quiet, sneaking on my tippy-toes, hoping that my mom wouldn’t catch me up past bedtime. I wandered into the living room, the floorboards creaking and groaning under my weight. The only light came from a lamp sitting in the corner of the room, casting long shadows that spread across the room like dark fingers. The house opens into a large dining room and kitchen area from there, and I wandered to the dining table. The door to the backyard is along the back wall of the dining area, and it was completely gone, opening a wide hole in the wall that displayed the large, dark expanse of the backyard.

My house is built on a hill in which the front of the house is level with the ground and the back of the house is elevated off the ground, creating a large crawl space underneath, and a wooden deck right at the entrance of the backyard. I walked to where the door should be and took a step outside onto the wooden deck. At that moment, I felt the cold night air hit me like a truck and a large groan from under my feet expelled from the wood as I put my weight on it. I looked down at the deck, unsure as to where the groaning sound originated. My eyes focused on the cracks between the slats that exposed the crawl space underneath, and my mind imagined what may lie down there, watching me with hungry eyes.

I looked back up, immediately spotting a completely black human figure with only a visible silhouette, standing at the far end of the yard. The spotlight on the corner of the house faintly illuminated this part of the yard, making the sight of this figure clear to me. A paralyzing wave of fear washed over me, and I could hardly move. The figure began to run at full speed towards me. I stepped shakily back into the house, and grasped at the air hopelessly, failing to recognize the lack of a door to close, to separate me from the entity. By the time it got up the stairs of the deck, I was trying to scream for help, no sound seeming to pass through my lips no matter how hard I tried. Just as it reached me, I woke up from the dream. I sat in bed, drenched in sweat and shaking. I looked towards my closed closet door, and felt an overpowering presence, like someone stood just behind it, waiting for me to open the door and let it in. I hid under my covers for the rest of the night, unable to sleep at all, my mind straining in fear for hours until daylight.

As I grew older, I had less and less of the nightmares and night terrors I used to experience. I would still at times see things in the dark, but they didn’t scare me like they used to. I guess age gave me the confidence to trust the safety of my own home. After graduating high school, I got a job and was able to make enough money to move out and live on my own. By then, the old nightmares and all the things that used to creep me out were completely gone. At the same time, it was the first time in my life I truly felt alone. And it wasn’t just that I wasn’t with my family anymore; there was this strange sense that some looming power was no longer watching me. After a while, I forgot what it had been like growing up. These old feelings and memories faded away. 

But then, sitting there in my old bed as a grown man, these feelings slowly crept back. I suddenly remembered all the times I sat in bed scared, thinking I had heard creeping through the hallway to my room. I shrugged it off, attributing it to the excitement of being home again. Soon, I turned out the lights and the only light left came from the faded street lamps that poured through the cracks in between my window blinds. I slowly faded to sleep, childlike comfort washing over me.

I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of both of the dogs barking. Sighing, I got out of my bed and walked out of the room. As soon as I opened the door, a cool wave of air hit me, my spine tingling at the sensation. Ignoring it, I walked through the hall directly into the living room, where both of the cages were. Steely and Dan were barking at the top of their lungs, and both were scratching at the metal frames. I knelt down in front of the cages to see them better. Both of the dogs ignored my presence, instead staring directly past me down the next hallway that led to my mother’s bedroom. 

At that moment, I suddenly felt a strong sensation of being watched, and I turned around to see what the dogs were barking at. I stared directly down the hall they faced, which was pitch black. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up as I got off the ground and inched towards the light switch at the close end of the hall. I couldn’t help but imagine something staring at me in the dark, some person or ghost watching me, just barely out of my sight. Like ripping off a band-aid, I sheepishly braced as I flipped the switch. With the light on, I saw nothing. Just another hall of picture frames with a couple shut doors along the sides and end. After that, the dogs started to settle down. I figured they had just scared each other into thinking there was an intruder or something, and I calmed down myself. I walked back to bed and fell asleep.

I woke up the next morning in the flowerbed in the backyard. I was sweaty and covered in dirt. I got up, confused and with a pounding headache. What the hell happened? I hadn’t sleepwalked in years, not since I was a kid. Walking back to the deck, I noticed a kid-sized hole in the side of the deck leading into the crawl space that had always been there since I was small enough to fit in it. The door to the dining room opened with no issue, and I figured I had unlocked it while I had been sleepwalking. I let the dogs out of their cages and took them to the back door, sending them out to do their business.

Out of curiosity, I walked to the front door. Strangely enough, it was unlocked. I took a quick run around the house, checking every door. They were all unlocked. Every. Single. One. Had I really done all of that in my sleep? That seemed to make sense, until I checked the door along one of the back walls that has always had furniture sitting in front of it. That door has always been locked and has always been inaccessible. Did I move all the furniture, unlock it, and then put it all back? I’m not sure.

It's now noon and I’m sitting here writing this in my bedroom. I always thought that what I experienced as a kid was really just due to an active imagination and all the horror movies I’d seen. But after this morning, I’m kind of wondering if maybe there was something to it, beyond just me being crazy. I’ll update later if anything else weird happens.
