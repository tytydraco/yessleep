So, it's been a while.

I thought I would be done with this whole mess.

 Turns out there is more to this whole fucking story.

Me and my wife, Roxanne are now 41 and 40 respectively, we have a 3 year old son now, and we are pretty well off because of our organization.

In case anyone is new, me and Roxanne used to be in jail back in the day where we started dating. 

I was arrested for drug possession and she was arrested for accidentally killing her ex boyfriend.

 When we were imprisoned, we met one of the scariest people in my life.

Judith. Motherfucking Judith. I don't know what the hell she was.

 All I knew was that despite her short, petite body, she was strong, fast, and ruthless. 

She scared her cellmates, brutally attacked guards and prisoners, and tried to go after us before being shot and presumably killed.

The thing that made her more terrifying was her constant joyous smile.

 And the one time she didn't smile was when I stopped a younger, weaker inmate from hanging with her. 

Not that it mattered, because that poor girl had her head ripped off.

That bitch is the reason I am now an amputee with a prosthetic leg and why my wife is now missing an ear.

We thought she died when an officer shot her. But her body disappeared from the morgue and some strange occurrences happened in the area.

One day, we heard a knock at the door. I answered and it was an officer. The officer was male and fairly chubby with a mustache that looked like a caterpillar.

"Are you Carrie and Roxanne King?" He asked.

"Yes. Can I help you?"

"I just need your help with something. I picked up a case that you and your wife might know about."

I nodded and let him in.

"Roxy!" I called. "We have a guest!"

"I'll be there soon! Just gotta put Joey down for a nap!" Roxanne called from a different room.

Roxanne came in and we all sat down.

"So, I was told you both have a connection with some woman named Judith, is that right?"

I could see Roxanne's dark eyes widen and gritting her teeth. I held her hand to comfort her.

"Yes. She killed everyone in the Metropolitan Correction's Center and is why I have a prosthetic and why my wife has one ear." 

The officer wrote it down. "Well, the reason I asked is that whenever we searched the prison and heard her body disappeared. We found this journal under her mattress. I figured we all look through this. You two and Officer Rains were the only survivors and I'm sure you have had questions about her."

I looked at Roxanne. She squeezed my hand and seemed hesitant. She took a deep breath and exhaled. 

"Might as well. I didn't lose an ear for nothin'."

The diary itself didn't look like it belonged to a young woman. It was all pink and frilly and had a lock on it. I recognized the brand as a Totomi journal because my little sister had the same brand as Judith. But my sister was 10 and Judith had to have been at least 19 to 25 years old.

"Anyone know how to pick a lock? We couldn't find the key to this thing."

Roxanne smiled and got up. She came back with a screwdriver small enough to fit in the keyhole. She jiggled it until it opened.

The officer opened it and this is what it read on the first entry.

January 1st, 2003

I was made today. I could see everyone around me in white clothes with writing thingies. Everyone keeps touching me and asking me questions that don't make sense.

January 14th 2003

I was told to pick up a big rock and throw it. I picked it up and it felt like holding a bunch of grapes. I threw it with no effort and it broke.

February 14th, 2003

One of the white clothes people fixed my face so I had more emotions. I really liked being able to smile, so I do it all the time. But everyone seems to fear it.

I don't understand. I thought people liked smiles?

March 27th 2003

The people are so confusing. They want me to be strong and fast, but when I am strong and fast, they get angry.

I threw one of the people into the wall after he yelled at me for destroying a door by running into it. I saw his head bleed a crimson liquid much like mine. 

But he never came back nor did he repair the injury.

The wording was weird here. Judith barely sounded like a person. More like a child or someone who was literally born yesterday.

We kept reading.

August 17th, 2003

My intelligence increased a lot. The scientists put me through tests all the time. How strong am I? How fast can I run? How smart am I? 

The more I'm around everyone, I realize how different I am. 

They eat much like me, but I don't produce waste.

When they are hurt, they don't just fix it immediately.

They have these things called genitalia between their legs when I don't and have babies.

They are also weak and slow compared to me. 

What am I?

October 31st, 2003

I want to go out. But no one lets me.

They say I am not ready. But, I am strong and brave.

I see people outside my window go out and have fun while I am stuck inside having to do these stupid, stupid tests!

I am a person! I am a person! I am a person!


The most we gleaned from this is that Judith isn't a normal human if she is one at all. But, we wouldn't know unless we kept reading.

December 28th, 2003

I hate it here. I hate my cell. I hate scientists. I hate the constant tests. I hate being poked and prodded and asked a bunch of questions! 

I hate everyone and everything in this garbage facility!

After that, most of the pages had some damage on it that made everything ineligible. But, we got to the one that piqued our interest.

June 13th, 2007

I broke everyone. Everyone is gone. I'm alone. I'm free.

June 24th, 2007

I was taken away to another prison. No one ever questioned my humanity. Not at all.

I was across from two ladies who were both very pretty. One was tan with short black hair and wore a white top and the other had brown skin with long beautiful braids. 

I told them I was named Judith since I had no name.

I was fixated on them. I wanted to be friends.

June 25th, 2007

My cellmate wouldn't stop bothering me last night. She kept asking dumb questions. 

I learned that she had been arrested for robbery.

I told her that her robbery was because she was a pathetic waste of space that thinks that stealing from others will fill some sort of need within her.

She made strange noises and water came from her eyes. I recognized it as crying, but I didn't care because she wouldn't stop asking me stupid questions.

She was moved and a big woman came in to have a talk with me. She also kept asking me a bunch of stupid questions, so I jumped on her and pulled out her eye.

I showed the two pretty girls the eye to impress them. They didn't smile.

Me and Roxanne looked at each other. Judith actually liked us.

June 30th, 2007

Everyone is scared of me. 

No one wants to be around me. But, I like to look at the two pretty ladies in the cell across from me. 

I see them cuddle and hold each other's hands. 

They liked each other, but not me. What did I do?

July 3rd, 2007

I hate them. I hate them I hate them I hate them I hate them
I hate them I hate them I hate them I hate them
I hate them. I hate them I hate them I hate them I hate them
I hate them I hate them I hate them I hate them

I tried to make a new friend but the short haired lady took her away. And then I thought my new friend just walked away.


I hate them. I hate them I hate them I hate them I hate them
I hate them I hate them I hate them I hate them
I hate them. I hate them I hate them I hate them I hate them
I hate them I hate them I hate them I hate them

I hate them all. I want to break them all.

That was all that was in the diary. Me and Roxanne didn't know what to think. 

"Oh my god…." I mouthed.

The officer closed it. "This goes deeper than any case I had. And I have dealt with worse. Which is why I want your help with finding her."

"Sir, may we be excused?" Roxanne asked.

The officer nodded and let us discuss it.

"Carrie. I don't know about this."

"Roxy, I think it might be best for us to at least help. Judith could be out there and I don't want her hurting more people. That wouldn't be good for my conscience."

"Carrie! That monster ripped your leg off! I don't want her to hurt you more!"

I held Roxanne's hand. "If we took her out the first time, we can take her out again. We got this."

Roxanne seemed more relaxed and smiled. "Okay. I'll stay with Joey."

Me and the officer left the house and drove to the morgue where Judith's body was last seen.

We looked around for clues both in and out of the morgue. Nothing inside stood out, but outside is where things got interesting.

We found a knife that had blood that had since dried. The officer put the knife in the evidence bag.

We went to the station to see if anything about it leads to anything. The knife had fingerprints that belong to Judith, but the blood doesn't appear to be normal blood. Infact, it doesn't seem to be blood at all. It doesn't belong to anyone.

We both went outside so I could be taken home. 

As we walked, I felt a familiar sense of dread.

Behind me, I heard the officer scream and then the sounds of flesh and bones being torn.

I turned around and felt my blood run cold.

Judith was standing there with the officer ripped in half vertically, but she changed entirely.

Her once strawberry blonde hair became completely white, her emerald eyes bloodshot, and worst of all; she now had a glasgow grin that made her mouth wider. She hasn't aged a day and now wore a white dress now stained with red.

"Miss me, Carrie?" Judith asked. 

She no longer had that happy voice. She was now coldhearted and empty like a lake.

"What the fuck-? How are you alive?"

"SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!" Judith roared. "STOP ASKING ME SUCH RIDICULOUS QUESTIONS!!!!"

I ran to the car and jumped in. Judith didn't move, instead she gave a little smile. Unlike before, the smile was smug.

I drove home and ran inside. I was horrified by what I saw.

I saw the house was trashed and Roxanne wrapping her arm with gauze. It was bleeding. Next to her was a knife with blood.

"Roxy! Are you okay!?"

"I'm fine." Roxanne grunted. "But we have bigger issues."

"What?! Where's Joey?" I asked, now worried.

I saw Roxanne tear up. "Judith. That bitch took Joey."

I fell to my knees. I couldn't believe what I heard.

After a moment of disbelief, I was now full of ungodly amounts of rage. The kind any mother would have if someone stole your kid.

"Roxy. Get the gun."

Roxanne nodded and got up.

As soon as she got the gun, we drove to where we last saw Judith.

We looked around and asked questions if they saw a white haired woman in a white stained dress had been seen anywhere.

We got some information from an old lady who claimed to have seen a woman with the exact description with our son walking inside an abandoned building.

I got the address and we drove to the location. We walked in ready to shoot Judith for taking our son for whatever reason.

As we walked, we saw a glimpse into Judith's mind. On the walls were newspaper clippings and images of us with tears, rips, and sharp objects stabbed in them.

Roxanne got ahead of me and looked behind a corner. She stopped me and we peeked in.

Inside was a room decorated with pink walls, furniture, and stuffed animals. We saw Judith with Joey who was still asleep. She cradled him and swayed him, humming 'Hush Little Baby' to him as she did.

I felt sick watching her do this. That was our son! She took him away from us and for what!?

Me and Roxanned looked to each other for a plan to get Joey out of there safely.

We moved away from the corner and discussed the plan.

Roxanne looked around and saw a brick. She picked it up and threw it away from the opening to the room to the foyer as far as she could with a loud clatter.

We waited for Judith to walk out and investigate. She walked out.

We waited until she was out far enough for us to get in and get Joey.

I decided to keep watch and while Roxanne got Joey. She handed me the gun to defend myself with.

I held the gun, ready to blow that wide mouthed bitch's brains out for hurting my wife and stealing my kid.

Roxanne came out with Joey who was now awake.

"Mama Rox? Where are we?" Joey asked, rubbing his eyes in confusion.

"It's okay, Joey Roo." Roxanne said quietly. "We just got in some trouble. We'll be home soon."

I heard Judith yell. "Who's there!?" 

"Go, Roxy! I'll take her out!" I instructed quietly.

Roxanne ran out with Joey through a fire escape.

Judith walked back and saw me. "Oh, hello Carrie. Wasn't Roxy here?"

"Shut up! Only I call her Roxy! You stole my son!"

Judith snickered. "I just wanted to play with him. Am I not allowed to be Aunt Judith?" 

"You were never allowed to be Aunt Judith! I never wanted you to be Aunt Judith! We are not friends and never will be! You killed people, hurt my wife twice, and made me an amputee! You traumatized me!"

Judith cocked her head, as if what I said confused her. Her expression looked a bit sad.

Then it turned to anger.

She ran towards me. I shot at her feet which slowed her down enough for me to get a good distance from her.

I ran back a bit. I saw her basically crawl towards me like a spider.

"You! You! You! I hate you!!!" Judith screamed like a petulant child.

She jumped on me and pinned me down. Judith twisted the gun out of my hand and threw it.

"Fuck. You." I strained out.

Judith didn't say anything. 

She raised her hand and balled it into a fist.

I braced myself for what she would do. 

Then I heard gunshots and Judith screaming.

I opened my eyes to see Judith with bullet holes in her chest. I looked to see Roxanne with the gun, shaking and panting. I pulled myself away and Judith fell on her back.

I ran to Roxanne and hugged her. 

Judith was groaning. We both walked to her and looked down.

Judith was spitting up blood and had tears in her eyes. "I….J-just…Wanted…t-to be..Your…F-f-friends…."

I held out my hand and Roxanne handed me the gun. I aimed it at her forehead and shot her. Her eyes rolled back and they closed.

"Roxy, where's Joey?"

Roxy guided me to a room where Joey was sitting there watching cartoons on his tablet with headphones.

I smiled. "I'll take care of her."

I picked up Judith's body and put her in my car. I grabbed some ropes, chains, a sheet, and bricks.

I knew that Judith might come back, so might as well try to slow her down.

When I got home, I wrapped her in the sheet, tied her up, and chained her to the bricks.

I drove to the Hudson River and tossed her in.

I drove home, relieved that I might never have to deal with Judith for a while. As I drove, I thought of her entries and her words.

 In some way, I pity her. 

If she didn't grow up in that environment, she might have been different. She could have been a very sweet person if she had a loving environment.

 The way she talked and acted seemed more like the thoughts of a naive, albeit violent and angry child.

I get it, I grew up as a very angry child of abuse. It's one of the reasons I got into drugs and ended up in jail.

But, it obviously doesn't excuse what she did.

Everything's been normal after that event. 

But, we have been staying prepared for Judith so that if she comes back, we'll be ready to do it all again.
