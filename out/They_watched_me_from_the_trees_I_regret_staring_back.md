The air was thick with the scent of pine and the distant echo of laughter. I sat on the porch of the old cabin, the wood creaking beneath me, watching as the sun dipped below the horizon. The golden hour was always my favorite, the way it painted the world in soft, warm hues. It was the last night of our annual family reunion, a tradition since I was a kid. But this year was different.

Grandpa had passed last winter, leaving the cabin to us. He died peacefully, I hope, sitting on his front porch, looking into the forest as he always did. It didn’t feel the same without his booming laugh, his endless stories about the woods. But we all agreed to keep the tradition alive, even if it felt a little emptier.

“Hey, you okay?” My cousin Sam asked, sitting down beside me. He handed me a marshmallow, perfectly toasted, just how I liked it.

“Yeah,” I lied, taking a bite. The sweetness melted on my tongue, but it did little to ease the unease settling in my stomach. “Just…thinking.”

Sam nodded, his gaze drifting to the trees. “You know, Grandpa always said there was something special about these woods. Like they were alive, watching over us.”

I smiled at the memory, but it didn’t reach my eyes. “He always had a way of making everything sound *magical*.”

The fire crackled in the distance, the others were still gathered around, sharing ghost stories and roasting marshmallows. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off, that something was watching us.

“Remember that old story Grandpa used to tell us?” Sam’s voice was quieter now, almost a whisper. “The one about the forest spirits?”

I did. It was one of his favorites, about ancient spirits that lived in the woods, protecting them from anyone who meant harm. But there was another part to the story, one he only told us once. A darker more sinister side.

“He said *they could take you*,” I murmured, the words feeling heavy on my tongue. “If you disrespected the forest, if you didn’t honor it, they’d take you, make you one of them.”

"Worst of all, if you died within the forest, you're soul is *eternally* confined to it. Stuck with no choice, you slowly turn into them. Slowly forgetting *who* or *what* you were."

Sam shivered from what he just said, his expression unreadable. “Do you believe it?”

I shrugged, trying to shake off the chill creeping up my spine. “I don’t know. It was just a story, right? I wouldn't know what feel thinking gramps is one of those forest spirits.”

Before Sam could respond, a **scream** pierced the air. It was sharp, terrified, and cut off abruptly. We both shot up, hearts pounding in unison.

“That was from the fire,” I said, already moving towards the sound.

We ran through the trees, the shadows growing longer, darker. When we reached the clearing, the fire was still burning brightly, but everyone was gone.

“*Guys*?” Sam called out timidly, his voice shaking slightly. “Where are you?”

The only answer was the crackling of the flames and the whisper of the wind through the trees.

“This isn’t funny!” I yelled, my voice cracking from anger mixed with fright. “Seriously, come out now!”

*Silence.*

Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw movement. A figure stepped out from behind a tree, and relief washed over me.

“Ben?” I called out, recognizing my younger cousin. But as he stepped closer, the relief turned to dread. His eyes were hollow, black as the night sky, and his skin was pale, almost translucent.

“Ben?” Sam’s shaky voice was barely a whisper now.

Ben didn’t respond. He just stared at us, unblinking, head tilted to the side, before slowly raising his hand to point at the trees.

I followed his gaze, and that’s when I saw them. Dozens of figures, just like Ben, standing silently among the trees, their eyes empty, their faces expressionless. *Looking down at us* from the branches they stood on. The visual of flickering illumination from the dancing camp fire hitting one side of their faces was enough to make the back of my neck sweat.

The primal fear in my body was potent, it's like my body knew I was in danger before my brain did.

“We have to go. Now.” I whispered, grabbing Sam’s arm.

But he didn’t move. He was frozen in place, staring at Ben, or what was left of him.

“*Sam*,” I hissed, shaking him. “We have to go. Right. Fucking. Now.”

Finally, he tore his gaze away and nodded. We turned and ran, the figures watching us silently as we fled.

When we finally reached the cabin, we slammed the door shut behind us and locked it before taking a deep breath, hearts racing. But the unease didn’t fade.

“W-what were those things?” Sam asked, his voice trembling.

“I don’t know,” I whispered, glancing out the window. The woods were still, the figures nowhere in sight. But I knew they were there, watching, preying.

“We need to leave,” I said, my voice firmer now. “We need to get out of here.”

But as I turned to grab my keys, the door creaked open.

But, we locked it. *Didn't we*?

We both froze, staring as the door slowly swung wide, revealing the darkness beyond.

And then I heard it. A voice, soft, familiar.

“*Stay*.”

It was like Grandpa’s voice, but twisted, wrong.

“*Stay with us.*” the voice whispered again, and I realized with a cold dread that it wasn’t coming from outside.

It was coming from *within* the cabin.
