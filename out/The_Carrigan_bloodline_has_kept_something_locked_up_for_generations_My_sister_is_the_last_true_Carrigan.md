It started when my mother died.

The unknown number introduced themselves as Harold Tawney from Tawney & Sons, a local funeral parlour just south of Saltpenny. He delivered the news like I already knew it—courteous, flat, like a weatherman reporting on some distant tornado that had torn through someone else’s town, left behind somebody else’s wreckage. She’d been dead a while, he told me, left sitting around in the open Louisiana heat long enough that he was quick to suggest a closed-casket service.

I told him that wouldn’t be necessary, that I’d probably just get her cremated, and besides—who the hell in Saltpenny would be seen dead paying their respects at the casketside of Bonnie-Ann Carrigan?

A beat of silence on the line.

Tactful. Respectful. But just long enough to tell me he secretly agreed.

‘Well, then,’ he puffed, sighing like this was his burden to share. ‘I’d get on down here right quick, then. Get things settled ‘fore the rains come. You know, uh—’ there was a careful clearing of his throat, ‘Abilene’s still here. Might be you gotta find her a new livin’ situation, now her ma’s gone.’

‘Jesus,’ I muttered, ignoring Harold Tawney’s little inhale of Christian indignation at the phrase. ‘She’s still there?’

I hadn’t thought about my sister in years. Truth be told, she was easy to forget. What I remembered was mostly just her slumped in that rickety wheelchair, positioned so she could stare through that drafty circular window overlooking Hangman’s Creek. Mumma used to say she liked counting the rabbits that’d push through the undergrowth, but I don't know if I believe that.

The night I left for good—kicking and screaming, clawing at the doorframe while CPS pried my little fingers from the splintering wood—I remember calling her name. ‘Abi! Abi!’ Like my fractured, ghost-eyed sister would somehow find herself and come to my aid.

But there was enough lingering loyalty pulsing through my veins that I took a couple of weeks off work, packed the sedan and set out for Saltpenny. It took three solid days of driving and each mile closer to my destination sent goose pimples dancing across my skin. When I finally saw that familiar, battered sign ‘welcome to Saltpenny’—I had to pull over, put my head between my knees and focus on my breathing. Even the smell was the same.

It slipped through the half-cracked windows—keeled-over nature left to rot, asphalt warmed by too many summers, petrichor rising up from thirsty earth. Beneath it all, the faint, briny tang of the sealine where the water tangled itself into the mangroves, dragging the salt deep into the roots.

Saltpenny was more bones than body now, a worn-down main street lined with dusty display windows, their glass streaked with years of neglect. Faded yellow signs still clung to the doors—CLOSING DOWN SALE! EVERYTHING MUST GO!—but everything had already been gone a long time.

I stopped at a gas station to top up and buy some snacks.

It’s a testament to how frozen in time this shithole is, because the eyes that followed me—this outsider with bare shoulders and a tattoo snaking up her neck—knew me by name, never mind that the last time anybody laid eyes on me, I was hollering and bucking in the back of a police cruiser almost twenty-five years ago.

*That’s Bonnie-Anne Carrigan’s kid, alright.*

They didn’t have to say it out loud. Their eyes did the talking. Dust-shot and narrowed, they dragged over me like a slow-moving tide and found me wanting. *The apple don’t fall far.*

I didn’t linger.

When I pulled up outside the house, the place looked exactly as I left it, down to the last peeling curl of paint, the same wasp nests fattening under the eaves. The house sat slumped on its stilts, the wood warped from years of bayou rot, leaning into the shade of a broad-armed cypress whose roots ran gnarled and deep into the blackwater of Hangman’s Creek.

It should’ve collapsed by now. Should’ve sunk into the mud and been swallowed whole.

I stepped through the creaky front door, letting out a breath like I’d been punched in the gut. The air inside was thick with time, a snapshot frozen in place. The place was worn, but clean—smelled of Lysol and mothballs.

On the dining table, a calling card sat untouched. Louisiana State Social Services. So Abilene hadn’t been completely abandoned, then.

The stairs groaned beneath my weight as I climbed. The hallway upstairs seemed longer now, as though it had stretched itself to accommodate the weight of everything that had happened since I left. I turned into the first room on the left.

There she was.

Abilene was by the window. She was older than I remembered, of course. What had once been a frail young woman was now a frail old woman.

She looked up when she heard me. Her wrinkled face broke into a toothy smile.

‘Hello, Blythe!’ she said, her voice reedy and deep-south. ‘Hello, Blythe! You’ve come back to us!’

She held out tremulous arms. I sunk to my knees and let her wrap them around me, stick-thin and sweet-smelling. This wasn’t the silent, distant girl of my memories. This was my older sister, not quite all there, never much one for words, but doing her best to show she loved me. Drawing me child-like stick figures portraying us holding hands, or smiling guilelessly as I read to her aloud a story she couldn’t follow, or clapping her hands together as I paraded through the room in one of Momma’s dresses.

And suddenly, I hated myself.

I had reduced her to a shadow, a gormless, wordless memory in my mind—a mechanism to distance myself when I found myself halfway across the state, with no way of returning, and soon no desire to. It was easier to say goodbye if I’d altered the past so there was nothing to miss.

I exchanged light-hearted words with a heavy heart and told her I was happy to be back. After Abilene settled back into her routine—eyes glazed over with contentment, humming some half-forgotten tune—I excused myself to go set up my bedroom.

The floorboards whined beneath my feet as I made my way to my old room, the one at the far end of the hall, tucked beneath the sloping eaves where the roof came down at a sharp angle. The door stuck, swollen from humidity, and I had to put my shoulder into it to get it open. It was smaller than I remembered. Much smaller.

I dumped my duffel on the bed and started unpacking what little I'd brought when something caught my eye. On the wall beside the closet door: pencil marks, dozens of them, climbing up the yellowed wallpaper. Each mark had a date beside it, and my name. My height measurements, going back to when I was barely tall enough to reach the doorknob.

September 14, 1992 – Blythe – 3'4’

December 25, 1992 – Blythe – 3'5’ (Christmas growth spurt!)

August 30, 1993 – Blythe – 3'6½’

My fingers traced the marks, climbing higher. Momma's handwriting, loopy and childlike, the kind that never quite matures past a certain point. The kind that spoke to her own stunted development.

She hadn't been a bad mom. I had memories of her coming home late, sometimes with a split lip or purple eye, but always with a little treat tucked in her purse. ‘Look what I found for my special girl,’ she'd say, like she'd discovered these treasures on the side of the road rather than purchased them with what little money she had.

She never brought her work home. No matter how desperate things got—and they got desperate plenty—she never turned our house into an extension of whatever motel room or car backseat she was using that night. Home was for us. Her girls. Her treasures.

Later, I found Abilene's medical records in a neat folder on Momma's bedside table. The records confirmed what I'd always known but never wanted to face.

Momma—Bonnie-Ann Carrigan—was herself the product of a relationship between a father and daughter. And Abilene's father, listed only as ‘Joseph C.’ on her birth certificate, was almost certainly Joseph Carrigan—Momma's biological brother, who'd died of liver failure shortly after Abilene was born. This wasn’t news, of course, just a hell of an ugly thing to see in the light of day.

My own lineage was less tangled. Thank the Lord for rich old perverts. I was born much later, when Momma was already in her forties. My birth had caused a scandal because it was widely rumoured that I was the product of her long-standing arrangement with Theodore Hollis, the town's most prominent attorney.

Theodore had denied it, of course. But I'd seen the way he looked at me the few times I'd encountered him in town as a child—a mixture of guilt and naked fear that told me everything I needed to know.

I closed the folder and put it back where I'd found it. Through the thin walls, I could hear Abilene humming to herself, the same tuneless melody she'd been humming since I arrived. It should have been comforting, that childlike contentment. Instead, it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. The sound triggered something in me, a memory so deeply buried I wasn't sure if it was real or just some nightmare my child's mind had conjured to make sense of things.

I was four, maybe five. Momma dragging me down the basement stairs, her grip on my wrist tight enough to leave finger-shaped bruises. Her voice high and desperate: ‘You have to see it, Blythe. You have to. You're a Carrigan. It's in your blood.’

The basement door—a strange symbol carved into the wood, worn smooth from years of tracing fingers.

‘Can you sense it?’ she'd ask, her eyes fever-bright. ‘Can you feel it watching you?’

I couldn't. I never could. And that would send her into a frenzy of disappointment.

‘You're not trying hard enough,’ she'd say, pushing me through the doorway. ‘Maybe you need more time with it. Maybe you need to be alone.’

Then darkness. The door locked behind me. Hours in the pitch black, my imagination populating the shadows with horrors. I'd scream until my throat was raw, pound on the door until my fists ached.

Eventually, she'd open it, her face expectant. ‘What did you see? Tell me what you saw.’

I'd lie, making up monsters, hoping one of my inventions would tick some specific box she’d engineered in her broken mind. But she always knew when I was making it up. And her face would crumple, not with anger but with a desperate kind of fear.

‘But what’re we gonna do when Abi dies?’ she'd whisper, more to herself than to me. ‘What’re we to do, when there ain’t none of us left?’

I found myself moving through the house, drawn toward the kitchen and the door I knew led to the basement.

The door was exactly as I remembered it—heavy, imposing, with that strange symbol carved into its surface. The knob turned easily in my hand. No lock, no resistance. Just a dark stairwell leading down into shadow.

I flicked the wall switch, but nothing happened. I took my phone out, turned on the flashlight, and began my descent.

The stairs creaked beneath my weight. At the bottom, I fumbled until my fingers found a cord dangling from the ceiling. I pulled it, and a single bare bulb flickered to life, casting yellow light over the basement.

Behold, the pit of unimaginable horrors! Or rather, just a basement. Concrete floor, cinder block walls, derelict washing machine, mouldy corners.

I laughed, the sound echoing strangely in the confined space. What had I expected? Some Lovecraftian horror lurking in the shadows?

From upstairs came a noise that froze my blood. Abilene screaming.

'Blythe! BLYTHE!' Her voice came garbled and thick like she was talking through pudding. 'Bad! BAD! Get out! GET OUTTA THERE!'

I rushed back to the stairwell, taking the steps two at a time. At the top, Abilene blocked the doorway, her wheelchair wedged tight, her head jerking in that repeated sideways twitch she got when she was agitated.

'It! It!' She jabbed a crooked finger down the stairs. 'Behind you! BAD! You see? YOU SEE?'

I glanced back down the stairs. Empty. Nothing but shadows and that single, swinging bulb. 'Abilene, there's nothing there. Just an empty—'

'DO NOT GO DOWN!' She flapped her hands frantically, a high keening sound escaping her throat. 'Bad thing! Bad thing will get you!' Her head snapped to the side three times in rapid succession, that tic of hers worsening with her panic.

I pushed past her, back into the kitchen, then turned to help manoeuvre her wheelchair away from the door. Her whole body was trembling, one leg bouncing uncontrollably against the footrest.

'Abilene, listen to me. There's nothing in the basement. I was just down there.'

She shook her head violently, tears streaming down her face. ‘Gotta keep it locked up. Or the monster—’

‘Okay! Okay,’ I held up my hands in surrender, holding her agitated gaze, nodding long and slow until she began to copy me. ‘I understand. I’m sorry. I won’t go down there again, ‘kay?’

It took nearly an hour to calm her down enough to take her medication and help her into bed. By the time I finally collapsed into my own, exhaustion had seeped into my bones. I stared at the ceiling, watching shadows dance across the popcorn texture. Just the branches outside my window, stirred by the night breeze. Nothing more.

Momma had clearly passed her delusions on to Abilene. That was all this was. Two damaged women, products of generations of inbreeding and isolation, spinning ghost stories to make sense of their broken minds. And now here I was, letting their madness seep into me, feeling my skin crawl every time the house settled or the wind picked up.

I turned on my side, pulling the musty quilt tighter around me. Sleep. I just needed sleep. In the morning, I'd call a real estate agent. Get the ball rolling. Two weeks, max, and I'd be back in Jefferson City with Abilene safely settled somewhere with professional care.

Just as I was drifting off, something scratched at my window. Just a branch, I told myself. Just a—

It came again. Three distinct taps.

My eyes flew open. The window was empty, nothing but darkness beyond the glass. But as I watched, breath caught in my throat, a dark liquid began to seep through the seam where the window met its frame. It oozed slowly, viscous and black in the moonlight, defying gravity as it crawled horizontally across the glass.

I blinked hard, and it was gone. Just a trick of the light. Just my exhausted mind playing tricks on me.

From somewhere deep in the house came a sound like laughter—not human laughter, but something wet and gurgling, like someone drowning in their own amusement.

Just the pipes, I told myself. Just the old plumbing groaning.

I pressed my pillow over my ears, but the laughter seemed to slip through, to find its way inside my head where it took root and began to grow.

And underneath it all, so faint I could almost convince myself I wasn't hearing it, came the rhythmic thumping from the basement. Like a heart beating beneath the floorboards. Like something trying to get out.

Morning capped off a sleepless night, dragging itself over the horizon in smears of pink and orange. Daylight brought clarity. Fuck this house, fuck this place. I needed to get Abilene out of here.

I made us both breakfast. Abilene ate mechanically, her eyes darting constantly toward the basement door. I pretended not to notice.

‘I'm heading into town today,’ I told her, rinsing our plates in the sink. ‘You gonna be okay?’

‘O-kay,’ she parroted, a piece of curdled egg white dropping from her fork and hitting the table. ‘You will come back?’

‘Of course,’ I say so fast and hard it comes across as almost aggressive. ‘Of course I will. I’m not going anywhere ever again.’

‘O-kay,’ she repeats, happily this time.

The real estate office was sandwiched between a boarded-up hardware store and a pawn shop. The bell over the door jangled as I stepped inside. A young woman looked up from behind a cluttered desk, her face brightening with a smile that seemed genuine, if a bit overeager.

‘Hi! Welcome to Saltpenny Realty. Can I help?’

She was maybe thirty, with honey-blonde hair pulled back in a ponytail and clothing that looked surprisingly metropolitan.

‘I'm looking to list a property,’ I said, settling into the chair across from her desk. ‘The Carrigan place.’

Her eyes widened just a fraction. ‘You're Blythe Carrigan.’

It wasn't a question, but I nodded anyway.

‘I thought you might be.’ She stuck out her hand. ‘Lorelai Tanner. Well, it was Lorelai Carrigan before I got married, but that didn't stick, and neither did the husband.’ She gave a braying laugh. ‘We're third cousins or somethin’, you know that? My daddy was your granddaddy's nephew, or cousin—I think.’

‘I didn't know I had family in town,’ I said, surprised. ‘Besides Abilene, I mean.’

‘Oh, honey, you've got Carrigans stretched all over this county. Most of 'em changed their names or moved away, but we're around.’

‘Right. Well, about the house—’

‘Oh!’ Her eyes lit up. ‘The Carrigan house! I've been dying to get a look inside that place. It's got quite the history.’

This surprised me. ‘It does?’

Lorelai laughed again. ‘Honey, that house is practically Saltpenny's own little 'House of Usher.' I'm something of an amateur historian—I've been researching it for years.’

My curiosity was piqued despite myself. ‘What kind of history?’

She glanced at her watch. ‘Tell you what. My lunch break's in half an hour. Why don't you meet me at the library archives? I can show you what I've found.’

The Saltpenny Public Library was a squat brick building that had once been the town's post office. Inside, it smelled of mildew and furniture polish, the competing scents creating a uniquely institutional funk. Lorelai was waiting for me in the back room, where plastic filing cabinets held what passed for the town's ‘archives’—mostly old newspapers, church records, and the occasional handwritten journal donated by one of Saltpenny's founding families.

‘Here we go,’ she said, spreading a collection of yellowed papers across a scarred wooden table. ‘The real story of the Carrigan house—which, by the way, wasn't always the Carrigan house.’

‘Yeah?’

‘It was built by the Holloway sisters back in 1789.’ She pointed to a faded sketch of three women standing in front of a house that, despite the crude rendering, was recognizably my childhood home. ‘Agatha, Beatrice, and Constance Holloway. Unmarried sisters who came down from Massachusetts.’

I leaned closer, studying the sketch. The women looked ordinary enough—severe expressions typical of portraits from that era, high-necked dresses, hair pulled back tight.

‘They were healers,’ Lorelai continued. 'Pretty common back then. But they were also outsiders—educated, independent women living alone, which didn't sit right with the God-fearing folk of Saltpenny.’

‘Let me guess,’ I said, already seeing where this was heading. ‘Someone got sick, the herbs didn't work, and suddenly they're witches.’

‘Close.’ Lorelai slid a brittle newspaper clipping toward me. ‘The youngest Holloway sister, Constance, was courted by a local preacher, Jonathan Carrigan. That’s right, your great-great-somethin’ granddaddy. By all accounts, she spurned his advances rather publicly. Shortly after, Carrigan's wife fell ill with a wasting disease. He blamed Constance, claimed she'd hexed his wife out of jealousy.’

I skimmed the article, which described in lurid detail the ‘witch hunt’ that followed. Jonathan Carrigan, leading a mob of townsmen, stormed the Holloway house on a November night in 1790, where they found 'damning evidence'.

‘A grimoire,’ I muttered.

‘So the story goes,’ Lorelai nodded. ‘It was enough to convince the town that the Holloway sisters had summoned some kind of cloven-hoofed no-good. They were dragged from their home and drowned in Hangman's Creek, right behind the house.’

My stomach turned at the image of three women being held under the murky waters of the creek I'd played beside as a child. ‘And then what? Carrigan just took their house?’

‘That's where it gets interesting,’ Lorelai continued. ‘Jonathan Carrigan was a respected man in the community—father of five, deacon at the church, all that. But after the drownings, somethin’ changed in him. He abandoned his family, moved into the Holloway house, and started livin’ with his much younger sister, Eleanor.’

‘Jesus,’ I breathed.

‘Incest was the least of the rumours.’ She passed me a fragile, leather-bound book. ‘This is a journal kept by Jonathan's eldest son, Thomas. It was donated to the library in the 1950s by a Carrigan descendant who was trying to distance himself from the family reputation.’

I opened it carefully, the brittle pages threatening to crumble beneath my fingers. The handwriting was spidery and faint, but still legible:

Father hath wholly taken leave of his senses. He no longer attendeth the church, though he was once its most devoted servant. Instead, he passeth his days and nights in the cellar of that accursed Holloway house, muttering incantations which we children were once forbidden, even in jest, to whisper. When I did confront him about his forsaking of Mother and his sinful dealings with Aunt Eleanor, he did claim it necessary to ‘keep the blood strong’ for that which must come after. He speaketh of a pact made, a duty that shall be passed unto his children, and his children's children, unto eternity.

Lorelai was watching me, gauging my reaction. ‘There's more. Skip ahead a few pages.’

I turned the delicate pages until I found an underlined passage:

Father did appear at church this day for the first time in many months, his clothing in disarray and reeking of decay. In the midst of Reverend Porter's sermon, Father did begin to wail and rend his garments, crying out that he had ‘unleashed a great evil’ when he did drown the Holloway women. He did claim that, in the use of their unholy grimoire, he had bound himself and his bloodline ‘forevermore’ to keep some nameless horror confined. The congregation was sorely disturbed, and several ladies did faint at his ravings. He was removed bodily from the church, all the while screaming, ‘So long as a Carrigan of strong Carrigan blood standeth as Keeper, the evil shall not escape its prison!’

I set the journal down, a chill working its way up my spine.

‘After that, the Carrigans became increasingly... isolated,’ Lorelai said, her voice softer now. ‘Generation after generation, they kept to themselves, intermarrying with cousins or closer to 'keep the bloodline pure.’’

I thought of my mother's desperation to have children, her parade of men, and her devastation at each miscarriage. I remembered her inexplicable grief when her brother Joseph died—not the grief of someone mourning a loved one—by all accounts, he was an abusive man—but the panic of someone who's lost their only ally against something terrible.

‘She was trying to keep the bloodline going,’ I murmured, more to myself than to Lorelai. ‘All those pregnancies. All those men.’

‘Your mama had quite the reputation,’ Lorelai said carefully. ‘But I always wondered if there wasn't more to it.’

‘And then there was me,’ I said. ‘Her miracle baby. Except I wasn't a pure Carrigan.’

I thought of my childhood ‘tests’ in the basement. Momma trying desperately to see if I could sense whatever it was she believed lived down there. Her growing despair when I couldn't.

‘She gave up on me,’ I said softly. ‘That's why she let CPS take me without a fight. I wasn't useful to her.’

It was an uncharitable summary of my surrender, and I knew it. It hadn’t felt like I was simply a tool she’d decided to donate. I still remember her drawn face, lit up with blue light as she clasped her hands together so tight they bled white as if trying to resist reaching for me, even as I reached desperately for her. Somehow, I knew—she’d done it for my own good.

‘And Abilene?’ I heard Lorelai ask as though from a distance.

‘Joseph—my uncle’s—daughter. Her last hope for a 'pure' Carrigan.’ The pieces were falling into place, a twisted logic emerging from what I'd always dismissed as madness. ‘But Abilene's disabled. Momma must have been terrified that she'd die without anyone to... what, keep up the family tradition of basement-dwelling crazy?’

Lorelai began gathering the papers and journals, sliding them carefully back into their folders. ‘Well, it’s like I said, just an interesting bit of local history.’

‘Thanks for showing me this,’ I said, standing up. ‘It explains a lot about my childhood.’

‘Happy to help.’ She pulled a business card from her pocket. ‘Give me a call when you're ready to list the house.’

I drove back through town in a daze, my mind churning with images of drowned women and raving preachers and generations of Carrigan’s huddled in that creaking house, guarding something they couldn't name but couldn't escape.

I didn't go straight into the house when I got back. Instead, I stumbled my way down the riverbed to the cool surface of Hangman's Creek, some morbid curiosity driving me forward. The afternoon sun was sinking fast, painting the water a sickly amber that caught on the ripples and flashed like warning signals.

The creek wasn't much to look at—just a sluggish body of brown water, choked with duckweed. I stared into the murky water, trying to imagine three women being forced beneath its surface, their skirts billowing around them like blooming flowers, their hands clawing at their captors, their screams cut short by the rush of filthy water into their lungs.

I was so preoccupied by these grisly images flashing through my mind that I didn’t notice at first.

The surface of the creek began to ripple, though there was no wind. The ripples grew, concentric circles spreading outward from three distinct points, as if someone were dropping stones into the water. Except the disturbances were coming from below, pushing upward.

I should have run. Any sane person would have. But I stood frozen, watching as three dark shapes began to rise from the water. Heads first—hair plastered to skulls like rotting seaweed—then shoulders, arms, torsos. Three women in sodden dresses that might once have been white but were now the mottled gray-green of cemetery lichens. Their skin had the bleached, bloated look of things too long underwater, their eyes clouded over like those of dead fish.

They moved toward the bank with a terrible synchronicity, water streaming from their clothes, their hair, their open mouths. And they were speaking—no, chanting—in voices that sounded like water gurgling down a drain:

*‘By water taken, by water bound,*  
*What's lost beneath shall soon be found.*  
*When last blood falls, the chain shall break,*  
*And what lies sleeping shall awake.’*

I screamed then, scrambling backwards up the bank, my feet slipping on the muddy incline. I fell, hard, the breath knocked from my lungs. When I looked up again, the creek was empty. Just water and shadows and the first fireflies of evening dancing across the river’s gleaming surface.

My heart hammered against my ribs as I staggered to my feet and ran for the house, not looking back. Inside, my hands shook so badly I could barely dial Lorelai's number. When she answered, I didn't bother with pleasantries.

‘I want to list the house. Today. Now.’

After assurances that I was okay—no, really, I’m fine— she agreed on a dirt-cheap price and I hung up, expecting a contract in my mailbox the following morning.

I leaned against the wall, willing my breathing to slow. I was letting this place get to me. The stories, the isolation, the weight of family history—it was all playing tricks on my perception.

I went through the motions of making dinner for Abilene and myself, though my appetite had vanished. She watched me from her wheelchair as I set the table, her eyes tracking my every movement.

‘Are you okay?’ she ventured quietly. ‘Is Blythe o-kay?’

I set the plates down harder than I intended. ‘Just tired.’

‘Did you visit the water?’

My hand froze halfway to the silverware drawer. ‘How did you know that?’

Abilene's head tilted to one side, an eerily birdlike gesture. ‘Muddy shoes.’

‘I just went for a walk, that's all.’

‘Did you see the dead girls?’

A chill ran through me. ‘What are you talking about?’

‘The dead girls,’ she repeated. ‘I like them. Sometimes they play with me.’

I sank into a chair and pushed my plate away, my stomach churning. ‘Listen, Abilene. I called the real estate agent today. I'm listing the house for sale.’

For a moment, she stared at me blankly, as if the words didn't compute. Then her face crumpled, features collapsing in on themselves like a building being demolished.

‘NO!’ The scream that tore from her was primal, animal. ‘YOU CAN'T! YOU CAN'T SELL IT! YOU'LL KILL US ALL!’

She lunged from her wheelchair with a strength I wouldn't have thought possible, her frail body propelled by sheer desperation. Her hands found my face, clawing, not to hurt but to silence, her palm pressing hard against my mouth.

‘Abi! Stop! Get off of me!’

‘Shhh! It'll hear you! It'll KNOW!’ she wailed, wild-eyed. ‘It’ll know you wanna go!’

I shoved her away, harder than I meant to. She fell awkwardly, her weak legs buckling beneath her. There was a crack as her head connected with the edge of the table, and she slumped to the floor. A low, keening wail rose from her throat, and I realized with horror that she'd wet herself.

‘Abilene, I'm sorry!’ I whispered, horrified, kneeling beside her. ‘I didn't mean to—let me help.’

Getting her upstairs was a struggle, her body alternately rigid with fear and limp with defeat. I ran her a bath, murmuring soft apologies she didn't seem to hear. Her eyes had gone vacant. But occasionally her lips would move, forming words I couldn't quite catch.

I tucked her into bed, half-expecting her to fight me, but she went docilely enough, curling into a foetal position beneath the quilt.

‘It knows,’ she whispered as I turned to leave. ‘It's so happy now. It's been waiting such a long time.’

I shut her door and retreated to my own room, double-checking that the window was locked, drawing the curtains tight. I changed into pyjamas, crawled into bed, and stared at the ceiling, telling myself over and over that everything would be fine. In the morning, I'd sign the listing agreement. In a few weeks, the house would be sold. Abilene would adjust to her new home. We'd both move on, leaving Saltpenny and its ghosts behind for good.

I must have drifted off eventually, because I woke to darkness and the sound of something scraping against the floor downstairs. A long, dragging noise, like furniture being moved. Or something heavy being pulled across hardwood.

I lay perfectly still, listening. The scraping stopped, replaced by a wet, slithering sound. Then silence.

It's nothing, I told myself. Old houses make noises. They settle. They creak.

Something thumped directly beneath my bed—once, twice, three times. Like knuckles rapping on the underside of the floorboards.

I switched on the bedside lamp, but it didn't work. The power must have gone out. I fumbled for my phone, hit the flashlight function with trembling fingers. The beam cut through the darkness, but somehow the shadows it created seemed deeper, more substantial than the ones it dispelled.

Another thump, this time from inside the closet. The door, which I was certain I'd closed before bed, now stood ajar, a slice of deeper darkness visible through the gap.

‘This isn't real,’ I whispered. ‘This is not happening.’

As if in answer, every door in the house slammed shut at once—a percussive blast that shook the walls and sent dust raining from the ceiling. From Abilene's room came a thin, terrified wail.

I was on my feet before I could think, stumbling toward her room, my phone's light carving a frantic path before me. The air felt thick, resistant, as if I were trying to run underwater. And it was cold—a bone-deep, unnatural cold that had nothing to do with the Louisiana night and everything to do with the wrongness spreading through the house like ink through water.

I reached Abilene's door and found it locked. Not stuck—locked. From the inside.

‘Abilene!’ I pounded on the wood. ‘Abilene, open up!’

Her wailing increased an octave, but otherwise she did not answer.

From below came a sound like splintering wood—the basement door being torn from its hinges. Then heavy, wet footsteps on the stairs.

Something brushed against my ankle—soft, like the tentative touch of fingertips. I jerked away, swinging my phone's light down to the floor. Nothing there. But the touch came again, this time on the back of my neck.

I ran. Down the hall, down the stairs, blind panic driving me forward.

But at the bottom of the stairs, my light caught on the front door—or where the front door should have been. Instead, there was only a solid wall, as if the door had never existed at all. I spun around, looking for another exit, but every window, every door had been swallowed by unblemished walls. The house had sealed itself, trapping me inside.

And there, across the living room, stood the basement door—wide open and in pieces. Beyond lay only darkness, a darkness so complete it seemed to have substance, to be reaching out toward me with eager fingers of shadow.

Something moved in that darkness. I couldn't see it, not exactly, but I could sense it—a shifting of the air, a redistribution of weight, a presence uncoiling itself after too long confined.

And it was happy. I felt its glee like a physical force, a sickly wave of emotion that wasn't mine washing over me. It was delighted. Ecstatic. After centuries of being bound, being watched, being kept at bay by generation after generation of Carrigans, it was about to be free. The house was going to be sold. The bloodline was ending. The covenant was breaking. It was celebrating.

‘This isn't real,’ I said again, but my voice was a tiny, fragile thing in the vastness of what was happening. ‘You're not real.’

The darkness laughed—a sound like meat being torn from bone, like insects burrowing under skin. It wasn't made of sound at all, but of sensation, of violation, of the absolute certainty that something was wrong, fundamentally and irrevocably wrong with the universe.

And then it was moving toward me, flowing out of the basement like oil. I couldn't see its shape, but I felt it surround me, brush against me, almost curious. Exploratory. Learning the contours of my fear.

It spoke, not in words but in images, in sensations—flashes of what it planned to do once it was free. Cities burning. The sky split open like a wound. And always, always, pleasure. Its pleasure at our pain, its delight in our terror, its ecstasy at finally, FINALLY being unleashed.

I was screaming, I realized distantly. Screaming and screaming as it pulled me toward the basement, toward the darkness where it had been imprisoned for so long. My ribs hit each stair as I was dragged down them, fingernails scratching desperately at their frayed surfaces, failing to find purchase.

And then—light.

A harsh, blinding light from the top of the stairs, and Abilene's voice, stronger than I'd ever heard it: ‘LEAVE HER ALONE!’

The thing recoiled. Abilene stood at the top of the basement stairs, her frail body silhouetted against the glow emanating from her outstretched hand. Blood dripped from her palm, where she'd cut a deep, straight line across her lifeline. The blood wasn't falling but rising, defying gravity to form a shimmering crimson barrier between us and the thing in the darkness.

‘GET BACK!’ she screamed, spittle flying. ‘GET BACK! CARRIGAN DEMANDS IT!’

The darkness screamed. It thrashed against the barrier of Abilene's blood, but couldn't break through. It released its hold on me.

I scrambled up the stairs, feeling its rage beating against my back like physical blows. Abilene grabbed my arm with her unbloodied hand, her grip surprisingly strong, and together we slammed the basement door shut behind us. She pressed her bleeding palm against the splintered wood, drawing a symbol I recognized from the basement door of my childhood—the same one I'd seen in the historical society's archives, carved into the original foundation of the house.

The wood beneath her hand rippled, reformed, and became whole again. The symbol blazed briefly, then faded to a dull, rust-coloured stain that could have been decades old.

From behind the door came a howl of furious frustration—the sound of something that had been inches from freedom being denied once again. The whole house shook with its rage, plaster cracking, lightbulbs shattering, furniture toppling. Then, gradually, the noise subsided, replaced by a low, constant scratching. Waiting. Biding its time.

Abilene slumped against the wall, suddenly looking every one of her years and more.

We stared at each other in the aftermath—me, wild-eyed and shaking; her, pale but composed, with the dignified exhaustion of someone who had done this many times before.

‘I felt it,’ I said finally, my voice raw from screaming. ‘For the first time, I actually felt it.’

‘Momma said it's getting stronger,’ she said simply. ‘’Cause I’m getting weaker.’

I nodded, unable to deny it. Whatever scepticism I'd clung to had been stripped away, leaving only the bare, terrible truth. There was something in the basement. Something old. Something evil. Something kept at bay only by the vigilance of generations of indentured Carrigans—even the broken ones, even the mad ones, even the ones like my mother who'd sacrificed everything to keep the bloodline going.

And now there were only two of us left. Me, with my diluted blood that barely registered to the thing below. And Abilene, frail and aging, the last pure Carrigan.

That was three years ago. I'm writing this now from the same bedroom I slept in as a child, in the house I swore I'd sell but never did. Abilene is sleeping down the hall, her breathing more laboured these days, her episodes of lucidity growing fewer and further between.

The doctors give her six months, maybe less. Her body is finally shutting down after years of fighting against its own genetic destiny. When she's gone, I'll be the only one left—the only one who knows what lives beneath the house, the only one who can hear it scratching at the basement door each night, testing for weaknesses, sensing that its centuries-long imprisonment is nearly over.

Because I can't hold it. Not really. Oh, I've tried—drawing the symbol in my blood, reciting the words Abilene taught me. But it knows I'm not a true Carrigan. It knows my blood is weak, mixed, impure. It tolerates my attempts to contain it because it finds them amusing, because it knows they're temporary.

I've thought about burning the house down, but Abilene says that would only free it sooner. The binding isn't to the house but to the bloodline. The house is just where the original pact was made, where the grimoire was used, where Jonathan Carrigan paid the price for his lust and pledged his descendants in perpetuity.

I've thought about having a child—finding a distant Carrigan cousin, trying to strengthen the bloodline, continuing the cycle for another generation. But I can't bring myself to do it. Can't condemn another soul to this inheritance of madness and obligation and fear.

So I wait. And I watch over Abilene. And I listen to the thing in the basement growing more excited, more eager, more certain of its coming freedom with each passing day.

And I wonder what will happen when the last drop of Carrigan blood is gone, when there's no one left to stand between it and the world outside.

I think of the Holloway sisters sometimes, those ghostly women rising from the creek. Was it warning or welcome they offered me?

*When last blood falls, the chain shall break,*  
*And what lies sleeping shall awake.*

I guess we'll all find out soon enough.
