I’ve been pretty much all around Australia. Take my word for it, the best way to see this country is by car. There’s just so many little hidden secrets and pockets of paradise you miss if you try to do it all by bus or train, or simply jetting between the major cities.

My memories of roadtripping Australia are for the most part positive. Sure there’s been some ups and downs along the way. But that’s life isn’t it? You just keep pushing forward. And that’s what I did.

There’s one notable stopover that still stands out though. An event which very nearly convinced me to pack in my adventurous spirit for good. I’ll recount this as best I can.

It was sometime around late September, a few years ago now, and I was headed from Barrage Bay up to Narooma. It’s a gorgeous coastal drive for the most part, aside from a little detour inland as you pass Wallaga Lake.

The best part of roadtripping is the impulsivity, especially when you’re driving a fully equipped camper van like me. You can pull in just about anywhere for a break, as long as the area you’re pulling up at isn’t illegal for camping and what not… and so I did, as I came around the bending roads of that beautiful lakeside drive.

I found a picture perfect spot to camp out for the night. Remote, peaceful… just the way I liked it. I set up my camp, got a hot pot of coffee going, and kicked back in the deck chair soaking up the sun.

I got there right on sunset, so it was absolutely ideal. September can be a little warmer, but in the early mornings and creeping into the evenings that time of year, you won’t find better weather down under.

I was gazing out over those crystal clear blue waters, when I heard someone speak…

*“ungwarr ananyi”...*

Needless to say, this startled me. There was no one around, well there certainly hadn't been a moment ago anyway.

*“ungwarr ananyi”…* 

Again! That same voice. That’s when I realised, there **was** no one around. I was hearing the voice in my head. Bloody hell, I must be out of it, I thought. It had been a long drive. 

***ungwarr ananyi!!***

Louder this time. And sending shockwaves through my head. Every time it spoke out, it was like the kick of a bass drum reverberating from the inside out of my brain. It hurt...

And this is when shit got real bizarre. Three kids came tearing out from the bush, breaking the tree line right behind my camper. They were shouting at me and pointing to the road, screaming “Go! Go! Leave now!”.

These kids were clearly Indigenous. Don’t get the wrong idea I don’t mean some stereotypical image of Indigenous Australian tribes living deep in the bush. They were just some local kids from a nearby camp. They sure seemed to know something I didn’t though. And it didn’t sound good.

I decided I’d best heed their advice. This, coupled with that weird voice was giving me a bad feeling. I packed up my stuff and scrambled back inside my camper. I strapped into the drivers seat, turned the engine over and flicked on the high beams. As I did so, the yellow beams of light shot straight into the dark bushland ahead, and illuminated something massive. 

It was huge. I shit you not, 12 feet at the bare minimum. It had an almost spider like appearance, its arms and legs stuck straight out to the sides. Its face was pale white. I'm sure you're familiar with the Slenderman, right? The face on this thing was like him, but with a nasty scowl, his eyes beady and shimmering red. And its body... it was just like this shadowy, globby mass. In my head, the same voice from before, but it said nothing, just a low growl...

*“grrrrrrrrrr……..”*

The kids start bashing and kicking my camper now, but not like they meant me harm or anything, like they were urging me to leave. They screamed something out at me, a word I’ll never forget. “Dulagal! Dulagal!”, they shouted, over and over.

Again, that voice from before, but MUCH louder this time, echoed through my head.

*“ungwarr ananyi!!”*

I watched, as this thing slowly, yet deliberately, pivoted on its right foot, and then began walking sideways towards my car. No, really, it just kind of toppled from one stumpy leg to the other, blundering sideways toward my van. All the while, that pale white face was fixed on me... its angry expression contorting further and further as it got closer. That was it. I was out. I stepped on the pedal and floored it off down the highway.

As I sped off down the road, I caught glimpses of this abomination in my rearview mirror, wobbling sideways, step by step down the highway, following my car. Thankfully, it did not appear capable of picking up the kind of speed necessary to close the gap, and I watched as it slowly disappeared into the darkness of the night.

That was my first and last time to have ever witnessed anything in my travels I would call otherworldly. I did not need to look very far for answers as to what I bore witness to that dark September night. A simple search for a single word those kids shouted at me would turn up everything I needed to know…

*“Dulagal”.*

Straight out of Wikipedia... 

*“The Dulagal is a large spider like creature of Aboriginal dreamings. It is said to have bright red eyes and it stalks Mount Gulaga. It is said that on dark nights, one might catch a glimpse of him, walking sideways across the planes”.*

Where I was camped was a straight shot south from Mount Gulaga. So, it fits. Why this thing was down by the lakeside when he’s said to stalk the mountain, I don’t know. Maybe he sees all this land surrounding the mountain as his territory. Maybe he was on the hunt. I don’t know.

This search did lead me to look into another phrase I heard that night. Those words which reverberated inside my mind over and over. This is of the Gooniyandi language, and it loosely translates into “please… go”.

What I can’t figure out is whether this voice in my head was the Dulagal, or something else. A protector spirit perhaps. This… Dulagal thing… it did not appear to have my best interests in mind. No, more than that, everything about its demeanour that night, looked as though it meant me harm.

The actions of the kids, too. They were frantically urging me to get out. Like they knew if I stayed there, something bad was gonna happen. If it weren’t for them, maybe it would have. But nah, I don’t reckon it was that Dulagal talking to me that night. He woulda been quite happy to sneak right up on me. 

Still to this day I can’t shake the image of that awkward, sideways walk, as he lumbered out from those trees.
