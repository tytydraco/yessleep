We’ve all done stupid things in our youth - at least, that’s what I told myself while psyching myself up for the night before Julie had to leave for college. I wouldn’t be the first, and certainly not the last. Not that that excused doing anything stupid, but it’s what I told myself. I opened my curtains just enough to peer out to my street corner, a solitary lamp flickering as if keeping time. 

Darkness had already settled over Westbridge, and my alarm clock buzzed quietly on my counter to tell me it was 9:15 on the dot. I turned my attention back to the window, seeing a car or two pass by. My house was the one at the exact loop of the cul-de-sac in the back of the neighborhood, not hard to find but often overlooked. No sign of Julie or her electric blue car just yet. I shut the curtains. I had several makeup products stashed in my desk drawer, but was unsure which one to use for the occasion. Was sneaking into school to do a senior prank 3 months late a lipstick occasion, or a lipgloss one? The truth was I didn’t actually need any, and I knew that. But there would be lights everywhere for Julie to see me in. Dashboard, car, fluorescent. It all had to look right. I had to look right. 

“Eleanor, are you all packed for Friday?” My mom called from downstairs. It was past curfew, and I hadn’t left the house. I probably should have been asleep, but she knew I wasn’t. 

“Not yet,” I called down, “I have a week!” That was the thing. Why was everyone trying to rush this summer? This was possibly the only summer I’d ever have in my life where I was truly carefree, but that didn’t seem to matter to anyone else. My friends couldn’t talk about anything but college, while my mind was buzzing with all the glory of having one final summer in my hometown. After this? Internships, grad school, a good paying job in a city bigger than I had ever dreamed possible. But I wasn’t ready for all of that just yet. My phone buzzed on the counter. 

**Jules: Here, down Maple St** 

**Me: sorry, omw.**

 I hastily finished my eyeshadow, put on mascara, and threw on the only black clothing item I owned: a dress I had gotten for my grandmother’s funeral. My window has always had a ladder beneath it, some relic of a forgotten building project from the original owners back in the 40s. It was rickety, and I had barely ever tried it before, but it worked. Julie was different. If this ladder was hers, she’d have used it every friday night. That was something that I admired about her - her unwillingness to be whatever anyone else wanted her to be. She was an A student when the time called for it, dripping with sweetness when she wanted to be, a bitch when she needed to be, the perfect daughter when the time was right, and the most insufferable daughter to have existed when it suited her. I could never quite place my feelings about her. I wasn’t sure what to do with them, like a Christmas gift from a member of your extended family you’ve never met. The humid air seemed to move around me when I landed on the ground with a barely audible smack, and the summer air was so thick I thought I might choke on it. Cicadas put on their nightly concert no one asked for around me, and dirt and rain and grass and the smell of someone barbecuing all mixed in the air. I ran to turn the corner, and eventually got to Maple Street, near the front of the neighborhood where my parents would never see Julie’s car. My heart picked up when I hopped in the car and buckled my seatbelt. 

“Ready?” Julie asked. 

“Absolutely.” I nodded, trying not to wonder if she had noticed my makeup. She went over the plan on the way - there was a rooster on campus no one liked. Evidently, someone had gotten tired of their pet one day and let it wander on to our high school campus. Our real mascot was a bull, but everyone knew we were actually the roosters. That rooster would end up in the principal’s office for him to find in the morning (high schools apparently start earlier than most colleges). She had on rubber gloves, gripping the steering wheel. 

“Are you scared?” 

“What? No, shut up. Put on some gloves, though, we don’t want the feds finding us.” 

“Weren’t you going to leave a note saying who we were?” 

“Not sure. Maybe we’ll just sign it ‘you favorite students’.” If her voice could drip with sweetness, it now dripped with an equal amount of sarcasm. It was true, Principal Morris was a dick. Somewhere in his 85 years on the planet, he had grown incredibly bitter. 

“Won’t that give us away, genius?” 

“Plausible deniability,” Julie shrugged. By the time we had gone over everything, we were in the back parking lot of the school, the science building looming before us. Shutting the car door, I silently wondered how long this school had been around. Shrubbery was all around us, and animals called out to each other through the starless night. While Julie went through the bushes beside the building calling out for the rooster like it was a cat, I pulled out my phone and googled how long the school had been around. 1938, apparently, was the answer, some funding from the New Deal, from what I could gather. The entire school looked like it hadn’t been renovated since then. I turned to face Julie, who nearly had the rooster in her hands. 

“Holy fuck, Julie, stop, you’re gonna get salmonella!” 

“Worth it.” She said, carefully putting it in a cage she brought.

 “I’m going to report you to PETA.” I feigned judginess. 

“Worth it.” She retorted, “Anything for the best senior prank ever. Why didn’t we do one again?” “No idea.” “No creativity is more like it.” She rolled her eyes, “All they needed was a visionary.” Then she laughed - at herself, at the situation, at everything. The principal’s office was actually rather small compared to every other office in the administrative building, and it was on the north side of it, directly facing the gym. And we happened to know he always liked to leave his window open just a crack. Using that as leverage, we made a larger gap big enough for us to fit through. Everything was neatly situated in his office - clean, complete. Not a single post it note or old textbook out of place. Shame that would be done for by the end of the night. It was quiet, though. A nice kind of quiet that settled on you like a well fitted coat. Julie broke it. 

“Should we leave the lights on?” 

“No, let it be a surprise.” 

“True. OK, we’re going to need to get out of here pretty quickly because I think I just pissed this thing off.” She counted down from five, with me holding the cage and her about to release the bird. This whole thing had gone off much easier than I had thought it would. I barely registered it when she got to one, and both of us crammed ourselves out the window into the muggy night again. In truth, we had barely seen the rooster itself. We were out as quickly as we were in. That was when we heard the music coming from the gym down the stone path. With nowhere else to go and no one to contain our curiosity, we decided to go down to the gym. The gym was an old, concrete rectangle that looked less friendly the more you stared at it. It was imposing, giant, and probably the thing people recognized most about our high school. As we got closer, we heard the sounds of camaraderie and chatter. Peeking through the glass doors of the newly renovated gym (there was finally a new floor on the basketball court - the last one had apparently been built in 1956 according to a sign about the construction outside), we were greeted with purple and blue streamers everywhere and a group of old people looking way more buzzed than anyone would have expected them to be. A banner behind them read “Welcome Back, Class of 1955!”. 

“A 70 year reunion is crazy.” Julie said.

 “Especially at 11pm.”

 “Let’s go in.”   
“What? Why?” 

“I mean, we’re here aren’t we? Why not?” 

Something was off about the whole thing, but I couldn’t place it. Yearbook photos were plastered along the wall and someone released a bunch of balloons from the ceiling. People were dancing, laughing. But something wasn’t right, and I felt it in my bones. I continued to scan the scene for any type of red flag, but Julie completely disregarded me. “Alright, I’m going in. See you soon.” She threw open the doors of the gym we had barely been inside in our four years at the school, and I was left by the door trying to decipher my feelings. Like so many school dances before. I ignored her, and I looked back around the gym from the window. Everything theoretically looked normal, but I couldn’t shake an ever-present feeling of terror. I decided to walk around the building, trying to get a better view from the window on the east side of it. Nothing different there. Still the same people, laughing and dancing. Some with walkers, but not many. Some hit by the Chordettes was playing as a couple people shuffled over to get the orange punch from the desert table set up in the middle of the room. My phone got spotty service near the gym, but it nonetheless returned my google search for my high school’s calendar. There was a class of ‘75 reunion on the calendar for Friday night at 5, but before then - nothing. Just regular school hours. That was enough for me - I was dreaming, or we somehow had the wrong school, or somehow we had taken some hallucinogenic drug I didn’t know about. I walked in cautiously, staying near the wall and trying not to make a scene as the music became louder and the lights brighter. I heard bits and pieces of conversation as I passed by: 

“That’s what Martha said. Now, I don’t know how much I believe her after the stunt she pulled sophomore year…” 

“We look pretty good for a bunch of 90 year olds.” 

“Are you still on that? Ruth, that was literally 70 years ago! Let it go.” Ice shooting through my veins, I realized I had lost Julie. My eyes darted across the darkened room as a voice came over the gym’s PA system: “alrighty, lovebirds, this one’s for you. You, and your earth angels.” The Penguins blared loudly through the speakers as I tried to see at least one of two things: Julie, and whoever had made that announcement, because no one was holding a microphone. I remained largely unnoticed as couples gathered up on the dance floor in their best 1950s attire. Finally, in the corner of my eye, I spotted Julie talking to someone near the pretzels on the center table. Moonlight bounced through the windows and into her eyes, shining bright as ever. Weirdly, the person she was talking to seemed to look closer to our age. I tried to catch her attention, but not before I felt an icy chill down on my shoulder. Someone had tapped me. I turned around to find a blonde teenager who looked to be about my own age standing in front of me, wearing an old cheerleading uniform. She had a gash along the length of her stomach, clearly visible through the uniform. 

“Are you okay? Do you need help?” 

“Me? No. I’m long past the time for help. I came to help you. You need to get out of here. I can’t explain it to you now, but you need to get out. Now.” 

“What? I can’t, my friend’s over there-” My tongue caught on the word friend, like my body rejected it. 

“Look at her. Really look at her.” I didn’t know what was happening, but I certainly wasn’t in the position to ignore demands from someone who seemed like they knew much more about what was happening than me. So I did. In the time I had taken my eyes off her, Julie looked like she had aged a few years. And she was wearing different clothes. Older clothes. 

“She looks like…I’m sorry, who the hell are you?” “Eileen. Class of ‘94. But that doesn’t matter right now. Get yourself out while you can.” 

“What is happening?” 

“God, I have to spell it out every time. Every time. Look, just get out and look up the class of 1955. And then me, if you feel like it. But get out now.” I hesitated, looking back at Julie again. I couldn’t leave her. No, actually, that makes it sound like there was no choice that night, but there was. There was a choice, and I wouldn’t leave her. I ran into the middle of the floor and grabbed the almost unrecognizable now middle-aged woman away from the dance floor and out the door. Was it just my imagination or were all their eyes now on me? Shivers ran down my heart and through my veins, down to every crevice in my body. Eileen nodded at me as I pulled her out the door and towards the science building. 

“What are you doing?” Julie protested as I half-walked, half-ran towards her car and shoved her in the passenger seat. 

“I’m not even sure.” I threw the car in reverse and peeled out of the parking lot before any other strange shit could happen. Whatever transformation I had seen in Julie seemed to be slowly reversing itself the further away we drove from the campus. I didn’t stop until I reached the Waffle House on the other side of town, the only place I knew would be open. I parked the car and took the deepest breath I’d ever taken in my life. Julie was still looking at me like I was crazy. I pulled out my phone. I took Eileen’s advice, but I tried her first. I googled Eileen Westbridge High School 94. I clicked on the first article I saw. 

*Westbridge mourns the loss of beloved town icon, Eileen Matherly March 18th, 1994* 

*Eileen Matherly, 17, was found dead on the campus of Westbridge High School yesterday, March 17th. The police have neglected to share much information about the case this soon, but have mentioned she was found in the women's locker room in the gymnasium of the school with a chainsaw wound in her stomach. Authorities suspect the time of death was around 12:15pm. Police are looking into suspects in the case, which could possibly include Matherly’s ex-boyfriend, Kyle.* 

*“Eileen was such a good kid,” Sarah Evans, her calculus teacher said, “really helpful around school, too. That’s why she wanted to become a cheerleader in the first place.” We will update as more information comes, but for now, we at TV20 would like to share our deepest condolences for everyone that knew Eileen.* 

My eyes widened, and I felt my muscles stiffen. My hands shaking, I googled Westbridge High School class of 1955. 

*Inside Westbridge, 1955: the unspoken tragedy that defined a generation (September 19th, 2012)*

 *Ask anyone from Westbridge who grew up anytime around 1955, and they will tell you that the events of January 9th, 1955 were nothing special. Very powerful people have worked very hard to cover up a horrific tragedy that happened right under their noses, but evidence exists that it happened, and the names of the class of 1955 cannot be ignored. There have been so many speculations about what really happened since then - but what actually happened that day, and why did it happen? Let’s look at the facts: At 1:00 on September 19th, 1955, all seniors in the school went to the gym for a mandatory pep rally. By 1:15, all any outsiders knew was that the building itself had collapsed, leaving no survivors and no members of the class of 1955 at Westbridge High School with seven teachers dead. The number often changes, going up every time someone does more research into the incident. Those are the objective facts. Some suspect foul play, some suspected a Russian bomb, or worse: a cold war experiment gone completely awry. Some have gone completely off the deep-end with supernatural theories. All we have to piece what really happened together are police reports and eye witness accounts. At 1:17, a call was made to the Westbridge police from a student out with a hall pass, Janet Olson. The report reads as follows:* 

***Hello? Hello, I’m at Westbridge High School and I…I think our gym just collapsed. The seniors were doing a pep rally in there, I don’t know…*** 

*What police would find later? Chilling. No bodies, no nothing. Not even a hint of a suggestion that the class of ‘55, or the gym, ever existed except for what remained in the memories of the classes after them.*

 I stopped reading. I took Julie inside to get some coffee, but I made mine decaf. I still can’t stop shaking.
