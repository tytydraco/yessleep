I’m not a good guy and I’ll never claim to be. I’ve done things I’m not proud of for a shit ton of money. But that’s not what this is about; at least not directly.

Something happened to me recently and I want to get out of this line of work for good. Unfortunately that’s easier said than done. No one gets out of this line of work without digging their own grave. That’s not a metaphor; I’ve seen it happen. But I think I’ll take my chances and run.

It was a simple enough job, one that had gone down countless times:

Drive to a secluded area of the desert, meet shady guys, swap packages, bring said package back to Jules; the big boss.

Alexi was my partner that evening. He was my kind of guy; didn’t say too much but always had your back. I drove us into the Sonoran and Alexi directed me to the exact location. I parked up and we waited.

The skies over the desert are always striking. It was a stunning swirl of purple and red that you only get to see at twilight. I admired it silently.

“It’s beautiful isn’t it?” said Alexi. He almost made me jump. "Look at the saguaro against those colors. Just beautiful.”

I smiled to myself as I nodded. "Agreed. That's a backdrop to die for."

“Well, hopefully it won’t come to that,” he said, taking out two 9mms from the glove box. He handed one to me and I checked the ammunition before tucking it into the waistband of my pants. We continued to watch over the desert in silence.

“It’s gonna happen someday,”  I said.

“Well, yeah,” he said. “That’s life unfortunately.”

“You know what I mean. Prematurely, like an execution or…”

“Come on man!” he said. “Don’t spoil the moment.”

I laughed. “Here’s to dying of old age in Cancún.”

“Cuba for me, but I’d drink to that.”

Before long another car pulled up some hundred or so yards away, the headlights dipping. I took a deep breath and climbed out of my car, taking the holdall we’d been given from the trunk. Three guys stepped out of the other car.

“Fuck,” I said quietly. “Didn’t Jules say there’d be two guys?”

“Don’t worry about it,” said Alexi, his hand in his waistband.

We stopped about 20 ft away as they lined up in a row. I looked at Alexi and gave him a quick nod before I walked to the halfway point. I put the holdall down and stepped back. The guy in the middle motioned to a guy with a briefcase, who proceeded to make the exchange. Alexi retrieved the briefcase and checked the contents, then nodded to me. The other guys looked satisfied too.

“Gentleman,” said one of the guys, then they returned to their car. I let out a breath as Alexi and I began our walk back.

“Easiest grand we’ll ever make,” said Alexi with a grin.

“It’s almost criminal how easy,” I laughed.

A loud *bang* pierced the air and Alexi was on the ground. I turned to see flashes in the distance as shots were fired.

“Alexi!” I shouted as I pulled out my handgun, ducking down. He rolled over groaning, pulling out his gun too.

“My leg,” he groaned. “Fuckers!”

Despite his injury he got to his feet and started firing.

“Jesus Alexi, take cover!” I yelled, running to a nearby rock. I took a few shots when I could. Alexi managed to hit one guy who I saw fall down. He came to his senses and limped to another rock for cover. I could make out the silhouettes of the two remaining guys. One of them made a beeline for Alexi and one came towards me.

I took a shot and ran for another rock, taking a moment to breathe. I heard a hissing noise from nearby. My first thought was a rattler, but it was followed by a *whoosh* and I felt a blow of cool air over me, like something big had quickly passed by. I turned with my gun outstretched. I could only see the outlines of the tall cacti.

A bullet hit the ground too close for comfort. I leaned over the rock and took a couple more shots, kicking myself at how off I was. I heard the guy skid on the ground as he reached my rock, taking cover on the other side.

“You’ll pay for Seymour!” he snarled.

“You took the first shot, asshole!” I yelled.

“And I’ll take the last!”

Another bullet hit nearby as I flinched. We were both taken off guard as two deep screams filled the air. One of them was definitely from Alexi. Looking over in that general direction I could see several tall, dark shapes moving across the desert.

“What the…” I said as the shapes left a cloud of dust. I heard another loud hiss on my other side and turned to see a saguaro, or at least what looked like a saguaro looming over me.

I screamed and fired directly at it, the flash revealing rows of deadly spines that retracted like wasp stingers. The cactus let out a high pitched squeal and swung an arm out, meeting my left bicep. I screamed in pain as the spines punctured my skin.

It started to *suckle.* The muscles in my arm pulsed as the cactus attached like the tentacles of an octopus. *It was feeding from me!*

I fired my remaining shots and screamed until I was out of breath. The cactus squealed as bullets penetrated its green flesh, but it didn't let me go. It appeared to breathe as it suckled. When I tried to pull away it felt like my arm was going to tear away from my shoulder!

“You fucking freak!” the guy yelled as I heard more shots. The cactus squealed as it let me go. I took the opportunity to run, starting on all fours before getting to my feet. The guy was close behind me firing into the night. The saguaro gave chase, its roots still firmly in the ground as if it was being dragged beneath the earth.

“What the fuck is it?” I shouted, clinging to my bloody arm.

“Are you blind?” he yelled. “It’s a fucking giant-assed cactus!”

I made it to another rock, this one larger than the others. I started to climb it, my arm stinging like a son-of-a-bitch! I grimaced through the pain and made it to the top some 10 ft from the ground. The guy took another shot behind him and started to climb. I reached down with my good arm.

“Give me your hand!”

It’s amazing how a scenario like that can change your stance. I genuinely wanted to help him, but that wasn’t to be. The saguaro caught up and two of its several arms closed around him. He screamed out as his arm was pulled away from me, and two more shots were fired into the ground before he dropped the gun.

*“Oh God!”* he screamed. *“Help me!”*

I could only watch in terror as his body began to convulse and shrivel. His skin rippled as if his insides were being sucked into the cactus. He made several gargled attempts at crying for help before giving up, or he simply couldn't anymore.

I ran. I jumped from the back of the rock and fucking ran. The whole time I could hear a terrifying symphony of hisses behind me. The ground vibrated under my feet as clouds of dust shot across the desert. But I made it. My chest burned like I’d run a marathon but I made it to my car, starting the engine as cacti hurled themselves into it.

As I sped away I prayed that Alexi had somehow escaped. I felt truly awful for leaving him like that, but I had no choice.

I sat in Jules’ office as my arm was bandaged up by his right-hand man, Nails. Looking at it in the light it was covered in rows of circular puncture wounds.

“Where’s the briefcase?” said Jules with a smirk.

“Boss, come on,” I pleaded. “Look at me.”

“Where. Is. The. Brief. Case?”

I shook my head. “Something’s out there, boss. In the Sonoran. Something that isn't… *natural*.”

*“Where’s the fucking briefcase?"* He cocked a gun at me as Nails squeezed my arm, patches of blood seeping through the bandages.

*“It’s in the fucking desert!”* I screamed.

He smiled. “Then I suggest you go get it from the fucking desert.”

I shook my head, trying to hold back tears. “Please boss. Don’t make me go back there. The cacti… They’re not right. They feed on…”

He started laughing hysterically. “Did I ever tell you why we call him Nails?”

Jules held up a pair of pointed pliers, then handed them to Nails. He grabbed my hand and stretched out one of my fingers, nipping the end of my nail with the tool.

*“Okay!”* I yelled, my heart thumping. “Okay, I’ll go back!”

“Good boy,” said Jules. “Nails, why don’t go with him. Hold the baby’s hand.”

Nails didn’t speak, just nodded.

“Oh. And if the briefcase isn’t there, put a bullet in this motherfucker’s head.”

◈

We drove in silence, Nails pointing the gun at me the whole journey. He didn’t convey any emotion. In fact, thinking about it I don’t think I’d heard him mutter a single word. *Ever*. He had this gift of appearing super intense while looking like he couldn’t give the slightest fuck.

I pulled up in the same area I’d parked the previous evening, the sun now starting to rise. The car belonging to the other guys was still parked up in the distance with the doors open. I cautiously stepped out of my car. There were several tall cacti dotted around.

“It must be in this area somewhere,” I said. “Will you help me look?”

Nails just stared at me with the gun by his side.

“Okay… Well, I’m gonna look over here. But seriously Nails, watch your back. These things are alive.”

He continued to stare deadpan as I started searching for the briefcase, trying to find the area where Alexi had been shot. That was likely where I'd find it as he’d been holding it at the time. But there was still a chance he’d made it out of there with it. That didn’t put me in a good position though as my life currently depended on finding it.

After looking for a few minutes I found some spots of blood on the ground. I got a shiver down my spine as I was reminded of the evening’s events. As I searched I looked over my shoulder and listened out for hissing. But none of the saguaro looked particularly alive. They just looked like ordinary cacti.

My heart jumped when I saw the briefcase.

“Oh, thank God!” I yelled. It was leaning against a rock. I assumed it must have been the rock that Alexi had taken shelter behind, the last place I saw him. He was nowhere to be seen though.

I picked up the briefcase and held it to my chest, closing my eyes to appreciate the moment.

It was disturbed by laughter.

I looked around to see Nails standing in front of a saguaro, and he was laughing his head off. I had to do a double take. This man had never even smiled in my presence, let alone laughed!

With the briefcase secured I made my way towards him.

“I got it!” I yelled, holding it up.

He kept laughing as he looked up at that darn cactus. When I reached him he was doubled over! Something had tickled him. He was human after all.

“Alright Nails, what’s so funny?”

When I looked up I almost fell back in horror.

It was Alexi, or at least part of Alexi. His face was pinned to the top of the cactus.
