 Now before I delve deeper into what is happening to me, I will share my personal information. If you can help me in any way, PLEASE do contact me. If there is anything you can do, please message me. Also please excuse my English, it is not my native tongue.   

  I live in Brecheiser Straße 3, 25764 Hillgroven, Germany. Last name is Dannewender. You can message me on here.   

  First of all, before I start: I do NOT do any drugs, I don‘t even drink alcohol.   
  I am 33 years old, live in a very small town in northern Germany. Why I am asking for help might sound very weird, but it is how it is: I keep waking up. Now usually that‘s what everybody does every morning, but I find myself waking up during scenarios when I have not even gone to bed.   

  Suddenly everything turns dark, I flinch and awake in my bed. This has happened to me several times recently. I like to analyse stuff a lot, but I just cannot wrap my head around it.   

  I could be walking down the street after work, and suddenly I am in my bed again, as if it was all a dream. It could happen again at any time.   

  Just before waking up, I feel a weird pulling sensation in my chest, and horrifying events start happening around me. But let me start with the beginning and the first time this has happened to me, or at least the first time I remember.   
  I work an office job for a local politician. Around 6pm I pack my stuff, get into the car and drive a few kilometers back to my town. Looking back I have tried to remember every little detail that has happened on that day, but there is nothing to explain what happened to me. Not even the weather was weird, and it usually is rainy in these kinds of stories, no?   

  But maybe you can find some clues where I cannot.     

  I usually start the day with loads of (iced) coffee and checking my e-mails. Then around 11 I get the mail, answer letter and forms, do a few press handouts if anything has happened (mostly openings of new shops, events etc. where the politician I work for came over to get photos taken and speak during ceremonies), that sort of stuff. At lunch break, I usually sit outside eating my sandwich, then get back to the computer for a few hours. There was not a lot of work to be done that day, however, and the only really weird thing, which is not really weird, was me actually bumping into my collegue spilling his glass of water. So I went to the car shortly after six, and drove off. Passed a unusually big crowd of people centered around some new shop, and took my daily land road back home. My phone rang, but I only checked who called when I was home, since I have had a crash before looking at my phone during driving. Turns out it was an unknown number, and that whoever it was had left a message. I remember sitting at the kitchen table, checking the message. It was a voice, sounded male, simply screaming onto my inbox. Then the air went ice cold and I woke up. It was weird, because I had already woken up that morning in the usual way, living my daily normal life.   

  I have woken up as if from a dream around ten times since, and it was always accompanied by something that scared the hell out of me, and always I felt like I had lived a normal day up to that point – with the different that I grew more scared and more wary with every time. And it was always in random situations. I cannot live in peace knowing that I might well wake up at any moment, some horror lurking just around the corner. I cannot tell whether I am really awake now, and when I finally wake for real I would not be able to know if I really have. Maybe this is still this nightmarish loop and no one will read this. But if there is any chance, let me know. 
  
  The scream on my inbox was, however, by far not the worst thing that has happened. Let me tell you of a few more incidents. Around the third of fourth time I was sitting on a train on a saturday, traveling to the next big city to get my phone fixed (it seemed to not quite work after the mailbox-incident). The weather was great, I distinctively remember the fantastic forms of the shattered white clouds and the mainly blue sky. For some reason my apartment smelled of flowers, in a really heavy way. As I got out at my stop after around an hour drive, and I stepped onto the platform, I noticed I was the only one getting out here, which is not at all usual for this stop. Also the platform was nearly empty, remember this was on a saturday where the small town folk usually come here to shop. Anyway, I was on my way to the stairs leading down from the platform, when a man who ran up the stairs (I thought he was going to be late for his train) shouted at me, screaming „Now I finally get you!“ (in German) and suddenly brandishing a knife. I felt like I was paralyzed, and woke up in my bed, filled with horror. I felt like I had seen this man before somewhere, but my memories are blurry. Note that these things do not always happen on the same day. My record for leading a „normal“ life within all this lies at five days where nothing happened and I could go to bed and (at least I think so) sleep like a normal person.   

  But the scariest thing came a few days later, when I was on my way to work again. I had just woken up, had a shower and pretended like I had woken up for real this time (I thought that that was the only reasonable method, but a short time later I threw these thoughts overboard in the face of the sheer horror I felt).
   
  So I stopped at a gas station to fill up my car, and (which I noticed only in hindsight) it was completely silent, where usually in spring the air is full of noises with cars on the distant highway or birds and insects in the fields. I went inside to pay for the gas and the cashier and another customer just stood there, staring at me. They did not say a word, did not even react to my questions, just stared. I thought „it“ was happening again, and fled the shop, but did not wake up. Back in my car I tried to pass it off as something that people sometimes do – maybe I interrupted them exchanging secrets. But when I reached work – I did not pass a soul on my way, albeit being a monday morning – it had not changed. I entered my office room, and the whole staff, around 15 people was gathered there, simply staring at me when I entered. No one reacted to my questions, the only thing they did apart from following my every movement was blink from time to time.   

  I panicked and ran out, the initial thought of some sort of prank on the side of my collegues forgotten, and headed back to the parking lot. Someone was sitting on the passenger seat of my car, and only the devil knows why I sat down on the driver‘s seat anyway. That man looked a bit like me, only more disheveld, and with something about his look completely awry and wrong. I still cannot put my finger on what it was, but there was something totally off about his face.   

  Somehow I asked him where we would drive to, I cannot recall why, and he laughed and said: „To the gates, my friend“ (in German again), then he he pulled out a knife and the car was suddenly under water. I cannot recall whether I bled out or drowned first, but it was the single most disturbing event, or nightmare, that has ever happened to me.   

  That was yesterday, and I have not gone to bed last night. I sit here at the kitchen table like an idiot, with a kitchen knife, knowing full well it would not help me if something happened again.   

  If you know ANYTHING that could help me, please reply. Has that happened to any of you before? I don‘t know what to do. I am reaching the limits of what I can handle.
