Now, growing up where I did everybody just knew there were just certain places you didn’t get off to, day or night. The old flooded sinkhole. Certain parts along the river where you didn’t beach or trudge out to. Which caves were down-right out.


Let me tell you those places were bad. Make the skin crawl and the hair jump right off of your head, and that’s just the feel they gave. Course my dumb ass went to almost all of them. Yet today I’m talking about old Peterson’s Hollow. Now where we grew up that was the right and proper name on all the papers and deeds and what-have-you. Nah to everybody that lived around there it was just That Holler. No fancy nicknames or nothing like that cause it didn’t need it. Even the animals steered clear. 


See, That Holler had been on Peterson Land even though the family had moved on ages ago (according to Momma) and had fallen to the local government. They tried to auction it off, but there wasn't a single buyer that would take it. Locals knew better and they warned off everyone from outta the area. Poor county just couldn’t do anything with it except mark it off as protected government land for conservation purposes. Turned out to be a fair smart move on their part. Still didn’t get rid of That Holler, and still didn’t stop the wild tales. 


Locals for years been talking about seeing fox-fire and wisps, white figures walking along the sides, hell even recently they’ve been talking about shadow people. That’s just what they are though, tales. Stories. Things told so a grown soul doesn’t have to admit that the thought of going into a place makes them want to piss themselves. 


By now I’m sure you are all wondering what kind of beastie, critter, or thing might live there to scare folks so bad. Truth be told no one knows. Those that go in there, day or night, never come back out. Yeah, I know, what’s so scary about that? Well y’all know it’s said mankind's greatest fear is the unknown? Well what if I told you that Nothing is a lot scarier. Yeah, Poe knew it with that bird of his that would yell nevermore. For many the idea that there is nothing waiting for us when we die (I know better personally) is terrifying. So just imagine a place that isn’t just unknown but for all accounts and purposes is simply nothing. 


Nothing that goes in comes out. Ever. Simple as that. Now that’s not to say that it’s empty, oh no. You can plain see shrubs and the wet weather creek that flows through it. It’s right pretty in spring and fall too will all the young trees along the sides. It’s even safe enough to go along those sides if you dare. Just don’t touch bottom and you’re safe enough, though the slopes are really slippery with this slimy moss and it turns to scree under the leaves just past half way down. Those trees what should be hardwood also bend when you try to grab a hold instead of standing straight. Trees that never get any much bigger I might add. 


About now you might just be asking how I come to know all this. Well it’s all because of a beloved dog.


Bosco was just a brown mutt, so many different things we figured he had a bit of everything. I was out hiking late spring with Bosco and my buddy Lee, and we wanted to go see That Holler as it was blooming. We knew the rules, and the stories. Just last year a grieving widow that lost her husband in Desert Storm just up and walked straight into IT, not even hesitating, her sister said. So yeah, we knew the rules. 


So there we was, walking the top of the ridge looking into That Holler, when Bosco saw a damn squirrel up ahead (mind you them squirrels in these parts ain’t right, but that’s another story all together). He hated those things ever since one got his tail. Bit the back half of it clean off. So Bosco was off like a shot, and that thing sat there until the last second before jumping up a tree. Bosco, having all the grace of a logger trying to do ballet, went skitter-sliding right off the edge.


Lee, damn fool, took off after him, thinking he’d be quick enough to get him I guess. He was wrong, whatever he thought. I could only watch in shock.


Now I suppose some of you can call me a coward, but I wouldn’t be here to warn others had I followed. As our land backed up on that land, I had grown up there and knew. Just knew what would have happened if I followed. The nothing would swallow me up too. 


As I watched, first it was Bosco who wasn’t even quite to the bottom when the old dog was just gone. Not even any trace he had slid down. I had to watch as Lee lasted a bit longer, his skinny arms around one of them trees. That tree bent low as it could like it was trying to get Lee to slide off, but he was locked in place. I was trying hard to find something to lower to him when I heard it. Earth shifting. Looking back I could only witness that tree’s roots coming out of the ground. 


Lee shouted, “Tell my Ma I lo….”, and that was all he was able to get out before the Holler took him too. 


Falling back on my butt, staring where my friend once was. I could feel hot tears on my face, but I suppose cause of shock I couldn’t make a sound.


Evening started to fall and I pulled it together enough to head home, even though I was gonna be in those woods after dark. I think a part of me didn’t care, didn’t want to make it home. Didn’t want to face what I knew was coming.


Don’t really even remember the walk just that the sky was clear. Not sure how I found my way back. When I did though, Momma and Dad were waiting along with Lee’s Ma. Woman was like an Aunt to me. Felt like my heart being torn apart telling her what happened, what I saw, and the look on her face. Bless her, she never once blamed me. I did that plenty on my own. Though I just couldn’t bring myself to tell her everything.


See, there was something that day came outta the Holler. Sounds. Faint and far away like, but sounds all the same. I heard the screaming howls of a dog suddenly cut short followed by the sounds of bones breaking and meat tearing. Then I heard Lee’s wordless screams get further and further away.
