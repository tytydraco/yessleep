Okay. I don’t know where else to put this. The police have been useless, my family thinks I’m crazy, and I’m starting to believe them. I need to know if anyone has seen or heard of, well, anything like this happening before.

First, some facts. My wife, Clara is 29, 5'4", slightly overweight at maybe 130 lbs, long, muddy brown hair, but with the most striking blue eyes you’ve ever seen. She disappeared from our home on the night of October 18th. She was last seen going into our main bathroom for a shower around 7:30 PM. I was in the living room, which has a direct line of sight to the bathroom door. She never came out.

Before you ask, no, she didn’t leave me. We were happy. She was a bit high-strung, imaginative, but happy. She relied on me. That’s what makes this so impossible.

I guess all of this started about two weeks before her disappearance, with the sink.

I was checking my portfolio on my laptop when I heard her gasp from the kitchen. “Michael? Can you come here a second?”

I’ll be honest, I was annoyed. It’s not like she was working like me, she was just doing dishes. When I joined her in the kitchen, she was just staring into the sink, her hands all soapy. I remembered her saying, “I… I thought I saw blood. In the water.”

I looked. There was a faint pinkish swirl going down the drain. I told her, “It’s just ketchup, Clara. From dinner. Relax. You’re always letting your imagination run wild.”

She got this look on her face, this little-girl-lost look she’d get when she knew I was right but didn’t want to admit she was wrong. “You’re probably right,” she said softly. “It just… looked so dark.”

I went back to my laptop thinking case closed but the next night, the same thing happened. This time her voice was shaking. “Michael, please. It’s back.”

I sighed loud enough for her to hear and went in. There was a reddish-brown liquid pooling near the drain. I’ll admit, it gave me a pause as I almost bought her flight of fancy. But it wasn't hard to come to a logical conclusion.

“It’s rust, sweetheart,” I said, in my most reasonable voice. “The pipes in this place are ancient. I’ll call a plumber.”

The relief on her face was instant. “Oh. Rust. Of course. I’m just being silly.” She believed me. She always believed me.

I forgot to call the plumber. Work was crazy, and I had gotten back into Vampire Survivors so I didn't have much free time outside of work. Either way, it slipped my mind.

Then whatever was going on spread to the shower. I heard her scream, a short, sharp sound. I paused my game. The water shut off a minute later.

“You okay in there?” I called out.

She came out, pale and shivering. “It was in the shower, Michael. The blood. It came up from the drain.”

“Those darn pipes. Don't worry, it’s just the rust,” I told her, unpausing my game to collect a skull. “The pressure changes when the neighbor flushes their toilet or something. It’s not blood.”

“The plumber…” she started.

“I’ve got an appointment for Friday,” I lied. I was going to call the next day. I swear I was.

I never called.

The “rust” kept showing up. In the sink, in the shower, once in the toilet bowl. Every time, she’d look at me with those big blue eyes, seeking reassurance. And I gave it to her. I told her it was sediment. A trick of the light. I had it under control. I was the man of the house, right? That’s my job.

On the 18th, she went for a shower. I was grinding gold. Two hours later, I realized the water was still running. A steady hiss.

“Clara? You’re going to use all the hot water!” I yelled. No answer. Whatever, I thought.

Another thirty minutes. I finished a match. The silence from the bathroom felt… heavy.

“Clara?” I called again. Nothing.

A cold dread started to creep in. Had she slipped? I’d have to call an ambulance. Deal with hospitals. The thought was exhausting.

I knocked. No answer. The door was locked. That in of itself was not unusual. She always complained about me not being able to keep my hands off her whenever she undressed.   
  
I threw my shoulder against the door. The frame splintered.

The bathroom was full of steam. The shower was running. The curtain was closed.

She was gone.

Her towel was on the rack, dry. There are no windows. No vents big enough for a person. I was sitting ten feet from the only door the entire time. I never left my seat.

The police were a joke. They took a report, searched the house half-heartedly, and basically implied she’d walked out on me.

“Are you sure you two weren’t having problems?” the sergeant asked, not even looking at me.

“We weren’t! And there’s the blood!” I said, my voice cracking.

“Blood?”

“Not… a crime scene amount. But in the drains. For weeks. She kept seeing it.”

They exchanged a look. You know the one. The “this guy is unhinged” look.

“Sir,” he said, like he was talking to a child. “That sounds like a pretty clear case of rusty pipes. It’s common. We’ll put her in the system, but I’m sure she’ll turn up.”

They left. I felt like I was going insane. They were gaslighting me. Just like I… no. It’s not the same.

Last night, I was finally forced to wash my own dishes. The sink was full of my plates, my glasses. And that’s when I heard it. A wet, gurgling cough from the drain. I leaned in to get a better look.

It’s not rust. It’s thick. It’s dark. It smells like pennies and something else, something rotten. This is what she saw. This is what I told her wasn’t real.

I… I stuck my hand in. I don’t know why. I thought maybe I could find something, maybe the thing that was causing all of this.   
  
It felt... wrong. Wet, hot, and slimy. I tried to pull my hand back and it was stuck, like the drain was sucking on it. I was suddenly very aware that I would be mutilated if anything happened to the garbage disposal switch.  
  
That's when I heard a horrible sound of a motor revving up and blades spinning. It was only my neighbor starting his darn lawnmower but it scared the heck out of me. I pulled with everything I had, and finally my hand came free.

My hand was covered in that… stuff. And in my palm, stuck there by what looks like a piece of gristle, was something else.

It’s a blue eye. A brilliant, sapphire blue eye.

Clara’s eye.

The police won't return my calls. The plumber I finally hired says the pipes are clean. I’m sitting in my silent house, and all I can hear is the gurgling. It’s in every room now. Behind every wall.

Have you heard it too?
