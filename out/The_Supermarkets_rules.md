 My name is Alex and i recently took up a night guard job at a supermarket. The place is massive, and it always felt a bit eerie being there after dark. But little did I know, the true nightmares were about to begin.

On my first night, as I was patrolling the dimly lit aisles, I stumbled upon a folded piece of paper on a shelf. Curiosity got the best of me, and I opened it up to reveal 100 rules written in shaky handwriting. The rules were bizarre, creepy, and downright strange. At first, I thought it was some sort of prank, but as I read through them, an unsettling feeling crept over me.

Without being able to finish reading, i heard a strange sound, I checked my watch; it was 2:55 AM. My pulse quickened as the seconds ticked away. I found a spot to hide, my breaths shallow and quick. And then, it happened. The air grew colder, and a sense of dread enveloped me. I watched in horror as a figure emerged from the darkness, its eyes gleaming with an otherworldly light. 

I don't know how much time passed, but eventually, the figure retreated back into the shadows. I stayed hidden until i seen the light dissappear, shaken to my core. I emerged from my hiding place, the rules still fresh in my mind. I knew I couldn't keep this to myself, so here I am, sharing my experience with you all. 

But now, I'm faced with a dilemma, I've uncovered these rules, but what do I do next? How do I escape the grip of the supermarket's sinister secrets? As I write this, I can't shake the feeling that I'm being watched once again.
