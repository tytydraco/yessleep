   1. The shady chocolates

   This happened to my 2 friends (let's call them G and V) and I when we were just 9 years old. Whenever I think about it, it still sends chills down my spine because God knows what his motive was.
     We were hanging out in the parking lot of G's building and a random guy with a huge black duffel bag who we had never seen before enters the building (He was also staring at us for 15 minutes before this). He looks as if he's in his mid 40s and just gave all of us a bad feeling so we decided to move to the other side of the parking lot. He stood there for 20 minutes doing nothing like he was waiting for something. Or maybe...someone...
     Then just as we found a spot to sit, he came up to us and took of his cap which had some chocolates in it and asked us "Would you like some chocolate?". Since our parents had tought us to never accept chocolates from strangers. We all said no and started running away from him up the stairs to G's house. Right behind us we heard him shouting "I know your parents told you to not take chocolates from strangers but I'm not a bad guy!"
    We always thought about he was suspicious cause why was he waiting for 20 minutes in a random building with a large empty duffel bag and why did he have chocolates in his cap? Almost like he was just waiting to meet children (maybe not for good reasons). Also why was he staring at us for a long time before entering? It's pretty shady. Luckily, we've never seen him again.

                                                   
                              
  2. Can you help me?

     This one was even scarier cause a random lady came up to G, V and I and asked us to help her to keep a few bags in her trunk. I mean like why would you ask 3 11 year olds to help you keep your bags when an adult could help you? And also why would you ask for help when you're literally travelling with a man who seems perfectly capable?
     We were like, eh, okay sure. We decided we'll get out of there if we noticed something weird. So we went and she opened the trunk there were 3 suitcases to keep inside and I noticed the man standing right behind us and me being paranoid, I was worried since he could easily push us into the trunk right now.
     I whispered to V my thoughts and that we should prolly leave. She agreed. All 3 of us started running away and they tried to block us but we went straight up to V's house. It still manages to creep us out to this day cause like what could have happened to us if we stayed.



 3. A glitch in the dimensions?
    
   This happened to me a few months ago and still creeps me out whenever I think of it. Just a normal Tuesday, I decided to finish a monochromatic painting I was doing the night before with a new box of paints. In this box, only one paint bottle was used. The orange one. Yk the white circular thing new paint bottles have on top to stop the paint from drying out? I had removed it the night before and thrown it in the trash too, on Monday.
   When I opened the paint bottle on Tuesday, it still had the white circular thing on top and appeared to be brand new when I remember I had clearly mixed some white (old paints) with it by mistake yesterday. Moreover the other paints which I had never opened didn't not have the white thing and appeared to have been used. The bow of paints was also in a completely different spot from where I had placed it the night before. I spent half an hour trying to find it. What do you think happened? I would like to know your thoughts cause it still intrigues me to this day.
    

                        
 4. The dream I never wanted to see...or...is it reality?

     This happened to me when I was 11. I was never a kid who was scared of the paranormal or had nightmares. Quite a long time back but I still remember it quite vividly.
      I had a fever due to the flu and was particularly very weak. I always have weird dreams when I'm weak but I don't really know if this is real or not.
     I was trying to sleep at night, tossing and turning and the temperature felt quite low even though it was the summer. This all happened in such a weird haze.
     I felt something touch me even though I was the only one in the room. It felt very cold and gave me a very intense bad feeling.I suddenly felt a sharp pain as if something swallowed me whole and I screamed "no don't do this!".
   It felt as if my whole soul was getting stolen from me. I felt emotionless now. Suddenly i felt human again as I felt like something was leaving me and I returned back to my senses, scared. I don't know how much time passed or for how much time I was in that emotionless state. I don't even know if this was a dream or my reality. My cat has always sensed something in my bedroom and growls and hisses at the wall when she looks up. I have had no experiences since then.
