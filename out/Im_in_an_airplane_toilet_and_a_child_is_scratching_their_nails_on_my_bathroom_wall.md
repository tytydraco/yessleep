I lift my gaze with pride. While donning an astronaut suit, I smile – for the picture. I knew I’d rather be sulking after the big beef that I had with my parents – and biting off my nails till they were nonexistent, but I have a sense of assertiveness that they were proud, proud as hell for what I was doing. They’re probably not surprised, though. I’m really stubborn. I’m the kind of person to take everyone’s opinion, and then end up doing what I feel like doing.

A few years before, I had made the decision to be an astronaut. Now, I’m finally getting a chance to go to a planet where no one has ever been on before. My parents have always disapproved, but of course, I get to decide.

One thing is for certain, if I really do end up making it to Mars, then the entire world will be calling out my name. There is just one catch, the only catch is that I’m gonna be making the long trip alone, with only a scrawny pilot who’s a puppet for the government.

They can’t let a civilian like me escape. It would be a huge stain on their reputation, as everyone knows what they have done to people that had attempted to escape, impossible as it sounds, as they would have to flee the planet and somehow find another world. 

Now, who is *they*?

Good question.

Here, we have a dictatorship. The creepy part is, though, that you never know who’s in charge. Your most trusted friend could be the dictator, watching your every move, and thus people decide to shy away from such topics.

I snap out of my thoughts when a middle-age woman beckons for me to put on my helmet. Everything else happens in a blur. By the time I gain awareness of myself, I'm chilling in the spaceship.

I hear the countdown on the radio, and start preparing for takeoff. The rocket starts ascending into the air. I hold my breath as we soar up, and I look around me to see if I can find anything I can fiddle with, and I end up finding a crusty piece of tape. It’s ugly, but it’s something to keep my boredom at bay. 

A tormenting amount of time later, the ship reach a reasonable height. I look down at the scenery. It feels so blessed, yet so cursed.

It’s been four hours, and I feel the pressure clogging up my throat. I look outside and admire the stars. I start getting bored, but I continue, with my eyes glued to the darkness outside the window. I start floating, so I tighten the strap around my waist. That seems to do the trick, but my legs are still flailing in the air like anything. I would die for a shawl right now, but I'm pretty sure this bulky suit should make it for the night. I snuggle up, and then I feel the cramps all along my body.

You know what? I think I’m just not going to sleep.

It’s been eight days. We stop by a nearby resource camp, situated on a tiny planet. I can finally take my helmet off for some time, and god, it feels so relieving. We rest there and refuel, and that’s our last pit stop.

Other than the fact that I haven’t slept in eight days, everything is going well. The pilot gives me a machine, to sleep for long periods of time, when there is no work to do. After untangling the wires and plugging it into a portable plugging system, it seems to take effect. Soon enough, I fell asleep.

—---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rocket is falling.

This can’t be happening.

I scream to the pilot.

No answer.

I feel myself wheezing.

My screams feel quieter – the louder I scream.

Suddenly, I find myself gasping for air, and everything feels heavy. My head is spinning, and all I see is a woman in front of me.

I scream again and see a child next to me, who doesn’t seem the slightest bit bothered by my hollering. In fact, he looks pleased to see the surprise on my face. Nevertheless, they both are staring. At me. The woman shook me and asks if I was having a seizure.

Finally, I gain awareness of my surroundings.

Why am I in an airplane?

I need to fully comprehend what was happening here before I answered her question. The child’s staring at me, perhaps chuckling at my stupidity. I’m not wearing my suit anymore. The air hostess looked quite normal. Everyone in the plane is unbothered by my screaming. How did I get here? The best answer would be that the ship crashed–perhaps in another universe altogether. But — what happened to the pilot? And… this place is quite eerie— the colors look so forced, and faux. The seats are so bright, I feel like I’m in a cartoon. The woman in front of me doesn’t look real either. Everything looks faux. Then I look at the child. It’s so different from everything here, I think. Everything else looks somewhat convincing. In contrast, this child looks so wrong, and inhuman, that everything else starts looking right. His pupils look so spherical, that it seems as if he blinked, then his pupils would flatten. Maybe that’s why he hasn’t blinked since I boarded this plane. This child is now staring into my soul. I snap out of my thoughts and look away from it.

The air hostess finally concludes that I wasn’t going to answer her question and walked away, after slipping something into my pocket.

Suddenly, the child scrambles for my pocket. It starts growling, screaming, and making inhumanly sounds that I can’t describe. My hands begin shaking, and for two seconds I can’t even move. Giving it my all, I shakily run to the bathroom and rip open the note.

The note has the word TEST in big red letters on top of the note. There was a set of instructions underneath, coated in silver lining. There’s a calming feeling about this note. My eyes shifted down the paper, reading it.

“Whatever you do, do NOT let them get hold of this note. Do NOT stay in a certain room or seat for more than twenty minutes, and do NOT look anyone in the eye.”

Don't let who get hold of this note? The child? The air hostess? Before I can grasp some possibilities, I hear that inhuman sound again. Nails are now scratching my door and the constant bangs are so loud, it almost blasts my ears. My nose starts to bleed and time is ticking. I can sense that it’s probably been over ten minutes, and I make a decision. I rose to my feet and opened the door. The child is gone. I sigh with relief. I decide to sit down somewhere else, really far away, and just watch scenes of movies in the 20 minutes that I have.

The hours consisted of switching seats, checking time, and effort to get as far away from the child as humanly possible. I think I might have finally lost him. I check around my seat, and he’s sucking on his pacifier, fast asleep. I’m getting sick of watching Bad Guys, so I have to find something else to do.

I pull out the paper and re-read the note, as I’d forgotten some rules. The child's face flashed before my eyes before it comes and settles on my shoulder. It seems as if I just can't escape it.

"What if I were to cut off your nose right now?"

Suddenly, everybody starts to laugh, while looking at me with bloodshot eyes. It looks as if they’re angry, or confused on why they are laughing. I was most definitely the only human on this flight.

Re-opening the note, I realize that the rules had changed. There was only one rule, coated in silver lining. “Do the opposite of what anyone says, no matter who they are.” I suspect that after I broke the rules by letting someone grab my note, everything turned haywire. This is quite the random rule, but I’ll make sure not to break it this time, as it might be my last chance.

An announcement pops up on my screen. “We’ll be going through some turbulence, stay safe, and don’t panic.” Before even thinking, I run to the cockpit – which is unexpectedly unlocked – smash the windows, and jump. I manage to do the opposite as I promised – but am I really falling to my death right now?

I suddenly land with a revolting THUMP on hard ground. As I take a sigh of relief, it suddenly changes to a grimace, and I realize the ground is really hot – I scream, jump up and rub my back furiously. I’m getting sick of this. I can still hear the baby’s shriveling, inhumanly wails ringing in my ears. I slump up and notice this place looks like hell, with burning lights everywhere and Do Not Disturb signs outside brick walls covered in black ash – are they supposed to be rooms?

This place is an illusion.

Every second, it turns into something new. From hell, to heaven, to colors and realms I can’t describe. I walk ahead, only to see a black figure standing tall and rather eerily in front of me.

“Do you remember me?”

“No…?”

Suddenly, the figure starts wailing and screeching, just like that child on the plane, but much, much louder. Blood starts coming out of my ears and I cringe, barely being able to put together words.

“I remember you.”

“Good. Wanna talk about your new duties?”

“Duties?”

“Did you not realize? You’ve been chosen!”

“Chosen for WHAT?”

“You’re the new dictator.”

Suddenly everything makes sense…

Why they picked me to go to Mars, the tests, the silver lining … was all the government.

“You’re making me the dictator?”

“Come with me.”

The figure takes me to a throne, and starts explaining all the rules in detail.

“If someone tries to do anything to overpower the government, you either turn them in to us, or anonymously finish them off.”

“Whenever you need backup, hold your ear for approx. 8 seconds, but don’t make it obvious.”

“Weapons will only be useful to you when you need them and, if at any time or any place at all, your cover is blown, we have to finish you off.”

“So would you like to start, or be finished?”

My thoughts erupt — I have so many questions that I know nobody will answer. This is bad, but… look at all the power, I just have to make sure nobody finds out. Plus, I don’t have many options here.

“I can start now.” We shook hands, and sooner than I expected, I found myself back on Earth.

My parents don’t seem to remember anything at all about me going to Mars, neither does anyone, actually. It’s as if I had been on Earth this entire time, just chilling, for what — two weeks? The entire day after that consisted of me asking everyone I knew if they remember anything specific, any accomplishments, or just anything that would help me understand what actually happened when I was gone. Well, I won’t be rich, but at least I have power.

A month later I record my entire experience in a red diary, locked with two keys, which are both hidden in my bathroom closet where no one except me will ever read it. I have a passion for just writing everything down and I’m never letting that passion go.

Two months later, I still have no orders to do anything, and I doubt I ever will. Dictatorship is probably just fun stuff where you never actually have to do anything, and I am loving the power. Everyone is giving me the princess treatment, and I love it. Later that night, I decide to get some quality time with my other half (my sister, obviously) and before I know it, I’m chilling in my room, playing games with my sister, when all of a sudden I get a call from my best friend. She asks me to come over, and I’m all too happy. My sister definitely isn’t the most pleased, and I convince her by telling her I’d be back faster than she realizes.

I drive to her house, and we walk to her room. We sit together and gossip, the daily news, drama, and events with hot cocoa in our hands. I ask her why she called me here, and she starts telling me about how she wants to overthrow the government. I’m horrified, as I know, the government spies on people through me, so they can hear every word. This is my first assignment, so I think I might have to… kill her or something?

My heart leaps in my throat. She leads a bulletin board filled with horrifyingly accurate clues and tests as to who the dictator is. She spreads a big poster on the floor and explains to me every detail. I have bit off all my nails at this point — and I make a dash for the bathroom.

I run to the bathroom, and immediately start getting orders through my earpiece, which just appears out of nowhere – ironic.

Can you hear me?

Yes, Yes I can hear you. We heard everything.

What should I do?

Just evacuate the house, we’ll take care of it.

Do I have to?

Of course you have to.

After saying bye to her, I run back home and, of course, cry myself to sleep.

Next morning, what do you know? Every channel was blasting the same thing —

“Woman betrays the government, she regrets it.”

Poor, low-class people are sick and starving on the streets, just begging for a bite to eat, and what do these people do? Kill them. Why? Because they’re just a burden, just some scrawny humans, who won’t do anything good to contribute to the economy.

2 years later,

I’ve exposed hundreds of innocent people and counting. I’m always being watched, and I always have to stay tough. My family has no idea what's going on at all, I’m all alone, nobody to relate to, but I can’t let my life remain a sob story anymore. I have work to do.

After taking a convincing job and staying undercover, I now have to work long hours. I smile. I guess this is how adult life is like. I make my way home after submitting a report.

“I’m home!” No response. I walk into my parents room, they’re sleeping. I guess I shouldn’t disturb them — they already had a long day at work and will have a long day tomorrow. I don’t bother waking up my sister, since she gets really cranky. She’s probably watching her phone, though.

I take a bath, and finally slip into my favorite pajamas.

As I finally creak open my bathroom door, I get the shock of my life then and there.

My diary is open, and my sister is on my bed reading it.

Both of my locks are on the floor.
