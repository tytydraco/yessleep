I had a dream that I was at an island port, on a little ship. A queerly old one. A schooner with an ivory wheel and a gold plated figurehead of a church bell. The waves were calm and I can hear them lap against the side of the seamless wooden hull causing a timid chime. She is magnificent and her name was The Grand Duchess. Not a more majestic ship had existed yet when the scarlet morning Sun had hit her port side, which with such a fresh veneer, nearly reflected it. Not a piece of her could be replaced because she was one of a kind. Silver and ivory lined every inch of her trim with speckles of gold here and there.

With sullen but proud faces, the whole crew was preparing for an Odyssey, understanding that it will be long and laborious, as is standard for all bitter farewells. The captain stands stoically at the helm, hand draped on the gilded wheel and carefully eyeing his crew at work in quiet admiration. Gulls hang loosely and lazily in the air and untied strips of sail sway gently in the breeze. Behind the nearby port gate many citizens and dock workers alike gather to watch the solemn voyage depart, if only briefly, only to lose interest and meander away.

I've had this dream many times. It only began after I saw her portrait. At an antiquarian shop | frequented, while looking among the various brittle records and semi maintained books from all times and ages, I question the owner on any new pieces. That is when I first laid eyes on her.

The borders are made with mahogany and silver so masterfully constructed, that at first glance may have looked like it had been put there merely minutes earlier, if there wasn't a date fastened to it. A metal tag made of engraved gold with the words "Final Godbys of The 'Grand Duchess' -1/19/1810" nailed tightly to the wall nearby. She is an exact replica of my dreams. Gorgeous strokes of oil paint wash the canvas with deliberate movement that expresses, no doubt, bringing life into the art itself. The details on every inch are so fine it might have been mistaken for a photograph now and again. I purchased her on the immediately. Simply the pride of owning such a masterpiece meant that I had to bring her to an exhibition. Not all who saw the portrait understood the engraving, but those who did couldn't help but quietly weep. Some have compared witnessing the portrait to watching ones you love march to the Gallows.

This and more are why I refuse to display her at all now. It was trouble enough that it gave me vivid daydreams and terrible nightmares, but the fact that she captivated so many others in such a manner could become perilous. I had her beauty hidden in the attic as it is my burden alone. But even now I can't help but feel so selfish. Who am I to covet such an amazing piece? Was it I who was ordained by the Lord or did I simply ordain myself with the unstoppable power of arrogance? I fooled myself into believing I was the only one who could have her. My realization struck me with force.

It needs to be destroyed. The spell that she put on all who set eyes upon her worried me more than anything after countless, sleepless nights. I can hear the waves rolling just above my head. Every night they start the same, calm, barely audible splat, splat, splat. The creaking of the hull will rises as the waves grew more treacherous, turning from light rapping into scores of angry fists beating each side of the ship, filled with unholy Malice. The room would swell with the putrid stench of salt water and dried chum, pounding my head and crusting my lungs. As she makes her crescendo, I sway and shake and the room cracks and warps until finally the figurehead rings. A warning for a rogue wave comes all too late and a heavy crash brings me back to my sweat covered bed.

The Grand Duchess forever sleeps at the bottom of the ocean. All her crew, all her passengers and all her cargo would never arrive. Was that my ordination? To live out her tragedy night after night? I can't and I wont, but she's calling for me now and my legs are moving all on their own.

I had a dream that I was on the open ocean. I was drifting face down, too terrified to open my eyes. I didn't need to see her, I could feel her, she was warm like a fresh summer tide and comforting like a mother's hug. Her eyes pierced mine. When i open my eyes I see nothing but the black abyss, no ocean floor, no schools of fish, Pure absolute infinite nothing.

She called and I answered, but now she wants too much.

When you find what remains of me and you find this letter, do what must be done and do as I ask. Nothing of me must linger. Nothing of the house must remain, Certainly nothing of Her. She calls out to me and she has changed. From a Portrait of a ship to The Portrait of a lady.
