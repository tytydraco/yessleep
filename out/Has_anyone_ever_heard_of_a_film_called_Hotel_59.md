I recently came across a film I rented about two weeks ago that I thought would be a good first horror movie for my son. He just recently turned eight and he was so excited to see a glimpse into the world of horror.

 Zach would always come home complaining that his friends went to go see a new slasher film called Terrified 3 or something along those lines. I read some reviews online that said one scene was so bad that they started puking and had to leave the theater. Something about a whisk up the ass, but I stopped reading from point. 

This was not a movie I would show my son. I didn’t even understand why he wanted to watch horror movies. I believe he’s wanting to fit in with his friends and say he has seen one.

Anywho, I couldn’t take him to the movies this week on the account that our family was pretty poor. I hate to admit that, but I want to explain why I didn’t take him to movies in the first place. I decided to head to the old Rent Films store to rent a movie for a week. That place use to be the so hip back in my day. I wanted to go there and get the movie before Zach came home from school. If only I had picked a different film.

I finally pulled up to Rent a Film and I’m sad to say it is a dump. Ever since these new streaming services started popping up, no one wants to rent DVDs anymore. I walked into the store and saw only two people. The cashier who worked here, and one fella just looking through the films they offered. There was only around 50 movies to rent from so it was slim pickings.

 I made my way to the teen movie section and saw a couple of old horror movies I used to watch. The old Tuesday the 19th and A Night terror on McPherson Street. These kinds of movies were too old for him. I wanted to be a cool Dad to him, so I kept looking. As I kept looking around my eyes landed on a film called Hotel 59. 

I’ve never heard of this film before so I decided to look it up on my phone. As I was searching, I couldn’t find a single thing on this film. I continued to examine the case of the film but it didn’t have a rating, plot summary, director, nothing. The only thing that was there was the title in red bold letters. Hotel 59

I went up to the cashier to get some more information on the film. He took it from my hands to scan the movie. “It’s not showing up in our database sir.” I turned my head and asked him if he had ever seen this film before. The cashier said no, but marked it up anyway so I could rent it. “I’ll just mark it as an unnamed so you can rent it for the week.” I thanked him for his kindness and left the store. I should’ve just put it back when he said it wasn’t in the stores database. 

It was almost 5pm, the time my son was supposed to come home from school. I made some popcorn and grabbed some soda so it would feel like a real movie theater. He finally got off the bus and ran his way to the door. I hid behind the door to surprise him. “Happy birthday!” I yelled. A big smile stretched across his face. “What did you get me! What did you get me!” I pulled the movie from my coat pocket. I finally was going to be a cool dad.

“What the hell is that” my son said. I told him to watch his language and be grateful. I explained that he was old enough to watch his first horror movie and that we would watch it together. He sighed as if he was disappointed that I wasn’t taking him to see Terrified 3. “Hey come on. The cashier said this was the scariest movie of all time.” I peaked his interest with that statement. He sat down on the couch as I popped the DVD in to begin the film. I shuffled to sit beside him and I myself was excited to see what I had rented.

The movie began with a blank beige wall. The title card pops up but no director or actors in the beginning credits. It focus on that wall for about 10 mins. The film looked like it was being recorded on an old video recorder but the date and time were marked out in post production. All of a sudden a chair appears in front of the wall but still not sounds or music was being played. Just static. We again watch for another ten minutes as nothing happens. I can see my son was getting pretty bored, so I offered to turn off the film. As I was reaching for the remote, the plot of the film had finally begun.

A man was now sitting in the chair but something was wrong. Tape bound him to the chair and it looked like he was struggling. The man was wearing a latex suit which frightened me for a moment cause I thought I had bought a…..different kind of film. If only it had been that. 

The film cuts to the man with what looks like the hose of a vacuum cleaner taped to his mouth. I began to sweat as something didn’t feel right about it. As the movie continued, the loud sound of a vacuum switching on erupted from the speakers. The man’s muffled screams were drowned by the sound of the vacuum. I then heard what sounded like running water rushing down the tube. The man’s screams became even more muffled as it sounded like he was drowning. I had enough and turned off the film. “Go to your room. Now!” Zach ran up to his room with tears in his eyes. 

I was frustrated with myself at what I just showed my son. This didn’t seem fake. It seemed so real. I thought it was just a new era horror film or something like that but something was off. 

A quiet knock came from our front door. I was so scared after that first 35 mins of the film I just wanted to ignore it and go to bed. The knocking kept going so I finally caved in. I opened the door but to my surprise no one was there. I looked around our front porch to see if anyone was playing a prank on me. Till my eyes landed on a note. I picked it up and what it said almost made me jump out of my skin

“Finish the film”
