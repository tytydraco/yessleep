The following is a simple guide to keeping your skin on, based on transcripts of conversations with my mentor, Rule. It’s also a guide to doing the opposite, if that’s your thing.

It was sheer dumb luck when I fell into that space between between the back left corner of Green Brother’s Auto and cheap a plastic storage shed. It just happened to be a space his union watches — *my* union now, I guess, but we’ll get to that.

Rule folds his long fingers politely in his lap. He’s sitting in a metal folding chair. His eyes fall softly on the phone in my hand. Apparently they don’t have these where he’s from. We’re in a warehouse. *Just* a warehouse. I’ve never looked outside. It’s a stable space *and* I’d like to keep it that way. A facsimilie of natural light is all we have to see each other by.

Rule looks up from my phone. The eyes. They’re just a little too far apart.

“Do the recordings match your memories?” He asks.

I hesitate. An errant thought slips out of my unconscious and wedges itself into the machinery of my mind. For a while I was recording both of us, but when reviewing the footage I would see subtle movement in the background behind me. It was like a living smudge. When the smudge began to take definite shape I decided there was no reason for me to be in the frame.

“Not exactly. At first they do. I’ve been writing them down, like you suggested.”

He nodded knowingly. Rule is almost handsome, in an Uma-Therman-Benedict-Cumberbatch sort of way. The sexy part of the uncanny valley, I suppose. Hmm. Not going to unpack that one

“May I see the oldest one? A curiosity.”

I smile reflexively. My heart starts up. I’m *in* Rule’s union. He won’t hurt me. And yet, I’m always worried he won’t need me anymore. Or worse, won’t send someone when I need him. He doesn’t have to hurt me himself to hurt me.

“I delete them.”

“That’s wise, Dewdrop.”

Listen, I didn’t pick it. I’m “Dewdrop”, apparently, because of the ease of which I fall into spaces. Maybe you do to. I’m sharing these in hope they keep you safe. Not everyone finds intelligent, powerful, interested, benevolent entities early enough. It’s only the benevolent part that’s in short supply.

“There are conceptual spaces as well as physical ones. Too often we forget that we are not merely readers, but authors.”

He pauses, meeting my eyes. I’m twenty-six but I feel like a child.

“Be careful what you create.”

When I don’t respond, he nods approvingly. I treat Rule like a zen monk. I don’t really understand half of what he tells me. I just act like I get it, try to look serious, then write it down. I write it all down. If you find yourself in places that shouldn’t exist. If events in your life rhyme, over and over. You should do that too. Like… now.

You’ll thank me when hallways turn upside-down, or when people start using words you’ve never heard and become irrationally angry when you speak back. Trust your memories. Trust your intuition more. Trust your journal the most.

“Tell me what you’ve seen and ask your questions.” Rule said.

Two dozen trips come to mind since that last time we met. The memories race to my mouth, but the details all blur together. So I open my journal.

…See?

“August 12th 4:00pm.”

Ah shit. Why did I start with this one?

“There’s a place in a clearing, beyond the woods behind my childhood home. I remember seeing it on our adventures. There were three of us that day. The other two kids were a little younger than me.

I remember thinking how strange it was that their clothes had so little color. The fabric was thick and the clothes ill-fitting. I only ever saw them once. Half of the kids I played with were like that. I knew it was weird, even then, but it wasn’t weird in a bad way. They were kids. I was a kid. And we were united in boredom.

The place itself… it’s just a dry rotted old tool shed. There’s nothing but dust, planks, and rusting metal inside. It’s real, if you’re wondering. I went back to see. I even went inside this time. It gave me the same feeling.”

I look up from my journal to signal that entry was done. Perhaps if I rush into the next one we can skip over this…

“Was it truly the same?”

Fuck. *Feel without filtering.*

I feel it. Like an ocean of molten steel, crashing ceaselessly into a wall in the air. Pounding. Pounding. It never stopped. It never stopped. It’s just a shed. It’s just a field in the woods. Between the overwhelming peaks of soundless noise there is a burrowing silence. A craven, furious intellect that drills into me between the pulses of its vast, malevolent heart.

*Name the feeling*

Oppression.

Sweat falls in droplets onto my journal. I’m shaking.

“Stronger.” I rasp.

And then we come to the topic I’ve dreaded since Rule and I met, since that day as a kid, really. That knowing smile is gone.

“Can you stop it?” I ask.

Rule speaks slowly, gazing idly at his spindly fingers as he waves them through the air.

“I’ve never heard of such a thing. Nor has anyone in the union.”

I start to speak but he cuts me off.

“Not anyone… nor any*thing* I could consult knows even a little of what you tell me.” He says.

“But there is a hole. A place in many stories where people, and places, and even concepts go missing.”

That was all he said. For the rest of the session we spoke of more normal things. Like… peering into people’s eyes when they’re sleeping to watch or slip into people’s dreams, and… *god damn*… what I can only describe as an inter-dimensional glory hole. It’s as high-risk, high-reward as the scene I stumbled upon seemed to indicate. Let’s leave it at that.

Rule assured me the union would look into the place in the woods, then we parted. I left the way I came in. By placing my fingers at the crack in a wall, stepping back back into the recessess of my mind until my eyes glazed over, then falling, like I always do.

If any of this means anything to you, you know what I mean. You *know* how to do it. Even if only in an intuitive way. That’s about the only way into boundary spaces, really. Except by accident. Or if you’re pulled in.

There’s *generally* nothing there. They make a for a cool hangout spot, until the exit disappears. Assuming there ever was one.

Fortunately, most people aren’t “Dewdrop”-y enough to fall into these things like potholes. If you are, you either know what you’re doing by now or you’re already gone. Adjacencies, though…

Everyone will move through adjacencies at some point in their life. These are neighboring, sometimes overlapping, branches of our infinitely sprawling reality. What *is* an adjacency exactly?

It’s that quiet town you drove through, and you wondered to yourself, where is everyone? It’s the time when your friends told a joke that made no sense about a movie you’ve never heard of. And it’s the darkened back coorridor of the hotel you stayed in, years ago. You joked about how it was definitely haunted.

So we come to the most important lesson I wanted to pass on: how to get out.

It’s not hard. Pay attention though. And write it down (you’ve been doing that, right?).

1. Notice when something is off
2. Feel without filtering
3. Name the feeling

You might do okay ignoring it. The worst you could do is chase that surreal feeling, magnifying it. Well, I guess that depends on how you want to end up. If what you want is to go back to regular life — whatever that is for you — my advice, and what my union taught me, is to do the things, think the thoughts, and move in ways that  
  
4. Directly oppose the feeling

That should get you back on your preferred path. For lunatics like myself who step off on purpose, well, I can only tell you…

Trust your memories. Trust your intuition more. Trust your journal the most.
