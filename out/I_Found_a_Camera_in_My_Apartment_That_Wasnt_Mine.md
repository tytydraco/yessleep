I have no idea how to explain this without sounding paranoid, but everything I am about to write is exactly what happened. I used to read horror stories on Reddit for fun and never believed any of them. Now I understand why people say reality can be worse than fiction.

I moved into a small studio apartment just outside the city. It was cheap, a little too cheap now that I think about it. The place had a musty smell and a few pieces of old furniture the previous tenant never bothered to take. I shrugged it off since I was desperate and the lease was easy to sign. I spent my first weekend settling in.

On my second night, I was unpacking when I noticed a small black object tucked behind the radiator. I assumed it was an old charger or some random junk. When I picked it up, I realized it was a camera. Not a webcam and not a GoPro. It was an actual compact camera. Something about it made my heart drop. I did not understand why anyone would leave it behind a radiator of all places.

I turned it on and saw that the memory card inside was completely full. Curiosity fought with dread. Eventually dread lost and I slid the card into my laptop.

The photos inside… they were of me.

I almost threw up when I realized what I was looking at. At first I told myself the photos must be old. Maybe the previous tenant looked similar to me. Maybe I was overreacting. Then I noticed the timestamps. They were recent. Some were taken earlier that day.

There were photos of every part of my apartment. The couch. The bathroom. The bed. Most of the photos showed me sleeping. Some showed me with my back turned in the bathroom and I had no idea the camera was there. It made my skin crawl. The angles were perfect too, like someone was carefully watching from a hidden spot.

I could not think straight. I felt sick and dizzy and completely exposed. I wanted to run out immediately, but something kept me frozen. After a minute that felt like an hour, I decided to search the apartment myself.

I checked the closets, under the bed, behind the shower curtain, every possible place a person could hide. Nothing. The more normal everything looked, the more terrified I felt. I tried convincing myself the timestamps on the camera were glitched or that someone hacked the memory card, anything that made more sense than the idea of a stranger in my home.

When I went back to the radiator, I noticed something else. Behind it was a tiny hole drilled into the wall. It looked intentional. Whoever put the camera there knew exactly what they were doing. I felt like someone had punched me in the chest. My breathing got shaky and my hands were sweating. Someone had been watching me since the moment I moved in.

I did not sleep at all that night. I sat on my bed with the lights on, holding a kitchen knife as if that would help. Every small sound felt threatening. At around three in the morning, I heard a click. A camera shutter. It was quiet, but unmistakable.

My blood ran cold. I did not move. I stared at the radiator like it was alive. The radiator had shifted. Just slightly. I know it did, because I kept staring at it all night and it had not looked like that before.

I picked up the camera again and checked the last photo. I wish I had not. I wish I had never touched that memory card. The most recent photo was taken in my bedroom, but it was not taken from behind the radiator. It was taken from inside the room. The picture was blurry, but visible enough to make me scream. A figure stood in the far corner of my room just behind the edge of the photo. The face was impossible to make out, but the posture was wrong. It was standing completely still, too stiff, almost unnatural.

I threw the camera across the room, grabbed my phone, and ran out of the apartment. I did not even lock the door. I ran straight to my car and stayed there until the sun came up.

The next morning I called my landlord and tried to explain everything. He sounded confused and said no one had keys except him and the maintenance staff. He said the apartment had been empty for months. He acted like I was imagining things. I know what I saw and I know what I felt.

I have not gone back. I left everything behind. I am staying with a friend now and I thought the distance would help me calm down, but it has not. I keep thinking about the camera. And the figure. And one more thing that haunts me.

There was still one more photo on the card when I threw the camera. I saw the number on the screen. I did not check it and I cannot bring myself to think about what it might show. I keep wondering if the last photo was taken after I ran out. Maybe it was taken from my doorway. Maybe it was taken from the hallway while I fled. I do not want to know.

Late at night, even though I am somewhere completely different, I still feel watched. Sometimes I wake up and swear I hear that same soft click from the dark corner of the room. I tell myself it is my imagination, but the feeling never leaves.

I do not know if it stayed behind in the old apartment or if it followed me.

I just know it is not finished with me.
