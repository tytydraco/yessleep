Have you ever experienced that eerie sensation of catching a glimpse of someone out of the corner of your eye, only to find no one there when you turn to look? Most of us tend to dismiss it as a figment of our imagination. However, such occurrences are not merely illusions. If you find yourself repeatedly encountering such apparitions, it's best to consciously ignore them. Once you return home, take precautionary measures such as sprinkling a generous amount of kitchen salt at your doorway and burning some basil. Following these steps should help alleviate any concerns and restore a sense of calm.  
  
However, I don't think I'll make it alive. It's too late for me  
  
Since I've got glaucoma, my vision has been getting worse. At first, I could manage with glasses. Now I can barely see things when they are close by, like the computer monitor. But I can't drive anymore. I have a white and red cane that helps me walk in the city.  
  
I developed glaucoma as a result of my type one diabetes. I've had diabetes since I was a kid. So most of my life I've been on a diet and insulin. The problem was when I got into my teenage years. Regrettably, I made unwise decisions—I acknowledge my own foolishness. I stopped adhering to my prescribed medications and started indulging in weekend drinking, succumbing to the recklessness often associated with adolescence. Now, in hindsight, I deeply regret those choices, but I have come to accept that the past cannot be changed; it remains as it is.  
  
At the age of 24, I became aware of my visual impairment for the first time. It happened while I was sitting in my car, patiently waiting for the traffic light to change, and I suddenly noticed that I couldn't read the street signs with clarity. Following that incident, I scheduled an appointment with a doctor, who confirmed my suspicions and diagnosed me with glaucoma. Unfortunately, since then, my condition has gradually worsened over time.  
  
One night, as I noticed I couldn't read my books without glasses anymore, I started crying in my bedroom, blaming myself  my stupid choices. And then I saw HIM—an elusive tall figure lurking in the shadows, barely perceptible in the corner of my eye. Frantically, I turned my head to get a better look, but he had vanished without a trace.  
  
Initially, I brushed off that experience, considering it insignificant. However, as my vision deteriorated further, an unsettling pattern emerged. The more sight I lost, the more distinct and pervasive THEY became. It seems as though THEY are omnipresent, appearing everywhere I look  
  
Have you seen those pictures of trees that look almost human, like they're about to run away? Some are definitely THEM. Or the houses with doors that seem to have eyes engraved in the woods? THEM too.  
  
The nature of their existence remains uncertain to me. However, one thing is clear: they possess a remarkable ability to shape-shift, assuming various forms to conceal themselves. I have encountered them in parks, libraries, museums, and numerous other locations.. They're everywhere.  
  
Initially, I held the belief that their numbers were limited, but I was wrong. As my vision significantly deteriorated last month, which is why I now have to use a cane, I've seen them more frequently, and more clearly than ever. They vary in shape and size, but most of them have dark skin. It remains uncertain whether they possess the ability to see, as their eyes consistently appear pale or milky white. Their true intentions and objectives remain a mystery to me.  
  
I have realised that whenever one of them is close by, the air feels... heavier. Dangerous even.   
  
I've tried to ignore them, but it's becoming more difficult not to stare. They are beginning to realise that I'm aware of them. One of them got really close last Sunday, started breathing down my neck, making the hair on my back stand. I didn't even dare to move a muscle, decided to keep watching TV, and pretended not to care. It was the hardest two hours of my life, till IT finally decided to leave.  As soon as it vanished, overwhelmed with fear, I broke down, my eyes welling up with tears.  
  
I searched online for ways to defend myself, and have implemented a few. The salt was the first thing I tried and it worked wonders for a while. But in the last month it's becoming less effective, since they are actively trying to get in. As I said before, they are starting to realise I can see them. So, I'm expending lots of money on salt, to make sure I renew my protection daily. I've also hired a wizard online. I know, I know, most of them are a scam. But this guy seems like the real deal. I saw the look of anguish on his face as I walked into his office for the first time.  Five of those creatures were following me then, as I was trying hard to ignore them. He could see them too.   
  
He has been teaching me a lot, and, to some extent, things are a little better. We put some wards in place on my house and on myself, and not so many of them follow me anymore.   
  
However, there's something that makes me really nervous. I went to my doctor today, and they told me my condition is getting worse, and if I keep going on like that, soon I'll be completely blind. I'm scared. I don't know if what I'm doing is enough.  
  
Tonight, I have reached a point of desperation where I am willing to attempt one final spell in hopes of warding them off. Initially, I hesitated to undertake this course of action due to the sacrifice it requires. However, I feel compelled to proceed. I have made the difficult decision to offer one of my eyes as a bargaining chip, hoping that by relinquishing my vision, I will never have to encounter them again.  
  
In the event that my life comes to an end, I implore you to remember this plea. Do not seek them out, for they are ever-present. Simply feign ignorance and go about your life, as if oblivious to their existence, and you should be safe.  
  
Wish me luck
