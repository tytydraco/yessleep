  So.. I almost didn't want to put this out.


  Mainly for the trauma that i endured when this incident took place. I went through a lot of therapy to where I am now. 


  I already told my wife this story and she gave me some heartfelt compassion that all wives do and i know she meant it. Anyway so back in 1995 I was just a teenager at 16 who already had been working at the local Blockbuster in my town for a couple of months.


 Now I know most of the people know what Blockbuster was since their shut down and if you don't well you have the damn internet for Christ's sake.


 Now to make one thing clear back then I really loved Blockbuster. I thought that working there would be the best job ever and it was. It was just that one experience and you know that one saying everyone hears, "One Bad Apple Spoils The Whole Bunch".


 Yeah it did. Spoiled the whole fucking thing.


  To give you an idea what my job was back then at Blockbuster I was one of them movie rewinder's. In the returns I would grab a VHS pop it in the VCR and press the rewind button. That's what I got payed for and loved it. 


 Now one thing I would hate is the way the VHS's were all piled up. Everyone just throws it in the basket like they have somewhere to go in a hurry. 


 I would've liked it if they were stacked like a Jenga tower.


 Anyway so one night(I worked night shift for a couple hours before the next employee came in.) I got the bin and replaced it with another like every night and looked at my next haul with more disapointment. 


  "One day you'll come to me in a nice stack wont you?" I say to it knowing I'm by myself in the back while Fred is at the cashier.


  So I grabbed a random flick and put it in.


 I made a little game to where when I rewind the tape I will press play, pause the scene, and guess the movie. It's pretty fun if you don't watch a lot of them. After a while when there was only four tapes left and I got the recent one right(Terminater!),

I grab another tape and looked at it.


 Then I thought,"shit someone must've threw in one of their home tapes by accident". Cause it was one of those blank VHS tapes with nothing on them but a white strip and it said "Home Movie" on it.


 Then like they always say," Curiosity killed the cat".


 I popped the tape in thinking I would just take a quick peep before handing it over to Fred.


 So I did the rewind, pause, wait a minute, and then pressed play. 


 All I saw was darkness but you can hear a terrified woman breathing and someone walking on top of her. Now when I say on top of her it was like she was laying underneath wood so I guess it was a coffin.


 My first thought was ok maybe this was an actual movie and they just lost the case. But my curiosity kept on bugging me so I sat aside the tape and did the 4 others(Child's Play, Alien 2, Christine, and It.) Then I clocked out for the night.


When I came back the next day I went through the bins as quickly as I could so I can watch the tape.


 Honestly though I'll tell is that this is how it starts. Woman lying in a coffin with dirt coming in every few seconds.


 I skipped for a while and pressed play again this time to her saying,"Please! For they love of god let me out!(sounded like she was crying). Then I skipped a few more like I did the last time and heard someone above her say," you should have never cheated on me!" She then says to him," I don't know you!!".


 For real though, if this was an actual movie and not a home movie, this probably would've broke the box office like Paranormal Activity did cause the woman was displaying the raw human emotion we all know.


 I skipped a few again and pressed play to where you now hear a car driving away and the woman going,"No! No! Noooo!" And a bit more crying. 


 I skipped for what seemed like an hour through the tape and for the last time ever, i pressed the play button.


 What I saw nearly froze my heart to death. It was the woman sounding like she was about to die and then out of the darkness towards her feet, a white hairless like creature with elongated limbs crawls out of the darkness towards her.


  Mine and the woman's breathing sounded alike right then.


  As it came out it opened it's large mouth as wide as it can and you see it breathing in something. I can't hardly even describe it but it was like the thing was breathing in a rainbow like air substance into its mouth coming from the woman.


 The woman during this was just shaking inside the coffin. I skipped through and it seemed the creature was in there with her a lot. Then when it looked like it got done and i pressed play.


 The woman has stopped moving completely. The rainbow like substance the creature was breathing in was also gone. Then it went to go back towards the end of the coffin to the darkness and then it stops.


 It turns and sharply looks at the camera. I almost fell out of my chair. Cause it was staring at me. I really mean AT me. I was scared but then calmed down. I don't know how but it looked like it was telling me to call someone that day.


  So I called the cops.


        * * * * * * * * * * * * *

 After I called the cops they disclosed to me what happened. 

 

 A serial killer has been going around and kidnapping women that resembled his ex - wife. He would then go and bury them alive and what they found with them was a VHS tape. 


 They said So far he was the one sending them the messages to find the bofie's includong a VHS tape of the victims. They Then said he must've accidentally put one of these tapes in the return bin. They said they were sorry for what happened and they will catch the guy.


 The thing that traumatized me wasn't mostly the tape it was the creature. Tge creature the other cops said the didn't even see when they were watching the footage.


 They never did catch him last time i checked.


                * * * * * * * * * * * * 


  Now that I've giving you my story just know this is not over. I think the killer is planning to use ne as his messenger now. Cause FedX dropped off a box at my house and said it was for me.


 When I put it in the house and opened it since the wife is at wotk. What I found made me fall to the floor in fear.


  Inside the boxes were VHS tapes and they all had the words," HOME Movies".
