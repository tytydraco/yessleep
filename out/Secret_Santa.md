I hate Secret Santa because it gives people an excuse to watch you.

They pretend it’s harmless. A bit of fun. But everyone notices who spends too little, who spends too much, who hesitates when they open something, who smiles too late. It turns a room full of professionals into predators measuring weakness.

This year, I drew Amy.

I didn’t know her. Not really. I’d seen her around the office, smiling at the right moments, laughing when it was expected. The kind of person people remembered without ever really knowing why.

That made it worse.

You can’t personalise a gift for someone you don’t understand. You end up projecting. Guessing. Revealing more about yourself than them.

I walked through four shops before I settled on the mug. A stupid cartoon cat and a calendar. Safe. Forgettable. A gift no one would talk about later. That was important.

I wrapped it badly on purpose.

The plan was to arrive early, drop it under the tree, and make sure no one connected it to me. No conversations. No questions. Just observation.

Observation has always come easily.

I arrived before the party started. The office was quiet, half-lit, the decorations already in place. I slid the gift under the tree and retreated to my office to wait.

That’s when I heard them.

Three voices in the corridor.

A man dressed as Santa and two women in elf costumes. Not cheap ones. Properly fitted. Clean. Purposeful.

I wasn’t trying to listen, but something in their tone pulled my attention.

“It has to end at midnight,” Santa said. Not loudly. Firmly.

“If it’s late,” one of the elves replied, “it won’t work.”

The other snapped, irritated, “It will. That’s why we’re here. Everyone who needs to be here already is.”

There was a pause.

Then Santa laughed, sharp and humourless.

“Good,” he said. “I don’t want anyone lingering.”

They moved on, disappearing deeper into the building.

I told myself it was just office theatrics. Management trying something different. But the words stuck with me.

Everyone who needs to be here already is.

The party filled quickly.

Music. Drinks. Forced cheer. As people arrived, Santa or one of the elves handed them a small square envelope. I didn’t get one. I’d arrived too early, and no one noticed.

That suited me fine.

I watched instead.

People drank too much. Laughed too loudly. Stood too close to each other. I noticed how often Amy glanced at the tree. How she smiled whenever Santa looked her way.

At eleven, Santa clapped his hands.

The sound cut through the room unnaturally fast. People gathered around the tree, drawn inward. The elves gently guided them closer, tightening the circle without anyone realising.

The gift exchange began.

Santa rushed people. Pressed them to open things faster. His smile thinned whenever someone stalled. He wasn’t enjoying this part.

I opened my gift without looking at who it was from. A board game. A novelty tie. I set them aside.

Amy stepped forward last.

Santa’s hands trembled as she unwrapped her gift. The mug. The calendar. A ripple of polite applause moved through the room.

“Thank you,” Santa said. Too quickly. “Thank you all.”

He took a breath.

“One last thing,” he added. “A message from the partners.”

He told us to open the envelopes we’d been given.

Three people had an X.

Everyone else had a circle.

Laughter broke out. Nervous at first, then louder. A game. A prize. The elves clapped, ushering the three forward.

Amy was one of them.

Santa handed each of them a small box.

The moment the lids came off, the room changed.

The first shot sounded like a balloon popping.

Then another.

Then another.

Santa fell backward, his smile still frozen on his face. One elf dropped beside him. The other crumpled where she stood.

For a heartbeat, no one moved.

Then Amy knelt.

She leaned down and pressed her mouth to Santa’s throat.

I heard bone crack.

The others followed. Calm. Methodical. Teeth tearing flesh with practiced precision. Blood soaked into the carpet beneath the tree. Someone screamed. Someone else vomited.

I didn’t move.

I wasn’t surprised.

I understood then why Santa had been rushing us. Why midnight mattered. Why the envelopes were marked.

This wasn’t a party.

It was a selection.

The winners finished quickly. Cleanly. When Amy stood, her mouth was red, her expression peaceful.

She looked at me.

Just for a moment.

There was no fear in her eyes.

Only recognition.

I realised then why I’d felt disappointed earlier. Why part of me had been hoping, irrationally, to see an X when I opened my envelope.

I’m patient, though.

There will be another party next year.

There always is.

And eventually, I won’t be watching anymore.
