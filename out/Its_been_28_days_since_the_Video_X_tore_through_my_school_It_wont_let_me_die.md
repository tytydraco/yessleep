So, hello outside world, I guess. 

It's been a month since I last saw a real human being still in control of their morals. 

Who still survives through their own free will, and not someone else's. 

I can't die. 

I mean, I can, but I'm not allowed to die. It won't let me. It won't let me *want* to die. 

All I feel is an insatiable need to survive. It is not mine. But I don't want to talk to you about myself. I want to talk about Nathaniel. I lost my best friend long before the outbreak. Even when we were free from it, I could feel him slipping away from me. The day I lost my mind was a normal Wednesday. It was raining outside, and I had been actually focusing on the video presentation in front of my class– instead of what my best friend was telling me. I had a lot of bad thoughts that day, but I can't remember any of them. I know I took notice of each raindrop sliding down the pane, and the monotonous tick, tick, ticking of the clock on the wall. I'm not going to go into how this thing broke out. 

Maybe it was a freak accident, or I don't know, maybe it was planned. The video presentation was explaining something about stem cells, and I was tap, tap, tapping my pencil on my textbook. I was thinking about a different kind of cell. 

And every time I did, I know that my chest felt like it was expanding, my stomach projecting into my throat, a panic attack brewing. Fuck. If I write this down, I can almost imagine that exact feeling I am not allowed anymore. The feeling of drowning, of being dragged deep, deep down. There was no light and no way out— only the cruel fucking reality being forced upon me. And it was agony. 

Agony is not something I feel anymore. 

This thing blocks it out completely, turning it into hope, and then pleasure. 

There was something in the video. 

That was a straying thought, as I found myself blinking, or trying to blink, through a sudden meme (?) flickering onto the screen. Definitely not what Professor Summer's would normally show us, and his sense of humor was bad dad jokes. It took me a moment to realize this wasn't just a video, and I was suddenly paralysed, body and mind. 

No escape. I tried to part my fingers where they were wrapped around my pencil. I tried to blink, but there was nothing, only a shrill screeching sound cracking into my skull. I can still remember the feeling of it inside my head, phantom bugs crawling into my skull and burrowing into my brain. It was merciless. Endless and inescapable, an invisible monster. Because what if a virus existed not through biological tissue spreading through human saliva– but a powerful video broadcast to the whole school, played on every phone and laptop, every TV screen. It was everywhere. In all of us. 

Video X was perfected and moulded to bring "Generation Z" to its knees.

Every parent's worst nightmare. 

Because what if our grandparents were right and screen's were suddenly deadly to look at? What if a single glance either fried your brain, or twisted you into a being of its own creation? This virus is different. I don't think it's used to us yet. It's still inside us, digging in our heads to bring our useful information. It preys on our darkest desires, what we really want, and twists it, turning it on its head. They wanted to live. They wanted to survive. 

That is human nature. The virus, however, turned that craving to survive into a craving to die, twisting the thought of plunging into the dark, from pain into indescribable pleasure. Everything we wanted and couldn't have, everything we craved, became the opposite. Survival to death. Love into hate. It thrived on our very human nature, on our emotions, or memories-- and what we *wanted* and devoured us whole, hollowing us out. I was infected during the first broadcast. I let that thing creep into my head and contort my thoughts into its own. It made me its puppet that it strings along, whispering to me that *life is so good.*

*Life is worth living.*

*Life is perfect!*

Opposites. 

The smile on my face is rotten from days,  weeks, months, without brushing.

But it still stretches across my lips and hurts my jaw. 

This fucking thing has taken away my ability to want.

I only want what it wants, what my twisted desire is. 

*I want to live.*

*I want to live.*

*I want to fucking LIVE.*

Opposites. 

Nathaniel and I are like magnets. We retract and repel. He pulls away from me, and I bring us back together before he can hurt himself– again. Nathaniel is infected just like me. Yesterday, his right wrist was cuffed to mine, and he pulled me violently, his whole body yanking me down a desolate hallway filled with rotting bodies, crushed skulls, and the reminder of my classmates living out their darkest desires before ripping their own brains from the stem. I stepped on something that made a squelching sound. I wanted to look down at what it was, but the thing inside my head told me to keep going, to keep forcing my body forwards. My classmates painted each wall in scarlet smears, and I struggled to keep up with my lost cause, who I was starting to regret cuffing myself to. 

Nathanial jumped onto a broken window, purposely slicing his palms on glass splinters. I pretended not to see his eyes flicker, lips parting, when blood pooled across his palms. His arms flew out, eyes wide and delirious. He laughed, and I knew I had lost him. Again. There are others like him. 

They stalk the hallways at night looking for prey. The last time I was curious enough to watch them, their eyes lit up the dim, glowing balls of blue dancing through darkness, our school colours blurred into vivid blue and silver, smeared scarlet. I've only seen these kids once in the daylight. They are walking corpses that should be dead, should be being feasted on, not the other way around. But the virus kept them awake, alive, puppets on its strings. The leader, a jock I vaguely recognised, used a half chewed arm to BANG on the lockers, a rhythm only they, the hunters, and us, the prey, understand.  **BANG**. **BANG**. **BANG**. 

A pause, before another teasing: BANG. 

Lunchtime. 

It is our ten second warning to scatter–  but it's not like they listen to their own warning. A boy did not make it back to his hiding place, a broom closet, and they ripped him apart right then and there, laughing hysterically, tearing into his flesh, not to eat, but to skin, so he felt everything. They left his skinned corpse on the hallway, a warning to anyone who wanted to fuck with them. 

I catch the look in Nathaniel's eyes sometimes, nose flaring, lip curling. He wants to join them, and I know he will soon. But I want to keep hold of him for as long as I can. Before he eventually tears front the cuffs that aren't even that tough to get out of, and finally fucking kills me by his own hand. 

It had been fifteen minutes since he tried to force a table leg through his skull. 

Seven and a half minutes since he twisted around and snarled at me, before bursting into uncontrollable laughter that played with the lights. 

And three minutes since he told me to kill him. Begged me.  Maybe it was longer, my sense of time is lost with everything else. Every day, I wonder if his infection saved him. But I push out that thought before I can fully register it and think about it too much. Killing him would mean giving the virus what it wanted. Not what the real Nathaniel wanted. Because Nathaniel wanted to live. 

I swallowed the words in my mouth when he pulled me forward again, and I lost my breath when he got too close to the edge, matted brown curls flying back in the blustery breeze coming from the window. He smiled into thin air, and I knew he wanted to do it. The jerk of his body as he teased each limb. "We talked about this!" I hissed out, pulling him back. He stumbled, and we repelled once more. The metal pipe he had been holding to ward off tribes of infected survivors slipped from his red slicked hands, and I tried not to look at his face under the flickering bulb. It had been a while since he spoke to me in English. 

Now it's just manic giggling, and endless ways he could end it, and how *good* it would feel. He and I would lay together on sleeping bags writhing in bugs and our own blood, in some classroom picked out as our safe place. He would stare at the ceiling, laughing to himself, before detailing his own death in bursts of hysterics that only sent him further and further into the dark. Retracting. 

He told me he could feel it calling to him and daring him to submit to it, to let it envelope him. I told myself not to look at the writhing darkness spiderwebbing across his skin, eyes illuminated a brilliant and haunting blue. 

It is inside mine too. I don't look at my own face often, because I will see the same thing; what is alive and burrowing under my skin and bleeding into my bones. I can see it alive in my face, in veins that are pulsating and hardening under my eyes, my lips skinned and raw from biting them so hard; my pupils are too big and then small, expanding and shrinking as the virus takes a greater hold of me. I can see the thing physically entwined around his iris, a sentient being pushing him further away from me– and closer to that insanity I know he craves. 

I see it in the way his whole body seizes up, fingers curling into a fist, when a stray kid happens to set foot on our corridor– our territory. Nathaniel fights to rip into every kid he comes across, and then himself, revelling in the pain it brings him. While I fight for logic. I fight for my mind, even I don't want to. This thing in my head makes me *want* to live. 

It pushes survival onto me and it's not fair. It is overwhelming and fucking cruel– a life sentence I am forced to crave like a drug. Nathaniel fights for death. Pain. He fights to let go of those desperate pieces of humanity clinging on, and join those freaks lurking in the shadows. I guess I should call them his friends.

"Nate."

That was the last thing I said, before he chewed into his own flesh, forcing off the cuffs, and stumbling into the dark, his manic and not-there laugh joining theirs. 

I'm still waiting for him to come back. 

His diagnosis wasn't the worst thing that happened to him. 

Instead, it was what he told me when we were both normal seniors getting ready to graduate. He smiled at me with watery eyes. "I'll fight it," he said. "I want to live."

Knowing it was stage 4 Glioblastoma, I started wanting to fucking die. 

This virus could not have hit at a worse time.
