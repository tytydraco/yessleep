I was about twelve years old when I first took notice of my ‘condition’. I had lived in the middle of Philadelphia all my life up until that point, and I had no reason to consider the night sky nor could I if I wanted to for the ever-present light pollution bombarding my light receptors. That is, until I met my lifelong friend, Jared. About three weeks after my twelfth birthday in March of 2009, my father got a job with the National Forestry Service, which transferred my family across the country to a very small town just south of Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming.

 The move wasn’t nearly as hard on me as some might expect from a kid of that age. Honestly, I hated Philadelphia. Where we lived, I seemingly could never get a wink of sleep due to the constant traffic, which made school days miserable for me. In fact, I was probably the happiest I had ever been the week my mom and dad announced the move.  

By the beginning of Summer break, we had officially moved into our small, ranch-style house among the small community of about ten other houses called Shuever, Wyoming. That first day when we drove from the airport in Denver to the town, I had serious jet lag and slept most of the time. But when my mother finally eased me back to consciousness upon our arrival, my head spun at the vastness of the sight before me. I had never seen such an expanse of open land in my life, a land mute, deaf, and blind to the man-made jungle spread across the rest of the planet. It was perfect. More so than I could have known. 

   That same day Mrs. Wilkins, who lived next door, invited us over for lasagna, which made my stomach cramp after the ten straight hours of moving boxes, and we all gladly accepted and essentially left immediately. The Wilkins’ house was quite a bit like ours, and the rest of the community for that matter: a small rancher built from dark brown brick and gray-blue metal roofing. We were all greeted by her husband, who led us across the house, down the central hallway, and to the right where there stood a modest table prepared with a from-frozen lasagna, various sodas, and butter-garlic breadsticks. And already seated at the table was the Wilkins’ only child. The one who I would come to know as Jared. He was about two years younger than me and spent most of the time with his head down, trying to keep from drawing any attention to himself. 

Honestly, not much happened at that table. The Wilkins were all noticeably quiet for most of the time. Not awkwardly so, but they were just not quite as outgoing as many of my friends from Philadelphia. It was a nice change of pace. After about half an hour, Mrs. Wilkins finally spoke up, “Jared, why don’t you show Tyler to your room? Maybe you can show him your telescopes!” Jared grinned meekly and motioned for me to follow him back down the hallway where his room was. At the end of the hallway to the left was an off-white painted door with a faded bronze knob that was not unlike many of the doors from my old school which had not been renovated since the eighties.

With some force, Jared opened the door and I was bombarded with vibrant shades of blue and white. His walls were covered with posters and signage from long-accomplished missions from NASA. There were at least two Apollo posters, and several others for Mercury, Gemini, and the shuttle programs. Diagonally across the room from his bed was an admittedly impressive display of five telescopes, ranging from two to ten inches in diameter. After taking a pause to fully appreciate what I was seeing, Jared spoke up for the first time, “So…uh…yeah. These are my telescopes…” He trailed off, naming models and numbers that meant nothing to me. I had never cared to know about space, but hearing the crescendo of passion in his voice actually began to pique my interest. “So…I’m guessing you go stargazing out here a lot?” I asked. He responded, “Yeah, at least once or sometimes twice a week depending on the weather. I try to keep track of relatively close objects to see if I can determine their paths. I have schoolwork to do tonight, but you can go out with me and my dad tomorrow night to see for yourself!” “Uh…yeah! Sure!” I replied, this was probably going to be my only friend for a long while, so I wasn’t going to pass up his offer. “We can meet at my house tomorrow night at 8:00 if that’s okay with you.” 

   “I’ll ask mom, but I should be able to do that.” I responded, somewhat off put by his sudden preparedness. I spent the rest of the evening listening to Jared Wilkins ramble on about his now very apparent hyper fixation, squeezing in the occasional question or passing comment. By the time I had been in his room for two hours straight, I started to regret my decision of taking up his offer to go stargazing, but ultimately decided it was for the best. By 9:00 that evening, my mother called me back to the other side of the house to thank our hosts for the meal and make plans for the next night’s excursion, which my parents both wholeheartedly agreed to, seeing my need for a friend in this new and quite empty place. 


The next day was somewhat of a blur. More unpacking and organizing interspersed with quick breaks to eat. We all tried to keep our food consumption to a minimum, considering the nearest town with supplies was an hour-drive away, but my parents assured me that they would get more food once we were all unpacked. Before I knew it, it was time to go next door. I had expected that they would just take the telescopes to their backyard and watch from there, but instead, they had a Kawasaki Mule loaded down with all our viewing equipment, cameras, and sleeping bags. 

Jared explained that they were planning to go to a place called Reiner’s Point where there was no light pollution whatsoever and that they were planning on spending the night there to see planets that only appear in the early morning hours. I still agreed and we made the ten mile drive across the mostly empty land which was flat at first, but swiftly began to incline when we entered a sudden band of fragrant pine trees. From there, we drove for two more especially grueling miles heading nearly straight up over boulders and downed trees, which ended up taking longer than the previous eight miles, and by the time we reached the plateau above, the sun was almost fully sunken. 

   Reiner’s Point, it turned out, was a corner roughly situated on the southwestern edge of the plateau that was slightly higher than the surrounding land. It appeared slightly burnt and smelled of old charcoal where they had camped many times before. Of course, they weren’t planning on starting another fire tonight, though. We busied ourselves setting up the telescopes, and I mainly just helped out by holding parts for the other two who obviously knew what they were doing. All the while, Jared and his father were making comments about objects that were becoming visible as the sky darkened and how they had moved positions throughout the year. Jared then tugged at my shirt and pointed roughly northeast, “You see? There’s Capella, about 40 degrees off from Polaris. Using that, we can find the Andromeda Galaxy through the telescope. Isn’t it awesome! Bet you never saw anything like this back in Pennsylvania.” I looked almost directly up to where he was pointing and squinted and shook my head and rapidly blinked. For some reason, I couldn’t see anything. 

I thought that maybe my eyes hadn’t adjusted yet, or that somehow my eyes had been ruined by my lifetime of near constant light pollution. “I…I don’t see it.” I said hesitantly, trying not to sound stupid. Jared continued to point vigorously, “It’s right there. The brightest star in this direction…don’t you see?” “I…don’t see anything up there…it’s just black.” I said, and immediately Mr. Wilkins stopped what he was doing, adjusting the telescopes to the correct focus, and seemed to contemplate something, then glanced over at Jared, who’s eyes had seemed to freeze over for a few seconds. There was an awkward pause for another 30 seconds or so before Mr. Wilkins finally spoke up. “Do…you wear glasses, son?” 

“No, I’ve never worn glasses in my life. I’ve always read fine and never had problems with seeing far away things.”  I said, concluding that I should probably ask my parents to go see an eye doctor, if there was one to be found within 100 miles, if I couldn’t even see the stars. I don’t know…maybe the sudden onset of symptoms could indicate something more serious? Maybe I injured myself at some point during the move? As if to respond to my very thoughts, Mr. Wilkins spoke up again somewhat coldly, “There’s an eye doctor over in Casper. You should see if your parents can take you there. His practice is on the end of Grant Street, should be easy enough to find from there.” 

I was admittedly confused by his imperative attitude when he said that. I could see just fine…at least, for the most part. It wasn’t that serious. I just continued squinting into the ink-blackness, desperately trying to make out anything. Eventually, I think I counted about two discernible points of light with maybe three others, although I was much less sure if they were actually there. I pointed to the two points I saw, “Actually…I think I can see two stars now, one right above us and one over to the north.” Jared explained, “Those two actually aren’t stars. That one right above us is Saturn…that one over there is Jupiter. That’s really all you can see?” I replied, my face turning more red, defying the cool fall air, “Yeah, there may be some others, but as soon as I try to focus on them, they disappear.” 

“It actually kind of makes sense…” Jared continued to explain, “It’s a new moon tonight, and Jupiter and Saturn should be the brightest points you can see out here. It’s like my dad said, you could really use some glasses.” Again, his voice trailed off into a strange intonation when he mentioned ‘glasses’, which made me feel uncomfortable, but I just brushed it off because I just simply didn’t know what to make of it. As we spoke, his dad was quickly pointing the 8-inch telescope toward Saturn, “Look here through the eyepiece. Tell me what you see.” I stepped up on the flat rock where the large telescope was positioned. 

When I looked through the telescope, I saw exactly what I expected to see…Saturn. It was exactly as I had seen in pictures before, a plain sphere with a ring around its circumference. It felt different, though…seeing it firsthand, only aided by a few layers of glass and mirrors. “Wow…it looks amazing…even better than the pictures!” “So…you can see it?” Mr. Wilkins continued to interrogate. I think I was starting to visibly tense up and back away at this point. I was just desperately confused by his reactions thus far. “Um…yeah?” I said shakily. 

   Mr. Wilkins sighed and turned back to normal, looking through each telescope intently and recording something in his journal which it took me until now to notice. What’s it to him if I can see Saturn or not? It’s probably like he said: I probably just have mild farsightedness that I’ve never noticed until now. I appreciated the concern, but the degree of his concern felt…unwarranted, I guess. Jared led me to his six-inch diameter telescope which he intently dialed and turned toward the other clear point that I could see, which was even brighter than Saturn. “Look…” he began suddenly, “…here’s Jupiter! You can see the storm real clearly tonight.” I didn’t know what exactly he meant by ‘storm’, so I naturally became more intrigued by whatever it was that was glowing inside the eyepiece. 

“Oh yeah…the red spot. I…never realized that was a storm” I said in restrained awe.“Oh…so that big red spot is a storm?” I inquired genuinely intrigued and temporarily forgot the strangeness of the situation. “Yeah! It’s been going for a few centuries now! And it probably won’t stop for another several hundred years!” Jared responded enthusiastically, trailing off again into a rant about the chemical compositions of Jupiter and the storms there, which I couldn’t hope to understand, but my eyes still widened and my skin still got chills. I thought at that moment that I had found my new fixation. 

For the next several hours, we scoured the sky, exhausting every point I could see. He kept telling me about the Milky Way which, although I knew I had seen before in pictures, was not visible to me now. “That doesn’t make any sense…” Jared continued, thoroughly baffled , “…it’s almost just as bright in the sky as Jupiter and Saturn out here, you should—“ “Jared!” His father shouted. “Enough of that! I’m sure Mr and Mrs Joles will take him to the eye doctor as soon as they head back to town. Let’s not bother him about it anymore, alright?” Mr. Wilkins’ voice was first firm and commanding, but increasingly became anxious and concerned. Jared meekly lowered his head and didn’t speak again for a few awkward minutes.

Mr. Wilkins then abruptly left the telescopes he had spent the past 30 minutes tuning to prepare our tents and sleeping bags. All the while, Jared continued to point out stars and constellations that, while I couldn’t see them, I nodded in agreement to satiate his father’s shrouded worry that I couldn’t quite place the source of. In fact, after a few more minutes, I had subconsciously committed to the role, taking out my phone as if to take a picture of the night sky. What was I thinking? I wasn’t going to see anything…but what if…? I tapped the camera icon on my phone and pointed it at the sky and, of course, nothing. “Oh…to capture a photo with your phone, you need to turn up the exposure to capture the light…” and Jared continued on as per usual. He tapped some more buttons on my camera app that otherwise would have laid dormant for all time, and then he instructed me to tap the picture button and stand very still. 

After about 10 seconds, the resulting picture appeared in my photo reel. And there it was! Just like I had seen in pictures before…the Milky Way Galaxy, shrouded in the familiar void and crowned by innumerable, obsolete stars. “I-I can see it!” I proclaimed in awe of what I was seeing. “That actually makes sense…” Jared explained, “if you are farsighted, the exposure-“ 

Mr. Wilkins’ face appeared in the entrance of one of the two tents set about 50 feet from the telescopes. His eyes pierced like a thousand needles into Jared’s and, for the first time since I had met him, he started crying, softly at first, but quickly becoming a bawl of torment. Hopelessly confused, I tried consoling him, but his strange panic began to rub off on me, “It’s really not a big deal at all…I’m sorry…I-I won’t bring it up again…I promise…Jared, you’re scaring me, stop!” 

“Jared...I think it’s time for you to get to bed.” Mr. Wilkins stated calmly, beckoning for him to enter the tent where he was.” It was early Summer, and Jared was visibly shaking as he walked slowly toward the tent. As he entered, he shot a glance at me that I can only describe as the look a dog gives when being made to enter a cage. Mr. Wilkins then turned to me after Jared entered the tent and said, “And Owen, the other tent is all yours. Jared will be staying with me tonight, and I apologize on his behalf for any…discomfort he may have caused you.” “N-no, really, it's nothing. It doesn’t bother me at all, but I’ll be sure to tell my parents about the eye doctor.” Mr. Wilkins quietly sighed in response and closed the tent.

An odd distance from their tent was mine, which looked exactly like the other, made of a dark black material which I assumed was to retain heat during the winter. When I opened the zipper to enter the tent, I noticed that there was something small in the middle of the tent in a bag with a folded sheet of paper on top. I crawled inside and read something neatly written on the visible side of the paper: ‘For your cough  -Thomas’ and inside the bag was a bottle of NyQuill, just enough for one dose. I laid down and took the syrup, then swiftly fell asleep. That night, as I had been accustomed to for several years, I awoke to a fit of sleep paralysis. I remember the first time I had sleep paralysis when I was ten and, when I told my mom about the experience, the explanation was obvious as it sounded much like other accounts: complete loss of physical control except for breathing and blinking, followed by the appearance of the ‘Visitor’ as I had come to call it, which I have come to find other people call a ‘sleep paralysis demon’.

It was all the same…at first, that is. I laid on the thin cushioning of the sleeping bag face-up without any control of my limbs for several minutes. Usually, it was only for several seconds. I had become accustomed to the phenomenon and had mastered remaining calm during these bouts. But now, I was beginning to panic much like I did the first time I ever experienced this. It felt…different, and I was starting to wonder if I had somehow broken my spine and permanently lost voluntary control of my body. 

But I knew panic could not help, so I laid there immobile, waiting for the sunrise and for Jared and Thomas to find me here. I counted about an hour, but the sunrise was still far off, and at that point, I saw the familiar form of the Visitor. A vague, black silhouette crouched above my paralyzed body. Usually, it would just stand there for a few seconds before I would wake and regain full control. However, this time, he reached down and touched my eyelids, spreading them open. Then, I saw a blinding flash and when I regained my sight, it was still there. Then came another flash quickly followed by more and, upon the third, or perhaps fourth flash, I was laying face-down in my bed at the new house.

Had I dreamed the whole scenario? That was the first thought that went through my head. Honestly, it sounded to me like something I would dream up. I would have just left it at that if it were not for the distinct, medicinal taste of the NyQuill in my mouth. Then came the next thought: my sleep paralysis last night…it was different somehow. Now that I had regained full cognition, I realized that the Visitor wasn’t the same. It was taller and more refined than it had been previously…and it had hands! It had never shown its hands before. Then, I led myself to the third and final thought: what had Thomas Wilkins given me last night? 

And before I had time to begin panicking, I heard the first faint wails of sirens. There were police heading up the county road. When I headed to the roadside window to get a better look, I encountered my parents in the living room. They were both staring blankly into the open room surrounded by boxes. When my mother took notice of me she lifted her head and gave a weak smile, “Hey, Owen…how are you feeling?” “I…feel fine, but- what? Wha-“ “We don’t know, not completely. Jared…he carried you back home on the ATV. We think his father had a mental break…the police are out there searching for him.” Mom began tearing up as she spoke, and her quiet sobs were covered up by the sound of approaching sirens. 

At this point, I looked out the window and noticed two cop cars already at the end of the street and combing the open wilderness for any trace of Mr. Wilkins. According to later reports, they searched on and around the path all the way up to Reiner’s Point. No sign of his whereabouts were discovered there. Over the next several days, law enforcement used aerial surveillance to search the surrounding 20 square miles. On the fourth day of searching, they found the rock ledge where Thomas was hiding under. He was found desperately carving lenses out of the bases of glass bottles and tying them together with twigs. 

When he was brought into custody, he practically admitted to everything. He had brought me out to the desert with the intention of feeding me NyQuill laced with a large dose of Diazepam to render me unconscious for reasons that he never stated under custody, but under further interrogation, he went on record to state, “I needed to look at his eyes.” That’s the only motive he ever gave. Three weeks after that night we went stargazing, Mr. Thomas Wilkins had been prosecuted on the grounds of child endangerment and was sentenced to 3 years in prison and 90 days of psychological rehabilitation. 

All the while, I had not forgotten about the family next door. They were victims as much as I was, and almost certainly more so. I mean, they lived with the guy! Who knows what kinds of sickening things he did that were not related to my case? My parents and I decided, after a grueling month of legal troubles, to visit the Wilkins’ home once more. This time, we brought the food: a tin of baked spaghetti. The whole time there was extremely tense. Not many words were spoken, but Jared and Mrs. Wilkins were clearly thankful for the food. After several minutes, Jared excused himself from the table, walking slowly back to his room on the other side of the house. My dad also excused himself and beckoned for me to step outside with him. I followed and he put his hand on my shoulder and said, “You better go and thank him, son. He probably saved your life that day. Okay?” 

“Alright” I responded. I really just didn’t want to make Jared more uncomfortable than he already was. He let me back inside and pointed me back to his room. The door to his room was closed, so I knocked and let myself in a few moments later. “Hey…I, uh, I just wanted to thank you…for…you know, back then.” Jared didn’t respond immediately. But after a few awkward moments, he lifted his head up to me and whispered shakily, “Owen…you're not farsighted. You have Prophet’s Syndrome.”
