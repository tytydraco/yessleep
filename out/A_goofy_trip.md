The sun was slowly sinking behind the tree line in the distance, disappearing behind the horizon and covering the forest in a dark blanket. I had parked my car on the small concrete slab next to the area’s informational sign, which read ‘’Spoonersville National Park’’. Now I was hiking across the small heath separating me from the dark, tall pines. After about half an hour of walking I found a clearing that looked spacious enough for a tent and a firepit. By the time the last of the sun’s rays had disappeared from the woods I was sitting by the fire in front of my tent. The wind was slowly blowing through the dark, tall trees around me. It almost sounded like the whole forest was whispering, yet somehow I did not find it spooky, but weirdly calming.

I had been a part of the boy scouts for most of my childhood, which introduced me to the likes of sleeping in tents, gathering wood and cooking on open fire. Once I was 18 years of age, there were no more groups for me to join, so I had been offered to become one of the troop leaders, passing my knowledge on to the new generations and all that, but college life had me too busy, so I had to decline. I did miss being out in nature though, and that’s why I decided to make it a little tradition to go out on trips like the one I was on now every year. It wasn’t a cold night per say, but the fire kept the chilly air away, so I stood up and grabbed my flashlight to go find some more wood for my fire. It only took me a minute to find a nice, small pine log. I let my hand run over the exposed core of the log to check if it was dry, but the second I reached down, I heard something fly right over my back and hit a tree behind me. I shot back up and looked behind me, now I was no stranger to bats or owls, but them flying this close? Had I set up near a nesting ground? Surely not, since a bird would’ve surely hooted, screeched or cawed me away long before I would’ve gotten even close to it’s eggs. Scanning the forest behind me only revealed a really big, brown shoe with a hole in the bottom, it must’ve been at least size 18’ and a half, stuck to one of the trees. It was probably left there by another camper to mark something, although I hadn’t noticed it when I was putting my tent up.

With no sign of the flying assailant, I grabbed a couple more small logs and branches to pile up on the orange autumn needles on the forest floor. Although these trips usually took place in the summer, I had been working extensively this year to save up for a car, so I could finally travel longer distances without relying on public transport. This did mean however that I had to move my trip to a random weekend, somewhere in October. This didn’t really bother me, since apart from the shorter days and rainier weather, the temperature was pretty similar. After I got tired of staring at the dancing flames turning into still embers, it was time to kick some sand on the charred logs and to crawl into my sleeping bag.

I was well on my way to some sweet dreams, when I was awakened by the beeping of my watch. Beep-beep..beep-beep..beep beep’ ‘Oktober 13^(th)‘ it read, ‘Hallows Eve’. Stupid default alarms. I pressed mute and rolled over again. I’ll have to update it and turn those Holliday notifications off when I get back home. Maybe two or three hours later I was rudely awoken by another alarm. I checked my watch, but it’s screen was grey and dull. I listened closely and heard it again. It wasn’t a beeping alarm but more of a, a giggle? No a cry or a call. It sounded like a sob… but animalistic. A… hyuck, yes that seemed the closed, like the sound someone makes in an old cartoon when they see Brussel sprouts or cabbage. Hyuck…Hyuck…Hyuck three cries and the forest went silent again. Even though it was sad it gave me chills. Was it a stray wolf, a coyote even? Did they even live this far north? After a couple minutes, that seemed like an eternity, the cries seemed to stop. I crawled over to the zipper of my tent, slowly peered through the teeth and pointed my flashlight outward. Slowly I scanned the trees around me, In the direction the sound seemed to come from. Except for a few birds, there where no signs of life anywhere, until I looked beneath me.

There, on the orange needles a small, weathered toy laid next to my tent. It seemed to resemble a mouse, I think. It was a soft, fabric covered black ball, with two round discs resembling ears. On the bottom a black flexible tube had been attached, connected to a small yellow shoe. This definitely had not been here before, did it fall from a tree, did the wind blow it here, did someone from college follow me to play a prank on me? Picking the toy up and turning it around revealed a small wind up gear, with a badly scribbled note that read ‘’Twist me’’ stitched above it. I half expected the thing to just play an hour loop of  ‘never gonna give you up’ or that annoying bird laughing, but when I released the gear I couldn’t place the tune at first. It took me a couple of seconds but when I heard an extremely distorted ‘’Hot Dog’’ I realized what it was.

It was one thing for someone to go out of their way to secretly follow me and drop a weird recording toy in front of my tent, but to add a distorted version of the mickey mouse clubhouse theme? Even that went to far for my friends. Although maybe Tom would go far enough, but he would be competing in his row boating tournament halfway across the world by now. Did he make that up? No. And besides, the distorted audio loop didn’t sound faked. It genuinely sounded like it was once a vibrant and happy tune that had been played and worn over time to the point where it had gotten creepy. Much more time to ponder on the how’s and why’s was not given to me, for as soon as the crooked ‘music box’ stopped playing, I heard something scurrying behind my tent. Followed by a Hyuck..Hyuck.

It didn’t take me a second to decide what to do. My fight or flight response kicked in. And I chose Flight. Quite literally, as I nearly flew through the trees. I must’ve sprinted the full 30 minute walk to the heath in five minutes max. Usually I would get winded after a minute or two, but I had only one thought on my mind. RUN. Once I was out of the woods, I shined my flashlight behind me and glanced over my shoulder. There was no sign of whatever was making that noise yet. But I could *feel* something behind me in the forest. I practically jumped to my car when I reached the concrete. I looked around. Nothing. I breathed a sigh of relief and reached into my pocket. At that moment my head showed me attaching my car keys to a ring on my backpack, which I had left in the tent, before crossing the heath. My hand, of course, grabbed nothing as my keys weren’t there.

I took some deep breaths, manned up and made myself big. As long as I shine my flashlight in it’s eyes, appear big, scary and don’t get too close, an animal should keep it’s distance. I took a couple of paces out from my car, back onto the heath, all the while talking myself up. ‘It’s just an animal, I’ll get my keys and sleep in the car, I just overreacted. It probably found the toy somewhere and decided to carry it around and simple dropped it when sniffing around my campsite. Yeah. It’s probably just a dog who got left and that toy is it’s only plaything.’ But when I turned around halfway across the heath to look at my car, I saw no dog.

The heath wasn’t a long stretch of land, maybe about half a football field. At least enough as to be able to see what was standing on top of my old car, illuminated by the moonlight. I stopped breathing. A tall ‘man’ stood on the roof of my car. His head was painted black, but his face had a weird light beige color, making it look like a flat snout. His ears were elongated and thin, like that of a dingo. His chest was fully painted orange and he only wore a filthy, black, opened sleeveless jacket. He wore short jeans and had his lower legs painted in a similar blue. Beneath it were huge, brown size 18 shoes, which his black toes stuck through the noses of. I wanted to freeze, to close my eyes and forget this, this monstrosity, but I was much more afraid of it’s intentions, then of it’s looks. And so I spun myself around, running back towards the forest, and before I entered, I glanced over my shoulder, needing to know I that ‘thing’ was chasing me. It was. With big, freakish passes was it quickly closing the distance between us. I swung my head back in the direction I was going and… Too late. I had realized too late that there was a tree in front of me, and so a second after looking in front of me, I collided with it and even the moon went dark.

When I came to my senses, every bone in my body ached and my skin itched, like I was wearing a terrible grandmother’s sweater all over. But I would’ve taken an itchy sweater over this any day. Because I was wearing some sort of pale, decrepit yellow suit. It was a completely yellow sweater, pants and two pairs of socks, one on my feet and one on my hands. They were all stitched together and incredibly tight. Around my neck there was a thick metal collar, which in turn was chained to a tree nearby. So escape was no option. I looked around me. Between the trees a giant fabric ‘roof’ had been fashioned from at last twenty or so sown together tents. On the edge I could see what had, until recently, been my tent. There was a fire going beneath the middle of the tents, where a hole had been cut for the smoke. On it was a big kettle, with steam rising out of it. In the corner there lay a pile of backpacks. Where these from other people? Where are they? Before I could walk around a bit more, I heard Hyuck Hyuck, getting louder and louder.

 

The thing was even scarier in the daylight. It had a large black hole for a nose and two demonic, purely black eyes. It’s mouth looked like it had been pulled outward, and contained only 2, stained yellowed teeth. It’s earlobes had clearly been pulled out into long, thin strips and it’s clothes seemed even more foul then before. They had dark, brown and red stains on them. The next few days of my life were a living hell. The thing would feed me the stew in the cauldron, putting a small wooden bowl of it within the reach of my chain. The broth was dark and thick. It never seemed to sleep and rarely stalked around it’s camp. When it did, it was only to feed me or to hide behind trees and *watch me*. At night, it would force me to play the distorted tune from the toy. The melody haunted my dreams, and the monster my waking moments. But whenever my tormentor wasn’t mentally scarring me, I checked around the camp. I could see into the big cauldron, and the amount of mystery soup in it seemed do slowly decrease by the day. He never touched the bags, but I could in no way reach them.

Six days. After six days I found some hope. The thing had left a tent pin in one of the ‘roof’ pieces. Whenever I could I threw pinecones up. Some would hit. Most would miss. It took a couple hits, but eventually the thin metal pin came down. I pondered what to do with it, stab the thing? Pry open my chains? I grabbed the pointy end and started breaking away the fibers of the tree my chain was attached to. The tree was pretty thick, and the haunting presence of the beast made it no easier. I covered my progress with bark and hid the tool in the forest ground. Slowly but surely was I getting through the tree. I knew once I were to reach halfway through the trunk, I might be able to puch it over, then I’d only have to cut through whatever tendons of fiber were left holding the tree together. For three more days I had to carefully chip away the tree, splinters at a time. Making sure the tree was getting as weak as possible, without it falling over.

I woke up on a misty morning. The sun still hung low on the horizon, and the woods were slowly awakening. There was no sign of ‘it’. This was my moment. I pushed the tree over and quickly tried softening it’s fall on the other side. When it hit the ground with a thud, I took a minute to listen. Surely It wouldn’t come investigate a falling tree. When the forest remained quiet, I rushed over to the backpacks. They were all nearly empty, apart from a pocket knife, a compass and a plastic bottle. I took them and rushed over to the cauldron to have at least some hydration with me. But as I got close to the fire pit for the first time, I dropped my yaw in horror. There were no stones surrounding the burnt wood. What I thought had been round stones, was actually a perfectly arranged circle of human skulls. I slowly approached the cauldron and saw it was nearly empty. Nearly. Lining the bottom of the iron pot, there were a ridiculous amount of small, broken and splintered human bones. I knew for sure because some finger bones still had rings on them. I had found the owners of all those tents.

 

There was not a single bone in my own body that didn’t want to drop to the floor and start weeping. But I couldn’t. I had to get out, *now*. The plastic bottle fell to the floor as I bolted away into the trees. I had to get at least as far away as possible. After five minutes I started walking at a slower pace. Safety was who knows how far away and I still had to make it there. I tried to stick to heading south, as most big cities close to my original camping ground were in that direction. I figured the beast wouldn’t have taken me far, or hoped at least. Right before the night befell the forest, I felt tears in my eyes. There were lights in the distance! Not fire, nor stars, no. Electrical lights, Homes, a town, safety. I closed on in on the buildings and knocked on the first door I saw a light behind. A kind, elderly lady let me in and helped me call emergency services.

And now, after many months of therapy sessions, mental help and meds, I’ve finally been able to sleep again. My therapist told me I should try to tell my story to a broader audience, that it would help show that the delusions from being alone in the wild for so long where no more than that. It would help me realizing that I simply had a breakdown on a camping trip an ran off into the woods. For now I will need to get my life back together. I had lost my collage apartment and my belongings had been thrown out due to my absence. The police could find no evidence of a place called Spoonersville national park, it seemed to have disappeared along with my car. So now I live in a small home for the mental help. But they are going to help me get a place somewhere soon they said. Someone brought me a gift last night. A sturdy black ball, with two soft mouse ears, and a tail with a boot on it. It play a cheery tune when you twist a gear on the back of it. I think I will go shopping tomorrow, maybe I’ll get one of those warm, black sleeveless jackets. Hyuck!
