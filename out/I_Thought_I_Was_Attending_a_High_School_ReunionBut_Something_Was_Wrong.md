The old school building hadn’t changed much in the ten years since we graduated. The paint was peeling, and the once-bright lockers were now a dull gray, but the memories came flooding back as soon as I walked through the doors. The reunion was supposed to be a celebration, a chance to reconnect with old friends, but something felt off the moment I stepped inside.

The hallways were dimly lit, the fluorescent lights flickering overhead. I found myself drawn to our old homeroom, the place where we’d all spent countless hours together. The door creaked as I pushed it open, and I was greeted by a wave of nostalgia.

The desks were still arranged in neat rows, just as they had been all those years ago. But when I looked closer, I noticed something strange—names carved into the wood, names that shouldn’t have been there. My name, and the names of my closest friends, etched deep into the surface, as if they’d been there for decades.

A chill ran down my spine as I ran my fingers over the carvings. There was a date next to them: today’s date—August 20, 2024.

"Well, someone came here early and did some decorating..." I thought to myself jokingly.

“Hey, you made it!” A voice called from behind me, making me jump.

I turned to see David, my best friend from high school, grinning at me. He looked exactly the same—same messy hair, same easy smile. But there was something in his eyes, something cold.

“Yeah, couldn’t miss it for the world” I replied, forcing a smile. “Crazy seeing this place again, huh?”

He nodded, his grin never wavering. “Brings back memories, doesn’t it?”

I nodded, but the unease was growing. “Where is everyone else?”

“They’re coming,” David said, his tone too casual. “They’ll be here soon.”

I tried to make small talk, but the room felt colder, the shadows growing longer with each passing second. I glanced at the clock on the wall, but the hands weren’t moving. They were stuck at 3:15—the exact time our last class had ended on the day we graduated.

A sharp pain spiked through my temples, and suddenly, the memories didn’t just rush back—they slammed into me, vivid and terrifying. We were celebrating the end of senior year, our last night together. Someone had suggested we explore the old, unused wing of the school—a thrill-seeking adventure before we all parted ways.

The old science lab was filled with forgotten equipment, ancient textbooks, and yellowed papers. Someone, maybe it was David, found a box of old chemicals. We thought it would be funny to mix them, just to see what happened. We were too caught up in the excitement to think about the consequences.

The explosion was instant, violent—a blast of fire and smoke that swallowed the room whole. The old wooden beams above us caught fire almost immediately.

We tried to run, but the heat was unbearable, the flames spreading faster than we could move. One by one, my friends fell behind, choking on the smoke, tripping over debris. I can still hear their screams, see the terror in their eyes as they realized they couldn’t escape.

In my panic, I found a way out—a broken window at the far end of the corridor. I didn’t look back. I didn’t stop to help them. I just ran, stumbling through the shattered glass, the fire at my heels.

The building burned to the ground that night, and we never spoke of it again. We told everyone it was an accident, a tragic mistake. But deep down, we knew the truth—we’d left them to die.

“I didn’t—” I started, guilt choking my words, but David cut me off.

"We didn’t make it out either, don’t you get it?” His voice rose, his eyes wide with a mix of desperation and fury. “We died with them that night. We’ve been stuck here, in this moment, waiting for you. Waiting for the last one to remember.”

I stared at him, the realization hitting me like a punch to the gut. The memories were clear now—the flames, the smoke, the suffocating heat as we struggled to escape. But we hadn’t escaped. We had died with the others, and this reunion wasn’t a celebration. It was our prison.

The door slammed shut behind me, the lights flickering violently. I could hear voices now, distant at first, but growing louder, echoing through the halls. Our classmates—the ones who had perished in the fire—were coming. They were coming for me.

“No,” I whispered, backing away, but David’s grip on my arm tightened.

“There’s no running this time,” he said, his voice cold and final. “We’re all in this together.” He sang mockingly in an eerie, high-pitched tone that mimicked the old High School Musical lyrics, fashioning a sinister smile as he does it.

The walls began to close in, the flames from that night roaring back to life, licking at the edges of the room. The clock on the wall started ticking backward, faster and faster.

My friends, their faces twisted in pain, their clothes scorched, skin blackened and peeling, entered the room. They reached for me, their hands burning hot as they pulled me into the inferno. I scream in terror, genuinely in fear of the visual of burnt corpses wailing and getting their charred hands all over me. It felt like more coal than flesh, I—I felt sorry. Sorry for not remembering, sorry for keeping us in this hell. I closed my eyes, I've accepted my fate.

Then...silence.

When I opened my eyes again, I was standing in front of the desk, my fingers tracing the familiar carvings on its surface. What the hell just happened? Had I been reading too much horror content on Something Awful and 4chan’s /x/ board? Or were the new pills I’d been prescribed, for my anxiety, contributing to my brain's inevitable deterioration?

As I continued to run my finger on the carving, my body suddenly ran cold as I realized what was etched on the wooden desk—August 20, 2024.

“Hey, you made it!”
