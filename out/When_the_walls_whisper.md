I don’t really know how to start this.

  I guess I should introduce myself first. My name is Ezra, I’m 27, and I work as an overnight security guard at an office building. It’s not exactly a dream job, but it pays my bills, and I don’t have to talk to people much. Most nights, I sit in a booth, watching security monitors cycle through dimly lit hallways and empty conference rooms. There’s a rhythm to it—check the screens, drink some gas station coffee, count down the hours until my shift ends.

I’ve always liked working nights. The quiet. The stillness.

But lately, the quiet doesn’t feel empty anymore.

  It started small. I’d catch movement in the corner of my eye—just a flicker on the monitor, like someone had passed through the frame an instant before I looked. A shadow in the breakroom. A shape at the edge of the stairwell. At first, I brushed it off. It’s easy to see things that aren’t really there when you’re running on bad coffee and two hours of sleep.

But then, things started happening at home, too. 

  At first, it was just the little things—the feeling of being watched when I turned my back, the prickle of unease crawling up my spine in my own apartment. The TV would switch channels on its own, always to static, even though I never left the remote anywhere near me. I’d wake up to find my bedroom door open when I was sure I’d closed it. Once, I came home and found every cabinet in my kitchen wide open, doors gaping like silent mouths. I told myself I must have left them that way. That I’d been careless.

Then, one night, I heard whispering.

  I live alone, and my upstairs neighbor works the early shift—by the time I get home, his apartment is dead silent. But as I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, I heard it. Soft, almost like breathing. A voice, just on the edge of understanding, murmuring from the dark corner of my room. I held my breath, trying to convince myself I was imagining it.

Then it said my name.

  A low whisper, stretched out and drawn thin, curling against my ear like someone was right beside me.

  I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, waiting for the voice to come again.

  But the room was silent. And somehow, that was worse.

  That’s why I’m writing this.

  I need to put it down somewhere. Maybe if I see it all written out, it’ll make more sense.

  I live alone in a small apartment—not much bigger than a box. One bedroom, a tiny kitchen, and a bathroom with a sink that leaks no matter how many times I twist the knobs shut. The walls are thin enough that sometimes, when I have the night off, I hear my upstairs neighbor pacing at night, the dull "thud-thud-thud" of his footsteps moving back and forth, back and forth. I don’t know his name.

  I don’t have a lot of visitors. I don’t sleep much, either—never have.

  Even as a kid, I used to lie awake for hours, staring at the ceiling, listening to the house settle in the dark. The groan of pipes. The creak of floorboards shifting under invisible weight. I used to imagine someone was walking around downstairs, moving through the kitchen, standing at the bottom of the staircase.

  I think that’s because I grew up in a house that was never quiet.

  My mom—she had rules. Not the normal kind, like making your bed or saying “please” and “thank you.” No, her rules were different. "Don’t leave mirrors uncovered at night." "Never open the door if someone knocks past midnight." And the big one—"if you ever hear your name whispered in an empty room, never, ever answer."

  She believed in things. Spirits, bad energy, ghosts. She never said those words exactly, but I knew that’s what she meant. I remember waking up some nights to find her standing in the hallway, whispering under her breath, rubbing something along the doorframes. A white, powdery substance.

I never asked what it was.

I didn’t want to know.

  One night, after my mom had finished whatever ritual she was doing with the powder around the doorframes, she sat down at the kitchen table. Her eyes were distant, like she was staring through everything in the room. I was supposed to be asleep, but I couldn’t help myself—sometimes, I’d watch her when she didn’t know. This night, she finally spoke. "There are things you can’t see, Ezra," she said, her voice soft, almost sad. “Things that follow you. They watch.” She paused, her eyes flicking toward the hallway, as though she were expecting something to step out of the shadows. I asked her what she meant, but she didn’t answer right away. When she did, her words were careful, measured, like she was telling me something I wasn’t supposed to know. "If you ever hear your name, even when no one's around... don't answer, Ezra. You don't know what might be on the other side." Her voice was almost a whisper by the end, like she was afraid someone—or something—might hear. I didn’t understand then, but it stuck with me. In the back of my mind, I always wondered what she was really afraid of.

  My dad, on the other hand, thought she was crazy. He was a mean drunk, the kind that never really sobers up. He’d come home late, clattering around in the kitchen, slamming cabinets, muttering under his breath about money or work or nothing at all. My mom would sit at the table, staring past him, her hands folded neatly in her lap.

  I had a little sister, too. Molly. She was five years younger than me, small and pale with wide brown eyes. She followed me everywhere. I was protective of her—I had to be. 
Molly was different. Quiet. She had this way of watching the world, like she was trying to understand it from a distance. Sometimes I’d catch her staring at me, her eyes wide and serious, and it would make me uncomfortable. I don’t think she ever fully understood what was going on with Mom and Dad. She was too young. But she felt it. I could see it in the way she clung to me, like I was the only thing that made sense in the chaos. I always felt responsible for her—like if anything ever happened, it was on me to keep her safe.

I haven’t thought about them in a long time.

I don’t know why I’ve been thinking about them now.

Maybe it’s because of what I found last week.

  I was going through some old boxes in my closet—stuff I hadn’t touched in years. Most of it was junk. Old clothes, tangled-up phone chargers, a few notebooks filled with half-scribbled ideas for stories I never finished. But at the bottom of one box, beneath a stack of old birthday cards and yellowed newspaper clippings, I found something that didn’t belong.

It was a photograph.

A picture of me and Noah.

  Noah was my best friend when I was a kid. We did everything together—rode bikes through the neighborhood, climbed trees in the woods behind my house, stayed up late telling scary stories in his basement.

And then, one summer, he was gone.

I was eight. He was nine.

  The picture must have been taken the day it happened. In it, we’re standing in front of an old, abandoned house at the edge of town. I remember that place. Everyone said it was haunted. Broken windows, rotting wood, a front door that hung open just enough to make you wonder what was inside.

Noah wanted to prove ghosts were real.

  He and I had always been adventurous—riding bikes through alleys, sneaking into abandoned buildings, climbing trees like we owned the damn forest—but that day felt different. There was something in the air, thick and buzzing like electricity. We had packed a bag with snacks, flashlights, and a few bottles of water, though I don’t think we ever really planned on drinking them. It was more about the thrill of the unknown, the idea that we were doing something most kids our age were too scared to even think about.
We headed into the woods behind my house, the trees arching overhead like dark cathedral ceilings, shadows stretching long and deep as the sun began to dip lower. Noah was a few steps ahead, his usual grin plastered on his face.

“Hurry up, slowpoke,” he called, pushing aside a branch. “What, you scared already?”

“Piss off,” I shot back, but I jogged to catch up.

 The trees pressed in around us, the branches scratching against each other like whispers. The ground felt weird under my feet, like it was shifting ever so slightly with every step. I shook it off. It was just nerves. We came to a clearing, and there it was—the house. Old. Abandoned. The roof sagging, the windows black and empty like missing eyes.

Noah whistled. “Damn. It looks even creepier up close.”

I swallowed hard. “We don’t have to go in.”

Noah turned to me, smirking. “You kidding? This is what we came for. Thought you weren’t scared.”

“I’m not.”

“Prove it.”

  He was already climbing the porch steps, and I had no choice but to follow. The wood groaned under our weight. He pressed his hand against the door, and with barely a push, it swung open with a long, aching creak. The air inside was thick, stale, carrying the scent of mildew and something else—something rotten.

“Smells like ass in here,” Noah muttered, pulling his shirt up over his nose.

“Maybe we shouldn’t—”

“Too late,” he grinned, flicking on his flashlight.

  We moved deeper inside, our footsteps muffled by years of dust and neglect. The house was still, like it had been waiting for someone to disturb it. I ran my fingers along the peeling wallpaper, my skin crawling at the dampness beneath.

“Bet this place is full of ghosts,” Noah said, his voice teasing but quiet.

I rolled my eyes. “Yeah, sure. You believe in ghosts now?”

He grinned. “I do. But I wouldn’t need to. You’re scared enough for both of us.”

“I am not!” I shouted, and Noah gave me the signal to hush

  He then just laughed and kept moving. Room by room, we explored—broken furniture, old picture frames with faces too faded to make out, cabinets filled with dust and forgotten things. We found a rusted knife on the kitchen counter, its blade eaten away by time. Noah picked it up, turning it over in his hands.

“Maybe it belonged to a murderer,” he said, waving it toward me.

“Jesus, put that down.”

He smirked, tossing it back onto the counter with a clatter. “Relax.”

Then we found the basement door. Noah grabbed the handle and jiggled it. Unlocked.

  He turned to me, his eyes glinting. “This is where the real shit happens.”

I hesitated. The air was different here, heavier. My stomach twisted.

“Noah, maybe we should—”

  But he was already yanking the door open. A wave of cold, damp air rushed up from below. The stairs stretched down into absolute blackness. Noah took the first step, flashlight beam bouncing along the walls. “You coming, or what?”

  I swallowed hard and followed. Step by step, deeper into the dark. The smell was worse down here—thick, wet, like mold and rot and something else I couldn’t place. The air pressed against my skin, and I shivered.

“Noah,” I whispered.

But he didn’t answer.

I swung my flashlight around.

He was gone.

Just… gone.

And then—

Nothing.

I remember that much.

But as I stared at the photo, I realized something was wrong. 

I didn’t remember this picture being taken.

I don’t even remember bringing a camera that day.

And then, there was something else. In the background, behind us, there was a figure in one of the upstairs windows.

At first, I thought it was just a trick of the light—a shadow, a smudge, something explainable. But the longer I looked, the less sure I became. It was a person. A pale face, dark eyes, staring down at us.

I flipped the picture over. There was something written on the back, in faded ink. A date. July 15th, 2005.

The day Noah died.

I’ve told myself that for years, but I don’t think that’s true.

The next thing I remember is running home, my arms scraped up, my shirt torn, my breath hitching in my chest. My mom grabbing my shoulders, shaking me, asking—"Where’s Noah? Where is he?!"

But I didn’t know.

I didn’t know.

The police found his body two days later, deep in the basement of that house.

A tragedy.

That’s what they called it.

But sometimes, late at night, I wonder. 

I dream about that house. About walking down those rotting stairs, the air thick and stale, the darkness pressing in. I dream about Noah’s face, pale and wide-eyed, his mouth open like he’s trying to scream.

And in my dreams, I’m standing over him.

Watching.

I don’t know why I’m dreaming about it again. I haven’t thought about it for years. But it’s been getting worse, these last few nights. The dreams. The whispers.

It’s like I can feel something watching me when I wake up. The air is different somehow, thick with a presence I can’t explain. I check the apartment, even though I know it’s just me. I’ve never been the type to jump at noises, but these days, even the smallest sound gets under my skin.

A tap at the window. The floor creaking in the hallway.

But it’s not just the noises. It’s the feeling.

It’s like something’s waiting for me to figure it out, like I’m on the verge of remembering something. And maybe that’s why I went digging in the first place. Maybe I wanted to find some kind of closure. Maybe I thought finding Noah’s picture would bring me peace.

Instead, it only brought more questions. 

I burned the photograph.

I don’t know why. Maybe I was scared of what it meant.

But it didn’t change anything.

Because last night, I woke up to something whispering my name.

And this time, I almost answered.
