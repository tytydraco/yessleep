Washing the blood from my hands at the end of the day is refreshing.

When I walk down the hallways after clocking out, placing my scrubs in the laundry and mentally shutting away the shift, I feel relieved. Sometimes I buy a drink from the vending machine, a small reward to punctuate the closing of another chapter in my career. A wave of inevitability readies itself as I brace before exiting, always threatening to crash, always demanding I stop for once.

I step outside the building, out the back where no one sees me, and turn to face the dark shape behind me. In the shadow of night the hospital takes on an imposing gravitas, as if the moon itself highlights its features and deepens the pockmarked surface. Disease and sickness seem to radiate from the structure, as though the walls are infected by the suffering inside.

It’s nice to leave that place. But then comes the next part.

The streets are quiet this early in the morning, my night shift ending at a time when life has stopped for everyone else. Houses and roads take on an unnatural stillness that reminds me of death seeping from the hospital, following me. It feels as if the patients I watch over have not truly gone but linger, their final breaths stretched into whispers that cling to the edges of my thoughts. Their voices creep through the silence, faint and broken, slipping between the rustle of leaves or the hum of a distant streetlight. Some sound like pleas, others like accusations.

Making the conscious effort to put one foot in front of the other fills me with hope, but the voices move with me, pooling in the shadows and echoing in the corners of empty streets. That lingering feeling creeps in time and time again. Watching. Waiting.

The longer I walk, the more the silence bends. Streetlamps lean closer, their glow warping into peering eyes that track my every step. The neat lines of fences ripple in the corner of my vision, almost taking on twisted forms, stretching into jaws with bristling teeth of wood and iron. Even the cracks in the pavement curl like gnarled fingers, reaching up to snatch at my shoes. For a moment, I swear the shadows of parked cars stir, stretching into figures, thin & long, their heads tilting as if they too listen to the voices.

“Why didn’t you move faster..?”

I push past the monstrous houses and leering streetlights until I reach the threshold of the river. A simple bridge stands before me, a portal to safety. The transition point to home, just a block away. The path leading to it lies in disrepair, its fractures crawling like insects toward me, pointing, accusing.

All I have to do is cross this bridge, and I’ll be safe.

“The monitors screamed, and you watched...”

I quicken my pace, hoping for once I can outrun the voices before they take me again. My footsteps ring out against the metal grates, the sound echoing into the night as if the bridge itself is moments from breaking.

“You failed… You must do better…”

So close. Just a few more steps. Just cross this bridge.

The shadows gather ahead, thickening, joining together until an army of them stands in my path, faceless and swaying. Their bodies ripple like smoke, but their eyes burn with the glow of hospital monitors.

“All of us are in your hands, and your hands are stained…”

I slow for a moment, taking them in. A wall of faceless figures swaying in unison, their burning eyes fixed on me. I almost stop. I almost speak. The words catch in my throat, swallowed by the weight of their silence. My mouth finally acquiesces.

“I’m sorry…” I whimper.

The voices crawl under my skin, pressing against my skull until it feels like my own thoughts have turned against me. My chest tightens, and the air tastes of iron.

I run.

Head down, sprinting faster and faster. My shoes hammer against the bridge, each step echoing like a heartbeat too loud. The shadows lurch after me, stretching long, clawing at my heels. I can outrun them. I can outrun them.

The slam of my door finally severs me from the night outside. Walls wrap around me like armour, shutting out the whispers that scratch at the edges of hearing.

At last, I am safe.

Until tomorrow night.
