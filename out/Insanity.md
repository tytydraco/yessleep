"*911, where is your emergency?*" the operator asked.

"HELP ME!" I shouted desperately. "I'M AT—"

A skinless woman lunged over the table and swiped at me, knocking the phone from my hand and sending it flying through the air.

Blood from her glistening body sprayed over my arm as I barely managed to avoid her clawing fingers. She was thrown off balance by my dodge and tripped over a chair, falling to the ground.

I stumbled backwards towards the bar, staring in horror at my phone—which was now broken on the hardwood floor behind her.

*This is a nightmare.* I had just been closing up the bar for the night—wiping down the tables—when suddenly the door crashed open and I was attacked by this blood-covered psychopath.

I had barely managed to hold her off long enough to call 911. What the hell was I supposed to do now? I was shaking with adrenaline and scared out of my mind.

Turning her skull toward me as she struggled to stand—pupils huge in wide, lidless eyes—she started giggling.

"whyareyouscareddon'tbeafraidofhellit'sokayi'llshowyou—" she chittered, her facial muscles pulling her mouth into a rictus grin.

For a moment I was frozen. Her insanity struck as a physical force. This monster was going to tear me to shreds. Laughing as she did it.

She rose in jerking motions onto her bleeding legs.

Snapping out of my paralysis, I turned, vaulted off a stool and over the bar top, landing behind the counter and twisting to face her.

She was about ten feet away and gaining speed when I threw a pint glass at her. It struck her chest and shattered. She didn't even flinch. A million glittering pieces hung in the air as she dove for me over the bar.

I screamed, jumping aside at the last second. She hit the wall and liquor bottles began falling to the floor in a cacophony of rattling glass.

She somehow landed on her feet, turned in one smooth motion, and sprang at me—sending us both crashing to the ground.

I frantically put my legs up to keep her raw, muscled arms away from my face. Rolling to my right, I managed to pin her left arm against the underside of the bar, and desperately grabbed her slick right arm before her hand could reach my throat.

She leaned forward, using all of her weight in an attempt to overpower me. Her muscles visibly rippled with exertion, coiling and uncoiling with every small movement.

Blood dripped from her face onto mine as I fought a desperate struggle to match her frenzied strength.

She grinned, laughing with hysterical, rapturous joy; weeping crimson tears as she pushed her fingers towards my neck.

I stared into her lidless, bloodshot eyes, and Hell stared back.

"STOP—" I managed, before she pressed down harder. It was difficult to get any purchase on her bleeding muscles.

"looKiNthEdooRanDyou'lLseEhell'SwhisperSwilLseTyoUfreE—" she sang, as I used every bit of strength to hold her off.

Her fingers were an inch from my throat. Sweat—and her blood—rolled down my face as madness and horror pressed in. This was the end.

"isawandiheardisawandiheardisawandiheard—" she gibbered, her unblinking eyes getting closer.

"GET—" I grunted out, fighting for my life. She was so strong. Impossibly strong.

*I'm going to die.*

With a final burst of adrenaline and nothing left to lose, I released my left hand from her slick wrist. Blindly searching the ground, my fingers found the neck of a fallen bottle.

"—OFF!" I screamed, and swung the whiskey bottle at her head with everything I had.

She must have had some self-preservation left, because she turned her head to the side as the bottle struck her.

The bottle fell from my numb fingers as she went limp.

I kicked her off me and scrambled backwards across the floor. Groaning, I grabbed the bar top and pulled myself up and over it. I crawled to a table and used it to climb to my feet.

My body was in agony; every aching muscle was on fire. I could hardly breathe, but I needed to escape. There was no stopping. I had to get away.

Limping, I staggered forward. I had to make it out the door. It wasn't far; I could make it. I just needed to keep moving.

I heard a quick series of wet "plap" noises on the hardwood floor.

Instinct saved me.

I grabbed the closest chair and swung it in a blind arc as I spun around, screaming.

She was running at me when the chair slammed into her legs; the sharp CRACK of breaking bone reached my ears as she fell forward.

The impact knocked her off course, but her shoulder still caught me in the side. My feet were swept from the floor and I landed on my back, hard.

"*NO!*" I screamed in fear as she dragged herself towards me in a frenzied burst of speed.

Her broken leg left a red smear across the hardwood as she dragged it. Nothing would stop her from getting her hands on me.

She giggled as I frantically pushed myself backwards, then suddenly opened her mouth and screamed at me louder than I've ever heard anyone scream.

"**I'MINHELLANDYOUASWELLANDI'MINHELLANDYOUASWELLAND**—"

She was piercingly loud and I lost my concentration—my hand slipped in blood that she had spilled earlier and I dropped fully to the floor.

On my back, I looked down at her. Her grin was wide as she closed in.

"—***I'MINHELLANDYOUASWELLANDI'MIN***—"

"AAAAHHHHHHH!" I screamed in utter terror as she suddenly lunged forward, reaching for me, her bloody fingers trembling in anticipation. I kicked out reflexively.

With a hideous squelch, my shoe slammed into her face. A shock jolted up my leg.

She collapsed to the ground, unmoving. 

Silence. My breath caught. 

Was she dead?

A subtle rise of her chest—*she was still breathing*.

I screamed.

In a blind panic, I lurched to my feet and tripped over myself, desperate to escape before she woke up.

Fear had taken over, and even as I finally made it through the front door and into the night, I couldn't stop screaming.

I stumbled down the street outside the bar, crying out for help and covered in blood.

Insanity, my shadow under the moon, chased me.

Later, police entered the bar.

The skinless woman had already bled out.

---

It's been two months since then, and I'm still recovering. She visits me in my nightmares.

Today, the police contacted me. With dental records, they'd made an identification.

Laura. A librarian.

She died in [1921](https://www.reddit.com/u/leadraine/s/2yzYv3vYRm).
