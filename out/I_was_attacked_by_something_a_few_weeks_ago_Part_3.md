A lot has happened in the last few days. I got to leave my room for the first time. More importantly I made some new friends! In the last part I told y'all about the voices and notes coming from under the doors. I have learned more about that now. A lot more.

So, I'll start with leaving my room. I woke up to my door wide open. I hesitated for longer than most people would, about thirty minutes, just thinking about WHY it was open. I walked out and immediately noticed something weird about the hallway I walked into. The doors were all directly side by side. It makes no sense, but then nothing in this place does. When I say directly side by side I mean all that separates them is thin trimming. My room is by no means small, it's about the size of an average bedroom, so the spacing seems impossible.

There was no one else in the hallway but I could hear voices coming from a door down the hall.

I walked to it and decided why the hell not before slowly opening it and peaking inside. The "voices" I heard in that room were coming from one person. So many voices. Like you just walked into a cafeteria in school during lunch. I closed the door when I saw them smile at me.

Suddenly, from behind me a hand grabs my shoulder and turns me around. I'm face to face with a girl around my age, maybe a little younger. She was pretty short, maybe 5'3 at most. She had on a hoodie and big headphones, bright pink hair in a pixie cut, and skinny jeans with no shoes on. Not to mention these piercing blue eyes. The disturbing part of her was her feet, which I normally wouldn't have looked at but they had hair.. like everywhere. I'm not one to judge but I didn't even know that was physically possible.

She, and I am not exaggerating, threw me onto her shoulder then walked off with me. I was speechless and kind of just baffled by what was happening. "I'll show you where we meet." She mumbled. I could barely hear her over the loud music coming from her headphones but figured I might as well just roll with the punches. I still have no clue who the notes were telling me not to talk to so I didn't respond to her. She walked for a long time. It seemed like the hallway was endless but we finally reached a door that she opened.

Inside were six other people ranging from a young teen to an old lady standing around a table. It looked like a playroom at a doctors office. As soon as we entered the room another girl around my age walked up to me.

"Ooooh. This ones a lot cuter than the last guy they brought in!" She exclaimed. "Maybe we can share rooms some time."

I swear when she said that her eyes became solid red and small horns poked out of the top of her head. Her normal eyes are hazel. She has blonde hair and was very attractive, like if she was outside of this room in the mall everyone's eyes would be on her. Not to tall and not to short. Kind of perfect in every way you could imagine.

Behind her walked a man. He was tall and muscular. His hair came down to his shoulders and was jet black. I would guess he's of Asian descent but I couldn't tell you from where. By the way, when I say he is tall I mean he is easily over 6'7. He towered over the doorframe which was a lot taller than me at 5'10. "Why are you carrying around the new guy, Yeren?" He said calmly.

She immediately dropped me. I slowly say up and looked around at the other four members of the room.

The big man noticed me looking around and smiled down at me. "You're probably interested in know more of what's going on. Allow me to introduce us."

He pointed to the man standing furthest away from us, a skinny man who looked like he might be a zombie. "That is Vet. He doesn't talk much, but when he does it's confusing. He like, tells fortunes and stuff. You have to answer his questions right to really get what's going on though."

He pointed to the man next to him, a man with vibrant orange hair. He looked maybe fourteen or fifteen. "Tha-" before he could finish his sentence the teen interrupted.

"I'm Don. I don't know why you're here but I don't like your face. You look like the kind of guy that can just walk into a room and talk to the prettiest girl and get her number. Not that you're hot, I'm way better lookin-" He immediately shut his mouth and paled.

This time it was his turn to get interrupted when a man in a lab coat walked in. He saw me, sitting on the floor looking bewildered, and smiled. Another biting pain shot through my spine and I fell back on the ground, yowling in pain. Between my tears I could see his smile widen and every one else in the room looked sullen. The man in the lab coat left and I slowly stopped feeling the pain that kept me pinned to the ground.

The old lady came up to me next. She knelt down next to me and put a hand on my shoulder.

"My name is Nem." She said and I looked up at her noticing that her eyes were like an eagles. "You can't let them see you feel the pain." She slid a piece of construction paper into my pocket. It looked like the big man moved to a specific spot when she did that. I'm guessing he was blocking a camera.

I looked at the last person in the room that hadn't been introduced yet. He..? She..? They. They were really disorienting to look at. It was like there were three different faces depending on the lighting they were standing in. They smirked at me when they noticed my confused face.

"You can just call me Hades. By the way, I'd prefer if you call me they or them. There's more than one of us in here and we're all a little different." That didn't really help with the confusion but I think I'm okay with not questioning it.

"We aren't allowed to be out much longer, but we are the ones who pass you notes. You've done good not to talk to the voices under the door. The last time one of us did that.. well let's just say he's even weirder than us now." They looked over my shoulder at the girl who carried me here. "Yeren?" They said questioningly. I looked over my shoulder to see her give a slight nod.

They smiled at me before helping me to my feet and walking out. Everyone else followed them then split off in different directions leaving me alone in the room. I took that as a sign to head out and stumbled my way down the hallways. The only reason I found my room was because Yeren was standing in front of my door. She nodded to a door two sets down then walked to it and went inside, closing it behind her.

I went into my room and pulled out the note, making sure to block the camera. "You don't have to talk to us, but when we're in that room the camera can only see us the way we want it to."

That was the day after my last post. My door wasn't open today and no notes were passed to me. I just noticed what time it was and realized I'm very tired. I think I'm going to go to sleep now. I'll be sure to update you all next time something happens.
