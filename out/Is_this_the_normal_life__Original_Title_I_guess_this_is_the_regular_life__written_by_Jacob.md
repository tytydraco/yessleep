I guess.. Well just start it from the beginning.  
The day he was born; this wasn’t an accident, he was wanted. Just not in the form he’d been given. When this boy was delivered he had a purplish hue, low on oxygen he had needed. This boy’s parents scared for him, the father named the boy Jacob. Jacob got taken home that night with his heart broken, snapped in half left cut open.  
The first house this boy had been in, an apartment in which I don’t remember, this apartment I figure was small, yet it had meaning.  
A few days of Jacob being born the cops came to the apartment insisting that they lift him to the hospital, the figured it out. That night this boy had his first open heart surgery, they needed to know what has wrong.  
Skipping a bit to the future; this family moved into a house, the mom later left with no choice of coming back, the boy was 7. This hits hard.  
Jacob now only had a dad and soon didn’t have anyone but a grandma and a dad he’d see once a week, this boy was lost in a world of mystery.  
Jacob had a normal life until he turned 8; He’d had to go to the doctors again, this time it was serious, he needed surgery again for the fourth time. Open Heart of course. Jacob had to have a pacemaker installed under his middle-right abb, this would be there forever.  
Jacob already knew he couldn’t do much; during school he went to class and got made fun of cause he had purple lips and sometimes purple skin, they called him a smurf.  
Jacob didn’t like this but never talked about it, he just let the anger build. This boy has built up anger to this day.  
Once Jacob turned nine or ten he moved in with his dad, finally an ok system. Jacob had been given a guitar, he started playing, never really got into it, him and his dad later moved in with a lady his dad met, she’d already had a house. This was the start of him making friends, he was though young. Jacob started guitar lessons and got infatuated, the only song he knew was 7 nation army, it was the most simplistic.  
Jacob got into music, his mind had been infatuated even at a young age.  
Jacob started having dreams; these dreams were of topics he didn’t like talking about, his mom leaving, coming back, leaving again, coming back. His dad leaving, dying; sometimes in brutal ways such as being run over by what seemed like his own truck. This hurt Jacob, he’d woken up still seeing, feeling, and thinking the dreams.  
Later on in Jacob’s life he got depressed, this was in his teens thirteen to fourteen with a little into fifteen. Jacob would go to the kitchen thinking he was useless, understanding he couldn’t ever play the sports he wanted or have the job he wanted, this was very saddening to Jacob and he felt he wasn’t meant to be alive or born. He would go to the kitchen and grab a knife, the biggest one and bring it to his heart or neck and start poking and slicing, he never got past the skin as he mentally talked himself out of it.  
Jacob later thought, isn’t it a bad idea to kill myself, Jacob wouldn’t be able to spend any time with his dad. He loved and loves his dad, its the only person he has.  
Lets take a trip to the future.  
This is Jacob: I’ve wrote all of this, all of it is true and part of my life, I left out some things such as me meeting the girl of my dreams at the age of 13-14 and later that ending leaving me sad and broken once again, not in a suicidal way. I still have mood changes but understand how to change my mood by listening to music and writing when it happens. I think I’m bipolar but.. Who really knows, I can’t just say I am cause that’s just not how that works.  
Let me know what you thought of my story.. If you want.
