I guess.. Well just start it from the beginning.The day he was born; this wasn’t an accident, he was wanted. Just not in the form he’d been given. When this boy was delivered he had a purplish hue, low on oxygen he had needed. This boy’s parents scared for him, the father named the boy Jacob. Jacob got taken home that night with his heart broken, snapped in half left cut open.The first house this boy had been in, an apartment in which I don’t remember, this apartment I figure was small, yet it had meaning.A few days of Jacob being born the cops came to the apartment insisting that they lift him to the hospital, the figured it out. That night this boy had his first open heart surgery, they needed to know what has wrong.Skipping a bit to the future; this family moved into a house, the mom later left with no choice of coming back, the boy was 7. This hits hard.Jacob now only had a dad and soon didn’t have anyone but a grandma and a dad he’d see once a week, this boy was lost in a world of mystery.Jacob had a normal life until he turned 8; He’d had to go to the doctors again, this time it was serious, he needed surgery again for the fourth time. Open Heart of course. Jacob had to have a pacemaker installed under his middle-right abb, this would be there forever.Jacob already knew he couldn’t do much; during school he went to class and got made fun of cause he had purple lips and sometimes purple skin, they called him a smurf.Jacob didn’t like this but never talked about it, he just let the anger build. This boy has built up anger to this day.Once Jacob turned nine or ten he moved in with his dad, finally an ok system. Jacob had been given a guitar, he started playing, never really got into it, him and his dad later moved in with a lady his dad met, she’d already had a house. This was the start of him making friends, he was though young. Jacob started guitar lessons and got infatuated, the only song he knew was 7 nation army, it was the most simplistic.Jacob got into music, his mind had been infatuated even at a young age.Jacob started having dreams; these dreams were of topics he didn’t like talking about, his mom leaving, coming back, leaving again, coming back. His dad leaving, dying; sometimes in brutal ways such as being run over by what seemed like his own truck. This hurt Jacob, he’d woken up still seeing, feeling, and thinking the dreams.Later on in Jacob’s life he got depressed, this was in his teens thirteen to fourteen with a little into fifteen. Jacob would go to the kitchen thinking he was useless, understanding he couldn’t ever play the sports he wanted or have the job he wanted, this was very saddening to Jacob and he felt he wasn’t meant to be alive or born. He would go to the kitchen and grab a knife, the biggest one and bring it to his heart or neck and start poking and slicing, he never got past the skin as he mentally talked himself out of it.Jacob later thought, isn’t it a bad idea to kill myself, Jacob wouldn’t be able to spend any time with his dad. He loved and loves his dad, its the only person he has.Lets take a trip to the future.This is Jacob: I’ve wrote all of this, all of it is true and part of my life, I left out some things such as me meeting the girl of my dreams at the age of 13-14 and later that ending leaving me sad and broken once again, not in a suicidal way. I still have mood changes but understand how to change my mood by listening to music and writing when it happens. I think I’m bipolar but.. Who really knows, I can’t just say I am cause that’s just not how that works.Let me know what you thought of my story.. If you want.

EDIT - I cant re-post this so I'll just copy and paste my new story, I've refined it a bit.

AI to shorten it - "The text is a personal story narrated by a 15-year-old boy named Jacob who underwent surgery due to a heart problem he had since childhood. His condition led to difficult times, including hospital bills and a couple of surgeries, but he remained resilient and active. He loved riding bikes and took up boxing before eventually finding a job and quitting it recently. Despite his medical history, Jacob considers himself a regular person who likes music, writing, and storytelling, and goes to school like any other student. He sometimes shares stories of the scars he earned throughout his life."

Me telling it -

Hello, my name is Jacob; I’m a 15 year old that’s experienced the world in very big doses.  
I started as anyone else would’ve coming out of someone else.  
The doctor started what would have been “Oh he’s a handsome boy”, instead it was more like “\*Silence\* I’m sorry but (partner) are you seeing this). The doctors were surprised by the purple color of me, they stated I needed oxygen and I was put on the tank. My mom and dad had of course been in the room, the room I had been born in; the doctors put me in a different room. A room in which they could study me and make sure I was suitable to go home.  
I then went to my Mom, and Dad’s apartment. This was I think a 2 bedroom apartment, not in the best area but not nearly in the hood, not by any means. I don’t remember everything, just what I’ve been told by asking questions. From what I was told by my dad; I was born, then a few days went on and the police came to the front door of the apartment insisting that I needed to be lifted to the hospital and that it was an emergency “My dad was in his underwear during this conversation”. I was then woken up and taken to the emergency room where the doctors studied me more and found that I had a heart problem, the exact issue I still to this day don’t fully know. All I know is that I am missing a ventricle and have a miss-heartbeat is how I’d say it.  
I went to the hospital, they verified everything, hit my dad with a bill of a million which he couldn’t pay of course “The Government paid for it”. This is when it got real.  
I had my surgery, skipping a few years everything was alright I guess “I’m still here”. I was a wordy child though, saying things constantly, singing, anything to make my mouth move. I was also active, too active for the disability I have.  
I was I think 3 when I got on my first bike; My dad told me this “You got on the bike and hopped right off saying to take the training wheels off”, I guess I’m a reckless person. I learned how to ride a bike by falling, getting hurt, getting back on it and trying not to fall. I did this sort of thing with everything from crashes to falling from a high place.  
Skipping a bit cause I can’t remember everything-  
My mom left the house with by two other step brothers when I was 7, I’d then went to my grandmas and my dad went to trade school to get a better job and more developed into his career.  
I lived with my grandma until I was about 10, in that time I had 2 open heart surgeries from what I remember, I was terrified for both of them. I just wanted to get it over with.  
These surgeries turned me into what I think was a.. Demon. I began feeling different from pain, not angry, sad, or anything like that, I just acted like it didn’t happen. The only time I felt emotion is when my mom was insulted or anything was said about her, the only other time I felt pain was when I lost my first girlfriend, her name was Grace and she was.. Grace.  
Skipping to the future, the moments that matter and the things that happened in the process-  
I always wanted to be something when I grew up, I just didn’t want to be sitting at a desk, or doing anything that wasn’t active or me getting hurt in a way or two.  
 I dreampt of being in the military, spec forces is what I wanted and would like to be. I’m a very fit person to this day with a body fat of 10% and am decently strong.  
I of course did things I wasn’t supposed to such as boxing; my first day was just practice of course, the second day I spared someone. Dude was tough, not as tough as me though; I would get hit and didn’t feel it, even got hit in my pacemaker area “stomach” but kept going, I had a win loss of W=3 and L=2, this was good for someone that had only been there for 2 weeks. I then got kicked out because they found out I had a pacemaker and heart defect. This.. sucked.  
I moved on and kept working my job, the job I’d had for.. Since I was 14, I am not 15 and don’t have a job because I quit out of wanted to just.. Chill.  
The ending-  
I’m a normal person, me and you are the same.  
I like music, writing, stories, and reading of course.  
I play games ofc.  
I go to school just like you in the same public schooling system as you.  
I tell stories about how I got these scars “Batman Reference lol”.  
Aaand.. The Real End.
