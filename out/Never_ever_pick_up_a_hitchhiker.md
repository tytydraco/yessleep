So this was told to me to by and old family friend Nicki numerous times as a kid growing up as one of those life advice stories to keep in mind through the years.

 and to her credit have never forgotten it whenever anything associated with hitchhiking comes up it always brings to mind and probably always will it even makes me a bit ill whenever i think about it actually. 

So Nicki who grew up at the same time as my dad so this was about early 1980 I believe. 

She was a young woman in her mid 20s. 

She is one of those real kind hearted souls always willing to help another in the time of need you know and i can’t imagine her being anything other than that when she was younger so totally see her doing this too. 

So driving in to the city which was about a 2 hour drive from town she saw a man walking down the side of the road.

 as she neared he turned and in typical hitchhiking manner stuck out the old arm and thumb. 

Nicki bless her heart pulled over and asked him if he needed any help. 

She told he was really polite if not a bit shy when he asked for a lift in to the city. 

Nicki gave a smile and popped open the passenger door for the guy.

 who then tossed his bag in the back seat and buckled up for the ride ahead. 

They talked pleasantly for most of the trip about friends, the news etc you know happy small talk. 

She felt they were getting along very well and even bought him dinner at the pit stop little over half way there. 

She says he seemed really flustered in awkward when she paid but one of the things they talked about was money and how he was pretty damned strapped for cash. 

which was why he was hitchhiking in the first place.

 but he eventually relented and they went on there way. 

As soon as they got in to the city he thanked her profusely for the ride and the food and asked to be dropped off once they hit down town. 

Before getting out he asked for Nickis phone number so he could contact her one day and maybe catch up. 

Thrilled at the prospect knowing how her new friend fairing. 

Nicki wrote it down for him and drove off with a warm feeling having done a good deed. 

Nicki gets this crease in her forehead and a funny look in her eye when she tells me this next part. 

How a week later she got a phone call from the same man she had picked up. 

He didn’t let her get a word in after hello and told she should thank god that she was raised so nice.

 because when he first got in the car he was planning on raping and murdering her once they got to that pitstop .

then he was going to steal her car and dumping her body in a ditch further down the road and then go on his Mary way.

but after she talked to him so kindly and even treated him to dinner with a smile on her face he couldn’t bring himself to do it .

he didn’t think he could live with himself after doing that to such a nice lady. 

The mans final words on the phone were “please Nicki please never ever pick up another hitchhiker “ . Then he hung up the phone. 

Nicki never got a call from him again when she tried dialing the number she got a pay phone. 

And so i learned one important thing from this story that im going to take that mans advice and never ever pick up a hitchhiker.
