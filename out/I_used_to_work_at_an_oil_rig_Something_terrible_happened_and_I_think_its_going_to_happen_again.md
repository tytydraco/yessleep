The news of the storm surprised all of us. Our weather data is generally quite comprehensive, especially as the rig was located in the middle of the ocean, and it had been nothing but clear skies throughout the past week. But it’s the ocean, right? Shit happens. The weather guys are real fucking good at what they do, but that doesn’t make them omnipotent.  
  
When we saw its dark, defiant walls of clouds move our way, we knew it wouldn’t be long until it reached us. It was early evening, the sun slowly swelling like a rotting orange in the horizon. Soon it would be dark. Most of our normal operations had to be halted until we could further assess the brevity and magnitude of the storm. At that point, we were mostly feeling annoyed at the unexpected delay; we generally enjoyed our work, since there’s not a whole lot to do in your down time.   
  
Not long after we were completely engulfed in darkness, and the storm hit us with fury.  
  
We were all stacked up inside, watching it through the windows, save for those working communications and general operations on other parts of the rig. We watched it fight through the ocean, digging into it, producing tall waves and deep, deadly trenches that moved in chaotic patterns. The wind grew a thousandfold, wheezing past us like a rabid animal as it tried to break through the windows and unlock the doors. And then the thunder emerged, like the gleaming wrath of God herself. The black sky ripped open in fast succession, flashing the water in bursts that made it look like crumpled aluminum foil. The windows became a slurry of raindrops as the rain battered the glass aided by gusts of wind. But we weren’t scared. We knew how strong the rig was. *We knew we were safe.*   
  
But then the reports started coming in. The guys working the comms relayed the information through the radio, and then those guys screamed over the roar of the storm, telling the rest of us what they’d heard.  
  
*“The Air Force reported something flashing in the sky! Negative, not lightning! Above the clouds!”*  
  
*“Something is rising from the seabed. Possible earthquake!”*  
  
*“There’s multiple anomalies in our readings. Rechecking all transmissions and reports for the cause. Possible electromagnetic interference.”*  
  
We started feeling uneasy, and began to talk about what was happening. Why was the Air Force giving us updates about a *storm*? And what the fuck could be rising from the ocean? Soon a hundred other things were shouted and relayed and talked about in loud shouts that held the spirit of whispers.  
  
I almost forgot about the storm as everyone started to become more agitated, which made me more scared of the people than the chaos outside. In the cacophony, people had to shout over each other to discuss the messages, and the flashing outside seemed to become startling to some. I didn’t like the overcrowdedness and the potluck of noises I couldn’t quite discern from each other - that was something I wanted to get away from when I began working at the rig. It felt like we were herrings in a tin can, and the lid was about to be popped.  
  
As another bolt of lightning flashed, someone shouted “I see it! It’s coming up!” He burst through the doors, letting the rainfall and the howling, cold wind inside. Although some pleaded with him to get back inside, the rest followed. Soon nearly the whole crew was outside, packed up around the slippery steel railing.  
  
I stayed behind. I was scared. It was all too weird for us not to be in some kind of danger, and although I couldn’t name what that danger was, somehow I knew it was there. I guess it was an instinctual thing. It felt as if we had to escape, but we were in a place where escape was impossible, and I guess the only thing to do was watch it all unfold. The feeling began to choke me, and I noticed my breath becoming more rapid as it pushed out my lungs in quick, hot bursts.   
  
I then realized I was the only one still inside. The echoes of shouting had relinquished the insides of the rig, and I could finally think clearly again. But then some ancient sense of peer-pressure emerged, and through the fright and uneasiness pushed through a feeling of stupidity. *Was I being less of a man for not going out to look? Was I the weird one? And if this would all blow over soon, would I get some stupid nickname for being a scaredy-cat?* For some reason that feeling prevailed, and I stepped outside into the rain to join the others. In an oil rig, as with any place that’s close-quarters - especially with men - it’s better not to be singled out.   
  
In a matter of seconds, I was soaked. The lightning was loud, like cymbals cracking under pressure. The flashing and the darkness playing with each other felt nauseating, and my sense of up-and-down blurred as my vision was cut from pure white light to empty blackness. I broke through the shouting crowd of wet men, like a hand sorting through laundry. I came to the edge of the railing and clenched it as hard as I could. At first I couldn’t see anything. But then another flash came, and for a moment it seemed to linger, lighting the unbearable sight in all its unholy glory.  
  
From the ocean, some hundred feet away from the edge of the rig, rose a gigantic stone obelisk. It was darker than the night, as if it soaked all the light around it. It was wider and taller than our oil rig, like a skyscraper. It grew until it blocked out the sky, and another flash made it cast a shadow on the rig. I felt like it was about to fall on us, crushing the lucky into mush and sending the rest into the cold, black water below.  
  
But in that flash, I saw something else as well. Things were moving along the wretched, stone hull of the obelisk. Long and thin creatures with sharp features, like thorns. From the distance they looked like ants atop a hill - and that’s the thought that made me realize how many there were. There must’ve been thousands of skittering beings. For no genuine reason, the sight revolted me to my core, a feeling that entrapped my body in a long, trembling shiver.  
  
I realized that the others were no longer shouting. They were mesmerized; perhaps by awe, or fright. And although I could feel my gaze linger on that wretched, black totem, my legs moved from some frightful power inside me. I ran inside and down flights of stairs with my feet constantly slipping, barely holding onto the blunt serrated steps, until I found a secure room with a thick door. As I ran, I could hear the radio system blaring all kinds of panicked words, like something out of a war movie.  
  
I wasn’t even sure where I was exactly, but it felt safe. I locked the door and sat down. I could still hear the storm bludgeon the rig, moving its folded metal parts in a deadly dance. All I could think of at that moment was *we aren’t meant to be here.*  
  
The chaotic drumming of twisting and clanking metal kept my mind fixed on survival. I listened closely, the adrenaline burning through me, hoping that this would all be over soon. I didn’t care anymore if the other guys would make fun of me - the need to survive surpassed all other childish feelings. If that thing were to fall on the rig, I wished I would be crushed under it.   
  
I’m not sure how much time had passed, but slowly the rig began to set in its place again. A peculiar quiet crept in, and my body felt immensely tired. *It had all blown over,* I thought, *and soon I’d ask if I could take a quick nap before my shift.* The guys would ask me where I’d gone, and when I’d tell them, they would laugh like the burly men they are.   
  
I gathered up my strength and took to the door. I couldn’t hear anything, except for a faint buzz from the intercom system. I had to massage my stiff, icy legs to work again, and once they were moving in their usual trajectory, I began to ascend the steel steps.   
  
Along the way I began finding my colleagues. None of them could ask me where I’d been, for they were all dead.   
  
Some were stacked on top of each other in piles of corpses. Some were slouched between the windows, with their entrails ripped apart by the glass. All of their faces had the skin torn off, and on some I could see large, deep claw marks. From the broken windows I could see no sign of the dark obelisk, but instead an ominously pale, baby-blue ocean, calm as can be, disturbed only by the faint ripples of fish breaking the surface for brief moments. The sun was out, warm and welcoming, gently baking the bodies with its golden rays penetrating inside the rig.   
  
None of them survived. I found my way to the comms station, and I had to move someone's body out of the way. It was so mangled I could not discern who it was.   
  
All of the systems were down, and I couldn’t get through to anyone. I was completely alone.  
  
The smell of decay and rot pushed me outside. I went up to the highest peak of the rig, where no bodies lay. I sat down and held my face, my mind completely blank. Although I’d always enjoyed solitude, this was too much. There was no one to talk to. No one to tell about what had happened. No one to ask for help.   
  
At some point I could see a black point in the distance. Someone was coming. I ran down and shouted and waved my hands, as if that would help them find me. Luckily, they were coming to me regardless, and soon they were boarding the rig.  
  
They didn’t ask me what had happened, and wouldn’t listen to me when I tried to tell them. More came, some on boats, some on helicopters, and most of them stayed on the rig. They wore black tactical gear, and they all had radios on their chests, which parroted codes and terms I couldn’t understand. Someone took me - well, basically dragged me - to a boat, and soon we were on our way. On the boat, two men sat next to me with guns held up to their chests, but they wouldn’t speak to me. I got the feeling that were I to do something stupid, they wouldn’t hesitate to subdue me.   
  
I sat quietly until we hit land. Not our usual port, but more military in nature. From the boat I was put in the back of a car, and succinctly driven to my house. I hadn’t given them the address.  
  
When we parked on my driveway, the driver came to open the door for me. It was locked from the inside - I’d checked. When I got out, he looked me up and down and said that my work contract would be terminated, effective immediately, and I would receive a plentiful pension.   
  
I asked him what I was supposed to tell everyone about what had happened. He chuckled, which made me incredibly angry, and said “You’re the only one who survived. You tell the people whatever you want. By this time tomorrow there won’t be a trace of it left.”  
  
He began to get back into the car, but I managed to grab his shoulder before he could kneel down into the driver’s seat. He pushed my hand off with quite a bit of force, and stared at me with his hand ready to grab the gun I then noticed was perched on his side. During the trip I’d come up with a hundred questions to ask, but I knew I probably wasn’t going to get answers to any of them. I decided to ask just one. The one that mattered the most.  
  
“What was it?”  
  
He thought for a moment, and seeing my rather non-aggressive stance, he relaxed his arms and said, with a sliver of genuine empathy “Something that shouldn’t be here. You’re better off just forgetting it ever happened.” He then drove off, and it took me some time to gather up the strength to go inside my house.   
  
But I can’t forget. And I can’t prove it, either. He was right. There’s already a story for the whole thing. Everything’s cleaned up, nice and shiny, and now some company bought the oil rig for a cheap price and are about to start using it again for its intended purpose.  
  
But I just can’t let it go. Not just for the obvious reasons; the trauma, the regret, the shame. But because whenever I close my eyes, I see that black totem. But now it’s not standing over the oil rig. It’s standing over everything, blocking out the sun. And there’s a feeling attached to it, a feeling I can’t find the roots of, a feeling so foreign I wish I could carve it out of me with a knife: *it’s coming soon, and there’s nothing we can do to stop it.*
