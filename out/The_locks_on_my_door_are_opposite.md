I've been living with my dad, brother & sister in law for about 2 years now. I'm pretty fortunate, not only to be surrounded by family these past few years, but to also have had a place to live just working fast food. I only make 13 dollars an hour, so I'm lucky to be here and I've helped my dad with groceries, bills and other miscellaneous things that come with maintaining a house. All of this changed sadly.

Around a year ago, my dad (68), got a girlfriend. That's great for someone seeking companionship late in life and I understand wanting to have someone, to be happy in old age. He moved in with her 6 months ago, and left me and my brother with the house. Everything has been fine, but as of the past 2 weeks things have gone arye, as I now have the house completely to myself, all alone. 

My sister in law and my brother have just moved out. The basement floods (a basement where their bedroom is / was) and after about 3 years of being here themselves, they finally found an apartment and have left living at Dad's behind. I don't blame them one bit, ever since I was a kid that basement has flooded bad during heavy rain, to the point you could swim down there. The water will raise almost 3ft In height and has left the interior of my basement with serious water damage.  It comes in through the walls and the drains are completely busted. 


Anyway, something about that basement has always bothered since I was a kid. There are no windows down there, nowhere for sunlight to get in. It makes it extremely dark and creepy , except for a door leading to the stair well outside. For years that door was a logical explanation for me, maybe call it a coping mechanism or just something to brush off. See, locks that keep people from coming in are normal. Locks that keep people from coming *up*, like up from a basement, not so much. I've always come to the conclusion that the locks were placed where they are upstairs to maybe protect from a home invasion, to stop anyone who broke in through the stair well door in the basement from coming up stairs to the main floor of the house. That was until I asked my dad about it. 

First, I'd like to include a few pictures of what I'm talking about. The locks upstairs, which includes a push-lock on the door knob, a chain lock which appears to be some kind of fail safe in case the push lock fails, and lastly a picture of the stair well door. This push lock has no key, and can only be open from the upstairs. https://imgur.com/a/4KmRnPx

My dad told me when he bought the house, that the cellar door wasn't there. It was completely bricked up. That means, as far as my basement goes, no way in, no way out. The house was built in 1933, we had the bricks taken out and installed the now dilapitaded door that protects me from nothing. I'd like to get it replaced, but I can barely afford to pay my electric bill. That's besides the point, as like I said earlier, the past few weeks since my brother moved out has raised questions. 

The first few nights were pretty normal, the sounds of the house settling and anything else your parents would probably tell you when you heard a spooky sounding noise in the house. On the fourth night, I heard a huge slam come from the basement. I grabbed my Winchester, pumped it, and proceeded downstairs. Upon inspection, nothing was out of the ordinary, just that cellar door and the empty basement. I went back up, and decided it be best to lock the door, the locks now coming in handy. 


2 days went by and everything was alright. I was just enjoying my day off, something I usually only get once a week as I was a supervisor, and I noticed something that sent me into full blown panic. I usually get off around 12:30 at night and don't get home until around 1:00 AM. When I got home, the door I had left locked and shut since nights prior was now wide open.

Fuck no. I don't believe in the paranormal, and at this point I still don't. Not yet anyway. I again grabbed my gun and searched the house. There wasn't a trace, not a single sign of presence, only a wide open door. At this point, regardless of the now clear house, I'd usually bail. I don't exactly have anywhere to go unless I wanted to rent out a motel room, but again, 13 dollars an hour. Not less than my safety, but more than I could afford still. I decided whatever had opened the door could come back, stubborn as I was, and I'd teach it what guns are. 

About 3 days ago, that's when the worst happened. I woke up around 2 am to the sounds of something slamming on the opposite side of that basement door. Not like a dog asking to come inside, not like some psycho trying to kick the door in. It sounded like something was crashing itself into the door, like an entire body. Playing it safe, I called 911, and waited on the front porch, shotgun laying on the stoop next to me under a blanket. I didn't want the cops to see me just chilling with a gun as for all they know I could have been the intruder. They searched the house, found nothing. 

An extremely welcoming officer spoke to me. 

"You live here alone?"
"Yes."
"That basement door is taped together with ducttape and cardboard. Someone could easily break into here. You should seriously consider replacing and reinforcing it.

I explained my financial situation and gratitude for them having come to look. 

"The house seems clear, just relax for the night buddy. If anything else happens, call us and be sure to keep that upstairs door locked." 

Those damn locks. I couldn't tell the officers, but it is now creeping into my mind that whoever installed those backwards locks did indeed do it on purpose, to keep something down there. 


Nosleep, I'm simply asking for the next best course of action. I've thought about asking my dad to come stay with me for a few days, as he now knows what happened. I could also ask my brother and his wife, but beyond that I have nowhere else to go. I hate to say it, but where my dad as well as my brother have moved to, it's going to be too far away from my job and someone has to look after the house. I'm hoping nothing happens tonight, and I've got that door locked shut. Any advice would be helpful, I'll post an update soon.
