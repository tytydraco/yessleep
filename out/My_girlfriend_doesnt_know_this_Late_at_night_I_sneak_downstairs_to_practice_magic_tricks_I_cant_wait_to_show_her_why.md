“What are you doing with that coin?” a soft voice asked.

I looked up at a blonde girl sitting in a wheelchair, whose enormous brown eyes were fixated on my hands. She looked about my age, twelve or thereabouts.

“Practicing a trick,” I said, my mouth suddenly dry.

“Magic, huh? Go on then—show me.”

Swallowing a gulp, I squeezed a penny inside my closed fist, made it vanish with a little flourish, and then pulled it out of the girl’s left ear. “Ta daa.”

Her perfect smile made my insides melt like butter in a hot pan. “Not bad. What’s your name?”

“Harry.”

“Like Houdini, cool. I’m Ruth. I’ve never seen you around here before, do you live nearby?”

“I’m just staying for the summer.”

“You’re wasting your summer in Greenabbey? Why? Do you really love the smell of crusty old people or something?”

“My dad sent me to live with my grandpa. He said he was sick of my face.”

She craned her skinny neck, pretending to study my skull from various different angles. “Yeah that makes sense, I just met you and I’m already sick of it. But it’s like a thirty-second walk to the beach, why sit *here*?”

In truth, some local teens who stalked the pier threatened to toss my Gameboy into the sea if they ever saw me again, so the metal bench outside the library seemed like the only safe place. I didn’t want my new crush to know what a giant loser I was, though, so I pointed at the bookbag hanging beside her legs, her skinny legs which looked whiter than porcelain and twice as brittle, and said, “At least I’m not reading, who reads when schools out anyway?”

“Hey, don’t knock it because you *can’t* read,” she said, and then spun toward the carpark. “Well, I’m outtie. Catch you later Houdini.”

In the hopes of impressing her the next time we met, I practised more complex tricks until my fingers hurt.

For the next week, I lingered outside the library, hoping to see the girl again. Late one night, on my way back across Shaw’s bridge, which sat along the Western coast of the sleepy little town, my wheels thudded over wooden boards until I pedalled into a giant headlight and skidded to a stop.

A parked minivan faced the guardrail head-on. Beyond the glare, a silhouetted driver sipped from a glass bottle while powerful waves crashed against the grey rocks far below us. I shrugged and continued on.

A week later, as I nosed through a Houdini biography at the library, those squeaky wheels pulled up alongside me.

“Aww, are you trying to teach yourself to read?” Ruth said, dropping a stack of books onto the desk.

An awkward, “Hi,” was the best I could manage.

“If you’re looking for suggestions, there’s a real cracker about a hungry caterpillar. I can help sound out the bigger words if you like.”

Before my brain could think up a witty reply, the stern librarian marched over and cleared her throat.

“Is this boy bothering you Ruthie?” She talked slowly, the way you might with a toddler.

“No Ms. Robinson,” Ruth answered, her voice no longer steeped in sarcasm. “I just want to know why he picked such boring books.”

The librarian scooped up a textbook called ‘Understanding grief’ and stared at me over her half-moon glasses. “Is this yours?”

“No, it’s—” I felt a sharp, stabbing pain in my shin. Wait, did Ruth just kick me? “Oww…I mean, *owhh* yeah. I love, uh, psychology.”

Her nose wrinkled. “Ruthie if this boy causes any trouble, you let me know.”

“I will Ms. Robinson.”

With that, the warden shuffled off into the next aisle.

“Do me a favour, check these out,” Ruth said. “Act like you’re getting them for yourself. I’ll meet you by the bench.”

As she zipped away, I flicked through a collection of titles about the human mind. What did she want with them? And why the ruse?

Eh, who cared—Greenabbey’s sole funny inhabitant trusted me with an important mission.

Beside the bench, as my co-conspirator crammed the books inside her pack, I studied those scrawny legs. Maybe they partly worked and the chair only provided extra support?

“So, cooked up any new tricks?” she asked.

Armed with a deck of cards, I had her pick one out, secretly palmed the selection as she slid it back with the rest, and then produced the ace of diamonds with a snap of my fingers.

“Impressive. Well, thanks for the help. Don’t tell anyone what happened, okay?”

“A magician never reveals his secrets.”

“You really are a nerd, aren’t you?” She said with a sly, half-grin. This made me blush.

And so, this became our routine. Every few days Ruth handed me more books—simultaneously checking out the occasional children’s novel below our reading age for herself—and then watched me perform another trick that would have made David Copperfield sick with envy. Her playful teasing left me grinning like a lovesick moron. Now and again, I’d asked for book recommendations and devour ones like ‘The Talented Mr Ripley’ back home and attempt to impress her by discussing them. With each encounter I became more and more smitten.

The time she wore a pink hairband and blouse, she had me laughing so much I didn’t want her to leave.

Across from the bench, there stood this huge war memorial; some old-timey general on his horse. From there, you could veer left to go explore the pier, or right for a huge park peppered with wildflowers.

I swallowed a lump and said, “I was thinking, if you don’t have anything else to do, we could check out the park. There’s flowers. And you’re a girl.”

“Oh, you noticed?”

“I didn’t mean,” I stammered. “It’s just…”

“Alright, don’t have an aneurysm. Lead the way.”

A tsunami of verbal diarrhoea spewed from my mouth as we marched along a path running alongside a narrow creek. “Anyway, so then I beat the Elite Four using just a—"

Ruth’s head perked up like a prairie dog. She slumped forward in her chair as the ‘Greenabbey amblers’—retirees dressed in colourful tracksuits—came powerwalking along, turkey necks wobbling away. They each greeted Ruth on their way past. She waved back feebly, as though straining from the effort.

Part of me wanted to know why her demeanour shifted around adults, although since that sensitive subject might have soured the mood, I bit down on the question.

Once the group left earshot, I said, “Anyway, so I beat the elite four using just a Rattata.”

“Wait, you play Pokémon?”

“Uhh, yeah! It’s all I’ve been talking about for like twenty minutes.”

That sly grin of hers made another appearance.

I rubbed my neck. “Oh. Sooo, uhh, what do *you* do for fun?"

“I read.”

“Is that all?”

“Well Dad doesn’t let me out much. Unless it’s for the library or a doctor’s appointment, he pretty much says no to everything. I’d kill to be able to go splash around at the beach again.”

She described all the health problems she suffered from: seizures, dietary issues, respiratory illness. I felt terrible. Guilty, even, as if her predicament was somehow my fault. “It must suck being so sick all the time.”

“Yeah, well, I’m not as fragile as people think,” she said, her voice bitter.

For a moment it felt like I’d been granted a peek at her sweet, inner core.

On our way back to the parking lot, a huge cry of ‘RUTHHHH’ went up.

She let out a weary sigh and shouted, “I’m here daddy, everything’s okay.”

Her dad came barrelling toward us, all out of breath. His hands clamped around Ruth’s gaunt shoulders. “What happened? Are you hurt?” From the way he spoke, you’d think his daughter had the mental capacity of a housecat.

I was too young to realize his foul breath reeked of whiskey, and I got the impression that unkempt beard hadn’t touched a razor in years.

“I was just talking to my friend,” Ruth replied. The word ‘friend’ hit like a hammer blow between the temples. I made a quick mental note: *find way to make Ruth like you as more than just friend.*

“Have you been out in this heat all afternoon?” he asked, cutting a glance at the sky, which exposed a network of scars along his throat. “Do you have any idea how scared I was when I got to the library and you weren’t there?”

“We just went to see the flowers. Really Daddy, I’m—”

The wheelchair spun with a screech as her dad pushed off in the direction of the carpark, so abruptly his daughter’s hands clung onto the armrests, the knuckles turning white. Over his shoulder, he said to me, “What the hell’s wrong with you? Can’t you see she’s ill?”

“I’m sorry,” I stammered. “I mean she looked like she…can I help?”

“Just stay the hell away from her,” he snarled. That stopped me dead in my tracks.

“You’ve got to be careful darling,” he said to his daughter. “I'd die if anything happened to you."

I watched him push her toward the car park, confused. She’d seemed perfectly fine, so why the reaction?

I didn’t see my crush for an entire fortnight after that. Bored, lonely, I skulked around Greenabbey like a lost puppy.

Come Autumn I’d get shipped back home, which meant I’d never get a chance to make Ruth my girlfriend. Just one kiss. If I could pull off *that* trick, it would seal the relationship, and could do the whole ‘long-distance’ thing until Dad sent me back to Greenabbey over Halloween break.

In Grandpa’s garage, while he varnished a cabinet, I begged him to tell me about Ruth’s family.

“Forget it, Harry,” he said. “Mr. McCarthy’s a recluse, but if he told you to leave that girl alone, you leave her alone. Last thing I need is you landing yourself on the front page of the Abbey Observer. Lord knows they jump on any opportunity to crank out a story about those two.”

He wouldn’t say another word about the subject. Luckily, an idea had formed at the back of my mind.

At the library, I strolled up to Ms. Wilson and said, “Excuse me, do you keep old newspapers?”

This enquiry got met with a cold stare.

“I, uhh, have to write an essay about where I spent my summer.”

She led me past the counter, into a smaller room where she grabbed a black binder filled with newspaper clippings off the shelf. “These go right back to 1964. Try not to make a mess.”

Finding articles about the McCarthys didn’t take long—in Greenabbey, they were bigger than the Beatles. The local paper cranked out endless puff pieces about them; there were headlines like *Bank donates money to pay off McCarthy’s mortgage*, and *Charity drive funds Disneyworld trip*. A group of volunteers even built an access ramp at their two-story home.

One feature caught my attention in particular because the writer referred to Ruth as being ‘paralysed from the waist down’. I tore through more articles, uncovering vague references to an ‘accident’, but before I could uncover the details, the librarian told me she needed to lock up.

As she ushered me toward the exit, a flyer for the ‘summer fare’ pinned onto the bulletin board called out to me. That sounded perfect for a romantic date.

“If you’re interested, you should come along,” the lady said, “we meet every Friday at six.”

“What?”

She tapped a different poster for the ‘Chatterbooks’—a pre-teen reading group.

I had another brainwave. “Oh. Thanks.”

The next day I cycled up and down the streets, passing the Greenabbey amblers and a dozen families along the way, until I spotted a house with a sloped ramp in the garden. In a panicked state, I went and stood before the entrance, where Mr. McCarthy caught me in the act of ringing the bell and shivered open the door.

“What do *you* want?” he hissed through the narrow gap. The stench of spoiled food seeped out onto the porch. Past his shoulder fat flies buzzed about chicken bones littering a side table.

I held out a copy of ‘Matilda’. “Ruth forgot this at the library. I wanted to make sure she got it.”

The book got snatched out of my shaky hand, then the door slammed in my face.

I needed to keep myself from skipping back to the bike, because inside the novel I’d secretly stashed a note. It said:

*Wanna go to the summer fair with me? It’s this Friday at 6. Tell your dad you’re going to the Chatterbooks. They meet in the library at the same time. Get your dad to drop you off and I’ll meet you there.*

Acid bubbled up in the pit of my stomach as I climbed back on my bike. What if Ruth didn’t accept my offer? Hell, what might happen if her father intercepted the note? Only time would tell.

Come the big day, I cycled over to the library and hid behind the war memorial. From the pier you could hear carnival music, the screams of children on rollercoasters, and a whirl and grind of machinery. Meanwhile, the occasional nerdy teen drifted into their book club meeting.

To my great relief, Mr. McCarthy arrived in a beat-up minivan and went through the whole rigmarole of grabbing Ruth’s wheelchair from the sliding side door. I’d seen his vehicle before, although I couldn’t place where. Not that it mattered. I was far more concerned with my date, who would have demolished the Miss Universe competition in her teal dress. I forced myself not to rush over and kiss her right then and there.

She scooted toward the library until her dad sped off, then we met up.

“You look…pretty,” I said. It sounded so forced and awkward. I braced myself for the sarcastic response.

“Thanks,” was all she said. “So, I told Dad the meeting ended at 9. That means if I’m not back here by then, he’ll hunt me down.”

“Then we better not waste any time.”

Hot dog stands and candy floss machines lined the marina’s outer edge, along with Ferris wheels and bumper cars. Attendees fawned over Ruth as we passed by. She kept her head low murmuring polite greetings in response. News about our date would no doubt travel around the gossip-starved town and reach her dad, but I’d be on a coach home by that point.

After my six attempts at the ring toss failed, Ruth gave it a shot. Her throw fell even shorter than mine, like she didn’t even try, but when she pushed out her lower lip the operator gave her a teddy anyway.

As we continued on, she winked at me in secret. What made her put up this helpless act? There was so much more to her than I knew.

“Let’s get some food,” she said, after two full laps.

We split a cone of fish and chips and hurled the leftovers off the pier, watching an army of gulls swoop down to catch the morsels before they hit the water, then we faced each other, Ruth beaming. The orange glimmer along the horizon really made her eyes sparkle.

My heart fluttered in my chest. Was this our big moment?

As I leaned forward murmurs tapered off. Then, silence. I looked over.

Other fair-goers had paused in their conversations, craning to watch like we were animals at the zoo.

Ruth fidgeted with her hair and looked away, all bashful. Damnit. I checked my watch. Thirty minutes.

We needed to go somewhere private. Past the fare, the beach looked deserted. “Hey, follow me,” I said.

The pier gave way to a smooth stone path that hugged the curve of the beach. By now the water had turned black, illuminated only by the stars.

Under the light of a remote lamppost, we stopped and watched sea birds peck at empty shells until my date let out a weary sigh.

“Is something wrong?” I asked, afraid I’d screwed up somehow.

“No, I just…I wish I could feel the sand between my toes.” For a moment we listened to the slop-slop-slop of hypnotic waves.

Perking up, Ruth said, “Hey, go stand in the water. Tell me what it feels like.”

“Okay,” I said, already kicking off my shoes.

The water cut right to the bone.

“Well?” Ruth shouted from the path.

“It feels cold,” I yelled back.

“No, how does it *really* feel?”

“*Really* cold.”

“You stink at this.” She checked over one shoulder, then the other. Although the post only illuminated twenty metres or so, it looked as though we had the place to ourselves. Slowly, the rail-thin girl pushed herself to standing and then kicked off her shoes and shuffled along the beach while I caught midges in my gaping mouth.

So she *could* walk. Pretty well, actually. But what now? Should I have complimented her on it?

No. Better to keep my mouth shut. Stay focused on the mission.

As Ruth joined me in the water, a cold wave rolled along engulfing us both up to our ankles. She clenched her jaw, tight, and squeezed my hand.

“Told you it was cold,” I said, followed eventually by, “Soooo…this is nice.”

She faced me. “Harry, can you keep a secret? Like, a really big secret.”

I crossed my heart. “A magician never reveals his secrets, remember?”

“Do you know Shaw’s bridge?”

“Yeah. I pass it on my way home.”

“Well a few years ago, my family was driving over it one night. It was raining really bad, then these headlights appeared and my dad swerved.” Her voice got all choked up. “All I remember is us falling and then this huge tidal wave. Mom died straight away and Dad got ripped out of the car, but I was stuck underwater for a long time. I could barely speak when I woke up, and the doctors said even if my brain got better, I’d probably never walk again. They kept me at the hospital until I was well enough to return home, and everyone said it was a miracle, but after the accident, Dad…he…”

She leaned forward and sobbed into my shoulder. My arms slid around her. It felt like she was made from glass she was so frail.

I could have held her all night, but then we heard concerned voices, carried along by the sea breeze.

“This is little Ruthie’s chair, someone call the police,” an elderly lady said. Over on the path, Greenabbey amblers had gathered around the empty wheelchair.

“Wait!” Ruth shrieked, her eyes growing huge. She hadn’t meant for anybody to see us.

A chorus of gasps went up. From all the astonished faces you’d have thought she rose from the dead, which I guess wasn’t a million miles from the truth.

“I’m fine,” she shouted as she rushed towards them.

From further along the path, there came another, more urgent cry of, “RUTH.” Her father’s voice. That set her off shaking with these full-body spasms. I checked my watch. 9.07. Crap.

Since Mr. McCarthy hadn’t found his daughter at the library, he’d raised the alarm and launched a search and rescue operation.

The shocked man ground to a halt a few metres from us.

Hysterical now, Ruth collapsed into a scattering of kelp like a puppet cut from its strings. “I’m fine Daddy, everything’s fine.”

Mr. McCarthy’s gaze whipped from me to his daughter to the amblers.

“I thought she was paralysed?” one man whispered.

“He’s been having us on,” added another. “He’s taken us for a bunch of mugs.”

In a heartbeat, Mr. McCarthy scooped up his daughter and stormed back toward the pier. While the power walkers argued over whether they’d witnessed a miracle or the McCarthy’s played the town for suckers, I kicked on my shoes and hurried after Ruth. My gut told me not to leave her alone.

At the fare, Mr. McCarthy couldn’t take ten steps without another concerned onlooker rushing to help.

“Leave us the FUCK alone,” he snarled, then the crowd parted like the dead sea for Moses.

The entire time, his daughter sobbed and begged and pleaded forgiveness until we reached the carpark. There, she thrashed around in her father’s arms, helpless. I’d never seen anybody so scared.

Coward that I was, I struggled mustering the courage to intervene until he tossed his daughter inside the minivan so carelessly that her head slammed against the dashboard, and with that, something snapped inside me. I ran up and pummelled her dad’s face and chest, screaming, “Leave her alone.”

Already half inside the cabin, he put a hand on my face, shoved me away, and then slammed the door shut.

Ruth’s fists pummelled against the side window as her father started the engine and sped off, clipping the side-mirrors of two parked cars along the way. The Minivan pulled left out of the bay, veering from one side of the road to the other while several locals looked on, confused.

Mr. McCarthy had looked like he might do something crazy. I needed to warn the police, but where had he taken his daughter? He didn’t set off in the direction of their house, and the only thing out West was…

Oh shit.

I grabbed a nearby payphone and punched in 9-9-9. “Mr. McCarthy is gonna drive off Shaw’s bridge.”

“Who is this?”

“Please. You have to send someone there *now*.”

“You know kid prank calls are an indictable offense in—”

Damnit, there was no time. I went and grabbed my bike and took off up the street.

Not daring to slow down, not even for one second, I weaved through side lanes. Sleepy houses zipped by in one prolonged blur until my wheels thudded over Shaw’s bridge where, without breaking stride, I leapt off the bike and leaned over the still-in-tact guard rail.

Down below, no half-submerged minivans or lifeless corpses bobbed along. Had my imagination run away with me? Maybe Mr. McCarthy simply went for a drive to clear his mind?

For a moment, my stomach unclenched.

Until a set of headlights came barrelling along…

I spun around, one hand raised to shield my eyes. Like a startled deer, I stood there, feet rooted to the ground, until my brain screamed: MOVE YOU IDIOT. At the very last second I dived to safety.

The minivan crashed through the barrier, flattening my bike along the way, and for a moment seemed to hang frozen in mid-air before plummeting past the point where I could see.

A huge hissing column of water shot into the air. “RUTH,” I screamed, as I pushed myself up.

I leapt the barrier and half-ran half-fell down a dirt trail into the water, which hit worse than an ice bath.

The vehicle didn’t sink straight away; first, it bobbed up and down on the back of a few limp waves, the cabin slowly filling with water. I swam around the passenger side, where Ruth alternated between pummelling the window and attempting to wind it down. Her dad bled from a gash along his forehead, all dazed.

I tried the handle but the door refused to budge, so then I elbowed the glass, unsuccessfully. My eyes scanned the cabin. What would Houdini have done?

“HEADREST,” I screamed, pointing at her chair.

Those brown eyes flicked from me to the headrest, then Ruth pulled it up until it popped loose. As she bashed the metal stands against the window, cracks webbed throughout the glass. The water steadily engulfed the cabin; in another few seconds, bubbles would be spewing from her nostrils. Would those scrawny arms have enough strength to break through?

She took a moment, readjusted her grip, and put everything into one last swing and shattered the glass.

Water surged into the cabin, forcing me to swim or get dragged inside as the van dipped below the surface. Using my free hand, I clung to the side mirror while feeling through the gap.

A hand clasped around mine. With an effort I pulled until Ruth emerged from the cabin, but at the halfway point her body became stuck and wouldn’t budge another inch, no matter how hard I heaved. I dove down and felt my way along. Did her foot get stuck on the steering wheel? Or tangled with a seatbelt?

Nope. Mr. McCarthy’s arms had clamped over his daughter’s ankles, tighter than a python.

Lungs begging for air, I probed along until I found his wrist and then bit into the soft flesh, swallowing a huge gulp of salt water in the process. Only after five seconds did he let go.

In one fluid movement, I angled myself upward, kicked off the door, and launched like a torpedo. Jagged glass wrenched the soft flesh of my shoulder as I passed through the shattered side window, grabbing Ruth along the way.

We paddled until we broke through the surface, a little baptism, and swam for the embankment. There, we vomited up torrents of brackish water as sirens wailed above us.

Despite their scepticism the authorities took my call seriously enough to investigate.

An officer raced down the mound demanding to know what happened. Still dripping wet, we explained through chattering teeth Ruth’s father was trapped inside the van, then the constable dove in and spent an entire minute underwater before emerging with an unconscious Mr. McCarthy…

\-

At the hospital, my shoulder received twelve stitches, then I gave an official statement to the police. After the medical staff shooed away a frenzy of reports and nosey locals, I snuck into Ruth’s room. “Are you okay?”

She nodded.

“You haven’t been sick for a long time, have you?”

She shook her head.

“Your dad, was he…crazy?”

“After the accident, he was taking care of me all the time, and he looked so stressed, so when I started getting the feeling back in my legs, I got excited. I asked if he could help me get my shoe off so I could surprise him by wriggling my toes. I thought he’d be happy, but instead he smashed a lamp and started crying. People had all these fundraisers planned, and they were going to help with the bills. Dad just shook his head and kept saying I was still sick. And he made me take all these pills and wouldn’t let me eat. And if I ever tried to tell him I was all better, it made him...”

Her lower lip began to tremble, so I pulled her in close. Neither of us spoke another word until a nurse peeked around the curtain and then dragged me back to my own room.

The Abbey Observer endlessly speculated about whether Daniel McCarthy suffered from Munchausen syndrome—a mental illness where someone invents fake symptoms to make it look like a person in their care is sick, although this diagnosis was purely speculative, because five minutes underwater left the leech mostly comatose. He stayed in a care facility until he died in his sleep, some twenty years later.

Ruth had enlisted my help in checking out medical textbooks to find an explanation for her father’s odd behaviour *without* alerting him. According to her, he’d shown suicidal tendencies since before I arrived in Greenabbey. The ‘miracle by the pier’ simply gave him that final push.

Ruth got placed with a foster family whereas I returned home. Naively believing the tragedy would bind us together, she and I swore we’d write to each other every day.

This agreement lasted six weeks.

For the longest time the nasty scar along my shoulder and a newspaper clipping of an article entitled ‘hero boy prevents drowning’ was the only thing I had to remember that summer by. But then three years ago, while standing in line at a coffee shop, a voice from behind me said, “Well if it isn’t Houdini himself.”

There she was. My first crush. Twice as funny and sarcastic and cheeky as I remembered.

I won’t bore you with the details of our love story, so let’s just say the next few years sped by in a whirlwind of romance. And that brings us to today.

Last month, I started practicing magic again. I’m relearning an old trick, you see.

Tonight, after our anniversary dinner, I’m going to make a coin disappear, reach behind Ruth’s ear, and pull out an engagement ring. I’m just praying my hands aren’t so sweaty I mess up.
