What happened [Tuesday.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/RCxwmgWFZz)

*WEDNESDAY*

Wednesday is one of my least favorite days of the week. It's the day our manager Gerold comes in to check on us all. He's supposed to be here everyday, but I don't think his sleep cycle works that way. He gets here in the morning and stays until close, and he watches us the whole time. Seriously, the man doesn't fucking blink. Ever. 

I made sure to get here on time, and begin loading my cart right away. It really pisses me off that Gerold even pretends to care. We all know he's too worried about fucking Ruby behind our backs. She's the one in charge of the money around here. Imagine that. 

One time, Adam walked in on Gerold and Ruby in the office. When he ran and got me, he told me that they had become 'one flesh'. Dude wasn't joking. Their skin had fused together, starting from the hips all the way up to their heads. Took *forever* to get them apart with just my box cutter. Come to think of it, that's right around the time Adam's episodes started. Hmm. 

As I chased around the loaves of bread trying to make them stay on my cart, I could feel a pair of eyes on me. I turn around, and Gerold is peeking at me from behind a pallet of paper towels. 

"I see you, Gerold." I said. "I'm trying my best, but they keep running off."

He leaned his head back and hissed at me as a few cockroaches took their chance to escape from his mouth. I gave him the thumbs up and got back to it. No use in trying to argue with him. 

When I finally make it out to the sales floor with my cart, the first customer I encounter is Crazy Mary. She's got a half eaten sandwich knotted up in her hair, a tire track across her face, and a raccoon is following her. I swear, whoever keeps saying her name in the mirror three times in a row needs to stop. 

"How you doing tonight, Mary?" I ask. 

"Wonderful!" She replied with a huge toothless smile. 

"Finding everything you need?" I asked, nervously. 

"Oh yes, just found it."

Fucking great. Now she's gonna follow me around until I give her some of my pee. Might as well get it over with. 

Paul was scheduled to work tonight, but he called in. Thank God too, because I don't need any extra bullshit to worry about. The dude had a stupid reason, though. Something about being trapped in a time loop and that he couldn't get out. Shit, aren't we all. 

Emma showed up instead. Must've got the call. She's one of the newer ones here, but she's catching on quick. Sweet girl; strange taste in men though. Started dating Chris a week after she was hired... loves the hand. Maybe a little too much. That's why we can't schedule them working the same shift alone. Also, I'm not trying to place any blame here, but... I *did* notice the hand had one less finger on it last night. Do with that what you will. 

I get to the front of the store to stock the bread and notice Ruby lingering near the registers. Of course she's here too. She looks over at me and tries to wink, but one of her fake eyelashes fall off, along with the eyeball it's attached to. I pull out my box cutter and show it to her. She flips me off and gets on the intercom.

"Gerold, you're needed to the office."

Fucking gross. At least I don't have to deal with the Turd Slug tonight. It somehow knows when Gerold's here and stays hidden. And, if I offer to buy Lenny his can of sardines, maybe he'll separate the 'one flesh' for me later. Besides, he's been looking for a reason to use that new machete. 

Emma wants to learn everything she can around here, which is great... but, she can be a little *intense* sometimes. She watched me fill the bread very closely, even though it's a fairly intuitive process. I think she was just staring at my fingers though, because at one point, she started to drool. I keep telling her I don't have any extras to spare, but she says she doesn't know what I'm talking about. *Right.*

On the way back to the bailer, I passed the Man Who Walks In Circles. I was feeling frisky... so, I looked around to make sure Gerold wasn't watching, then threw one of my empty boxes in his path, to see if I could make him move this time. He didn't. Just kept on walking in that circle, eyes fixed on me, smiling maniacally and wearing the box as a shoe. 

When I get to the bailer and start throwing my boxes in, I hear an odd thud... then, a scratchy-throated groan. I roll my eyes and lean forward to look inside. It's Tilly, spooning with the shrink-wrapped corpse from Monday. For Christ's sake, I didn't even know she was working tonight. She said she was just 'having a nap', and that I was very rude for disturbing her. 

I dodged The Fart Cloud on the way out of the warehouse. It'd caught Emma instead; she was gagging while trying to fill her cart with the cases of soda/lobsters. I grab the one crawling near my foot, and throw it into the bailer with Tilly and her new boyfriend. 

I head over to the break room before The Hum even starts up. I'd packed myself a delicious turkey sandwich today, and was starving. Lenny wasn't in there yet, so I wanted to hurry and scarf down my dinner before he showed up. I pull out my sandwich, take a huge bite, and feel it begin to squirm around in my mouth. I look down, and my turkey had turned into maggots. *Fuck.* I spit the bite out onto the floor, and it starts to crawl away. Lenny walks in, steps on it, then proceeds to tell me how gross I am. 

We spent the rest of the night separating the 'one flesh'. Gerold had told us if we weren't more careful about it this time, we'd be fired. We didn't care about losing our jobs, he meant that literally. Emma wanted to help too, of course. But, once again, I'm pretty sure she had ulterior motives... because I noticed by the end of the ordeal, Ruby was missing the tip off one of her pinkies. 

Finally, it was time to clock out. I slapped one of Gerold's mouth roaches out of my hair, wiped the Lenny goo off of my shoes, and made my way to the front. Tilly stopped me and asked if I could help her carry the body out to her car for her, so I did that first. I come back inside, walk up to the time clock, and get blasted in the face by The Fart Cloud.
