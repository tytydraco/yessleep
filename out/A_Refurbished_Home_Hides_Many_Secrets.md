Despite its fresh paint and polished mosaics, the house felt lived in from the moment I stepped inside. It smelled of plaster dust, sharp and clean, but beneath it clung something older - warmth soaked into the wood, as though the walls remembered meals and laughter. Odd, for a place so recently renovated, a fact the realtor had repeated almost to the point of insistence.

I told myself I needed that renewal. The move wasn’t about square footage or mortgage rates so much as distance. From the old job, the hostile boss, the endless small-office wars. The new position promised steadiness, a manager who listened, colleagues who minded their own work. A clean start, and this house was meant to be the reward.

The kitchen drew me first. Counters stiff beneath my hands, hinges creaking as if relearning motion, the fridge humming in steady breath. Morning light cut through the high window and fractured on the island, spreading across the floor in the shape of a seven-pointed star. I stood there that first morning, coffee cooling in my hand, and thought: it’s a lucky house.

Everywhere I walked, the house seemed to move with me. The third stair lifted its note like a small bell each time I passed. Drafts curved faithfully toward the living room. Doors leaned shut with the softness of pages closing. Rooms guided me always inward, until I found myself where the house seemed to want me: the living room.

There, comfort gathered in full. Cushions slumped warm from the sun, a rug that hushed each step, ceiling beams converging overhead like carved beads. The room wasn’t quite square, but softened, seven-sided, as if shaped more by intent than design. At twilight the beams looked ornamental, suspended like charms.

Even the basement carried that stillness. Its door, freshly painted and oiled, caught the sun as I passed, glowing for a moment before dimming again, as though the house drew its breath inward.

I never went down until the power failed one evening. Flashlight in hand, I turned the knob. It yielded easily.

The air was cool, mineral, faintly sweet, like my grandparents’ wine cellar. Moonlight spilled through the narrow window and fell in neat, careful lines. The floor was too smooth for a basement, the concrete sanded down as though someone had gone to lengths to erase its roughness.

The breaker box gleamed against the far wall, its switches aligned like teeth. I thought of messaging the realtor later, to thank her for such careful refurbishment. It was rare to find a place where even the hidden rooms had been treated with such care.

…

I didn’t properly meet my neighbors until the third week.

I’d seen their houses on my walks - whimsical variations on a core theme, one rising with clean brick lines, another softened by ivy, another brightened with shutters and a garden spilling slightly onto the sidewalk. I thought, now and then, that I glimpsed someone through a window or heard a voice carrying across a lawn, but I could never be sure.

But that evening they arrived together, like a delegation, each balancing something in their hands: bottles of wine with supermarket ribbons, casserole dishes still steaming under foil, a wicker basket lined with a gingham cloth and heavy with bread.

They filled the living room with little effort, arranging themselves on the sofa and chairs as if they’d been here countless times before. Their warmth was immediate, their smiles wide and practiced. In minutes the house was alive with the clink of glasses, the soft scrape of cutlery on bone china, and voices tumbling into laughter.

The food was wonderful - shockingly so. I helped myself to second, third, even fourth servings of lasagna, and tried not to sound overeager as I praised the couple who had brought it. They only exchanged a knowing glance, smiling like proud hosts, though it was my house.

At one point the drawer in the kitchen island jammed as I reached for extra cutlery. I tugged uselessly until one of the men chuckled and brushed past.

“Let me,” he said. A moment later I heard his steps on the basement stairs. He reappeared almost instantly with a screwdriver in hand, triumphant.

“Managed to find it quick enough,” he laughed, as if the tool had been waiting for him.

Later, one of the women excused herself to use the toilet. She stopped halfway down the hall, asking which door it was.

 “Just the next one on your left,” I said.

“Ah,” she replied, nodding with certainty, as though I had only confirmed what she already knew.

Curious, I asked, “Did you know the people who lived here before me?”

For a heartbeat, the room seemed to pause. Then one of them nodded, smiling as he set his glass down.

“Oh yes,” he said. “We knew them all.”

Another added, with a chuckle that was just a little too smooth: “We know this house very well indeed.”

By the time the plates were scraped clean and the last drops of wine drunk, I was flushed with warmth - not only from the alcohol, but from the strange sense of inclusion, of being woven seamlessly into their circle. At the door they thanked me profusely, as though I’d hosted them, pressing my hand or patting my shoulder before vanishing into the night with their emptied dishes.

I locked the door behind them with a kind of satisfaction I hadn’t felt in years. The house glowed with the afterimage of company: the faint perfume of bread and wine, the hum of laughter still clinging to the walls. For the first time, I thought, perhaps I could belong here.

I doused the lights room by room in a slow, meditative rhythm, the old floorboards creaking beneath my steps, until only my bedroom glowed faintly upstairs.

Later, with the window cracked open, I sipped the last half-glass of wine and let the cool night air wash over me. The houses across the street were still lit, squares of gold burning against the dark. Yet no shadows moved behind those curtains, no silhouettes passed in front of lamps. The façades stared back at me, silent and blank, glowing only to insist they were alive.

I told myself the neighbors must simply be tired after the long dinner. The thought soothed me.

I lay down, listening as the house settled around me, boards easing, pipes sighing. And just as sleep began to take me, I heard it - something deeper, muffled, rising from beneath the floorboards. A sound almost too faint to catch. Like the house itself had sighed.

…

The next morning, sunlight slipped through the blinds in its usual pale strips. I showered, dressed, made coffee - ordinary rituals, grounding me in the start of another workday. But when I stepped outside, briefcase in hand, I noticed the street was as empty as the night before. The same houses stood in their neat variations, lights still humming in windows, but not a single person stirred. No slamming of car doors, no joggers, no children waiting for the bus. Even the air seemed to hush itself.

*Was it always this quiet in the mornings?*

I lingered longer than I should have, scanning for the smallest sign of life, until finally I muttered that it was none of my business and walked on.

Work passed uneventfully, but in a good way. A respectful, peaceful work environment - where everyone just sat down, got their work done without fuss. Where exchanges in the break room felt like breaths of fresh air, rather than heavy with tireless gossip and backhanded complements.

Yet when I returned home at dusk, I kept noticing how quiet it all was. The houses lit like stage props, but no cast to play their parts. I unlocked my door and stepped inside, feeling a strange relief to be swallowed again by my own silence. It was peaceful here, wasn’t it? Quieter than anywhere I had lived before.

*This was the kind of life - the kind of neighborhood - I’d always aspired to live in.*

But as I moved about the evening - reheating my left-over casserole, thumbing through a new book, readying for bed - the quiet never really settled.

I kept catching myself looking out at my neighbor’s windows, hoping for some sign - any at all - of movement, but it never came. A peculiar sort of liminality where you felt alone, yet not. 

Something about the way the pipes kept knocking deep below the basement every half-hour or so kept me ever so slightly on edge too. That, and the way the basement door glowed in the setting sun, in hazy hues of crimson melting into amber - like the threatening flare of some watchful, venomous creature - made me wary of it. 

But of course, the power went out again that very night.

*Hilarious.*

I grabbed my torch, reluctant but resigned. 

I sighed, before flicking it on, and navigating my way down to the basement.

In daylight the house felt calm, almost protective, as if its walls had been storing quiet for years and were willing to share it with me. But at night, without the ambient, low light filtering through curtains, the silence seemed to sharpen. The hallways felt longer, the corners heavier, the ceilings higher. Every pane of glass reflected my own movements back at me, as though something else were watching just behind. 

And then there were the faint pinpricks I sometimes noticed only in the darkest corners - tiny red motes, too dim to be dust, too steady to be tricks of my eyes. I told myself they were from the appliances, some unseen standby light or sensor. Still, once seen, they followed me, like scattered eyes half-buried in shadow.

I began to suspect that the peace I’d admired by day was only a mask, and that in the dark the house showed its truer face.

The door swung open soundlessly as I opened it. A scent met me - cold and strong - carrying with it a scent that reminded me of neither mildew nor dust - but something much earthier - like disturbed ground.

I descended, noticing the way the light of my torch seemed to shiver without command. Pipes and boxes, stacked furniture, the expected clutter of an old basement greeted me.

I found the fuse box, flipped the breaker, and heard the house above me click and hum back to life.

I was about to turn and leave, but something about the way the dust particles caught in my torch-beam - as if tugged by a draft from deeper in the dark - drew my attention. 

I followed it a few steps past the reach of the singular bulb overhead, until my torch-light met a section of the wall where the stone looked different, rougher. And lower to the floor, half-hidden behind a shelving unit, I thought I had seen an opening - narrow, almost nothing - just enough to let that strange air breathe through.

I stood there longer than I should have, staring, listening. It felt like the house was holding its breath with me.

I crouched, bringing my face closer to the gap, and pointing my torch into the crack. The draft slid cool across my face, carrying with it that same raw scent of turned earth. The space beyond was narrow, irregular - not a tunnel so much as a crack in the stone, but deep enough that I couldn’t really see where it ended.

I leaned in, squinting, waiting for the beam to catch on something solid. For a few seconds, there was nothing - only shadow piled on shadow, my own breath shallow in the confined space. I sighed, making a note to myself to find a way to seal it off when I had the time. But just as I began to withdraw my head, I thought I saw it: the faintest glimmer, two points suspended in the black, catching the light for a heartbeat before sinking back again. Not bright, not obvious, but enough to give the unmistakable impression of something looking back.

I froze.

I looked again. A pair of eyes. Yearning. Patient. Like a child waiting for a piece of candy.

Unsure what to do, I wordlessly stood up, and headed back up, too afraid to react.

I slammed the basement door behind me and stood there in the hall, chest heaving, the silence of the house pressing close around me. Upstairs the lights glowed steadily again, calm and ordinary, as though nothing had happened at all.

…

Sleep never came. I lay awake in the upstairs bedroom, staring at the ceiling while the clock ticked steadily on the dresser. Every creak of the settling house, every whisper of wind at the shutters set my nerves on edge. When at last the windows began to gray with dawn, it felt less like the start of a new day and more like a reprieve - thin, temporary.

The neighborhood outside was the same as before: lawns trimmed, curtains drawn, driveways empty. The houses simply sat still and shone with their quiet lights. I told myself it was nothing - maybe everyone simply had places to be earlier than I did. 

Regardless, walking to the car, I couldn’t help but feel the weight of a hundred eyes, all unseen behind those curtained windows.

Work did not go well. I sat at my desk fighting to keep upright, fumbling simple tasks, letting emails pile without answer. By midday, my supervisor frowned, then sighed. “You’re no good to us half-asleep. Go home, get some rest.” 

I didn’t argue, but I didn’t really want to go home either. I tried going to a nearby café, two blocks over from my office. 

It was there that my mind finally got some reprieve.

The chatter of strangers, the soft hiss of the espresso machine, the familiar clink of porcelain - all of it wrapped me in a comfort I hadn’t realized I needed. I ordered another coffee, then another, trying to stretch the afternoon out as long as possible. I watched the rain bead against the window, people passing by with their umbrellas, anything to keep my thoughts away from the crack in my basement.

But exhaustion is a patient hunter. 

By the third refill my hands shook with fatigue, and my vision blurred at the edges. I realized, miserably, that I couldn’t outrun sleep forever. When I finally pushed myself up from the table and stepped back into the damp air, the only place left to go was home.

Back in the house, I lay on my sofa, restlessly. The basement kept creeping its way back into my mind.

*What had I really seen? Surely nothing - just a trick of the light, nerves wound tightly by the outage. And yet…*

I sighed, getting up and walking toward the basement door again.

I paced back a forth a few times, before finally committing.

Hesitantly, I turned the knob and descended once more. The air was cool, still. The shelves stood steady, undisturbed. I crouched at the same place, torch in hand, and found the gap utterly ordinary - a thin seam in the stone, no deeper than a foot. Nothing stirred. Nothing stared back.

I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. Everything was normal again. Perfectly, disappointingly normal.

*Just as I had hoped.*

…

That evening, as I was finally getting comfortable again, there was a knock at the door. The same group as before stood on the porch - the women with their practiced smiles, the men carrying covered dishes. I let them in, though something about their presence felt different this time, as if a thread had pulled taut.

They settled in the living room again, chatting lightly, their voices hushed, careful. The food was good, better than I’d expected, but the atmosphere clung close, like damp air. Between mouthfuls, I found myself blurting, “So, what do you all do? For work, I mean. I’ve noticed the mornings are always… quiet.”

The question landed heavier than I intended. For a beat too long, no one answered. Then one of the men chuckled, though it sounded forced. “We keep busy,” he said. Another nodded quickly, adding, “Odd schedules, you know how it is.”

They moved the conversation along before I could press further. Soon after, they excused themselves, leaving behind the remains of the meal and a faint unease that lingered long after the door shut.

I walked them to the porch, waved as they split off toward their homes, then, on impulse, hurried to the window. From behind the curtain, I watched one of the couples - a man in his heavy coat, a woman clutching his arm. They walked without a word, their steps almost too even, too measured. At their door, they didn’t glance around, didn’t fumble with keys, just slipped inside as if the house had opened to them.

I waited, watching the windows for some sign of light or movement. None came. Instead, through a narrow pane near the ground, I saw them descend the stairs. A door opened, a dim glow flickered once - and then they were gone, swallowed by their basement.

*They never came back up.*

…

Sleep became a strained effort from that night onwards.

I kept getting this urge to sit up, and peek out at my neighbors’ homes.

Even when I did commit to sleep, I would constantly startle awake to some faint creaking and rumbling deep in the bowels of the house, and though I told myself it was the house settling, the sound had a way of crawling into my chest and sitting there. 

Every morning, I was gray with exhaustion, my usual coffee just barely keeping me awake.

Work suffered. Several times I nearly nodded off at my desk, once during a meeting. My supervisor suggested I take some time off, “just a week, to clear your head.” I agreed, though I knew no week would be enough.

At home, I found myself glued to the windows. 

I watched the houses like a man waiting for a signal, desperate for proof of life. The lights came on at dusk, glowed steadily until dawn, but not once did I see a curtain twitch or a door open. No one came out for work, no deliveries were ever made, no children played in the yards. Nothing. It was as if the whole street were a set piece, staged for my benefit, while the real activity lay hidden, somewhere.

Perhaps underground.

At night, the noises grew bolder - low thuds, faint clatters, sometimes even the impression of a voice carried through the vents. Each time, I would sit up in bed, heart hammering, staring toward the basement door at the end of the hall. I wanted to go down, to fling it open and see once and for all what waited there. But the thought of facing it froze me in place. Instead, I lay awake until dawn, watching the ceiling, counting every sound, knowing I wouldn’t sleep, 

knowing I couldn’t.

…

The days began to blur together. 

I told myself I was only taking time off to rest, but I hardly left the house. Curtains drawn, lights dimmed, I kept my silent vigil. The neighbors’ windows stared back at me like blind eyes, never once blinking.

I tried to reason it out. Maybe everyone here worked nights. Maybe it was some kind of community agreement - quiet mornings, quiet evenings, nobody making a fuss. But even in saying it, I could hear the falseness. 

I knew what I had seen - or rather what I hadn’t.

I knew the sounds beneath my house weren’t just figments of my imagination.

…

It was in the stillness of one early afternoon that something inside me finally cracked. I had pulled the curtains tight against the light, and in the dimness I noticed it again - that faint, glowing seven-pointed star from the light of the upper window. I’d always thought it charming, once. 

Now?

It looked like an eye, sharp-edged and cruel, glaring down into the room.

*Glaring at me.*

The living room too, felt different. The way the crooked walls leaned in on me, threateningly, conspiring to press the room shut. The ceiling beams that once caught light like beads on a string, pressed down heavily, the joints knotting together in sharp, unnatural angles - less a pattern, but a snare - a geometry that tried to bind me inside it - closing tighter the longer I stared.

And then I saw them again in the dimness: the red specks. 

Tiny pinpricks, barely visible in the darkened corners - one above the archway, another tucked near the ceiling vent, another staring from the hallway like a burning insect. I held my breath, suddenly certain I was not alone.

I rose, slow as if my movements were being watched, and turned toward the nearest light. It was no trick of exhaustion this time. Leaning closer, I saw, nestled in the tangle of a small potted plant, the faint glassy bulge of a lens.

I knew it then. 

I was being watched. 

*They were watching me.* 

The thought struck so sudden I was already moving, stumbling out the door and across the street. My heart thudded like it would split my ribs. I half-expected a curtain to twitch, a shout to stop me—but nothing stirred.

The crooked-shuttered house loomed. I set my hand on the knob. It turned too easily. The lock had clicked, yes, but shallowly, like a toy made only to sound real.

The door swung inward at the faintest push. Inside, the air was cool and stale, as though sealed for years. The living room was tidy—too tidy. A half-read magazine curled yellow on the table, cushions plumped, curtains half-open. It felt staged, preserved, not lived in.

The silence here was heavier than in my own house. Not absence of sound, but absence of life. Every object seemed set slightly apart from itself. My breathing rasped too loud as my gaze fixed on the plain wooden door at the end of the hall.

*The basement.*

I told myself I’d only look, only open it and see. But my hand was already on the knob, already turning. The hinges moaned as I pulled it back. A damp draft curled up from below.

I crouched at the top of the stairs and peered down. The light didn’t reach far - just the first few steps, then shadow. A smell of earth rose up, faintly metallic.

And, steadying myself against the frame, I began to descend.

The steps creaked under my weight, each one louder than the last. I half expected the neighbors to come rushing in, demanding to know what I was doing in their house. But no one came. The air grew colder the farther down I went, the draft sharper against my skin.

The basement was… ordinary. Too ordinary. A washing machine sat in the corner, boxes stacked neatly along the wall, the faint smell of detergent clinging to the stillness. 

For a moment, I almost laughed at myself. Had I really imagined everything?

Of course I hadn’t.

I narrowed my eyes, searching. For what, I wasn’t sure.

And then my sight caught the far wall.

It was there again. The same uneven gap I had in my own basement, the one I had never dared to inspect too closely. A rough seam where the stone and concrete didn’t quite meet, as though the house had been set atop foundations that belonged to something older, something the builders had merely covered rather than disturbed.

I crouched down, pulse jittering against my throat. The gap was wider here, easily large enough to slip a hand through. A breath of cold air pulsed from within, damp and insistent, carrying with it the faintest murmur so faint I couldn’t be sure if it was sound at all, or merely the suggestion of it, shaped by the stone.

I should have turned back. Instead, I pressed my palms against the jagged edges, and the wall shifted. Not much, just enough. Plaster sloughed away in sodden flakes, and beyond it lay a blackness so absolute it seemed to drink the light from the basement.

I don’t know what drove me then - exhaustion, obsession, or some older compulsion seeping out through the crack. Perhaps only the need for finality, the need to force the silence to speak. Whatever it was, I pushed myself forward, scraping through until my shoulders cleared, then my hips, then the soles of my shoes.

And I was inside.

The air was clammy, mineral-heavy, pressing against my lungs. My flashlight shivered over raw stone, catching on lines that didn’t look accidental - rather smooth as if worn down by endless repetition. 

This was a passage.

A tunnel sloped downward at once, a crude incline spiraling into earth. My shoes scraped loose gravel that hissed downslope ahead of me. I hesitated, but the silence behind me felt heavier than what waited below, so I descended.

The air changed as I went. Cooler, yes, but laden too, as if with centuries of dust ground too fine to ever settle. Each breath tasted metallic, faintly briny, as though seawater had long ago seeped into the rock and lingered still.

A sound began to emerge. Not voices, not exactly - more like the collected breath of many people whispering just at the threshold of hearing, not rising or falling but merging into a single tide-pull of sound. I froze, straining to distinguish words. None came. Only that endless susurrus, like waves sucking at shingle, patient and eternal.

Every few steps I looked back. The pale rectangle of the basement was shrinking, already no more than a warped glimmer. My stomach clenched. If that wall sealed itself again - if it had ever been a wall at all - then no one would ever know I was down here.

Still, I kept walking.

I followed the whispering.

The passage twisted illogically, curving left, plunging downward, rising again. My sense of distance unraveled - I could not tell whether I had gone fifty feet or five hundred. The air was cooler still, carrying the musk of confinement, a scent like bodies packed too close together in the dark, though none were there.

Then, at the precipice of nausea and misdirection - I noticed it: a hairline crack in the tunnel wall, faintly familiar. I leaned closer, pressing my eye against it, and my heart lurched. 

On the other side of the thin veil of earth was a room I knew too well. The bare concrete floor, the slant of the steps, the jumble of paint cans in the corner. 

My basement.

The whispers swelled, as if pleased by my recognition. For a mad instant, I felt like they were urging me onward, coaxing me deeper into the labyrinth that stitched neighbor to neighbor, home to home, until perhaps the whole street was webbed together in a single buried artery.

Following the noise, I eventually squeezed through a narrow cleft in the stone, the rough edges rasping my shoulders and peeling cloth from my sleeves, finding myself in a vast chamber.

The air hit me like damp wool; heavy, wet, and sour with the layered stench of decay. The ceiling hung so low I had to stoop, its surface bristling with roots and beads of black condensation that fattened and burst with slow, deliberate ticks. Candles jammed into fissures spat and wept down their stubs, their glow smeared and multiplied in the sweat of the stone. Shadows leaned unnaturally long, folding and overlapping until they seemed to bend around some hidden core, as though the walls themselves recoiled from illumination.

On the earthen floor lay six bodies, each arranged with care along the prongs of a vast figure gouged into the soil. Death had marked each differently: one collapsed into an articulated cage of bone still wearing the husk of a funeral suit, another shriveled to a leathern skin that clung tight as drumhide, another bloated with the greenish swell of half-preserved flesh. A slick of fat glistened at the jaw of one, hardened to yellow wax where it touched the dirt. The mingled odors of sweet corruption, dry mildew, and old earth rolled together into something nauseating but almost reverent, like incense turned sour.

The seventh space gaped empty, its soil churned with fresh scarring, as though impatient hands had redrawn the lines again and again, sharpening the groove to accept what must soon complete it.

Then I looked up.

The walls were crowded with photographs - whole families smiling stiffly on front porches, children’s portraits, candid shots from kitchens and backyards. Beneath them, yellowed leases, school certificates, and utility bills were pinned in meticulous rows. One cluster of images showed a man and woman whose features matched two of the bodies on the ground. Another cluster matched the others.

And then, farther along, I saw my own face. My parents. My siblings. My résumé. Copies of letters I’d written years ago. Camera feeds flickered above it all: my living room, my bedroom, my basement stairs.

The pattern was undeniable. These were the former residents of my house.

I shuddered to think what that meant for me.

Around the chamber’s edge, the neighbors stood in a ring, their faces half-lost in the glow, lips working in a ceaseless chant. The sound was not speech so much as grinding cadence: breath drawn ragged, consonants bitten short, syllables collapsing into one another until they became a shingle of sound that scraped the ear raw.

I pressed myself against the damp, sticky wall, hardly daring to breathe. Their voices rose and fell in uneven cadence, half-prayer, half-conversation, like a crowd rehearsing lines from different plays.

“He suspects.”

“No matter. Tonight he belongs.”

“To our lord.”

Then, cutting through the babble, came a tone I knew at once: calm, polished, practiced.

The realtor.

The same voice that had once praised crown molding and promised a “house with character.” Smooth, unshakable, the voice of someone who never failed to close a deal.

“His place has been waiting,” she said, her words rounded and precise. “The walls already know his name. Our lord already knows his name.”

“They resisted too,” murmured a man, almost sheepish.

“They fought,” said another.

“They wept,” sighed a third, almost fond.

“But all children sleep, in the end.”

“As will the seventh,” the realtor replied, rising above them.

 “And when the seventh sleeps, the circle will be complete. Our lord will breathe through his lungs.”

“Our lord will see through his eyes.”

A low murmur rippled through the circle - threads of hunger, relief, longing, tangled together.

“He is close.”

“He is ready.”

“He will open the way.”

Silence fell, sudden and crushing, as though the air itself had been sucked from the chamber. Only the faint hiss of a candle remained.

My hand slipped against a loose stone. It clattered to the floor - small, ordinary, but in that silence it exploded like a gunshot.

The murmurs died. No one moved.

“…Did you hear that?” a voice whispered.

The silence deepened, shivering, brittle. Then, all at once, every head in the circle turned. Not one after another - all together, too fast, too clean, like marionettes jerked on the same string.

Dozens of blank eyes, glinting in candlelight, fixed on the dark where I crouched.

For a heartbeat, the whole room held its breath. Then the realtor’s voice, soft as velvet closing over a coffin lid:

*“He is here.”*

Adrenaline seized me like a hand on my spine. I lurched upright and bolted, stone skinning my arms as I tore down the passage. Behind me came the shuffle of shoes on earth - not frantic, not clumsy, but steady. Too steady. Dozens of feet striking in perfect unison, every step slamming the chamber like a drumbeat inside my skull.

Then the voices followed, slipping between the rhythm of their march like oil through cloth.

*“Don’t run,”* one said, hollow and even, *“We don’t want you hurting yourself.”*

*“Everything will be okay,”* crooned another, the syllables thick and honey-slow.

The tunnel pressed in tighter, my vision strobing at the edges. I dropped to my knees, palms skidding on damp stone, groping for the slit of light I swore had been there - my basement, my way out.

Behind me the footsteps never faltered, filling the space, filling me, their march and my blood now one deafening rhythm, a heartbeat not my own.

I shoved a shoulder into the gap, bone grinding against rock. The stone tore at my clothes, bit into my skin. For a moment I was wedged - ribs caught, lungs clenching, the earth holding me fast.

The voices drifted closer, weaving between each other like a lullaby.

*“Come back.”*

*“You don’t have to be afraid.”*

I clawed forward, skin peeling, breath shredding in my throat. My hips caught next, and I had to twist, spine screaming, until the stone finally released me with a soundless scrape.

I spilled through at last, sprawling across the cold slab of my basement floor, the sting of torn flesh sharp in the air.

Behind me, the voices did not raise or falter. They seeped through the crack as though the wall itself were speaking, steady as a prayer.

I stumbled up from the basement, clawing for balance, crashing through the kitchen and down the hall. Every breath was a rasp, every step dragging a streak of grit and blood across the floorboards.

The door loomed before me - simple, familiar, absurd in its ordinariness. The frosted glass glowed faintly, a pale imitation of daylight. Safety. Escape. Life.

I seized the knob with both hands, slick with sweat and blood. It turned, yes - it turned like it always had. But when I pulled, the house answered.

Clack.

Not the dull, human sound of a deadbolt. No. This was sharper, metallic, hungry. A sound like teeth closing around bone.

The seams along the frame shuddered. The wood moaned, fibers tightening like sinew, as if the whole house clenched at once to hold me inside.

*“No, no, no-”* My own voice came back to me, ragged and unrecognizable.

I rushed back to the basement door and threw the bolt, then dragged a shelf into place, books and tools crashing to the floor in a rain of useless clatter.

For a moment, silence. Only my pulse in my ears.

Then - the sound of the knob turning, softly, patiently. A creak, then a slow knock. Three measured raps.

Murmurs from behind the wood, sweet and stale.

*“Don’t lock us out.”*

*“We all belong here together.”*

Panic clawed higher in my throat. I staggered through the hall, into the kitchen, grabbing at the back door. The knob twisted beneath my palm, but the same click followed - the wood tightening as if bracing itself to hold me in.

A shape caught my eye - motion at the window.

I turned.

Across the yard, my neighbor was stepping from his porch, stiff and deliberate, eyes fixed on me. Then another, and another. They crossed the lawn without a sound, gathering along my house.

They pressed themselves to the windows.

Every one of them.

Palms spread flat. Faces leaned close, cheek to pane. Their eyes stared through at me, unblinking, catching the faint light in strange reflections that looked too bright, too wet.

A dozen mouths moved at once, muffled by the glass, whispering things I couldn’t make out, but all of them smiling, all of them watching.

The whispers overlapped, swelled, some voices turning sharp, almost scolding

*“Stop it. Stop it.”*

*“Our lord won’t be happy with you.”*

Others curled into a cloying sing-song, 

*“Don’t worry, sweetheart. You’re safe here. We’ll take care of you.”*

The house vibrated with it, the glass humming faintly as their breath fogged the panes. Smiles stretched too wide, too steady, splitting into snarls and croons.

I stumbled back, heart hammering, staring at the impossible wall of faces around me. Every window on the first floor was filled. I was sealed inside, trapped in my own house, their voices clawing at me from all directions.

Panic seized me. My eyes shot upward - the stairs. The bedroom.

I bolted, two steps at a time, my body lurching forward as if chased by the noise swelling below. I burst into my room, chest heaving, and grabbed at the curtain.

Outside: my car, parked at the curb. My only chance.

For a moment I froze, the chanting rising beneath me, swelling into something that wasn’t words anymore, just a pressure in my skull.

Then I drove my heel into the glass.

It shattered around me in an explosion of cold shards, the afternoon air slicing my face. Without another thought I hurled myself through, down onto the pavement.

The pain was immediate, white-hot, snapping through my leg like fire. My ankle folded under me with a sickening crack. I screamed, or thought I did - the sound drowned in the roar of blood in my ears.

I rolled onto my side, vision warping, breath hitching against the shock. The night smelled of iron and dust, my face wet where glass had sliced it.

*Move. Move.*

My car loomed just yards away, unreal and shining under the streetlight. I clawed across the lawn, dragging my useless leg, grass slick beneath my palms. Every shift of my weight sent agony screaming up my body, but the chanting from the house was louder now, echoing out through the broken window, their voices a chorus spilling into the night:

“Come back.”

“You’re safe with us.”

“Don’t run.”

“He is waiting for you.”

I hit the curb, fumbling at my pocket, keys slick with blood. Somehow I got them into the lock. Somehow I turned. The handle gave, and I dragged myself inside, collapsing against the steering wheel, gasping, the horn blaring once in a long, muffled note.

The house behind me pulsed with voices, calling, pleading, demanding.

Then the sound changed. No longer steady, no longer coaxing - it broke apart. Ragged sobs, hiccupping wails, voices tearing themselves raw. Some keened like children. Others moaned low and guttural, as though their throats were splitting under the strain.

And their mouths - God, their mouths. Lips quivering, stretching too wide, some grinning, some crumpled into masks of grief, every face vibrating with need. The voices overlapped until words were nothing but noise, then reassembled, jagged and broken:

*“Our lord needs you.”*

*“Our lord needs your body.”*

*“What will our lord do without you?”*

Some shrieked it high and thin, others crooned it like nursery songs, syllables slurring through their sobs. It was a chorus of grief, of hunger, of worship. A sound that didn’t belong in human throats.

The nearest neighbor pressed her face against the windshield, teeth bared in a rictus that was half a smile, half a sob. Her breath fogged the glass in frantic bursts, and she dragged her tongue across it, leaving a wet smear that ran down like tears.

*“Don’t leave us.”*

*“Don’t leave him.”*

*“Don’t leave.”*

Their wailing rattled the street, a dirge swelling until it shook the engine itself.

I twisted the key - once, twice. My ankle throbbed like fire, the pain snapping my vision white, but I forced it again. The engine coughed, sputtered - then roared.

As I slammed the pedal, the car lurched forward, wheels thudding over bodies that broke apart too easily, like brittle effigies stuffed with wet leaves.

In the rearview mirror they collapsed to their knees, clawing at the pavement, arms outstretched, their cries echoing after me: not anger, not threat. 

Just a howling, endless grief.

I didn’t stop driving until the houses thinned, until the highway signs gave way to the smear of city lights. Every throb of my ankle was a reminder that I wasn’t dreaming. I pushed until the tank hit red and found a cheap motel off the interstate, the kind with buzzing neon and a clerk who didn’t bother to look up.

For three nights I barely slept. Curtains drawn tight, TV humming low. Every time I closed my eyes I saw the glass, the mouths, the way their palms pressed against me like the house itself was breathing. I lived off vending machine snacks and the emergency cash I’d crammed in my glovebox months ago and forgotten.

On the fourth morning I couldn’t stand it anymore. My leg was swollen purple, every nerve screaming, and I knew I had to tell someone. Anyone.

The police station was fluorescent and humming, antiseptic in a way that almost calmed me. I stood at the counter, swaying on my good foot, and when the officer asked what was wrong, the words tumbled out.

“There were people, they - they were at my house, they wouldn’t let me leave, they knew my name, they said things about a lord, I think they wanted to sacrifice me to it, they-”

My voice broke. I gripped the counter, knuckles white, trying to steady my breath. The officer gave me that look, the careful, measured one they must practice for drunks and lunatics.

And then my gaze drifted - just for a moment - to the badge on his chest.

And I froze.

The badge gleamed under the light, sharper than it should, every line too clear.

I’d seen them before. Hell, maybe this one had always been like that. But looking at it now, it seemed wrong - too perfect, too deliberate, each point cutting the air like a blade.

“…Was it…” My throat closed. I forced the words out.

*“…Was it always a seven-pointed star?”*
