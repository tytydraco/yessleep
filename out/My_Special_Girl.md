Hello!  I’m Cindy (34F), and my daughter Liliana (6F) has some unexplainable…  um, quirks (?) that I’d really like to open up about. And hopefully get some advice on, if any of y’all can relate to having a unique kiddo!

My post got removed from all those parenting forums - I’m very new to Reddit and not the most tech-savvy! But I heard *this* was the good place to post our story instead. This is where people congregate to talk about all our spooky little truths, right?

Basically,  Lili was born a totally normal, bouncing baby girl. Shining blue eyes, hair like ringlets of cornsilk, always a big ol’ smile on her dimpled face. She was the loveliest little dumpling you’ve ever seen, and still is. 

Plus, my girl has always been smart as a whip. She could let us know exactly  what she wanted from the time she was probably 7 months old. Not verbally - she barely uses words at all, actually. Lili prefers to communicate through her expressions. She’s good at it, too. She gives me a look, and I just know. It’s like the words are clear in her little brain, and she just moves ‘em right over to mine!

And, honest to goodness, even as a baby the girl barely even cried - she’s way too polite for that. Those big Bambi eyes would just ask, *Steak please,  Mama?* And I’d reply, “Dinner’s on the way, baby doll!”  

My  husband Blake and I were so proud. I mean, his brother has 7 crazy kids, and - bless their little hearts - there‘s probably one single brain cell shared by the whole litter. But our baby was a genius!

It wasn’t until one night, when Lili was about 3, that things got weird. I’d just kissed her goodnight, turned on her Elsa light and tucked her in. She was giving me a content grin, her eyelids sleepily falling shut, as I moved to leave. But just as I reached for the door, Lili suddenly looked straight in my eyes and started *screaming*. I mean, she was hollering something *wild!* It was like nothing I’d ever heard before -  some crazy babble that sure as heck was not English. Shocked, I screamed too, still frozen in place. But Blake ran in, shook her hard, and she snapped out of it. Honestly, the poor girl just looked confused at our reaction. 

First time parents and all, we frantically called the pediatrician, but he shrugged it off. Just a night terror, he said - those are common around her age. 

Except it kept happening. Week after week, month after month, the second we’d turn out the lights. At first, we tried keeping them on, leaving Lili’s surroundings bright at all hours. It worked for bedtime - but a few hours later, we’d jolt awake to shrieks and see a bedroom encased in darkness. That was the spookiest part. 

Especially because, when we’d race in, Lili wouldn’t be lying in bed anymore. 

She’d be suspended in the air.

My baby would be wide-eyed and floating a foot above her bed as rhythmic, unintelligible phrases pouring out of her mouth in a guttural screech. 

I know, you’re thinking this should be a big deal. 

But listen - when we’d grab her, she’d float peacefully back down to her bed, softly sighing with closed eyes. It was as if she’d been in a deep  sleep the whole time. So it freaked us out, of course, but Lili was a happy little girl for 90% of the day. Besides, her unspoken communication was getting better and better! By this point, she was easily telling us long monologues of intelligent thought without ever opening her mouth. Blake and I figured she just had a few extra talents, some of which were a little advanced for us. 

However, one person did not agree - Blake’s mama. A proper Southern lady, Ms. Audrey visited us for a week and decided she ruled the roost. The look on her face when she saw Lili’s night terrors - you would’ve thought she’d seen a ghost! 

It  took a moment of prayer and a tall glass of brandy to steady her, but as soon as she regained speech, Ms. Audrey started insisting we take  Liliana to church. And our little sunshine happily obliged. 

On Lili’s first Sunday morning service, she sat daintily in the pew like a princess, listened intently to the pastor without a fuss. The whole congregation cooed over how adorable she was, how calm. They looked at her like she was an angel. 

Which is good, I guess. Because it meant that nobody even spared her a second glance when things got… chaotic. 

But really - who’s gonna blame a preschooler for the simultaneous shattering of every stained glass window in the building? 

Officially, it was a “structural failure”. Still though, it effectively ended our church days. I guess I understand how it was a little scary for Lili to hear the sermon turn to “repelling demonic forces”. But either way, Blake and I had a stern conversation with her about positive and negative outlets. 

This  event clearly spooked Ms. Audrey to her core, however. I once caught her sprinkling Liliana with holy water - goodness knows where she even got the stuff, we’re Baptists - but to her chagrin, Lili only shook it off, grabbing the sink nozzle. *Water fight, Meemaw!*

Fast forward to her sixth birthday, when baby girl asked for a BBQ with the neighborhood kids. Lili is homeschooled (she’s way too smart for regular school, obviously) and doesn’t get much of a chance to play with her peers. Plus, she still doesn’t talk too often, and even though she could run mental circles around these kids, I don’t want her to miss out on friends. So I sent out some invitations, put the decorations up, and went shopping for some good fixings.

The night before the party, Blake was working late. So when there was a knock on the door, the last person I expected was Ms. Audrey. But there she was, looking uncharacteristically disheveled. White hair falling from her bun, she ranted and raved about Lili with breath that stunk of booze. 

“She’s darksided!”

“She’s possessed!”

“You need to eradicate the demons from your house!”

Sighing, I pushed my mother in law aside, ordered her to sleep it off in the guest room. After all, not my mama, not my job. Barely lucid and clearly overwhelmed, Ms. Audrey stumbled up the stairs.

And it all would’ve been okay, except it was at this exact moment that Lili’s night terrors started. 

Under my daughter’s mysterious screams echoing off the walls, I vaguely detected Ms Audrey’s steps quickening to a sprint. 

*Sprinting up to Lili’s room.* 

A  sense of foreboding sending lightning through my blood, I hauled ass after her. But the woman had been halfway up the stairs when she’d started the race - as I finally skidded into the hallway, I watched my baby’s door slam shut. It was locked tight behind my mother in law. 

And then I heard Liliana’s screams cut off. 

Suddenly  I was the one hollering, pounding on the door, begging her to let me  in. Behind it, I heard hysterical tones of drunken rage, the smack of  grown fingers gripping tender flesh.

10,  20, 30 seconds passed. Each moment punctuated by my fight against the unyielding wood that separated me from my endangered child. 

And then there was nothing but a horrible silence. 

Sobbing in terror, I placed one final, hysterical kick to the door.  And it opened. It drifted ajar as easily and casually as if I had turned an unlocked doorknob.  

I scanned the room slowly, almost unsure if I wanted to see the outcome. My eyes passed familiar pink walls, a little bookshelf, a full hamper. Heart pounding, I realized my daughters bedroom appeared  completely normal.

And sitting calmly on the bed, the room was empty except for Liliana - her trademark dimpled smile adorning her precious face. Blond curls still tied in her protective braid. Round blue eyes gleaming with satisfaction. A darkening, hand-shaped bruise forming on her neck. 

And deep red blood that was not her own, dripping in a steady stream from her lips and hands. 

…

You know, I’m aware that my daughter may be a little different. Maybe even a “demon”. Whatever you want to call it.

But at this point, all I’m worried about is that she won’t eat a thing anymore!

Although she keeps repeating that she’s full, Lili’s thoughts are excited enough  today that I can tell what’s really got her mouth watering - Mr Collins from down the street. That man’s got a lot of meat on his bones. Plus, those kids of his always seem to have unexplained bruises. 

Cruelty does have its consequences, after all. 

I guess my main question for y’all is this - is human flesh alone really a sufficient diet for a six year old? Do you think I should be encouraging vegetables  and vitamins on top of protein? I don’t want her to have nutrient deficiencies. If anyone has any experience here, please let me know!

And don’t fret, I’m not worried about our anonymity. After all, my family has a pretty strong bond. If anyone tries to harm or report any one of us… well, I don’t think Lili would think twice about taking it into her own hands. 

Anywho, I’d love to talk to any other mamas of special kiddos - I know Lili would just loooove a playmate :)))
