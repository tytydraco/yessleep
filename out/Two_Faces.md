David was so gentle with me after the incident. So kind. He brought me flowers in the hospital, and stayed by my side constantly.

I admit, I did suspect the reason he was being so sweet was partially out of guilt for not taking me seriously. 

I knew that I had a stalker. I tried to tell David, too, and the police.

I told them about the threatening notes and personal items that went missing. For some reason they all thought that it was a harmless prank, and nothing was done.

The doctors had a hard time piecing my face back together after the incident. The knife had searched everywhere from the chin up. 

The shame and powerlessness I felt when I saw the pity in my family members eyes was almost as unbearable as the pain. 

David was the only one who still treated me like a whole human. He saw past the bloody bandages and still loved me for me.

I never saw my attacker’s face, so I didn’t know who to trust and barely left the house. 

We eventually decided to move to a new city. I was excited for the fresh start, away from the tainted memories. 

It was good, for a while. I saw a therapist to process what had happened and joined a support group. I started actually feeling better.

Then, I started getting the notes again. On my car, on my doorstep. 

We installed a security system and I secretly bought a gun. David thought we should get a dog but I didn’t want to risk that psycho hurting a puppy on my watch. 

We sent all the notes to the police, but they couldn’t find any prints. The last one simply read, **the feet are next**.

David held me through the panic attacks. The tears didn’t sting anymore, at least. 

A week after the last note was sent I decided a project would help clear my mind. I decided to organize and dust David’s antique collection. 

He hates when people go near his antiques without supervision, however I’d helped him clean them before and know how to do it properly. 

I was dusting an old grandfather clock when something caught my eye. A glimmer of red, the tiniest piece of fabric peeking out of the face. 

The color was familiar. The sight of it made my stomach tilt. *No, it couldn’t be.* With trembling fingers I worked the clock face open. The contents inside confirmed my deepest fears. 

The items that had gone missing from the beach, the library, my car. 

The red fabric was from a summer bikini. I remembered the way David had looked at me when he saw me in it. The dark glint in his eyes. 

“No. No!” It was a cascade of memories then. The times he would brush it off when something went missing, the notes that had a little too much personal information. 

I tore through the rest of the antiques like a mad woman and found confirmation. Note paper identical to the threatening messages, and a blood stained knife. I remembered it’s jagged edges well.

I couldn’t breathe for a whole minute. Stale air seemed trapped in my lungs. 

My world turned upside down, again. I left my mind for a moment. When I finally came to my senses, I didn’t cry. I didn’t scream or dry heave or any of the things I wanted to do.

Instead, I made his favorite, pot roast. I brought out the good wine and lit some nice candles for the table. 

When I heard the sound of his tires on gravel I picked out the perfect frying pan for my purposes. 

I heard the front door open and called him to the kitchen. 

The moment his face came into view I smiled at him, sweet as pie. He didn’t have time to smile back before the pan made contact with his face. 

He woke up hours later, hands and feet bound. He noticed me standing above him with a neutral expression. 

“What are you gonna do?” It was obvious he knew I had found him out. His voice held pain and fear, though not enough for my liking. 

“You already know what I’m gonna do.” I smiled and held up the blood stained knife. “**The feet are next.**”
