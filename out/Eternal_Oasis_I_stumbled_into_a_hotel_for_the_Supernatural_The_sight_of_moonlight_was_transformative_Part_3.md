It took two whole days and copious amounts of toothbrushing to rid my mouth of the taste of blood. The fact that Conrad’s addiction went from drugs to blood was both ironic and saddening. Even in “death” he was never able to escape his vices. They were simply replaced with something else. That dream still plagues my mind today. It’s like his strangled cries are seared into my brain, branded into my very being. The rest of that morning didn’t play out much better. In fact, that dream was just the beginning.  
  
“Winnie?” Noah whispered. “Are you awake?”  
  
I was wide awake… Insomnia held me captive, but it wasn’t anything that I wasn’t already familiar with. My dreams were far scarier than my reality. But then again, that was before I met the rest of the guests that resided at the hotel. Little did I know, that was going to change quicker than Noah and I were ready for, catapulting us into a world that neither of us understood.  
  
“Noah?” I patted the empty side of the bed. “What are you doing up?”  
  
“I couldn’t sleep,” he said as he joined me. “This place freaks me out.”  
  
It was dark, but I could see the outline of him shimmying underneath the covers. “Do you think it’s safe here?”  
  
I chewed on my bottom lip for a second before I responded. “I don’t know.”   
  
My eyes flitted towards his. A little moonlight crept in, tiptoeing across the hardwood floor and spilling the tiniest bit of light into the room. I could see Noah’s hair, messy and tousled, his forehead neatly bandaged. That wreck had given him a nasty gash, and I was sure that it would leave a significant scar.  
  
“How does your head feel?” My hand reached out to gingerly brush over the bandage.  
  
Noah’s face twisted up, a quiet hiss of pain floating from his lips. I quickly retracted my hand, instantly apologizing, but he was quick to grip it within his own, his thumb gently brushing over the top of my hand. “Hey, don’t worry about it. It’s still a little-”  
  
*“Sore.” Noah cringed, the hint of tears blurring his vision. His knee was scraped and bloody, the skin raw and red.*  
  
*“Noah!” I screeched as I plopped down on the grass in front of him, little pigtails cascading over my shoulders. “I told you it was a bad idea to climb that tree.”*  
  
*Noah bit back the pain and forced out a chuckle instead. “Ah, come on Winnie! You’re just a scaredy cat.” He smirked, his chin lifting ever so slightly before he pointed to the little yellow ball a couple feet away from him. “Besides, it’s not like you would have climbed  up there to grab it.”*  
  
“Winnie?” Noah’s hand released mine, his brows furrowed, worry creasing his forehead.  
  
I couldn’t concentrate on his words, though. They felt so far away, like he was yelling into a well and I was at the very bottom. In fact, my mind was somewhere else completely. The moment he had gripped my hand, something strange happened. Something that only happened in my dreams. It was like a flash of light, a small flicker, like a lighter igniting, the flame appearing for only a split second before it was snuffed out. It was a glimpse into his past. *Our* past.  
  
“Winnie?” he questioned again. My mind was still foggy when he pulled me over to him, holding me close, kind of like he did when we were kids and I’d had a nightmare. His hand held mine, brown eyes peering at me with concern before he said, “Are you-”  
  
*“Okay?” Noah called out to me from the bottom bunk of the bed.*  
  
*A cold sweat broke out on my forehead as I trembled, my legs twisted in the bed sheets. I had another nightmare.*  
  
*“Noah?” I asked, my bottom lip quivering. “I know your mom said that we’re not supposed to share the bed when I stay the night, but…” Large, hot tears raced down my face, “Can you please come sit up here with me for a little bit?”*  
  
*Without another word, I watched as he climbed up to the top bunk, slipping under the covers and pulling me into the warmth of his embrace. “Hey, shhh…” he whispered in an attempt to stop my tears.*  
  
*My head rested on his chest, the steady sound of his heartbeat and the rise and fall of his chest calming me down.*  
  
*His hands brushed back strands of my tangled hair as I closed my eyes and tried to drift back to sleep. His voice was like the calm in the storm. “Everything’s going to be-”*  
  
“Alright,” Noah said, his words a quiet hush.  
  
My hands flew to my face, tears wet on my cheeks. Confusion bloomed from within me. Had I been crying in the present too?  
  
“Noah?” I whispered, leaning into his embrace. “Can you stay here the rest of the night?”  
  
A warm breath blew across the top of my head, ruffling my hair before he responded, “Of course. Whatever you need.”  
  
Right then, I needed my best friend. And I couldn’t have been more glad to have him.  
  
\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~  
  
When I finally woke up that morning, it wasn’t to birds tweeting, or alarm clocks blaring or even some horrific nightmare. I was still folded in Noah’s arms, one of them protectively draped across my waist, when I heard someone *very* loudly clear their throat.  
  
“Can you two please get up already?” an annoyed Conrad muttered, his arms crossed.  
  
“Excuse me?” I wiggled out from under Noah’s arm, throwing the covers aside.  
  
“Are you deaf or stupid?” he scoffed, his sharpened teeth peeking out just the slightest when he smirked. “And tell your little friend to put some clothes on.”  
  
I quirked a brow before turning back towards Noah. He was just now beginning to wake up, the expression on his face slightly confused. My eyes moved down to his chest. He was shirtless, only donning a pair of gray sweats. A slight blush bloomed across my cheeks.  
  
Noah was now up, hands running through his messy hair in an attempt to tame it.  
  
“Yeah, you can start by putting some clothes on.” He paused, pointing over to the chest at the end of the bed. “There’s a change of clean clothes sitting on top of that. Put them on and head downstairs. We need to talk about what we’re going to do with you two.”  
  
“What do you mean?” Noah asked, trudging over to the chest and tossing me my set of clothing. “You’re not going to do anything other than show us the front door so we can get the heck out of this-”  
  
“Hellhole?” Conrad finished, a mischievous gleam in his eyes. “Sorry, you’re stuck here until we can think of how to handle this. You both know way more than any human should.”  
  
A stray thought roamed into my mind… If only he knew just *how much* I knew. The dream from last night crept back in my mind, the taste of blood staining my mouth.  
  
“Listen man,” Noah stalked over to Conrad, both of the men standing dangerously close to one another. “You can do whatever you want with me, but if you lay one finger on Winnie-”  
  
“And what if I *want* to lay a finger on her?” Conrad challenged. “What then?”   
  
His lip twitched, eyes glancing in my direction for only a second, a Cheshire cat grin revealing his fangs once again. And in a teasing little show, I watched as his tongue slid over them for a moment before he turned his attention back towards Noah.   
  
A deep blush bloomed across my face before my eyes widened and my mouth opened in protest.  
  
***Smack***  
  
Noah’s balled fist landed right in Conrad’s palm. He was fuming. His jaw was clenched tight, the muscles in his arm tense. On the contrary, Conrad’s eyes almost seemed to glow. He was enjoying this…  
  
Noah grumbled, his words gritting out between clenched teeth. “You sick piece of-”  
  
“BOYS!” someone yelled, the melodic tone of her voice making everyone pause. “Stop all this bickering. It’s freaking stupid and I’m tired of hearing it.”  
  
“You,” she pointed towards Conrad. “Take Winnie to see Rai. Her leg still looks pretty gnarly. Looks like she might have accidentally yanked out some of her stitches.”   
  
My eyes trailed down to my calf, the bandage a bright red.  
  
“And you,” she nodded towards Noah. “My name’s Cassandra, but you can just call me Cass. Come with me. I’m going to check your head dressing and get it cleaned up a little bit.”  
  
Noah wanted to argue with her. I could see it. “But I-”  
  
The slim redhead was quick to cut him off. “She’ll be just fine. I promise.”  
  
With a glance in Conrad’s direction, she narrowed her eyes into a glare and said, “Right, Conrad?”  
  
A wicked grin curled at his lips as he leaned against the bedpost. “Sure, I can play nice.” He paused, winking at Cass. “I don’t bite… Unless I’m hungry.”  
  
“Conrad,” Cass warned, her eyes shooting daggers at him.  
  
He held his hands up in surrender and chuckled, “I’m kidding! Besides, I already ate anyway!”  
  
With a roll of her eyes, she pointed a finger at Noah, and then hooked it back in her direction. “C’mon. I promise he’s more bark than bite.”  
  
“The only one who barks around here is Rai,” Conrad quipped back, “and I think he chases his tail in his free time.”  
  
“Can you just shut up?” Cass yelled, rubbing the bridge of her nose.  
  
Noah turned to me, a silent question in his eyes that seemed to say, *“Are you sure you’re okay with me leaving you with that psychopath?”*  
  
I nodded, shooing him onward with a small smile. When the both of them were finally out the door though, Conrad was quick to make another smart remark.  
  
“You know,” he started. “You do look pretty delicious, actually… Surely a taste wouldn’t hurt.”  
  
He was on me lightning fast, my back pressed up against the wall, his imposing presence freezing me in place. My heart was pounding and my breathing was raspy. Warning bells rang in my head as his lips drew closer to my ear.  
  
“Winnie…” he whispered, the warmth of his breath fanning out along the lobe of my ear, spreading goosebumps along my neck. “You smell absolutely *divine*.”  
  
Something strange washed over me, a feeling I couldn't quite explain. A warmth that tingled all the way down to my toes. Despite being scared, I was almost sort of-  
  
“**Conrad**.” A different voice caught both our attention, the two of us whipping our heads towards the door. Whoever was standing there had such a commanding presence that it was frightening.  
  
“Oh, come now, Rai! I was just having a little fun.” Conrad slowly slinked away from me, that overwhelming feeling starting to dissipate.  
  
Rai’s hulking form towered over the doorway, his shirt stretched taut against his chest as he folded his arms and stared us down. “Come on.” He nodded in my direction, beckoning me forward before he fixed his steely eyed gaze back at Conrad. “Quit messing around. We don’t have time for games.”  
  
With a nonchalant shrug, Conrad shoved past him, sparing us one last glance, his fingers coming up to his forehead in a salute. “I’ll see you around… Little treat.” He then paused, his finger coming up to flick the little silver dog tag that hung from around Rai’s neck. “Go choke on a dog toy.”  
  
Rai growled lowly, flashing him a middle finger before he hurriedly snatched my arm, guiding me down the hallway in the opposite direction. His legs made such large strides that it took all I had to keep up. The moment that his hand slid down my arm and gripped mine though, I once again felt my reality crumbling as I was transported back to a memory. Rai’s voice sounded like I was going through a wind tunnel, but I faintly heard it.  
  
“Don’t mind him, he’s just a filthy-”  
  
*“Dog,” the man spat, his large, meaty paws slapping a small boy across the face.*  
  
*Because I was so disoriented, it didn’t register at first who the boy was, until I saw the picture hanging on the wall in his - our- peripheral vision. Rai… He couldn’t have been more than 12 years old. He looked just like his mother. Jet black hair, seafoam green eyes… Even the lopsided grin.*  
  
*“Look at her, boy. Look at what you made me do!” His breath was hot against our face. “Do you even realize how strong the bonds between mates are?! And I killed her! For you!” Rai’s father pointed a finger towards the kitchen. “Look at her!”*  
  
*Rai’s eyes watered, tears threatening to break loose. “NO,” he ground out, his hands scrunched into fists.*  
  
***SLAP***  
  
*Warmth trickled from his nose, a hiss of pain escaping his lips.*  
  
*“I refuse to raise a weak* ***pup*** *for a son,” he roared. “You are the blood of my blood, and she was only getting in the way.” He paused only a moment before he reminded him of his birthright. This was something he had done since the day he was born. “You are an alpha! And your mother was a weak little whore!”*  
  
*“Don’t talk about her like that,” he snarled, his upper lip revealing tiny incisors.*  
  
***SLAP***  
  
*A sickening crunch and the pain that I felt afterwards was all I needed to know that he had broken Rai’s nose. The trickle of blood from before was now a waterfall, crimson coating his upper lip and sliding down his chin as he held back a sob.*  
  
*“She was making you weak…” he seethed, his hand gripping the front of Rai’s shirt and lifting him to eye level. His father was monstrously tall, and Rai’s feet were dangling high above the ground.*  
  
*He shoved Rai up against the wall, glaring at his son, steely gray eyes brewing with a ferocity that he was all too familiar with.*  
  
*“Look at me, boy.”*  
  
*Rai refused, shaking his head.*  
  
*“LOOK. AT. ME,” his father ground out, teeth tightly clenched.*  
  
*Fury bubbled from within him, multiplying so fast that he couldn’t even stop himself from doing what he did next.*  
  
*Spit trailed down his father’s face in a slow, steady stream. But instead of the reaction he expected, his father stood there, staring at him. And when Rai finally met his eyes, brows furrowed in determination, his father spoke.*  
  
*“Look at your mother… Look at what’s left of her or you’re no longer my son.”*  
  
*He knew that she was a bloodied mess slumped against the kitchen table, a ghost of herself, and he didn’t need his eyes to tell him that. Everytime he closed them, he could still hear her pleading, her screaming, her struggle, but he wasn’t strong enough to protect her. He had failed. Guilt clawed at his insides, but he shoved it aside.*  
  
*“Go to hell,” he seethed, hair sprouting along his arms, his claws elongated as he fought back the urge to shift, his anger flaring brighter and brighter.*  
  
*With a single swipe, his father’s claws tore across his face, shattering what was left of his wife. Rai looked just like her, a constant reminder, and it disgusted him. I could feel it. The pain… It was excruciating. The feeling of flesh tearing and the sound of Rai’s shrieking as his father yanked him out of the house and dragged him deep into the woods.*   
  
*When he stopped, it was just before he got to the road, still within the safe confines of the treeline. But when he finally threw Rai onto the ground, he only had the chance to cry out one last time before his father knocked him nearly unconscious, his sharpened claws shredding his back into thin, jagged ribbons before abandoning him in a ditch.*   
  
*My own consciousness flickered as Rai’s body convulsed violently on the ground. Confusion bubbled up within me until I noticed the glow of something illuminating the night sky. A full moon gleamed down on him, on me, until what lay there instead wasn’t a boy at all, but something sort of… In between?*  
  
*I don’t know how long we laid there, but I do know that when Rai finally came to, the pain we felt was immeasurable… Dried blood had crusted to his face, and each time he tried to stand, he fell to his knees. The throbbing in his back was almost enough to make him vomit. A choked sob left his lips as something strange started to happen.*   
  
*The pain that we were experiencing before was excruciating, but this was unlike anything I’d ever experienced. It was like it had splintered everything that he was into tiny fragments and crushed them up into a fine powder. In fact, it pulsed through his veins, changing the very fiber of his being. And it was some time during that moment that Rai’s agonized screams alerted someone of his whereabouts.*   
  
*A tall figure emerged from the trees, his car parked over on the side of the road. When he finally came into view, something within me tensed. I knew this man all too well. Moonlight shrouded most of his features, but it was undeniable. He was the same one who had found Conrad - Dr. Finn Carlisle.*  
  
*With one last groan, Rai glanced up, his nose elongating into a snout as his body betrayed him, reminding him that he was a slave to the moon. And before too long, he wasn’t a boy at all. In fact, when Dr. Carlisle finally placed him in the back of his truck, I caught a glimpse of us in the reflection of his back window. Despite feeling like him and I were one and the same, I couldn’t be more wrong. This was something else entirely. A third presence. Something that could only be described as… Animalistic. Staring back at me weren’t his eyes at all, but those of a cold blooded predator. A wolf.*  
  
*“You’ll make a pretty addition,” Dr. Carlisle whispered as he stroked Rai’s raven colored fur. “I’ll just need to get you all-”*  
  
“Patched up!” Rai said, his large, calloused hand releasing my much smaller one.  
  
“Where am I?” Confusion bubbled within me as I felt the memory crumbling away. My entire body felt as if I’d been hit by a train.  
  
“What do you mean?” Rai questioned, his eyes meeting mine. “You’ve been with me the entire time. I just finished stitching your wound back up.” He paused for only a moment. “You pulled out quite a few stitches last night. That wreck shredded the flesh of your lower leg.”  
  
When I sat there staring at him, he cocked his head, the mannerism almost dog-like as he studied me. “Did I lose you there for a second? I could have sworn that you didn’t pass out during the stitching. You were gripping my other hand like your life depended on it.”  
  
My mind couldn’t help but wander back to the memory, though. A small grimace perched on my lips as I glanced back at his face, the ghost of his past making itself known in the jagged scars that cut through his brow, his top lip and his left cheek. And then I remembered something eerily strange. Those same exact wounds regenerated themselves all on their own accord as Dr. Carlisle’s truck barreled down the old highway. And that’s when I realized it…
