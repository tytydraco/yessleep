I should have known something was wrong when Ms. Grey's smile never reached her eyes.

The TempCorp Solutions office looked like any other corporate suite on the twenty-third floor of the Goldman Building - all glass, chrome, and that particular shade of gray that screams "we mean business." But the air felt different. Thicker somehow, like breathing through a wet wool blanket.

"Sarah Smith?" Ms. Grey's voice was honey-smooth, professional. Perfect. Too perfect. "Your paperwork is complete. We have your first assignment."

I nodded, trying not to show how desperate I was. Three months of unemployment had eaten through my savings like acid through paper. My landlord's patience was wearing thinner than the walls of my studio apartment.

"You'll be covering for Amanda Pierce at Meridian Analytics," Ms. Grey said, sliding a manila folder across her pristine desk. "Standard replacement contract. Four weeks, possibly extending to six."

The folder contained Amanda's ID badge, her parking pass, and a sheet of login credentials. Her face smiled up at me from the photo - round-cheeked, brown hair, unremarkable. The kind of face you'd forget as soon as you looked away.

"But this is..." I started.

"We provide seamless workplace transitions," Ms. Grey cut in, that perfect smile never wavering. "Our clients expect their temps to step into roles completely. You'll use Amanda's desk, her email, her extension. For all intents and purposes, you are Amanda Pierce until the assignment ends."

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, a sound that would become my constant companion. "Is that... legal?"

"Everything is perfectly in order." Ms. Grey's fingers tapped once on her desk. "Unless you'd prefer to decline?"

My rent was due in three days. "No, I'll take it."

The next morning, I stood in Meridian Analytics' lobby, wearing Amanda Pierce's name badge and clutching her security pass. The guard barely glanced at me before waving me through.

"Morning, Amanda," he said.

I opened my mouth to correct him, then remembered. "Good morning."

Amanda's desk was on the fourth floor, cubicle 4-15. Everything was exactly as she'd left it - family photos (husband, no kids), a half-empty bottle of hand sanitizer, a coffee mug with "World's Okayest Employee" printed on it. The keyboard was slightly sticky, like someone had spilled something sweet.

"Amanda!" A woman in a blazer stopped by my cubicle. "How was your mother's surgery?"

I froze. Ms. Grey hadn't mentioned anything about this. "It went... well?"

"Oh, thank God. We were all so worried when you had to leave suddenly." She squeezed my shoulder. "Glad to have you back."

Throughout the day, more colleagues stopped by. Each one called me Amanda without hesitation. Each one remembered things about Amanda's life that I shouldn't have known but somehow did. When Karen from Accounting mentioned Amanda's cat Mittens, I found myself automatically responding, "Yeah, she's still scratching up the new couch."

I hadn't meant to say it. I didn't know Amanda had a cat. But the words came out anyway, natural as breathing.

The worst part? The family photos on the desk had changed. The husband was different now - older, balder. And there were two kids I hadn't noticed before.

At 5:15 PM, an email from Ms. Grey appeared:

"First day performance review: Excellent integration. Remember, consistency is key to successful transitions. Maintain the role at all times, even off-hours. We'll be monitoring."

I opened my purse to check my phone. My hands were shaking. That's when I noticed my own driver's license in my wallet. The face was mine, but something was off. The edges looked softer somehow, rounder. Like Amanda's face was bleeding into mine.

In the bathroom mirror, my reflection looked normal. But when I blinked, just for a split second, I could have sworn I saw Amanda staring back.

The worst part? I couldn't remember what my own mother looked like anymore. But I could picture Amanda's mother perfectly, down to the scar on her right knee from a childhood bicycle accident.

As I packed up to leave, I found something carved into the bottom drawer of Amanda's desk. The letters were shaky, desperate:

"THEY MAKE YOU FORGET WHO YOU WERE"

Below that, in fresher cuts:

"I DON'T WANT TO BE JANET ANYMORE"

Who was Janet? And why did that name make my head hurt so much?

I pulled out my TempCorp badge to sign out. The photo was still mine, but the name had changed.

It now read: "Amanda Pierce (formerly Sarah Smith)."

The GPS led me to 1247 Maple Grove Drive without hesitation. My hands - Amanda's hands? - knew exactly how to grip the steering wheel, exactly where to turn. I hadn't needed directions. The muscle memory was already there, like a virus spreading through my nervous system.

The colonial-style house loomed before me, painted a soft blue that seemed wrong somehow. Hadn't it been yellow this morning? The garden gnome by the front steps winked at me with knowing ceramic eyes.

Greg's car was already in the driveway. Amanda's husband. My husband? The wedding ring on my finger felt simultaneously foreign and familiar, like a childhood scar you've forgotten about until someone points it out.

I sat in the car, watching the porch light flicker. The neighbor across the street was watching too, her face pressed against her window like a pale moon. When our eyes met, she quickly drew her curtains.

My phone buzzed. A text from Ms. Grey: "Remember, consistency is key. The role doesn't end at 5 PM."

The house key was on my ring, right where it had always been. No. Not always. Just since this morning. But my fingers found it without looking, like they'd done it thousands of times before.

The door opened before I could use it. Greg stood there, tall and balding, exactly like the photo on my desk. The photo that had changed.

"There you are, honey!" His smile was warm, genuine. "I was getting worried. You usually call when you're running late."

The words came automatically: "Sorry, traffic on Highland was terrible." I hadn't driven on Highland. Had I?

He pulled me into a hug, and my body responded instinctively, fitting against his like a puzzle piece. He smelled of aftershave and coffee - familiar scents that triggered memories I shouldn't have had. Our first date at Marino's. The way he proposed in the rain. The honeymoon in Cabo.

But those weren't my memories. Were they?

"How's your mother doing?" Greg asked as we moved into the kitchen. "Did the doctor say when she can come home?"

"She's..." I started, then stopped. Because I could see her, clear as day: Amanda's mother in the hospital bed, her right knee scarred from that childhood bicycle accident, smiling weakly as she held my - Amanda's - hand. "She's recovering well."

The kitchen was exactly as I remembered it, even though I'd never been there before. The magnetic letters on the fridge spelled out "WELCOME HOME AMANDA." Hadn't they said something else when I first walked in?

"You seem different," Greg said suddenly, studying my face. "Did you do something with your hair?"

"No, I..." I touched my hair self-consciously. In the reflection of the microwave door, my features seemed to shift and flow, like wax melting under heat. For a moment, I saw Amanda's round cheeks, her softer jaw. Then my own face again. Then something in between.

"Must be the light," Greg muttered, but his eyes held doubt. He opened the fridge, and I saw photos stuck to it with magnets. Photos of us - Greg and Amanda - at parties, on vacation, at their wedding. In each one, Amanda's face was slightly blurred, as if someone had smudged it with a thumb.

"Remember when we took that trip to Maine?" Greg asked, pointing to one photo. "You were so scared of the lobsters."

I did remember. The salty air, the way the rubber bands around the lobsters' claws looked like tiny handcuffs. The irrational fear that they'd somehow break free. But that couldn't be my memory. Could it?

"Greg," I said carefully, "what if I told you I'm not really Amanda?"

He laughed, but it sounded hollow. "Of course you're Amanda. Who else would you be?"

"Sarah," I whispered. 

Greg's face went blank for a moment, like a computer screen refreshing. Then he smiled again, but something was wrong with his eyes. They looked glazed, like a doll's. "Don't be silly, honey. You're my Amanda. You've always been Amanda."

I backed away from him, bumping into the fridge. The magnetic letters rearranged themselves: "AMANDA (FORMERLY SARAH) (FORMERLY JANET)."

"I need to use the bathroom," I stammered.

"Second door on the left," Greg said automatically. "Like it's always been."

I knew it was the second door on the left. I knew the third floorboard creaked. I knew the hot water took exactly twelve seconds to warm up. I knew these things like I knew my own name.

But what was my name?

In the bathroom, I found a box of hair dye hidden under the sink. The same shade as Amanda's hair. Next to it was a small notebook, its pages filled with cramped handwriting:

"Day 1: My name is Janet Miller.

Day 15: My name is Amanda Pierce (formerly Janet Miller).

Day 30: My name is Amanda Pierce. Who is Janet Miller?"

The last entry was in different handwriting - my handwriting:

"Day 1: My name is Sarah Smith.

Day 1: My name is Amanda Pierce (formerly Sarah Smith).

Day 1: My name is Amanda Pierce Amanda Pierce Amanda Pierce"

When I looked in the mirror, I couldn't tell whose face was staring back.

The phone in my pocket buzzed again. Ms. Grey: "Excellent progress on the transition. Phase 2 begins tomorrow. Remember to check your email for your next assignment. You'll be covering for Elizabeth Wong at Sterling Industries."

But I was Amanda Pierce. Wasn't I?

The magnetic letters on the fridge had changed again when I returned to the kitchen: "GOODBYE AMANDA. HELLO ELIZABETH."

"As Sarah/Amanda faces her next assignment, what terrifying truth will she uncover?"

Options:   
\[A: InvestigateÂ Elizabeth Wong's current whereabouts - is she really "on leave"?\]  
\[B: ConfrontÂ Ms. GreyÂ about the true nature of TempCorp's "transitions"\]  
\[C: Return to your own apartment, only to find someone else living your life\]
