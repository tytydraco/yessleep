A few years ago, my grandfather went missing. I moved into his house immediately, and, when he was declared legally dead after a while, I ended up inheriting it. It would lead to a terrible experience, one that I barely survived.

For months after his disappearance, I had the same recurring dream. My grandfather, Chester Middleton, would be standing in the corner of the fields behind his house, his back turned to me, the night sky a gray-black and covered in clouds that rushed by, as if they had been previously recorded and now the video was played on fast forward. He had gone missing a few months ago, and there had still been no sign of him or his body being found.

“Grandpa,” I said, walking up behind him, shivering and barefoot. “You’re back?”

“Not yet, Johnny,” he said in his usual slow way. It was strange to have a conversation with someone’s back, and I had to lean forward to hear his quiet words. “But soon, I will be. You will find me and bring me home.”

“But how could I find you? It’s so dark here,” I said, squinting just to make out his silhouette. I moved closer to him.

“You’d be surprised at what you can find if you go looking in dark places,” he said. “And some of those things will also find you.” He turned then, showing half of his face blown off, the teeth and bone below showing off his eternally grinning skull. “Look at how much they’ve changed me, Johnny. Look!” He rubbed both of his gnarled, callused fingers over his face, a gesture I had seen him do countless times. A waterfall of blood dripped down his body from his half-missing face, but the strange black soil where he stood drank up every drop instantly, leaving no trace at all.

I awoke, screaming, covered in sweat. I ripped the covers off and jumped out of bed, pacing, looking out the window into the fields behind the house. I expected to see his shadow there, just like in the dream. But it was just dark fields, extending for acres.

As time went on, this nightmare became a daily burden. I became afraid to go to sleep, and when I did fall into an exhausted slumber, I always woke up screaming. The dream became longer, and at the end, my grandfather would always point to a trail in the corner of the field- one that never existed as long as I had been living at that house. Sometimes it would start to rain fire, or the trees along the borders of the field would begin to drip red blood all over the ground. White, rotted hands often reached out of the trail, grasping at anything and everything yet finding no purchase.

I tried taking sleeping pills, opiates, cannabis, heavy doses of alcohol and whatever else people said would give me a dreamless, peaceful sleep. Nothing worked. I lost weight, dark circles beginning to appear underneath my eyes, my face becoming more and more gaunt with the passing of the weeks. Even in my waking hours, I still saw my grandfather’s face- destroyed, bloody, the skull underneath frozen in the endless smile of the dead.

It became so bad that I began to consider things I would never have thought of before. One of my friends from college had been heavily interested in the occult, eventually joining a secretive group known as the Golden Dawn who were supposed practitioners of black magic. I called him up one afternoon, nearly hallucinating from sleep deprivation. The lights seemed much brighter, and I became tired after doing nearly anything. I went to work in a fugue-like state, and the days all blended together into one never-ending hallucinatory delirium.

“Johnny, buddy, how you doing?” my friend Nathan said in a calm, detached demeanor he nearly always used. “You look a little rough around the edges.”

“Not good,” I said, explaining how my grandfather had gone missing, and how my recurring nightmare of the secret trail had plagued me for weeks straight. 

“Is this the house that your grandfather left you? The one where the small, private graveyard was built on the border of the property?” I paused, trying to remember if Nathan had ever been here to visit me. My mind moved sluggishly, and memories came slowly to me now. Then I remembered that he had visited me once here during our first year at college.

“How did you remember that?” I asked him, genuinely curious for the first time since beginning this conversation. He laughed.

“Don’t you know who is buried there? It is kind of famous or, more likely, infamous,” he said. I shook my head.

“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” I said.

“Well, it was long before either you or I were born. Back in the early 1900s, a farmer there killed his whole family one night. They were snowed in, and some people just think he got cabin fever. Maybe they’re right, I don’t know. His name was Harris McCuen, and he went through the house, slitting the throats of his two daughters before moving onto his wife. None of them ever woke up or tried to fight back, at least according to the police. It’s like they were all in a stupor or hypnotized, or maybe just drugged or something, I don’t know. 

“He ended his killing spree by writing a suicide note in his own blood. It was full of rambling and lunacy, talking about how he needed to protect his family from demons who lived in the fields. But he also said there was a secret trail back there that led… somewhere else. Some dark, horrifying place, where the dead don’t stay dead, and the dirt of the trail itself drinks blood, forever thirsty for more.” I paused, waiting for the punchline.

“Are you serious right now?” I asked. “How the fuck did no one ever tell me about the mass murder in my house? And how do you know so much about it?”

“I grew up in this town, too,” he said. “I listen and read. Clearly, you do not. The history teacher at the high school knew all about it, as well as the members of the historical society. I guess you just never asked the right questions- or, really, many questions at all.”

“Is there anything I can do about it?” I asked. There was a long pause.

“I’ll talk to a couple of others in the Golden Dawn,” Nathan said. “Maybe this weekend, I can stay over and we will figure out something.”

\*\*\*

The rest of the week passed by slowly, but at least I had hope. I would see Nathan on Friday, and maybe this would all be over. I could finally sleep again without waking up screaming every night. I could finally be at peace in my own house.

Things got worse Thursday night. I had the same recurring dream, my grandfather pointing at the mysterious, hidden trail and the trees all weeping blood in an eerily lit twilight world. I was standing in the field, when without warning, grasping hands latched onto my body, forcibly pulling my left arm while digging into my skin with fingers that felt as hard as iron. I shrieked in mortal terror, spinning around. There was a man in clothes that would have been in fashion around World War I, his teeth covered in blood, small trickles of it running down his chin. His eyes were burning in their intensity, his dilated pupils staring into my face with an insane sheen.

“How much more must I bleed them?” he asked, his voice sounding slurred and slowed. He kept having to stop and spit blood out. “They told me if I bled them, I’d find peace. How much more, man?! I can’t do this much longer! I cut their throats while they slept, I did *everything* they asked of me, so why… why… why…” 

Looking down at where he had grabbed my arm, I saw deep claw marks. I looked back up quickly at the man, stepping back. His fingers were, in reality, white bone, sharpened to dagger-like blades. Harris McCuen turned, the back of his head showing, and I saw right into his brains.

It looked as if he had put a shotgun or pistol directly in his mouth and blew the entire back of his skull off. There was an exit wound the size of an orange, giving me a perfect view of the gore that had once been his brain and skull. Behind him, I saw a middle-aged woman and two teenage girls. They all had their throats slashed open, gurgling and choking, their dilated pupils staring straight at me as waterfalls of blood ran down the front of their bodies.

“I bled them for the Blind God,” Harris McCuen said. “How much more blood does he need?” At that point, I woke up in my bed, covered in sweat. A stinging sensation in my arm caused me to look down, where I saw the slash marks from his razor-sharp bone claws on my left arm.

\*\*\*

Nathan ended up showing with another woman I had never met before. He said she was a Third Order Magus, and one of the leading practitioners of both black and white magic in the southeastern United States. None of that meant anything to me, but I was glad I was no longer alone dealing with this nightmare.

Nathan always reminded me of some German supersoldier, a topic I made jokes about with him. He stood over six feet tall with blonde hair and blue eyes. He was a clear gym rat at that, with huge arms and a thick chest. In contrast, the woman standing next to him was much shorter and older, though she didn’t appear to have a wrinkle on her middle-aged face. Her hair was pure black and her eyes were wide and blue.

“This is Nora,” Nathan said. I went to shake her hand, but she walked right past me, looking out into the corn fields.

“There is something different about this place,” she said in an airy voice. I felt the need to roll my eyes, but I remembered that they had volunteered to come out of their way and spend the night simply to help me. And, moreover, I remember what desperate straits I was in. These people may be my only hope. And then she did something that sent chills down my spine- she pointed at the same spot my grandfather always pointed to in my dreams. 

“The universe is thin there. It is a point where some may cross over, or those beings from the astral worlds may enter into ours. I’m not surprised this house has been the scene of so much trouble. The killing of an entire family may have not been the cause of the thinning, but an effect. The dark spirits from the higher dimensions can use the weak minds of those afflicted by insanity, grave physical illness or lifelong addiction to do their bidding.” She stopped, taking a deep breath and closing her eyes. I didn’t know if this was part of some act or not, but I just stood there, watching and waiting. After a few moments, she opened them again. “I believe your grandfather somehow ended up in that same place. He is calling out for you, asking for help. Or at least, his spirit is. I believe his body is dead.”

“So what can I do?” I asked. She looked at me, her large blue eyes as cold as ice. A shiver ran down my back, and I turned away from her intense gaze.

“You can go and help him, young man. What else are you going to do, leave him there for all eternity?” With that, she turned her back to me, pulling her purple shawl closer around her neck. I saw a quick glimpse of a tattoo with a white eye built into the center of a pyramid on her wrist. 

Nathan and Nora went to his car, pulling out various ingredients to begin the ritual that they assured me would open up the trail to us. I saw Nora with an ancient-looking leather-bound tome whose title read, “The Book of Gates”. 

An hour later, we were assembled at the spot where the field met the forest. A couple hundred feet to the left, the old cemetery lay in a clearing in the woods. But where we all looked now was just a cluster of pricker bushes and trees. It looked impenetrable and swampy.

Nathan began taking the necessary objects out of a box while Nora still held her spellbook.

“Thirteen black candles with human remains mixed into the wax,” he said to me, smiling as he spread them out in a circle. He reached back into the box and pulled out a glass vial. “Some dirt from the grave of a murderer.” Next, he pulled out a branch. “The flowering branch of datura.” And last of all, he pulled out another glass vial, but this one was red. “The blood of a murdered virgin.”

“How did you *get* this stuff?” I asked him. He looked at me with a half-smile.

“Datura grows wild around here. As for the rest… Ask me no questions, brother, and I will tell you no lies.” Nora finally spoke, looking up from her spellbook at the moon-lit sky.

“The time to perform the ritual is running out,” she said. “We must begin immediately.” I will not recount here how the ingredients were used, as I do not wish to be responsible for anyone else trying to repeat the ritual. The horrors that ritual unleashed cannot be easily comprehended.

As Nora finished speaking the last Latin incantation necessary to open the hidden trail, a feeling of anxiety and terror took over my heart. I wished I could just run away at that moment and never come back to this cursed house. But it wasn’t just the house, I knew. My grandfather might be out there, and if so, I needed to help him.

One moment, I was looking at the thick wall of bushes, ferns and swampland. As soon as I blinked my eyes, a trail was there with soil as black as obsidian. I took a step back, falling on my back as I tripped over a candle.

“It’s OK, it’s OK,” Nathan said, bending down to give me a hand. “The ritual worked perfectly. We have opened the pathway.” I looked up, squinting and peering down the black trail. Everything looked… strange. The trees were not native to this region. They had dark red bark, and thorns ran all up and down their exterior. Their leaves were curved into the shape of a scythe. And, strangest of all, they exuded a resinous sap that trickled down their bark- a sap that looked like thick, dark blood.

Nathan reached into his pack, pulling out two pistols. He handed one to me, giving me his crooked half-smile.

“Just in case,” he said simply. I took it, making sure the safety was on. He handed me a simple chest holster as well, which I put on over my shirt. Nathan had an identical one under his jacket already, which he used to holster his pistol. Picking up his bag, he nodded at Nora and me.

“Alright, let’s do this,” he said excitedly. Nora shook her head.

“You better tamp down your glee, young man,” she said. “There are things along that trail that would drive you insane simply by looking at them. There are things that would suck your blood out or dismember you while you’re still alive. Remember, we are only going to get his grandfather out of there, then we leave immediately. If he is dead, we will free his spirit. If he is alive, then we will grab him and guide him out. Understood?” Nathan nodded, apologizing sheepishly. “Keep an eye out, also, for what we seek. The bark of Zaqqum, the blood of an ancient one, and the soil from the endless stairs.” I found this curious, but I didn’t ask about it at the time.

We started walking. The moment we passed through the threshold of the trail, I could feel it. There was a buzzing noise, like being directly underneath high-voltage power lines, and a smell like ozone filled the air. It wasn’t unpleasant, but it seemed to indicate that whatever this place was, it was full of energy.

As we walked further away from the threshold, I looked back, expecting to see the field and house in the distance. But to my surprise, there was only an endless, winding black trail behind me, leading into a group of desolate, rocky canyons that I had never seen before. Apparently, we were stuck here.

Up ahead, I heard a chattering of teeth and a low, moaning noise. We came across a sharp turn to the right, and a massive tree stood there, hundreds of feet tall. It had no leaves or fruits. Instead, demonic heads hung from the branches, swaying softly in the wind. Their faces were flat and deflated-looking, their eyes pure black or glowing red. They opened and closed their mouths slowly in time with the breeze, creating the constant chittering noise. It was as if they were freezing to death, even though the air was warm and humid. Nora put out a hand, stopping us abruptly in front of the tree. Beyond, I saw the black trail split into seven, some ascending and others descending. There were no signs or indications of which trail was the right one.

“The Tree of Zaqqum,” Nora said softly, looking at the strange fruit the tree produced. As she said its name, the eyes of the demon heads all turned to look at her. Their expressions ranged from fury to disinterest to obvious pain. Their sunken, emaciated faces then examined me and Nathan.

“Do you know the way?” Nathan asked her. She shrugged, apparently unafraid of the horrific site in front of us.

“They know the way,” she said, pointing to the heads. “We only need ask them.” I had my doubts about this, but said nothing. She stepped forward.

“Those who are one with the holy Tree of Zaqqum,” she said, “we ask for your help. We are travelers, lost on the trail. We look for one who has come here before us- an old man who came from the fields nearly four months ago. His name…” She turned to me.

“His name is Chester Middleton,” I said loudly and confidently, stepping forward. “He is my grandfather. He has gone missing from my world. Have you seen him?” At first, nothing happened, though the chattering of teeth stopped. Hundreds of pairs of eyes focused on me in the utter silence. Not a bird sang or an insect hummed in the stillness.

All at once, the mouths of every decapitated head opened, and a voice emerged from all of them simultaneously. It was deep and gurgling.

“We have seen the one you seek,” they said in unison. “Give us a sacrifice of blood and we will tell you the way.” I looked at Nora, one eyebrow raised. She nodded at me, holding out a dagger.

“They want some of your blood to feed the tree,” she said. I gaped at her. “Just a little. Just cut your arm or hand or whatever you feel like and leave a few drops of blood on the roots of the tree. They won’t help us without a sacrifice from you, no matter how small it may seem. After all, you are the reason we’re here.” I took her ceremonial dagger, gazing down at the rubies and opals that adorned the handle, the curved blade with strange hieroglyphs marking its steel surface.

I did as she said. Walking up to the tree, standing directly next to it, I realized just how huge it really was. I had seen the redwoods in California, and this was taller than any of those. Its black bark looked ancient, with deep gouges and cracks running up and down it as far as the eye could see.

I put my left arm out where the trunk disappeared into the soil, putting a small slash into the top of my skin. A small trickle of blood ran down my skin, dropping into the soil below. As soon as it touched the dark ground, the earth sucked it in. The tree seemed to sigh with pleasure, the heads all smiling at once in unison, their eyes all looking down at me.

“Your grandfather is on the seventh path,” they said. “Seven, the holy number, the number of strength and mysticism. Take no other path, unless it is death you seek. And you may find it regardless.” Then they went silent, closing their mouths. A strong breeze blew down the path, and they began to chatter again, returning to their previous expressions of mixed pleasure, pain, fury and sadness.

Nora stepped forward, taking the dagger back. She peeled a small piece of the black bark off of the tree, wrapping it in a silken cloth and placing it in her bag.

I wiped the blood away on my shirt, returning to my group. We looked at the seven trails. I wondered what the first six held.

Without hesitation, though, we took the last one, walking forward to find my grandfather- or whatever was left of him in this cursed place.
