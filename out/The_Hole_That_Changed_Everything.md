I was around 13 years old when this happened. Now I am 25, and an ant on a wall made me decide to tell this story.

 The fear of holes may seem irrational at first, but upon closer examination it reveals a deeper, more primal discomfort. Holes symbolize the unknown, the unforgiving, and the unsettling. They are voids of empty spaces that beg the question: What lies beyond?

Take, for instance, a cave. A natural hole carved into the earth, surrounded by the beauty of nature, yet it is a place of both wonder and danger. The darkness within lures explorers in, promising adventure, but also harboring the risk of entrapment, isolation, or even death. The Nutty Putty Cave serves as a tragic example. What seemed like an exciting challenge became a fatal trap, reinforcing the idea that holes conceal not just space, but peril.

On a more everyday level, the mere sight of clustered holes, whether on human skin, porous materials, or organic textures, can evoke a sense of discomfort. The way pores open on the skin, the irregular patterns on a sponge, or the worn fabric of a couch all serve as reminders that holes are everywhere. Their presence disrupts uniformity, hinting at decay, imperfection, or even something lurking just beneath the surface.

The fear of holes is not just about aesthetics; it is about what they represent: the abyss of uncertainty, the lurking unknown, and the unsettling realization that some voids, once entered, may never let us return.

 These thoughts raced through my mind as I lay on the bottom bunk, staring up at the plywood support above me. The wood grain was straight and uniform like a bustling highway, etched with messages written by past Whispering Pines Campers filled with just as much or even more hormones than me. From pictures of genitals to random explicit words and most importantly the names of the forgotten campers before me. Strangely, there was a comfort in it, a connection to the unknown kids who had lain here before me, 10, 20, even 30 years earlier. I imagined them now, out in the world, maybe married with kids, fulfilling their dreams. Maybe they, too, had once stared at this very grain of wood, feeling the weight of time pressing down on them.

I do not know what led me down this train of thought. Maybe it was that video I watched about Nutty Putty Cave, or the way the seams in the mattress stared back at me like a beehive filled with thousands of Africanized honey bees. But most likely, it was the assignment I had to finish by tomorrow morning, exactly the day we were supposed to leave Whispering Pines Camp and return to the lovely city of Thunder Bay, ON.

As I was lost in my thoughts, staring blankly into the dark, cabin-filled room, I heard the door creak open, followed by soft tiptoeing toward the bunk bed across from mine. I could not see anything. It was the middle of the night in a borderline rundown cabin, but I figured it was just one of my roommates.

There was Michael, Jacob, and Spencer, the three guys who mostly kept to themselves. To this day, I have no idea why Ms Fisher thought it was a good idea to stick the quiet kid in school with a trio that operated like some kind of hive mind, but she did. God bless her soul.

I was not sure where they had wandered off to after the howling surveys at Camp Whispering Pines, but I vaguely remembered them whispering about a movie they had watched on the bus, Full Metal Jacket. I can only assume what happened next had something to do with that because just as I closed my eyes, I was suddenly held down and ambushed by a barrage of pillows.

All I could hear were squeaky voices trying to sound deep.

"You should not have told on us, Emmanuel," one whispered.

"Well, we knew you were a snitch," another chimed in.

They kept holding me down, beating me with pillows like they were trying to exorcise a demon out of me.

I thrashed and yelled, "Stop it, you dipshits! I did not tell anyone anything, idiot!"

They finally let me go. Another voice said, "Well then how did Ms Fisher know we ditched the survey, huh?"

I groaned and sat up from my bed. "Each teacher does a head count after every activity, idiot. If you were not so busy talking all the time, you might have figured that out."

I could feel the blank, dumb looks in their eyes as they stared in each other's approximate directions.

They all laughed, not menacingly, but like a bunch of kids who thought they were pulling off the perfect prank. One of them said, "Well obviously we knew that, right Jacob?"

Another added, "Yeah man, you are so quiet we just wanted to break the ice in the best way possible."

Suddenly the cabin light flicked on, burning through the darkness and stabbing my eyes. I squinted and saw them clearly now, my so-called attackers.

Michael stood by the light switch, grinning. He was stocky, with a round frame that made his windbreaker look even puffier. His eyes were narrow and stretched a little too far apart, giving him a constant look of half bored suspicion. His nose was short, flat, and wide like it had been squashed into place, and his unkempt hair stuck out like a birds nest that lost a fight with the wind. Dirt smeared the bottom of his jacket, and the sleeves were laced with thick white snot, probably something he thought added to its vintage appearance.

Then there was Spencer, standing at the foot of my bed with a smug look on his face and a cervical pillow clutched tightly to his chest. Probably for that long, skinny neck of his. His hair was surprisingly well kept, a crisp shade of auburn that reminded me of fallen leaves in early October. His skin was so pale it looked almost translucent under the cabin’s flickering ceiling light. He grinned at me with a strange intensity, the kind of expression you might expect from someone who had spent a little too much time studying battle maps from the world wars. There was something off about it, like he was not just amused, he was fascinated.

Then, finally, there was Jacob. He did not say anything, just leaned into the opening at the end of the bunk bed, his head slowly tilting into view like he was trying to appear in a horror movie jump scare. All I could see at first was the sharp tip of his nose, absurdly long and pointed, like it was trying to lead the rest of his body into the room. His long blonde hair fell over his face in uneven curtains, but his mouth was visibly curved into an awkward, almost apologetic smile. It was not comforting. If anything, it made me more uneasy. He looked like a mannequin that someone had tried to teach how to express emotion.

The three of them just stood there, motionless for a second, basking in the afterglow of their late night pillow raid. The room was still quiet except for my breathing and the creak of one of the bunk beds settling under weight. I could not tell if they were trying to be funny, creepy, or both.

Maybe that was the point.

Michael broke the silence, his voice casual like we had not just been through a surprise midnight ambush.

"So what is up, dude? You have barely said a word to us and we are your roommates. That is like a cardinal sin."

He was not wrong. I try my best to keep to myself, especially on this trip. It was designed for the boys club. The kind of group made up of less desirable students, the troublemakers, the pranksters, the fatherless kids, and the ones from picture perfect families who feel the need to prove something even more. Then there is me.

I do not know if I fit into any of those categories. Or maybe I fit into all of them in just the right amount to make me invisible. I do not participate in class, which usually leads to teachers skipping over me entirely. The ones who try to force it out of me get a strained, uncomfortable smile. As you can probably guess, that leads to whispered laughs and the usual remarks like "slowpoke" or "idiot."

I would not say I lack love at home, but I would definitely say I am a disappointment. I am not good at sports. I do not get good grades. And once I get home, I turn on my dusty old Acer laptop and waste time doing absolutely nothing meaningful. No hobbies. No talents. Just an endless stream of distraction and silence.

So I guess that is why, when my mom got the email about a potential after school opportunity that promised leadership skills and a bunch of other bologna, she signed me up without a second thought. No warning. No conversation. Just an optimistic "I think this will be good for you," followed by a forced smile I have seen too many times.

Now here I am. Whispering Pines Camp. Rooming with three strangers who act like they have been best friends since birth, trying to navigate a place built for kids who were either too loud to ignore or too angry to sit still.

And I am somewhere in between. Always in between.

I looked past Jacob and Spencer and met Michael's narrow, dark eyes. My mind raced with thoughts, replies, comebacks, anything at all. But in the end, I chose the best thing I could say.

Nothing.

I turned over and faced the wall. Silence felt safer than whatever game they were playing.

Suddenly, Spencer smacked me in the ribs with his pillow and Jacob slapped the soles of my feet. The mattress creaked under the force.

"Come on, man," Spencer said. "We are talking to you."

"Where is all that energy you had when you were scared for your life?" Jacob added with a wide grin.

Michael stepped forward and said, "How about we play hide and seek? We are all bored, and when we leave camp tomorrow, our parents are going to kill us anyway."

I did not even look at them when I replied. "They are going to kill you guys, not me."

They all smiled like I had just told the funniest joke they had ever heard.

"Well, about that," Michael said. "I do not know what happened, but when Miss Fisher was doing the count, she said you were not there. And, well... we might have lied and said you were with us. And umm... that it was your idea you ditch the survey. And you kind of snuck into the cabin without her knowing."

I sat up and stared at them, completely dumbfounded. "I told Ms Fisher I was not feeling well. I said I wanted to come back and sleep it off..."

Jacob shook his head. "Dude, you told a seventy year old woman who is like two bad days from retirement. She probably did not even hear you."

Spencer chimed in, chuckling, "You should have told Ms A, buddy. Oh my god, I would have told her I had a boo boo that needed kissing or something, dude."

They all laughed, loud and careless, then started riffing about Ms A's pants — how even the biggest ones could not hide her curves. The room filled with their voices and jokes, their laughter echoing against the wooden walls.

But eventually, they noticed the silence coming from my side of the room again. Like sharks smelling blood, they turned to me in unison.

"What are you, gay or something?" one of them asked. "Why are you so sad?"

"Hey, man, if it is about getting beat, at least you know your parents care about you. Why else would they be doing it?" Michael added, half smiling.

Jacob scoffed. "That is bullshit, dude. Your dad hits you because he is a drunk piece of shit with anger issues."

Michael sat down on his bed across from mine and rubbed his hands together like he was trying to keep them busy. "I was just trying to cheer him up, bro. I do not know. And anyway, my parents are not going to find out I ditched. I gave the school a fake number."

Spencer and Jacob both said, "We all did."

I finally spoke. "My parents do not beat me. I doubt they would even care. That is the whole reason I am here in the first place."

The room quieted. Just for a moment.

"Do not be such a downer," Spencer said, rolling his eyes. "Boo hoo, Mommy and Daddy do not beat you."

Jacob leaned against the bedframe and shrugged. "At least you can do whatever you want. I would be happy to do anything with no consequences."

I mumbled back, "It is not like that... it is just, I do not know."

Michael clapped his hands together like he was shaking off the mood. "Alright, alright. So are we playing hide and seek or what?"

I frowned. "How are we going to play hide and seek in this room? There is one closet, two bunk beds, and a dresser. Where could we even hide?"

Without missing a beat, Jacob, Spencer, and Michael all said in unison, "Hide and seek in the dark."

Jacob added a dramatic "Boom," tossing his hands in the air like he was summoning thunder.

I could not help but let out a small laugh and muttered, "That is stupid."

Michael grinned wide, his crooked teeth catching the dim light like chipped porcelain. "Do not knock it till you try it. Come on, let us play."

Without another word, the three of them dropped into a loose circle in the middle of the cabin floor. Each of them kicked one leg out, the tips of their shoes forming a tight triangle that pointed inward.

Michael looked up at me. "Come on."

I stayed sitting on the edge of my bunk. "This is for kids."

All three of them frowned at the same time, like puppets sharing the same string.

Spencer scoffed. "Oh, so now you are too old for black shoe, black shoe? Fine then," he said, dragging out the words like a dare. "You be it."

Jacob smiled, "Yeah. You are it."

I said, "Fair enough" and walked to the light switch at the far end of the room and flicked it off. Darkness swallowed everything in an instant. I pressed my back against the wall and started counting aloud.

"One... two... three..."

Laughter exploded from all sides. The creak of beds, the shuffle of sneakers across wood, hushed whispers. I kept counting, the numbers keeping me grounded.

"...twenty nine... thirty. Ready or not, here I come."

With my arms stretched out in front of me, I moved carefully through the dark, fingertips brushing along the grain of the log walls. The room felt tighter somehow. My heart beat harder with every step, not from fear of the game, but something else, something just under my skin.

I reached the first bunk bed and crouched down to feel the bottom mattress. Nothing. Just a forgotten sock and a damp patch on the corner.

I stood up and felt along the top bunk. My fingers grazed the wooden railing, tracing over dozens of tiny pits and carvings. They were not just shallow scratches from bored campers. These were deep, hollowed out spots, rough around the edges like something had burrowed into the wood. Tiny, clustered holes. Too many. My stomach turned.

They ran across the rail in strange, meandering patterns, like a maze or tunnels made by something small with purpose.

My breath hitched. I pulled my hand back instinctively, wiping it on my shirt. My skin crawled with invisible itches.

Then, without warning, a clammy hand shot out from the shadows beneath the bed and clamped around my ankle. I jumped, letting out a choked yelp, and staggered back as laughter erupted around me.

"I am coming for you!" I shouted, I could not help laughing at myself, as the tension broke for just a moment.

I dropped to my knees and reached under the bed. My hand grabbed something soft and thick.

"Aaahhh!" Michael screamed, "He grabbed my cock!"

The whole room lost it. Pillows hit walls. Feet kicked in the dark. We were all laughing now, breathless and blind, just a bunch of kids hiding in the night.

This went on for what must have been thirty more minutes. Someone was always "it," stumbling around in the dark, reaching blindly for the nearest shape or sound. Every now and then you would hear a hissed "psst, come here, dickhead," or feel a breath way too close to your neck. You would flinch, jump, yell, laugh. Honestly, it was the most fun I had in a long time.

All of it came crashing down the moment Spencer froze mid step and whispered, "Someone is coming."

Instant silence.

We scattered like roaches at the sound of footsteps down the hallway, slow, deliberate, dragging footsteps. The kind that gave you just enough time to imagine everything that might be making them.

We dove back into our beds like it was a drill. Jacob climbed up top above me, his skinny limbs creaking the metal frame. I slid under the covers of the bottom bunk. Michael did the same across from me, while Spencer practically dove onto the top bed above him.

The door creaked open.

Her shadow hit the floor first, long and stretched, and then her shape filled the doorway. A wrinkled face shimmering under the flickering hallway light, grey hair standing out in tufts and snarls like she had just come out of a wind tunnel. The scent of cheap dollar store perfume wafted in before her.

Ms Fisher.

She stood there for a moment, letting the weight of her presence do most of the work. Then she flipped the light on. It stabbed into our eyes, and we all flinched in our beds.

"I know you are awake," she snapped. Her voice cracked like an old tree branch. "I can hear you causing a ruckus."

Her shoes clicked once on the floor. We did not dare move.

"I do not want to hear a zip," she said. "No movement. No talking. No whispering. No nothing."

She leaned just a bit into the room, her face a scowl frozen in time.

"Go. To. Bed. Or I will have a little chat with the principal about suspension."

She stared at each bed for a beat too long, like she was trying to memorize who would break first. Then she turned the light back off, slammed the door with just enough force to shake the walls, and walked away one dragging footstep at a time.

We stayed frozen.

No one said a word. Not until we heard the slow, shuffling footsteps echoing down the hallway, retreating to whatever room Ms Fisher crawled out of.

Only then did we start to move, quiet and careful, like prisoners in a bad dream. One by one, we slipped from our bunks and crept over to Michael’s bed. The mattress sagged under our weight as we huddled together, the air between us still holding traces of tension and leftover laughter.

Michael leaned in close and whispered, "Hey, Emmanuel, you want to know where we went earlier?"

Jacob immediately cut in, whisper yelling, "It was insane, dude. Like, next level stuff."

Spencer nodded so hard his floppy auburn hair bounced like a metronome. "We found something. Like, a place. Kinda."

"It was not really a place place," Jacob said, wiggling his fingers like he was telling a ghost story. "More like a hole. But not just any hole, a weird hole."

Spencer's eyes lit up. "Yeah! It is in the woods behind the dining hall. We were just messing around, throwing rocks and pretending we were being chased by that squirrel with no tail—"

"The demon squirrel," Jacob said, dead serious.

"And then Jacob tripped over this root or something and landed right next to it," Spencer continued. "It is like this hole in the ground, but it is super round and perfect. Too perfect."

Jacob added, "I threw a stick into it, and it made this crazy echo sound, like, booooooop," waving his hands around like a wizard.

"It did not sound like a stick hitting dirt," Michael said, serious again. "It sounded like it fell forever. And there was something, I do not know, humming?"

Spencer leaned in even closer and whispered, "We think it is the entrance to the underground city of the Ant People."

I blinked. "The what?"

Jacob grinned. "The Ant People, man. You do not know about the Ant People?"

"No one knows about the Ant People," Spencer said. "That is why we have to find them."

"They have been living under the camp for years," Jacob added, nodding like it was common knowledge. "They are tiny. Super smart. And probably have glow in the dark eyeballs."

Spencer whispered, "And they probably eat campers who snitch."

Michael rolled his eyes. "Okay, they are not real, real. Probably. But the hole was real. We are going back."

"Tonight," Spencer said, dramatically raising his finger like he was announcing the beginning of a heroic quest.

Then all three of them turned to look at me at the same time.

"You in?" Michael asked.

"Come on, do not be lame," Spencer said. "You have already been attacked by pillows. This is the next logical step."

Jacob leaned in with his best serious face, which still somehow looked like a confused llama. "You ever seen something so weird you just have to know what is down there?"

They stared at me, wide eyed and wiggly with anticipation.

I looked at them. I looked at the dark window. I looked at my bed.

Then I looked back at the three goofballs sitting on the mattress like the fate of the world depended on my answer.

I took a breath and said yes.

We slipped through the window one at a time, the cool night air biting at our skin. Michael went first, hauling his bulk out onto the grass, then Spencer, then Jacob, each of them landing with a soft thud and a muffled curse. I hesitated, my heart pounding, then swung my legs over the sill and dropped down. The world felt impossibly vast out here, the cabin's warm light receding behind us.

"Dude, watch the roots," Jacob whispered, hopping over a twisted knot in the ground.

"Yeah, you do not want to face plant before the big discovery," Spencer added with a grin.

I trailed behind, listening to the crunch of pine needles underfoot and the distant hoot of an owl. Every rustle in the underbrush made my skin prickle. I kept my eyes on the ground, tracing patterns in the dirt with my phone flashlight, small stones, broken twigs, the odd hole made by a burrowing critter. My fingers twitched at the sight of them, but I kept moving.

Michael led us down the narrow path behind the dining hall, cracking jokes. "I am telling you, man, if we find glow in the dark eyeballs, I am keeping one as a keychain."

Spencer rolled his eyes. "Gross, bro. That is illegal and creepy."

Jacob laughed. "Come on, imagine the flex: 'Yeah, I got my buddy's eyeball on my backpack.'"

I stayed silent, following their light beams through the trees. Their chatter felt distant, like echoes in a canyon. I kept expecting to see that perfect circle in the earth, the hole they described, but all I saw were roots and leaf litter.

"Should have been right here," Michael said, stopping. His beam swept a small clearing. "Where is it?"

Spencer crouched, shining his light in every direction. "Maybe we took a wrong turn?"

Jacob stomped at the ground. "Nah, this is it. I remember that weird root sticking up like a fang."

I stepped forward, kneeling beside the root. The earth here was smooth, no indentation, no circle, just flat dirt. I ran my hand across it. It felt oddly, blank. My skin itched at the emptiness, as if my mind expected holes and found none.

Michael shone his light around. "It is gone."

Spencer frowned. "You sure? Maybe someone filled it in."

Jacob kicked at the dirt. "Who would fill in a perfect, creepy hole in the middle of the woods?"

I stayed on my knees, staring at the unbroken earth. My chest tightened. The ground's uniform surface felt too, uniform, like a promise broken. I wiped my hand on my jeans, trying to shake the uneasy feeling.

"Guys," I said quietly, "I think we are lost."

They looked at me, then at each other. The beams of their flashlights crisscrossed in the darkness, illuminating trees that looked the same in every direction.

Michael's voice wavered. "Lost? No way. We came straight from the cabin."

Spencer stood, shining his light back down the path. "It should lead right back."

Jacob turned in a slow circle, beam swinging over mossy trunks and shadowy undergrowth. "Uh... this does not look familiar."

Silence settled. The forest felt alive, breathing, waiting. My flashlight's beam trembled in my hand. The jokes died on their lips.

"Okay," Michael said, trying to steady himself. "Let us just... follow the path."

We moved forward, but the trail forked into two nearly identical tracks. I glanced at the split, then at my friends, their faces pale in the flashlight glow.

Spencer gulped. "Which way?"

I swallowed. My mind felt hollow, as if the missing hole had sucked away all certainty. I pointed to the left. "That one."

They nodded, and we walked. Branches scraped our arms. Every step echoed in the stillness. I kept my gaze low, tracing every leaf and pebble, as if mapping the forest floor might guide us home.

Behind us, the path twisted away, swallowing our footprints. Ahead, the trees closed in like a wall. We were deep in the woods now, the cabin's safety a distant memory, and the hole we had come to find was nowhere to be seen, just the vast, unknowable darkness of the forest.

We pressed on, branches clawing at our clothes, the forest's hush pressing in around us. Michael's earlier bravado had faded into tense silence. Spencer and Jacob led the way, their flashlights bobbing ahead like twin fireflies.

"Can you guys feel that?" Jacob murmured, voice low. "Like... the air is different."

I nodded, heart hammering. Every breath felt shallow, as if the darkness itself was pressing down on my chest. I forced my gaze onto the path, but my eyes kept drifting to the ground's tiny depressions, little animal burrows, knots in the wood, the occasional cluster of insect holes. My fingers itched to run across them, but I recoiled each time, a cold knot of dread twisting in my gut.

"Guys, wait," I said, voice tight. My flashlight caught on a series of symbols carved into a tree: circles and triangles in neat rows. I swallowed hard. "What are these?"

Spencer crouched, brushing away moss. "Some kind of... marking? Like the Ant People left a trail."

Michael scoffed, but his grin trembled. "Yeah, if ants carried chisels."

We followed the markings downhill, the forest thinning until we stumbled into a vast clearing. Moonlight revealed the rim of a gigantic hole at least 30 feet across. Its edges were carved stone, rimmed with clusters of small cavities that gleamed wetly in the beam.

I froze. The circle was perfect, an open maw in the earth so immense it swallowed our lights. My legs shook, and I stepped back, the clustered pits around the rim making my skin crawl as though they were hundreds of tiny mouths breathing.

Spencer edged forward. "This is it, dudes. The motherlode."

Michael shone his light into the abyss. The beam vanished into blackness. "Holy shit."

Jacob knelt at the edge, leaning over. "Imagine what is down there." He peered into the void, then looked at me. "Come on, man. You want to see?"

"Guys," I whispered, voice cracking, "we should go back."

Spencer shook his head, excitement shining in his eyes. "No way. We came all this way."

Michael stepped closer to the hole's edge. "Think of the story we will have."

I backed away, my flashlight beam jittering over the stone clusters. "I am serious. I do not—" My voice caught. The rim's hollows felt alive, like they would swallow me whole if I stayed. "I am going back."

Jacob scoffed. "Afraid of a little darkness?"

I swallowed. "Not the darkness." My gaze flicked to the stone pits. "That." I took a trembling step back.

Spencer exchanged a look with Michael. "Dude, do not chicken out now."

Michael frowned. "We should at least—"

"No," I said, voice firmer. "I am done. Let us go." My heart pounded as I turned toward the trees, every clustered hole I had passed searing into my skin.

Spencer stomped his foot. "Fine. But we are coming back."

Heading back, we stumbled through the trees, branches slapping our arms, voices echoing off trunks.

"Man, you really chicken out fast," Michael teased, elbowing Spencer. "One minute you are all brave, next you are sprinting like a rabbit."

Spencer laughed. "Yeah, Emmanuel has got more quits than a video game."

I ignored them, focusing on finding the cabin's warm glow. But the forest had other plans. The ground beneath Jacob gave way with a sickening crack.

"Ah—!" he shrieked as we all pitched forward. I tried to grab anything—roots, air, someone's hand—but it was no use. We plummeted into darkness.

We landed hard, a collective thud against damp earth. My phone's flashlight flickered to life, casting pale light across the cavernous space. The walls were packed soil, riddled with tiny tunnels and hollow chambers like the inside of some monstrous ant farm. Tangled roots hung from above like skeletal fingers, and every surface crawled with motion. Thousands of pale insects skittered through their earthen corridors, the sound like dry leaves twisting in the wind.

Michael scrambled to his feet, waving his phone around wildly. "What the hell is this place?"

Spencer coughed, spitting dirt. "I do not know."

Jacob backed into the wall, his face twisted in panic. "I can not... I can not look at all those holes."

My chest constricted. The pulse of the tunnels in the flashlight beam made my skin crawl. My hands shook. I pressed my palms to my temples, willing the nausea down.

Michael looked at me, trying to stay calm. "It is okay. We just need to find an exit."

I nodded, swallowing the grit stuck in my throat. Mud and dirt still clung to my tongue, burning as I coughed up clumps of it.

Spencer jabbed a finger upward at the shaft above us. "That, that might be our way out," he said, voice shaky, chest rising and falling fast.

Michael's voice was tight and panicked: "I... I can not fit in there. It is way too tight. I can not do it."

Jacob stepped back, eyes wide. "It is the size of a damn pipe! What are we even doing?! We are trapped! We are going to die down here!"

His voice cracked, and I saw his hands trembling, tears threatening to spill.

Spencer shook his head violently. "No... no, we can get out! If we fell in, then the ground's weak. It is hollow. We can break through. We just need to dig or something or just push it open!"

"I... I think he is right," I said, struggling to breathe, every word tumbling out faster. "Look! Look there is moonlight. It is real. It is right there. If we do not do something now, we are not making it out."

We broke into a run, hoping to catch our throats, then it happened.

The tunnels came alive.

Thousands of ants burst from the walls, but these were not the pale, mindless workers from before. These were different. Larger. Sleeker. Their black exoskeletons glistened like oil. Jagged mandibles clicked and snapped, tearing the pale insects apart in flashes of white and red. Their eyes shimmered with unnatural intelligence.

They poured across the floor like liquid, a tidal wave of chitin and fury. They swarmed our legs in seconds, their clawed limbs digging into flesh, writhing and twitching as if they were trying to crawl inside us, into our skin, into our pores.

We screamed. We flailed. We ran. But they were everywhere.

We screamed, stumbling and swatting at them, trying to tear the ants off as they clawed higher, clinging to our clothes, hair, skin. Their bodies scratched and wriggled with a frantic purpose, as if they knew time was running out.

We bolted toward the narrow shaft, hope burning bright and thin until it was snuffed out by a sound behind us.

A wet clicking echoed through the tunnel, deep and deliberate. We did not dare look back. We did not have to.

Something massive had entered the chamber.

Its footsteps did not stomp; they glided. Smooth, rhythmic, elegant in a way that did not belong in something so huge. But they were fast. Too fast. Each step seemed to cover an impossible distance, dragging dread closer with it.

Michael's ragged breaths were getting louder behind me. I could hear the air rasping in and out of his lungs as if he were choking on the panic.

Then Jacob screamed, voice cracking: "We are not going to make it!"

"There's a turn there!" Spencer shouted, pointing into a break in the wall.

He dove in first. It was a narrow crevice tight enough that both walls scraped our arms as we shoved through. One at a time, we squeezed in. Jacob vanished ahead. I turned sideways and pushed in behind him.

Michael's voice was close behind me, desperate, ragged. "I can not... I can not fit!"

Spencer's scream echoed right behind me, "Wait... Michael can not fit!"

I twisted, but the space was too tight. I could not turn around. All I could hear was the scraping of bodies, the clatter of mandibles, and Michael's cries growing sharper, closer, more pained.

"The space," he gasped, voice breaking, "the space is too tight! I can not! I can not!"

Then something let out a low, wet chitter behind him, and all the air in the tunnel went still.

We froze.

Michael's screams cut through the dark, raw, desperate, and then came the sickening chorus of wet tearing, the slurping hiss of mandibles at work. The creature's noises faded, swallowed by the tunnels, dragging Michael's voice with them into silence.

None of us said a word.

Not Jacob. Not Spencer. Not me.

We just stood there, pressed against the cold earth walls, too afraid to breathe, too shattered to speak.

We kept crawling, deeper into the tunnel. Nothing phased us anymore. Not the insects that skittered across our skin. Not the jagged rocks that tore at our clothes and scraped raw lines down our arms. Even the clustered holes burrowed into the walls, the ones that once made my stomach churn, barely registered now.

Jacob's voice was barely above a whisper. "I think it is gone."

We did not respond. We did not need to. The silence was thick, our breaths shallow.

We finally emerged from the crevice, back into the main tunnel. The walls were smeared with something dark. Blood, or whatever was left of Michael, mixed with a sizzling liquid that hissed softly against the dirt. The air stung our nostrils. It was metallic and acidic. We did not dare look too closely.

And then we saw it. The shaft. A narrow hole above, the same one we had seen before. Only this time sunlight filtered through in a faint shimmer.

"There," Spencer gasped. "We just have to climb."

Without another word, we scrambled forward, our hands clawing at the soft earth. The ground gave slightly with every push, but we dug in harder. Desperate. Frantic. Our nails filled with dirt, our fingers trembling. Bit by bit, we carved our way up.

No one looked down.

"It is the hole," he said, staring down. "The one we found earlier."
