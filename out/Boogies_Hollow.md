Hi, my name is Matt. Many of you might know me from the vlog Explorxs314. As you can guess, I run an urban exploration vlog with my group of friends—we call ourselves "The Explorxs." Anyway, lately, someone named JudeMax397 reached out to me about a place in West Virginia. He told me he’s seen my videos and thought we might be interested in this spot, so I’m here to ask... Has anyone here ever heard of a place called Big Bang Boogie’s?

I’ve been digging through old newspapers and files that this Jude guy sent me, and the history of this place is just disturbing—and, to be honest, a bit far-fetched. Regardless, the place is located in Lakefield, West Virginia, and from what I’ve been told, it’s been sealed shut with concrete for years. No one has stepped foot inside since a horrific event took place, and nobody dares to go near it.

It all started in 1978. An entrepreneur of unknown identity—rumored to have come from California with millions—built an empire out of thin air. For its time, the venue was insane: massive ball pits, the latest arcade machines, and a cast of computer-animated mechanical mascots that supposedly stood between 8 and 10 feet tall. These mascots sang and danced for the visitors.

The main band consisted of the MC: Astro the Dog, Bongo the Monkey on guitar, Chirpy Le' Chipmunk on keyboard, and the drummer, Kid Billy Beat. Additionally, there were the "play zone" cats named Salty K. Mossgrove and Freshy C. Mossgrove, two sailor themed sibling cats. Apparently, they were wonders of pneumatic engineering for the era despite the low budget. They were beloved by the local children, who celebrated their birthdays there every year.

Rumors say the owner made the mistake of building on land that local natives considered forbidden. Testimonies from former employees I managed to contact claimed they saw silhouettes moving between the curtains, that the balls in the pit moved as if something were swimming beneath them, and that plushies would fall off the counters on their own. During the final shifts before closing, employees swore they saw and heard doors slamming, felt their hair being pulled, and heard... voices.

Legends say an entity that had been imprisoned by the natives inhabited the land and was awakened by the restaurant. No one knows exactly what it is; some mention an alien, others a demon, others simply something inexplicable. This is told by the town’s oldest residents—elderly people who supposedly didn't attend the party because they sensed something was wrong and that a tragedy was coming.

It all ended during the town’s 90th Anniversary party in 1992. The venue, chosen by the town for the celebration, was packed to capacity. Boys and girls of all ages, young employees serving food, clowns hired for the show, local businessmen, and entire families were celebrating with joy. What happened next is unknown. Rumors indicate the doors were blocked from the outside. The whereabouts of the 270 people inside were never discovered; they simply vanished. There is no evidence of a mass murder, nor any sign of the owner or even the mayor, who was also there. Dozens of families had disappeared without any trace.

Upon entering and searching the area, local authorities found nothing. No blood, no bodies, no clues. Just the animatronic mascots, completely motionless with their instruments in hand, the curtains of their stages open as if they were in a standby state—not off, not on, just static. The ovens still had warm pizza, the tables still had cups of cold soda, the carousel was still spinning, and the arcade machines were still running. The mascots seemed to have cracks around their knee joints, but due to a lack of information and surveillance footage, the place was cut off and boarded up that same week.

It was a desperate act by the authorities to calm the rage of the remaining inhabitants, who were fully prepared to demolish the cursed building. The local police prevented this, claiming that doing so would compromise the local forest and the apple orchards that provided the town's livelihood, putting the fauna and the residents at risk. Consequently, the place was permanently sealed. The parking lot entrances were blocked with large dry logs as a barricade, and signs were posted claiming it was a cursed zone. Road signs promoting Lakefield as the home of Big Bang Boogie’s were removed, leaving it as just another ghost town with barely 190 residents today.

They say the place is still there, intact on the inside but cursed, waiting—with those old mascots waiting in the dark. Squatters say you can still hear a commotion inside: laughter, 80s music at full volume, and a joyful atmosphere, despite the concrete walls that sealed the building shut.

My friends and I decided to go and document the building for the vlog! JudeMax397 told us there’s a rear maintenance door that apparently wasn't sealed, so we could get in through there. It seemed like a pretty silly story to us, honestly—who’s going to believe an entire town disappeared in a simple restaurant? Anyway, my dad is going on a business trip to Mississippi tomorrow, August 15th, so we can travel on the 16th! We’ll all go in my friend Henry’s van. We could even take this to local TV if we do it right. Even though it’s a 7-hour drive, it might be worth it! Stay tuned for the next episode where we visit this place on the vlog!

Matt and his 9 friends were last seen on gas station cameras, buying sandwiches, water bottles, and snacks, and refueling. They were reported missing on August 20, 2005. The message was traced back to the town of Lakefield, West Virginia. The van the young people were traveling in was found; local deputies inspected the site and its surroundings, but the alleged open door was never found. Neither the door, nor the young people...
