I spent this morning watching the camera feeds after I returned from the management office last night.

No gaps.  
Every second accounted for.

I didn’t know what to do. 

Not after what I’d seen on that report.  
Not after realising they knew exactly when my cameras went blind.

But sitting in my apartment pretending nothing was happening didn’t feel right.

It felt like something had changed.

By early afternoon, I couldn’t stand it anymore.  
I went back down to the management office.

The woman was there again.  
Same smile.

“Hi,” she said. “How can I help you?”

“I came in earlier this week,” I said. “About the tenant name on my unit, 2B.”

She nodded as if she remembered.

“I just wanted to check if anything was updated,” I said.

She turned to her screen.  
Typed.  
Paused.

“No,” she said pleasantly. “Everything looks the same.”

“What does it look like?” I asked.

She tilted the monitor just enough for me to see.

UNIT 2B  
STATUS: OCCUPIED  
ACCOUNT: ACTIVE

Still no name.

But there was something new underneath it.

A small grey line of text I hadn’t seen before.

**CONTINUITY HOLD — STABLE**

“What does that mean?” I asked.

She glanced at the screen, then back at me.

“Oh,” she said. “That’s just internal. You don’t need to worry about it.”

“Why does my apartment have it?”

She smiled, the same way someone does when they’re used to answering questions that don’t really matter.

“All active units do,” she said.

I didn’t believe her.

When she turned away to grab something, I leaned backward.

The board with the spare key rings was directly behind me.

There was one labeled with the management office.

I slipped it off the hook and into my pocket before I could talk myself out of it.

I don’t know why I did it, but I needed to get back into that office. Alone. And I couldn't risk it being locked after closing.

I said some small pleasantries and left as soon as I could.

Back in my apartment I waited until after midnight.

The cameras were still running.  
Still clean.  
Still whole.

No gaps.

I went back down to the office.

The door was unlocked again, but I kept the key.

I went straight to the computer.

This time I didn’t start with the Continuity folder’s report on my unit.

I went to the other folders. I started with Maintenance. Then I saw one labeled:

**MAINTENANCE — STRUCTURAL**.

I opened it and found blueprints, structural diagrams, old scans of yellowed paper.

At first they looked normal. Floor plans. Stairwells. Utility shafts.

Then, as I kept scrolling, I noticed the parts that didn’t match the building I lived in.

There were extra levels beneath the basement.

Not one or two.

Five.

Long, narrow spaces marked with warnings instead of names.

Not storage. Not utilities.

Just a stacked set of notes labeled with:

**ANCHOR ZONE**  
**LOAD DISTRIBUTION**  
**STABILITY BUFFER**

I kept scrolling.

The deeper the level, the more distorted the drawings became.

Walls curved where they shouldn’t. Corridors folded back on themselves.

One of the sublevels wasn’t even fully enclosed.

It was drawn like something had pushed up into the foundation from below.

Like pressure or a bulge.

I clicked into the notes.

Lines of text filled the screen.

*Structural drift increasing in lower strata.*  
*Reality softening detected along anchor seams.*  
*Occupant attention load compensating for decay.*  
*No physical repairs possible at this depth.*

I started to feel something in my chest again, but I needed to know more.

Next, I opened a file labelled **ANCHORING NOTES**.

It was old.  
The formatting barely held together.

Most of it was technical language I didn’t understand.

But some of it wasn’t.

*Reality drift observed in lower levels.*  
*Containment pressure increasing.*  
*Occupant load must remain above minimum threshold*.

I kept scrolling, my hands shaking.

There were handwritten scans.  
Margins filled with notes.

**Do not allow prolonged vacancy.**  
**Human routine stabilizes the fault.**  
**Attention is structural.**

One sentence was circled in red ink so many times the scanned paper beneath it was torn.

**Without continuous presence, it spreads.**

A slow realisation came over me.

This building was built over something.  
Around it.

My mind was spinning, not able to comprehend what I was reading. I went back to the **Continuity** reports.

Not just my unit this time. But I could see every apartment in the building was listed there.

Unit numbers.  
Percentages.  
Time blocks.

Some of them were marked in green.

STABLE.

Others were yellow.

DEGRADED.

A few were red.

VACANT.

The red ones were empty apartments.

The yellow ones had notes beside them.

*Routine irregular.*  
*Attention drop.*  
*Occupant instability.*

My unit was green.

Unit 2B — ADEQUATE.

I clicked into it again. Not sure what difference I was expecting to see.

But the layout of the report wasn't the same this time, it appeared more like a usage log, with time stamps, durations and something labelled:

**CONTINUITY CONTRIBUTION**

The last times logged matched exactly the gaps in my camera footage from the previous night.

Another line appeared further down.

**SIPHON RATE WITHIN ACCEPTABLE RANGE**

I didn’t know what this meant, without making wild, terrifying guesses.

So I went back to the blueprints.

To the warped lower levels.

To that shape pushing up into the foundation.

I was waiting for my brain to reject what I was seeing.

To offer me something sane instead.

I kept reading.

The language was dry. Clinical.

*Reality softening detected along anchor seams.*

*Occupant attention load compensating for decay.*

Like something was pushing and wanted to spread.

I couldn't stop myself now, I clicked through more pages and reports.

Most of them weren’t dramatic.

Just numbers and percentages.  
Warnings when certain thresholds dipped too low.

But I found another document titled:

**SUBLEVEL STABILITY**

The diagram that came up made my stomach turn.

It wasn’t a map.

It was a cross-section.

The building.  
The ground beneath it.  
And something underneath that, confirming there was something pressing upward against the foundation like a blister.

Not drawn with edges, but with distortion.

I couldn’t tell where it ended or where the building began.

I tried to zoom in, but the lines warped instead of sharpening.

I remembered the laundry room.

The way sound carried wrong.

The way time felt loose.

The way I never felt completely alone down there.

My hands were slick with sweat now.

I kept reading.

*Anchor drift accelerating.*

*Containment stress rising.*

*Continuous human presence required.*

**Presence.**

Not repairs.

Not machines.

People.

I thought about my own unit, still marked OCCUPIED even without my name.

I thought about the missing hours.

The gaps.

The way things kept happening even when I wasn’t there to do them.

I closed the file.

My reflection was faintly visible in the dark monitor.

I looked pale.

I didn’t want to think it, but I couldn’t get away from it.

This building is here to contain something.

Something that is pushing.

And as long as it keeps getting what it needs from the people above it…

from the routines, the presence, the occupied units…

it doesn’t have to come through.
