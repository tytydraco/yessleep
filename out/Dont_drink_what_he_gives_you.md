Like any other Friday night, I went to a party with my best friend Bree. Sometimes we go to parties that are being hosted by people that we know. Sometimes we go to random parties that she finds. It's always been a fun thing that we do. We even play a game, we call it, "Hooked", whoever hooks up or flirts with the most guys win.

It's really silly and makes it sound like we're begging for stds. I'm pretty sure the reason we did it and called it a game was because it made her feel less of like a.. girl that likes to have fun. However, after the events that occurred, I told myself that I will never play that game again. 

A couple years ago, in 2017, I went to a party sometime in October. I vividly remember it being a Halloween party.

We went to a couple Halloween parties that year. However, this Halloween party that I'm going to describe is the last one I've ever attended because of the horrors that took over the night. 

I remember, it was like any other party that we attended during that month. We were both wearing matching black cat costumes and ready to flirt with a bunch guys and get drunk.

Thinking back on it, I wish I wouldn't have ignored all of the obvious red flags. The first bright red flag was the fact that Bree didn't know a single person that was there. Not a single familar soul. Normally, that wouldn't be a issue, but it was because the neighborhood was known to be very dangerous. Lots of people had been going missing. The bodies would always show up again, but never in one piece. What can I say? We were young and dumb.

I was young, dumb, and unfortunately a people pleaser which is why I didn't tell Bree no. 

When we arrived at the party, it seemed normal. Everyone seemed pretty outgoing and friendly. We were talking to everyone and getting to know everyone until Bree saw a guy that she thought was quite attractive. She has very poor taste and will go for any guy as long as he breathes air.

She left me all by self to go flirt with the guy and I was all alone. I felt lonely and awkward. I also knew that I have to try to win the game so I walked around and was checking out several guys. I chatted with a couple but my eyes really locked onto to this one particular guy. It's not that he was attractive but it was something about his aura that I found intriguing. Looking back on it, I should've never interacted him. Perhaps I didn't find the aura intriguing, maybe it was a danger alarm inside my system that was glitched. 

Regardless of what it was, I approached him. We talked for awhile and he even got me to giggle a bit. We were in the middle of some boring topic that I don't remember. But, I do remember him handing me a drink.

It was a beverage that I assumed was being served to everyone at the party so I wasn't skeptical about it. He also asked me if I'd go outside and take a walk with him. I impulsively agreed.

The walk felt so dreamy together. He was funny, seemingly romantic, and had me intrigued. I was starting to think of him as more than a game. Potentially a friend or something more. My dreams suddenly started to fade away faster than the speed of light as I took each sip. 

Each sip was a second closer to my almost demise.
My mind started to get blurry and I started to feel weak. I informed him that I wasn't feeling well and then he started laughing. He was laughing, non-stop and had the biggest and most horrifying smile I've ever seen.

He pushed me to the ground and pull out a knife. He whispered in my year, telling me that this happens all the time and that he loves stupid victims. He told me he was gonna enjoy cutting me into pieces.

I was crying, my tears were literally creating rivers. That's what it seemed like. I was pleading for my life. The knife almost slit my throat but Bree and the guy she was with jumped him. 

You would think it ends with him getting arrested, right? Unfortunately, he was very strong and fought back. He ran away. I called the police, talked to them, gave them a description, and did everything I could to help. They couldn't find him though. There's not a single trace of him anywhere. I search on Google abd social media all of the time but there's nothing that could help me find him. 

It's like he vanished. I will never drink another beverage from a stranger for the rest of my life. And I hope he gets found one day. On the bright side, the crimes have stopped in that neighborhood. They stopped after that dreadful night. On the not so bright side, similar crimes have recently started again.

All I have to say is, don't drink what he gives you.
