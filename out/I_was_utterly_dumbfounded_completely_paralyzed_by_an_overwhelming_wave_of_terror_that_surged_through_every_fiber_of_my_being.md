I was a high school girl dancing upon the tight rope of adolescence, with eyes of curiosity. As we cherished the small pleasures like my friends' lunch boxes and the opportunity to catch up on some sleep. 
Being an average student, I was quite satisfied with my life.


There was this girl in our class, she was friends with none, expect a few. Some said she was the daughter of an abusive father. We've found the girl crying in the bathroom multiple times. She used to come with bruises on her hands and red cut marks on her face. We were too young to help her, and she was too young to stand up. The constant fear and anxiety was visible in her eyes. She isolated herself from her classmates and even the teachers.


It was the month of July, I woke up to the pitter patter of rain falling outside my window. I went to the bathroom to freshen up, my mom yelled from downstairs,
" Get ready and come have your breakfast!!!! You're already late "
As I was having my breakfast the sky became overcast and the clouds rushed in like huge smokey Manchurian balls. The weather soon because stormy as I was tying my shoes, my mood immediately lifted up thinking most of the teachers will be absent so it'll be fun. I went school and wasn't shocked to see how few people have actually came. But it was a bit tautness among the teachers i noticed. We had a play period that day and being a sleepyhead I used to sleep in class during play periods.


That day i thought it would rain outside and everyone will stay in class but to my surprise it was sunlit outside as everyone rushed out of the class the moment the gardener hammered the bell. Our PE teacher announced two periods of PE as the teacher who was about to take the next class was absent.I was on cloud nine.


 I went to the washroom. As i made my way to the washroom, i couldn't help but notice the unusual stillness in the air. The usual bustling sounds of students running around seemed to have disappeared, leaving behind an eerie silence. 
The washroom i went to was an old one that wasn't frequently used by many people. Despite its lack of occupancy, it remained clean and dry. However, one issue in that washroom was the lighting. 
Fortunately there was a large square window which allowed natural light to fill in. But the gloomy weather outside had also dimmed the natural light that usually filtered through the window. 


When I was done I went to wash my face. As i splashed water on my face, trying to shake off the unsettling atmosphere, a peculiar noise reached my earsâ€”a faint sound of someone crying..
But the sound was familiar to me because it was not the first time I had encountered this situation. As i knew it was the same girl who used to get abused by her father. This washroom held a significance for the girl, becoming a space where she felt comfortable expressing her emotions. I slowly turned to face the bathroom door, 
"Hey, don't cry it's gonna be okay. Trust me" 
I heard groans and silent weeps, as she replied with a soft ''hmmm". 


The next day i visited my friends place. As we were discussing random topics during the evening. With a casual tone, i began recounting the previous day's incident. And i noticed a look of confusion on her face. I paused and asked her what she's thinking. She replied with a laughter, 
"Hey, stop are trying to scare me?"I found myself confused, 
"What do you mean??"
She replied,
" Don't you know..... she hanged herself last week..."
