I’m in my late 30s, and I’m still afraid of clowns. I’m not ashamed to admit it, even though everyone who knows laughs at me. What they don’t understand is that it’s not an irrational fear. If they had seen what I saw, they would be afraid too. Especially if they saw them in places they shouldn’t be… like a storm drain.

It’s been 27 years since that afternoon, and I can still feel its gaze in the dark. The echo of the screams still haunts me. It was a school-free Saturday, and I decided to fly my kite at the park. The week had been warm, but that day, something changed. The sky, so clear for days, was suddenly swallowed by clouds in mere minutes, as if it knew what was about to happen. It was as if the entire universe had been waiting for something to awaken.

When the first drop of rain fell, a shiver ran down my spine. The wind howled through the trees, and a clap of thunder felt like a warning. I knew it was time to go home before the storm got worse. I ran down the street, holding tight to my kite to keep it from flying away, when suddenly, I heard a voice.

“Hey! I’m down here.”

I stopped in my tracks, turning my head to see who had spoken. There was no one around… but then I heard it again. This time, it came from below.

“Down here!”

I looked down and saw the drain right in front of me. Something shifted in the shadows. Curious and slightly nervous, I crouched down to take a closer look.

“How did you get down there?” I asked, squinting to make out a face.

“The rain dragged me down here,” the voice replied, strangely calm, almost like it was pretending. “Please, help me get out.”

“I’ll call my dad. He’s a plumber; he’ll know how to help you.”

“No!” the voice snapped, sharp and irritated. “There’s no time. The water’s rising fast. I’ll drown. Just give me your hand.”

The desperation in the voice made me hesitate. I knelt closer to the drain, uneasy but unsure.

“Hurry!” it begged. “The water’s already at my neck.”

I was about to extend my hand when a flash of lightning lit up the sky, and for a brief moment, the drain was illuminated. What I saw froze the blood in my veins.

It was a clown, but not a real one. It was something pretending to be human. Its head was grotesquely large, its eyes were bottomless pits that swallowed the light, and its smile… it wasn’t a smile. It was a gaping curve of jagged teeth that gleamed in the flash of lightning.

I froze. My mind screamed that it wasn’t real, that it was just my imagination. But when I blinked, its face had changed. It was the face of my dead uncle.

“Help me, please,” it begged, the voice unmistakably his.

Panic consumed me. Every instinct screamed at me to run, but my legs refused to move. Then, another clap of thunder jolted me back to life. My body acted on pure instinct, and I ran as fast as I could, never looking back.

I got home soaked with rain, tears, and fear. My mom tried to comfort me, but I couldn’t speak. I just shook uncontrollably. From the safety of my room, I decided to look out the window. Maybe it had all been a bad dream.

The drain was still there, dark and quiet. But then, I saw him. My friend, the one we called “Little G,” was chasing a paper boat as it floated on the stream of rainwater. His face was full of excitement, completely oblivious to the danger.

The boat disappeared into the drain, and he leaned down to follow it. Another flash of lightning lit up the sky, and there it was again. The clown. This time, it looked straight at me. Its deformed face stretched into a smile as it raised a finger to its lips, shushing me.

I dove under my blankets, trembling, but the silence didn’t last long. It was shattered by screams. Little G’s screams. His voice calling for help still echoes in my mind.

Now, 27 years later, my son has gone missing. His friend told us he saw a clown take him. And I know the truth. He’s back. He still remembers me.
