It all began with a premise:

To understand why ancient Egyptian king lists—those that historians label as "mythological"—mention reigns lasting thousands, even tens of thousands of years.

I'm talking about the gods Ra, Osiris, Thoth, Horus... and then, the enigmatic Shemsu Hor, the "followers of Horus," who ruled before any human pharaoh.

Documents like the Turin King List, the Palermo Stone, Sumerian texts, and the Babylonian Chronicles—they all echo the same theme: once, gods lived for millennia. Not years. Millennia. But mainstream history dismisses this as mere symbolism. A myth. They call it “poetry.”

No way.

I discovered it wasn’t poetry. It was memory.

A memory so ancient that it's beyond our current understanding. A memory from a time when time itself was different. Longer. Slower. Gentler.

And then it hit me: it wasn’t that the gods lived longer because they were immortal. It was that time itself was different.

We live inside a fractal.

A fractal isn't just a repeated shape. It's a structure that replicates itself within itself, each iteration smaller and faster. In geometry, this looks beautiful. But with time…

it's a verdict.

Initially, time was a long cycle. A single reign lasted what would now be thousands of years. Then, the cycle fractured. There were no longer single gods, but lineages of semi-divine kings.

Each cycle shorter than the last.

Then came the human pharaohs.

Then, the emperors.

Then, the kings.

Then, the presidents.

Then, the influencers.

And now… us. You. Me. A cycle barely lasting 70 or 80 years if we’re lucky.

Don’t you see? Everything is speeding up.

Everything is shrinking.

Wars last days; I can't imagine a high-intensity war stretching more than a few weeks.

Governments, a breath.

News, minutes.

Fashions, seconds.

Thoughts... micro-moments.

We are nearing the edge of the fractal.

And when that happens, the pattern can't continue.

A few nights ago, I dreamed of a figure I couldn’t look directly at. It was like an eclipse shrouded in noise. It spoke without words, showing me a spiraling pattern. Each turn tighter. Faster. Denser.

And it left me with words branded into my skin as though seared by fire:

“It wasn’t you aging. It was the cycle collapsing.”

“You didn’t live briefly. You lived an entire compressed fractal.”

“The reset is coming.”

Since then, I can’t sleep. Because every time I close my eyes, I feel it drawing nearer.

A final compression.

A signal.

An echo of what we were before we were human.

What if everything we call mythology is just how the previous cycle left us instructions?

What if the pyramids, the gods, the chants, the symbols... were warnings?

What if all this—your body, your life, your mind—is just the last cell of an ancient organism, now disintegrating to start anew?

I don’t know how much time I have left. Nor how much you do.

But if this story has reached you, it’s because something in the pattern is touching you.

And when the endless night arrives—the night with no tomorrow—you’ll remember you already knew this.

Because this is not a myth.

It never was.

It’s a fractal unfolding.

And you are right at the last fold.

Where time no longer stretches.

Where all that remains… is the echo.
