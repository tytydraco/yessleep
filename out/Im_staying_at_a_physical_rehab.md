Hey y’all, my name is Barry. First I would like to apologize for any grammar issues. I got this smart phone recently and trying to figure out how it works. I’m at the young age of eighty.

I’m sharing this because I was told this is the place to share your stories of things that are..odd. It even says that people here will believe you. My kids aren’t believing me, so maybe you will. 

I grew up through some hard times. I grew up in a tiny cabin about a mile off a road with seven other siblings. We didn’t have any electricity. We took our baths in the river or put a tub near a fire when the weather was cold. We had to stick hay in the holes of the cabin during winter to help insulate it. 

My parents weren’t always around. My grandpa was until his time came when I was still a teenager. I helped take care of the family how I had to, making and running moonshine. 

By the time I was twenty, I married Patsy. She has been the greatest thing to happen to me. We’ve been married for sixty years.

I was able to get into some factory work eventually and did a little farming on the side. We have four kids, seven grandkids, and two great grand babies so far. 

I’ve had a very blessed life. Me and Patsy have been spending our Sundays at church and our Saturdays at the farmers market. We also go to Pigeon Forge twice a year in my 1967 mustang.

I was taking picking tomatoes out of the garden when I fell hard. I’m thankful it wasn’t any worse than it was, but it still caused its damage. 

I’m currently having to stay at this physical rehabilitation center while I learn how to walk again. I’ve been blessed that I’ve had family and church members visiting me. 

The reason I’m writing this down is because of my roommate, Willy. 

Willy appears to others like a normal person. He served in the Vietnam war and lived through all kinds of trauma. He never married and most of his relatives have passed on. What really creeped me out is when he said he was in Vietnam, something crawled up his nose and his life was never the same. I assumed maybe he was hallucinating or something because he did admit he did a lot of drugs back in the day. 

The fifth night I stayed, I woke up and he was sitting up in his bed. I heard a light hissing noise as if a snake was in our room. I said his name and his head twisted to me and I could have sworn his eyes looked just like a snakes. He claimed to have no idea about it the next day. 

A few days go by and I awoke to him out of the bed on all fours and making roaring noises, just like a lion. He didn’t sound like a lion, just like an old man pretending to be. I hit the help button and as the nurse came in, he collapsed and they believed he fell out of bed. I asked him again and he claimed to have no idea.

I’d watch for when they had to help him get to the bathroom and how he’d struggle to take the smallest of steps. 

Willy was sleeping when my darling wife came for her daily visit. The kind CN helped wheel me to a beautiful outside patio area. Birds were singing and a relaxing a pound of water trickling down into a small koi pond. 

I explained to her about Willy and she didn’t believe me. She assumed I was taking some funny medicine but she did try her best to see if admin could put me in another room. She even threatened to pull me out and take me to a different facility. Of course insurance wasn’t letting that happen just yet. My kids came by to visit and snuck me in some pie. I told them too but they looked at me like lobsters were crawling out of my ears. But everything changed last night.

Me and Willy were laying in our beds and a kind CN named Troy popped his head in to see if we needed anything. 

We had a small tv to share and we were lucky enough to stumble across The Andy Griffith Show. 

“Mr. Willy, do you ever recall waking up in the middle of the night?”

He looked at me with concern, “no, I mean I know I fell out of bed recently. I still can’t figure that one out. Usually I’m lucky enough for a full nights rest.” 

I fell asleep after Troy helped me get to the bathroom. They told us we could use our diapers if we needed to but I certainly wasn’t going to if I could help it. 

I awoke to seeing Willy standing above my bed. He was grunting and began to pound his chest. He let out a gorilla imitated roar. I pushed the help button in my bedside. 

Troy came in rather quickly and seen the animal standing before him.

“Willy, what are you-“

He grabbed Willy and ripped his face off. He began beating his body with incredible strength no elderly man could possibly have. Troy screamed loud enough that other employees ran to see the commotion. 

He quickly turned and on all fours jumped out the window, shattering glass and causing a loud pop. 

One of the ladies pulled her phone out and explained an old man escaped and killed an employee. I began to scream and another lady grabbed him hand to try to comfort me. 

I laid in the bed until the police came to see the scene. An officer sat next to my bed as I recalled the entire conversation. He must have thought I was crazy too, but they couldn’t find a better explanation on how an old man jumped through a window and made a run for it.

“Did y’all find him?”

He looked up from his report.

“I said did y’all find him.”

“Yes sir, we found him.”

“What happened?” He took a deep breath and took a sip from his coffee. 

“Well, we found him pretty quickly. He climbed a tree and we shined a light on him. He jumped on top of another officer and his partner unloaded the magazine into him.”

“So he is-“

“Dead. Sorry for you to hear this. They claimed something crawled out of his nose too.”

My wife got to me as quick as she heard the news. They couldn’t keep me in that room with a broken window, I got transferred to another facility with a bigger room and no roommates.

All I can ask if that you please believe an old person when they tell you something, even if it sounds crazy. It might be you one day who needs someone to believe them.
