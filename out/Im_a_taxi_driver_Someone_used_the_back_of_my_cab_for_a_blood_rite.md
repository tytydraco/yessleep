This is a warning. 

To all those who drive taxis, Uber, Lyft, or who ferry people from place to place for a living - please heed my caution, and pass these words along to those who need to hear them. They could be in grave danger. They need to be made aware of this threat.

I narrowly escaped with a few broken bones. My coworker was not so lucky. 

When I first collected that client, I had no reason to suspect anything sinister. We really do serve all walks of life driving the city routes at night - from actors lying low to lowlifes acting up, and everything between. This guy sat in a deadzone on my social radar. Late teens or early twenties. Blue jeans, slate-grey hoodie, drawn up. Black trainers, black backpack. Nothing branded, all plain; the definition of anonymity. 

He asked me to drive straight, didn't specify a destination. He slumped forwards a little and kept his head down for the whole journey - all three minutes of it. I tried to spark up a conversation, but the guy was a vacuum: 

"Busy night?" 

"Yes." 

"Where are you headed?" 

"Along here." 

"Where you from?" 

"Elsewhere." 

Nothing unusual in that, in and of itself. We're an especially sociable species, drivers - but we respect that not everyone works the same way. Some distance along the road, he asked me to stop, paid, and got out. No thanks, no acknowledgement. Transactional. 

I thought little of it until I collected my next fare, a poorly shaved thirty-something middle-manager riding high on powder and a promotion. In the midst of his excited rambling he let out a sudden yelp like a kicked puppy. "There's blood back here," he whined, and lifted his foot from the floor to look more closely. "You can get blood out of suede, right?" 

I didn't know, but I already had plenty of experience washing it out of my car. Five years of city routes will do that. What I couldn't grasp was where the blood came from. It had been an uneventful shift - no drama, no bar brawls, no hospital trips - and yet, here in the footwell sat an undeniable puddle of violence. 

I was talking it through with the other drivers at the depot when one chimed in to say my story sounded familiar. They suggested I speak to Doug about it. 

A quick word about Doug: "Scummy." That's the quick word. His uncle owns the taxi firm, so he feels like he can get away with a lot of sketchy stuff. Free rides and spy cameras, that sort of sketchy. 

Sure enough, he dragged me over to the company computer station as soon as he heard my story, telling me I needed to see something. In two minutes he'd flicked through files and folders more organised than the firm's accounts, and pulled up a grainy recording. 

From the angle we were looking at, the camera must have been embedded low down in the back door of Doug's taxi. If we had an HR department, they would have a field day with Doug and his niche interests. I tried to ignore his commentary about the ankles on show and who they were attached to, and encouraged him to fast-forward through the day. 

Sure enough, a pair of nondescript black trainers slid into view, with a black backpack dropping between them and the far door. My mystery rider was on board. 

"Wait 'til you see what he does," Doug sneered. "It's messed up." 

The passenger reached into his backpack with a gloved hand as the car started to move. Out came two items, adding fuel to my burning intrigue: first, a bundle of straw in the vague form of a doll, the limbs and chest tightly bound with red ribbon; second, a set of garden scissors. 

"This is messed up, man," Doug reiterated with a deep laugh. I couldn't tell if his tone was masking discomfort, or if he was genuinely enjoying this footage. 

On the screen, the figure pulled off one of his gloves to reveal a hand wrapped in scarlet-smeared bandages, which he began to quickly unravel. A knot formed in my stomach as I saw that he was missing the two shorter fingers on his left hand. The wounds were bright red. Raw and recent.

The doll was dropped into the footwell, and he held his stumps over it. Steady-handed, he slipped the blades of the garden scissors around the base of his middle finger, and closed them. He directed the ensuing flow of blood directly over the straw doll. 

I don't know how long my hand had been clamped around my mouth for. Doug was watching me with gritted teeth as he stopped the video. We stayed silent for a while, soaking in the horror of this experience. My skin felt ready to crawl off my shoulders. After what felt like an hour, I picked up the company phone. 

The police didn't want to know. All they offered was a welfare check - but with no identifying features and no way of figuring out this guy's address, the idea was quickly dropped. "Let us know if anything else happens," they said. A token gesture.  In reality, were on our own with this. 

I called around every taxi firm operating in the local area. Someone else must have seen him - he'd clearly removed two of his fingers before getting into Doug's car to take the third, and a fourth in mine. The message was passed around.

I hardly slept before signing on for my next shift, dragging myself to the depot like a boulder was tied to each ankle. Doug was waiting for me at the office door, bags under his manic eyes, stinking of sweat and cigarettes. I doubt he'd fared much better overnight. He said he had news, and I saw he'd been busy. 

On the office wall hung a massive map of the city, over which Doug had drawn four thick red lines. He'd heard back from two other companies about the missing trips, and had plotted their routes over the map. They overlapped at regular intervals. 

An enormous pentagram was being painted across the city in blood. One line was remaining. 

Doug told me the lines had been drawn on consecutive nights. We could see where this kid was going to draw next, and it was going to be tonight. He told me he'd already pleaded with the police for help, but was dismissed. He asked for my help in putting a stop to whatever this kid was trying to do. 

Truth be told, I had no idea what was going on. Some sort of ritual? An art project? Political activism? Regardless, it felt wrong. It felt sinister, and we were the only people in a position to do anything about it, and we had to move quickly. We left without even discussing a plan. 

I radioed the rest of our working drivers and called every other company in the area while Doug drove us to the start of the fifth line. We scanned the street for any sign of our mystery man. Chances were, he was going to be wearing the same getup. Dark and anonymous, hood raised, with that black rucksack. 

It was a busy part of the city at that time of night. Bars were taking in and turning out in equal measure. The traffic flow was a steady river, pedestrians weaving through like spawning salmon fighting a current, either blinkered by a haze of booze and drugs or keeping their heads down for fear of being noticed by the first group. 

Still, it barely took five minutes to spot him. 

Doug was out of the cab and darting between cars before I'd undone my seat belt. He wasn't subtle in his approach, and the kid took off with a sprint. I barged my way past pedestrians trying to keep them both in sight. Maybe it was the blood loss, but the kid didn't have much of a lead.  

They disappeared into an alley between two shops closed for the night. My phone was ringing as I rounded the corner after them. 

Doug was looming over the kid, his fists clenched. The kid was on the floor, his nose blooded, feebly scrambling away from his assailant between two industrial bins. Doug took another step. 

I shouted his name to stop him in his tracks. He looked back over his shoulder at me, adrenaline knotting his features into a furious snarl. I held up a hand, signalling for him to hold off as I took the call. The kid wasn't going anywhere. 

It was another driver on the phone, working for a different company. They'd been given my number by their boss, who'd told them to keep an eye out for our sinister passenger. They'd found him. They dropped him off a few minutes ago, after a wordless, straight-line journey. They found blood in the footwell. 

My words caught in my throat. We had been waiting on the wrong side of the line. The massive blood-painted star sigil had already been completed. I didn't know what that meant, but I felt a deep and primal fear grip my stomach. 

Behind Doug, the kid was reaching into his bag with his good hand, muttering something unintelligible. He pulled out that scarlet-stained straw doll and threw it across the floor. It landed at Doug's feet. 

I've been telling myself that what happened next only took a few seconds. I've been telling myself that freezing in the face of danger is a natural response. I could have rushed to help Doug. I could have ran to seek help. I didn't. I froze. Maybe I was struggling to make sense of what I was watching. Maybe I was watching my whole understanding of the world unravel, the flailing threads baring a darker and more intangible reality than the design they first presented. 

The straw doll reached up and grabbed Doug's ankle. Its little fist was growing, its grip clearly tightening as Doug let out a stream of shrill profanity. It stood, its shoulders rising to the height of Doug's and beyond. It lifted its massive arm, holding Doug aloft by his ankle, his head and flailing arms fully twice his own height above the concrete. Still the thing was swelling, the bulk of its straw shoulders trying the limits of the alleyway. 

The kid was clinging to this creature's back as it expanded, whispering at the side of its head. It looked like it was feeding off his words, taking nourishment. 

Doug's panicked shouts gave way to a wild shriek of a scream as the thing took hold of his other leg, pulling them apart with a steady, deliberate motion. Doug's torso gave way like torn tissue paper, offering little resistance to this creature's immense strength. Vain spasms of life shook his two halves, their jagged split spilling crimson and yellow. Warm blood splashed my face from the impact of his organs on the concrete. 

I stared aghast at this bloodstained colossus of straw and its hooded rider. My feet were anchored to the floor, but the legs of this giant were not so shackled. I watched transfixed as it raised an enormous limb of straw, and brought it down upon me, as if crushing a bug underfoot.  

* 

I am told I was unconscious for three days. Both my arms were broken in multiple places. My left leg had an open fracture. I broke three ribs and both shoulders. Somehow, I survived. 

The investigation into Doug's death is officially still ongoing. Of course, the police didn't believe my story in the least - but it was even less likely that I'd have been able to rip my coworker in half and then crush myself as a cover story. The footage from Doug's car and corroborating testimony from several other drivers was enough to point them in the direction of our fingerless passenger, and I gather they found his blood at the scene, but so far there's no sign of him or his straw golem. 

This is, ultimately, a warning. To all of you who ferry people around for a living. Be cautious who you pick up, and what they get up to in the back. The blood in the footwell, the straight-line journey to nowhere - if any of this sounds familiar, call the police, or contact me directly. 

Now that the kid knows this thing works, there's no telling what could happen next, or where.
