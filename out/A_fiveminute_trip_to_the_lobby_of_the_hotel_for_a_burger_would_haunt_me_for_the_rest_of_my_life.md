In September of 2014, my daughter was kidnapped the night before her first birthday.

A five-minute trip to the lobby of the hotel for a burger would haunt me for the rest of my life.  
  
My wife and I were traveling to visit her friends and family in the Chicago area, a trip we made at least once a year since we met right after college to visit her relatives.  
  
That year, we decided to take on the twelve-hour drive from our home in Charlotte because we feared our daughter wouldn’t handle the flight very well, and this allowed us to lug all of the baby gear with us. We crammed a Pack ‘N Play, booster seat, kids’ bath, toys, tons of diapers, and a small bag with some clothes for us into our sedan and hit the road.

We had decided we would split the drive into two days and stop in Louisville on the way because it was a good halfway point and where my wife went to college. Once we got settled into our hotel room, the baby was asleep, so I told my wife to go see friends while we were in town, and I’d hang back with our kid and order room service.

 After watching a horror movie on the free HBO channel, I was starting to feel hungry. It was 8 pm, and the room service kitchen was closed, so I decided to order something from DoorDash to be delivered.  
  
Our hotel required key access to get to different floors in the hotel, so when the DoorDash driver arrived, I made sure my little girl was still fast asleep, then ran down to grab the food from him in the lobby.  
  
When catching the elevator back up, I heard what sounded like my daughter coming from another elevator, but I chalked it up to me hearing “phantom cries.”  
  
When I got into the room, my daughter was not in her Pack ‘N Play or anywhere in the room.  
  
We immediately contacted the local police and cancelled the rest of our trip. The next day, I received a video message on my phone from a blocked number. I open it and there’s my daughter, being sung the birthday song by a young couple that I’ve never seen before and digging into a smash cake in front of her. We turn this video over to the police, but it doesn’t help them narrow down where the video was taken, and they are unable to identify the couple in the video.  
  
For the next nine years, I would get a new video every year of my daughter celebrating her birthday with these strangers – seeing her turn from a baby to a toddler to a little girl in these small flashes. These videos have driven a wedge between my wife and me over the years, especially because we have not been able to produce another child.  
  
That was until AI became such a phenomenon. When this service first became available, I used it occasionally for simple tasks such as writing emails I didn’t want to write and asking it for advice on who I should consider in my fantasy football draft.  When doing a reverse image search to identify tree species on a recent trip, it crossed my mind that I could plug in these birthday videos to attempt to identify the kidnappers with facial recognition.  
  
It worked. The morning of my daughter’s 11^(th) birthday, I received the last video. I was only a few miles away from her when I received it. From my hotel room, where I was finalizing my plans to try to take my daughter back that night, I saw her in the house I had been doing reconnaissance in for the past several months, making birthday pancakes.  
  
That night, as I was creeping past the kitchen of that house on my way to where my daughter slept, I was hit on the side of the head with a heavy object. When I got my bearings, I realized it was one of the kidnappers. I immediately reached behind me to a butcher block that was on the kitchen counter. I grabbed the first knife I could get a hold of and stabbed the man several times.

  
That’s when my daughter walked out. After not seeing her in person for ten years, I immediately recognized her while she saw a crazed man holding a bloody knife, standing over the dead body of the man she thought was her father. She screamed and ran, and before I could catch up to her, she had disappeared. I haven’t seen her since or received any videos on her birthday.
