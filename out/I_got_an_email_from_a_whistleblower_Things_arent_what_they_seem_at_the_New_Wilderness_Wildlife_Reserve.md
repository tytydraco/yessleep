My name is Jordan Richter. I’m an investigative journalist for an independent media outlet. Ever since I had to use my wits, an old tape-recorder, and some fake weed I made from my mother’s arugula plant to catch a few bullies in their lies back in middle school, I’ve been obsessed with exposing corruption. I’ve spent years chasing the truth, going undercover, and even doing some modest hacking. Mostly I do political stuff, scandals, coverups, bribery. Every politician has a skeleton in their closet, and if you look hard enough, they usually have a few dozen. It’s not out of the ordinary for people to send me evidence of bad behavior on a potential suspect, like hotel receipts, photos, bank statements, that kind of thing.

Don’t get me wrong, I never publish anything I get without verifying it. I always look at every case as hearsay until proven correct. You can really mess up someone’s life with a false accusation, and as someone who’s been through that twice, I don’t want to be that guy. Besides, sometimes the stuff people send is just too vague, not convincing, or obviously faked. But ever once in a while I find something really deep, something my editor would call ‘beyond the pale’.

Something dark.

This is one of those times.

I recently received a recording and transcript of a phone call that the whistleblower, who chose to remain anonymous, secretly recorded and sent to me via email. The first time I listened to it, I was shocked, and had to re-listen several times just to be sure I heard it right. Due to technical difficulties with the recording, I can’t post it here, but I can share the transcript. If what is contained within is even remotely true, then anyone who lives in Barron County Ohio needs to get in contact with either their local travel agent, or perhaps a National Guard unit.

The following is the transcript, exactly how it was sent to me, word for word.

*(The recording begins. The sound of a phone ringing can be heard, before a handset is picked up with a soft click, and a man speaks.)*

Voice 1: “Sheriff’s office, how may I help you sir or—”

*(A second man’s voice can be heard shouting through the phone.)*

Voice 2: “Wurnauw! What the *hell* is going on in your district?”

*(A chair creaks, and it sounds as though Voice 1 is clearing his throat.)*

Voice 1: “Mr. Karonti, I—”

Voice 2: “Shut your mouth before I shut it for you. Don’t you know not to use my name on the phone, you hopeless lump? I gave you a job to do, *one job*, and now I’m hearing all kinds of noise about things going wrong down there. You think my group funded your campaign so these kinds of mistakes could happen?”

Voice 1: “Sir, I assure you, my deputies are doing everything we can to—”

Voice 2: “Your deputies? Do you have any idea what I just got done reading? One of your loudmouth deputies has been blabbing online about seeing a Techno in the freaking woods. *Thousands* of people viewed his post, Wurnauw. If just one of them does any amount of digging, our entire operation could be jeopardized.”

*(The sound of a pencil snapping in half can be heard.)*

Voice 1: “I . . . I’ll find the responsible man, and deal with him, sir. It won’t happen again.”

Voice 2: “It better not. As for the park, why didn’t you seize control of New Wilderness like I directed? We need that instillation as a base for operations, and those two-bit rangers are still running around firing guns everywhere, stirring up the herds, and causing the anomalies to migrate. I want them gone, Wurnauw. I don’t care how you do it, just get rid of them.”

Voice 1: “Sir, with all due respect, the Night Rangers outnumber us two to one, and they’re the only ones keeping the Technos and Organics at bay. I’ve lost two men already to the Echo-Spiders, and we can barely keep the roads blocked as it is. Civilians are finding their way in, and every one of them that survives has to be silenced or discredited. I need more men.”

Voice 2: “I have a thousand of my best fighters on standby as we speak. But I need live specimens, Wurnauw, the more the merrier, and we can’t get them if those polo-shirt wearing rent-a-cops are killing them all. Ever since that Cromwell girl popped the last Oak Walker, we’ve had nothing but spikes in the electromagnetic satellite readings from your area. Time is of the essence if we want to contain this thing. Arrest the Night Rangers, clear the New Wilderness Wildlife Reserve of all personnel, and prepare the site for ELSAR to move in.”

Voice 1: “If I move on the park, the rangers might resist. I know the head of security there, and that old Marine won’t give up without a fight. This could spark a real shooting war right in our backyard, and if the public finds out . . .”

Voice 2: “If the public finds out that there are moon-eyed freaks stumbling around in the woods, they’ll start the shooting war themselves. For God’s sake Sheriff, use your head for something other than a hat rack! You want to flush the rangers out? Drive a herd into them, and let the freaks do their job. Once everyone’s dead, we’ll come in and clean up. No one will ever have to know it was you.”

Voice 1: “Look, this would be a whole lot easier if we had more help. I’m not a miracle worker, and rumors spread every time we take another casualty on the force. It’s a small county, sir, with even smaller towns. All it takes is one person talking, and I can’t contain it. Just give me 50 guys, kitted out and ready to go, and at least then we can man the roadblocks.”

*(There is a long pause, and a clock can be heard ticking in the background.)*

Voice 2: “Fine, I can send 50, but no more until the LZ is clear. The situation is rapidly deteriorating, and the more men we move, the more attention we’ll attract. If we can’t seal the Breach soon, we could face an ecological disaster that would make Chernobyl look like Christmas in the Bahamas. I don’t need to remind you what we’ll be forced to do if that happens.”

Voice 1: “Clean Sweep.”

Voice 2: “Exactly. I won’t risk creating another Black Crow Island. The press is distracted by the upcoming elections right now, but if we make one slip-up, we’ll have reporters and home-grown watchdogs breathing down our necks all across the country. We cannot afford another Disaster Zone, especially not after what happened in Canada.”

Voice 1: “I understand sir. As soon as the reinforcements arrive, I’ll have New Wilderness captured for you within a week. Three days tops.”

Voice 2: “Time is critical, Wurnauw. Do not disappoint me on this. Get control of your department, shut the Night Rangers down, and keep the anomalies contained until we get there. I’ll work on suppressing any more online activity regarding your area and run some interference in case a few wannabe private-eyes start Googling things they shouldn’t.”

Voice 1: “Yes sir.”

Voice 2: “Oh, and one more thing. The leak in your department, it’s some moron named Hamond. I don’t care how you do it, or where, just make him disappear, *now*.”

Voice 1: “Hamond, huh? I should have known. Believe me, sir, it’s as good as done.”

*(There is a muted click from the other end of the line, and the recording ends.)*

Naturally, I dove into the internet and started hunting for information as soon as I read the transcript. Try as I might, I couldn’t find anything about a Barron County Ohio in the mainstream press, or on any map anywhere. There is a Barron County in Wisconsin, but nowhere in the foothills of Appalachia, almost as if it’s been selectively deleted from every record available. As for the New Wilderness Wildlife Reserve, I did manage to locate its home page just before a strange computer glitch made it unavailable. Just last week, the park announced it wouldn’t be holding a tour season this year, and that all grounds were closed to the public. It also issued a call for more volunteers for its security department, offering a whopping $40 an hour to anyone who stayed longer than a week, along with free room and board. Sadly, I didn’t get the chance to find any contact information, the site crashing in what I suspect was a coordinated DDOS attack from an unknown source.

What really stood out to me about the whole thing was the capitalization in the transcript of the bizarre words used by the two callers. Technos, Organics, and the vague threat known as the Breach. These seem to refer to some kind of animal species, judging by the use of the word ‘herds’ but it was hard to make heads or tails of it. My search in the regular web turned up nothing, until I stumbled across this site, and found four posts; three of them belonging to a girl named [Madison Cromwell,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/116md9g/stay_away_from_tauerpin_road_part_1/) and one belonging to a sheriff’s deputy, [Sean Hamond.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11vbcyo/beware_the_lights_that_walk/)

From what I can gather in reading their accounts, both claim to have seen creatures of gargantuan and supernatural proportions. If there is any truth to them, then it might be reasonable to infer that the creature Miss Cromwell encountered, (called the ‘Oak Walker’ in the transcript by the mysterious Mr. Karonti) was likely an Organic, due to its plant-like characteristics. This creature seemed to be highly intelligent, and even possibly telekinetic, with the ability to create and control smaller human-sized creatures referred to by Cromwell as ‘Puppets.’ It is also important to note that in both Hamond’s account, and in the secret phone call, the creature known as ‘the Big one’ or ‘the Oak Walker’ is described as a type of apex predator, whose downfall contributed largely to the explosion of anomaly activity outside of the regular area. It is entirely possible that Miss Cromwell did in fact succeed in killing the creature, which in turn allowed lesser species to thrive in its absence and spill out into the environment.

In the second account, the strange metallic monstrosity that attacked Officer Hamond seems to fit rather well into the Techno category, given its electronic and mechanical attributes. This very well could be one of the ‘Echo-Spiders’ brought up by Sheriff Wurnauw. While there isn’t much information to go by, it seems that Organics and Technos are merely subcategories of the various paranormal beings that came from the Breach, and these anomalies present a clear and present danger to all human beings around them. A mention of electromagnetic readings powerful enough to be observed by satellites also seems to indicate that there is significant environmental disturbance going on in the area, which may have contributed to the origins of these species, or perhaps is a byproduct of their existence.

This, of course, was troubling to say the least, but I wanted to know more, and for that, I’d have to find the people who had supposedly witnessed these occurrences firsthand. Armed with two complete names, I info-hunted, and found some alarming results.

Madison Cromwell’s family recently moved from Black Oak to an unknown location somewhere deep in the hills of Idaho. For a family of relatively low-income to undertake such an abrupt move, they were either pursuing better income, or desperately fleeing some form of danger. I have no idea if Madison is alive or not. All of her social media accounts have been deleted, and none of her contacts on the various platforms seem to know if she quit, disappeared the last night of her job, or is still lying low somewhere.

In the case of Sean Hamond, it was announced early yesterday morning that a gunfight broke out in the Barron County Sheriff’s Office between members of the department, resulting in three dead, and four injured. Sean Hamond is said to be still at large, charged with the rather serious crime of organizing domestic terrorism, though no more details have been provided on that. One of the casualties was Officer James Walker, the partner Hamond referenced in his account on this site. Walker was shot twelve times in the firefight and taken to the Black Oak Regional Hospital. According to the hospital reports, he died of his wounds on the operating table soon after. For such violence to break out between fellow peace officers, and for such drastic charges to be leveled, there must be serious issues in the Barron County government, which lends more than a little credence to the validity of the whistleblower’s claims.

But it gets worse.

Upon looking into the reference to ‘Black Crow Island’, I could only find a passing mention about an explosion that destroyed an abandoned sanitorium on a small island off the coast of British Columbia. Not much was provided in terms of detail, except that two people had been seen fleeing the island on a rowboat but were never apprehended. How this is connected, I do not know, but if it was important enough to mention in the phone call, I can only assume it had ties to the same forces at work in Barron County.

As for the vague ‘ELSAR’ group of which Mr. Karonti appears to be a major player in, I found nothing that matched the description of his lethal capabilities. No large-scale private security companies hail by that name, and while I have no doubt it’s an acronym for something, I don’t know what it could be. Whoever they are, I seriously doubt the fighters of ELSAR are interested in the wellbeing of Barron County, or the employees at the New Wilderness Wildlife Reserve.

That leads me to this moment, as I type the finishing touches on my entry. Normally, I would say to refer to my article in our media website for the rest of the story, but my editor was found dead just this morning, with a bullet in his head.

The *back* of his head.

I have a well-adapted gut feeling when I’ve been asking too many questions, stirred around in too many pots, and I know they’re coming for me. Random cars have been following me to-and-from home, strangers keep watching my apartment building, and I found a tracking device stuck to the trunk of my car today. Maybe this little post will garner enough attention to alert the people of Barron County to their imminent danger. Perhaps the New Wilderness Night Rangers will read this in time and find a way to avoid whatever horrible plans Sheriff Wurnauw and ELSAR have for them. Regardless, my part in this investigation is at an end.

My wife, and two boys are waiting for me, at the pre-determined spot I arranged over the burner phone I bought at a local phone kiosk. I have withdrawn all my money in cash, and have booked flights for three different countries, bus tickets for four different cities, and a rental car with three sets of fake license plates. My social media accounts are all deleted, my entire family has shed their personal phones, and I even dyed my hair. If someone reading this is hunting me, good luck. I’ve dug up people who didn’t want to be found for half my life, and my family is at stake here.

You’ll never catch us.

And if you’re someone who lives in Barron County, or heck, anywhere near Ohio, all I can say is . . . brace for impact.
