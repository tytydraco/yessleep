There’s an evolutionary term called Carcinization. It’s the process in which crustaceans evolve in such a way to eventually take the shape of a crab. Some people, particularly those who aren’t who only found out about the phenomena through Reddit posts or word of mouth, take this to mean that the evolutionary path of all creatures eventually leads to becoming a crab. As someone who is studying to become a marine biologist, I used to roll my eyes and correct people on the matter, which is a phenomena that was exclusively to crustaceans, and that they weren’t “becoming crabs” but merely taking a shape more similar to a crab’s body. That’s how it was supposed to work, at least; I was shocked to discover that I was the one in the wrong all along. 

I first observed the changes in late April. My neighbor, a somewhat portly young man named Jason, had begun to rapidly bald and shrink in size and posture despite his age. It was as if he was becoming an elderly man suddenly and uncontrollably at the age of 24; Though I initially didn’t think it was much more than an unfortunate case of biology or disease, the scientific part of me couldn’t help but find some strange fascination in Jason’s sudden deterioration. This fascination made it impossible for me not to study Jason’s deformities, and keep a quiet tally of the severity of the changes each time I saw him. 

This wasn’t difficult, as Jason  would soon come to see me on a bi, sometimes even tri weekly basis. I had begun to suspect that Jason, who by May had been completely bald and shrunken from six-foot-one to five-foot-six with a noticeable hunch in his back, had suddenly begun to lack in female attention. He had begun to rely more and more on my curiosity for companionship, which I didn’t mind; It was a fine transactional relationship for me, wherein Jason got to have a little friendly attention a few times a week while I studied the increasingly rapid change to his physicality. 

By July my mental tallies of Jason’s condition became hand written notes and entire page sketches in my journal. Fascinatingly, Jason was not just shrinking and losing his upright posture, but appeared to be flattening out, with his neck receding in such a way that his head appeared to be fused with his spine, which now was a nearly perfect acute angle with his pelvis. His skin was becoming coarse and rough, his fingers appeared to be fusing together, and his eyes were ever so slightly bulging out of his head. 

I was completely and utterly enthralled with Jason’s condition, and I started to fall behind on coarse work in my self-study of what was going on. He had the symptoms of many different diseases, but no one in particular and none that made sense given his age and presumably good health prior to his transformation. Transformation really was the best word to describe it, because Jason no longer looked like Jason, 24 year old suburban-dwelling man, but had started to look more like.. A crab. 

That’s when it hit me; What if, some how, Jason was undergoing Carcinization? Rather, some sort of new, unheard of Hyper Carcinization? The thought was ridiculous, and impossible given what we know about biology, but I couldn’t get it out of my mind. Something primordial in my head saw Jason and recognized the crab he was becoming, like an evolutionary fear response designed to protect us from predators. It was a deep sense that couldn’t be argued with, no matter how intelligent and rational I was and no matter what the laws of science said could be possible.. But science is not a static thing, as new discoveries every day change our understanding of life and the universe. Though I should rationally be afraid of what was happening to Jason, instead he became my discovery, my new thesis that would rocket me to the stop of the scientific world. I would study Jason, and not allow anything to impede on his transformation, and present my findings to a world in awe of a new understanding of evolution. 

So when I discovered Jason was going to be moving out, away from his home to be taken care of by family and specialist doctors, I knew something had to be done. 

It wasn’t hard to get Jason over to my place. He most definitely confused my interest in his condition and our frequent interactions as affection, and the poor lonely man wouldn’t leave without at least one more visit with his neighbor. I asked if he wanted a drink, and as he stepped into  my kitchen I couldn’t help but stare in awe at what the light caught on Jason’s skin. 

Out of Jason’s skin protruded bone, layering thin across the lengths of his arms and at his shoulder blades. I ran my hands over it and Jason whimpered, clearly sensitive to the touch but too afraid to say anything about it. What I felt was a rough, rocky texture, bumpy in spots and serrated at the edges; Jason was growing chitin. *He was producing a shell*, in a process that seemed to be almost like a crab shedding, only the old shell Jason was shedding was everything that made him human. I knew then and there that I was right about his transformation, and the importance of my discovery. I was also correct about the mixture of Ambien and red wine and the affect it would have on Jason’s consciousness. 

I locked my discovery in the basement, secure from the doctors who would try to steal the credit of my findings. It didn’t take much; Jason, through his transformation, was becoming physically weak. By the time he came over to my home, he was struggling to bear the weight of his own shoulders. A simple deadbolt and a chain for safe measure were enough to keep him down there. I would bring him meals and water once a day and document any noticeable changes made. If Jason ever tried to overpower me or make a run for it, the sound of my taser sparking would change his mind quickly.

His family came looking for him, knocking on my door, asking if I’d seen him and giving me posters to pass out and a number to call. Jason’s sister was especially determined in her search, visiting me more than once with an accusatory tone each time. I was smart enough not to let her in; While you couldn’t hear it from the porch, stepping far enough into my home would subject you to Jason’s weak, pained whimpers and strained cries for help. They were almost nonstop, broken up only by the rare and short lived moments he got to sleep. 

It was enough to make me pity him. Jason was a person before he became my discovery, and listening to the wailing pains of his necessary transformation from person to scientific marvel were enough to make me second guess my work at times. I began checking on him less and less; I couldn’t stand his pathetic begging to be set free each time I came down to study his changes, which were becoming more rapid by the day. 

One day, the mewling and whining stopped. I was certain that Jason had met some kind of untimely demise in the confines of my basement. Guilt washed over me as I climbed down the aged staircase leading into my experiment’s den; It was dark, the lightbulb long since burning out, and worse than that it was quiet. It smelled damp, like a pipe had burst or something was leaking from the bowed wood ceiling into the uneven concrete floor.

As I came to the bottom of the staircase, I was stunned into stillness by fear of what was waiting for me in that dark. I couldn’t tell what was worse at this point, the idea that that Jason could be dead, his half mutated, mangled body rotting in the basement in front of me, or that he was still alive. Would I rather meet the corpse, or the man? 

I had my question answered as I stepped foot on the concrete floor, and something in the darkness lashed out at me. I backed up quickly as what could only be described as a massive claw, made from fingers stretched and elongated out of their sockets and fused together by bone-chitin snapped at the air where my leg had just been. The sound was horrible, a loud clack like two sticks smacked together, followed by a creaking and fleshy tearing as the mutant claw struggled to open back up. 

Frantically, I scooted back up the stairs, clinging to the handrail as I ran backwards, my eyes glued on what was emerging from the darkness below me. What was once Jason’s head came from out of the darkness, fused into his shoulder blades, which now protruded out to cover what would have been his ears. One eye was larger than the other, swollen and protruding and black, creating a mortifying contrast with the human eye that remained, red from the tears that fell down his cheek. There was a slit separating the middle of his chin, making it hard for Jason to speak as his jaw seemed to slack and fall in separate directions when he tried. It did not stop him from trying. 

“Please.. Hungry.. h-Hurt..” I remember him whimpering. Begging. A tone that sounded half like he needed my help and half like he was angry, like he’d snap my neck with that great big claw if he had the chance. I could hear more of that anger reflected as he spoke again, sucking in the spit that dribbled from his split jaw and shouting “PLEASE!” 

My weight was shifted onto the handrail as I started in frozen awe at the terror before me. The weight caused the old wood to bend and snap, catting my hand and sending me falling nearly to the bottom of the stairs. At the sound of my scream, or maybe the smell of my blood, Jason rushed for me, dragging himself forward with a terrible boney apparatus that must have once been an arm or a leg, snapping at me with his massive claw as he dragged the terrible weight of his broken body up the stairs. I scampered back to the door, and while I was able to clear the distance before he was able to catch me, he got close. I could feel in my bones what Jason would do to me if he caught me. 

I stared back down at him, peering up at me from the darkness, crying with his one human eye as the black, bulging bead on his right side seemed to stare at me. I shut the door and locked the locks. I never checked the basement again. 

Weeks went by. There was never the sound of whimpering or begging from the basement again, and I was determined to allow my mistake to die in the dark where I didn’t have to think about it ever again. Despite my wishes, the occasional banging against the door let me know Jason was still alive, smashing his claw against the wood and rattling the locks. This would only stop when I would open the chained door far enough to pass food through the gap. I would shut it quickly, pressing my back to the door each time in case Jason decided to finally break through the wood and attack me. He never did. 

Jason’s sister kept coming back. Kept threatening to call the police if I was keeping anything secret from her. The obvious gash on my hand and the dead look in my eyes were obviously making her suspicious. She’d come to my door and rant about how she knew something was up, that she was going to prove it, that if her brother was hurt or worse she’d kill me. I’d just stare at her and think about how tired I was, and how much I wish I could just give Jason back and forget any of this ever happened. 

Then, one day while she was on my porch, he started banging on the basement door.

Startled, she pushed past me and ran to the basement. I was frozen for a moment as the shock of what happened kept me from fully processing what was going on; I thought about being caught, spending the rest of my life in prison for kidnapping, or worse. Would I be blamed for the deterioration of Jason’s condition? Would my scientific approach to the situation have any bearing in court whatsoever? Did I actually want to get caught, so this nightmare would finally be over?

When I saw her going for the door, I thought about Jason getting out. That thought scared me enough to spring into action. 

I rushed between her and the door. She screamed at me, shouted that she knew she was right and pummeled my chest with her fists. The claw on the other side of the door banged harder, the pressure smashing into my back worse than anything she threw at me. 

She grabbed me by the shoulders and threw me to back away from the door. I lunged for her wrist, grabbing and pulling her back, begging her not to open that door. She didn’t listen, shooting me a look filled with tears and anger. When she finally unlocked the door and threw it open, she glanced back towards the basement. 

I don’t know what look she had then, but I can imagine it. The terror, at least, would have been brief. I watched as that giant claw lunged from out of the darkness and grabbed her leg. I saw her ankle twist in the brief moment before she hit the floor, her head bouncing off the wood with a fleshy thud, the fall taking me with her.. I watched her twist and squirm, turning to face me. She dug her nails into the wood and screamed for help as she was dragged down the staircase, one long tug after the either bringing her further down until everything below her shoulders was swallowed by the dark below. I saw that final, horrible look on her face, tears streaking down her red cheeks, her eyes so wide they looked like they might pop out of their sockets. Then, that massive claw came back from out of the dark and wrapped around her neck. It squeezed slowly, and I heard the cracking and grinding of the bones break. I watched her neck twist and her head fall limp, ending the screaming. Speechless, I simply laid there, watching as her limp body was dragged down the basement stairs. The air hang silent but for the sound of dragging and the thump as her corpse hit every stair on the way down, eventually disappearing into the darkness. 

I lay there for a moment, just staring at the darkness behind the basement door. I knew I should close it, I knew I should run, but I was terrified to move, terrified to bring any attention to the fact that I was still in the room, lest it come for me next. I didn’t have to do anything, though; After a minute or so of silence, the thumping and creaking of the stairs continued once more. 

This time, my discovery had stuck his head out from the doorframe. A few strands of hair hung loosely from a shell made of his shoulder blades and ribcage. What had been his human eye was now black and bulging and split into two. The split down his chin was gone, with his separated jaw forming a mandible mouth that chittered at the sight of me.

What had once been Jason had completely.. Changed into something else. It was Carcinization, evolution in its most unexpected, frightening form. 

The crab just looked at me for a moment, defenseless, shocked by its grotesqueness. Ready to pay for my sins at the bite of a claw. But instead of attack, it simply reached up with its claw, grabbing the doorknob and shutting the door. I watched its eyes stare at me as it disappeared into the darkness. 

I’m trapped here. If I leave, I’ll surely be arrested for murder, and who knows what will become of the crab. Will it kill, be killed, or even be claimed as someone else’s discovery? Despite everything, I still want the credit for discovering this terrible evolution. Maybe it would make all of this mean something. It has to mean something, otherwise it was just a mistake. One that ruined my life and ended two others.

I can’t just stay here, either. Tonight, the house burns down, the crab with it. I’m posting this in hopes that when everything is discovered, I’m still credited with the discovery. I’m calling it Hyper Carcinization, and I hope I’m remembered for the discovery, and I hope some kind of cure or preventative measure can be developed to make sure this never happens to someone again. 

After I post this, I’m going to take a long, drug-induced sleep. I only hope that I don’t wake up to the flames, or worse, in the crab’s den, with that horrible chittering maw and those dead black eyes staring back at me.
