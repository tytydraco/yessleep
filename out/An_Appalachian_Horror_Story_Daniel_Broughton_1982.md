Everything here was scary enough before I’d run out of food…and hope. It was supposed to be a simple, two day in-and-out loop of the Appalachian Trail in order to prepare for my through trip in the spring. But of course, even the best laid plans get laid to rest out here. It was so easy, so simple that after an hour of planning and a quick call out of work my pack was full and I was loading it into the back of the car. Hit the trail, ten miles in, set up camp, stay the night and back out the next day. Too easy. Too simple. Of course if I’d have taken the time to watch damn weather report before I left, I wouldn’t be here now. Cold, hungry, miserable and so far up shit creek I don’t even remember having a paddle. 



Things started out easy. Clear skies and a crisp but not too cold breeze on my drive to the trail. In fact, that’s what inspired me to ditch work for the day and get out and have a little time to myself. Not that selling life insurance was particularly difficult, or exciting for that matter, but getting out and being among some of the most desolate places is what made me feel alive; human. But back to the weather. The hike lulled me into that all too easy peace as the weather held, at least for the first half of the hike. High cirrus clouds rolled by and the last of the brown leaves that clung to the trees rustled underneath. Typical for early December. I sat down on a hickory stump just at the crest of a little ridge to take my pack off, get a snack and just enjoy the view. And the view would be the last thing I would enjoy for a while. 



Taking in the scenery and watching a squirrel jump from branch to branch I noticed it, way off in the distance. Like a giant grey anvil dragging across the tops of the mountains in its path. The pine trees clung to their needles as I watched the wind hit them, the bare branches of the other trees furiously dancing along to the same tune. As I watched this monstrous weather system barrel toward me with an alarming speed for this time of year, I knew I wouldn’t have the two hours it took me to make it back to the car, or the additional two hours it would take me to reach my campsite. This was the time to make what we would call a business decision. 



By the looks of it I had maybe 45 minutes until this thing was on top of me. From the way those trees were moving, I knew I’d have to get clear of anything big and dead for fear of it falling right on top of me. I also didn’t want to sit atop this ridge and get whooped by the absolute worst of this storm, so I went down. I had no choice but to get off the trail: first mistake. But I had to act fast to get out of harm’s way. I half-walked half-slid about fifty feet down the slope and found an overhang underneath a small outcropping of rock that while not deep enough to keep me completely dry, should at least serve to anything larger than raindrops from hitting me in the head.  



I nestled up as far as I could in my home for the next few hours and worked quickly to break out whatever I had to keep me dry. Now usually, I employ a small but comfortable enough solo tent that has just enough room for me and my bag. Well without the time or the proper area to set that up, I’d have to make do with the small packable raincoat I carry on the milder days and a rain cover for my backpack that is in essence and appearance just a giant shower cap. We’ll call this lack of preparation mistake number two. Settling in I could see it was getting dark. Unnaturally dark for mid afternoon when the sun should’ve been up for at least another three to four hours. Forget the forty-five minutes I thought I had, this thing would be here in ten to fifteen tops. No sooner had the thought crossed my mind than it started. 

	

Wind like I’d never seen before; and I’ve spent more than my fair share of time out here, mind you. The wind mingled with the sound of 100 foot tall pine and oak trees groaning and creaking under the strain. It was almost pitch black now and I could hear sheets of rain falling not too far in the distance. Branches started to snap and crack, and I was thankful for the shelter I had been able to find from them. The rain was on top of me now and the first sheet fell like someone had slapped a cold, wet towel right across the ground. The rain fell hard, and froze the second it hit the ground, or the trees, or the rocks or whatever else it could find. This was the worst case. Although snow meant colder weather at least it was dry, or dryer. Getting wet and then cold out here was a one-way ticket to hypothermia, and you could be pretty damn sure you weren't coming back. All I could do now was pull my knees to my chest and do my best to keep myself warm and dry. 



Unfortunately, that plan lasted all of about 15 minutes. As the wind whipped back and forth it drove that frigid rain sideways right at me, my natural shelter acting more as a funnel than a shield at that point. My cheap, fire-engine red PVC raincoat fought for everything it was worth but at some point the icy water started seeping through. I was sure of the same with my backpack but I didn’t have the heart to check at that moment. I assumed that as quickly as this storm had popped up it would subside in a similar manner. Mistake number three. After an hour I was shivering uncontrollably as everything, including myself, was covered in a thin layer of ice. The wind continued to throw rain, branches and anything else unfortunate enough to be too light in every direction. Then the sickening sound of what had to be a hundred foot tree breaking at its base; just uphill of me.



I had about three seconds to process the splintering and cracking before it was on top of me. The tree had broken off at its base and came tumbling down the side of the face, right on top of me. While my head and torso were protected my knees still protruded outside just a bit, but enough. The falling log had caught me right in the shins and sent me tumbling end over end until everything went dark, or somehow darker than it already was. 



I woke up face down in a puddle of mud with a headache from the depths of hell. Had I not been in the middle of nowhere it would have been safe to assume waking up in this condition was nothing short of an otherworldly hangover. As I ever so slowly stood up, the throbbing in my head got worse as I squinted to make out my surroundings through the hint of sunlight starting to rise over the mountain. In my new surroundings I had no idea where I’d fallen from or how far the drop was, but as I took stock of myself I found several things wrong. My backpack, and everything else I had out here, was completely gone as far as I could tell. As I brushed my fingers across my forehead I felt a sting of pain along with the accompanying trail of dried blood. Thankfully, it felt like my limbs were all intact, although bruised and sore, and facing the right direction. Aside from a sharp pain in my left side which I attributed to some bruised ribs, I was *mostly* intact.



Now came the difficult task at hand, figuring out which way I’d fallen from and thus regaining the trail I had hiked in on. I was in a bit of a gulley with two steep faces on either side of me. While not insurmountably steep, the mess of fallen limbs, dislodged ricks and uprooted trees would make for an arduous climb for some one that hadn’t spent the last who knows how many hours face down in a ditch. Even worse, nothing was recognizable. The storm had wreaked so much havoc that there was nothing to identify my path from the day before. As I gathered in the scene I noticed something else as well. The thin layer of ice deposited by the storm glistened in the early morning sun, but there wasn’t a sound. 



Now normally, winter sunrises in the forest are a busy time. Whatever animals aren’t burrowed away for the winter come out as soon as they see light to seek some refuge from the cold and frost of the night before. I would have expected to hear birds chirping, some leaves and branches rustling but nothing. Just icy stillness and deathly quiet. The only thing that could have made it scarier was the distant sound of banjos. 



Anyone who’s been lost in a forest can attest to the fact that it's easy to get turned around, and on top of that if you don’t know where you are everything starts to look the same. Many a lost hiker has walked through the woods for hours, days and sometimes even weeks only to end up right back in the same place they started. Some say it's because we favor one leg or side, or it's just a natural inclination to lean one way or the other. Regardless, it's rather fruitless to wander without a known destination. So in that eerie morning still I turned, first one way then the other, desperately looking for something to help me orient myself. So I picked a ridge, the one toward my left shoulder and decided, or rather convinced myself, that was the hill I’d come from and thus was the one I needed to go back up. Climbing up was slow and rough. Much of the soil had been washed out and what wasn’t was still coated in that fine layer of ice. Not to mention the maze of briars, mountain laurel and rhododendron that kept visibility to mere feet in front of me. Last but not least the damage from the storm had dislodged everything from branches to entire trees. 



For what felt like hours I picked, trudged and waded my way through thorns, thickets and who knows what else. With the undergrowth blotting out the sun, the only guide I had was up, knowing that moving uphill would *hopefully* get me back to my starting point, and out of this nightmare. With my backpack and all the other rather expensive supplies I’d spent years accumulating, I doubted I’d be back out here very soon once I got back to my car. I’d drive away and leave this nightmare behind, relegated to a now rather hazy memory. But hours of arduous climbing, many times on all fours, yielding nothing. As I finally crested the ridge I found…nothing. Not a trail, a clearing or even a stump to sit on. If I thought I was turned around before I was even more so now. I had no idea where I was in relation to my path out of here. And to make it worse I’d spent the better part of the day, and my energy, climbing up the wrong mountain. I had nothing to my name but the clothes on my back, and those were in tatters and covered in mud after all that happened. 



What to do next took some severe deliberation. On top of the ridge I could see that it was late afternoon through the treetops. That meant I only had a couple hours to find a shelter or a way out of here; God willing the latter. The only thing I could think to do was follow the ridge and try to find a clearing or some vantage point to get my bearings. As I trudged along, I could feel the last twenty four hours starting to catch up with me in a big kind of way. With nothing left to eat or drink, I could feel my body starting to wear out after a day of climbing. My head was still pounding and I had been running on adrenaline and the hope of getting home. But with both of those quickly dwindling, I had to find some water or I wouldn’t be alive long enough to make it home. So I ditched the ridge top and headed downhill on the other side of the ridge from where I’d come, where the water would, or should, be. Mistake number four. 



With yesterday’s storm I found water pretty quickly, a little runoff that had started as the ice melted in the warmer part of the day. While it wasn’t much, it was an accomplishment to find any water and helped the symphony in my head subside a bit. However, I had a bigger problem now. The sun was getting low and the trees were already throwing long shadows over the sloped ground. I had to admit to myself that there was no way I was getting out of here tonight and as much as I hated it, I had to find some sort of shelter. It would only get colder as the sun said its goodbyes for the day and left me out here alone until the morning. 



I headed further downhill, as I figured this area would be less exposed and stood a greater chance of providing me some decent repose from the elements, I could already feel myself getting cold and dreaded spending another night like I had the night prior. Thankfully, it didn’t take me long to find shelter, and something much more sizable than last night’s accommodations at that. I decided I wasn’t going to find anything better than this, and this would have to do. Mistake number five. 



The entrance to the cave wasn’t very big, but it was a Ritz-Carlton compared to last night’s situation. It was about ten feet wide, the length of a small car. It was slightly smaller in height. I had room to walk in without stooping, but it wasn’t much taller than that. Six and a half, seven foot tops. Now ordinarily I would be wary of a spot like this, as I’m not the only creature stuck out here looking for a place to hole up this time of year. Black bears are extremely common and love little caves just like this. But I was desperate, and I could also see far enough into the cave to ease my mind a bit. It went back maybe twenty feet to an upward grade that went *almost* to the ceiling. Made of loose rock, it looked like the remnants of a long past landslide had most likely filled the cave in. A short space was left at the top, between the top of the rocks and the cave ceiling, but maybe a foot, and far too small a space for a bear or anything else aside from a small animal to squeeze through. Sharing this cave with a few raccoons or groundhogs would be better than sleeping out in the cold. 



With my last few minutes of sunlight I did my best to gather some firewood, as I still had half a pack of Marlboro reds and a lighter in my pants pocket (and they say smoking kills). As I gathered the driest wood I could find in the damp woods, I noticed it again. Nothing. Not a sound. Not a bird or a breeze or a single sound. Stillness. Silence. 



WIth a small but steady fire going at the mouth of the cave, I sat close to it to try and warm and dry myself the best I could. I was hungry, exhausted, cold, and still in pain from my ordeal. But at least I had some shelter and protection from the cold and whatever else might be out there. Appalachia has always had more than its fair share of ghost stories and tall tales. Rumors of feral folks in East Tennessee to Mothman in West Virginia, the Wendigo, Bigfoot and everything in between. Sure the nights out here could be dark, and especially when you’re alone your mind can play tricks on you. But I’d grown up around here and had grown comfortable with the oppressive darkness and the noises at night. I comforted myself with these thoughts as I drifted into a much needed sleep. Mistake number six. 



I woke to a whisper, albeit faint. But it wasn’t in my ears. It was like it came from the back of my neck. Like nails on a chalkboard, no like knives on a chalkboard. And that horrifying almost-voice was whispering my name. “*Daniel…DANIEL….****DANIEL”.*** It was accompanied by a seeping cold from that little opening at the back of the cave. Not just cold, frigid, icy, like somehow there was an invisible stream of arctic water flowing from the back of that cave right across that body. I shot upright out of whatever semblance of sleep I was getting and noticed the fire had doubled in size, despite my neglecting to feed it in my slumber. Casting its light on the sides and ceiling of my humble abode, the fire revealed a mass of writing, or symbols or something in between on nearly every inch of the walls. They appeared and disappeared in an instant, as if someone was writing them and someone else was erasing right behind them. Some large, some small, in sequences like words and sentences, but completely and utterly nonsensical and still somehow terrifying aand foreboding to me. As horrified as I was, I was frozen, almost too confused to do anything at all. I could still feel that permeating cold and the tingle at the base of my neck. 



Suddenly with a rush of icy wind from the back of the cave, the fire went out like a match in a rainstorm and I was left standing alone in pitch black. That feeling in the back of my neck  exploded through my entire head and turned into a ringing in my ears that quite literally knocked me to the ground. I tried to run, tried to move, tried to breathe but found it impossible to do any of those. Out of my own mouth came that same horrid voice, this time audible, a horrible rasping that hurt vocal chords that somehow were not under my control anymore. “***They’ve come back, at last. I was tired of waiting.”***



I gasped, regaining what composure I could muster and I ran. Out into that dark night. I didn’t know where, I just knew with every fiber of my being I had to get out of there. I sprinted into the nothingness until something hit me. Right across the head. Hard. 



And everything went dark. Somehow darker than the already black night. Darker than the night in the storm and darker than anything I thought possible before. And silent. Not a single sound. Stillness. *Silence.* 



More to come…
